EDINBURGH-based J Smart (Contractors) yesterday announced a 53%
increase in interim profits and forecast a significant improvement in
its full-year result.
Reversing the recession-fuelled rot of recent years, Smart posted
pre-tax earnings of #1.21m for the six months to end-January, up from
#790,000 in the same period of its previous financial year. The City
welcomed the news and Smart shares gained 7p to 202p.
However, chairman John Smart pointed out that most of the achieved and
predicted improvement in profits was down to exceptional items, adding
that the sector remained static.
As is the practice in the family-dominated company, shareholders
owning about 50% of the shares waived their rights to the 2.4p interim.
Mr Smart anticipates group profits for the second half will
''comfortably exceed'' first-half earnings.
Smart's final profits, which amounted to #1.65m in its previous
financial year, should therefore top #2.4m.
First-half profits included a one-off gain of about #250,000 on an
asset sale.
However, Smart has already notched up about #900,000 of exceptional
profits from sales of land and property in the second-half.
The proceeds of these disposals have been used to purchase more
building land.

<HEADLINE>Stable milk quota</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978206885</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DAIRY farmers should benefit from a more stable quota market
throughout the 1995/96 milk year, according to Mr Tony Carver, head of
the Bruton Knowles' National Quota Exchange. The underlying
profitability of the dairy sector will, however, keep prices firm, he
forecast. In his view those who rely on leasing more than 15% to 20% of
their requirement will be in for another difficult year.
''It was generally anticipated that April 1995's production would be
lower than last year but, in practice, the butterfat adjusted production
is actually higher,'' he said.
''This has been exacerbated by the fact that the supply of quota is
not meeting expectations.'' It may be that people with herd dispersals
booked for April and May had already sold the quota 100% used towards
the end of the last milk year.
Nevertheless, said Mr Carver, there are several factors which should
combine to create a stable long-term outlook, the most notable being
that purchaser groups have control over their producers' quota for the
full year.
The expected flow of retirements was occurring, particularly among
farmers aged 56 or over who could exploit the tax relief available or
who had no successor. The availability of quota was, however, hardly
sufficient to meet demand from committed diary farmers who were keen to
obtain more to cover future expansion.
''Unless circumstances conspire against us we do not envisage leasing
prices exceeding 15p a litre, which is not far above the current
price,'' he said. ''While purchase prices have risen sharply of late, in
the long term they are likely to level out at 55p to 65p a litre, at
least until the leasing scheme closes.''

TOKYO: The Japanese Government has ordered tighter discipline in
Japan's Self Defence Force after the arrest of a paratrooper suspected
of stealing data from the country's largest defence contractor,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, to help the doomsday cult linked to Tokyo's
subway nerve gas attack. The arrest was the latest in which members of
the Japanese military have broken the law to aid the cult, Aum Shinri

MORE than 100 oil yard workers avoided redundancy yesterday after
winning a court interdict.
Lord Dawson at the Court of Session in Edinburgh granted the interdict
in the name of Paul McKay from Alness on Wednesday night.
Mr McKay, a welder at the Brown and Root Highlands Fabricators oil
construction yard in Easter Ross, was one of the workers transferred to
the McDermotts yard at Ardersier when the two bases merged in January.
About 450 men at Nigg went on unoffical strike on Wednesday over the
company's redundancies. The strike is expected to last until Monday.
Mr McKay, who was represented at the court hearing by lawyers for the
GMB union, was granted interdict on the basis Brown and Root was to make
him redundant regardless of his continuity of service.
GMB Highlands and Islands organiser Bruce Crabtree said: ''Lord
Dawson's ruling upholds the union belief that whenever a worker
transfers from one undertaking to another all of their working
conditions must transfer with them.''
Otherwise he said it could mean that a Nigg worker with 20 years
service could go to Ardersier and then be made redundant while a worker
with only one year service gets the job.
A spokesman for the merged company Barmac said discussions towards a
common agreement for both yards are at an advanced stage and a final
offer has been given to joint shop stewards representing both
workforces.

SCOTTISH Natural Heritage, the agency which was created three years
ago in a merger between the Countryside Commission for Scotland and the
Nature Conservancy Council, is to be the subject of a review carried out
by the Scottish Office and SNH itself.
Insiders last night expressed concern that the study was a reflection
of ministerial concerns about how the quango was performing its
functions.
Others said they feared the review, which is to be completed by
September, had been ordered by the Treasury in a move to cut costs
before tax-cutting measures.
There was also speculation that the review had been called after a
reorganisation of Scottish Office departments announced last week, in
which the environment was put alongside agriculture and fisheries.
SNH chief executive Roger Crofts said the review would be looking at
SNH's priorities, particularly in the light of recent EU habitats and
birds directives, its extra work generated by studies of the Cairngorms,
Loch Lomond, and the Trossachs, and new environmental education
initiatives.
It is understood the review -- announced yesterday at a full meeting
of regional and full board members and scientific members at Battleby,
in Perth -- is to be chaired by Mr Harold Mills, head of the Scottish
Office Environment Department, and will look at SNH's core functions,
whether it is giving value for money, its range of activities including
its use of resources, and various options for delivering the
Government's environmental agenda.
Some members are concerned the review may decide the SNH model is not,
after all, the Government's preferred option and that a cheaper
alternative may be adopted.
Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour's environment spokesman in Scotland, welcomed
the review but said he would be concerned if it turned out to be a
cost-cutting exercise.
He said that, while he had supported the setting up of SNH when the
Bill was enacted five years ago, he was now having second thoughts.
''It has become a landowners' extension and lost the Countryside
Commission side -- the access and recreation part of its remit,'' said
Mr Galbraith.
Meanwhile, the National Trust for Scotland, the country's leading
voluntary conservation body, admitted yesterday that it faced a major
shake-up of its management system -- which will see jobs shed among its
Edinburgh headquarters staff.
Nine HQ staff jobs are to go, along with one director's post, with the
possibility of more in the medium term.

RARELY can so much have been written or said about a footballer who
has played so little, but Paul Gascoigne's name continues to dominate
the game's grapevine, although the likelihood now is that the English
internationalist will not put pen to any club's headed notepaper for at
least a few days more, writes James Traynor.
One of his agents, Len Lazarus, said yesterday the 27-year-old has not
signed for anyone yet and pointed out that the only issue which has been
settled so far is the matter of compensation between Gascoigne and
Lazio.
Lazio were resisting Gascoigne's claims for payment for the two
remaining years of his contract with them, but meetings in London, which
took up all of Wednesday, brought player and club closer together.
Eventually, agreement was reached before they parted company of the
final time, leaving the player free to concentrate fully on his next
career move.
Rangers, of course, are first in line, having agreed a #4.5m fee with
Lazio, and the Ibrox club, who believe Gascoigne will be with them next
season, anticipate making a statement next week.
David Murray has agreed terms with Gascoigne's people, but Lazarus
said: ''It is now up to Paul to decide where his future lies. He will do
that over the next two or three days.''

AFTER the momentous struggle, Cape Town was still alive late into the
night with celebrations, and a smiling Francois Pienaar, the South
African captain, said that recent experience at having been back in
international competition had paved the way for his side's defeat of
Australia in the opening game.
''We knew the players that we were up against, and that made a lot of
difference to us,'' he said. ''Experience has become a key to our team,
and many of us have been on tour together and our game has developed
with that.
''I cannot take away from how the Australians played as they were very
committed and took the game to us on many occasions. But these top-level
games are on a knife edge, and we had the better of the day.''
As to the occasion, when he and his team had been overwhelmed at their
reception, Pienaar said that he had been a proud captain on the day.
''It was a tremendous day for us. It got to us as a team in the first
half, but after that we knew we were being lifted by the crowd. We
played well, but I can tell you that we are far from our best yet.''
He also paid tribute to his tight five in the scrum, a unit that many
experts said would crumble in the face of an Aussie onslaught that never
materialised. ''These guys get a lot of stick, but today they were
fantastic. OK, we struggled in the lineouts, but our men were
committed.''
Whereas Pienaar and his charges were more than happy with their win,
the Australians looked perplexed at so many of their moves having gone
wrong under pressure.
''I was surprised that our players made so many mistakes,'' said
Australia coach Bob Dwyer. ''We had men running into each other, dropped
passes, players out of position, and a lack of cohesion at times. That
does not happen in our practices, and it should not happen in our games.
''Maybe some of the players weren't relaxed enough, but it is possible
that the atmosphere in that ground got to them. Whatever, our technique
let us down. Perhaps there is pressure on now for places.
''A huge improvement is needed and we may experiment with players. It
is a really big blow to lose any Test but we are still in business and
England reached the 1991 final after losing their first match.''

<HEADLINE>LIST aims to protect interests of farmers Backing for livestock industry</HEADLINE>

A COALITION of farmers, cattle and sheep breeders and livestock
auctioneers has been formed under the name of the Livestock Industry
Support Trust to protect the interests of the UK livestock industry.
Mr Rowland Kershaw-Dalby, secretary of the National Cattle Breeders
Association, is a council member of the new body and acts as its
spokesman.
Speaking at the London launch of LIST he said:''We are a group of
professional people engaged in the UK livestock industry, which accounts
for about 63% of Britain's entire farming output. Our members care for
animals 365 days a year.
''Although live animal exports will be only one of the issues we
intend to address, quite clearly the current public misunderstanding
means that it will command a high priority in our campaign of public
education. Cattle and sheep have been moved around this country by lorry
since motor transport began and such movements are subject to strict
conditions which are rigorously enforced.
''We believe that the attempts physically to stop animal exports
strike at far more than agriculture. It would intolerable and an outrage
if those going about their lawful business were prevented from doing so
by a mob.''
Among the main objectives of the new organisation will be offering
advice to senior decision makers and opinion formers on the ''true
nature'' of the industry's activities and its importance to Britain's
agricultural economy, especially the livlihood of the farming community.
It will also seek to contribute to the development of codes of
practice for the transport and handling of livestock and to promote the
training of oeprators involved in that side of the business.
Mr Kershaw-Dalby said that there was a need to cut through the emotion
and explain to the public at large some of the basic facts about the
livestock industry.
Livestock production in Europe was geographically seasonal and it was
vital that animals could be transported quickly and efficiently from
where they were born to other areas for finishing, and finally to the
markets where they were in demand. That trade, which generated #200m of
income, was essential to the future viability of livestock production in
some of the remoter hill farming areas inclduing Scotland and Wales. It
helped to maintain these rural communities and the countryside for
everyone to enjoy, including tourists from abroad.
LIST would also draw the consumers' attention to the hypocrisy of the
anti-farming lobby, he said.
The UK imported meat from Australasia, North and South America and
from countries in Africa. Under the GATT agreement these countries would
have increased access to UK markets but few of them had any legislation
on animal welfare at all.
Australia had only recently introduced a maximum journey time of 36
hours for livestock. It would be disastrous for the British livestock
industry if consumer demands for more controls on home production led to
increasing imports of meat produced to lower welfare standards. That
would ensure the destruction of the UK industry while encouraging
production from countries with the lowest animal welfare standards.

Australia 18, South Africa 27
NEWLANDS, at the foot of Table Mountain in Cape Town, has hosted the
biggest game in the history of world rugby. Titanic hardly describes it
as a confrontation.
The South Africans, united under their slogan: ''One team, one
country,'' had met Nelson Mandela the day before, a moment where he was
able to pass on his wishes for their victory.
''I told the guys that if we battled on the pitch as hard as he had in
his life, we had a chance,'' said Francois Pienaar, the Springboks
captain.
Allowed back into world sport in 1992, it was their chance to show the
rest of the world the beauty of their country, how they are one people,
and that their team can win.
Many were in tears at an opening ceremony that ran like clockwork,
Mandela, in his speech, talking of this ''rainbow'' nation.
Australia arrived with technical guile, alarming size, and ruthless
efficiency. Lynagh the kicker, Campese the runner, Ofahengaue the
bulldozer.
The holders oozed a pre-match confidence brought about by relentless
adherence to the scientific progress of their chosen sport, and their
natural Australian characteristic of wanting to be best.
Australia have been planning for the last two years to retain the
crown, giving their effort the corny title of ''Operation Repeat,''
which stands for Return to Ellis Park and Ensure Another Twickenham.
Everyone had told them they were favourites.
Pre-match scenes were, frankly, unbelievable, with crowds gathering at
nine in the morning to party in the warm, mid-seventies, Cape Town sun,
painted faces in South Africa colours, sing songs, and eat and drink.
Spectators ran the gauntlet of Zulu dancers, African singers, and a host
of highly successful pick pockets.
The winners would have the easier route from here on, and the losers
faced the prospect of a tussle with England in the quarter-finals.
But the Australians made mistakes that were highly unusual for them.
Time and again they dropped the ball behind the scrum and lost
possession, and the South Africans, urged on by a frantic crowd,
combined passion and skill in a game that yet further proves that rugby
of this type is not for mere mortals.
The men on this pitch were half man, part muscle, but freaks on the
human scale without a doubt. Francois Pienaar was a tenacious leader and
tackler among his men.
To the delight of the crowd, South Africa led at half-time.
Destroyed four to one in the lineouts, John Eales, the principal
pirate for the Aussies, nevertheless managed to manufacture a try for
Peter Hendricks on the left wing. He outstripped David Campese, covering
after a rampage from rock-hard hooker James Dalton, and the silky boot
of Joel Stransky at stand-off provided the other nine points.
Joost van der Westhuisen again proved his versatility at scrum half,
his forwards did far better in the scrums than had been expected, and
Andre Joubert stuck to a kicking game designed to keep Aussie danger men
in their own territory.
Michael Lynagh, playing in his thirteenth World Cup game, had a try
that kept the holders in the tie, and it came after six successive
rucks, when he was left with the chance to swerve outside Balie Swarts
for the touchdown, but Pienaar's eight grew in stature as the game
progressed.
In the second half, Cape Town's inhabitants went delirious as their
team marched on with another 13 points, when they camped in Australian
territory. Stransky slotted a penalty and a drop goal at a period when
Australian Phil Kearns knocked on, a Lynagh drop kick failed to go the
distance, and backs moves went, quite literaly, down under.
South Africa had been disallowed two tries, James Dalton losing the
ball over the line and James Small with an effort chalked off, but a
neat back-row move helped van der Westhuisen flip a blind-side pass to a
new hero, Joel Stransky, and he crossed for five points.
His conversion sailed through, Phil Kearns found space on the left
from a long, Lynagh pass for a late consolation Australian try, but, as
if to sum up their day, Lynagh missed the conversion.
South Africa had won a world-class match on a world-class occasion.
There was more to this day than rugby, their nation was back in the
fold, and they deserved it.
This South African success means that Australia now are odds-on to
meet England in a quarter-final, a prospect which England manager Jack
Rowell finds daunting. ''Australia were really wound up towards the end
of the game and we didn't need that,'' said Rowell.
''Australia have been given a kick and will be looking to bounce back
when it next matters in the quarter-final -- that could be it for us.
But the quarter-final was always going to be a shoot-out and nothing has
changed, but this time Australia will have a lot of trouble from England
because everyone knows that the loser will be going home and obviously
it could be us.
''The South African players have now leapfrogged the World Cup
favourites and it's obvious it's a big advantage to be at home as it was
for England in 1991.''
South Africa -- A Joubert; J Small, J Mulder, H Le Roux, P Hendricks;
J Stransky, J van der Vesthuizen; P Du Randt, J Dalton, B Swart, M
Andrews, H Strydom, F Pienaar, R Kruger, R Straeuli.

Dunfermline 1, Aberdeen 3
(Aggregate: 2-6)
ABERDEEN finally made good their escape from the grasping arms of
relegation and, under the driving energy of manager Roy Aitken, can
return their attention to restoring a reputation and status that was all
but destroyed in perhaps their worst season in recent memory.
As their fans celebrated in ecstatic fashion -- they even had a minor
invasion of the pitch and carried off captain Stewart McKimmmie on their
shoulders before returning to the terracing -- it is worth recalling
that all their team won was breathing space to get things right next
time.
At least they showed the right attitude in these closing weeks of the
season, an application that brought six wins out of their last seven
games.
A delighted Aitken said: ''Our aim was premier division survival and
we have achieved that. It is very satisfying. I was always confident we
could do it if we were at our best, and the players have responded
tremendously. I will take time during the summer to take stock of the
club's position and we'll come back ready for the new season.''
Dunfermline, down 3-1 from the first leg of this play-off, were never
given a real chance to get into serious contention.
Urged on by the majority in the 18,000 crowd, the Fifers fulfilled
their promise to mount the charge from the off. However, Aberdeen stuck
to their discipline and gradually found space for counter-attacks.
Aberdeen had real claims for a penalty when Dodds was knocked over by
van de Kamp, who had reacted a little late after the ball had broken off
Irvine. Referee Jim McCluskey, who who was close enough, let it go.
Irvine was booked for a foul on Smith, but the Fife player was
fortunate soon after to escape serious discipline when he seemed to
stamp on Glass.
Shearer opened the second half with a dipping shot that was only a
little too high, but the goal that left Dunfermline no way back came in
50 minutes. Miller's pass to Wright caught the Fife defence flat-footed
and when his cross came over Dodds found himself in isolation between
defenders and gratefully headed out of van de Kamp's reach.
In 66 minutes, Shearer's low cross was missed by Dodds, but Miller was
there to smash the ball over the line.
Dunfermline's courage brought a reward in 72 minutes, when Smith sent
a fine lob over Snelders, but nine minutes later Glass, fed by Shearer,
slipped around van de Kamp before touching the ball over for goal No.3.
DUNFERMLINE -- Van de Kamp, McNamara, Fleming, McCathie, Tod, Smith,
Den Bieman, Robertson, Moore, Petrie, McCulloch. Substitutes -- Shaw,
Hawkins, Westwater.
ABERDEEN -- Snelders, McKimmie, Wright, Grant, Irvine, Smith,
Hetherston, Shearer, Miller, Dodds, Glass. Substitutes -- Kane, Inglis,
Watt.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

THE pupils of Milngavie primary school were on the mat in front of
their head teacher yesterday. But from the wide grins and shrieks of
glee, it was obviously an enjoyable experience.
The school is one of the first to be visited in a new #400,000 UK
initiative to take amateur wrestling to the grass roots. It is believed
to be one of Britain's largest sponsorship packages for a minority
sport.
Sandy McNeil, secretary of the British and Scottish Amateur Wrestling
Associations, confirmed that around #80,000 would come to Scotland over
the three-year term of a deal backed by a London-based investment group,
Sabre Fund Management, and the Sportsmatch scheme.
Three Commonwealth Games competitors, bronze medallist Calum McNeill,
his brother, Gregor, and Jim Breen, helped show the basics to the
pupils.
''It is a tall order, but our aim is to increase Scotland's 200 active
competitors to 2000 -- on a par with cycling and twice as many as boxing
-- over the next three years,'' said Sandy McNeil, who is organising
clinics in schools across the country. Leading international coach,
Granite Taropin, a Ukrainian, has been hired full time, to help with the
project. Schools interested in hosting clinics should contact the
Scottish AWA, 0141 334 3843.

FRANCE have named a full-strength side for their Pool D opener against
Tonga in Pretoria today. French coach Pierre Berbizier said: ''We don't
know much about our opponents but we can't afford to underestimate them.
It's our first game in the World Cup and we can't afford to lose it.''
French manager Guy Laporte said the Tonga match and the clash with
Ivory Coast four days later would allow France to ascertain their best
players before the all-important match against Scotland in Pretoria on
June 3. French team:
J L Sadourny; E Ntamack, T Lacroix, P Sella, P Saint-Andre (captain);
Y Delaigue, A Hueber; M Cecillon, A Benazzi, P Benetton, O Brouzet, O
Merle, P Gallart, J M Gonzalez, L Armary.
* CANADA and Romania, the two lesser lights in Pool A, start their
campaign in Port Elizabeth this afternoon knowing the loser faces almost
certain elimination.
For Canada, quarter-finalists in '91, the game is the first of at
least two they must win to have any hopes of a repeat performance this
time round. ''We have to win this one if we are to stand any chance of
doing well in this tournament,'' said captain Gareth Rees, while Romania
manager Teodor Radulescu places even greater importance on the game.
''This is not a mini-final for us,'' he says. ''This is our World Cup
final.''
* ALL Black centre Frank Bunce has spoken about the huge differences
between his last World Cup appearance and this year. Bunce played for
Western Samoa in 1991 but now has won 23 New Zealand caps and is a
senior player for the country of his birth.
And Bunce's experiences underline the growing gap between the top
rugby nations and those not wealthy enough to set themselves down the
road towards professionalism or semi-professionalism.
''In 1991 the Western Samoan team operated on a budget of next to
nothing,'' said Bunce, ''and I don't think it's any different for them
this time. But with the All Blacks no expense has been spared.
''The generosity of our sponsors, and of the New Zealand Rugby Union
has meant that we have been given every opportunity to prepare ourselves
for this World Cup.''
* THE bookmakers now have made South Africa 7-4 favourites for the
World Cup following their victory over Australia in Cape Town, with the
Wallabies 3-1 second best.
* WALES manager Jeff Evans has criticised the tournament organisers
over a colour clash which means his side must wear green rather than red
against Japan tomorrow.
All other clashes of strip were resolved before teams arrived in South
Africa, but organisers overlooked the fact that Japan's red and white
hooped shirts might be confused with Wales' red for their Pool C match
in Bloemfontein.
''I spoke to Craig Jamieson (tournament manager) and pointed out that
there might be a problem,'' said Evans. ''He told me he would deal with
it but nothing has been done. I find it very strange that it wasn't
looked at before.''
With Japan not having a second strip, Wales decided that they would
play in green.

Derek Douglas reports from South Africa.
THE phoney war is over and today, against Ivory Coast, Scotland's
Rugby World Cup campaign begins in earnest.
For almost a year virtually the entire focus of the Scottish side has
been on the moment when, at three o'clock UK time in the Olympia
Stadium, Rustenburg, the talking ends and the action must speak louder
than words.
Yesterday, as the Scots underwent a light training session at their
Pretoria base, captain Gavin Hastings said his men were ''straining at
the leash'' and raring to go.
The Scots have been in South Africa for 10 days. They have staged some
mighty impressive training sessions and look as mean and finely honed as
any Scottish side in recent years, but the proof of the biltong, as they
say out here on the high veldt, will be in the eating.
In an effort not to be lulled into a false sense of security, manager
Duncan Paterson has gone to great lengths this week to ''talk up'' the
prowess of the Ivoriennes. However, Paterson will know that, once
control has been achieved, nothing less than a riot of scoring from the
Scots will really do if they are to get their campaign off to an
emphatic start.
Again yesterday, Paterson was down-playing the ''points on the board
factor,'' he said. ''There is a lot of emphasis being laid by the media
on points. However, it is largely irrelevant. As coach Dougie Morgan
keeps telling the boys, get the basics and the priorities right and the
points will take care of themselves.''
Last month, in a warm-up game against Northern Transvaal -- Scotland's
hosts here in Pretoria -- the Ivory Coast leaked almost a century of
points. Morgan said that they had watched a video recording of that game
and it had been a classic case of a side not deviating from its
pre-match blueprint, and as a result the points just kept coming. That
was the formula which the Scots intended following today.
''Top priority is to gain complete control. If we get loose then that
is when they will be at their most dangerous,'' he said.
Although the Ivory Coast are very much the mystery side of the
tournament, one thing which is known about them is that, euphemistically
put, their temperament can be suspect.
Props Toussaint Djehi and Ernest Bley have scrapped their way through
some of the Ivoriennes' qualifying matches, but their Scottish
counterparts, Peter Wright and Paul Burnell -- who will play on the
loose-head for the first time since the A team game against Spain in
1992 -- reckon that the Ivoriennes will have their hands too full
elsewhere to indulge in skulduggery.
Wright said: ''In any case, certainly against the sides that I've
played against for Scotland, people tend to concentrate on the game much
more nowadays. Because the game is so fast now, if you turn to punch
somebody then by the time you get back into the game, the ball is 50
metres away and they'll probably have scored at the other end of the
park.
''If Ivory Coast do want to mix it and I'm in the front row and
they've got four or five guys laying into me, then that suits me fine.
It means that there are four or five blokes less for the other Scots
guys on the park to worry about.''
Burnell added: ''I don't think they will mix it, because I suspect
they'll be intimidated by the occasion, size of the crowd, and the TV
cameras. It will probably be the first time that they've had a
world-wide audience, so there will be other things on their mind than
mixing it with us.''
The London Scot, who was a member of the 1990 Grand Slam pack, said
that switching from right to loose-head was not something that could be
achieved without a degree of difficulty.
''Yes, players do find it difficult. It's like playing right or left
wing or being left or right-handed. But we've had some hard scrummaging
sessions and I was comfortable on the left. The big thing is to get the
initial hit right and after that, it just takes care of itself.''
Scotland field an untried back-row combination in Ian Smith, Peter
Walton, and Rob Wainwright. However, Walton reckons that they have seen
so much of each other in training over the past month or so that their
unfamiliarity as a unit should not pose problems.
The battle of the stand-off halves should provide a fascinating
vignette today at Rustenburg.
Craig Chalmers, who will set a new cap record for Scotland fly-halves,
overtaking John Rutherford's mark of 42, has played some majestic rugby
this season, and he will want to take up where he left off in the Five
Nations' Championship.
His opposite number, the Ivorienne skipper Athanase Dali, is one of
the few stars in the African side. A Paris law graduate and sometime
journalist, he is one of dozen Ivorienne squad members who play their
rugby in France.
A full-house of 31,000 is expected, the local presence being swelled
by the large number of Scots who began arriving yesterday on supporters'
package tours.
A number appeared at the team hotel on Wednesday night, a fact which
drove manager Paterson to observe that it was just as well -- at least
so far as the management were concerned -- that the Scots had not
followed the Welsh example with a ban on alcohol that would have done
the Prohibition proud.

THE Scotland women's squad will move up a division in their
preparation for the finals of the European Nations' Cup in Amsterdam in
19 days' time, when they take on Ireland and world champions Australia
in a three nations tournament, starting this afternoon at Lisburn in
Northern Ireland.
The Scots will open their four-match programme -- the teams play each
other twice -- at 1pm against Ireland. Then four hours later they go in
against the Australians in what will be a real test not just of the
players' fitness but also their level of concentration.
As the women begin to peak for their Nations' Cup, the men are about
to embark on the build-up for their finals in Dublin in August.
Team manager Alistair Tait has called up a squad of 24 for training,
but two familiar names are absent.
Paul Doney has just embarked on a new career and cannot get time off,
while Phil Webster, who missed out on the European Junior championships
last month, appears to have been overlooked. Men's squad:
A Seaton (Old Loughtonians), P Mellor (Grange), G Mutton, D Fowler, G
Moore, D Ralph, M Starling (all McMahon Kelburne), D Leiper, D Low, S
Middleton, C Wood (all Grange), R Freeland, A Milne (both Touche Ross
Gordonians), D Johnson, G Shepherd (both Torbrex Wanderers), J Mills, J
Christie (both Cannock), J Cox (Menzieshill), D Cunliffe (Havant), S
Grubb (MIM), C Hector (Old Loughtonians), R Philp (Western), A Sword
(Montrouge), M Zander (East Grinstead).

MOTORSPORT
MARK Blundell, called in at short notice to replace Nigel Mansell at
Formula One team McLaren Mercedes, escaped injury when his car hit a
barrier yesterday. But the Englishman still managed to finish eighth
fastest in the first qualifying session for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix.
''It just shows there is no margin for error on this circuit,''
Blundell said. ''I maybe gave a little bit too much throttle on cold
rear tyres and damaged the front of the car when I hit the side of the
Armco. It was a disappointing way to end the session, but there was no
serious damage.''
Blundell, only given the call-up 48 hours beforehand following
McLaren's sudden split with Mansell, has two races to prove he is worth
a long-term contract with the team.
Frenchman Jean Alesi, driving a Ferrari, once again claimed
provisional pole position with a near four-tenths of a second advantage
over Benetton's Michael Schumacher, with Gerhard Berger third in the
other Ferrari.
Damon Hill had to settle for fourth fastest going into tomorrow's
final qualifying session -- the drivers have a day off today -- while
Scot David Coulthard found the street circuit difficult to get used to
on his debut at the Principality as he finished eleventh fastest in the
other Williams, two seconds adrift of his team-mate who was nearly a
second down on Alesi.

Pretoria, Thursday
IAN Jardine will drink a toast to Michael Lynagh tonight.
We watched the Springboks and the Wallabies on television in the
team-room at our hotel, and Jardie scooped 250 rand, which in real money
is about 50 quid, when Lynagh went over for the first touchdown of the
afternoon.
Peter Walton lifted the cash for being nearest the final score, and so
yours truly will have to wait until tomorrow against the Ivory Coast
when, hopefully, my reward will come in the form of a try, or two, or
three.
South Africa played well and still managed to win despite their
lineout not being up to international standard.
The Springboks began nervously but they just kept on getting better as
the game went on. I wouldn't count Australia out, though, and I bet
there will be a backlash when they play Romania on Tuesday.
David Campese chose the opening game of the World Cup, with a global
audience of very many millions, to have one of his off days.
He was posted missing when Pieter Hendriks scored his try, but as a
fellow winger I know that, away out there in the wide open spaces, you
can be made to look a fool in the blink of an eye.
Hopefully ther will be none of that when we play the Ivory Coast. In
fact I'm certain of it.
Craig Chalmers, Damian Cronin, and me played a round of crazy golf
yesterday. I told them that I wasn't nearly crazy enough to win. And I
didn't. Del Boy did! I'm glad that the waiting is almost over and I'm
absolutely chuffed that I've been picked to play in tomorrow's game.
There were moments, as I recovered from my hamstring strain when,
privately, I had doubts, but I've come through all of the fitness tests
and I'm raring to go.
I want to get amongst the tries. Jackie Joiner on the other wing is on
a streak with a couple of hat tricks in our last two games, against
Madrid and Spain.
We're good for one another in that we constantly egg each other on.
But really I don't mind that he's edged ahead of me in the try-scoring
stakes. Much.
There is a good spirit in the squad. When you're away on tour there is
a certain amount of rivalry when the team is being picked, and there's
always going to be disappointment for those who don't get a game. But
we're lucky in Scotland that we all get on and the tensions never boil
over.
We've trained really hard since we arrived here nine days ago, and we
are as ready as we are ever going to be.
It's never easy playing against a side like Ivory Coast because they
are an unknown quantity, but if they've got to the World Cup finals then
they can't be the total mugs that most people are making them out to be.
Finally, Gavin Hastings, Craig Chalmers, Dave Hilton, and me were left
behind on Monday for physiotherapy when the rest of the boys went of to
the leisure resort of Sun City.
We went for dinner to a little place nearby the hotel. I pointed out
to Gavin that his biggest fan was on the premises. And there it was,
birlin' around on the ceiling.

<HEADLINE>Improved farm incomes mean that . . . Arable land prices soar over #2000</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH land prices are soaring on the back of vastly improved farm
incomes last year.
This is especially true in the arable sector where the limited number
of acres on the market are fetching up to and over #2000 per acre. Rents
are also moving upwards but the major story lies in the huge increase in
bids made for seasonal grazing rents.
However, according to a leading agricultural consultant many farmers
might be better employed doing their calculations before pursuing extra
acres.
Peter Pitchford of David Anderson &amp; Co said yesterday: ''I really
wonder if people are thinking these values all the way through.
Expanding is fine but the existing core business must not be put at
risk.''
The market for seasonal grazings which traditionally sees farmers take
extra acres away from home has been greatly distorted this year by the
rules governing the Extensification Scheme under which farmers receive
additional headage payment providing stocking densities are kept under
specific limits.
One individual farmer is alleged to have paid out close on #9000
taking extra grazing just to ensure that he received an almost identical
sum in extensification payments which as Mr Pitchford commented: ''Means
spending #1 to get #1.''
The rules now say for example that a farmer who keeps suckler cows is
eligible for a supplement of #28.61 over and above the existing payments
provided his overall stocking rate does not exceed 1.4 livestock units
per hectare. A similar amount is payable under the Beef Special Premium,
but that is subject to a dilution depending on the overall numbers of
cattle in Scotland qualifying for the scheme.
An indication of the increase in grazing rents was given yesterday by
a spokesman from auctioneers John Swan and Sons who let just short of
2000 acres this year to have reached #83 per acre -- up 22% on the year
with a top bid of #156 per acre. This however falls into insignificance
when compared to the record of just over #270 per acre paid for six
months grazing in the Forfar area.
One obvious reason for the rise is the tightening up of the stocking
densities which on farms outwith the Less Favoured Areas have moved from
2.5 livestock units to just 2.
Mr Pitchford remarked: ''There are animal farmers with perhaps 100
suckler cows who now find themselves in an interesting situation. The
dilemma is one of how much can they afford for extra acres against the
net income situation from subsidies. It's one that needs very careful
consideration.

IN the rehearsal room of Coronation Street this week I saw Julie
Goodyear showing off a new pair of boots, in front of fellow-stars Alma,
Rita, Liz, Maureen, Curly and Martin.
I took it to be an off-the-set comedy turn because the boots looked
far too big for her. On the other hand, there are those who believe that
Julie, alias Bet Gilroy, mine hostess at the Rovers Return, is too big
for her boots.
For months now the rumours have been flying high that the Peroxide
Princess is leaving the Street for greater things, like starring in
films. Just two days ago, as I pressed Coronation Street's producer, Sue
Pritchard, about Julie's future, she told me how difficult it is to keep
the lid on rumours affecting the cast. She said 97% of them had no
foundation anyway.
As recently as last week Julie Goodyear herself was still talking
about a new contract.
But yesterday the lid finally blew from the Bet Gilroy story and the
bosses admitted that, yes, the lady who has been voted Britain's
favourite soap opera star is indeed leaving the show later this year.
Modifying the story somewhat, Miss Goodyear said: ''This isn't
goodbye, just au revoir.''
As always, the door of the Rovers will be left open for Bet, just as
it has been for her estranged husband, Alec Gilroy, who went off to do
other things.
Ironically, on the day of Bet's announcement, Alec's grand-daughter
Victoria, the beautifully-boned Chloe Newsome, was telling me that she
is expecting the return of Grandpa Alec.
But for Bet, the bold, brassy barmaid who became licensee of the most
famous pub in Britain, it all seems to be running down, at least for a
time.
So what's behind it all? Now in her fifties but still burning with
ambition, Julie Goodyear is something of a prima donna down Coronation
Street. Whereas her character is the good-hearted but hard-bitten cynic
who presides over life at the Rovers, the real-life lady is very much
the star who doesn't exactly hide her light at glittering occasions.
After 25 years of pulling pints, the relentless routine of Coronation
Street inevitably begins to pall. The cast have their arguments, their
fall-outs, while remaining a surprisingly close-knit community.
But Julie has had enough, and last year she wanted to spread her wings
as a chat-show hostess. Granada Television acceded to her wish and tried
her out on the obligatory pilot show. But that was classed a disaster
and the project scrapped.
However, her sights are firmly set on other things, with the desire to
spend more time with her grandchildren only part of the story.
But here's the point: where does she go? Where can she be any bigger
than she is in the Street? The answer is, almost certainly, nowhere. So
type-cast as Bet Gilroy of the Rovers, who could ever see her as anyone
else?
The lesson which many a Coronation Street performer has learned is
that the Street is far bigger than any individual. People like Joanna
Lumley and Ben Kingsley had such minor parts that they could go on to
stardom elsewhere.
Arthur Lowe just managed to escape his Leonard Swindley role in time
to be credible as Captain Mainwaring in Dad's Army. Geoff Hughes got out
of Eddie Yeats in time to prosper as Onslow in Keeping Up Appearances.
Most others have disappeared without trace.
Julie Goodyear is big because Coronation Street is a thousand times
bigger. Liz McDonald could take her place. Raquel could grow into the
hostess with the mostest at the Rovers.
Coronation Street has survived greater losses -- Elsie Tanner, Ena
Sharples, Annie Walker, Hilda Ogden.
So think about it, Julie. And get back into your boots!

* THREE international discards gave England chief Ray Illingworth food
for thought with outstanding performances in the Britannic Assurance
County Championship yesterday. While Illingworth was watching the West
Indies wrap up a Texaco Trophy victory at Trent Bridge, Robin Smith,
Craig White, and John Crawley were all starring with the bat for their
respective counties.
Smith rattled 120 as Hampshire seized control of their match with
Sussex at Portsmouth. His innings contained 15 fours and his
fourth-wicket partnership of 259 with opener Paul Terry, who included 17
boundaries in his unbeaten 162, took Hampshire from 70 for two to 356
for three at the close.
At Sheffield, all-rounder White showed he has shaken off the injury
problems that curtailed his Ashes tour by rescuing Yorkshire against
leaders Northamptonshire. White hit an unbeaten 106 off 115 balls,
including one 6 and 14 fours, as the home side limped to 229 for seven
before the rain set in.
Lancashire were not having things all their own way against
Nottinghamshire at Liverpool either, despite Crawley's early defiance.
He fell one short of a half-century after sharing a 90-run third-wicket
stand with opener Steve Titchard, who hit 57 on his return to the side
in Michael Atherton's absence, but Lancashire were in a less-than-secure
position of 277 for eight at the close.

SIR RALPH ROBINS, the man who believes doomed East Kilbride workers
will have to learn to move to where a job takes them, becomes indignant
when questions are raised over his latest salary increase and his own
lifestyle.
He is a man who enjoys the good life.
As chairman of Rolls-Royce he dismisses suggestions that it is
insensitive and irresponsible for board members to award themselves
massive wage increases of up to 27% while holding down the pay of
workers on the shop floor to 2%.
Sir Ralph sees no contradiction in directors awarding themselves huge
bonuses while employees are being made redundant.
''These increases are all performance related,'' he says.
Yesterday he was in the United States for yet another top-level
meeting. He is a natural jet-setter.
Sir Ralph feels much more at home speaking with friends in Washington
than talking in Scotland to employees about redundancies.
Naturally he travelled first class to the States.
As is his custom he almost certainly spoke to the pilot about the
reliability of the aircraft's engines. If the cabin crew didn't know
before hand the chairman of Rolls-Royce was on board, he certainly made
sure they soon found out.
In so doing he no doubt believed that he had achieved yet another
great public relations coup for Rolls-Royce.
Workers who travelled by coach from East Kilbride to London in a bid
to save 600 jobs realised from the outset they were not living in the
same world as the head of the company.
When they left London for East Kilbride on the return journey, they
might have been excused for thinking that the chairman lived on a
different planet.
He had told them that they could not expect jobs to come to them, they
would have to move to where the jobs were.
After all, he boasted, he had done that throughout his working life.
Sir Ralph gets angry when it is suggested he earns half a million
pounds a year from Rolls-Royce.
He points out the latest published figures show his salary from the
company is only #406,000.
Over and above, hower, there are the perks from such earnings as
non-executive board membership of such companies as Cable &amp; Wireless,
Marks and Spencer, Schroders, and Standard Chartered.
Sir Ralph thinks his salary is only now beginning to reflect his
worth.
He groused to shareholders on Wednesday that for most of the 40 years
plus he had been with Rolls-Royce he had been paid a miserable salary.
Only a few years ago as managing director he was netting only #100,000.
Being unable to pay the right people the rate for the job was a major
problem facing the company now, Sir Ralph said. That would have to
change. However, he also made it clear that the changes would begin in
the boardroom.
Sir Ralph believes Rolls-Royce has retained its reputation as a world
leader only by retaining staff who have remained faithful. It is a major
problem at the highest levels.
However, he does not seem to see this might be in contradiction to the
current policy of the company of discarding those who have served well
below stairs.
Already Sir Ralph has shut down seven plants and has discarded
one-third of the company's employees.
Following the Rolls-Royce redundancy programme there are not many who
have now served longer than him.
One of those who knew Sir Ralph well when he began his career with
Rolls-Royce declared: ''He understands markets, but he hasn't a clue
about people.''
It was a Scot who lives in England who came to this conclusion. ''The
years have gone by and he has made his way up the ladder, but I have not
changed my mind,'' he added.
Sir Ralph joined Rolls-Royce as a graduate trainee in 1955. He was
destined to be a high-flyer.
That was one of the few facts Rolls-Royce public relations department
was prepared to pass on to The Herald last night.
''Previous aricles in the newspaper suggest this might not be a
helpful piece,'' I was told.
Claims by Sir Ralph that he has been forced to move house throughout
his career just don't seem to ring true. He does have a London property,
but his family home is at Duffield, just outside Derby, where he has
always maintained a base.
It is not a mansion, but nevertheless it is substantial property, I
was told.

MEREDITH McGrath and Larisa Neiland, favourites for this week's
Women's Doubles Cup at Craiglockhart, had to come from behind in both
sets before recording a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Maria Lindstrom and Maria
Strandlund in yesterday's quarter-final.
The 25-year-old American and her Latvian partner have only been
playing together since February, but showed enough intuitive
understanding to suggest they will be contenders at next week's French
Open in Paris.
Play was delayed for an hour after a heavy downpour flooded the clay
court and it was the Swedes who made the better start. But McGrath and
Neiland survived break points in both the second and sixth games and
reeled off five successive games from 2-1 down to pocket the first set.
Lindstrom and Strandlund struck back immediately and established a 4-1
lead, but they failed to convert game point in the seventh and eighth as
the top seeds again clawed back to win the next five games to secure
their place in the last four.
Zina Garrison-Jackson and Katrina Adams served notice of their
intentions with a 6-3, 6-4 defeat of fellow Americans Linda Harvey-Wild
and Debbie Graham. Other results:
Legends Tournament: J Lloyd (GB) and T Austin (USA) beat J Creik (USA)
and V Wade (GB) 6-4 (one set); R Emerson (Australia) and J Durie (GB)
beat R Taylor (GB) and W Turnbull (Australia) 6-2, 2-6, 7-3.

JAMES Girolami -- and none of your Jimmy, please -- has given up the
pleasures of playing amateur football to concentrate more on cricket. He
has been doing both for around 12 years, but now his commitment to
having a ball hit stumps rather than hitting a ball is really paying
off.
Forfarshire are reaping the benefit in the Caley 80/- Counties League,
with Girolami's figures in the three games played so far making the
impressive reading of four for 29, five for 46, and three for 19.
The left-arm medium pacer -- ''it allows me to slant the ball across
right-handed batsmen'' -- admits with a smile: ''Yes, I have an Italian
name, but I was born in Broughty Ferry.''
Tomorrow, Fifeshire had better beware having an Italian-Tayside job
done on them at Forthill. And, of course, they have the considerable
back-up of Bryce Robertson, who took six wickets at Stirling last week.
Stirling's defeat left Ayrshire and champions Strathmore County joint
top, and as so often happens in such a situation, the two are destined
to meet immediately at Prestwick Oval.

SCOTLAND made their way home yesterday from the Kirin Cup in Japan
after their matches against the host nation and Ecuador, but it may be a
little while before the true worth of the exercise becomes evident.
Craig Brown will assess the fitness of various more established
members of his team who were not in Japan before naming his squad today
for the European Championship qualifying match against the Faroe Islands
next month.
Despite his spectacular debut goal against Ecuador on Wednesday,
Stephen Crawford, of Raith Rovers, will not feature unless something
untoward happens to one of the more experienced strikers.
In the case of Scot Gemmill, however, Brown must be sorely tempted to
include him after the Nottingham Forest midfield player produced
excellent performances in Hiroshima and Toyama.
He had looked sharp in the first game against Japan although the
effects of the long journey caused him to be substituted before the end
and he followed that up with another distinguished performance in the
victory over Ecuador.
His father played for Scotland on 43 occasions and the players in the
present squad refer to Gemmill junior as ''Archie,'' but the man who has
just played twice for the full international team is not keen to make
comparisons.
''My dad was pleased for me that I made my debut in this event just
the way any of the other lads fathers were, not because of the fact that
he had also played for Scotland,'' said Gemmill.
''No-one has a god given right to think that they are bound to play
international football. The breaks sometimes take longer than expected
and sometimes they happen sooner.''
It is believed that Celtic captain Paul McStay may require surgery to
cure his recent ankle injury after tomorrow's Scottish Cup final. With
Stuart McCall, of Rangers, also likely to need an operation this summer
an extra midfielder will almost certainly be required for the Faroes and
Gemmill may well fit the bill.
* HUNTLY have escaped prosecution after a crowd barrier collapsed
injuring two Dundee United fans at a Scottish Cup tie at Chistie Park in
February.
But the Highland League club has been given an official rap for
exceeding the agreed safe spectator limit for the match on February 18
this year.
A report by Gordon District Council ruled out legal action against the
Christie Park outfit, which sold 279 tickets above the 1921 agreed for
the ''away'' support.

A MEMBER of the new Dumfries and Galloway Council has been charged
with failing to give police breath specimens. Mr Thomas Alexander
Sproat, the SNP member for Tarff, appeared on three charges including
failing to give police a breath specimen on the B727 Dalbeattie to
Gatehouse of Fleet road on May 20.
Mr Sproat, 63, is also charged with failing to provide two specimens
of breath at Castle Douglas police station on the same day. A third
charge alleges that he drove at 44mph on the A755, 14mph over the limit.
Mother held
THE mother of six-year-old Rikki Neave was yesterday remanded in
custody for seven days, charged with murdering her son last November.
Mrs Ruth Neave, 26, spoke only three times to confirm her name, age, and
address in a 10-minute appearance before magistrates in Peterborough.
Rikki's naked body was found on scrubland 500yds from his home. He had
been strangled.
Water scheme
HIGHLAND Regional Council has chosen four companies to bid for what is
believed to be the Scottish water industry's first Build, Own, and
Operate (BOO) scheme. The #45m contract involves building an #11m sewage
plant at Caol Spit, Fort William, by late 1998 and a #34m plant for
Inverness by the year 2000. Laqua Services Ltd; Morrison/North West
Water/Bechtel Consortium; Scottish Environmental Services; and the
Wimpey-Saur/Stereau Group have been chosen.
Lucky village
PLOCKTON, the Wester Ross village of which hit the tourism jackpot
after being selected by BBC chiefs as Lochdubh, fictional home of
maverick TV cop Hamish Macbeth, has done it again. The villagers have
been given #62,500 National Lottery funding to do up their hall.
Violent Grampian
TWO hundred incidents of family violence were reported by Grampian
social workers in less than six months, a report revealed yesterday. The
200 cases were described as an ''underestimate of the incidence of
family violence in the region'', which comes in three main categories --
child abuse, partner abuse, and violence towards other vulnerable
adults, such as the elderly.
Tachograph fine
A FIRM which admitted two motoring offences was fined #5000 yesterday
by Berwick magistrates. Eyemouth Fisherman's Mutual Association pleaded
guilty to failing to produce tachograph records and operating a vehicle
with a tachograph which had not had a compulsory six-year check. The
offences were discovered after a fish lorry was stopped by vehicle
examiners and it was found the tachograph was not connected.
Tackle taken
RAIDERS have stolen more than #1200 worth of fishing equipment from a
fishermen's hut on the banks of the Tweed at Gattonside, near Melrose.

AAMIR Hanif and Sajid Ali have a few things in common. For starters,
they both hail from Karachi, though, currently, they share a flat on the
south side of Glasgow. And on Saturdays, they regularly dement
opposition bowling attacks.
Tomorrow at Titwood, Aamir and Sajid come face to face -- on the
cricket pitch as opposed to over the breakfast table -- when Clydesdale
meet Poloc in the D M Hall Western Union.
And, if the confrontation between these two master batsmen wasn't
enough, it just so happens that their respective clubs sit at numbers
one and two in the Union table.
The season is only five weeks old, but according to Sajid, this match
could have a considerable bearing on the championship.
''Only Kelburne have started as well as Poloc and Clydesdale,'' said
Sajid, already with 100 and two 50s in championship games.
''Going by what I've seen so far, Saturday's match at Titwood is
between the two best sides in the league. And even though we are still
very early in the season, the result could be very important as regard
to who wins the title.''
Tomorrow is derby day in the Western Union calendar, with an
enthralling joust in prospect at Meikleriggs where Ferguslie play host
to Paisley rivals, Kelburne, currently unbeaten this term.
Greenock, too, are also undefeated, and they visit West of Scotland,
while Ayr await the visit of Kilmarnock.
The title of the best club in Lanarkshire will be settled at Bothwell
Castle policies when Uddingston take on Drumpellier.

into the room of Dr Tzako Pantaleev, deputy director in the ministry of

A police spokesman said the sum stolen was the equivalent of six

APPROPRIATELY on the eve of the Volvo PGA Championship the title
sponsor yesterday killed off persistent murmurings that it was about to
end its involvement with the PGA European Tour, worth #30m over the last
eight years, by announcing an extension worth #20m up to the gate of the
millennium.
Volvo will continue this championship and the Masters, Scandinavian
Masters, and German Open. It also will maintain the order of merit and
bonus pool awards, its courtesy car programme, and its package of
television broadcasts. However, its overall sponsorship will cease of
the PGA European Tour, whose title will revert to its own name.
Ken Schofield, the tour's executive director, took the opportunity at
Wentworth to disclose that he had had meetings with the tour's leading
players -- Nick Faldo, Severiano Ballesteros, Jose Maria Olazabal, Ian
Woosnam, Bernhard Langer, and Colin Montgomerie -- who want better
quality courses particularly, but not exclusively, for early-season
tournaments.
''The tour is taking account of their views,'' Schofield insisted.
''They are being listened to. What is hurting to me is if there is a
feeling that we have forgotten quality for quantity. In fact, we are
trying to match them.''
Today the politics of dissent will be put aside when the field of 150,
including 15 Scots, will begin its assault on the north face of a
#900,000 prize fund, to be #1m next year. The winner on Monday will win
#150,000, preferably after a climax as stirring as that of 12 months
ago.
Then Olazabal, the reigning Masters' champion, achieved a golfing
''spring double'' previously gained by Ballesteros, Faldo, and Langer
when he beat Ernie Els by a stroke, having led for the first time with a
birdie at the seventy-first hole. The South African is now committed to
the US Tour, but a strong taskforce has assembled.
It includes the last 10 winners of the title and Montgomerie, who has
been second three times, the Fijian Vijay Singh, one of only two double
winners in America so far this season, David Feherty, who has been
struggling there, and Jesper Parnevik, runner-up in last year's Open
Championship, have returned to make a rare appearance -- as, of course,
has Faldo.
Faldo has won the title a record four times.
Among the Scots are the new professional champion, Colin Gillies, and
Sam Torrance, who had treatment yesterday at the tour's physiotherapy
unit on an injured right wrist.
* DEFENDING champion Nick Price plunged nine strokes from the lead
after the opening round at the $1.4m Colonial Invitation at Fort Worth,
Texas, yesterday.
Price, the Open and US PGA champion, looked rusty after a three-week
break as he carded three-over-par 73 in benign conditions at Colonial
Country Club.
Americans Lennie Clements and Clark Dennis took advantage of their
early tee times to share the lead at six-under 64. Leading scores
(Americans unless stated):
64 -- L Clements, C Dennis.
65 -- B Andrade.
66 -- D A Weibring, F Zoeller, P Stewart, C Parry (Australia), M
Hulbert, J Maggert, C Strange.
* SCOTLAND'S Catriona Matthew shot a two-under-par 70 yesterday in the
first round of the Corning Classic at Corning Country Club, New York, to
be three off the pace set by Americans Pat Bradley and and Loretta
Alderete.
Suzanne Strudwick was the best-placed Briton on 69. Also on 70 were
England's Alison Nicholas and Sweden's Annika Sorenstam. Other Scottish
scores were Pam Wright (72) and Kathryn Marshall (76).
* DEESIDE'S Peter Smith earned himself a cheque of almost #900
yesterday after firing a three-under-par 68 across the 6243-yard
Lochwinnoch course in the club's pro-am. Leading scores:
68 -- P Smith (Deeside). 69 -- F Mann (Musselburgh), E McIntosh (Braid
Hills). 70 -- R Weir (Cowal). 71 -- I Young (Braid Hills), C Ronald
(East Kilbride). 72 -- G Coyle (Gleddoch), J McTear (Cowglen), S Kerr
(Renfrew), D Gemmill (Ayr Belleisle), S Stephen (Braid Hills), C Elliot
(Dubai Creek).
* ALEX Boatman is the surprise package of the English Women's Amateur
championship at Ipswich. The four-handicapper from Royal Worlington
yesterday set up a quarter-final clash with fellow Suffolk county player
and defending champion Julie Hall this morning.
Boatman's mother Liz, the former Curtis Cup captain, is this week
caddieing for her 23-year-old daughter. Stirling University's Elaine
Ratcliffe also reached the last eight.

* FALKLAND'S first match in the first division of the Ryden East
League was a complete fiasco, writes Frank Moran. One seasoned observer
reckoned that theirs was the worst batting that he had ever seen, but
suggested in mitigation that the sense of occasion and the fact that
they were on alien territory had got to the players.
This shrewd judgment has been borne out by their subsequent
performances, which have extended the opposition more than might have
been expected. Nevertheless, they bear the perennial burden of the
underdog.
Certainly, Carlton will travel there tomorrow determined to bring back
the spoils from a fourth successive victory as ballast for tougher
matches to come. At this early stage they have emerged as likeliest
challengers to leaders Heriot's, who will be only a few miles away at
Freuchie.
Grange entertain neighbours Edinburgh Academicals determined to get
back on track after the unexpected setback at Myreside. Their
conquerors, Watsonians, are at Corstorphine, while Stenhousemuir have an
appointment with Royal High at Barnton.

* FORMER Ryder Cup player Tommy Horton yesterday won the inaugural
#25,000 Ben Sayers/ProQuip Senior Club Professional championship, writes
Scott Crockett.
The Royal Jersey pro carded a three-under-par final-round 67 for a
five-under total of 205 to beat Lincolnshire pro Terry Squires by three
strokes, with Scot Jim McAlister a further two shots adrift in third.
Horton had birdies at the first and fourth, but escaped with pars
after a shank at the sixth and two bunker shots at the eighth. At the
eighth his fifth single putt in eight holes gave him a birdie 4. A
steadier back nine of level-par 35 helped him coast to victory. Leading
aggregates:
205 -- T Horton (Royal Jersey) 66, 72, 67 (#3500).
208 -- T Squires (Boston) 68, 72, 68 (#2250).
210 -- J McAlister (Haggs Castle) 71, 68, 71 (#1500).
211 -- B Huggett (unattached) 70, 73, 68; D Butler (Coombe Wood) 70,
68, 73 (#1175 each).

ONE of the sticking points, it is said, when BBC TV were negotiating
with the European Tour about the Scottish Open and other events was the
rather cavalier treatment the golf body felt was shown at times to their
competitions.
The sudden dart to a horse race, or the cricket, or the snooker, when
the golf was developing into its fascinating best, annoyed those close
to the sport. In contrast, Sky TV's ability to stay with an event from
start to finish, to record every blow along the way, naturally appealed
to those negotiating on behalf of the game.
The bottom line, of course, was the figure on the right of the pound
sign, but it would be unfair to suggest that the treatment of their
favourite sport did not play at least a part in deciding what way they
would swing.
It is the memory of that scenario which ended with the Tour opting for
the satellite coverage that returned this week when a racing buddy, a
committed fan of the Turf, gave me chapter and verse of his
dissatisfaction with BBC Scotland last Sunday when, it seems, that the
decision was taken to scrap the anticipated 5.0 race at Newbury as the
Tartan Special Scottish PGA Championship was reaching its late stages.
The race, over two miles, took about three-and-a-half minutes to run,
about the same time as it would have taken the golfers to walk from the
fourteenth tee, where my informant claims they were at the time, to
their tee-shots and it does seem a strange arbitrary decision to take
when there is not an urgency about the situation.
As a real lover of both sports, I would have been eager to see the
Newbury racing and the golf (as it was, I was off working at one of
those other games people play) and, albeit hearing of this second hand,
can't support the dismissive treatment of racing supporters. The fact is
that there would be a sizeable percentage of the viewers enjoying their
afternoon entertainment who would be interested in both events and, if
it is advertised by the Beeb that they will cover three races, they
should do so, even if it entails a recording to show a little later.
It is this kind of decision on the run, admittedly a necessary and
tricky business for sports programme leaders, which has to be handled
carefully if minority groups are to be properly catered for.
My irate chum had already claimed to show immense tolerance with the
treatment of the 4.30 race, when the cameras switched to the racing as
the runners were already in the stalls. No show of betting, no
discussion, no information, just wham-bam-thankyou and back to the golf.
It is that attitude towards the Turf business that has spawned so many
fans of Channel Four's comprehensive coverage, where there is a more
relaxed, appreciative attention given to a sport that attracts
supporters from across a wide spectrum of the population.
The most annoying aspect of Sunday's occurrence is that it was hardly
necessary and was bound to alienate at least a small proportion of the
watchers.
* RARELY does anyone involved in football, with all its ridiculous
extremes of emotion, come close to achieving any true perspective of the
game's place in the universe, but Tony Mowbray, Celtic's central
defender, is unquestionably one of them.
Listening to the man born in Saltburn talk this week in quiet, simple,
but immensely moving language about the life and death of the love of
his life, Bernadette, his wife who died on New Year's Day, it was easy
to believe that football, its cup finals, its relegation, its
championships et al, is second division material in the real world.
Mowbray described his decision to write a book about his short life
with Bernadette as his way of bringing awareness to the outside world of
the need to help the cause of those who research, treat, and care for
cancer patients.
His courage in tackling the task so soon will surely bring in funds
for the cancer charity, the Beatson Oncology Centre, which already has
collected #10,000 from fans in memory of Bernadette.
When he says, without any dramatic inflection, that Bernadette is with
him all the time, it is clear that this is one footballer who would
disagree vehemently with Bill Shankly's declaration that football is
more important than life and death.

TEXACO TROPHY
MIKE Atherton is straight back in the old routine -- urging his
England team to punch their weight.
After holding numerous crisis talks during last winter's disastrous
Ashes tour, Atherton spent an hour inside the Trent Bridge dressing-room
yesterday following West Indies' five-wicket Texaco Trophy victory.
He emerged to deny suggestions of a full-blown inquest, insisting:
''It was nothing formal -- just informal chats. The dressing-room is the
place to be at the end of a game.''
But knowing from bitter experience in Australia how one below-par
display can lead to many more, England's captain will have demanded a
better showing at The Oval today and Lord's on Sunday.
''I would like to see an improved performance all round for the last
two games,'' said Atherton.
But for a moment of carelessness by Brian Lara -- and Atherton's
excellent catch -- England might have equalled their heaviest one-day
international defeat in wicket terms.
A late fightback limited the damage but could not disguise the fact
that West Indies won this summer's opening skirmish with plenty to
spare.
England's total of 199 for nine was at least 30 runs short, even given
that they batted when conditions were far from straightforward on
Wednesday.
And they never seriously threatened to make life difficult for Lara
and Sherwin Campbell yesterday morning as the pair took the tourists to
within 20 runs of victory with a stand of 114.
At 180 for one, England looked set to be beaten by nine wickets for
only the third time in 232 one-day internationals.
But then Lara, having struck seven 4s plus an effortless straight 6
off Shaun Udal on his way to 70, hoisted Darren Gough towards mid-on.
Atherton held a skier which fell over his left shoulder as he ran
towards the boundary -- and England had saved themselves a little
embarrassment.
To Gough's great delight, former Yorkshire team-mate Richie Richardson
-- the man he says gave him huge encouragement at Headingley -- then
drove straight to cover to continue a sequence of early tour failures,
before Jimmy Adams fell lbw to Dominic Cork.
And when Campbell was run out for 80, trying to pinch a second to Udal
at long leg, the margin in defeat looked almost respectable.
Richardson, with 23 runs from five serious innings this summer, and
Atherton knew better, however.
''I think our win was more comprehensive than five wickets and 14
balls to spare,'' said the West Indian skipper who had underlined his
team's confidence by discarding that newly acquired helmet and batting
in his trademark floppy hat.

IF his immense determination on the field has been long recognised,
Peter Grant has given an even more astonishing illustration of that
willpower by recovering from an injury that would have ended 98% of
players' chances of taking part in the Tennents Scottish Cup final
tomorrow.
The long-serving midfield man has amazed even his Celtic manager,
Tommy Burns, by the progress he has made since he suffered a serious
knee twist against Dundee United in the last premier-division match of
the season.
The rehabilitation has been so impressive that Grant now looks a
probable starter for the game with Airdrie, and would thus make amends
for missing the Coca-Cola Cup final last November and, maybe even more
galling, the Scottish final in 1989, the last time Celtic won a trophy.
''Peter looks great,'' said Burns, ''and in the last couple of days
has been joining in the games and taking part in all the training. I am
pleased with that. It is a real boost to us. To have someone with his
passion and commitment to the club looking as if he will make it now is
a great lift.''
Grant's availability would be all the more important if his team-mate,
Brian O'Neil, fails to recover from his injury in time. O'Neil also
twisted his knee in training on Monday and, according to the manager, is
slight odds against being ready to play by tomorrow.
If he is out, it would be a great disappointment for the man who has
become one of the country's most efficient and skilful centre backs.
Although Tony Mowbray cannot be considered as he is suspended, Burns
said that, even if he lost O'Neil, he has options, among them Rudi Vata,
who can switch to that area, and Mark McNally.
Burns was in remarkably relaxed mood, sharing quips with the press
gang, and certainly exuded an air of confidence. ''The adrenalin is
beginning to flow as we get nearer the game,'' he said, ''and the lads
know this is a big stage, with people all over the world able to watch
it.''
He then took his team off to Seamill, not so far away from the
Ayrshire base of Airdrie, who are relaxing at Troon. Their manager, Alex
MacDonald, is keeping his fingers crossed that the team he has chosen
avoids any late problems.
''All is well so far and I know the side I want to play, but I may not
tell the players until the day of the game,'' he said. ''I know that
some who have worked so hard for us in the past couple of weeks will be
disappointed if they are left out but I want to say that, whoever plays,
this has been a squad effort and I couldn't be more pleased with them.''
Meantime, Raith Rovers goalkeeper Scott Thomson, hero of the Fife
club's Coca-Cola Cup win over Celtic earlier in the season, handed out a
piece of advice to Airdrie -- high jinks and high balls could be the
recipe for Scottish Cup success.
Thomson was the penalty shoot-out hero who saved Paul McStay's kick
and handed Rovers the Coca-Cola Cup after a 2-2 draw at Ibrox in
November, and he reckons there's every chance Airdrie can complete a
first division cup double over the Parkhead men.
He said: ''Having a joke before the game and keeping everything
relaxed made all the difference to our cup final build-up. We had guys
such as Gordon Dalziel and David Sinclair, who kept everyone laughing
and helped keep the nerves at bay.
''Airdrie have more than a few characters themselves, John Martin for
example.
''And once they're out on the park, Airdrie's aerial ability could
cause Celtic real problems. With Steve Cooper and Andy Smith up front,
good service from set plays is Airdrie's best chance of grabbing a goal.
Meantime, both sides yesterday named their squads for the final:
Celtic -- Bonner, Marshall, Vata, McNally, Boyd, O'Neil, McKinlay,
O'Donnell, McStay, Grant, Collins, Walker, Falconer, van Hooydonk,
Donnelly, McLaughlin, Gray.
Airdrie -- Martin, McCulloch, Stewart, Jack, Sandison, Hay, Boyle,
Black, Harvey, A Smith, Cooper, Lawrence, T Smith, J McIntyre, T
McIntyre, Wilson.

Ross Finlay meets a newcomer with a rugged style
THE most important thing about the SsangYong Musso is not that it is
the only full-size Korean 4x4 estate on this market. Far more
significant is that SsangYong has come into private cars with an
original design, not the usual Korean first-attempt derivative.
Almost unheard-of here until introduced by IM Group, which also
imports Subarus and Isuzus, SsangYong has more than 40 years of
experience in the motor industry. Its trucks and military vehicles are
sold all over Asia, and the motor division is part of yet another of
those huge Korean business conglomerates. This one has an annual
turnover of around #10bn from vehicles, oil refining and the production
of cement.
One feature ensuring that the Musso cannot be given the brush-off is
its Mercedes diesel engine. Mercedes owns five per cent of SsangYong
shares, and is likely to quadruple that, to give itself a strong
position in the potentially huge Asian market.
There are several Mercedes experts on secondment to SsangYong Motor
Company. While the Musso comes originally with an -- it has to be said
fairly feeble -- 2.9-litre five-cylinder diesel, a much more lusty
3.2-litre 24-valve six will be among the engine options available next
year.
Whereas the Germans are there in a squad, one single British designer
has given the Musso its highly individual but extremely practical body
style. Ken Greenley is not only the Transportation Design course
director at the Royal College of Art. His own portfolio includes designs
for the Panther Solo as well as work for Rolls-Royce, Land Rover and
Aston Martin.
When the British Panther company faded out, SsangYong bought it over
in what seemed at the time to be a rather weird business move. Now we
see the result of that first contact.
The Musso is a sizable vehicle, deliberately designed to look like a
4x4 low down and an estate car higher up. Perhaps a little over-styled
in some details, it is an imposing car in the metal. The interior is
very roomy, not just in the passenger cabin, but also in the immense
rear luggage area.
Bearing in mind that this is a new design, and not one of the
re-hashes which are all too common in the 4x4 market, the standard model
at #15,999, the mid-range SE at #17,498 and the top-whack GSE at #20,999
are keenly priced and well equipped. The security systems are
comprehensive, the transmission is also from Mercedes, and it is unusual
to find, on the two top models at any rate, a 4x4 with polished
wood-effect door and fascia cappings.
A short introductory drive showed that the Musso is mechanically
refined for a diesel 4x4, with a good standard of tarmac-road ride and
an easy way with a woodland off-road course laid out near Dunkeld. The
driving position is excellent, body roll substantial but well-enough
controlled, and the whole vehicle has a sophisticated approach away in
advance of many of its rivals.
The curious thing is that, although it is a fine relaxed cruiser, the
Mercedes-engined Musso is painfully slow off its mark. A time of almost
20 seconds for the manual transmission version to reach 60mph is poor,
and the automatic seems to take about a fortnight. Fuel consumption
figures for the manual are 35mpg at 56mph, 22 at 75 and 24mpg around
town.
Performance apart, here is an impressive new entrant in the 4x4
leisure vehicle market. At Dunkeld this week, representatives of the
British importers and the Koreans' export department, and Ken Greenley
himself, all seemed businesslike, enthusiastic, and well on course to
build up substantial sales here.
The importers admit that they have already made one mistake. They
expected the mid-range SE to be the best seller, but their pricing
structure has attracted far more customers than anticipated to the GSE.
When you see a list of UK-market 4x4 prices, and where the SsangYongs
come on it, that is no surprise.

PERTH-based Stagecoach Holdings yesterday proclaimed itself the first
UK operator to enter the local bus market in Continental Europe.
Stagecoach, which has recently been ordered by the Government to sell
20% stakes in Strathclyde Buses and the South Yorkshire-based Mainline
Partnership, is moving into Portugal.
The UK's largest bus company yesterday announced a joint venture with
London-based Montagu Private Equity, with the pair purchasing about 22%
of the newly-privatised Rodoviaria de Lisboa for #6.3m.
Stagecoach and Montagu, part of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation, will together provide equity funding of #2.5m in cash, with
the balance financed through local currency borrowings.
Their joint venture company is taking over the running of 150 buses
which operate in the northern suburbs of Lisbon and serve Cascais,
Estoril, and Sintra. About 260 staff are currently employed on the
routes.
Unlike the UK market, the Portuguese one is still regulated and the
deal is dependent upon approval for the transfer of route licences from
Rodoviaria de Lisboa.
The portion of the Portuguese company which is being acquired has a
turnover of about #8m and net assets of about #5m. Stagecoach has the
option to purchase its venture capital partner's stake in due course.
One in seven of Stagecoach's 7000 buses already serve overseas
markets. The company runs 300 vehicles in New Zealand and another 700 in
Kenya and Malawi.
With its eye on China after the hand-over by the UK Government of Hong
Kong in 1997, Stagecoach is establishing its credentials with a fleet of
11 buses in the colony.
The latest move could be seen by some as a vindication of some
analysts' views -- expressed after the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission's ruling on Strathclyde Buses -- that the recent rash of
takeovers in the UK by Stagecoach had ground to a halt.
However, the Perth-based company said yesterday that it had been
looking at Portugal for about two years.
Company secretary Keith Cochrane said: ''We have always said we still
feel there are opportunities within the UK but, at the same time, we
recognise there are opportunities to grow in Europe and other parts of
the world.''
Stagecoach is keeping its eye on other possibilities on the Continent
but the franchising route which some European countries are following is
unlikely to be quite as appealing to Stagecoach as privatisation
situations which allow it to use its UK experience.
Executive chairman Brian Souter said: ''The Portuguese market is
particularly attractive to us as its bus services operate without any
government subsidy, in a similar environment to the UK.''
Shares in Stagecoach were unmoved at 214p.

CUSTOMER confidence remains fragile and is unlikely to improve while
consumers worry about possible rises in interest rates, stores group
House of Fraser told shareholders yesterday.
Chairman Brian McGowan told the annual meeting sales during the first
year as an independent public company had been erratic. ''Customer
confidence appeared to strengthen at several times during the year only
to quickly disappear.
''Current trading is extremely competitive with customer confidence
remaining fragile.''
The group was determined to press ahead with new store openings. It
recently announced plans to open a store in Swindon in October next year
and has agreed two more -- at the new Bluewater out-of-town development
in Kent and in Nottingham.

HIGHER than expected profits at Storehouse, the BhS and Mothercare
chain, provided a welcome boost to the retail sector which was depressed
by last week's profit warning from WH Smith and lower than expected
annual profits from Marks &amp; Spencer.
In the year ended 1 April, 1995, Storehouse reported a 46% increase in
pre-tax profits to #91.2m. Sales rose by 5% to just above #1000m and
margins improved by nearly 1%, benefiting from fewer markdowns and other
discounts. Costs were held for the third consecutive year. Both
businesses did well.
Commenting on the results, Group chief executive Keith Edelman said
that they were ''very encouraging'' against a background of a tough and
competitive market. In spite of a good Christmas, second half sales at
BhS were affected by the decision to reduce the level of markdowns and
tighten the rules of the Choice Card loyalty discount scheme.
Although sales growth was stunted at BhS on an underlying basis this
was more than covered by improved margins of over half a percentage
point for the year as a whole. Profits rose by 25% to #70.2m. The best
performing divisions were home and children's clothing.
Two new catering concepts, Coffee House and Sandwich Store were
introduced with encouraging results. New store openings in the year
included Stirling. The sales picture going forward looks more
encouraging.
Mothercare traded well throughout the year with strong underlying
sales growth, higher gross margins and sharply increased operating
profit of #17.1m against #10.2m previously. Overseas sales in its
franchise outlets were also good.
By the end of the year, more than a third of the chain had been
refurbished which helped to boost sales particularly in the up to
two-year-old market, where Mothercare regained leadership.
The Blazer menswear business made a profit of #300,000 compared with a
break-even position last year. This was due to lower costs and a higher
gross margin. Sales were just 1% ahead at #14.4m. Although viewed as
non-core, Storehouse is investing in the business. Two concessions were
opened in department stores last year and in April its first airport
store opened at Gatwick. Three new stores are scheduled to open this
year.
Group earnings per share (eps) improved to 14.9p, an increase of 54%
on last year's eps of 9.7p. There is a 20% rise in the final dividend to
3.6p a share making a total for the year of 6.3p, up 15%. Dividend cover
is 2.4 times. The balance sheet is strong with net cash at the year-end
of #74.6m.
Helped by the timing of Easter, trading in the first few weeks of the
current year is said to be satisfactory. New stores are being opened in
each division over the next 12 months with the creation of at least 1000
new jobs.
Unfortunately none of the new store openings are in Scotland. BhS
plans to open eight new stores and Mothercare a further seven. The BhS
stores in Glasgow's St Enoch centre and Edinburgh are being refurbished
with the addition of extra selling space.
The good profits news and optimistic trading statement prompted
analysts to upgrade their profit forecasts for 1995/96. Emma Burdett at
ABN-Amro Hoare Govett raised her forecast by #3m to #110m.
Hoare Govett are also buyers of the shares which jumped 20[1/2]p to
263[1/2]p where they yield just under 3%. The shares are thought to have
the potential to move up to 300p.

GLENMORANGIE distiller Macdonald Martin is shaping up to be one of the
highest growth companies in the drinks sector with the new management
looking to build up volume sales, particularly in India and China where
Scotch consumption is expected to grow by 10 fold by the end of the
decade.
In India, a ratio of about 5%-10% of Glenmorangie single malt will be
used to improve the quality of locally produced whisky and will be
distributed through the Mohan Meakin trading house partner.
Expansion will be based on the cash flow from the domestic market
where Glenmorangie is the money spinner and responsible for over half
the group's #5.71m pre-tax profits last year. That was an increase on
15% on 1993-94 and was achieved on a 20% rise in overall turnover to
#35.4m.
Profitability was held back by a #1.5m rise in the advertising and
promotional spend to #5m and about #1m of exceptional charges including
#300,000 to former managing director Neil McKerrow.
There was also a #225,000 loss on the start-up costs of the Indian
joint venture.
Asian markets seem to prefer blended scotch and Macdonald Martin's
chairman Geoffrey Maddrell is aiming to wean them on to the higher
margin malts, initially under the Martin's labels.
The core Glenmorangie brand with sales of 56,000 12 bottle cases is
the leader in the Scottish market with 15% share, second in Great
Britain at 13% and is third in the global premium malt sector.
Its performance was quite remarkable with UK sales up 33% in value to
#14m and 24% by volume while exports rose 18%. It is being augmented
increasingly by Glen Moray malt and by Bailie Nicol Jarvie, which is
positioning itself at the top of the premium standard blends above
Famous Grouse, Bell's 8 Year Old and Teacher's.
Innovation is very much the theme with several brands being
revitalised as well as new products such as Glenmorangie Port Wood
finish where the whisky is matured for two years in port butts after the
convential sherry cask ageing. The end result is a Scotch which retails
at #32 a bottle and which will sell about 2500 cases this year which
will be a useful addition to overall revenue.
While malts, own label products for Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury, and
Waitrose were buoyant, broking was difficult with both Whyte &amp; Mackay,
including Invergordon, and William Grant aggressively pitching for
market share which is holding back price increases.
That is despite overall industry stocks now having dropped to just 6.4
years consumption compared with 8.6 years at their peak.
Thanks to substantial distilling contracts, group operating capcity at
the two distilleries has shot up from 44% to u80% which is the highest
in the industry.
Investment totalling #9m is being made including the #4.25m purchase
of a former Bell's warehousing centre at Broxburn next to Edinburgh
Airport and expenditure in bottling capacity which could lead to
contract bottling in due course.
The present headquarters in Leith should be sold at above its #1m book
value -- not that finance is a problem with gearing at the year end of
just 17%. Because of the family control of the two tier share structure,
there will be no-rights issue.
Much more marketing oriented than hitherto, Macdonald Martin is an
attractive medium-term investment where the results on a two-year view
should more than pay for its keep.
Current year profits should reach #6.8m and move well beyond #8m in
1996-97. The ''A'' shares rose 22p to 675p where they trade at a forward
looking 19 times earnings and 15 times those for the year after.
The dividend total has been raised 10% to 10.65p on the ''A'' shares
for a 2% yield.

FURTHER data that should allow the Chancellor to avoid any interest
rate hike when he has his regular monthly meeting with the Governor of
the Bank of England on June 7 comes with the findings of the CBI's
Monthly Trends Enquiry for May.
This shows the outlook for factory gate price inflation is more
encouraging than at any time this year.
April's sharp drop in manufacturers' price expectations has been
mirrored in May with the proportion of firms planning price rises
standing a plus 19%, just 1% above the level recorded in April and well
below the average of 30% seen in the first three months of the year.
While this still means that more firms expect to increase prices than
to reduce them over the next four months, six companies in every 10
predict that prices will remain unchanged over the period.
However, while the survey's findings, which followed a slowdown in
first quarter GDP -- also regarded as encouraging for interest rates --
would seem to back the Chancellor's stand, the CBI still believes that
in the longer term rates will have to rise.
It reckons that rising raw material prices will feed through the price
chain to the High Street and that rates will have to rise by another 1%
before the end of the year.
This would help bring an expected rise in underlying inflation,
excluding mortgage interest payments, back down to close to 2.5%, the
Government's target, in 1996. The CBI's chief economic adviser Kate
Barker suggested yesterday that the next rise in base rates from their
present 6.75% level could be ''delayed a little''.
UK manufacturers reported a further improvement in overall demand in
the May survey. Order books, on balance, have now been above normal for
nine of the last 10 months.
Demand from overseas continues to be strong. In May, export order
books remained above normal with a positive balance of 17%. With the
exception of April which showed a positive balance of 19%, this was the
highest figure reported since April 1977.
Manufacturers continue to expect output to increase over the next few
months and by more than anticipated in April. But the pace of output
growth expected this month as indiciated by a positive balace of 31% is
less than the rate indicated in February and March.
Despite the downward revision in first quarter growth, the CBI
believes that the UK economy will continue to grow by around 3% per year
over the next two years -- 3.3% this year and 2.8% in 1996, little
changed from the February forecast. This compares with nearly 4% in
1994. Despite this slowdown in growth, total fixed investment is now
expected to grow more quickly by 4% this year and 4.2% in 1996. And
business investment is expected to rise more strongly than previously
forecast, by 6.4% this year and 5.2% next year.

A HEAVY presence in developing stock markets turned against Martin
Currie European Investment Trust in the year to end-April.
Relatively sizeable positions in the likes of Poland, Hungary, Russia
and the Czech Republic had helped the Edinburgh-based fund outperform
during its previous financial year.
However, in the 12 months to April, these holdings were partially
responsible for a 4.5% decline in fully diluted net asset value to
117.6p. This compared poorly with a fall of only 0.1% in the benchmark
FT Europe-ex UK index.
In contrast, earnings per share increased from 0.46p to 0.76p, with
lower interest costs resulting from the repayment of a #2m loan in April
last year.
European Investment increased its single dividend by 34% to 0.39p.
The #28m trust, which is invested in 19 countries, has 35% of its
holdings in France and Germany. Switzerland accounts for 10% of the
portfolio, with 8% invested in the Netherlands and 7% in Eire.
Developing stock markets account for 10% of the fund. The trust's
major exposure is to Poland, which accounts for 4%.

SCOTTISH Investment Trust staged a strong recovery in early 1995, but
failed to match a modest rise in its benchmark index during the six
months to April.
The independent Edinburgh-based trust faltered during the first part
of the period, but was then boosted by rising share prices in the United
States and other mature western markets.
The fund was also helped by a timely build-up of its portfolio in the
UK and emerging markets, but it has yet to reap the benefit of heavier
investment in Japan.
Net asset value rose 1.6% to 253.4p per stock unit, compared to a 3.9%
advance in the FT Actuaries World Index.
Net asset value actually declined 4.6% between November and January,
but it recovered 6.5% during the following three months.
Donald Ness, a fund manager at the trust, said it had ventured into
India for the first time as part of its build-up in emerging markets.
The trust had plunged back into UK gilts after running down its US,
Japanese and European bond portfolios last year and had shifted some
high yield equity exposure from Spain to Italy to spread risk, he added.
The trust took profits on investments in Germany to build up new
positions in France ahead of the presidential election which brought
right-winger Jacques Chirac to power.

THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS market is growing rapidly worldwide with new
developments in a variety of fields including mobile telecommunications
and multi-media. In addition there are numerous opportunities for
partnerships and minority shareholdings as deregulation in the
telecommunication industry sweeps across the world. Therein lies the
danger for companies seeking to maximise their earnings as Cable &amp;
Wireless (C&amp;W) found to its cost last year.
Costs associated with start-up ventures, such as Mercury One-to-One in
the UK, took their toll on group earnings.
Group profit before tax fell by 22.4% to #844m but that included #300m
of exceptional items. A charge of #122m relates to the reorganisation of
the Mercury business which will result in the loss of 2500 jobs by the
end of this calendar year. A further #178m was set aside to cover
goodwill associated with the acquisition of Telephone Rentals in 1988.
As part of its restructuring exercise, C&amp;W is seeking purchasers for the
non-strategic elements of the former TR activities in the UK.
A better guide to the underlying performance of the group comes from
the 9.4% improvement in operating profit before exceptional items. This
was achieved by a mixture of call volume growth and lower operating
costs. However this was undoutedly a black spot in the group. ''Mercury
stumbled but certainly did not fall'' said C&amp;W's executive chairman Lord
Young, who added that the disappointing performance was ''one we do not
intend to repeat''.
C&amp;W increased its turnover by 12% to #1645m helped by strong growth in
lines -- price cuts of #90m were made in the year in response to
competition -- but operating margins fell by 5% to 12%. Earnings per
share excluding exceptional items were static at 23.6p but the dividend
was raised by 9.7% to 9.05p after a final shareholders' payment of
6.22p.
Mercury, under its new chief executive Duncan Lewis, is focusing on
five key markets and eliminating peripheral activities. The
restructuring programme announced last December is ahead of schedule
with 1500 staff laid off so far. As part of the exercise efforts are to
be made to outsource some activities and reduce the amount of capital
tied up in infrastructure hardware such as cables and switches. For
example, a US company runs the Mercury directory enquiry service from
Galsgow and C&amp;W has already done a fibre swap in Scotland and shares
ducts with British Rail. C&amp;W's focus is on products and the deliverance
of better customer service.
Within the next three years C&amp;W expects to have got Mercury's margins
back up to the industry average of 15%, a figure which it has exceeded
in previous years. Mercury One-to-One is expected to make a profit next
year after increased losses of #61m in 1994, up from #33m last year.
The poor performance of Mercury obscured what was encouraging trading
in C&amp;W's overseas operations. In Hongkong Telecom turnover and profit
rose by 8% and 10% respectively helped by continued strong growth in
Chinese traffic. There was particularly strong demand for digital mobile
services.
Turnover and profit growth was also strong in the Caribbean although
adverse currency movements in Jamaica depressed the translated results.
Increased revenue and cost savings boosted the performance of the North
American business.
In 1994, the UK telecoms sector underperformed the FT-All Share Index
by 9.6%. However there was a better performance in the second half which
has carried through to the current financial year. Last year, Cable &amp;
Wireless was held back by the problems at Mercury however the board is
adamant that its earnings will be back on a positive track this year.
Chairman Lord Young said priorities for the current year were to
restore Mercury to profitable growth, invest less in new developments in
order to give better value to shareholders in the short term and to
substantially improve the group's overall earnings growth.
The fundamentals of the UK telecommunications market remain attractive
in the longer term which is why several City analysts continue to
recommend buying C&amp;W shares, despite last year's hiccup. The company has
been the subject of bid speculation with AT&amp;T and the cable company
TeleWest mentioned as possible suitors. Yesterday, C&amp;W shares were 5p
cheaper at 422p where they yield 2.7%.

THE ASSOCIATION of Accounting Technicians (AAT) is getting its second
Scottish president, but the first to be based professionally in
Scotland, in the appointment of Ken Sommerville, CA, MAAT.
Mr Sommerville is a partner with the medium-sized Glasgow-based
Chartered Accountants French Jarvie Macharg which employs 50 people, and
also a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland
(ICAS).
Mr Sommerville, who lives in Bearsden, was born and educated in
Glasgow. He was a member of the ICAS Council from 1984-1990 and spent
time on a variety of bodies including the Parliamentary and Law
Committee. He has been a nominated member of AAT Council since 1989. He
has a family of three girls in their early 20s and lists his interests
as golf and running.
His priority in his year of offfice is to educate employers in the
mutual benefits of training their staff with the AAT, with a theme
Partners in Employment. Mr Sommerville said that by training their staff
with the AAT, employers get the advantages of professional training
through ethical and disciplinary guidelines, a monthly journal and
through the Continuing Professional Development Scheme, the support and
means to update skills and develop as individuals.
AAT is a flexible qualification that can be applied in all employment
sectors. Mr Sommerville would like to see a significant increase in the
number of work-based Approved Assessment Centres -- organisations which
are approved by the AAT to train their accountancy staff in-house.
Founded in 1980, the AAT is not as widely recognised in Scotland as it
is in England and Wales, but it is accredited by the Scottish Vocational
Educational Council. AAT remains the only specialist body to offer both
Scottish Vocational Qualifications and National Vocational
Qualifications in accounting.
The AAT is the recognised professional body for Accounting technicians
and is sponsored by the five UK-based chartered accountancy bodies. In
1994, AAT had just under 90,000 members and students, 23% of whom were
living and working outside the UK and Ireland.

RUMOURS, which later proved to be false, that Mexico had defaulted on
its debt prompted a major sell-off in the US dollar with institutional
investors to the fore. Dealers switched into the German mark and
Japanese yen.
Currency movements were exaggerated by the thin market with many
European centres closed for a holiday. The dollar/yen was pulled below
85.
Breaks through key resistance levels fuelled the dollar's decline
although it is thought to have support at Y84.75. Towards the close of
trading there was some short covering in the dollar which saw it move
off its worst levels of the day.
Weak US economic data added to the dollar's woes. US jobless claims
rose and housing sales fell which suggests that interest rates will not
be going up in the near future. The reports reinforced concerns that
second quarter growth in the US economy will be softer than expected.
Sterling took advantage of the dollar's weakness to add almost three
cents to $1.6033 but it lost over a pfennig versus the strong German
mark to DM2.2560. Sterling's trade weighted index remained at 84.9.
Having broken through the $1.5800 level, sterling is thought to have
scope to move up to $1.6200 against the dollar.

THERE is an aura of satisfaction emanating from PowerGen after a 14.5%
jump in full-year profits to #545m thanks to the combination of
cost-cutting and higher wholesale electricity prices.
Chairman Sir Colin Southgate said: ''These are a strong set of
results.''
He added: ''They demonstrate that PowerGen's core UK electricity
business is rapidly emerging as one of the world's most efficient power
generation businesses.''
Profitability had been helped by a one-off 5% increase in power demand
following the temporary closure of two nuclear stations which sent
wholesale prices moving sharply ahead -- something which has been
fiercely attacked by ICI, an opponent of the present pool pricing
system.
PowerGen is in talks with various regional electricity distribution
companies to sell off 2000mw of excess capacity to meet the requirements
of regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild.
Because of increased industry capacity including Sizewell B coming on
stream in February, PowerGen expects its market share to continue to
fall from the current 25.9% to about 21%-22% by 1997 as other suppliers
enter the market.
The dividend total has been raised to 15p as indicated when the
Government sold its remaining 40% stakes in PowerGen and National Power
in March. The PowerGen price was 512p to the public compared with an
initial instalment of 185p. These part paid shares closed 2p better last
night at 203p.
About 600 jobs were lost during the year and since the 1991
privatisation, there has been a reduction in the workforce from 9500 to
under 4000. Another 200 employees could go in 1995.

COLLY GRAHAM, 50, is no Scrooge. Spending money is what he likes most,
even when he doesn't have any. Shelling out is, for him, as a bet to a
gambler. The transaction, the exchange, the purchase gives him a
pleasurable fix. He is a compulsive debtor.
He is also the person who imported the Debtors' Anonymous regime to
Northern Ireland from America. Craving for spending had cost him two
marriages. It had him sleeping rough in London. It had banished him from
a comfortable suburban semi-detached to a sixteenth-floor flat.
The condition has its roots in his childhood. When Colly was four
multiple sclerosis left his father, a bus conductor, incapable of work.
''I was reared on the welfare state and there was always a shortage of
money. I vowed that it would never happen to me when I grew up.''
A brief air force career was cut short by his drinking. Back again in
Dungannon, County Tyrone, though always in work, he never seemed to have
money. He married at 22, moved to Belfast to improve his prospects and
parted from his wife three years later after a liaison littered with
rows over money. He went off to London, convinced he could become a
millionaire. Instead, his inability to hold on to money brought
destitution.
Back in Northern Ireland, employed as marketing manager with a soft
drinks firm, he continued to be dogged by money problems. At 33, he
remarried, and got a mortgage on a house in County Down. Meals out and
presents for his wife became the order of the hour. Unpaid bills
mounted. A part-time business started in an effort to ease his financial
predicament slid quickly into the red, to the tune of #5000.
But his wife had a head for money. With her guidance he repaid all he
owed and, for a blissful interlude from 1985, was out of debt. Five
years later, however, credit cards had pushed him over the brink again.
This time a #7500 bank loan wiped the slate clean -- and paved the way
for more credit cards. The merry-go-round went into motion once more.
The end of the marriage sent him on a frenzy of spending. He ignored
all bills and treated himself to a holiday in America. He returned to a
hullabaloo of demands. The sale of his house as a result of six months
mortgage arrears was the last straw. Isolated, broken, he phoned the
Samaritans. They directed him to a debt counsellor. He owed #17,000.
In America he had purchased a haul of books. One mentioned Debtors
Anonymous. He wrote for more information. This led him to launch Debtors
Anonymous in Belfast, in 1991. With his fellow afflicted, he set about
clearing the wreckage of their past.
A spending plan is drawn up after careful records over two months
chart where every penny has gone. Rent and food are top priorities,
followed by electricity and telephone. A percentage of what income is
left goes to each creditor who is asked by letter to accept the offer.
Colly's #17,000 debt is slowly shrinking, defrayed each month by his
#100 outlay towards it. Cutting up credit cards and opening a bank
account that does not issue a cheque card are part of his debt-control
procedure.
But temptation reappears at intervals. He has filled out credit card
forms and torn them up en route to the post box. Colly is only one of an
army in Northern Ireland for whom debt is a problem -- now so widespread
that a confidential service, Money and Relational Counselling (MARC),
has been started to tackle its material and emotional effects.
While Colly is employed as a catering firm's sales manager, most of
MARC's clients are condemned to the penury of the state benefits he
despised as a boy. The province's 22,000 family credit recipients in
March 1994 represented a 17% rise over the previous year.   ''It's very
easy for a family who are on state benefit to end up in debt,'' says
MARC's Noel Adair. ''Benefit levels are too low and every penny counts.
So if their child needs new shoes there is pressure on parents to borrow
the money. Christmas is also peer pressure time. Loans are taken out for
presents for children that take the whole year to repay -- to credit
card firms, hire purchase, catalogues, banks, licensed money lenders
and, inevitably, loan sharks.''

As Chuck
Prophet's promotional tour continues, David Belcher discovers the
artist idolises Dylan, and despises buying matches
HAVING newly disembarked in London from Amsterdam, gravel-voiced
Californian Chuck Prophet was last week finding that his European
promotional tour of radio stations, record shops and journalists'
offices was going swell apart from one thing: matches. Over here in the
Old World, Chuck's been having to buy boxes of the things.
''We may have invented crack, and treated our native Americans pretty
bad,'' Chuck is saying, cigarette in mouth as he rummages vainly through
his pockets, ''but at least wherever you go in the US, you can pick up
books of matches for free.''
He is a downbeat, boho kind of a guy is Mr Prophet, his solo career
having encompasssed three downbeat, boho albums since the demise of his
former band, Green On Red. Chuck is erudite and opinionated, too. Chuck
on Bob Dylan?
''My problem with Dylan is the same one I have with Nick Cave: they're
both cool, but their fans are repulsive. To me, Dylan's entertainment
value is almost Chaplinesque, and it goes over most of his fans' heads.
The chords; the words; the rhymes; the stuff Dylan puts on records that
he shouldn't . . . flattening the songs and bending the melody, all that
stuff keeps the songs alive.
''Greatness messing up, that's always more intriguing. The manicured
stuff doesn't involve you, in the same way that photo-realism isn't art.
In the way that Abba sound perfect, but you aren't involved in what
they're doing. There has to be some chaos. All roads lead to Dylan.''
Chuck's pragmatic approach to his own art?
''Wherever I play, from LA to Scotland, it's to the same 200 losers,
so far as I can tell. But that's fine. I'm reacting against Jim Rose and
Trent Reznor, and so I don't have lots of lights and stuff going
crash-bang-boom-boom. I do goofy music-industry things like playing in
record shops. There's no owner's manual needed for my music, but at the
same time it's not insipid background noise.
''I've never done a hit record, but you hear bands who've had hits say
stuff like: 'We knew then and there in the studio that the song was a
hit.' That's what I value about playing live, getting a feeling that's
beyond words when the audience like your song.''
Mention of audiences means it's time for a plug. Chuck Prophet will be
appearing today in Glasgow twice. In the afternoon, at 4.30, he'll be
goofing around in the Virgin Megastore on his own, playing songs from
his new album on the China label, Feast Of Hearts. This evening Chuck
will be raising a ruckus at King Tut's with his band.
Chuck's new album is a thing of cranky guitars and rockin' retro
vibes, located somewhere just off the Main Street from which the Rolling
Stones were once notable exiles. The story which lies behind one of the
songs on the album, Let's Burn This Firetrap Down, seems to be what most
accurately sums up the LP's intended mood.
''It was written about the Albion, a bar at home in San Francisco that
me and my best mate, occasional song-writing partner, and closest
drinking-buddy, Kirk Lipschutz, used to go to. Kirk blew in from Palm
Springs, incidentally, and spent his first year in San Francisco living
in the back of a van, earning money by selling jokes.
''Anyway, at the Albion you could run up a drinks tab, and every band
that played there played too long and too loud, and there would be
people coming in trying to buy drinks with food stamps. It was where I
single-handedly invented my lo-fi solo career in 1990, playing songs to
five or 10 people and hoping they'd respond.
''But after a while I noticed that the Albion's walls seemed to change
their colour every week. One week they'd be purple, then they'd be puce
. . . and it turned out that when people couldn't pay their tab, the
barman would hand them a pot of paint and brush and set them to work.
''But then the bar passed on to new owners, and they stopped drinks
tabs, and brought in a CD jukebox, and dumped the shoebox full of
home-recorded tapes that used to get played. The Albion became a sports
bar, with a weekly raffle where you can win a turkey. It went out of my
range.
''And what the song is about, is the fact that things like that are
what push people over the brink. Not the major traumas in their lives.
It's breaking your shoelace, or finding that the price of avocados has
gone up and you've only got enough money to pay the old price.''
In the same way, when he made Feast Of Hearts, Chuck found himself
having to resist prettifying outside influences. ''There were impulses
to tweak the record. How Many Angels appears in its demo form. 'Why
re-record it?' I said. 'I did my job. I wrote the song, I can hear the
words.' Recording is about finding people who will have faith in you in
the studio. Who can see where it's meant to be heading before it
actually gets there.
''I've worked with Jim Dickinson, and he's a man who has faith . . .
after all, this is a guy who's played with the Stones and seen White
Horses go from crap to a masterpiece.''
And where will Chuck's faith in himself ultimately lead him?
''So long as I can maintain a certain lifestyle, I'm happy. My world
is pretty small. My goals and aims are to keep all the things that
aren't a part of my musical life out of my musical life. I'd only like a
hit record for the freedoms it would bring. Like, when Martin Scorsese
goes to a studio and says 'I'd like to make The Last Temptation of
Christ', no studio says 'OK, but first you have to do this movie with
Tom Cruise.'
''But I have to say that I enjoy my band being Stephanie Finch, my
regular partner-in-crime, and anybody else we can get who's in our
price-range . . . our price-range being the promise of free breakfasts
and all the prettiest girls in Scotland.''
Similarly, you should include Chuck Prophet in your music budget:
handy flares of illumination at a reasonable cost.

REVOLUTIONARY changes have been made to the local colour,
international content, and even the calendar of the summer celebrations
in a troubled town. Paisley Festival has been re-invented.
Claire Findlay, the director, has doubled the length of the festival
and shifted it from May to June. Fresh dates mean that the fun and games
will have for their climax the street excitement of Sma' Shot Day, a
traditional holiday established by turbulent weavers.
With sensible courage, one of the festival's four core venues will be
the Ferguslie Park housing scheme, the awkward blot on Paisley's
external relations and town image.
A theatrical fashion show will hansel the scheme's new Tannahill
Centre, a glitzy emporium of community meeting place, library, and
hi-tech auditorium. Robert Tannahill, the nineteenth-century local
lyricist, will be resurrected for the occasion. Using music, drama, and
historical costume, the poet will thread a colourful journey through the
story of the Paisley shawl.
Also at the Tannahill Centre, a cast of 50 will act out a half-century
in the fictional life of one woman in Ferguslie Park, further keeping
the Feegie to the fore of the festival.
Exotic imports will include Jaleo, a young group of flamenco artists
from Seville, starting a short Scottish tour at the town hall. At
Paisley Arts Centre the Third Estate company will present their
music-and-dance extravaganza called Panopticon. The municipal art
galleries are to have a show of seascapes and coastal scenes by Rhonda
Smith, a young home-town artist.
District comics will be invited to outgag each other at a series of
pub nights with Kevin Kopfstein as host. For a part of their prize the
winners will appear in the festival's Stand Up Comedy Night along with
outside professional talent variously billed as comic geniuses.
Local laughtermakers will be handicapped by the popular belief that
there are only two known Paisley jokes which are intelligible beyond the
boundaries of the old burgh.
Sma' Shot Day, now made the festival's finale, also has less
international fame than it deserves. It starts with a town parade to the
tuck of a historic drum and with banners flying to celebrate victory by
the weavers in a pay dispute in 1856. (The sma' shot was a hidden thread
in patterned cloth.) True to the weaving tradition of rough radicalism
and democratic action for revolutionary change, an effigy of a factory
boss will again be set fire to near the town cross.
Paisley Festival is from June 16.

HOLLYWOOD critics yesterday welcomed Mel Gibson's William Wallace in
Braveheart. It was, said the Los Angeles Times, the town's ''house''
newspaper, a ''rip-roaring Spartacus in kilts''.
For Gibson -- star, producer, and director of the movie, which runs
just a little short of three hours, it was the news he needed. He has
$15m of his own money as well as his reputation riding on the $70m
production. He desperately needed his film to win home-turf acceptance.
And it did, from the powerful Los Angeles Times, which qualified here
and there but was generally generous: ''It is a great big chunk of
brogues and pillaging and whooping. Gibson is priming us for an epic
experience, but as a film-maker he lacks the epic gift. But the movie
works as a hiss-the-English medieval Western. Gibson's callisthenic
efforts are clunky but they're not boring. Gibson plunges right into the
folklore.''
There is also praise for Glasgow's James Cosmo who plays one of
Wallace's ageing warriors. And is amused by Gibson's hairdo: ''His
long-haired look not only outdoes Liam Neeson in Rob Roy it even trumps
Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall,'' wrote Times film critic Peter
Rainer.
French actress Sophie Marceau, as Princess Isabelle, is Wallace's lady
love but Rainer felt: ''The battle scenes are more impressive than the
love scenes.''
Finally, for the town newspaper the bottom line -- the dollar
potential. ''From a commercial point of view Gibson may be wondering,
particularly with his female fans: if they come to see me will they stay
for the beheadings?''

WHEN a Hungarian orchestra tours Britain, audiences have a right to
expect to hear some Bartok, if not some Ligeti or Kurtag. But the
Budapest Symphony Orchestra on Wednesday contented itself with Kodaly's
Galanta Dances, which could hardly be called demanding, before
proceeding to the comfort of Dvorak and Brahms.
A conventional programme, then, and potentially not much of a start to
this year's Perth Festival. What made it interesting, however, was the
particular colouring of the Hungarian woodwind, and the resultant
freshness of texture, not only in Tamas Vasary's affectionate conducting
of Kodaly but even in Brahms's second symphony.
Balances were unpredictable and sometimes startling, even if some of
the effects, such as the acceleration into the closing section of the
Brahms, were superimposed on the music rather than an integral part of
it.
Vasary, the conductor, was prepared, it seemed, to do things he would
never have done in his more familiar guise as an outstanding pianist.
Yet the sweep of the strings in the Brahms and the inner rhythmic
tension served his interpretation in good stead. The Kodaly, filled with
nicely turned phrases, was a delight. Only Dvorak's violin concerto,
with Vilmoss Szabadi as a somewhat scratchy, spindly-toned soloist,
failed to deliver its message, for all the assurance implied by the
conductor's decision -- unusual in a concerto -- not to use a score.
The often Rusalka-like magic of the music went for little, and such
vital factors as charm and buoyancy were too largely missing.

SUDDENLY Rodney Ackland is all the rage. Suddenly, however, has come
too late for an embittered Ackland who died in 1991, although he did
live to see some of his work revived just before his death thanks to Sam
Walters's Orange Tree Theatre at Richmond. Absolute Hell, a re-writing
of an earlier play, The Pink Room, was also the subject of a stunning TV
production in 1991 by Anthony Page who has now directed this National
Theatre revival, again starring Judi Dench as the louche Christine
Foskett, proprietrix and presiding spirit of La Vie en Rose, a rackety
old watering-hole which has survived the war but now stands, like its
customers, facing a shaky peace.
In its TV incarnation, Ackland's misanthropic picture of life on the
home front left a bilious, rancid taste in the mouth. This assorted,
viciously observed bunch of outsiders -- drunk bohemians, Servicemen on
leave, pixilated old biddies, camp queens, and butch dykes (depictions
well ahead of their time) -- evoked a creepy, ambivalent atmosphere. You
didn't much care for these wastrels, largely avoiding reality through
the bottom of a glass. But it had the sting of truth about it, and when
Christine was left alone at the end, her terror and loneliness stripped
the play and your own heart asunder.
On the Lyttelton stage, that claustrophobic intensity is gone,
replaced by something jokier, less threatening, though still
extraordinary in its creation of characters and types. A sprawling,
open-ended piece, there are any number of wonderful cameos and
portraits, from Peter Woodthorpe's lurid film director to Greg Hicks as
the gay, aspiring writer Hugh Marriner (Ackland got a lot off his chest
with this one).
The evening however belongs to Judi Dench whose Christine is a triumph
of garish desperation.

IN the beginning -- or so it occurs in Laurie Booth's scenario --
tango is man solitary man, spiralling patterns across a mosaic of light
and shade. And then? Then it becomes a match between men. Not just a
face-face-to-face confrontation, but an actual partnering. A close duet
that, in its interlacing footwork and brushing limbs, presages the
arrival of women in the dance. On they stride, thighs flashing through
flirty, short -- side-slashed -- skirts, their calves made elegantly
taut by high-heeled shoes. The dancers couple. There's a sudden,
electric energy. And always, there is this consummate poise, this
control.
Overhead, hanging like a huge curved dagger is Duncan MaCaskill's
metal sculpture. And pulsing all around, is the sound score (Hans Peter
Kuhn/Juan Cedron) in which drifts of authentic tango music pierce a
melee of howling, brattling urban clatter. So far, so good. And in the
case of Laurie Booth and Ellen van Scuylenburch utterly superb. But
Booth's choreography in this first half tends to linger overmuch on
small variations within his central theme. When matters turn barefooted,
in part two, and the moves become as it were naturalised in a jungle
setting of sweaty darkness and burping frogs, the dance takes on a freer
more elemental vitality. A fascinating performance, stunningly executed
by Booth and his company -- even when it verges on the contemplation of
its own navel, the fierce, fine energy of this company keep one's eyes
glued to the stage.

MICHAEL FRY surveys the latest guides to culinary excellence with
which discerning palates will not be disappointed, though possibly
puzzled
SCOTLAND now has six restaurants with a star in the Michelin Guide,
one for each million of us, and one to spare. This still falls well
short of France, which has a star for roughly every 200,000 inhabitants.
I am not sure how many have been awarded to the large country in
between, but I bet it is not 50. On the strength of that, Scots seem for
the first time in history to be cooking and eating better, at least on
average, than the English.
The book edited by Brian Hannan is intended as a survey of the great
cooks now working in Scotland, or of those who have been brought up here
in a culinary sense. It provides in general, though only in general, a
good idea of what can be done by the best hands with our incomparable
produce. But there are one or two pitfalls for those who may seek
enlightenment from it.
I did my usual test of trying a recipe at random, or not quite at
random because I am an immoderate admirer of David Wilson at the Peat
Inn. I am also a lover of lobster, indeed rather hope to die of a
surfeit of it, and have on occasion come close to doing so. So I picked
out Wilson's lobster in a vegetable and herb broth, rushed out to buy
one and set to work.
At the end, as directed, I removed the meat from the claws and tail.
Then came this instruction: ''Place the lobster tail in centre of warm
plate and claws at each side to create the shape of the lobster. Scatter
the finely sliced carrot, fennel and leek around, pour over broth, then
sprinke with fresh herbs. Serve immediately.''
Yes, but what do you do with the meat? Save it for a sandwich with
peanut butter? Offer it to the cat? This gives Hamlet without the prince
a whole new meaning. I dare say Wilson is a very busy man, but perhaps
Hannan might have found time to check through the text a bit more
thoroughly.
A cavalier attitude, conscious this time, is also adopted by Anthony
Wormall Thompson, the successful founder of several bistros in London.
His literary style seems to owe a good deal to the English football
supporters: ''Nothing wrong with the French apart from their arrogant
belief that the rest of the world can't cook. On yer bike, Frenchie, the
Brits are coming.''
This chauvinism is somewhat belied by the number of recipes plainly
French in origin. But if you can put up with it you will find the
collection a source of ideas which are colourful without being too
extravagant or expensive, designed to bring the variety of a restaurant
to the domestic table. The recipes are arranged in the shape of entire
menus for a dinner party, and there are good notes on wine.
It is a mystery why pasta should have come to be regarded as
non-fattening, in a way that bread and potatoes are not. Each is full of
carbohydrates, and the general rotundity of Italian grandmothers should
be warning enough that none is inherently more slimming than the other.
It depends, of course, what you put in the sauce. There is nothing so
simple as the regulars' lunchtime favourite at my own choice among all
the wonderful restaurants in Rome, the Carbonara in the Campo de'Fiori,
where they serve spaghetti just with olive oil and parmesan. The dish
turns out sublime because the ingredients are.
You will not find that recipe among Anne Sheasby's light pasta sauces,
and some of hers -- beef in red wine, egg and bacon, Mexican pork --
strike me as more fattening if anything. Still, to be fair there are a
great number of virtuous alternatives.
So are there also in the Good Housekeeping book of pasta sauces,
edited by Helen Southall. But it does not take stint on gluttony either.
Both these collections meticulously tot up the calories, and the latter
reaches a magnificent count of 930 for a single serving of pasta with
spicy sausage and roasted tomato sauce. By the same author, and in the
same series, comes a useful compendium of quick meals for the harassed
Mum, though of little interest to the gourmet.
For his jaded palate I would, on the other hand, recommend the amusing
potato cookbook by Hilaire Walden. There is nothing so good as the spud
for the cheerfully obese. Not only does it carry its own charge of
carbohydrates, but it is also capable of soaking up quantities of fat,
and therein lies much of its capacity for tastiness.
I was sorry to find no mention either of pommes rissoles, which are
tiny new potatoes fried whole, or of pommes souffles, the technique is
too complex to set out here by which potatoes are both deep fried and
puffed up. But otherwise Walden demonstrates amply the versatility of
her humble tuber.
In the same series comes a fruit cookbook which is a little
disappointing. In New York last year, concocting main dishes with meat
and fruit was the latest craze in the restaurants, but there is none of
the variety here that I found there. To put one lime in a seafood gumbo
appears to the author to be enough to turn it into something fruity.
They would not stand for that in Gotham.

THE doyen of English-language broadcasting, and the last of the great
wireless men, Alastair Cooke of Letter from America fame, once pointed
out the decency of the Fourth Estate when it came to President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. For in all the years that FDR presided over the United
States no photographer ever took a snap and no journo ever phrased a
line which showed up Roosevelt as what he was: a cripple.
Roosevelt contracted polio as a relatively young man and throughout
his long presidency he could not walk unaided. He had to be lifted out
of cars and chairs. His wasted body was never seen until the last days
when it became only too evident, (at Yalta and Yenan for instance),
probably mainly because of his extraordinary buoyancy throughout most of
his office.
Much reviled as he was by the upper classes of America, and considered
doubtfully by the middle-income groups, Roosevelt became a hero and few
Americans and fewer Europeans knew of his disability. Whether the press
would observe such a decency now I know not. In America that is. The
British hacks did with Harold Wilson in his long years of retirement and
decline.
For what was withheld from the public about one of the United
Kingdom's longest-serving Prime Ministers, and certainly the only one
this century to win four elections, Harold Wilson, was that he had long
suffered from Alzheimer's disease. Why the coyness about what, in fact,
killed my mother and is on a level of increase only those with
experience of it know about, is difficult to explain and I commend
President Reagan for admitting to a condition which will become more
prevalent within the coming years.
It was ironic that perhaps the most intellectual Prime Minister of all
time, with a reputation for a remarkable memory should have succumbed to
premature senile decay. Maybe there is decency yet among the press, for
until his death on Wednesday, no media outlet reported his distressing
condition. That's on the plus side for the media.
Here's the minus: what was all this nonsense about Wilson's failure to
control the economy? Wasn't there, when Harold Wilson took over from the
infamous ''13 years of Tory Misrule'', a destroyed economy to take over.
I remember it. For I went through the beginnings of what turned out to
be a Government in which I went from youth to manhood. We talk now of a
Thatcher Generation, but it was a Wilson Generation in which I grew up.
For people now to talk of the ''failure'' of the Wilson Government is
not to understand what a success it was.
For a start the British people, as a whole, were a hell of a lot
better off, then as before, then as now. The average British worker
wasn't only better-paid, and enjoyed a lifestyle unimagined by even
socialist visionaries of a decade before, in retrospect, people had a
greater evel of both excitement and security than before or since as
well. The Labour Government oversaw an explosion of talent and frenetic
fun never seen before in the bulk of the population.
If the economic situation was especially trying for the Wilson
administration, one thing it managed to do; two really. One was we all
had jobs. Two was that we enjoyed ourselves perhaps more than any
European people has done before or since.
We have a lot of before and sinces in today's column. I met Harold
Wilson twice, both before. Before he resigned. I met him first at a
by-election in North Kelvinbridge when Dr Maurice Millar was standing
and I was the youngest Labour Party member damn-near it in the UK and
Wilson was rather stout and a bit fleshy.
He had enormous energy and was champing at the bit for the forthcoming
General rannygazoo. He was quite short, I remember thinking, with
silvery grey hair, and didn't smoke a pipe at all until the
photographers hove into view. He smoked cigarettes in fact.
The next time I met him was at a May Day rally in Queen's Park in
Glasgow. His hair was sterling silver now, hallmarked. He was a lot
thinner but looked very tired until he got up to speak. Afterwards we
repaired to the Central Hotel where we had a buffet set up and he once
again smoked fags until the photocalls were announced.
He was there with Denis Healey and both of them told us, and I
believed them, that they were going to win the 1974 election, and they
did. The following Tory years were as dreadful economically and
certainly morally, as one could not have imagined in the Wilson years.
But that was the Wilson years. What you might call the Before years. The
years Since? My only criticism of Harold Wilson is this. I wish he'd
stayed on.

JUST occasionally, it's possible to glimpse something of the city
which Edinburgh might be. Rise early on a summer Sunday and take to your
feet and a golden shock of silence rings in your ears. The gutters may
be choked with dead metal but the cobblestones are free to breathe. For
an hour or two the town is virtually carless.
The human miracle of Edinburgh -- its organic buildings sprouting from
the cliffs and chasms like sculptured mutations of the living rock, the
startling profiles of its Janus face -- is recovered. Here is the
thrilling menace of the anarchic Old Town, the heartlifting harmony of
the rational New. Here, if we need reminding, is one of the world's
great cities.
''Came to Edinburgh by night -- astonished at the city next morning --
wild dream of a great genius -- finest city in Europe -- maybe in time
in the world . . .'' So raved Benjamin Robert Haydon in his diary of
1820. Nearly two centuries later, Edinburgh has blown it. The fabric of
its wild dream remains but its great genius has gone. Far from being the
finest city in the world Edinburgh hasn't got the civic imagination of
the regional capital of Emilia-Romagna.
Bologna is only one of many European towns which make Edinburgh's
negotiations with the motor car look primitive. This week, during the
city's ''Festival of the Environment'', a brutal bunch of management
consultants rained on the parade. Commissioned by regional, district,
and commercial organisations to review Edinburgh's environmental record,
Touche Ross denounced the paucity and mediocrity of its transport
strategies. The city, they said, ''lags behind the leading European
cities in terms of the imagination and effectiveness with which it is
addressing the problem of traffic congestion''.
Tell me about it. I've lived in Edinburgh for over 20 years and there
hasn't been a day when I haven't felt roused by the moody drama of its
beauty. But with every moment of breathless aprreciation there have
come, over the years, another 10 of speechless fury. I start to squawk
when I do my own review of Edinburgh's traffic management.
''Chronic congestion and poor air quality,'' said Touche Ross. They
can only get worse if the city pursues its long-term masterplan of
pusillanimous, piecemeal policy-making which has, at its centre, a
massive contradiction: how can you make Edinburgh
''pedestrian-friendly'' while continuing to appease and accommodate the
motor car and all its vested interests?
What is the consequence of widening pavements, blocking junctions,
bedding down sleeping policemen, re-routing, slowing and calming traffic
if you don't also reduce the volume of vehicles using the roads? Why,
you permit more and more carefree pedestrians to walk through the
friendly fumes and amiable roar of more and more compressed traffic. The
mad logic behind Edinburgh's pedestrian-friendly initiatives is reaching
its apogee, as I write, in the Royal Mile.
Here we have one of the most spectacular residential and tourist
thoroughfares in the world. Lesser roads, mere mean streets with
pretensions to quaint aspect or historic value, are pedestrianised in
every tinpot town throughout Europe. What is Edinburgh's grand design
for its ancient high street? It has put men to work, expanding the
pavements into bubbles, contracting sections of the road into single
lanes. ''Pedestrian-friendly'' is again the buzz-word; intended ''to
discourage non-essential traffic''.
There are three things wrong with this scheme. One, where there's a
way there's a will; traffic is ''discouraged'' from using available
routes only when work parties of small boys scatter broken glass and
sharp nails in its path. Two, the funnelling of cars and tour buses into
single lanes will trap even more fumes in this tenement canyon. Three,
Edinburgh is spending lots of money on missing the opportunity to free
the Royal Mile from all but residential access and delivery traffic and
turn it into a pedestrian's paradise.
Edinburgh specialises in missed opportunities. Its suburban railway
lines have been converted to cycle tracks, hospitable to cyclists who
dread the inhospitable roads. Its various visions of rapid light-transit
systems and north-south metro routes have been dumped, down the decades,
on the grounds of cost. It wilfully overlooks or rejects the obvious.
While the city of Bologna finds the money for less ambitious measures --
free public transport during rush hours, park-and-ride facilities --
Edinburgh hands over its best sites for peripheral parking to monster
developments like the new Sainsbury at Craigleith, and puts its faith in
the ''Greenway.''
What is a Greenway? I am lately come to this ingenious concept which,
courtesy of George Orwell, makes life easier for the motor car while
affecting the colours of eco-concern. A Greenway is a route which
prohibits car-parking along its length, which proscribes the parking of
cars for even the briefest purposes of collection or delivery. Sounds
environmentally sound? Look at this potential example.
A Greenway is proposed for one of Edinburgh's central arteries:
Raeburn Place, the ''high street'' of Stockbridge, socially mixed,
commercially vigorous, community minded. Many old people, many children,
lots of small traders and specialist retailers fighting off the
competition from nearby Safeway and Sainsbury. Many cars parked, on the
single yellow lines of Raeburn Place, as people dive in and out of the
shops for their heavier commissions.
There might be an argument for pedestrianising Raeburn Place but
that's another argument. At the moment the amount of car-parking going
on there slows the traffic which uses it as a throughway to the city
centre. If Raeburn Place becomes a Greenway it will also become a rat
run to even more traffic. Lethally unfriendly to children and old folk,
dangerous to everyone. More Redway than Greenway.
If I ruled the world, or even Edinburgh, I would do what the Romans
did at a stroke. I would close the city centre to all non-essential
traffic between the hours of 6.30am and 7.30pm, and I wouldn't even wait
until the infrastructure of an integrated transport system was in place.
I would just do it.
After all the yelping and squealing had subsided I bet we'd find we
loved our recovered city. We would learn to walk again, reclaim the
streets, overflow the pavements, shop till we dropped in thoroughfares
running with rivers of people, noisy with the chatter of human voices.
We would be safer, healthier, and happier.
The Romans did it to protect their classical relics and Renaissance
buildings. If Edinburgh won't do it to protect its citizens, can't it
spare a thought for its own heritage industry?

Julia Langdonfinds the Scots-born director of the Consumers'
Association a team player who relishes challenge, and has a talent for
making things happen
A SMALL coloured cartoon hangs conspicuously on the wall of the rather
grand office of the director of the Consumers' Association. It shows the
director, portrayed as a jockey on a racecourse, and bears the caption:
''. . . and it's Legs McKechnie on a new hobby horse from Shelter in the
Fresh Challenge Stakes . . .''
It was obviously drawn as a present to mark Sheila McKechnie's move to
take over the job of running the country's best-known consumer
organisation, and anyone could tell you, after about five minutes'
conversation with her, that it must have been drawn by somebody who
knows her. There is clearly nothing she enjoys quite so much as a good
challenge.
She is one of those earnest, serious-minded people who is
intellectually attracted by problems, to whom everything suggests
another idea or another way of looking at things.
She plunges into discussion on any subject: she is re-thinking this,
she is looking at that, she is worried about the other. Look, here is a
paper explaining this project, here is the letter she wrote to the
Guardian last week. She talks fluently, quickly; she is a busy person
with not a moment to waste, with a great deal to do. And despite all
this, thank goodness, she also manages to be friendly and funny.
She is cheery, really, in a very Scottish way, and despite the big job
and the imposing offices and a humming air of efficiency about the
place, she is not remotely intimidating. She is obviously a team-worker
and popular for it. She makes the tea and coffee for us herself before
even saying hello. She refers a great deal to what ''we'' are doing and
want to do and hope to do.
It must be some measure of what it is like working for her that her
personal assistant at Shelter came with her when she moved into this
handsome regency house on London's Marylebone Road.
It is a long way from Falkirk, from what she calls her ''ordinary
Scottish working-class background'' -- a phrase she uses with some
pride. Her father was a baker, her mother left school at 15 to go to
work, always resented the educational opportunities denied her and
determined that her daughters would not be so deprived. She was once
asked what she would have done if her two daughters had not gone to
university. ''No daughter of mine would not have gone to university,''
she retorted.
Sheila went to Edinburgh to read history and politics (''actually I
went to university to have fun''), did a post-graduate degree at Warwick
in industrial relations and worked for a small trade union before
joining what was then ASTMS, the white-collar union, as the health and
safety officer. She was already interested in the broad approach to
consumer affairs, and even during those years had her eye on what was
going on at the Consumers' Association. She was particularly concerned
with microbiological safety, the conditions of laboratory workers
handling dangerous bugs.
She helped get the rules changed after the infamous Birmingham
smallpox outbreak, which led to the death of a medical photographer in
1978, and when she left to go to Shelter in 1985 she was involved in
helping to produce the guidelines for handling Aids material.
Everything she says, everything about her, sounds political; but no,
no, she reacts startled at the suggestion that she is a member of the
Labour Party. She came under pressure to join while working for the
union, but she believed then the currently more fashionable view being
developed today about the need for a distance between Labour and the
unions.
''All the jobs I have done have required that I be party politically
neutral, and I think that's right. People expect you to be non-partisan
and very independent,'' she says.
She is a critic and would be as critical of any political party in
government that was doing what she believed was wrong. ''I do not deny
that I do what I do because I have a whole range of political beliefs:
about the kind of society I want to live in; what I would like to see
our children inherit; the levels of responsibility of people towards
other people.'' She laughs: ''A good old-fashioned Scottish sense of
values.''
Are they different from other values? Well, yes, she obviously thinks
they are. ''Without getting too romantic about it, I still think the
level of community responsibility among the Scottish communities that I
know is just so different from down here -- well, London is a big city,
London is London, a transit camp. Where I come from people are more
aware, more responsible for other people around them.''
This new job which she started at the turn of the year is very much
involved with responsibility for other people. She whizzes off into a
discussion about how ''we'' are re-thinking the politics of the consumer
for the next election.
It is a problem because the field of consumer action is so vast, so
disparate, that politicians can virtually choose which area of
consumerism they wish to address and then claim that they are meeting
people's needs.
''To be credible,'' says the director, firmly, ''they have to find out
what people want.''
To some extent this is a problem she has, too. The Consumers'
Association is vast. It has a turnover of #45m -- although a huge amount
of resources is taken up with product testing. They have a new
laboratory, opened a month ago -- the biggest in Europe. It has 800,000
members, subscribers to Which? and the host of offshoot publications.
When a new health magazine was launched recently offering a telephone
information service on health problems, there were 1000 calls on the
first day. The association is using new technology, voice mail -- and at
local charges -- to handle this.
It is an important point because one of the organisation's modern
problems is how to deliver the information it has to the people who need
it.Consumerism has changed. It is no longer about buying the best
toaster -- although this is still immensely relevant. It is about
services: pensions, savings, housing costs, mobility, disability; how to
handle the fear of poverty; the implications of many more people working
from home with computers.
''The pensions issue brings home one of the really big problems for
us, and we are trying to have a re-think at the moment,'' explains
McKechnie. ''Is it ever going to be possible to inform even the most
numerate consumer with all the information to make the right choice?''
She is wrestling with a host of difficult questions of this nature
about the developments in consumerism. It is not made any easier by the
huge range of what is covered: people campaigning for better care for
the elderly, or improved treatment for breast cancer are consumers,
McKechnie points out, although they may not think of themselves as such.
Is education a subject they should cover? What can be done about the
fact that the poorest people pay most for their debt?
McKechnie handles a vast range of unseen work, too, like research into
standards -- of anything: air safety, cars, toasters. It is untrue, she
says firmly, that European standards are improving things. A great many
are being lowered. ''Where agreement can't be reached on a new standard,
there's a tendency to say 'Well, we won't have one.' It's happening at
the moment with the requirement to show the temperature on the front of
oven doors . . .''
The range and detail of the subjects with which she has to deal is
alarming, but one senses that it is partly her own inquiring, restless
energy that involves her. Take children. Her partner, Alan has a
daughter of 25, but McKechnie has none of her own. ''It's not something
I ever wanted.'' She pauses. ''Sometimes I think how do women with very
full lives actually decide to have them . . .'' and then we're off into
child care provision, women in the workforce, the status of women,
relationships.
She and Alan have been together for 20 years: ''I'm a very settled old
lady, I am. It's astonishing.'' It may astonish her, but it is not true.
Settled she isn't. She had referred at one point to the Consumers'
Association as a sleeping giant, as she discussed using its power,
waking it. Was it not because she is the sort of person she is,
unsettled and unsettling, that she was appointed? She recognises the
import of the question and grins.
''They knew what they were gettin', so I think the answer is yes. I
make no secret of the fact that if you want things to change you have to
set out to win. It's not enough for the Consumers' Association to get an
enormous amount of satisfaction about being right. It's actually to use
that information, to make things happen. Yes, I think that's my talent:
making things happen.''

''WE cannot legislate for human behaviour,'' the Speaker Betty
Boothroyd told MPs earlier this week. She was responding to Monday's
personal statement from Sir Jerry Wiggin, apologising for using
colleague Sebastian Coe's name, without Coe's knowledge, when putting
down amendments to a Bill affecting an industry in which Wiggin has a
personal financial interest.
I was so struck by her confession of legislative impotence when I
first heard it on radio, that I interrupted my morning shaving ritual to
jot down her words. I'm sure that's what she said. But by the time they
appeared in cold type in Hansard, the Boothroyd words ''human
behaviour'' had been narrowed down to ''integrity''.
However, the force of the Chair's intervention remains. Legislators,
on this analysis, cannot pass laws to make people behave with greater
personal integrity. That is a matter for the individual consciences of
those concerned. ''Individual Members,'' the Speaker continued,
according to Hansard, ''should act in such a manner whereby their
integrity is not called into question.''
It was wayward MPs, not directors of the National Grid or other
privatised utility bosses, the Speaker had in mind when she conceded the
powerlessness of the Commons to instil better behaviour through
legislation. But, given the latest revelations about Mr David Jefferies
and his colleagues' share dealings, the public clamour for action,
effective or otherwise, is rapidly becoming irresistible.
''It is a question of being tax efficient,'' squealed a Grid
spokesman, when confronted with confirming the latest news that his
masters -- not content with racking up massive realised gains on share
option deals months before a single Grid share has been traded on the
Stock Exchange -- are also lodging thousands of their remaining shares
in their wives' names, to minimise tax on future dividends and capital
gains.
''Being tax efficient'' are weasel words much beloved of bean-counting
accountants and other financial advisers. What that apparently innocuous
phrase masks is a reluctance to pay any tax at all, if those involved
can possibly avoid it. There's a whole industry out there devoted to the
challenge of finding new ways of avoiding tax. Each successive finance
Bill is meat and drink to those who dream up free-ride schemes for those
with the biggest tax liabilities.
None of us likes paying tax. But, unless you are an enthusiast for the
wilder shores of Adam Smith Institute libertarianism, if none of us paid
any tax we would confront the collapse of civilised society as we
currently understand it.
So, when those who have gained so much personally from the discounted
sale of state assets are subsequently revealed, exploiting every fiscal
nook and cranny, to pay back as little of their gains in tax as
possible, we are entitled to prod their consciences and challenge their
integrity.
I've no doubt, as the man from the Grid said, that everything that Mr
Jefferies and his three colleagues have done is perfectly legal and
above board. Equally I've no doubt such practices are widespread in
boardrooms across the land. But that is simply not the point.
What sticks in the public craw is the sight of men who, for most of
their careers, were content to work in the public sector for salaries a
fifth, a sixth, or even a seventh of what they award each other now, men
who top up six-figure salaries with generous stock option schemes and
equally expansive personal pension provision, now wriggling this way and
that to minimise their personal contributions to the funding of
remaining state-run activities, from the health service to public
infrastructure, from law and order to education. Such behaviour stinks.
But the smell is not just the reek of naked greed from a few fortunate
individuals. It is symptomatic of a deeper malaise which undermines real
enterprise in this country. If half the energy which is devoted to
devising smarter and smarter schemes of tax avoidance in Britain were
channelled into developing new ways of financing real business-building
and backing considered risk-taking we would not now be fretting about
decades of relative industrial decline.
And yet every scheme devised in Britain in the past couple of decades
to match the appetite for tax avoidance with the unmet demand for
investment in new enterprises has been subverted in favour of those
seeking a relatively risk-free shelter for their tax liabilities. Aided
and abetted by Nigel Lawson, the ill-fated Business Expansion Scheme was
turned into an instrument of housing policy, the lion's share of the
money going into funding supposedly low-risk assured tenancy housing and
university residences.
Enterprise zones -- the one on Greenock's waterfront is a prime
example -- have been as much about sheltering the tax liabilities of
top-rate taxpayers in bright new -- but empty -- tin sheds and office
blocks as about attracting new businesses and industries to areas of
severe industrial distress. It remains to be seen what the financial
mechanics will do with the new Enterprise Investment Scheme. But the
precedents are not encouraging.
No doubt Mr Jefferies and his colleagues at National Grid, like other
heads of privatised utilities, believe all their rewards have been hard
earned, injecting new commercial disciplines and efficiencies into
flabby state-owned enterprises.
But, whether they like it or not, their achievements to date have not
been at the leading edge of management challenges. They have enjoyed the
(admittedly unravelling) remnants of regional or (in the case of
National Grid) national monopoly. They have stripped out cost by making
a lot of other people redundant (an additional 459 last year in the case
of National Grid). They have not shown any great ability to grow their
core market. UK sales of electricity have been stubbornly flat since the
industry was sold. We have yet to see whether they can make a real
success of diversification into areas like telecoms.
That hasn't stopped them reaping big rewards quickly for themselves.
But, until there is clear evidence that their enthusiasm for achieving
tax efficiency in their personal affairs is demonstrably matched by
exceptional business-building skills, they would be well advised to heed
Speaker Boothroyd's warning to MPs and look to their integrity.

WE are on about art again. This time it's a show at the Transmission
Gallery in King Street, Glasgow, which is called New Rose Hotel, after a
novel by Canadian science-fiction writer William Gibson. It is, we are
told, ''about design that could be art, art that could be design and all
the complex relationships in between . . . It's about free coffee,
magazines, and shopping.''
Yes, there's what looks like a coffee machine. But it's so much more.
It's actually exhibit number three in the catalogue, is called
''coffee-break'', and has been brought to Glasgow courtesy of Berlin
artist Eva Grubinger. ''Both cups and machine are merchandising
articles. It is just a stone's throw from art-office to Tupperware
party; coffee-break can thus be read as a humorous play on the
still-widespread prejudice that female appropriation of technology is
limited to the use of household appliances.'' My relationship with the
office coffee machine will never be the same again.
The pile of magazines on the table is actually exhibit number seven.
Just a lot of randomly selected mags, you might think. But no. This work
by Martin Young ''plays on the ambiguous status of magazines as both
aesthetic design objects and functional channels for information, the
work itself signifying a collection of conflicting lifestyles''. In
other words, magazines tend to look nice and can also have interesting
articles in them and different people like different kinds of magazine.
There is a video screen with some simple abstract shapes but, as the
artist Su Grierson tells us, it is ''occupying the space of the video
screen which is normally the province of information, narrative, and
everyday 'reality'.'' Like, people don't usually watch shapes on their
telly, they watch the news and films.
But the show does have its own movie, shot on the opening night of the
exhibition. It is called I am here and was filmed from the passenger
seat of a car on a grey and damp Glasgow night. It follows some youngish
people in a smart Toyota four-wheel drive as they try to find a cash
machine.
We won't spoil it for you by telling you how it ends.
Without a prayer
STILL on art, the upcoming show at the Collective Gallery in Edinburgh
offers: ''Installations using vestments, sheets, and blankets, carbolic
soap, soot, lace, wax, wire wool and engine oil, explore Patricia
Mackinnon-Day's experiences as a Catholic child in the Glasgow tenements
of the 1960s.'' See being a Catholic in a Glasgow tenement? See engine
oil?
A hill to climb
A NEW book, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, is, we are told, about to
explode dearly held myths about Glasgow's favourite architect and
designer.
Author Alan Crawford will tell us that Toshie was not really the
misunderstood genius cruelly ignored in his day by all but a few
patrons. He was a busy and successful architect who, if he had been
appreciated more, would have to work three nights and Sunday.
Toshie was a hard-drinking Glasgow man who smoked himself to an early
death. He didn't turn his back on Glasgow. He merely went on holiday to
Suffolk in 1914 and forgot to come back.
We are sure Mr Crawford is absolutely right about all of this but
might have been more confident if his article in the Independent on
Sunday had not referred to Toshie's masterpiece, the Glasgow School of
Art, being located in Gilmorehill. That's where the yoonie is. The art
school is in Garnethill.
We can't blame Mr Crawford for the caption to the photo which
describes Mackintosh's famous building in Helensburgh as the Hull House.
As we all know, it's called the Hull Hoose.
Off colour
WE suppose that now Duncan Ferguson has been invited to be a guest of
Her Majesty, a new Everton change strip will be very much in demand. The
one with all those arrows on it.
* A preview of the English Cup Final in the Daily Telegraph compared
the relative qualities of some Manchester United and Everton players.
Having analysed the potential role of United's Irish player Roy Keane,
the writer turned to Big Dunc with the words: ''Another colourful Celt
is Duncan Ferguson . . .'' What a thing to say about a True Blue. A chap
could get violent over a comment like that.
Close to home
ANOTHER car acronym for Fiat -- ''Fix It Again, Tony'' from an Ursilla
or Giralla or Grailla Jeffrey (anyway it's somebody from Milton of
Campsie whose first name is hard to make out) who heard it in Canada.
Our search for an acronym for British Airways produced a fair old crop
of insults such as this from Jonathan Webley of Dalry: Baggage
Reclamation Is Totally Incompetent So Have Adequate Insurance Ready With
Your Suitcases. David Campbell from Helensburgh salutes those lovely
stewardesses with: Being Regailed In Totally Incongruous Silly Hats,
Attendants In Rouge Wear Also Yielding Smiles.
Gerry McCulloch of Saltcoats takes the biscuit airline acronym-wise
with his Singapore Airlines: Since I Never Go Anywhere Pretty Or Remote,
Everyone Assumes I Really Like It Near Equatorial Saltcoats.
Meanwhile, let us indulge in a spot of plagiarism from the Strathspey
and Badenoch Herald who have also been playing about with acronyms.
Inverness, they say, means It's No' Very Exciting Right Nuff Even
Saturdays and Sundays.
Apologies
DEPT of Getting It Wrong, Again: In our story about the Wishing Trees
at the Botanic Gardens, we said the artist was Tanya Harding when it
should have been Tanya Paget. We would like to apologise to Tanya Paget
and Tanya Hardings everywhere.
THE Diary has always thought of the women of Dublin as gentle souls.
Modest, demure, almost nuns in plain clothes. We were shocked,
therefore, by the forthright language in the above advertisement from
the Encounter section of the Sunday Times. GSOH, by the way, means good
sense of humour. Note even the nice lady who takes the adverts at the
Sunday Times could tell us what MDGT stands for. Perhaps it's the kind
of car the ideal man should drive.

A SUMMER of 24-hour stoppages by train drivers is looming following
the rejection of a ''final'' 3% pay offer from British Rail.
The eight man executive of locomen's union Aslef, meeting in emergency
session late last night, decided unanimously to call an industrial
action ballot within an hour of negotiations ending.
The executive of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union meets this
morning and is also expected to call an industrial action ballot in
support of its 6% claim.
Aslef's 15,000 members will receive ballot papers next week asking
them if they are prepared to take industrial action in the form of a
series of 24-hour stoppages to achieve a percentage increase over and
above inflation.
The results of the ballot will be known towards the end of June, with
industrial action likely to begin in early July. Aslef general
secretary, Mr Lew Adams, explained that his executive had decided
unanimously that the 3% offer did not meet the members' aspirations.
He stressed that a dispute involving his members would bring massive
disruption to the entire rail system. Unlike last year's signal workers'
dispute, there could be no question of managers and supervisors filling
the gaps. Trains would not move without Aslef members in the cabs.
They had already voted 69% for industrial action in a consultative
ballot in which more than 50% of the members participated.
Mr Adams also expressed concern that the Government might be
deliberately looking for an excuse to blame somebody else for the
failure of its rail privatisation plans and, to this end, was not
prepared to allow BR to make a realistic offer.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said he was very dissatisfied
that BR was offering what was, in reality, a pay cut, in that it did not
even match inflation. He would be reporting to his executive today but
was ''definitely not inclined to recommend acceptance''.
Mr Richard Rosser, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staff
Association, said he sensed the ''heavy hand of political interference''
in the rail pay talks. His executive would be meeting next week to
consider this unacceptable offer.
BR personnel director, Mr Paul Watkinson, said the offer was ''fair''
in all the circumstances of our industry. It reflected the contribution
made by staff over recent difficult times.
The business was just recovering from the effects of the recession and
of last year's signal workers' strikes. He added that the offer to the
77,000 BR workers was in line with other public-sector settlements and
generous in comparison with some.
In what are expected to be the last central negotiations before BR
bargaining units are fragmented in readiness for privatisation, the
unions had been stressing the marked discrepancy between performance
bonuses of 21.9% paid to executive board members over the last year, and
the increases of between 1.5% and 2.5% received by their members, whose
productivity has increased by 5.2%, helping to contribute to a forecast
operating profit of #400m.
Current basic rates vary from #149.65 for a rail operator, to #181.20
for a senior conductor, and #215.90 for a train driver, all working a
39-hour week. Average earnings across all grades are #329.70 for an
average 48.2-hour working week.

FROM Monday, train drivers on the Fort William run will be spending as
much time in a taxi as they do at the engine's controls.
ScotRail's reason is that, anticipating the sleeper service's closure,
it made drivers based in Fort William redundant.
A driver and a conductor will have to be taken the 90 miles from
Glasgow to Fort William by taxi.
However, that is just the start. The journey counts as the crew's
working time, so they will only have time to drive the train to Dalmuir,
just outside Glasgow, where another crew will be sent out by taxi from
Queen Street to take over.
The first crew will then take another taxi from Dalmuir to Queen
Street in order to finish their shift.
Union officials who have seen the new duty rosters have said it is a
terrible waste of public money.
Mr Pat O'Connor, Scottish secretary of the train drivers' union,
Aslef, said: ''I think its diabolical. The taxi is totally unnecessary.
It's a case of management trying to inflate the subsidy to passengers on
the West Highland line to try to justify their attempts to withdraw the
sleeper service.
''The drivers have not been consulted but they have no alternative
other than working it.''
ScotRail's taxi travels begin with the crew taking a taxi at 3.40pm
from Queen Street. It is estimated that the taxi will complete the
journey by 6.15pm.
After attaching the train to the engine at Fort William the crew will
leave the Highland town at 7.45pm and reach Dalmuir at 11.40pm, where
the next taxi will return them to Glasgow to clock off at the end of
their shift.
Meanwhile, a second crew who started work at 10.30pm will take a taxi
at 11.05pm, according to the precise times in the duty roster, to meet
the train at Dalmuir, where they take it on to Edinburgh.
They then bring a train back from Edinburgh to Dalmuir, where another
taxi takes them back to Queen Street.
That is not the end of ScotRail's taxi saga. Crew number three leaves
by taxi at four in the morning to reach Dalmuir in time to take the
north-bound train on to Fort William.
On arrival there at 9am, yet another taxi is hired to return them to
Glasgow for the end of their shift at mid-day.
A ScotRail spokesman conceded last night that it was not a ''terrific
solution'' but that it would be reviewing the operation after the appeal
court rules on the future of the sleeper service on June 1.
He pointed out that they could not have foreseen when they negotiated
the voluntary severence months ago that Highland region was going to
step in with a court order to halt the planned closure of the sleeper
service. He was unable to speculate what ScotRail would do if it lost
the appeal.

MICHAEL TUMELTY'S article, Opera in stranglehold, raises a number of
important issues (May 24). But before addressing these, may I correct
some factual errors?
Last week the Scottish Arts Council announced the formation of a
working group of Scottish Opera, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra,
and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra to investigate ways in which the
three organisations could collaborate in order to meet their artistic
and financial needs within known levels of resources. That statement was
approved by all three organisations before it was issued.
Michael Tumelty implies the working group was ''summoned'' by the
Scottish Arts Council. Not so. The three companies came together
voluntarily out of a perceived need to seek joint solutions to the
financial difficulties they all face. It was also they, and not the SAC,
who identified Sir Lewis Robertson as a distinguished and knowledgable
independent chairman.
And what are these difficulties? That Scottish Opera faces a continual
battle to make ends meet is well-known. Also well-known is the fact that
its orchestra is underemployed by about 50%.
The Scottish Arts Council makes no apology for questioning the use of
public money on an underemployed resource. That is one of our main tasks
in life.
If Michael Tumelty thinks that 50% is not an under-use it might help
him to know that this under-use is worth about #600,000, equivalent to
our annual grant to the Citizens' Theatre, or combined grants to the
Eden Court Theatre in Inverness, the MacRobert Arts Centre in Stirling,
and the Tramway in Glasgow.
Neither are the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and Scottish Chamber
Orchestra having an easy time. As with Scottish Opera, costs are rising
while audiences are not and public funding is virtually static. Like
Scottish Opera, they too have spare capacity and could do more.
They and we would be failing in our duties if we didn't explore all
ways for these organisations to work together for survival. That
survival may well mean change for the companies and for the people who
work for them.
No-one likes change, especially when people's livelihoods are
involved, but what organisations have not had to go through change in
recent years? Are arts organisations to be exempt? The first stage in
grappling with these problems is to meet and examine them.
What will come out of these deliberations? Deadlock perhaps and the
conclusion that their respective programmes cannot be changed
sufficiently to accommodate each other's needs and still fulfil their
basic obligations to the public; an elegant solution perhaps where
resources will be deployed to the full and more will be provided for the
same money; or perhaps partial progress towards greater co-operation and
more productive use of resources.
That might need time to develop and mature, during which it would be
the task of the Scottish Arts Council to help bridge the gap from where
we are now to where we want to be.
In that sort of situation, we make no apology for being ''enablers''
-- a role so contemptuously dismissed by Michael Tumelty.
The Scottish Arts Council has an agenda for the future of Scotland's
main musical organisations but it isn't the one that Michael Tumelty has
dreamt up.
Our agenda is to maximise the Government's grant to the arts -- no
easy task in these days of austerity in public expenditure -- and to
distribute that money among the artistic community as fairly as possible
guided by the Charter for the Arts in the matter of priorities; to
encourage companies to be resourceful and independent; to ensure to the
best of our ability that public money is not wasted; and above all to
try to ensure that the Scottish public have the range and quality of
arts activity that they deserve.
No ego trips, no hidden motives, no favourites.

ON behalf of Fort William and District Chamber of Commerce may I, as
chairman, take issue with the comments contained in John Macleod's
article (May 23)?
It is typical of the genre that a journalist on a two-day visit to his
birthplace should take such a narrow-minded and possibly nostalgic view
of the area.
While we would not disagree that the loss of employment due to major
employers closing or reducing their staff has been a blow to our area,
demoralised or sad is hardly applicable.
The unemployment average for Scotland is 8.3%, for Lochaber 7.8%.
While not satisfactory, hardly bordering on disastrous.
The tourist industry is not in steep decline, but it is a changed
industry from 20 years ago. Your correspondent managed to avoid the
Nevis Range development altogether.
No doubt some employers offer low wages; however, many others pay a
fair remuneration and retain their staff year-to-year. If John Macleod
had spent less time ''chatting up'' two waitresses and spent more time
speaking to local people he might have found that a vibrant and
successful side to his article was required.
Finally, what are the ''associated ills'' to which he refers? We do
not have anything like the problems facing those in urban areas, and as
a native of Glasgow, maybe I should visit my home city for 48 hours and
do a comparison on ''associated ills''.
We are facing enough problems with Mr Ellis and the ScotRail mystery
trains without a 48-hour expert on Lochaber (native or not) denigrating
our area.
I have no doubt that Mull and Iona, having faced the same treatment,
will wish to respond. However, the chamber will be delighted to conduct
Mr Macleod on a tour of Lochaber's finer points should he decide to
grace us again.

BUSINESSWISE the Highlands go into hibernation every winter. Violent
gales, and the fishing industry ceases, crofting husbandry is reduced to
sustaining as many animals alive as low temperatures and sear pastures
permit, and the tourist industry ceases altogether.
How then can the Labour Party insist on a minimum wage of #4 per hour?
Businesses with an income for only six months of the year, and that
varying from month to month, could not afford to employ staff at #192
per week.
Some small businesses at the beginning and end of the season don't
even have #192 as turnover, let alone profit margin.
Hotels are increasingly taking on students as they cannot afford
permanent adult staff, and when the schools open the hotels close down,
dealing a near-terminal blow to late tourism.
Local government, paying wages of #3.68 per hour now, would be
hard-pressed to increase to #4 across the board, without increasing the
council charge or reducing staff.
An economy living a hand-to-mouth existence, albeit cheerfully, would
be dealt another blow.
The unionist parties, all of them, are unable to accept or understand
that conditions -- fiscal, climatic, cultural -- vary across an island
some 1000 miles long but insist on legislating to capture votes south of
the Border where the human majority live. This nearly destroys
minorities strung out on the periphery.

SCOTTISH Children's Act view with dismay the pronouncements made over
the dispute involving the young Spanish child, Lucia Cortes.
It's not often that we feel that a judge has fulfilled his office
wisely but this time Lord Cullen has made the only sensible decision
possible and, indeed, the only legitimate one to make under the Hague
and Luxembourg Conventions on child abduction.
Particularly unedifying has been the stance taken by Tom Clarke, MP.
He has stated that the Children Act, 1989, should take precedence over
the international Hague Convention.
Mr Clarke should be told that the whole point of international
treaties is that nations agree that these override their own national
laws. Further, the Children Act (England and Wales), to which Mr Clarke
refers, does not apply to Scotland.
The Children (Scotland) Bill is wending its way through Parliament at
this very moment, six years later than its English counterpart. The
further tragedy is that the clauses which affect the 14,000 Scottish
children involved in family breakdown each year have received only scant
attention, compared with the other clauses dealing with the far smaller
number of children affected by alleged child abuse.
This Bill has been effectively hijacked by those professionals who
work in, and have carved substantial careers out of, the child-abuse
industry.
Family law in Scotland is the single biggest abuser of children we
have. We need MPs who will stop rattling sabres and deal with this
urgently.
A suggested starting point to educate these MPs is the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
When this is coupled with the United Nations International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights and also with the European Convention on
Human Rights and when all these are set beside the Children (Scotland)
Bill, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find many clauses in
the Bill which will hold water.
It looks increasingly likely that this Bill is going to receive Royal
Assent while still breaching all legally binding international
agreements.

ON your front page on May 24, you carried a story about the Scottish
Arts Council's handling of a Glasgow University report into the
socio-economic position and views of artists in Scotland.
The story turned on the council's publication of an edited and
rewritten version of the original study. Your story contained
accusations, by a representative of the Scottish Arts Council, of
''muddle'' and ''exceeding the brief'' in relation to the form and
content of the original report.
As the senior members of the research team who carried out this study
we know that both these accusations are quite untrue. As prominently
carried in The Herald they constitute a clear attack on our professional
competence. Moreover, they seek to deflect attention away from the real
reasons why a ''sanitised'' version of this study is all that is being
circulated.
The truth is that for a relatively small amount of money we carried
out a virtually unique and high quality piece of research for the Arts
Council. They recognised this.
We have a letter from the council dated November 28, 1994, which says:
''We are very pleased with the final draft of the report as it now
stands . . . It really is an excellent report.'' We have a letter from
the council dated February 10, 1995, which says: ''I would like to thank
you for the final copy of the research report, which we have now
received, and to congratulate yourself and the rest of the research team
for an excellent piece of work.''
We never received any indication that they thought our work was
''muddled'' or any suggestion that we had ''exceeded the brief''.
In fact, we followed closely the brief handed to us. Among other
things the council wanted the research to ''identify objectively and
examine the key problems affecting to professional lives of artists'';
to ''help review the SAC's current methods of assistance to individual
artists''; and to ''present the views of artists themselves on the SAC's
schemes of provision, their use of SAC schemes, and their proposals for
new initiatives''.
Such aims might be thought likely to engender some criticisms of
Government policies towards arts funding in Scotland and of the council
itself.
We liaised with top council officers the whole way through the
project, including the construction of the questionnaire we used. They
had every opportunity to indicate if the final set of questions exceeded
their requirements. They never did.
They did not express any major criticisms of the conduct of the study
but were worried by some of the results it produced, particularly those
which detailed artists' criticisms of the procedures and performance of
the Scottish Arts Council.
So we reject any suggestion or hint that the Scottish Arts Council
edited or rewrote the original report because they detected some flaw in
our research methods or in the way we wrote up our findings.
This seems to be a case of trying to blame the messenger for the
message, and the basic message, some of which the council is trying to
conceal, came from the actors, dancers, musicians, singers, visual
artists, and writers of contemporary Scotland, conveyed through a
well-planned and well-executed study of their circumstances and views.
We would be quite content for the merits of our original report to be
tested by submitting it to public scrutiny.

A Sexual Health Help clinic providing contraception and advice on
sexual health for teenagers on Saturday afternoon opened at Claremont
Terrace, Glasgow, last week. This clinic is not creating a demand but
meeting a need which already exists.
We are sorry that M D Willis has gained the impression that youth
volunteers will be dispensing advice, clinical or otherwise (May 23). We
would like to assure readers that they will not.
The youth volunteers are there to help with reception duties only, in
an attempt to make the atmosphere of the clinic less intimidating. They
give their time freely and their support is much appreciated. All the
medical and counselling services are supplied by trained staff.
Staff at the service are very well aware of genuine concern of parents
and others over such sensitive issues as advice on sexual health. We
would like to emphasise that the clinic is not just about handing out
free contraception, but providing information which will empower young
people to make their own decisions and behave responsibly towards
themselves and others.
Young people's physical sexual health cannot be disembodied from their
emotional and psychological well-being. The service of the clinic,
therefore, has a heavy emphasis on counselling and provision of
information.

WHEREVER did John Macleod obtain his information about the Mull
Clearances (May 23)? ''Last century Mull was savagely cleared by Maclean
of Duart . . . ''
The lands of Maclean of Duart were forfeited back in 1692, leaving
nothing until 1911, when Duart Castle and 300 adjoining acres were
bought from Torosay estate by General Sir Fitzroy D Maclean, the then
chief. John Macleod's statement is both nonsense and harmful.
He would have been correct to blame MacLaine of Lochbuie for a lot of
highly unsocial activities, but they were confined to the south-east
corner of Mull. About 12 Mull lairds share the guilt of some incredible
clearances.
If John Macleod writes such sweeping statements for dramatic effects
he should at least base them on facts, or obey the writer's dictum of
selecting subjects whose details hurt nobody and cannot be disproved.

IT would be a valuable thing to mend fences with the Hispanic world,
with huge trade and other benefits.
John Macleod suggests (May 16) the hand-over of the Falklands to
Argentina. I advocate instead the hand-over of Gibraltar to Spain. The
way to do it is to offer each adult resident of Gibraltar the sum of
#50,000 as compensation for the acceptance of Spanish rule, and to hold
a referendum on this proposal. Spain and Britain would share the bill.
We could be out of Gibraltar on the same day as the withdrawal from
Hong Kong, namely, July 1, 1997. Otherwise, the dispute will drag on as
before, decade after decade.

<TEXT>
NOBODY is above the law of the land, yet it remains a fact that
various groups and individuals appear to be perceived as less culpable
in their wrong-doing than others. This has been especially true in the
issue of sportsmen and violence. Mr Duncan Ferguson has appealed his
sentence, but it seems likely that its severity is as much due to his
previous convictions for assault as to the seriousness of the incident
which brought him to court. The suggestion that he has been given a jail
sentence because he is in a prominent position, looked up to by young
people, is unattractive in common sense, though apparently not in law.
It seems unfair that a footballer is required to bear himself like a
hero while a politician or journalist is not. Nevertheless the entire
Ferguson affair raises fundamental questions about the relationship of
the law to contact sport, and whether legal jurisdiction should hesitate
at the touchline. There are plenty of areas of our normal life in which
normal behaviour and rules appear to be suspended or responsibility
transferred, but in which the sanction of law is, and always should be,
present. We may send our child to school, during which time the
responsibility for the child is in the hands of the teachers.
Nevertheless, it would be ridiculous to argue that because the school
has jurisdiction during school hours the parents' responsibilities
cease.
Similarly, when Mr Ferguson ran out in the strip of a Scottish team to
play football he was indulging in an hour-or-so of robust physical
action. The rules of the Scottish Football Association hold sway over
this, but it is equally ridiculous to say that because Park Gardens
imposes and polices rules and regulations on play, the normal bounds of
lawful behaviour can be suspended. Drawing the distinction between a
hard tackle and an assault is, of course, a difficult matter. Although
nasty things can be done with a booted foot, the majority of them do not
constitute assault. There have been recent cases of court action taken
against the perpetrators of tackles which have been alleged to have
ended footballing careers through dreadful injury. These have been cases
under civil law and have involved the notion of compensatory damage.
Although it is true that anyone running up to a person in the street and
kicking him hard enough to fracture bone and ligament would be guilty of
an assault, in the context of a football match this sort of action is
more appropriately dealt with by the courts as a matter of compensation.
Against this, it can be argued that a head-butt, a punch, or stamping
on someone lying on the ground, can be taken as nothing other than a
criminal assault, whether it happens on the football pitch or on the
street. It is the precise action of assault which is the determining
factor, and if this commonsense rule-of-thumb is used, it should be
relatively simple to see situations in which the police and
procurator-fiscal are required, and those in which football rules and
the possibility of compensation are more appropriate. All of this raises
serious questions for the game of rugby which is substantially more
violent than football will ever be. The exchange of punches, head-butts,
and stamping are much more prevalent in rugby than they will ever be in
football, and if the rule of law finds Mr Ferguson guilty of assault it
must be prepared to do the same to rugby players all over the country.
This thought should not paralyse sportsmen and their administrators, but
simply make them more responsible.

Russell Edmunds reports that President Clinton's influence in Irish
politics is fuelling both hope and suspicion in Ulster as the hard
bargaining gets under way
NOT since the days of John Kennedy has an American President had such
a strong Irish profile. Indeed, given the depth of Bill Clinton's
involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, he has become an even
more influential figurehead for Irish America, though, in contrast to
the Kennedy clan, he has no emerald roots whatsoever.
The story of how the former Arkansas governor forged an unlikely
relationship across the Atlantic really began with promises he made
before his election to the White House. To be a successful Democratic
candidate he needed to cultivate the Irish vote and be assured of the
total support of the likes of Senator Edward Kennedy.
Clinton the candidate promised a ''peace envoy'' to Ulster but Clinton
the President could not deliver because the British Government and
Ulster Unionists argued such an appointment amounted to unwarranted
political interference in the UK's internal affairs.
Stymied by such objections, the President contented himself with a low
profile on Ireland but managed to place a powerful Irish-American name
in Dublin. The new US ambassador, Mrs Jean Kennedy-Smith, sister of Ted
and the late President, did not see the job, as so many of her
predecessors had, as a sinecure in exile.
The US ambassador's residence, a palatial mansion in Dublin's Phoenix
Park, is now adorned with family photographs and other memorabilia from
the Kennedy era. More than that, it has become a focal point for
nationalist Ireland's search for a solution to the Ulster problem.
According to diplomatic sources, Mrs Kennedy-Smith, through her
brother Ted, exerts a degree of influence on the White House that even
stretches to personal phone calls to the President. In contrast, Admiral
William Crowe, ambassador to the Court of St James, is said to have more
formal and distant dealings, sticking to the protocol of his office. As
a result, the relationship between the two American office-bearers in
London and Dublin is said to be cool, to say the least.
Geographically, Northern Ireland falls within the remit of the UK, of
Admiral Crowe and his vice-consulate office in Belfast. In practice, Mrs
Kennedy-Smith takes an almost obsessive interest, even to the point of
having one of her daughters spend a year at university in Londonderry.
So, although the President did not achieve his ''peace envoy'' plan,
his appointment in Dublin has swiftly become the next best option,
especially as Mrs Kennedy-Smith and her famous brother have developed
strong Irish friendships, most notably with the leader of Ulster's
Social Democratic Labour Party, John Hume.
At the time Clinton entered the White House, Hume was already deeply
embroiled in building the foundations of today's ceasefire, persuading
the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, that the best road ahead for Irish
nationalist aspirations lay through an end to violence.
According to a document which is believed to have been circulated in
the past year to IRA units, the argument for the ceasefire is based on
what Adams accepts as a remarkable ''convergence'' of people and events
at this moment in Irish history.
First, Britain had indicated a ''neutral'' stance on the future of
Northern Ireland, stating that it was up to the people there to decide
their political destiny. The Tory Government made clear it would not
stand in the way if a majority now, or in the future, chose to break the
British link and join in a united Ireland.
Secondly, the interests of Britain and Ireland were converging in the
new Europe in which the governments of London and Dublin were no longer
old enemies but modern trading partners. European nations were broadly
supportive of breaking down barriers in Ireland and the land border
between north and south had all but disappeared from an economic point
of view.
Thirdly, in John Hume Ulster's nationalists had a formidable figure of
international influence, who together with Adams, and the former Irish
premier, Albert Reynolds, could exert a co-ordinated and cohesive
pressure for political change in Northern Ireland that did not exist
before.
Finally, but not least, America had a Democratic President who could
not afford to ignore his Irish lobbyists, of which the chief was Edward
Kennedy, briefed and greatly influenced by John Hume.
So President Bill Clinton has found himself drawn increasingly into
the problems of Northern Ireland, to the point where this week he has
hosted an unprecedented investment conference on the province.
Whatever reluctance the British Government may have about American
involvement, it appears to have given way to an acceptance that the
White House has a major role to play in Ulster's future.
This is particularly so on two counts -- the leverage that it can
bring to bear on Sinn Fein, and thus indirectly on the IRA, and
secondly, the extent of new investment that can be attracted from across
the Atlantic to the hard-pressed economy of Northern Ireland.
No matter how much the Unionists dislike the welcome mat at the White
House for Gerry Adams, they cannot afford to ignore the prospect of more
funds from America and more jobs for Ulster as a result.
The President's Ulster conference represents another important
milestone in the peace process but now the hard talking and bargaining
must begin. There is considerable optimism in Belfast that a new
economic era has dawned in which transatlantic tourists and investors
will be welcomed instead of scared away by terrorism. But, on the
political front, no quarter has yet been given by any of the major
players.
While Bill Clinton will take credit for helping to broker the peace
and this week's gathering in Washington of Unionists and nationalists,
British Ministers and Sinn Fein figures under one roof, finding a
settlement between them all remains a long way off.
No guns or explosives have been handed over by the IRA or Loyalists.
No prisoners have been set free by the authorities. Sinn Fein's agenda
looks uncompromising and unacceptable to London and even more so to
Ulster Unionists. Despite nine months of peace, reconciling
Irish-nationalist and British-Unionist interests looks a very difficult
long-term exercise.

THE breakdown of the talks aimed at ending the fighting in Chechnya,
the breakaway republic in the Russian Caucasus, is regrettable but
hardly unexpected. The discussions, under the auspices of the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) was the
first serious attempt to bring the two sides together since President
Yeltsin sent in the Russian Army early last December. That the talks
took place at all was, as both sides confessed, a sign of hope, though
their abrupt ending elicited some bitter remarks from the main Chechen
representative, the republic's former Chief Prosecutor, Usman Imayev,
who has not previously been identified as a close supporter of the
Chechen leader Dzhokar Dudayev. Mr Imayev's appearance was no doubt
designed to advertise Chechen solidarity but the the Russian side also
contained representatives of that part of the former administration
which is backed by Moscow. Their presence is a reminder that Chechen
opinion is divided, but in fact the fighting has had the effect of both
widening and deepening support for independence.
The Russian Army seems to have imposed itself on the country's
lower-lying districts, though sporadic fighting does still occur there.
The uplands are still being contested and the probability is that the
continuing Chechen resistance will be confined to the mountainous
regions where the terrain favours guerrilla fighting and imposes
penalties on conventional forces. These facts did not prevent the
original nineteenth century of Chechnya nor save the Chechens from mass
deportation (for helping the Nazis) in Stalin's time: it is a tall order
for a very small people successfully to confront the Russian state in
any of its guises, past and present. At least the talks show some
willingness to talk. That was progress when set against the earlier
Chechen line that there could be no discussions without prior Russian
agreement to withdraw without any conditions.
There is something repellent at the way in which a great power seeks
to bomb and kill into submission those it claims to be its own citizens,
hence the role of international opinion in condemning the Russian
conduct of the war. It was, however, preceded by two and a half years of
negotiation in which the Chechens proved to be remarkably obdurate. The
Russian view is that they cannot simply permit declarations of secession
from every ethnic group and autonomous region in the country. What they
were willing to offer was a generous measure of autonomy, a formula
which in other, West European, countries like Spain and Italy, proved to
be successful. Now that Chechen national sentiment has been so
stimulated by the fighting, and its murderous consequences, it may seem
hard to resurrect that approach but some variation of it might offer
each side the compromise which they are apparently willing to
contemplate.
The OSCE is said to have proposals for a resolution of the war but in
the nature of things these have not been made public. Diplomacy is best
conducted in secret (though many in the West believed the very reverse
after the Treaty of Versailles following the First World War). The
process of give and take is so easily misunderstood by the mass
audiences outside, so sensitive to imagined slights and concessions,
that the process is best concealed until a whole package can be
presented. The minimum the Chechens could accept would be full autonomy
and self-government short of formal independence. The Russians seem
unlikely to be able to concede more since many other minorities with
tiny territories might be impelled to advance the same claim and
fragment the country even more.

THIS is a big week for sixties nostalgia, as Harold Wilson's death
prompts my age-group to piece together the personal fragments of a
decade which blew away at least some of the encumbrances of British
society.
For anyone much below 40, images of Wilson meeting the Beatles must
have all the relevance which pictures of the Second World War had for us
in 1968 -- and that wasn't very much at all. Yet there is something very
reassuring, even inspiring, about the Wilson memorabilia.
It is a little like having a picture of Celtic's European Cup-winning
team on the wall. Irrespective of whether one was even born at that
time, here is evidence that there was once a better age. That encourages
us in turn to believe that there could be another one just around the
corner.
Politically, that is a necessary reminder. The generation which has
grown up under Mrs Thatcher and her successor has low expectations of
government as a force for good. The right even to make demands of it has
been unnaturally repressed by a weary awareness that they will go
unanswered.
An incoming Labour Government will not, any more than Wilson's, meet
all the expectations which are piled high at its door. But the first
great achievement will be to liberate expectations and to put the
prospect of change, under a thousand different headings, back on the
agenda.
The legacy of legislation which survives from the Wilson era is
immense. Such vital inventions as the Highlands and Islands Development
Board, Overseas Development Agency, comprehensive education and that
great liberator, the Open University, are the obvious memorials.
But for the working people who supported Wilson, and overwhelmingly
approved of his record, the greatest achievements were in the granting
of rights which even now are largely untouchable -- health and safety
legislation, redundancy payments, equality, industrial tribunals,
earnings-related pensions. Change in heavy industries which were bound
to shed labour in the white heat of technology was managed humanely,
rather than sub-contracted to market forces.
The list is long and honourable. Collectively, it added up to just as
much of a cultural revolution as anything that was happening on campuses
or Carnaby Street. It also affected many more people for whom the
benefits have long outlived Harold Wilson's Governments.
For many of my generation, the Wilson Governments were not radical
enough. With the power of hindsight, that was partly because we had no
reliable yardstick against which to measure reasonable expectations.
With the Tories out, everything should have been possible -- but of
course it wasn't, at least not at one time.
How the circle turns. I remember a debate in Dundee University, just
after Jim Sillars had won South Ayrshire for Labour. I had a go at him
about the Labour Government's support for the Americans in Vietnam. He
rounded on me for concentrating on an issue which had not featured large
in the minds of the South Ayrshire electorate, and pointed to the list
of economic and social achievements which Wilson had delivered.
We were, I suppose, both half-right. There is no doubt that failure to
distance itself from the wicked war against Vietnam did dreadful damage
to Labour's standing with a significant minority of the electorate. But
a minority it undoubtedly was. Yet it became the most self-destructive
issue, undermining the integrity and very existence of a Labour
Government.
In fairness, history now tells us of the intense pressure which Wilson
resisted from the opposite direction, to involve directly British troops
in that war. Not a single Briton died in Vietnam. Would that also have
been the case under Mrs Thatcher or even Mr Heath? It seems unlikely.
There are plenty lessons to be learned from the Wilson years and the
difficulties which his Governments ran into. For me, both from
recollection and from reading the diaries, the biggest is that there is
no place for massive egos or plotting factions within a Labour
Government. How much of Wilson's time was spent on massaging the
sensibilities of prima donnas, both right and left?
He was a great man for the one-liners. Of all the repartee quoted over
the past few days, the anecdote I like best was about the little girl
who started crying while Wilson was addressing an election rally. The
mother went to take her out of the hall, but Wilson said: ''Leave her
where she is. It's her future we're talking about.''
Historians will judge the Wilson years far more kindly than the media
of the day ever did. The Labour Party already recognises that guilty or
opportunistic responses to the defeat of 1979, and the events which led
up to it, have dangerously obscured the many stories of achievement
which should also be proclaimed.
But the great parallel with 1964 lies in that parable of the little
girl at the election rally. For the first time in a generation,
government will be committed to a vision for the future and the
opening-up of opportunity for the many. The chance will arise afresh, to
persuade another sceptical generation that government can be a force for
good.
It is because of Labour Governments, not least those of Harold Wilson,
that I have had my opportunities in life. I want no less for my
children, nor for anybody else's children. Politics need not be
complicated, for it really is as simple as that.

* HAD political correctness been around in Viking days, the longboats
might well have been manned by ''Norsepersons''.
Certainly, today's Norwegian women show a daunting competitive edge,
occupying nearly a quarter of senior management posts and accounting for
more than a third of the country's MPs. In stark contrast, Scotland
boasts only two women company directors among the top 150, and women
here can expect to earn 71% of male wages, against 98% in Norway. The
arrival of another woman MP at Westminster will still leave a derisory
disparity.
These are just some of the telling statistics that will enliven a
conference sponsored by the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Royal
Norwegian Consulate in Edinburgh.
Business and trade union leaders from Scotland join public figures
from Norway to discuss equal pay and how women can influence
decision-making on prospects, education and welfare. The three-day
conference opens at the Hilton National Hotel, Edinburgh on June 15.
Further information from Norwegian Consulate phone 0131-226 5701.
A women's rights conference organised by Castlemilk Law Centre on June
3 has Helena Kennedy, QC, as keynote speaker. A free creche is provided.
Call 0141 634 6900.
A wider international forum on women's issues, at Stirling, is
expected to attract 300 visitors from around the world. Among speakers
at the International Womens' Studies Network Assocation conference are
Bea Campbell, Nell McCafferty and Joyce McMillan. For details of the
Desperately Seeking Sisterhood event (June 23 to 25) contact Millsom
Henry, Department of Applied Social Science, Stirling University --
01786 467703.
* IF you've been a victim of sexual harassment, Channel 4 would like
to hear from you. A documentary later this year will follow cases taken
to courts and tribunals and highlight problems faced by complainants as
they seek redress. Anyone with an action likely to be heard this year
who is prepared to share experiences is invited to contact Ben Power --
in strict confidence -- at Laurel Productions, 116-118 Grafton Road,
London, NW5 4BA, phone 0171-267 9399.
* AS well as sympathy, InterCity CrossCountry will dispense as much
free tea as passengers can consume this summer while their train is
stuck at a red light.
Long-distance services, like the Cornishman and the Devon Scot,
operating between Scotland and the West Country, are beefing up their
standards. Travellers who sign in advance for a CrossCountry Voyager
package will be pampered with at-seat service, complimentary meals and
as much tea and coffee as they can drink, in ''an air of tranquillity
often unseen in today's hectic world'' (claim the operators). First
class travellers can qualify for a third off the normal CrossCountry
fair on journeys over 50 miles with First Advance. Details from 0800 136
107.
* MAKE A DATE: Water of Leith clean-up starts 12pm from Saunders
Street, Jubilee Park, Edinburgh on Sunday. Wellies recommended.

Bruce McKain meets a modern judge who wants to see our legal system
stripped of the frills and delays which try the patience of witnesses,
juries and public
IF our judges are not careful they are in serious danger of losing
their membership of the Will Carling Club, which is reserved for boring,
out-of-touch old fuddy-duddies.
These days most of them are not really that old, and some are
expressing in public radical opinions that a few years ago they would
have kept to themselves, assuming such thoughts crossed their minds at
all.
Lord McCluskey, of course, has never been slow to publicise his
sometimes controversial views in speeches and newspaper articles, and
the untimely death of Lord Morton robbed the Bench of another judge who
spoke out fearlessly when he thought the system was failing the public.
He frequently criticised the way witnesses and jurors were mucked
about to suit the convenience of lawyers and condemned procedure in the
Court of Session as cumbersome, expensive and out of date.
That is a view shared by a number of current Scottish judges, and
articulated most recently by Lord Gill, who created something of a stir
by describing our civil justice system as a contemporary relic of a
vanished age and calling for a wide-ranging review with the public
interest as the paramount consideration.
It was a bold speech, delivered to solicitors at Gleneagles, because
at the time Brian Gill was the new boy on the Bench and might have been
excused for dipping his toe gently in the water rather than plunging in
head first.
But he does not fit the general public image of the judiciary of
Edinburgh New Town establishment.
He was brought up in Riddrie, in Glasgow, and his father, Tommy, an
insurance agent, was a professional saxophone player before the war. His
musical skill helped to fund his son's education at St Aloysius' College
and Glasgow University and the talent rubbed off to such an extent that
Brian Gill plays the organ to professional standard.
He and his wife Kate have brought up five sons and a daughter, aged
between 25 and 11, making it difficult to accuse him of being out of
touch with the attitudes and problems of the younger generation.
Instead of following the normal route of an apprenticeship with a firm
of solicitors, Brian Gill accepted a lectureship at Edinburgh University
and taught jurisprudence from 1964. However, he really hankered after a
career at the Bar and he put that ambition into effect three years
later.
He carved out a lucrative niche for himself by becoming a specialist
in agricultural law, a subject in which few of his colleagues were
interested at the time, and in 1982 published The Law of Agricultural
Holdings in Scotland, the lawyers' bible on the subject.
In 1979, he accepted the invitation to become a prosecutor in the
Crown Office, an experience which taught him how to present cases simply
and directly with the absolute minimum of embellishment.
He appeared for the next of kin at the Lockerbie inquiry which
effectively breached Pan Am's defences and rendered its position
hopeless in subsequent court cases in the USA.
Robert Black, professor of Scots law at Edinburgh University, devilled
to Brian Gill and remembers him as a devastating cross-examiner. ''He
didn't shout or bawl or lose his temper. He would destroy a witness with
a rapier thrust.''
Another former colleague at the Bar said: ''He's not concerned with
the pomp of the law. He wants things done as quickly and efficiently as
possible.''
The Liberal Democrat MP, Menzies Campbell QC, has been a close friend
of Brian Gill's since they arrived at the ordinary Greek class together
at Glasgow University in 1959.
He talks of his former classmate's ''high-octane mind'' and his
capacity for hard work. ''He's a man of great religious faith and a
rigorous intellect.''
As one of the Scottish Bar's most prolific earners, it cannot be
assumed that Brian Gill, now 53, would have jumped at the chance to
become a senator of the College Justice. The salary of about #100,000 a
year represents a huge drop.
But there were counterbalancing attractions. As one lawyer put it:
''The Bench does represent the logical culmination of a successful
career at the Bar, from arguing the law to actually declaring it.''
Judging from his Gleneagles speech, Lord Gill certainly does not see
his role as a passive arbiter at the mercy of the system.
''The impatience of the public is there to see. It is to be seen in
the frustrated client who asks the question ''When?'' It is to be seen
in the expert whose own search for the truth has become distorted by
forensic tactics; it is to be seen in the frustrated witness who spends
a day or more in an inhospitable waiting room only to be sent away.''
''If you were to sit down and start to work out a system today, it
would be nothing like the one we've got.''

ANGER over rail privatisation reached new intensity last night in
advance of cuts in sleeper and Motorail services taking effect this
weekend.
Mr Henry McLeish, Shadow Transport Minister, said the elimination of
Motorail would force 10,000 cars on long journeys back on to the road.
The cut in Anglo-Scottish sleepers from five to two also meant the loss
of seating used by thousands of passengers every year.
''Cuts in sleeper services show that rail privatisation is not about
improving services to passengers,'' he said.
He felt that there were serious questions about the behaviour of
British Rail's management over the appeal next week against the Court of
Session ruling that BR acted unlawfully in seeking to withdraw the Fort
William sleeper without consultation.
''They have conspired with the Government to escape the legal controls
and are also playing a game of 'pass the blame' in an effort to escape
responsibility,'' he said.
The Liberal Democrats' transport spokesman, Mr Paul Tyler, arrived in
Edinburgh yesterday on the Night Scot from his seat in the West Country.
The last such train to Glasgow and Edinburgh leaves Plymouth tonight.
''We will be seeking to ensure that any franchisee who takes over the
route next April be asked to reinstate this service,'' he said.
Campaigners from Storm (Stop This Railway Madness) yesterday unveiled
jewellery made out of bits of rusted metal which had fallen from the
Forth Bridge.
Co-ordinator Bill Wallace said: ''These were bits picked up from
beneath the bridge and, according to Railtrack, they don't exist.
''We think what's happening to the Forth Bridge is a symbol of
everything that is wrong with privatisation.''

The baked bean was a culinary masterpiece inspired by H J Heinz 100
years ago: Deedee Cuddihy seeks a modern verdict on his saucy creation
THE Herald caught the Heinz publicity people in London on the hop.
''Uh, yes, 1995 is the 100th anniversary of Heinz baked beans,'' they
admitted, ''but we haven't got the press release organised yet.''
In other words, readers, we have a scoop. Nobody else has noticed that
the tinned bean is 100 years old and what better way to celebrate the
centenary than with a taste test?
But first, some background information about the company and Henry
John Heinz himself, the man behind the 57 varieties which have now grown
to several thousand.
Apparently HJ, the son of German immigrants, started his food empire
when he was only eight years old and began selling vegetables to
neighbours from the family's garden in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At age
16 he had several employees and was supplying the city's grocery stores.
The business really took off when Heinz started selling horseradish,
not in the green glass bottles that competitors used so that goods could
be adulterated with turnip but in clear glass ones which meant that
customers could see exactly what they were buying.
Before beans, HJ created his ketchup which became and continues to be
Heinz's top selling product world-wide.
Although baked bean production began in 1895, it wasn't until 1901
that they became available in Britain where consumption is now higher,
at 550 million cans per annum, than in any other country. (Sweden is
second, followed by Bahrain and Dubai. Strangely, it seems that
Americans don't eat that many beans -- at least not of the Heinz
variety.)
It used to be that tinned baked beans were rather sneered at by folk
who professed to care about food but when it was discovered that beans
were not only cheap and convenient but provided impressive amounts of
roughage and protein as well, they became quite trendy.
These days, there are many varieties of tinned baked beans to choose
from and despite the fact that they're all made from virtually the same
ingredients, every brand tastes slightly different.
Personally, I'm not a fan of Heinz beans -- I find the sauce too sweet
and the beans too mushy -- but my friend, Jean, does and she and her
daughter Fiona usually have them once a week.
In a blind taste test, I wondered, could they tell which beans were
Heinz?
I bought a tin each of Heinz (30p), HP (30p), Whole Earth Organic
(62p) and a supermarket's cheapest own brand (13p) which Jean, Fiona and
Ali, their lodger, ate cold.
I had intended to include a sample of beans made at home from a
traditional American recipe but the result -- after hours of soaking,
boiling and baking in a slow oven -- was so disappointing (remarkably
like Heinz, only sweeter) that I threw them away.
The HP beans were the first out of the tin and none of the three
testers was impressed.
''Definitely not Heinz,'' they all said. ''Beans quite nice and firm,
sauce too thin and not sweet enough,'' said Fiona and Ali.
The organic beans, with a picture of a hoaky Wild West chuck wagon on
the label, were next.
Jean commented on their pale colour and the black flecks in the sauce.
''They're not Heinz, either,'' she said, ''but I like them.''
Ali guessed that they were the organic ones which she had eaten before
and preferred to other brands.
Fiona said: ''Yuk!''
While the Heinz beans were being tested Jean, a declared Heinz fan,
said: ''I don't like these -- they must be the cheapie variety.''
Ali didn't fancy them either but Fiona brightened up immediately,
correctly guessed they were Heinz and said she liked them.
Last was what Jean had described as the ''cheapie'' variety -- Safeway
Supersaver beans, in fact -- and both she and Ali said they were
excellent. Fiona agreed that they were good but said she still preferred
Heinz.
After a final taste, Ali came down in favour of the organic brand with
the Safeway beans a close second. Jean was of the same opinion until she
learned how much the organic ones cost.
''Sixty-two pence for a tin of baked beans!'' she exclaimed. ''It'll
have to be the Safeway ones, in that case.''
Fiona stuck to Heinz, of course.
It used to be
that tinned baked beans were rather sneered at by folk who professed
to care about food

Bucharest, Thursday
DRACULA fans descended on Romania today to track the vampire myth,
from Transylvanian tours to lectures on ''Garlic in a Magical World''.
The First World Dracula Congress has drawn a strange mix of academics,
historians, and the plain weird from Romania and around the world to
find out who Dracula really was, or is.
Some, Romanians in particular, want to debunk the vampire legend built
around Irish author Bram Stoker's Count Dracula, based on medieval hero
Vlad Tepes Dracula.
''I want to spike the Hollywood vampire,'' said Romanian-born American
historian Radu Florescu, whose lecture was titled ''What has the Dracula
Renaissance done for Romania?''
Others want to exploit the dark vision for all it is worth at the
expense of the real Vlad the Impaler -- a national hero who drove
Turkish armies out of Romania, often at the point of a spike, 500 years
ago.
''I want to promote tourism to Romania using Dracula as a drawing
point,'' said Roger Potdevin, 34, from New Jersey.
Some link the Dracula myth with other great mysteries of the world.
British academic Eileen Barker plans a lecture on ''Quest for the Count,
the New Age, and the Loch Ness Monster''.
Historians plan to draw parallels between Vlad and Romania's late
Stalinist ruler Nicolae Ceausescu, who banned all mention of the Dracula
vampire as portrayed in Stoker's book.
''Ceausescu, the old dictator, admired his own Dracula and he modelled
himself on Vlad the Impaler,'' said US academic and Dracula authority
Raymond McNally.
''Ironically, 513 years to the day after Prince Vlad was assassinated,
Ceausescu was killed at Tirgoviste, in a military barracks right across
from Vlad's palace.''
Romanian Nicolae Paduraru lauched the conference and founded the
Transylvanian Society of Dracula. A former travel agent, he dreams of a
tourist bonanza born from the Dracula myth.
However the tourism industry is already cashing in. Hotels sell #4
cans of pink ''Dracullina'' liqueur marketed as ''women vampires'
delight'', and ''Dracula's spirit'', a blood-coloured vodka sold for #17
a bottle -- five times its price on a Bucharest street corner.--Reuter.

Grozny, Thursday
PEACE talks between Russians and Chechen rebels broke down after four
hours today but a senior Russian official said the two sides had
resolved to keep negotiating.
The head of Moscow's civil administration in breakaway Chechnya, where
thousands of people have been killed in more than five months of
fighting, said more talks would be held once various hurdles had been
overcome.
''I think we can continue in the next few days,'' Nikolai Semyonov
said after the talks in Grozny, the shattered capital of the
predominantly Muslim region.
Chechen negotiator Usman Imayev, representing the rebel forces of
separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, told reporters no deal had been
reached on a ceasefire or on any other point.
''The main thing is talks have started, and that is already positive.
However, from what we saw today, the Russian side is not yet ready to
stop murdering peaceful civilians,'' he said.
The Chechens were ready for another meeting ''as soon as the Russians
are ready for further action'', he added.
The talks, mediated by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation
in Europe (OSCE), were the first serious attempt to resolve the conflict
since President Boris Yeltsin sent troops into the mountainous north
Caucasus territory on December 11.
Sandor Meszaros, who heads the OSCE assistance mission in Chechnya,
said there had been general agreement by all sides to meet again, this
time with military representatives.
The Russian side was led by Nikolai Semyonov, head of Russia's civil
administration in Chechnya, who was booed by a crowd of Chechen women
staging a demonstration.
''They will never take Chechnya. They may take the men, but they will
never take the women. We are a proud nation and we will fight to the
last,'' said Aminat Soslambekova, who said her 27-year-old sister had
been killed by shrapnel in February.
Grozny was quiet during the talks, although Interfax news agency
quoted Chechen sources as saying Russian armour had today tried to break
through rebel lines at Duba-Yurt, 35 miles south of Grozny.
The Russian military press service in Chechnya said its forces had
killed 123 rebel fighters in 24 hours. However casualty reports have
often turned out to be unreliable.
Lieutenant-General Mikhail Yegorov, commander of Russian forces, said
eight soldiers had been killed and 20 wounded.

AT LEAST seven people were killed and more than 20 injured today when
a time bomb exploded in south-east Turkey.
The bomb went off in the late afternoon by a kiosk near a primary
school in Batman town.
Anatolian news agency said the bomb had hurled bodies up to 100yd away
and that many of the injured lost their limbs.
Police said they had no information as to who may have planted the
bomb, but journalists said Batman was the scene of urban violence
between the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamist
Hizbollah (Party of God) militants.
Another explosion in central Batman had injured four people on
Tuesday.
More than 16,000 people have died since the PKK began fighting for
independence for Turkey's Kurds in 1984.
Today officials said 22 Kurdish guerrillas were killed by Turkish
troops and 45 others captured in several clashes in the east and
south-east of Turkey.--Reuter.

Moscow, Thursday
THE United States has lifted Cold War curbs on sleeping with the
enemy, allowing its diplomats to have ''intimate or romantic relations''
with Russians.
''The prohibition which formerly restricted employees of the mission
from establishing intimate or romantic relationships with Russians has
been revoked,'' said a US embassy spokesman.
He said Russia was the last state of the former Soviet Union still
subject to the restrictions on relationships with local citizens.
However he said members of embassy staff working in especially
sensitive work would still face curbs on relationships with Russian
citizens.
All Marine Corps staff at the Moscow embassy were pulled back to
Washington and Cold War restrictions reinforced in 1987 when Clayton
Lonetree, a marine guard in Moscow, fell in love with a Russian

Cairo, Thursday
WIDESPREAD Arab optimism, tempered by Israeli and Syrian caution,
today greeted Washington's news that Damascus and the Jewish state will
start negotiating security arrangements to follow any Israeli pull-out
from the Golan Heights it captured in 1967.
Egypt, traditionally forward-looking, said that the agreement bringing
Israeli and Syrian military experts together next month could lead to
peace between the two sides early next year.
''We hope this will lead to a real breakthrough,'' said Osama al-Baz,
political adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat also welcomed the agreement today, saying
he hoped it would bring comprehensive Middle East peace.
''We appreciate this. We had mentioned from the beginning that our
target was to have comprehensive, lasting peace, for a solution on all
tracks -- the Palestinian track, Jordanian track, Syrian track, and
Lebanese track,'' Arafat said.
In similar vein, Jordan, which last year joined Egypt as the only
other Arab state to make formal peace with Israel but which says only
comprehensive peace can bring lasting stability, welcomed the fact that
the two sides had breached their stalemate.
Foreign Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said Amman hoped this ''would
add a new brick to the foundation of peace and raise it to achieve Arab
aims to regain their rights''.
However the two main parties concerned in the advance, Syria and
Israel, were both wary of too much optimism.
''Syria welcomes any positive move which helps the peace process,''
Information Minister Mohammed Salman said in Damascus.
He cautioned however: ''Wide gaps are still there and a lot of work is
needed to bridge them.''
Work facing the military experts includes such contentious issues as
the depth of the demilitarised zones on either side of the border and
the nature of early warning systems.
In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, freshly stung from having to
make an embarrassing climbdown over plans to seize Arab land in East
Jerusalem, urged patience and perseverance.
He too described as wide the gaps with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
over the Golan Heights.
A spokesman for US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is to
return for yet another tour of the region shortly, announced the
agreement yesterday.
US officials, explaining their satisfaction with the accord, said it
was the first one reached directly between the two countries since they
launched peace talks in Madrid three-and-a-half years ago.--Reuter.

United Nations, Thursday
IN THE worst scandal in its history, the UN Children's Fund said today
that 24 employees in its Kenyan office stole or squandered #6.3m over a
two-year period.
The scandal, the most widespread since Unicef was founded in 1946,
consumed more than one-quarter of Unicef's #24m two-year budget for
Kenya, which covered about 300 full-time and temporary staff in eight
locations.
American Carol Bellamy, Unicef's new executive director, said the
fraud involved padded expense accounts, funnelling money to bogus
organisations, payment for non-existent services, double billing,
non-existent medical treatment, and collusion with banks and
contractors.
In addition, she said, auditors discovered gross mismanagement,
including excessive entertainment expenses, overstaffing, and poor
supervision.
Bellamy told a news conference that eight staff members had already
been dismissed and 15 had been charged with fraud and serious
misconduct, including two former directors of the Kenya country office.
''This is a serious blow to Unicef, which has a well-deserved
reputation,'' said Bellamy, the former director of the US Peace Corps.
* Environment Minister John Gummer joined other critics of the UN's
environmental agency today by saying it appeared to have become less
effective since the 1992 Earth summit in Brazil.
Complaints that the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) has
lost its way and a call by the United States for a cut of one-third in
its #100m budget have been made at this week's meeting in Nairobi of the
agency's governing council.
Mr Gummer urged Unep, the only UN agency based in Africa, to refocus
on its core tasks of monitoring the state of the planet, identifying
emerging issues, initiating global responses to them, and promoting the
development of international law.--Reuter.

Bonn, Thursday
A TOP-SECRET project in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s turned
soldiers and security agents into programmable ''human weapons'' and is
now being exploited by mobsters and private firms, it was claimed today.
The psychological weapon project relied on hypnosis and high-frequency
radio waves to turn members of the Soviet security forces and military
into fearless, conscienceless fighting machines, said a programme on
German television.
The Psychotronic Influence System relied on passwords and numbered
codes to activate its subjects.
After the KGB project's existence was made public hundreds of former
Soviet soldiers, police, and KGB members have sought health damages.
However the programme said some special Russian police units still use
the system today and it has found its way on to the free market, where
mobsters and private security firms are using it, the programme
reported.--AP.

DUNCAN Ferguson may consider himself hard done by after being hit with
the double whammy of a three-month jail sentence, as well as the
12-match ban he has still to serve for assaulting Raith Rovers defender
John McStay.
However, a brief glance at the way the law has been developing in
Scotland (and England) over the past dozen years or so, should have
warned him to expect the worst.
The once fondly-held belief that all was fair in love, war, and the
playing field has been well and truly booted into touch by the
increasing tendency of sportsmen to resort to violence, and the
determination of the criminal authorities not to let such behaviour go
unpunished.
The warning note was first sounded by Mr John McCluskey, QC, (as he
then was) when he was Solicitor General for Scotland in 1974.
Speaking at the biennial congress of the European Union of Football
Associations in Edinburgh, he said it was not the practice of the
criminal authorities to bring charges against players who misbehaved on
the park.
He added, however: ''The football authorities must keep in mind that
when one player attacks another with fists or feet, or both, a criminal
assault takes place.
''Unless the football authorities take effective steps to discipline
players and prevent such incidents, the time could come when those
reponsible for administering the criminal law might have to step in.''
The warning bells obviously didn't reach the ears of Rangers striker
John Macdonald, who was sent off for butting Aberdeen's Dougie Bell in
1983. The SFA meted out a four-match ban but the prosecuting authorities
took no action.
A few weeks later, a rugby player who stamped on an opponent's face,
causing a cut which required nine stitches, two broken teeth, and a
fractured nose, was fined #100 at Haddington Sheriff Court.
This was, apparently, the first time court action had been taken
following incidents on a Scottish rugby pitch.
England had already led the way in the area of sporting violence in
1978, when rugby player John Billinghurst was found guilty at Newport
Crown Court of inflicting grievous bodily harm on an opponent by
breaking his jaw in an off-the-ball incident. He received a nine- month
suspended sentence.
No doubt these developments were in the mind of Mr Peter Fraser, QC,
the Solicitor General for Scotland in 1986, when he announced what
seemed to be a change of policy on the part of the Crown Office.
He made it clear that if players behaved in a criminal fashion on the
field of play, they must be made aware of the criminal law.
Since then, there have been numerous cases of football and rugby
players in Scotland falling foul of the law and, in jailing Haddington
rugby player Scott McMillan for 60 days for a head-butt which fractured
an opponent's jaw, Sheriff Peter Hamilton made the legal position clear.
There are respectable arguments against the law getting involved in
what happens on the sports field. There is obviously the question of the
player being punished twice for the same offence, firstly by the
criminal authorities, and secondly by his sport's ruling body.
There is also the undoubted inconsistency being shown by the
prosecuting authorities in Scotland, which provides ammunition for
Ferguson supporters to claim that he has been unfairly singled out.
Why did a head constitute an assault when Rangers played Raith Rovers
at Ibrox in April last year, but not the following month when there was
a much more serious incident, captured by the TV cameras, at the Junior
Cup Final?
The answer lies, to a large extent, in the discretion given to the
procurator-fiscal to decide when to prosecute, but the impression has
been given that the law is not always being applied even-handedly.
What obviously influenced both the fiscal and the sheriff in
Ferguson's case was his three previous convictions for offences of
violence.
The fact remains, however, that if every violent incident on the field
of play were to be prosecuted, it would become a full-time job for the
enforcers of the law.
All the signs are that sport and the criminal and civil law will
become ever-more inextricably entwined because of the combination of
violent behaviour and a growing enthusiasm to resort to the courts.

THE Ferguson case raises again the questions surrounding the trend
towards the criminal justice authorities becoming involved in events on
the field of play, writes James Freeman.
The situation of the police and the Crown in Scotland is clear and
simple; they will take action against criminality wherever and whenever
it occurs. Action can be instituted by anyone -- the police themselves,
the procurator-fiscal, or by a member of the public who lodges a
complaint.
In the current case, the proceedings were started by the Glasgow
procurator-fiscal's office after the event itself was shown on
television. Ever the open and accountable guardians of the public
interest, the Crown Office yesterday refused point blank to discuss the
Ferguson case or its implications. The office of the procurator-fiscal
at Glasgow did not return calls on queries put to them by The Herald.
However, in the first and most celebrated of these cases, that of the
Old Firm clash in October, 1987, it was the then fiscal at Glasgow, now
Sheriff Sandy Jessop at Stonehaven, who personally started the
proceedings for disorderly conduct and breach of the peace which ended
with Chris Woods, Terry Butcher, and Frank McAvennie in court. He was
not present at the match but saw the rammy on television and asked the
police to investigate. Woods and Butcher lost subsequent appeals.
Mr Graham Bennett, deputy chief constable of Fife Police and chairman
of the general purposes standing committee for the Association of Chief
Police Officers for Scotland, made it clear yesterday that there is no
increased willingness on the part of the Scottish police to become
involved in on-the-field criminal conduct and there is no ACPOS policy
on it.
There has, he says, always been such a willingness.
Despite the dire warnings which have surfaced each time the criminal
justice authorities have taken a hand in criminal conduct during contact
sports, the feared spate of complaints from members of the public,
possibly fans of one team wishing to cause trouble for rivals, has,
according to police sources, never materialised.

Sarajevo, Thursday
NATO jets blasted Bosnian Serb military targets today and Serbs
retaliated fiercely by shelling five of Bosnia's six ''safe areas'',
including Sarajevo, directly challenging the Alliance to escalate the
conflict.
Six Nato warplanes pounded two ammunition bunkers near the Bosnian
Serbs' capital, Pale, after their army had ignored an ultimatum to
surrender heavy weapons seized from UN custody.
The Alliance's first strike for six months constituted the toughest
and most successful military action it has yet taken.
The Bosnian Serb reaction was rapid and deadly.
A Reuter television cameraman counted 10 bodies after a single shell
landed at a crossroads lined with restaurants and cafes in Tuzla, one of
the five UN ''safe areas'' hit within two hours this afternoon.
''There were 11 detonations in Tuzla and the airfield went to
condition red. There was one shell into Srebrenica, five into Gorazde,
and seven into Bihac,'' said UN spokesman Mr Alexander Ivanko.
The mayor of Tuzla sent word to Bosnian government officials in
Sarajevo that 50 people had been killed and many more wounded by Serb
shelling of the city.
The Serbs mocked Nato by firing heavy weapons from three UN weapons
collection depots around the city.
In Sarajevo, shelling continued for hours after Nato struck, and early
casualties included one woman and a child.
The Serbs were attacked after ignoring an ultimatum to return four
heavy weapons they seized from UN custody in heavy fighting in Sarajevo
this week. They were warned that they would be hit again unless they
cleared the hills around Sarajevo of illegal guns and tanks by noon on
Friday.
Nato said it had destroyed two Bosnian Serb ammunition bunkers near
the mountain resort of Pale, seat of the government of the
self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb Republic.
The strike force, which included aircraft from the United States,
Spain, France, and the Netherlands, had barely returned safely to base
when UN spokesman Fred Eckhard announced:''What we are looking for now
is that there be no weapons anywhere visible within the (Sarajevo)
exclusion zone except as controlled by the UN in designated collection
points. Anything less than that will bring on more air strikes.''
US Admiral Leighton Smith, commander of Nato forces in Southern
Europe, said his aircraft were available ''24 hours a day'' to respond
to any United Nations request for action''.
US President Bill Clinton led international support for the strike
against the Serbs, who are blocking international efforts to end the
war.
''I hope that today's air strikes will convince the Bosnian Serb
leadership to end their violations of the exclusion zone and comply with
their other agreements with the UN,'' he said.
Russia, an ally of Serbia, criticised the air strikes, saying the
action was one-sided and would do nothing to help end the conflict in
the divided republic.
Bosnian government leaders welcomed the attack as a move to restore
the credibility of the UN and the western alliance.
UN patience had been stretched by increased attacks on its
peacekeeping forces and heavy fighting in Sarajevo, a UN-protected area,
since the end of a ceasefire on May 1.
General Rupert Smith, the UN commander in Bosnia, issued the ultimatum
after six people were killed and 31 wounded during fighting on Wednesday
in which at least one phosphorus shell, banned by the rules of war, was
fired. -- Reuter

THE Scottish Football Association, which has been closely monitoring
the Duncan Ferguson affair, refused to comment yesterday on his jail
sentence while the possibility remained of a successful appeal.
Mr Drew Herbertson, head of the SFA's disciplinary and referee's
department, said: ''If the player has appealed against sentence it would
be inappropriate for me to comment.''
He added: ''Obviously there are ramifications for the SFA from what
has happened. The fact that a player has found himself being dealt with
in court for a footballing matter is something that concerns us.''
Referee supervisor Mike Delaney, who attended the Rangers-Raith Rovers
match and referred to the Ferguson incident in a detailed statement to
the SFA, was unavailable for comment.

SHOULD the Court of Appeal uphold or even increase Duncan Ferguson's
sentence -- a very real possibility which will, even now, be exercising
his counsel -- the errant striker will face an almost unimaginable
culture shock when the prison van takes him to Barlinnie.
Although he has already seen the inside of a cell, nothing could
prepare him for the Bar-L experience.
The Scottish Prison Service says Ferguson would be treated in exactly
the same manner as any other convicted man, in which case he would be
extremely uncomfortable in one of the prison's infamous holding cells --
''dog boxes'' to prisoners and staff alike.
These are tiny, a tight squeeze for any normal-sized adult, let alone
a broad, 6ft 4in athlete. They are also foul and claustrophobic and
utterly alienating for a first-timer; inmates have been known to suffer
panic attacks.
After an unsuccessful appeal, Ferguson would be taken direct to
Barlinnie -- the local prison for Glasgow Sheriff Court -- where his
clothing would be checked in by officers, his belongings logged and
stored, including his money and credit cards.
He would then be issued with prison clothing (denims and a striped
shirt) and a toilet kit and would then be made to shower. After that, he
would be given his prison number and told his release date which, in his
case, would be at half sentence -- in six weeks' time.
Ferguson would then be examined by a nurse officer and then later by a
prison doctor, trained to look for things such as head lice and assess
suicide risk.
It is after this that Ferguson would be introduced to the ''dog
boxes'', where he could be held for several hours until a cell is
allocated for him. He would almost certainly end up sharing, since
Barlinnie currently holds 1161 prisoners but has only 861 cells. Close
on 80 cells are out of commission for refurbishment.
Should he face any threat or harassment while in prison, he could ask
for protection which would involve him being removed from association
under Rule 80 of prison regulations. He might even be moved to another
prison, most probably Low Moss at Bishopbriggs.
There he would live in elderly, wooden-hutted accommodation along with
366 other prisoners, many of them undergoing alcohol treatment or drug
rehabilitation. He would share a dormitory with men who are right at the
bottom end of the criminal fraternity.
In Barlinnie, cells are unlocked between 6.30am and 7.30am and each
prisoner is seen by staff. Each flat in each hall has communal washing
in large sinks with no privacy. Ferguson would have to wash with around
200 other men.
Since the riots of the late 1980s, eating in dining halls is a thing
of the past. Food is brought round the halls on trolleys and prisoners
help themselves and return to their cells to eat.
Ferguson's prison day will go like clockwork:
* 8am-12 noon -- prison work, making concrete slabs or recovering
scrap metal.
* Noon-12.45pm -- lunch (soup and a roll, main course, and sweet).
* 12.45pm-1.45pm -- outdoor exercise (game of football?)
* 2pm-4.30pm -- back to work.
* 4.30pm-5.30pm -- teatime, back in the cell.
* 5.30pm-6.30pm -- lock-in to allow prison officers to have their
dinner.
* 6.30pm-8.45pm -- communal recreation, mostly television, though
satellite sport is popular.
* 8.45pm-9pm -- supper (usually tea and a bun).
Then back to the cell until the morning when its starts all over
again.
Barlinnie boasts a football pitch but Ferguson's employers might have
something to say about his appearing on that since it is red blaze --
ripe territory for injuries. Both staff and prisoners play in leagues in
Glasgow's East End, although the prisoners do not usually play games
away from home.
There would be no chance of Ferguson ending up cell-sharing with
Celtic supporters; at reception he will be asked his religion, an
age-old and wise precaution to avoid sectarian warfare on the wings, and
his religious allegiance is duly noted on the card on his cell door
along with his name, number, date of birth, and release date.

NATIONAL Lottery operator Camelot yesterday promised to come down hard
on shops selling tickets to children. It said any retailer found to have
knowingly sold tickets to people under 16 would have its contract
terminated.
The warning came after a survey showed that stores were flouting the
law by selling tickets and scratchcards to children as young as 12.
The charity Children's Express said 62% of retailers it visited in
London agreed to sell tickets to under-16s -- even in school uniform.
Law breakers included giant supermarket chains, convenience stores,
garages, and newsagents.
National Lottery regulator Oflot said it would expect Camelot to take
any allegation extremely seriously.
A Camelot spokeswoman said: ''We will investigate the situation and if
we find that the retailer has knowingly sold to anyone under 16 years of
age, or should have appreciated the age of the player, we will terminate
their contract.''
* A middle-aged husband and wife sipped mineral water today as they
picked up a cheque for #4,430,393 -- the Irish Republic's biggest
lottery winnings. The couple, who live on the north side of Dublin,
chose to remain anonymous.
The husband won the jackpot on May 17 and waited three days before
telling his wife. They told officials of the National Lottery company
that, ironically, two days later the husband received a notice informing
him that his credit card was suspended because of an outstanding bill.
The previous record jackpot won by a single person was #3,031,527.
This is the first jackpot using the Quick Pick system, in which players
can instruct the lottery computer to select their numbers.

FOUR Fife fishermen were pulled to safety from a liferaft during the
early hours of yesterday morning after their boat hit a barge laying
sewage pipes.
The 60ft Ocean Herald III was around half-a-mile west of Anstruther
when it was badly holed in the bow in the collision with the 200ft Dutch
barge and quickly began to take on water.
Skipper John McBain, 47, his 26-year-old son, Derek, Mr James Griffin,
of Newark Street, St Monans, and Mr Graham Boyter, of University Avenue,
Pittenweem, took to the liferaft as the vessel began to sink.
The Mayday alert was picked up by coastguards who launched the
Anstruther RNLI lifeboat.
Other vessels in the area, including a Dutch tug and the warship,
Dulverton, responded to the emergency broadcast shortly after 1am.
The lifeboat crew managed to pick up the four fishermen and take them
safely back to Anstruther harbour.
The tug, Bever got a line on board and was able to tow the stricken
boat back to harbour.
An investigation has now been launched.

A CELL door may slam shut on Scottish football's latest enfant
terrible Duncan Ferguson, but the game in general should not be allowed
to heave a sigh of relief and turn away from an unfortunate individual
who is aptly its own creation.
The truth is his tendency towards violent behaviour is endemic.
Football has been allowed to operate outwith the law for too many
decades and it was inevitable the police would reach in and impose
themselves. Sport is not above the law, but it has taken a painfully
long time for those involved in football to accept this.
Too many professional sports people who command outrageously lucrative
salaries believe themselves to be exempt from the rules and regulations
by which the rest of us must live, but they are not helped in any
attempts to maintain a balanced perspective when their behaviour, no
matter how disgraceful, is defended by managers and fans.
Clubs can not afford to lose key players for any lengths of time and
managers tolerate and make allowances for behaviour which they would not
allow in their own homes. Sometimes, as a consequence, the superstar
becomes uncontrollable. A monster is created in an environment which
draws from the passions and natural aggression of its participants and
performers.
Right and wrong blend until there are no discernible edges and when a
hand is felt on his collar the culprit wheels around as though an
innocent victim. The twisted sense of injustice is strengthened because
football's miscreants are never short of sycophants willing to speak out
on their behalf.
Ferguson is the latest in a long list of footballers who have fallen
foul of the law and although most were English, or foreigners playing in
England, the Scottish game is not beyond reproach. Terry Butcher, Chris
Woods, and Frank McAvennie all appeared in court after a fracas
involving several Old Firm players in a match at Ibrox in October 1987.
Football people seem incapable of learning.
The jail sentence handed down to Ferguson, however, is bound to have
serious implications for football and sport in general. Everyone should
understand a greater degree of control and responsibility over their own
actions and their own people must be exercised if the police are to
remain at a distance.
But where now should the line be drawn?
Should the police march on to a football pitch and have a word with a
player who may have mistimed a tackle and seriously injured an opponent?
If a tackle is seen as violent or reckless should that player not be
dealt with as he would if he had committed his act on the streets?
Rugby also has been dragged into courts with players seeking justice
against opponents who may have been reckless. While no-one should be
denied the right to use the legal system, sport would be disrupted
terribly by frequent intervention. Yet sportsmen and women are entitled
to protection from the police if their own administrations continually
fail them.
Yes, Ferguson deserved his punishment, but regular police intervention
would kill many sports, especially football in which physical attributes
are necessary.
Common sense and discretion will have to be applied but it would help
immensely if the SFA, which has been trying hard in recent years to
improve discipline, was given greater assistance by member clubs. The
association is not negligent but clubs are.
Managers and directors should make it absolutely clear they will act
swiftly and harshly to punish any players who step out of line. Fines
should be in proportion to the wages being earned. This is the message
they must send to the outside world if they wish to convince outsiders
that their sport can be controlled internally.
Ferguson's punishment has been severe. He suffered automatic
suspension and was fined by Rangers, who were his employers when he
assaulted Raith Rovers' John McStay. His jail sentence means he has been
dealt with three times. That will become four if the SFA tells the FA
that Ferguson, who now plays with Everton, must still serve an
additional 12-match ban which was put on hold until after the player's
court case.
It is harsh that someone can be punished so often for one incident,
but the bottom line is Ferguson should not have reacted to his opponent
in such a violent manner and the sooner all players realise primitive
reactions will not be allowed to pass the better. Players and managers
should stop bleating about referees and start working towards a game in
which fluent football is given priority.
Also, supporters must improve their behaviour. Attend any football
match in the country and you will see people of all ages being parted
from their sanity.
We are supposed to be living now in a more civilised society yet men,
women, and children still scream and curse at football matches. This
makes a mockery of the notion that football one day will become a family
sport.
Often behaviour in the stands is more alarming than anything that
occurs on the pitch. If the police are willing to intervene among
players they should also act when they witness threatening behaviour, be
it verbal or physical among the supporters.
Sadly, they do not always remove the cretins who can spoil a match for
decent fans and the more they turn a blind eye or a deaf ear the more
football grounds become gathering places for violent people.

A VET described by a judge as the most ''evil, selfish, and criminally
callous man'' he had sentenced was jailed for life yesterday and told he
must serve a minimum of 20 years for poisoning his wife.
David Ryan James, 40, of Stapenhill, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire,
pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife, Sandra, 38, mother of
their three children, and claimed she acted as a spurned wife and
committed suicide to make it look like murder when he was having an
affair with another woman.
A jury of eight men and four women at Stafford Crown Court took six
hours to reach its verdict after a 20-day trial.
James killed his wife in January 1994 while he was having a
relationship with the 33-year-old wife of a family friend who also had
three children.
After Mrs James's death, the other woman, Mrs Catherine Crooks, moved
into the house at Tower Road with her three youngsters to look after
James's three children.
The prosecution said that for several weeks Mrs James was fed
Immobilon -- a powerful drug used to anaesthetise horses -- in drinks of
orange juice and was also given phenobarbitone in place of an antibiotic
she used for a chest infection.
Mr Justice Hidden told James: ''You are as evil, selfish, and
criminally callous a man as I have ever had to sentence. You used your
knowledge and expertise in your career as a vet in which your wife had
supported and encouraged you, to put together a calculated and wicked
plan to end her life and take her from her children so that you could
afford to live with a woman you had chosen to replace her.
''You carried out a plot over a period of weeks before and after
Christmas, 1993. You abused the trust she had in you by giving her and
getting her to swallow over a period of weeks capsules containing
phenobarbitone.
''You used injections and swallowing by mouth thereafter as routes to
get these drugs into her body. You used phenobarbitone to render her
unable to stop you.''
The judge said he ''doubted very much'' whether a decision by James to
use the drug Revivon -- an antidote to Immobilon -- was a ''change of
heart''.
''I doubt very much whether you were reacting from that plan. If you
were, you very quickly went back to that plan and carried out her
execution.
''You had to kill her and you also had to insult and harm her memory
by making up an issue that she had committed suicide. That was a
diabolical plot.
''The only sentence I can pass by law is one of life imprisonment but
I shall recommend to the Home Secretary that you not be released from
prison for 20 years.''

A BLOOD test can identify people who are at genetic risk of developing
brittle-bone disease, doctors announced yesterday.
A team at St Thomas's hospital, London, used twins in their research
into osteoporosis, the bone-thinning disease which affects four million
women in the UK.
Bones become fragile and more easily fractured, leading to death in
some cases. Post-menopausal women are particularly vulnerable because of
the loss of the hormone oestrogen.
Dr Tim Spector, who led the research, has built his work on a previous
study in Australia of pre-menopausal women, which identified the gene
responsible for determining peak bone density.
Dr Spector's research has discovered this gene does have an effect on
bone density in later life and can be used as a test of whether a woman
will develop the disease.
The test follows two years of research using 95 identical and 87
non-identical post-menopausal twin pairs.
Dr Spector said: ''What this proves is that bone density is strongly
influenced by genetics.''

A SCOT who had a leg amputated after contracting a vascular disease
caused by smoking, is to raise a court action to sue the tobacco
companies he blames for his condition.
Mr Edward Havelin, 39, will lodge a six-figure claim for compensation
against tobacco companies Gallaghers and Imperial Tobacco at the Court
of Session in Edinburgh today.
Mr Havelin, of Blackwood Street, Anniesland, Glasgow, had to have his
right leg amputated after contracting Buergers disease -- a vascular
condition which is caused only by smoking.
A former labourer, who has been unemployed for several years because
of his illness, he argues that the tobacco companies knew when he
started smoking in 1970 that cigarettes could damage smokers' health,
yet did not start placing warnings on packets until the following year.
Mr Havelin's solicitor, Mr Cameron Fyfe, of Ross Harper and Murphy,
said yesterday: ''We believe we have a very strong case. Mr Havelin
tried on numerous occasions to give up smoking but the addictive power
of nicotine is so great that, despite the loss of a limb, he still
craves tobacco.''
Mr Fyfe added: ''This terrible condition has already cost Mr Havelin
his right leg and there is a real danger that, despite the fact that he
has dramatically cut down his smoking, he could lose other limbs.''
Mr Havelin, who is married with two children aged 18 and 14, said he
would not have started smoking if he had known at the time about the
addictive nature of cigarettes and their danger to health.
''I started smoking at 15 and, since my illness was diagnosed, I have
tried chewing gum, patches, and hypnotherapy to kick the habit. Despite
all that, I still smoke between five and 10 cigars a day.''
After contracting Buergers disease in 1986, Mr Havelin's mobility
gradually decreased and his right leg was amputated at Gartnavel
Hospital, Glasgow, in March last year. Doctors have told him that his
left leg might also have to be amputated because of the danger of the
disease spreading.
Mr Fyfe, who is also representing the widow of Mr Alfred McTear, the
smoker from Beith who launched a legal action against Imperial Tobacco
shortly before he died in March 1993, said Mr Havelin's case could be a
milestone in legal battles between smokers and companies.
His firm is handling a dozen other cases involving smokers attempting
to sue tobacco firms and he is awaiting the outcome of a submission for
legal aid on behalf of Mr Havelin. Both Mr Havelin and his wife Helen,
35, are on income support.
He said: ''I would hope the Legal Aid Board will see the obvious
merits in this case and approve Mr Havelin's application, as there is a
widely held suspicion that it is unwilling to fund cases of litigation
against tobacco giants because of the likely cost of these actions.
''The enormous power and wealth of multi-national tobacco companies
should not be a barrier to Scots receiving access to justice.''

UNION leaders warned yesterday that Glasgow could lose up to 750 civil
service jobs under a proposal to transfer a National Savings Bank
account to the Post Office.
The suggested move of the bank's Ordinary Account is one of a number
to be examined in a feasibility study ordered by Ministers at the
Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry.
Although management at the bank and Post Office Counters yesterday
insisted that no decisions had been taken, a transfer would appear
extremely beneficial to both public sector agencies.
It would rid the bank of an account which is very expensive to manage,
yet generates no income for the Treasury, and it would give the Post
Office an area of potential growth.
However, officials of the Civil and Public Services Association said
the proposal would threaten the future of 750 staff at the bank branch
in Cowglen, Glasgow, since the Post Office could switch its processing
role elsewhere.
Members yesterday agreed to mount a campaign of opposition, and voted
not to co-operate with the feasibility study. Branch secretary Danny
Williamson said: ''We will not give up our jobs without a fight.''
He claimed that even if the Glasgow staff retained responsibility for
processing transactions, the nature of repeated tendering for a contract
meant that the number of jobs, and conditions, would be eroded.
At present, about 16,000,000 people hold an ordinary account with the
bank, although only 4,500,000 are actively used.
Senior bank officials, who are under pressure from the Treasury to cut
running costs, have described the account as labour-intensive and ''very
expensive to operate''.
The annual cost of processing transactions is put at #60m --
approximately 30% of the bank's administration budget -- and, because it
is an instant-access account, its #1500m holding cannot be reinvested to
generate funding for the Treasury.
However, the Post Office, which already runs the counter service for
the account, is keen to use its new commercial freedom to market it
aggressively, even using it as a ''loss leader'' to bring in new
customers, who may then buy its other products.
In a circular to staff earlier this week, Mr Dan Monaghan, the bank's
controller in Glasgow, said that other options being looked at in the
feasibility study included the Post Office setting up a rival account.
The study is unlikely to be completed before the end of the year, and
a transfer of the account would require Commons legislation.
A bank spokesman said that although it was impossible to anticipate
the result of the study, it wished to keep the processing role at
Cowglen, where 2150 staff work.
* Two companies yesterday revealed plans which will lead to about 70
people in Scotland being made redundant. Hydro Electric is to cut 4O
jobs in the next month from its building, joinery, and allied trades
sections. A spokeswoman said the company had decided to use outside
contractors.
Meanwhile, pensions and insurance company Guardian Royal Exchange,
yesterday announced it was laying off 220 clerical staff and ending its
contracts with 250 self-employed sales consultants. Approximately 30
workers in Scotland are likely to be affected.

A ONE-TIME hero, recipient of a bravery award from the Queen, has been
jailed for two years for a knife attack.
Pipeworker John Gilroy, 50, dug his way out of a collapsed tunnel and
saved five of his colleagues in 1979. He was given the Queen's
Commendation for Brave Conduct.
In 1994, he attacked his ex-wife's new lover with a knife, cutting him
several times and scarring him for life.
Gilroy was convicted yesterday at Edinburgh Sheriff Court of
assaulting Mr James Taylor, 49, in the city's Balfour Street last July
30.
He had denied the charge, claiming he acted in self defence and that
it was Mr Taylor who produced the knife.
Mr Taylor suffered eight separate cuts to his face, chest, and arms,
some needing stitches.
Solicitor Ian Corbett said Gilroy was regarded as a diligent employee
by British Pipecoaters, where he had worked for eight years. He received
his bravery award in 1979 and had stayed out of trouble since 1988.
Jailing Gilroy, Sheriff John Horsburgh QC pointed out to him that he
had six previous convictions for assault.

THE Princess Royal yesterday called on the Scottish public to stop
closing their eyes to crime.
The days of expecting the police to fight crime on their own were
over, she told a Crime Concern Scotland conference in Edinburgh. And she
called for more people to confront criminals, instead of hiding from
what was happening in their neighbourhoods.
Princess Anne, president of Patrons of Crime Concern, said that the
public should work together with community and business groups to help
stamp out crime.
Experts believed there had to be three constant elements whenever a
crime was committed, she said, one of the most important being that
criminals knew they were unlikely to be stopped in their tracks by a
member of the public.
The princess said: ''People need more confidence to intervene when
they become aware of criminal activity in their area. I am not
suggesting we should become a nation of snoopers, but we have a
responsibility to take what steps we can to stop crime.''
The Scottish Police Ferderation last night greeted the princess's
views with caution. Mr Tom Rowatt, secretary of Strathclyde Police
Federation, said that he fully agreed with her beliefs that the public
should not ignore crimes, but was concerned about her use of the word
''intervention''.
He warned the public not to put themselves in any danger, and to leave
the catching of criminals firmly with the police.
The princess yesterday also voiced her fears that charities are losing
out to the National Lottery, when she visited one of her favourite
causes in Scotland, the Strathcarron Hospice, near Denny, Stirlingshire.
She questioned appeals director Mr Bob Blewitt, the man in charge of
raising the #1.3m needed each year to keep the hospice running.
After the royal visit, Mr Blewitt said: ''The princess showed a great
interest in how the lottery was affecting donations to national
charities.
''I said we had not been affected by the lottery as yet, but we were
very concerned about its effects on our donations in the future.''
* A barefoot man who rushed at the Prince of Wales in Brighton
yesterday was wrestled to the ground by police. He appeared to be trying
to give the royal visitor a leaflet on homeopathic medicine.
A man was being interviewed last night by police in connection with
the incident.

A BOYS' Brigade officer who held up a shop assistant at gunpoint was
yesterday ordered to do 150 hours of community service.
Paul Park, 19, was also told to pay #250 compensation to his victim,
Elizabeth Beattie, 56.
Park, of Middlefield Crescent, Aberdeen, had taken part in an early
morning armed raid on a newsagent in the city last November 18, getting
away with more than #3500.
Police caught him trying to hide on the roof of a derelict building
near the scene.
At the High Court in Edinburgh last month, Park admitted assault and
robbery at a branch of R S McColl at Bervie Brow, Altens, Aberdeen,
while acting with another person. Sentence had been deferred until
yesterday for reports.
He assaulted the shop assistant by presenting an air pistol at her,
demanding keys for a cupboard and safe, and robbing her of six cheques
and #3564 in cash during the masked raid.
The design of the air pistol, and the effect of the masks, made the
shop assistant think that her life would be in danger if she did not
comply with raiders' demands.
Lord Clyde told Park yesterday that he had committed a grave offence
which would normally be followed by a sentence of imprisonment or
detention.
The judge said: ''I remember asking why somebody of your background
and your abilities and character should act in this way.''
He added that there appeared to be no rational explanation as to why
Park had deliberately taken part in the robbery, which involved a degree
of planning.
''That conduct is quite inexcusable,'' said the judge, adding: ''This
case is in some ways exceptional. In other cases, without hesitation
there would be a significant custodial disposal imposed.''
Lord Clyde said he took into account that Park had co-operated with
the police and that all the money taken in the raid had been recovered.
He said that in the circumstances and given the favourable background
reports and testimonial letters from community leaders, he would impose
a sentence of community service.
The court was earlier provided with references for Park from his local
minister and an officer in the Boys' Brigade.
Mr Jack Davidson, defending, said Park, who had previously led a
blameless life, was highly regarded for his participation in the
community and the Boys' Brigade.
He added: ''It is considered that he has a useful future ahead of him,
despite this offence, both as a citizen and as potential senior officer
material in the Boys' Brigade.''
Park, a #130-a-week fish processor, was given one month to pay the
#250 compensation to the distressed victim of the robbery.

THE Assynt crofters have completed the first, and probably the last,
sale of an asset from their 21,000-acre estate with the sale of Torbreck
House and 40 acres of woodland to Implex Environmental Systems for
#91,000.
The crofters, who won international acclaim for their campaign to buy
North Lochinver Estate, are also involved with Implex and others in an
international consortium bidding for a #1m plus grant from Europe for a
project applying computer technology to environmental management.
In the summer of 1993, five months after taking control of the estate,
Assynt Crofters Trust announced it had negotiated a lease with Implex
for Torbreck House and its surrounding land, a small area not under
crofting tenure.
The Liverpool-based company was a pioneer in the development of
computer software for environmental monitoring and emergency response
systems and was measuring background radiation at 80 sites throughout
the UK.
Its two directors had been attracted to setting up in Assynt and were
finally won over by the Highland's advanced telecommunications system.
Mr Bill Ritchie, secretary of Assynt Crofters Trust, confirmed
Torbreck was being sold to Implex for #91,000, the crofters having
bought it for #90,000.
The firm currently employs one local person and the two directors. Mr
Ritchie, meanwhile, also confirmed that the trust and Implex were
involved in a consortium bidding for #1.3m (1.8m Ecus) of European grant
for a project employing telematics -- distance monitoring -- in pursuit
of sustainable natural resource management.
''It is very exciting. We are on the short leet under this EC
programme but we will not know whether we have been successful until the
end of June,'' Mr Ritchie said.
Others involved include forest managers in Valencia; a Spanish
software company, Software AG Espana. Additional expert input comes from
academic partners in Germany, the University of Karlsruhe, and the
Centrum voor Wiskunde en Information in Amsterdam, while the project
co-ordinator is from Edinburgh University.

A PASSENGER who disrupted a flight from New York to Glasgow was
yesterday jailed for three months.
Craig McKendrick, 32, of Townhead, Glasgow, a Foreign Legionnaire, had
to be restrained by British Airways personnel on May 3. His drunken
behaviour made passengers fear for their lives.
He was removed from his seat and shackled to a spare crew seat by
wrist and ankle straps and arrested on arrival at Glasgow.
When McKendrick appeared for sentence at Paisley Sheriff Court after
pleading guilty to breach of the peace, Sheriff Ronald Smith said he had
no alternative but to send him to prison.
He drank a half bottle of whisky and later placed his hand on a female
passenger's stomach. He also tried to kiss a stewardess, and shouted and
swore.
The captain ordered him to be forcibly restrained.
Fiscal David Green said: He was very drunk and had to be carried along
the aisle. He began shouting and swearing, to the alarm of passengers
and crew.''
Once restrained, five crew members had to look after him as he
continued to cause a disturbance. It was feared he might attempt to open
the emergency exit and put the aircraft in jeopardy.
Defence agent Charlie McCuskser said his client apologised
unreservedly for his conduct. He had consumed a considerable amount of
alcohol and had little recall of events.
McKendrick had been on leave in Connecticut and was returning to
Scotland to visit his mother.
McKendrick, he said, had served in traumatic situations in which most
people would not get involved.

EXCLUSIVE
A FRAUDSTER whose most recent deal was to front a #35m heritage
project was convicted yesterday in a case involving #1700.
Alex Lothian, 44, of Newgrange Park, Pittenweem, was ordered by
Sheriff Charles Smith at Cupar to do 250 hours of community service.
Afterwards, Lothian said he was a ''ruined man'' and he would never
work again.
He was originally indicted on two separate charges. The first alleged
attempted fraud of #280,000 and obtaining #15,000 in connection with the
failed Litetronics Lamps business in Anstruther during 1991 and 1992.
The second charge was of fraudulently obtaining #1716.02 from a
Stranraer deer farmer, Mr James Baxter.
His trial began on May 2 and was set to last at least three weeks.
However, three days into proceedings, after only two witnesses were
called, the fiscal, Mr Alan Kempton, offered an amendment to the
charges.
In return for dismissing the first charges, Lothian pled guilty to the
fraud against Mr Baxter and financial consultant Douglas McIntyre and
farming consultant Alastair Gray.
He admitted defrauding Mr Baxter of #1716.02 by pretending he was
acting on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry.
His QC, Mr Edward Targowski, yesterday pled for his client to be
spared a custodial sentence to allow him to care for his 82-year-old
invalid mother.
However, Sheriff Smith, noting that Lothian already had a criminal
record for fraud, said: ''It is obvious that you have returned to your
bad ways. Your offence was deliberate and involved stealing. You seem to
have ideas beyond your abilities and those who are unfortunate to become
involved in your projects become the victims.
''No doubt a custodial sentence is appropriate for you,'' he said,
adding that it was a ''narrow decision'' to impose 240 hours of
community service to indicate the gravity of the offence.
In the summer of 1992, Mr Baxter was struggling to maintain his deer
farm at Leswalt, near Stranraer, and decided to investigate plans to
diversify.
He was introduced to Lothian as a business consultant but Lothian
falsely claimed to be a licensed credit broker and DTI adviser.
Mr Baxter was soon convinced that the Fife consultant could help him.
Lothian increased his credibility when he introduced an innocent party,
Mr Alastair Gray, who he claimed was a deer farming expert.
On August 5, 1992, Mr Baxter received written proposals for his farm's
redevelopment and details of DTI assistance and Government loans.
The sting was attached to the end of the document: ''The charges for
consultancy services will be on the basis of #25 per hour exclusive of
VAT and do not include expenses for any travel, telephone, postage,
facsimile or typing charges which will be billed at cost.'' The first
#1000 had to be delivered upfront.
Mr Baxter was instructed to hand over a #500 deposit ''made payable to
Alex Lothian''.
More than a week later, Lothian presented his scheme to develop the
farm into a profitable deer park and visitor centre. The plans included
a tree-top walkway, an activity wood, restaurant, gift shop, and
exhibition area.
Two days after Mr Baxter paid his deposit and a further #500 ''to set
up the consultancy contract'', a bill for #504 arrived from Lothian for
the first 16 hours of Mr Gray's consultancy time.
Further bills, varying from #3.53 for a business lunch to #212 for
VAT, were soon dropping through the letter-box. HOwever, as a request
for a further #1000 of consultancy work arrived, Mr Douglas McIntyre of
St Monance -- who was innocently involved in the Frances mine project as
Lothian's financial adviser -- had been tipped off about Lothian's
activities and in turn warned Mr Baxter.
His warning came as Lothian -- now gaining new confidence -- uprated
his consultancy fees to #50 per hour.
''It was only a bit of nifty footwork in stopping cheques so quickly
that he only managed to get #1001 from me,'' observed Mr Baxter. ''I
saved #700 and could have lost a lot more.
''He was a cracking good con-man. All sort of suckers get taken in by
Alex Lothian. Thank God he has now got his come-uppance. It may stop him
repeating his routine again.''
Soon after defrauding Mr Baxter, Lothian became involved in the #35m
heritage project to restore the derelict house and grounds of
Barnbarroch, 20 miles away near Wigtown.
The brains behind the project -- Andrew McCulloch, 59, a solicitor and
property developer -- was jailed two months ago for defrauding the Royal
Bank of Scotland out of #300,000 in a gamble to keep other business
interests afloat.
Last October, Lothian was forced to resign as consultant to the
project, as he faced fraud charges involving his activities in Stranraer
and Anstruther..
In 1993, while attending a business course in Newton Stewart and with
the help of a public grant of #2400, McCulloch developed a scheme for a
cultural theme park similar to the Landmark Centre near Aviemore.
McCulloch was introduced to Lothian, who also saw the opportunity to
cash in on Scottish interest in its cultural history.
By October, Lothian had launched a #20m development plan for
Barnbarroch House and its 3500 acres.
He claimed the scheme would create more than 200 jobs and was
supported by a project consortium including merchant banks and
conglomorate companies. The funding and backers did not exist.
The project, he said, would include a nature reserve, historical and
cultural centre, theatre, museum, butterfly farm, forest walkway,
leisure centre, shops, restaurant, and 300 holiday chalets; and would
attract one million visitors a year to economically depressed
Wigtownshire.
Despite the hype, nothing happened for six months and the regional
council's planning department closed its file on the development.
In May 1994, Lothian admitted he and McCulloch had parted company.
Lothian told the press: ''Too late we discovered that Mr McCulloch did
not have his own funding to go ahead.''
He said a new scheme was under way involving a #23m trust status
development of Barnbarroch as a national museum and educational centre
with residential accommodation provided by 200 Norwegian chalets.
Another four months passed before a second relaunch of the Barnbarroch
scheme was undertaken with uprated costings of #35m.
Lothian claimed that more than 25,000 people had already joined the
trust, each subscribing #30 a year to the scheme and between #2m and #3m
had been raised. Investigations by The Herald discovered that no such
membership or level of investment existed.
Within a few days of the relaunch, Lothian appeared at Cupar Sheriff
Court on charges involving fraud.
Last night, Lothian told the Herald: ''I am happy to admit I have made
mistakes. But I am a ruined man because of this conviction, press
reports, and the way the police have warned people against me.
''One thing's for certain. I'll never work again.''

THE special Commons select committee set up to consider Lord Nolan's
anti-sleaze recommendations will be allowed to advise on how they can be
implemented, the Government conceded yesterday.
The decision resolves a seven-day dispute which left Labour
threatening to boycott the committee over suggestions that it would only
be allowed to discuss Lord Nolan's recommendations, rather than how to
implement them.
Leader of the House Tony Newton yesterday told MPs that the
committee's terms of reference would include ''to advise on how its
(Nolan's) recommendations relating to the House might be clarified and
implemented and to recommend specific resolutions for decision by the
House.''
It will have to submit an interim report by July 7, to allow MPs to
debate its findings. Its members are expected to be senior Privy
Councillor backbenchers from both sides of the House. The committee will
have 11 members, with a Government majority of one -- six Tory MPs, four
Labour and one Liberal Democrat.
Labour claimed the decision as a victory. A Labour source said the
Government had accepted the need for full implementation of the Nolan
recommendations, in particular that MPs disclose in detail all outside
earnings.
He claimed the Government was forced to concede in the light of poll
evidence, published in the Times yesterday, showing that Tory support
has suffered following publication of the Nolan report.
The poll put Labour on 58%, the Tories on 22% -- down 4% on last month
-- and the Liberal Democrats on 16%. A Labour source said: ''The
Conservative Party has just dropped 4% in the polls. Nolan was a key
issue in the fall in their support.''
The Government emphasised that the objective of the committee will be
to advise on how the Nolan report might be clarified, as well as
implemented.
A spokesman for Mr Newton's office said: ''The Opposition appears to
have agreed to the terms of reference for the committee which the
Government set out on Tuesday. They have accepted the remit we gave
them.''
Although Mr Major is understood to be ready to accept what Lord Nolan
has recommended, he faces stiff opposition from Tory back benchers who
see Nolan as an intrusion into their right to earn money from outside
consultancies.
The committee will examine a number of issues, including what kind of
outside work by MPs needs to be declared, the proposed MPs' code of
conduct, and the possibility of a ban on MPs with outside interests
sitting on standing commttees.

THE Nolan Committee might like to turn its attention to ''the
undisclosed financial interests of a number of journalists,'' suggested
Mr Andrew Rowe (Mid Kent -- Con.) with just, the Sketch thought, a hint
of viciousness.
Secure in its own lack of financial interests, it looked round the
Press Gallery to see if any other colleagues had whitened or reddened.
There were very few present to do either. I spotted one colleague whose
unwillingness to buy a drink has led to suspicions that he must by now
have financial interests, but generally the media looked commendably
composed -- one, perhaps, because he appeared to be asleep.
A cry of ''murderous scum'' may have wakened him, but the Sketch was
so startled it didn't notice. Obviously, if it had come from Mr Blair
directed at Mr Major or vice-versa you would have read about it on the
front page. It was, in fact, Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-West -- Lab.)
giving his opinion of those Faroese whalers who are still killing
whales.
Mr Banks, who has a savage side, being a Chelsea supporter, is
normally witty and amusing and adds something to the sum total of
happiness at Westminster. He is a great champion of whales, all the
worthier a campaign as whales can hardly show their appreciation.
Mr Tony Newton, the Commons Leader, took his outburst quietly. He had
probably been taken aback by the minor key of Mr Dennis Skinner's weekly
contribution to business questions.
Normally, Mr Skinner attacks horse, foot and guns, but yesterday he
simply mildly observed that as the business announced for the week after
the Whitsun break was hardly ''fizzing with ideas'' we might have a
debate on nurses' pay.
Admittedly, he added a jibe about Mr Major defending huge share
transfers to directors' wives while denying the nurses a just minimum
wage but, compared with vintage Skinner, this seemed almost pleasant.
The deputy Liberal Democrat leader, Alan Beith, neatly asked whether
if there was a debate on the notion of introducing a compulsory ID card,
which he deplored, there would be an opportunity for any of the members
of the Cabinet who agreed with him to speak in it.
This drew the suspicion of a grin from Mr Newton who, however, replied
that he could not imagine any of his colleagues speaking in quite the
same vein as Mr Beith, which either showed a lack of imagination or a,
perhaps pardonable, economy with the truth.
Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield -- Con.) called for an economic
debate so that Tory back benchers could suggest ideas to the Chancellor
which would enable the Conservative Party to win the next General
Election.
Any such ideas would undoubtedly come in extremely handy but Mr Newton
prevaricated, maybe thinking that such advice was best not proffered in
the presence of the enemy.
It is to be hoped, if the Tories are to make a good fight of it, that
they have some better, not to say, newer ideas than the one produced by
Sir Robert Dunn (Dartford -- Con.), who got up and reminded us of ''the
winter of discontent,'' even getting in the phrase about ''the dead
going unburied''.
This played extremely well for the Tories in 1979 and has been cranked
out with diminishing returns at each subsequent election.
As the present Leader of the Opposition was four years away from even
being an MP at the time, it is going to be rather hard to hang such a
mouldy albatross round his neck although as we recalled John Major --
who has presided over the introduction of 21 new taxes since the last
General Election, storming away at Labour as the party of high taxation
-- it did seem possible that the Tories at the next election might
emulate the Bourbons in forgetting nothing and learning nothing.

LLOYD'S of London's system of self-regulation is ''fundamentally and
irretrievably tarnished'' and must be replaced by an outside regulator,
a committee of MPs said yesterday.
The Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee warned that retaining
the present regulatory regime could prevent the recovery of the
300-year-old insurance market which has lost #8 billion since 1988.
The committee was also strongly critical of the Members' Agents who
are supposed to look after the interests of the the non-working Names or
investors.
It backs up some of the claims of the Names -- many of them facing
huge personal losses -- who believe they were the victims of negligence
and inadequate regulation.

BRITISH pressure on the IRA to decommission its weapons intensified
last night as the Government strongly defended Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew's decision to meet Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams in Washington.
It was made clear once again that decommissioning of terrorist arms
was the key to peace.
A furious row broke out at Westminster as Unionist politicians
condemned the Adams-Mayhew meeting as a political stunt and warned that
Sinn Fein still was linked to the murder gangs of the IRA.
Sir Patrick shook hands with Mr Adams at a behind-closed-doors meeting
in Washington, and the Minister said he had left Mr Adams ''in no doubt
about the importance the Government attached to substantial progress
being made by the Provisional IRA in the decommissioning of arms.''
The point was reinforced in the Commons both by the Prime Minister and
by the Minister with the main responsibility for direct negotiations
with the IRA, Mr Michael Ancram.
Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley told the Prime Minister that
total decommissioning of arms would mean the security forces and the
police giving up their weapons.
He said: ''I am sure you have noted that the leader of the IRA-Sinn
Fein has said that there cannot be any progress towards decommissioning
until there is complete decommissioning of everyone.
''That is the surrender of arms by Army and by police and by those who
have guns to protect themselves. Is the Government prepared to negotiate
with the leader of Sinn Fein on those terms?''
Mr Major replied: ''The best contribution Sinn Fein can make to the
conference and to Northern Ireland's prospects would be to promote peace
and therefore to secure the decommissioning of the IRA's arms and
explosives. ''Until in these exploratory talks there have been practical
movements forward in the decommissioning of arms, it will not be
possible for Sinn Fein to move forward to full-scale political talks,
either with the Government or, I suspect, with your party or with any
other political party in Northern Ireland.''

THE Cabinet decided yesterday on next year's legislation, including
key Bills on housing and armed forces' active reserves, and a worthy
Scottish education Bill. However, the key legislation will be in the
Chancellor's Budget in November.
This will decide tax cuts and whether or not the Major Government
reverses its present policy to encourage property- owning and investment
in home-owners.
The Cabinet also endorsed, in a further 90-minute session,
preparations for next year's negotiations on the future of Europe.
Cabinet Euro-sceptics agreed that the Prime Minister should go to his
meeting with Germany's Chancellor Kohl today in Bonn arguing for
deregulation and anti-federalist measures.
The Euro-sceptics, Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley, were
allowed a full say in deciding the game-plan for these crucial
negotiations. The Prime Minister was able to carry forward a united
Cabinet stance at this stage.
The Cabinet also agreed to pursue the liberalisation of media
cross-ownership, with a halfway stage Bill next year as a forerunner to
serious changes in ownership rights of newspaper and broadcasting
proprietors that might come later.
A new Scottish policy on education is promised but the details are
still to be worked out, and there will be an Armed Forces Bill to retain
''reserved forces'' available for deployment in Nato and other roles up
to the year 2000.
The legislation programme for next year is designed to be low-key and
likely to win back for the Government a voter-friendly relationship. The
number of Bills is expected to be reduced, but the crucial legislation
changes will come in the Budget statement.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is resisting pressure from the Tory right
for deep cuts in public spending to fund tax reductions.
He insisted his long-term economic policy would not be ''blown off
course'' by political pressures, in an interview in today's Financial
Times.
Mr Clarke said: ''You have got to be sure that what the state provides
is provided efficiently and is of high quality.''
Rejecting deep spending cuts, he said: ''I don't see myself committed
on any course of that kind. I am not one of those people who wishes to
totally redesign the welfare state.''

TOMORROW'S World presenter Carol Vorderman has been sacked by the BBC
after appearing in a washing powder commercial.
Her contract with the science show was terminated after she took part
in an advertisement for Ariel detergent, said a BBC spokeswoman.
Cambridge graduate Ms Vorderman is also known for her mathematical
wizardry on the Channel 4 quiz show Countdown.
The 34-year-old presenter, who joined Tomorrow's World last year, was
said to be ''very angry'' at the decision.
The BBC said: ''There were concerns about her first advert but we
accepted it. We were not prepared to allow more adverts to appear.
''The soap powder company screened a second commercial this week
featuring Ms Vorderman in a scientific context. Her contract was
terminated on Tuesday.
''It is deeply regrettable as Carol has made a valuable contribution
to the programme.
''Tomorrow's World's reputation for impartial scientific journalism
must not be open to question,'' added the spokeswoman.
The current series of Tomorrow's World ends in July, BBC chiefs will
decide on a replacement before the new series begins in the autumn.
The show was overhauled last year to give science a higher profile in
BBC schedules.
The BBC said: ''We accepted it at the time because she came to us with
certain commercial commitments already in place.''

COUNCILLORS have blocked a #40m housing development in Lanarkshire
after being advised that its shared access with an enterprise zone could
stop firms and jobs coming to the area.
The jobs-versus-houses dilemma has created tensions within Hamilton
District Council whose planning department has for many months been
helping a major developer work up plans for 1000 houses on a 60-hectare
site on the western edge of the burgh.
It is estimated that the housing development at Newhousemill
Road/Townhill Road, phased over five to seven years, would create 800
jobs a year.
Unfortunately, the development would have to share an access road with
an adjacent enterprise zone to which Lanarkshire Development Agency is
determined to attract hi-tech industries, providing around 2000 jobs.
Members of the council's development advice committee had to wrestle
with advice from the LDA and other agencies that a shared access with a
residential development would deter companies from building factories in
the enterprise zone.
Indeed, Lanarkshire Development Agency, as landowners of the
enterprise zone, has declined to make any access arrangements with the
housing developers, Comstock Holdings.
Mr Neil McGill, an LDA director, said three years would be required to
get the Hamilton International Technology Park up and running before his
agency could consider the possibility of sharing access with a
residential development.
The LDA had already spent #10.3m on the site and would spend another
#3m to #4m in the next few years. In his view, the agency and its
partners, Scottish Enterprise, Locate in Scotland, and Akeler
Developments, needed ''a good shot'' at marketing the site without
interference from a residential development.
This view was shared by Mr John Rintoul, representing Locate in
Scotland. He told councillors: ''In 14 years of operations, we have
learned that companies are not attracted to locations where access is
shared with residential use. Shared access would reduce the
marketability of the site.''
Hamilton's Labour leader, Councillor Tom McCabe, pointed out that
economic prospects for the Hamilton area were heavily dependent on the
success of Enterprise Zone.
He said: ''While we're involved in a serious effort to bring
employment to this area . . . it would be wrong of us to ignore the
advice coming from the professionals involved in economic development.''
Moving that the housing application be refused, he added that there
was no suggestion that what had become known as the Western extension
site would be unavailable for housing ''for all time''.
However, a spokesman for Comstock, Mr Gordon Adams, said he and his
colleagues had been surprised that the application had been taken to
committee before the company had been given adequate time to reach an
access agreement with the LDA.
He explained: ''We think it was inappropriate and premature for the
application to go before that meeting. There was only one decision the
planning officer could recommend and that was refusal, because there was
no access to the site.''
He continued: ''We understand quite clearly that the LDA has a
material problem and we'll work round that.
''It is not a problem that can't be worked out. They're spending a lot
of money.
''Hamilton needs an enterprise zone. It needs those factories and it
needs those jobs. But the people who are going to take those factories
and fill those jobs have got to have somewhere to live. One goes with
the other.''

EMBARRASSED Army personnel have had to beat a retreat after a public
relations exercise backfired.
The 58-strong team of Royal Engineers went to the island of Mull to
build a road for the residents but ended up wrecking one instead.
The squad from the Maidstone-based 61st Squadron went to build an
access road to a nineteenth-century crofting township being
reconstructed close to Iona.
But after completing a third of the work they had to pull out as their
large tipper lorries were destroying the public road from the ferry
village of Fionnphort.
The red-faced Royal Engineers were given material by the council to
repair the damage before quitting the island.
In charge was Lieutenant Rachel Semple, who said: ''At least we
managed to build a car park for a village hall.''

THE Queen has told an animal-loving housewife that she can't help two
families of starving swans in Oban harbour.
However, she did say, in a letter to Mrs Christine Black, that she was
looking forward to an official visit to Oban in August, when she will
open officially a new hospital.
Mrs Black wrote to the Queen about the swans, which are fighting for
survival because their natural food sources are virtually non-existent.
Bread left out by locals is snapped up by quicker and bolder seagulls.
Mrs Black wrote: ''Can you give me any advice on whether the swans
would be liable for help from any association etc? . . . I feel sure you
will be able to help, as you own these beautiful birds.''
A reply from a royal aide to Mrs Black's letter said: ''Her Majesty
much appreciated you taking the time to write but I am afraid that the
Queen is unable to offer any direct assistance.
''Nevertheless, your letter offers some positive suggestions about how
food might be provided regularly . . . and I would not wish to
discourage you at all from further advancing these proposals.''

LIBERAL Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown is expected to announce today
that the party would not keep the Conservatives in office in the event
of a hung Parliament after the next General Election.
In an article in the forthcoming issue of Liberal News, he tells party
workers: ''We will not allow them to get in by the back door.''
However, in other respects, he is likely at a news conference to
backtrack on the tilt towards Labour he signalled last month which would
have ended the Liberal Democrat strategy of not favouring either of the
two bigger parties, known as equidistance.
The support that Mr Ashdown seemed to favour with Labour annoyed some
of his MPs who believe it would be damaging to them to be identified as
virtually identical with Labour -- even although the parties do share
similar views on a range of policies.
The article will promise that there will be ''no let-up on Labour'' in
the period before the next election.
Mr Ashdown will rule out a Lib-Lab electoral pact which leaders of
both parties agree would be unworkable.
The last time a defeated Conservative Prime Minister sought Liberal
support was in February 1974, when Edward Heath offered the Liberal
leader, Jeremy Thorpe, a seat in the Cabinet.
However, the Liberal leadership took the view that Heath, who had a
Commons majority of more than 40 when he went to the country and lost
it, had been rejected by the voters and should not be kept in office.
Also, even in coalition with the Liberals, Heath would not have
commanded a Commons majority. Labour formed a minority Government under
the late Harold Wilson.
In a similar situation, the Liberal Democrat leaders could be expected
to take the same view.

AN appeal against the result of former Sunday Mail deputy editor Ken
Laird's unfair dismissal tribunal has been turned down.
A Glasgow tribunal ruled last year that Mr Laird, 44, had been
unfairly dismissed by the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail (1986)
Ltd.
However, the newspaper company appealed against the decision.
Following a hearing in Edinburgh last month an Employment Appeal
Tribunal issued a written judgment upholding the original decision and
dismissing the appeal.
The tribunal had heard that Mr Laird was sacked by Sunday Mail editor
Jim Cassidy after it became known that Mr Laird's company, Lang Syne
Publishers Ltd, was then behind two Glasgow monthly freesheets.
The tribunal compared the two freesheets, the Daily Record and Sunday
Mail, and the Glaswegian, a weekly freesheet associated with the other
papers, and found there was no significant competition either in
advertising or in editorial terms.
The tribunal concluded the nature of his alleged misconduct was minor,
any harm was minimal and both the dismissal procedure and appeal had not
been satisfactory.
The EAT concluded that the tribunal was entitled to hold there had
been insufficient inquiry before dismissal.
The tribunal said it was clear Mr Cassidy was not best suited to judge
disciplinary matters as feeling between himself and Mr Laird had become
tainted after a previous row.
The tribunal took the view that a reasonable employer would have dealt
with the case by a final written warning.
However, the EAT said the tribunal came ''dangerously close'' to
substituting its view for that of a reasonable employer.
''We have come to the view that the Industrial Tribunal decision must
stand because, despite our reservations about parts of their reasoning,
we consider that they were entitled to hold that no reasonable employer
would have dismissed the respondent (Mr Laird) without making some
further enquiry into the extent and circumstances of his involvement in
the two free newspapers. The appeal must, therefore be dismissed,'' the
EAT concluded.
Mr Laird said yesterday: ''For legal reasons I regret I cannot make
any comment at this stage.''

THE main course on the lunch menu yesterday at the Palace of Holyrood
House was ''Lamb Reform'' as his eminence Cardinal Thomas Winning tucked
in with relish, he could be forgiven a broad grin.
He had just been the main item on the menu of the General Assembly of
the Reformed Kirk. Far from being the sacrificial lamb, he had upstaged
the other performers brilliantly with his proposal for a Christian
assembly for Scotland by the year 2000, thus reforming the followers of
the Reformers.
The plans which had looked set to grab attention yesterday at the
Assembly were eclipsed by Cardinal Winning with his master stroke.
He recalled his previous address to the Kirk in 1975 as one of the
highlights of his ministry and privately he confessed he had resolved to
come back to the Mound with more than pious platitudes to offer.
The result was an extraordinary day which did not end with the
tumultuous ovation he received. Within two hours he had become the first
Roman prelate to set foot in the Free Kirk Assembly.
By a stroke of coincidence, he had been a guest of the Queen's High
Commissioner at Holyrood on the eve of his scheduled address and had
been asked then by the Purse Bearer if he wished to accompany Lady
Fraser's party for the annual brief courtesy call to the Free Kirk
Assembly across the road.
''Felix Culpa,'' he called it, Latin for a lucky shot. ''That sounds
like the name of some moderator,'' he quipped. Many will credit
yesterday's work to the Holy Spirit.
Tom Winning is not known for playing ecumenical roulette. This was a
calculated throw, not a shot in the dark. It already has four things
going for it, as the cardinal himself pointed out. ''Goodwill -- we
already have shown that to each other. A structure -- that's not a
problem. Themes -- there are plenty of these. All we need now is a place
to hold it.''
I suspect that the Kirk's assembly hall -- tailor-made as it is for
such an event -- will not be the location. ''You play cup finals on
neutral grounds,'' joked the cardinal. Frankly, it does not matter where
it happens. The fact is that it now will happen. The Kirk can hardly say
no, and ACTS, the ecumenical body, (Action of Churches Together in
Scotland) has been looking for a significant project to get its teeth
into since its inception. This surely is it.
As if all this was not enough, the cardinal went even further in his
speculative talk to journalists after lunch. Church unity was first
priority for the Pope, he declared, and even gave the impression that
intercommunion may be possible within five years.
''We will have diversity, not uniformity. That will come in God's own
time. I wouldn't like to say when intercommunion will come but it is one
topic under constant review and already there is scope for it at
marriages. It's a complex question,'' the cardinal admitted.
''There are our own people who are not able to receive as well but
dialogue on this and other things is important in the Church.''
There is no doubt that the cardinal yesterday made the most
significant ecumenical advance in Scotland since the Roman Catholic
Church agreed to come into ACTS.
Seasoned observers who know his penchant for unilateral action will
want to see how flexible Cardinal Winning will be about the agenda and
in the way respresentation to the proposed assembly is decided. However
as he said yesterday: ''The main issue is to get together.''
Nobody who cares about spiritual issues would doubt his sincerity or
that his initiative represents a giant leap forward in Scottish church
affairs. The cardinal, in his address to the Assembly, said he preferred
visions to dreams.
Yesterday he gave Scotland a vision. Across the road in the darkness
of the Free Kirk we saw the nightmares of the past.

ROMAN Catholic Cardinal Thomas Winning yesterday made history by
visiting the Free Church of Scotland's General Assembly.
His entry into the gathering of fundamentalist presbyterians in
Edinburgh happened by accident as he was a guest of Lady Fraser, Her
Majesty's High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland, who yesterday made her traditional visit to the Free Kirk
Assembly.
The cardinal was in her party who crossed the road from the Assembly
Hall to the Free Kirk Assembly in St Columba's Church.
His visit is believed to be the first known visit by a Roman Catholic
to the Free Kirk Assembly, although a Catholic spokesman suggested
later: ''Some might have gone there in disguise.''
Cardinal Winning had earlier addressed the General Assembly and called
for Scottish Christians to come together in one gathering to proclaim
the gospel.
Cardinal Winning sat in the Free Kirk Assembly while the Moderator,
the Rev Munro Alex Macleod, welcomed Lady Fraser and her party and she
replied.
No objection to Cardinal Winning's presence was made in the hall, but
the Moderator said later it was ''appalling and shocking'' that a Roman
Catholic cardinal had been invited to address the other General
Assembly.
''The national church of Scotland is a Protestant church protesting
against all that Cardinal Winning stands for theologically.''
''I don't object to him coming to the Free Church Assembly as a guest
of the High Commissioner but I would never foresee the time when a Roman
Catholic Cardinal would address the Free Church Assembly,'' he said.
Cardinal Winning's Free Church visit infuriated Pastor Jack Glass,
leader of the Zion Baptist Church in Glasgow and the 20th century
Reformation Movement.
Pastor Glass and about 40 supporters were demonstrating at the front
of the Assembly Hall against Cardinal Winning's address when they heard
he was at the Free Church.
Pastor Glass and a few others raced to St Columba's and stood outside
with placards saying ''Winning is a RC idolator'' and ''Knox hated RC
idolatory''.
Mr Glass said: ''This is a shameful day for the Free Church when they
have allowed into their assembly a Cardinal from a Church that calls the
work of John Knox a sin.''
Pastor Glass had earlier shouted at Cardinal Winning as he walked in
the quadrangle of the Assembly Hall.
Cardinal Winning said later he had been asked on Wednesday night by
the Purse Bearer, Mr Robin Blair, if he wanted to accompany the High
Commissioner to the Free Church.
''I said I would love to go because I have nothing against the people
in the other assembly, far from it. I would welcome meeting them and
getting to know them better.''
Asked about the Free Church Moderator's criticism, he said he was not
surprised. It took time for people to come to terms with the present-day
situation.
Cardinal Winning, asked to comment on the suggestion that he would not
be asked to addresss the Free Kirk, said: ''I think there are some areas
going to be difficult. One would not compare the Church of Scotland with
the Free Church. Miracles take a little longer.''
Asked if he had felt any discomfort in St Columba's, he said: ''They
have padded seats, and I enjoyed what the High Commissioner said. At
least they didn't slam the door on me.''
On the accidental means of his historic visit, he said: ''It was a
happy fault.''

THE future of controversial Free Church of Scotland theologian the
Reverend Professor Donald Macleod remains in the balance.
Colleagues at the church's General Assembly, after four hours of
debate behind closed doors in Edinburgh yesterday, failed to reach any
decision over unspecified allegations against the minister.
Around 6pm Kirk Moderator, the Rev Murdo Alex Macleod emerged from the
assembly building close to the Royal Mile where a report from its
training for ministry committee had been discussed and announced the
matter had been adjourned until today.
Mr Macleod said: ''There is no statement to be made until the business
is completed.'' He said he would not be commenting further.
Professor Macleod, who has held the chair of systematic theology at
the Free Church College in Edinburgh since 1978, did not attend the
debate although his supporters asked him to do so.
On Wednesday, the professor, who claims he is the victim of a smear
campaign, told The Herald he would leave the matter in the hands of the
''brethren'', saying he had nothing to defend himself against.
He said that if the General Assembly failed to lay to rest the
allegations against him he and others would have to think very carefully
about their futures with the Church.
Last October the committee dismissed allegations against the
professor. Committee members have cleared him three times in nine years
and his supporters claim the revival of allegations is due to a body of
church members opposed to his more liberal views.
Earlier this week Lothian and Borders police confirmed it was
investigating a complaint against him and that a report would be
submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
A few weeks ago Professor Macleod was a guest preacher at a Church of
Scotland service in the Western Isles.
The service took place in Stornoway High which has been vacant for
several months after its minister, the Rev Roderick Morrison, moved to a
Glasgow parish.
The invitation to Professor Macleod was issued by the interim
moderator, the Rev Ivor MacDonald of Barvas, who said he could not
comment on the proceedings of the vacancy committee which were a private
matter.
He said however there was ''nothing in the offing at the moment''.

Washington
PRESIDENT Clinton was given a standing ovation yesterday as he bluntly
told Northern Ireland's paramilitary groups on all sides to ''get rid of
their bombs and guns for good'' and demanded that beatings and
intimidation should stop.
His message was immediately welcomed by Britain, and Northern Ireland
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said he believed the call would be heeded.
Mr Clinton was giving the presidential address at a major Washington
conference on investment in Northern Ireland and the border counties.
In a sombre speech, he never mentioned Sinn Fein by name, but praised
the ''leadership and courage'' of John Major, and the two Irish Prime
Ministers who have presided over the peace process, as well as SDLP MP
John Hume.
He told more than 1000 delegates he was ''renewing a pledge to do
everything in my power'' for peace.
At the meeting were Sir Patrick, deputy Irish Premier Dick Spring, US
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and US Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown.
Mr Clinton's address -- and the platform presence of the three leading
US administration figures -- was claimed by Mr Spring to have marked
''the most significant event in Irish-American relations for many
years''.
He added: ''I have great hopes that this unprecedented initiative will
bear a rich harvest. Thanks to the efforts of many courageous people,
not least in America, we believe we will have peace in Ireland at
last.''
British and Irish Government officials remained confident, as the
major section of the conference agenda neared its end, that its aim of
attracting a huge investment injection for Northern Ireland would
succeed.
Last night, the President and senior members of his administration
were holding new talks with British and Irish Cabinet Ministers.
In his address, Mr Clinton said: ''To all who are observing the
ceasefire, I appeal to you to take the next step and begin to discuss
the serious decommissioning of weapons.
''Paramilitaries on both sides must get rid of their bombs and bullets
for good.
''The spectre of violence that has haunted Ireland must be banished
once and for all.''
He said there had to be progress outside the conference rooms.
''Violence has diminished but it has not disappeared.
''I call on all those who continue to employ violence to end the
punishment beatings and the intimidation.''
Urging American businessmen to invest in Northern Ireland, the
President said that helping to create jobs would loosen the hold of
despair.
Sir Patrick Mayhew said the speech would be seen as fine by any
standards.
He said of immediate importance to the Government was the demand that
violence had got to come to an end totally.
The President had ''struck the right note''. The theme of the speech
had been ''Let us turn the key upon history and go forward into new
uplands free from the burdens of the history of the past''.
* President Clinton is considering visiting Ireland and the UK later
this year, White House press secretary Mike McCurry said last night.
However, he declined to say whether the visit, likely to take place in
the autumn or early winter, would include Northern Ireland.

CARDINAL Thomas Winning, of the Roman Catholic Church, yesterday set
Scottish Christians the target of gathering together in five years time
to celebrate the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
His challenging vision was presented in a historic address to the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and was welcomed by Kirk
spokesmen.
Cardinal Winning said later he was thinking of a gathering of not more
than a day or two.
''I have already offered this vision of a kind of national meeting of
our own Church. I don't see any insurmountable difficulties in having an
assembly of a day or two. It has got to happen and we have five years to
accomplish it.''
Cardinal Winning asked: ''What do we need?'' He went on: ''We need
goodwill. We need structures -- they are practically in place. We need
themes. All we need is a place.''
The cardinal suggested also if there was a church and nation committee
based on all the Christian traditions in Scotland, it would be even more
formidable than the Kirk's committee of that name.
On the question of intercommunion, he said this was under constant
review by Rome.
The Very Rev. Dr James Weatherhead, Principal Clerk to the General
Assembly, said later the Church of Scotland was committed to the
ecumenical movement in Scotland.
Dr Weatherhead, speaking personally, said he shared the vision himself
and hoped it was widely shared in the Church of Scotland.
The Rev. Duncan McClements, convener of the Kirk's ecumenical affairs
committee, said: ''His emphasis on mission and evangelism was good and
his concern for the spiritual dimension in common life is one I would
share.''
The address was welcomed also by the Rev. Maxwell Craig, general
secretary of Action of Churches Together in Scotland (known as Acts).
Addressing the General Assembly, Cardinal Winning said the celebration
of the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus would be an opportunity
for Christians to ''proclaim the year of the Lord's favour'' in word and
action.
''I hope and pray, with every fibre of my being, that, beginning
today, these next five years will be a period of intense ecumenical
activity in preparation for that anniversary.
''And I hope that our ever deepening fellowship will bring, with the
dawn of a new millennium -- an assembly of all Scottish Christians -- a
new beginning for a shared proclamation of the gospel of lifeCardinal
Winning said his vision looked to the day when the entire Christian
family in Scotland would gather together ''in an assembly such as this''
to witness to and unleash the vitality and life-giving power of the
spirit of God and to commit themselves, without reservation, to a new
evangelisation, together.
He added:''Humanly speaking, the challenges are daunting, but when
were they otherwise?
''Just as we have seen the emergence of entire communities blighted by
a generational material poverty through unemployment, we are also having
to contend with the phenomenon of whole communities experiencing
spiritual poverty, amounting to a rejection of God
Cardinal Winning said that the vision of a transformed world brought
about by the ministry of a transformed Church would forever remain a
delusion ''unless we thirst for reconciliation and are motivated in our
relationships with each other by an eagerness to be reconciled''.
Cardinal Winning's 10-minute address, spoken quietly, was greeted by
sustained applause.

<TEXT>
THE Church of Scotland yesterday voted to sell its conference centre
at Carberry Tower near Musselburgh.
After an hour-long debate at the General Assembly churchmen agreed to
the sale for #250,000.
The new owners will either be the Friends of Carberry Tower or a new
trust to be jointly set up between the Friends and the Kirk, ensuring a
continued Church of Scotland presence at the site.
The balance of the #300,000 price tag on the centre will be given as a
loan to the new owners in return for a standard security enabling the
Church to repossess should the owners go bankrupt.
Talks over the future of the tower were concluded only minutes before
the matter was brought before the assembly for a final decision.
Mr Iain McCarter, an elder of Dalkeith, Midlothian, commended the
proposal which he said ensured Carberry was not lost to the church.
Carberry Tower, which dates back to 1480, is situated in 30 acres of
parkland and was gifted to the Church of Scotland in 1961 by the
Elphinstone family. It lies within sight of Carberry Hill where Mary
Queen of Scots surrended in 1567.
* THE Church of Scotland is viewed by young people as ''irrelevant,
boring and unwelcoming'', the General Assembly heard yesterday.
The Rev Iain Scott, convener of the board of parish education, said a
study showed youngsters considered the church to be ''distant,
mysterious and unwelcoming''. But Mr Scott said this view could be
changed if the Kirk took bold action in the search for more effective
ways of working with young people.

FIVE Scots were among the victims of the air crash near Bradford, it
was confirmed yesterday. All nine passengers and three crew died when
the commuter plane en route to Aberdeen from Leeds-Bradford Airport
crashed beside the A61 at Dukeswick, West Yorkshire. The victims came
from all walks of life.
Mr Bill Ingram, 62, had been returning from Leeds where he had been
looking at student accommodation one of the Morrison Group companies was
building when the tragedy occurred.
Although he had been with the company for only a year he was extremely
well-known in the building trade. He joined Morrison Civil Engineering
after his former employers went into receivership.
He was married with three sons. Yesterday, one of the sons flew back
from the Middle East, where he had been working. He joined his brothers
and his mother, Moira, in the family home at Bain Crescent, Mintlaw,
where they have lived for 20 years.
''We are totally devastated,'' a neighbour said. ''They keep
themselves to themselves but they are a lovely family. It is a terrible
tragedy.''
Mr Ian Smith, Morrison's regional director, said everyone at the
company was deeply upset by the tragedy. ''Bill Ingram joined Morrisons
a year ago as a contracts manager and was based at our office in Dyce.
''I cannot speak too highly of Bill, who was a household name in the
building industry in the North-east.'' He added: ''Everyone here is
shocked and stunned at the loss of a loyal colleague and valued
friend.''
Tributes were also paid to Mr Philip Race, 46, the director of human
resources for Aberdeen Royal Hospitals, who had been on his way home
after attending a meeting in Leeds of senior personnel within the
National Health Service. He joined Aberdeen Royal Hospitals in December
1992 from the Rank Organisation in London.
Mr Race lived at Lethenty House, near Inverurie, having previously
stayed in Pitcaple. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth and their three
children Alex, 18, Ben 16, Catherine, 10. ''You could not meet a nicer
guy,'' a family friend said.
During his time with Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust he was involved in
many working groups including the Scottish Health Services Personnel
Directors' Group.
''The sudden and tragic death of Philip Race has shocked all members
of staff and friends,'' said Mr Alex Cumming, chief executive of
Aberdeen Royal Hospitals.
''He will be remembered by the enthusiasm and professionalism he
brought to his position and it was notable how quickly he adapted to
working within the NHS coming from a significantly different background
in the commercial sector.
Mr Paul Denton, the co-pilot was in his late twenties. He had recently
married and set up home in Highburton, near Huddersfield, just 100 yards
from his father's house. Yesterday, his father, Tony, and his
stepmother, Charlotte, were being comforted by relatives. His uncle, Mr
Stewart Denton, said: ''We are all very upset and cannot express our
thoughts at this moment. Tony and Charlotte are devastated and just need
to be alone.''
A police guard stood outside the moortop home of the pilot, Mr John
Casson, 49. He lived with his wife in a converted barn overlooking
Sowerby Bridge. Mrs Casson was too upset to talk about the tragedy but a
neighbour said: ''John and Pam were a very decent couple. It's tragic
and a great shock.''
The youngest victim of the tragedy, was 22-year-old air stewardess
Helen Leadbetter, who had started work only a few weeks ago. Neighbours
said yesterday that, until recently, she had spent more than three years
working in a dental surgery near her home in Westcroft Avenue, Shelf,
near Bradford.
She had been a dental nurse since leaving school at the age of 18 and
had lived in the road all her life with mother Jackie, father David, and
elder brother Harvey, 24.
Mrs Mary Thompson, 68, who has known the family for more than 20
years, said: ''It's just knocked me for six. It's absolutely
devastating. Helen was such a lovely lass. She was quietish but very
pleasant. She would never pass you in the street without acknowledging
you.''
Miss Katherine Duguid, who was in her 30s, had worked for Nowsco (UK)
Ltd, a leading oil service company, for the past five years and was on a
business trip when the tragedy happened.
Mr Rick Needoba, the firm's general manager, said: ''It is a very sad
day here. A lot of people are in shock. Katherine had worked for us for
five years as an accountant and was doing an excellent job. She worked
hard and was highly committed.
''She had been at our office in Leeds for a few days doing some
training for us and was on her way back to Aberdeen.''
He said that Miss Duguid grew up in Glasgow and it is thought her
parents still live in the Central belt. Mr Needoba said that Miss
Duguid, who was single and lived alone, had recently moved house within
Cove.
''She was quiet, dedicated, and a nice person who was very well liked.
Miss Duguid's death is the second tragedy to hit Nowsco (UK) Ltd in the
past 16 months. Oil worker Andrew De Vries, 29, who was also employed by
the company in Aberdeen, was shot dead in Houston, Texas, on January 7
last year. He was in the city on business and was shot when a homeowner
mistook him for a burglar as he was knocking on his door.
Mr Philip Hutchinson, 34, a computer expert who worked for Escom,
lived in the scattered rural community of Esslemont, near Ellon,
Aberdeenshire, with his wife Debbie and two children aged eight and 10.
Mrs Hutchinson's sister travelled from Hull yesterday for an emotional
reunion with Debbie and the children. She said: ''We are absolutely
devastated about this. Phil did not leave anything and we have a lot to
sort out. I would be grateful to be left to do that with my sister.''
The fifth Scottish victim was named as Mr Carl McGrath, 27, from
Glasgow.
Grandmother Mrs Ivy Wolsey had been flying from her home in Bradford
to Aberdeen to see her three grandchildren.
Her son, Pete, a freelance television cameraman, was waiting at
Aberdeen airport to greet her. The news was broken to him by airport
staff and his wife, Terri, drove from the family home to comfort him.
The couple were yesterday heading for Bradford to identify Mrs Wolsey's
remains.
A friend of the family said yesterday: ''Mrs Wolsey was a lovely old
lady. She adored her grandchildren. It is very difficult to take in what
has happened. Pete and Terri must be devastated,'' he added.
Mrs Wolsey, who was in her 70s, was on her way to pay a visit to her
three grandchildren, Dominic, six, Caitlin, three, and their
one-year-old sister Robyn. The family live in the Kincardineshire
village of St Cyrus. No-one was at the family home, Laroch Lodge,
yesterday.
Mr Dennis Davies, from Pontefract, was a 46-year-old contracts manager
with Nestle on his way to a meeting in Peterhead. He leaves a wife and
two sons, and was described by a close colleague as ''a good man, quiet
and conscientious, well respected and popular with everyone who knew
him''.
Police in Yorkshire said the names had been taken from the flight
list.

INVESTIGATORS probing the Yorkshire air crash were yesterday able to
listen to the pilot's last desperate request to return to Leeds-Bradford
airport before his plane smashed into the ground minutes after taking
off for Aberdeen.
Although the investigators will not have the benefit of information
from a ''black box'' flight data recorder, they were also given a
possible clue as to the cause of the accident -- which killed all 12
people on board, including five Scots -- by an 11-year-old radio ham who
claimed he heard the pilot's final words.
Steven Saunders, of Kendal, Cumbria, said: ''The pilot said the engine
had been hit by a lightning bolt.''
He added: ''The air traffic control centre came in and said something
but I couldn't make out what they said. Then it went all fuzzy.''
The tape recording of a conversation between air traffic controllers
and the pilot of the twin-engined Knight Air 21-seat commuter plane was
being studied yesterday.
The Embraer Bandeirante came down in a cornfield four minutes after
leaving the airport and disintegrated as it crashed into the ground.
Airport manager Bill Savage said the pilot had made a request to
return to the airport shortly after take-off and ''was attempting to do
so'' when the accident happened.
Mr Savage said: ''Tapes of the radio conversation between the air
traffic control tower and the aircraft are now in the possession of the
Air Accident Investigation Branch.''
The area around the crash site remained sealed yesterday.
Knight Air's commercial director Tim Russell said there was ''no
reason whatsoever'' why the Bandeirante aircraft should not have been
flying in the ''variable'' weather conditions on Wednesday night.
Witnesses have spoken of a violent thunderstorm at the time the plane
plunged into the field.
Mr Russell said the aircraft was equipped to fly in all conditions and
had been operating within its limits. No other flights from the airport
had to be delayed or cancelled yesterday because of the weather. He
described the crew as ''vastly experienced''.
The airline's other three aircraft of the same type were operating as
normal yesterday on routes between Leeds-Bradford, Southampton, and
Aberdeen.
Mr Savage said any decision to ground that type of plane would be up
to the Civil Aviation Authority.
The families of the 12 victims were brought together to be comforted
last night at a hotel in nearby Harrogate where they were spoken to by
clergy, specially-trained police officers, and scientific experts.
North Yorkshire assistant chief constable Paul Kernaghan said: ''The
most important people in this investigation are the next-of-kin.
''We felt it was important to remove speculation and give them hard
facts and let them speak to the senior police, coroner, pathologists,
and a senior medical adviser.''
Mr Kernaghan said an ''extremely complex'' investigation into the
cause of the accident involved the Air Accident Investigation Branch and
the Civil Aviation Authority.
The rare step of gathering most of the relatives together came as
police revealed human remains from the wrecked aircraft had been
scattered over a square mile.
Mr Kernaghan said all the bodies had tonight been recovered and
removed to a makeshift mortuary at RAF Linton-on-Ouse. The task would
now begin of recovering the debris and technical items from the
aircraft, which disintegrated when it hit the ground.
More than 100 North Yorkshire police officers were involved, helped by
nearly 50 Army personnel, RAF staff, and some officers from neighbouring
West Yorkshire.
Mr Kernaghan told a news conference at Leeds-Bradford airport: ''At
this stage, we have no particular theories about the crash.''
The investigators would have been assisted if the aircraft had been
carrying a black box but the Department of Transport said it was not and
was of a type that was not require to carry one because of its size.
Rules about just which planes should, or need not, carry flight data
recorders are laid down by aviation's world regulatory body, the
International Civil Aviation Organisation.
It has ruled that only aircraft of more than 5700 kilograms in weight
-- effectively those capable of carrying more than 20 passengers -- are
required to have the black boxes.
The black boxes -- they are in fact orange in colour -- contain a
recording of the last few minutes of any flight and have proved
invaluable to investigators determining just what went wrong before a
fatal accident.
Each recording lasts for only a few minutes and constantly updates
itself so the vital moments immediately before a crash are readily
available to investigators.
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: ''These flight data
recorders are very expensive to fit and require a good deal of
modification to aircraft. It is generally thought that they are more
appropriate in larger, more sophisticated planes.''
He added: ''Owners of a number of aircraft that do not need to fit
them, nevertheless have done so. Any change in the situation would be up
to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. For instance, the AAIB might
decide to recommend to us that all, or more, aircraft should be required
to fit them.''

A PROPOSAL being considered by management at Glasgow's Royal Hospital
for Sick Children could mean nurses being called out from home if an
urgent operation was required through the night.
The public service union, Unison, yesterday condemned what it
described as a cost-cutting exercise which would put children's lives at
risk.
Preliminary discussions have been taking place with eight night-shift
theatre nurses over the possibility that they no longer remained in the
hospital overnight but were ''on call'' for an emergency.
''No decision has been taken at this stage but, with the reduction in
junior doctors' hours and for safety considerations, it is becoming
apparent that operations after midnight are taking place less
frequently,'' a hospital spokesman said.
''A surgeon and anaesthetist will remain at Yorkhill to deal with
emergencies. It is preferable to operate during the day where possible
but, obviously, if we had to do it during the night we would.
''There is absolutely no suggestion that any nurse's job would be
threatened by the proposal and no decision will be taken until all the
parties involved have expressed their views. How long it took to call
them out would depend on where they lived and that is the sort of thing
that will have to be gone into.''
Mr Jim Devine, senior regional officer of Unison, said that closing
the theatre between the hours of midnight and 8am would reduce the
service which was presently being provided to nearly half of children
under 13 in Scotland.
''The proposal to put staff on call is insensitive and impractical,
because it would take approximately one to one-and-a-half hours from
initial call-out to having the operating theatre in use,'' he said.
''These delays will cause unnecessary trauma and anxiety, not just for
children but for their parents and the delays could cause even more
serious problems.
''Only in the last few weeks, children have been admitted to theatres
directly from accident and emergency units as a result of the
seriousness of their condition. If this theatre is not operating, then
clearly, lives are at risk.''
He said staff who worked in the theatres were outraged by the
proposals, and Unison had pledged to fight the move. The union had
approached local MP for Hillhead, Mr George Galloway, who intended to
raise the matter in Parliament.
The chief executive at the Yorkhill trust, Mr Gerry Marr, accused
Unison of being alarmist in its reaction to the proposals, which were at
a very early stage.
''They are still the subject of local negotiation at clinical
directorate level and have not come before the trust management,'' he
said. ''I do not know all the details myself but we will not make any
changes which compromise patient care. If a child needs surgery at 2am,
that child will receive it at 2am, no matter how we staff the
theatres.''
Mr Marr said it was a misconception that children came into accident
and emergency and were whisked straight into theatre within minutes. It
took time to stabilise them, during which the theatre had to be
prepared.
He acknowledged that setting up the theatre was a matter for a nurse,
which could not start until one of the on-call nurses had arrived from
home.
''One of the suggestions coming forward is that we leave one person on
who would prepare the theatre,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Piper Alpha judge to carry out 'nuts and bolts' review of Court of Session operation Scots civil justice under scrutiny</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S leading judge has announced a major ''nuts and bolts''
review aimed at making the country's supreme civil court more efficent
and taking it into the next century.
Lord Hope, the Lord President, admitted yesterday that a number of
aspects of the organisation of business in the Court of Session have
been causing him concern for some time.
The review follows swingeing criticism by the late Lord Morton of
Shuna and Lord Gill that the Court of Session was failing to meet the
needs of the public because procedures were outdated, slow, and too
expensive.
Lord Gill described the system of civil procedure as a contemporary
relic of a vanished age and called for a review of the whole civil
justice system in Scotland.
Lord Hope's review will be conducted by Lord Cullen, the judge who
conducted the Piper Alpha Inquiry. Lord Hope has invited him to provide
an interim progress report by October 31 and a full report by the end of
the year if possible.
In a memo to his fellow judges announcing the review, Lord Hope talks
of his concern about some aspects of the operation of the Court of
Session and adds: ''I have been unable, due to other commitments, to
give this the attention and leadership which is required. It seems to me
that the time has now come for a review of its work to be undertaken
with a view to seeing what improvements may be made to increase its
efficiency.''
Lord Cullen has been given a remit to review the manner in which Court
of Session business is administered, conducted, and allocated with a
view to making recommendations as to how it can be improved.
In particular, he will consider what measure can be taken to simplify
procedure and speed up the disposal of cases, achieve a greater degree
of judicial control and management of cases, tackle the problem of cases
settling at the last minute, and ensure judges' time is being used to
best advantage.
Fellow judges, advocates, and solicitors will be submitting their
views to Lord Cullen over the next few months.
Lord Hope described the review as ''penetrating and wide ranging'',
adding: ''I am examining the whole operation of the Court of Session
from the centre to see where changes can be made.''
There were different views on the merits and faults of the Scottish
system.
For example, the Scottish system of written pleadings in civil cases
was criticised from time to time, but he understood the Wolfe Report
reviewing civil justice in England had found some things in the Scottish
system attractive.
Some people thought wider use should be made of witness statements,
while others complained that this created enormous quantities of
paperwork at considerable expense and preferred witnesses to come to
court in person.
Lord Cullen's task would be to assess such competing views.
Lord Hope said that although there had been ad hoc reforms, such as
the introduction of special procedures to deal with commercial cases,
there was now a need to look at the whole system.
He added: ''I accept that we have real problems in meeting the demands
of civil litigation and the points raised by Lords Morton and Gill will
come into the remit (of the review).
''They have been raising points about procedure but I am looking right
down to the nuts and bolts of the entire operation so there is nothing
left untouched in the examination of what we do. I want to get right
into the system to see what the options are.
''It is a penetrating and wide-ranging review with a view to
increasing efficiency. That is the nature of the exercise. We have to be
sure that we are working from a suitable platform from which we can move
into the next century.''

HEAVY-DUTY wooden pallets may have been behind the M4 coach crash that
killed 10 Royal British Legion pensioners and injured 20 more.
A tourist told police yesterday he saw other motorists crashing into
or swerving to avoid debris from broken pallets seconds after the
Tuesday afternoon crash near the Severn Bridge.
Ex-Londoner Don Avard, 59, who now lives in Adelaide, Australia, said
his car struck a small piece of wood as he drove at 60mph on the
east-bound carriageway. He was interviewed by police, who told him other
motorists had made statements concerning the pallets.
Avon and Somerset police traffic department and Department of
Transport experts are involved in an inquiry into the crash which is
likely to last several weeks.
In a preliminary interview, coach driver Stephen Brown, 39, who
escaped with minor injuries, told how he swerved to avoid ''an object''
on the motorway. Mr Brown was breath-tested as a matter of routine, with
negative results.
An examination of the mangled wreckage of his coach has found no
faults in the steering, linkages, or tyres. The tachograph showed the
coach was being driven within the speed limit.
Mr Avard, a property manager, said he had been travelling towards
Bath. About 30 seconds after the crash his car struck part of a wooden
pallet.
He said: ''There were at least two heavy-duty pallets, broken and
strewn across the motorway. They were being broken up by passing traffic
while other drivers were swerving round them. Although the piece I hit
was not very big, there were some fairly big pieces.''
Police are seeking the driver of a blue vehicle, believed to be a
pick-up truck or small flat-bed lorry, which could have been carrying
wood or wooden pallets. It is thought to have been close to or in front
of the coach before the accident.
A spokesman said: ''It might be that the driver passed the scene
immediately before the accident or stopped immediately after. We are
hoping the driver will come forward, or perhaps any passengers. We are
not suggesting they caused this accident, but we would like to talk to
them for elimination purposes.''
The coach had been carrying a Legion party from an outing to Cardiff
back home to Christchurch, Dorset. It careered off the motorway, smashed
through boundary fencing and down an embankment.
Four more victims were named yesterday. They were retired factory
worker Bill Brooks, 68; his wife Phyllis, 65; 76-year-old Kathleen
Coombes; and widower David Law, 73.
Victims previously named were: John and Ivy Metcalf, both 86; William
Cooper 70, and his wife Peggy, 66; William Davis, 88; and James Walsh,
68. Eleven passengers remain in Bristol hospitals.

TWO immigrants on hunger strike in Scottish prisons were believed to
be back in Algeria today after being deported.
Mr Rached Barkou, 31, and Mr Khaled Mohammed were released into the
custody of immigration officials on Wednesday. They were taken to a
detention centre at London's Heathrow Airport due for deportation
yesterday.
They were among six Algerians who started a hunger strike 19 days ago
in Greenock Prison in protest at their incarceration while they sought
political asylum.
Mr Barkou and two of the others were transferred to Barlinnie Prison
in Glasgow earlier this week after staff at Greenock became concerned
about their medical condition. Mr Mohammed remained in Greenock.
The two immigrants still in Barlinnie reportedly stopped taking
liquids four days ago and their medical condition is thought to be
deteriorating. Supporters say one is extremely weak and finds both
walking and talking difficult.
The two Algerians who remained in Greenock jail have given up the
hunger strike and are said to be improving.
The day before he was taken from Barlinnie, Mr Barkou contacted The
Herald and sent a petition -- signed by prison inmates -- which
supported the call for asylum.
He said he was determined to continue the protest until his case was
heard. He was prepared to die rather than return to his native country,
where a bloody civil war between government forces and Islamic
fundamentalists has claimed up to 40,000 lives.
He said then: ''If there is a trace of justice in this country, we
can't lose.''
He feared he had been targeted by immigration officials for speaking
publicly about the plight of the Algerians.
A friend of Mr Barkou said he feared for the deported man's life. Mr
Michael Miller, 29, of London, is a British subject of Algerian descent.
He said: ''I was told he was deported yesterday after losing a lot of
weight on hunger strike. Now I am scared what might happen to him.''

A NAVY officer who bragged about having sex with a Wren without
realising he was drinking with her boyfriend has been fined at a court
martial.
Lieutenant Neil Gordon, 26, had been drinking when he made his boasts
about sexual exploits with two Wrens. He admitted later he had invented
the stories.
Engineering Officer Gordon, who comes from Dundee, admitted conduct
prejudicial to good order and naval discipline and allowing drinking on
the mess deck after 10.30pm.
He was fined #800 and severely reprimanded at the Plymouth court
martial. The sentences are subject to confirmation.
Lieutenant Commander Rod Blain, prosecuting, said Gordon was on
attachment from the Royal Navy Engineering College in Plymouth and was
aboard HMS Exeter at the time of the incident.
The ship had just returned from its duties as part of the Armilla
Patrol in the Gulf.
The ship had docked at Dubai and Gordon was due to leave it the next
day but he went down to the Stokers Mess where he drank five cans of
lager and started swopping stories with the ratings about Wrens.
Lieutenant Commander Blain told the court he spoke of sex acts with
two Wrens, whom he named.
''When the accused made his claims, one of the marine engineers
present became upset and left because he was at the time going out with
one of the girls and he thought fun was being made of him.''
Lieutenant Commander Mark Emerton said Gordon made up his sex claims
while drinking with others who were talking of sexual exploits.
He said: ''The talk turned to Wrens and pressure from the other made
Gordon tell his own stories.''
He added: ''He had a close working relationship with the men and want
to be accepted by them and he spoke to them in their own terms. He now
realises he made serious error of judgment and that the charges are
entirely of his own making.
''When he realised he had caused offence, he was mortified and he is
genuinely remorseful about this incident.''

EXCLUSIVE
THE Government is determined to prevent publication of the #137,500
consultants' report which proves that privatising ferry company
Caledonian MacBrayne would not make economic or social sense.
This was confirmed yesterday and opposition MPs accused the Government
of suppressing the report for selfish reasons.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Office is refusing to say whether it will
allow CalMac, whose sole shareholder is Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, to
tender for the main routes to Orkney and Shetland.
It was exactly two years ago today that Mr Lang, under Treasury
pressure, announced that, for the second time in four years, the
Government was considering the privatisation of CalMac.
International accountants KPMG were appointed to study CalMac and
ferry services in the Northern Isles where the privately owned P&amp;O runs
the main services with public subsidy.
KPMG's final report was delivered to the Scottish Office in the last
week of May 1994.
The following week, the Herald revealed that the consultants had
advised that any planned privatisation of CalMac meant no advantage to
the public purse and no benefit for services.
Mr Lang refused to comment on that report but, in September, he
announced: ''I am satisfied that CalMac operates economically and
efficiently under the present arrangements and provides a service of
high quality and reliability to the islands.''
Highland and Islands MPs have called repeatedly for the report to be
published. Yesterday, a Scottish Office spokeswoman said: ''The KPMG
report on Caledonian MacBrayne is not going to be published. It contains
commercially sensitive information and was not for public consumption.''
Last night, Mr Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, said:
''They are suppressing this report because it is good news for a
publicly owned company.
''It is outrageous that they have spent well over #130,000 of public
money, investigating a public company, and now they are going to prevent
the public from reading the conclusions of these investigations.
''They have always said they were worried about commercial sensitivity
but surely it can't be too difficult to cut out the sensitive figures.''
Little is known of the report's Northern Isles section but on the same
day as Mr Lang announced that CalMac would not be privatised, he also
announced the withdrawal of freight subsidies to Orkney and Shetland and
that the Tariff Rebate scheme would change to a block grant for
passenger and livestock services.
The main lifeline services would be put out to tender.
Yesterday, the Scottish Office would say only that this would happen
''as soon as possible''.
When asked if CalMac could tender, the official reply was that the
routes would be advertised in the Journal of the European Commission.
When pressed on their own company tendering, the reply was only: ''We
are not prepared to comment on speculation regarding potential offers to
run the service in advance of receipt of expressions of interest.''
CalMac's managing director Colin Paterson confirmed he would be
interested in tendering if allowed.

FOOTBALLER Duncan Ferguson was yesterday sentenced to three months in
prison at Glasgow Sheriff Court for assaulting a rival player on the
park.
The #4m Everton and Scotland striker, who previously played for Dundee
United and Rangers, was later released pending an appeal.
Ferguson, 23, was sentenced by Sheriff Alexander Eccles after having
been found guilty two weeks ago at the same court of head-butting Raith
Rovers defender John McStay during a match at Ibrox last year.
In view of Ferguson having three previous convictions for assault,
Sheriff Eccles had deferred sentence until yesterday for background
reports.
Ferguson's lawyer, Mr Donald Findlay QC, lodged an immediate appeal,
and Ferguson was granted interim liberty. The appeal is likely to be
heard in October in the High Court in Edinburgh. The court can reduce or
overturn the sentence but it also has the power to increase it.
Ferguson spent 90 minutes in the cells at the court before being
released.
He refused to comment as he faced a barrage of reporters and
television cameras.
Everton chairman Peter Johnson said: ''Duncan Ferguson's lawyers have
decided to lodge an appeal against the verdict and the sentence. Everton
FC is fully supportive of Duncan Ferguson. There will be no further
comment.''
Mr Findlay said he could make no comment pending the appeal.
Earlier in court, Mr Findlay had made a strong plea in mitigation for
Ferguson and urged the court to impose a sentence of community service.
However, Sheriff Eccles told Ferguson he was jailing him ''both in the
public interest'' and to bring home to Ferguson that such behaviour
could not be tolerated.
Ferguson looked shocked and briefly put his hands forward on to the
rail of the dock before being escorted from court by two officers.
In January 1992, Ferguson was fined #125 for head-butting a policeman,
and the following March was fined #200 for assaulting a man on crutches
after a row at a Stirling taxi rank.
Five months later, he was back in court and convicted of assaulting a
stranger in a Fife hotel bar. He was put on 12 months' probation in
September 1993 and told a jail sentence had been seriously considered.
Sheriff Eccles said yesterday: ''On this particular occasion, I would
accept it took place against a background of a highly charged football
match which, like many other sports, is a contact sport involving a
certain amount of violence.
''In addition, the other player involved was not seriously injured.''
However, the sheriff went on to say it was a ''clearly deliberate act''
which took place not in the course of play but after a stoppage.
He said Ferguson's ''previous convictions, while not involving
football matches, are in many ways similar. Various disposals have been
tried in the past with no apparent success.''
Mr Findlay had argued that the incident had happened in the heat of
the moment. It was the act of a young man who had since matured -- and
that other incidents in football had not been followed by prosecutions.
To back this, he showed the court videos of incidents at two other
Scottish matches: a pre-season friendly between Hearts and Raith Rovers
involving a ''punch-up'' between two Hearts' defenders and the Scottish
Junior Cup Final last May between Largs Thistle and Glenafton Athletic
in which two players from each side were sent off after a ''fracas''.
He also emphasised that Ferguson was a young man now maturing after a
period in which he had been less well-equipped to handle pressures.
As a youngster showing considerable talent he had attracted the
attentions of people ''who were not always well disposed to him''.
However, Mr Findlay said Ferguson had learnt much from his experiences
and had matured significantly and this was reflected in social inquiry
reports. He said Ferguson now worked with schools for special needs
children and was ''a superb ambassador for the club with his charity
work''.
He said incidents will occur in the course of a game which, if they
were to happen on the street, ''would inevitably lead to a charge of
assault''.
Many media representatives could not get in to the hearing, and
Everton chairman Peter Johnson and director Sir Philip Carter, were also
shut out. Mr Carter said: ''It was easier getting into our cup final at
Wembley last Saturday.''

THERE was anger in the Commons yesterday after it was disclosed
National Grid executives transferred thousands of shares into their
wives' names to reduce their tax liability.
Labour demanded that the executives of National Grid, owned by the 12
regional electricity companies, should resign.
However, the Prime Minister accused Labour of apparently wanting to
rewrite husband-and-wife tax laws after Mr Tony Blair attacked the four
directors.
Mr Major said: ''It is a fundamental principle that transfers of
property between husband and wife are free of tax and have been for a
long time.''
He accused Mr Blair of disagreeing with Shadow Chancellor Gordon
Brown, who said recently he supported share options.
Mr Blair said the question was whether realised share options should
be taxed as income or as a capital gain.
A Labour spokesman said later that the party favoured switching to
taxing them as income.
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Dr Jack Cunningham accused the
four of operating outside the spirit of the law and said the transfer of
shares to their wives was a ''seedy practice''.
''If they can't be trusted to pay their taxes, how can we trust them
to manage our utilities in the public interest? They should go,'' said
Dr Cunningham.
He accused National Grid chairman David Jefferies and the three other
directors of using a loophole to ''dodge'' the tax system.
Labour estimates that the National Grid shares passed to the four
wives could be worth nearly #1m. Mr Jefferies, has transferred almost
59,000 shares to his wife, and similar transfers have been made by
finance director John Uttley (29,000 shares), executive director Eric
Chefneaux (17,500 shares) and executive director Colin Gibson (9300
shares).
Mrs Jeanette Jefferies, 63, said at her home in Virginia Water,
Surrey: ''The money has been put back into the company. It is not for
personal use . . . .It is not like winning the National Lottery.''
Mr Blair criticised executives being remunerated by share options to
avoid income tax and then further reducing the liability by dividing the
shares with their wives. He demanded of Mr Major: ''Why don't you stop
defending the greed of a privileged few and stand up for the vast
majority of the British people.''
Mr Major responded that his reaction showed that the Opposition still
hated privatisation and profits. ''Old Labour lurks there as clearly as
it ever did.''
The issue was first raised by Labour MP Kate Hoey, who asked what sort
of message such transactions sent ''to pensioners in my constituency who
are struggling to make ends meet''.
A National Grid spokesman said the directors had parcelled out their
shares ''in a tax efficient way'' as did directors in many other
companies.
Labour was renewing its attack on Mr Jefferies who, it was disclosed
10 days ago, had made #365,000 by selling shares in his company although
it does not officially exist. The Grid, privatised in 1990, has no
shares until it is floated on the market this autumn at an expected
price of #4000m.
The company, however, operated a ''grey market'' of notional shares
which directors could buy from, or sell to, a special National Grid
Trust.
Mr Brown condemned Mr Jefferies for ''climbing on the gravy train
before it has even left the station''.

THE Scottish National Party swept to success in the Perth and Kinross
by-election last night, Roseanna Cunningham wresting the seat from the
Conservatives with a majority of 7311 over Labour.
The result was hailed by SNP leader Alex Salmond as a message to both
the Government and to Mr Tony Blair's new Labour that the SNP was on the
march: he called the seat a bridgehead for the party in its campaign to
break through in the central belt.
Mr Douglas Alexander for Labour forced the Tories into third place.
The result represented a swing from Tory to SNP of 11.55%. The
percentage vote of Mr John Godfrey for the Tories (21.43%) was a drop of
almost 19% from the General Election.
The SNP fought an intelligent campaign from the unaccustomed position
as favourite to take the seat held by the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn
with a majority of 2094 against Ms Cunningham at the last General
Election.
Both the Tory and Labour campaigns attracted criticism -- the former
as one-dimensional and personal in its attack on Ms Cunningham, and the
latter for the unrealistic victory hype emanating from the office of Mr
Blair.
Ms Cunningham told the packed audience in the count at Perth City Hall
last night that the people of Perth and Kinross had reopened the door of
constitutional opportunity for Scotland. ''There is a clear message in
this result for the Prime Minister.
''After 16 long years when the Tory Party have politically humiliated
Scotland, now it is Scotland's turn to humiliate the Tory party.''
Mr Salmond said: ''Victory was new Labour's target and they didn't
even come close. It is Tony Blair's first bloody nose as Labour leader.
He may be cock of the walk in middle England but he has sunk without
trace in mainstream Scotland.
''The Tories conducted the campaign as a constitutional referendum.
Now I want to know whether they accept the result.''
He added: ''This constituency is a bridgehead into central Scotland.
Kinross is only 10 miles from the Forth and that makes the victory here
of particular significance. It will give tremendous encouragement to SNP
voters throughout Scotland that the case for independence can work
here.''
Although the night belonged to the SNP, Labour attempted to make the
most out of coming second. Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson
said it was its best result in a by-election since the war.
The Conservative Party pointed out that the poll was well down on the
General Election figure, and claimed this showed that Conservative
supporters had stayed at home rather than vote for another party.
Mr Godfrey dismissed the defeat as a protest vote. Labour's Douglas
Alexander was clearly relieved to have come second, although only 630
votes separated him from the Tories.
The result is a further blow to the premiership of Mr Major and the
Tories now go on to another testing mid-term by-election at
Littleborough and Saddleworth in the north of England.
The result will also increase speculation over whether there may be
changes in the Scottish Office team. Having branded Ms Cunningham as a
republican socialist and dangerous separatist extremist, they must now
explain why the douce voters of Perthshire crossed over to her in
droves.
Ms Cunningham claimed the result was a message for all of the Unionist
parties in Scotland. ''The days when Scotland could be cheated out of
independence by conjuring up a concoction of smears, fears, bogy men --
and bogy women -- are coming to a close.''
She stressed: ''I hope not just this victory, but more the manner in
which the SNP conducted our campaign, makes it clear that ours is a
democratic message designed to include all the people of Scotland,
regardless of origin.''
The turnout was 62%, down on the 76.86% at the last General Election.
