SKYE is today joined to the mainland for the first time since
pre-historic times.
What if the Skye Bridge had been in place in the past?
Bonnie Prince Charlie could have legged it over the sea.
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME SERIOUS POINTS TO BE MADE ABOUT TODAY'S
MOMENTOUS OCCASION.
Some lament the loss of romance in the passing of the ferries.
But there is little romance if you're a local standing in the winter
snow and rain waiting for a boat.
The island folk in the main will welcome the new bridge.
But there is genuine concern about the level of tolls - said to be the
highest in Europe.
The set price of #5.40 is far too high, even although there will be a
discount for regulars.
And dozens of ferry jobs will go.
The successful completion of a challenging engineering task should be
applauded.
BUT THE OPERATORS MUST GET TOLL CHARGES DOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
Or else it could be a case of 'Will ye no' come back again'.

RENFREW'S Margaret Blackwood Housing Association deserves a big pat on
the back today.
Disabled Alex Findlay needed a a place to live and they had no house
suitable.
SO THEY SIMPLY WENT OUT AND GOT ALEX ONE THAT WAS.
With a grant from Scottish Homes, they bought and adapted a
ground-floor flat in Busby.
Alex is obviously a determined gentleman.
He wanted an independent life, and he fought for over a year to get
it.
Ten out of ten to him and the housing association.

PRESSURE on higher education means that some universities are in
danger of turning into municipal pumping stations rather than springs of
knowledge, students and guests at a graduation ceremony in Edinburgh
were told yesterday.
The comments were made by Professor Alistair MacFarlane, Principal and
Vice-Chancellor of Heriot-Watt University, where students in the Faculty
of Engineering and in Combined Studies were awarded their degrees.
Universities, he said, used to regard themselves as ''springs'' to
which eager students came to slake their thirst for knowledge.
He added: ''Some are now in danger of turning into municipal pumping
stations.
''The ancients took a commodity or comestible view of knowledge,
talking of drinking from the Pierian Spring, from which Shelley advised
us that we should drink deep or not at all.''
Professor MacFarlane emphasised that great strains were now appearing
in higher education, and there was now a need to look seriously at the
delivery and support systems in use.
He felt there were evident shortcomings, arising from treating
knowledge simply as a commodity, and warned that overcoming them would
be a long and painful business, with a great deal of careful research
required in order to inform policy making, and to guide development.
''Learning requires interaction and feedback. Such a view emphasises
the support of the learning process rather than the delivery of
knowledge,'' he said.
Despite the changing climate in higher education, Professor MacFarlane
concluded that the fundamentals of university life, such as a scrupulous
care for teaching and passion for research, remained.
* Honorary degrees were conferred on Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of
British Telecom, in recognition of his contribution to business and the
community, and Mr Ali Naimi, president and chief executive officer of
Saudi-based oil company Saudi Aramco, for his contribution to the
development and management of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas production.

DARREN Anderton's new four-year contract with Tottenham could clear
the way for Middlesbrough to sign Manchester United winger Andrei
Kanchelskis.
Old Trafford manager Alex Ferguson could have offered the unsettled
Ukrainian in an exchange deal for Anderton and Middlesbrough manager
Bryan Robson knew he could not compete with that prospect, but with
Anderton no longer in the equation, he is prepared to swoop.
The former United captain said: ''I believe we are in with a chance
with a straight cash deal. There has been speculation of a #4m bid and a
#5m bid. All I can say is it is definitely a Middlesbrough record.''
Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar is still keen to sign Kanchelskis, but
said yesterday: ''We cannot pay #6m.''
Robson added: ''The ball is in United's court. I got on well with
Andrei at Old Trafford. When he first came over I looked after him for a
couple of months until he settled in. That could help me in the current
situation.''
Anderton's new deal ended speculation about his future and he can
expect a #1.5m reward for staying in London.
The 23-year-old winger, signed from Portsmouth for #1.75m in 1992,
became England's most consistent forward in a series of disappointing
displays last seaso.

COLIN Montgomerie retained his lead in the second round of the
Scottish Open Golf Championship at Carnoustie yesterday. But instead of
holding it on his own by two strokes, as he was overnight, he had to be
content to share it with the former Australian Open champion, Wayne
Riley, who also is no stranger to this eminence.
On another day of high summer they had respective scores of 71 and 69
for totals of 135, nine under par, and a stroke ahead of a 40-year-old
Japanese. Katsuyoshi Tomori's 66 was not only the day's lowest score but
the only one without a bogey -- and that by a player who does not like
links and discounts his chances.
Tomori said he was just aiming to make the cut. ''What chance do I
have of winning? No chance,'' he said. ''I don't like links courses.''
He expects to have to qualify on Sunday and Monday for St Andrews,
''but I would really like one of the five top places here so I don't
have to qualify.''
Nick Faldo's 68 brought him threateningly into position on 138, a
stroke ahead of Paul Lawrie and David Feherty, both of whom have been
struggling badly this season -- 131st on the European Tour and 181st on
the US equivalent. In respect of a doemstic challenge for the title Sam
Torrance, on 141, remains in touch.
Appropriately and impressively, the amateur champions of Britain and
the United States, Gordon Sherry and Tiger Woods, who may well be
locking horns as matchplay opponents in September's Walker Cup match,
survived the 36-hole cut, although Stephen Gallacher, the European
champion, did not.
Conditions were again far removed from Carnoustie's ''Caledonian stern
and wild'' reputation of fame and fable. The sun shone hotly all day,
but was cooled by a breeze now from the south-east, the opposite
direction from the three previous days. Its influence, along with the
continuous burnishing and hardening of the 7187-yard course, dictated
that no liberties could be taken.
Among those to learn the meaning of hard times, Severiano Ballesteros
apart, were the US Masters champion Ben Crenshaw, whose only four
birdies in 36 holes came on an inward half which, however, also included
two double-bogey 6s; French Open champion Paul Broadhurst; the last two
winners, Carl Mason and Jesper Parnevik; and the Australian Brett Ogle
in the wake of having tantalisingly lost the US Tour's Western Open.
Vijay Singh rose from 67 to 75 and Pierre Fulke from 69 to 78, and
Tommy Armour III was a long way from following in the footsteps of his
illustrious grandfather, winner of the 1931 Open Championship over the
course. From 21 scores below 70 on Wednesday the number reduced to nine.
The erratic scoring paths must have induced a certain throbbing of the
brain to the players. Thus Ricki Kawagishi began with six 5s and Ronan
Rafferty with four 3s as Feherty, his fellow Ulsterman, holed the
179-yard eighth in one with a No.6 iron. No-one could complain at a lack
of incident.
When Montgomerie pitched to a foot at the third he went nine under
par, and since he subsequently dropped four strokes, he was pleased to
have gained four to regain that mark. Now, in disciplining his ambition
to win the title, he will ''try not to force the issue and just let the
shots happen as they come.''
Montgomerie's most serious wobble came at the fifth and long sixth, at
both of which he took 6, his first dropped strokes. The double bogey
followed a thin chip across the green in three, and he only escaped
another at the next when a thinly-clad spectator braved the gorse into
which he had hit his second and found the ball with little time to
spare.
Riley has a history of producing low scores without being able to hold
four rounds together, so that in 13 years he had won four times in the
Antipodes, the last, the Australian title in 1991, but never in Europe.
Recently he has taken up with Gary Smith, the Camberley Heath
professional, as his coach, under whose supervision Riley has tightened
up, rather than altered, his swing in an attempt to gain greater
consistency. Five birdies more than allowed him to recover from his two
mistakes and a resolute five-foot putt for par at the last salvaged his
second shot into the Barry Burn.
Although Faldo had two bogeys he otherwise had a neatly assembled
card. He made 4s at two of the three long holes and 2s at all three of
the short holes.
Lawrie's fortunes have developed a habit of blooming to coincide with
the Open Championship. His last three finishes have been twenty-first,
sixth, and twenty-fourth, from which he has earned some #50,000.
Torrance, to his credit, did not run out of steam after his Irish
exertions and he and Ian Woosnam, who were partners, are always easy to
watch. Besides being the accomplished players they are their pace of
play makes one wonder what is so difficult about this game that so many
take so long to play it.
Woosnam led at nine under after three birdies in the first six holes,
but slipped back with bogeys at the ninth and tenth. His driving,
uncertain in the breeze because of his tendency not to complete the
backswing, inflicted severe damage at the twelfth; he was unplayable in
a whin bush from the tee, became entangled in another and took 8, a
quadruple bogey.

RANGERS last night were preparing a last-gasp attempt to bring
Romanian World Cup star Florin Raducioiou to Ibrox after the
Spanish-based player claimed he had turned his back on the move.
The Espanol striker had insisted that he was ready to stay in Spain
and that a move to Scotland was off.
But Rangers, bolstered by what looks to be an easy draw in the
preliminary round of the European Cup, and the probability of a
Champions League bonanza awaiting them, are determined that they will
not give in easily.
Manager Walter Smith may fly to Spain in an effort to persuade the
player that his future lies with the Scottish champions alongside the
man he played with in Italy, Brian Laudrup.
Meanwhile yesterday in Spain, Raducioiou declared: ''I will stay with
Espanol and honour the remainder of my contract.
0 ''A great deal of the transfer talking which has gone on has taken
place behind my back. My agent has talked to Espanol and to Rangers.
Espanol have talked to Rangers and have agreed a transfer fee. But
no-one has talked to me.
''I do not want to leave Espanol. It is as simple as that.''
It may seem so to Raducioiou, but not to the rest of us. Last week he
was telling fellow players at the Spanish club that he was ready to move
and this week it has been suggested that Espanol have been trying to
hike up the price.
All along the player's agent has insisted that the transfer will go
ahead, and there has been no doubt at all that Espanol need the money.
One club insider admitted last night: ''Espanol are in the red and
that is why they want to sell Raducioiou to Rangers. Quite bluntly, if
Espanol do not get this money they will be in trouble with the banks.''
Certainly, he seemed to have given little thought to the club's
financial plight last night as he announced his decision.
''I will be clearing this whole affair up with my agent and with the
club,'' he snapped. ''I am not happy at the way things have happened.
There are two more years left on my current contract and I wish to stay
at least until it ends.''
Rangers have kept the door open longer than they intended, but if
Raducioiou turns his back on the transfer, manager Walter Smith and
chairman David Murray will target a new big-name signing.
Money is no object to the Ibrox club, who want to have another star to
line up alongside their other close-season purchase, Paul Gascoigne. The
fact that they are now odds-on to reach the Champions' League after the
preliminary round draw gives them, potentially, even more spending
power.
Meanwhile, Rangers' security chief, Alastair Hood, has taken steps to
ensure that the Ibrox club's visit to Cyprus next month on Champions'
Cup business will be free from trouble.
Hood, who has contacted the National Intelligence Crime Service's
special football unit to place them on alert, said: ''The unit has files
on known trouble-makers, people who are not necessarily football fans,
but who are always ready to disrupt games.''
Hood recognises that there are added risks surrounding the game
against Anorthosis, which will be played in Larnaca. British troops are
still stationed on the island, and further complications could come from
holidaymakers who may want to see the game, and who may also want simply
to get a glimpse of Gascoigne.
Hood has attempted to make sure that Anorthosis only sell tickets to
their own supporters. He said: ''We held talks with the Cypriot club at
the draw in Geneva and received assurances from them about ticket
distribution.''

DUDLEY Wood will retire as secretary of the Rugby Union today with
words of warning for future stewards of the game.
The departure of the hard-line champion of amateurism comes a month
before the word ''amateur'' -- or at least the concept of an amateur
international player -- could be erased from the International Board
regulations.
Wood said: ''I see dangerous territory ahead. Players will be giving
up good jobs because of their increased earning powers from the game and
increased playing commitments around the world.
''They will be under contracts, and some will be unpleasantly
surprised when their sport is their employer.''
Cornishman Bill Bishop, meanwhile, will be elected president at the
AGM.

YORKSHIRE chief executive Chris Hassell was hoping to meet his old
county, Lancashire, in the NatWest trophy -- but in the final, not in
the last eight.
The Roses rivals were paired together in yesterday's quarter-final
draw and Hassell said: ''It's going to be a huge game, but I'm a bit
disappointed that we're not going to get the chance of a
Yorkshire-Lancashire final.
''I expect that there will be a capacity or near capacity crowd, and I
would have thought that we could give Lancashire a fair number of the
19,000 tickets.
''In all my 13 years at Lancashire I can't remember a NatWest tie
between the two clubs. The draw is:
At Headingley: Yorkshire v Lancashire. At Cardiff: Glamorgan v
Middlesex. At Derby: Derbyshire v Warwickshire. At Bristol:
Gloucestershire v Northamptonshire. (Matches to be played on August 1).

WORLD champion Tony Allcock lines up at Westburn Park, Aberdeen, today
looking for a first win in the Woolwich Scottish Masters.
Allcock is eyeing the #3000 first prize that his England international
colleague Andy Thomson won last year with a last-bowl success against
Comonwealth champion Richard Corsie.

GRAEME Obree struck cycling gold again in the World Cup track series
in Adelaide, shattering the Australian record on the way.
The 27-year-old flying Scot, Britain's one-man band at this important
meeting, was right on song despite the chilly conditions. He covered the
4000 metres in 4min 27.21sec, clipping almost half a second off the
Australian record set by Deans Woods in March last year.
Obree broke the record in his qualifying heat, as did his great rival,
Frenchman Philippe Ermenault, who clocked 4-27.70. Local hope Hayden
Bradbury was third best with 4-35.97.
In the final, Obree got off to a bad start, recovered and finished the
fast course in 4min 28.28sec. Ermenault could not match this and was
more than two seconds slower in 4-30.48.
It was a great night for the former world champion, who has set his
sights on regaining the world title in Colombia in October. This was his
second gold medal in three World Cup meetings, and he hopes to make it
three in Tokyo on Tuesday.

BRITAIN'S Max Sciandri chalked up his first Tour de France stage win
yesterday after an 81-mile breakaway.
The Italian-based rider was one of eight to break free of the field on
the first climb of the day, but as none were a threat in the overall
standings the race leaders, tired after two gruelling days in the Alps,
did not bother to give serious chase. Miguel Indurain retained the
yellow jersey with an advantage of 2min 27sec over Alex Zuelle.
Afterwards, Derby-born Sciandri, who has an Italian father and English
mother, said: ''I was never sure at any time I would win the stage. Even
in a sprint, anything can happen.''
Sciandri has been a professional since 1989, racing as an Italian. But
he took out a British licence this season because he had been unable to
fight his way into the Italian team for the Olympics and World
championships.
Sciandri and Colombian Hernan Buenahora broke away from the leading
group on the penultimate pass and the former had a clear advantage as a
specialist sprinter.

SITTING proudly among the qualifiers for the last two days, alongside
the letter A (for amateur), is the name of Gordon Sherry, Kilmarnock's
king-sized Scottish champion, who put up a remarkable performance to
shoot a 70 for a one-under-par 143, especially as his appearance here
followed a team contest in Belgium when he played 10 rounds in six days.
The big 21-year-old, sporting the colours of his local team, had been
tempted to pull out on Wednesday morning as he felt so exhausted. He
didn't look like a tired man yesterday. Beaming, gleaming, and excited,
Sherry was ready for more and will be in place today to see if he can
maintain this tremendous run.
In Belgium, he and Stephen Gallacher won the European Team
Championship, adding that prestigious title to the individual ones they
have collected already this year.
Sherry has withstood the demands better than his smaller pal and rival
who had a 77 for a nine-over-par 153 and will now get a well-earned
rest.
His team-mate reckoned the adrenalin of the event has kept him going.
''It was great to play with Carl Mason, who is a realy nice guy, and
last year's champion, as well as Jesper Parnevik, who was second in last
year's Open.
Sherry had hit his drive at the last out of bounds on Wednesday but
this time kept the biggest club in his bag right through the round,
using a No.3-wood.
''I used it four times on Wednesday and each time it was rubbish. I
came here hoping to get two respectable scores and I have done that,''
he said.
Inevitably, he is being hoisted as the British rival to Tiger Woods,
the American amateur champion who has also done tremendously well to
reach the halfway point at four under.
''I hope it isn't hyped up to become a war. I am not looking for any
confrontation with Woods . . . until the Walker Cup.''
Sherry countered two bogeys, at the fifth and eleventh, with four
birdies at the sixth, twelfth, sixteenth, and eighteenth.
His play impressed his two partners, and not only because he outscored
them comfortably.
''He has all the shots,'' said Parnevik, ''and could be very good. He
seems to have the right temperament.''
Mason who, along with Sam Torrance, will play a practice round at St
Andrews on Monday with the young star, who is one of Bob Torrance's
pupils, was equally enthusiastic.
''There is a big difference, of course, between amateurs and
professionals but he definitely has a chance. He looks cool and played
very well.''

THE sun shone, the grass glowed a bright emerald, the throng was in
great humour, there was some thrilling golf, but the world was not a
nice place. Seve, the one and only Seve, is playing like a
10-handicapper.
Ballesteros left Carnoustie yesterday, his golfing brains scrambled,
his game a parody of the past, watched by a giant army of well-wishers
devastated at the sight of the superstar of the eighties walking away
from a tournament he would have dominated in his heyday.
Somebody up there is playing nasty tricks on our hero. Yet, in the
immediate aftermath of his second-round 80, following his opening 81,
Seve retained a dignity, an honesty, and a courtesy that ought to be a
blueprint for others of less talent.
It is not much fun, none the less, listening to a man who was the
legitimate and only successor to Arnold Palmer, who could draw crowds
like no-one else on the European Tour, sound so utterly bemused as to
what has gone wrong with the swing which was once the model everyone
else tried to ape.
''I don't know which way the ball will go,'' he said, shaking his head
ruefully, ''and when I take the club back I don't feel comfortable.''
His 81 on Wednesday left him pretty demoralised and explains why he
went around the course relaxed and unflustered. ''I didn't have any
motivation after yesterday but I wanted to try to play better. I am
working to find how to get better but it seems I am going backwards.''
The man who has won three Opens and two US Masters has now missed the
cut in his last four competitions, a record he has never experienced,
although he was not aware of it . . . ''I'm not counting these things.''
The fact that, in a year when he might not be a safe bet to win the
Haggs Castle medal, Seve actually won the Peugeot Spanish Open in May
says a great deal about his will-power, but maybe not a lot about the
challengers.
''I have been through this before,'' he said. ''Hopefully, I will come
out of it again.''
For those of us who have been admirers, the fall and fall of
Ballesteros is bad enough but, for the game in general, it is close to
disastrous. He may not have delighted everyone with his cavalier,
single-minded march up the fairways but the sponsors, the turnstiles,
and the fans loved it. The People's champion had the charisma, the
daring that separates the true leader from the pretenders and there is
no sign of a successor on the horizon.
The painful details of his round yesterday must be skipped over
quickly. A double bogey 6 at the fourth, bogeys at the sixth, seventh,
twelfth, and seventeenth, and a double bogey 6 to finish for a halfway
aggregate of 161, seventeen over par, tell the depressing tale.
Asked if he had been seeking advice from too many coaches, thus
getting too many answers, the ex-champion dashed our hopes when he
replied: ''I have been talking to no-one.''
He will rest before he heads for St Andrews next week, although he
confessed that, if it had been anything other than the Open, he probably
would have gone home.
''I hope I can do a little bit better there. The course is more open
and all I have to do is go a little bit left, out and in. So, I
definitely will do better. If I can do that I am sure I will be able to
break 80.''
Seve has had recurring back trouble but is not using that as an
excuse. ''Nothing is good about my golf just now. It is all bad. But I
have a good family.''
It may not be much consolation but the great man actually had a
desperate time the last time he played Carnoustie, in the Open of 1975.
That was when he was 18, before he exploded on to the major stage, and
he disappeared from the championship following two rounds of 79 and 80.
Until yesterday he had not recorded two successive rounds quite as bad.
He is not 18 any more, however, and the road ahead looks bleak.
Off to lunch he went, signing autographs, patting little boys heads.
For much of the day his aggregate score was the worst in the field. Is
it really adios?
It was for the time being for Davis Love III, the American who is
invariably strongly fancied by those in the know when he plays over
here, except that he hasn't ever quite lived up to that inside info.
He had a genuine excuse for his showing this time, pulled stomach
muscles which forced him to retire after 13 holes of his second round.
Love, who shot a mediocre 75 on Wednesday, had not been making up much
ground. The opposite was the case, in fact.
He had gone to four-over-par for the day, seven over for the
tournament, and maybe he was entitled to call it a day if he wants to
try again next week at St Andrews.

<HEADLINE>Unhappy Accies as Duffield moves to Airdrie</HEADLINE>

HAMILTON last night lost out when top scorer Peter Duffield, who is
out of contract, joined Lanarkshire and first division rivals Airdrie --
just as manager Iain Munro was about to do a deal with Dundee United for
the player.
Hamilton had valued Duffield at #250,000, yet Airdrie's valuation is
only a fifth of that. But it is the way in which the deal was done which
has upset Munro.
A more volatile man would have been tearing his hair out at the
events, but Munro, one of the more mild-mannered among the managerial
brigade, simply expressed deep disappointment.
Duffield joined the Scottish side from Sheffield United two years ago
for a fee of #30,000, but in that period he has been the club's top
scorer and one of the most prolific marksmen in the country.
And Munro revealed that Airdrie were not the only club who were
interested in signing the striker. ''Earlier in the season, Dunfermline
asked me for my valuation of Peter and I told their manager Bert Paton
that it was #250,000. He had the courtesy to phone me back.
''Only on Wednesday we had an inquiry from Dundee United, offering
#170,000 and a player in part exchange. That package amounted to around
#220,000, so they weren't far away. And, as we are reasonable people, I
am sure we could have worked something out. But we haven't had a chance
to negotiate.
''Airdrie did phone us to ask for a price and I told them what we were
asking. They didn't phone back and the next thing I heard was that Peter
had signed for them.
''I would have thought that because of the relationship between the
two clubs we could have talked some more about it.
''Their #50,000, however, comes nowhere near our price and it looks
like having to go to a tribunal. Peter has scored more than 40 goals in
about 60 matches for us, and he is only 26.''
Meantime Airdrie defender Graham Hay is quitting the Tennents Scottish
Cup finalists. The 29-year-old building society manager was the only
part-time player involved in this season's Hampden showpiece, when
Celtic beat Airdrie 1-0 in May, but now he is following legends like
Billy McNeill and John Greig by retiring after a Scottish Cup final --
but for altogether different reasons.
Hay feels he cannot continue in his dual role and must give more time
to his day job as the Leeds prepares to merge with the Halifax.
Jerren Nixon of Dundee United's is on the verge of joining FC Zurich
for #250,000. It is understood the Swiss club have been negotiating a
deal to buy the 22-year-old West Indian and his transfer out of
Tannadice could be completed in the next few days.
Another unsettled United player -- striker Craig Brewster -- could
find himself in a transfer Catch 22 next week after being linked with a
move to Swindon.
United are due to meet the English club in a pre-season friendly in
Finland, but Brewster may not go on the trip, thus missing the chance to
impress them if he remains unsigned.

FIVE years ago, Noureddine Morceli was not even the fastest runner in
his own family. His elder brother, Abderrahmane, was the Algerian 1500
metres record holder. But now, Noureddine holds the world records at the
mile, and 1500m, 2000m, and 3000m, as well as the world bests at 1000m
and 1500m indoors.
He has won three world 1500m titles -- two outdoors, one in -- yet at
25, claims he is only getting into his stride.
He believes he can hold every world record from 800m to 10,000m, and
the old-fashioned linear distances for good measure. On the evidence of
the past fortnight, very few would bet against it.
On Wednesday in Nice, Morceli smashed his own three-year-old world
1500m mark. Just 10 days earlier, he had carved a whacking three seconds
from the 2000m best, removing the last world performance of his
much-lauded Arabian predecessor, Morocco's Said Aouita.
Morceli may make an attempt on his mile record in Oslo a week tonight
-- he refused to run when he believed he was being short-changed last
year -- and yesterday confirmed he will try to lower the 1500m mark
again a week on Tuesday, in Monte Carlo: ''My real motivation is to
reach 3min 25sec,'' he said.
If he succeeds, it would be the most dazzling packaging of records
since Steve Cram's three in 19 days in 1985.
Those were the days when British middle-distance runners ruled the
world: the era of Coe, Ovett, and Cram. But Morceli is intent also on
writing out the best of all their achievements, for he insists that the
oldest of the world middle-distance marks is within his sights -- the
800m time of 1min 41.73sec set by Coe in 1981.
It is 10 years this week since Cram set a world 1500m best of 3-29.67
on the same Nice track, one of the most breathtakingly memorable races
ever. Cram finished just four-hundredths of a second ahead of Aouita in
the first sub 3-30 1500m (3-43.00 is the equivalent of a four-minute
mile).
Cram reflected that Morceli's record time of 3-27.37 would have left
him and Aouita 20 yards adrift.
If reflection is daunting for the Geordie, it is no less so for those
who lament the passing of the British endurance contingent who bestrode
the world. When Morceli eclipsed Cram's time in 1993, the world mile
record had been monopolised by the British since 1979. This year, the
nearest Briton is more than seven seconds -- half the length of the home
straight -- behind the Algerian.
Morceli's best mile is two seconds quicker than Cram's fastest; three
seconds better than Coe's; and four seconds better than Ovett's. And
when he set the world's fastest indoor 1500m time, it was another
Briton, Peter Elliott, whose record was eclipsed.
Morceli's 3000m world record of 7-25.11 (almost two successive
four-minute miles) was the biggest improvement since Kip Keino 29 years
earlier. When he broke the four-year-old 1000m indoor record it was the
first time he had run the distance.
It was the exploits of his elder brother which first inspired the
younger Morceli. Abderrahmane placed fourth behind Ovett in the 1977
World Cup 1500m, and took bronze at the distance in the World Student
Games that year.
These achievements were enough for him to be voted his country's best
athlete, and he asked if the government, as a token of gratitude, might
install electric light in their humble home in a fishing village on the
shores of the Mediterranean, where Noureddine was one of nine brothers
and sisters.
The Algerian government responded by giving the family a completely
new house, and Noureddine immediately grasped that athletics could light
up his life in other respects. He now commands a reputed fee of #50,000
per race, but insists that records and titles, not money, are what
motivate him.
But he has fallen out of affection for his native land, and has become
a nomad, wandering far from the little village of Tenes. He is equally
at home in California, where he studied, or at any of the five-star
watering holes on the world athletics circuit.
Though never intimidated by the starting pistol, the political
revolution and militancy of his native land worries him. ''Some people
are crazy,'' he said. ''If you are a symbol, some people are against
you.''
The Quran goes everywhere with him, and he prays five times daily. He
has only once competed at the world indoor event, which falls during the
30-day day-time fast of Ramadan. ''I respect my religion too much,'' he
told me. ''I have to respect God -- I am very close to God.''
A fourth world title, in Sweden next month, seems a formality,
provided he avoids the kind of controversy in which he was accused of
paying another runner to pace-make for him when he won the title two
years ago. The allegations were investigated and no action taken.

IN COMMON with much that is written about Northern Ireland, Craigavon
Borough Councillor Fred B Crowe's letter (July 8) is somewhat slanted
and misleading.
Certainly, along with the usually establishment-supporting Cardinal
Cahal Daly, Sinn Fein were indeed highly critical of the substance and
poor timing of the decision to release Lee Clegg.
However, along with that of some members of the Loyalist community and
the mainland family of a British soldier, the great emphasis of Sinn
Fein's response to Clegg's release has been to seek a similar degree of
clemency for other prisoners, many of whom are currently serving lengthy
sentences in England and Ireland, never having killed anyone.
Councillor Crowe was correct in his assertion that we are not in
possession of all the information on which the Life Sentence Review
Board reached its less than unanimous decision. One person certainly
privy to this information was Mrs Breidge Gadd, who resigned as a full
member of the board following its meeting last month at which Clegg's
release was recommended.
On July 4, quoting from a statement allegedly issued by her, a
Northern Irish daily newspaper, the Irish News, claimed that Mrs Gadd
had resigned because she regarded the early review granted to Clegg by
the board as a ''major deviation from principles of practice and
procedure''.
Was Councillor Crowe pulling our legs when he suggested that public
figures refrain from making public comment on individual cases? Had this
suggestion been rigidly adhered to in the past, the extremely fortunate
Clegg, in company with the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and
others, would still be firmly lodged behind prison bars.

IN your business section of July 6 an article was headed ''Scottish
firms fear devolution'' and reported that this contrasted with the view
of multinationals.
There is no breakdown between firms manufacturing end-products and
those who are only agents or franchise holders importing foreign goods
for sale in Scotland. A Scottish parliament would encourage domestic
manufacturing production, which would be anathema to the latter group.
Many years ago the CBI mounted a fierce campaign against the raising
of barriers to imported foreign finished goods. This seemed
extraordinary coming from an association representing British Industry.
It took some time to find out that groups of importers in the CBI had
mounted the successful campaign against any threat from UK producers
entering this particular market.
Can you expect a company, with few overheads and employees, an inward
investment to cover plant and stocks, and a comfortable profit margin on
sales, actually encouraging Scottish manufacturing to be given life by a
Scottish parliament.
My views on Scottish industry and management were coloured by my
experience as an engineering graduate apprentice in Liverpool. The
company was an English multinational communication one, and the date was
a lifetime ago!
In a pub round the corner from our factory, and a large biscuit
complex with a famous Scottish name, I chose to express some pride in
Scottish manufacturing achievement, to a group of fellow engineers.
Alas! Beside us, was a group of managers from the biscuit company and
one executive from their parent company followed my ''oration'' by one
on the mediocrity of the owners and management of the Scottish biscit
industry.
Five or six companies in Scotland held the potential to control the
world biscuit business as one group, but were content to battle with
each other in Scotland. He outlined how overseas groups had surveyed all
the assets involved, then took over the middle companies. The proceeds
of asset-stripping helped to fund the takeover of the remaining
companies.
He was challenged about the success story of the Scottish whisky
industry, but he preferred us to say ''The whisky industry in Scotland''
as there was as little Scottish ownership of whisky as of biscuits!
What happened to the tyre industry? The aircraft industry in Glasgow?
The motor-vehicle industry? Why did we graduates have to leave Scotland
for a recognised apprenticeship (a sore point, this)?
Why did so many successful firms in Scotland get themselves taken over
by ''foreign'' competitors, and the management run off clutching the
cash?
Perhaps a Scottish parliament is going to ask the questions I faced in
Liverpool many decades ago, and demand answers from the frightened firms
in your article.

A FIRESIDE ornament now, retired early for health reasons, the
allotted span behind me, I contemplate my quietus, as I take stock of my
lifetime.
O memory though midway world 'twixt earth and paradise,
Where things decayed and loved ones lost,
In dreamy shadows rise.
Reared in the slums, immersed in the local religious activities, where
we were shown the straight and narrow path by the ''good people'' --
those who prayed and sang hymns, were nicely dressed, well-spoken, and
pleasantly mannered (teachers were my early heroes).
Then, thrown into the great big buzzing world, wide-eyed and
idealistic, full of the wonder of it all.
The observation that there are teachers of philosophy, but no
philosophers, became increasingly apparent to me. The Manichaean
teachings of my boyhood were tottering daily: ''Between the idea and the
reality, between the motion and the act -- falls the shadow.''
The final dawning, that those engaged in the ghastly bloodbaths of the
world were not hordes of amoral and immoral atheists but the ''good
people'' -- those who had been schooled in the good, the true, and the
beautiful, and received religious instruction, or at least held a belief
in a God. The sermon edifies, the example destroys.
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt
But, being season'd with a gracious voice,
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?

MAGNUS LINKLATER's excellent piece (July 12) on the last takeover
battle for the Scotsman took me back almost 40 years to the truly
titanic struggle between Roy Thomson, the then owner of the Scotsman,
and Sir Hugh Fraser (later to become Lord Fraser of Allander) for
control of the then Glasgow Herald.
As a young reporter on The Herald I well remember at the height of the
struggle a late-evening visit by Sir Hugh to the Buchanan Street
newsroom.
With the inevitable cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth,
Sir Hugh made his round of all the reporters on duty that night.
''Are you with me, laddie?'' he inquired at each one of us. We were
with him to a man -- and a woman!
Whether apocryphal or not (I am inclined to believe it) Sir Hugh is
reported to have said: ''There is just no way this that this upstart of
a Canadian is going to take over 'Scotland's greatest newspaper'.'' And
he didn't.
The Herald was saved by Sir Hugh and we are surely in his debt even to
this day!

I OFTEN get frustrated when reading The Herald letters column. I
suspect that I am not alone. The number of subjects demanding response
is often so varied that it is impossible to decide what kind of response
to make, so none is made at all.
There are however two letters in this morning's issue (July 12) which
I cannot ignore, demanding that I attempt to kill two birds with one
stone.
First, D R Williamson and Strathclyde roads. How fortunate he is to
only have a hole in the pavement. Yet again I have a vehicle undergoing
expensive repairs because of damage caused by potholes and broken
verges. Tarmacadam was invented in Ayrshire and the first macadamised
road was laid in Maybole, yet what have we got? Only the worst road
surfaces in the world.
It would appear that our potholes are put in with the new surface, for
they appear within weeks of repairs being carried out. I trust that upon
the demise of Strathclyde Regional Council, when the golden handshakes
are being dispensed, the roads department will not figure among them,
and may even in fact pay us!
Secondly, in reply to Matthew Smith and his ''tartan tax''.
Independence for Scotland means the same for England, therefore there
is no West Lothian question as far as I am concerned. I have no interest
in what happens in England. They can cut their anchor chain and drift
away for all I care.
As for tax, as we currently provide sufficient funds to England to
allow them to follow ruinous economic policies, I can't see why we
should have to pay more. As an independent country we will not be
contributing to the English Exchequer. Logic therefore tells you that we
can well afford to look after ourselves, at no extra cost. (Providing we
have decent roads!)

I HAVE just paid my TV licence of #86.50.
It is a scandal that a person over 90 years of age, alone in the house
and suffering from a disability that keeps him practically housebound,
should have to pay the same amount as a household of TV enthusiasts.
Further, when I seek a light relaxing programme of light music, the
type that never dies, either on TV or radio, all I can get is a
deafening surge of hurdy-gurdy noises barely drowned out by some
squalling weirdie.
We used to throw halfpennies out of the window at such performers to
induce them to move their talented efforts far along the street to the
precincts of distant and unpopular relatives.

MR David Rowan Henderson always endeavours to finish his letters with
a flourish. His letter of July 11 was no exception. It was obvious from
this letter that he has been recollecting, in the tranquillity of his
old age, his classical education. The conclusion of this letter suggests
that he aspires to the rhetorical felicity of Cicero.
Regular readers of this page will know that this is his third letter
''anent Private Clegg''. They also know that when he gets to grips with
a subject he worries it to death with a tenacity that must be envied by
every breed of terrier known to man. Only the most uncharitable among us
would claim that this tenacity borders on obsession.
The consistent thread which runs through Mr Rowan Henderson's
philippics is a lament for the former greatness of Britain and her
vanished empire.
In his many letters -- serial dirges might be a better description --
he has claimed that symptoms of decline and fall of Great Britain are,
among other things, compensation paid to women who were forced to give
up promising careers in the armed forces when they became pregnant and
the fact that members of the armed forces who are injured or become ill
as a direct result of their employment by the Ministry of Defence can
now sue for compensation.
There was also his letter of September 22, 1994, which contained the
bizarre suggestion that the economy of this country would benefit if we
adopted the motto of Hitler's death camps, Arbeit macht frei. He did not
go so far as to advocate that the country should become one large
concentration camp where the workers would be worked, starved, beaten or
gassed to death.
Mr Rowan Henderson's letters remind me of Cato the Elder whose
speeches ended with the refrain, ''Carthage must be destroyed''
regardless of their main themes. Our antique Roman from Ardfern is not,
as the style of his letters tries to suggest, another Cicero. He is none
other than Bonny Cato of Argyll.

I READ your editorial, Decision time in Bosnia, with a mixture of
incredulity and disbelief as it would be difficult to find a more
effective formula for indecision than those contained in some of your
assertions (July 12).
Can you really belief that ''all military experience since the Korean
War . . . shows the limitations of air power even when deployed on a
huge scale''? I seem to remember something called the Gulf War which was
won substantially by the effective use of massive air power.
Similarly, can you really be so ingenuous as to argue other than
deviously or tongue-in-cheek that Bosnian Serb action ''has cost them
the support of their kinsmen in Serbia proper''?
In fact the heightening political mood in the United States for
determinate action is a consequence of increasing evidence that the
Yugoslav/ Serbian Government is not only assisting the Bosnian Serbs but
is actually directing them.
A US military intelligence report released in part to the American
media last week indicated that the shooting down of Captain Scott F
O'Grady's F-16 fighter by a Serb SA-6 anti-aircraft missile on June 2
was only achieved by the use of the sophisticated integrated air defence
system centred in Belgrade under the command of the Yugoslav Army Chief
of Staff, General Momcilo Perisic, who reports directly to President
Milosevic.
We in Scotland must do all in our power to encourage resolute action
by the United States, with or without British approval, because the
indications are that a massive fighter and Cruise/Tomahawk missile
assault on this command centre in Belgrade and other military assets in
Serbia proper is only a political whisker away.
Nearer home we must bring massive pressure on our Scottish Foreign
Secretary to lift the obscene arms embargo against Bosnia in order that
the Bosnian Government may save its people from genocide.

A COUPLE of recent articles in The Herald may have raised public
anxiety about our beloved, productive, and eco-necessary bee.
Bees are feral (wild). Like cats a home (the hive) can be provided,
yet they may in early summer choose to leave in search for better. Bees
may swarm to occupy sites where they are unwelcome and a strategy for
removing them is necessary.
The Scottish Beekeepers' Association has members, mostly amateurs, all
over Scotland. For many swarm catching is the ultimate challenge and
excitement. Early swarms yield lots of honey in a good year.
Newly swarmed bees are remarkably docile, each gorging on honey to
last three days until a new home is found.
They will exit around midday and cluster round the queen bee in a
large ball in a bush or tree until bee ''scouts'' have located a new
site. Then off they will go.
An excellent example of co-operative swarm catching occurred at a
hotel in Peebles recently. The beekeeper was contacted by the local
environmental health officer who acquired a bee jacket and gloves with
veil from council stores.
The police also often keep a record of local beekeepers to call on in
an emergency except, it would seem, in Stornoway.

THE railway system will shut down today. The drivers' union, Aslef,
has that power, unlike the signalmen last year. It is a blunt instrument
all the same, whose use on this occasion is almost certainly
counter-productive. It will certainly engage little public sympathy and
not just because rail users will face considerable inconvenience: the
aim of the strike, to improve on a 3% wage increase, will hit no chord
with millions who will not themselves do any better this year, never
mind the millions who will probably do far worse. In an era of low
inflation, 3% gives nothing away to drivers (though it might not in fact
be quite the whole story since there is scope for regional improvement)
but it holds the line, and accepting it will leave few drivers worse
off. It contrasts with much better awards achieved by BR executives,
part of the disturbing pattern whereby top earners, particularly in
public utilities, have greatly widened the already existing gap between
themselves and the majority of their fellow employees. That phenomenon
is widely, and deservedly, resented but it does not itself ensure that
the drivers will evoke anything other than public hostility.
It will be counter-productive in another sense. The railways are
already under assault. Ill-advised policies of low public investment
these past two decades have starved them of much-needed capital
investment to improve their services at the very point when enormous
sums of money, public and private, have been poured into the road
network and the fast-growing number of private cars which use it. A
better-ordered system of mobility would reverse such priorities and
encourage travellers of all kinds back to the trains. The argument for
such a development is constantly undermined by the prospect of rail
disruption, especially in summer when the long hot days tend to produce
short tempers. It needs no crystal ball to be able to tell train drivers
(and indeed all who win their livelihood on the railways) that today's
strike will leave fewer passengers tomorrow.
That is one of two obvious lessons from this kind of strike; the other
is that low wage awards are not to be despised when they are real money,
as opposed to large awards which are nominal. The distinction between
real and nominal money needs to be drummed into all our thinking as it
has in Germany where the masses are aware of the nasty bite of inflation
just as much as any sophisticated financial analyst is. The German
attitudes are rooted in historical experiences we fortunately did not
share, but there is little doubting the benefits they confer on almost
every aspect of German economic life. By contrast we are suffering from
the immediate experience of the corporate greed noted above. The
Greenbury committee will pronounce on this development next week, and it
might be better not to anticipate its findings now. One general point
has to be made in the present context nevertheless: the very high levels
of increase achieved by already highly-paid earners in British companies
can no doubt be partly explained in terms of economic reality and
international competition for scarce talent, but the psychological
damage done throughout the rest of the country's pay structure is far
harder to quantify. The rail drivers are behaving foolishly, and their
own best interest should have them reconsider the rest of their summer
programme. Yet it is some measure of the damage huge remuneration
packages (which usually include option rights with their inbuilt capital
gains) elsewhere in business life are doing to the morale of the
generality of workers, that a skilled workforce can promote its own
destruction.

GRAHAM Fox set a new course record 67 yesterday as Scotland led the
qualifiers into the matchplay stages of the European Boys' Team
Championships at Woodhall Spa.
The West Kilbride teenager showed little respect for the fearsome
reputation of the course and his six-under-par score was the only sub-70
in the two days of qualifying.
Fox was out in 33, three under par, with birdies at the first, sixth,
and seventh holes. There were three more on the back nine, two of them
courtesy of long putts on the last two greens.
''Graham is very strong mentally and I'm not surprised that he has put
together a round like this,'' said Scottish captain Scott MacDonald.
Steven Young added a 74 to his opening 72 for a level-par total of 146
and that also was some achievement.
The other scores to count yesterday were the 73 of Grant Campbell,
Chris Kelly's 75, and Paul Cunningham's 76.
Overall, Scotland's two-round total of 743 was 15 strokes better than
defending champions England. In today's opening matchplay round, the
Scots, as top seeds, will face the eighth qualifiers, Germany, with a
semi-final place at stake. Qualifying scores:
743 -- Scotland (G Fox, 67; G Campbell, 73; S Young, 74; C Kelly, 75;
P Cunningham, 76. Did not count: O Lindsay, 81).
758 -- England. 761 -- Denmark. 763 -- Sweden. 770 -- France. 771 --
Spain. 777 -- Italy. 778 -- Germany. 784 -- Wales. 788 -- Norway. 793 --
Ireland. 796 -- Iceland. 798 -- Belgium. 799 -- Austria, Finland. 804 --
Netherlands. 816 -- Portugal. 819 -- Switzerland.
* JANICE Moodie, from Windyhill, fired a course record 67, five under
par, in Milan yesterday to help Scotland sweep into the matchplay stages
of the European Women's Team Championship.
Scotland ended the day with a total of 369, 17 strokes better than
that of Wednesday for an aggregate of 755 and seventh qualifying spot.
They now play Sweden today for a place in the semi-finals. First flight
qualifiers:
735 -- Spain. 736 -- Sweden. 739 -- Italy. 746 -- England. 747 --
France. 754 -- Denmark. 755 -- Scotland. 762 -- Wales.

STEVE Dean won the man of the match award as the Minor Counties
celebrated a famous victory over the West Indies at Reading.
The 34-year-old followed his unbeaten 146 against Young Australia 10
days ago with an innings of 91, including ten 4s from 134 balls.
The West Indies had reached 266 for nine, with opener Stuart Williams
top-scoring with 61.
Former Derbyshire bowler Paul Newman did the early damage, claiming
Sherwin Campbell and Richie Richardson.
Newman was replaced in the attack by Marcus Sharp, who took an
illustrious trio of wickets. Jimmy Adams, Brian Lara and Carl Hooper all
fell to catches off his bowling.
Counties took command when Dean and Mark Fell (50) came together in a
third wicket partnership of 107 off 21 overs.
West Indies 266 for nine (S C Williams 61, C L Hooper 54); Minor
Counties 270 for six (S J Dean 91, M A Fell 50).

Ross Finlay enjoys putting the fun back into 4x4s.
UNTIL last year, Toyota 4x4s were regarded mostly as workhorses. As
pick-ups or estate cars, you see them all over the place on farms and
building sites, forest roads and remote civil engineering projects. And
it is rare television footage of some Third World natural disaster or
refugee camp incident which does not show relief agency personnel
arriving in a Toyota Landcruiser. But with the RAV4, Toyota tapped a
different 4x4 market -- for recreational vehicles, fun cars or whatever
''lifestyle'' description you like to give them.
Toyota GB has been reminding us that it is celebrating its 30th
anniversary, and that the car company's founder raised the cash to move
his family's loom-making business into vehicle manufacture by selling
patents on some of its textile machinery to a firm in Oldham. Toyota's
British connection is more substantial now, including full-scale
manufacture of the Carina, and plans to begin Corolla production here in
1998.
Family cars from Toyota are regarded by some people as well-built,
reliable, but pretty dull. When the three-door RAV4 was introduced last
year, it was a shock to their system. This is a car which is not only
not dull, but was admitted by the head of the design team to have been
inspired by his observation, on a tour of Toyota duty in Europe, that
younger folk in sunny Mediterranean countries like to cruise round beach
resorts, and Toyota had no stylish, small-scale vehicle to offer them
for the purpose.
That has led some sober-sided types to dismiss the RAV4 as little more
than a toy -- a serious mistake. The original version proved to be a
lively performer, thanks to the fitting of a punchy two-litre engine in
a lightweight vehicle, with fine road manners and, as we found on a
drive over a seriously deteriorated quarry track in France, an
independent rear suspension system which works really well on rough and
rocky going.
However, the three-door, now well established at prices from #12,899
to #15,440, is a close-coupled design. Hence the introduction of the
longer-wheelbase five-door RAV4, which is intended to be more of a
family estate. It costs #15,945 in manual gearbox form, #17,152 as an
automatic.
Using the same 1998cc engine, it offers a peak power output of 129bhp
and exactly the same pounds-foot maximum figure for torque. Common sense
suggests that with an extra 70kg to carry it ought to be at a slight
performance and economy disadvantage compared with the three-door. But
Toyota claims the same 0-60mph time of 11.6 seconds and test track
maximum of 105mph, and identical fuel consumption returns of 39mpg at
56mph, 29 at 75 and 27mpg on the urban cycle.
On the open road, the five-door retains the original RAV4's attraction
of driving more like a saloon car than most 4x4s. I thought the test
example sounded a little boomier than I remember from the first
three-door I tried, and I was conscious of a certain amount of
transmission whine. But the latest RAV4 beats most of its direct rivals
in handling, ride quality and throttle response.
While we tried some more serious Toyota 4x4s, during the same test
session, on steeper and more slippery woodland tracks, the RAV4s this
time went off-road for no more than a gentle grassland potter around a
reservoir. That was just a dawdle, although the five-door should be much
the same on rougher going as the shorter three-door.
For family use, the 16-inch longer five-door seems to offer only a
little extra rear legroom, although there is much more space for
stacking luggage. The higher price pitches it into a more competitive
class, but it is certainly a thoughtfully equipped 4x4, even if the
longer-wheelbase model lacks the cheeky appeal of the three-door, which
seems to be surprising Toyota by selling to older couples as well as to
jazzy ''lifestyle'' youths.

CANADIAN Richard Zokol made the most of a rare US PGA Tour appearance
this season when he birdied five of his final seven holes to share the
lead after the opening round at the $1.1m Anheuser-Busch Classic
yesterday in Williamsburg, Virginia.
The Vancouver resident shot a flawless six-under-par 65 to join
Americans Robin Freeman and Dudley Hart in the lead on a typically
steamy day at the Kingsmill course.
Zokol, who lost his card after finishing 169th on last year's US Tour
money list, has been forced to beg for sponsors' invitations this year.
''I thought invitations would be easier to come by,'' said Zokol,
making just his fifth appearance of the year on the US Tour.
''I didn't miss a fairway today. For the little amount I've been
playing this year, my ball-striking has been really good.''
Zokol won the 1992 Greater Milwaukee Open but, instead of taking his
game to a higher level, he started to struggle shortly thereafter.
''I had a hiccup year last year,'' he admitted. ''I had a hard time
being away from my family, travelling by myself. I didn't enjoy it.''
With his wife and three children in Virginia this week, Zokol is
having a good time and he'll enjoy himself even more if he strings three
more low rounds together.
Defending champion Mark McCumber, one of the better-known players in
the 156-man field, stumbled to a three-over-par round of 74.
McCumber, thirteenth on the Sony world rankings, is the highest-ranked
player at the tournament. Leading scores (USA unless stated):
65 -- R Zokol (Canada), R Freeman, D Hart.
66 -- K Triplett, S McCarron, D Waldorf, J Carter.
67 -- S Hoch, C van der Velde (Netherlands), M Bradley.
68 -- K Green, L Clements, J Wilson, F Funk, M Donald, P Blackmar, M
Dawson, J Pate, J Kaye, S Cink.
Other scores included:
69 -- S Simpson, J Gallagher. 70 -- P Stewart. 71 -- H Sutton. 72 -- C

DAMON Hill last night played down the verbal ''feud'' between him and
Michael Schumacher in the build-up to Sunday's British Grand Prix.
The Londoner, described as ''moody'' after he reportedly criticised
the world champion as a marketing clone, admitted he had ''no great
feelings about Schumacher.''
Hill also warned that any drivers taking personal vendettas out on to
the track were creating unnecessary dangers in an already hazardous
sport.
Hill, trailing Schumacher by 11 points in the world championship as
they approach the season's eighth race at Silverstone, was accused of
''brake-testing'' the German after the French Grand Prix a fortnight
ago.
But the Williams-Renault driver said: ''I have not spoken to Michael
since getting out of the car in France.''
Hill explained that his alleged criticism of Schumacher as a clone in
this week's Radio Times was meant as a general comment about sports
stars and their schooling by sponsors.
''I said those things about eight months ago and they've been
rehashed. They were off the cuff and meant as general comments. I know
he's not manufactured -- he's a damn fine driver.
''I do not want to see the sport reduced to slinging insults at each
other off the track.''
While Hill and Schumacher are slugging it out for the world's No.1
slot, Scotsman David Coulthard is aiming to achieve his maiden Formula
One victory.
Hill's Williams colleague said: ''I'd like to think I'll be up there
with those two before too long. It's my first full year in Formula One
and while I'm happy to learn, I'll be looking to fight for the
championship next year. I think I can win on Sunday.''

CONSUMER demand for quality potatoes, particularly in supermarkets,
has helped boost prospects for a new Scottish specialist seed producers'
group.
Using modern technology in virus tested stem cutting (VTSC) three
north-east farmers are combining with a Perth-based seed supply
specialist to set up TLC Potatoes, which will provide, through a
minituber production system, the material needed by commercial seed
raisers.
The multiplication process makes more starter seed tubers available to
VTSC producers in a shorter time span and TLC says its plantlets are
grown less densely giving a larger, earlier maturing potato.
Set up 18 months ago TLC's multiplication base is at Banchory. Potato
Marketing Board vice-chairman Jim Cruikshank, of Rothienorman, a TLC
director, claimed: ''I think that our minituber system provides the best
quality and value for quality-conscious growers.''
Stephen Hole, of the recently-formed Perth-based Pseedco, will play a
vital role. He is responsible for the 20,000 tonnes of seed that is
needed by the growers in arable areas of England who meet the demands of
major supermarket chains and processors, including potato crisp
manufacturers.
''This sort of vertical integration from VTSC seed through to the
shoppers in major stores is essential if markets at home and abroad are
to be maintained and expanded,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Tenant dispute close to settlement    British Coal backs down on sales</HEADLINE>

ONE of the most acrimonious land disputes in recent years looks close
to settlement with British Coal appearing to be backing down from its
previous rigid stance of only being prepared to sell its large
agricultural holding in Scotland to one single buyer.
It has now emerged that a number of tenants have, after a long battle
and a series of parliamentary questions, reached agreement with the
selling agents, Bell-Ingram of Perth, to purchase their farms.
British Coal owns around 33,000 acres of land in Scotland which,
following the privatisation of the industry, the Department of Trade and
Industry was keen to cash in as quickly as possible.
Originally the tenants, many of whom farm in Fife, Clackmannanshire
and Ayrshire, were informed that they were not to be given any chance at
all to buy their farms, even although some of the tenants had occupied
their holdings for more than 50 years.
The National Farmers' Union took up the issue, while Martin O'Neill,
the Labour MP for Clackmannanshire, repeatedly posed questions in the
House of Commons claiming that many of his constituents were being
discriminated against.
This pressure resulted in British Coal having a change of mind and
saying that they were prepared to listen to serious offers from the
tenants. However, the valuation placed on the farms was widely regarded
as being too high with a discount of only 35% from the open market value
against the more normal 50% for tenanted land.
It is understood that British Coal has now accepted the more normal
formula as a basis for valuation as well as the usual rates of
compensation for improvements undertaken by the tenants.
Around 31 farmers have so far reached agreement with the agents and
that at least another 10 are close to following suit from a total of
around 60 right across Scotland, some of whom for a variety of reasons
have declared that they have no interest in purchasing their farms.
A spokesman for the tenants, who formed an association and who also
collaborated with colleagues in a similar situation in the north of
England, said: ''The attitude of British Coal has softened
considerably.''
A further meeting of the tenants is being held in Fife on Monday
evening.

<TEXT>
The immediate future of the control of Scotland's water industry has
been settled by the Secretary of State. It is an imposed settlement
which will be widely opposed by the other political parties as well as
the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) which these parties
dominate as a consequence of their considerable majorities in the
country's local government. Mr Forsyth's dispensation may be seen to
include a concession to the critics, for half of the membership of the
new boards is to be composed of elected councillors and there is to be
an Ombudsman for water in the shape of Mr Dick Douglas, the former
Labour MP, now a prominent Scottish Nationalist. Mr Douglas's
appointment has been accepted by his party as it is seen as being quite
distinct from the matter of political control. All else is rejected by
Cosla as being quite insufficient in terms of their desired outcome
which would have had a majority of councillors, nominated by itself, on
the boards. The three parties, Labour, SNP, and Liberal Democrats, are
at one in boycotting this new arrangement. Cosla's statement that the
outcome is ''a slap in the face of the Scottish people'' may fairly be
held to sum up the parties' judgment as well. The arrangement will run
for at least the next two years with its future dependent on the outcome
of the next General Election.
In effect the parties have disqualified themselves and removed their
influence from the industry over two years in which vital decisions
about long-term investment are likely to be taken. Accepting inclusion
in the Government's scheme would, in their minds, have tarnished
themselves and bought involvement, and so responsibility, with little
power. Even with half the membership of the boards being comprised of
elected non-Tory councillors, the balance would have been held by the
Tories and private interests sympathetic to their aims for water's
future. Mr Forsyth's earlier indications of a willingness to collaborate
with his opponents in the common national interest has got nowhere this
time. Perhaps he was too late to alter arrangements already made by his
predecessor. Perhaps he was just too late to be able to overcome the
earlier animosities this issue has engendered; but it is hard to avoid
the conclusion that he was not giving enough away to begin to do so. He
ought to have taken longer to implement the new arrangements and used
the time to try to persuade the other parties to nominate half the new
members rather than have himself appoint them. The imbalance between the
Government's support in Scotland and that of its opponents, especially
on the future of water may have been too great for him. He would have
had to concede control of the new boards which would have been an
admission of complete defeat. No matter his earlier rhetoric, he has
refused to move in that direction, and it will seem to many that his
placatory beginnings have merely served to conceal the iron fist.
The outcome is that Government placemen will dominate the new water
boards completely, though some in practice may well prove to be
independent in mind and spirit. Much of their remit will be
non-political in that the provision of water services is not mainly a
subject for partisanship. Yet all sorts of questions, notably the
financing of long-term capital projects, have political implications and
are bound to have impact upon local government finance and, if less
directly, on electoral opinion. By taking decisions within the next two
years, which may effectively turn out to be irreversible, the new boards
may go a long way to achieving Government hopes of at least a
quasi-privatised water industry in Scotland, not the outcome opinion
polls and election results indicate is wanted by Scottish voters.

NOT since the Lord Provost of Edinburgh was admitted to the Order of
the British Empire has there been so much cause for celebration in
Nationalist ranks. Recognition by the Establishment. What true patriot
can ask for more?
That sawn-off colossus of a man, Dick Douglas, has accepted
appointment by Michael Forsyth as Scotland's water lapdog. Non-payment
was yesterday's doctrine. ''Working within the system,'' for which
others were so reviled by the same Mr Douglas, is the new flavour of the
month.
How can someone who does not believe that the British state should
exist, or that the Tories have any mandate in Scotland, accept such an
appointment from the same source? And what does it tell us about the
cynicism of the Minister making the appointment that he is prepared to
play this kind of footsie?
One can allow Mr Forsyth the entertainment which he will derive from
this enterprising piece of mischief. But for evidence of what he is
about politically, it is the make-up of the three water quangos
themselves which is more important than the Dick Douglas side-show.
The hype about a new brand of caring, listening Forsyth politics is
only a week old. One of his good intentions is supposedly to take power
back from unelected quangos and give it to local authorities.
So here was the first test. If he wanted to signal a change of course,
he could have made clear his intention to have at least a majority of
elected representatives from the new authorities on the water quangos.
That would have countered the well-founded view that they are intended
as Trojan horses for privatisation.
It would not have been as good as formally restoring water to local
authority control, but it would have been a very powerful signal of
intent which councillors would have been entitled, collectively, to
respond to. But no such initiative has been forthcoming.
Forsyth merely implemented the Lang line that there would be a
minority of elected people on these boards. But whether under Lang or
Forsyth, the majority was to be drawn from the usual rogues' gallery of
appointees. The Tory chairmen already in place have now been surrounded
by safe majorities of like mind.
Thus the party which doesn't run a single council in Scotland now has
its hand-picked people in control of the most basic service of all. But
don't worry! The bold Dick will keep an eye on them.
The fraudulence of Forsyth's propaganda offensive is not taking long
to manifest itself. So far, apart from yesterday's announcement, it has
consisted of promising to oppose things which nobody but he and his
fellow-Tories would have dreamt of imposing in the first place.
Forsyth has a constituency interest in the West Highland Line. But
where has he been for the past seven months while a broad coalition has
been fighting to save the sleeper (successfully so far) and Motorail,
which has already disappeared?
If Forsyth's silence on the issue had been crucial, then the Fort
William sleeper would already be dead and buried. We owe it to the Court
of Session that it is still going strong. So who is Forsyth now going to
argue with, in order to ensure that it will be retained on a long-term
basis? Himself?
The decision to take the money away from Motorail and to cut four
overnight Anglo-Scottish trains was taken by the franchise director, who
is under the direction of the Secretary of State for Transport.
Forsyth should not trouble us with daring tales of ''fighting'' to
save the sleeper. If he fails to do so, he will merely demonstrate his
own weakness. I suspect that Ian Lang fought quite hard to protect the
sleeper and lost, because this kind of decision is crucial to the
progress of rail privatisation.
Is Forsyth prepared to challenge the logic of rail privatisation? I
doubt it very much. Indeed he is the high priest of that demented
doctrine.
At this early stage, he should understand that endless briefings about
the battles which he is waging against his own Government behind closed
doors will impress nobody. He is part and parcel of the policies and
philosophy which are so detested, and it is a bit late in the day to
decide that he is opposed to their consequences.
His declared intention to prevent the closure of Torry Research
Station is even more shallow. Only the Forsyth-type clones who know the
value of nothing, if it is in the public sector, would have dreamt of
closing Torry with its international reputation in the first place.
If it is saved, as it certainly should be, it will be because of the
campaign which has been mounted in the North-east and the fact that a
couple of remaining Tory seats are vulnerable to public indignation
against such nonsense. But again, all Forsyth is purporting to do is
defend Scotland against the Tories!

LACK of an extra dividend and a rather lacklustre current trading
statement caused some disappointment for shares of Great Universal
Stores, which shed 8p to 613p.
As usual, GUS succeeded in pushing profits ahead, by 8% to #563m for
the year to March and it said that profits in the first two months were
''somewhat ahead'' of the comparable period in 1994.
It added that demand in respect of the main home shopping division had
continued to be affected by ''a cautious and selective customer
approach''. The overall trend will not become clear until the
autumn/winter season gets under way.
Last December GUS handed #300m back to shareholders via a special
dividend and there had been hopes that it might repeat this given that
it has over #1000m in the kitty. This did not happen but the normal
dividend is raised 15% to 15p.
However, another special payout has not been ruled out. Deputy
chairman Richard Pugh said: ''Obviously it remains an option but whether
we shall do it or not I think we have to await and see how the board
feels.''
Best performers in 1994-95 were Burberrys and Scotch House, which
raised operating profits by 27% to #52m. Exports of the famous Burberrys
raincoat and other products rose by 36% and royalty income was ahead.
New products were also introduced. Knitwear retailer Scotch House
benefited from new store openings. Japan is Burberrys' biggest market
and there are now 800 franchised outlets.
The largest activity is the home shopping division, with the main
catalogue having 4,250,000 agents. Smaller ones are distributed direct
to 2,250,000 people in the UK and Europe.
New more targeted catalogues will be marketed through GUS's vast
database and new interactive shopping methods are under investigation.
Some cost pressures emerged towards the end of the year, reflecting
commodity, paper and packaging prices, but margins still edged ahead to
10.3%.
The four Continental businesses made progress in a difficult market
with savings coming through integrating them with the UK operation. The
in-house White Arrow delivery service has increased its workforce by
800.
Overseas retailing saw a strong showing in South Africa, where there
are 385 outlets, but dull conditions pertained in Canada.
GUS's database derives from its CCN Business Information business
which is a major credit reference agency, now deriving 20% of its
turnover overseas. It has set up offshoots in the US, many European
countries and Scandinavia.
Consumer credit traded strongly, helped by a good recovery in
corporate business. Overall the division plus CCN raised its
contribution by 38% to #92.5m.
Finally property saw a 10% increase in net rental income to #61m owing
to rent reviews and acquisitions, notably the Forge Shopping Centre in
Glasgow. The portfolio, which contains 1100 investment properties, was
valued at #853m, a marginal reduction on the previous one.
Currently, CCN, Burberrys and South African retail continue to power
ahead but consumer credit has turned down, particularly for car
purchase.
Despite moves like the payment to shareholders and modernisation of
the share structure, which were radical for the conservatively-run GUS,
no important initiatives are planned.
The increase in paper prices will impact on the 1996 spring-summer
catalogues, but GUS expects to limit this through overhead savings.
Shares of GUS's quality do not come cheap and they are a hold, selling
at 16 times earnings and yielding 3%.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN and British scientists have found what they say are the
world's oldest footprints in ancient rock in west Australia, upsetting
classic evolutionary theory that plants were earth's first colonisers.
The footprints, made by giant 3ft scorpions and centipedes, were dated
to at least 420 million years ago, well before the first higher plants
took root, said Australian palaeontologist Ken McNamara.
''It's changing the sequence of events,'' said McNamara, of the
Western Australia Museum in Perth, who has been studying the fossils
with British palaeontologist Nigel Trewin, of the University of
Aberdeen.
''The classic view of evolution of life on land is not really held up
in the fossil evidence,'' added McNamara.
The fossil record of these huge, scuttling arthropods is the earliest
evidence of an animal walking on land, he said, adding they were found
in a gully in a national park about 370 miles north of Perth.
''We are looking at rocks of about 420 to 430 million years ago, but
they could be older than that,'' McNamara said. ''They were big
scorpion-type animals and big centipede-type animals.''
The larger arthropods were most likely carnivorous, feeding on smaller
animals that in turn survived on bacteria, lower plants like mosses, and
on ''scum'' at the water's edge.
''These animals were known to be around but were thought to be
entirely aquatic,'' said McNamara.
The inland area where the footprints were found was once part of a
river system with sand flats, McNamara said.
''The animals walk out of the water and dust settles on the tracks,''
he said, adding that the prints had been perfectly preserved.--Reuter.

I can win a gold medal -- there's no point being modest about it. If I'm
in contention with 300m to go, I'll be hard to beat.''
* ATHLETICS chiefs have sanctioned an unprecedented third analysis of
an anti-doping sample for Britain's banned Commonwealth 800m champion,
Diane Modahl, who is serving a four-year suspension after having tested
positive for the male hormone, testosterone, last year. Her appeal comes
before the British Athletics federation a week on Monday.

WIMBLEDON hero Greg Rusedski will spearhead Britain's bid to gain
their first Davis Cup victory in seven attempts at Eastbourne today.
Canadian import Rusedski had them swooning in the aisles at the All
England club with his winning smile and monster serve, which took him
into the fourth round amid a flurry of Union flags.
Now he aims to fly the flag again on his Davis Cup debut against
Monaco and it should be considerably easier than any of the opposition
he faced at Wimbledon -- even though his new team have not won since the
3-1 success against Austria in Manchester four years ago.
Rusedski opens the match at the refurbished Devonshire Park stadium
against Monaco's reigning champion, but current No.2 player, Christophe
Boggetti, who is not even good enough to be ranked in the world's top
1000.
And by the time he meets 18-year-old Sebastien Graeff, the world
No.924, on Sunday the contest should be dead.
In fact, it will be a major embarrassment even for down-at-heel
British tennis -- and especially for new Davis Cup captain David Lloyd
-- if Monaco win a single set against the home side, which is completed
by Oxford's Tim Henman and doubles partners Mark Petchey and Neil Broad.
The fast improving Henman, Britain's current No 5, displaces, Petchey,
the No 3, as the second singles player this weekend, following eight
Davis Cup defeats in a row for the 24-year-old from Loughton, Essex.
* ANDREW Foster rekindled memories of his Wimbledon success of two
years ago by reaching the quarter-finals of the Mercury Communications
Challenge at Bristol.
Foster is still trying to live up to his efforts at the All England
Club in 1993 when he reached the fourth round before losing to Pete
Sampras. There were echoes of that run as he served and volleyed
strongly to beat French left-hander Stephane Simian 6-4, 6-4.
Foster now faces a quarter-final tie against qualifier Dennis van
Scheppinger. Top seed Jeremy Bates joined Foster in the quarter-finals,
overcoming Australian Todd Larkham 7-5, 6-2 after a shaky start.
The two other Britons in the second round bowed out. Colin Beecher
went down 6-3, 7-6 to Phillipe Pech of France, while Danny Sapsford had
a three-set battle with South African Chris Haggard, losing 6-3, 3-6,
6-3.

THE wife and girlfriend of two Britons kidnapped by Muslim separatists
in India's troubled Kashmir Valley made a tearful appeal for their
release today.
''This is very hard for me,'' said Catherine Mosley, girlfriend of
tourist Paul Wells, 23, from London, who was abducted on July 4 along
with fellow Briton Keith Mangan, 33, from Middlesbrough.
''We have no quarrel with the people of Kashmir or Islam. So, I appeal
to the people holding our loved ones to let them go,'' she added.
Mr Mangan's wife Julie said: ''I am relieved to hear that Keith and
the other hostages are being treated well. We want them to know we are
fine and thinking about them.
''In the name of God, please let our loved ones go. We miss them very
much,'' she added.
Mr Mangan, Mr Wells, American Donald Hutchings, German Dirk Hasert,
and Norwegian Hans Christian Ostro were kidnapped while on trekking
holidays.
The previously unknown Al Faran group, which carried out the
abductions, sent a photograph of the hostages to a foreign news agency
office yesterday with a message that they would kill the men if Indian
troops tried to intervene.
It said the victims were safe, but added that the Indian Government
would be responsible for anything beyond Saturday, a deadline set for
the release of 20 separatist guerrillas arrested by Indian authorities.
Jane Schelley urged the kidnappers to release her friend Donald
Hutchings.
''We sympathise with the sufferings of the Kashmiri people, but the
hostages are only innocent tourists and not responsible for the
situation,'' she said.
''We have made many friends among the Kashmiris and have been treated
with great kindness,'' said Anne Katrin Hennig, Dirk Hasert's companion.
''I am very sad about this happening.''
The two Britons and two Americans were abducted from the resort of
Ladervat in the Pahalgam area when they stopped for the night. Miss
Mosley, Mrs Mangan, Jane Schelly, and a Canadian man were released.
One American, John Childs, later escaped. The abductors said they
released him on humanitarian grounds.
Mr Ostro and Mr Hasert were seized in the mountains around Pahalgam on
Saturday.
Western diplomats trying to secure the release of the hostages
expressed concern today about the lack of communication with the
captors.
''There is a total void and we are in a very tight situation as never
before,'' said one. ''This is not normal and this is worrying us a
lot.''

David Belcher finds a watering-hole for parched Beatles' fans in the
phenomenon that is Oasis
IT'S APT that Mancunian rock-classicists Oasis should shortly be
marking their coming of age as global contenders with two summer
sell-out gigs under canvas in Scotland, on two consecutive nights on the
beach at Irvine. Why? Because there's a profoundly Scottish genesis to
the phenomenal Oasis success story, one which has seen the band bullet
from nowhere to huge worldwide acclaim and a multi-million-selling debut
album inside the space of 12 short months.
One particular date in one particular Scottish locale will forever be
etched on the heart of Alan McGee, the Glaswegian who founded Oasis's
record label, Creation, and still oversees the operation. ''May 29,
1993, King Tut's,'' he says when you ask him about the first time he set
eyes on his boys.
''I'd come back up to Glasgow from London to check on a couple of
local Creation bands, Eighteen Wheeler and Boyfriend. There was a third
band on the bill, Sisterlovers, from Manchester, and they'd brought
their mates with them for the ride . . . Oasis.
''My little sister, Susan, mistakenly got me to King Tut's two hours
too early, and as soon as we walked in we became aware of this ominous
atmosphere. There were people scurrying about saying: 'Something's going
to go off because there's this scally band from Manchester who've just
turned up without warning and they're saying that if they don't get to
play on the bill tonight, they're going to smash the place up'. They
were Oasis.
''I caught sight of them sitting round a table with more of their
mates, a load of all these stroppy Mancs. I was really impressed with
Liam. He looked charismatic, just like a young Paul Weller, and he was
wearing a sort of Adidas look that was really cool and that I hadn't
really noticed before.
''I'm pretty sure that they couldn't have known that I was going to be
there that night, the boss of a label. It was more that they just wanted
gigs -- any sort of gig, anywhere -- and they hadn't been able to get
any. What probably made them so desperate was the fact that they'd laid
out #100 for their van hire.''
That first King Tut's gig has become part of the myth and legend of
rock's rich tapestry, with one version of the story insisting that Oasis
threatened to torch the place if they weren't allowed to play. Another
version has it that band members forcibly pointed out that there were 15
in their entourage and only three King Tut's staff-members to resist
them.
Interestingly, King Tut's manager Geoff Ellis puts a rather different
interpretation on the evening's events.
''They did turn up unannounced, but as far I'm aware they simply
approached my stand-in that night and very politely asked if we minded
whether they went on for 20 minutes. They said they didn't want any
money and they were quite happy to share the other bands' gear.
''They were quite un-rock'n'roll about it all. Very nice and
well-mannered, in fact.''
Whatever the true story about the means by which Oasis secured its
impromptu gig, the outcome on the night is in no doubt: Alan McGee
offered to sign the boys on the spot. ''I thought their first song was
good; their second song was great, and their third song, a cover of the
Beatles' I Am The Walrus, was just incredible.
''I knew I had to sign them. I waited till they'd finished and then
went over and told them I wanted them to be on Creation, and they gave
me a tape. I was surprised to find out that it was only their 20th gig
in the two years they'd been going.
''I couldn't understand why no-one else had signed them up, either. So
I started doing a bit of asking around, and found out that every other
label had been put off when Oasis had played in Manchester at the In The
City seminar in September, 1992. Liam and Noel (the Gallagher brothers)
had had a fight on-stage and the whole of the British music industry had
decided there and then en masse to pass on them.''
''They are proper scallies, the whole band, and they do have these
shenanigans where they all blow up at one another, but it's not
something that's ever bothered me.''
Nor anyone else. In fact Oasis's reputation for hard-case
rumbustiousness has stood them in good stead, amplifying their
two-fisted status as cocky, devil-may-care rock'n'roll geezers.
A recent feature in America's innately-conservative Rolling Stone
magazine pointed up Oasis's bad-boy reputation. Rolling Stone listed the
cross-Channel ferry from which the band was ejected for drunken rowdyism
after its first, brief European tour. Additionally, there was the time
the boys wrecked a bar during the course of a New Musical Express
photo-shoot. And has any magazine ever managed to keep a tab on exactly
how many fist-fights there may or may not have been between Liam and
Noel?
Another recent feature, in Q magazine, quizzed Noel Gallagher about
the band's most memorable rock-riots. An evening at Newcastle's
Riverside club was ranked first (''I took me guitar off and belted this
guy with it''), closely followed by the Barrowland gig in December which
was marred by vocalist Liam losing his voice after three songs.
According to Noel, his consequent solo performance was not marked by
scattered outbreaks of brainless booing from less tolerant sections of
the Glasgow crowd -- it was; I was there and I heard it, Noel -- and the
evening ended with aggro ''going off outside the gig afterwards . . .
the riot police turned up. It was mad.'' I'm not sure that this is quite
accurate.
In fact, in the light of all this quotable stuff from Noel, it's worth
noting his view of the media, as expressed to Rolling Stone.
''Everything that's ever written in the press is 90% facts and 10%
exaggeration. It's easier for them to write that you had red socks on or
that you take drugs. It's interesting for the kids to read . . . as long
as you realise there's great songs.
''Our attitude and 'rock'n'rollness' doesn't sell records -- it might
initially, but it won't keep it going. It's like the Rolling Stones were
seen to be very rock'n'roll when they started -- they were always
getting arrested. But the reason why they were a great band is not
because Mick and Keith got nicked, it's because they wrote Jumpin' Jack
Flash. It's music that lasts.''
Will Oasis last? Will their music last? Obviously, the band won't. The
music certainly will. You see, rather than the Stones, it's the Beatles
who have always been Oasis's template, and they did rather well for
themselves, didn't they?
Where was it the Beatles did their first headline tour, incidentally?
Scotland. And where was it that Oasis first played under canvas? At last
year's T In The Park . . . in Scotland. Omens maybe that Irvine will be
the right kind of a rock'n'roll riot for the Mancs with a debt to one or
two Scots.

EDINBURGH Japan Trust, which yesterday reported a 24% plunge in net
asset value to 142p in the year to end-May, is not hedging its bets on
which way the finely-poised Japanese stock market will go.
Banking on a sustained rally, the investment trust, which has
increased shareholders' funds to #32m with a #21m 'C' share issue, has
taken gearing close to its 20% limit.
It borrowed a further 300 million yen at the beginning of June,
increasing gearing to about #5.9m.
Edinburgh Japan's bold decision would not have done it much good last
month, when the market continued to weaken.
However, since the start of this month, the first-section Topix index
has risen by about 10.5%, with the Nikkei 225 up about 14%, and there
are some signs that things may be moving in the right direction.
Last week's cut in the Japanese overnight call rate was followed by
reductions in banks' short and long-term lending and borrowing rates and
there is talk that the 1% official discount rate could be slashed by
anything up to threequarters-of-a-point.
There is also speculation that the Japanese Government may act to
counter the slump in land prices and to tackle banks' bad-debt problems.
David Currie, head of Edinburgh Fund Managers' Japanese department,
wants to see these issues addressed, and hopes the Bank of Japan will
''reflate'' the economy by ''properly'' expanding the money supply.
He said: ''Provided steps are taken towards resolving these issues, I
think the stock market has a very good rally up its sleeve.''
Mr Currie is aware that Edinburgh Japan could be in for another tough
time if the Bank of Japan and the country's government fail to act.
However, the trust believes the Japanese authorities are starting to
address these problems, which have hammered investors' confidence, and
it is taking a positive stance.
During the 12 months to end-May, the highly-geared Edinburgh Japan
dramatically underperformed its benchmark Topix index, which lost only
12% in sterling terms.
With administrative expenses of #137,000 wiping out income of
#123,000, no dividend will be paid.
However, the bottom-line deficit of #27,000 was a marginal improvement
on the previous year's figure of #28,000.

PRESIDENT Clinton admitted the obvious today: either the UN mission in
Bosnia is resurrected immediately, or it must be ended. ''Unless we can
restore the integrity of the UN mission, obviously its days will be
numbered,'' he said.
He added that the question of lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia
should be discussed with the Allies, so that they can present a united
Nato front. He conspicuously did not mention the UN, although the
embargo is based on a Security Council resolution.
The Republican leader in the Senate, Bob Dole, denounced the Rapid
Reaction Force as a sham designed purely to save face, not to save
Bosnians. Mr Rifkind was here recently telling the Americans that the
force would give UN forces greater flexibility.
The Americans were not impressed then, and now are less impressed
still. Senator Dole has long advocated ending the UN mission altogether
and lifting the embargo, and it looks increasingly likely that his
policy will be accepted.
The President denounced the Serbs for over-running Srebrenica and said
that they should pull out of the area. He offered them no inducement to
do so.
He was speaking at an impromptu press conference and was not asked
about the obvious next step in the long Calvary of the Bosnian Muslims.
If the Bosnian Serb Army leader General Radko Mladic is allowed to keep
Srebrenica, then he will occupy Zepa, and then Goradze. In fact, their
loss appears inevitable and imminent.
Then what would happen if the Serbs attacked Sarajevo? The Americans
are pledged to send up to 24,000 troops into Bosnia to help in the
withdrawal of Unprofor. If it is a precipitous retreat, the men would be
brought out by helicopter, leaving their vehicles and other equipment
behind. If they want to retreat in order, the operation might take up to
three months and involve a commitment of up to 60,000 Nato troops.
The decision has to be taken immediately, if Unprofor is to be
withdrawn in any sort of good order before the winter.

yesterday.
Chairman Sir Ian Hay Davison said Mothercare was planning 10 new BhS
stores and seven new Mothercare stores this year.
Trading space could rise by as much as 9% this year, he told

PAT Eddery yesterday vowed to carry on riding in the same
single-minded style that has brought him 10 jockeys' championships and
3644 winners in Britain despite facing the prospect of more than 19 days
on the sidelines.
A further ban awaits him on his next visit to Portman Square when
stewards consider his fifth riding offence of the season, committed at
Newmarket on Wednesday.
With just one more day in the saddle before he starts his suspensions,
Eddery was back among the winners at Newmarket with a treble on Allied
Forces, Lake Coniston and Danehill Dancer.
'The stewards are clamping down, but I am not going to change the way
I ride,'' said Eddery. ''Why should I? I do my best every time.''
Meanwhile, Lake Coniston was hailed one of the best sprinters of the
last 25 years when Eddery drove him to a four-length victory in the July
Cup. He emphatically laid the ghost of his unlucky Royal Ascot defeat to
prove he is the true heir to the sprinting crown with a stunning burst
of speed.
Lake Coniston was undone by So Factual in the Cork and Orrery Stakes,
but nothing got near the 13-8 favourite this time.

ROYAL Bank of Scotland shares lost 14[1/2]p over the last two days as
the market caught wind of attempts by UBS Securities to place an
unusually large lot of shares on behalf of a US vendor.
Fears of lower profits from the bank's Direct Line insurance
subsidiary also helped to drive down the share price after Direct Line
announced discounts of up to 20% on motor insurance premiums.
A source at UBS Securities confirmed reports that UBS had run into
problems selling about 12 million Royal Bank shares, equivalent to 1.5%
of Royal Bank's entire capital, on behalf of a US client.
News of the private placing at a discount to stock exchange prices
leaked on to the market, driving down Royal Bank shares by 7p on
Wednesday and a further 7[1/2]p yesterday. The stock closed at
424[1/2]p.
The UBS source said the operation was much larger than most placings
of Royal Bank shares and UBS was still trying to offload stock yesterday
afternoon.
City analysts said the overhang of Royal Bank shares created by the
placing was the main factor dampening prices. ''There are rumoured to be
nine-million shares in the market and that's on top of the Direct Line
phantom price cut,'' said one London banking analyst who declined to be
named.
Direct Line announced on Wednesday discounts of up to 20% on motor
premiums, raising fears among some investors of a fall in revenue.
But the telephone sales firm, which has cornered nearly 12% of the UK
motor insurance market, said that on average premiums would fall by less
than 1.5% as a result of the cuts.
''I think the impact was slightly overdone because people focused on
the 20% figure'' said Richard Andrews at Edinburgh brokers Bell Lawrie
White.
''It's just another little piece in the jigsaw that suggests premiums
are on the way down,'' he added.
A spokeswoman at Direct Line denied suggestions that the discounts
were a reaction to the launch of a rival telephone insurance business by
car tyre and exhaust fitters Kwik-Fit in May, but she admitted that
competition in the insurance industry was fierce.
Mr Andrews also ruled out a link between Kwik-Fit and the Direct Line
discounts. ''I think Kwik-Fit is more a symptom of increased competition
than a cause,'' he said.
Kwik-Fit Insurance managing director Lawrence Law said his firm had
sold several thousand policies since it started business six weeks ago.
Direct Line, which contributed 20% of Royal Bank's profits last year,
has 2.1 million policy-holders.

THE volume of annual retail sales increased only slightly in June,
falling well short of the stronger rise that had been projected after
May's slowdown, according to the latest Distributive Trades Survey from
the Confederation of British Industry.
The rise was less than in the two previous months. It suggests that
the uneven pattern of consumer demand seen so far this year is
continuing.
Although the three-monthly trend suggests that underlying sales growth
on an annual basis remains on a broadly upward trend, it is affected by
the strong rise seen in April as a result of the late Easter holiday.
Because of the poor increase in sales volumes, business was regarded
as well below average for the time of year and to a greater extent than
in the previous two months.
Orders placed on suppliers fell in June -- having risen slightly in
April and May -- reflecting the fact that stocks were regarded as more
than adequate in relation to expected demand.
The volume of retail sales is expected to expand a little more quickly
in July -- although it should be noted that growth in High Street trade
has been broadly in line with expectations only twice in the past 12
months. Sales for the time of year are expected to remain slightly below
average although less so than in June.
Most retail sectors did see some growth in sales in the year to June.
The largest volume increases were reported by clothing retailers,
followed by booksellers and stationers along with hardware, china and
DIY shops.
However, the sharpest reductions compared with a year ago were
reported by furniture and carpet retailers along with off-licences.
Orders placed with suppliers fell for the first time since March --
contrary to retailers' expectations -- reflecting more than adequate
stock levels in relation to expected demand.
Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey
Panel, commented: ''Sluggish growth has led retailers to regard business
for the time of year as below average and to a greater extent than in
the previous two months.''

<TEXT>
OFFICE equipment supplier Gestetner has received a bid approach from
Japan's Ricoh group. Ricoh is considering making a cash offer at 90p per
share and has been talking to Gestetner with the aim of forming an
agreed bid.
Ricoh already owns 28.8% of Gestetner and has been a shareholder since
1991. Gestetner's other leading shareholder, Inchcape, with 15.1%, has
indicated it would approve a bid.
Gestetner chairman David Thompson said directors not associated with
either Ricoh or Inchcape were concerned that the Ricoh offer falls
seriously short on two crucial issues.
Firstly, it appeared to discriminate between different classes of
shareholder. Secondly, the price was an opportunistic attempt to exploit
the recent fall in the company's share price and undervalued its
potential for recovery and growth.
''We are advising shareholders to sit tight while we talk to Ricoh
about the real value of Gestetner.''

YESTERDAY'S retail price index figures for June showing annual
headline inflation rising to 3.5% from 3.4% in May made little impact on
financial markets with the outcome much in line with expectations.
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, rose
to 2.8% from 2.7%, again in line with market projections.
In foreign exchange markets, though, sterling lost early gains against
the German mark after the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged,
against a minority market view that some easing could be expected,
citing a shock upturn in inflation in June.
The RPI meant little in terms of the implication for interest rates at
this stage but an extraordinary feature of the inflation figures was the
admission from the Central Statistical Office that, because of a mistake
in the recording of house prices, the headline inflation rate was
understated by 0.1% in March and May this year.
However, in accordance with established practice there has been no
retrospective revision. The correction has been built into the June data
(adding 0.2%) and will be incorporated into the data in the future.
What it means is that investors in National Savings products, which
are geared to headline inflation, are to be paid compensation by means
of an ex gratia payment. The index-linked gilts interest payments
concerned have yet to be paid and this will be done on the basis of the
estimated index without the understatement. The compensation total is
estimated at around #300,000.
Meanwhile it seems likely that the June RPI will make little
difference to the Chancellor who, concerned about the pace of recovery
as highlighted by the second successive monthly fall in manufacturing
output in May, will resist any call for an increase in interest rates
when he next meets with the Governor of the Bank of England on July 27.
The Governor, for his part, will no doubt be plugging the inflationary
pressures apparent in producer prices earlier this week.
Between May and June there was a record fall in seasonal food prices
though this was partly offset by higher non-seasonal food prices.
Housing and motoring costs also rose and there were other upward
pressures from leisure and personal goods.
Analysts are agreed that on the basis of the data so far, UK base
rates will remain on hold though whether this is regarded as the correct
course to take is a moot point. Goldman Sachs' David Walton said the
fact that prices have tended to rise a little faster over the past three
and six months suggests that a further small deterioration in inflation
is already in the pipeline.
But the main concern is that these figures do not fully reflect the 5%
decline in sterling seen since the end of last year. Mr Walton considers
that although the economy appears to have slowed further in the second
quarter this is unlikely to prevent a rise in underlying inflation to 4%
by the middle of next year.
The Chancellor and the Governor will have to judge whether the economy
is slowing sufficiently to bring inflation down again towards the 2.5%
target during the second half of next year and through 1997. This is
regarded as unlikely but is sufficiently uncertain for the Chancellor to
be able to argue for several months that the rise in inflation will
simply prove a blip.
Adam Cole of James Capel says that on the whole, the figures do little
to change the outlook for inflation. Capel continues to look for a
gradual deterioration over the next two years with the Government's
underlying measure moving up to 3.2% by the end of this year and 4% by
the end of 1996.

OPEN season was called yesterday for the regional electricity
companies (REC) of England and Wales when Southern Electric
International, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Southern Company of the
US, announced a #1000m bid for South Western Electricity (SWEB).
The news was not entirely unexpected but even so SWEB shares gained
11p to 938p. Southern Electric is offering #38 in cash and #52 in bonds
for every 10 SWEB shares, valuing each SWEB share at #9. There is a
fully underwriten cash alternative of #9 per share. In addition, SWEB
shareholders who accept the offer, of which 11.2% already have in
Monday's dawn raid, including any of the alternatives, will retain the
proposed final SWEB dividend of 20.3p net.
The offer has been structured to allow shareholders to elect to
receive, as part of their consideration, GRID bonds which will give them
rights to shares in the National Grid in the event of its flotation at
#2 a share.
The board of South Western Electricity headed by chairman Maurice
Warren promptly rejected the offer saying that it did not provide SWEB
shareholders with fair value. ''The value of the company significantly
exceeds the inadequate price placed on it by SEI'' said Mr Warren.
He added that to bid now at this level ''is naive'' and that it was a
waste of management time and shareholders' money.
The City was expecting a bid closer to #9.50 a share. However
Southern's advisors were at pains to stress the generosity of the bid
stripping out the National Grid element in SWEB's valuation. The RECs
collectively own the National Grid transmission system which could be
floated in the autumn, releasing value to shareholders.
Thomas Boren, president and chief executive of Southern Electric
International, said that the UK had been chosen for overseas expansion
because of the similar culture, regulatory environment and relatively
stable political environment.
He said that customer satisfaction was a key part of the group's
operating philosophy, being a determining factor in staff remuneration.
Its operating companies had complete autonomy in terms of day-to-day
management and that the headquarters of SWEB would remain in Bristol.
Southern Electric hopes to bring efficiency benefits to SWEB partly
through accelerating the existing cost reduction programme although they
refused to say what this would mean in terms of job losses.
It also hopes to introduce various products and systems which operate
in the US such as hand-held or remote access meter reading done on a
monthly basis for domestic customers and real time pricing through an
Interlink product which allows larger industrial and commercial users to
shift their production schedules to when electricity prices are
cheapest.
Differences in power generation and taxation make it difficult to
compare electricity prices in the US and UK. However the average unit
cost to Southern Electric's domestic customers is 4.7p compared to about
7.9p for SWEB.
Having talked to a number of RECs including Southern Group which
adjoins SWEB's geographic area, Southern Electric decided that SWEB had
the most synergy with its existing operations and was of a manageable
size, although it has not ruled out making other investments in the UK.
This might include surplus power stations from National Power.
In the US and other parts of the world it is not unusual for capital
intensive industries such as utilities to have a much higher proportion
of debt in their balance sheet than their UK counterparts. Debt funding
is typically only half that of equity capital and so this cost saving is
available to pass through to customers in the form of lower prices.
If allowable, Southern Electric would like to acquire SWEB through an
acquisition vehicle with #600m of debt and #400m of equity, equivalent
to a maximum of 120% gearing. Once the bid succeeded this vehicle would
be folded into SWEB which is currently just 15% geared.
Having spoken with various UK regulatory authorities Southern Electric
is confident that it will not face any referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Mr Boren added that he was confident that the group
would be able to work with the regulatory regime whether or not there is
a change of government.
Western markets for a number of products including electricity are
mature and face increasing competitive and regulatory pressures.
Therefore it is not surprising that large companies such as The Southern
Company will be looking to diversify outside of their traditional
territories.
The same is true for UK water and power companies who are investing in
overseas projects particularly in the South East Asia where a
combination of rapid economic growth and market liberalisation is
throwing up some attractive investment opportunities.
The Southern Company is the largest quoted electric utility holding
company in the US, capitalised at around $14.7bn. In its core business
territory of over 120,000 square miles in the US, the Southern Group
serves over 3.5 million domestic customers. As well as its businesses in
the south east of North America, it also has assets in the form of
electric generating plants or utilities in Argentina, Chile, the Bahamas
and Trinidad and Tobago. In addition it is developing projects in
Indonesia and China.
The electricity sector had already moved higher in the wake of the
publication of the latest industry regulatory review which was not as
onerous as some companies had feared. The bid for SWEB will provide
added impetus to REC shares. The market is still waiting to see whether
Trafalgar House will renew its bid for Northern Electric.

A YOUNG American was gored to death as he ran before the bulls at
Pamplona in northern Spain -- the first death of the San Fermin festival
in 15 years.
Matthew Tassio, 22, from Illinois, was sent flying half-way through
the 8am dash through the fenced-off streets of the town. As he struggled
to his feet, one bull gored his stomach, severing the main heart artery.
Dr Mariano Martinez, head of the emergency unit at the city hospital,
said: ''In 30 years I've never seen a worse horn wound.''
Thirteen people have been killed in the history of the fiesta, made
famous by Ernest Hemingway's novel The Sun Also Rises.
Scots-born animal rights campaigner Vicki Moore is still in intensive
care after being gored 11 times by a bull during another village fiesta
19 days ago. Her husband Tony said it could be many weeks before she was
allowed home.

AN Edinburgh-based company today launches a short-cut to the Internet,
aimed at Scotland's businesses, which are still grappling with the
information superhighway.
Communicata Limited claims that accessing The Herald and Evening Times
and other companies such as the Bank of Scotland or Virgin can prove
difficult without an all-important mailbox address.
Director Martin Browne said Communicata's service combines
comprehensive information on a wide range of the business and leisure
sector, linked to companies and their products.
Instead of browsing through huge lists, or inches-thick catalogues,
''shoppers'' can tap in their needs and the service will automatically
come up with a list of businesses who can meet their specific needs.
Current estimates have shown there are between 750,000 and 900,000
Internet users, with the market set to grown.
Communicata have chosen to specialise in business and leisure to offer
the best service possible to users from their premises in King's
Buildings, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh.
Mr Browne said: ''Just as STV creates programming that draws viewers
and advertisers, we have to create pages that provide users with
interesting and up-to-date information. But users want more than passive
information.
''Investment in intelligent software has enabled us to be one of the
first companies to offer an on-line interactive directory that allows
the user to link into product catalogues and to communicate directly
with the supplier.''
Communicata colleague Tony Purcell said a lack of information and
misconceptions appeared to be holding a number of businesses back from
effectively using the Web as part of their sales and marketing efforts.
''Overall, as the number of people having access to personal computers
increases, the global information network looks set to go mainstream,''
he said.
The service is expected to effectively enable companies to advertise
to an estimated audience of 30 million worldwide.

<HEADLINE>Commerzbank is latest to woo Smith New Court</HEADLINE>

THE takeover battle for Smith New Court intensified last night after
Germany's Commerzbank confirmed it was holding talks with the top
independent equity broker and rumours spread through the City that other
bidders had joined the fight.
Analysts say the winner will have to pay around #500m to buy Smith New
Court. SNC shares closed 8p firmer at 519p.
A Commerzbank spokesman said on Wednesday there was no foundation to
rumours that it was in such talks but issued a terse statement yesterday
that said: ''. . . The bank confirms it is a party holding discussions
with Smith New Court.''
Smith New Court has said it was holding talks ''with a small number of
parties'' which might lead to a bid for it, but did not name them.
Commerzbank -- the third-largest of the big Frankfurt-based commercial
banks -- is the first of the possible candidates to declare itself.
Other potential suitors, according to the City rumour mill, include US
firms Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney, J P Morgan and Bear Stearns. The
British investment bank Schroders is also thought to be in the running.
Merchant bank N M Rothschild, a major shareholder in Smith New Court
with a stake of 25.9%, has yet to make public its position on
Commerzbank's intentions.
Although Rothschild has refused to comment, analysts believe the Smith
New Court board will have kept it informed and that the merchant bank is
likely to accept any recommendation, especially since the price will be
over double book value, the company's net assets, and therefore hard to
resist.
Analysts were surprised that Commerzbank had chosen to make a further
move in expanding its capacity in the City after it paid around #170m
earlier in the year for the fund management firm Jupiter Tyndall.
''This seems like an opportunistic move for Commerzbank,'' said John
Leonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''It would leave
them a business in Frankfurt and a business in London, independent of
each other.''
Analysts suggest that the German bank may be the preferred partner for
Smith New Court rather than Merrill Lynch. They say there will be little
overlap between SNC and Commerzbank, while the overlap with Merrill
would be considerable, especially in research and back office
activitites.
''It's expected that Commerzbank would take the same view that other
German banks have taken with their acquisitions in London and let them
get on with it, whereas Merrill would be expected to change things,''
said an analyst.
Commerzbank's two main rivals, Deutsche and Dresdner, have recently
expanded their investment banking capabilities in London.

PORTLAND: Another witness implicated two British former members of the
Rajneeshee religious cult in a conspiracy to kill the US Attorney for
Oregon 10 years ago.
Richard Langford, who until 1987 was the live-in lover of Sally-Anne
Croft, testified that both defendants were active participants in the
unfulfilled plot to kill Charles Turner.
Croft and co-accused Susan Hagan were extradited from Britain after a
long legal battle to stand trial in Oregon.
Langford testified that at the first meeting where killing Turner was
discussed, Hagan delivered a pep talk to the others.
''Sue, at one point, said that you have to make a decision for your
master and your commune. You have to be strong and get up and do what
has to be done. I'm paraphrasing, but it was to this effect,'' Langford
said, and added that Croft was at subsequent meetings where the plot was
discussed.--Reuter.

LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging group, is planning to buy out
minority shareholders in its North American subsidiary Bonar Inc in a
deal worth #18.2m.
Finance director Norman McLeod said two institutions, which together
own 63% of the 20.8% minority stake in Bonar Inc, had already agreed in
principle to sell out at the proposed price of $38 Canadian per share.
This compares with Bonar Inc's average price of $24 to $25 on Toronto
stock exchange where the stock is infrequently traded.
Low &amp; Bonar is now sounding out other minority shareholders and a
final decision on whether to proceed with the transaction is expected by
mid-August.
Mr McLeod said he was confident that it would go ahead.
The Ontario-based subsidiary controls Low &amp; Bonar's interests in
Canada and the United States.
Mr McLeod said full ownership of Bonar Inc would give the group more
operational flexibility and would enhance earnings.
In particular, it would become easier for Low &amp; Bonar to make
acquisitions in North America and finance its operations there from the
UK.
Bonar Inc's flexible packaging and moulded plastics business turned in
a good performance during the six months to May 31.
Profit before interest increased 60% to #6.7m, turnover was up 18% to
#63.2m and margins improved to 10.5% from 7.8%. But the Scottish parent
company said earlier this week that it saw scope for further
improvement.

TODAY a little-publicised Bill -- successfully piloted through the
Upper House by Lord Hylton -- is due for its crucial second reading in
the Commons. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill would enable UK courts
to try UK citizens for crimes committed against children abroad.
This Bill would not only help protect many desperately vulnerable
children in poor countries, such as Thailand, from exploitation by child
abusers, heterosexual and homosexual, who regularly go to the Third
World for foreign holidays or ''volunteer'' work. It would help British
police forces build up dossiers against abusers also likely to be active
in the UK.
A recent Christian Aid report on tourism and child prostitution in the
Third World found a high proportion of ''sex tourists'' were British,
and that in the Philippines and Sri Lanka were one of the main groups of
men deported for sexual abuse against children.
Such men ''have also turned to computer networks to spread information
about sex tourism and child prostitutes. The 'information superhighway'
offers these men a new opportunity to circumvent international and
national legislation . . .'' The report called on the British Government
to prosecute companies, as well as individuals, who promote sex tourism
involving children.
But the Government is going to block this Bill today, saying it is
unworkable in practice -- even though Australia, New Zealand and several
European countries already operate similar laws. (For instance, there
have been successful prosecutions in Sweden.) Home Secretary Michael
Howard has promised ''an urgent review'' of the law, but campaigners
believe this does not go far enough.
Vocal lobbying for the measures in this Bill would be one way
concerned people in all parties could take forward positively issues
such as the recent, highly-charged and publicised debate about actor
Eric Cullen's jail sentence on indecency charges.
The usual criticism of disputed child abuse cases is that individual
young people's rights and needs are swept beneath the waves of grand
principles and general causes. In the ''Wee Burney'' debate, the needs
of one individual and the anger of his supporters submerged major
issues, and many other vulnerable people.
Even the basic point that indecent photography is itself a form of
child abuse seemed to be lost. Some deeply committed journalists ended
up making highly distasteful personal attacks on other journalists. And
when one said this nine-month sentence was the greatest miscarriage of
justice he had known in 20 years, the affront to the Guildford Four,
Birmingham Six, Judith Ward or indeed George Beattie and Emma Humphreys
seemed as painful as it was embarrassing.
Of course, sentencing is an important issue. So is the very complex
relationship between victimising and being a victim. If a sentence was
appropriate, there were more constructive, imaginative ones than prison.
But we need to go much further back than this.
The most crucial, glaring question to act upon, which many people
forgot to ask (though to be fair to Cullen, his own statements would
prompt it) was why on earth the paedophile Frank Currens was able to
abuse and intimidate countless children for 18 years, without children
feeling free to tell, without those who did so being believed, and
without other adults noticing.
Those of us unfortunate enough to have stared into the cesspit of
child sex abuse know something of the costs people like Currens inflict.
We know of many children, teenagers and adults who have killed
themselves, or tried many times, or are repeatedly tormented with
suicidal thoughts; finding no-one to keep a 24-hour watch or even to
diagnose their problems. Surely all are equally deserving of our care.
Hardly a week passes without press reports of Currens-type scandals --
of residential school heads, priests, ministers or other respected
authority figures finally convicted after decades of abuse against
children in their care. Yet we never seem to learn the obvious lessons.
Instead, children's court evidence is repeatedly thrown out as
untrustworthy. Young children, as in Sheriff Miller's Ayrshire judgment,
are branded ''devious and manipulative'', while millions of pounds and
staff-hours are spent in trying to make children's evidence more
''reliable'' to adults -- whatever the trauma to young people.
In contrast, desperately under-resourced police units can't even view
thousands of seized child porn videos, let along follow up clues from
films which have already enabled them to arrest several abusive rings.
Recently the director of the National Criminal Intelligence Service,
Britain's main police intelligence-gathering organisation, publicly
demanded more resources and legal teeth to extend its heavily restricted
work. In the past year, it received about 350 incoming intelligence
reports on paedophiles.
Many well-meaning people in senior jobs also need to search their
consciences about the freedom allowed to child abusers over decades. All
those second chances, given people thought to have made one foolish
mistake; when more often they've spent their lives accumulating victims,
unspeakable videos and photographs, or intimately detailed diaries.
Some months ago I was astonished to see, featured on a TV documentary
about leading ''childcare expert'' Peter Righton, reminders of the
paedophile activities of Dr Morris Fraser. Because it shot me back 22
years to when Fraser's conviction for child offences caused shock-waves
in Belfast. Thousands of people heard of it. For the dapper, boyish
figure in a smart blazer was one of Ulster's best-known child
psychiatrists, research writers and conference-speakers on the effects
of ''The Troubles'' on children.
How many jobs had he moved to subsequently, how many references from
respected people had failed to mention his history? This was just one
example among many. I think it should be made an offence for any referee
to conceal their knowledge of a job applicant's history of risk to
children.
Meantime, another new move will challenge organisations including
churches to begin taking real steps to make young people safer from the
minority of abusers who deliberately target work with vulnerable
youngsters.
Supported by the Scottish Office, Volunteer Development Scotland have
just published Protecting Children; a code of good practice for
voluntary organisations working with children and young people.
It asks them for a bit of effort and commitment -- like planning the
organisation's work so as to minimise situations where child abuse can
happen, rigorously scrutinising recruitment, and having an independent
complaints system. But protecting young people and taking their
integrity seriously is surely worth such effort and inconvenience. Then
there may be fewer ''Wee Burneys'' who, later in life, have such
traumatic secret histories to reveal.

THE Association of British Insurers (ABI) is set to face criticism
over its call to Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to introduce
a ''life insurance PEP'' in his next Budget from those in the industry
who want to separate life insurance from savings products.
The ABI wants the Government to allow a new kind of life insurance PEP
alongside the existing PEPs and subject to the same limits. But some big
names in the industry are known to want to get away from the mixing of
life insurance with savings, arguing that it is no longer appropriate
and only confuses consumers.
It is thought that the ''backwoodsmen'' among the ABI council have
promoted the idea against the wishes of the industry majors.
The marketing of savings products masquerading as life policies stems
from past tax concessions which no longer exist and they rarely provide
enough life cover for adequate protection. They can also carry higher
charges than straight savings products.
Critics argue that an insurance PEP is merely an attempt by smaller
life companies to jump on the PEPs' bandwagon while preserving high
charges. The ABI also calls for removing the tax disadvantages of single
premium policies compared with PEPs.
Its other Budget submissions are likely to meet with general approval
in the industry. These include loosening the proportion of income limits
on pension contributions and modifying pension rules so that the fund
built up in a personal pension policy can be accessed for other forms of
protection such as long-term care, permanent health and critical
illness.

THE European Court of Human Rights ruled today that Britain violated
the right to freedom of expression of author Count Nikolai Tolstoy by
ordering him to pay excessive libel damages.
The British courts had fined Tolstoy, whose father was a cousin of
Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, the author of War and Peace, a total of
#1.5m for accusing Lord Aldington of war crimes after the Second World
War.
Tolstoy went to the European Court after losing an appeal in Britain
over the damages award, which was three times the highest libel award
previously made in Britain.
The court review did not extend to the initial jury's finding of libel
itself, but only to the damages award.
''Having regard to the size of the award in conjunction with the state
of national law at the relevant time, the Court found unanimously that
there had been a violation of the applicant's rights under Article 10
(of the European Convention of Human Rights),'' said a summary of the
judgment.
It found, however, that an injunction restraining Count Tolstoy from
repeating libellous statements against Lord Aldington did not violate
his right to freedom of expression since it was ''only a logical
consequence'' of the libel finding.
It also said Count Tolstoy had not been denied justice by a British
court order that he must provide nearly #125,000 in security for the
plaintiff's costs.
The European court, whose rulings are binding on states, awarded Count
Tolstoy money to cover legal fees and expenses incurred in the
Strasbourg proceedings.--Reuter.

NINE months ago we ignored the mother-in-law and moved to Lambeth.
It's cheaper than leafy suburbia, and what it lacks in social cachet and
clean air it makes up for in proximity to the heart of London. From our
windows we can see Big Ben squatting between the council tower blocks.
We never admit to living in Lambeth, of course. We're in Kennington,
at the north end of the borough, an odd mix of post-war concrete estates
and rows of eighteenth-century Georgian terraces on the south bank of
the Thames. Muttered the right way it almost sounds like Kensington.
But last week we were brutally reminded of where we are by Sir Paul
Condon, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. In a letter to black
community leaders, he announced that 80% of reported muggings in London
were the work of young blacks. Lambeth, he added, was one of the three
worst hit areas.
The reaction was immediate. The right praised him for having the
courage to admit something everyone knows to be true. The left accused
him of insensitivity. And London's black population attacked him for
playing to the racists with statistics of dubious validity.
Criminologist Jock Young of Middlesex University has pointed out the
obvious, that muggings are carried out by young, alienated and poor
inner-city males. Where you have a large and poor black population, the
number of black muggers is bound to be proportionately high. ''So in
London it would be blacks and in Glasgow it would be whites. The racial
thing is a red herring,'' he says.
But in Lambeth Condon's remarks hit a nerve. This is a typical
inner-city area. Two-thirds of its non-white population, which makes up
30% of the total, is black and centred two miles away in Brixton. The
borough is only just emerging from the decay caused by years in the
hands of the less acceptable wing of the Labour Party.
Property prices and crime are its unavoidable dinner party topics. On
moving in we installed window locks, infra-red security lights at front
and back, and a rather complicated alarm system, complete with panic
button by the bed. Not that this has affected the way we live. We seldom
remember to lock the front door at night, let alone set the alarm when
we go out.
We find reassurance in our illustrious neighbours, mostly MPs: Jim
Wallace, George Foulkes, and that's Paddy Ashdown's garden behind us.
Greta Scacchi used to live round the corner. I even find I worry more
about the unwashed nose-ring types from the squats across the park who
congregate at the nearby pub, than I do about the jaunty young black men
walking past the house.
But at the barber's the politics of race are as clear-cut as, well,
black and white. The stylist has been in his basement shop for 30 years.
He is a large, pig-like man who will do a No 3 on your back 'n sides in
five minutes flat. For waiting customers he keeps an extraordinary
supply of hard-core porn magazines next to the daily copy of the Sun.
Trying to make conversation on my first visit, I mentioned how much we
enjoyed being so close to the city centre and how silly people were to
move to the suburbs. ''I live in Surrey myself,'' he said. Embarrassed
silence. ''I was born round the corner and me mum still lives here, but
the bongo-bongos got too much and I moved out.''
Surely the streets around here didn't feel that dangerous, I ventured.
Tel exchanged looks with his other customer. Well, they wouldn't let
their women walk alone at night. ''It's like Zulu out there,'' Tel
laughed. ''We need Michael Caine to come in and sort 'em out.''
Sam the newsagent is Asian and even more vocal. Leaning on a stack of
the Voice, London's black newspaper, with its headline ''Condon is an
ass'', he almost shouts. ''It's always the black boys. Every week I
chase them. I tell the ladies not to walk through the square. Last week
they mugged the judge. The judge! Watch out for those blacks. And don't
let your wife walk by herself after six.''
Late the other night, as I was doing the washing up, someone banged
frantically on the kitchen window, which gives onto the front. He was
black and shouting. ''I need water for my car, it's overheating, please
help.'' There was indeed a car outside, and no-one else in sight.
According to Condon's definition of London, I should have remembered
all the stories London loves to frighten itself with, of gangs of
violent robbers using the ''I need to use a phone'' excuse to gain
access to your house, and told him to go away.
Instead I went out with a bottle of water. The man filled his
radiator, thanked me, and drove off. You see, Commissioner, it's no use
frightening people. Some of us have to live here.

ANVAR KHAN believes that Channel 4's flagship youth show, which was
finally scuttled yesterday, should never have been launched in the first
place
IT WAS a bad idea anyway, having a channel to cater for minority
interests; this could only guarantee a minority audience. Minority
audiences have their place in film, radio, and literature, but they are
as influential as the cult favourites they seek out. Television, however
is for everybody, and the worst programmes are made when producers
forget this simple fact.
From the outset, Channel 4 wanted to break taboos. It fancied itself
as a maverick station. Broadcasting The Word illustrated the high-handed
and somewhat dumb authority of the channel bosses. But their
misundersanding of what constitutes youth TV cannot be held against
them, just the producers who got to them in the first place.
The Word was a prime example of ''concept'' TV. It was a pose. It
tried to tell everyone it was clever, not through its gratuitous,
public-schoolboy humour, but through the fact it existed in the first
place. The show, where people were filmed in the toilet and practising
sexual dares in the studio, revelled in being reviled.
The series was made by Planet 24, a production company run by Bob
Geldof. Bob's all right, apart from his estranged wife, Paula Yates, who
personifies how pathetic the pursuit of eternal youth is. Ever since
Live Aid, where, Sir Bob said, the media was used to the best of its
ability, he has meddled and dabbled in controversial interpretations of
the power TV has. Not unconscious rebellion, the tapping of the nation's
psyche, but the self-conscious kind, such as The Big Breakfast.
Bob Geldof and Paula Yates, however, do not have the pedigree of youth
expert Janet Street-Porter, responsible for Eurotrash and Badaas TV. Bob
was a pop star, Paula was a groupie, Janet was a journalist. The Tube,
which Paula co-presented with Jools Holland, believed itself to push
back the barriers of broadcasting. Self-proclaimed intellectuals have
been trying to do this ever since.
The mindset of companies such as Planet 24 is necessary to understand,
for they establish what programmes, like The Word, will represent. Ten
years ago it was deemed radical within the grey-suited world of TV
politics, to stop being so constipated and give the public what they
want. This opened the floodgates to numbers of greedy, narrow-minded
talentless cynics.
What The Word should have been was another 3-2-1, or Stars In Their
Eyes. The idea of trying to create a new style of TV was patronising to
the British public on two accounts. One, that it presumed that in order
to be radical one had to go to the polar opposite of quality, and two,
that people really wanted to watch trashy TV because Britain is really a
nation of Sun readers. Their worst move was to let lovers of highbrow
culture create their own version of populism. But they didn't make a
drama out of this mistake, just a naff, weekly crisis.
Budgets were allocated to programmes such as The Word because Channel
4, as a guardian and defender of minority interests, decided it wanted
to be trendy too. The men in grey suits are like any other boardroom
bunch. They are inclined to go along with people or programmes who
profess to know all there is about the younger generation and its
tastes. They are clueless and desperate. They are suckered into
believing that crass ideas are really a breath of much-needed fresh air.
If there are no restrictions, no rules, however, you end up with a
plasma rather than a product. Television is a medium whose taste is
regulated by the Government, not the market-place. Therefore you
couldn't buy anything as bad as The Word.
Nobody minds blatant exhibitionism that much, our best actors each
have a large dose, but it is only tolerable when someone else is writing
the script. Showing-off one's own, personal, cretinous personality is a
mistake. Hapless musicians and celebs sometimes whooped it up on the
couch, thinking that this ''cool'' behaviour would endear them to the
audience.
Other guests sat in shock, as Terry Christian babbled on, as the slow
realisation that they were on a programme which had no respect for
anybody finally dawned.
Some handled the hedonistic mayhem well. But they were only there
because they thought they should be, that having appeared on The Word
they had somehow passed an important credibility test.
Thing is, Channel 4 do want to ''push out the frontiers of
television'', but they are just being very sad about how they do it. The
appointment of Stuart Cosgrove as commissioning editor, the man who
showcased wee Glasgow hairies stealing and fighting and sold it to
England as our other national product, did in itself, through the
calibre of his previous work, publicise Channel 4's new agenda, so the
ensuing media flap about its self-promotion should come as no surprise.
Sex and violence sell, but if Channel 4 is to retain its highbrow
status then the sex and violence must be treated in a documentary style.
Late-night pornographic real-life films and ''Dyke TV'', their gay and
lesbian season are only controversial in that they've never been done
before, but that was probably for a good reason. Sex is not scandalous,
only the abuse of it is.
Now that The Word has been dropped from the screen, there will be
triumphant cries from producers who will insist that the programme's
demise was due to the fact that the public were not ready for it, that
the format was ahead of its time.
They will say that complaints, past, present and future, only justify
their position as rebels, as those in charge of emancipating TV. Channel
4 will still claim victory. Michael Grade should swap his tired grey
suit for a brighter colour, a stirring, non-conformist design such as
striped green and purple. Perhaps something along the lines of the test
card. He can change how he looks, but not the insecurity underneath.
Same goes for his channel.

SURPLUS capacity in the package holiday market coupled with weak
consumer demand means it's a tough time to be a UK tour operator.
First Choice Holidays, formerly Owners Abroad, is Britain's
third-largest holiday company but even so it is facing margin pressure
in a difficult market. Discounts on late sales for May and June were
considerably higher than last year.
The company's bearish comments on current trading overshadowed its
slightly better-than-expected first-half losses of #23.8m, a 17%
reduction on the same period last year. Turnover was up 38% to #315m.
Passenger numbers improved by 30% to 1.3 million. The interim dividend
was maintained at 1.4p.
Chief executive Francis Baron said that the full financial benefits of
the restructuring and rebranding of the group had yet to work through to
the bottom line. Bookings for summer 1995 are said to be 6% ahead of
last year in a flat market and there is said to have been an impressive
start to the winter programme. Almost half of the winter bookings come
from its Canadian business ITH, which contributed profits of #7.9m.
Bookings are currently up 107% on last year with First Choice's market
share increasing to 15% from 5.3% last year. The group's financial
position is strong with cash balances at the end of the half-year of
#72.1m despite increased marketing expenditure.
''The group is now well placed to move forward strongly with the new
brands firmly established, a significantly improved market share
position and good profits coming from our counter-seasonal subsidiary in
Canada,'' said Mr Baron.
First Choice shares dropped 3p to 103p.

With the arrest of an 84-year-old on charges of war crimes, William
Russell considers the problems and costs of investigating events which
happened 50 years ago -- and the wisdom of attempting to prosecute
THE cost of the Scotland Yard unit, set up in May 1991 to investigate
alleged war crimes, is currently #6.6m. The unit is believed to have
looked into about 70 cases, and papers relating to seven suspects have
been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service -- it is said to be
investigating 14 other people.
The original #5m funding, provided by the Home Office, ran out in
March, but the Metropolitan Police had other budgets on which to draw
and the Government has continued to provide funds. By any standards,
this has been a costly exercise.
One of the seven cases was the 84-year-old Banstead resident, Szymon
Serafinowicz, charged yesterday under the 1991 War Crimes Act, the first
man in Britain to be so charged. Serafinowicz was granted bail by Epsom
magistrates, and will appear before the court on October 5. His
solicitor said his client was completely innocent and a full and
vigorous defence would now be prepared. Legal aid would be applied for,
he added.
The arrest resurrects the debate about the wisdom of charging people
with war crimes so long after the event. Is it justice, or a case of an
eye for an eye? Can witnesses be relied upon 50 years after the event?
Is the documentary evidence trustworthy? A great deal of the recent
information has come from the previously inaccessible files of the KGB,
but how much reliance can be placed on them is anybody's guess.
Australia abandoned the last of its war crimes trials a year ago without
any convictions, while in Israel the Supreme Court dismissed the case of
John Demjanuk, alleged to have been the death camp guard Ivan the
Terrible, after KGB files showed he was not the man.
A war crimes unit set up in Scotland at the same time as the one in
England was also disbanded last year after investigators had looked into
17 cases without charges being brought. It was wound up by the Crown
Office on the grounds that there was not sufficient evidence available
for any criminal prosecution in the cases reported to it. Visits to 10
countries at a cost of #500,000 were undertaken.
In the end only one man, Anton Gecas, a retired mining engineer living
in Edinburgh, was named as a war criminal. But that was the result of
his taking a civil case last year against Scottish Television for
defamation following allegations in a documentary that he had been
involved in the wartime murder of Jews and civilians in Lithuania.
Gecas, then 79, lost the case and the judge, Lord Milligan, said he
was clearly satisfied that Gecas had taken part in many operations
involving the killing of innocent Soviet citizens, including old men,
women and children.
The 1991 War Crimes Act, which caused bitter controversy in
Parliament, had to be forced through under the terms of the Parliament
Act after the House of Lords had rejected it by 131 votes to 109. The
legislation had been twice approved in the Commons in different
sessions, and the use of the Parliament Act allowed it to become law
without the consent of the Lords.
It gave power to British courts to prosecute alleged war criminals in
spite of the fact that they were not British citizens at the time of the
alleged crimes and the crimes had not been committed on British soil.
The Government had been forced to consider the possibility that war
criminals were leading normal lives in Britain in 1987 after the Simon
Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles gave a list of 17 suspects to Douglas
Hurd, then Home Secretary. That led to the legislation which was brought
forward to the Commons on a free vote.
In the Commons in May this year the Attorney General, Sir Nicholas
Lyell, insisted that any decisions on prosecutions would be on proper
principles, taken as a hint that he was planning to go ahead in spite of
the known difficulties. Those difficulties were admitted on Wednesday
night when the news of the intention to charge Serafinowicz emerged. Sir
Nicholas issued a statement to the media warning about the danger of
prejudicing the trial through background reporting.

PRIME Minister Lamberto Dini's technocrat government won a confidence
vote today and immediately called for two more to speed the passage of a
key pensions Bill through the Italian Parliament.
Labour Minister Tiziano Treu announced the extra confidence votes
after the government learned it had won the first with 284 votes for,
147 against, and 148 abstentions.
Dini has said his government will offer to stand down after the
pensions legislation becomes law.
A ''yes'' vote in the remaining confidence votes could therefore speed
his own resignation and open up possibilities or early polls or Dini's
technocrats being given a further limited mandate.--Reuter.

IT appears that the hot humid weather has driven some of Britain's
wildlife into overdrive and the bugs are mating like old-fashioned Tims
and are frenzied with lust. Well there are a lot of bugs about,
including the little ones which infest computers and word processors --
including the bloody ones in this office who managed to screw up the 500
words I wrote on this damned machine.
I am now re-labouring at this column because after 500 words of yer
Urban V's Golden Drivel I lost the bloody lot. Grist to the mill of
so-called artists because I had embarked upon a Swiftian tirade against
artists, especially visual ones, the charlatans.
My last tirade, the one which disappeared into the bloody
word-processor forever, was kinder than this one is going to be because
I am practically weeping with hay fever and frustration and am sweating
over this machine like a caught sex-offender. Let me tell you about the
Arts.
If you think sport has become incredibly greedy and that amateur
sports are about as Corinthian as Kerry Packer, the Arts has them in the
shade when it comes to venality. The Booker Prize now: that is the wee
boy. Of all the Booker prizewinners only Kennealy's Schindler's Ark
could be read past the tenth page and that was because it was a story
instead of a self-indulgent ramble designed for very odd people who
would wish to be critics. Ach I don't think the writers are
self-indulgent at all and I don't think the critics are critics either.
I just don't think that any of them are right in the head.
And this goes for the Visual Arts prize thingmy -- the Turner Prize,
worth 20 grand. That is a bit of poppy. It is a damned disgrace if any
of the short-leeted artists win it. Let me tell you about the artists
and their art. There is Damien Hirst -- any artist called Damien should
have been thrown in the bucket along with his work. This Hirst has shown
a dead sheep preserved in formaldehyde: he does a lot of this art,
showing dead animals.
Yet another shortlisted artist, a Mark Wallinger, has gone one better
for he displays live animals. His show was a racehorse because, he said,
his racehorse is closer to a horse than any painter could get. In this
case I know him to be right and I hope the animal defecates on him at
will and tramples him to death in its stall.
Maybe we could stick Damien into the stall as well and then preserve
the both of the mountebanks in formaldehyde and present the entire
tableau next year for this absurd prize. In fact, I have got this new
idea for all sorts of people being jammed into horseboxes with wild and
kicking equus caballus, starting with every judge and jury in this
insulting competition. We can include all the artists as well for this
bizarre and insulting farrago. Here are some more artists.
There is Mona Hatoum's varnished metal cot. It might occur to youse
out there that the boay whit made the metal cot did most of the work and
that varnishing it was a touch easy. Then there is another young artist,
(the Turner Prize is for British artists under 50 years of age) who has
applied for the twenty thousand spondulicks, Callum Innes. The Tate says
he creates ''works which are both extremely beautiful and possess a
transcendental or spiritual quality''.
As it happens Innes has paintings in which he lets turpentine run down
a monochrome canvas. At least it is a canvas: he could let the turps
flow down a wall in the Tate or even throw a pot of it in the public's
face. (Dear old Whistler: you little know what you started.)
Hirst, the dead-sheep man, often paints nice paintings though he is
often very silly, not last in the titles of his paintings. One of his
paintings is done in household gloss paint, which means that that the
paint will fall off the support in less than 10 years. It is called ''
beautiful, shattering, slashing, violent, pinky, hacking, sphincter
painting''. I know what sphincter his head is up.
But then, after travelling through the art school degree shows as I
did this year, and have done for some years, I can reveal that what you
taxpayers are rattling out the green ones for what is largely seen
through a similar spyhole.
Look through the splendid drawing and draughtsmanship in the
portfolios in every Scottish art college and then wonder at the drivel,
the pretentious mince, of the works on the walls which these young
people have been labouring over the past few years.
They can do better than that and I am damned where the ideas are
coming from except they are absurd and laboured. They are also
frequently ugly and sometimes designed to upset. And then look at the
marvellous work done by the craft and design faculties of the Scottish
art colleges, in silversmithing and ceramics and textiles and other
design areas. They are designed to show imagination and ability and
expertise, not just to shock.
I remember a Glasgow School of Art show some years back in which a
white-painted chair had three black-painted tampons placed on it, as an
exhibit like. There was only one way I could describe it in my review of
the show and I did. ''I suppose,'' I wrote, ''this is the Black and
White Menstrual Show''. A lot of readers wrote to complain; why I know
not. They should, they most certainly must, when they see the nonsense
which is likely to win this Turner Prize, complain about what has gone
wrong with what they call Fine Art.

Margaret Vaughan examines the background to the Serbian policy of
ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and speaks to two of its victims
HERS was one of the mutely pleading faces you saw pressed against a
bus window smeared with mud. His was the family you saw flee on foot,
dragging plastic bags and cardboard suitcases and weary children by the
hands, faces distorted by that determined look of intense fear.
They are safe now, at least physically, these two refugees of a
previous ethnic cleansing campaign. But they are not free.
The fall of Srebrenica, the images of Muslim refugees, women and
children huddled in fields, squatting in abandoned factories, forced
screaming on to buses: the men taken away at gunpoint to be ''screened''
for war crimes: it stirs the sense of remembered horror. For the second
time in this wretched war, ethnic cleansing stares them in the face.
Distance lends no sense of safety.
Neither of these refugees of the Serb pogroms of 1992 gives a name for
fear of reprisals against relatives. Ask him to tell you his story and
he says his is only the story of the Bosnian people. It is three and a
half years since he finally believed the urgent whisperings of those who
warned that the Serbs were coming for him. Why should they? He was only
a teacher: of Muslims and Serbs and Croat pupils.
From some miles away came news of the slaughter, of thousands of dead
Muslims, of Serbian atrocities. Some strangers arrived in his town. They
stood out. One day he heard they were coming for him. He took his wife,
ran to grab his children, a girl of 11, a boy of 13, from the school,
and they walked, fast, and kept on walking and stumbling over fields and
down the steps of back alleys, and they didn't look back. He knows now
that five minutes after they closed the door on their home, they came
for him.
They met his niece, a student, on the bridge out of town. Her mother
urged her to go, which was as well, for his sister was raped by the
Serbs when they came. Together they trekked into Croatia. The niece went
on to Germany. They came to Britain. But they don't belong. They were
given, like most of the 1000 or so Bosnians in Scotland, ''exceptional
leave to remain'' in this country. So they can stay, for now. But they
cannot settle.
His voice is flat. ''You see what is going on . . . but do nothing but
wring your hands.''
The accusations are delivered in a detached voice: ''During the Second
World War they did not use the term ethnic cleansing. Now it is a
euphemism for genocide, but still you stand back and say there is
nothing you can do.
''What's the matter with this world? We don't want your relief, or
your help, or your young people to die in Bosnia. We want you to give us
our rights to self-defence, nothing else. Let us arm ourselves.''
She was a medical student, in her third year in Sarajevo when the
purging began. The Muslims had to go. She felt menaced so she got on a
bus; 13 hours it took, with no water, no-one allowed to get off, before
it reached her home town. Her parents would not leave, so her brother, a
dental student, stayed too. Now they live surrounded by snipers and
fear.
She took another bus, then a troop plane to Belgrade. She reached
Edinburgh eventually, was helped by a charity to find a place as an au
pair. She tries to continue her studies but no medical school will take
her because she does not have the correct refugee status.
Her young cousin was killed in January, her aunt was badly injured,
her brother is fighting with the Muslims now: ''I can telephone
sometimes to my town and they will get messages to my parents. They are
completely surrounded but they do not want to leave everything behind
them.
''I don't know how to tell people about it, the horror, the terror. It
is, it is . . .'' She can't find the words, and there is a sense of
unravelling, of the careful composure coming apart as she watches the
images of those left behind suffering.
It is a symptom of their own suffering as refugees, says Nikki du
Preez. As co-director of Bosnia Now, a charity which helps Bosnian
refugees, she has seen marriages break down, health break down, minds
break down under the strain: ''The feeling of helplessness, of being
here and not being able to help in any way. You watch your friends
disintegrate. I can't convey strongly enough the grinding destruction of
it all.''

* Mladen Grbin came to Scotland from what was then Yugoslavia in the
sixties. Now a research associate at Glasgow University, he is
struggling to make sense of the conflict in his old homeland.
Ethnic cleansing, he says, was adopted by the Serbs for the purpose of
clearing their territory. It is a historical concept of ethnically pure
land. It was first mooted last century by a Serbian theorist Gerashnin.
During the Second World War, monarchists again wanted to see an
ethnically pure Serbian homeland. After Tito's death, a Serbian Minister
of the Interior, Mihail Kertes proposed that Bosnia Herzegovina should
be ethnically cleansed, meaning the forcible removal from the territory
of all but Serbian groups.
He, says Grbin, is the architect of the current ethnic cleansing
campaigns: ''It doesn't matter whether they be Muslims, gypsies, or
Croats. The concept means only Serbs can stay on the territory.''

Tails they lose: Elizabeth Westcott warns of the dangers in taking a
gamble when boarding out pets
CATS drift to sleep by comforting dim light, listening to music, at
Levernbank Cat Hotel while their owners are off on holiday. In winter
their spacious, well-ventilated enclosures are heated and it is always
quiet; the sound of peaceful, contented cats.
It may not have the quilted armchairs and carpeted floors the Yellow
Pages advertisements lead you to expect (''Ritz for cats'', ''luxury
chalets'', ''where cats nap and lap in luxury'' to quote a few) but it
does offer practical, cost-effective and pleasant boarding
accommodation.
This is not always the case. For many people, choosing a cattery or a
kennel for their beloved pet is a nightmare, especially if they have had
previous experience of their animal coming home skinny, filthy, and
fretful. In the absence of any objective guide or handbook, pet owners
are forced to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations and their own
personal inspections. For first-time boarders, this still means taking a
gamble.
Billy Steele, the former department veterinary surgeon for Glasgow
District Council, says there are no legal standards set for
animal-boarding operations in Britain. ''There is only a code of
practice set down by the British Veterinary Association,'' he says.
''When operators apply to the local authorities for licences a
veterinary surgeon visits and makes recommendations -- such as whether
the pen sizes should be increased -- and then revisits before the
licence is issued.''
The onus is on the operators to apply for licences. Finding out if the
cattery or kennel chosen is licensed is of prime importance, according
to Inspector Edward Ingram of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. Otherwise your pet could be subjected to far less
than desirable conditions.
''One man I prosecuted had converted his garage into a cattery. There
were 20 cages in there, and the conditions were appalling,'' says
Ingram. ''People must always go and have a look at the place for
themselves -- if the owners don't want you to then I'd suggest looking
for something else. There's nothing worse for a cat than being stuck in
a cage 18in square.''
In fact, cats should be housed in enclosures at least 4ft wide, 6ft
deep and 7ft high, with the same size of play area outside. An American
survey found that this amount of space prevented cats from getting
depressed and sickly. Cats like to be high up, so their baskets should
be on a shelf and if there is more than one cat from a household sharing
the same enclosure then the shelves should be a different levels so the
''dominant'' cat can sleep in a higher basket.
Cats should also be provided with their own litter box and scratching
pole, and at ground level the pens should be divided by an opaque
barrier to prevent cross-infections. It is according to these
specifications that Andy Hambley, owner of the Levernbank Cats Hotel,
has arranged chalets for his cats.
''There's always going to be a certain amount of stress for them being
away from home. We try to eliminate this as much as possible -- any vet
will tell you that stress will induce an illness in cats,'' he says.
''That's why we have the music going. They associate it with someone
home, and we leave a light on so they're not in total darkness
overnight.''
Dogs should be able to turn around in their pens without their ears or
tails brushing against the edges. Hambley says that dogs should also be
sorted according to size and volume.
A large, snapping, barking German shepherd might intimidate a little
Yorkie in the next pen; but it is fine to put a gentle, quiet Irish
wolfhound in an enclosure next to a small dog. There should be a larger
area where the dogs are exercised each day, and wide-gulley drainage to
carry away the dirt from daily cleaning.
He adds that it is essential for all animals to be vaccinated before
entering kennels. Rhinitus (the sneeze many cats suffer from) and kennel
cough (a deep cough dogs contract when in large numbers) are almost
impossible to eradicate, but vaccinations ensure that the animals don't
catch anything more serious.
If you decide to have your dog vaccinated for kennel cough with the
live vaccine called Intrac, Hambley advises to do it well before going
into the kennels, as dogs remain contagious after receiving the
vaccination.
''People should also check that the health insurance covers their pet
for a few days after they leave the kennels, as they may not show any
symptoms for a few days. We cover pets for three days afterwards, and if
the animal falls ill the owner only has to send us the vet's receipt,
and we will pay for it,'' he says. ''The other thing to look out for is
grooming -- not all places have grooming parlours, but they should have
grooming facilities so the dogs can have a bath before they go home.''
Cost is another consideration when selecting boarding accommodation.
Prices range from around #2.50 to #7.50 per night, with a standard
charge for cats and variable charges for dogs, according to their size.
Ingram says that as long as the pets are housed in reasonable comfort,
shelling out extra money is not going to make them happier.
''Comfort for the animal is top priority, but in the end they could be
sleeping in the same bed and eating the same food regardless of whether
you're paying #5 or #50.''
The alternative to boarding accommodation or leaving pets in the care
of friends is to take them with you on holiday; an option that
increasing numbers of people are taking up. Ingram says that hotels are
far more flexible these days.
PET LIKES AND DISLIKES: POINTS TO WATCH FOR
* Is the operation licensed?
* Do they cater for special diets?
* Are all the animals up to date with vaccinations?
* Are vets available on call for 24 hours?
* Is it hygienic -- how often are the pens cleaned, is there adequate
drainage, is there an offensive smell?
* Are the enclosures insulated, well-ventilated and heated in winter?
* Are there adequate play/exercise areas?
* Is the health insurance offered inclusive of a few days after they
leave the kennels?
* Are there grooming facilities?
* Is there someone available who can give injections to diabetic pets?
* What is the security like -- are there alarms and night-time
intercoms to monitor the enclosures?
* Do the animals themselves seem reasonably content?

THOUSANDS of hungry and scared Muslim refugees spent a night in the
open after victorious Bosnian Serb troops evicted them from the
Srebrenica enclave in a mass campaign of ''ethnic cleansing''.
Many had not eaten for at least a day and aid convoys had failed to
arrive by tonight.
Reporters estimated that about 10,000 refugees were huddled in and
around Tuzla's closed airport in government-held territory after being
herded on to buses and lorries by Serb soldiers and later made to walk
long distances across front lines.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that 14,000 refugees
had crossed into government-held territory by this afternoon and
thousands more were expected.
UN officials said Bosnian Serb forces had almost completely emptied
the Srebrenica enclave of Muslim refugees by nightfall, just two days
after its capture, in one of the largest and swiftest ethnic expulsions
of the three-year Bosnian war.
''The Dutch (peacekeepers) reckon 25,000 have been evacuated so far.
The Serbs have really been cracking on,'' said UN spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward. ''The scale of the operation has been
flabbergasting.''
Refugees arriving in territory held by the Bosnian Government alleged
that women had been raped, some men had been shot, and several thousand
men were detained in a football stadium in Serb-held Bratunac.
Independent verification of the reports was not possible.
However UN envoy Yasushi Akashi said: ''The attack upon and ethnic
cleansing of a United Nations safe area are abhorrent acts that have
justifiably earned the revulsion of the international community.''
Srebrenica was one of three UN-designated ''safe areas'' in eastern
Bosnia and the first to fall. The Bosnian Government has said it will
almost certainly ask UN peacekeeping troops to leave when their mandate
ends in November.
''I think the UN effort in Bosnia, at least in the context of
Unprofor, is finished,'' Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey told
the BBC.
French President Jacques Chirac demanded a limited UN military action
to protect the other Bosnian Government-held enclaves, but none of his
allies responded.
French Defence Minister Charles Millon will visit French troops in
Bosnia tomorrow.
''The British and the Americans must agree to put pressure with us on
the Serbs . . .
There can be no diplomacy without military pressure,'' Millon said.
''Nobody can tell me that Serbia is going to be allowed to govern
Europe.''
He said the French would press ahead with breaking the Serb siege of
Sarajevo by opening a land route over Mount Igman.
Also due to visit the former Yugoslavia tomorrow is European Union
peace envoy Carl Bildt, who is hoping to persuade Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade to recognise neighbouring Bosnia in
return for the lifting of international sanctions against Serbia.
Bildt urged Western countries not to withdraw their forces from
Bosnia, saying this would create a ''wider, longer, and more brutal
war''.
In Parliament, Prime Minister John Major defended his reluctance to
withdraw troops from Bosnia ''unless it became imperative to do so''. He
said their presence helped to prevent a wider Balkan war and had saved
countless lives.--Reuter.

IT doesn't take long to establish that this is a record company
showcase: a barrage of their employees and fellow music-biz types decked
out in standard-issue T-shirts and jackets advertising long-forgotten
Next Big Things are magnetised to the obligatory free bar.
It seems an unusual course for Merchant to steer at the start of her
career, stepping back towards the intimate surroundings that
characterised the earlier, pre-MTV stardom of 10,000 Maniacs.
In a surely awkward situation, Merchant maintains a studied dignity
amid a combination of polite disinterest and alcohol-induced
over-enthusiasm. However, there has been no diminishing of her undoubted
stellar qualities since the disintegration of the band that brought her
to prominence: Merchant remains an engaging and often mesmeric
performer, her voice soaring and at times achingly beautiful, her
on-stage movements those of one lost in her own music.
So why the cool response to Tigerlily (her solo album) and the failure
of her band to emulate the success of their kindred spirits REM? Last
night's show, albeit an abbreviated version of the full set she hopes to
return with in the autumn, provided many answers.
Her five cohorts are by combination long-haired and bare-footed, the
music too pallid and lacking in urgency to match the fire and vibrancy
of its writer, the songs too mannered to be truly memorable.
It works best on the most structured and poignant moments of Tigerlily
-- Wonder and Carnival and on the hair-let-down cover of Sympathy for
the Devil, and it flounders on the meandering and muso I May Know the
Word.
Merchant remains an awesome performer, but this performance suggests
another artistic cul-de-sac for a career which has long threatened to
produce megastardom.

WE have to report a slight hitch in the plan to make Glasgow a city
that never sleeps. We mentioned that a chap called Mark Norris had
opened an art gallery/cafe called Insomnia which would be open 24 hours
a day.
Insomnia, which is to be found in Woodlands Road near Charing Cross,
is the sort of place you might find in Greenwich Village, Amsterdam, or
Berlin. Bohemian in nature and a place for night owls to gather, have a
cup of coffee and a snack, and chat the night away.
The concept received a bit of a setback the other night when two
Glasgow polis turned up just after 11pm and informed Mr Norris that he
would have to close. The chaps were from the licensing police at the
local Stewart Street nick and they informed him that to sell coffee,
sandwiches, or bits of salad in Glasgow between 11pm and 5am you need a
licence.
This came as something of a surprise since Mr Norris had read the
relevant legislation and had consulted Strathclyde police HQ, the
licensing department at Glasgow City Council, and even the
procurator-fiscal who apparently has a locus in the great debate over
whether Glaswegians can stay out after 11pm of an evening and buy a cup
of coffee.
A stunned Mr Norris told the Diary: ''Glasgow is claiming that it
wants to be a cosmopolitan city but doesn't have the balls to do it. The
law on whether you can sell a cup of tea or coffee after 11pm appears to
be a bit hazy with different police offices giving me different
advice.''
Without wishing to offend the licensing coppers, with whom he is
trying establish a working relationship, he ponders on why the polis
should be involved at all in controlling where and when a citizen should
want to have a late-night coffee. ''There is a demand for a 24-hour
cafe. It's not as if I'm running a loud disco with drink flowing at all
hours. We have security staff on late at night.''
Mr Norris plans to keep Insomnia open 24 hours but as an art gallery.
Customers can buy a signed photocopy of a drawing of a cup of cappuccino
and will then receive a free cup of coffee. This, he hopes, is legal.
Hungry insomniacs can pop next door to the adjacent deli and buy a
sandwich. They then must walk out on to the pavement and back into the
cafe where they can eat the sandwich.
''It's a bit like prohibition in the USA in the 1920s with coffee
banned instead of alcohol,'' said the patron, one of whose previous
ventures was running a restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia.
Herald reader Duich McKay who lives near the cafe faxed the Diary with
his protest: ''After leaving my local pub, the Halt on Woodlands Road,
at 11.25pm I went down the road to the newly-opened diner, Insomnia,
where I had already had an enjoyable meal. The service was good, the
fresh, imaginative menu gave me a cheap, filling evening meal. I looked
forward to more of the same in a city almost completely lacking in such
facilities.''
Only to find that the licensing police had struck. ''Can I protest
with an empty stomach,'' said Mr McKay, ''against the stupid, arcane
laws that govern the city's restaurants? If I want to eat at 2am or 6pm
or whenever, I should be allowed to -- just as I would be able to in any
city I have ever visited in Europe, North Africa, or the United
States.''
We feel there should be more debate on this Cappuccino Controversy.
Imitating life
MEANWHILE, the dear green place, in pursuit of its image as a city of
the arts, has a new festival called The Streets of Glasgow. It is to be
an annual ''outdoor theatre festival'' heavily funded by our local
authorities and begins on August 19.
It opens with an event called The Coming which is described as: ''Nine
extraordinary tribes will emerge in and around Glasgow. Fifty irascible
tattoo-faced, food-bearing Nomads in the East End encountering 25
screaming Diatribes. The adrenalin-driven Pole Tribe will drag their
percussive chariots through shopping centres seeking impossibly
dangerous heights to perform their wailing horn chant, trying to avoid
the hordes of scavenging Mechanix on their motorised Gobbler . . .''
There is more about the Elvis tribe and the half-human, half-fish
Harland O'Wolffs newly returned from the wreck of the Titanic. We fear
the organisers may have had one Cappuccino too many.
Chit chat
OVERHEARD in Glasgow Central Station, a young man attempting with
little success to chat up a young lady. He asked ''So, do you fancy
going out tonight, then?''
''I'd rather take a train to Largs,'' came the topical reply.
Ayr we go again
CONCLUDING our Auld Alliance series is this tale from John Quinn of
Lenzie about a young French person's predicament in the Ayrshire hamlet
of Stevenston. Jean-Paul, an exchange student out on a day trip to Largs
somehow found himself alone in the unmanned Stevenston railway station.
The place was deserted and without timetables or destination boards,
so the enterprising student went to find help. Immediately outside the
station there stood a bus shelter, complete with wee local wumman and
three weans.
''Excuse me, Madame,'' said our Jean-Paul in his strong French accent,
''can I get a train from here to Largs?'' The woman eyed him up
suspiciously from head to toe then, drawing her weans to her skirt, she
replied in a thick Ayrshire accent with a wary edge: ''Son, this is a
bus stoap!''
* THE names of all contributors to the Auld Alliance debate will be
placed today in a suitable Bastille Day-style receptacle and the winners
of the many amazing prizes will be drawn. Results on Tuesday. Merci.

John Fowler visits the latest circulation battleground where the
established local paper is being challenged by a colourful new contender
SCOTLAND'S newest newspaper baron is short, stout and cuddly, aged
sixtyish, and he wears tartan braces. His empire may not be on the
Rupert Murdoch scale but it's creating a stir in the corner of central
Scotland familiarly known as the Wee County. In the quiet towns and
villages of Clackmannanshire a fight for circulation is being waged.
Graham McMurdo says he's well pleased with the launch of his cheeky
weekly tabloid, the Wee County News (''adding colour to
Clackmannanshire'') which first hit the streets in Alloa, Clackmannan
and the townships under the Ochil hills six weeks ago and has already
established a healthy toehold in the market, now selling more than 5000
copies weekly.
My village newsagent tells me that all 75 copies were sold out last
week. This week he has increased the order to 90. He was a little cagey
when I asked him if the Wee County News had affected sales of its
established rival, the twice-weekly Alloa Advertiser. ''Oh, I think it's
bound to have some effect,'' he said warily.
McMurdo says that the spur to start a new paper came from local
business people, and that raising the necessary #100,000 among them was
''relatively easy'' (his contacts in the Rotary Club proved useful).
''I've got a 15% stake myself, so I'm not asking people to put up the
money without risking my own. He has installed the latest equipment --
pages are sent by direct line to the printers in the North of England in
a matter of minutes, and the edition is brought up to Alloa overnight by
van.
These days, optimism is pretty rare in the newspaper business but
Graham McMurdo cheerily looks forward to success as a mini tycoon in the
not too distant future. ''I think we should break even in about eight
months,'' he says in his bright office in Mar Street, Alloa.
He has a staff of 17, including five journalists led by his editor
David Bytheway, a former Daily Record man with clear views about Wee
County News readership: ''The people who read the Sun or the Record and
watch TV.''
Bytheway says that when he was approached by McMurdo the prospect of
creating a bright newsy paper instantly appealed to him. ''I liked the
idea of producing a tabloid in colour, using the latest technology, and
being able to style it from day one.'' He agreed to take it on, at least
for the first six months, until it was established.
They share a mutual respect. ''I don't want to exercise proprietor's
rights,'' says McMurdo. ''We had a blazing row on day two,'' says
Bytheway, but that only cleared the air.
Finding a balance between parish pump topics and the gutsy news
stories that are the lifeblood of tabloid journalism is tricky. A recent
front page was a news editor's dream -- a picture of a blazing car (in
colour, of course) and the headline ''Safe from the flames'' shared
space with a report on how doctors saved the almost severed hand of a
local man injured after his microlight plane crash-landed.
The blaze story was right up to the minute. ''We had the picture at
four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon and the paper was in the shops on
Thursday morning,'' says McMurdo proudly, suggesting that a daily paper
couldn't have done better.
The current edition can't quite match that double whammy (no
big-impact picture, for a start) but there's a good controversial topic,
a threat to the education of children with special needs in Central
region, as the lead story.
At the back of the paper -- ''32 pages for 32 pence'' -- are ''Six Big
Pages of Sport'', and inside is a mixture of local titbits, regular
features and current issues, including colour spreads. ''Blooming
Wonderful'' says the headline over a report on the district council's
garden nursery at Menstrie, and the feature starts in best breathless
tabloid style: ''Keeping the Wee County ablaze with colour all year
round is bloomin' difficult.''
McMurdo, a family man who lives in Sauchie, just outside Alloa, has a
track record in local newspaper management, having started a paper in
Dumfriesshire and then worked for 12 years as commercial manager for the
Alloa Advertiser. After the Advertiser changed hands three years ago,
McMurdo fell out with the new owner and decided to quit.
In the good old days four weekly newspapers were circulating in the
area, but times are harder now. ''I don't know whether two papers can
survive in this area,'' he reflects, ''but this one will.'' And he
admits warily that if the Wee County News makes good he may consider
extending his empire.
His parting shot: ''I've a lot of faith in what I'm doing.''

WHATEVER the problems of devolution, empirically speaking, the status
quo is becoming less of an option. At successive elections the people of
Scotland have expressed a will for constitutional change. No democratic
system or political party can ignore this forever.
Recent opinion polls published in The Herald indicate that about 80%
of respondents express a preference for some form of Scottish autonomy.
There is also evidence that in England, an increasing number of people
are becoming aware of the Scottish case. All of which makes one wonder
if the Government's ''stocktaking exercise'' has extended beyond
Conservative Party headquarters. It is not in the interests of the
British political system to marginalise a clear desire for
constitutional change.
Anti-devolutionists believe that as Britain is a unitary state, any
constitutional alteration to the status quo would tend to dissolve it.
The Government has campaigned vociferously on the argument that any
mention of change represents a threat to the UK. The ''democratisation
of Scotland debate'' is really a wolf in sheep's clothing, disguising
the beginning of the end of the Union. Issues, like the West Lothian
Question, are examples of the insoluble nature of the problem.
A look at our European neighbours, particularly Spain and Germany,
provides evidence of decentralised systems adapted to the needs of the
people. Both of these systems have the added advantage of potentially
economic advantageous ties directly between the region and Europe.
A federal system similar to that in Germany would, for example, answer
the West Lothian Question because it proposes equal power parliaments
for all UK regions, with residual responsibilities left at Westminster.
A Federal Constitution has been the frame for the rebuilding of
democracy, and regional government has gone hand-in-hand with Europe's
strongest economy.
In terms of policy there is, for example, no national education
policy; policy is decided by each regional or Lander Parliament.
Bavarian votes cannot decide education policy for the Saarland, or vice
versa. There is no West Lothian issue.
Would this work in the United Kingdom? From a UK perspective, the
problem with the German model is that it has strong regional identities.
In the UK, Scottish and Welsh identity is not in doubt, but to what
degree can this sense of identity be found at regional level in England?
Some parts of England may be perceptibly regional -- for example the
North-east -- but unlike Germany, the same cannot be said everywhere.
Where does the identity of West and East Midlands begin and end?
This poses a significant problem for a UK federal system. In essence,
differing parts of the United Kingdom want differing amounts of
autonomy. How can the system be adapted to deal with the very real
desires of the British people? Is it possible that some of these
problems could be answered by a ''variable geometry approach''?
A look at the Spanish system shows some of its merits. In Spain, the
West Lothian Question or the Spanish equivalent, the Catalonian
question, is accommodated within a decentralised system of Spanish
Autonomous Regions.
Spain, like the UK, is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral
parliament. However, unlike the UK, in 1978 after the centralisation of
the Franco years, it became a decentralised, unitary state. There are 17
autonomous communities, which are essentially regional authorities
having political autonomy, legislative powers, and their own governing
bodies. The Spanish Constitution sets down which are the autonomous
regions and where the boundaries lie.
Article No. 2 of the Spanish Constitution sets out the basic
principles of the model. The idea is based on the indissoluble unity of
the Spanish nation, while recognising and guaranteeing the right to self
government of its people and regions, at the same time acknowledging a
solidarity among them.
The constitution also outlines the policy areas over which there will
be central control -- for example foreign and defence policy -- but
outwith a number of these key defined areas, all other matters are the
responsibility of the autonomous regions.
The regions are not obliged to exert all of these powers. They can
choose to accept them or to allow them to continue to be exercised by
Madrid. For example Catalonia has taken up the right to legislate for
education but Castille has not. Thus education policy for Castille is
decided by the Central Government. Certain basic standards are set down
by the Central Government in that everyone has the right to attend
school from 14 to 18-years-old, but outwith these essential citizens'
rights, the flexibility to take control of policy or not rests with the
region.
This brings us to the key question of voting rights. In the national
parliament, all members of the Cortes (the Spanish parliament) have the
same voting rights, no matter which region they come from or whether
that region has opted for regional or central control.
This flexible approach reflects reality, strength of identity, and
local preferences, but within one sovereign state. Any inconvenience of
the system is far outweighed by the bitterness left in Spanish mouths by
Franco's centralist, unitary state. Democracy and devolution came
together and remain together in Spain.
While the Spanish approach, lock, stock, and barrel may not be the
full answer to the British question, nevertheless the ''variable
geometry approach'' begins to address some of the obstacles being placed
in the way of the clear will of the Scottish people. English regions
could choose the degree of autonomy they desire, as indeed could the
Scots.
Whatever the choice, all members returned to the Westminster
Parliament would have the same voting rights. If the Catalonian question
can be resolved in Spain, surely we are not beyond implementing a system
with a measure of constitutional flexibility, which would take account
of the wishes of the Scottish people.
The status quo is no longer a credible option.

IT sounds magic. Scotland with the same status as
Mecklenburg-Vorderpommern, the well-known German Land! A seat at the
Euro-table, feet under the Euro-carpet, Euro-jobs for the boys,
Euro-subsidies! These and a shower of other goodies are promised us from
Labour's plans for devolution, as revealed to the party's MEPs by Robin
Cook, the Shadow Foreign Secretary.
No wonder they were bemused: ''I think most of us failed to grasp, or
just missed, what all of this could mean,'' one said. As most by now
presumably know their way round Brussels, they will be yet more puzzled
when they have time to think about it.
In fact, no sub-national unit, no Land, region or province, has any
power at the European level. They can represent their views and
interests in the Council of the Regions and other forums. They are
listened to, along with a range of pressure groups, trade associations
and anybody else who may be a party to policies dealt with in Brussels.
In certain circumstances they can actually deliver a formal opinion on
proposals from the European Commission. But they cannot decide anything.
Nor can a British Government, even a future Labour Government, grant
Scotland any power to decide. The European Union is an association,
bound by treaty, of independent sovereign states. In important respects,
where they agree only to act unanimously, they are equal: they will not
move unless they all move at once. In lesser matters, where they agree
to act by qualified majority voting, they can overrule a minority.
But none of the member countries is entitled to devolve its voting
strength to a part of itself. Nor is it at all likely that any of the
other members would let Britain do that unilaterally. Where would it
end: with Mecklenburg-Vorderpommern voting against the German Federal
Government? This is nonsense.
However many votes a country has, they are cast as a bloc. Of course,
a country can appoint who it likes to the delegations in the Council of
Ministers where votes are cast. I doubt if a Minister from
Mecklenburg-Vorderpommern has ever graced the German delegations, but
ministers from St Andrew's House do join the British delegations and
speak in debates. This usually happens when there is at stake a matter
of importance to Scotland, most often in agriculture and fisheries, but
also in other things. They are there, however, to put across the British
point of view, which will have been drawn up with Scotland in mind,
though not necessarily only with Scotland in mind.
Things would have to stay that way even if there was devolution in
Scotland. Devolution would not make Scotland sovereign. Scotland would
not be an independent member of the European Union, and would have no
separate vote in the Council of Ministers. There could be no question of
a Scottish delegation ''answering to the Scottish Parliament and a
Scottish European Minister,'' as Cook has apparently promised.
It simply could not work, least of all if governments in Edinburgh and
London happened to be of different complexions. While Scotland is part
of the United Kingdom, the Government in London must continue to cast
its vote on Scotland's behalf.
Under Labour's plans for devolution, Scotland's European status would,
in fact, remain exactly the same as it is now. Of course, that status
would change if Scotland became a separate, fully-independent member
country. That is a different argument and, whatever one thinks of it, at
least an honest one. To talk of ''Euro-power for Labour's Scottish
parliament'' is dishonest.

* Catherine McAuley, the foundress of the Sisters of Mercy, was born
to a wealthy Dublin family in 1778. Her father died when she was five
and her mother when she was 20.
Catherine was adopted by a wealthy couple who left her with a
beautiful house and a small fortune after their deaths.
Catherine opened the first House of Mercy in Dublin in 1831. Its work
was to protect women, teach children, start up schools and hospitals,
and of course help the homeless. Now there are Mercy convents right
across Britain.
Catherine McAuley died in 1841. It was often said about Catherine
McAuley that she had a great need to give to others what she had been
deprived of as a young child -- the care of a loving parent.
YOU might think there is nothing remarkable about nuns who give food
to the homeless. Isn't that what nuns are supposed to do? Look out for
the poor and needy? True. But when you have tramped the streets year in,
year out, slept on cold pavement slabs in hail, snow, wind, and rain --
to have someone invite you into a warm house, sit you down at a table,
and summon a waiter to bring you a hot meal -- that is remarkable beyond
belief.
This is what happens morning and evening at St Catherine's Convent in
Lauriston Gardens, Edinburgh.
The idea was born one bitterly cold evening just more than a year ago
on March 5, 1994. Sister Aelred, Mother Superior of the Sisters of
Mercy, was in the kitchen as usual making sandwiches and soup for the
homeless who regularly called at the door. Sister Aelred, a
down-to-earth, kindly, no-nonsense sort of nun, turned to the person
helping her and uttered her now famous words: ''Wouldn't it be much
better if we could invite the homeless in and give them a proper meal at
a table? Do you think maybe we should try it?''
Her helper nodded. Together they prepared their small dining-room for
the men outside. They put on the fire, laid the table, and then invited
the five homeless men in out of the cold and fed them what remained of
their own dinner. On the following evening there were 10 men at the door
and it wasn't long before the sisters were laying four long tables every
evening.
A year later they give breakfast to 100 homeless people each morning
and dinner to about 80.
The men and women who flock to St Catherine's appear somewhat at odds
with their surroundings at first. Most of them are aimless, rootless,
and loveless. Born victims if you like; born into families where alcohol
and abuse have been the norm, born into a never-ending cycle of despair
and homelessness.
All of those who come to St Catherine's have suffered in some way at
the hands of other adults. To these homeless drifters the human race has
shown a rather cruel face, a hard, brutal, and very cold shoulder.
Clients range from the long-term homeless who sleep rough or stay in
hostels to old-age pensioners who need company. The convent library has
been adapted into a dining-room with hot-plate and boiler at the ready.
Next door showers and toilets have been installed. There is also a
kitchen. The project is staffed entirely by volunteers -- four volunteer
chefs and 80 helpers of all denominations and all walks of life.
Some of the homeless have been so brutalised by life that they can be
anti-social at first. They lack self-confidence. Some feel such a
terrible self-loathing that they mutilate themselves. Jean is such a
person. She used to inflict pain on herself by cutting her wrists with a
razor. She first came to St Catherine's seven months ago: desperate,
drunk, filthy, hungry, and destitute.
Jean's only childhood memory is of her father taking her, frightened
and bewildered, to a quiet room at the top of the house. At first the
way he touched Jean left her more confused than alarmed. It didn't seem
right, although he said it was just a game.
''One day he suggested a new game,'' Jean recalled. ''A game which I
had to keep secret at all costs. My father hurt me badly. I never
understood what was going on. I just saw him as someone who was there to
inflict pain on me. When he'd finish, I felt sick and dirty. Of course,
I now know that my father raped me for eight, long years.
''My father had a trick. He knew how to make me keep our secret. Every
time he took me up to the room he'd open the window and make me sit out
on the ledge so I could see the streets three storeys below. I was only
seven and too terrified even to scream. He'd ask whether I wanted to
know how far it was to jump to the street below. In the next breath he'd
say he loved me more than anything else in the world. He'd say it was
good to have secrets with someone you loved. I was seven the first time
it happened and 14 the last.
''One night I had a nightmare. I dreamt my father was planning to let
go of me at the window. I woke up in such a state, sweating and shaking.
That was it. I left that night, I'd had enough.''
Jean lived on the streets, just another teenage runaway, forming her
own makeshift sub-culture wherever she went. She scavenged in dustbins
for food, learning a ruthless code of survival. She'd do anything to
avoid the police picking her up.
The last thing Jean wanted was to be taken into care. By day she slept
with strangers, reasoning that she'd done it for years with her father
and at least this way she could earn money. By night Jean would walk the
streets of Edinburgh, occasionally until morning. She'd either sleep
rough with other young people, forced to fight over a blanket or a patch
of ground under a warm air-duct outside one of the big hotels. She grew
used to sneaking about like a thief, learning to trust no-one and having
no-one trust her.
She has spent years on the street drunk, and years in hostels drunk --
places where they warehouse the poor. The sad truth is that nobody has
ever wanted to know her.
That all changed, however, when Jean came to St Catherine's. At the
age of 32 she began to make friends for the first time in her life.
The night I visited for a meal, the dining-room at St Catherine's had
a light atmosphere. At about 6pm I heard footsteps on the gravel outside
-- homeless people arriving at the front door. They walked slowly and
purposefully, their faces lined and serious at first, their clothes
down-at-heel, their shoes torn and tattered from journeying.
The men I sat with all had similar stories to tell. Most had turned to
drink when they faced problems at home. Then they lost their jobs, their
families, their homes. They were left with no possessions and no roof
over their heads.
On the street now they no longer feel fully human. By that they mean
they have no life to speak of; no real relationships, no comforts. The
men couldn't remember when they had last been to the cinema, eaten out
in a restaurant, or bought new clothes. They all said the temptation to
drink on the streets was overwhelming. Drink brought oblivion -- a way
of facing what lay ahead.
They had all found something at St Catherine's, whether it was meeting
other homeless people, being treated with such respect, or the hot
meals, none of them really knew. Sitting in a dining-room with others
like themselves meant that even the most lonely, inadequate people among
them could make some headway.
At St Catherine's, they all say, there is no notion of us and them.
They feel responsible for once, accountable even. If for example a
homeless person hasn't been in for a meal they'll make inquiries. For
the first time in years these men have built up relationships with
people who understand them.
One man, aged about 47, said he had found St Catherine's daunting at
first. For a start, he hadn't sat at a table for years, let alone have
somebody serve him a meal. He thought the Sisters of Mercy were
''brilliant'', that they never tried to ''stuff religion down your
throat with their curry''. Eating at a table, some of them felt, was a
sort of gesture of defiance against a world which kept rejecting them, a
way of building up self-esteem, of regaining some control over their
lives.
Another man called Joe, of about 50, has spent 20 years as a vagrant
in Glasgow and Edinburgh. As he ate his curry he said: ''I'll never
forget the first time I came to this convent. They let me have a bath, a
shave, and a change of clothing, followed by a hot meal and a long chat.
It was the most enjoyable night I'd had in years. They never say to
people you need a wash. They just ask you if you want one.
''The best bit, however, was when I came back the next day and Sister
Aelred said 'it's nice to see you again'. Nobody had said that to me for
years, apart from the police and they were only being facetious. I
couldn't believe this nun had remembered me, let alone was asking me
back.
''It really restored my faith in humanity. It gave me back my
self-respect as well. After that, whenever I rang the bell I was always
invited in and whenever I left I was always invited back. I started
thinking 'well, maybe I'm not such a bad person after all'.
''You see -- if you're treated like an animal you start acting like
one. That's the trouble with being homeless. The fact is there are all
kinds of people living on the street, some of them very well educated.
I've been on the streets for years. I'm an alcoholic. I found it so easy
to start drinking but practically impossible to stop.
''I think about 99% of homeless people are on drugs or drink. There's
such a stigma attached to being homeless. When I was at the bottom of
the heap, in the gutter, nobody wanted to know me and, quite frankly, I
didn't want to know them either. You forget what it's like to be human.
You just go through the motions -- eating, sleeping, going about your
business.
''When I didn't have any drink the only people I wanted to see was the
girl at the DSS, the girl at the Post Office, and the girl in the
off-licence -- and in that order. It's so hard to pull yourself up once
you've sunk right down into the depths.
''When I first came to St Catherine's it was just to get something to
eat. I'd been told you sat at a table and somebody served you. I'd heard
you could meet people and make friends. I was terrified at first. It was
weird. I hadn't sat at a table for so long and I felt out of place. But
when I looked around the room, I knew immediately I was at home in a
sense because the others were people just like myself.''
Like the homeless, the helpers come from all over Edinburgh. They help
serve meals but more importantly their main task is to provide a warm
welcome.
Ann has been a helper since the night the project began. She said:
''Very occasionally someone might come in drunk but it doesn't happen
often and they're always full of remorse afterwards.
''We try to help people feel supported and we make a point of telling
them about ourselves. They know all about my family, for example. And if
I ever meet them out on the streets of Edinburgh I always stop and talk
to them. Even if I were walking along with the Queen, I'd stop and talk
to them.''
Brother Kentigern is another helper. From the Episcopalian Franciscans
he volunteered to help with the project in keeping with the Franciscan
ethos of being alongside the poor.
He said: ''Years ago wayfarers were not unusual. Then it was a way of
life. Now, unfortunately, the most vulnerable people in our society seem
to end up on the street: people with mental-health problems, teenagers
who've been chucked out of their homes, who have no money -- all the
people nobody wants.
''I think there is a cold assumption in the nineties that we should
all be able to cope with whatever life throws at us. The fact is that a
lot of people are extremely vulnerable.
''On the other hand, you can't afford to be sentimental about the
homeless. Some people on the street want to grab as much as they can but
they are no different from the rich banker who's also out to get as much
as he can. There are mature ways of giving to the homeless like becoming
involved with them, and there are immature ways like throwing money at
the problem in the hope that it will go away.''
Sister Aelred said: ''We made a decision as a community to give over
part of our house to this project. We're open each morning from nine to
12.30 for brunch and in the evening from 6.15 until the food runs out.
''These people are all hurting. The homeless have a very poor
self-image and we have to affirm them, give them dignity as well as
food. Sadly, 13 have died in the past year. If somebody is ill we'll
contact their family but if there's no family we'll go to the hospital
to be with them.''
How does Sister Aelred view the idea endemic in society that so many
beggars are out to con people? Sister Aelred thought for a moment, then
said: ''Our founder, Catherine McAuley said 'make hospitality your
special aim and if you think you have 99 impostors don't turn them away
because you could have one deserving person'.''

#30,000 annually and they depend on donations. If you can help please

A REPORT published last month by the pro-Labour Institute for Public
Policy Research rubbished Labour's devolution policy as it relates to
Europe, by making the obvious point: ''European institutions remain
based on the nation state.''
Pretending that we are a ''region'', as Labour propose, is no way to
empower the nation of Scotland. Scotland can only ensure that the
European Union works in our interests by being present at every single
meeting of the Council of Ministers, as a decision maker -- not an
observer.
Labour's policy document shows that devolution makes no more sense for
Scotland in a European context than it does in a Scottish one.
Labour's analogy with the German Lander is totally spurious, for two
principal reasons. First, in order to work, the Lander model requires a
federal constitution -- which Labour oppose for the UK. German
federalism simply doesn't apply to a nation like Scotland within a state
such as the UK.
Secondly, the European rights of the 16 Lander are collective, being
exercised by the federal Upper House, and do not relate to any
individual Land. Transferred to the UK, this would mean no special voice
for Scotland. Logically, we would be ''represented'' by some kind of
reformed House of Lords.
In any event, the Lander -- even on a collective basis -- have no
voice in key areas. When I asked German Euro-MPs about fishing, for
example, they were emphatic that this is not a matter for the Lander.
With Labour's devolution scheme, we would still have the absurd
situation of Luxembourg -- without an inch of coastline -- having more
say over fishing policy than Scotland does.
This powerlessness would apply across the board, effectively shutting
Scotland out of European decision-making -- the most important aspect of
which is the Council of Ministers.
Maximising Scottish representation requires Scotland taking her place
alongside the other small European Union member states. As it is, 10 out
of the 15 EU members are small nations.
The advantages of independent membership for small nations are not in
dispute. Sweden, Austria and Finland have all been convinced of the
benefits. The economic prospects of Ireland have been transformed by her
membership, and the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium are important
players on the European scene.
In trying to devise an alternative to the first-class status of
Independence in Europe, Labour is proposing a scheme that is both
second-rate and a nonsense. It is nothing but a con-trick, designed to
pull the wool over the eyes of Scottish voters.
Anyone who knows anything about how the EU works knows that the
promise of a ''European office'' is a hollow one. There are literally
thousands of lobbying offices in Brussels. Under Labour's plan, Scotland
would take her proud place alongside the Federation of European Aerosol
Producers and the International Butchers Federation.
What Scotland needs is not an office, but a seat at the top table
alongside comparable European nations.
* Dr Allan Macartney is SNP vice-president and Euro-MP for North East
Scotland.

Driven to strike action: Roy Rogers explains how British Rail
misjudged the mood of their drivers
BR DRIVERS, who have not been involved in a major dispute since the
''flexible rostering'' row of 13 years ago, have been on course for a
showdown over pay ever since restructuring talks broke down in 1992.
Their feeling of anger increased last year when they were forced to
accept a 2.5% annual settlement only to see BR signalworkers go on to
win an 8.7% restructuring package through their campaign of summer
stoppages.
Lew Adams, who was new to the Aslef general secretaryship last year,
took notice when he and the eight-man executive were censured by the
union's annual delegate conference for accepting the 2.5%.
Acutely aware that this was likely to be the final year of central
negotiations before bargaining is devolved to 25 train-operating
companies as privatisation looms ever closer, a demand for a
''substantial percentage increase over and above inflation'' was lodged
with BR early this year.
As Herald readers were informed as long ago as February, a referendum
was carried out among the 12,000 BR drivers even before BR made its
initial offer in order to ascertain whether they would be prepared to to
take industrial action if necessary to back the demand. The result was
an overwhelming yes.
Torn between breaching the Government's 3% ceiling on public-sector
pay deals and risking a confrontation that might derail privatisation,
BR -- almost certainly with Government approval -- chose the latter
path.
Restricted to a below-inflation 3% offer, Aslef negotiators had no
choice but to call a strike ballot in line with assurances given at its
annual delegate conference. A hugely impressive turnout of 72.8% -- most
postal ballots attract turnouts of around 25% -- voted over 60% in
favour of a series of six one-day stoppages the first of which is today.
BR gambled that members of the main rail union, the Rail Maritime and
Transport union (RMT), would not be keen to join industrial action so
soon after their stressful signalworkers' dispute and that this would
leave the Aslef drivers isolated and only too eager to get off the hook
by accepting the face-saving concept of possible bonus payments in a
year's time.
BR was right on the first score, RMT members did in the main reject
strike action, but completely misjudged the situation as far as Aslef
was concerned.
Aslef's grievances are varied and apparently valid. The union
maintains that drivers have co-operated in improving productivity with
some 1200 jobs going over the past year. Yet, despite Government
insistence that self-financing pay awards are allowable, their reward
was to be held back to a below-inflation increase yet again.
Not so the top management who have enjoyed performance bonuses of 20%
or more with the recently retired chairman Sir Bob Reid walking off with
a #77,000 bonus equivalent to 60% of his salary.
These performance payments coincided with a reported #362m BR profit
last year -- which BR emphasised was a paper profit made possible only
because Government subsidy was doubled to #2 billion to ease the path to
privatisation.
Train drivers have every right to be sceptical and argue that either
the industry has improved its performance in which case the proceeds
should be shared by all employees or it has not in which case no-one
should be entitled to performance bonuses.
They currently receive a basic salary of #11,227 -- which compares to
#23,929 on London Underground, #15,014 on the Tyne Metro, and #20,910
for those running Eurostar trains through the Channel Tunnel -- although
allowances, nine hours a week average overtime, and rest-day working
take earnings up to about #21,500.
Restructuring of drivers' pay is long overdue and BR has decided that
this should be the province of the new train-operating companies as they
will have differing requirements. In fact, preliminary talks had got
under way with several of the operating companies only to be vetoed by
BR which appears to believe that privatising operations with drivers on
a basic of #215 a week might be easier than if drivers were on a salary
approaching #22,000.
The series of one-day stoppages, which will each cost BR over #10m in
lost revenue, is due to take the dispute through to mid-September
although BR is expected to mount a ''return to work'' campaign along the
lines of the one that had a limited success during last summer's
signalworkers' dispute.
It is difficult to see investors queuing up to buy rail franchises
while services face major disruption and a prolonged dispute could
persuade some of the operating companies to break ranks, possibly even
with the tacit approval of BR and the Government, to conclude
restructuring packages to keep their privatisation on track.
One thing is for sure: no matter what the outcome of the present
dispute, Aslef will be presenting the operating companies with a Charter
of Objectives aimed at improving drivers' status, pay, and conditions.
Drawn up by delegates to last month's annual conference, the charter
includes: a ''substantial'' increase in basic rates; a basic salary set
at no less than current earnings; no compulsory redundancies or job
losses; the introduction of a 35-hour week; and the elimination of
rest-day and overtime working.
As today's stoppage will demonstrate, train drivers are one of the few
groups of workers who still have industrial muscle. That will not
decrease when negotiations are devolved fully to the train-operating
companies and could strengthen as individial companies will be more
vulnerable to industrial action.
We could be hearing a lot more of the quietly spoken Mr Adams in the
weeks and months to come.

AN OBSCURE word absent from many of our dictionaries, plucked from the
relatively arcane vocabulary of Roman Catholic theology, has become a
watchword which has propelled European citizens down a federal path.
Subsidiarity means simply that decisions should be taken at the most
local level appropriate. But as a concept it was pushed up the political
agenda by Jacques Delors during his European presidency, and as a result
the Labour Party has found itself promising Scotland direct power in
Europe in a way which may have caught some of its own supporters by
surprise.
Indeed, it can be argued that in the quirkily consensual world of
anti-Tory politics north of the Border, on the issue of European
representation, Labour has pressed ahead of its London headquarters as
it has done on other issues, such as proportional representation and
gender equality. In another time, another place, the Scottish
Constitutional Convention would have been known as a Lib-Lab pact.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson pointed out yesterday that
no-one should be surprised about how far down the road towards a large
degree of autonomous representation for Scotland in Europe his party has
gone. It has been a well sign-posted journey which the Scottish Labour
Party has embarked on and dates back to before the 1992 General
Election.
''It arose from discussions within the Scottish Constitutional
Convention,'' said Mr Robertson yesterday. ''There are between 40 and 50
UK representative offices already operating in Brussels, covering local
authorities, business organisations, Government offices and so on, and
this policy flows from that.''
He pointed out that since the Maastricht Treaty, three different
strands of pressure had come together. One was that new buzz word of
subsidiarity, the second was the growth in power of the Committee of the
Regions, and the third was the increasing tendency for organisations to
begin to lobby European institutions direct.
But Labour's policy proposals were already beginning to go beyond
simple lobbying. Mr Robertson first floated them in January and although
the suggestion of similar status to the federal German Lander was
explicitly stated, this received more coverage in Scotland than in
London.
When the full policy was published as part of A Parliament for
Scotland -- Labour's Plan, its European dimension was regarded north of
the Border as unexceptional and was passed at the party's conference at
Inverness in March without comment. Other issues, such as tax-raising
powers and gender equality, were regarded as far more contentious.
When Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook arrived in Strasbourg this
week to discuss the plans he was clearly taken aback by the level of
surprise at how far-reaching they were. And yet the document had stated
baldly, all along: ''A Scottish Parliament will seek maximum
representation within Europe.
''And as part of Scotland's evolving role in Europe, we will also
establish a Scottish European Office in Brussels which will serve as
Scotland's official point of contact with the EU.
''This will be a major government office staffed by civil servants,
accountable to the Scottish Parliament, and capable of making direct
representations on its behalf to EU institutions. As such, it will be
much more than a lobbying organisation, although lobbying would be an
important part of its work.''
This is in keeping with the convention's demand: ''The Scottish
Parliament would, as an immediate priority, establish a representative
office in Brussels to put clearly and directly Scottish interests.
Scotland must also have representation throughout the Scottish
Parliament on UK ministerial delegations to the Council of Ministers.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrats had a major input to this, but it is in
many ways easier for them as a party seeking federal solutions to
constitutional issues both within Britain and in Europe.
Their influence within the convention can be seen as gently pulling
Labour towards a federalist standpoint, although this is denied by Keir
Hardie House in Glasgow and resented by John Smith House in London.
In spite of misgivings in London -- not to mention Paris and Madrid --
the drift towards subsidiarity accelerated after Maastricht. Propelled
by the German government, under pressure from its Lander, Article 146 of
the Maastricht Treaty enshrined the right of component parts of member
states to be recognised as representatives of those states.
The proviso was that the member state itself had to sanction this.
''It was not a ringing declaration, but at least it was a foot in the
door,'' said Dr Robert Lane of the Europa Institute at Edinburgh
University. It enabled such representation but did not guarantee it.
''It was good for the likes of Scotland and Wales,'' said Dr Lane,
''but at the end of the day the power still resided at Westminster.''

LABOUR last night stepped up the pressure on the Government in the row
over inheritance tax and capital gains tax.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown renewed his claim that there was a deep
split on the issue between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, but
both Downing Street and the Treasury heavily played down his
allegations.
Labour's point is that Mr Major has announced that his objective is to
reduce capital gains and inheritance taxes and, if possible, abolish
them.
The Opposition says this is a ''priority'' for the Prime Minister, but
the Government's line is that it is taking a long-term view of the
matter and will get rid of the taxes only as and when it can afford to
do so.
Mr Brown said yesterday that the rich would benefit from any such
change, and he argued that it should not be a priority for any
government. On inheritance tax, he said that half the benefit would go
to just 2000 estates, with a #700m gain at an average of #350,000 each.
On capital gains, he has calculated that 2500 individuals and trusts,
with gains of more than #250,000 each, would enjoy 55% of the benefit.
The issue, first raised during a Commons debate on the economy on
Wednesday, resurfaced yesterday at both Treasury Questions and Prime
Minister's Question Time.
At Treasury Questions, Mr Brown demanded of Mr Clarke: ''Do you
support the principle of abolishing inheritance tax and capital gains
tax? Will you confirm that would cost at least #3bn and that the main
beneficiaries are 5000 people who would get half the gains?''
Mr Clarke, who at one stage accused Mr Brown of talking ''drivel,''
quoted the speeches which had led to the speculation that there was a
rift. He told the House: ''The Prime Minister said 'my aim is to see
these taxes reduced or abolished altogether. I make no promises about
when we can do it.'
''What I said was 'The Prime Minister has set out these objectives as
a long-term aim for the Conservative Party.' I do not see the faintest
difference.''
As the exchanges continued, Mr Brown moved to drive a further wedge
between the Prime Minister and his Chancellor, demanding to know who was
in charge of the Treasury and of tax policy and from where the Budget
was being written. Was it No. 10 Downing Street, No. 11, or No. 10a -- a
clear reference to Mr Michael Hesesltine's elevation to the post of
Deputy Prime Minister.
Mr Clarke, however, insisted he was fully in charge of the
Government's economic policy, and told Mr Brown: ''You seem to think we
have a lot of people in charge of economic policy on our side of the
Commons. There is absolutely nobody in charge of it on Labour's side''.
At Prime Minister's Question Time a few minutes later, Mr Blair asked
Mr Major: ''Will you confirm that your leadership election pledge to
abolish inheritance tax and capital gains tax would amount to about #3bn
a year and that almost half that #3bn would go to just 5,000 people?''
Mr Major said he understood Mr Brown had been ''dancing around with
all sorts of fraudulent and distorted quotes'' on the issue. He
continued: ''I made it quite clear both publicly and privately for some
time that when it is appropriate and we can afford to do so I wish to
abolish both capital gains tax and inheritance tax.
''And I repeat the point for you. I have made that clear. It must wait
for resources to allow. I make no apology for that. The distortion of
capital gains tax will have to be tackled. I believe, unlike the Labour
Party, in trying to pass wealth down between generations, whereas they
squirm and wriggle whenever we talk of any tax reduction.''
Mr Blair said it was a mistaken sense of priority which saw the
Government concentrating on the ''interests of a priveleged few'' when,
as a result of Government spending cuts, schools were short of teachers
and classroom sizes were rising.
Mr Major retorted that homeowners across the country would be ''very
interested'' to hear they were the priveleged few.
''The reality is the people of this country would like to see changes
in these taxes, and when it is prudent to do so we will change them,''
he said.
The Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, Mr Malcolm Bruce, said last
night that scrapping capital gains tax, which now apparently was
Government policy, would create the biggest tax loophole of all time.
Those with good tax advisers would soon rush to turn income into capital
gains, and independent advisers thought that up to #5bn in tax revenues
could go down the drain.

THE cost of owning a pet is rising steeply. Beyond feeding, grooming
and exercising their animals, pet owners have to find the money for
veterinary care. This year, Britain introduced new laws in keeping with
European Union legislation, which effectively doubles the vet's bills.
The problem stems from drug prices. Under the new EU legislation, vets
cannot use generic products already approved for humans as they have
done in the past for conditions such as epilepsy and heart disease.
Instead, vets are only allowed to prescribe products which have been
licensed for animals, which may be much more expensive, up to twice the
price of the generic equivalent. A course of 250 antibiotics last year
only cost #36.50, but now will cost pet owners #73.42.
A spokesman for the British Veterinary Association said the EU
legislators were concerned with the residue levels of drugs left in food
animals, such as cows.
''Residue levels have to be set for all new drugs, to manage the
amount left in the animal's system and what effect this would have on
humans.
''The bizarre thing is, that the same legislation applies to companion
animals as to food animals. There are particular problems with horses.
For us they are a companion animal, but elsewhere in Europe they're
classified as a food animal,'' the spokesman says.
''The BVA has been lobbying all and sundry to have the distinction
drawn between companion and food animals. Obviously a companion animal
isn't going to end up on anybody's dinner-plate.''
The sudden price-rise in veterinary care has forced increasing numbers
of pet-owners to rely on charity. According to the Blue Cross
organisation, vet's bills are no longer affordable for low-income
earners. A spokesperson for Blue Cross, Tania Michell, says that the
numbers of animals being treated rose by 9% last year, and it is
expected that 1995 will demonstrate a further increase.
''Last year 60,202 animals were treated and the figure in the previous
national report was 55,252,'' says Michell. ''I can't predict how many
animals will be seen this year, but the Blue Cross is pretty stretched
at the moment. Obviously it's important not to compromise the standard
of care.''
The charity's running costs are rising accordingly. Michell says that
overall costs are set to increase by #500,000, to #6.5m for 1995.
''The operation is run entirely on donations and legacies,'' says
Michell. ''Most of the people seen are on benefit or low income but are
asked to leave a donation. The problem is, the donation is often a lot
lower than the cost, but there's nothing can be done about that. Some
people genuinely in need don't have the money to leave.
''The Blue Cross really must raise extra funds. It has 10 vets already
in London, but it really needs to take on another vet to meet the
demand.
''For every pound spent in 1993 #3 is now being spent -- and much of
that cost is reflected in veterinary bills.''
Michell adds that people weigh up the costs of owning a pet very
carefully before making a commitment. ''If you can afford to feed a pet
you can afford to insure it,'' she says.

FIVE councils have united to fight Government plans to downgrade two
West Highland roads.
The Scottish Office is pressing for the Ballachulish to Oban and
Lochgilphead to Oban roads to be detrunked.
Representatives of Argyll and Bute district, the new Argyll and Bute
unitary authority, Lochaber district, the new Highland unitary
authority, and Strathclyde Regional Council met in Oban and voted to
oppose the proposals.
The meeting highlighted serious concerns that the cost of freight
delivery would rocket if the roads were detrunked, as transport firms
had one rate for delivery on trunk roads and another for non-trunk
roads.
The council representatives are seeking an urgent meeting with
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
The group will also write to local MPs, Ray Michie in Argyll and
Russell Johnston in Highland region, to ask them to call for a halt to
the Government detrunking order which was lodged in Parliament on June
9. The order must be challenged within 60 days of being lodged.
Argyll roads director Jim Tolmie pointed out yesterday that roads on
Skye were due to be awarded trunk status, although the volume of traffic
flow there was much less than that on the roads where detrunking was
being suggested.
He also pointed out that heavy traffic was set to increase in Argyll
with the growth in fish farming and timber business.

HOSPITAL porters at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary walked out yesterday in
protest at the suspension of a union official less than 24-hours
earlier, writes ALAN HUNTER.
A total of 60 porters were said by health union Unison to be involved,
leaving only five covering the hospital.
The move followed the suspension of shop steward Tom Waterson, whom
management alleged had sent information about the hospital trust to a
local newspaper.
The trust said Mr Waterson had been disciplined as an employee not as
a union official.
The regional officer for Unison, Ms Marion Adamson, said it was now
taking legal advice, and contacting senior officials with a view to
calling a ballot for strike action.
Initially, the ballot would involve the portering staff of 65, but if
necessary, could affect 1500 union members at the trust.
She claimed the union had not been advised of Mr Waterson's
suspension, in breach of procedures.

GEC-Marconi yesterday failed in its bid to win a #2500m Ministry of
Defence contract to supply new attack helicopters for the Army, a
project which the company said could have created up to 230 jobs in
Scotland.
However, the decision by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo to choose
American-designed Apache aircraft still could mean a Scottish employment
boost, as other companies based in Scotland could benefit from the
order.
The competition to build the replacement for the Lynx anti-tank
helicopter has been one of the toughest and closest in recent years. Six
companies tendered for the work.
The three most seriously considered bids were: the Apache bid by
Westland and US company McDonnell Douglas; the British
Aerospace-Eurocopter Tiger; and the GEC-Marconi/Bell corporation Cobra
Venom.
During the battle for the project, GEC-Marconi had claimed that its
bid was #500,000 cheaper than those of their rivals and that it would
create or safeguard up to 500 jobs in Scotland alone.
The company's reaction to Mr Portillo's announcement was terse. A
spokesman said simply that it noted the decision and was disappointed.
He declined to comment further. However, it is understood that the
failure to win the contract is unlikely to lead to job losses among
existing staff.
Meanwhile, the Glenrothes-based company Hughes Microelectronics Europa
said it stood to benefit ''significantly'' from the decision to choose
the Apache. ''There have been very few projects as significant as this
in the 35 years we have been in Scotland,'' said sales and marketing
manager Mr Kevin Swann.
The company hopes to supply electronic technology and assembly to two
of the Apache programme's main sub-contractors.
Mr Portillo told the Commons that the decision would safeguard about
3000 jobs a year. However, he disclosed that the Government would buy
only 67 helicopters rather than the 91 originally envisaged.
He said that the Apache had proved its value with the US Army. ''It
will provide the British Army with a world-class capability, a
generation ahead of the Lynx, offering us the right combination of
mobility, rapid deployment, reach and firepower.''
He emphasised that the decision would bring many jobs to British
industry. Westland would assemble Apache and make its transmission at
Yeovil, in Somerset, and about 180 other UK companies would participate,
including Rolls-Royce which would make the engine at its Bristol plant.
There would be ''significant'' work for Shorts of Belfast on the
Apache's Hellfire anti-armour missile.
British industry would do at least half the work on the Apaches that
Britain was buying.
The decision to buy the Apache in preference to the Franco-German
Tiger was bitterly attacked by British Aerospace which warned of
''serious and long-term consequences'' if Britain continued to buy major
equipment off-the-shelf.
Mr John Weston, chairman of British Aerospace Defence, said: ''The
implications of the Apache are two-fold: it closes the UK out of the
very substantial export market for attack helicopters and anti-armour
weapons, and it is likely to have a significant impact on the attitudes
of industries and governments of our European partners.''
Eurocopter, the consortium building the Tiger, attacked Britain's
''sovereign decision'' and deplored the failure to set up new
cooperation with the UK.
Acutely aware of European concerns, Mr Portillo said he had written to
his French and German counterparts underlining the scope and breadth of
opportunities for future equipment collaboration.
The Defence Secretary also announced yesterday that the Government had
applied formally to the US Government to acquire conventionally-armed
Tomahawk land attack missile.
The system's very long range and great accuracy would enable the UK to
threaten limited action against selected targets as a means of
persuading an aggressor to desist from hostile activity.

COMPLAINTS about the NHS have more than doubled in the past five years
to a record level, according to the latest annual report of the Health
Service Ombudsman, Mr William Reid.
More than 1780 new complaints were received by the ombudsman last year
-- up 29% on the previous 12 months. However, in Scotland -- which
produced 144 complaints -- the increase is only 8.3%, compared with 31%
in England and 30.2% in Wales.
Mr Reid, who had investigated 508 grievances, said the high level of
complaints did not necessarily mean a deteriorating service. It was more
likely patients had higher expectations.
But he added: ''It will help if staff in all professions look upon
complaints not as a personal affront but as a valuable contribution to
audit and improvement of services.
''In the past year, I have again encountered very lax or superficial
involvement of some chief executives in the monitoring of their
performances on complaint handling.''
In his report, Mr Reid criticises the way some hospital staff deal
with bereavement. He also singles out for criticism the handling of
complaints, poor record-keeping and communication failures.
He told a news conference that complaints against medical staff were
on the increase, with many patients saying their concerns about
treatment were ignored. He also identified a failure to communicate,
especially with the terminally ill.
Mr Reid suggested that the focus on efficiency and meeting targets had
led some staff to become hardened to people's emotions when they were at
their most vulnerable.
''In hospitals some staff see patients as just another job. For the
individual patient it is a unique occasion,'' he said.
''There is a great deal of talk throughout the NHS of efficiency,
standards and meeting patients' demands. It is terribly important for
staff to remember at the same time that they are dealing with life and
death. They must not to become case-hardened and must remember the
trauma.''
Figures show that the number of grievances investigated about doctors
and nurses accounted for 62% of the total -- up 8% on the previous year.
The annual report highlights one case in which a woman with a severe
pain in her side died 24 hours after seeking help at Basildon Hospital
in Essex. Staff initially tried to send her home, but when her family
protested she was allowed to stay.
In a separate report detailing a selection of investigations carried
out between October and March, Mr Reid lists one Scottish case -- that
of a patient at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness who complained that his
opthalmic out-patient appointment was more than twice the length
promised in Highland Health Board's Charter, and that he had not been
kept informed.

A CYNIC once said that if the meek inherited the earth the Treasury
would tax them on it. So the Prime Minister could be seen as having a
powerful ally in his proclaimed intention to stop the Treasury taxing
inherited wealth.
The Sermon on the Mount omitted a reference to capital gains, so the
tax on those falls into a somewhat different moral category, which is
what we are concerned with here.
Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair were prepared to be moralistic about
this. Complete abolition would benefit the well-off most and cost a lot,
which could be better spent on the toiling masses.
However, first they remembered they were politicians and raised the
alleged Government split on the issue -- Mr Major being keen, the
Chancellor less keen, to state his presumed position moderately.
Naturally, Messrs Major and Clarke denied there was any split. They
did not quite get to the point of alleging that only Siamese Twins could
be closer than they, which might be significant as that is exactly what
Ministers accused of being at odds often do seek to establish.
Mr Clarke was careful to say that abolition was a long-term objective.
He was also careful not to say that he personally favoured it.
Mr Major said he wanted it done as soon as it could be afforded. The
latter is a phrase capable of many interpretations and the impression
left was that Mr Clarke has been at the Prime Minister to moderate his
enthusiasm and that, in this case, half a loaf may be as much as is
prudent to offer to the not exactly starving inheritors and gainers.
Total abolition of capital gains would see almost half the #3 bn cost
going to a mere 5000 people, said Mr Blair. Put that way, it did seem to
threaten to put in the shade the feeding of the five thousand who, after
all, received only loaves and fishes.
Mr Blair then got on to ''the Tory obsession with the interests of a
privileged few,'' which enabled Mr Major to retort that many of the
inheritors would be surprised to learn they were privileged and to move
on to the familiar, if not totally secure ground, of attacking Labour's
willingness for the state to keep people's money.
This ground went squelchier as Mr Blair reminded him that Tory tax
increases since the last election amounted to the equivalent of 7p on
income tax, and that Labour had achieved the only tax cut of this
Parliament in reducing VAT on fuel.
The political way out would seem to be to abolish the taxes for all
but those that the man on Clapham omnibus would assess as stinking rich,
but of course Mr Clarke may be able to think of better things to do with
#3bn.
Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy -- Plaid Cymru) said that Mr
William Hague's appointment as Welsh Secretary was an improvement on Mr
John Redwood only in the sense that he was at least on the same planet
as the rest of us but otherwise was a pathetic reflection on the Welsh
Tory MPs.
Mr Major rather testily told off the Welsh Nats for ''wrapping
themselves up in a little country,'' which saw them exchanging delighted
smiles with their Scots confreres evidently feeling that this remark
could be made to play well for them on their native heaths.
Lady Olga Maitland (Sutton and Cheam -- Con) said she hoped reports
she had read about Irish terrorists being let out of clink early were
untrue.
Mr Major, rather disingenuously assured her that remission rates were
being reviewed but he didn't think the time was ripe for changing them.
Perhaps, one felt, in a fortnight or a month the review would have
ripened nicely.
He was reminded earlier by the magnificent Sir Peter Tapsell
(Hornchurch -- Con) of Bismarck's adage that the Balkans were not worth
the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.
Britain did not want the road to Sarajevo ''paved with the bones of
our young men,'' a declaration which induced less vocal support than
perhaps he expected.
Mr Major gave a well considered expoision of why he thought it
worthwhile to keep the troops in Bosnia, possibly reflecting that trying
to be a blessed peace-maker is just as difficult as trying to stop
taxing the meek.

INJURED cyclist Jason Clark, seven, woke to a VIP welcome yesterday at
the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
Surrounding Jason's bed was a roomful of nurses, doctors, managers,
the Yorkhill Trust chairman, Mrs Joan Cameron, and the Scottish chairman
of the Variety Club. A table was laden with sandwiches and goodies.
The refurbished Accident and Emergency Department isn't quite like
this every day -- yesterday was its official opening -- but Jason and
his mother Christine, who had spent the night in an armchair by his bed,
agreed it was the place to be after a bicycle accident.
Jason, from Knightswood, had been kept in overnight for observation
after somersaulting from the bike he had been given just two days
before.
''I put the front brake on first,'' he explained, a dressing covering
the worst of the wounds on his face and head.
His parents drove him to the hospital and Jason was admitted to the
#1m state-of-the-art department, completely rebuilt and extended in five
phases over 18 months. The once-gloomy waiting area has been
transformed, and the expansion, bringing in a dedicated x-ray suite and
more examination rooms, should result in shorter waits for the 30,000
children who use the department each year.
''The shortage of examination and treatment rooms was the main problem
before -- we had the doctors, and the patients were ready to be seen,
but at times we didn't have the rooms,'' said Dr Nanjappachetty
Doraiswamy, the consultant in charge.
The Variety Club raised #100,000 of the cost of the department, and
the chairman of the Scottish committee, Mr Alan Fraser, unveiled a
plaque.
Not every trip to Yorkhill has a happy ending, but Jason walked out
fit and well, ready to recommend it to his friends.

HUNDREDS of thousands of fish were under threat last night amid freak
weather conditions in the Severn-Trent region. Torrential rain washed
industrial chemicals into rivers, then low pressure weather and soaring
temperatures drew oxygen from the water. Large numbers of fish were
reported dead and others were left gasping on the surface. Experts from
the National Rivers Authority were trying to pump oxygen back into the
water.

<HEADLINE>Concern at  Devonport bill.  Doubts on deal that robbed Rosyth</HEADLINE>

RENEWED doubts about the deal which saw the refitting work on nuclear
submarines awarded to Devonport dockyard, rather than Rosyth, were
voiced yesterday by the influential Defence Select Committee of the
House of Commons.
It said that a new area of concern had emerged in the extra work now
needed at the Plymouth dockyard to equip it to deal safely with the
nuclear vessels.
The all-party committee's report published yesterday shows that the
MPs are not able to share the Ministry of Defence's confidence that
necessary work to meet stringent new safety regulations will be
completed on schedule and within budget.
They add that ''given that the controversial decision'' to choose
Devonport rather than Rosyth ''was based entirely upon highly marginal
cost considerations, we would be particularly disturbed by any
escalation in real price''.
Devonport won the contract in June, 1993, with a bid of #135m,
undercutting Rosyth's last accepted bid of #147m. However, in a Defence
Select Committee report published in May last year, it emerged that
Devonport apparently had added #55m to its bid price, giving a new
figure of #190m.
Mr Menzies Campbell (North-east Fife), the Liberal Democrat defence
spokesman and a member of the committee, said: ''The decision to
transfer the Trident contract was taken on the basis of a fairly narrow
financial advantage.
''I would be extremely concerned if that financial advantage was to
disappear because of increased costs.''
The committee sought specific assurances that the need to meet the
safety standards would not affect the original estimate of #190m for the
new refitting facility.
The-then Defence Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, said he was ''not
aware of any problems in that area''.
The department told them that the current difficulties affected only
existing nuclear submarine docking facilities and would have ''no direct
impact'' on the provision of refit facilities for Trident submarines.
However, Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for North Tayside, said he
judged that the Devonport yard only could meet the new safety
regulations with a huge increase in costs.
A defence debate will be held in the week the Commons reassemble in
October and by then the costs position should be clearer.
The select committee also urges that sufficient capability should be
retained at Faslane ''to handle the demands made by the increasingly
unreliable Polaris submarines''.
It praised the floating explosives handling jetty at Coulport -- which
the MPs visited -- as a considerable engineering achievment.
The MPs said they had decided not to ''dwell upon the reasons for the
prodigious increase in costs'' of the shore construction work on the
Trident deterrent programme, now running at #823m above the 1981
estimate.
They noted that the MoD had already completed an internal
investigation of the lessons to be learned.

GROWING concern at the Scottish Office over the ''jobs for the boys''
controversy surrounding a number of senior staff appointments to the new
unitary councils was translated into action yesterday.
After a meeting with Staff Commission chairman Robert Peggie, Scottish
Local Government Minister George Kynoch announced a series of measures
designed to crack down on councillors who bend the rules over filling
jobs on the new authorities.
The measures include a temporary freeze on appointments below the
level of assistant director.
The delay is to allow the commission to finalise new guidelines which
will re-emphasise to councillors the consequences of breaking or bending
the rules on job filling.
Mr Kynoch -- who appears to believe the commission should have taken a
tougher line at an earlier stage -- said councils needed ''a shot fired
across their bows'' because of the way some had acted.
He stressed his determination that in future the appointments
procedure would be carried out ''in a fair, professional and proper
manner''.
If necessary, the power of the Scottish Secretary would be invoked to
force a council to obey the procedures laid down by the commission. This
could result in an appointment being nullified and a rerun of the
procedures.
Mr Peggie, who first spoke out exclusively to The Herald about his
concerns two weeks ago, is currently investigating about half a dozen
complaints of breaches of guidelines over jobs.
The sort of behaviour which has caused concern involves recommending
people for jobs without interviews and councillors on appointments
committees acting as referees for some applicants.

THE persuasive powers of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth have
induced Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for North Tayside, to accept a
place on the Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, on which he
had previously refused to serve.
The promotion of a former member, Mr Raymond Robertson (Aberdeen
South), to ministerial office left a vacancy to be filled and rather
than see another English Tory drafted by the Commons Committee of
Selection, Mr Forsyth called in Mr Walker and asked him to reconsider.
Mr Walker, while standing by criticisms he has made of the Labour
committee chairman, Mr William McKelvey (Kilmarnock and Loudoun), said
that ''in the spirit of party unity'' he had agreed to let his name go
forward.
He accused Mr McKelvey of taking the view that the Westminster
Parliament had no authority in Scotland, although it is to the House of
Commons that he has to submit the committee's reports. Mr Walker
emphasised that it was not a personal matter, as he had a high regard
for Mr McKelvey.
Meanwhile, SNP leader Alex Salmond last night set six tasks for Mr
Forsyth in his new role as Scottish Secretary.
He wants him to push for the restoration of benefits to Scotland's
14,000 unemployed 16 and 17-year-olds, the return of water to local
authority control, and movement of the entire Department of Trade and
Industry's oil and gas division to Aberdeen.
In addition, Mr Salmond wants a Scottish Office Minister to be present
at every meeting of the European Council of Ministers and, as well as
retaining the Fort William sleeper, he wants all Motorail services to be
reinstated in Scotland.
The SNP leader's final demand is that, since Scotland has 70% of the
United Kingdom's fishing fleet, the Fisheries Department should be moved
north of the Border.

FRANCE faces another determined bid by the other EU countries to close
down the European Parliament in Strasbourg and move all meetings to
Brussels.
Euro-MPs meeting in their monthly plenary in Strasbourg yesterday put
off agreeing a timetable for sessions in the French town by the Rhine,
which is the official seat of the assembly.
This raises the threat of major procedural delays and disruption to
the working of the assembly next year -- with consequently more pressure
to switch business permanently to Brussels.
''It is fair to say there are all sorts of manoeuvrings going on
behind the scenes -- many people want to move out. That is very well
known,'' said Mr John Tomlinson, an English Labour Euro-MP.
He has campaigned against Strasbourg because of the huge extra costs
involved in moving an estimated 5000 Eurocrats there from Brussels once
every month for plenaries.
The latest signs in the campaign to abandon Strasbourg -- a suggestion
fiercely resisted by the French authorities -- came yesterday when
Fascist Euro-MPs produced a written declaration demanding a single seat
for the assembly.
Under EU rules confirmed at the Edinburgh summit of 1992 the
parliament's base must continue to be Strasbourg for a minimum of 11
plenaries a year.
However, other nations' Euro-MPs are furious at the extra costs caused
by poor air and hotel services in Strasbourg where a new parliament
building is currently under construction. It is needed because of the
continuing expansion of the EU and the rising number of Euro-MPs.
The Fascists said the present arrangements were absurd and they
condemned the ''total inadequacy'' of air and rail links -- a subject
about which most Euro-MPs complain incessantly. They priced the annual
cost to the EU of using Strasbourg as #10.1m a year although the
assembly meets there only four days a month.
The annual rent for the Brussels parliamentary offices was put at
#15.3m and for other, seldom used premises in Luxembourg, at #11.7m.
However, because the Fascists are unpopular and insignificant as a
voting bloc in Strasbourg their declaration is unlikely to win much
support.

<HEADLINE>Former Russian, 84, is accused of Nazi occupation murders. Briton in war crimes trial</HEADLINE>

THE first British subject to be charged with war crimes yesterday
appeared in court.
Szymon Serafinowicz, 84, -- who is accused of murdering four Jews in
Nazi occupied Belorussia in 1941 and 1942 -- was released on bail by
Epsom magistrates in Surrey after a 20-minute hearing.
Outside court his solicitor, Mr Nicholas Bowers, said his client was
''absolutely innocent'' and promised a ''full and vigorous defence''.
White-haired Mr Serafinowicz, who has lived in Palmersfield Road,
Banstead, Surrey, for the last 50 years, listened intently to an
interpreter who translated proceedings into Russian for him.
He spoke only to give his address and date of birth, as well as to
correct the court clerk's pronunciation of a Belorussian village where
one of the crimes was alleged to have taken place.
Mr Serafinowicz, who is due to appear before the court again on
October 5, was granted bail on condition he does not leave the UK; does
not apply for a passport or other travel documents; and continues to
live at his present address or at an address notified to the court and
the police.
The frail pensioner was dressed in a black jacket, light brown
corduroy trousers, a white open-necked shirt and red and grey checked
jumper.
He listened intently as the four charges were read out.
The first alleges that on the October 27, 1941, in the village of
Turets, then under German occupation, he murdered an unknown Jew in
circumstances constituting a violation of the laws and customs of war,
contrary to Common Law.
A second, similar charge, relates to the murder of an unknown Jew in
the same village on November 4, 1941. The third allegation relates to
the murder of an unknown Jew in the town of Mir on November 9, 1941, and
the final charge relates to the murder of an unknown Jew in the town of
Kryniczne between December 31, 1941 and March 1, 1942.
Outside court, solicitor Mr Bowers insisted Mr Serafinowicz was
innocent. He said: ''Our client has today been charged with offences
under the War Crimes Act 1990.
''Our client is completely innocent of these charges and a full and
vigorous defence will now be prepared.''
The solicitor said Mr Serafinowicz would apply for legal aid and added
that he had entered Britain in 1947 and subsequently been granted
British citizenship.
''Since that time he has been an honest and hardworking member of
society.
''In his work as a builder and carpenter he has contributed
considerably to the community for many years,'' said Mr Bowers.
''Our client has been aware of the police investigation for more than
two years and has been under considerable stress and pressure in view of
the possibility of charges being brought.
''He is now determined to have these matters brought to clear his name
and then to live out the remainder of his years in peace,'' the
solicitor added.
Neighbours of Mr Serafinowicz in Palmersfield Road said he was a quiet
man who rarely left his home except to potter around his garden. They
added that his wife died last year and he lived with his son, Kazimierz.
One neighbour, Ms Alison Godfrey, said Mr Serafinowicz had difficulty
expressing himself in English and rarely said more than ''Hello'' to
people living nearby. She said his son was in his mid-40s and worked in
a snooker club in Sutton.
Ms Godfrey added: ''I only see him about once a week being driven in
the car by his son. He always wears the same sweater, whether it's 90
degrees or freezing. He sometimes pokes around the garden and does some
digging, but otherwise you wouldn't see him at all.''
Another neighbour, Ms Amanda Golder, said: ''He's just an ordinary
type really. He potters in the garden and he is very quiet.''

A GULF war veteran, on the run from his regiment, who held up a bank
with a sawn-off shotgun was jailed for five years yesterday.
Police sealed off the Tay road bridge and watched Paul Roberts dump
the proceeds of the robbery, then the shotgun, in the river as he
realised he had no chance of escape.
There are striking parallels between Roberts, 26, and Bonnyrigg bank
robber Robert Smith, jailed for life for gunning down the 63-year-old
grandfather who tackled him as he fled with #185,000.
Both were lance-corporals in the Life Guards with excellent service
records, both served in the Gulf War, both went Awol from their
regiments and neither had previous convictions.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Roberts admitted robbing the
Clydesdale Bank in Castle Street, Tayport, Fife, on March 29 this year
of #4167 after threatening staff with the sawn-off shotgun.
Mr Paul McBride, advocate-depute, told the court Roberts walked
towards the Tay road bridge and, in the clear view of police, emptied
the cash into the river.
He then sat on a rock for about 15 minutes and appeared totally
composed although he remained silent.
From a stairway leading to the bridge Roberts pointed his gun in the
air and fired it, signalling police to back off. He then hurled his gun
into the Tay and surrendered.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, said that throughout Roberts's career
he had received a series of extraordinary commendations.
However, after the Gulf War, there were two catastrophic events in
Roberts's life. His marriage collapsed and it was announced that his
regiment was to be amalgamated as part of defence cuts.
He felt betrayed and after taking his summer leave in 1992 failed to
return to the regiment. After drifting around Europe he joined the
Foreign Legion and served in Bosnia.
On his return to Britain he was held by the Army under open arrest and
went on the run.
After getting a job at stables he decided on a ''naive and stupid''
plan so he would no longer have to lead a hand-to-mouth existence.
Lord Philip told the accused: ''The history of your background does
nothing but credit to you. However, your conduct on this occasion no
doubt caused a great deal of terror to the victims of it.''

A TREASURE hunter who dug up a valuable Tudor brooch in a public park
was yesterday told by the Court of Appeal that finders are not
necessarily keepers.
Mr Ian Fletcher, who won the right to keep the #35,000 gold and
sapphire pin at a High Court hearing last year, will now have to hand
over his ''dream find'' to Waverley Borough Council -- unless he
succeeds in a final appeal to the House of Lords.
In a judgment that will dismay all treasure seekers, the appeal judges
held that using a metal detector was not a ''recreation'' allowed by the
council, which was entitled to the brooch, under well-established legal
principles, as the owner or possessor of the land.
Mr Fletcher, 49, a sewing machine retailer of Preston New Road,
Blackpool, detected the brooch in hard ground at Farnham Park, Surrey,
in August 1992. It was the first item of value he had found in 20 years
of metal detecting.
A coroner's inquest decided the jewel was lost accidentally and so was
not treasure trove, which had to be surrendered to the Crown. But Mr
Fletcher then faced legal action by Waverley Borough Council, which
claimed title to the brooch as owner of the land, and accused him of
trespassing by digging it up.
In the High Court, Judge Fawcus decided that despite the council's
desire to prevent metal detecting, it was a well-recognised hobby.
Digging in response to the metal detector's signal, provided it was
within reasonable bounds, was ''incidental to such recreational
activity''.
Yesterday, Lord Justice Auld said the basic principle was that the
lawful possessor of the land had the better title to any article found
''in or attached to'' it.
The council's ownership of the park was subject to the condition that
it must be maintained and kept as a public pleasure or recreation
ground.
That did not allow members of the public to excavate the soil, said
the judge. Even if it did, it would not include a right to remove
anything found.
The council had a superior right to the brooch over the ''finders
keepers'' right of Mr Fletcher, who had no permission to dig and remove
it. He had committed acts of trespass and the council was entitled to
protect its property, despite the absence of any specific bye-law
against metal detecting.
The judge, sitting with the Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham,
and Lord Justice Ward, granted a declaration that the brooch belonged to
the council.

THE BATTLE for control of the Scotsman newspaper took a new twist
yesterday when Liberal Democrat MP Sir David Steel revealed he had been
approached to help put together a consortium to bid for ownership of the
Edinburgh-based paper.
Sir David said a number of Scottish personalities, including
businessmen, had contacted him with a view to preparing a bid for the
paper and its sister titles, Scotland On Sunday and the Evening News.
The bid would only be for the Edinburgh-based papers and not the
Aberdeen Journals titles, the Press and Journal and Evening Express,
which have also been put on the market by the Thomson Corporation.
Sir David would not reveal the names of the people involved in the new
bid, or what stage it was at. He said he did not want to head such a
consortium but would try to bring people together with a like-minded
interest.
It seems part of the reason behind the new consortium's bid is a fear
the Scotsman may fall into the hands of Tory businessmen led by
Professor Ross Harper, who is currently putting together a bid.
In a short statement which he refused to elaborate on, Sir David said:
''As an MP for 30 years who is not seeking re-election, they have urged
me to join in an effort to prevent the Scotsman and its sister papers
being taken over either as a mouthpiece of the Conservative Party or by
investors uninterested in the distinctive role of these papers in
Scottish life.
''I am not willing to head such a consortium. I do not see myself as a
latter day Rupert McMurdoch, but I do want to see the Scotsman
developing its small ''l'' liberal and independent tradition.
''Accordingly, I am ready to join with others as a facilitator in
pulling together those with a like-minded interest. This does not
exclude UK or international financial input.
''These are early days and I shall be talking to many individuals and
institutions to see whether this is possible. Thereafter, I would intend
to withdraw to leave the details to those with expertise in this
field.''

ANTI-NUCLEAR demonstrators wearing white protection suits chained
themselves across the entrance to the French Consulate in Edinburgh
yesterday to protest against France's resumption of nuclear testing.
They also called for a boycott of the country's products.
The demonstration ended when Consul General Jean-Claude Richard agreed
to talks with the Friends of the Earth activists. However, further
protests are planned for today to disrupt Bastille Day.
Demonstrations are also to take place in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji,
Tahiti, Italy, Germany, and Paris.
Mr Kevin Dunion, director of Friends of the Earth in Scotland and one
of two protesters allowed into the Consulate, said later that the Consul
had agreed to pass on a letter of protest to the French Government.
* Russia may be forced to renew the dumping of liquid radioactive
waste into the Sea of Japan, despite protests from Japan and its other
neighbours in the Far East.
Tankers containing the waste are full and Russia still lacks other
ways of disposing of the liquid, said Yevgeny Stomatiuk, chairman of the
natural resources committee in the Primorsky region.

THE European Parliament last night voted overwhelmingly to support a
Scottish professor in his campaign against illegal job discrimination at
an Italian university.
Professor David Petrie, a 43-year-old lecturer in languages and
literature, is leading a committee of 13 foreigners working at the
University of Verona where the authorities have reduced their pay and
given them smaller offices while promoting Italians and giving them pay
increases.
Under EU law this is illegal, a fact supported in two judgments by the
European Court of Justice and by the European Commission.
A court in Italy has seized some of the university's assets so that
wages are paid to the lecturers.
Euro-MPs backed Mr Petrie by 235 votes to three with nine abstentions.
Mr Petrie said: ''We are delighted . . . We invite the Italians to put
their house in order.''
The campaign has been supported by Mr Hugh McMahon, Labour Euro-MP for
Strathclyde West, who raised the matter in the assembly.

TWO men who were accused of a series of robberies and assaults in the
Highlands will not be prosecuted following a judge's error and an
administrative mistake.
The issue involved the 110-day rule, which limits the amount of time
accused can be held in custody pending a trial.
In a further move yesterday, it emerged they have been the subject of
a civil court interim interdict by one of the main prosecution witnesses
in their scheduled trial.
Mr William Beattie, 34, and Mr Donald Murray, 33, were both due to
stand trial at the High Court in Inverness this month on an indictment
containing eight charges.
They included breaking into several premises in the Highlands and
stealing guns, assaulting Mr Alistair Mackenzie, 80, and tying him up in
his remote bungalow near Strathpeffer and threatening to shoot him.
Mr Mackenzie has now left his home because he is too frightened to
remain there, and is living with friends. He is said to be ''shocked''
at the latest developments.
Mr Mackenzie said: ''I am still living in fear, always looking over my
shoulder at the slightest noise.
''No-one seems to care about old folk who are victims of violence. It
is a disgrace that people accused of a crime should be able to walk away
without trial to prove their innocence or guilt.
''The judge who made this mistake should be put out to grass. My life
has been ruined. The police and the procurator-fiscal have been very
sympathetic towards me, but I have heard nothing from the Crown
Office.''
The pair were also accused of assaulting another Easter Ross man, Mr
John MacNicol, with an axe and threatening to shoot him if he told the
police, and other firearms offences.
A witness in their scheduled trial, Ms Pauline Eddie, of Coulpark,
Alness, has successfully applied for interim interdict at Inverness
Sheriff Court.
It prevents Mr Beattie of Lismhor, West End, Alness, and Mr Murray of
Fyrish Crescent, Evanton, from molesting Ms Eddie by threatening her,
putting her in a state of fear and alarm or distress.
It also bars them from telephoning, approaching her at her home or
work and from following her.
A hearing has been fixed for Tain Sheriff Court on Wednesday, July 19.
Mr Beattie also appeared at Tain Sheriff Court yesterday accused of
threatening violence to Ms Eddie.
The breach of the peace incident is alleged to have taken place on
July 11, the day the High Court sitting opened.
Mr Beattie pled not guilty and Honorary Sheriff Roddy Robertson
released him on bail, despite protests by fiscal Henry Westwater.
After Mr Beattie was granted bail for trial on August 14, Mr Westwater
lodged an appeal against the decision. Mr Beattie will now be held in
custody until the bail appeal is heard at the High Court in Inverness on
Monday.
It was a judge's error which led to the original successful appeal by
Mr Beattie's agent, advocate James Reilly, at the Court of Appeal last
week, leading to all charges being dropped against him.
Now the Crown Office has revealed that no proceedings will be taken
against Mr Murray.
The pair had been indicted to appear at Inverness High Court on May 9.
However, because the case was second in the role and was likely to
take longer than the scheduled court days, Lord Coulsfield said he was
not prepared to sit beyond the second Friday, May 19, as he had an
Employment Appeals Tribunal the following week.
The Crown moved for an adjournment and sought an extension to the
110-day rule. It wanted the two men held for an additional 58 days until
the July sitting.
Lord Coulsfield granted the motion, refused bail and granted the
extension until Monday, July 10. Mr Reilly then lodged an appeal against
that decision.
However, it was then discovered July 10 was not a High Court day in
Inverness. It was actually due to begin on Tuesday, July 11 and the
indictment then fell.
The Crown sought to serve a new indictment, but this was refused by
the Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Ross, and, because the two accused had
spent more than 110 days in custody, they were released.
Mr Reilly's appeal against Lord Coulsfield's decision was then heard
by the Appeal Court on July 6, and Lord Justice General, Lord Hope
declared his fellow judge, Lord Coulsfield, was wrong in his decision to
extend the 110-day period.
Lord Hope said the judge did not have ''sufficient cause'' to extend
it and should have either attempted to make alternative arrangements for
his other business or find another judge to take the trial.
The Crown Office has decided that although only Mr Beattie appealed,
Lord Hope's judgment must also apply to his fellow accused, Mr Murray,
and he has been told he will not be prosecuted.

AN acrimonious dispute involving The Robert Gordon University and a
lecturer whose sacking led to strikes by her colleagues finally ended
yesterday.
Mrs Sheena Falconer, 50, was jubilant in February when an industrial
tribunal ordered the university to pay her #41,000 and to give her her
job back because it decided she had been unfairly dismissed.
Yesterday, however, there was frustration that because Mrs Falconer
was dismissed less than four months before changes in the law -- which
now prevents employers from refusing to pay compensation awards -- she
will not be re-employed and will receive only #15,530. On her dismissal
in April 1993 she had received #4715.
The tribunal had concluded Mrs Falconer had not been made redundant
because, when Principal Dr David Kennedy made the decision to dismiss
her, he did not have all the relevant facts before him.
It also said the university distorted the true picture by
concentrating on what it saw as the primary component of her function to
the exclusion of all else she was employed to do.
After 27-years' service, Mrs Falconer, of Anderson Drive, Aberdeen,
was offered redundancy or an alternative post as a lecturer which would
have meant putting her sister, also a lecturer, out of work.
Colleagues held a series of one-day strikes in support of her after
she was dismissed and the case has been fought on her behalf by the
Educational Institute of Scotland.
The matter was due to go back before the tribunal yesterday but Mr
Sandy Kemp, arbitrating, told the tribunal that settlement had been
reached.
Mrs Falconer said later: ''There was no point in pursuing it any
further because I was offered the maximum under the old law.
''I am bitterly disappointed and very upset that Robert Gordon
University chose that course. I gave it 27 years of my life and I am
paid the minimum statutory amount. I have no pension, nothing.
''I was unfairly dismissed on April 21. The Government recognised the
legislation in place at that time as being bad and corrected it so
employers didn't get away with paying you #10,000 regardless and that
became law in August.
''The new legislation is not retrospective if the employer chooses to
ignore an award.
''I feel betrayed by the institution I gave my life to.''
Mrs Falconer said there were meetings with two university
representatives following her success in the tribunal, and she and the
EIS believed agreement had been reached that she would be briefly
re-employed until June when she was 50 when she could take early
retirement with an enhanced pension.
She was taken aback when the university Principal subsequently wrote
to say it was not practicable to re-employ her.
She said that she had eventually offered to waive her right even to
the #15,000 if she could have her pension, without enhancement, which
she said would be less costly to the university than what it had settled
for. But this offer was also rejected.
''I am terribly upset. But at the end of the day I have a 26-page
judgment to say I was right and I should never have been dismissed.''
No-one was available for comment at the university but in a statement
it said the settlement of #15,530 was in line with the amount Mrs
Falconer would have been awarded under the previous employment
legislation.
''The final outcome agreed today is consistent with the line taken by
the university throughout the case that it could only settle within the
statutory limits.
''After a lengthy examination the university concluded that Mrs
Falconer's re-engagement was not practicable.''

A CATALOGUE of errors surrounded the explosive demolition of a block
of flats in Glasgow, a damning new report has claimed.
Mrs Helen Tinney, 61, was killed when a piece of flying concrete
weighing around a kilo struck her on the chest during the demolition of
Queen Elizabeth Square in the Gorbals two years ago.
Following an inquiry into the event by the Institute of Explosives
Engineers, serious flaws in the handling of the operation and in the way
the blast was carried out have been identified.
The institute's findings follow a detailed examination of the
explosion and interviews with all the parties involved. They state:
* There was a ''considerable'' increase in the amount of explosive
used, holes blasted and a complete change in method compared to that
originally planned.
However, no discussion took place on extending the exclusion zone and
Glasgow District Council was not made aware of the final blasting method
until after the event.
* After a trial blast, which injured a workman and damaged cars, blast
protection was altered but never tested. The incident, says the report,
was glossed over and it was claimed that the damage was within the
planned exclusion zone.
* No warning siren was sounded before the blast and buildings came
down in reverse order to that agreed.
* Glasgow District Council did not appear to know what was happening
''up to the day of the blast and beyond'' because of confusion over the
contractual arrangement between the demolition contractors Ladkarn and
Wreckers.
The companies claimed they were carrying out a joint venture, but it
later emerged that Wreckers was a sub contractor.
Thousands of people gathered around the buildings to watch what was
billed as the biggest controlled explosion in Europe since the Second
World War.
However, Health and Safety Executive guidelines advise that crowds
should not be attracted to explosive demolitions. ''That clause was
blatantly ignored,'' says the institute.
The institute says it will not be taking any action against any of its
members who were involved in the demolition. The document says ''there
is ample evidence of mistakes and errors''.
However, it concludes it would be difficult to prove unprofessional
conduct by members, although it admits that ''the performance of members
involved was clearly lacking in certain respects''.
The report was praised by Mrs Tinney's four children, who revealed
they are to take legal action against Glasgow District Council, the
Health and Safety Executive, and Ladkarn and Wreckers.
Miss Elaine Tinney, 30, said: ''We have been battling for two years to
bring these outrageous things to the public attention.
''We want those responsible prosecuted, punished in some way or even
to hear them say they are sorry. They just pretend it will go away.''
Changes are now being made in the regulations dealing with the size of
exclusion zones as a result of the explosion.
Mr Jack Hatt, president of the institute, told The Herald that the
original guidelines had been drawn up years before the demolition of
multi-storey blocks of flats had been considered.
''The guidelines on the exclusion zone were that it should be two
times the height of the structure,'' he said.
''They were drawn up by the Health and Safety Executive as a safe area
in which you could fell a chimney.''

A WIDOW last night demanded to know why her sick husband died alone in
a prison cell. A fatal accident inquiry at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court was
told that Mr Andrew Milligan, 46, was not checked every half-hour as set
down in police guidelines.
His widow, Mrs Elaine Milligan, 42, claimed her husband had not been
treated properly, and should have been visited in his cell more
frequently.
Inspector William Ross, who was in charge at Kilmarnock Police Station
on the Saturday night last February when Mr Milligan died, admitted that
visitations to prisoners by officers had been overlooked because they
were too busy.
Mr Milligan, of MacBeth Drive, Kilmarnock, had been locked up in a
cell after being found drunk and incapable near his home. Five hours
later he was found dead in the cell.
Inspector Ross said that the police procedure manual stated that
vulnerable and drunk prisoners should be checked in their cells every
half an hour.
Sergeant George Lambeth said that he had found Mr Milligan lying on a
muddy grass area in a drunken state. He had two bags containing vodka
and beer lying near him. Sergeant Lambeth said that when asked Mr
Milligan denied he was under medication or sick.
It later emerged that Mr Milligan was in receipt of invalidity benefit
and had been prescribed liver tablets.
The court was told that he had been placed in a cell and was visited
only three times before he was found dead.
Constable Ronald Patterson, who was first to check him, said: ''I had
no concerns then for his wellbeing.''
He said that at the time he was not aware of the guidelines about how
often prisoners should be visited.
PC Ross said that he first became aware that the prisoner was unwell
at 4.25am when the duty sergeant called him through.
Mr Milligan was sitting on the floor with his back against the wall
next to the toilet.
Less than an hour later a police doctor pronounced him dead.
Pathologist Dr Nancy Cunningham said that Mr Milligan's death had been
caused by acute fatty infiltration of the liver which may have taken
some time to develop. She said it was a common condition in alcoholics.
She said: ''Nothing could be done to avert his death at Kilmarnock
Police Station. No drugs can reverse this process.''
Sheriff Terence Russell delivered a formal verdict that Mr Milligan
had died from a liver complaint.

<HEADLINE>Canon gives Fife shot in the arm with #10m expansion plan</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977404157</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE electronics firm Canon yesterday announced a #10m investment
which will initially create 220 jobs, but which could eventually almost
double that number, in Scotland's worst unemployment blackspot.
Canon's decision will increase the workforce at the two-year-old
Glenrothes plant to almost 320, and puts the Fife facility at the hub of
its European operations.
The plant is to supply bubble-jet printers for use with personal and
laptop computers to all its European sales companies. By December next
year, production is expected to reach 50,000 units a month, a figure
expected to double within a short time.
The news was revealed at the firm's Westwood Park factory by Mr
Hirosuke Asano, managing director of the plant, where photocopiers are
recycled for sale throughout Europe.
He told guests, including Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch:
''We are very glad to be able to make this major announcement about the
expansion of our plant here, fulfilling the promise made when we
originally set up in Glenrothes.
''We looked at a number of possible locations throughout the world for
this project, but the quality and high standard of our existing
workforce made a very strong case for bringing it here. The fact that
Canon has chosen Glenrothes for this plant, from among many alternative
sites around the world, is testimony to the high quality of the
workforce here.
''We will initially employ around 220 people by the end of next year,
and we look forward to continuing to grow and be a part of the local
community.''
Mr Asano praised Glenrothes Development Corporation, Invest in Fife,
and Locate in Scotland for their ''assistance and encouragement''.
Construction on the expansion which, at 100,000sq ft, will be
one-and-a-half times bigger than the existing factory where 95 people
work, is due to start in August.
Welcoming the investment, Mr Kynoch said: ''This is extremely good
news for Glenrothes and Scotland.
''Today's announcement reinforces Canon's long-term commitment to its
Scottish plant and workforce, and demonstrates once again the
considerable advantages a Scottish location offers to overseas
companies.
''That Canon should have chosen Scotland as its European manufacturing
centre for one of its most successful products is of real significance,
and bodes well for the long-term future of the plant.''
Mr Kynoch said it was one of a steady stream of announcements of
Japanese success stories in Scotland over the last 12 months, adding:
''What makes Scotland stand out is the quality of the total package
offered to inward investors.''
Although in Glenrothes for only a short time, said Mr Kynoch, Canon
had quickly ''come to appreciate the skills, flexibility, and indeed the
high productivity that a Scottish workforce can provide. When the
workforces of Japanese companies in Scotland are able to achieve
productivity rates which match or indeed exceed those in Japan, it's not
difficult to understand why Scotland is so successful in the inward
investment business.''
Paying tribute to Locate in Scotland's ''record year'' -- during which
97 inward investment projects were undertaken, there was planned
investment of #1,100,000m, and 12,300 jobs were created or safeguarded,
Mr Kynoch said one of the reasons for the success was the ''calibre'' of
the people available.
Adding that Scotland could provide cost-effective, well educated staff
who were able to adjust readily to any task, he said: ''This Government
has quite deliberately set out to ensure that social and other non-wage
costs are among the lowest in the European Community, and I don't have
to register the political point of the implications of the Social
Chapter and the fact that this Government has very clearly ensured we
are opted out of that.
''Inflation and interest rates have been kept under very firm control
and, by the actions of this Governmment, we have ensured that companies
are able to plan ahead with very considerable confidence.''
Speaking on behalf of the Invest in Fife inward investment
partnership, which attracted Canon to the new town, Glenrothes
Development Corporation's general manager, Mr John McCombie, said: ''We
are delighted by Canon's decision to expand in Glenrothes, as it is a
major endorsement for the area.''
Canon expects to recruit a variety of skilled, semi-skilled and junior
trainee workers from the Glenrothes area.

<TEXT>
THE Duchess of York looks set to share in a multi-million pound
marketing bonanza after the sale of her Budgie helicopter cartoon
character to American television.
The duchess, who recently complained that she was having a hard time
managing as a single mother, could net part of an estimated #300m in
earnings, over five years, from the lucrative US market in Budgie toys,
T-shirts and other spin-offs.
It follows the signing yesterday of an #813,000 deal between Sleepy
Kids plc and the FOX Children's Network to screen the show in America.
However, a spokeswoman for the duchess said speculation about what the
deal could mean to her was ''wildly incorrect''.
She added: ''The duchess is really immensely proud that FOX has chosen
to show Budgie and support it in this way.''
Mr Martin Powell, chairman of Amersham-based Sleepy Kids -- the
company set up to market Budgie -- said: ''I imagine the duchess must be
delighted.
''The US merchandising market is massive. It accounts for 75% of world
sales. It is a considerable opportunity.''
Some 18 companies had signed deals to produce goods under licence --
even before the television deal was done, he said.
But he would not say how much the duchess would gain from the deal.
She does not own shares in the company but is paid royalties for use of
the character.
FOX is the largest US children's channel, reaching an audience of 35
million a month. It screens top-rated shows such as Power Rangers.
Sleepy Kids said British actors' voices would continue to be used for
the show and it would not be Americanised.

A 13-YEAR-OLD boy spoke yesterday of his terror when he was mauled by
a crazed dog.
Paul Lamb was speaking from hospital following plastic surgery on
multiple wounds on his legs after the dog -- believed to have been a pit
bull terrier -- attacked him on Wednesday.
Paul, of Liverpool, was visiting his sister in the city's Speke area
when the dog, which she was looking after for a friend, pounced on him.
A man hit the dog on the head three times with a hammer, but it still
clung on to him.
Police tried for one hour to subdue the dog, but it was eventually
decided it was so dangerous that a marksman shot it at the scene.

A BUTCHER was found guilty of murdering his son yesterday, and was
sentenced to life.
Patrick Harte, 47, who owns a shop in Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow,
almost took the 21-year-old youth's head off with a carving knife.
Harte's motive for killing his son, whom he described as his
''favourite'', never emerged in the High Court in Glasgow, but his
estranged wife last night revealed that the quiet man was a ''monster in
drink''.
Mrs Maureen Harte, 45, who left him six years ago and who was in court
yesterday, said later: ''He was a tyrant and a bully. We all suffered
years of torment because of his violence.
''He kept knives everywhere and he would often pull them out and
threaten me and our three sons with them when he was drunk. I can never
forgive him.''
Mrs Harte, of Durness Street, Shawlands, Glasgow, was called as a
Crown witness against her husband but declined to speak out. ''I was
terrified to tell the jury of our life of hell with him in case he got
off and came after me.''
During his four-day trial Harte denied killing his son Pat, known as
Rikkie. The jury took just over two hours to find him guilty by a
majority.
The young man was found dying in a pool of blood in February on the
stairs of his father's house in Midlothian Drive, Shawlands, Glasgow.
When police arrived Harte was sitting in silence beside him, covered
in his son's blood.
The knife had cut through the throat and neck and only the spine was
holding his head on.
There were suggestions during the trial that an intruder could have
been responsible for the murder.
Harte told the jury that he wakened from a drunken sleep to find his
dying son, who usually lived nearby with his mother.
The knife was found by police steeped in a bowl of hot water in the
kitchen. The court also heard the murder weapon had been in Harte's
jacket pocket hanging in the hall, but there were no signs of a
break-in.
Harte denied a suggestion by Mr William Dunlop, prosecuting, that he
had argued with his son during a drinking session, lost his temper, and
killed him.
Harte showed no emotion as Lord Abernethy jailed him for life.

DOCTORS are divided over a British Medical Journal report which is
said to demonstrate the limitations of drugs used to treat HIV.
It shows that drugs like Ziduvodine ward off Aids for longer, but the
patients then die more quickly than those who have received no
treatment.
The finding is based on a study of more than 400 new patients
attending St Mary's Hospital in London, one of Europe's leading centres
of Aids research and treatment.
Nearly one quarter had Aids-defining illnesses at the time of their
first positive HIV-test, and therefore had received no treatment.
The others had been diagnosed HIV positive up to 10 years earlier and
nearly half had been taking Ziduvodine; two thirds were also receiving
prophylactic drugs against Aids-related pneumonia.
The study showed that a patient who had not received drugs would
progress to Aids about a year sooner than a patient who had, but would
then go on to live with Aids for a year longer -- in other words the
overall life-span from infection would be the same.
The implications have worried some doctors who fear that people in
high risk groups, like gay males, may question the value of treatment
and being tested.
The report points out that people who become HIV postive without
finding out until they become ill, perhaps years later, are a challenge
to the control of the spread of HIV.
Dr Mark Poznansky, one of the researchers, said yesterday: ''When we
submitted this article some in the medical establishment thought it
should be suppressed because they are trying to encourage people to have
medical intervention.
''The most striking thing about the finding is that while you have to
say we are not increasing quantity of life, you are getting more
Aids-free life.
''As far as getting an HIV test is concerned the message is still the
same. But the balance is getting fine. If you develop one significant
side-effect from an intervention drug it negates any benefit you would
get from delaying the onset of Aids. ''We have to sell intervention and
we have to sell testing. People who care about infecting their partners
will get tested, but if that altruistic motive isn't there, there has to
be an incentive to be tested, in the shape of effective intervention.''

A NEW forum has been established to co-ordinate a management strategy
to clean-up the Firth of Forth.
The voluntary body involves 170 organisations and individuals from
industry and commerce, recreation and conservation agencies.
It hopes to work with the Scottish Office to manage the problems
caused by industrial pollution, agricultural nitrates and pesticides,
and sewage discharge.
The Edinburgh and Lothian group of the Marine Conservation Society
yesterday launched an Adopt a Beach campaign backed by the forum, urging
people to alter their waste disposal habits, monitor local beaches, and
clean them up.
A recent survey of coastal litter around Britain found there were
almost 3000 items of debris on a 1.5km stretch of the Firth of Forth
shoreline -- the UK average was under 1000 items per kilometre.
With 75% of necessary sewage treatment work along the estuary either
completed or underway, only 40% of the Forth's coastal water now fails
to meet the quality standards required by EU legislation.
Mr Steve Sankey, head of policy at the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, and vice-chairman of the forum, said there are
three priorities -- discharges from either households or at sea, and
fisheries management.

FOUR cancer patients were infected with Hepatitis B from a fifth
patient after a leakage from clinical freezer bags being used to store
their bone marrow in liquid nitrogen.
The incident, revealed today in the Lancet, involved patients at
University College Hospital, London, who had undergone autologous bone
marrow transplant -- their own marrow was removed and stored, to be
replaced after they had undergone cytotoxic drug therapy.
Scottish hospitals are among those still using the make of bags
involved, although different procedures have been introducedThe
infections took place separately over a two-year period and the first
two infections led to a full-scale check-back of donors who might have
given them blood tranfusions.
No connection was found, and as more cases emerged, linked by DNA
testing of the antigen in the patients' blood, attention focused on the
liquid nitrogen tank in which the bone marrow was stored. Detritus from
the tank yielded Hepatitis B virus.
Investigators from the hospital's virology department discovered that
two Hemofreeze bags containing the first patient's cells had ruptured on
removal from the tank -- the probable cause of which was nitrogen
seeping into the bags and then expanding when they were taken out of the
tank.
How the contents of the other bags became contaminated is less clear.
But, if the heat seals had been faulty, liquid nitrogen contaminated by
the first patient's bags might have crept in, said Professor Richard
Tedder, who led the investigation.
Alternatively, if the surface of the bags, including the exit ports,
had been contaminated, the virus could have been passed on through the
intravenous lines during transplantation.
Because it was considered impossible to decontaminate the tank and its
existing contents, no new material has been stored in it.
Patients whose bone marrow was already in the tank were offered
accelerated Hepatitis B immunisation, if their transfusions were
required.
The Medical Devices Directorate has issued a Hazard Warning notice
about the German made Hemofreeze bags, which are supplied by Gambro,
Ltd, of Sidcup.
Around the same time the hospital changed to another bag, the Cryocyte
made by Baxter Health Care. However, it is understand from industry
sources that Hemofreeze bags occupy a large, if not dominant share in
the Scottish market. They were the first of their type to became
commercially available.
Professor Tedder said last night: ''The fact that we switched bags was
for other reasons, coincidental to the infection incident.
''New procedures have been introduced for using the Hemofreeze bags
and they are acceptable if used properly.

LABOUR leaders are understood to have warned train drivers, whose

today, that they can expect no public support from the party.
This will be in line with ''New Labour's'' arm's length treatment of
traditional union allies and is designed to head off the inevitable Tory
attacks should Labour be seen to condone industrial action.
It is understood this message has been conveyed to Aslef general
secretary Lew Adams in recent meetings with Deputy Labour Leader John
Prescott and Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher.
All but a handfull of BR services are expected to be at a standstill
today and next Tuesday as Aslef seeks to force BR to improve its
''final'' 3% pay offer. Further 24-hour strikes are planned for July 27,
August 8 and 25, and September 12.
Meanwhile, the prospect of major disruption for air travellers over
the August Bank Holiday in England and Wales receded last night when the
threat of a strike ballot involving 20,000 British Airways staff was
lifted.
The move followed talks between the airline and officials of the
Transport and General Workers Union, in which it was agreed that any
changes to BA's national pay bargaining arrangements would be subject to
union agreement.
The union had called the ballot in protest at moves to devolve
bargaining to 22 business units.
All major airlines flying out of Scottish airports said they would
gauge extra demand due to the rail strike during the day, but could lay
on larger aircraft depending on bookings. Travel agents predicted around
100,000 Scots would depart on summer holidays this weekend, 30,000 from
Glasgow airport today.
British Airways said it had a number of 757 and 767 aircraft on
standby, which can carry between 50 to 100 extra passengers. The airline
said its passenger figures rose by 5% after last year's strike by signal
workers.
British Midland said it also intended to fly larger aircraft, but said
additional flights were not possible because of the problem of booking
landing slots at Heathrow Airport.
Other passengers left stranded by the strike will be catered for by
bus and coach companies anxious to snap up the extra custom. Rival
operators confirmed they intend to lay on all available transport around
and out of Scotland. Some predicted snatching and retaining a
significant amount of rail business as a consequence of the stoppages.
The strike days coincide with a number of major Scottish events,
including the start of the Glasgow Fair fortnight, the Cutty Sark Tall
Ships Race at Leith, which is expected to attract one million visitors,
and the Scottish Open golf tournament at Carnoustie.
Keen to cater for the larger than usual numbers of travellers, bus
companies said they intended to run a number of duplicate services
parallel to ScotRail routes. Bus station staff reported they had dealt
with an avalanche of enquiries.
Stagecoach said its operators would respond to demand, with Fife
Scottish running larger vehicles and doubling the number of buses
between Fife and Edinburgh. Mr Alasdair Henderson, general manager of
Scottish Citylink, said every available bus would be on the road. Extra
buses will also run between Glasgow and Ayrshire.
Strathclyde Transport emphasised that the Glasgow Underground would be
operating as normal on strike days.
For travellers who make it south to the Channel Tunnel, Eurostar said
its service from London to Paris and Brussels would be operating as
usual, although early morning trains have been cancelled because of
Bastille Day in France.

A CONSULTANT pathologist has been suspended from duty after
allegations that he mis-diagnosed samples from hundreds of patients at
six hospitals, including one in Scotland.
The Department of Health last night said an investigation was being
held into the work of Dr Samuel Kiberu, 43, who is employed at a
hospital in Lincolnshire.
It is understood that, for two weeks in 1991, he worked as a relief
consultant in the county laboratory at the Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy.
He is believed to have examined specimens from more than 250 patients
from Fife.
An apparent error is thought to have been found in one case, but
officials from the Kirkcaldy Acute Hospital Trust are believed to have
informed the patient involved that it had caused no detrimental effect.
A review of every other sample seen by Dr Kiberu found no errors.
The health department investigation will also focus on diagnoses made
at hospitals in Nottinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Grimsby and two in
Lincolnshire, including Grantham and Kesteven, where nurse Beverley
Allitt killed four children.
A spokesman for the department said: ''We are aware of inquiries going
on into Dr Kiberu's work and that Ministers have asked for a full report
from all the health authorities involved. All the hospitals will be
reviewing their patient records.''
Mr Munro Donald, chief executive of Bassetlaw Hospital, said: ''I and
all of the hospital staff are very upset that it was necessary to have
all of Dr Kiberu's work reviewed which resulted in a number of errors
being identified. As a consequence we have had to ask that 15 patients
or their relatives contact us in order that we can review their
treatment.''
Mr Donald added: ''We don't believe anyone being treated at this
hospital has died as a result of his mistakes.'' He said ''one or two
errors'' came to light while Dr Kiberu was working as a locum
pathologist at the hospital, two days a week, for a six-month spell
which ended in March 1993.
All 1509 specimens taken by Dr Kiberu at Bassetlaw were sent away for
further diagnosis, but Mr Donald pointed out that many of the 127 errors
which came to light did not affect patients adversely.
''For instance, some cervical smears were borderline and patients
would be brought back for a second smear when in fact they were
negative. It would have caused unnecessary worry and inconvenience to
the patients, but no harm,'' said Mr Donald.

MILLIONS of tiny Australian spider beetles have invaded St Andrews and
taken up residence in the town hall.
Now, St Andrews Town Hall, which also incorporates the Fife town's
recently-opened children's library, will have to be closed down until
specialist contractors clear out the pests.
The dramatic increase in the pigeon population in the town centre has
been blamed for the plague, which has also affected the Burgh Chambers
and an adjacent Masonic Lodge.
North East Fife District Council has confirmed that several areas of
the building, including the children's library on the ground floor, and
the premises occupied by Lodge St Andrew No 23, are being overrun by the
pests.
The epidemic does not have public health implications, but is being
regarded as ''a nuisance'' by the council's environmental health
department.
Mr John Stark, depute director of environmental health, said yesterday
that the pigeon population in the area of the town hall had ''got out of
hand'' and the infestation by the beetles, which feed on the birds'
droppings, was the result.
Mr Andrew Kydd, director of recreation with the district council, said
that steps would now be taken to control the numbers of pigeons roosting
in the town hall towers, which would be cleaned, and the affected
buildings fumigated.
Work is expected to begin almost immediately, and the buildings will
be closed to members of the public.

A BATTERED husband was driven to an attempted armed robbery by the
violence and nagging of his domineering wife.
The High Court in Inverness heard that Phillip Wardle, 28, tried to
rob Ballindalloch Post Office in Aberdeenshire with a toy pistol last
October.
He pointed the imitation gun at postmistress Mrs Margaret Weddell and
demanded the money from the till. But she told him: ''Go away, shoo'',
and he obliged. Three hours later Wardle, of High Street, New Pitsligo,
phoned police to confess.
The court was told that Wardle and his wife, Pamela, ran up debts of
more than #10,000 in their six-year marriage, which saw Wardle
constantly emotionally and physically abused. In one attack, the court
was told, he was hit by a frying pan.
The gun was a Christmas present to one of his two sons, who both have
cerebral palsy. Defence advocate Mrs Mhairi Richards said Wardle feared
for the boys' safety, because his wife admitted that they were at risk
from her because she couldn't cope.
The crime happened in a moment of madness while Wardle, a fish
processing factory worker, was driving about after he had ''chickened
out'' of going into Fraserburgh JobCentre to seek a better-paid job
after his wife had threatened to leave him.
Advocate-depute Mr Bill Totten said Wardle put on his boiler-suit,
placed a factory hygienic hat and hair-net over his head and face, and
grabbed the toy gun.
Mrs Richards said that Wardle had since attempted to kill himself.
''He is a very honest man and he says law-abiding. In fact, he
reported his new girlfriend, Aileen Tait, to police because she had been
drinking and driving. But she is standing by him, and has helped pay off
some of his debt.''
Mrs Richards said Wardle had a history of being in and out of work
because of his wife and his fear for the children while they were in her
care.
Lord Prosser agreed it was a most unusual case. Sentence was deferred
to the High Court in Glasgow on August 3, and Wardle was released on
bail.

THE Government yesterday appointed a leading QC to carry out a
statutory inquiry into allegations of nepotism in recruitment at
Monklands District Council.
However, Mr William Nimmo Smith, who previously conducted an inquiry
into the Scottish legal establishment, confirmed that his terms of
reference would prevent him delving into affairs in Monklands before
1990, and his work might barely be completed before the authority is
disbanded as a result of local government reorganisation.
''My remit is quite clear and self-contained,'' he said. ''It is to
ascertain if Monklands District Council has complied with the
requirements of section 7 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989,
to appoint staff on merit.''
He made clear that since that law came into force on January 16, 1990,
he would not be considering appointments to the authority before that
date, nor would he be able to examine any other allegations involving
Monklands, such as claims of a spending imbalance between Airdrie and
Coatbridge.
Mr Nimmo Smith will have the power to summon witnesses and force them
to speak on oath, with the threat of fines or even prison if they
refuse, but he said he hoped to proceed on the basis of consent.
He said: ''It is too early to say precisely the form that the inquiry
will take but, basically, I envisage a two-stage process -- firstly
information gathering and secondly a more formal stage for taking
evidence in public.
''I am aware that there will be many in the Monklands area who wish to
see a speedy conclusion to this exercise. I can assure them that it is
certainly my intention to strive for an outcome which is fast and
fair.''
However, Mr Nimmo Smith -- who conducted the inquiry which cleared the
Scottish legal hierarchy of so-called ''Magic Circle'' allegations of
collusion between homosexual judges, prosecutors, and accused --
conceded yesterday that his work could last into the new year, taking us
close to the time, next spring, when the authority is disbanded.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch said he was more than
confident that Mr Nimmo Smith would be capable of a swift and thorough
investigation. ''I hope the results of the inquiry can be available just
as soon as possible,'' he said.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''This could have
been done two years ago, but we are glad it is happening now. The main
thing is that he gets to the bottom of the allegations.''
However, the council's SNP group leader, Mr Graham Russell, was
dismissive: ''Everyone knows the Tories are only interested in playing
in Labour's Monkland's midden to score cheap political points, but the
problem is one of Labour's creation and it is Labour's responsibility to
clean it up.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the inquiry should
have been set up two years ago, but had been milked by the Government
for party advantage.
''I hope that Mr Nimmo Smith will be able to complete a thorough
investigation as quickly as possible,'' he said.
''It cannot be good for the people of Monklands for this issue to
rumble on any longer than necessary.''
Last month, Mr Nimmo Smith was appointed a temporary Court of Session
judge.

MINISTERS have been forced to reconsider the controversial nursery
voucher scheme after playgroup leaders threatened a boycott.
They are furious that #1100 vouchers due to be offered to parents may
only be worth #550 to them.
Mrs Margaret Lochrie, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning
Alliance, accused the Government of trying to get nursery provision ''on
the cheap''.
Yesterday the Department for Education and Employment said Ministers
were ''reconsidering'' the way the scheme would work.
Mrs Lochrie said unless the rules were changed the PLA would advise
its 20,000 playgroups not to take part.
A boycott would be deeply embarrassing for Ministers, who have been at
pains to stress that expanding nursery education will not ''crowd out''
voluntary and private providers.
Mrs Lochrie said it had become clear that playgroups offering five
half-day sessions a week would only be able to redeem vouchers for #550.
The DFEE made it clear yesterday that parents would then be able to
use the rest of the value of the voucher to buy other provision
elsewhere.
Playgroups offering 10 half-day sessions would qualify for the full
value of the voucher.
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard made no direct
mention of half-value vouchers in her announcement to Parliament last
week.
She told the Commons the #1100 voucher would buy five half-days in
''any independent, voluntary or state sector institution providing
nursery education'' or ''up to a full-time place in a playgroup''.
Critics of nursery vouchers were quick to seize on the row.
Liberal Democrat education spokesman Don Foster said it was clear the
Government's ''much vaunted market system is being heavily rigged to cut
costs''.

CELTIC Football Club is certain to face further delays in its bid to
open its new #18m stand for the start of the season.
Councillor James Mullen, of Glasgow District Council, has requested a
postponement of any planning decision to allow consultation with local
residents and interested parties.
The so-called ''visit and hearing'' -- which will be officially called
for at a special planning meeting a week today -- is expected to delay a
planning decision for up to a further two weeks, until the beginning of
August.
Yet the club is due to face Newcastle United in a pre-season friendly
to mark the opening of the ground on August 5. The club is said to be
desperate to have the ground fully operational by that date.
Mr Peter McLean, Celtic public relations manager, insisted that even a
further two-week delay for a visit and hearing would not stall the
opening plans.
Mr McLean said: ''The local community and regulatory bodies have been
involved in consultation at every step of the building process. The club
is confident that all the issues with regard to planning, access and
construction will be resolved in time for the start of the season.
''If there are any visits to the site, or further information is
requested, the club is confident everything will progress within a
timescale which enables the stadium to open for the start of the
season.''
But Mr McLean said he could not anticipate any decision of the
planning committee.
The club was granted planning permission for the 26,000-seat stand in
September last year on the basis that Janefield Street was not used for
access except in an emergency.
However, the granting of a safety certificate was put in doubt when
police expressed concerns that only using the narrow Celtic Walkway by
Janefield Street for up to 13,000 fans could cause crowd safety
problems.
This forced the club to return to Glasgow District Council in a bid to
overturn the condition that Janefield Street is not used by supporters.
Use of the street has been strongly opposed by local residents who fear
disruption on match days.
The matter will be dealt with at a special planning committee, which
sits during council recess, and has the power to approve or reject the
change, or to hold a visit and hearing.
Planning convener councillor Hugh Macrae confirmed that the local
councillor had asked for a visit and hearing, which would be granted.
He said: ''It is to take in the concerns of the police over the use of
Celtic Walkway -- that's a piece of ground that Celtic bought years ago.
It will be used by fans leaving the new stand. The police are very
anxious. They feel that if anything happened there would be a delay in
them getting to the root of the trouble.''
Mr Macrae added: ''The whole application has got to be handled very
quickly. The month of July is when the council is in recess. And
planning meetings take place more often than normal, really as business
comes up.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council, which issues safety
certificates, said: ''The region is waiting to hear from the district
council and the police about whether access should have a bearing on
safety but our remit only covers the stadium itself, not the access
routes.''
He did not anticipate any problems with issuing the certificate.
* It is understood an application for Airdrie FC to build a new
10,000-seat stadium on green-belt land at Raebog Road will be approved
subject to conditions at a Strathclyde Regional Council planning
committee next month.

A JOURNALIST yesterday told how he reported on a horrific road
accident that left four people dead, without knowing his own parents
were among the victims.
Three pedestrians were killed on Wednesday when Mr Kenneth Burton, 60,
a florist, collapsed at the wheel of his delivery van, which careered
across the road onto a pavement in Reedley, near Burnley, Lancashire.
Mr Kim Pilling, 23, a reporter on the Burnley Express, had driven past
the scene and interviewed grieving relatives of one of the victims, Mrs
Ivy Waddington, 66. Her grandson, Craig, who was thought to have been
walking beside her, escaped with grazes.
Mr Pilling was among reporters who were given details of a couple who
were killed with their dog and whom police could not identify.
It was only when he heard descriptions on an evening TV news bulletin
that he realised they could be his parents, Rodney, 45, and Marie, 44.
Mr Pilling, of Queen Victoria Road, Burnley, said: ''I am just
completely shocked. When I was out there I just never knew.
''The police said my mum died straight away, and although my dad was
taken to hospital, there was just nothing they could do.''
He said he had tried telephoning his parents at their home in Chatburn
Park Drive, Brierfield, during the day, but could only get the answering
machine.
After hearing the descriptions he went to their house and found the
car in the garage and their pet dog missing. He contacted police before
identifying his parents last night.

A GULF war veteran, on the run from his regiment, who held up a bank
with a sawn-off shotgun was jailed for five years yesterday.
There were striking parallels between Roberts, 26, and Bonnyrigg bank
robber Robert Smith, jailed for life for gunning down a 63-year-old who
tackled him as he fled with #185,000. Both were lance-corporals in the
Life Guards with excellent service records, both served in the Gulf,
both later went Awol, and neither had previous convictions.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Roberts admitted robbing the
Clydesdale Bank in Castle Street, Tayport, Fife, on March 29 of #4167
after threatening staff with the gun.
The court heard Roberts, in clear view of police, emptied the cash
into the river Tay. He then sat for about 15 minutes, before, from a
stairway leading to the Tay bridge, fired his gun in the air, signalling
police to back off. He then threw it into the Tay and surrendered.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, said he had received a series of
commendations, but after the Gulf war, his marriage collapsed and it was
announced his regiment was to be amalgamated. He felt betrayed and in
the summer of 1992 failed to return to the regiment. He joined the
Foreign Legion and served in Bosnia. On his return to Britain he was
held by the Army under open arrest but went on the run.

THE grandparents of six-year-old Bradley last night spoke out against
the ''heart-breaking'' court decision and pledged the fight by their son
to gain access to the child would go on.
''They're killing him,'' Mrs Winifred Sanderson said of her son, who
is presently on holiday in Majorca. ''I don't know how he'll cope with
it.''
Mrs Sanderson, 62, praised Lord McCluskey and added: ''Now we have a
judge on our side. If our son had been a tearaway, I would have seen the
point of the decision -- but he's not.
''He's a damn good father and will be broken-hearted. If it takes to
my dying breath, that wee laddie will find out who his daddy is.''
Speaking at their home at Craigs Park, Corstorphine, Mr James
Sanderson, 61, said his son, before he left on holiday, had appeared
more confident that the courts would support him.
He said: ''He only wants access, for goodness sake, for a few hours.
What is wrong with that?''
Mrs Sanderson spoke of the ''stormy relationship'' of the couple who
had known each other since their early teens and who lived together for
a time at a house in the city's Carrickknowe area.
She said suggestions that her son, a master plumber who now stays in
the Crewe Toll area of the city, had hit Bradley were untrue and spoke
of an incident some years ago when the boy had been returned to his
mother with a mark on his face.
''My 18-month-old niece was playing in the house here and she took one
of Bradley's cars. He said it was his and she grabbed his face and put a
mark on it.
''Stuart has never abused his son. He's never laid a hand on him or
let him down,'' said Mrs Sanderson, who described the moment on a
previous occasion when her son had heard he would not be allowed to see
his child.
''Have you ever seen anybody with dead eyes? We were frightened to
leave him. He was in a daze.''
Mrs Sanderson told how just before Christmas last year she and her
husband had gone to see their only grandson at his Leith school.
The encounter had ended with Bradley embracing them, but later that
evening they had received a telephone call from a police officer saying
the mother had complained.
Just before Christmas this year they had gone to the school with a
present for him. However, this time, said Mrs Sanderson, Bradley had
shouted at them that they had come to take him away.
She said: ''I've never seen a child look so petrified. I call that
cruelty. A week later we got a letter from his mother's lawyers asking
us not to see Bradley at school.''
Ms McManus was not available for comment at her Leith home yesterday.

MILLIONAIRE former Tory MP Sir Peter Morrison, who died early
yesterday, aged 51, was parliamentary private secretary to Margaret
Thatcher and a key campaign official during the fateful leadership
battle which led to her downfall in 1990.
Sir Peter, an outspoken right-winger who was for years a trusted
member of the Thatcher inner circle, did not entirely escape the blame
for her failure to secure an outright win on the first ballot.
He held a variety of posts during his relatively brief sojourn at
Westminster as MP for the City of Chester. He was elected in February
1974 but did not contest the 1992 General Election. His elder brother,
Sir Charles, was MP for Devizes.
His death, of a heart attack, was confirmed by the office of his
successor as MP for the City of Chester, Gyles Brandreth.
Sir Peter has been described as of ''solid build and florid
joviality'' with ''self-confidence enough to overcome an embarrassing
shortage of forensic power''.
He was educated at Eton and Keble College, Oxford, and he entered the
Commons as the youngest Tory MP in England.
Margaret Thatcher appointed him an assistant whip in 1976, and he was
the first whip to tell her that the Callaghan government had lost its
vote of confidence in April 1979.
Sir Peter was appointed a whip and in 1981 became under-secretary,
Employment, winning Opposition fury by announcing that he was winding up
16 training boards. He was later promoted to Minister of State,
Employment.
In September 1985 he became Minister for Industry, but was dropped
after a year to become deputy chairman of the party. His organisational
skills were always regarded as superior to his ability as a debater.
Sir Peter then became Minister of State, Energy.
He was moved in July 1990 to become Margaret Thatcher's parliamentary
private secretary, only a few months before she was forced out of
office.
Sir Peter was awarded a knighthood in Margaret Thatcher's resignation
honours. He was unmarried.

ALL future contact between a six-year-old boy and his father should be
permanently severed, two judges have ruled.
However, in a powerful dissenting judgment, Lord McCluskey described
the decision as ''extraordinary'' and said there was no justification
for keeping Mr Stuart Sanderson apart from his son, Bradley.
He also strongly criticised a Sheriff and the Sheriff Principal of
Lothian and Borders for failing to show commonsense or a sense of
reality in the case.
Mr Sanderson, of Craigs Park, Corstorphine, Edinburgh, and Bradley's
mother, Ms Shoneagh McManus, of St Clair Place, Leith, lived together
for a number of years until 1991 when Ms McManus left with the child.
There has been a lengthy legal battle over access and in August 1993
Sheriff Andrew Lothian at Edinburgh issued a decision refusing the
father any right to see Bradley.
Mr Sanderson appealed to the Sheriff Principal, who heard a number of
allegations against him, including one that he had struck his son on the
face during a meeting at an access centre.
There were also claims that on various occasions after access, Bradley
had made derogatory and abusive remarks about his mother and behaved
aggressively both at home and at school, which was out of character.
The Sheriff Principal, Mr Gordon Nicholson, QC, decided that Sheriff
Lothian's decision on access should be upheld and the father appealed to
three Judges in the Court of Session.
Yesterday, Lord Weir and Lord Brand agreed that access should be
denied to Mr Sanderson.
Lord Weir said that the question which the Sheriff Court had to
consider was whether or not, looking above all to the welfare of
Bradley, an order for access should be made.
In Lord Weir's view, the Sheriff Principal had been amply justified in
expressing the opinion that access by the father was not beneficial and
might be potentially harmful.
The information before both the Sheriff and Sheriff Principal
justified their conclusion that access should not be allowed.
However, Lord McCluskey said the proceedings in the Sheriff Court had
produced a result which was ''quite literally, extraordinary''.
He said: ''All links, all contacts between a small boy and his father
are to be severed permanently.''
This was extraordinary because, normally, the courts would proceed
upon the basis that the natural and instinctive link between a child and
its parents was so important and abiding that it should be preserved
unless there were very strong reasons to the contrary.
''It is a link which is properly understood to have value quite
independently of any supposed 'right' in a parent to obtain from a court
of law an order allowing 'access' to his or her child.''
He said no-one would argue that a parent had an absolute right to
access, but: ''It is abundantly clear that this link is not to be
severed simply because a parent is thought to have behaved foolishly or
even badly and, thus, somehow to have forfeited his 'right'.
''If it were simply a question of a parent's right which could be
forfeited by his reprehensible behaviour, that would mean that the child
could be deprived of all contact with a natural parent through no fault
on the part of the child, but simply because the parent had behaved in a
way of which the court disapproved.''
In his opinion, the facts in this case did not warrant the conclusion
that Bradley's welfare would be promoted by severing the link with his
father.
Lord McCluskey stated: ''I disagree entirely with the conclusion my
brother judges appear to have reached, that the Sheriffs have both
adopted the proper test and their decisions represent an exercise of
discretion with which the court is not entitled to interfere.
''We have a situation in which a father and his young son, now aged
six, have been denied all contact with each other for two years on the
basis of a few trivial matters which neither the Sheriff nor the Sheriff
Principal has evaluated with any commonsense or sense of reality.
''Neither has given any real weight to the child's 'right' to know his
own father. The important factor of the preservation of the paternal
link is given no express attention or weight.
''In my opinion, it is plain that access should be allowed. No
sufficient reason has been given for preventing this child from
continuing to meet his own father and his father's family.''

A GLAMOROUSLY revamped Edinburgh Film Festival was launched yesterday
with a cast that includes Steve Martin, Jerry Lewis and Leslie Carron.
This year's programme comprises six new sections and promises
appearances by more celebrities than in any of the event's previous 48
years.
The festival, which runs from August 13-27, will make use of every
cinema in Edinburgh in its aim to make itself more accessible.
Another innovation is the Galas strand: this year there will be at
least two gala presentations a day, with these spots reserved mainly for
British and European premieres.
The festival will open and close with new British films: acclaimed
director Ken Loach's Land and Freedom and Peter Chelsom's Funny Bones, a
comedy that boasts the unlikely casting combination of Jerry Lewis, Lee
Evans and Leslie Caron.
In an endeavour to get away from what festival director Mark Cousins
called ''the superficials'', another of the festival's strands will be a
series of 90-minute forums called Scene By Scene.
Every night, a big name in the film world will be armed with remote
control in order that he, or she, can talk an audience through one of
his or her movies, as it is shown.
Among those participating will be Steve Martin, Diane Ladd, the Coen
Brothers and Nic Roeg.
Another impressive new section is entitled Rosebud, a series of
premieres of work from across the world -- often of a radical nature and
mostly low budget.
As most of the films shown in this strand are not on the regular
festival circuit, this will be a unique opportunity to sample the
cinemas of countries as diverse as Tajikistan, Japan, India, Iceland and
Scotland.
Work featured in this category will qualify for the new addition to
the film festival's list of awards: the Channel 4 Director's Award.
The veteran Hollywood director and choreographer Stanley Donen is the
subject of a major 14-film retrospective which aims to provide the first
full assessment of a career whose highlights include On the Town,
Singing In the Rain, Funny Face, Charade, and Bedazzled.
Donen has pulled out of the festival because he is busy working on his
first film in a decade -- an adaptation of A R Gurney's Love Letters. He
will respond to the retrospective in an interview with BBC Scotland, to
be shown after the festival.
Another new event-within-the-event is New British Expo, which will
present a comprehensive programme of British films made over the last
year to an audience of buyers, funders, programmers and others in the
industry. It will also include daily forums on different aspects of film
production and distribution.
The festival is again hosting a Young People's Film Festival, which
will be made up of workshops; a Scene by Scene by director Antonia Bird,
and various screenings, including the European premiere of the latest
American hit version of A Little Princess.
Festival producer Ginnie Atkinson also announced yesterday that the
Scottish Film Council had increased its grant to the festival by
#13,500, making its total contribution this year #75,000.

<HEADLINE>Graham to pay penalty with one year ban</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977404202</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER Arsenal manager George Graham has been banished from football
for a year by the Football Association, after being found guilty on
Wednesday of misconduct over transfer ''bungs''.
Graham, 50, was found guilty after a three-day hearing before three FA
commissioners, and last night they delivered their sentence: ''George
Graham has been suspended from all football activity until June 30,
1996. In addition he is to pay a part of the costs of the case.''
No figure has been put on the latter sanction but, with three
barristers and seven other lawmen involved in the Watford commission,
costs of pursuing the first major figure in the ''bungs'' controversy
could easily exceed six figures.
The FA will contact FIFA today to inform it of the measures taken
against Graham, and will expect the game's governing body to endorse the
suspension and to police it worldwide.
There was no immediate response from Graham, who was bitterly
disappointed with the verdict, but may regard the punishment as
acceptable.
He has 14 days to appeal but, after spending thousands of pounds
trying in vain to clear his name, he may now seize the chance to
resurrect his career the season after next.
Graham is the first major English league manager to be banned in this
manner since Don Revie -- the former Leeds and England chief -- in 1977.
His suspension also exceeds the lengthy punishment, effectively almost
eight months, imposed on Manchester United star Eric Cantona after he
assaulted a Crystal Palace fan last season.
Unlike the Frenchman, who was actively encouraged to coach children
during his ban and allowed to play in charity matches, Graham will be
expected to stay clear of the game.
The commission defined ''football activity'' as ''all or any
involvement in football administration, management, or coaching,
including the signing and transfer of players.''
Former Arsenal colleague Frank McLintock, who played alongside Graham
in the 1970-71 double-winning side, hit out at the severity of the
punishment: ''It's a long time to be out of the game. I don't think that
was lenient at all.''
The League Managers' Association also leapt to Graham's defence and
condemned the punishment, saying he should have been fined, not banned
from football for a year.
Its chairman Howard Wilkinson, the Leeds manager who gave a character
reference for Graham, said most managers would think the punishment
extremely harsh.
In a prepared statement on behalf of the association, Wilkinson said:
''Loss of his job at Arsenal, heavy defence costs, and six months out of
work have probably cost George #1.5m already.
''The price he has already paid, plus perhaps an appropriate fine,
should have been sufficient.''
However, the three ''bungbusters'' -- chief executive Rick Parry,
managers' representative Steve Coppell, and Mr Robert Reid, QC -- will
no doubt be delighted with the FA verdict and sentence, which followed
their months of painstaking detective work.
Their inquiries, as revealed by the FA, continue with a second interim
report expected next month. While it is unlikely to be as explosive as
the Graham document in February, it will contain fresh findings.
Meanwhile, the Premiership authorities confirmed last night they are
willing to accept Graham back into their managerial ranks when he has
served his time.

As Dick Douglas prepares for his new role as watchdog Ken Smith charts
his busy career.
DICK Douglas's political involvement began with water -- but not the
type you could drink. As a boy growing up in Glasgow's Govan he followed
many of his mates into the shipyards where, at the age of 18, he led his
fellow apprentices out on strike.
However, it was not until the latter years of his political career
that he really made waves by leaving the Labour Party, and remaining in
Parliament as first an independent and then as a Scottish National Party
MP.
At the last election, Labour breathed a sigh of relief when their
irritant former son was defeated when he stood against the then Shadow
Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar in Glasgow Garscadden.
But they should have known that was not the last of Dick Douglas. His
hobby, after all, has been running marathons. The marathon career of
Dick Douglas has a bit more mileage in it yet.
Although he led a shipyard strike, Dick Douglas was not one of those
hail fellows well met, which shipyard union leaders seem to portray
themselves as latterly. Douglas left the yards and studied at the
Co-operative College before eventually becoming a lecturer at Dundee
College of Technology.
He stood three times for Parliament for the Labour Party, which he had
joined at the age of 16, before finally becoming MP for Clackmannan and
East Stirling in 1970 and later for Dunfermline West following boundary
changes.
What could have been a leisurely life on the back benches ended with
the poll tax. Douglas, although glibly dismissed as a right-winger in
the party, could not go along with his party refusing to back a
non-payment campaign on the poll tax.
He resigned the party Whip in 1990, and stood against the party in the
local council elections, narrowly failing to unseat the local Labour
councillor of 20 years standing.
From there he took the next step of joining the SNP, which at the time
was putting up a more spirited campaign against the poll tax. The SNP
was delighted as it raised their parliamentary representation to five.
Labour of course tried to dismiss him as an irrelevance.
After his General Election defeat, he continued his political activity
by standing unsuccessfully for the SNP in the Euro-elections. Latterly
he became the SNP's trade and industry spokesman.
At the age of 63, many people would have thought he would be taking a
less active role. But that's not Dick Douglas's way.
As he said when he stood for his local council against the Labour
Party candidate: ''I can walk down here and no-one will be able to point
a finger and say: 'You ran away Dick Douglas'.''
Far from running away, Dick Douglas is back for what he will no doubt
hope is a lap of honour in trying to protect the Scottish public against
unwarranted changes in controlling Scotland's water.
Last night, after being appointed chairman of the new watchdog body,
the Water and Sewerage Customers Council, he predicted a degree of
''constructive tension'' between the new boards and the customers'
council.
However, he said the watchdog body had a very important role to play
in safeguarding the interest of the consumer.

THE personal office of Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine is more
than twice the size of the Prime Minister's, it was revealed last night.
Mr Heseltine's room on the third floor of the Cabinet Office at 70
Whitehall has a total area of 872 sq ft, while Mr Major's personal
office around the corner at 10 Downing Street measures only 370 sq ft.
Details emerged in a series of written replies from the Prime Minister
and Mr Heseltine to Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce.
They gave further details of Mr Heseltine's new office and role, and
showed that ten telephone lines had already been installed for the
Deputy Prime Minister.
Mr Bruce commented: ''This extraordinary information just shows who is
now in control in Downing Street, and the enormous price Mr Major has
had to pay to keep his job.
''Mr Heseltine now has an office as large as his own ego, and a phone
bank large enough to mount a Conservative leadership bid from.
''At this rate, Mr Major will be in the broom cupboard on the outer
extremes of Whitehall within months.
''Taxpayers will be furious at having to pay for two Prime
Ministers.''
In another written reply, Mr Major confirmed that Mr Heseltine would
stand in for him at Prime Minister's question time when he himself could
not be present -- normally when on foreign trips.
Prior to the appointment of the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the
Commons Tony Newton usually spoke for Mr Major in the House.

MUSLIM refugees claimed yesterday that Bosnian Serb forces raped women
and shot young men in the Srebrenica enclave, before driving its
inhabitants out in one of the largest expulsions of the Bosnian war.
Tearful women and children, sweltering in the sun at a UN airbase near
Bosnian government-held Tuzla, spoke of panic and terror among thousands
of refugees before they were forced aboard buses at gunpoint by Bosnian
Serbs.
''The Serbs entered the (Dutch UN) base in Potocari (near Srebrenica)
on Wednesday. They walked around and took all the men -- a few (Bosnian)
soldiers and young boys -- behind a building and we heard shots, and
nobody came back,'' said Mirama Mujcic.
The UN said there was no evidence of human rights abuses by the Serbs,
although its High Commissioner for Refugees had testimony suggesting
young women were kidnapped by soldiers.
''While the TV cameras were there the Serbs were good,'' said Zula
Hasanovic. ''Then the media disappeared and the soldiers started taking
people off the buses. We know they raped the girls because some of them
came back and told us, but most of them did not return.''
Thousands of women, children, and old men have now trekked through
no-man's land to reach Bosnian government-held territory after Serb
buses dumped them about six miles from the town of Kladanj.
Some 5000 have been transported, by the government army, 25 miles
north to Tuzla. Officials of the UNHCR said 14,000 people had been
shipped across the front lines by yesterday afternoon, and the air base
was too full to take any more.
The Bosnian government is refusing to provide accommodation for the
refugees, arguing that since the UN failed to protect Srebrenica, a
designated ''safe area'', it should care for those made homeless by its
capture.
UN officials said the expulsion, in which the Serbs are using nearly
100 vehicles, will clear the thousands of refugees in Potocari by this
morning.
The fate of the enclave's menfolk following its fall to the Serbs is
largely unknown. Relief officials said some young men were split from
their families and taken to a football stadium in the nearby Serb-held
town of Bratunac.
No international observers have been allowed near the stadium. The
Bosnian Serbs said they wanted to screen the enclave's defenders for
what they call ''war criminals''. Most are thought to have fled to the
mountains.
Witnesses described the refugees as tired, dirty, hungry, and
miserable. At the airbase, hundreds waited in the open for water,
eventually delivered by fire truck, and told of the terror of their
flight.
''I saw dozens of neighbours giving money to the Serbs to be allowed
to board a bus,'' said Zulfa Redzic, 24, telling how people bribed their
way aboard vehicles in a desperate bid to get away from the Serbs. ''We
were very, very frightened,'' she said.
''We were in the basement for seven days and we haven't eaten
anything,'' said Zumreta, 35, clutching twin two-year-old sons whose
father disappeared in fighting when the war began.
''The food was the main problem,'' said Rifet Suljic, 56. ''I remember
we didn't eat for 10 days some times. The Dutch soldiers were sharing
food with us, although they didn't have too much.''
''We lost our three-year-old son in this last offensive,'' said Afdo
Bakic, a former soldier so badly wounded he could barely walk.
''We were not even able to bury him properly. I am very, very bitter
about the international community because it allowed the Cetniks (Serbs)
to kill my son. My son didn't have a gun and put no Serbs in jeopardy.''
In Tuzla, several hundred people gathered to welcome the first batch
of refugees. Many had themselves fled Srebrenica in a previous exodus in
1993, and searched for lost relatives.
With screams and tears, a few lucky families were reunited.
Savahid Begovic, 27, a soldier wounded and evacuated in 1993, stood
proudly by the side of a bus with his wife and sister-in-law.
''I haven't seen my wife for more than two years. I don't know where
we are going to go or where we will live, but at least we will be able
to live together.''

THE Prime Minister put his party on permanent General Election duty
last night. His themes were a blistering attack on Labour and his
ambition to make Britain the enterprise economy of Europe.
John Major told his back benchers at the Commons that political
recovery is an urgent task for every one of them.
''We have 94 weeks before we must call the General Election, 94 weeks
to re-establish our support, 94 weeks to expose the dangers of Labour,
94 weeks to safeguard the work of 16 years,'' he said.
The leadership election was necessary to clear the air, but they could
now put that behind them. ''We can now concentrate on putting our
policies across from the centre-right.''
However, Mr Major said that he was not in the business of reinventing
Conservatism, and added: ''We want to show the clear cutting edge of
Conservatism.'' He was received warmly at this annual ''end-of-term''
address to the parliamentary party.
He emphasised that he aimed to be part of Europe, but outward looking
to the world where British business could thrive. He aims for lower
taxes, but this means a trenchant reduction in state spending and
borrowing. His target is to reduce this to 40% of the Gross National
Product from 43.5% now.
His ''94 weeks'' would allow him two more Budgets, but some Tory money
is going on October 1996 as the General Election date. So a heavy
responsibility falls on his new Treasury Chief Secretary William
Waldegrave to provide trenchant cuts in state spending this November.
The Prime Minister claimed that his Ministers are bubbling over with
ideas which will be displayed at the Tory Conference in October.
''Radical Conservatism is alive and flourishing. We are shaping the
debate again on vouchers for nursery education, home ownership, and war
on social security fraud.''
He said this was required to enable tax cuts, including his own desire
to abolish capital gains and inheritance taxes eventually.
''It is not an argument to say that only some people would benefit
from this. The point is that the economy as a whole would benefit.''
So the Prime Minister wants the Tories to be proud of their
achievements and present them in better light. Mr Major also wants the
Tories to set about Labour, whom he described as dangerously naive.
''The rhetoric at the top has changed, but their gut instincts
haven't, it's all soft soap public relations. Hit them where it hurts
most.
''We have to expose what their policies mean -- higher taxes, loss of
choice for parents, disruption of health costs.''
Then there was Labour's adherence to the EU social chapter, a
federalist Europe, ill-thought out devolution plans and a tartan tax in
Scotland, as well as deep defence cuts. ''Labour offers clear targets.
This is a job for everyone in the party. We must exploit the divide
between them and us,'' he said.

THE largest NHS union, Unison, plans to stage a national 24-hour
stoppage in September followed by a rolling programme of regional
action.
The move is in support of its demand for a nationally determined pay
increase of at least 3%.
Full emergency cover will be provided in line with the TUC code for
conducting disputes. Unison's head of health Bob Abberley said that,
given the state of the service in some areas, this could mean improved
cover, although, in the main, it was likely to mean bank holiday
staffing levels.
A timetable for action, drawn up by Unison's health executive
yesterday, involved giving the NHS seven days notice of a ballot of
350,000 NHS members.
This will be conducted throughout August, for a one-day strike in
middle to late September and subsequent regional action which could be
stoppages or sanctions. The 90,000 Unison members employed by NHS trusts
will not be balloted.
The schedule coincided with publication of an opinion poll showing the
public would give overwhelming support to nurses and other NHS staff.
The poll by MORI for Unison found 71% of the public supporting strike
action with 22% against, and 69% believing staff would not take action
harmful to patients and 26% not believing this.
It also revealed massive public backing for the retention of national
pay bargaining in the NHS, with 75% agreeing staff should be paid on
nationally agreed pay scales, against 25% who thought individual
hospitals should set levels.
Mr Abberley said this would be an enormous boost for staff and would
show the Government was completely out of step with public opinion in
trying to force local bargaining.
He added that Unison had ''finally pressed the button on the pay
ballot''.

AN 84-year-old man yesterday became the first British subject to be
charged with war crimes.
Mr Szymon Serafinowicz appeared before magistrates in Epsom, Surrey,
accused of murdering four Jews in Nazi-occupied Belorussia in 1941 and
1942. He was released on bail after a 20-minute hearing.
Outside court, his solicitor, Mr Nicholas Bowers, said his client was
''absolutely innocent''.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth was last night facing furious
political criticism after leaving elected councillors in the minority on
Scotland's new public water authorities.
His announcement yesterday, which opponents said disproved Mr
Forsyth's claim to be a ''listening'' Scottish Secretary, also confirmed
that only Tory and Independent councillors would serve on the three
bodies, which come into operation next April.
One leading councillor described it as ''a slap in the face for the
Scottish people''.
However, Mr Forsyth appeared to have partly wrong-footed his critics
by naming Mr Dick Douglas -- the former Labour MP and now member of the
SNP's executive -- as the chairman of the new watchdog body, the Water
and Sewerage Customers Council.
That surprise decision resulted in the Opposition being unable to
train all their guns on the Scottish Secretary, and instead spent some
of their effort on inter-party fighting.
Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the SNP had already stressed that
none of their councillors would serve on the authorities, but there had
been speculation since Mr Forsyth's appointment last week that he might
try to make some dramatic policy shift over their composition, as he had
said he wanted to make quangos more accountable.
Although the membership of the boards is believed to have been agreed
in principle before he took over, his opponents said he would still have
had the power to effect changes.
Instead, he announced that ''about half'' of the board members -- five
-- would be councillors. In practice, though, they could be outvoted by
the five other members and the chairman in each of the North, East and
West authorities.
Mr Forsyth's announcement, in a Commons written answer, revealed that
five Tory councillors have been appointed, along with nine Independents,
to occupy the #6000-a-year places on the boards.
Labour claimed last night that Mr Forsyth had made a huge blunder by
raising expectations that a policy shift might be under way. Shadow
Scottish George Robertson said that, when it came to water quangos,
''the laddie was not for turning''.
He stressed that once the chairmen of the water authorities had been
taken into account, elected councillors would never form a majority on
any of the new boards. Even if Labour had made nominations, he claimed
it would not have altered that fact.
''This is a defining moment for Michael Forsyth. It completely blows
away any pretence that he is going to be a listening Secretary of
State.''
He also condemned as ''a cynical stunt'' the appointment of Mr
Douglas.
The Labour-led Convention of Scottish Local Authorities had insisted
that it would have nothing to do with the new authorities unless they
had a majority of councillors on them, nominated by the convention.
Last night, Cosla's senior vice-president, Councillor Keith Geddes,
said the appointments were ''a slap in the face for the Scottish
people''.
The composition of the boards was politically unrepresentative against
a background of the Conservatives' failure to win control of any of the
new authorities at the elections in April, and Mr Forsyth had failed to
recognise the will of the Scottish people.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said a listening
Secretary of State would have heard that the Scottish people wanted
water and sewerage services to be in the hands of elected councillors.
''The water quangos have as little democratic legitimacy now as they
had when they were first announced. Let's not forget that 97% of voters
in the Strathclyde water referendum were opposed to quangoisation.''
Mr Forsyth stressed in his announcement that five Labour councillors
had declined to serve, and one Liberal Democrat, Councillor Iain Smith
of Fife region, refused to join the East of Scotland Authority, leaving
one vacancy there.
Among the non-councillors appointed are two former directors of
council water and sewerage services, businessmen, chartered surveyors
and accountants.
Mr Forsyth said the appointments brought to the authorities a range of
skills and experience of the water industry, business and finance.
''The authorities are now well placed to deliver high quality,
efficient water and sewerage services and to attract additional new
investment from private finance.''
Mr Forsyth claimed that the partnership between private and public
sector would produce the greatest benefit in terms of quality of service
and value for money for the people of Scotland.
SNP leaders, while restating the party's total opposition to the new
water structure, insisted they were happy about the appointment of Mr
Douglas to head the Customers Council.
MP Roseanna Cunningham said Mr Douglas would be a doughty champion of
consumer interests, and it would be useful to have someone of his
calibre leading a body fighting for consumers and speaking up for
Scottish interests.
However, the Liberal Democrats said the appointment showed that,
despite its vehemence, the SNP was happy to pick and choose its quangos.
Mr Douglas himself admitted his appointment was something of a
surprise, but stressed the distinction between the boards and the
watchdog body. He said he did not expect opposition from fellow SNP
members.
The full membership of the council is expected to be announced in the
coming weeks. Cosla has made four nominations.
