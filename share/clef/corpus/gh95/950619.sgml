A DEPRESSING picture of the UK employment market, with job
opportunities drying up and more people being forced to work part-time,
is painted by two studies published today.
The results of a survey of companies' recruitment plans confirm last
week's jobless figures, which indicated that the rate of reduction in
unemployment was slowing down.
Independent consultants Manpower, which interviewed more than 2000
employers, found that 26% expected to hire more staff and 10% planned
cutbacks in the next three months. The others predicted no change.
While the 16% balance appears good news, it is only 1% up on the same
period last year, leading to the conclusion that there is ''strong
evidence that the recent growth in employment is levelling out''.
However, Scottish firms are more bullish about their prospects. A
balance of 18% plans to recruit more workers, above the national average
and five points up on the 1994 level.
Meanwhile, a TUC analysis of Government statistics shows that the
number of people taking part-time work because they cannot find a
full-time job has risen by 62% over the past 11 years.
It shows that ''involuntary'' part-time working has reached record
levels, with some 850,000, or 13.8%, of all part-timers saying they
would prefer full employment if it was available.
The study, Misery from the Margins, shows that part-timers are nearly
three times as likely to be employed on temporary contracts, and now
account for half of all temporary jobs, an increase of nearly 7% on the
previous year.
Included in the report is a dossier of letters from part-time workers
who responded to the TUC campaign for new rights for part-time workers.
The sample, from hundreds of responses, features complaints of pay
rates as low as #1.75 per hour, no holiday, pensions, or sick pay
entitlement, increased insecurity, and the denial of full-time job
opportunities.
The letters provide a powerful insight into the impact on part-time
workers' lives of the Government's decision to veto the European draft
directive which would have guaranteed equal treatment.
Ministers argue that this was the necessary price for part-time job
creation, although the TUC analysis shows that part-time employment is
growing fastest in European countries where employee rights are
strongest.
Senders of letters include:
* An Edinburgh insurance worker denied promotion.
* A Dumbarton firefighter who cannot understand why part-timers are
excluded from the occupational pension scheme, when they face the same
dangers as full-time staff.
* A shopworker from Arbroath who complains that her holiday
entitlement has been cut from three weeks to two, while full-time
workers retain their third week.
* A pensioner tourist guide on an unnamed Scottish island who is not
allowed time off from her #2.85-an-hour post, even though colleagues are
willing to provide cover.
TUC general secretary John Monks said that working part-time ought to
be a matter of choice, not conscription, and called on the Government to
ensure that part-timers were treated fairly, with exactly the same
rights and benefits as full-time employees, in line with the European
draft directive.

TOM SHIELDS hasn't quite got it right when he reports the plans for a
centre of piping in the old McPhater Street Church in Cowcaddens.
Glasgow has housed a centre of the piping world for nearly half a
century -- at our present home in Kelvinbridge. The move to Cowcaddens
is just the third step up since our start in a basement flat in Pitt
Street during the 1940s.
The old Free Church, which was mainly bought through a donation from
William Grant and Sons Ltd, but partly from our own funds, will give us
better opportunities to continue and expand the work which we have been
engaged in for a very long time now.
The Piping Trust, formed in 1992 to ensure the access of this venture,
had done tremendous work in raising the money required. The college is
recognised worldwide as the mecca for pipers who wish to improve their
playing ability or simply their knowledge about piping. Pupils in the
past year have come from all of these places.
Affiliated classes thrive in Canada and the United States, and our
instructors are active in various parts of the northern hemisphere.
We look forward to our move, probably early next year, with eager
anticipation.

College of Piping,

A SCOT has leaped ahead in the scientific race to crack the secret of
old age.
Dr Gordon Lithgow is one of the investigators at the University of
Colorado who have isolated a gene responsible for longevity.
A molecular biologist with a PhD from Glasgow University, Dr Lithgow
says a mutation of the gene, called Age-1, can increase lifespan by 65%:
the bad news is that it belongs to a microscopic worm, of the nematode
variety.
The worm, called caenorhabditis elegans, has been one of the most
intensively-studied creatures because of its extremely simple structure,
making it possible to carry out genetic research in a fraction of the
time it would take with more complex organisms.
Now Dr Lithgow's search turns towards humans, in the hope of finding a
similar gene which might add years to people's lives if tweaked in the
right direction.
Although this could have difficult ethical implications -- including a
growing elderly population -- there would be more immediate interest in
the possibility of curbing some of the illnesses and symptoms of ageing,
so that older people would be less frail and dependent. A longer life
that had enhanced quality, and was also productive, might be an easier
prospect for society to deal with.
The same nematodes are already under examination at Glasgow
University, which Dr Lithgow left about four years ago, but for other
branches of research.
Dr Richard Wilson, lecturer in molecular genetics at the Institute of
Biomedical and Life Sciences, said: ''This nematode has 907 cells. It is
very simple and made to tight rules.
''They are also self-fertilising hermaphrodites. The curious thing is
why only some of them have this mutation, whereas you would think
evolution might select for this quality; perhaps one of the side-effects
is to make them sterile.''
Dr Wilson, who was Dr Lithgow's external examiner when he took his PhD
in yeast bio-technology, said: ''He was over here in March talking about
his work. I am so pleased to hear him getting on.
''He did the PhD about four years ago and went to the US to do a
post-doctorate.''
Another former colleague, Dr Iain Johnstone, said: ''Several labs are
working on age mutations in the worm and there is a bit of a race on
over there. Age-1 approximately doubles the life-span.
''As far as I know no one in Scotland is working on the gene but that
worm is used as a model for lots of developmental processes.
''It was selected in Cambridge 25 years ago by Sidney Brenner as a
model organism. It is completely transparent -- you can see every cell
in the adult. This is one of the things that make it attractive.
''Gordon talked about the lab and the work they are doing. I think
everyone is happy about the way the programme is going.
''I don't know if anyone really believes that you can halt the ageing
process but there is a problem for some humans with accelerated ageing.
The implication is that you might be able to reverse that.''

Internationally acclaimed artist Maurizio Nannucci created an
enigmatic work high above the Royal Mile which has, for three years,
bemused and amused passers-by. But he has not received a penny for his
efforts. John Linklater investigates.
RIGHT from the start there have been more maybes than certainties
about the neon sculpture that Maurizio Nannucci created for Edinburgh's
skyline. It was designed to read, ''Let's Talk About Art'', but someone
miscalculated the dimensions of the pediment of the Bank Hotel on which
it was to be erected. The oversight was rectified by adding ''. . .
Maybe''. The new wording fitted the eight-metre space as tightly as a
newspaper headline, but left a prophetic indecision.
This at least helps to explain the first mystery that has exercised
visitors and Edinburghers alike. What does it mean? Internationally
renowned Nannucci explains that he simply wanted to suggest that we talk
about art. No ifs, no buts, no apologies, no maybes. Let's talk about
art instead of money, or holidays, or football. Or, more to the point,
let's talk about art instead of politics, because the work was one of 35
outdoor light installations commissioned from European artists for the
1992 Lux Europae exhibition. This was staged to coincide with the Euro
Summit in Edinburgh that dark winter, when art was not high on the
agenda. That was Nannucci's point. It was only the emergency ''maybe''
which introduced an unintended ambiguity.
This apart, the sign has an unmistakable presence in blue neon. It has
become an accepted fixture on the Royal Mile, visible from down the
Bridges. Some say it has a bright frivolity which lightens the severity
of its former Bank of Scotland building on the corner of the High Street
and South Bridge. This growing familiarity with Nannucci's neon
sculpture makes a surprise of the partnership move by the public
agencies in Edinburgh. They have raised #25,000 to buy a neon sign that
most people would be forgiven for imagining the city already possessed.
Maybe.
Memories of the Lux Europae extravaganza have faded. Clare Henry, in
her visual arts review of 1992, described it as ''mediocre light
sculptures which paled into insignificance amid the Christmas lights and
shop displays'', but it was a popular enough success at the time. It
ought to have been. It cost almost #800,000. That bought a lot of
lighting effects, projections, displays, and the fabrication of
installations. But it didn't buy Maurizio Nannucci's neon sculpture.
''I have received nothing,'' he said from his home in Florence last
week. Sounding more rueful than aggrieved, he explained that he had been
in negotiations with the Lux Europae Trust to reach an agreement over
the piece. Despite an international reputation with recent one-man
exhibitions in London, Chicago, and Sao Paulo, and a current #100,000
installation commissioned by the city of Munich, he indicated
willingness to accept only production and studio costs. His figure was
less than #10,000, representing about a quarter of the price he might
normally expect to command.
''Really, it must be seen as a present from me to the city of
Edinburgh,'' he reveals. ''I can't normally work this way. It would not
be correct. But if there is some special reason then we can agree
something, and that reason is that I would enjoy having the work remain
in Edinburgh, because it is a very special place. I agreed that this was
okay, but I have not had any answer.''
Embarrassingly, it has taken 30 months for the Lux Europae Trust to
find itself in a position to respond to the artist's generosity. The
delay reflects difficulties in winding up #30,000 in remaining debts
from the one-off festival. Fees remain outstanding to accountants and
advisers, almost #5000 in expenses are still due to Isabel Vasseur, the
exhibition director hired for the festival, along with minor trade
debtors. And, Lux Europae acknowledge, Maurizio Nannucci is still to be
paid.
To rectify this situation the Lux Europae is treating the Nannucci
sculpture as its ''most saleable asset''. This was admitted by Mr Jim
McFarlane, director of property and environment of LEEL and one of the
board of trustees of Lux Europae. He was approached to explain why LEEL
was contributing #7000 towards the purchase of the piece.
Edinburgh, it emerges, is selling the Nannucci piece for #25,000 to
itself to pay off the festival's debt to the artist, and using profits
to settle the remining deficit from the #800,000 festival. This might be
a smart piece of business on the part of the Lux Europae Trust, if not
entirely in the spirit of Nannucci's ''present''. The intitiative
involves raising the money in grants from some of the same public
authorities that supported the festival in the first place.
In addition to LEEL's #7000, Edinburgh District has agreed to
contribute #5000, Lothian region #5000 and the Old Town Renewal Trust is
being asked for #5000. The contributions have been made as grants to the
publicly-funded Old Town Renewal Trust, which is to act as a purchasing
vehicle for the ''partnership'' and assume ownership responsibility. The
Bank Hotel is being approached for a final #3000 towards the purchase,
bringing the total to #25,000.
This is not necessarily an inflated figure for the Nannucci piece,
confirmed by independent valuation after the end of the festival in
December 1992, and further supported by the artist's statement about
asking for only 25% of the real value. However, it has little
justification in terms of the price that will be paid to Nannucci, or in
terms of market forces. Mr McFarlane revealed that during the course of
the past 30 months the Scottish Arts Council, the National Lottery and
the Museum of Modern Art in Edinburgh have all been approached. All had
other ''priorities''. Maybe, and maybe is increasingly the word, they
just didn't happen to have a convenient eight-metre-long pediment on
which to display the neon sculpture. To put it bluntly, nobody else
appears to want the thing and the local authorities have finally agreed
to bail out Lux Europae.
''You're drawing a conclusion I don't actually agree with,'' defends
Mr McFarlane. ''If these bodies had not agreed to purchase the work and
could find no means of doing so, the next course of action for the Lux
Europae Trust would have been to say, is there anyone else interested in
buying this? Would we offer it to the city of Glasgow, who might want to
embarrass Edinburgh by buying a work of art for public display? Or
Manchester. Or Leeds. Our obligation would have been to offer it to
whosoever would be interested.''
Evidently, the Lux Europae Trust feels under an obligation to make a
surplus through the sale of the Nannucci piece, because unless it clears
its remaining #30,000 debts, it cannot pay the artist himself. Why had
he not been paid already? ''Because the means to finally settle that
debt do not exist,'' said Mr McFarlane. ''If the work is sold Nannucci
will be repaid his expenses, and that particular problem is solved. The
balance is there to resolve some of the wider problems.'' Maybe this has
a conveniently circular logic to it, and maybe it looks like a
completely artificial sale involving public funds.
''A distinction has to be drawn between Lux Europae and its
responsibilities, and each of those bodies purchasing this work, who
have different responsibilities,'' responds Mr McFarlane. ''Lux
Europae's responsibility was to mount the exhibition and wind up its
affairs. I make this point as a trustee. I would wish to wind up these
affairs in an honourable way.
''If you want to ask why each of these bodies consider the purchase is
worth doing, the region and the district can speak for themselves, but I
can speak for LEEL. It's because of our work in the Old Town, and the
role of the Edinburgh Lighting Design project enhancing the Old Town
from a tourism point of view. This piece of art work sits squarely
within that strategy.''
For Lothian region, Mr Norman Ireland, corporate projects manager,
confirmed: ''Nannucci was very happy that the piece stay in Edinburgh.
The market value for the piece was #25,000. The artist from the outset
stated either he wanted the piece back, or he wanted his costs and fee
out of that. So there is a portion of the price going to the artist. I
think it's #8000.''
Asked if the purchase of the Nannucci piece for the city of Edinburgh
had more to do with clearing the final debts of Lux Europae, Mr Ireland
replied: ''The deficit of Lux Europae, if that's the term to use, has
come down and down by various means. This is one of them.''
Councillor Lesley Hinds, leader of the Labour Group on Edinburgh
District Council, said that questions had been raised when the #5000
grant towards the sculpture was sought for approval, having already been
authorised by the chief executive's office. ''I am never happy when
debts come back,'' she said. ''But would you be happy that someone is
still owed money? That's the other side of the question. It's a one-off
in order to finalise Lux Europae's debt. I am not happy about having to
pay extra money.''
Edinburgh district's contribution to Lux Europae in 1992 was #30,000.
Lothian region provided #25,000 from its education and arts outreach
budget and a further #43,000 from its International Events budget. LEEL
handed over #142,000, and doubled their support with the #145,000
purchase of Adrian Wiszniewski's Edinburgh Fairy Lights. They were
handed to Edinburgh district as Christmas lighting for Princes Street.
Let's talk about art? Maybe not.

Christopher Portway on an island with more to it than meets the eye
WOOD Island -- where you can suntan all the year round in what is
probably one of the best climates in the world, where you can enjoy fine
cuisine, distinguished wine, dramatic sea and mountain scenery, and
sensational gardens. Wood Island? Maybe this utopia is more familiar
under its Portuguese-translated name of Madeira -- though I'm willing to
bet the man-in-the-street knows no more about it than that it produces
fortified wine and is a favourite British holiday destination.
And appropriately too, since according to legend, the first visitors
were a couple of eloping fourteenth-century English lovers. More
distinguished exiles followed including Archduke Maximilian of Austria
and his wife Charlotte, Charles I who chose to expire there, and
Napoleon who only had time to spend a night there on his way to St
Helena. Christopher Columbus not only resided on the neighbouring island
of Porto Santa but married the governor's daughter in between his other
pastimes of discovering bits of the world.
What is not universally known either is that most of Madeira actually
lies beneath the sea; no more than fragments just out of the Atlantic to
form an archipelago known by that name.
The largest chunk -- the island we call Madeira -- holds little in the
way of sandy beaches; the one holiday facility it lacks, so if a golden
beach is a vital pre-requisite for at least part of your vacation then
you should follow Columbus to Porto Santo where there is 5[1/2] miles of
the yellow stuff available. Other islands, isles, islets and reefs --
all uninhabited, inhospitable and hard to reach include the aptly named
Ilhas Desertas and Ilhas Selvages or Savage Isles.
Madeira is an extinct volcano rising steeply from a bottomless ocean.
The whole coast is studded with lighthouses, fishing ports and whaling
villages while Funchal, the capital, is still port of call for cruise
ships.
The main island's vital statistics are 35 miles by 13 miles -- about
that of the Isle of Wight -- with virtually all of it a nightmare of
contorted geography climaxing in peaks of more than 6000ft. But, unlike
some of the Canary Islands 200 miles to the south, the mountain flanks
are well-wooded with exotic growth -- species we think of as mere shrubs
here expand into full-blown trees -- as well as cultivated terraces in
places you'd hardly expect a fly to maintain a hold.
About a third of Madeira's population is concentrated in Funchal, the
only urban centre on the island that can be described as a town, and a
most pleasant one too. It is dominated not only by the inevitable
mountains but, from within, by fortresses and colonial mansions set on
high, their stark walls or balconied facades softened by bloated
shrubbery.
Most of the hotels are to be found in the western suburbs, kept at bay
from encroaching upon the town.
There's plenty to do in Madeira. Excursions by coach cover the island
even including the summit of the second-highest peak. The north coastal
road is an adventure in itself; the narrow artery had to be chiselled
virtually by hand from the face of near-vertical cliffs or bored through
granite and lava rock.
This wilder coast is laced with waterfalls too, some spewing forth
directly on to the road to offer a gratis car-washing service. Those who
aspire to walking will be in their element. Here there are not only
conventional footpaths but levadas; irrigation water channels
beautifully engineered and scluptured over the centuries which follow
the contours of the land, making for easy walking away from the
pavement-lacking roads. Levadas may not be unique to Madeira but what is
unique is their accessibility and extent; 1333 miles of them in an
island no more than 286 sq miles in size.
But whether you prefer walking, touring, golfing, tennis or are happy
to simply gaze at a magical countryside you'll be content here. Madeira
delights the traveller at first sight right through to the last. The
colour of the flowers, the spray of blossom that froths over the walls
flowing down the slopes, is wondrous to behold.
There can be few other places in the world where such difficulties
have had to be overcome and a livelihood earned at the cost of so much
hardship. Witness those north coast and alpine roads, the levadas and
those terraces hacked from precipitous mountain sides now rich with
banana plantations and vines.
Por ser do mundo a derradeira -- ''at the end of the world'' was how a
renowned Portuguese poet described Madeira in the days when the known
world was a smaller place than today. For many an islander it remains
the only world they know while, for lucky us privileged to visit
Madeira, it is paradise.

THE one-time warden of a long-gone youth hostel in the Borders who
sold porridge to his guests for a penny a plate must be birling in his
grave.
Keeping up with the changes the Scottish Youth Hostel Association has
made in the last few years would make anyone dizzy. At 16 Scottish youth
hostels, cooked meals are now served with hot breakfast available or
continental breakfast included in the nightly rate.
Use the book-a-bed-ahead service -- which has fax links with the most
remote hostels -- and you could tour Scotland without having to use the
frying pan once. Grade one hostels are staying open until 2am and some
of them have reception desks like hotels, as a few of them were in
previous incarnations, like the Glasgow youth hostel in Park Terrace,
formerly the Beacons Hotel.
Rooms with four or six bunk beds are quite common now at youth hostels
and family rooms have ensuite facilities. This doesn't mean that
single-sex dormitories have been altogether abolished. In its early
years the youth hostelling movement in Scotland received donations from
distinguished patrons of spare mansions and shooting lodges with rooms
too large to be sub-divided.
Some seasoned hostellers have been quite upset about the SYHA's recent
start at phasing out ''duties'' by abolishing them in grade one hostels
-- a stint of potato peeling or floor sweeping on the day of departure
used to be a condition, at all hostels, of getting the membership card
back from the warden's keeping.
Without touring guests the youth hostel movement might cease to exist,
but hikers are still high-priority guests and wardens will always find a
place for serious walkers in need of a bed.
Families visiting hostels no longer have to be split up. Although five
is still the minimum age for membership, babies and toddlers are
accepted at Cannich, Perth and Whiting Bay hostels which have
self-catering cottages or chalets for families. At 26 hostels four or
six-bedded family rooms are always available and at the others, at the
warden's discretion.
The recently converted hostel in the Wee Row, New Lanark, is a
favourite with families. All rooms are four-bedded with en suite toilets
and showers. The largest and most splendid building owned by the SHYA is
Carbisdale Castle in Ross-shire, a gift from its owner, Captain Salvesen
of the shipping family, in 1945. The castle was built in the early years
of the twentieth century for the Dowager Duchess of Sutherland, and
still contains the largest private collection of marble statues in
Scotland.
Even at quite remote hostels, activities are organised for those who
like joining in, often initiated by enthusiastic wardens. Hostellers can
have a go at gold panning in Wanlockhead, the highest village in
Scotland: or join the run-around-the-loch club started by the warden of
Loch Ossian youth hostel 20 years ago, since when some 600 runners have
completed the eight miles round the loch in less than an hour.
Youth hostelling has come a long way since the first Scottish hostels
were opened in 1931 with hurricane lamps and straw mattresses, working
parties of volunteers and duties for all cheerfully undertaken.

THE moniker aqua centre might sound a tad grandiose to those of us who
remember the days when hanging on to the bar around the shallow end with
stinging eyes in a sea of chlorine topped up with water at the humble
public baths was the nearest we got to swimming, but the soubriquet
doesn't do justice to East Kilbride's latest leisure facility.
Back then, the public baths were bedecked in shabby corporation livery
with soaked-wooden stalls round the invariably crowded pool, while the
chances of running the gauntlet round the poolside to the exit without a
soaking from a well-timed run and human ''depth charge'' at the poolside
as you approached, were remote.
No such nonsense will take place at the Dollan Aqua Centre, named
after the first chairman of East Kilbride Development Corporation, Sir
Patrick Dollan, which opens today.
A combination of superb facilities, a computer-controlled climate, and
well kitted out changing rooms set away from the pool, allows people to
come and go in comfort and safety from misguided youths. And a casual
tour of its floors reinforces the first impression that this is a
building designed for state-of-the-art leisure.
The centre is actually a five-star refurbishment of the first 50-metre
pool in Scotland, opened in 1968. Though an impressive building from the
beginning, the wear and tear of a quarter of a century was visible, and
the authorities decided to completely re-equip and renovate it.
The new poolside is tiled in relaxing greens and turquoise, and the
pool itself still stretches an intimidating 50 metres making it a superb
venue for competitive swimming at every level.
A two-piece boom can divide the pool into two or three separate areas
for mixed abilities to improve their techniques without troubling
others.
The high-diving dales which were a prominent feature of the original
pool, have been replaced by removable springboards which allow staff to
provide greater flexibility of uses in the various areas of the pool.
A large spectator area provides unrestricted views of the length and
breadth of each lane for doting parents or during competitions.
Off to the right is a flight of steps rising to the flume entrance.
This water chute spirals out into an open ''swirlpool'' section before
careering out through the exterior wall and back into splashdown by the
poolside. Within the spirals of the flume sits a youngsters' play pool
complete with aquatic elephant and water snake to climb on.
But having recovered from the exertion of your choice, whether you've
chosen to swim or gym, the next move might be down below pool level to
the sauna and sunbed suites.
Two sauna cabins, a steam room, and an array of sunbeds, sit around
the walls of an open-plan lounging area. A few feet away a Jacuzzi
awaits to swirl away aches and pains.
Reinvigorated by a relaxing wind-down in the sauna, a stroll back to
the reception area can be rewarded with a soft drink and a snack in the
cafeteria.
And should you still fancy some sporting action, a seat in the
spectator gallery allows you the smug satisfaction of watching others
exercise while your own batteries are recharged and, thankfully, not
depth charged.

PERHAPS the most innovative addition to the Dollan Aqua Centre pool is
a false floor, which extends almost a quarter of its length.
This floating floor is controlled by a system of steel wires and
pulleys which can lower it to a depth of 3.6 metres.
More importantly, the floor's built-in buoyancy allows it to be raised
and secured at any required height in the water, making it a safe
learning area for all standards of swimmer, including the very young and
disabled.
And the East Kilbride civic fathers have made laudable attempts to
properly cater for those with disabilities, with features such as a
wheelchair lift from reception to the swimming area, and a stair lift
from the sauna suites up to the exits.
In discharging their duties the East Kilbride authorities canvassed
opinion on what the locals actually wanted from their aqua centre. One
result of which was a proposed snooker room dropped in favour of a
second gymnasium and work-out suite.
This, and the main gymnasium, will feature a collection of exercise
machines for muscle groups you've ignored, to some you've yet to
discover. Recumbent cycle, incline press, leg press, rowing machines,
weight-assisted chin-up machine, even a machine which emulates the
movement of skating.
But perhaps the most terrifying is the abduction/adduction machine.
Used in abduction mode, it exercises some nether region known as the
gluteus medius, while in the adduction cycle, muscles around the hips
are put to the test.
At the workout's end, and by the door, stands the machine many a
keep-fit fanatic is humbled by. It isn't hard to operate, requires
little strength to test yourself against but rarely leaves participants
happy with their efforts -- the weighing machine.
Next door to the main gymnasium is an aerobics/dance studio with a
glass wall to the pool. The studio features a sprung floor, wall to wall
mirrors, and the obligatory sound system. Probably an inspired piece of
design to drown out the grunts and groans coming from the gym.

BEING ''oot ae the gemm'' for many young people in Blantyre is a
normal everyday occurance. Habit sets in, then addiction, and rigor
mortis will no doubt follow soon after.
For that reason, the Terminal One Youth Centre version of Wullie
McGuigan's hard-hitting drugs rock musical, Grim Facts, works in its
setting.
It tells the story of Stix, a 17-year-old ''King of the Young Team''
who likes a smoke of the ''good herb''. His ultimate ambition is to
travel to Jamaica to ''get a taste of the decent stuff''.
Although a likeable young chap, Stix's friends start to drift away,
his girlfriend leaves him and he is enticed into a world he swore he
would never get mixed up in. He takes a step too far for the ultimate
''bad trip''.
Terminal One and Grim Facts are well suited to one another. The
Blantyre youth centre is the second largest drop-in centre for
unemployed young people in the country, offering a multitude of
activities. And it teaches -- without preaching -- about drugs.
Like so many other towns in the West of Scotland with areas of
''Priority Treatment'' and poverty, Blantyre has a drug problem. Both
Terminal One and Wullie McGuigan recognise this and understand the need
for a non-patronising message.
Director Chris Annetts said: ''We had a drugs awareness evening with
the cast and I learned so much about drugs as regards to relating it to
your own life. It has relevance to what I do as a director. You can't
make judgments -- a 'just say no' attitude doesn't work.
''Grim Facts looks at it as a real thing. It has a good strong impact
on young people who watch it.''
And that it does. It is played by amateurs -- some who have never
picked up a script in their lives -- and the realism is astounding.
These actors don't have to act. They are young men and women who live
among the problems but are not sucked in. They care enough to put the
message across to their peers.
They are conveying that an ''instant release'' can lead to a lifetime
of self-destruction through an image of what it really looks like to get
''oot ae the gemm''.
However, 17-year-old leading man Stephen McGeough is no stranger to
the world of stage and screen. He played Kit in the original Paddy's
Market, has appeared in several BBC and STV productions and is a member
of Hamilton Youth Theatre.
His talent is special. He was brought in on the project only two weeks
before the opening curtain and literally had a script in his hand the
night before. He has superb energy and a mature understanding of the
theatre and the subject he is tackling.
It is also worth seeing for the music, written by Wullie McGuigan and
arranged by ex-lead gutarist of the Almighty, Andy McCafferty in the
Terminal One studios. Its disturbing atmosphere lends itself
successfully to the harsh street-wise narrative.
Terminal One's adaptation of Grim Facts is touring community venues
throughout Hamilton District this week.

Kirkwall, Sunday
THE opening weekend of this year's St Magnus Festival, staged in
Kirkwall and Stromness, has been dominated by three genuine stars. Two
of these are authentic young giants of their generation, real musical
sensations -- the French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and the Norwegian
cellist, Truls Mork. So far they have appeared in separate performances,
each so spectacular that they are the toast and talking point of Orkney.
As I write, they are limbering up for a combination duo recital in
Stromness that has aroused the greatest possible anticipation.
More urgent however, is the question of the St Magnus Festival's third
star, and a most unlikely one. Veteran Scottish composer Thea Musgrave,
long since a resident in the States, has ignited warmth and admiration
at packed festival concerts. The lady is indomitable. In her late
sixties, looking 20 years younger, and with an attitude and energy 20
years younger again, Musgrave has won the hearts of the Orkney audiences
-- and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, which has been playing her music.
''This,'' said one musician, after a scorching performance of
Musgrave's The Seasons in St Magnus Cathedral under conductor Nicholas
Kraemer, ''is as energetic and fiery as MacMillan.'' And it is too.
Musgrave is a musical dramatist par excellence. The Seasons seethes with
dramatic incident, which you can take either at an abstract or pictorial
level.
The music brilliantly catches the windy turbulence of autumn and the
bleak, icy chill of winter. Two real Musgrave fingerprints stamp the
piece: the long-limbed gorgeous romanticism of spring, which becomes as
ardent as Strauss, and the unstoppable, hectic, racing momentum of her
celebration of summer -- at subtly depicting high-velocity action in
music, she is almost without parallel.
And there was even more action the following night in Kirkwall's
Phoenix Cinema when her new oboe concerto -- Helios -- was given its
world premiere by Nicholas Daniel with the SCO and conductor Kraemer.
Helios, the sun god, daily races his chariot across the heavens in a
spectacular ride across the sky. The oboe soloist is Helios, and his
troops -- wind and brass soloists -- are stationed around the perimeter
of the orchestra, marshalled and activated by the soloist: at one point
they're all on their feet, picking up their cues from the soloist, and
giving -- for all the life -- as near an impression that you will get to
a classical music jam session.
Performed with superb theatricality by Nicholas Daniel and the SCO,
it's as invigorating and exhilarating a piece as Musgrave has written.
The great lady now travels down to Glasgow for a celebratory concert
of her chamber music tomorrow at the university and an honorary degree
on Wednesday.
Some of the other performances in these opening concerts of the St
Magnus Festival were less assured. In Handel's F major Organ Concerto,
soloist Richard Hughes sounded extremely nervous, while in Vivaldi's
Four Seasons, SCO leader James Clark was so idiosyncratic and indulgent
with the solo part that the whole thing was bizarre.
And the following night, a performance of Purcell's Tempest, featuring
soloists from a forthcoming festival opera production and the St Magnus
Festival Chorus, was at times so tentative and faltering that it
suggested drastic under-rehearsal; not the familiar SCO standards at
all.

Theatre
WHAT a difference a suit and a change in politicial circumstances can
make. In post-apartheid South Africa, horizons can now be lifted to take
in more personal perspectives -- though whether it's a broadening or a
shrinking is perhaps open to question.
This second offering in LIFT from Johannesburg's Market Theatre, home
during the troubles of so much theatre of dissent, gives us the spectre
of one of South Africa's writing talents who might, under different
circumstances, have gone on to international fame.
As it was, Can Themba, from whose story this has been adapted by
Mothobi Mutloatse, was banned, went into exile and died in Swaziland.
But judging by this production by Barney Simon, Themba had a rare,
delicacy of touch and psychological insight.
The Suit is one of those bitter-sweet stories of personal tragedy in
which suffocating, over-idealised love brings a terrible retribution.
Set in Sophiatown, once a bubbling melting pot of multi-culturalism,
infamously razed from the map by the authorities, Themba paints an
affectionate picture of its inhabitants. He focuses on one couple in
particular -- the proud, complacent Philemon and his adored wife,
Matilda, on whom he visits a slow and pernicious humiliation when she is
discovered committing adultery.
It is a pitiful, sobering and subtle portrait of a disintegrating
marriage pulled apart through non-communication, loneliness and pride.
But as always with Market Theatre,

IT was an occasion but not a success, an aspiration but not a
fulfilment, an event that foundered on the erroneous belief that the
appearance of one of the three great tenors amid the greens and bunkers
of Gleneagles would be the same as his appearance at Hollywood Bowl or
the Baths of Caracalla.
It was not the same at all, and not even the presence on Saturday of
some 8000 fans -- many of whom were still crunching across gravel into
the improvised open-air arena half-an-hour after the concert began --
could conceal the fact that a voice as liquid as Carreras's congeals in
chilly Perthshire.
True, the skies cleared as the evening progressed, but the crude
over-amplification through two steely towers of loudspeakers got worse
and worse. To know why Carerras has achieved his world-class reputation,
you would have done better to stay at home with a good CD.
This, admittedly, would have deprived you of the man himself but in
fact he made little impression in a space vast enough to have dwarfed
even the outsize personality of a certain other tenor. Carreras is
simply too introspective a singer to relish the grossness of such an
event. Though he delivered excerpts from Traviata and Elixir d'amore
with practised assurance, only Meyerbeer's O Paradiso, with its vision
of a distant tropical land, seemed to come anywhere near galvanising
him.
Such moments could be cherished in a programme cynically lacking in
ballast, and seemingly assembled as such things so often are, to give
the star singer maximum time off-stage, while someone else -- in this
case the young Spanish soprano Isabel Rey -- diverted the audience, and
the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra filled in with a few overtures.
Rey's bright timbres, which might in other circumstances have been
worth hearing, sounded horrendously distorted. The second half involved
a trudge through some Broadway and Shaftsbury Avenue duets before
Carreras finally reached the semi-security of Granada.

Music
O FORTUNA. A stroke of luck and a strike of lightning hit Saturday
night's Royal SNO Prom performance of Carl Orff's epic Carmina Burana.
Lucky to be in the capable hands of dynamic conductor Wayne Marshall who
led a brilliant trio of soloists and an orchestra, chorus and junior
chorus in dazzling form, this was an electrifying experience, reflected
in an ecstatic reception from a capacity audience.
Counter-tenor Jonathan Peter Kenny provided the most captivating
performance in his account of the roasting of the swan. From bassoonist
Julian Robert's opening whine to Kenny's ultimate woeful plea this was a
tortured and agonising cry, hammed up to perfection. Baritone Karl
Morgan Daymond is a prodigious talent, ravishing throughout his wide
range while soprano Maureen Braithwaite produced a bright, if a little
thin, sound.
Chorus sections were powerful and convincing with the choir down on
the platform and the junior chorus up in the choir stalls. Male and
female alike, this was an incredible sing. Marshall is obviously a
favourite with the Royal SNO -- he played with fire and commitment.
Flautist John Grant was in devastating form, delivering the many flute
solos with exquisite charm. The percussion section also deserves a
mention for its colourful injections.
A first-half collection of Gerswhin and Ellington numbers arranged by
Marshall allowed the conductor to show off at the keyboard. His love of
jazz is matched by an impressive improvisatory gift and the combo of
Royal SNO brass and wind players included fine solos from clarinetist
Josef Pacewicz and trombonist Lance Green.
A Prom to remember for a spectacular Carmina Burana. Next concert is
Tuesday's Big Band extravaganza, led by the much-revered Sir Willian
Southgate.

Grays Art School students have big aspirations and enormous talent. As
Clare Henry reports, six of the Aberdeen pupils, after dominating this
year's Kinross RSA Scholarships, will study in Florence
GRAYS ART SCHOOL sits in perhaps Aberdeen's most elegant new building
on a beautiful parkland site beside the river Dee. Designed by Michael
Shewan in 1966 in the Mies Van der Rohe style, this symmetrical
glass-and-steel structure with its open courtyard and magnificent view
of wooded landscape will be at the centre of the Robert Gordon
University when the whole university eventually moves to this handsome
greenfield campus.
Grays was founded in 1884 by an Aberdonian merchant John Gray, and was
originally housed at Schoolhill beside Aberdeen Art Gallery. It is the
smallest of the four Scottish art colleges, with an intake of just 130
students per year, including 22 painting graduates against 41 painters
at Glasgow, 35 at Dundee, and 60 at Edinburgh.
But despite being outnumbered, this year Aberdeen is not outflanked,
for six of the 13 RSA Kinross Scholarships (#1400 each for a study visit
to Florence) have been won by Grays. None of the Kinross winners has
ever been to Italy so it is a treat in store.
I had spotted Lindsey Crowe and Giles Rencontre at Edinburgh's RSA
Student Exhibition earlier this year. Crowe has a gentle but assured
touch and her complex figure compositions use a distinctive sandy,
auburn and green palette while Rencontre plays with the idea of
dislocating space in a misty landscape by placing detatched figurative
fragments.
Sure enough they went on to gain first-class degrees along with two
others, despite a tough external assessor in the form of Paul Huxley,
head of painting at London's Royal College.
Glasgow and Dundee still await their results. I hope they will also be
rigorous with their firsts -- unlike Edinburgh which always dishes them
out in handfuls. This year Edinburgh has gone over the top with 13
painting firsts and 21 design firsts. First class degrees should remain
few and memorable, ideally around 5% of the total -- or they mean
nothing and devalue the entire degree structure.
Back in Aberdeen the professionalism of the display is heartening: not
too much; not too little on the walls. I always enjoy looking at
sketchbooks and Aberdeen students also display a copy of their
dissertation.
David Shearer wrote about Hodgkin, Bellany and Vermeer but failed to
mention David Hosie who has surely influenced his stolid, iconic figures
most of all. Norma McLean's portraits may be more straightforwardly
traditional, but they are very good and show a rapport with her sitters
which is almost tangible.
Chris Daly, like Rencontre, obviously influenced by Kitaj who has just
won the Venice Biennale Golden Lion award despite the punishingly
adverse criticism his recent Tate Gallery retrospective received,
presents a welter of vigorous, action-packed canvases like Sub Club and
Room 27 which, though ambitious, are rather too much of a take-off of
Kitaj for my liking.
Karen McPerson, Kerry Gibson and Kinross winner Christine Milne are
among the few abstractionists. McPherson has been looking at Bert
Irvin's multicolour swirls but uses pure flat white to break it up while
Gibson, off to Cyprus to do a postgraduate course, employs a cooler
approach.
Paul Munzi's large nudes take pride of place in the stairwell
alongside Hector Pottie's thoughtful blue and white graphics. Among the
other Kinross scholars I enjoyed Michelle Anderson's self-portraits and
her sensitive drawings of her boyfriend, Euan, but was less keen on
Steven McKenzie's turtles.
Not surprisingly marine life features prominently in Aberdeen's
printmaking with Robert Petrie combing the beaches for rudders and
suchlike and Stephanie Mitchell focusing on fish and gulls. Lynda
Gowan's etched moths, frogs and clover are more ethereal while Nolan
Wall goes for mechanical monsters.
Kinross scholar Gayle Robinson got a well-earned first with exquisite
small, multi-layered prints. She is keen on iconography and architecture
so Florence should suit her well. I also admired Georgia O'Neill
outrageous life-size patterned cows, ducks and hens set against subtle
backgrounds of packaged dairy products and her monopoly money Do Not
Pass Go image. Great fun.
Aberdeen is home to Peacock Printmakers, currently showing work by
Grays technician Cameron Ross as well as stars like Bellany, Rodger,
Steadman, Fisher and Grays head of printmaking Len Dunbar, so Aberdeen
students are ideally placed for inspiration.
The 13 sculptors follow the fashionable installation route with the
exception of Jon Tyers whose nudes are carved -- or cast a la Gormley.
Mairead Amos uses fine wire and perspex for her text on subtle
simplicity and detailed precision while Fiona McDonald sews pairs of
opposites above a cut-down table.
Neil Richardson works with perspectival rooms. Forbes Graham's
triangular castor filing cabinet is memorable. Alison Brown uses padding
and cloth; Claire Proctor likes red.
Among the design students Carla de Freitas's crazy shoes won hands
down with Emma McEwan's emamel boxes a close second. In textiles Jon
Blackmore was loud, lighthearted and unmissable while Lee McCulley won
on beautiful pleated velvets and delicate plant designs. I also noted
Wendy Golding's professional textiles, Janice Scott's printed velour,
Sarah Marsden's cling knit dresses and Tracey Black's burnt boxes.
Resolving the new technologies with traditional oil painting is one of
many problems facing current graduates. I am certain the Internet will
not solve the world's problems, as many 20-year-olds believe. Dangers
lurk there too. People are central to life and life drawing remains at
the core of subsequent study, whatever direction it may take.
Aberdeen still has a good grasp on skills, just like the Victorian
William Etty, famous for his sensual nudes, who admired Titan and Rubens
and frequented Academy life classes all his life. At Grays Etty and
E-Mail literally go together. Their new terminal stands cheek by jowl
with his magnificent Salon picture. This is as it should be.
* Grays degree show runs till June 24. Much of the work is for sale
with prices from #10 to #600.

NEXT month the focus of attention in the golfing world will turn to St
Andrews as the 124th Open Championship gets under way from July 20-23.
All eyes will be on Nick Price, defending champion, to see how well he
handles the Old Lady.
Those who have watched champions play from close range will know that
there is nothing more stimulating, and the rising desire to hit a golf
ball and have a game can be quite powerful. With the courses beside the
Old Course being used for car parking and a tented village, it will
require a short drive and two putts to relieve the tension. There is a
splendid selection of courses, parkland and links, in attractive
locations that are well worth making a base from which to travel to see
The Open.
Leven is just down the road from St Andrews and here the links, an
Open qualifier, are shared by two clubs, the Leven Thistle and the Leven
Golfing Society. Overlooking Largo Bay, the course, SS71, does not
appear difficult; nicely mown fairways, rough not too long, greens large
enough to handle a few sets of eightsome reels. However, when the wind
blows in from the bay it is rarely a zephyr and high scoring usually
follows in its path.
Many of the courses in Fife have been around since the game was
invented and out of the 33 courses in the kingdom, 17 are links.
Continuing in an aged profile are the old Balcomie Links at Crail,
about 10 miles south of St Andrews. This is home to the Crail Golfing
Society which was founded in 1786 and where Old Tom Morris laid out the
first holes 100 years before. Its SS68 measures 5700 yards and again the
test is truly measured in the wind. Elevated greens and tees are a
feature of the course which is in constant view of the sea.
Maritime connections continue a few miles away at the Earlsferry Links
at Elie. On the first tee the shot is blind and before the ball may be
fired straight and true down the fairway a submarine periscope is used
prior to the all clear being given. Golf course architect James Braid
played much of his golf over its 6241 yards and thought the 13th to be
among the best two-shotters in the country. But beware of the massive
greens, you are in serious three-putt country.
Ten miles north of St Andrews is Scotscraig Golf Club in the small
town of Tayport. The course was laid out by James Braid in 1923 and is a
mixture of heathland, gorse and heather. The card reads 6496 yards,
SS71. It has often been called the thinking man's golf course and on
many holes there is little margin for error. The cavalier golfer may
spend much of his time hacking in the bushes when the ''safe'' iron from
the tee should have been the preferred shot. Scotscraig is certainly a
course that will suit the better golfer and it is also used as an Open
qualifier.
Not to be missed is Ladybank, south of Cupar in the heart of Fife and
17 miles west of St Andrews. The links experience at Elie and Crail is
in the distant and here the fairways are of heathland where heathers,
broom and pine are in abundance, giving holes an individual feel. Old
Tom Morris had a hand in its construction in 1879 when he built six
holes but it is a jewel and its 6271 yards are made a pleasure to play
because of its immaculate condition.
Of a more recent era is Thornton golf course about 15 miles north of
the Forth Road Bridge. Its 18 holes were completed in 1976 after having
been a nine-holer for more than 50 years. There are many memorable holes
on this 6197-yard course which deserve the attention of the tourist
golfer.
Staying with the new era of golf course is the Balbirnie club at
Markinch. Built 10 years ago, its aim is to become one of the best
parkland courses in the country. It has been created on a 140-acre
estate of mature woodland. Hardwood trees and shrubbery are prolific by
the lush fairways. In terms of difficulty it does require some thought
and the ''safe'' iron may be best kept at the ready.
Out of Fife and across the Tay the splendid chain of golf courses
continues and the well-known such as Downfield, Carnoustie, Edzell,
Monifieth and Panmure share good company with Camperdown, Forfar,
Kirriemuir and Montrose which are increasingly gaining in popularity.
Downfield lost its orginial course to housing in 1960 but the club
gained handsome compensation in the form of 150 acres of mature woodland
that was part of the Camperdown Estate. The result is a magnificent
setting and also a golf course to match. Long holes, long shots, and 14
holes before a par four is less than 400 yards leave the fairway woods
smoking in the bag. From the medal tee the course measures 6804 yards
and has a SS of 73.
Length and accuracy are also important at Carnoustie which is regarded
by many of the great players as being one of the finest links courses in
the world. The Open Championship is to be played there in 1999, the
sixth it will have staged, but with fame comes a price and round at
Carnoustie cost #40 or #70 the day.
Of the less famous Camperdown shares part of Downfield estate and
offers a similar wooded and scenic treat; Forfar, designed by Braid,
makes life hard with its rising and falling fairways; and the
spectacular views from Montrose joins with the others to make a visit
worthwhile.
A slightly further outpost but still within reasonable distance from
St Andrews is Blairgowrie where one of Scotland's most scenic courses,
Rosemount rests in a splendid setting. Its fairways, lined by fir and
pine, offer shelter throughout its 6500 yards and the game is further
enhanced by the gallery of pheasants, partridge and grouse.
This small corner of Scotland offers a truly fine standard of golf
course in beautiful settings and all within comfortable reach of the big
guns at St Andrews.

AS if it were not enough to be trying to build up overseas sales of
prime Scotch beef and lamb our exporting wizards are now being asked to
add butchery techniques to the list of things we do better than our
European neighbours. Well, maybe not all of Europe but certainly Spain
and Italy.
That is one of the recommendations from sheep farmer and wool board
member Rog Wood of Auchentaggart, Sanquhar Dumfries, a tenanted farm on
the Buccleuch estates.
Mr Wood has recently issued his report on visits to Eastern Europe,
Spain and Italy as part of a Nuffield Scholarship. His objective was to
study the sheep production systems of Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and
to look at ways of exploiting the Italian and Spanish markets.
His report confirms that it can be a chastening experience to see
ourselves as others see us. ''Spanish housewives perceive UK lamb to be
poor quality and, as a result, it is sold at heavy discounts, disrupting
the market.'' When cooked Spanish-style -- with a little salt and water
-- our British lamb apparently comes over as dark, strong flavoured and
smelling of wool.
Despite the success which some producers have scored in producing
lighter lambs for the Continental trade, Mr Wood recommends that UK
farmers should continue producing the type meat they always have, rather
than attempt to produce Spanish-style lambs.
''In the short term, UK exporters should continue with opportunistic
exporting, but the long-term strategy must be to develop the trade for
heavier lambs,'' he said.
''This will involve educating butchers in UK techniques of cutting
heavier lambs. More importantly, Spanish housewives need to be educated
in UK-style cookery so that they will appreciate UK lamb as a separate
dish with its own distinctive flavours rather than a cheap, poor quality
substitute for Spanish lamb.''
The perception of our lamb as being a cheap, poor quality substitute
is hard to take after being exposed to the promotional expertise of
Squabla and Scotmex. Last year, according to Scotmex, our lamb exports
reached 36,000 tonnes although, admittedly only 1000 tonnes of it went
to Spain. The French, whose culinary skills are more highly regarded,
took 27,000 tonnes.
The idea of teaching Spanish and Italian butchers how to handle our
lamb is a sound one. The expertise is there in the Meat and Livestock
Commission, which already runs courses for our own trade, demonstrating
how a gigot of lamb can be presented in more ''interesting'' formats --
mini-joints, steaks, stir frys and cubes.
The big stumbling block is cost. As Mr Wood admits, such an exercise
would require sustained commitment and money. Would producers be
prepared to see the MLC levy go up to pay for such an exercise?

THE boys have found a hotel which hasn't heard of them and are set for
the Highland. Unfortunately, I have a prior engagement further north and
can only go for a day. This is a source of great sadness to me. As a
student of animal psychology I don't like to miss the opportunity to
witness the boys at play.
Mind you, we do have rather different interests. None of them is very
interested in livestock. Even Big Hamish, who has a dairy to keep the
smile on his face, has no interest in the show rings. Debate could range
around him about whether it was possible for a British Friesian to get a
prize these days.
Old men who believe there should be enough beef on a dairy cow to make
a plate of stovies can be close to blows with Holstein men, but Hamish's
eyes will have wandered to some new or bigger machine.
And they're all the same. The Red Rooster has hill cows but that's
only because he has some cliffs where even he wouldn't dare to drive a
combine. He will only see the cattle judging in the unlikely event that
he can't find a better place for a drink than the Herdsman's.
Mossie shudders when he passes cattle: ''C'mon. Let's get passed these
brutes. We dinna need ony loss adjusters.'' He has pigs, but they're a
bit of a write-off at the Highland because they are so hedged around by
health legislation they can't get to the show, or more exactly, they
can't get home in case they take any disease home.
I don't see the attraction of all those fancy aids-to-bankruptcy you
see on the machinery stands. I am sure that I am right that the optimum
size of farm nowadays is about 600 acres and that that is far too small
to make #100,000 combines and #30,000 ploughs economic. No, no. I leave
that to Davie the contractor. He may be the Man-of-Few-Words but he has
the credit to buy the machines and the acres to spread them over.
Anyway, for me who has wasted half my life on sport, the essence of
the working show is competition. I notice they are having pole-climbing
competitions this year. Great. That will show off the skills of the tree
surgeons, the linemen and the woodmen.
So why not expand that? What about combine races? Or
changing-machinery-on-the-back-of-a-tractor races. Who can hitch and
unhitch the most machines in five minutes -- special section for screw
hitches?
And if, like me, you prefer the aesthetic competitions like in the
cattle, why not classes for tractors and even tractors decorated in the
way that they do with their predecessors, the Clydesdales?
That might be worth a try but for me it will always be the livestock
and the Blue Riband, the cattle. It is a quite wonderful feeling to take
a beast to the Highland and get a red ticket and better still a
championship. Many men have spent fortunes on trying. You can breed a
champion or you take the easy way and buy them. To buy a champion will
cost you at least three times what it is worth and there is no guarantee
that you will have the skill and the luck to gain a championship no
matter how much you pay.
But what I really admire is the man who can buy below the middle of
the market and then win at the Highland. George Anderson of Keir has
done it for example and I am full of admiration.
He bought a heifer calf from me for #1200 and took the supreme
championship at the show with her when she was a cow.
I would like to do that.
Now you will recall that I bought a bull at Perth this year. He has
some of the criteria for fulfilling my dream. He was certainly cheap
enough. He came right out of the bottom drawer at 1300 guineas. I'd call
myself a stockman if I could get a ticket with him.
''What do you think of that?'' I said to the Red Rooster when he came
home. ''Oh dinna worry about it, Charlie,'' he said, ''the worst-looking
bull can be the best breeder.''
All that I knew, but what was wrong with my bull? He still looked good
to me. Still, with all the weight of opinion against him, I decided to
try him locally first, so Dod is entered for New Deer Show. My idea was
that I would show them.
I'm not confident any more.
You see Dod has to be a working bull. I can't afford to have him
sitting around eating cake until the third week of July. He has to see
to 47 ladies before then.
That doesn't mean that a prize at New Deer was impossible. Some bulls
conserve their energy very well. They don't join the foreplay which can
go on for days. Wise bulls just wait until they are spot-on, do the
business and then rest up.
Unfortunately, Dod is not that wise.
He got a start among Gowkie's small herd. Only four were available and
that didn't set him back at all.
But when I got him together with the 43 at home it was like a comic
blue movie. There were at least six in heat or near it and the poor
young bull didn't know where to start. He tore back and forward among
them and had no sooner started to case one than another would come past
and distract him. Even after he had served one he chased on and in
seconds was mounting another, but without result.
He has been in for two weeks and I haven't seen my bull sitting down
yet. If this goes on much longer he'll be able to hide behind a fence
post.
Dod's pedigree name is ''Doodo'', a horrible name which is also the
Kenyan for ''insect''. If he doesn't slow down we may have to give him
his old name back.
Three hundredweights lighter (and falling), I see what everyone else
doesn't like about my bull now, and dreams, even of New Deer show, are
waning.

PUBLICATION on Wednesday of the minutes of the May meeting between the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England will
overshadow this week's light diet of economic statistics.
On May 5, Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George met amid widespread
expectations of a half-point increase in interest rates. In the event
the Chancellor said ''No''.
All the indications are that the Governor had advocated a rise on the
back of sterling's sharp fall this year. The following week the Bank
said the Government would fail in its objective of keeping underlying
inflation down to 2.5% or less at the end of the current Parliament.
The minutes, published six weeks after the event, will be closely
studied to see how serious was the split between the two men responsible
for monetary policy.
At the Mansion House dinner Mr Clarke and Mr George were playing down
their disagreement. Since the decision was taken not to raise rates, the
balance of economic evidence has suggested that the economy is slowing
down and inflationary pressures are no worse than expected.
Money supply figures tomorrow are expected to show that broad M4 money
increased by 0.5% last month taking the annual rate of increase up from
5.4% in April to 5.7%. M4 lending is forecast to fall back from #4700m
to #4000m.
TODAY -- None announced.
TOMORROW -- Money supply (May); Building society figures (May).
WEDNESDAY -- Balance of trade with countries outside EU (May).
THURSDAY -- None announced.
FRIDAY -- CBI monthly trends (June).

SCOTTISH Amicable has appointed two external fund managers, JP Morgan
Investment Management in the US and Nikko International Capital
Management in Japan, to manage funds on its behalf.
The life office, which is launching three Global Balanced Unit Trusts
to add to its range of investment products, will use the external fund
managers' expertise in addition to that of Scottish Amicable Investment
Managers (SAIM) to offer investors access to the UK, US and Japanese
perspectives of world markets.
Also being introduced is a Personal Equity Plan which allows regular
and single contributions to be invested in a wide range of Scottish
Amicable unit trusts, offering international as well as UK investment
opportunities.
The Scottish Amicable PEP will offer investors a choice of five
qualifying and six non-qualifying trusts managed by SAIM and the two
external fund managers Morgan and Nikko.
Scottish Amicable European, meantime, is set to launch the Building
Society Bond which aims to provide cautious investors with a gross rate
of return similar to that available with a UK-based building society
account.
The bond, to be launched on July 3, is also regarded as an ideal
vehicle for older investors wishing to make maximum use of their age
allowance. The bond will invest in a fund based in Dublin's
International Financial Services Centre where it grows free of UK life
company taxation.

Music
A ''MEDITERRANEAN'' series -- three concerts of music associated in
some way with southern Europe -- is the Edinburgh Quartet's summer
inspiration this year.
The programmes have Arriaga, the precociously gifted Spaniard who died
at the age of 20, as a running theme, but are otherwise not too rigid.
So, amid last night's travels through Spain and Italy there was a
small northern detour in the form of a new work by the Glasgow-based
Edward McGuire appropriately called, The Guest Quintet. The guest was
the guitarist Phillip Thorne, but the title also referred to Highland
hospitality and to the civility of musicians who invite guests to
perform with them.
Artfully, the music found a Mediterranean connection by incorporating
themes by John Clerk of Penicuik, who studied under Corelli in Rome.
Since the guitar part was written in such a way that other instruments
could play it, McGuire has given his piece a further touch of fantasy.
Placed between Boccherini's similarly witty Retreat from Madrid and Hugo
Volf's Italian Serenade, it certainly made its point, but the concert
was not wholly light-hearted. Puccini's funereal tone painting
Crisantemi, provided a suitably melancholy postlude to Arriaga's teenage
quartet in A major, a tantalising example of genius soon to be cut off.
His third and last quartet will be played on July 2.

RIGHT, get your paper and pencils out. It is doodle time. What we want
is a symbol for the European single currency. You know the sort of
thing. It must be a character like the # sign, only something quite
different and original.
Somewhere deep inside the offices of the Economic and Monetary
Institute in Frankfurt -- which will one day become the European Central
Bank -- there works a poor unfortunate whose role in life is to come up
with such a design. I don't know how far he has progressed with his task
so far but throughout Europe there is a noticeable shortage of published
ideas.
Even bored journalists sitting around with nothing better to do have
been known to put their collective minds and notebooks and pencils to
inventing a symbol but have come up with nothing.
So here's where you can help. Herald readers could make life for the
doodler in Frankfurt a lot easier with a few suggestions (printable
only, please) and, who knows, they might find their place in history.
In today's world there are only three major currencies that I can
think of which use symbols rather than letters. They are the dollar, the
yen, and good old sterling. And now that the single currency beckons --
British dithering notwithstanding -- the search is on for a fourth idea.
It deserves something special. After all, the new money will probably be
the most powerful currency in the world.
Lots of head-scratching is going on in high places about this
extremely touchy subject.
First, there has to be a name for the single currency which is
acceptable to all participating countries. One of the drawbacks of
Britain (or at least our Government) being cool on the idea is, of
course, the possibility that we could be shut out of the naming process.
When, eventually, we decide that we cannot hold out any longer against
George Soros and his pals we might not take too kindly to the new
coinage being called, for example, the mark. Better that we get stuck in
now when we are not alone in our doubts about the whole idea.
We could call the thing the Ecu, which is the nominal EU currency at
present. As we all know the Ecu is an old coinage in Scotland dating
back to the days when we had a single currency with the French.
History would support that choice, likewise the fact that Ecu and
Europe both begin with the letter E.
This means that a symbol for the new currency could be a variation of
the fifth letter of the alphabet. The trouble is that probably no-one
else warms to the Ecu -- clumsy name -- save perhaps the French or the
Portuguese whose Escudo is derived from Ecu.
If we were better Europeans in Britain we might have some success
pushing for the # sign to be retained. The Italians have a variation on
the theme for their lira, likewise the Irish with their punt. So the
Brits with their # could have allies.
This would impress the British enemies of a single currency who still
believe that a shared coinage is a loss of sovereignty. In this respect
I notice that Mr Jim Fairlie, once a prominent SNP figure, is fretting
in print again about economic union and its effects. He must be the
first Scottish nationalist to campaign for the Bank of England.
But that's an argument for another day. A single European currency is
one issue where the Scots have no sovereignty left to lose.
Listening to the Germans on this issue will be interesting. They
effectively bankroll the EU whose new currency will be guided from
Frankfurt by the European Central Bank where the participating countries
will be board members (and able, therefore, to outvote the Germans).
With good reason, the Germans are proud of their healthy mark which is
known rather prosaically by the letters DM and carries no symbol.
They will not give it up unless they can be persuaded that doing so is
in their interest.
Naturally, they want the new currency to be called the mark or the
E-mark. While that would be well received in Finland where the currency
is the markke, you don't need me to explain the historical and cultural
reasons for others finding this idea less than attractive.
Our pro-European Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, would
like the new coins to be called the Crown which would go down well in
England, and with Scandinavians like the Danes and Swedes with their
krona.
Otherwise we could have florins which are an old British and European
coinage. Crowns would involve a variation on the C as the Americans do
with cents. Florins invite a fancy F.
But, barring a completely original design, some variation of E remains
favourite, I would guess. One reason for this is that Europeans might
never agree on a name. The French and British would not accept mark
because it is too Germanic although it was once a Scottish and English
coin worth two-thirds of a #.
One solution to this is to keep all our existing names and simply use
E or Euro- as a prefix. Thus we would have the Euro-pound or the
Euro-mark, Euro-franc, etc.
The implications are vast. As I type this the thought occurs that
every computer keyboard in the world will be in trouble. With a
typewriter you can sometimes manufacture a sign by overtyping. But we
shall have to introduce the new symbol to the next computer keyboard
generation as keyboards in use now become obsolete.
So, as readers of this column doodle away they might ponder that in
this changing world perhaps the whole idea of having a currency, single
or not, is old hat. Why not just use plastic for everything? The age of
the smart card is upon us, after all.
Or how about bringing back the groat?

A COURT of Session judge has granted an interim interdict against Ayr
auction firm James Craig Limited from putting undue pressure on Wallets
Marts' shareholders.
The weekend-hearing took place in the latest round of a bitter
takeover battle for Wallets Marts, the Castle Douglas market firm which
is world-famous for its Galloway cattle shows and sales.
The interim interdict was granted following considerable concerns
which had been voiced by a number of Wallets shareholders over the
tactics employed by Craigs advisers in the final week of the takeover
battle.
It is understood that the Takeover Panel attempted to put a stop to
Craig's action but it is alleged that the firm continued its tactics
throughout last week.
Wallets went to the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Friday night and
was successful in gaining the interim interdict.
Wallets board of directors is currently attempting to fight off a
takeover bid from Craigs which is offering #12 a share and values the
company at #1.5m. It is recommending rejection of what it describes as a
hostile bid which undervalues the company and they are recommending
rejection of the offer which closes tomorrow.

IT was the late Willie McRae, the nationalist lawyer, who got to the
heart of the matter in a speech to an SNP conference. ''Ye dinna keep
pigs until ye ken where tae put the shit,'' he advised the nuclear
industry. But that industry's enthusiasm for the joys of nuclear-powered
energy has never been matched by any noticeable signs of zeal in the
waste management department.
In fact even yet, decades after the first installation came on stream,
the quangos charged with finding the safest possible storage solution
have still to reach any definitive conclusions.
Last week, however, somewhat belatedly, two separate Government
committees did reach agreement on the way the Dounreay nuclear plant in
Caithness conducts its business. Both the Committee on the Medical
Aspects of Radiation in the Environment, and the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee concluded that Dounreay's management had
lied to them.
Almost unbelievably they had not given their scientists the
information that a serious explosion had occurred in their waste shaft
spewing out radioactive material in 1977. Worse still, they had laid a
separate trail away from that disaster suggesting that radioactive
particles on the foreshore must have been the result of an early mishap.
Even for an industry notorious for secrecy and duplicity that is a major
scandal.
And nothing in the behaviour of that plant in the years since gives us
much cause to believe safety has been given more of a priority. You will
recall that the reason the company was refused planning permission for
an extension to its low-level waste pits was Highland regional
councillors finding previously ''stored'' material dumped in rusting
barrels with a sheet of tarpaulin thrown over them.
And always they respond with the same soothing script used by their
colleagues at every nuclear plant in the country. Forced to admit to an
''incident'' they instantly conclude it represents no danger to the
public. Caught in illegal leaking or dumping they suggest we'd be in
more danger from natural background radiation from the rocks or the
telly. Clearly they imagine the public's heads button straight up the
back.
Yet they get away with it. They play Russian roulette with public
health and safety because, unlike other managers, those in the nuclear
industry are pretty certain to be picking up their index-linked pensions
before the results of any criminal negligence ever become evident. It
was 30 years after the major fire at Windscale (now Sellafield) before
the full horror of that accident became public knowledge. And it will be
30 years after the events before the full carnage of Three Mile Island
and Chernobyl begins to be reflected in the cancer statistics.
Yesterday I heard the personable new director of Dounreay suggest that
it was essential for reasons of commercial confidentiality that certain
information had to be withheld. What a very convenient alibi that has
proved over the years.
But it wasn't commercial confidentiality that made the nuclear
authorities pay out-of-court settlements at the eleventh hour to the
widows of workers who met premature death from causes which appeared to
be radiation-linked. They paid the women hush money because they didn't
want those arguments publicly rehearsed or risk these links being
formally established.
And that isn't the only way ''safe clean'' nuclear fuel plants play
dirty. Over the years the so-called safe limits of exposure have
constantly been revised downwards as we learn more accurately about the
deadly and long-term medical implications.
Yet each new limit is greeted as the holy grail of nuclear truth, and
any scientist rash enough to challenge that certitude, any researcher
who sets out to determine the dangers of even low-level exposure, is
sentenced to professional death by character assassination.
In the past few days we have been treated to the astonishing news that
the site director at the time of the 1977 Dounreay explosion, Mr
Clifford Blumfield, was a very angry man when he could find no records
of what was stored in the shaft which exploded. He kept that anger
strangely muted at the time.
When Mr Blumfield was in charge of Dounreay he was paranoid about the
smallest suggestion that his patch was hazardous to the local community.
I could have papered a reasonably sized house with the furious telexed
missives he dispatched to journalists concerned about the furtive nature
of his operation. And that endemic furtiveness continued as the
Government committees have now found out. The angry Mr Blumfeld appears
to have clean forgotten the cause of his rage when the committee men
came to call.
And what of his successor, John Baxter, now assiduously wooing the
media so patronised and reviled in the past. He can't be expected to
pick up the tab for the crass behaviour of the past, but what can we
expect of a Baxter-led future? Perhaps a clue lies in a statement made
by his press spokesperson, Mr Ian Shepherd.
Confirming the existence of a report on the 1977 accident Mr Shepherd
advises us that it would not be ''appropriate'' to release it. ''The
report was intended for internal use and will be released to those
groups with a legitimate interest only.'' I would suggest to Messrs
Baxter and Shepherd that the most legitimate group of all is the general
public, most especially those living and raising families in the
vicinity of the plant.
Dounreay's current commercial trick is hawking tales of spent fuel
reprocessing skills around those parts of Europe who don't fancy that
operation in their own backyard. Then, just like Sellafield, we would be
exposed to the risks of other people's unmanaged waste being transported
to the north of Scotland. It is, apparently, a nice little earner. And
what else could possibly matter?

PEOPLE still talk of the day that the Tories were caught by Mr Michael
Foot in a celebrated Commons occasion in a classic piece of dithering on
loyalty. ''Hands up'', he demanded of the Government benches, ''all
those who support the Prime Minister''.
For fatal seconds, not a hand went up. They were wary of a trap that,
in effect, they had already fallen into. Then hilariously one lone back
bencher stuck up both hands. The prank exposed uncertainty. It mattered
little as Margaret Thatcher had a handsome majority and was under no
personal threat.
All the Tories could do was to laugh shamefacedly at Foot's brilliant
parliamentary trick. That was in another era. Now, with their Commons
majority heading for a mere seven, the Tories spend most of their time
laughing shamefacedly.
They look and sound like a beaten rabble, chiefly concerned about what
they are going to do for a living after the next General Election.
Belatedly, they are becoming aware that they may not last another two
years. It is almost too late for panic because the Tories are a farce.
The unfortunate Mr Major finds that each new week turns out to be
worse than the last one. Bemused, he points out that Britain's economic
potential is now better than for 30 years. Why does his parliamentary
party feel unable to give him the essential loyalty? Why do they persist
in humiliating him? Can he really be the only one to put both hands up
for doing what is right and trusting the electorate? In vain, the
Tory-supporting Express Newspapers try to look on the bright side with
columnists and contributors writing loyal defences of Major and his
deeds. Events have taken over in determining the Prime Minister's fate;
and those events have been fashioned and continue to be created by his
parliamentary party.
Labour's Tony Blair is 39 points ahead in the polls and the new
independent unionist MP, Robert McCartney, states that he will in most
cases vote with Labour. That alone tells you how topsy-turvey Mr Major's
world has become.
In Michael Foot's day as party leader, it was Labour that came close
to disintegration in the face of militant socialism. If things go on as
they are we are looking at Tory election disaster and the possibility of
two Conservative parties, pro and anti-Europe. There is your real
potential for ''clear blue water'' between parties. Labour is set to
thrive for decades.
What is Major to do about it? He could just pack it in, despairing
that his party will ever see sense as he sees it. This might provide him
with revenge that he deserves for the way he has been treated since he
won them the last General Election.
Were he to do so, civil war could tear his party apart, sooner rather
than later.
But he says he is not a quitter. He aims to see off his critics. If
they want to challenge him for the leadership in November, so be it. He
believes that the party activists would not stand for another leader
being ditched by parliamentary factions alone. He plans to spend time in
the constituencies building on this strength for his policies. His
message: we can thwart Labour again if we keep our nerve.
This may not be much of a rallying cry, but it is the best that he has
got. In addition to all his other problems, time must now be added. Next
month another disastrous by-election looms in Littleborough and
Saddleworth and there will be more to come, knowing Major's luck. As the
majority diminishes, the Ulster Unionists must wonder what is in it for
them to continue bailing him out when his own supporters are so
reluctant to do so.
Mr Blair, who has been successful in reassuring the nation that he
would not endanger their personal finances or the economic forecasts,
has his party on constant readiness to spring a confidence motion when
he thinks he can win it. Time for the Tories is running out.
Mr Major must be contemplating how he might enforce the kind of unity
for which the pre-Thatcher Tories were renowned, at least in matters of
policy if not personalities. If anyone holds Major's fate in his hands
it is Mr Michael Heseltine. There is widespread agreement that if he was
to be made party chairman there would be a chance of Tory recovery.
For the obvious reasons, Mr Heseltine is reluctant. He likes his
present job at Trade and Industry and the leadership itself might yet
fall to him. But he could be obliged to do it and it could be made
easier for him to accept. He might be permitted to choose his successor,
for one thing. For another, should he wish to continue jetting around
the world with British businessmen on export drives, why not? He could
be manoeuvred into the chairmanship in much the same way as Tories were
obliged to take the Northern Ireland Secretaryship if it was offered to
them. It is hard to see what else Major can do. Media-hype will ensure
that he stages a reshuffle next month, but promoting one sort of Tory
and dumping another is unlikely to make much difference to the party
factions.
It might help in the opinion polls, but giving the Government a
''fresh look'' has not helped in Major's past experience. Furthermore,
it is Major's job that is on the line. After a brief hiatus, the
possibility of a leadership challenge when the party rules allow in
November is very much back to the fore.
The one thing that has seen him through so far is a Cabinet that is
almost unanimous in its affront at the thought of ditching another
leader. Even Margaret Thatcher, who has driven in another nail by
telling him that he is not ''Conservative'' enough, is against that; and
not just because of what happened to her.
So rather than reshuffle his Cabinet, he perhaps ought to be
confronting them with an oath of loyalty and self-denial. What would be
the point of a leadership election if every single member of his Cabinet
announced a refusal to stand at any stage? There is no point in a
stalking-horse candidate without a real one in the frame.
Even those Tories who have a death wish, or who have impaled
themselves on a point of high constitutional principle, might hold back
from making even bigger fools of their party in the public's eye. It is
hard to tell. The ranks of Euro-sceptics are swelling, with the ''Fresh
Start'' fanatics and others claiming more than a 100 members and
sympathisers.
Mr Major has another card which he so far has been reluctant to play
-- a referendum on a European single currency. Perhaps he will get such
a mauling at the Cannes Summit next month that his patience will snap
and the promise of a referendum (which seems inevitable anyway) will be
given.
But I wonder if even this would be sufficient for those who seem
determined to do him down. At last week's notorious meeting with the
''Fresh Start'' group, the subject of a referendum was not even raised.
Nothing will do for them, it seems, but a statement from him now that he
will never agree to a single currency.
They seem to think that they can control the situation and that by
holding such supposedly private meetings with him, they can keep up the
pressure without the political life of Major ebbing away. They should
know now, from the aftermath of last week's bruising encounter with him,
that the situation is out of control.
It is hard not to come to the conclusion that there is nothing more
that Major himself can do before the autumn. Hands up those who believe
that the party just has to unite itself?

JAPANESE finance houses in the City of London are braced for the
current stock market crisis in their home country to continue.
However, the general belief is that the UK economy will be largely
untouched by any further falls in the Nikkei index. The index closed on
Friday at 14,703 -- 62% lower than its peak in December 1989 when it
reached 38,915.
Japan's economic problems are likely to be compounded further at the
end of the month when some of the country's biggest companies are
forecast to report losses.
Banks are sitting on huge sums of bad debt which are seriously
restricting credit and putting at risk economic recovery.
The current pessimism is also increased by the strength of the yen
which is undermining the profit performance of much of Japanese
industry.
Unlike the Nikkei, the London stock market has risen strongly in
recent months on the expectation that domestic interest rates might have
peaked and that the cost of borrowing in America might soon be cut.

FOR THE PRESIDENT'S EYES ONLY -- Secret Intelligence and the American
Presidency from Washington to Bush
By Christopher Andrew
HarperCollins: #25
GEORGE Washington, the first US President, was also the first
incumbent of that office to grasp the value of secret intelligence in
the practice of statecraft. Spies, cyphers, and double-agents played a
major role in the revolutionary struggle against England.
Incredibly, it took another 30 American heads of state, the threat of
a catastrophic world war, and almost 170 years for the concept to regain
its place in the list of White House priorities.
The ''black arts'' of espionage went into terminal decline after the
War of Independence. America itself went into one of its periodic bouts
of isolationism. The outside world impinged little on a continent
absorbed completely in its own internal affairs.
Even the watershed of the Civil War failed to produce an intelligence
network worthy of the name on either side.
Ironically, it was the British, the ''auld enemy'' of 1776, and
past-masters in double-dealing, who stepped in to help revive
intelligence-gathering during the Second World War. America, a vital
ally, was long on resources but short on information about enemy
intentions and dispositions.
Eisenhower, the post-war inheritor of a still fledgeling service, was
the first modern President to realise what intelligence was really
about. It was as important to know what the enemy did not possess as it
was to know what he did.
Ike pioneered reconnaissance flights by spy planes over the Soviet
Union, and later the first satellite surveillance systems. The resultant
photographic evidence allowed him to resist his own military-industrial
complex and save the American taxpayer untold billions of dollars.
Without revealing his sources, he rejected the vested-interest clamour
to ''close the missile gap''. He knew there was no gap. The Russians
were still way behind in numbers and in nuclear technology.
It made him an unsung economic hero. More importantly, it gave him an
inside edge in his dealings with the Kremlin and helped defuse a number
of crises which might otherwise have escalated out of control.
Christopher Andrew's fascinating study shows that, as the intelligence
community grew and diversified, and its function became steadily more
vital to the everyday performance of government, the attitudes of
various Presidents shaped events on the world stage as much as the raw
data they were fed.
Lyndon Baines Johnson and Richard Nixon both suspected that the CIA
had conspired against them in an attempt to prevent their election. LBJ
once described the men from Langley, the CIA headquarters in Virginia,
as ''a bunch of Ivy League liberals''.
Ronald Reagan's perceptions were coloured by his make-believe
Hollywood image of spy and counter-spy. Ten of his first 30 B-movies
involved fantasies based on fighting foreign subversion.
Even George Bush, the first former director of the CIA to become
President, and the man who should have had the most realistic
appreciation of intelligence capabilities -- and limitations -- based
many of his key strategic decisions on personal impressions of foreign
leaders such as Mikhail Gorbachev.
Oddly enough, Gerald Ford, a man rated as something less than an
intellectual giant, came to office with no preconceptions about the
intelligence community. As a result, his approach was one of the most
balanced of modern times.
John F Kennedy inherited a disaster in the making in the shape of
Cuba. His approach had been defined by his own wartime experience of
encoding and decoding low-level naval signals, a task he found intensely
tedious.
Students who now attend the JFK School of Government at Harvard
University are required to read a 20-page condensed history entitled The
CIA to 1961. Those who digest its contents know more about intelligence
work than Kennedy himself did when he entered the White House.
Cuba was a prime example of the best use and the worst misuse of
intelligence. Rogue elements in the CIA led Kennedy to believe that a
US-sponsored invasion by Cuban exiles would trigger a popular uprising
against Fidel Castro.
He approved a clandestine training programme for a brigade of 1400
exiles in Florida. Within weeks, it was the most open ''secret'' in
Latin America. But the projected invasion had developed a momentum all
of its own.
By the time the proxy force hit the beaches in the Bay of Pigs in
April, 1961, Castro's men were waiting. Nearly 200 died in the first
wave. The others were pinned down, shelled and machine-gunned, and
finally forced to surrender when their ammunition and their hope ran
out.
JFK realised the futility of the exercise at the last moment. He
vetoed supporting naval gunfire and air strikes by US bombers. It was,
in Cuban exiles' eyes, an unforgiveable betrayal.
But Kennedy was learning. Just 18 months after the Bay of Pigs'
fiasco, he kept his cool as the world teetered on the brink of nuclear
holocaust. A U2 spy flight produced photographic evidence of Soviet
ballistic missiles at two Cuban bases.
For eight days, the US imposed a naval quarantine and stood toe-to-toe
with Moscow, demanding the withdrawal of the threat.
JFK had two advantages. The photographic evidence was irrefutable and
gave him the moral high ground internationally. And he had the
invaluable inside track on Kremlin thinking. The British were supplying
information from their most highly-placed agent in the Kremlin, Oleg
Penkovsky.
Between satellite scans of Soviet forces which showed that they were
not ready for all-out war, and Penkovsky's assertion that Soviet Premier
Nikita Kruschev was bluffing, the US President held all the cards.
As the world held its breath Kruschev backed down abruptly. But even
the wonders of satellite technology could not always provide advance
warning of impending crises. Good intelligence should diminish surprise.
Even the best cannot eliminate it altogether.
Perhaps the most valuable lessons to emerge from Professor Andrew's
study are that incoming Presidents should not harbour unrealistic
expectations about the scope and capabilities of intelligence; and that
the intelligence community itself should avoid raising those
expectations in the first place.
In the end, most of the great successes and failures of this century
in terms of espionage have been governed not by technical wizardry or
human ingenuity, but by the personality and temperament of the man in
the Oval Office.

PROSPECTS for Falkirk-based bus body-builder Walter Alexander look
most encouraging with the order book up 42% to #55m and with
rapidly-expanding exports now accounting for half the business.
Last year, it built over 1300 bodies of which 40% by value were
exported chiefly to Singapore and Hong Kong. Turnover increased 15% to
#55.6m which resulted in profits before tax jumping 81% to #2.74m.
The company was the subject of a #7.4m management buy-out led by
current chief executive Ian Galloway in April 1992. The vendor was
Spotlaunch, a company created by the Granville finance house in 1990 to
acquire the family-controlled company which was then quoted but was
struggling because of problems in its bedding activities. The price paid
was #32m.
One arm, the impressive Domnic Hunter filtration business, was floated
in March last year.
Mr Galloway said yesterday that a public quotation for Alexander is
unlikely as the company has no need for money, having paid off all
borrowings. However, a way will have to be found in due course for the
buy-out backers, including Standard Life, Dunedin Ventures, Clydesdale
Bank and Melville Street Investments to realise their investment if they
wish.
It increased UK market share by 2% to 33% last year with the strongest
growth being in the midi-sector where market share has increased to 25%
although there is also a good presence in double-deckers and Ultra
low-floor vehicles. The company has the ability to rapidly adapt to
changes in the market.
Some 710 people are employed in Falkirk and another 240 in Belfast who
make the ultra low-floor type as well as minibuses and fire engines.
Another 50 people are being recruited to raise the total workforce to
about 1000.
There has been a substantial improvement in productivity with manhours
per body having dropped from 1700 hours in 1991 to 1100 hours last year
and is now below 1000 hours and still falling. That is partly as a
result of capital investment and improved engineering design as well as
from the efforts of the employees.
As 48% of the UK bus fleet by number is over 12 years old and 60% by
seat capacity, there are excellent medium-term prospects once the the
bus industry's spate of acquisitions and consolidations settles down.
Established in 1924, the company has been a major supplier of
aluminium bus bodies for the last 21 years and since 1975 has sold over
5000 units overseas comprising both kits and fully-assembled units.
Mr Galloway said that the continuing success in a highly-demanding
environment provides an excellent demonstration of the key virtues of
customer-driven product development and superior whole-life operating
costs.
A joint venture in Guangzhou in China is being developed which will
supply body kits for the Hong Kong market with an eventual plan to cater
for the huge Chinese market directly while a collaboration agreement is
being established in South Africa.
One cloud on the horizon is that Brussels is trying to harmonise a
European standard based upon a 12-metre single decker with a decision
due in the autumn.
Mr Galloway said that a single-decker-only standard was not
appropriate for the UK where there is a growing privatised market. He
added that the European Commission does not understand what is happening
in Britain where there is a demand for double-deckers.

BARCLAYS will announce this week that it is paying around #500m for
Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisers which will propel its BZW
securities house subsidiary into the front rank of global fund
management, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Currently BZW Investment Management has over #50bn of funds under
management, making it number two in Britain to Mercury Asset
Management's #65bn.
The acquisition of the American house, which is jointly owned by Wells
Fargo, the US bank that relieved Midland Bank of its disastrous purchase
of Crocker National Bank, and Nikko Securities of Japan, will add
another $170bn (#110bn) to its funds under management for a total of
about #165bn.
For the last six months, BZW has been involved in a strategic review
of its American activities where it is currently a tiny player in
comparison with the Wall Street giants even with 1500 people mostly
employed on the bond operations.
Led by deputy chief executive Stirling-born Donald Brydon, the
conclusion was that to buy a US investment bank could cost billions of
dollars and introduce a highly-volatile element of profits which would
not be acceptable to Barclays chief executive Martin Taylor.
US broking house Salomon Brothers alone lost $963m (#617m) last year
while Barclays saw an near-trebling to #1859m of which BZW contributed
#242m, down from #532m.
One major attraction of the Wells Fargo Nikko acquisition is that both
currently concentrate on quantitative fund management where managers
track various indices. Traditionally the rewards are less than on
performance-orientated funds but earnings growth is much more assured.
City reaction is likely to be highly positive as at a stroke BZW has
become the largest quantitative investment house in the world for a
relatively modest sum and established a rising platform of earnings.
It also means that Barclays is unlikely to be making any more
significant acquisitions for perhaps another year.

BRITISH Steel today kicks off this week's company results and is
expected to start on a high note.
After a first half which saw pre-tax profits soar from #27m to #159m,
market analysts are looking for approaching #500m for the full year.
Estimates in fact range from #470m to #520m and the dividend projection
is for 6.5p against just 2p last time.
Analysts, though, will be wondering how long the good times will last
and when will the cycle peak. The bullish view is that British Steel is
set fair until 1998 but others point to signs of price weakness and a
capacity surge in the US as evidence that a faster downturn is likely.
The picture should become clearer after the company has had its say on
prospects.
Thursday sees the half-year results from TSB and also Lonrho. The
former is expected to unveil between #255m and #290m compared with #226m
in the first half of last year. Analysts are projecting an interim
lifted to 4p-4.2p compared with the previous half-year payout of 3.54p.
Recent interest in TSB has centred more on the possibility of it
bidding for a building society or even on itself being a bid target.
Along with the other banks, TSB will have benefited from a better
bad-debt scenario.
Higher metal and sugar prices should have helped Lonrho register an
improvement in first-half profits. Estimates, though, are fairly wide
ranging at between #45m and #53.5m which would compare with #41m in the
first of the group's last financial year. The interim dividend is
projected at between 2p (unchanged) and 2.5p.
The half-year figures from Airtours are out today with the market
pencilling in a loss of around #30m though one estimate goes as high as
#37m. Tour operators traditionally make losses in the first six months
which normally take in winter. At the same time last year the loss was
#17.6m. This time round, though, the company would have had to absorb
the cost of expansion into Scandinavia which has yet to bear fruit for
the group.
First Leisure, which includes the Blackpool Tower among its varied
leisure activities, shows off its half-year progress tomorrow but
brokers expect profits to have been rather flat although there should be
some improvement over the #14m pre-tax chalked up last year.
In a trading update in April the company reported that overall
activity in the year to date was encouragingly ahead of last year with
the performance in line with expectations.
Another batch of regional electricity companies are also due to report
their annual results this week. Profit increases and dividend hikes have
been substantial so far in the reporting season and this is expected to
continue for most of them.

ALISTAIR CRAIG is correct when he highlights the consequences of
Labour's plans to introduce a ''national'' minimum wage (June 15). There
is another aspect of Labour's wages policy of which we should all be
aware, particularly in Scotland.
Labour have supported the health service unions and Royal College of
Nurses in their opposition to local pay bargaining. Should Labour win
the next election and estalish a devolved assembly in Edinburgh, with
the power to raise income tax by 3p in the pound, thus making a pound
earned in Scotland worth only 97p, will ''national'', ie UK-wide, pay
bargaining still apply?
Will the health service and other employers in Scotland still be able
to retain and attract talented employees, in competition with employers
south of the Border? How will companies such as banks, with employees
moving within their organisations between England and Scotland, organise
their salaries?
Are we going to see two different salary scales for the same job or
incentive schemes to encourage people to return to work in Scotland?
This is what the devolution debate should be about and not just
misty-eyed optimism, based on vague promises of better government once
we have it based in Edinburgh. Will people really accept higher taxation
for the privilege of living here, whatever extra benefits are promised
as a result?
Finally, on the back page of your Business Section (June 15), in one
small paragraph, you report that new businesses are currently being
created in Scotland at the rate of 150 a week. This is good news so be
careful not to give it too much prominence.
How many of these businesses , many of which are started by young
entrepreneurs, will want to take on new employees as they expand, could
afford to do so with a national minimum wage of #4 per hour?

IS Alistair J Craig (Letters, June 15) living in the same country as
myself?
His hypothetical apprentice hairdresser 20 years ago could have either
suffered the contemporary equivalent of what is nowadays the less than
ideal wage of #2.50 per hour until his or her experience gained a more
reasonable salary, or simply left his or her employ and sought work
elsewhere -- perhaps in one of the (then) industrial towns of Central
Scotland.
He or she might have had to sacrifice their ''dreams and
aspirations'', but would hardly have found themselves ''on the scrap
heap''.
If Labour brings ''the economy and the country to its knees by
economic madness'' then it will do so by lifting it on to its knees and
off its backside, where it is at present. The balance of payments
deficit has never been higher, our gross national product is a joke,
and, every day, ways and means of massaging unemployment figures are
implemented.
We witness the greed of the ''fat cats'' who now run our privatised
utilities while security guards and shop workers on part-time,
short-term contracts earn a remuneration which is deemed by the European
Union to be well below the poverty level.
How on earth can someone justify an annual income of half a million
pounds for overseeing the provision of the most basic requirements of
life -- water and energy -- to the public at large, while some 10
million people in Britain are living below the poverty line and are
struggling to pay for the same utilities?
In order to allow every Briton to enjoy a decent standard of living
and buy their own home (does that have a famililar ring to it?) a more
realistic level of income for all is long overdue. Potential lenders
would also be able to assess more accurately the risks attached to every
mortgage/loan application.
A minimum wage is long overdue but it would be extremely foolish of Mr
Blair to commit the next Labour Government to one at the present time.
However, a commitment to establishing one in, say, the third year of
government could be made.
By then, Mr Blair would have had two years to try to rectify the most
damaging of the present Government's crass policies and tackle
unemployment, homelessness, hospital and ward closures, house
repossessions, and the seemingly unregulated and self-awarded salaries
of the utilities barons.
Finally, I would like to ask Mr Craig why, in his scenario, the
apprentice hairdresser leaving his or her employ would necessarily find
themselves ''unemployed and on benefit, disillusioned and bitter with no
future to speak of''. Is it perhaps because he or she would simply find
that the ratio of available jobs to prospective employees is in a
dreadful state of imbalance?
I find that a shocking state of affairs and a sad indictment on a
Government that inherited a country that was very proud of its
industrial prowess and is now almost a Third World nation.

GIVEN her evident talents and achievements it is perhaps too much to
expect Councillor Jean McFadden to have much knowledge of Comparative
Theology. Those who have dabbled in that ultimate vanity of the human
mind may wince at the shallow sentimentality of her opinion that
Christians and Muslims ''believe in the same God''.
Her remark reminded me of a cartoon I saw some years ago. An obviously
Anglican vicar, having stumbled across a Satanic Mass, complete with
Hand of Glory, being conducted in his church, beams beneficently on the
assembled Sabbath and observes that worship takes many forms.
What purpose is ''kirking'', ''mosquing'', or ''synagoguing'' now
supposed to serve? Is it a ritual to ward off disaster from the council
during its period in office? Or is it intended to indicate what divinely
inspired and policed moral values the council intends to follow?
It is evident that the Church of Scotland has now lost its special
place in the lives of those British citizens domiciled north of the
Tweed. In a religiously pluralist society, most of whose effective
institutions are secular, it seems mistaken to elevate any one creed to
a position of dominance.
If a ceremony of some sort is needed should it not reflect the true
spiritual orientation of the community as a whole? Might Glasgow Stock
Exchange host a blessing of the council by the Goddess Fortuna as She
currently has no dedicated temple in the city despite the remarkable
proliferation of shrines dedicated to her service in recent months?

ERIC STOCKTON'S attack on John MacLeod's excellent article, and upon
the Christian faith, is remarkable in its blanket condemnation of
Christian morality, and the Bible (June 13).
Perhaps he considers the ''liberal secular ethic'', that has been more
or less the prevailing doctrine since the 50s, to have produced
something beneficial, though I fail to see it. But then I am old enough
to remember what Britain was once like to live in, under a basically
Christian system.
For instance all that follows was practically unheard of. Rape. Child
sexual abuse. Unruly school children. Drunken young men and women with
resultant noise and disorder. Supposedly alternative lifestyles of
homosexuals and lesbians. Witchcraft, tarot cards, etc. Vandalism.
Murder an everyday occurrence. Etc, etc.
During the last war we were tyold we were fighting for a land fit for
heroes to live in. I think it is becoming a land fit only for perverts.
This is what the humanist ''liberal secular ethic'' has done through
the removal of the basically Christian legislation. Legislation that
gave protection with freedom. Freedom from the oppression of Godless
humanism.

I HAVE a problem with the public library service which seems
intractable.
Over the years I have requested many books from my local branch
library. Those it does not stock it usually obtains from a specialist
library fairly quickly, but with out-of-print novels it seems it cannot
deliver.
On investigation I am told that such books ''are not available and are
no longer in print''. I would have thought that out-of-print books are
more likely to be sought by intending borrowers than those still to be
found in bookshops, but perhaps I am missing something somewhere.
My point, however, is not to decry the normally excellent service, but
to obtain copies of the half-dozen out-of-print novels I wish to read.
Can anyone suggest how?

I WAS horrified to read Jack McLean's article about the Scottish Open
Volleyball Tournament in Perth. His comments and criticisms of Perth are
at such variance from reality as he is masquerading as he does as a
journalist (June 12).
I would invite all those who read his article to visit Perth and see
for themsmelves what a delightful and welcoming place it is and how so
unfair and misleading his article was.

SAD to note the defensive laissez faire attitude of your Catholic
teacher correspondent Hugh McLoughlin (June 13). He maintains the
obvious that no-one deliberately fosters sectarianism in Catholic (or
equally Protestant) schools, but he ignores the fundamental evil of the
current system, the segregation itself.
When we separate our five-year-old pupils we take the most important
step in promoting the poisonous bigotry existing at present in the West
of Scotland.
And so we blunder hopefully onwards all with approval of organised
religion. This is hardly a progressive attitude to take.

DUGALD CAMERON, director of Glasgow School of Art, speaks eloquently
about the sustained and serious damage being inflicted on education by
the Conservative Government (June 12). We should give him our full
support.
The School of Art has a national and international reputation for
excellence in fine art, design, architecture, and planning. Despite the
rigours of the present economic difficulties, and the injury to morale,
the students and staff remain wholly committed to achieving their
outstanding best.
However, education nurtures creativity and technical skills. By
systematically undermining this, the Government demonstrates that it
seeks to know the cost of everything but understands the value of
nothing.
We are throwing away the skills we need. And they are not only our
most precious resource, they are the cornerstone of a sound economy
which, although it stretches credulity, is the Conservative Government's
avowed aim.
It is not altruism but naked self-interest to ask when we will again
enable people to reach their potential and fulfilment in education
through which they will repay society a thousandfold.

AS a job sharer of five years standing I take exception to Barbara
McCormick's letter on several counts (June 14).
She complains about the number of unemployed teachers unable to secure
posts. Job sharing employs two people.
None of the classes shared by myself and my partner suffer from having
two teachers. In fact, senior classes have indicated that they
appreciate the change of style and approach, while junior classes take
the change for granted.
Given the pressure that teachers are under at the moment, someone who
works part time has far more energy and enthusiasm, as well as time to
prepare, correct and develop new work.
It is, at best, patronising to assume that part time work means part
time commitment.
To use Barbara McCormick's word, it is ludicrous to assume that PTAs
and school boards would be aware of the effects of job sharing.
Is she employed as a teacher? Or is it that, having attended school,
she knows all about educating children?
I would suggest that the ''silence of your Education Correspondent''
speaks volumes regarding the appreciation of the potential benefits of
job sharing.

PETER Evans's review of the new book, Scotland for Backpackers, shows
he hasn't a clue what modern-day backpacking is.
Do you want to be read by young people or is it strictly for miserable
old fuddy-duddies whose idea of a great time is ''cakes and pots of
tea''? Like most of those geriatrics, he displays petulance. His
complaint about the number of pages on Glasgow compared with Edinburgh
is just plain rubbish.
Furthermore, any guide book which dissuades people from visiting
Dundee is obviously only doing its job.
If someone young and fresh were to have a look at this book they might
recognise its true worth as the means to a fun and fabulous holiday in a
beautiful country, a book which even older Herald readers will
appreciate as an easy means to getting their college-age children out of
the house in the summer.

IT is a quarter of a century since the first North Sea oil was landed
from the Argyll field. Within that time the country became in effect
self-sufficient in oil, although it has continued to import some grades
which are not produced from the offshore domestic industry. The
advantages have been enormous, although there is bound to be argument
about whether the colossal revenues have been wisely used. Conservatives
prefer to believe that they have funded the remarkable expansion of the
country's foreign investment portfolios, especially and most
remuneratively in south-east Asia. Labour feels instead that they have
been used to finance high levels of unemployment, rather than investment
in domestic industry. Given the way in which the Treasury does not
earmark revenues for particular spending purposes, that sort of debate
is endless. It is the case that every West European state (including
Germany whose ''guest workers'' obscure its employment statistics) has
had intractable problems with unemployment, especially in the past
decade. At least our domestic oil revenues prevented the cost of meeting
the financial consequences of that unemployment, and other fast-rising
social security charges, overwhelming the public finances or vastly
increasing taxation. Whichever side of the debate on spending the oil
revenues is preferred, there is no doubt that they made life easier for
the Treasury.
The returns to the Treasury, and to the oil companies, were maximised
by the decision of both Labour and Tory adminstrations to boost output
steadily and ignore the arguments of doomsters and conservationists
about the short life expectancy of fossil fuels. In fact world oil
reserves have increased every year in the past 25, and the very high oil
prices of the mid 1970s have not remotely been sustained. Given the
impact of inflation and the fall in the value of the dollar, the real
price of oil is not different from what it was before the (politically
motivated) Arab price hike in 1974. In retrospect the hunger of the
Treasury (and spending Ministers) has been justified: we would all have
been worse off had the oil remained under the sea-bed to produce low
monetary returns now, rather than being brought up and sold. More, and
no matter how ironically, the high Arab price regime, sustained through
Opec, the oil cartel, kept the price high for long enough to finance the
expansion of the North Sea province, particularly those fields which
would have been marginal, or even unprofitable, at pre-Opec prices. The
development of such fields and the need to enhance the returns from them
greatly stimulated the technical improvements of oil extraction and this
in turn encouraged moves into ever-deeper waters.
The benefits of this shift have been in allowing the exploitation of
newly discovered reserves (of some magnitude) in hostile physical
environments and in permitting the development of onshore industries
with the technological capacity to explore for oil offshore anywhere in
the world and in waters deeper than the shallows of the Gulf of Mexico
or the North Sea itself -- the developments in the Norwegian Sea and in
the Atlantic, west of Shetland, are harbingers of the oil industry's
future and Britain's role in it, where previously a near-US monopoly
seemed assured.
Not all the consequences were positive. For a time in the 1980s the
idea of sterling as a petro-currency boosted its value to an extent
which damaged exports, particularly of manufactured goods and some of
the country's industrial base. Industry is only now recovering from that
blow, and it will need another decade of effort (and much new
investment, only now beginning to come forth) before its effect is
overcome. And, possibly, the extent of the largesse the oil revenues
conferred was too much for some imaginations, and gave a false
impression of our prospects; yet, though very large, oil never achieved
the dominance either in the national income or the state's revenues that
it did in developing countries with large oil reserves but no
diversified economic base.
Within Scotland, the effects of oil may also be debated. It
contributed to the relative decline of the west by boosting the east,
notably Grampian which has enjoyed an outstanding regional experience.
Aberdeen is the major beneficiary among cities (and the failure of
Dundee to profit much remains a concern) but Edinburgh also benefited
and was boosted as a financial centre. Thus Scotland has gained a new
financial confidence, sadly not matched as yet by a parallel rebirth of
social or political confidence. Scotland must benefit in the next 25
years as the notion that offshore oil is a short-lived phenomenon is
steadily debunked by experience.

THE incessant hunt for students conducted by universities up and down
the country has sometimes seemed to have everything to do with money and
very little to do with education. The oddest courses have been developed
and the student-staff ratio has often worsened alarmingly. The latest
initiative in Celtic studies by two Scottish universities and Trinity
College, Dublin, appears refreshingly different. Amalgamating the
undoubted expertise of Irish academics with that of Aberdeen and
Strathclyde universities is sheer common sense. Each of the universities
brings skills in different specialisations under the academic Celtic
umbrella, and further gains will be made by the exposure of students and
postgraduates to different institutions and regimes. So far, so good.
But why Celtic studies?
Professor Tom Devine of Strathclyde has always had a canny eye for
developments within his own university and further afield. He insists
that the initiative has been developed because there is a growing
interest in Celtic studies among students, and that this has become a
positive demand for an expansion in teaching of the subject. If he is
correct this development is welcome, if overdue. Celtic studies
encompass fascinating elements under the general heading of language,
history, and culture. It is not a fringe subject and there is nothing of
twilight about it. Celtic studies deal with the historical story of an
important part of Europe and one which has been neglected, particularly
in Scotland, in favour of the teaching of the history of what can
generally be called English culture. This has led to generations of
Scottish schoolchildren realising that they know a good deal about
English history, but little about the history of their own country. Much
the same has applied in universities until fairly recently.
This argument can be taken further; indeed Professor Devine appears
determined to do so. He see the rise in interest in Celtic subjects as
linked to what he calls ''the national renaissance''. There is nothing
wrong with cultural nationalism as long as it does not develop into
denigration of the culture of others. There may even, it seems clear, be
financial advantages from the new collaboration in the form of
postgraduate students from the United States who are keen at present to
study in Ireland, but not notably interested in Scotland. The prospects
are exciting, and if they lead to further development of serious study
of an important part of our national culture, so much the better.

WHEN Flora Campbell arrived at Strichen School, in the heart of
Aberdeenshire, one disbelieving pupil was overheard to say: ''That canna
be a teacher -- she's ower bonny!'' But however grim the image was
supposed to be, a teacher she was.
And her physical appearance was confirmed to me years later by my own
mother who remembered her as the incomparable beauty of her day in the
Buchan district.
Well, I'm delighted to say that, 70 years later, that beauty has
defied all time. The complexion is still cream-like, the smile
devastatingly disarming and the eyes tell of that young spirit which
lingers within us even when old age beckons.
We lunched in the charming Perthshire haven of Comrie, catching up
with our common heritage in that cattle country where she grew up near
the village of New Deer, at the farm of Auchmunziel (pronounced
Auchmingel) which means ''a field near the moss''.
Flora Campbell absorbed the life of that land, its parks and peesies
and distant clump of Bennachie, all resting 'neath the canopy of that
great northern sky.
And by the time she changed her name to Flora Garry, she was toying
with the language of poetry. Yet the extraordinary fact, as she
approaches her 95th birthday, is that she left it so late to gain her
rightful place as the most truly authentic poetess writing in the
Lowland language of North-east Scotland today.
Not that Flora Garry would claim anything. It was left to others to
give her work a first public airing when she had already passed the
allotted span.
Only her good luck in surviving another 25 years has brought us the
privilege of her collected poems, published this week by that faithful
watchdog of Scottish literary talent, Gordon Wright of Edinburgh.
Because she had written practically nothing until her forties, this
lady who came in with the century has still only a slim volume of work.
But it's quality that counts.
So why did she wait so long? Flora's own explanation is interesting:
''I suppose the answer is that, as happiness has no history, neither
does happiness write poetry. It needed wartime itself, with its
emotional stress and upheaval, the feeling of danger, the future all
unknown, to provide the necessary stimulus.''
The years between produced a tragedy too close for poetry. Brother
Frank, remembered in our district as a handsome athlete with rich
baritone voice, had gone off to the Shanghai Police in the 1920s, daring
one night to corner some robbers in a house.
From under a bed, one pulled a gun and shot at Frank, who managed to
pull his own gun and kill the man. Minutes later he himself slumped
dead.
Flora was then on the point of marrying her cousin, Robert Campbell
Garry, destined to be a distinguished medical professor at Glasgow
University, the man who gained early fame as the young doctor who
obtained his own supply of the newly discovered insulin -- and became
the first person in this country to use it.
So Flora Garry became the professor's wife and wrote a delightful poem
of that title.
But if there is a puzzle in her late start, there is none at all
concerning her inspiration. She comes to the point by recalling Benjamin
Skinner, a legendary North-east schoolmaster, who was her boss at
Strichen in 1925. Knowing the pedigree of all his pupils, Skinner would
observe: ''You can conjure the Devil out of your soul, but never your
grandmother from your bones.''
How true! Flora's parents, Archie and Helen Campbell, may have farmed
at Auchmunziel but their hearts were in writing. Archie was the
colourful athlete-cum-newspaper-columnist, a kind of Charlie Allan of
his day, while Helen was known for her broadcast plays and beautiful
voice.
Flora was recalling over lunch how people used to gather at
Auchmunziel for good music and lively talk, most of it in the Buchan
dialect in which she writes. Words were the breath of life. Among the
ones her father used to make up, we laughed over his
''Jeelywabblichers''.
It arose after he had been asked to a genteel afternoon tea and came
home saying he was still hungry. Asked if he didn't get a good tea,
Archie replied: ''Caa yon a tea? Naethin worth ettin. Jist a puckle
jeelywabblichers.''
Forever after, fancy pieces were known at Auchmunziel by Archie's
colourful invention.
Flora waxes eloquent about her native language, its rich resonant
vowels and consonants, its strong rhythms and cadences, and wonders how
we could ever be ashamed of it. Yet that, she concludes sadly, is what
has happened with too many of us.
In her eventide years in Comrie, she and her poetry are the living
proof that we have a language to be proud of.

Kirsty Scott reports that as Turkey struggles to cope with the
ever-increasing influx of tourists, the country's poor road system and
bad drivers create a holiday hazard that is claiming a growing number of
lives
BEHIND every accident are statistics which saw it coming, and the
weekend coach tragedy in Turkey is no exception. The country, quite
simply, has one of the worst traffic accident death rates in the world,
a fact which does not sit well with its increasing popularity as a
holiday destination.
In recent years it's been suggested that Turkey's rudimentary road
network and notoriously reckless driving habits have meant an average of
one road accident death and 10 injuries every 50 minutes.
Most visitors to the country have a driving tale to tell, whether it
is the white-knuckle trip across Istanbul in a taxi or the near
collision with a truck or a bus on a narrow, potholed road.
The head-on crash, which killed three Scots and a lorry driver on
Saturday, happened on what has been described as a ''lonely stretch of
road''. Dual carriageways are still rare in Turkey.
At the British Embassy in Ankara yesterday, vice-consul Trudie Pak,
from Ayrshire, who was helping to deal with the aftermath of the
accident, said it was the third crash involving a coach this tourist
season. Earlier this year an elderly couple from Merseyside were among
21 people killed when their tour bus fell 30 feet down a ravine.
Mrs Pak was unwilling to be drawn into a detailed discussion of
Turkey's roads system but said it was not as developed as the UK's.
''Therefore, you are looking at single-track roads, two-way traffic.
There aren't many dual carriageways so, as a result of the driving
conditions, you have to be a little more careful here than you do in the
UK.''
By 1989 motorways only made up 125km of Turkey's 60,000km road network
and while that figure has increased there is still a dearth of straight,
four-lane tarmac.
At the same time, traffic volumes have increased at an alarming rate.
The feasibility study for the first Bosporus Bridge, which was built in
the early 1970s, predicted it would reach a capacity of 140,000 vehicle
crossings a day by this year. The figure was reached 15 years early in
1980.
In addition, a large proportion of Turkey's freight is carried by road
-- as much as 80% just five years ago.
Coach travel is also a popular form of transport, not just for
tourists. ''It's the way most people get about,'' said Mrs Pak.
The tourists caught up in the weekend's accident were following a
familiar route; a flight into Dalaman Airport then a late-night drive to
their resort. Many of them were asleep when the collision occurred.
But then it is affordability, and not convenience or safety, which is
one of the key ingredients for Turkey's growing popularity as a holiday
destination. This summer it is the third most popular destination for
British tourists behind Spain and Greece with about 650,000 Britons
expected to fly out this year. Two years ago the figure stood at
400,000. Initially British tourists tended to stick to the Aegean coast
but are now branching out into the other resorts.
A spokeswoman for the holiday firm Lunn Poly said Turkey was
performing particularly well this summer. ''According to our estimates
Turkey has increased its market share from 4% in the summer of 1994 to
7% this summer.''
Alongside the cheap prices -- beer at 30p a pint, and a full
three-course meal with drinks for less than #10 -- the country is noted
for its excellent hospitality and its eclectic mix of history and beach
resorts. The tourism trade is still at an early stage so it still
retains something of an unspoiled feel.
It is a tricky dilemma for countries such as Turkey which are drawing
in growing numbers of visitors but which don't have the basic
infrastructure in place to deal with them. There have been similar
complaints about North Africa where a tourist boom has put up plenty of
resorts and hotels but where road travel can still be an experience at
best, and a nightmare at worst.
Whether this accident and others like it will help change the face of
Turkey's roads network remains to be seen, but there is no doubt that
the country's tourist trade will bounce back from this latest tragedy as
it has done from others. Just last summer, tourism authorities said they
were confident they could continue to keep British visitors pouring in
despite a series of deadly bomb attacks by Kurdish terrorists.
Tourists are a resilient breed and while accidents, terrorism and
shootings cause concern and occasional panic, the flights to Turkey and
elsewhere will take off from British airports this coming week just as
they did in the past couple of days.

Terry Houston reports on the secrets of success of an American
entrepreneur who has made several fortunes
THE figure is trim and lithe, the handshake firm, and there is a
vigour in his step which belies his 75 years -- not to mention a
transatlantic night flight from Georgia, USA, followed by a long car
drive from Manchester.
Nearby, as the interview progresses in Glasgow's Hilton Hotel, sits
his 38-year-old second wife Charlene, keeping their five-year-old,
tousle-haired son Corbett amused.
Wilson Harrell, self-made millionaire, business guru, former Second
World War ace pilot and a fervent apostle of the world entrepreneurial
movement, is in town and holding court on the business of doing
business. And when an iconoclast like Wilson Harrell speaks, the men and
women in charge of mighty corporations listen.
Although few of us know it, here in Britain we all owe him a debt of
eternal gratitude. It was he who persuaded Andrex, back in the fifties,
to start manufacturing soft toilet paper in the UK for US bases, a
benefit of civilisation which was to spill over into British civilian
life.
Head-hunted by Russell Griggs, business development director of
Scottish Enterprise, Wilson Harrell is here in Glasgow to address the
largest entrepreneurial conference ever staged in Scotland.
The conference today in the city's Royal Concert Hall has been
organised by Scottish Enterprise as part of its Year of the Entrepreneur
campaign to increase Scotland's business birthrate and to alter our
somewhat ambivalent national attitude towards entrepreneurial
activities.
Almost 500 delegates are attending to hear Wilson Harrell deliver a
keynote speech -- his first in Scotland -- which will challenge some of
our fundamental notions on how the world conducts its business.
He believes the giant corporations and multi-nationals have had their
day. They are twentieth-century dinosaurs, slowly strangling under the
weight of their own inefficient internal bureaucracies and divisive
internal politics.
It is not the business giants which are the true generators of wealth
and jobs, he says. It is the world's entrepreneurs -- a great body of
businessmen and women in charge of fast-growing companies which
consistently beat the big boys in any niche market they choose to enter.
Today he tours the world, advocating that major corporations start
adopting total quality entrepreneurship -- a system he has developed by
identifying and refining the common denominators which appear within the
general mind set of all entrepreneurs.
He, himself, speaks from a depth of personal experience. In his
lifetime, he has been in charge of something like 100 companies worth
more than half a billion dollars. Among his more notable triumphs has
been taking over for $30,000 a company teetering on the edge of
bankruptcy and transforming its product, a spray cleaning agent, into
the biggest seller in America, and selling the business for $7.5m.
Indeed, the life of Wilson Harrell is imbued with a Boys' Own Paper
flavour. Born and raised in Georgia, it was his father, also an
entrepreneur, who fostered in him a kindred spirit. When Wilson was six
the two went into business together -- as partners in a lemonade stand.
''My father supplied the capital, I supplied the labour,'' he says.
''It was treated seriously. Every month we had a regular business
meeting, at which we would divide the profits. Eventually I had six
lemonade stands. It was one of my proudest moments when I bought out my
father when I was eight.''
Wilson Harrell is no stranger to Britain, having served at bases in
the UK as an American air force captain during the Second World War. An
ace combat pilot, he was shot down over France, behind enemy lines,
towards the tail-end of the war.
He and three other fighter pilots had attacked massed squadrons of 67
enemy aircraft. He destroyed four before his own P38 plane was brought
down, about 100 miles from Paris. For 11 days French farmers hid the
badly burned fighter pilot. Much of that period he spent buried in a
grave-like trench in a cornfield, where he had to breathe through a
garden hose.
''I got to know what being really frightened is. I have always said it
had a lot to do with my entrepreneurial life after that,'' he says. ''I
think if you go to the very edge of terror and learn that you can deal
with it -- regardless of how you learn that lesson -- it strengthens you
in all ways. That's very helpful to an entrepreneur, of course, because
he lives the life of stark, raving terror. He is always taking risks.''
After being rescued by some of General Patton's advancing tanks, he
was transferred to an English base. It was in Britain that he made his
first fortune -- and met his first wife, Daphne Mercer, whose family was
friendly with the Churchills. The couple were to divorce after 35 years
of marriage.
At the time they met, back in the fifties, America had 32 bases in
Britain, with their own commissariats and PXs -- each the equivalent of
a supermarket and a department store.
No-one was selling directly to them, or directly representing American
and British companies supplying goods to the bases. Wilson Harrell
stepped in to fill the gap. He expanded his operation first through
Europe, then later created a world-wide organisation selling to US bases
around the globe.
His involvement in the entrepreneurial movement began in 1985 when the
influential business magazine Inc. wrote a feature on him, entitling it
Portrait of a Compulsive Entrepreneur.
There was such an outpouring of want from entrepreneurs that Inc.
started him as a regular columnist. Within two years, liking his
entrepreneurial ideas, the magazine asked Harrell to become its
publisher.
These days, preaching the virtues of entrepreneurial methods, he is an
increasingly influential figure in corporate circles.
He has some nice things, too, to say about Scotland, a country he has
visited often. ''I think Scotland is probably on the leading edge
world-wide through Scottish Enterprise and Russell Griggs in
understanding the entrepreneurial movement,'' he says.
It is his belief that Scotland, if it maintains its momentum, has an
opportunity in Europe to become the hotbed of entrepreneurship. That
lies in the future. Today, in the Royal Concert Hall, the #50-a-head
delegates will most certainly be getting their money's worth from Mr
Harrell.

William Russell examines the need for a modern honour that would be
treasured by tea lady and queen alike
ONCE again the honours have been awarded. There are more new lords,
new knights, new dames, not to mention people galore linked with an
empire on which the sun has set. But how can anybody agree, with a
straight face, to be a Commander of, let alone a Member of, something
that is not there? The answer is that in Britain you can be like the
emperor who had no clothes.
Other countries have honours -- to be able to dispense patronage is a
very useful thing which no ruler in his right mind would give up. John
Major, early on in his premiership, announced that he intended to reform
the system. He spoke out loud and clear, but one is hard put to see how
the lists which have appeared each New Year, and on the occasion of the
Queen's birthday in June, under his leadership are significantly
different from those that have been appearing since time immemorial
under his predecessors.
The Establishment likes honours. The Tory party whips like honours.
Corporate headed notepaper likes honours. There may have been the odd
tea lady, nominated by the staff of the office where she dispenses her
brew, who would not otherwise have been heard of, but for the rest -- it
is the same old mixture.
The problem is what to put in their place. The Russians in the
communist days had Hero of the Soviet Union, which had a ring to it.
Somehow Hero of the Commonwealth of Independent States does not sound
the same. Some honours are all right. The Order of Merit, for one. The
Order of Lenin, however, is one that nobody would boast about now, while
to be given the Golden Water Buffalo, third class, would be quite
shame-making.
The Japanese, however, have come up with the perfect answer. If they
want to bestow a signal honour on someone recognising a lifetime of
achievement they designate them ''a national treasure''. That has a ring
to it! Sir Cliff Richard, on the other hand, is designed to make people
snigger behind their hands. But Cliff, National Treasure, who could
disagree?
It is just about possible to get away with making a singer a dame,
especially when she is Vera Lynn. But the theatrical knighthoods have
run out of steam. Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi are able actors, but
they do not have the aura of greatness about them like Irving,
Richardson, Olivier or Gielgud had, and in the case of the last named
still has. But call Sir Ian a National Treasure and somehow it just does
not work. Ian McKellen, National Treasure -- Stephen Fry, National
Disgrace.
One omission, in spite of an appeal from the Queen Mother, from
Saturday's list was the 90-year-old-plus actress Evelyn Laye, who was,
in her prime, a great star of the musical theatre and the cinema. Why
she did not pass the vetting procedure is anybody's guess, especially as
those who wrote to No 10 backing the Queen Mother's suggestion that her
old friend be allowed to die happy -- to be dubbed a Dame is Miss Laye's
fondest wish -- included, it is said, Sir John Mills and Sir Derek
Jacobi, two previous recipients of honours for thesping. It just goes to
show you cannot push the honours vetting committee around, even if you
are a royal.
Miss Laye might take comfort from the fact that she is already a
national treasure and has been for as long as anyone can remember. But
when you look at the lists you do wonder why somebody who does
astonishing good works for no recompense should be worth a mere MBE
while some old Tory back bencher who has spent a lifetime wearing out
his shoe leather trotting through the lobbies and doing as he is told,
but little else (give or take the odd outside interest) gets a
knighthood?
The nice thing about instituting one honour, like National Treasure,
is that it could be bestowed on people who are already titled. There is
no point in making the Queen Mother a dame, a duchess or an MBE. And
even if she is a national treasure already, to be able to go through the
rest of her life as Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, National
Treasure, would surely be a splendid thing. The only problem I can see
is that because we are British, and the class system being what it is,
we would end up inevitably with National Treasure Class 1, Class 2 and
so on, because there are those who would object to being made the same
National Treasure as Mrs Mopp, tea lady, MBE.
There will never be a Sir Dennis Skinner, MP, but even he would surely
not balk at being dubbed National Treasure. It would only be recognising
the reality.

STEPHEN McGINTY reports that keeping it in the family is not always
the best advice when it comes down to commercial success
IN Court 22 of the Old Bailey at the moment are two readers Michael J
O'Malley Jun has yet to reach. The author of The Family Business: How to
work with your family and still enjoy Sunday dinner would have plenty to
discuss with Kevin and Ian Maxwell, sons of Capt'n Bob. The American
adviser on family business dynamics could read aloud his pithy patter on
the parent-and-child corporation.
In the rules governing whether or not to employ your children, he
writes a strong rule of thumb: ''If at work you cannot tell your child:
* I made a mistake --
* I'm sorry --
* I was wrong --
* I love you --
then DO NOT hire him.''
It is hard to imagine Robert Maxwell warmly embracing his sons,
whispering affections into their ears before apologising unreservedly
for his bullying business behaviour. Still both boys are now in court,
three years and six months after their father went overboard both
physically and financially, for the misuse of pension funds.
If business is war, than a family business is the front line and the
bodies can soon stack up. Michael O'Malley was a casualty of his own
wrong assumptions and the price was steep. After 10 years working in
partnership with his father in their financial planning firm, he quit.
While previously there was 13 family members there is now only one --
dad.
''I made the mistake any child makes when he goes into work with
family. I made a lot of assumptions that weren't discussed. As time
progressed I found out that those assumptions were incorrect and that
was a point of conflict.
''I thought we were equal partners that we building this business
together and that some day the business would be mine. But when I went
to cash this in I found that these weren't the assumptions he was
making.
''His assumptions were: the business was his, he was giving me the
opportunity that someone my age couldn't get anywhere else, that there
was only room for one person at the top which was him.''
But Mr O'Malley's academic training was in psychology and family
systems theory -- sounds good -- which allowed him to re-invent himself
using his own misfortune to forewarn and arm others. This week he was
over from Chicago to attend seminars organised by The Centre For Family
Enterprise.
Launched last week through Scottish Enterprise and Glasgow Caledonian
University, the centre provides the opportunity for family businesses to
receive tailored advice.
At a series of full-day seminars and executive breakfasts those who
pay the #1500 membership can learn from top academics on law,
consulting, psychology and human resources.
The centre, which will also operate to lobby the Government on family
firm issues and regular executive forums, will allow members to trade
ideas. Barbara Dunn, the centre's director said: ''The role of the
centre is to look at the business as a system -- we're not looking at
helping a particular individual, we are interested in the business.''
The myths of family business run as little quotes through-out the
book. They include: ''You want it in writing -- you must not love me!'';
''I don't care what the others in the family think''; ''I don't care
what happens in the business I just want the kids to be happy.''
These words would have stuck in Maxwell's mouth. But while the trial
of his sons continues, Michael O'Malley continues to becoming involved
in other families' affairs.
''In families I hear this language -- they don't say the word -- but
there is this idea of betrayal. Betrayal comes up because everything was
assumed and nothing was discussed.
''I find it almost impossible for people to have the conversations
that they need to have without someone else there to create a forum
where things can be discussed objectively, and keep all the reactiveness
to a minimum. Because if you could do it -- you would do it, but you
can't, so you don't.''
Today Mr O'Malley can still enjoy Sunday dinner with his father. But
does the hurt remain?
Speaking carefully, he replies: ''I like to use the phrase; emotional
residue.''

Finding the perfect partner in singles bars or among your own social
scene can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Gavin Bell reports
that personal advertisement columns have become the winning ticket for
many lonely hearts playing the lottery of love
Singles clubs are all right if you just want a one-night stand
CROCODILE Dundee is still out there, searching for a lady alligator.
The Lancashire hot pot is still on offer, and a bright-eyed lass in
Rutherglen is still waiting to be rescued by a valiant knight. But at
least one lucky Glasgow girl has found a Local Hero to sweep her through
1995, and possibly beyond.
The personal columns of newspapers and magazines, once regarded as a
dubious last resort for social misfits, have become a respectable market
place for meeting prospective partners. The odds against picking a
winner in the lottery of lonely hearts may be daunting, but more people
than ever are betting on it to find friends and lovers.
They come in all shapes and sizes, from all walks of life, with at
least one thing in common -- a desire for companionship. A familiar
refrain is that once the whirl of teenage romance and early marriages is
over, the unattached become trapped in dwindling social circles with
limited means of escape.
Lily, a 27-year-old public relations consultant, had never considered
advertising for a mate until a friend announced she was engaged to a man
she had met through a magazine listing.
''I had an active social life, and didn't really feel the need for
someone special. But I had just had a fairly disastrous fling, and I was
beginning to feel that most single men were either gay or didn't have
two brain cells to rub together. Then my friend met a nice guy through
an advertisement, and I thought what the hell, it's worth a try.''
Lily chose a weekly magazine in the hope of attracting a professional
man interested in the arts. What she got was a letter from a hopeful
suitor in Elgin who boasted of having a swimmer's physique, and another
from a man whose big interest in life was science-fiction films. ''I
could be wrong, of course, but I don't think either was my type,'' she
says.
Then she received a light-hearted letter from Michael, a mature
student, and they arranged to meet. ''We went for coffee one Sunday
lunchtime because I thought it was safest in daylight hours. He sounded
nice, but he could have been a mad axe-murderer.''
In fact, he was a pleasant, easy-going fellow with a sense of humour.
They laughed a lot, time flew, and they have been partners for four
months. ''This is the man who got up at a quarter to two in the morning
to refill my hot water bottle when I had a sore tummy,'' Lily recalls.
''Our relationship is the kind I always thought people should have. It's
good fun, not a hassle, very easy.''
Lily professes herself surprised and delighted by the outcome. ''I
used to think I would have to be desperate to put an ad in a magazine,
but looked at logically it's a realistic way of meeting people with
similar backgrounds and interests. You know the other person is looking
for the same thing, and it cuts out a lot of the pussy-footing around.
Handled properly, it's a mature step towards a relationship. I like the
greater degree of honesty. You put your cards on the table, not up your
sleeve.''
Mary, a 24-year-old administration officer with a security company, is
disarmingly candid about her life. ''I've often thought it would be nice
if somebody took me away from all this. I'm fed up getting up every
morning, going to work, and coming home to four walls and a cat, the
same thing day in, day out. I wish somebody would come galloping down
here on a big white horse, grab me and take me away.''
No knights in shining armour responded to her advertisement for a
good-looking man for fun and romance. Instead she found herself with a
rock singer in skin-tight leather trousers. ''He was a nightmare, full
of himself, he thought he was the bees knees. One date was enough.''
A shop assistant who answered her next appeal seemed more promising,
but he lacked a sense of adventure. ''I suppose I'm a bit hard to
handle,'' Mary admits. ''I lose interest awful quick. Maybe I'm too much
of a party animal. But at the end of the day all I'm looking for is a
nice wee house and a nice wee man that does the dishes sometimes.''
Pending the appearance of a dashing knight prepared to do household
chores, she is dating the boy next door -- a plaster and decorator she
met in a local pub through a mutual friend. ''He's good fun to be with,
but I'm just taking it one day at a time. If it doesn't work out I might
try another ad.''
Joyce Craig, a secretary at Glasgow University, was the only ''lonely
heart'' contacted by The Herald who agreed to be identified (all the
other names in this article are assumed). Joyce is the Lancashire hot
pot who advertised herself as a tasty dish of the day for a mid-fifties
gentleman -- but all she got was Clootie dumplings, she says.
Joyce is a bright, lively divorcee who looks and behaves younger than
her 60 years. She enjoys ballroom dancing, swimming, and dining out, but
finds herself at home watching television more often than not. ''The
whole world changes when you get divorced,'' she says. ''A lot of men
see you as easy meat, and married women who were your friends regard you
as a threat. And where can you go on your own? Singles clubs are all
right if you just want a one-night stand, but it's hard to find a bit of
quality.''
One of her advertisements produced quality in a consultant surgeon,
who wined and dined her in style: ''He was lovely and very keen, a real
top dog, but somehow I couldn't respond to him. We went out together a
few times then parted amicably.''
Joyce says she has been lucky up to a point. She has met a number of
gentlemen who have treated her very nicely, and she has had no bad
experiences, but the man of her dreams is proving elusive. Perhaps Cilla
Black might help -- she has been interviewed as a prospective candidate
for Blind Date.
''Meantime I'll keep trying the advertisements, before I get too old.
It's a shame, I've got a lot to offer and I'm sure I could make someone
happy somewhere. There are so many pages of ads, aren't there? There
must be a lot of lonely people out there.''
Whether men such as ''Crocodile Dundee'' have been more fortunate in
finding mates is unknown, as none replied to requests for interviews.
However Vivian, a 35-year-old media researcher from Carnoustie, is no
longer lonely, having met her match through a magazine advertisement.
''I'd just finished a long relationship, and I suppose I wanted a bit of
an ego-boost and to meet some new men. It just seemed like a fun idea at
the time.''
Half a dozen applicants for the post of ''a good man for a good
woman'' were duly interviewed over a series of lunches, but it was
Robert, an academic in his thirties, who fitted the bill. ''As soon as
we met, things kind of fell into place. My first thought was thank God,
here's my kind of person. He's interesting and amusing, and easy to get
along with. On our second date, over dinner, I suddenly realised this is
the man I was going to marry.''
It took Robert a year to the day of their first meeting to propose,
and the wedding is fixed for next month. Vivian is thus a staunch
advocate of personal advertisements. ''I think it's quite a civilised
way of doing things. It's a useful way of meeting people you wouldn't
otherwise. People move in quite small social circles, and I'd probably
never have met Robert any other way.''
On the premise that all such stories deserve a happy ending, Vivian is
pleased to report that her wedding guests will include at least three
couples who met through ''lonely hearts'' columns.

Deborah Cameron is fascinated with the way language works. Jennifer
Cunningham spent time with the linguist to learn about verbal hygiene
DEBORAH Cameron is a linguist. Not one whose skill is in hopping from
one language to another, but one who brings a scientific analysis to the
way language works. The passions aroused by the way the English language
is used are therefore outside her professional concern, but the social
phenomenon of people who form societies to abolish the verb ''to be''
fascinates her in the way train spotters fascinate comedy writers.
''I wanted to know what makes them feel so strongly about a particular
aspect of language that they form a club, which seems to me like
complete madness. The really hot one at the moment is Klingon, which is
the language of the aliens on Star Trek. Last year they had a
falling-out about how they would translate the Bible and split into two
factions.''
They may be a hoot to a learned and sophisticated language-user like
Cameron, but she soon discovered they are an entrenched part of popular
culture. ''There is this huge subterranean culture of people who really
care very deeply about language and are really interested in various
aspects of it, so I just thought I would do some investigation.
''I expected it to be really sociological, but I became more
interested in the things of hot political debate, like the national
curriculum in England and the political correctness issue and all this
business of new forms of training in the workplace to try to doctor the
way we speak.''
That investigation has turned into a book. The title, Verbal Hygiene,
craftily sums up her own attitude to the subject matter. As senior
lecturer in literary linguistics at Strathclyde University she has
listened to fellow academics objecting to the phrase verbal report when
what is meant is oral report.
''Everyone knows what oral hygiene is -- brushing and flossing your
teeth -- so this is brushing and flossing your language. It is also
meant to conjure up things like mental hygiene which at the beginning of
the century was how to make the world better by improving people's minds
and I think verbal hygiene has some elements of that; it is linguistic
eugenics in some form.''
She concedes it may be a little abstruse for the lay readers she
originally had in mind. ''It has misfired a bit because no-one gets the
joke without it being explained.''
Unthinking academics are one of her targets and her aim is merciless.
''Linguistic bigotry is among the last publicly expressible prejudices
left to members of the Western intelligentsia. Intellectuals who would
find it unthinkable to sneer at a beggar or someone in a wheelchair will
sneer without compunction at linguistic solecisms. In academic circles,
for example, where it is normally a sign of intellectual competence to
broach the question 'why?' questioning the minutiae of linguistic
conventions is a sign of incomplete or faulty socialisation.
''Tell people that they must dress in a certain way to be admitted to
a public building and some at least will demand to know why; they may
even reject the explanation as absurd and campaign for a change in the
rules. Tell them, on the other hand, that the comma goes outside the
quotation marks rather than inside and they will meekly obey, though the
rule is patently as arbitrary as any dress code.''
''Like other superficially innocuous 'customs,' 'conventions' and
'traditions,' dress codes included, rules of language use often
contribute to a circle of exclusion and intimidation, as those who have
mastered a particular practice use it in turn to intimidate others.''
(Puntilious readers will note here that The Herald adopts the North
American practice of inserting the comma before the quotation mark. I've
never been able to establish why.)
The most obvious verbal hygiene is the ''politically correct''
language now derided on all sides. Deborah Cameron argues that it has
the merit of bringing contests that are often submerged to the surface
of public discourse.
''It is no more of a threat to freedom of expression than any other
set of linguistic norms; nor does it threaten our ability to
communicate. It threatens only our freedom to imagine that our
linguistic choices are inconsequential, or to suppose that any one group
of people, in their guise of defending 'the language' has an inalienable
right to prescribe the linguistic norms''.
As a Glaswegian who grew up in the north of England and returned in
1991 to be part of the Programme in Literary Linguistics at Strathclyde,
she says oppression of minority languages is one of the most common
forms of verbal hygiene. Of the sort which caused a furore over the
award of the Booker Prize to James Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late,
she says: ''It was basically saying that a book partly-written in
Glasgow vernacular should not win a prestige literary prize. The person
responsible does not seem to have realised that the distance from London
to Glasgow is the same in both directions.
''If someone sitting in Garnethill were to write in to the BBC and say
'I do not understand these newscasters on the nine o'clock news',
everyone would say: 'How ridiculous' and yet when people write asking
'Why do you put on Rab C. Nesbit -- we cannot understand it,' that seems
perfectly reasonable.
''I think one policy we should have in education is the aim to make
the citizens of this country familiar with the way all their fellow
citizens speak. There is no point in arguing against a standard dialect
for writing and everyone should be able to write standard English, but
the idea of a country in which people living 400 miles distant from each
other claim not to be able to understand one another is a disaster.
''The approach in Scotland is not so bad because of its heritage of
linguistic diversity and also because of linguistic colonialism, it has
taken an attitude where children should be able to communicate in
standard English but also have an acquaintance with their vernacular
heritage. But the national curriculum policy they have applied in
England is just a disaster to the extent of having a list of cockneyisms
which children are told to avoid.''
Then she's off, citing some of the disturbing discoveries she made in
the course of her research. Apparently Scotrail has been telling staff
making public announcements that they should sound Scottish, but like
Malcolm Rifkind rather than Jimmy Knapp, while East Anglian railway
announcers will be given a pocket guide telling them when they can and
can't use words like mate or pet. Announcers elsewhere have been told
that they should put American-style friendliness into their voices.
''It is part of the whole process of fiddling about with the image of
things. It used to be that self-help books were for the
socially-insecure, people who wanted to better themselves, but now every
company has instructions about how you should greet people on the phone,
what you can and can't say.''
While admitting she would like to think her book would contribute to
some sort of backlash, she does not think people are really in a
position to have much of a backlash. She urges us all to be more
conscious of the words we use and why. ''We do have choices about the
language we use and have far more freedom than we normally use and so we
should think about it.''

PALESTINIAN and Israeli futures should be cemented together in an
organisation modelled on the European Union, a senior Israeli diplomat
suggested yesterday.
Speaking in Glasgow, Mr Arthur Koll, minister counsellor at the
Israeli Embassy, said he would like to see the same sort of
reconstructionist attitude as emerged in Europe after the Second World
War.
''That is what developed into the European Union. The purpose was to
create a mechanism which would put an end to war,'' he said. ''It
created such bonds of common interest that wars will not be thought
about. That is what we would like to see in the Middle East.''
Mr Koll was addressing a special seminar on the problems of the Middle
East peace process in the City Chambers. Other speakers included
Professor Yasir Suleiman, of Edinburgh University, and terrorism expert,
Dr Bruce Hoffman, of St Andrews University.
Mr Koll also outlined areas of common interest: ''It would be to find
solutions to water problems, regionally. To find solutions to economic
problems, regionally. To create tourist packages, regionally.''

LORD Ennals of Norwich -- who was Social Services Minister David
Ennals in the last Labour Government -- has died. He was 72.
He was found dead in bed at his north London home on Saturday. He had
been ill for some time.
Lord Ennals was made Social Security Minister in 1976 in the Callaghan
administration, which was voted out after the notorious Winter of
Discontent in 1978. His ministry was one of those hardest hit by union
action, which saw hospitals picketed and the dead left unburied.
Born David Hedley Ennals in Walsall on August 19, 1922, he was
educated at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, and then in the US.
He served in the Army from 1941 to 1946, and in 1944 was wounded in
Normandy and held as a prisoner of war.
He became Overseas Secretary to the Labour Party after the war, and
was elected as Labour MP for Dover in 1964.
During the UDI crisis in Rhodesia, he was one of three Labour MPs
manhandled by a white mob while on a fact-finding mission to Salisbury
-- now Harare.
In 1968, Lord Ennals became Minister of State at the Department of
Health and Social Security, a post which he held until the change of
government in 1970 -- when he lost his seat.
However, he was re-elected as MP for Norwich South in February 1974,
serving as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
When he again lost his seat at the 1983 General Election, he was
created a life peer and later became the chairman of the United Nations
Association and the National Association for Mental Health.
Lord Ennals suffered a tragedy in 1993 when Rifleman Phuoc Ky Ennals,
21, a Vietnamese orphan whom he had informally adopted ,died on a firing
range weeks after complaining of racist abuse.
In 1992, Lord Ennals claimed on TV that he had been addicted to the
tranquilliser Valium for 17 years, an addiction which began when Labour
lost power in 1970.
His first marriage to Eleanor Caddick in 1950 was dissolved in 1977.
He subsequently married Katherine Tranoy. He had three sons and one
daughter from his first marriage.

<HEADLINE>No cash for barman in unfair sacking</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977813658</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A ROYAL British Legion head barman has won a claim for unfair
dismissal against his former employer, but no cash compensation.
An industrial tribunal heard that the barman was unable to account for
53 bottles of spirits and eight kegs of beer. Because he was found to be
to blame for his dismissal the tribunal ordered that no compensation
should be paid.
Mr Gordon McKenzie, of Wallace Street, Carnoustie, had worked in his
local Legion club since 1987.
Shortly before the end of its financial year last October, the club
had a stock check carried out which revealed that gross profit was down
by almost 6%.
Stocktaker Mr Bruce Goudie suggested a further investigation of till
rolls to the club's secretary and treasurer, Mr Murray Allan. This
revealed that 67[1/2] litres of vodka; three litres of gin; and nine
litres of OVD, worth #2195, were missing along with eight kegs of beer
valued at #900.
Mr Goudie concluded that the stock had been stolen and that an
experienced barman carrying out his duties in a proper manner should
have been aware of the stock losses.
Mr McKenzie was given two days to come up with an explanation for the
discrepancy but when he failed to do so he was suspended on full pay.
The tribunal noted that the club was careful to avoid any suggestion
that Mr McKenzie had been involved in the misappropriation of the stock.
In stating that the head barman was unfairly dismissed the tribunal
said he had never been advised that dismissal was a potential outcome,
was not given the stocktaking reports, and was not allowed an appeal as
no appeals mechanism existed.
But the tribunal stated: ''However, we are of the view that the
applicant was wholly responsible for what befell him. In particular, we
are of the view that the applicant was an experienced barman who totally
failed properly to discharge his obligations towards the club by keeping
a careful control of the stock under his charge.
''The result of his failure was a substantial loss to the club and in
our opinion, therefore, it is inappropriate that the applicant gains
anything from his unfair dimissal application.''

THE twelve new West of Scotland local authorities are being urged to
form a partnership to fund race relations and equal opportunity
services.
The chairman of Strathclyde Community Relations Council, Mr Bashir
Maan, is anxious to ensure that the task of combating racial
discrimination and harassment is carried on after the reorganisation of
local government next April.
The Community Relations Council, which costs #150,000 a year to run,
is currently funded by Strathclyde Regional Council, Glasgow District
Council and the Commission for Racial Equality.
Mr Maan's concern is that the service might prove to be expensive for
some of the new councils, were they to provide it on their own.
Mr Maan, a member of the new Glasgow City Council, said: ''It would
make political as well as economic sense if all the new local
authorities replacing Strathclyde were to enter into a partnership to
provide a joint service.''
''The services and vast experience and expertise of this Community
Relations Council could then be utilised by all councils in the West of
Scotland.''
Mr Maan has invited the 12 chief executives to a race summit meeting
to see how a partnership providing race-related services can be put
together.

<RECORDNO>977813660</RECORDNO>

AN American explosives expert reduced a 200ft-high Dundee multi-storey
block to a massive pile of debris yesterday.
All that remained of the flats in the city's Ardler area was a
35,000-tonne mound of concrete and steel after the spectacular
demolition, carried out by the company which demolished the government
building in Oklahoma City badly damaged in a bombing attack in April.
The contractors claimed the success of yesterday's operation would
restore public confidence in explosive demolitions following the death
of a 61-year-old woman in Glasgow hit by flying debris during a Gorbals
tower block demolition nearly two years ago.
Controlled Demolition International (CDI), of Maryland, used nearly
200 kilogrammes of explosives in 1320 separate charges yesterday to
destroy the 16-storey Dundee building.
A tight exclusion zone was thrown up around Scotscraig, Troon, and
Wentworth Courts. Roads were closed off and nearby residents evacuated
from their homes.
A crowd of nearly 2000 watched as, following a series of wxplosions,
the middle section of the building collapsed first followed by its two
outside sections.
An enormous cloud of dust billowed up and the spectators ran for cover
as it covered the area for two minutes.
When the air cleared, all that was left of the block was a huge pile
of rubble.
Dundee District Council decided to demolish the block after it became
surplus to requirements. Three other blocks in the area are also to be
taken down with explosives.
After the dust settled, Mr Mark Loizeaux, president of CDI, expressed
his satisfaction at the outcome. He said: ''I'd like to come back and do
another one.''
The company reduced the number of charges used to demolish the
building by a third as work progressed on preparing the site.
Mr Loizeaux added: ''We did not blow this building down. This building
was brought down by gravity. Anyone who tries to blow a building up,
blow it down, or blow it sideways doesn't understand the process and is
asking for trouble.
''The building came down as planned. It moved cleanly and it moved
smoothly indicating that all the charges detonated according to plan.''
Mr David Sinclair, of lead contractors WJ &amp; D Contracting, of Glasgow,
said that the succesful demolition would restore public confidence after
the death of Ms Helen Tinney at the Queen Elizabeth Square block in
Glasgow in 1993.
He said: ''Unfortunately, the Queen Elizabeth Square job was one of
the worst things that happened to the industry. Now I'm hoping that some
confidence will be regained.''
Representatives from Glasgow District Council travelled to Dundee to
witness the demolition.
Around 200 tonnes of steel reinforcing bars from the structure will be
recycled and sold.

<HEADLINE>Party will try to redirect fire at the Government    Labour braced for flak over Monklands</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
LABOUR is bracing itself for today's Monklands inquiry report but
already it is clear that, whatever criticisms are levelled against local
councillors, the party will turn its fire on the Government for failing
to take action.
It is understood that Labour's response to the independent report by
Professor Robert Black into claims of nepotism and religious bias will
be to tackle any direct criticisms decisively through internal party
discipline.
However, they will also make the point that, had the Government taken
action when requested by the then Monklands East MP, the late Labour
leader Mr John Smith, a full inquiry could have reached more
far-reaching conclusions and the affair would not have ''festered on''.
It is likely that a firm commitment will be made that, in the event of
any future allegations of impropriety in local government, a Labour
Scottish Secretary would order such an inquiry. This would carry the
benefit of full legal privilege whereas, if Professor Black links any
named individuals to allegations of wrong-doing, they could have legal
redress against him.
At the weekend, Labour held a conference of its future council leaders
from new unitary authorities to coach them on the standards expected in
public life. The timing of the gathering at Rhu, near Helensburgh, was
coincidental but the connection to today's Monklands announcement was
undeniable.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson told those present: ''The
party is determined that its national standing is not going to be
damaged by the behaviour of a handful of people at local level. We want
the best practice to be common practice.''
He said afterwards: ''We had a pretty frank exchange and I said we had
to learn the lessons of the activities of some councils who could
disproportionately influence the coverage the party has been getting.''
Scottish Labour Party general secretary Mr Jack McConnell said of the
weekend: ''To some extent, this is about learning the lessons of the
seventies and eighties which gave rise to issues such as Monklands.''
However, Airdrie SNP councillor Neil Douglas said it was ''absolutely
risible'' for the Labour Party to try to avoid its responsibilities for
any wrongdoings in Monklands.
He said Mr Smith had for years buried his head in the sand by avoiding
the concerns about the council's ruling Labour group brought to him by
party activists. It was only when it was unavoidable that he had called
for an inquiry, said Councillor Douglas, years after an inquiry was
demanded by the SNP.
Meanwhile, the backlash against Labour's new education proposals began
yesterday with teachers' leaders accusing the party of sacrificing
schools to ''political expediency''. Further opposition is expected from
local education authority leaders this week when Labour outlines
proposals to give all schools more independence.
The proposals aim to resolve Labour's dilemma over grant-maintained
schools, not by abolishing them -- as many party traditionalists want --
but by minimising the difference between them and local education
authority schools.
Labour left-wingers will see the proposals as the compromise they
feared since leader Mr Tony Blair decided to send his son to the London
Oratory School, one of the leaders of the opt-out movement.
A key element will be a move to increase the financial delegation to
schools from the present minimum 85% of their budgets to 90% or even
95%.
At the same time, Labour will emphasise the role of LEAs providing
support for poor-performing schools, intervening with inspection and
advisory services to raise standards.
But yesterday, Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National
Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said increasing
delegation to schools ''may be a way of getting Tony Blair off his
political hook'', but the proposals would be ''a disaster for the
majority of schools''.

Madrid, Sunday
SPAIN'S military police arrested a former senior intelligence officer
today as part of investigations into a bugging scandal that has rocked
the nation's government and secret service.
The Defence Ministry said Colonel Juan Alberto Perote, former head of
the Operative Group of the CESID military intelligence unit, was
detained at his house on the outskirts of Madrid.
Perote was taken to a military court in the capital, questioned for
several hours and held in custody.
His arrest was the first since the newspaper El Mundo published
excerpts last Monday from transcripts of telephone calls made by
prominent politicians, businessmen, judges, and even King Juan Carlos.
The CESID subsequently issued a statement saying the bugging reflected
its obligation to control possible security threats and insisted all the
original tapes had been destroyed.
The head of CESID (High Centre for Defence Intelligence) Lieutenant
General Emilio Alonso Manglano resigned on Thursday.
Manglano, Perote's chief at the unit for more than nine years, accused
the 56-year-old colonel of taking hundreds of confidential files with
him when he left the intelligence service in 1991.
Perote headed CESID's Operative Group, briefed to deal with the
ministry's most sensitive security cases, from 1983.
He has vigorously denied he leaked the so-called ''CESID tapes''.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has said there will no Cabinet
resignations until the case is fully investigated, in spite of media
speculation to the contrary, and the Socialists quickly quashed rumours
that the Defence Minister had offered to resign.--Reuter.

Beirut, Sunday
MUSLIM guerrillas killed three Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon today
in their bloodiest attack this year against occupation forces.
Seven other soldiers were injured, one seriously, when the guerrillas
ambushed an Israeli patrol with machinegun fire and rockets, according
to sources with the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA).
The attack brought the number of Israeli dead in south Lebanon this
year to nine -- eight killed in guerrilla operations and one a victim of
friendly fire during an attack. Thirty Israeli soldiers have been
wounded.
The pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) claimed responsibility for
the latest attack.
Last year, 21 Israeli soldiers were killed and scores wounded in the
nine-mile south Lebanon zone which it holds to prevent guerrilla attacks
on northern Israel.
Some 1000 Israeli soldiers backed by 3000 SLA men man the zone, the
last ''hot'' front line in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Before today the bloodiest day for Israeli forces in the zone this
year was in April when a Hizbollah suicide bomber blew up a car in an
Israeli military convoy, wounding nine soldiers.--Reuter.

Paris
THE National Front issued a direct challenge to the Republican ideal
of equality over the weekend by saying it would defy the law and
discriminate against non-white residents in any towns it won in
yesterday's municipal elections.
The National Front won Orange and Marignane in the south and the
Mediterranean port of Toulon after receiving record-breaking support in
first round voting last Sunday.
Former Front member Jacques Peyrat seized the Riviera capital of Nice,
France's sixth largest city, from President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist
RPR party. Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen hailed it as a victory for his
ideas, which include advocating the repatriation of three million
immigrants.
However two of the NF's best hopes were defeated -- in Vitrolles, near
Marseille, and in Dreux, west of Paris.
The NF, which in its 22-year career had never gained control of a city
council, said it would go to law if necessary to carry out its
discriminatory programme in matters of housing, schooling, and social
benefits.
A senior member of the extreme right-wing party, Franck Timmermans,
said the NF would ''arm-wrestle the State'' to discourage foreigners
from settling in any town it controlled, or encourage them to leave.
''Each time there will be a risk of seeing a community, Asian, North
African, or nomad, disturb the French balance of a district, we will use
our right,'' he said.
In another polling upset, Mr Chirac's Gaullist coalition lost its
monopoly on power in Paris, where he was mayor for 18 years until last
month. The opposition Socialists won six out of 20 districts.

Egion, Sunday
RESCUE workers gave up hope today of finding more survivors from the
rubble of an apartment block flattened by an earthquake that killed at
least 23 people, including 10 French tourists.
''There are no signs of life. We will now focus on pulling out the
dead from under the rubble,'' said Costas Ioanides, head of the rescue
effort.
The confirmed death toll rose to 23 after workers found the body of an
18-year-old mute woman confined to a wheelchair. Rescuers had hoped she
would be alive yesterday after picking up life-signs from the area where
she was thought to be buried.
Earlier today workers uncovered the body of a 61-year-old doctor in
the ruins of the building which was destroyed by a tremor measuring 6.1
on the Richter scale in this western coastal town on Thursday.
Three or four more bodies are believed still buried in the mass of
shattered concrete.
There was a flurry of activity early today when a Swiss rescue team
thought it detected signs of life in the rubble, but the Swiss then said
they were abandoning the hunt.
''We dug all the way down and we could not find anything,'' said Swiss
rescue team spokesman Beat Kraettli. ''If there were the slightest
possibility of recovering a survivor we would not have given up the
search.''
The Swiss team said it planned to go home tomorrow.
The bodies of a father and his nine-year-old girl, locked in an
embrace, were recovered yesterday.
''We found the little girl in her father's arms,'' said a Greek rescue
worker. ''He apparently picked her up and tried to rush out the door but
a concrete block fell on them and they died instantly.''
Rescue efforts were spurred on Friday, when a Greek rescue team
reached an eight-year-old boy buried alive for 44 hours and ferried him
to safety through a long, narrow tunnel.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has promised temporary housing and
interest-free loans to those who lost their homes, as well as a new
development plan for the area.--Reuter.

RUSSIA'S military commander in Chechnya last night ordered his troops
to halt all military actions as part of a deal to save hundreds of
hostages in the southern town of Budennovsk.
Itar-Tass news agency said General Anatoly Kulikov, the head of
federal forces in Chechnya, had given the order to stop all military
operations in Chechnya.
The move was agreed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chechen
rebel leader Shamil Basayev earlier as part of a deal under which new
peace talks would begin today in the regional capital Grozny.
Basayev told the Russian premier he was preparing to leave the town's
hospital -- where his men were holding hundreds of hostages -- early
today.
Local officials said he had asked for six buses to take his gunmen,
some hostages and a group of parliamentary deputies to the southern
Chechen town of Vedeno. The rebels also wanted a refrigerator truck to
transport their dead.
Chernomyrdin and Basayev had agreed all the captives would be released
before the rebels were given transport, but it seemed unlikely the
Chechen commander would want to leave without at least a few hostages to
shield his men.
The agreement, and the release of some hostages, brought the first
real signs of a breakthrough in the five-day crisis.
Chernomyrdin later urged Basayev to free more hostages but the Chechen
commander declined, accusing the Government of bad faith because
soldiers were shooting at the hospital.
''I made additional concessions because you became involved. We freed
159 people (on Sunday) -- that's enough for today,'' NTV independent
television quoted him as saying. ''We will not let anyone go (tonight).
We regret we let (the others) go.''
Although Chernomydrin offered an end to combat activity, he made no
mention of a pull-out by Russian forces from Chechnya.
Thousands have died in the north Caucasus conflict and Grozny is
severely damaged.
Chernomyrdin and Basayev talked several times during the day and also
agreed the negotiators in Grozny would discuss disengaging Russian and
Chechen forces in the separatist region.
Tass said the latest releases brought the number of hostages freed by
the gunmen to more than 400.

Waterloo, Belgium, Sunday
THE French lost the Battle of Waterloo again today, 180 years to the
day after the original clash changed the face of Europe.
Gunsmoke hung heavy over the field of battle as 3000 soldiers in
periodic uniform restaged the bloody engagement that broke the Emperor
Napoleon Bonaparte and turned the victorious Duke of Wellington into a
household name.
On that Sunday in 1815, about 40,000 soldiers -- one in five of the
combatants -- were butchered in 12 hours of vicious fighting, along with
10,000 horses.
This time round, the event lasted just two hours and was a dazzling
and deafening tableau of colour and movement as the 3000 infantry with
muskets attacked and retreated across a quagmire. The 200 cavalry,
wielding sabres, charged and counter-attacked under leaden skies, like
the day of the battle proper.
The re-enactment, watched by thousands of spectators, was the final
act in a series of events that began three months ago.
Today's reconstruction was on part of the original battlefield three
miles south of Waterloo at the foot of the giant Lion Mound, built after
the battle to commemorate the spot where the Dutch Prince of Orange was
killed.
Enthusiasts from Britain, Belgium, Germany, Russia, France, Holland,
Italy, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and the United States took part.
Wellington had some 67,000 British, German, Dutch, and Belgian troops
under his command -- of whom about 24,000 were British -- facing
Napoleon with about 71,000 seasoned soldiers.
The battle ushered in decades of peace, ending the political upheavals
and almost constant wars which had engulfed Europe after the French
Revolution of 1789.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Sunday
A SHELL killed seven civilians in a mainly-Muslim suburb of Sarajevo
today as Bosnia's president said his forces would end their three-day
old offensive only when Bosnian Serb eased their siege of the city.
The Serbs freed the last 26 UN hostages they seized in retaliation for
Nato air raids, in exchange for the UN freeing four Serb prisoners.
Peacekeepers withdrew from guarding weapons depots on Serb-held
territory, leaving virtually no United Nations personnel vulnerable to
capture by the Serbs.
The shell hurtled through the roof of a school in the Dobrinja suburb
and exploded among people queuing for water. The Bosnian Ministry of
Health said 12 people were wounded.
Groups of people gathering to collect water at communal taps have
become easy targets since the Serbs cut off the Bosnian capital's
supply.
Witnesses said bodies and water cans littered the bloodied floor of
the school, which local people used because they thought it would hide
them from the gunners.
Sarajevans had ventured out to replenish stocks during a lull in
fighting after 20 people were killed on Friday as the Serbs fought
attacks on their siege lines by government troops.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic offered to halt the government
offensive around Sarajevo launched last Thursday, but only if Bosnian
Serbs agreed to ease their strangulation of the city.
Bosnian politicians have defended the offensive against charges by
Western politicians that it will escalate the war, saying the UN and the
international community had done little to halt the Serbs tightening
their squeeze of the capital.
They point to increased shelling, the collapse of a heavy weapons
exclusion zone, a cut-off of water, gas, and electricity, and a Serb
blockade of aid supplies.
Izetbegovic said his troops would stand easy if Serbs reinstated the
exclusion zone by pulling back heavy weapons outside a 12[1/2]-mile
limit, allowed Sarajevo airport to reopen, and permitted land convoys to
bring in aid.
Analysts said there was little hope that the Bosnian Serbs would
comply and suggested that Izetbegovic's comments were an attempt to
redirect international pressure away from the government and back on to
the separatist Serbs.
There was little fighting around the capital today but the UN said the
government attacked Serb forces near Tuzla in the north-east, where 700
shells fell within 40 minutes.
Peacekeepers believed the attack was partly to keep Serb troops and
equipment from being diverted to around Sarajevo.
The Serbs seized almost 400 UN hostages after Nato attacked an
ammunition dump near the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale in a vain
attempt to enforce the UN heavy weapons ban around Sarajevo.
Most were freed earlier this month at the insistence of Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic and his state security chief Jovica
Stanisic who returned to Pale today to secure the freedom of the last 26
soldiers and observers.
The men, 15 military observers and 11 Canadian soldiers, went by bus
to Yugoslavia to be handed over to the UN.
The UN officially denied that it had negotiated an exchange for four
Serb soldiers captured after an assault on a Sarajevo bridge, but one UN
source called it a virtual swop hastened by fears for the hostages'
safety with fighting raging close by.
The released men included Canadian observer Patrick Rechner who had
been seen on television chained to an ammunition dump outside Pale as a
human shield to thwart further air raids.
''It's been a difficult time and we're glad it's all over,'' he told
reporters from the bus.
Television pictures of UN human shields caused world outrage although
the saga encouraged the UN to offer concessions to the Serbs including
an invitation to peace talks.
France said the hostage release paved the way for fresh talks to
secure a diplomatic solution to the Bosnian war.
''Today's liberation opens the way to a resumption of diplomatic
negotiations with all parties concerned,'' said a statement issued by
French President Jacques Chirac's office.
The Contact Group of five powers seeking an end to the Bosnian war had
insisted the Bosnian Serbs accept last year's peace plan dividing the
country before new talks could start.
It was unclear from the French statement if that condition remained.
The Bosnian Serbs have banked on Western desperation to secure a
settlement to win them fresh peace talks without their having to show a
willingness to trade land for peace.--Reuter.

* Near Ghent, in Belgium, a bus carrying German tourists crashed into
a ditch beside a motorway yesterday, injuring 32 people. The bus was
returning from a trip to London when it left the road for no apparent
reason, the police said. One theory was that the driver fell asleep at
the wheel.
Most of the injured were either in shock or were cut by glass.

AT LEAST 14 people were killed last night in an explosion at a
motorway restaurant and petrol station near the Belgian-German border.
Many other people were injured after the blast, which appeared to
originate in the kitchen of the restaurant next to a filling station run
by the Belgian company Fina in the Belgian border town of Eynaten.
The injured were taken across the border by helicopter to Aachen in
Germany.
The mayor of nearby Raeren said the death toll was likely to rise.
About 20 people were in the restaurant when the blast took place.
Relatives of victims wept and hugged one another as they surveyed the
devastation.
Two women wept behind barricades erected by police. One was the mother
of a cook feared to have been killed in the explosion. She hugged her
son's fiancee.
The blast wrecked the restaurant, twisting girders and toppling a
large sign on top of the building. Scorched tables stood outside.
The explosion followed a scare in which a bomb was said to have been
planted in a Royal Dutch/Shell filling station in the Flemish town of
Courtrai in north-west Belgium in protest at Shell's controversial
ditching of the Brent Spar production platform in the Atlantic.
This claim was later reported to be false. A bomb warning, which
proved to be a hoax, led to the closure of a nearby motorway, causing
long delays.
A spokesman for the Belgian Interior Affairs Ministry said the cause
of the blast was not yet known but first indications were that a small
natural gas container had exploded.

The cairn is to be built of 270 stones -- one for each victim --
shipped to the US from Corsehill Quarry near Lockerbie. It is planned to
inscribe the names of all 270 victims at its foot, breaking a tradition
that has seen military names only in the cemetery since it came into use

THE number of tourists coming to Edinburgh from North America has
fallen, a new survey suggests.
However, there has been an increase in the number of visitors from
continental Europe. According to the latest Edinburgh Visitor Survey,
55% of all visitors to the city came from Britain.
Of the remainder, 27% came from North America, a fall of 4% on
previous figures, while the number of visitors from continental Europe
increased from 33% to 45%.
In all 2021 visitors were interviewed in the survey designed to give
the tourism industry visitor-profile information.
It showed 47% had previously visited the city. Advice from friends and
relatives played a big part in tempting them back.
More than half those questioned said a walk up the Royal Mile was an
attraction in itself, and most of those who had walked in the city
centre at night said their impressions were that Edinburgh was
beautiful, safe, and lively.
Mr Roger Carter, chief executive of Edinburgh Tourist Board said:
''The Edinburgh Visitor Survey represents a foundation stone for tourism
policy in the city.
''Customer requirements must be foremost in our thinking, so this
survey is vitally important in telling us about the visitor, his or her
reactions to what the city has to offer, and the factors that influence
decisions to come to the city.''

<TEXT>
SINN Fein's Martin McGuinness yesterday claimed the British Government
was threatening the future of the Northern Ireland peace process by
refusing to involve his party in full talks and insisting the IRA
decommission its arsenals.
Speaking at the annual Wolfe Tone Commemoration at Bodenstown, south
of Dublin, Mr McGuinness said: ''All-party peace talks within an agreed
time-frame must be the next stage of the peace process,'' and he warned
Britain's failure to start such talks ''effectively devalues and
subverts'' this.
He added that the attempt to place obstacles to Sinn Fein involvement
also barred other parties. ''It is in effect an attack on the peace
process itself,'' he claimed.
The demand for the decommissioning of IRA weaponry was, he suggested,
''a lame excuse which prevents real peace talks''.
He accused Prime Minister John Major and Northern Ireland Secretary
Sir Patrick Mayhew of engaging in ''a dangerous and cynical game'' by
insisting on decommissioning, and being apparently intent on ''wrecking
the peace process over a symbolic gesture''.
Mr McGuinness is a member of Sinn Fein's national executive and led
its delegation in talks with British Government representatives at
Stormont. His remarks were in keeping with comments made by the Sinn
Fein president, Mr Gerry Adams, in South Africa on Saturday.
Mr Adams warned a return to violence was ''possible'' and said the
exploratory talks at Stormont were over. He is due to meet South African
President Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg today.
On IRA decommissioning, Mr McGuinness said: ''It has been suggested
that the British Government is merely asking for a symbolic gesture from
the IRA. We know that such a gesture would constitute the actual
surrender of the IRA.''
He went on: ''Almost one year since the IRA cessation, there is
incredulity and amazement that the British Government would dare to
contemplate allowing the first anniversary of that cessation to pass
without committing itself wholeheartedly to the initiation of all-party
peace talks.''
In Dublin, Mr Bertie Ahern, leader of the opposition Fianna Fail
party, said he believed it was not possible for the IRA or loyalist
paramilitaries to surrender weapons in advance of full talks.
Mr Ahern is scheduled to meet Labour leader Mr Tony Blair at
Westminster today and is expected to raise the growing concern in the
Republic over the apparent deadlock in the peace process.
Asked, on RTE's This Week radio show, if there was now a real danger
of a return to violence over decommissioning, Mr Ahern replied: ''I am
sure the IRA and the loyalist groupings did not make the decision
lightly to end violence so I don't believe they will make the decision
lightly to go back into it either.
''Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness and the loyalist groupings as well
are saying the same thing regarding this issue. I am afraid the British
Government seems to be the only grouping who are making this a
precondition and it is unhelpful.''

<HEADLINE>Engine oil leak blamed for fire on ferry</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977813691</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN oil leak was the cause of the engine room fire that forced the
evacuation of the ferry Euromagique in the North Sea, according to the
Dutch authorities.
Angry passengers criticised the condition of the Euromagique, owned by
the EuroLink company, as the ferry arrived from Sheerness in Kent at the
port of Flushing where she was reported to be ''still smoking''.
No-one was hurt in the incident after the fire started in the engine
room of the roll-on roll-off service.
The Dutch town's deputy Mayor, Mr Henk de Haas, said hot oil spewing
from a burst pipe set the engine room on fire as the incoming ferry was
about two miles from harbour.
The 87 passengers, who were evacuated as a precaution, picked up their
vehicles from the ferry yesterday morning. Fire damage was limited to
the engine room.
Fire inspectors boarded the ship after it was towed into port.
Some passengers criticised the ship's owners over the vessel's
condition and said next time they would use the Channel Tunnel.
''It's completely ruined our holiday . . . it's been ruined by
EuroLink. They've converted me to the Channel Tunnel,'' said Marsha
Kendall, still visibly shaken hours after abandoning ship.
''I had to climb down this huge ship on a ladder. It was the worst
experience of my life.''
However, she commended the crew for their handling of the emergency.
''All the staff stayed very calm, very reassuring in a dramatic
situation. Everybody was very helpful,'' she said.
Ms Kendall said she was wracked by memories of the Herald of Free
Enterprise while climbing down the hull of the vessel to a boat pitching
in the sea below.
In March 1987, 193 people were killed when the car ferry Herald of
Free Enterprise capsized and sank outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge,
about 100 miles south of Saturday's rescue site.
In September last year, 910 people died when the ferry Estonia sank
off the Finnish coast.

<HEADLINE>#200m for Dounreay clean-up    Plans to prevent leaking of contaminated waste</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>WILLIAM TINNING</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977813692</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE cost of making safe contaminated waste stored in a shaft at
Dounreay could come to more than #200m, the director of the nuclear
plant said yesterday.
Mr John Baxter, appointed last year to oversee operations at the
facility run by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), said the bill to
prevent the highly dangerous radioactive contamination leaking in future
would be met by the Government. Early estimates showed the overall cost
could be ''#100m, #200m, or possibly more''.
The waste was being constantly monitored and now appeared in a benign
state, he said. Plans were being put in place to make it safe and
options included leaving it in situ, although it was thought more likely
a system would be devised to remove it.
Mr Baxter said that Dounreay, as part of UKAEA, was the responsibility
of the Department of Trade and Industry.
''The DTI has said very clearly and openly that where there is a
safety issue then there will be no cost spared,'' he told BBC Radio
Scotland's Eye To Eye programme.
''If we have to spend the money, it will be spent. Both the DTI and
also the UKAEA have given all the support that I need to make sure that
we are sorting out the problem.''
Mr Baxter questioned the quality of previous records kept at Dounreay
and disclosed that retired employees who worked at the complex had been
called in to help fill in missing gaps in a report by a Government body
investigating childhood leukemia clusters and pollution levels around
Dounreay in 1987.
The director's comments followed serious concerns expressed last week
in a damning report by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in
the Environment (Comare) that its second report on childhood leukemia,
published in 1988, did not have all the relevant evidence.
The report concluded there was no link between the leak from the shaft
and leukemia clusters around Dounreay. However, Mr Baxter said Comare
members revisited the plant because they believed they didn't have all
available information.
Mr Baxter, asked to comment on concerns that Comare had not been told
of an explosion in 1977 at the shaft and its after affects, said: ''I
have looked back through the records . . . my understanding is that,
with a local liaison committee and various other bodies, it has been
known that there was an explosion.
''I think one of the issues was that a number of questions were asked
about specific types of discharges and those were answered. But clearly
there was some information that did not go across to Comare.
''My intention is to make sure that we have searched through all of
the records and that we have exposed all of the records to Comare and
also to Rawmac (Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee).
''To do that I have not just done a study with my own staff, but have
brought some of the people who have retired back to try to make sure we
have identified all of the areas where there might be information
records available.''
He said he had examined the records and could find no evidence that
there had been ''any intention to mislead''.
Mr Baxter conceded that the Dounreay facility faced a ''long slog'' in
rebuilding public confidence.
However, he remained confident about its future, and repeated his
belief it was a safe site and a safe place to work.
''Clearly, we should not have the radioactive contamination tracking
off our site, but, as Rawmac and Comare say, it is very unlikely that it
will affect people's health in the future.''

TWO children escaped with barely a scratch when their home exploded
around them after being struck by lightning.
Their mother could not believe they had survived the explosion which
blew the roof off the two-storey home and the plaster from the walls.
''When I heard their screams it was the best sound I have ever heard
because it meant they were still alive,'' said Mrs Linda Milne
yesterday.
Her two children, Karen, seven, and Fraser, four, had been watching a
video in the lounge of their Aberdeenshire home when the bolt of forked
lightning struck the chimney.
Granite blocks, roofing slates, and mounds of lath and plaster were
hurled into the garden of The Sheiling, Tullynessle, by the force of the
blast. The strike came during a heavy rain storm and Mrs Milne was
outside, trying to stop flood water pouring into the property.
She had sent the children into the house for safety as she worked with
her brother, Mr Kenneth Watson, to divert the water from the converted
cottage near Alford.
''There was a huge bang and I felt as if I was being forced into the
ground,'' said Mrs Milne. ''I looked up and saw my house was in total
destruction. I ran into the house not knowing what to expect. I thought
the children might have been killed.''
Mr Watson entered the house first but could not open the doors because
of the debris lying behind them. ''He forced the door to the lounge and
we could see nothing for the piles of plaster and dust. Then I heard
them screaming and they came out of it like snowmen,'' said Mrs Milne.
''Somebody must have been looking out for them. There is only a slight
scratch on them. Surprisingly, there was no fire although every
electricity socket in the house is charred.''
Her husband, Neil, a plant operator, arrived home from work minutes
after blast. ''I could not believe it was my home,'' he said.

CARERS are still not getting the support they need, two years after
the Government first implemented its policy of care in the community,
according to a report published today.
Better Tomorrows?, by Mr Norman Warner, senior research fellow at Kent
University, finds that 75% of carers believe that the introduction of
community care has either made no difference to them or that services
have deteriorated.
More than 60% of carers do not even know that they can ask for a
separate assessment -- the first step in getting their needs met --
according to the report, which was commissioned by Carers' National
Association (CNA).
The report also found that only 40% of carers considered that
assessments met their own needs, and only 60% of carers thought that the
assessment met the needs of the person cared for. In addition, the
majority of carers were finding access to residential or nursing home
care more difficult.
Mr Warner said: ''Many carers are carrying out a tremendously arduous
task. The first two years of community care have seem some limited
improvements but they do not go nearly far enough. We urgently need to
recognise that supporting carers makes sound practical and economic
sense. If just one in 10 carers felt unable to continue caring, the cost
of funding alternative care would be a massive #2000m per year.''
He added that in Scotland, the figure would be approximately #250m.
''If carers are to experience genuinely 'better tomorrows', there
needs to be dramatic improvements to the information available to carers
and to the services and support they receive. Carers themselves are
beginning to demand rights to community care services and guarantees to
ensure that they get the support they require,'' he said.
The report makes a number of proposals to help the 6.8 million carers
in Britain (780,000 in Scotland). These include:
* An information initiative for carers backed by the Government.
* Expansion of local carers' support groups.
* Improved access to local telephone helplines.
Meanwhile, to mark the start of Learning Disability Week, the Scottish
charity, Enable, has called on the public to welcome people with
learning disabilities into their lives.
Enable director's, Mr Norman Dunning, said yesterday: ''Enable
naturally supports the disability discrimination Bills currently going
through Parliament. However, it is not only the blatant forms of
discrimination -- such as denying disabled people access to jobs,
transport, and public buildings -- which concerns our members.

BY-LAWS aimed at curbing speeding power boats and water skiers on Loch
Lomond, Scotland's busiest loch, have come in for criticism from the
Scottish Sports Council.
The council has submitted a written objection to the Scottish Office
arguing that the proposed by-laws would have a detrimental impact on
water-skiing on the loch.
The Scottish Office is looking at new rules aimed at reducing boat
speeds to 6mph within 150 metres of the shore. Boats would also have to
be registered with the Loch Lomond Park Authority, carry lights after
dark, sound a horn in bad visibility, and adhere to the rules of the sea
when approaching other vessels.
However, Mr Lee Cousins, the council's senior planning officer, has
criticised the new by-laws, saying restrictions should only apply at
peak times of the year.
Mr Cousins said the council had submitted its objections at the
beginning of June in response to a Scottish Office call for comments,
suggesting the by-laws should only apply for around two months in the
summer instead of all year round.
''We do not object in principle to the by-laws and we do believe that
there are safety issues on the loch. What we are objecting to is the
scope of the by-laws, particularly the time span. The loch is only busy
for 20 to 30 days of the year.''
He pointed out that the by-laws did not need to apply for 365 days of
the year to protect wildlife, given that the breeding season was
restricted to a few months of the year.
A Scottish Office spokesman would only say that all comments would be
considered. However, he said the Scottish Office could decide to hold
another inquiry.
* The Scottish Office agreed yesterday to introduce traffic measures
on the A82 at Tarbet on the banks of Loch Lomond in response to
complaints from residents about speeding motorists.

LIVE radio coverage of all top Scottish football matches looks as
though it will be confined to BBC Radio Scotland next season and for the
three following seasons unless its main rival changes its stance.
A BBC spokesman said it had agreed a four-year deal with the Scottish
Football League which would include the whole of the League Cup final
and 40 second-half commentaries. The station is also preparing to enter
the second year of a four-year deal to cover Tennents Scottish Cup ties.
It is understood that Radio Clyde -- whose coverage includes
commentaries by Archie McPherson -- is not prepared to pay the price
demanded by the league.
However, one football expert predicted yesterday that the
Clydebank-based station might yet line-up for the kick-off at the start
of next season.
He believes the station has ''little option'' but to meet the league's
demand to secure the continuation of its Saturday Super Scoreboard
programme, which is reputed to have the best listening figures of any
programme on Clyde.
A BBC spokesman yesterday refused to confirm how much the four-year
deal would cost the corporation, saying only that it was ''marginally
more'' than last year's restricted coverage. He believed the new deal
was ''excellent value''.
It is understood the league is asking #70,000-a-year -- a figure that
equates to #1700 per second-half commentary.
No-one from Radio Clyde was available for comment last night. However,
it is understood that the station's hierarchy is concerned at the
high-cost of football coverage in Scotland compared to the rest of
Europe, coupled with the threat of extra-terrestrial competition in the
form of 23 games being switched from the traditional Saturday to
accommodate live TV coverage.

A SCOTS university is getting support from unusual quarters to mark
its 500th birthday celebrations this year.
For the Lord Lyon King of Arms -- the Queen's most senior heraldic
officer -- has granted permission for Aberdeen University to add
supporters to its coat-of-arms.
Aberdeen is the first Scottish university to earn the distinction,
which can only be awarded to institutions created by an Act of
Parliament or Royal Charter.
In heraldry, supporters are ceremonial animals, usually shown upright
on their hind legs, which stand either side of the shield to ''support''
it.
The Ross Herald of Arms, Mr Charles Burnett, will officially hand over
the new coat-of-arms to university Chancellor Sir Kenneth Alexander at a
dinner attended by graduates in the university's Elphinstone Hall next
week.
Mr Burnett said yesterday: ''This is simply the Lord Lyon recognising
the ancient traditions and history of a university founded by an Act of
Parliament.
''Only peers of the realm, certain Scottish clan chiefs and
incorporated bodies founded by an Act of Parliament or by Royal Charter
are eligible to apply.
''Aberdeen is the first Scottish university to have been granted
supporters. It is a splendid way for the university to celebrate its
quincentenary.''
Aberdeen University was originally two separate colleges with King's
College founded by the Bishop of Aberdeen William Elphinstone in 1495
and Marischal College created in 1593.
King's and Marischal were unified by an Act of Parliament in 1860, a
fact also celebrated by the choice of supporters.
A leopard, wearing a collar in the silver and red colours of Aberdeen
and symbolising the close union of town and gown, stands on the sinister
(or left- hand) side of the coat-of-arms.
Opposite it, a hart collared in the gold and red of the Keith clan
maintains the university's historic link with George Keith, 4th Earl
Marischal, who founded Marischal College 400 years ago.

A MAN was found dead and three people were treated for shock and smoke
inhalation after fire broke out in a pub yesterday.
A police spokeswoman said the blaze was being treated as
''suspicious''.
Nine people were asleep in flats above the World Turned Upside Down
pub in Old Kent Road, east London, when the fire started. The alarm was
raised by a passing policeman.
By the time emergency services arrived at the scene the building was
ablaze with flames leaping from windows.
Men living in the flats climbed on to the roof and windowsills,
waiting to be rescued. One jumped from a first floor window to escape
the flames.
The dead man was found in a rear third-floor bedroom.
Seven ambulances and a helicopter stood by as firefighters rescued
residents using a turntable ladder.
The fire severely damaged all four floors and the roof of the
four-storey building.
Divisional Fire Officer Neil Townsend said: ''When we arrived, there
were people on the roof and windows. Our priority was to rescue them
before dealing with the fire.
''The whole of the building was full of black smoke and it was
bellowing out from the roof. There was intense heat on all floors.''
A Fire Brigade spokesman said: ''At the moment we are treating this
fire as suspicious. It appears to have started at the rear on the ground
floor.
''The people are very lucky to have got out alive. On the outside, the
building was intact but inside it is a mess and very badly damaged.
''There is blood on the windows and shutters where people broke the
glass to call for help.''
Police are investigating a report that there was a row outside the pub
shortly before the fire was spotted at 7.55am.
Superintendent Michael Banks said what appeared to be an imitation
firearm in a leather holster had been found in the room where the body
was found.
He said: ''This is not a murder inquiry as yet. We will not be able to
come to any conclusions until the room and the body have been
examined.''
Investigators said there were no obvious signs of what caused the
fire, and confirmed there did not appear to be any fire alarms in the
building.

CRIMINALS may soon find their faces are their misfortune, thanks to a
Scottish company which, with the help of the police, has perfected a
revolutionary computer ID system.
Stirling-based Forensic Technology Ltd claims the system will be able
to pinpoint suspects as quickly and accurately from witnesses'
descriptions as from their fingerprints.
Face Code Intelligence (FCI) is the brainchild of computer expert
Leslie Bowie, who has been working closely with police and the Scottish
Criminal Record Office. The project is backed by the Police Foundation
and has interested forces throughout the UK.
Dr Bowie, 35, who has applied for Department of Trade funding to
further his research, said yesterday: ''A witness to a crime says the
suspect has a thin face, with eyebrows that meet in the middle, a long
nose, and blonde hair.
''We can put that into the computer and come up with a list of known
offenders with those specific features.''
Dr Bowie is also working on a separate, but complementary package,
which will allow criminals' photographs to be compared with faces caught
on closed circuit cameras at scenes of crime.
He said: ''More and more crime is caught on CCTV cameras, and the
system will give police another source of fast and efficient information
to help solve crimes.''
''A good set of dabs has been the policeman's dream for years. But, if
the town centre closed circuit TV system in Stirling, for example, has
got a couple of good profiles of people involved in a crime, that's
going to be just as valuable.
''The face of a criminal imprinted on video will be the same as a
fingerprint on a desk,'' he added.
At the Scottish Criminal Record Office, Chief Superintendant Roy
Leitch described the project as very interesting, he added: ''The FCI
system could transform a library of pictures into a practical
investigation tool.''
It is thought that six jobs could be created at Forensic Technology's
office at Springkerse, Stirling, once the software package goes into
production.

WHEN the then Secretary of State for Energy, Mr Anthony Wedgwood Benn,
turned a valve 20 years ago yesterday, to allow the first UK offshore
oil to be pumped ashore, he described the occasion as ''a more
significant and more historic day than the moon landing''.
As the oil started to flow from Hamilton Brothers' tiny Argyll field,
180 miles east of Edinburgh, Mr Benn predicted that by 1990, Britain
would be among the world's top seven oil producers. ''That is big
stuff'', he said on a tanker moored at a refinery on the Isle of Grain,
Kent.
The Argyll development was followed soon after by the huge Forties,
Brent, and Ninian fields -- the first of which was inaugurated by the
Queen -- as the race to get more of the black gold ashore became almost
frantic.
Time was of the essence -- with costs much less important -- as oil
companies strove for cashflow, and the Government was eager to see oil
revenues flowing into the coffers.
That scenario continued throughout the late seventies and early
eighties, and it took the oil price crash of 1986 to make everyone
involved realise that oil was subject to market forces like any other
commodity.
The boom of those early years gave way to doom and gloom as the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) fought to recapture
its market share.
However, the impression often given at that time -- that activity in
the North Sea had ground to a halt -- was false, despite idle drilling
rigs, empty construction yards, the spectre of the receiver hanging over
some companies, and the loss of thousands of jobs.
Production continued as the oil industry learned to live with the new
low price and, as time passed, projects which had been put on the shelf
were dusted down and brought to the development phase.
But attitudes had changed, time was now a lot less important and costs
a lot more significant.
One man who has witnessed the industry develop over the past 25 years
is Sir Ian Wood, head of the Aberdeen-based Wood Group, the UK's largest
indigenous energy company.
He believes there was a great danger that the oil proceeds could have
been used, as in Norway, to subsidise and prolong industries which were
no longer competitive.
''We are now living in a small world, which is developing at a fast
rate, and if you are not competitive you are simply not going to win the
work,'' he said.
The UK was very slow to encourage companies to take advantage of what
the North Sea had to offer. But he thinks we are trying hard to catch
up, with a much greater appreciation, in the last five to 10 years, that
these industrial opportunities are worth a lot of money to the UK, and
that we should be looking hard at getting more companies involved
internationally.
In the last 20 years, 1,800,000,000 tonnes of oil have been produced
offshore, with the country becoming self-sufficent in 1981. Production
was just 2,000,000 tonnes in 1975. Ten years later it peaked at
128,000,000, before falling to 91,000,000 in 1991. Last year it was back
to 127,000,000.
The first flow of oil was accompanied by predictions that after rapid
growth things would be in decline by now. But new finds, including major
fields west of the Shetlands, mean that the UK will supply its own oil
for decades to come.

TURKISH police were last night investigating claims that the coach
crash in which three Scots holidaymakers died happened after a lorry
driver fell asleep at the wheel.
Mrs Mhairi Telford, 23, from Broughty Ferry; Miss Catriona Currie, 48,
of Lenzie; and Mr Raymond Hassey, 41, from Edinburgh were killed after a
coach taking 42 tourists from Dalaman Airport to the resort of Marmaris
collided with a lorry. The lorry driver died instantly.
Mrs Telford had been married for just a year. Her husband Sean
suffered two broken legs and a broken collarbone in the crash. The
couple had no children.
The tourists, on a package holiday from Glasgow, described being
showered with blood and glass as the bus plunged into a gully on a busy
road on the Aegean coast in the early hours of Saturday.
Last night the Crawley-based tour operator, Inspiration, said
arrangements were being made to fly home those who were fit enough to
travel, along with relatives flown out on Saturday.
Mr Andrew Blair, 52, from Perth, was thrown through the coach
windscreen in the impact. Speaking from his hotel in Marmaris, he said:
''The crash was horrific. All the seats were concertina-ed to the front
of the bus. Everybody was lying forward. They were screaming.
''We were on a lonely bit of the road and this lorry came straight at
us. We reckon the lorry driver had fallen asleep.''
Inspiration's chief executive, Mr Vic Fatah, said a second medical
team flew out yesterday to join a British doctor and nurse sent out on
Saturday.
The injured were taken to the Fethiye, New State, and Ahu Hetman
hospitals in and around the resort. Last night 17 people were being
detained, including the coach driver and a tour company representative.
Four of the injured were described as being in a serious condition.
Dr Hasan Bulak, a consultant surgeon at the Fethiye Hospital, said
three Scottish women being treated at the hospital were in a stable
condition. Agnes Allan, 57, suffered a chest injury; Linda Ellison, 40,
had a dislocated hip and fractured shoulder; while June Robertson had a
bleeding lung and fractured leg.
He said an insurance company representative had made plans to take the
women home as soon as possible. He added that June Robertson would
require a medical escort home.
The Foreign Office said two consul staff from the British Consulate in
Ankara were in Marmaris to assist tour company officials while the
honorary consul in Marmaris toured hospitals visiting the injured.
Yesterday relatives of the three Scots killed were in a state of shock
as details of the crash filtered through.
At their home in Lenzie, Ruby and Malcolm Currie said their only
daughter Catriona, 48, had flown to Turkey alone but arranged to join a
former school friend, Ms Sheena McAlpine, for a holiday.
The couple said their daughter, who was single and worked for the Bank
of Scotland in Glasgow, had travelled extensively abroad but had never
been to Turkey before.
The mother of Edinburgh victim Mr Hassey said she had not been told of
the circumstances of the accident in which the divorced father of three
died.
Mrs Agnes Hassey, of the Bingham area of Edinburgh, said: ''We were
told by a local policeman at four o'clock on Saturday that Raymond had
been killed in a crash in Turkey.
''No-one from the travel company called later on that night or early
Sunday morning to tell us what had happened. The family really wants to
know some details like how and why it happened.
''Raymond had a wide circle of friends and had gone on holiday with
one of his pals. I don't know his pal's name but we are hoping he is
okay.''
Mr Hassey was a machine fitter and had just started a new job in
Edinburgh.
Mrs Telford was the manageress of her family's business, Strachan's
Wallpaper and Fabric Shop, in Broughty Ferry.
At their home in Broughty Ferry, her parents, James and Jane Strachan,
were too upset to speak but the family minister, the Rev Alan Mackay,
said he visited the elderly couple as soon as he heard the news.
The Telfords were a very devoted couple, he said. ''They were very
close to one another. The family is in total shock.''
He added: ''She will be very much missed and it is hard to take in.
She was a happy, cheerful, and outgoing girl with a very friendly
manner.''
Mr Telford's parents have flown out to Turkey to comfort their son.

THE pilot of the Greenpeace-chartered helicopter which dodged water
cannons to drop two activists on board the Brent Spar oil installation
may face prosecution, the Civil Aviation Authority said last night.
Officials yesterday began studying video footage which allegedly shows
that the aircraft was not displaying registration markings.
The CAA is also expected to investigate whether lives were put at risk
when the helicopter flew below water jets fired from standby vessels
surrounding the Spar on Friday.
A CAA spokesman said: ''Failure to display any registration
contravenes the Air Navigation Order and a guilty pilot could face a
fine or light jail sentence. Because registration was obscured, we are
having difficulty determining where the aircraft comes from. It could
take some time to track down the pilot.
''I cannot confirm at the moment if any charges will be brought over
the actual flying operation but our legal experts will be looking at the
whole case.''
Meanwhile, Greenpeace said it was taking advice over possible legal
action against Shell, which owns the Brent Spar. A spokeswoman in
Shetland said Greenpeace was ''outraged'' at Shell's use of water
cannons in an alleged attempt to prevent the helicopter reaching the
Spar.
She added: ''It appears the water cannons were not just forming a
protective curtain but were trained on the helicopter as it flew around
the Spar. Obviously, this is highly irresponsible and dangerous and we
are currently taking legal advice over the possibility of action against
Shell.
''It seems quite clear that the fire hoses changed direction and
followed the helicopter. It could easily have been brought down into the
water and I hate to think what the consequences would have been had that
happened.''
Greenpeace, Shell, and the Navy are meantime engaged in a
cat-and-mouse game on the high seas.
The two activists on board the Brent Spar insist they will remain for
as long as necessary to prevent it being dumped in the North Atlantic.
Two other activists were picked up by Shell's standby vessel Rembras
after they failed to board the Spar. Greenpeace has claimed the Rembras
refused to release them.
A Navy ship was reported to be heading towards the flotilla shadowing
the Brent Spar to serve an arrest warrant on Mr Jonathon Castle -- the
so-called Captain Greenpeace -- who led the original occupation of the
Spar and is skippering the Greenpeace vessel Altair.
Mr Castle failed to appear at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on
Thursday after being ordered to attend and explain why he had not
complied with an earlier ruling ordering him to identify the Greenpeace
members who occupied the Spar for three weeks last month.
In a bid to prevent any further activity from the Altair, the Shell
supply vessel Kronbas has been detached from the main flotilla to follow
her every move. ''We are playing cat-and-mouse,'' said the Kronbas
skipper, Mr Frank Bonsaksen. ''He steps up speed, I step up speed. He
eases and I ease.''
When the Kronbas sprayed jets from its water cannons to prevent a
Greenpeace helicopter from dropping supplies to the two men on board the
Spar, the Greenpeace crew held up a banner saying ''Welcome back
Spartans.''
The Kronbas's Norwegian crew quickly made up a banner of their own
which sent back the message: ''Hel (sic) Mamma. We love you.''
There is little sympathy among the crew of the Kronbas for the tactics
being employed by Greenpeace. The Altair has half a dozen fast
inflatables which are expected to be launched at the start of the
operation to remove the protesters from Brent Spar before the charges
are blown which will send the installation to the bottom.
''No doubt we will be expected to put our necks on the line to rescue
them when things go wrong,'' said a crewman on the Kronbas.
As the Spar flotilla headed further out into the Atlantic at around
two knots, two sister ships of the Kronbas were keeping up a curtain of
spray around the oil installation.
Last night, the Brent Spar was about 90 miles north of Lewis and,
despite growing pressure to abandon its plans, Shell was still intending
to dump it at a site 150 miles off the West of Scotland tomorrow.
Another Greenpeace vessel, Solo, which has a helicopter deck, is
expected to be used to try to prevent Shell from using explosives to
scuttle the Spar.
Meanwhile, Shell announced yesterday it was postponing a planned
high-profile environmental campaign due to take place on Wednesday,
saying in a letter to invited guests that it had ''very reluctantly''
decided to delay the event because of the ''increasingly emotional
debate''.
It also claimed that Greenpeace's ''so-called day of action'' at Shell
service stations had ''barely occurred''.
A spokesman said: ''This has been yet another attempt by Greenpeace to
alarm people with inaccurate and misleading information. We believe our
customers are capable of balancing the inaccurate and alarmist claims of
Greenpeace against the facts, which are that disposal of the Brent Spar
in the deep Atlantic poses negligible threat to the marine environment
and is the best all-round solution, balancing all the environmental,
health, safety, engineering, and economic factors.''
Greenpeace, however, claimed successful blockades had been mounted at
sites in Bristol, Milton Keynes, Exmouth, Exeter, Christchurch, Cardiff,
and London, with up to 75% of motorists turning away. One demonstrator
in Manchester city-centre was arrested for obstruction but released
after a caution.
The group also appeared to be attracting more support from Opposition
MPs. Labour's environment spokesman, Mr Frank Dobson, said people should
boycott Shell filling stations to protest the dumping and Liberal
Democrat environment spokesman Mr Matthew Taylor said he was
''delighted'' to see consumers avoiding Shell in other countries.
The leader of the Scottish National Party, Mr Alex Salmond, said:
''The hulk of the Brent Spar must be safely anchored offshore until a
proper debate has taken place on how best to dispose of it. Both the
Government and the oil companies have made vast profits out of the North
Sea -- they cannot be allowed to simply squeeze it dry and then dump the
hulks as they see fit.''

COREY Pavin, who had lost in a play-off for the Kemper Open only eight
days before, more than made amends for that disappointment when, at
Shinnecock Hills yesterday, he won the ninety-fifth US Open
Championship. In exacting conditions the 35-year-old Californian
produced a brilliant inward half of 33 for a 68 and a par total of 280
which gave him his first major victory by two strokes.
Pavin, at 5ft 9ins and weighing less than 11 stone, one of the most
slightly built of golfing champions, first took the lead when, having
holed from 12 feet for a birdie 3 at the twelfth, he hit his approach 10
feet away at the fifteenth for another birdie 3. This most determined of
competitors then saved par from behind the green at the short
seventeenth.
Finally, at the difficult last hole, Pavin hit his drive securely into
the fairway and then with his metal No.4 wood he struck a glorious shot
to within five feet of the hole. The ball finished out of his sight and
after he had run up the fairway Pavin raised his arms in triumph when he
saw the result.
Pavin did miss the birdie putt but that proved unimportant. Norman, as
he has done in the past, could not produce the vital shots at the
crucial time. His pitch at the long sixteenth came up short, and having
missed that birdie opportunity to draw level with Pavin, the Australian
bunkered his next tee shot and that was that.
Thus once again Norman had to be content to be runner-up, as he was 11
years ago when he lost in a play-off to Fuzzy Zoeller. His one birdie of
the afternoon, at the fifteenth, and his first since he chipped in from
behind the home green in the second round, renewed hope but came too
late.
Sportingly Norman, twice winner of the Open Championship,
congratulated Pavin by saying: ''Welcome to the club. You played really
well and you've won a championship at last.'' Pavin was indeed able to
untie the unsolicited label from around his neck describing him as ''the
best American professional not have won a major.''
Tom Lehman, also one behind with three to play, came to grief with a
double bogey 7 at the long sixteenth (the hole which cost Phil Mickelson
a crippling two 6s and two 7s) to finish third, a stroke behind Norman.
Bob Tway, relatively only two behind with three to play, bogeyed them
all to finish tenth (on 285), a costly stroke behind the six players who
tied for fourth place.
The pattern of play and the scoring on the outward half reflected the
pressures of the occasion and the conditions -- a strong and capricious
breeze from the Atlantic Ocean and dry and running fairways at the end
of which lay small greens, fine in texture but firm and growing crusty
after more than three days of wind and hot sunshine.
There were far more scores below the 6944-yard course's par of 70 than
the meagre three returned on Saturday, and Neal Lancaster equalled the
record of 65 also set in the last round nine years ago. But the pin
positions were less severe and most were returned by players out early
or past the turn before the wind had reached its full strength. At
various points, separately or together, Norman, Lehman, and Tway led or
shared the lead. Norman turned in 36, one over, having failed to achieve
a birdie in his last 27 holes; Lehman offset three bogeys with two
birdies to be out in 36; and Tway, one behind the two leaders at the
start, drew level by turning in the par of 35.
While the leaders suffered their drought of birdies, Pavin's at the
ninth brought him first clearly into the frame.
The European challenge came to nothing. Colin Montgomerie with 68, and
Miguel Angel Jimenez with 69, alone bettered par, and Mark Roe,
currently eighty-second on the European Order of Merit, and competing
for the first time, led the contingent of eight who survived the 36-hole
cut. The tailender was Nick Faldo.
Montgomerie's last shot was the No.3 iron of 218 yards he holed at the
450 yard eighteenth -- ''A nice way to finish, especially when all I was
trying to do was be below the flagstick. His score was his lowest of the
event and his total of 288, eight over par, was, in the old parlance,
level 4s for the championship.
Montgomerie summed up his performance, as Faldo also might have done,
as ''it just didn't happen.'' Of his own game he added: ''I'm just not
scoring as well as I'm playing.'' Yesterday his driving was long and
straight but lacked support from his approach play and his holing out
was inconsistent.
Faldo, whose next appearance will be in the Scottish Open at
Carnoustie the week before the Open Championship at St Andrews, said:
''I just didn't do what I wanted to do and I'll have to go back home and
work on my game.''

THE scientist who told Shell that dumping the Brent Spar in deep water
was likely to affect the environment less than breaking it up on land
said yesterday that he thought it unlikely other installations would
follow it to a watery grave.
Dr Gordon Picken, manager of the environmental division within
Aberdeen University Research and Industrial Services, said the Brent
Spar was a special case because its tanks had been damaged during its
working life and towing it inshore posed a greater risk to vulnerable
marine life in, for instance, a firth.
He said he did not believe dumping at sea would create a precedent for
other installations, as they were virtually all of different design and
fulfilled different functions.
His remarks appeared to reinforce the argument made by Environment
Minister Tim Eggar, who was involved in an angry on-air television clash
with Greenpeace's Chris Rose.
Mr Eggar accused Greenpeace of ''grossly exaggerating the problem and
completely misconstruing the independent studies that have been carried
out''.
Greenpeace argued that environmental studies showed Brent Spar's
storage tanks still contained more than 5000 tonnes of oil which would
go down with the Spar.
Mr Rose said it should be cleaned up on land instead of being sunk at
sea and added that engineers were willing to do the job and that the rig
could be repaired sufficiently to make it perfectly safe to decommission
on land.
Mr Eggar said that was ''simply not a sensible approach'', adding:
''You would have to take a vertical oil tank, which is Brent Spar, and
put it horizontal. There is a significant danger that if that happened
there would be a rupturing of that tank.
''You would have to tow it into shallow water -- that is likely to
cause very significant environmental damage in shallow water -- and then
have to take it apart, partly on water and partly on land, with very
serious adverse environmental impact.''
Dr Picken's department contributed to the environmental impact
assessment which, along with other considerations, allowed Shell and the
Department of Trade and Industry to conclude that the Best Practicable
Environmental Option (BPEO) for the Spar was to dump it at sea.
''If you put it in the sea there will be a small amount of
contaminants in the sea. In general, that is to be avoided if possible.
If it is decommissioned on land you can recycle some stuff, some of the
waste will go to a landfill site, and you will incinerate some more,''
said Dr Picken.
But, he warned, if an accident happened to the Spar, which is one of a
tiny handful of floating oil storage buoys, and it happened close to
shore, it was likely to spill all this material into the environment.
''Notionally, the environmental consequences, although still small,
are slightly greater than the deep sea,'' he said.
At Shell's chosen dumping spot, the contaminants not capable of
bio-degrading would affect marine life within only a couple of hundred
metres. In shallow water, by contrast, the marine life would be much
richer and might form the basis of organisms eaten by humans, birds, and
seals.
Dr Picken added that, of the 219 other UK oil platforms in the North
Sea, 148 are in the Southern gas fields in water too shallow to permit
them to be partially decommissioned under guidelines laid down by the
International Maritime Organisation, so ''they will all come out''.
''They are relatively light and small and I am sure they will be
loaded on to barges and recycled,'' he said.
The structures in deep water would be partially demolished, he
predicted.

A THIEF has bunkered Terry Wogan's golfing holiday -- by stealing the
radio and TV star's favourite clubs from his back garden.
The raider climbed a wall and a fence to get into the gardens of the
broadcaster's Buckinghamshire home.
The Wogans' #750,000 home near Taplow, Bucks is guarded by
sophisticated alarms and a high wall. But the burglar bypassed the house
and got into the grounds -- and the shed where Wogan kept his favourite
six iron and putter among other clubs and golf equipment.
The theft was only noticed when Wogan went to check his trolleys,
ready for a golfing holiday. Police were called but Wogan and wife Helen
asked officers not to tell the media about his Irish bad luck.
However, police at Burnham, Bucks, have now confirmed that a thief had
entered the property and stolen golfing equipment.

Brussels
BRITAIN'S efforts to improve transport conditions for animals exported
for slaughter could fail this week if last-ditch efforts to reach
agreement with other EU countries end in deadlock.
The French, current holders of the rotating EU presidency, will make a
final effort to broker a deal in the row which has led to demonstrations
in Britain and Europe against the length of time exported animals must
spend in cramped conditions before they reach slaughterhouses.
However, France is due to hand over the presidency to the Spanish at
the end of this month after the Cannes summit. Most EU states expect the
Spanish to play down the issue because many southern EU states, Spain
included, oppose British opinion.
The dispute has lasted almost two years, during which Mr Neil Kinnock,
European Transport Commissioner, has suggested plans for introducing
reduced times.
His ideas require approval from the council of farm ministers. It is
due to meet in Brussels today, although the issue of travel times for
animals might not be reached until the middle of the week.
''This is the last opportunity for some time,'' a European Commission
farm spokesman admitted yesterday.
States opposing the reduction of journey times and an increase in rest
periods believe new measures proposed by Mr Kinnock -- matching rest
periods for animals to breaks for drivers -- would involve punitive
increases in costs, making imports of live animals too expensive. They
believe tens of thousands of workers could be forced out of jobs.
After the Spanish presidency, the Italians will take over -- but they,
too, are opposed to the new rules. A fresh initiative is, therefore,
unlikely for another year until Ireland, which shares most British views
on the issue, assumes the presidency.
France, also under pressure from some of its importers, has asked
other EU states for ideas on a suggestion by EU Farming Commissioner
Franz Fischler who is also trying to break the deadlock. He has
suggested a basic eight-hour journey limit for slaughter animals which
could be varied according to the age and type of animal as well as
standard of vehicle.

IT WAS only a question of time before Sweden's Annika Sorenstam won a
maiden European title. She did so in style when she produced a closing
68 in heavy rain to win the OVB Open at Zell am See in Austria
yesterday.
With a 22-under-par 270, a new world record for women's professional
golf, Sorenstam finished three strokes clear of Laura Davies, with
Australian Corinne Dibnah one stroke further behind.
Six times in two years Sorenstam has endured second places in Europe,
and twice this season in America, but there was little doubt the
frustration was about to end yesterday.
Few believed Davies, five behind at the start of the day, would go
down without a fight. True to form she didn't, as she reeled off seven
birdies in nine holes from the fourth. Davies finished with a
best-of-the-day 66 but it was not enough.
Sorenstam collected only her second bogey in four days at the sixth
but from the eighth she birdied three of the next four holes. Leading
final scores (British and Irish unless stated):
270 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden) 66, 69, 67, 68 (#15,000).
273 -- L Davies 70, 67, 70, 66 (#10,150).
274 -- C Dibnah (Australia) 67, 69, 70, 68 (#7000).
275 -- S Prosser 70, 69, 65, 71.
278 -- M Lunn (Australia) 68, 74, 69, 67; K Webb (Australia) 72, 68,
68, 70; M-L de Lorenzi (France) 69, 69, 69, 71.
279 -- W Doolan (Australia) 66, 71, 74, 68; E Orley (Switzerland) 68,
67, 74, 70; H Wadsworth 68, 71, 68, 72.
Scottish scores: 290 -- M McKinlay 74, 71, 73, 72; 291 -- D Reid 75,
71, 71, 75; J Forbes 70, 73, 76, 72; 293 -- G Stewart 71, 75, 72, 75;

JANICE Moodie of Windyhill lost out to English National Champion Julie
Hall at the twenty-first hole in Saturday's semi-final of the British
Women's Amateur Championship at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland,
missing a three-foot putt which would have kept the game alive.
Moodie was three up on her Curtis Cup colleague after six holes but
Hall levelled the game at the eleventh. The two were three under par for
their round.
Hall missed five-foot putts at the twentieth and twenty-first, and the
game looked certain to go to the next when Moodie, a golf scholarship
student at San Jose University in America, left a three-foot putt on the
lip of the hole.
''I can't have any regrets after playing such a great game,'' said the
22-year-old. ''I feel my game is really starting to come together now.
I'm more consistent and have only been out of the top five once in 11
tournaments in the States this season, and that was at the Nationals,
where I finished sixth.''
Hall went on to win the title for the second time in five years when
she defeated Kristel Mourgue D'Algue, of France, 3 and 2 in the final,
consigning the 21-year-old to the same fate as her mother, Cecilia, who
was runner-up last year at Newport.
The clincher came at the par-4 sixteenth when Mourgue D'Algue, who
finished ninth at this year's Evian Masters event, pulled her drive to
within 12 inches of the out-of-bounds fence and took four to reach the
green. Results:
Semi-final: J Hall (Felixstowe Ferry) beat J Moodie (Windyhill) at the
twenty-first. Final: Hall beat Mourgue D'Algue.

TAX cuts and help for hard-pressed home owners are the way back for
the Government to help its disaffected natural supporters, Employment
Secretary Michael Portillo indicated yesterday.
His comments came as back-bench pressure intensified on Mr Major and
the Government to take steps to revive Tory fortunes in the build-up to
the next General Election.
A number of back-bench MPs made clear yesterday that they felt many
traditional Tory supporters believed they had been let down by measures
taken by the Government in recent years, and must be encouraged back
into the fold. They were given some encouragement by right-winger Mr
Portillo, who echoed their concerns and called for unity.
He said: ''The party has certainly got pretty fevered and that has got
to end. This party has been elected to govern for a five-year period
and, unless it gets itself together and pulls its socks up, it will not
be able to win the next election.
''We must get behind the leader of the party and we must start talking
about the policies that we want to put to the electorate, and the
difficulties there will be if we were to elect a Labour Government.''
Mr Portillo added: ''We have two years left and we are in power, and
we must use the privelege of being in power to ensure that, by our
actions, as well as our words, we reinforce the values of the people who
are Conservative supporters, and we should be supporting.
''We are talking about people who are home owners and families, people
who make provision for the future, people who take responsibility for
themselves and fulfil their duties in their communities.''
He said he was not the Chancellor but as living standards rose he
thought there would a be ''a little more leeway'' to cut taxes.
Such a move would be likely to be seen by the Tories' opponents as
little more than a cyncial electoral bribe but it was one of the few
weapons left in their armoury and it had worked before.
A reduction of 1p or 2p in the basic rate, coupled with help over
mortgage tax relief, and particularly help for first-time buyers, might
do something to steer the ship back on course.
Tory MPs calling for such moves yesterday included senior back
benchers such as Mr John Townend, who warned that the party was in
danger of losing its image as the party of home ownership, and Mr Den
Dover, MP for Chorley, who said: ''If we can't cut taxes and do
something to stimulate and encourage the home owner, we will deserve to
go down.''
The Prime Minister himself, after a disastrous week in which he saw
his appearance at the G7 summit in Nova Scotia totally overshadowed by
the domestic squabbling in the Tory Party and fresh speculation about a
leadership challenge, spent yesterday at home, ostensibly watching
England's rugby World Cup defeat.
Sources said, however, that he had been kept in touch with
developments on the party front and he will receive more information
this morning at his regular Monday meeting with Chief Whip Richard Ryder
and party chairman Mr Jeremy Hanley.
The Prime Minister will make a Commons statement on G7 before the
potentially explosive three-hour, Labour-initiated debate on BMARC.
On his way back from G7, Mr Major was defiant. He told reporters he
would not be deflected from policies he believed were right and, on the
prospect of a leadership challenge, remarked: ''If anybody wishes to
challenge for leadership of the Tory Party, there is a constitutional
procedure for doing so. We will wait and see whether they do.''
Senior party figures rallied round, with both Lord Parkinson and Lord
Archer making pleas for unity. Lord Archer, writing in the News of the
World, said Conservative electoral prospects would not be improved by Mr
Heseltine or Mr Portillo becoming party leader.
He said: ''We do not need change at the top, we need unity. We cannot
hope to win the next General Election -- in fact we will be beaten out
of sight -- if we don't get behind our leader, John Major, and support
him.''
The opposition parties, meanwhile, continued to heap scorn on the
Tories' plight.
Liberal Democrat leader Mr Paddy Ashdown said on GMTV: ''The problem
is not the leader, it is the Tory party. It is riven from top to bottom,
it is in chaos, it cannot unite around a single key policy, it is racked
with sleaze and scandal, and is simply not capable of governing the
country any longer.''
Mr Major suffered another blow yesterday when Mr David Sainsbury,
chairman of the supermarket giant and cousin of former Tory Minister Sir
Tim Sainsbury, declared his support for Labour leader Mr Tony Blair.
According to the Sunday Express, Mr Sainsbury, who helped finance Dr
David (now Lord) Owen's Social Democratic party through the 1980s, said
he had a great deal of admiration for Mr Blair.
''He has significantly transformed the political scene. He has brought
Labour into a position where he can get a lot of people who deserted it
when it swung very much to the Left.''
* BBC1's Panorama programme will tonight screen a profile of Mr
Portillo, the son of a Spanish Republican, in which a school friend says
the Employment Secretary -- christened Denzil Xavier Portillo (Michael
was added later) -- predicted as a child that he would never achieve his
ambition to become Prime Minister because of his name.

MARATHON man Pete Sampras moved into menacing pre-Wimbledon form
yesterday by beating Guy Forget to win his first Stella Artois
championship at Queen's Club, London.
Then he warned his Wimbledon rivals: ''My confidence is back and I
feel in top form.''
A disappointed Forget said: ''Pete has had an average year by his
standards, but he's coming back. He will be a big threat to everyone at
Wimbledon.''
Forget made the final by defeating Boris Becker 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Afterwards, Becker complained again of a calf muscle strain and headed
back to Germany for treatment.
Knee and ankle injuries plus anxiety over the health of coach Tim
Gullikson have restricted the Sampras winners' cheques this year with
his last tournament triumph coming at Indian Wells in March.
But Sampras, who bids for a third successive Wimbledon crown,
thoroughly deserved his #45,806 prize. He played 71 games, plus two
tie-breaks, in two high pressure matches separated by just a couple of
hours.
Yesterday's rain had cost the tournament insurers #220,000 in refunds
to soggy spectators, and it meant a crowded revised schedule for the
players. The early start did not suit Sampras. He struggled to squeeze
past unseeded German Marc Goellner in a surprisingly tight semi-final,
where he indulged in the ultimate brinkmanship.
Sampras was reprieved from potential disaster when nervy Goellner
double-faulted as he served for a 5-2 third-set lead. The American world
No.2 saved three match points before winning 6-7, 6-2, 13-11.
''I was pretty lucky to come through,'' admitted Sampras. ''I lived
nine lives. But I rebounded from that for the final.''
It was much more straightforward for Sampras against world No.28
Forget. The pair slugged it out, trading high velocity services over 69
minutes of high powered, if not highly entertaining, tennis.
Just one 10-shot rally interrupted the tedium of serve and volley. It
ended with Sampras slipping over only for Forget, with half a court to
aim at, carefully steering the ball wide.
There were only 10 points against serve outside the inevitable
tie-breaks, Sampras sending down 21 aces to Forget's 15 as the American
triumphed 7-6, 7-6 at his seventh attempt at winning the Stella title.
Last year he lost the final against Todd Martin by an identical score.
''It was just like last year except, this time, I found the right shots
at the right time,'' said Sampras.
''When you have two big servers serving well you are not going to get
a lot of rallies.''
So much for the new, lower pressure balls supposed to slow down the
big servers. When the sun shines and the courts are hard it is
impossible to spot any difference.
Sampras was back on court in the evening to partner Martin to a
doubles semi-final victory over top-seeded Australians Todd Woodbridge
and Mark Woodforde 6-3, 3-6, 12-10.
It brought the Sampras statistics to 111 games in three matches spread
over five-and-a-half hours.
Sampras intended to have a couple of days off but must return to
Queen's Club today for the doubles final against Swedes Jonas Bjorkman
and Jan Apell.
* ZINA Garrison-Jackson warmed up for her last Wimbledon challenge by
recapturing the DFS Women's Classic title at Birmingham, ending her
former Texan neighbour Lori McNeil's dominance of the event.
McNeil walked off with the trophy when the pair, both aged 31 and
ranked No.27 and 28 in the world, met in the two previous DFS finals.
But there was to be no hat trick as Garrison-Jackson's greater
aggression and mobility earned her a 6-3, 6-3 victory, plus the #16,000
first prize, in just 70 minutes.
McNeil, who caused a surprise at Wimbledon last year by knocking out
Steffi Graf in the first round and going on to the semi-finals, may have
been dreaming of completing a hat trick at Birmingham.
But she certainly did not need the trio of volleying errors which
proved the turning point of the match. Garrison-Jackson broke twice in
the opening set, and after losing her own serve in the opening game of
the second set, broke McNeil a further two times to secure victory.

Halifax, Nova Scotia
EFFORTS to block nuclear technology sales to Iran and address the
global struggle against unemployment have been reinforced by the Group
of Seven after its annual meeting which wound up on Saturday in Halifax
with a promise of separate summits on jobs and nuclear security next
year.
Although the war in Bosnia and Chechen terrorism overshadowed
proceedings, the leaders of the world's seven most economically powerful
nations also agreed to the creation of a multi-national task force on
crime and proposed substantive reform of the United Nations and
international financial institutions.
For the seven men who spent 48 hours forging personal alliances and
comparing notes on the pains and pleasures of governing, the summit was
an opportunity to show the voters back home that their leader is a major
player on the world stage.
The obvious winner was Jacques Chirac. France's new president avoided
the predicted criticisms of his decision to resume nuclear testing in
the south Pacific. And he earned credit for justifying his reputation as
''the bulldozer'' in his meetings with his fellow statesmen.
At the first dinner, he brushed aside the scheduled discussion of
global economic reforms to insist that Bosnia was an issue too urgent to
wait for the arrival of Boris Yeltsin the next day. Foreign Ministers
were called in from their dinner for talks and Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien was forced to issue a statement on the new UN rapid
reaction force in the early hours of Friday morning.
Chirac then went on to extract agreement for a jobs summit for Finance
and Employment Ministers in France next year to discuss ways of tackling
the stubbornly high unemployment in industrialised countries. He
produced the event's most memorable phrase by describing international
currency speculation as ''the Aids of the global economy''.
If Chirac emerged the winner, President Bill Clinton was the clear
loser. He arrived in Halifax clutching a letter from the Republican
leadership in Congress announcing that they would not agree to America's
paying its statutory share of the rapid reaction force.
With the UN resolution authorising the troop reinforcement awaiting a
final vote, Mr Clinton had to ask the other six leaders to set aside the
financing question and make do with his moral support while he promised
to take up the matter with Congress immediately on his return to
Washington. Understanding words from his colleagues could not mask their
annoyance or his embarrassment. The leader of the last remaining
superpower was left looking distinctly powerless and isolated.
For Mr John Major the summit itself was a success. UN reform was at
the top of the British agenda, as was a proposal to use 5% of the
International Monetary Fund's gold reserves to offset the crushing
international debt burden of some of the world's poorest countries,
which made considerable progress against substantial opposition.
But there was difficulty over the disposal of Shell's Brent Spar oil
installation. Germany unexpectedly chose to raise the issue after the
storm of protest that has greeted the plan to sink the platform at sea.
Mr Major was buttonholed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl as they finished a
plenary session and left in no doubt about his concerns. The Government
was caught on the hop but maintained its support for Shell's action.
The Prime Minister was also dogged throughout by his deteriorating
political fortunes. He found himself compared to an African dictator
whose supporters take advantage of his absence to launch a coup attempt.
Despite the press challenging him at every turn with the latest rumours
from Westminster, Mr Major managed to appear relaxed as he insisted that
he would keep to the policies he had embarked upon. He conspicuously
avoided lowering himself to the level of his critics, calling instead
for them to turn their fire on the Labour Party.
Asked if he would consider his position on his return, Mr Major said
the only thing he planned to contemplate in the privacy of his weekend
was the fate of England in the rugby World Cup. He then marched out of
his final press conference and led his entire delegation straight into
the lavatories. His followers soon realised the mistake but it was too
late. The press noticed and the jokes about ''at least they follow him
to the toilet'' followed.
The final communique contained no surprises. Urged on by the example
of Mexico's brush with financial collapse late last year, the Seven
agreed to double the funds available to the IMF to assist countries in
sudden difficulty. They also announced detailed provisions for
international economic monitoring to spot a crisis before it develops.
Stabilising IFIs was accompanied by a call to use the 50th anniversary
of the founding of the United Nations as an opportunity to overhaul its
creaking institutions. The UN section of the communique was dominated by
words such as ''reduce overlap'', ''avoid duplication'', ''rationalise''
-- all euphemisms for abolishing the myriad of UN agencies and
programmes that no longer serve a justifiable purpose. The Seven were
political enough to recognise that other UN members might want to be
consulted.
But a marker has been put down. The nations that foot the bill will no
longer tolerate the bureaucratic inefficiencies and budgetary waste that
have brought the UN to its knees.
Although no mention was made in the communique of including the
Security Council's permanent membership in the list of things needing
examination, Japan raised the issue in the discussions.
It was only a polite cough from the world's second most powerful
economy but it will have been noticed by Britain and France, whose
claims to a seat 50 years after the war look increasingly tenuous.
Boris Yeltsin came and was lectured on his uncompromising approach to
the war in Chechnya while his jet waited fully fuelled to rush him home
if the hostage situation worsened. Russia is essential to efforts in
Bosnia and in keeping pariah nations such as Iran in check.
That was why the summit accepted his idea of a summit in Russia next
year to discuss the security of civil nuclear programmes and the need to
keep nuclear weapon technology out of the hands of both international
smugglers and Iran. American pressure for action against Tehran was
satisfied with the first expression of support for Salman Rushdie by a
G7 summit in the six years since the fatwah was pronounced.
That Mr Major seemed at ease despite his domestic concerns was
attributable in part to the contagious informality of the summit. The
welcome of the New Scots, who cheered every motorcade and delighted in
the British delegation's habit of walking between hotel and summit site,
was singled out for praise, even if in the same breath Mr Major
expressed support for attempts to streamline G7 even further, with
smaller delegations and no Finance or Foreign Ministers.

AN eight-year-old girl badly injured when a live shell exploded on an
Army firing range yesterday is in intensive care after an emergency
operation.
Her two brothers, aged nine and 10, were also injured in the incident
at Great Mis Tor, near Princetown on Dartmoor.
The girl, who suffered two shrapnel perforations in her stomach, was
on a family outing when the shell exploded. Her two brothers were also
hit by shrapnel but their wounds were said to be superficial.
Their father raced two miles from the remote tor to call the emergency
services.
A West Country Ambulance Trust spokesman said he was ''hysterical''
when he made the emergency call. ''He had to leave the children up there
on their own. He was covered in blood,'' she said.
The girl was flown to hospital in Plymouth by police helicopter with a
paramedic. Her brothers were taken to the same hospital by Devon air
ambulance.
A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said the description of the
device given by one of the children indicated that it could have been
lying there for some time.
''They have obviously disturbed something,'' he said, adding that the
police and the Army would be investigating the incident. ''We believe
the injuries were caused by a military explosive device, a shell of some
sort.''
The chairman of Devon County Council's Dartmoor National Park
Committee, Mr Jack Wigmore, said there were notices warning people not
to touch objects.
''The advice to the public is if you see any metal objects certainly
do not touch them.''
Dartmoor National Park Officer, Dr Nick Atkinson, said the military
was meticulous in accounting for every shell fired on the range and if
one did not go off they were careful to locate it.
The ranges were regarded as safe to walk on when there was no live
firing, he said, but people were encouraged to report metal objects
found to the military or a national park ranger.

COREY Pavin, who had lost in a play-off for the Kemper Open only eight
days before, more than made amends for that disappointment when, at
Shinnecock Hills yesterday, he won the ninety-fifth US Open
Championship. In exacting conditions the 35-year-old Californian
produced a brilliant inward half of 33 for a 68 and a par total of 280
which gave him his first major victory by two strokes.
Pavin, at 5ft 9ins and weighing less than 11 stone, one of the most
slightly built of golfing champions, first took the lead when, having
holed from 12 feet for a birdie 3 at the twelfth, he hit his approach 10
feet away at the fifteenth for another birdie 3. This most determined of
competitors then saved par from behind the green at the short
seventeenth.
Finally, at the difficult last hole, Pavin hit his drive securely into
the fairway and then with his metal No.4 wood he struck a glorious shot
to within five feet of the hole. The ball finished out of his sight and
after he had run up the fairway Pavin raised his arms in triumph when he
saw the result.
Pavin did miss the birdie putt but that proved unimportant. Norman, as
he has done in the past, could not produce the vital shots at the
crucial time. His pitch at the long sixteenth came up short, and having
missed that birdie opportunity to draw level with Pavin, the Australian
bunkered his next tee shot and that was that.
Thus once again Norman had to be content to be runner-up, as he was 11
years ago when he lost in a play-off to Fuzzy Zoeller. His one birdie of
the afternoon, at the fifteenth, and his first since he chipped in from
behind the home green in the second round, renewed hope but came too
late.
Sportingly Norman, twice winner of the Open Championship,
congratulated Pavin by saying: ''Welcome to the club. You played really
well and you've won a championship at last.'' Pavin was indeed able to
untie the unsolicited label from around his neck describing him as ''the
best American professional not have won a major.''
Tom Lehman, also one behind with three to play, came to grief with a
double bogey 7 at the long sixteenth (the hole which cost Phil Mickelson
a crippling two 6s and two 7s) to finish third, a stroke behind Norman.
Bob Tway, relatively only two behind with three to play, bogeyed them
all to finish tenth (on 285), a costly stroke behind the six players who
tied for fourth place.
The pattern of play and the scoring on the outward half reflected the
pressures of the occasion and the conditions -- a strong and capricious
breeze from the Atlantic Ocean and dry and running fairways at the end
of which lay small greens, fine in texture but firm and growing crusty
after more than three days of wind and hot sunshine.
There were far more scores below the 6944-yard course's par of 70 than
the meagre three returned on Saturday, and Neal Lancaster equalled the
record of 65 also set in the last round nine years ago. But the pin
positions were less severe and most were returned by players out early
or past the turn before the wind had reached its full strength. At
various points, separately or together, Norman, Lehman, and Tway led or
shared the lead. Norman turned in 36, one over, having failed to achieve
a birdie in his last 27 holes; Lehman offset three bogeys with two
birdies to be out in 36; and Tway, one behind the two leaders at the
start, drew level by turning in the par of 35.
While the leaders suffered their drought of birdies, Pavin's at the
ninth brought him first clearly into the frame.
The European challenge came to nothing. Colin Montgomerie with 68, and
Miguel Angel Jimenez with 69, alone bettered par, and Mark Roe,
currently eighty-second on the European Order of Merit, and competing
for the first time, led the contingent of eight who survived the 36-hole
cut. The tailender was Nick Faldo.
Montgomerie's last shot was the No.3 iron of 218 yards he holed at the
450 yard eighteenth -- ''A nice way to finish, especially when all I was
trying to do was be below the flagstick. His score was his lowest of the
event and his total of 288, eight over par, was, in the old parlance,
level 4s for the championship.
Montgomerie summed up his performance, as Faldo also might have done,
as ''it just didn't happen.'' Of his own game he added: ''I'm just not
scoring as well as I'm playing.'' Yesterday his driving was long and
straight but lacked support from his approach play and his holing out
was inconsistent.
Faldo, whose next appearance will be in the Scottish Open at
Carnoustie the week before the Open Championship at St Andrews, said:
''I just didn't do what I wanted to do and I'll have to go back home and
work on my game.''

ANDREW Oldcorn chalked up only his second Volvo European Tour victory
yesterday -- thanks to advice from Scottish rugby legend Gavin Hastings.
The Edinburgh-based, Bolton-born star revealed he had peace of mind on
the final day of the D H L Jersey Open at La Moye after sessions with
psychologist Dr Richard Cox, who was recommended to him by Hastings.
Oldcorn began the day three shots ahead and closed with a 69 for a 273
total, 15 under par, to take the #50,000 first prize, two clear of
Scotland's rising young star Dean Robertson.
It was a fine performance by Oldcorn, who last won in Cadiz two years
ago when he took the Andalucian Masters.
He said: ''I didn't feel threatened at any stage today. I drew on my
experience and played solidly from tee to green. I am happy with the way
I coped. Working with a psychologist has paid off.
''Dr Cox works with the Scottish rugby team and Gavin Hastings told me
to go and see him. Today was a good test to try the things we have been
working on. I was so in control and I enjoyed it. Under a pressure
situation I kept my composure better than before.''
Oldcorn got birdies on the front nine at the fifth and eighth holes to
go out in 34. He keep the pressure on his rivals by picking up further
shots at the eleventh and fifteenth.
Tour rookie Robertson has made a flying start after gaining his card
last year at qualifying school, and this was his fifth top-10 finish.
Robertson, from Paisley, collected #33,330 after chalking up five
birdies, the best coming at the 190-yard fourteenth, where his No.2 iron
landed two feet from the pin. ''This has doubled my money this season
and has secured my card for next year. I am proud of myself today,'' he
said.
Brian Davis finished 10 under on his first Tour event -- after having
been sponsored by the event backer D H L. The 20-year-old from Ware,
Hertfordshire, was sent by the company to Florida for evaluation by top
coach Phil Ritson and plays mainly on US mini tours. Davis has been
given glowing reports -- and a place at La Moye -- closing with a 65 for
278.Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
273 -- A Oldcorn 70, 68, 66, 69 (#50,000).
276 -- D Robertson 66, 70, 72, 68 (#33,330).
277 -- P Moloney (Australia) 68, 71, 70, 68; O Karlsson (Sweden) 69,
69, 70, 69 (#16,890 each).
278 -- B Davis 68, 70, 75, 65; R Wessels (S Africa) 69, 68, 74, 67; M
James 71, 69, 70, 68 (#10,733 each).
Other scores included: 287 -- R Drummond 70, 70, 78, 69. 290 -- M
Miller 73, 71, 73, 73; C Cassells 70, 72, 75, 73. 295 -- B Longmuir 72,
71, 77, 75.
* BRIAN Barnes, who turned 50 on June 3 and therefore eligible to play
in senior event, finished joint fourth in the $600,000 Dallas Reunion
Pro-Am with a three-round total of two-under-par 208 oer the 6542-yard
Oak Cliff Country Club course, nine behind runaway winner Tom Wargo.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
197 -- T Wargo 64, 64, 69.
204 -- D Stockton 67, 68, 69; D Eichelberger 66, 68, 70.

EMBATTLED Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken was last night
clinging to his Ministerial post but expected to face growing pressure
today as the arms-to-Iran affair took two more remarkable twists.
Senior Ministry of Defence police officers admitted they had
temporarily ''mislaid'' documents about the company BMARC, of which Mr
Aitken was a director, and which allegedly broke a weapons embargo.
Labour said it was ''astonishing'' that such papers had been lost,
causing Parliament to be misled. The former chairman of BMARC's parent
company claimed the move signified that MoD police had decided not to be
''fall guys'' in the Aitken affair.
Meanwhile, it also emerged yesterday that one of Mr Aitken's public
relations advisers had unwittingly sent a fax to a member of the public.
The confidential memo to Mr Aitken from 26-year-old Scot Mr Patrick
Robertson includes the line: ''I completely understand your primary
concern, which is that one more bad story will break the camel's back.''
His advice was accidentally sent to the wrong number in London and the
owner of the fax machine passed it to the media.
Mr Aitken, who has previously signalled his intention to tackle the
press with ''the sword of truth'', was last night maintaining a
diplomatic silence on the latest developments.
A three-hour Commons debate on the affair this afternoon, initiated by
Labour, is expected to add to the pressure on Mr Aitken.
Earlier yesterday, Defence Ministry police said in a statement they
deeply regretted that Ministers were ''inadvertently and wrong advised''
to tell Parliament that all documents the police had possessed had been
returned to their owners.
Police also ''much regretted'' that Sir Richard Scott's inquiry into
illegal arms exports was ''inadvertently misled'' over the matter.
The papers, which were originally seized by officers during an
investigation into corruption at BMARC, had surfaced only in the past
few days. They had been mislaid when the MoD police HQ and the fraud
squad moved from central London to Essex, said police.
A spokesman added: ''It is a cock-up on our part,'' while the deputy
chief constable of MoD police, Mr Tony Comben, said he had ordered an
immediate inquiry.
Labour trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said: ''It is
astonishing beyond the bounds of belief that these documents should
suddenly come up at this particular juncture. They are absolutely key to
the extent of BMARC's trade in arms.''
The embarrassing admission came at the end of a week which saw the
President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, disclose to MPs
that BMARC may have illegally supplied naval guns to Iran.
Mr Aitken was a non-executive director of the Grantham-based firm for
two years from 1988 to 1990, during which time some weapons were
allegedly shipped to Iran via Singapore. He has denied any knowledge of
the trade.
Mr Gerald James, the former chairman of Astra, BMARC's parent company,
said he was ''very interested'' to know what the mislaid papers were,
adding: ''If these new documents are some of the sales documents, they
could be devastating.
''They will demonstrate that the company was selling weapons,
ammunition, and tooling illegally to countries like Iraq and Iran but
the company was doing it with the full blessing of the Government,'' he
told BBC Radio.
He dismissed the MoD explanation of the find as ''quite farcical'' and
claimed the defence police must have decided they were not going to be
''fall guys'' in the affair.
Meanwhile, Mr Robertson, who was born in Edinburgh and dropped out of
Oxford University to set up the Bruges Group of Tory Euro-sceptics,
attempted to deflect attention from Mr Aitken by attacking newspapers
for printing his confidential memo.
He said: ''This is precisely the kind of sleaze that Jonathan Aitken
has been a victim of. For this private letter to end up in Sunday
newspapers describes quite adequately the situation in the country we
live in these days.''
Mr Robertson, PR man for tomorrow's wedding of Pakistan cricketer
Imran Khan and Sir James Goldsmith's daughter, Jemima, said he was not
employed by Mr Aitken but was taking legal advice about the possibility
of suing the papers for breach of copyright.

LANARKSHIRE South set up a semi-final clash this Saturday at Ayr
Northfield with county rivals Lanarkshire West when they took top spot
in the South section of the CIS Insurance Counties Bowls Championship
after a dramatic 115-115 share of the spoils with Ayrshire on Saturday.
Ayrshire went into the match knowing that a victory would give them
top place and, when they hit back from 24 shots down to take a 115-113
lead into the last end of the final match to finish, they looked
favourites to get the result they required.
However, Lanarkshire South's Andrew McIntyre counted a vital double to
give him a 23-19 win over Tommy Woods and earn Lanarkshire the draw they
required for a semi-final spot.
Edinburgh and Leith meet Aberdeen and Kincardine in the other
semi-final.
The former secured victory in the East section with a 155-105 win over
Fife at Lundin Links while Aberdeen and Kincardine, despite losing
117-119 to Highland, still finished two points clear in the North
section after second-placed Northern Counties went down 107-134 to
Buchan at Longside.

week when they lost to West Fife, finished their campaign on a high note

MAIDER Telleria put paid to Scotland's attempt to reach the
semi-finals of the European Nations Women's Hockey Cup in Amsterdam
yesterday by converting a sixteenth-minute penalty which took Olympic
champions Spain through to the play-off for medals along with Germany,
England, and Holland.
This was a bitter pill for the Scots to swallow, particularly as there
were questions raised about the legality of the penalty, given after the
ball ricochetted off the stick of Diane Renilson on to her knee.
Speaking afterwards, Renilson did confess to the ball striking her but
said it hit her ''at least a yard off the line and I'm not certain that
the ball was going into the net.''
Scotland still had sufficient opportunities to level the match. Helen
Walker, one of the successes on the day, got through three times in the
third quarter, but while she had two efforts saved, six minutes after
the interval she elected to pass the ball instead of going for glory.
Two better chances fell three minutes from time. First, a shot from
captain Pauline Robertson was blocked, but the ball broke kindly for
Rhona Simpson, who should have done much better than allow goalkeeper
Maribel De Murguia to make a second save.
One Scottish highlight was a brilliant save on the line by Carrie
Corcoran when Mar Feito looked certain to score. Results:
European Nations Cup. Saturday: Group A -- France 4, Italy 0; Belgium
1, Ireland 2; England 1 Germany 0.
Sunday: Group B -- Scotland 0, Spain 1; Holland 8, Czech Republic 0;
Russia 6, Sweden 0.

SCOTLAND'S Graeme Obree yesterday set the fourth-fastest winning time
in the Isle of Man mountain time trial.
In the opening event of the Manx international week over an unpaced
lap of the island's 37.75-mile TT course, Obree come home in 1hr 28min
19sec to win by more than three minutes.
Matthew Postle, last year's winner, finished fourth behind Zak Carr
and Andrew Roche.
Obree, riding in his new ''Superman'' position with his arms stretched
out in front, broke records for some sections of the course but
struggled in a headwind up a mountain road, where he was only
fourth-fastest behind Carr.

DUTCH internationalist Dennis Bergkamp will join Arsenal this week in
a #7.2m deal.
The 27-year-old striker has agreed a two-year contract which will earn
him #2.4m to move from Inter Milan.
It is a major coup for new Highbury manager Bruce Rioch to have beaten
off opposition from Bayern Munich, Paris St Germain, and Aston Villa to
clinch the biggest transfer in the Gunners' history.
* LAZIO president Sergio Cragnotti has been forced out of office and
to put his club up for sale following bitter demonstrations by the
side's supporters.
The Roman fans took to the streets to demonstrate their feelings after
Cragnotti announced that star asset Giuseppe Signori was being sold to
Parma for #15m to clear of debts.
Signori himself was critical of the move and said he preferred to
remain with Lazio and general manager Dino Zoff also publicly attacked
Cragnotti for the sale.
After two days of near riots, Cragnotti called off the deal, stepped
down as president, and put Lazio on the market.
* AJAX have had an astonishing response to their European Cup success,
with 45,000 season tickets sold for 1996-97 when they move to their new
stadium.
The dramatic increase in interest has apparently caught Ajax unawares
because they must now ask some of their supporters to return their
tickets as, under Dutch football law, 10% of seats must be made
available for visiting fans and already more than 90% of the 50,000
capacity Amsterdam Arena has been sold.
* THE latest attempt to establish soccer as a major sport in America
will be launched next year, with 10 cities committed to running teams.
Called the MLS, short for major league soccer, it will have two
conferences, play-offs and involve clubs from New York, Boston, Chicago,
Ohio, Kansas, Tampa, Washington, San Jose, Denver, and Los Angeles.
Alan Rothenburg, chairman of the US Soccer Federation, said: ''I
expect this to be an opportunity for leading European players to make
new careers here.''
* DIEGO Maradona's move to Santos of Brazil has collapsed because of
his financial demands.
Pele, the owner of the club, took the unusual step of revealing to
fans that Maradona wanted #10m for a 28-month contract as player-coach
when his world ban for drug abuse ends.
''With the poverty which exists in this country,'' Pele explained,
''it would be difficult to justify signing him for this sort of money.''
* TOMISLAV Ivic has voluntarily quit at Fenerbahce to help with the
war effort in his native Croatia.
Ivic, who had been donating half his salary to ease the plight of the
wounded and refugees, said: ''I found it impossible to concentrate on
football when there is so much suffering to my people.''
* BARCELONA clinched a place in next season's UEFA Cup when the
defeated Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in a Spanish League match last night.

Scottish Inter-Club Cup title when they defeated Waverley in a
semi-final yesterday. The Fifers, led by sisters Alison and Fiona Reid,
did not drop a set during their 6-0 victory, and in Sunday's final at
Newlands will take on Cults, whose top pairing of Karen Ross and Vicky
Lakin were undefeated in the 5-3 win over Western.
Four West clubs contested the semi-final stage of the men's event, and
the David Lloyd Club, Renfrew remained on course for a second success
when they beat Giffnock 7-2. Captain Donald Watt, who notched up three
wins with Martin Kilday, revealed that he would be requesting a neutral
venue for the final against Newlands, who beat Broomhill 5-2.
Malcolm Watt combined with beaten finalist Calum McKnight to take
three rubbers for the host team. Results:
Women (semi-finals) -- Dunfermline 6, Waverley 0; Western 3, Cults 5.
Men -- Newlands 5, Broomhill 2; Giffnock 2, David Lloyd Club 7.

Gold Cup Handicap.
Twice successful at Hamilton, the seven-year-old just went down in a
race over a mile-and-three-furlongs at Musselburgh on Friday night,
finishing a short-head second to Missus Murhill.
He will appreciate the step back up to 12 furlongs and can gain swift
compensation.

RIDDICK Bowe retained the World Boxing Organisation heavyweight title
after he knocked out deadly rival Jorge Luis Gonzalez in the sixth round
of their grudge clash in Las Vegas on Saturday.
Gonzalez was near exhaustion when Bowe missed with a jab, and then
threw a looping right that crashed into the side of the 6ft 7in Cuban's
head, flooring him 1min 39sec into the round.
Referee Mills Lane counted Gonzalez out to bring the curtain down on
Bowe's most impressive performance since he won the undisputed world
heavyweight title from Evander Holyfield in 1992.
It was sweet revenge for Bowe. He had been knocked down and beaten by
Gonzalez, who defected from Cuba four years ago, in a Pan-American Games
bout in 1987.
At that time, Gonzalez was a much more experienced amateur than Bowe.
But this time Bowe showed himself to be a much better professional
fighter than his rival and dominated from the opening bell.
''I'm looking forward to this one,'' the champion had said before the
fight. ''I can't wait to hear the big thud.''
The big thud duly came -- thanks to a tremendous right hand -- and it
could be heard at ringside, despite a roar from an estimated crowd of
6500 at the MGM Grand.
Bowe's left hand had earlier pounded Gonzalez into a state of
exhaustion and confusion. The 6ft 5in American landed 99 of 120 left
jabs, several of which visibly shook the challenger.
The American had Gonzalez wobbling with a right hand just over a
minute into the first round and caught him with a one-two combination 30
seconds later. The champion went on to control the second round in
similar fashion.
It was the same story in the third, then Bowe took complete control in
the fourth when Gonzalez was sent reeling across the ring by two
powerful lefts and started bleeding from the mouth.
Bowe hurt his badly tiring challenger once more in the fifth -- this
time with a right -- and then shook him up with several jabs.
At the end of a week that had witnessed bad blood between the two
fighters, the victorious champion said simply: ''I'm sorry for him. I'm
not mad any more.''
Bowe had lost his undisputed crown in a rematch against Holyfield in
1993, but won the WBO title in March by defeating Britain's Herbie Hide.
The champion collected a purse of around #650,000 from the fight, with
Gonzalez earning some #200,000.
Bowe added: ''I knew if I would use my jab he would fold when he did.
I wanted to recapture what I once had. I wanted the people to say
Riddick Bowe was back. I was determined to look good and be sharp.''
Asked if the ill-will he felt toward Bowe affected his performance,
Gonzalez said: ''When you get a lot of hate, sometimes you get too
aggressive. Sometimes it just doesn't work out for you.''
It was Gonzalez's first defeat in 24 professional fights and Bowe
commented: ''He's still an amateur and I proved that.''

TRAINER Jack Berry yesterday all but ruled out the prospect of a clash
this season between leading sprinters Mind Games and Lake Coniston,
likely to be two of the hottest favourites of the meeting at Royal Ascot
this week.
Between them the pair have won most of the top sprint prizes in
Britain to date this term.
But Lake Coniston, winner of the Abernant Stakes and Duke of York
Stakes, is being campaigned over six furlongs and Berry does not want to
try his five-furlong specialist, Mind Games, over the longer trip.
''There is not a lot of point in running him over six furlongs as
there are enough races for him at five,'' the trainer said.
''He is best at around five furlongs and that is where we came unstuck
last season, running him over six in Ireland and in the Gimcrack and
riding him to give him a chance at the trip.''
Mind Games is unbeaten in three races this term, graduating to Pattern
company with victory in the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket and the
Temple Stakes at Sandown on his last two starts.
He gave the trainer his first Royal Ascot victory when he landed the
Norfolk stakes last year and Berry is full of confidence that he can
follow up in Friday's King's Stand Stakes.
''He's flying at the moment and I am very hopeful,'' he said.
''He has done nothing but improve this season, he looks tremendous and
he is going very well.
''If anything else wins at Ascot for us it would be a bonus but he is
the star of our party.
Lake Coniston will be all the rage for Thursday's Cork And Orrery
Stakes.
A spokeswoman for trainer Geoff Lewis said: ''He is in great form and
we are very hopeful.''

HOME-based trainers will make a determined effort to keep the
Edinburgh Gold Cup in Scotland today on the tenth anniversay of the
revival of the race first run in 1817.
Now a handicap for three-year-olds and over, run over a
mile-and-a-half, the #8000 feature race has attracted 11 runners.
Jim Goldie must feel he has as good a chance as anyone of taking the
trophy with Keep Battling, his in-form five-year-old who has won two of
his last three races and who finished a good third to Talented Ting on
Saints and Sinners night at Hamilton.
Donal Nolan's Lord Advocate, who led from start to finish in his two
recent wins at Hamilton, is also in with a chance on a low weight and
with the advantage of Neil Varley's 5lb allowance.
Dick Allan runs King of the Show and Tom Kemp has the bottom weight
Jackmanii, second to Daily Starlight at Hamilton on Thursday in the
Howlet Row Handicap.
Gay Kelleway's three-year-old winner makes the long journey from
Whitcome in Dorset, almost certain to start favourite. He stayed on well
from two furlongs out to win by two-and-a-half lengths and today's extra
furlong shouldn't cause any problems.
Daily Starlight has shown he can tackle Edinburgh's tight bends in the
worst possible conditions.
A month ago he was any easy winner of the Levenhall Median Auction
Stakes when rain made the surface treacherous and the stewards abandoned
the last race because of the dangers.
A confident Kelleway expects to complete the hat trick before the
handicapper puts up the weights.
Others to be considered are Alan Bailey's Killick, who has won over
the distance twice and and Mark Johnston's Jubran a course winner on two
occasions.
Although the big yards in the south will be busy preparing for the
start of Royal Ascot tomorrow some at least have taken the trouble to
send runners to Edinburgh.
The Hayricks Rating Related Maiden Stakes has runners from three
Newmarket yards, -- Mark Prescott's Legal Issue, second to Whatever's
Right at Warwick, Alec Stewart's Raayaat, third at Southwell last time,
and Thomson Jones' Social Register, yet to show any form.
Jack Berry can never be discounted at Edinburgh and his Ganador,
runner-up in an apprentice maiden stakes at Catterick, could give them
all a race.
Mick Channon, who had two big-priced winners at Edinburgh on Friday
night with Giggleswick Girl and Morocco, returns north hoping to win the
EBF Fillies Auction Maiden Stakes for two-year-olds with February, who
kept on under pressure to finish third at Pontefract a week ago.

AL WUJID, a 2000 guineas bargain buy at the Newmarket Sales a year
ago, came good for trainer Tom Dyer when he won a #7500 handicap at York
on Saturday.
A cast-off by his Arab owners after only two runs for Newmarket
trainer Harry Thomson Jones, the four-year-old bay colt had raced eight
times without success.
Second and third in his last two runs at Ayr, Al Wujid (12-1) lined up
with 18 others for the #10,000-added Michael Sobell six-furlong handicap
on Timeform Charity Day.
Carrying eight stones -- 31lb less than top weight Sailormaite -- Al
Wujid was held up by jockey Joe Fanning for a well-judged late run,
coming home a length-and-a-half ahead of Mark Johnston's Profit Release.
Invergowrie-based Dyer, celebrating his first winner of the season on
the Flat, ackowledged that Al Wujid's low draw -- stall 3 -- had been a
definite advantage.
Fanning was aboard at Ayr earlier this month when Al Wujid finished
third in a photo-finish to a seven-furlong handicap, having led a
furlong from home.
After Saturday's race Dyer admitted he had been worried about whether
the six furlongs would be too short.
Al Wujid carries the red and white colours of Mike Flynn, a native of
Liverpool, who has worked in the oil industry in Aberdeen for the past
20 years.
The colt will now be aimed at the Northern Racing Handicap at
Newcastle on Northumberland Plate day next month when Dyer plans to run
Tawafij at the same meeting.
Chief Minister is entered for the Northumberland Plate, but 16 will
have to come out before he gets a run.''I'm preparing him for the race,
just in case,'' said Dyer.
Ayr owners Kenneth Macpherson and his wife, Janis, had a disappointing
day when they saw their three-year-old colt Perryston View beaten for
the first time in five runs.
The winner of the Coral Sprint Handicap at Newmarket two weeks ago
failed to find his usual speed in the William Hill Trophy Handicap, and
finished ninth, behind Bold Effort.
Trainer Peter Calver said he thought the race might have come too soon
after Newmarket and Perryston View will now be given a rest.
Sycamore Lodge, another well-fancied Macpherson-owned horse, also
failed to make the frame in the Cadogan Silver Salver Handicap.
* APPRENTICE Alan Daly received a four-day suspension (June 26 to 29)
from the Bath stewards on Saturday.
Daly passed the post first on Chakalak in the Bonusprint Handicap but
his mount was disqualified and placed second after the local officials
found the jockey guilty of irresponsible riding.
The race was awarded to 7-4 favourite Moonlight Quest, who was
originally beaten a short head.
Apprentice Lee Suthern was suspended for three days after riding
Doodies Pool into eighth place in the GSP Selling Stakes (Handicap) at
Lingfield in the evening.
The stewards found Suthern guilty of excessive use of the whip and
banned him from June 26 to 28 inclusive.

A STEEL band pounded away as Grange Cricket Club brought a momentous
week to a close with a Caribbean flourish on Saturday. Victory at
Stenhousemuir might have seemed a touch mundane after the riches of the
West Indian diet, but it was vital if Grange were to keep within
catching distance of the Ryden East League pace setters, Heriot's.
Graham Hurlbatt took five wickets and Neil Mountjoy three as 'Muir
were restricted to 194, not a bad total in itself but inadequate as
events were to turn out. For the visitors, Alec Davies was in fine
fettle and an elegant undefeated 90, complemented by a solid 62 from
Gordon McGurk, saw them home with six wickets in hand.
Heriot's, meanwhile, maintained their unblemished progress with
victory at Union Park, but they were forcibly reminded of the uneasiness
of the head that wears the crown. Mike Allingham ripped through the
Corstorphine line-up to the tune of seven for 52 as they were dismissed
for 94. Nay bother at a', you might have expected, but what heavy
weather the leaders made of it, seven wickets going down before the
meagre target was achieved.
Carlton were set a more formidable task at Freuchie, Scott Gourlay
having contributed 72 and Ian Gavin 41 to a total of 197. But runs again
from Bryn Lockie (67) and an exhilarating 92 not out from Jim Govan
earned them the points.
The day's biggest total was posted by Watsonians, as Mike Leonard
(84), Kenny Scott (65), and Keith Flannigan (50 not out) all made free
with the Falkland attack at Myreside. The Fifers, however, were not
demoralised and Manoj Parmar's century enabled them to hold out for a
draw.
If anyone was likely to spoil the festivities at Grange, it was
Edinburgh Accies' Peter Flockhart, who hit an enormous 6 clean over the
pavilion, thus threatening GBH to early revellers over the road. Their
match against Royal High generated a fair ration of entertainment as
Accies constructed a winning response to a respectable 205.
Manzoor Elahi held High's effort together with 72 and he was well
supported by Abdul Rehman and Bob Thornton. Willie Tait fell victim to a
cracking slip catch by Stewart Farquharson, but a century partnership
between Flockhart and Donald Sutherland in just 69 minutes set both the
mood and the tempo.
Flockhart hit four 6s and four 4s in his dashing 77 and if High
thought they were back in the frame when eventually he played on, Dave
Loudon quickly disabused them by scorching his first ball to the cover
boundary as casually as if he were practising a chip shot on the
practice ground at his golf club. He and Craig Symons completed an
excellent job with one over in hand.

ROSS Baillie, Scott Fraser, and Andrew Lees gloriously reached the end
of the line in schools athletics on Saturday, when they captured five
titles in the Scottish Schoolboys' championships at Grangemouth.
But this is only the beginning for three of the most outstanding
talents to emerge following the investment by TSB at this level of the
sport.
Eight records fell at Grangemouth, but only one in the girls' event at
Meadowbank, with strong winds denying the prospect of more.
Baillie, from Clydebank High School, won the Eric Liddell Memorial
Trophy for the second successive year, the first athlete in 19 years to
do so, only the sixth ever, and emulating his father, Hugh, who won the
award in 1964.
He took the over-17 110 metres hurdles in 14.6sec -- which, had the
wind gauge been functioning, would almost certainly have stood as a
championship record -- then he won the 200m in 21.6, 0.3sec inside the
18-year-old mark set by Peter Little, but with the wind almost double
the legal limit of two metres per second.
The 17-year-old Baillie, whose sights are on a European junior medal
in Hungary this year, will have significant encouragement in future from
Fraser's company in Glasgow.
Culloden Academy's Fraser is moving south to follow a similar
sports-related course to Baillie, and the pair will train together.
Fraser, who eclipsed one of the indoor records of former European
junior champion Elliot Bunney last year, won the 100m for the fourth
time in five years, clocking 10.8.
Lees took the 15-17 100m and 200m in 10.9 and 21.9, both of which
would have equalled the championship best but for marginally excessive
assistance.
Also among the Liddell contenders were Ken McKeown, the only double
record-breaker, who added 14 centimetres to the under-14 high jump best
with 1.75m, and also won the hurdles; Colin Mackie, who added more than
seven metres to the javelin mark in the same age group, despite throwing
with a stress fracture of the foot; and Richard Singer, who clocked 56.6
to win the 15-17 400m hurdles in a faster time than the senior winner.
The A H Dalrymple award for the most meritorious throws performance
went, for the second successive year, to Graham Allan.
The only record at Meadowbank, in the 1500m, saw Kristina Gormley
retain the premier female award, the Frances Barker Shield, the first
double winner of the trophy since Commonwealth 10,000m champion, Yvonne
Murray, in 1981 and 82.
Gormley, who hopes to study at Loughborough in the autumn, won in
4-38.89 after a close race with Sheila Fairweather (4-39.95), the
national age-group cross-country champion from Holy Cross.
The Mary Erskine woman, 18 next week, improved the record which she
had set herself last year by eight seconds, but Karen Montador must
consider herself harshly treated. Montador, 16 last month, won the 15-17
age group 1500m, after a solo run, in 4-37.21, just four seconds outside
the record set by Murray 14 years ago.
Natalie Hynd, the senior 100m winner (11.95), was inside the
24-year-old championship best of 12.0 set by Sheila Pringle, but the
wind was over the limit. And Lorraine Bell, though inside Ruth Girvin's
seven-year-old 200m record, was similarly thwarted.
Nav Dhaliwal, from the Park School, continued her throws domination
with a double in shot and discus; Emma Kerr (Strathaven Academy) won the
sprint hurdles and high jump; and Kilmarnock twins, Nicola and Sally
Youden, took the flat 400 and one-lap hurdles.
Jennifer Ward, from Queen Anne High, won the 15-17 800m in a faster
time than senior winner Joanne Tonner, and there was a double in shot
and discus from promising Fife thrower Claire Garden.
But the girls' performances were generally less encouraging than those
at Grangemouth. Results (* denotes record):

YORKSHIRE slumped to one of their lowest Sunday League totals
yesterday as Kent stayed in contention for the title at Headingley. The
visitors clinched an 86-run victory to retain second place behind
Glamorgan after having bowled out Yorkshire for just 75 -- only one more
than their lowest total in the 40-over competition.
It could have been worse but for Bradley Parker top-scoring with an
unbeaten 20 and helping to add 37 for their final three wickets after
Yorkshire had slumped to 38 for seven chasing 162. Alan Igglesden
claimed three for 11, Mark Ealham three for 25, and Tim Wren finished
with three for 20.
Glamorgan hung on to top spot after having clinched a 29-run victory
over Middlesex at Colwyn Bay. Set 250, Middlesex looked on course to
upset the leaders with Mike Gatting (50) -- using a runner -- and Keith
Brown (47) putting on 88 in 11 overs.
But needing 35 from the final three overs, Stephen Barwick claimed two
wickets in one over to effectively end Middlesex's chase and finished
with five for 30.
Lancashire completed a limited-overs double over Worcestershire with a
seven-wickets victory at New Road. Chasing 190, Lancashire came home
with eight overs to spare to follow their recent Benson and Hedges Cup
semi-final victory.
A third-wicket stand of 115 in 18 overs between John Crawley and Neil
Fairbrother decided the outcome after Lancashire had been reduced to 24
for two.
Ian Salisbury claimed four for 39 -- his best Sunday display of the
season -- to help Sussex beat Surrey by 10 runs at Horsham. Salisbury
took three wickets in four balls as Surrey, chasing 223 off 37 overs,
slipped to 186 for nine before finishing on 212.
Danny Law top-scored with 39 on his first Sunday appearance in two
seasons as Sussex, boosted by 48 extras, reached 222 for seven, while
another former England player, Mark Lathwell, played a key role in
Somerset's 19-run victory over Derbyshire at Derby.
He hit 55 as Somerset reached 212 for seven before restricting
Derbyshire to 193 for six. Derbyshire lost the game when they managed
only 68 runs from the middle 20 overs and lost four wickets.
Kim Barnett and Dominic Cork put on 63 but spinner Harvey Trump
conceded only 28 runs to halt Derbyshire's run spree. Hampshire lost off
the last ball against Gloucestershire at Bristol despite a century stand
by Robin Smith and Sean Morris.
They put on 119 in 22 overs for the second wicket after
Gloucestershire scored 223 for three but, with five wickets in hand,
Hampshire finished four runs short.
Leicestershire maintained their 100% home Sunday League record with a
10-run victory over Nottinghamshire at Grace Road. Notts, set a target
of 286, just failed to snatch victory and finished on 275 for seven.
Ronnie Irani produced a superb display to set Essex up for a
comfortable 105-run victory over Northamptonshire at Luton. Northants,
still to claim a Sunday League victory, were hit for 50 off 26 balls by
Irani as Essex totalled 216 for six.
And the 23-year-old former Lancashire all-rounder also did his bit
with the ball, removing openers David Capel and Richard Montgomerie as
Northants slumped to 111 all out in reply.

* LESLEY Nicholson put the memory of her British championship
disappointment behind her at Montrose yesterday by winning the Munross
Trophy.
Nicholson carded a one-under-par total of 145 to win the fourth of the
season's Laing the Jeweller Order of Merit events by three strokes from
Alison Gemmill, of Kilmarnock Barassie.
The Lothian golfer, who lost in the quarter-finals of the British
championship at Royal Portrush to eventual winner Julie Hall, laid the
foundations for her success in the morning with a two-under-par 71.
What turned out to be the best round of the tournament gave Nicholson
a two stroke lead over her Kirkcaldy's Katrina Milne going into the
afternoon round, and a 74 was enough to maintain her advantage over
Gemmill, who overtook Milne for second place. Leading totals:
145 -- L Nicholson (Haddington) 71, 74.
148 -- A Gemmill (Kilmarnock Barassie) 74, 74.
150 -- K Milne (Kirkcaldy) 73, 77.
153 -- L Roxburgh (Tain) 77, 76.
154 -- F McKay (Elgin) 81, 73.
156 -- S Wood (Aberdeen Ladies) 80, 76.
157 -- S Alexander (Elgin) 79, 78; H Monaghan (Longniddry) 80, 77; E
Wilson (Elie &amp; Earlsferry) 78, 79; J Baird (Brechin) 82, 75.
158 -- J Harrison (Cruden Bay) 79, 79.
159 -- C Hunter (Deeside) 82, 77; J Pennie (Ellon) 78, 81; K Moggach
(Portlethen) 78, 81; D Carcary (Royal Montrose Ladies) 87, 72.

FIVE matches, five wins. But it was one defeat that had most effect in
the DM Hall Western Union. Leaders Progress Software Clydesdale were
hauled back towards the chasers when they lost for the first time this
season, West of Scotland doing themselves and everyone else a favour.
Clydesdale batted first at Hamilton Crescent, their total of 183-8
dominated by international all-rounder Greig Williamson. He picked up
where he left off against West Indies on Thursday, and even though
handicapped by a damaged arm, he stroked his way to an undefeated 110,
having survived in the 50s when put down by Craig Wright.
The latter, though, was to make amends. Mark Harper looked in good
nick on his way to 30, but first ball back after a rain break, he carved
Aamir Hanif to slip. Skipper Jon Williams anchored the innings, making
72, but from the last over West still needed seven to win.
Wright -- on his way to an invaluable 36 not out -- took a single off
Williamson's first ball. The next delivery found the edge of Mike
Richardson's bat, and found the boundary for good measure. A hurried
single left West requiring just one run from the last three balls.
Williamson produced a dot ball, then another, with the home side
securing a thrilling win by stealing a bye to the 'keeper off the last
ball.
With Clydesdale going down, holders Ayr were able to close on the
leaders following an emphatic 10-wicket victory over Uddingston.
George Reifer (73) and Colin Cruickshank (61) saw Uddingston to a
handy 196-9. However, Ayr's opening pairing of Bruce Patterson and David
Simpson made easy work of the chase.
Only one extra was contributed to Ayr's winning total as Simpson
struck 97, while forgotten Scotland opener Patterson drove eleven 4s on
his way to 100 exactly.
Kilmarnock NK's Asif Mujtaba was another centurion, his chanceless 120
coming off 136 balls as Killie rattled up 215-8 against Poloc. Mujtaba's
efforts, though, were soon cancelled out.
Poloc opened with Sajid Ali and, in tandem with Brian Spence, he added
113 for the second wicket. Sajid fell three short of his ton, touching
Mujtaba to wicketkeeper David McCaig, but an unbroken fourth-wicket
stand of 78 between David Hyndmarch and Keith Sheridan saw Poloc home.
Greenock are now the only unbeaten side in the Union, maintaining that
record by beating Tilbury Pheonix Kelburne by 61 runs at Glenpark.
A four-wicket burst from Roger Telemachus had Greenock toiling on
54-5. Roddy Neill took on the South African pro for a brisk 24, but
Greenock still didn't look as if they would last 50 overs when No.8
David Duthie took guard on 91-6.
Duthie, though, poked and prodded his way to 54 not out, leaving
Kelburne needing 196 to win, and giving his bowlers something to bowl
at. That challenge was taken up by the home attack, and despite 42 from
Telemachus, Mike Sears (4-30) and three apiece from Peter Duthie and Tom
Black secured a local success.
Ferguslie are still looking for improvement after losing on Saturday
to Drumpellier by eight wickets. Stuart Kennedy scored 53, but 144 never
looked a winning total. Saleem Sajjad and Zulphaqar Shahid confirmed
that theory, their third-wicket pairing worth 77, and 25 points to
Drumps.

A DEATH crash driver, who drove for more than four miles on the wrong
side of a motorway, had a history of mental illness, it was revealed
last night.
His girlfriend, who jumped from the car minutes before the head-on
smash, blamed his death on the Government's Care in the Community Scheme
and the lack of monitoring of his condition before the crash.
Police believe Mr Alan Gray, 38, of Weir Court, Edinburgh,
deliberately drove on the wrong side of the M9. His girlfriend Rachel
Mather said he believed he was indestructible.
Motorists had to swerve to avoid the car heading straight towards them
as they travelled east along the M9 near Philipstoun in West Lothian on
Saturday evening.
Ms Mather, 20, described how she was forced to jump out of the car at
a roundabout ten minutes before the fatal crash because she feared for
her life.
She claimed her boyfriend, a former patient at the Royal Edinburgh
Psychiatric Hospital, refused to take medication for his mental illness
and often told people he was incapable of being killed.
Labour MP Robin Cook said it was a very distressing case and one which
should be looked into.
Mr Gray died instantly after his Volkswagen Jetta smashed head-on into
a Citroen coming in the opposite direction.
The occupants of the car he hit, Mr James Scollay, 50, and his wife
Elizabeth, 51, of Wester Broom Drive, Edinburgh, were taken to Edinburgh
Royal Infirmary. Mrs Scollay's condition was described last night as
critical and Mr Scollay as serious but stable. The couple have two sons.
Officers travelling in a police motorway response unit could only
watch helplessly.
Ms Mather said: ''He never ever hit me but I know he could get violent
and sometimes he would just flip.
''I would beg him to go to the doctors or back to the Royal for help
but he would either refuse to go or go to his doctor and tell him
everything was fine. I don't know if he was ever prescribed any pills
for his illness but I certainly never saw him take any.
''He just wouldn't accept he had a problem. Part of his illness was
that he wouldn't accept he was ill and as a result no-one could do
anything. He was a perfect example of a failure of the Care in the
Community Scheme.''
Ms Mather said her boyfriend believed he was indestructible and was
probably driving up the wrong side of the motorway to test his belief.
She said in the hour before his death he had been driving around the
streets of Edinburgh like a maniac.
''I don't think he had any idea what he was doing,'' she said. ''I
kept telling him to drive properly but I could tell he wasn't really
listening.
''He was swerving all over the roads and speeding. There was nothing I
could do so I just dived out the car. I wish now I had gone to someone
for help to stop him but I didn't. I will never forgive myself for
that.''
Ms Mather, who was due to marry Mr Gray later this year, described him
as a loving man who suffered dramatic mood swings.
Superintendent Jim Pride of Lothian and Borders police said it was a
miracle that more people had not been injured in the crash. ''This was a
receipe for disaster from the time he came on at the Newbridge
roundabout and drove four and a half miles.
''The officers in our vehicle could do nothing but watch the tragedy.
They also had to take quick evasive action to avoid crashing into the
wreckage.''
The eastbound carriageway had to be closed early yesterday as police
carried out a study of the crash scene.
A police spokesman said they were appealing to any witnesses to the
accident and for assistance from anyone who had to take evasive action
to avoid the Volkswagen.

AYRSHIRE still wear the yellow jersey in the race for the Caledonian
Scottish Counties championship trophy. But while they drew at home with
West Lothian, the chasing pack of Strathmore, Forfarshire, and Stirling
County all won to reduce the Prestwick side's lead.
There was a tremendous match at Lochside Park, where Strathmore
openers Nigel Hazel and Grant Lawrence produced an opening stand of 105.
This was the basis of the target of 222 for five which Arbroath
attacked.
With Kevin Ritchie producing a superb knock of 103, the game seemed in
the visitors' grasp. But youthful exuberance got the better of
Arbroath's last pair of Kevin Stott and Benjie McGill, the latter
running himself out off the second-last ball looking for a run that was
never there to tie the match.
The Ayrshire-West Lothian clash produced fewer runs but a similarly
enthralling finish. Drew Parsons got Ayrshire's total mounting with his
usual buccaneering approach, but when he went for 30, Ian Beven stepped
in to help himself to five wickets and Ayrshire were in trouble.
Even with a late flourish from Javed Ashraf, Colin Berry, and Andy
Tennant, Ayrshire reached only 137.
West Lothian got off to a flier in reply and Willie Donald was the
batsman of the day with 39 runs. But the visitors, too, found wickets
disappearing.
Even so, the eighth-wicket pairing of Paul Crosse and Peter Orr went
into the last over, bowled by Ashraf, needing five runs for victory. It
all came down to the last ball. Orr swung, looking for 2, missed
completely, and his wicket was shattered.
When Stirling went to the Williamfield wicket they were facing a
Perthshire total of 115. This could have been much more if the visitors'
quality professional, Lal Rajput, had not got out in bizarre fashion.
The scorebook reads bowled, but the ball had reached the wicket via a
series of ricochets with the helmet involved.
On a difficult wicket, home pro Kevin Wealleans held one end together.
The notable knock at the other came from Alan Sievewright, who again
showed that despite his youth he has the necessary mature aggression.
Both Clackmannan and Forfarshire received excellent starts. The
difference proved to be in the middle order -- and Forfarshire's took
their side through to victory.
Having taking six Aberdeenshire wickets, Ashok Malhotra salvaged
Fife's draw by sharing an eighth-wicket unbeaten stand of 53 with Paul
Dornan, who made 4.
* SOUTH of the Border, Lancashire suffered their first championship
defeat of the season on Saturday as Worcestershire triumphed by an
innings and 50 runs at New Road.
Bowled out for 206 in their first innings, Lancashire failed to enjoy
the same success in the field as the home side and needed 282 to make
Worcester bat again. But after resuming on 32 for one, Lancashire were
dismissed for 231 in barely two-and-a-half hours after rain restricted
the morning session to just seven balls.
Rookie paceman Paul Thomas was the hero, taking three wickets on his
home championship debut as Worcestershire atoned for Tuesday's Benson
and Hedges Cup defeat at the hands of Lancashire.
Middlesex are well on course for victory at Colwyn Bay after making
530 in their first innings for a lead of 254. But Glamorgan managed to
avert an innings defeat with a stubborn second-innings batting display,
reaching 258 for five at close, with openers Steve James (84) and Hugh
Morris (66) leading the fightback.
Yorkshire need 123 runs with eight wickets standing to beat Kent at
Headingley after the visitors made 365 when following on.

San Francisco
A TRANSATLANTIC air service from Glasgow is to be withdrawn this
winter because of lack of support from Scottish businessmen.
American Airlines announced yesterday that its Glasgow to Chicago
service will end in October. Flights will resume, however, in May 1996
and a summer-only service is to be maintained for the foreseeable
future.
It had been hoped that the daily service to Chicago, with its wide
connections to North America, would become a year-round service.
Mr Duncan Cameron, the airline's sales manager in Scotland, said that
predicted business over the winter was not sufficient to merit the
service's continuing. When American pulled out of Glasgow last winter,
it was disclosed that its winter service had lost almost #2m.
Mr Cameron added: ''We'd face a substantial loss if we went ahead with
a year-round service, which could threaten the future of the entire
route.
''Obviously, it is a major disappointment to us and I am particularly
disappointed that more business people from other parts of Scotland have
not seen fit to back this direct service.''
Mr Cameron said that many people -- from Edinburgh, for example --
were still choosing to fly to London Heathrow and catch the American
flights from there.
American withdrew the Glasgow service last winter and restarted a
month early in April. So far, its figures are described as ''excellent''
but still not sufficient to maintain the route.
Its withdrawal is the latest in a series of blows for Glasgow Airport.
Last year, American, United, and Northwest Airlines all withdrew
transatlantic services.
The last two are unlikely to return and this winter the transatlantic
market will be served from Glasgow by just British Airways with its
service to New York and Boston and Air Canada with a number of flights
to Toronto.
American is to increase its partnership with British Midland from this
autumn with the introduction of code sharing out of Edinburgh. Complex
Government regulations had held back the partnership but customers from
there will now fly via England with British Midland and enjoy a one-fare
service to US destinations.
Meanwhile, a major boost to Scottish tourism is being predicted for
1997. Mr Ken Walton, director of public relations for Greater Glasgow
Tourist Board, said he hoped to see the number of North American
visitors increase by as much as 20% after a major conference in two
years.
Mr Walton, who has been visiting America with Mr Ferrar to boost
inbound tourism, said Glasgow would host the American Society of Travel
Agents' conference in 1997 and he expected a boost in tourism would
follow.

England 29, New Zealand 45
NEW Zealand have been kidding us all along. In US auto-racing they
call it sand-bagging. You keep just a little bit in reserve to keep the
other guy guessing.
At Newlands in Cape Town yesterday, the All Blacks turned on a truly
awesome display which reduced England to a heap of quivering jelly.
It was to England's eternal credit that in the second half -- long
after the game as a contest was over -- they stuck to their guns and
sought some kind of respectability.
But Sean Fitzpatrick and his men played as well as any All Black side
has ever done.
In the manner of their victory over England they have, too, thrown
down the gauntlet to the Springboks and the final next Saturday at Ellis
Park, Johannesburg, promises to be a dazzling clash between the two
southern hemisphere Titans.
As a unit the All Blacks were fearsome. But Jonah Lomu, the monster on
the wing, gives true meaning to the word.
Put simply, when he is into his stride, he is unstoppable. If this was
boxing the contest would be declared a mis-match.
Lomu, 6ft 5in and 18-stone plus, and capable of running the 100 metres
at just outside even time, ripped England apart. From the first of his
four tries until the last he represented a darkly menacing threat to
which England had no answer.
It might seem a contradiction in terms, given Lomu's try-scoring
performance, but this win was about as far removed from a one-man show
as it is possible to get.
Lomu was the official man of the match -- and there's a surprise --
but plaudits have to be reserved, too, for Zinzan Brooke.
The Auckland No.8, nursing an Achilles strain and eventually
substituted because of a sprained ankle, showed once again why he is
simply the best. Brooke does everything that a back-row forward should
do and then he powers off into another dimension.
He dropped a 45-metre goal with the practiced ease and precision of a
cultured fly-half. And some of his line-kicking (line-kicking?) was out
of the top drawer.
Before this tournament started, the All Blacks' fresh faces, Lomu,
Andrew Mehrtens, Josh Kronfeld, and Glen Osborne, were largely untried
and untested.
Within the space of four weeks they have moulded themselves into a
side which is not yet great -- by comparison with the invincibles which
inhabit the All Black hall of fame -- but is three parts down the road
to becoming so.
There were those of us who thought that England would give the Kiwis a
tough game, even some of us who thought that England could win. How
wrong we were.
The All Blacks got off to the best possible start. It was a dream for
them, and for England it was the realisation of their worst nightmare.
Lomu the bogeyman was real. He was right there in their midst, and in
two minutes and nine seconds he was over.
Right from the kick-off New Zealand brought him into the game. The
ball was recycled and recycled again. Lomu snapped it up, ran over and
through Tony Underwood and Carling before sweeping Catt aside like a
storybook giant swotting flies.
England never recovered from that killer blow. Four minutes later the
second nail was hammered into the English coffin. Little and Osborne
swopped passes and all the while Kronfeld was tracking them like the
fine open-side flanker he is. He was on hand to accept the scoring pass,
Mehrtens converted, and England were on the ropes.
Rob Andrew missed with an easy penalty shot and a drop-goal effort
before New Zealand forged further ahead, Mehrtens kicking the off-side
penalty goal.
Next came Zinzan Valentino Brooke's drop goal. Andrew, who had a
miserable afternoon, missed with another penalty goal and then the
monster came back to taunt England.
Brooke threw out a huge pass from touchline to midfield and Lomu had
the simplest of jobs to power his way in for a try under the posts.
Mehrtens converted.
Two minutes before the interval England managed to get some points on
the board. For once they got that maul of theirs into second gear and
when the All Blacks conceded the penalty Andrew found the range and took
England to the turn with a 22-point deficit.
Within 60 seconds of the restart, Lomu had struck again. Little and
Kronfeld did the spade-work and Jonah was just called in at the last
moment to perform the coup de grace.
England did raise their game somewhat in the second period. Maybe the
All Blacks lost concentration, or maybe they thought the game was won,
but the Englishmen never gave up even when all seemed lost.
Graeme Bachop, who has the sweetest service seen in this tournament,
was next on the score sheet. Brooke picked up at the base of a scrum,
Bachop fed Wilson, who handed on to Osborne, and Bachop was on hand for
the return to canter over the line for the try.
Around the hour mark, England's perseverance began to pay off. To the
delight of their huge support they eschewed the opportunity to earn some
easy penalty points and, instead, went for tries. On two or three
occasions England came close but when the try eventually did come, the
television showed clearly that it should not have been awarded.
Rory Underwood was the scorer but Osborne had tackled him into touch
before the ball was grounded at the corner flag. Andrew stroked the
conversion home and England were on a bit of a roll.
Eight minutes later Will Carling ran in for a sweetly taken try,
gathering his own neat chip and running around Osborne to do so.
Lomu's fourth try came 10 minutes from the end and this one showed
that he does offer more than brute force after all. Displaying great
balance and dexterity for a man of his monster proportions, he handed
off Tony Underwood and jinked inside Catt to run in for the touchdown.
Mehrtens converted.
England were now running every scrap of possession that came their way
-- and it wasn't much -- and Carling's second try came from tap penalty
ball. Andrew converted and, at 42-22, England were looking, at least,
respectable.
Mehrtens kept them in their place with a drop goal and in the first
minute of overtime England had the final word -- but a muted one at that
-- when Underwood went over for his second try. Andrew converted and the
scoreline was afforded a degree of respectability.
But the All Blacks, at long last, have announced their arrival in this
tournament with a performance which oozed class, creative power and, of
course, Lomu.

A TRIO of Scottish and Irish universities are to join forces to meet
the growing demand for Celtic language, history, and culture studies.
The initiative is the first of its kind and will be seen in Scottish
higher education as a marketing coup for Aberdeen University and
Strathclyde University in Glasgow.
They already have academic links with the third institution involved,
Trinity College Dublin. However, formal collaboration, to be signed
shortly, will give Celtic students and researchers many more options.
It confirms that, even in a time of intense competition in the
academic sector, universities can work together.
The disciplines involved include Irish history, Scottish history,
Hiberno-English and Scottish literature, and Irish and Gaelic language
and literature.
Professor Tom Devine, Deputy Principal of Strathclyde University,
said: ''This has not been produced top-down. There has been a
groundswell interest.
''Students and postgraduates will have access to the special strengths
in each of the three institutions.''
Aberdeen University has the biggest Celtic department in Scotland in
terms of student numbers, Trinity College has the best concentration of
talent in Irish history, and Strathclyde has renowned expertise in
Scottish history.
Professor Devine, also director of Strathclyde's research centre in
Scottish history, said: ''We firmly believe there is nothing like this
anywhere else in terms of strength and depth.''
He believes collaboration will tackle the danger of parochialism,
which can come by concentrating study on one country's history,
language, and culture.
''You cannot know what is distinctive about the society you are
primarily interested in unless you compare it with others,'' he said.
''Historically within the British Isles there has been an over-arching
influence of English culture.
''It is important that the other parts of the British Isles develop
their own distinctive academic identity.
''Scotland and Ireland have, to some extent, been marginalised over
time and, until recently, English history was British history. But this
will give a further dynamic to a realistic evaluation of societies other
than England.''
Under the agreement, there will be an exclusive undergraduate exchange
scheme, involving similar numbers of students at each of the
institutions. They could spend all or half of their third year at one of
the other universities.
There will also be joint research projects, one of which is on the
Great Irish Famine, and academic staff exchanges.
The Scottish universities will hope for a spin-off by attracting
postgraduates from America, something which they have found difficult.
Trinity College Dublin, however, is challenged to satisfy the demand
for places from American graduate students.

South Africa,
THERE was an interesting little passage of time in the Scotland versus
All Blacks game that summed up what winning rugby is all about and
exposed just what we lack as a nation at the highest level.
In technique, in ''badness'' -- and in build. It wasn't pretty, it
wasn't nice, but it was effective.
Gavin Hastings was passing the ball to his right-hand side when Jonah
Lomu, a far bigger man than him, catapulted himself into the Scottish
captain's midriff in a coiled tackle position.
As Hastings released the ball, Lomu lifted him off his feet. When the
recipient of the ball clapped hands on it, Lomu was grilling his 19st
into a crushed Gavin's solar plexus on the ground.
As Hastings tried to collect his thoughts and his breath in recovery,
Ian Jones, the fresh-faced New Zealand second rower, started
''sledging'' big Gavin when the lineout gathered around our rather sore
captain.
Jones was determined to make things feel even worse for Hastings and
Scotland. There was ridicule and scorn in the words hurled at Hastings
as he tried to suck in some air.
As I watched all this, a few things went through my head.
Jonah Lomu is a deeply religious young man but here he was tackling
the former captain of the British Lions fractionally late and trying to
hurt him in the cause of New Zealand rugby.
Nobody in Scotland would have been able to tackle like Jonah Lomu at
that particular moment. Our tackling is vastly inferior to the kind of
collisions that other countries are capable of producing.
Again, yesterday, there were the same echoes and I watched Ian Jones
refuse Tony Underwood's help in getting off the floor.
Zinzan Brooke pushed Martin Johnson while he lay on the ground
injured, and Sean Fitzpatrick patted Brian Moore on the head before a
scrum went down. All of which made Will Carling jump out of the way in
rucks when he might normally stay there, and England bottle it, up to a
point.
But then there was what happened at the final whistle, and I watched
the All Blacks like a hawk when it blew at Newlands. They all headed, to
a man, to the English boys to extend a hand of friendship. The game was
over. The game of scaring the opposition on the pitch was over, and now
it was time to stop the game. Time to stop playing the part of being an
All Black.
I've often tried to rationalise just what it is that prevents us from
producing the kind of tackles that demolish opponents and strike fear
into their hearts.
I've often tried to rationalise why we don't have the fake ''badness''
that makes opponents think that they are playing against fearless,
malicious marauders.
You can, in part, explain the tackling with the ''fast twitch'' muscle
fibres of the South Sea Islanders, but that can't be all it is.
It isn't just the other races that tackle hard. Tackling well comes to
those that have a technique worked out. There must be practices to
change our naturally defensive style of tackling -- after all, we seem
to be happy to put a man down on the ground and that's the end of it --
into a more robust, ''tackle for keeps'' mentality.
We need to invent our own style of tackling, we need to develop our
individuals physically with massive weights programmes, and we need to
learn to put on an act on the pitch. A serious act that ends on the
final whistle.
Until that happens, the big boys won't take us seriously.

IT ONCE annoyed me, right outside my window, kids out there in the
park, until I thought about it. For just opposite me is a park,
south-side of Glasgow.
It is a lovely park, very large when you find yourself in the middle
of it. You can't hear traffic or see the spires of churches even, let
alone tenements or high-rise flats. It could be open country.
I used the Queen's Park as a child. There was one side of it known to
adolescents and horribly tumescent boys and awfy randy wee girls as Hill
Sixty. The original Hill Sixty had been a scene of dreadful carnage in
the First World War: well, there was a lot of attacking going on -- and
quite a feat of defending as well -- by the teenagers of the Soo-Side
back in the 1950s on Hill Sixty, I can tell you.
What there wasn't, however, was any football. The Parkies didn't let
you play in the park at all, not anywhere. And then there it was right
outside my window, right in the park. Footy.
I will tell you what horrified me. The young boys were playing soccer
on the hallowed pitches of the municipal bowling greens. Myself a bowler
of, I am afraid, no ability at all, I yet know how much it takes to care
for and tend a bowling rink. And here were these young yobs, clad in
trainers and, for all I know, tackety boots playing across the noble
swards.
I opened up the window and was about to deliver an epithet or two, or
maybe telephone the gendarmes, or clober the wee horrors myself, and
looking at the simple fact that both ends of the rink had been horribly
despoiled and the lawn was sparse and, in fact, this is not the place
for weans to play footy at all, when it came upon me with a blinding
flash. Why not football?
For nobody had played bowls on the municipal green for bloody years.
Indeed, due to the sort of vandalism which kids who don't play anything
at all except truant, the wee, rather splendid pavilion at Queen's Park
had to be demolished. The brats who were enthusiastically ruining the
bowling green were nice, energetic, sporty kids who were enjoying sport,
and quite right, too. Nobody had used those patches of grass for years
and now the weans were, and I'm glad.
Every night, every Saturday and Sunday afternoon, I see these kids out
there, tracksuit tops down for goalposts, playing football. In an age
when most youngsters are inside playing computers or shooting up or
hanging about corners waiting to harass the elderly, we have kids
playing. Football at that.
And they are playing unorganised footy, just the way that I did as a
teenager, just the way that Craig Brown wants and has been trying to
re-inject into the Beautiful Game as his predecessor as Scotland's
manager, Andy Roxburgh, tried as well. Just the way that most people in
the game want and just the way that sports companies like Reebok and
Puma have been attempting to promote, not merely in sportswear but in
football, too.
Excited and enthusiastic kids out playing for fun and not the ribboned
coat, not the cups and medals, not the chance of being signed up for a
senior club at the age of six months, for heaven's sake.
Just the way that this week sees the Cumnock and Doon Valley Soccer
Sevens Tournament with more than 160 teams from under-8s to under-14s
playing from all over the West of Scotland at Broomfield Playing Fields
in Old Cumnock. Next Saturday sees the under-11s, Sunday the under-10s;
at 11 o'clock both days. Be there for fun and football. And the fact
that 1450 boys will take part. But back to the bowling greens across the
road from me in the park.
For the boys who play across the road from me on the bowling greens
can play a bit, believe me. Spared the nonsense of senior football
demands for victory at any cost and the obscenity of high wages for
drivel and profit for shareholders, these kids are playing for
themselves and for the beauty of the game.
I stand at my bay window transfixed for an hour sometimes, watching
the skills these teenagers are displaying. They copy all the moves of
the greats. The Johan Cruyff inside turn -- you know, the one you don't
understand how he did it. The tuck from a high ball that Maradona does
every time the ball comes to him from an impossible angle. The Pele
chest-down and wee quick-step to score just inside the post . . . well,
jaickets. The greedy boy who wants to be Jimmy Johnstone and won't let
the ball go until he's tired it out.
The skills are there, Craig Brown. It is the clubs who tell the boys
not to try ''yon fancy stuff.'' The skills are there out in the streets.
The skills I see every morning from a young boy, not much more than
school-leaving age, exercising his Red Setter dog by dribbling with it,
tantalising his pet with keepie-uppie worthy of a Brazilian prodigy on
Copacabana Beach. (I may say the lad is decent enough, he lets the by
now demented mutt get a touch of the ball from time to time.)
I see these skills from my window and can tell our football managers
and all the Dismal Johnnies of football fans -- the skills are still
there and the weans still have them. The pity is that I can only see
them on the bowling greens outside my window. Not in the football parks.

A 32-YEAR-OLD ward sister died last night after being attacked by a
man shortly after visiting time at Stobhill Hospital on the north side
of Glasgow.
The attack took place in the orthopaedic rehabilitation ward as
alarmed patients and staff looked on in disbelief.
It is believed that she suffered from extensive stab wounds in the
attack in the crowded hospital ward.
Shocked patients, most of them elderly, visitors and staff who
witnessed the attack were moved out of the ward. The victim's family was
immediately informed.
The sister was taken to the hospital's intensive care unit but she
failed to respond to desperate attempts to revive her.
Police confirmed later that a 30-year-old man was in custody in
connection with the death in ward 2a.
Mr Gavin Brown, corporate affairs manager at Stobhill, said: ''A
member of staff was attacked by an unidentified male. She was
immediately taken to intensive care where she received all the necessary
attention and care. Despite these efforts, she failed to respond.''
Late last night, Dr Leslie Honeyman, acting chief executive, said: ''A
violent death of a member of staff in a hospital is enormously
traumatic.
''It affects not only the relatives and friends of the deceased but
all the staff. There is a deep sense of shock throughout Stobhill
Hospital tonight.''
Dr Leslie Honeyman added: ''Everyone here is absolutely horrified --
it's an over-used word but people are just stunned. It was a very
violent attack and obviously very distressing for the onlookers, the
staff, patients and visitors.''
Dr Honeyman stressed that the attacker was neither a staff member,
patient nor anyone visiting a patient.
The motive for the attack was not immediately clear, but it is not
thought to have been connected with the victim's nursing duties.
Dr Honeyman said that to the best of his knowledge nothing similar had
ever happened at the hospital before.
He said that at this stage he did not believe the incident had exposed
any security lapse at the hospital.
''I have no reason to think that there was a security issue involved
at all. Hospitals are hospitals, like people's homes, libraries or other
public places. There's absolutely nothing to suggest that if we had
guards on every door it would have made any difference.''
He said the victim had worked at the hospital for several years and
described her as ''a well-established and well respected member of the
staff''.

WE CAN look forward to some over-the-ball tackles and general dirty
play in Scottish TV's new quiz show, A Game of Two Halves, which begins
a week on Thursday.
The approach and format is not entirely dissimilar to BBC2's popular
and slightly risque Have I Got News For You. The two team captains are
Tony Roper and Denis Law, with Scotsport presenter Jim White in the
middle.
A typical exchange is when Roper throws in, a propos of not a lot,
that former Morton and Celtic favourite Andy Ritchie was known to his
team-mates by the nickname M'bosa. The logic behind the choice of
cognomen escapes Law for almost the entire programme, showing either
he's not as quick as he used to be on the park, or that he had a very
sheltered upbringing.
Andy Goram, appearing as a guest, has to suffer a reference to why he
earned the nickname Silkie. The panelists are shown four photographs --
a Hibs jersey, a Rangers jersey, a Hearts jersey, and a pair of women's
knickers -- and asked to pick the odd one out. The answer, of course, is
that Andy has never worn a Hearts jersey.
White, I am told, emerges from the series as a man with a sense of
honour. Although it could be said that he has taken pastiche to the
point of parody (or vice-versa) and has assumed the persona created for
him by the Only an Excuse sports comedy programme.
A scene is re-enacted from White's own appearance in the tabloid press
when he is presented on air with an orange flute band uniform jacket.
A surprise star performer in the series is Danny McGrain. While the
Celt is fondly remembered as a world-class full back, he could never
have been described as a great communicator, especially with his false
teeth out.
Who knows, we might even get to see the funny side of Jim Farry.
* A BRAVERY Award to junior footballer, Eddie Allan. He was playing
for Largs Thistle against Kilwinning Rangers in the final of the
Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald Cup at Meadow Park, Irvine.
Allan was dismissed from the field for an over-enthusiastic challenge.
As he left the pitch he blessed himself, in full view of the enraged
Kilwinning fans, not once, not twice, but thrice.
Amazingly, he made it to the safety of the dressing-room.
* THIS month's issue of Golf Magazine carries an obituary of Harvey
Penick, the golfing sage and guru to such as Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite.
Born in 1904, Penick was pro for 48 years at Austin, Texas, and for 60
years kept a little red notebook in which he scribbled his thoughts on
golf and life in general. These were published when he was 88 years old
in Harvey Penick's Little Red Book.
Harvey has gone to the great clubhouse in the sky but his name lives
on with his own design of clubs. The issue of Golf Magazine which
carries his obituary also has an advert for the Harvey Penick clubs --
with the slogan ''Take Dead Aim.''
* TOMMY Docherty features prominently, as you might expect, in a new
book, a collection of Quotable Scots. He said of George Best, in an
after-dinner speech: ''George can't be here tonight. He was launching a
ship in Belfast and wouldn't let go of the bottle.'' And on his sad
departure from Manchester United: ''They sacked me as nicely as they
could. One of the nicest sackings I've had.''
* A RESULT from the Inverness amateur football league, as printed in
the Inverness Courier -- DM Hall 0, Dynamo Smithton 11,117. A misprint,
unfortunately. They lost only 7-0.
The DM Hall goalkeeper, incidentally, was one Iain MacDonald,
presenter of Radio Scotland's Summer Sportscene programme and a chap who
is obviously better talking about sport than doing it.

INITIAL joy for trainer Francois Doumen turned to distress yesterday
when his runner, Ubu III, passed the winning post first in the Grand
Steeple Chase de Paris at Auteuil then collapsed and died on the track
while being hosed down after the marathon race, apparently having
suffered a heart attack.
Ubu III, who had just given Doumen his fourth success in the
prestigious event, beat stable-mate Val d'Alene by three lengths, with
Bannkipour third.
Doumen also was represented by former Cheltenham Gold Cup winner The
Fellow, but this one was pulled up.

STEPHEN Gallacher clinched his second tournament victory in as many
weeks at Paisley yesterday in the Scottish Open Amateur Strokeplay
championship and as a result surely cemented his position in the 10-man
Walker Cup side to play America at Royal Porthcrawl in September.
The Bathgate player's cool win, ground out in windy weather, beat West
Linton's Simon Mackenzie by one shot and follows his Tennant Cup success
at Killermont last weekend. It is his fourth triumph of the season,
building on first-place finishes in the Champion of Champions and Lytham
trophies.
The 20-year-old joins his more famous golfing uncle, Bernard, on the
winner's roll of honour -- the Ryder Cup captain having been an
inaugural winner in 1967 at Muirfield. The lad from West Lothian,
though, was quite content to have secured another tee-off time in the
Scottish Open at Carnoustie.
In avenging last season's embarassing disqualification -- the Scotland
cap finished second to David Downie at Letham Grange but signed an
incorrect scorecard -- he relegated St Andrews Links Trophy winner
Graham Rankin to third place.
Visiting Welshman Bradley Dredge caught the eye of the watching Great
Britain and Ireland captain Clive Brown -- surely his sole aim in
travelling so far north to compete -- and he reached the turn in his
final round in five under par before his charge faltered.
British Amateur champion Gordon Sherry, of Kilmarnock Barassie,
secured joint fourth position on a level-par, four-round aggregate with
a two-under-par final round of 69. Leading scores:
282 -- S Gallacher (Bathgate) 69, 74, 69, 70.
283 -- S Mackenzie (West Linton) 74, 70, 71, 68.
284 -- G Rankin (Palacerigg) 68, 72, 71, 73.
285 -- B Dredge (Bryn Meadows) 69, 71, 78, 67; G Sherry (Kilmarnock
Barassie) 70, 72, 74, 69.
286 -- W Bryson (Drumpellier) 68, 73, 76, 69.
287 -- S Young (Inverallochy) 73, 74, 74, 66.
288 -- D Patrick (Mortonhall) 72, 73, 71, 72.
289 -- M Carmichael (Greenock) 67, 80, 73, 69; M Brier (Austria) 69,
76, 72, 72; E Forbes (Nairn) 72, 73, 72, 72.
290 -- D B Howard (Cochrane Castle) 69, 71, 74, 76; S Armstrong (Ratho
Park) 71, 72, 75, 72; A Turnbull (Innerleithen) 71, 71, 73, 75; C Watson
(East Renfrewshire) 69, 76, 71, 74.
291 -- D Summers (Ratho Park) 71, 73, 72, 75; S Knowles (Kingsknowe)
68, 75, 72, 76; M Brooks (Carluke) 77, 73, 75, 66.
292 -- R Beames (Wick) 72, 76, 74, 70.

level-par 34 only to drop a stroke at the par-4 fifteenth, while Aitken
stood poised for an outright victory until he three-putted the last
green. Leading scores:

THE top-of-the-table clash at Mannofield saw Edinburgh beat North by
71 runs to go out on their own at the top of the Royal Bank of Scotland
Quaich table.
The man of the match was Mike Allingham who, in compiling his 81
unbeaten, shared two major partnerships.
First he and Gordon McGurk (57) put on 68 for the third wicket in just
under an hour.
Later, Jim Love was his partner as 64 were added for the fifth wicket.
Edinburgh felt their 221 for seven was enough, and so it proved.
North lost an early wicket -- to Allingham -- before Kevin Ritchie and
George Salmond saw the score up to 61 for two.
Later, John Salmond and Adam Heather revived their prospects, moving
the score from 88-4 to 142-5 in half-an-hour.
Both fell to Jim Govan, who took his four wickets in 13 balls for
seven runs to wrap up North on 150.
Jason Arnberger made a dramatic return to the Quaich in the
Strathclyde West versus South encounter at Meikleriggs.
Recently returned to Scotland, the big Australian was in the South's
line-up as their one permitted overseas professional, and he began where
he left off by hammering 146, which included two 6s and fourteen 4s.
In reply to South's 210 for six, Bruce Patterson and Justin Gayfer
batted steadily to give Strathclyde West a straightforward 10-wicket win
in 44 overs.
Surely the Scottish selectors must be noticing Patterson's nudge. This
was his second unbeaten century in two days and his second involvement
in a 10-wickets win.
At Titwood, the story by contrast was of the nearly-centurions.
As Strathclyde East compiled 238 for three off the Central attack,
Alistair Storie went for 94.
George Reifer moved to 99 with an offside glance for 4, but then
trying the same stroke next ball, he was caught behind.
Central made a bright start to their reply, helped by Mike
Richardson's requiring five overs to find a length. But they were pegged
back by tight bowling from Reifer and Keith Sheridan.
Bruce Russell hammered 37 off 34 deliveries, but on his going, they
ran out of steam, finally succumbing eight short in the last over.

South Africa 19, France 15
KITCH Christie, South Africa's coach, was quite prepared to divulge
all in a feeding frenzy of explanation over his team's winning tactics
against the French.
''You don't beat the French without having ideas,'' he said. ''My
ideas were to use Mark Andrews out of position and trust Andre Joubert's
fitness.
''When I saw the change in the weather I threw all of our tactics out
of the window. I told them to kick everything and trust Joost van der
Westhuizen to break.
''The French got it wrong, in my book. As soon as the weather had
changed they should have brought in Frank Mesnel to partner Phillippe
Sella in the centre. They didn't adapt, but we did.''
King's Park was a swamp after unseasonal torrential rain that delayed
the game by ninety minutes.
France gave away possession 31 times throughout the match, either
through poor kicking by Christophe Deylaud or spilled passes, and
although Pierre Berbezier's side will have retained its admirers with
yet another attempt to play running rugby, the conditions for their game
plan were utterly wrong.
''My team is ready to drink champagne,'' said Berbezier before the
match. Maybe, but the South Africans stuck to biltong and beer, and it
paid off. No wonder the French were in tears.
Another appalling refereeing display from Derek Bevan had most of the
assembled throng dismayed at times, but his ineptness did not affect the
result as much as France's inability to convert time spent camped in
South Africa's territory into points on the scoreboard.
Abdelatif Benazzi came close in the dying moments, but inches short
doesn't count.
France's front row fared well in the scrums, but Andrews was a
lighthouse at the front of the touchlines and South African Ruben Kruger
deserved to be the man on hand to touch down a rolling maul for the only
try of the match.
Behind the two packs van der Westhuizen again looked the most complete
scrum half in the world, Hennie le Roux pulled off two spectacular
tackles -- one on a bemused Sella, who spilled the ball in the process
-- the French were unable to use the tactic of small chips over the
defending backs to make Joubert bend down and tremble over his broken
bones, and only James Small and Chester Williams looked out of sorts.
The streets of South Africa were lit once more by the young and old of
the country in rich celebration. I cannot help but think of Small's
quote at the start of the competition that this whole month is ''. . .
an escape from reality for us. We live in fear of our lives, and we live
protected by burglar alarms and behind bars on our windows . . .''
South Africa is a very strange place, and this win has catapulted a
confused country into a final that could well be another escape into
victory. They certainly escaped against the French.
South Africa -- A Joubert; J Small, J Mulder, H le Roux, C Williams; J
Stransky, J van der Westhuizen; O du Randt, C Roussouw, B Swart, K
Wiese, H Strydom, F Pienaar, R Kruger, M Andrews.
France -- J L Sadourny; E N'Tamack, P Sella, T Lacroix, P Saint-Andre;
C Deylaud, F Galthie; L Armary, J-M Gonzalez, C Califano, O Merle, O
Roumat, A Benazzi, L Cabannes, M Cecillon.
Referee -- D Bevan (Wales).

South Africa's rugby dream -- to
play in the World Cup final -- has come true.
Only four years ago, when the last World Cup was being held in Europe,
South Africa were still ostracised by the international community and
President Nelson Mandela was barely on his way out of jail.
The Springboks are now just one match from their ultimate dream of
recognition as the best rugby nation in the world -- something they have
had to choke on while they watched the rest play two previous World
Cups.
They meet New Zealand next Saturday for rugby's ultimate crown.
There were wild celebrations in Durban and the rest of the country
after the Springboks' 19-15 semi-final victory over France in torrential
rain.
Springbok captain Francois Pienaar said after the match: ''This means
a tremendous deal, but to express it in words is futile.
''We're ecstatic, the whole country is behind us. To have President
Mandela wearing a Springbok hat in a township -- I cannot express what
that means.''
South Africa have won all their matches but have gone through
difficult moments -- including the suspension of two of their players
after a brawl -- since the opening match victory over 1991 champions
Australia.
South Africa were always in front, scoring with a Ruben Kruger try,
four penalties, and a conversion by fly-half Joel Stransky.
France almost scored a match-winning try in the final minute through
Abdel Benazzi but the giant flanker was held back from the Springboks'
line just inches short.
French coach Pierre Berbizier said the difference between the teams
was touch kicking. ''France's kicking was not so good. In such weather
it was very important to master this area.''
But he was full of praise for Thierry Lacroix's place kicking. The
centre missed only one of six kicks, leaving him a point short of Gavin
Hastings' tournament record of 104 points.
The French have one more important match. A win in Thursday's
third-place play-off against England would mean an automatic place in
the 1999 World Cup finals.

FORMER Police Superintendent Willie McDougall, who becomes the new SFA
Chief Security Adviser on July 1, warned Scottish referees yesterday
that they must try to ensure that the game will be free of interference
from the law.
McDougall made the key-note speech at the referees' annual conference
at St Andrews, and afterwards chief executive Jim Farry insisted that
the views expressed represented those of the Association.
''We felt it appropriate that Willie McDougall make the speech because
he can understand the viewpoint of both sides,'' explained Farry.
''Essentially what he said to the referees is the policy of the
association.
''We do not for one moment believe that we are above the law, or that
football is above the law.
''But we hope that by making certain any wrong-doing on the field of
play is punished, and seen to be punished, by the football authorities,
then there will be no police intervention.''
The SFA have been deeply concerned at suggestions of further police
activity following the Duncan Ferguson case. The Everton striker was
found guilty of a head-butting incident involving Raith Rovers defender
John McStay more than a year ago when Ferguson was with Rangers.
I understand that the soccer bosses believe that the Ferguson case
would not have gone to court if the referee had acted during the game.
The official at Ibrox took no action at the time and it was only later
the SFA could make their own moves after a referee supervisor had
highlighted the clash.
Said Farry: ''The message we want to get home to referees is that it
is simply not good enough to say that they missed an incident.
''If the referee does not see something -- and we all know that can
happen -- then the linesmen should be alert enough to see anything
untoward and bring it to the attention of the man in charge.
''We have also been concerned at the number of times spectators appear
to want police to take action against players on the field. It appears
to be a growing trend and it is not a welcome one.
''There seems little doubt that on occasion that this can be caused
through malice, from a feeling of injustice because one particular team
is losing the game.
''So, as well as the referees, we want a message to reach supporters,
too. And we want players and managers to play their part. We don't like
to see professionals trying to land fellow professionals in trouble.''
The SFA hope to push their message through the Players' Union, the
Coaches and Managers' Association, and also the the Federation of
Supporters Clubs.
In the meantime, they will continue their regular meetings with chief
constables. These take place every six months, and Farry insisted: ''We
are aware that we must understand the pressures police can find
themselves under in these circumstances. That was another reason for
asking Willie McDougall to speak today. He has experience of both sides.
''Police on duty at football games have a job to do, which we
recognise. But we do believe that we are capable of keeping our own
house in order.
''If everyone in the game helps us in our efforts then I'm sure we
will be allowed to handle disciplinary matters within the game itself.
''That is what we want.''

<HEADLINE>After a demolition job, Lomu suddenly turns shy.  England have no answer to the Dark Destroyer</HEADLINE>

JONAH Lomu didn't turn up for the post-match interview session. It was
left to New Zealand RWC campaign manager Brian Lochore to explain that
the Dark Destroyer couldn't face the ''furore of the Press.''
After their 45-29 mauling by the All Blacks at Newlands, Cape Town,
yesterday, Will Carling and his side must be wishing that Lomu had gone
into Greta Garbo mode before the Kiwi bus had left the team hotel.
Lomu, a 20-year-old, 18st Christian who plays for God with the sign of
the Cross painted on both his boots, is -- for those unfortunate enough
to have to mark him -- like a bat out of hell.
Short of issuing the poor man so designated with a sledgehammer, there
would seem to be no way in which to impede the progress of the youngster
who has taken the tournament by storm, and whose four tries at Newlands
yesterday will have had the Rugby League and US gridiron recruiting
sergeants beating an even more forceful path to his door.
Awesome, incredible, amazing, fearsome. These were just some of the
adjectives used by England captain Will Carling and manager Jack Rowell
to describe young Jonah.
On TV immediately after the game Carling was even more direct: ''He's
a freak and I wish he would go somewhere else,'' said the English
skipper.
Will didn't see the joke when he was asked what the English plan to
contain Lomu had been and where it had all gone horribly wrong.
''I don't think that's particularly funny,'' he snapped. ''He is an
amazing athlete. We tried to stop him but we couldn't and that is very
sad for us. He is an incredibly powerful and balanced runner and I don't
think there are many people who could stop him.''
Rowell added: ''New Zealand played some sharp powerful rugby and then,
of course, they have that phenomenon on the wing. Someone should have
bought him up before the World Cup.''
There is no doubt that Lomu is a freak, a phenomenon, call him what
you will. He is so far removed from the mainstream that for New Zealand
to play him -- built like a lock with the pace of an Olympic sprinter --
on the wing is almost unfair. Almost. Colin Meads, who has seen most
things that the game of rugby has to offer, has never seen someone like
Lomu before.
Meads was asked if Lomu was, yet, a great player. ''You don't become a
great player in one match or one year but Jonah has a great future.''
The problem for New Zealand rugby is that Lomu's future, in all
likelihood, lies not with the All Blacks but with Rugby League or
American football. Almost certainly he will be gone from the Union ranks
before the tournament dust has settled.
The World Cup has, for him, been a glittering showcase in which to
display his wares. The four tries yesterday will have racked up the
asking price quite nicely, thank you.
New Zealand coach Laurie Mains was quite candid in his summation of
the Lomu phenomenon.
He played for the All Blacks last year against France straight out of
school. He was dropped and almost didn't make the RWC squad.
Mains said: ''We brought him back in because Jonah needed to be
involved with the team culture. We did that at training camps before we
came out here.
''We knew that he was a good player but we just didn't know him well
enough as a person last year to get the best out of him. We just needed
to get inside his head and now I think we are getting somewhere near the
best.''
England were bitterly disappointed by their defeat, and especially in
the manner of it. They genuinely believed that they could beat the All
Blacks but it all went horribly, horribly wrong.
Rowell added that England never got on to the pace of the game until
well into the second half. This he blamed on the standard of Northern
Hemisphere competition. He said he was not advocating a downgrading of
the Five Nations' tournament but he wanted to see England cast the net
further afield.
''What England have to do is to play regularly against Australia,
South Africa, and New Zealand. Only if we do that then will we know
where we stand in the world.''
However, England could travel to Mars in an effort to expand their
rugby horizons and, even there, it is unlikely that they would come up
against a monster like Lomu.
Yesterday, NZ coach Mains ackowledged the fact that holding on to him
for the future is going to be as tricky as it is for the All Blacks'
opponents to put him on the deck.
''I'm sure our Prime Minister will put up the Crown Jewels so that we
can keep young Jonah,'' said Mains.
Sorry, Laurie, in the current market, stocks in Lomu are going through
the roof. The Crown Jewels wouldn't even get you into the auction.

Atlanta -- just as well, some might say. But hopefully it will see the
real Craig Brown.
Most people's image of canoeing features Eskimos calmly making their
way through the ice, or Hiawatha, that famous Red Indian or rather
Native American, paddling furiously to safety. But white water canoeing
is not for the faint-hearted, it's more of a white-knuckle sport.
Many people, once bitten by a particular sporting bug, make endless
sacrifices to pursue their goals and Craig, 24, from Denny in
Stirlingshire, is no exception. Canoeing has taken precedence over
everything at the moment as he bids to be included in the British team
for America.
In canoe slalom there are three categories: one-man Kayak, one-man
Canadian, and two-man Canadian. Craig is a C1 specialist.
He took up the sport nine years ago and was a member of the Scottish
and British youths' teams from 15 to 18. He had played rugby, cricket,
and football, but canoeing was always going to be his chosen path. His
father John, a teacher at Wallace High School in Stirling, is also a
keen canoeist.
After school came university in Edinburgh, and qualification as a
civil engineer, but Craig returned to the water and was in the
intermediate British team for Under-24s. His commitment to canoeing led
him to decide in November to put his career on hold and he moved to
Nottingham in order to concentrate on his training.
''I was working with Central Regional Council and they gave me six
months off work, and since then they have extended this by another six
months,'' says Craig. He says that, without their support, it's unlikely
he would have taken the plunge into full-time training.
''Facilities for white water canoeing in Scotland are just dire,'' he
says. However, in Nottingham there are outstanding facilities at the
National Watersports Centre at Holme Pierrepont.
Certainly Craig should know, as he trains at the artificial course
there twice a day. The physical and mental strains of his sport are
phenomenal. In his discipline the course is only 800m long, but it is
executed in just two-and-a-half minutes and involves going through
obstacles suspended in the water.
However, his Olympic ambition suffered a setback at the beginning of
May, when the trials for the British team to contest the five World Cup
races and the World Championships were held. He was placed fifth and has
ended up as reserve. Luckily, because of the commitments of the other
team members, he will be able to compete at four World Cup competitions.
But as with many minority sports and their competitors, there is also
the down-side of dedication -- the endless search for finance. Craig
will not receive any subsidy and so he will have to find #1000 just to
compete in the races. Meanwhile, he hopes training at Holme Pierrepont
will pay off as the World Championships will be held there and might
give him the chance of heading for Atlanta.
Since moving to Nottingham, he has kept busy between training with a
variety of odd-jobs, including working in a cinema. Last of The Mohicans
must surely have been an inspiration.
''Nottingham has the largest concentration of paddlers and most of
them are English,'' says Craig. Even at home there's no escaping his
sport. He shares a house with four other dedicated canoeists, including
one who is in the British team. ''There's plenty of friendly rivalry,''
says Craig, ''but it's good to be with others who share a similar
goal.''
When he's not training or doing assorted odd-jobs, Craig can be found
in a local canoeing shop. The owner has been very supportive, with free
equipment and crucial cups of coffee. But the shop has an unfortunate
name: Desperate Measures.
Hopefully, the move to Nottingham hasn't been any kind of desperate
measure and Craig Brown will have more World Cup success than his
footballing namesake.

WHEN Carl Lewis first set foot on the Sacramento track for the US
Track and Field Championships trials, 14 years ago this month, he gave
notice of the advent of a meteoric new star. The 19-year-old won the 100
metres and long jump -- the latter with the then second-biggest legal
jump in history -- a double last previously achieved in 1936 by Jesse
Owens.
Lewis returned this weekend to Sacramento for the same championships.
But the fuel has burned out, and his star went supernova. Although he
scraped into the long jump squad for the World Championships in
Gothenburg, he could finish only sixth in the 100m, and will not run in
a championship at which he has won a record eight golds to add to his
eight Olympic ones.
The US event has reaffirmed the enduring depth of their talent. Other
stars to miss Swedish selection include 400m hurdler Sandra
Farmer-Patrick, one of Sally Gunnell's principal rivals, the World 100m
record-holder, Leroy Burrell, the reigning Olympic and World 400m
hurdles champion, Kevin ''Spiderman'' Young, the Olympic 400m champion
and relay gold medallist, Quincy Watts, and the 1991 World one-lap
champion, Antonio Pettigrew. Olympic 200m champion Mike Marsh qualified
only in the 100m.
The most awesome wins were by Michael Johnson. His forty-first
successive 400m victory, in 43.66, was fourth-fastest ever, and his
wind-assisted 200m win last night, in 19.83, was the joint-eleventh
fastest ever. Marsh was only sixth.
A truck driver's son from Dallas, Johnson seems destined to don the
Lewis mantle as track's superstar. Had he not winged his way
Spitfire-fashion through the line, the world 400m mark, by Butch
Reynolds (who was second), surely would have fallen.
Johnson will attempt what would be a unique World double in
Gothenburg. The IAAF has already changed the Olympic programme
accordingly, to help him there, though not enough for Johnson's liking.
Two-time former Olympic hurdles champion Roger Kingdom won his first
US title since 1990, setting up a Gothenburg rematch with his old rival,
Colin Jackson, who lost for the second time in a week to Florian
Schwarthoff in Germany last night.
The past few days have represented sorry times for Linford Christie --
the death of his mother, Mabel; fraught financial negotiations; and a
retiral announcement -- but they have been little less so for his
arch-rival, Lewis, who is 34 a week on Sunday.
Unlike Christie, he has gone, not on his own terms, but on those of
the US selectors, whose rigid policy is choosing the first three past
the post.
Lewis will be only second reserve for the relay squad, which he has
five times helped set a world record. He did not enter the 200m, but
grabbed a Gothenburg lifeline in the long jump. Lying fifth, he soared
to a windy 8.54 metres last night for second place behind Mike Powell.
If the 35-year-old Christie fulfils his retirement promise, the
Olympics could go ahead without the two greatest sprinters of the past
decade . . . ''like Atlanta without Scarlett and Rhett,'' as one
commentator summarised.
Predictably, Lewis, a millionaire several times over, insists the sand
has not run out on his career after his failure to feature in the
slowest US Championship 100m final since 1984.
Marsh, Maurice Greene, and Dennis Mitchell crossed the line together,
all clocking 10.23sec, a time which would have earned only third in the
Scottish championships once in the past decade, when Elliot Bunney and
Jamie Henderson clocked 10.20 and 10.22 respectively.
More than anything, however, the result is a commentary on how far
Lewis has fallen, and how little Christie has to fear. John Drummond,
who beat him once last year, finished fourth (10.26), and Burrell fifth
(10.31). Lewis was sixth in 10.32.
Lewis's camp image -- best epitomised when he featured in stiletto
heels in an advert for tyres -- has alienated him from the American
public. Yet he was greeted, ironically, with genuine affection when he
reached the blocks for his execution.
When I first interviewed Lewis, immediately following his 1981 US
championship double, he was a gauche, likeable young man. He described
the event as his coming-out party, and politely said he had no plans to
compete in Britain. ''No, I'm going to London -- say, is that Britain?''
Lewis has now lost the place on the track, and even if he is not yet
the pits in the long jump, should quit the track now, and leave us the
memory of the greatest sprinter ever.
And Christie? I believe the weekend's results in Sacramento make it
even more likely that the man who deposed Lewis as the world's greatest
sprinter will stay on to mount an Olympic challenge next year. US
