JOE DONNELLY plans a close encounter with Intersection WorldCon, the
53rd international Sci-Fi convention, going where it has never gone
before -- Glasgow's SECC.
IT WILL be the biggest thing, for science fiction fans, since the
proverbial sliced bread. It's WorldCon, the Global Sci-Fi Convention.
For five days, starting this Thursday, future freaks will take over
the SECC to celebrate the best -- and sometimes the worst -- of science
fiction in a gathering which will attract enthusiasts from all over the
world to Glasgow to meet their heroes, some of them to dress up, and all
of them to venerate futurama.
Science fiction meets science fact at this WorldCon, known this year
as Intersection, the 53rd World Convention, and the first-ever held in
Scotland. More than 5000 people are expected to stump up considerable
amounts of cash to attend each day of the event and for all of them, it
will be worth it.
To the uninitiated and non-fans, science fiction is weird, different,
a magnet for loony-tunes and trekkies. It is all of that and it's much,
much more.
While this is Scotland's first invitation to the world, the roots of
Sci-Fi are based firmly here. Robert Louis Stevenson mixed science and
horror in his tale of Jekyll and Hyde. Eric Blair, Orwell of 1984 fame,
wrote science fiction on a Scottish Island. Closer to the present,
before we look at the future, Scots writer Iain Banks whose
science-fiction books are consistent best-sellers will be among the many
writers at this year's big event.
While it's the first world convention, Scotland has in the past been
to the fore in celebrating the genre. We've produced some of the best
scientists, some of the best writers, and had a few good SF shows along
the way.
In 1980 EasterCon was held in the Albany and several summer AlbaCons
which were the largest British conventions, attracting almost 1000 to
each event. In 1979, top writer Bob Shaw was guest of honour at
Glasgow's second gathering. He's been back plenty of times and admits to
feeling at home in a city where the pubs stock 180 different whiskies.
Glasgow has been host also to HitcherCon, devoted to Hitch-Hikers
Guide to the Galaxy and many another science fiction convocation
including FairCon, back in 1978, named for its coincidence with the
Glasgow Fair, and a sort of futuristic trip Up The Watter to get the
Trekkies out of the way.
Science fiction is a broad and universal church, spanning galaxies of
interest, drawing worshippers from all walks of life with its own
peculiar gravity.
WorldCon will welcome some of the great writers. Samuel R Delaney, one
of the most-respected science-fiction authors in the past 30 years is
among the guests of honour, for his contribution to the enjoyment of
many thousands, if not millions of people.
Another honoured guest will be Gerry Anderson, veteran answer to the
pub quiz show question: ''Who created the cult TV shows Thunderbirds and
Captain Scarlet?''
Wooden puppets might seem a long way away from science fiction, but
Gerry Anderson's contribution is huge. He developed the techniques of
''supermarionation'' that also brought Fireball XL5 and Stingray to kids
who would graduate to Dr Who, Blake's 7 and then mainstream SF. But for
Anderson, Lucas's classic Star Wars series might never have been
screened.
For those who consider science fiction to be downmarket and trashy in
either literature or films, yes, indeed it can be. But the best of the
best of movie effects are purely and simply the result of years of
experimental work on future fiction and the soaring imaginations of
science freaks. The inside of Dr Who's Tardis took every viewer's breath
away back in 1963. The inside of the grounded space-ship in Alien did
the same for audiences world-wide.
Les Edwards, another guest of honour, is a visionary of the visual in
SF, described as Britain's foremost purveyor of the twisted and insane,
whose work adorns book jackets, album covers, magazine ads, and posters.
He is an icon among the icon makers of science and dark fantasy.
With Anderson, Delaney and Edwards will be Robert Silverberg -- a
writer who uses vast planetary and intellectual canvases for huge works,
the aforementioned Iain Banks, and Terry Pratchett, creator of Discworld
a planet borne on the back of four elephants standing on the back of a
turtle swimming through space. You have to read this to appreciate it
and if you do, you probably will. Terry is a big name in science
fun-fantasy. Fans will get to meet him along with the other big names,
and the little names in the five-day overdose.
According to the organisers, there are more than 500 scheduled events
including talks, panels, films and videos, workshops, readings, games
and something described as ''extravaganzas''. Science fiction of all
mediums will be covered, from comics to television, art and costume.
Colin Harris, literary programme editor for WorldCon tells us this
convention is only the fourth such event to be held in Europe since the
first convention was held in New York back in 1939.
''We got a modest grant from the Scottish Tourist Board to help us
stage the event. The convention itself does not make money.''
Because of that, unlike the Modern Homes or Motor Show which are
merely showcases for the big sell, the entry to WorldCon is on a
galactic scale. Membership for the entire event is #100 and a two-day
ticket is #50. Fans can chose day admissions at #20 or #30 depending on
the days they choose.
''There's more than 5000 people participating in the programme,''
Colin Harris adds, and every day there's about 20 things going on at
once, including three parallel-video showings, a film theatre showing
science fiction of course, along with fantasy and related concepts.
''Alongside the fiction will be science fact. A great many real
scientists love the fiction elements and there will be a number of talks
from people from NASA, discussions about space stations and astronomy.
Hopefully we will have a real piece of moon rock on display.
''The five days will be busy, if not frantic, but the whole thing is
run by amateurs for fans. It's not just for nerds with anoraks, which is
how some people think of science fiction fans.''
Some, but not all. Few Scots can have avoided science fiction at the
movies, whether the recent Judge Dredd, Batman, Superman or Terminator.
Everybody knows Dr Who and has heard of Quatermass. Ridley Scott's Blade
Runner is an acclaimed classic, as is Kubrik's version of Arthur C
Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Not all nerds in anoraks. Some of the fans like to dress a little more
stylishly.
On the third night, this Saturday, the global fans will be at their
brightest in the masquerade which is now a major feature of WorldCon.
The Masquerade is an extravaganza where fans will present themselves as
characters or creatures from science fiction. They take this seriously,
to the extent that no flash photography will be permitted.
Although the masquerade itself is a major event, not everyone wants to
dress up. Almost everyone, however will have a keen interest in the
outcome of the Hugo awards which take place on the Sunday night, the
42nd ceremony in WorldCon history.
This is where the fans get the opportunity to pay tribute to their own
favourite writers, and is possibly one of the most democratic genre
awards in the world and one where politics and tactical voting have no
place. Basically the fans decide who the winners will be and the holder
of a Hugo will consider it the equivalent of an Oscar. In science
fiction terms, it's galactic.
Hugos will be awarded for the best novel, novella, novelette, short
story, artist and dramatic production among other categories. On Hugo
night, according to tradition, if there ever can be such a thing in
science fiction, dress is formal. Fans, however, have the choice of any
cultural formality, whether human, Klingon or other, or from any point
in known or imagined space.
To help spread the word, Channel 4 will be marking the occasion for
those who cannot attend, with a weekend extravaganza of science fiction.
WorldCon's organisers tell us that C4 will also be broadcasting live
from the SECC as the convention progresses, filmed by Wark/Clements
(husband Alan) productions. If the serious and respected Kirsty Wark is
involved in science fiction, then surely it must be gaining in
respectability, just as it should.
You can almost imagine her saying: ''There's life Alan  . . but not as
we know it.''

With more Danish culture to come, Clare Henry finds a Festival
extravaganza of art and craft an ideal introduction.
FINN ANDERSEN, director of the Danish Cultural Institute, has spent
four years putting together a top-class presentation of Danish art for
the Edinburgh Festival. ''It's the biggest Danish show ever in Britain.
It started with a small focus but gradually spread into the Golden Age
(1800-1850) as well as contemporary work, plus crafts as well. I'm very
pleased with it.''
It's perfect timing too. Copenhagen is revving up for European City of
Culture next year. It's well aware of the impact Glasgow made in 1990,
so too Antwerp, but hopes to outdo both. In 1996 (which is also UK Year
of the Visual Arts) it presents a spring festival devoted to the Golden
Age with six key exhibitions, one of which will travel both to the
Edinburgh and London national galleries, then Washington.
Other highlights of Copenhagen 1996 include a new museum of modern
art, a new Centre of the Moving Image, an extension to the National
Museum, for its twentieth-century art collection, and to the Carlsberg
Glyptotheque.
Big-name exhibitions include Rembrandt. Picasso, Impressionism, Emil
Nolde, Per Kirkeby, Asger Jorn, Tapies. There's a Fax Art Week and,
co-curated by Edinburgh's Paul Nesbitt, Art Across the Oceans with new
work from 96 ports around the world. Nesbitt is responsible for the
North Sea. New York's famous Whitney Biennale will also be seen in
Europe for the first time.
Art Nouveau of the Danube Dynasty (with work from Vienna, Budapest,
Prague, and Krakov), organised by Bente Scavenius, will be followed in
1999 by another more comprehensive art nouveau show to include Brussels
and Glasgow. It would be great if this certainly popular show could come
to Glasgow too.
The title of the Danish Festival show, at Edinburgh City Art Centre,
is specific, if a mouthful -- From The Golden Age To The Present Day:
Two Centuries Of The Art And Craft In Denmark. With the exception of a
few stars, most of us are ignorant of the work of foreign artists and
find such shows difficult.
The easiest way to tackle these four floors of Danish art is to start
at the top. Here you find an array of gentle landscapes flooded with
golden light; the sort of light we are currently enjoying but a light
more usually associated with Italy. Right enough -- for the foundations
of the Golden Age were laid in Rome in 1815 when the young Christoffer
Eckersberg painted the Roman campagna in loving detail, outdoors, on the
spot.
On his return he was appointed professor at the Danish Royal Academy.
His teaching exerted a calming influence for the next 30 years, creating
a distinct Danish school. The landscapes are flat and gentle, no violent
forests or mountains, no brooding twilight. It makes for attractive,
undemanding pictures painted with smooth brushstrokes.
Ironically the great flowering of the Golden Age took place during an
economic crisis, which obviously narrowed artists' horizons to everyday
scenes, families at home, nearby villages. This did nothing to hamper
Christen Kobke, without question Denmark's most important
nineteenth-century painter, whose intuitive sense of composition could
make much of a view by a bridge or field.
Thorwaldsen, Denmark's best-known classical sculptor, is missing from
this show but his impressive marble portrait of Sir Walter Scott can be
seen in The Three Graces show at the National Gallery.
In the 1830s the promotion of Danish nationalism provided a boost for
landscape painting, with a move to more romantic scenes, especially of
Jutland, the ''Scotland'' of Denmark. Vermehren's Jutland Shepherd on
the Moors with his three knitting needles and wool pinned to his jerkin
is typical.
By the mid-1870s Denmark's artistic isolation had become evident and
some artists left for France. Others like Archer, Kroyer, and Johansen
went north to Skagen, where the sea and sky provide a unique and
luminous light, producing some of the most delightful oils here.
As ever the Academy was reactionary and rejected this new work. The
Independent Exhibition began as an alternative in 1891 and became an
important force, sometimes inviting foreign artists to exhibit. In 1893
it asked Gauguin and Van Gogh, another year the Glasgow Boys. Kroyer has
been compared with Guthrie; the artists colony at Skagen to the Glasgow
Boys working in Kirkcudbright. Some Danes went to Pont Aven in Brittany
to paint, others like Hammershoi followed a Whistlerian style.
The lower floor covers twentieth-century modernists, some surreal,
others expressionist. The Cobra Group is well represented, rightly so as
Jorn was central to its development. (William Gear, the Scottish painter
who celebrated his 80th bithday recently, was also a Cobra member.) I
also enjoyed the stylised sculpture of Sonja Mancoba.
Contemporary work, which I found disappointing, is in the basement.
Danish design has long been a by-word for excellence, and the ground
floor at the city art centre rightly flaunts superb silver, ceramics,
and glass. It's selected by Bjorn Andersen, himself a stylish
silversmith who served his apprenticeship with the great Georg Jensen,
whose 1912 brooches and bracelets are upstairs. Anderson has had his own
workshop since 1935 and shows jug and tumblers together with Dahlerup
and Sax Moller. Glass is elegant or, in the case of Sodring's tipsy
glasses, witty. Huge ceramics by Weiss sit beside textiles, rugs, and
even bookbinding from the Royal Library. An impressive display.
To complete the city-wide extravaganza, Morgens Andersen, now 80 and
one of the pioneers of Danish abstraction, shows dark, gestural,
swirling paintings from over half a century at the Danish Cultural
Institute in Doune Terrace.
We will certainly hear more about Danish art next year, so this is an
ideal introduction. Denmark and Scotland are exactly the same size,
(population 5,200,000) and with Glasgow UK City of Architecture and
Design 1999 on the horizon, what will we be offering the world? It is a
question on everyone's lips.

SAC's mission is to ''enhance the sustainability of rural areas and
communities and the viability of the industries on which they depend.''
This is achieved through three main roles -- advanced education and
training, research and development and advisory and consultancy
services.
All three activities have grown considerably since the present SAC was
formed in 1990 by the amalgamation of the three regional agricultural
colleges in Scotland. As a result, most people who know of SAC are aware
of just a small part of the organisation's enormous range of activities
in the broad areas of food, land and the environment. With 1300 staff
and thousands of clients worldwide, SAC is one of the largest
organisations of its type in Europe.
Students embarking on higher education are faced with a bewildering
choice: most institutions offer similar courses and it may be difficult
to choose between them.
SAC stands out from the rest because it is a specialised college with
vocational courses developed with particular jobs in mind.
This specialisation is one of the SAC's great strengths. As the
economy and employment patterens have changed, we have diversified and
now offer more than 40 courses, dealing with agriculture, horticulture,
science and technology, rural business management, conservation and
rural resource management, leisure and tourism, food manufacture,
aquaculture, environmental protection and poultry.
This specialised educational role is complemented by the wide-ranging
research and development programme and an increasingly successful
advisory and consultancy service. Collectively, this is what makes SAC
unique in the world of higher education.
The students are taught by experts who provide up-to-the-minute
information and insights and who are in touch with the commercial world
beyond the College.
Dr Andrew Walker is attached to the Education and Training Support
Unit at SAC, Auchincruive.

<HEADLINE>NatWest team tracks 25 trusts against special 'inertia index'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN CLAY</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976781317</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
INERTIA is something which comes naturally enough to a lot of us
particularly during the current long hot summer. It is not, of course,
something which many investors would be inclined to encourage in
investment fund managers.
Dealing, however, costs money even if competition from the dreaded
Tradepoint makes it cheaper. We have all heard criticisms of the
stockbroker manager who (obviously in the bad old days only) churned a
client's portfolio to generate commission or the hyperactive fund
manager who would have produced a better performance if he had
disconnected his telephone for a while.
So there has to be some value in investigating the value of activity
as opposed to inertia. This is not a simple problem to crack but
fortunately it is being done for us by the investment trust team at
NatWest Securites.
It has been looking at the 25 largest diversified trusts, including
income growth specialists to see how they perform against a specially
constructed ''inertia index''.
It is an interesting exercise although confined to measuring the
effectiveness of tactics rather than strategies.
As the analysts point out the overall net asset performance of a trust
is produced by a combination of strategy ''being in the right place at
the right time'' and tactics which they define as ''making the right
changes to the portfolio at the geographical and/or stock level''.
The ''inertia index'' approach seeks to isolate the effects of
tactical changes. To achieve a sensible measurement -- each one
individual to each trust -- the analysts looked at the trust's
geographic arrangement of its assets and related each proportion to the
recognised market index for that area.
Taking that as the ''inertia index'' and comparing the result with the
actual figures produced by the trust they could then see as closely as
practically possible how the trusts assets would have performed if the
mangers had reached for pipe and slippers and sat back well satisfied
with their selections resisting all temptations to switch between stocks
and simply let the effects of geographical strategy come through.
As the analysts point out, these comparisions ''tell us nothing about
how good or bad a trust's strategy was at the start of the period under
examination.''
That is something which the past 12 months have demonstrated is pretty
crucial but the study does show whether given the trust's chosen
strategy at the start of the period its managers were able to add value
both through initial stock selection and through making subsequent
tactical changes to the portfolio. In other words one might say did they
beat the index trackers?
It is quite possible for a trust to produce above average asset value
in a given period even if it is under-performing its ''inertia index''.
When this happens it shows that the strategy at the start of the period
was good but that its shares selections -- initial and subsequent
changes -- diluted the effect of the strategy.
Equally it is possible for a trust to show below average asset
performance even while out-performing its ''inertia index''. This sort
of result indicates that although the strategy was not good the managers
were able to add value by the selection of shares in the portfolio both
at the start of the period and by their day to day management after
that.
NatWest's recent report on inertia analysis said the dominated factor
affecting portfolio performance over the past 12 months ''has
undoubtedly been the relative weightings within the US and Japan.''
Reporting at the end of last month, they said North America rose 22%
in the 12 months against a fall of 17% in Japan and this influenced
portfolio performances significantly. English &amp; Scottish and the two
Alliance trusts benefited from their weightings in the United States
while Dunedin Worldwide, Overseas and Kleinwort Overseas suffered from
their exposure to the Japanese economy which is still in recession.
Looking back over the year, 23 of the 25 trusts increased the value of
their portfolios on a total performance basis.
On the inertia analysis, English &amp; Scottish leads in added value over
one, three and five years. The report commented: ''English &amp; Scottish
produced an incredible 10% net asset value total return over the last
quarter helping them to out-perform their inertia benchmark by 5% over
the one year period.''
Looking ahead on an actual performance basis the analysts say ''the
outlook for this group of trust looks encouraging.
''The US appears to have avoided crash landing while Japan has hinted
that it may be ready to turn following the easing of short-term interest
rates.
''The UK also looks set for a period of economic stability now that
political worries have receded. The prospects for this group look good
offering widespread exposure to both the UK and in many cases overseas
markets through UK listed companies.''
So maybe investors should adopt the inertia approach and leave it all
to the big general trusts.

THIS is a light week for fresh economic statistics after last week's
bonanza, which provided a mixed bag of encouraging growth in retail
sales, unchanged annual inflation rates, and the first rise in
seasonally adjusted unemployment for nearly two years.
Publication of the output, income, and expenditure figures for the
second quarter, later today, will tell us whether the Central
Statistical Office makes any revisions to the provisional gross domestic
products figures issued last month.
These figures showed that total GDP grew by 0.6% in the quarter and
onshore GDP, excluding oil and gas extraction, by 0.7%. There is some
speculation that the onshore growth rate will be revised up to 0.8%
because of the relative strength of manufacturing in the industrial
production figures.
Also today, the non-EU trade figures are expected to show that the
deficit for July has fallen to about #600m. Later in the week the CBI
survey will be studied for trends in orders and output and the price
expectations of manufacturers.

THAT old Border reiver spirit helped Kelso plunder the spoils at their
own seven-a-side tournament, teamwork and a never-say-die attitude
proving just enough to see off more fancied rivals.
This was a six-hour rugby extravaganza played under an energy-sapping
sun but on a lush, green pasture which had been treated to good watering
every night of the past week, courtesy of the local fire brigade.
There may be hose-pipe bans elsewhere, but in the Borders they like to
get their priorities right. The four semi-finalists -- Stirling County,
Gala, Kelso, and West Hartlepool -- were the pick of the 16 contestants
and -- it is not always the case -- deserved their passage through to
the final stages.
Stirling County, despite a propensity for allowing scoring chances to
go a-begging, looked as sharp as Scottish champions should, and in young
Gareth Flockhart they had one of the players of the tournament.
They returned home with the runners-up medals but three jerseys short,
some light-fingered miscreant having taking a fancy to the champions'
new Carlsberg strip.
Gala meanwhile, with the Dalgleish boys, Moncrieff, and Neil Crooks in
fine form, somewhat prematurely sported McEwan's logos on their jerseys.
An announcement on the Netherdale side's new sponsor is not due for a
week or so yet.
West Hartlepool, it has to be said, had looked the class act of the
tournament. Jim Williams, their sevens exponent from Australia, with two
Hong Kong appearances for the Wallabies under his belt, was a bruising
performer in the pack, while Scottish internationalist Derrick Patterson
proved that his sojourn with Scotland at the RWC has left him
razor-sharp and ready to maintain his challenge for Scotland's No.9
shirt.
Kelso were a revelation. As skipper Stewart Bennet said, they boasted
no stars, just a group of individuals who worked hard for each other.
Bennet and Adam Roxburgh were the uncompromising foundation on which
Kelso's triumph was built, and with youngsters like Graham Cowe at scrum
half rising to the occasion, it was always going to take a particularly
determined side to beat them.
The hosts' doggedness was never better displayed than in their
semi-final tussle with West Hartlepool. The English side were 12 points
to the good at half-time but fought back through tries by Bennet and
Laing, and Aitchison's conversion, to force the tie into extra time,
when the youngster, Cowe, sneaked a blindside touchdown from a scrum on
the line to put the hosts in the final.
Only three points separated Stirling and Kelso after a riveting and
lung-bursting final, in which the lead changed hands four times and
Stirling at one stage were 12 points in arrears -- tries by MacArthur
and Aitchison, who also had a conversion -- before they forced their way
back into the game through a penalty try which Mark McKenzie converted.
Brian Ireland showed deft footwork before racing in for the equalising
try, and McKenzie kicked Stirling into the lead with the conversion.
Roxburgh put Kelso back in front with a try and then Colin MacRobert
-- a beautifully balanced runner -- scored from deep inside his own
territory. McKenzie goaled and Stirling were four points to the good at
half-time.
Kelso struck back immediately with a Roxburgh try and Aitchison
conversion, but Matt McGrandles -- looking purposeful in midfield -- put
Stirling back in front yet again with a try which McKenzie once again
converted (conversions, incidentally, being of the drop-kick variety as
per the IB's seven-a-side law variation).
With just more than a minute to go, and amid some real harum-scarum
stuff, MacArthur scored Kelso's winning try, and Aitchison converted to
provide the three-point cushion which Stirling, try as they might, could
not overcome. Results:
First round -- Preston Grasshoppers 33, Peebles 0; Stirling County 19,
Melrose 12; Gala 27, Selkirk 12; Wakefield 31, Langholm 7; Newcastle
Gosforth 5, Hawick 22; Kelso 36, Currie 5; Jed-Forest 36, Kelso
President's VII 5; West Hartlepool 29, Alnwick 7.
Second round -- Preston Grasshoppers 0, Stirling County 52; Gala 26,
Wakefield 12; Hawick 7, Kelso 31; Jed-Forest 14, West Hartlepool 48.
Semi-finals -- Stirling County 17, Gala 12 (after extra-time); Kelso
17, West Hartlepool 12 (after extra-time).
Final -- Kelso 31, Stirling County 28.
Kelso -- S Bennet, K Hendry, A Roxburgh, G Cowe, G Aitchison, G Laing,
I Macarthur, P Dunkley, D Baird, R Hogarth.
Stirling County -- G Flockhart, G Mackay, B Ireland, D Elliot, K
Harper, C Sangster, M McKenzie, M McGrandles, R Mailer, C MacRobert.

DEAR Mr McCann,
A few years ago, on the opening day of the football season, The Herald
published an open letter from me to Mr Liam Brady, the new Celtic
manager. That letter proved to be quite prophetic. So it is that with
the kind help of the editor I write in not-dissimilar terms to you. As
in the case of the letter to Mr Brady, the intention is to be helpful.
You are the entrepreneur and I am but the consumer, but we both know,
from commercial experience as much as from economic textbooks, that it
is the decisions of consumers that determine the fate of enterprises and
so that of entrepreneurs.
It is, then, against that background that I write to you about the
acquisition of tickets for games at Parkhead. The key to successful
hotel operation is heads on pillows and backsides on beds. By the same
token you will wish to see every seat taken at every home game, however
puny the opposition. The purpose of this letter is to help you towards
that objective.
As I understand it, the ground capacity for this season is 34,000
(Peter McLean: Herald, 15 July 1995) and that season tickets already
account for 19,000+: let us, then, say that paid-in-advance season
tickets account for a neat 20,000. Of the residual 14,000 I take it that
you will be expected to provide some 5000 or so for visiting supporters,
all of which leaves 9000. No doubt, about half of these tickets will be
distributed through supporters' clubs but all that still leaves some
4000 to 5000 to be sold to the folk who would describe themselves as
supporters but who, for a variety of reasons -- domestic, business,
perhaps personal -- cannot attend games with the regularity of the
earlier categories.
This third column is the element that in former years took attendance
at Parkhead to around 50,000 and did so again and again: it is this same
element which turned up in cup finals. Moreover, the peripheral
commercial importance of this group is substantial.
It is my belief that you and your advisers are in danger of
under-acknowledging -- in extremis of ignoring -- the aspirations of the
third column. Perhaps you did not intend to alienate them, but the
inference is that some of your advisers reckon that ''true'' support
would be season ticket-holders or, at least, members of an affiliated
supporters' club. Such a view takes no cognisance of the wide range of
reasons which prevent them moving towards far less into either of the
first two categories.
The basic point here is that there is an enormous army of the
favourably disposed for you to tap. The question at issue is: Do you
wish them on their terms or are you foolishly going to insist on them
accepting your terms? Are you genuinely anxious to draw on them, and if
so, are you prepared to cater for them and are you prepared to introduce
arrangements which facilitate, which strengthen their linkage to the
club, the team -- and your financial statement?
I pose these questions because during the 1994/95 season that fringe
element, that third force, felt neglected. Traditionally in the days of
paying at the gate they would turn up early and they would fill both the
front and the main stand, and when the stands were full they would
select a section of terracing which they were prepared to accept. For
many of them it was the ''Celtic'' part of the ''Rangers'' end. That is
not semantic nonsense.
Last year many of them were bewildered. Some of them did not know how
to obtain tickets; when they did, they did not find the arrangements
convenient and when they did go to purchase, they were not favourably
impressed by the way they were treated.
Compare the disparate arrangements for those who wish to buy theatre
tickets and those who wish to buy tickets for a run-of-the-mill game at
Parkhead. The potential theatre-goers can go into a ticket office in
town. There they are served by a courteous, helpful lady who advises
them what is available and the different prices. She can and does invite
their attention to a seating plan which enables the purchaser to
evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the seats available,
weighing such considerations against price. Having decided, the tickets
are printed as the financial transaction takes place and the purchaser
goes away feeling he or she has been treated with civility and that the
responsiblity for the purchase lies with the purchaser. It is as near to
consumer sovereignty as any economist could wish. If the purchaser has a
credit card, the entire transaction can be done by telephone.
Contrast that with what happens when one goes to buy tickets for a
Celtic game. It is not a pleasant experience and there is little scope
for consumer choice. If you find this hard to believe, ask your wife to
go in disguise and see what her reaction is. The basic difference is
that the theatre makes it easy for the marginal attender: you do not.
There is one other aspect to all this. The real success of the Rangers
administration is not in the success of the team, nor the splendour of
the stadium, but in the way the management retrieved the third force of
the Rangers' support, particularly the middle-class support.
When attendance at Ibrox was falling below 20,000 the middle-class
were drifting away to other activities. Ian was taking the girls to
their dancing classes. Stuart was playing ''the medal'' in the afternoon
rather than the forenoon, Hamish was sailing, and Gordon was taking
Fiona to the supermarket. The stadium and the club were being left to
somewhat wilder and more irresponsible elements. In the ensuing
tug-of-war for their time and their purchasing power, the Rangers
management made it easy or easier for the disenchanted to come back to
the fold. Not all of them acquired season tickets. Few of them joined
supporters' clubs. But, by all accounts, the club reached out to them
and so facilitated their occasional visits to Ibrox. These visits
increased. Their consumer-behavioural pattern changed, but it changed
because it was wooed. It was cultivated.
There is, of course, more to the third force, particularly your third
force, than the professional and quasi-professional classes, though
their potential purchasing power would appeal to any accountant. It
includes all sort of folk, not least the season ticket-holders,
supporters' club members and others of yesteryear whose purchasing power
is not what it was but who can still rise to the occasional game. It
extends to a wider range of folk who work away from home -- long
distance lorry drivers, men on oil platforms, men and women in the
forces and the like and who, when they are home, would like to see the
team play -- and to people who are at home but who work on shifts which
sweep over weekends.
In writing to Mr Brady, I invited his attention to the Olympic flag. I
would invite your attention to the three-ring RAF symbol. Your ''bull's
eye'' inner ring in the season ticket market and with about 20,000 sold
I trust you are doing well in the short-loan money market. The inner
ring is the supporters' clubs. But the outer peripheral ring takes up
the greatest area. That, Mr McCann, is your marginal market. You have
already won the bull's eye. The second ring is well-nigh there. It is
the third ring that deserves your attention. It is their backsides on
your seats which will determine marginal revenue.
One more thing. The team used to play with panache. Irrespective of
results, could you please ask Mr Burns to have them play with style. He
knows what I mean. He had some himself.

EDINBURGH'S new athletics development officer cannot arrive too soon,
judging by events over the weekend, when the city's male club fortunes
slumped to a new low with Edinburgh Southern dropping to Division 3 of
the British League, and Edinburgh AC placing last in Division 4.
Southern, deserted by several stars whose presence could have saved
the day at Cardiff, went down without a whimper, ending up last in the
final Division-2 match.
Their only winner was Dave Clerihew, who took the long jump with 6.98
metres. The final straw came in the 4 x 100m relay, usually their
strongest event.
Sprint star Jamie Henderson turned out despite a heavy cold, but
failed to hand the baton to the final runner, Jim Watson, who was there
only for the relay. ''I should never have run,'' said Henderson. ''When
I got halfway round the bend I knew there was something seriously wrong,
and I just couldn't catch him.''
Henderson, whose father was once the club's principal backer, predicts
a dismal future unless drastic action is taken: ''It's not going to get
better,'' he said. ''I can't see us staying long in Division 3, yet it's
only two years since we were in Division 1, and comfortably holding our
own.
''But the British League won't worry -- they'll be quite happy to see
us slip away, as the clubs don't want to travel to Scotland . . .
Already all the young Scottish athletes are joining English clubs.''
Capital rivals Edinburgh AC, with whom talks have so far failed to
cement a merger, finished last in division four at Rochester. Though
last overall, they keep their place in the division because of league
re-organisation. Results:
Division 2 (Cardiff). Match result: 1, Sale 277; 2, Swansea 227; 3,
Cardiff 222; 4, Liverpool 218; 5, Crawley 156; 6, ESH 147. Final
placings: 1, Sale 24 points; 2, Cardiff 19; 3, Liverpool 13 (all
promoted); 4, Swansea 12; 5, Crawley 10; 6, ESH 6 (relegated). Division
4 (Rochester). Match result: 1, GEC Avionics 282; 2, Cambridge 237; 3,
Peterborough 208; 4, Team Solent 207; 5, Leeds 160; 6, EAC 155. Final
placings: 1, GEC 20; 2, Team Solent 18; 3, Peterborough 17 (all
promoted); 4, Cambridge 15; 5, Leeds 7; 6, EAC 7.
* WORLD championship runner Melanie Neef stepped down to the sprints
for her club, City of Glasgow, in the final division-one match of the UK
Women's League in Birmingham. She was runner up in the 100m (11.7)
behind British champion Paula Thomas (Trafford, 11.4), but turned the
tables in the 200m, winning in 23.9.
Other Glasgow successes came from Alison Grey (shot, 14.43m), Gillian
Hegney (100m B, 12.1), and Mary McClung (800m, 2-07.6). Sinead Dudgeon
(400m hurdles B, 62.2), and Dawn Flockhart (400 metres B, 54.4) had wins
for Edinburgh Woollen Mill.
Though Glasgow finished fourth in the match -- just two points behind
second-placed Edinburgh -- their consistency throughout the season gave
them second overall. Match result:
1, Sale 181 points; 2, EWM 163; 3, Birchfield 162; 4, CoG 161; 5,
Trafford 149; 6, Essex Ladies 144; 7, Shaftesbury Barnet 122; 8,
Coventry 92. Overall: 1, Sale 21; 2, City of Glasgow 16; 3, EWM 15; 4,
Trafford 14; 5 equal, Essex and Shaftesbury Barnet 13 (both 449 match
points); 7, Birchfield 13 (430 match points); 8, Coventry 3.

DAY ONE
9am: TENSE, nervous, seemingly suffering from Irritable Vowel
Syndrome. Clearly need Oinkment (sorry). Nothing can alleviate growing
sense of doom during final tech-rehearsal. All sound cues seem muffled.
A testament perhaps to night before? I know I shouldn't do it but my
director, Tony Boneza, is an evil man and ''the primrose path of
dalliance is an easy one''. Am given first copy of Ralph Steadman's
brilliantly illustrated new version Animal Farm. Am thrilled.
1.41pm: Thank God (I croak) it's over. Big house -- receptive and
appreciative. The play works! The Financial Times were in -- perhaps my
stocks will rise on the Footsie? Maybe I'll farm the show out -- Ha-ha.
See Diana Ford at Assembly: exquisite comedienne. My face hurts from
laughter. Am relieved to be an animal and not the butt of her humour.
Closed Assembly Bar . . . A great way to start. Director is reading
book on Animal Husbandry. He worries me. Bed 3am.
* DAY TWO
10am: PANIC! Voice is going, quite where I'm not sure. Three- quarters
of my vocal range is no longer available for use and what's left will
require gallons of hot lemon and honey. Timely intervention rescues
performance . . . but from now until September 2, morning cornflakes
will be replaced by a face full of steam. No milk, no coffee, no alcohol
and no closing smoky bars. My director tells me I should try ''Dame
Nellie Melba's Throat Spray'' but there is an evil glint in his eye and
I am sceptical.
Despite voice, show okay. Bigger house. Hot . . . damn hot.
Apparently reviewed three times so far but yet to come to print.
Investigation reveals one major, two minor publications. The latter two;
an obscure law journal and a publication that sounds like a trade paper
for prison wardens. (How did they get press passes?) Heart skips beat
when I consider effect of good reviews from them . . . A house full of
lawyers and prison wardens . . . Hmmmm.
Go to Traverse but miss Ningali by one hour. Smart. Attempt to write
this diary in Trav' bar so I fail. Attend film fest opening bash instead
with female editor of major national newspaper. Complimentary booze
expires moments before our arrival. (Damn freeloaders). Undeterred and
flagrantly disobeying orders, I arrive home at 3am . . . Q: Mistake?
* DAY THREE
A. Yes.
8am: DISTINCTLY suffering. STV recording at 9am is therefore
problematic. Suggest drunken pig sequence but will settle for simple
interview. Somehow the voice seems marginally better. Wish I knew why.
Perhams Animalism is good for it? ''Two drams good, four drams better.''
Relieve (by negotiation) film crew of their copy of Steadman's Animal
Farm and give it to my stage manager. My director is jealous and thus
irritable.
Show all but sold out. Surreal performance. Like watching myself do it
from above. But big cheer at end stymies director's castigation. Hey,
maybe it's better when I'm not really there? FT review in print and it's
okay given acerbic style. Am already rewriting it in my mind's eye,
carefully extracting all superlatives out of context. Resultant review
should have cost me a fortune. Press office plaster review all over my
posters so that no-one can see what show it's for. I don't mind. People
are already reading them.
Give chat on Animal Farm at James Thin's bookshop. Faintly perturbed
by fierce Orwell expert with stick in front row, but escape unscathed.
Quell director's rage by obtaining from his own complimentary copy of
Steadman's Animal Farm. (This is too easy). He can't tell me off now.
Very tired but still manage to attend first Usual Suspects show at BBC
Radio Scotland. Entertain saveloy and chips in bed at midnight while
director cavorts until 4am.
* DAY FOUR
8.30am: RUDE awakening . . . Saveloy and chips repeating on me.
Meeting at Assembly with Guardian at 10am. The Voice has relapsed for no
apparent reason, and I was nice to it yesterday as well. This is
Festival 94: The Sequel in the making. Perhaps the Edinburgh Suite needs
humidifying. Stage manager forgets costume and tells me that ''All
animals should go naked.'' (I don't think.) Fierce response sends her
scuttling home.
Feel good with first full house but voice very ropy. Hens and sheep
mooing like cows. Squealer has become a bull, and Boxer and Clover sound
like the Andrews Sisters. Bizarre. Am aware of several reviewers
scribbling. Post-show investigation reveals five major and one minor
publication. Am self-conscious but several punters stand up at end --
probably seats are uncomfortable.
Post-show somnambulance averted by sumptuous Italian meal at Napoli
(Hanover Street). Watch Greg Proops's show (hysterical) and thence to
Traverse for Danny Hoch (Some People). No words can adequately describe
his virtuosity. Simultaneously depressed and elated by his brilliance.
Perhaps he'd like to take over a small agricultural concern in the
Edinburgh Suite. Bed by 1.00am preceded by two vast (purely medicinal)
hot toddies.
DAY FIVE
8.00am: Steam Bath.
9.45am: Live radio interview. Brain active. Voice inactive -- faintly
Burtonesque. Presently considering recording a new once lost, now found
''Burton'' version of Animal Farm. ''Hello, I'm Clover, and I've foaled
four times'' (I don't think.) Panic at theatre. Lemsips disappeared.
Stage managers hastily dispatched to chemist. Elixir arrives at
curtain up, but tall leggy blonde, upon late entrance, takes front-row
seat. Resultant ad-lib brings the house  down for five full minutes
during Old Major's speech.
She's so perfect as Mollie, Orwell's foolish, pretty white mare, I
believe Sugarcandy Mountain does exist. Old Major dies happy. Remaining
performance notably lacking focus despite the presence of four more
national reviewers, but I get away with it. Director accuses me of being
a lucky pig but earlier pork belly laughs get me off hook. (I call it
tactics.) Post-show atrophy in Club Bar until 5.30pm. Sound check at BBC
Radio is followed by second unbelievable dinner at Napoli. Director
forgives earlier indiscretions as I pay bill.
Later success with great review on Usual Suspects Live. Celebration
and champagne ensures. Bed at 3.00am (Can't sleep . . . Desperately
seeking Mollie.)
DAY SIX
8.00am: STEAM bath. Big day. 50th anniversary of first publication of
Animal Farm. Steadman himself and Ed Nights attending. Director nervous
. . . He wants to play Squealer (pull yourself together man).
Panic. No honey. Steadman late, voice non-existent, no Mollie . . . no
show?
Relief. Huge standing ovation. Unbelievable. Director in tears. I'm in
tears. Ed Nights ecstatic. Pay stage managers. Stage managers ecstatic.
Quick pint. Taxi to car. Car to airport. Plane to London. Home. End of
first week . . .
* Guy Masterson is appearing in Animal Farm at the Assembly Rooms
until September 2.

THERE is, of course, no such thing as the Andras Schiff Quintet. The
great Hungarian pianist -- a master of clarity and purity at the
keyboard -- has a knack of bringing ad hoc groups together, meticulously
rehearsing them, and producing extremely classy performances of chamber
music.
It's not a practice that automatically carries a guarantee of
excellence; sometimes such groups amount to less than the sum of their
parts. But the outfit that Schiff put together for his weekend survey of
Dvorak's chamber music had the capacity Queen's Hall audience roaring
and reeling, blistered both by the heat and the temperature of the
playing.
This was a supergroup that lived up to the description, producing a
scorching performance of Dvorak's great Piano Quintet, one that had the
assuredness of absolute technical confidence and the immediacy of
improvisation. And the results were some of the most electrifying
playing ever produced in a Festival chamber music concert.
At either end of the tonal spectrum in this brimming performance of
the quintet were Schiff in the engine room, storming through the piano
part, bouncing in his seat, driving the rhythm machine of the piece, and
the great Russian cellist, Boris Pergamens Chikow, rock solid on the
bass line, rich and poetic. Up top, cool but staggeringly bright and
accurate on violins, were the Japanese, Yuuko Shiokawa, and the Russian,
Anna Kandinskaia, while in the middle of the sandwich, the youngest, and
perhaps the one weak link, Boris Faust on viola, sounding a little
intimidated in the company.
The concert also included a lucid account of the Terzetto for strings,
which was a masterpiece of transparency, and, with Schiff, an
impassioned performance of the Piano Trio. The Festival should give
Schiff carte blanche to put together another group for next year. The
results are unpredictable but worth the risk.

WAGE settlements in the manufacturing sector in the three months to
July rose 3.4% compared with 3.5% in the three months to June according
to the latest CBI Pay Databank survey. But year on year, they increased
from 2.8%. The inability to raise prices is the most important influence
in restraining pay increases, ahead of low profits and low inflation.
Manufacturers also said there has been a slight fall in productivity
gains between the first two quarters of 1995 from 5% to 4.5%.
However, workers in the service industries appear to be slightly
better off in that their pay has risen 3.7% in the latest three months
compared with 3.6% in the June quarter and 3.4% a year ago.
CBI chief economic adviser Kate Barker said the figures show that
manufacturing earnings in total are still rising faster than those of
Britain's main competitors.

AS THE lad used to warble: ''All you have to do is dream, dream,
dream.'' Then pick your team and prepare to meet Jonah Lomu and the rest
of the All Blacks when Scotland go visiting. The good news is you don't
have to play against Jonah.
To encourage you in your labours, the sports editor, he of the green
eye-shade who lives in a permanently darkened room, suggested I might
like to select my own dream team, the best Scottish XV I can muster from
some 26 years of writing about the game. ''Yes, master,'' I said firmly,
''as long as I can have a nightmare side as well.''
More of that anon -- first the good guys. I have chosen from the year
1968 to the present, and have included three of the current
international squad.
The full-back is Andy Irvine. Where's Gavin, you scream? On the bench
-- he comes on at half-time when Andy pulls a hamstring.
Tony Stanger and Kenny Logan are the wings. ''But I don't want to be
on the wing.'' Shut up, Stanger, or you will be fined. Logan is there
because I want someone to say ''awesome'' in the warm-up.
John Frame, good egg, and Jim Renwick, good laugh, are the centres.
''I heard, Jim, you had a vasectomy recently.''
''I did. As the Irishman said when he had all his teeth out: ''Never
again'.''
John Rutherford, sheer class, has to be the fly-half. The great Gary
is his partner -- we want him in NZ, too.
I've picked Ian McLauchlan because I need the money, and Colin Deans
to hook. Iain ''The Bear'' Milne is there to help me at the bookies.
Doddie Weir and Gordon Brown were made for each other, while I would
just love to have seen JJ and Fin Calder combine with PC Brown. Peter is
to be captain, goalkicker, and will do a bit of refereeing as well.
On the bench with Gav is Al McHarg, who will know what to do if things
go wrong. Which they won't, as this is a World Cup-winning team.
Dream XV -- A R Irvine (Heriot's FP); A G Stanger (Hawick), J N M
Frame (Gala), J M Renwick (Hawick), K M Logan (Stirling County); J Y
Rutherford (Selkirk), G Armstrong (Jed-Forest); I McLauchlan
(Jordanhill), C M Deans (Hawick), I G Milne (Heriot's FP), G L Weir
(Melrose), G L Brown (West), J Jeffrey (Kelso), P C Brown (Gala), F
Calder (Stewart's Melville). Replacements -- A G Hastings (Watsonians),
G P J Townsend (Gala), R J Laidlaw (Jed-Forest), A F McHarg
(London-Scottish), K S Milne (Heriot's FP), A B Carmichael (West).
Now my second selection, drawn from the same period, might seem a bit
cruel. All the players, bar one, share the distinction of playing for
Scotland only once, some of them for very short times indeed.
The record-holder in that department has to be Gordon Macdonald, the
London-Scottish full back. He came on as a replacement for two minutes
against Ireland in 1969, and there was considerable doubt afterwards
that he had even been told so to do.
Though they may have only 14 caps among them, this team has some fine
players whose careers were blighted by injury. Gregor Mackenzie and Ken
Oliver fit into that category, and Derek Deans was a travelling reserve
in the days before replacements.
It also would have to be said that some of this side were one-cap
wonders who disappeared as quickly as they arrived.
But their pictures still decorate club-room walls.
The exception was Hawick's Wat Davies, picked for his country but
never able to play because of a knee injury. He was an outstanding
flanker.
Other XV -- W G Macdonald (London-Scottish); A S Turk (Langholm), G A
Birkett (London-Scottish), J S Gossman (West), R S M Hannah (West); R W
Breakey (Gosforth), R C Allan (Hutchesons'), A D G Mackenzie (Selkirk),
D Deans (Hawick), R D H Bryce (West), R W J Wright (Edinburgh
Wanderers), A E D Macdonald (Heriot's FP), W S Davies (Hawick), G K
Oliver (Gala), S K McGaughey (Hawick).
No-one wanted to sit on the bench.

IT was the perfect place to watch a pantomime.
The Pavilion Theatre, Glasgow, has staged many in its time, but at 5am
yesterday it reached a zenith in farce.
There was a villain and an underdog, but this time the villain won.
And it was all over in a flash as if aided by the genie from Aladdin,
coincidentally the next real pantomime scheduled for the theatre.
The biggest world-wide boxing audience ever tuned in to watch Iron
Mike Tyson make his return to the ring against Peter McNeeley after a
four-year break, including a three-year helping of porridge. In Glasgow,
fans paid #25 to view the contest on a big screen by satellite from Las
Vegas, where more than 16,000 saw the charade live. In London some paid
#100 to see how the hugely odds-on former champion would fare.
The show began at midnight with a video tracing the progress of the
two fighters from Tyson's Camp of the Champ in Ohio to McNeeley's in
Massachusetts. The narrator appeared to have had a coat of white
emulsion applied to his teeth and would have been better suited to a
revivalist meeting. Things didn't augur well.
There followed an interview with Big Frank Bruno, who seems to believe
his destiny leads him to the heavyweight championship of the world.
Delays in Las Vegas meant that the whole video was shown all over
again. The natives were getting restive. ''Not Bruno again. We should
start taking bets on who's going to be awake when the big fight
starts,'' one despondent fan said.
An assortment of celebrities from Denzel Washington to Jim Carrey
professed their belief in the errant former champion and made their way
to outlandishly priced ringside seats.
Eventually the action got under way with a WBC lightweight match
between champion Miguel Gonzalez and Lamar Murphy. Probably one of the
most exciting moments of the evening was the punch-up in the ring after
the decision went Gonzalez's way.
The large, mainly male audience in the Pavilion were slumped in their
seats between visits to the bar and to the foyer for fresh air.
Understandably so, for the fight that preceded the Tyson debacle was
numbingly awful -- a WBA heavyweight title bout between holder Bruce
Seldon and Blackfoot Native American, Joe Hipp.
A man in the back row suggested that Joe should have an ''O'' added to
his surname. The contest was eventually stopped and the audience
breathed a sigh of relief. The Fight was getting closer. It was 4.30a.m.
More celebrities made their way to ringside seats and the Pavilion
audience certainly woke up when Baywatch's Pamela Anderson made an
appearance.
And then the moment arrived. McNeeley, third in line of a proud boxing
family, made his way to the ring, and the atmosphere in Glasgow, as well
as in Las Vegas, suddenly became electric. The great man appeared in his
uniform black trunks, his face etched with menace and the fans cheered
in anticipation.
''Let's get it on,'' said the referee. Five minutes later we were all
out in the street wondering where the previous five hours had gone, the
boos from Las Vegas echoed by the disgruntled audience in Glasgow.
Iron Mike may have $25m to show for his 89 seconds of work, but nobody
is any the wiser about whether he's anything like his old form.
After all, there was barely time for the obsequious MC to get out of
the ring before Tyson was on his way back to the locker room. Even the
singing of the National Anthem lasted longer than the hugely anticipated
bout.

''The weather is good and the sea is tempting, but Rangers should not
come here as tourists.'' -- Andreas Michaelides, coach of the national
Cypriot side.
IT IS easy to become distracted from business on a sun-baked island
where the name of the game at this time of the year is to part the
tourists who dominate the bars and beaches from their money, but for a
small group of Cypriots, their resolve and confidence strengthened by a
few Eastern Europeans, the challenge is much more aesthetic.
The players of Anorthosis Famagusta are engaged in the business of
living a dream.
Displaced and longing for home as it was before Turkish soldiers
marched into Cyprus 21 years ago, Anorthosis are fueled by a passion
which transcends hard cash or the promise of bonus payments.
They know, of course, of the riches which can be won from
participation in the Champions' League, but wealth for them will be
found in the satisfaction of beating a club they consider to be one of
the most powerful in Europe.
When a body of men are united in a common goal which has nothing to do
with material gain, they can be at their most potent and this is why
Rangers will have to tread warily when they arrive here in Cyprus early
this evening. Listening to the Cypriots talk with confidence and genuine
belief of the second leg of their European Cup preliminary tie against
Rangers, the more slender and tenuous appears the Ibrox side's 1-0 lead.
Anorthosis have thought of nothing other than this tie since the draw
was made, because their domestic championship won't start until next
month, and over the weekend they were heavily into preparation for the
most important match they have ever faced. The majority of their squad
are semi-professional but in recent weeks they have been working
full-time, just like the three Bulgarian players, Iliao Kiriakov,
Valentin Ignatov, and Nikolai Todorov, and the former Serb, Sinimo
Gogic, who were signed to provide the experience and guile needed to
succeed in Europe.
Their Bulgarian manager, Georgi Vasillev, formerly of Levski Sofia,
who have already cost Rangers millions in this competition, has
pronounced himself content with progress and is making confident noises
about the return leg in the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium -- they are one
of the few teams here who own their own stadium -- on Wednesday night.
He stopped short of predicting a win for his side, but perhaps that
will come as he finalises preparations and the significance of what he
is about to ask of mostly modest players takes hold.
On Friday, Anorthosis played another Cypriot first-division side,
Ethnikos, in a game arranged especially as a final warm-up for the
second leg and Vassilev's team won 3-2. Kiriakov, who subdued Paul
Gascoigne at Ibrox, scored twice and Todorov also hit the net.
Already the supporters of Anorthosis, who are drawn from across the
island, sense glory approaching, even those able to stand back and take
a fairly dispassionate view.
Andreas Michaelides, coach of the national Cypriot side, wears a smile
of dazzling wattage, because all three of Cyprus's European
representatives -- both Apoel and Omonia Nicosia are 3-0 up against
Nefski Baku (Azerbaijan) and Slima Wanderers (Malta) in the European
Cup-winners' Cup and UEFA Cup respectively -- have done well thus far.
He, too, believes Anorthosis might have it in them to overtake Rangers
in a small ground and on a surface baked hard by the sun.
''I watched the match in Glasgow and I saw enough to think that, at
the very least, Vassilev will be able to have his players ready for the
next stage,'' he said. ''The weather is good and the sea is tempting,
but Rangers should not come here as tourists.
''Anorthosis have become a much improved side with the arrival of the
manager and the three other Bulgarians, who have all brought great
experience and patience to the play. The team used to play more
directly, hitting the ball long to the front, but now they build.
''We all saw at Ibrox how they were able to play with good passing
movements. There is certainly more thought in their play and I think it
was significant that Vassilev seemed to know Rangers' strengths and
weaknesses, and he instructed his players accordingly.''
Michaelides knows the Anorthosis side extremely well, since he draws
heavily from the club when selecting his national squad, and he warned
that striker Gogic has much more to give. ''He didn't play at his best
in Glasgow, but if he gets the chances he had that night, he will take
them this time. I'm sure of that.
''In fact, there are one or two others who have still to produce their
best form in this tie and it will be very difficult for Rangers to cope
with the small stadium.
''It will be Anorthosis's intention to play with patience, to search
for openings and try to beat Andy Goram, who, I understand, didn't play
for my friend Craig Brown against Greece. I don't quite understand that,
but I'm sure he'll be playing on Wednesday.
''If Rangers play Gascoigne they will have to be careful, because it
seemed to me they were determined to include him in every move in the
first game, when Anorthosis played him very well.''
Michaelides feels there is a growing confidence among the Anorthosis
players, who are champions for the first time in the club's history, and
the supporters are very passionately behind them because of their
refugee status. The club asked the fans to help with finances at the end
of last season and they responded by raising #300,000, asking nothing in
return.
This money helped bring in the likes of Kiriakov. Lotteries, with
luxury cars being the prizes for the winning 100 tickets, also have
helped pay the club's way, but the gap between the Anorthosis commercial
operation and the money-making business Rangers have become is as wide
as a canyon.
Yet, the Cypriots, who are being offered #1000 a man to win the tie
compared to Rangers' offer of #25,000 per head, are within touching
distance of the Champions' League.
''They know they could achieve something special for themselves and
also Cyprus,'' said Michaelides. ''The heart of this island will be
beating for them on Wednesday, the population have been living for this
game and, although it sounds dramatic, I have to say this tie is more
than a matter of life and death.
''You know we cannot begin to imagine the effects beating Rangers and
entering the Champions' League would have on all of us here. Football is
such a large part of this island and, if Anorthosis do win, the
celebrations will last for a week.''
It means a great deal to Rangers also and Walter Smith's players will
have to match the personal pride of their opponents if a slim Scottish
lead taken in Ibrox is to be protected or even enhanced. Little should
be made also of the fact that one side is professional and the other
part-time, because while Rangers' players train in the mornings and then
go home, Anorthosis's players -- the Eastern Europeans apart -- work
during the mornings at fairly easy jobs and train all afternoon.
Also, they went to Hamburg for a month before to prepare for the first
leg and flew straight into Glasgow, where the benefits of their build-up
were there for all to see.
Anorthosis are serious about this business, as Atletico Bilbao, who
lost 2-0 here in a UEFA Cup tie last year, discovered.

WHY mountain bike in Paisley? There are no mountains in Paisley, if
you don't count the mountains of Social Work paperwork in Fergie Park.
Well there are sort of mountains in Gleniffer Park -- wee hills
really, but big enough to frighten me, or you, if it comes to cavorting
about them on a bicycle.
These are no ordinary cycles though. They are state of the art
technology bikes, designed for very rough terrain indeed.
A good machine costs between two and three grand. Top of the range can
be as much as #5000, and rightly so considering the remarkable
suspension and the alloys which modern science can come up with.
The development of mountain bikes has led to a considerable change in
the structure of the road-racers. It is a lot of money.
A lot of money is indeed involved in this sport, and sponsorship is
essential. The last time I covered, two years ago, this Scottish Cycling
Union Scottish National Championships at Glen Park, in the easily
accessible Glennifer Braes, I wrote about the sponsorship a lot.
Quite right too. The sport would not survive without it. Thomson's
Cycles does a lot. Ayrshire-based, but with Glasgow outlets, Thomson's
has a lot of money invested.
David Hoy, whom we recollect two years back said: ''All cyclists are
nutters. Like one of your lines last time -- goalies in football teams
and trombone players in jazz bands.''
But they are civilised nutters. Andrew Wright, who won last week's
Scottish Series is an ex-Aberdeen Yooni engineering student who has
taken up this sport full-time and hopes to earn his living at it.
(The United States, where the mountain bike originated, has a full
wheen of professionals, and doing very well). Wright is sponsored quite
heavily by Dooley's Cycles in Paisley.
Jill Struthers, who came in first for the women Elite/Sports, in a
good time considering the heat, was sponsored by the famous Raleigh
company.
Two years ago she was Scottish junior champion, representing the
Rockhard Mountain Bike Club, sponsored by, well, who else, Thomson's.
I told you about the sponsorship. The biggest group funding
yesterday's sun-soaked event was Mazda, whom I remember being neither
Flashy nor Dim but Mazda. (You have to be quite elderly really to
remember that splendid advert for the light-bulb company).
Sponsorship does not come easily, and no specialist sport can start,
let alone grow, without it. To do the Scottish Series itself, every club
has to come up with #550, and with only 10 or 11 registered mountain
bike clubs this is a dreadful burden.
Every entrant yesterday paid a #13 entry fee, and that doesn't count
the cost of transport or accommodation -- there were a number of
entrants from Ireland and England -- and as I have pointed out, the cost
of bikes and equipment and maintenace is high.
But finance is coming in. Just beside the burger tent, which makes a
fair amount for the clubs, was the Volvo tent.
Sarah, who represents the American Volvo company and who hails from
Chicago, has been here in Scotland, off and on, for eight months. ''It's
a huge sport in the States,'' she told me, ''but we are opening up here
too with our club Volvo-Cannondale UK, and we've already signed up Danny
Whitehead as our Scottish representative''. Whitehead is a British and
world champion.
Two years back, Jill Struthers's mum, Fiona, told me that mountain
bike competition could become an Olympic item.
Well it is now, and will feature in the next round of that sporting
focus.
Some of the road-racers rather despise this new infant, but they
should not. For a start it brings in kids. The Sprogs event (confined to
those under twelve) brought forth children as young as five.
Don't worry, it's not dangerous, though it looks horribly so for the
older expert bikers. I spoke to Alex Rankin, aged six -- she's a girl
incidentally.
Alex is a mountain biker. Her sister Cher is four and told me her much
older brother William is rated ninth in Scotland. ''Just you wait,''
said the girls, ''we'll get good enough to beat him.''

IT WAS always going to be a dirty war as Scotland's three main radio
stations fought it out for the Saturday afternoon football audience. But
I didn't expect the language to be so down-to-earth.
Auntie Beeb set the downmarket tone with this Radio Scotland
Sportsound announcement to their competitors: ''We've upped our football
coverage. Now up yours.''
Even this level of subtlety went out the window in the programme's
phone-in section. Such-and-such a player, we were wittily informed, was
''shite.'' Another was ''an arse.'' Very authentic, but not very
entertaining.
Even the advertisements on the commercial channel were getting into
the act. George Best was on promoting a magazine called Total Football.
Reading this publication was one of his favourite hobbies, he told us.
Then, in a blurred but still audible postscript, he added that his other
hobby is ''rubbing knickers on my face.'' Good for the kids to have a
role model.
All three stations were trying very hard. Scot FM, the new kid on the
block which had cleverly snatched the commercial radio live league
football rights from Radio Clyde, had most to prove. Their programme,
The Dug Out, would be all about goals, their commentator and star man
Ken McRobb said. Today, it was all about the Coca-Cola Cup, he added.
Neil Henderson, back in the studio, told us the programme was all about
the fans.
Radio coverage of football is all about making sure your lines to and
from the football park are working. And as their programme kicked off,
Scot FM's weren't.
But Saturday afternoon was all about how Radio Clyde would cope with
not having live access to the football grounds while the matches were
under way. First impression is that they are up the creek without any
coverage.
''When any goals are scored, you know where you will hear it first,''
Derek Johnstone promised us. When Clydebank scored against Motherwell,
Radio Scotland reported it at 3.03pm, Scot FM at 3.08pm, and Radio Clyde
at 3.11pm.
For the vital hour during which both their rivals are giving live
commentary and coverage from other games, Clyde have to rely on Big
Derek and Paul Cooney sitting in a studio reading news flashes about the
action. This is supplemented by a diet of cauld kale prerecorded
interviews.
Their major exclusive of the day was a Japanese prime minister-style
apology from Gazza saying that he didn't have a clue what he was doing
when he played his flute.
Clyde's main man Archie McPherson proceeded to perpetrate a vicious
and hefty late tackle on Rangers manager Walter Smith just before the
kick-off at Ibrox. Archie, in downbeat mood for a man who normally
sounds so enthusiastic about Rangers, did everything but ask Walter what
buroo he would be signing on at on Thursday after Rangers' exit from
Europe.
So what was the final result of the first afternoon's play in this
three-way competition? Champions Radio Clyde are struggling. Scot FM are
adequate, but a bit dull.
Clear winners were Radio Scotland with a bright mix of informative and
light-hearted coverage. They had an interview with Graeme Souness in
Turkey, in which he told us of his new job. ''You can say never say
never and it was an offer I couldn't refuse,'' he said, thus managing to
sound simultaneously like James Bond and Don Corleone.
The fanzine-style segments hosted by Stuart Cosgrove, telly star and
St Johnstone fan, are promising despite the language.
Tom Cowan, Evening Times sports humorist and Motherwell supporter, can
be pretty filthy, but is very funny. I liked his bit about footballers
and walls. Ally McCoist and Tommy Coyne in trouble for building 10ft
walls around their houses. Duncan Ferguson very likely going to live in
a place surrounded by a 50ft wall. Andy Goram with his very own padded
wall.
Andy is going to have to live his new reputation as a man who is often
in two minds. We were told the fans at Ibrox have a new chant: ''Two
Andy Gorams, there's only two Andy Gorams.'' Your reporter here was in
three minds, with Radio Clyde on the radiogram (or music centre, as I
believe it is now called) in the living room, Radio Scotland on the
bakelite in the kitchen, and Scot FM on the Walkman. It is no way to
stay sane on a Saturday afternoon.

THE haunting memories of Scotland's campaign in the first European
Men's Hockey Cup in Brussels, 1970, when they finished a poor fifteenth,
came flooding back in Dublin on Saturday, when they were beaten 0-2 by
Wales from goals by Jon Reese and Tony Colclough.
This reversal leaves Scotland still searching for their first point
after three games and although they have still to play France today, and
Spain tomorrow, it's unlikely they will now finish any higher than
seventh in an event which now has only 12 finalists compared to 17 of 25
years ago.
The team still has a mission to accomplish by getting Scotland through
to the first phase of the World Cup. They can achieve that by securing
one of the five places which could become available in the championship.
Having tasted victory in only one of their past 12 games, the team has
lost the habit of winning. The confidence is being squeezed from the
squad but today's opponents, France, are equally inefficient, so
Scotland should put their miserable run behind them. Results:
SATURDAY -- Pool A: Holland 3, Spain 1; Belgium 2, France 1; Wales 2,
Scotland 0. YESTERDAY -- Pool B: Germany 3, Poland 0; Ireland 1, England
1; Beloruse 4, Switzerland 0.

THE British Women's Open could be coming to Scotland. After six years
at Woburn the tournament looks to be on the move.
Top players, including Scotland's Dale Reid and England's Laura
Davies, have become increasingly dissatisfied with the course and want
the event to follow the pattern of the Open and move to different venues
throughout Britain.
Dale said: ''This is my nineteenth Open and all of them have been
played in England. It is the biggest event for us in Europe and I am
certain more of the top players in America would play if the major
championship courses were given the chance to stage the event.''
Much has been made of the problems World No.1 Laura Davies has
encountered at Woburn this year. She won over the Duke's course in 1988.
That was played earlier in the year when the fairways were holding. This
year, after a rare, dry summer, they have become something of a lottery.
This has prompted a growing feeling among the players that the
championship should be taken around different courses and, as sponsors
Weetabix are sympathetic, it's certain the event will be on the move.
Sir Richard George, chairman of the sponsors, said: ''Contractually we
are tied to Woburn for another year, but there must be a very good
chance that in 1997 it will be played elsewhere.''
The championship has grown considerably since moving to Woburn
following its first three years at St Mellion, Lindrick, and Ferndown.
There is now increased prize money, television coverage, attendance
figures, and the appearance of world-class players.
Moving around the country could see it grow even further.

JOHN Horn's Spirit of London Docklands, winner of the opening leg, was
penalised seven places at the start of yesterday's second stage of the
Teacher's Round Britain Challenge in Cardiff.
Horn is claimed to have made an infringement on the start line a week
ago.
As the 10 boats from five nations struggled in light winds, Paul
Jeffes lay second in Lord Inverforth last night as they left Cardiff
Bay. The Scots lie equal-second with France, after the French protested
London Docklands.
The course for this leg has been reduced by more than 200 miles. The
prevailing light breezes mean the fleet will not now sail around Ireland
but head for Rothesay, where they are due to arrive any time between
Thursday and Saturday.
Round Britain Challenge -- standings after first leg -- 1, Wales 9pts;

CZECH OPEN
AMERICAN Peter Teravainen won his first European PGA Tour event when
he carried off the Chemapol Czech Open at Marianske Lasne yesterday. But
Yorkshireman Howard Clark, who was upset by photographers at the
sixteenth hole, should have gained his first victory since 1988.
Clark was leading by a shot from the American when he reached that
point but a dozen amateur photographers gathered round. The 40-year-old
Yorkshireman, completely distracted, blocked his No.4-iron tee shot out
to the right, could not reach the green in two, and bogeyed the hole.
Both Clark and Teravainen birdied the long seventeenth but the
Englishman then bogeyed the last after driving into the trees, when he
needed a par 4 to force a play-off. Clark went into a bunker with his
second shot, splashed out to seven feet, but then failed to reach the
hole.
So Teravainen, who was round in 67, won the day with a four-round
aggregate of 268, 16 under par, with Clark (69) on 269 followed by Ronan
Rafferty (71) and Sweden's Peter Hedblom (69) in joint-third place on
271.
Clark, who has not won a tournament since the English Open at Royal
Birkdale in 1988, was crestfallen but he had the consolation of winning
#83,320 and moving up from eighteenth to seventh in the Ryder Cup points
table.
The top 10 in the table, following the German Open which ends next
Sunday, are automatic selections for the team to meet the Americans at
Oak Hill, New York, next month. So Clark needs only a reasonable finish
in the German event to ensure his sixth Ryder Cup appearance, the last
of which was in 1989.
Teravainen had won only #9000 this year and his #125,000 first prize
beat his previous best -- third in the 1991 Swiss Open -- by nearly
#100,000.
David Gilford, who was joint twenty-fifth on 279, stayed sixth in the
Cup table. Mark James, who was joint sixth, moved up from ninth to
eighth.
Philip Walton, joint thirty-fifth, stayed in tenth place while both
Barry Lane and Spaniard Jose Rivero lost ground in the cup race.
Gary Orr was top Scot, posting a third consecutive 69 for joint-ninth
place and #14,610. Leading final scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
268 -- P Teravainen (USA) 67, 66, 68, 67 (#125,000).
269 -- H Clark 66, 68, 66, 69 (#83,320).
271 -- P Hedblom (Sweden) 68, 66, 68, 69; R Rafferty 65, 68, 67, 71
(#42,220 each).
273 -- D Clarke 67, 72, 65, 69; S Luna (Spain) 69, 67, 68, 69; J L
Guepy (France) 68, 68, 69, 68; N Fasth (Sweden) 66, 69, 66, 72 (#24,817

SCOTLAND were beaten 6-2 by Israel in their opening game in the
three-match women's Test series in Ramat Gan.
The Scots landed the pairs, were just edged out in the triples and
singles, but lost heavily in the fours.
Sarah Gourlay and Frances Whyte took the pairs points when recovering
from 8-13 to beat Carmel Scop and Renee Kusman 18-14.
Betty Forsyth, Eleanor Allan, and Joyce Lindores held a 13-11 lead in
the triples with four ends to play, but the Israeli side conjured up a 5
on the fifteenth end to lead 16-13.
Back came the Scots with a double and single to square the match but
in an incident-filled deciding end the shot changed hands before the
home side got the count that gave them a 17-16 win.
The Scots fours side of Forsyth, Allan, Lindores, and Whyte made a
poor start and were 20-0 down after eight ends. That meant the Scots
needed a singles win to salvage a draw but Gourlay let slip a 19-13 lead
and lost 25-21. Results:
Israel 6, Scotland 2. Singles -- M Swerdlow 25, S Gourlay 21. Pairs --
C Scop and R Kusman 14, Gourlay and F Whyte 18. Triples -- I Myers,
Swerdlow, and M Hirschowitz 17, D Forsyth, E Allan, J Lindores 16. Fours
-- Myers, Scop, Kusman, and Hirschowitz 29, Forsyth, Allan, Lindores,
and Whyte 6.

THIS year's World Rowing Championships get under way in earnest in
Tampere, Finland, today with Scotland's lightweight world sculling
champion, Peter Haining, attempting to become the first person to take
this title three times.
Meanwhile, Britain's seemingly invincible pair of Steve Redgrave and
Matthew Pincent look to be on course for their fourth successive world
title together.
A newly-formed British women's eight, with Scottish internationalist
Dot Blackie aboard, has performed well on the circuit this year and
could take a medal this week.
* SCOTTISH rowing made its annual pilgrimage to Greenock on Saturday,
when Royal West of Scotland staged the Scottish Jollyboat Championships.
The hosts, Royal West, who are the only Scottish club still regularly
using this type of fixed-seat boat, were winners of the men's fours
event, while St Andrew (Edinburgh) won the women's fours title.
Clyde won the women's pairs event, and open sculls went to George
Parsonage, of Clydesdale. Ian Duncan, of Deeside Scullers, took the
restricted sculls event, while Castle Semple won the coastal fours
event.

COMPOSED in temperament, solid in striking, but sometimes slow in
execution, Karrie Webb yesterday achieved the remarkable feat of winning
a professional tournament in her rookie year at only the twelfth time of
asking -- and by a margin, six strokes, that was as impressive as it was
convincing.
With a final-round 70 for a total of 278, 14 under par, the
20-year-old Australian took the Weetabix Women's British Open title at
Woburn. In the blue riband event of the American Express Tour, Europe's
foremost players and the sprinkling of Americans were left for dead.
The measure of Webb's precocious entry into the winners' charmed
circle could be taken from the identity of those who were second --
Sweden's Annika Sorenstam, winner of two European tournaments and the US
Open within the space of five weeks this summer, and Jill McGill, who
last year reached the final defending her US amateur title and also won
the Public Links championship.
On another scorching afternoon Webb's game confirmed the maturity
developed first in becoming runner-up to Laura Davies in December's
Australian Masters in her second outing, and in finishing in the first
nine five times in nine previous European events.
In taking her earnings to #87,000, Webb, who led by a stroke from Val
Skinner after 54 holes, did not put a foot wrong until she made a
double-bogey 6 at the twelfth, but by then, having built insurance
against her inexperience and the greater difficulties on the inward
half, she led by six strokes.
Indeed at the moment when Webb was taking 6, having been refused a
free drop from the hole into which her second shot had rolled and then
bunkered her third, her then closest pursuers, Sorenstam and Caroline
Pierce, were shedding strokes, so that Webb's nerve and technique went
untested.
Webb laid the foundations of victory with an outward 32, three under,
and so assuredly did she continue that her response to the double bogey
was to recover one stroke by pitching dead at the fourteenth.
A sensible iron shot from the seventeenth tee steered Webb away from
any temptation to be needlessly adventurous at the moment of truth and,
maintaining her equilibrium to the end, the young Australian rounded off
the most memorable experience of her brief career so far by chipping to
two feet for the last of her six birdies.
Highly emotional in the immediate aftermath of her triumph, Webb was,
nevertheless, poised enough to disclose that her next objective was to
qualify for the LPGA Tour, as the first step towards which she will next
week take part in the preliminary competition for the final qualifying
school in the autumn.
''I can't believe that I've won a major title in my first year as a
professional,'' said Webb. ''It only began to be nerve-racking from the
turn, especially after the double bogey, but I knew I had a good lead
and I felt more comfortable after Annika (then six behind) didn't make a
birdie at the thirteenth.''
It may seem churlish to criticise Webb in her finest hour, but the
putting routine from which she never deviates, be the distance four feet
or 40, so delayed play that she and Skinner, not quick herself, were two
holes behind Lotta Neumann, the holder, and Suzanne Strudwick, putting
on the tenth green when they were on the ninth tee. Their round lasted
almost four hours.
The six Scottish players who made the 36-hole cut were, in the end,
led on 289 by Catriona Matthew, competing in her first European
tournament as she continues her recuperation from the serious operation
in March.

MONICA Seles is back. The American completed a remarkable first week's
return to tournament tennis yesterday by defeating Amanda Coetzer 6-0,
6-1 to win the Canadian Open in Toronto.
Returning to competitive tennis two and a half years after she was
stabbed during a tournament in Hamburg, Seles seemed to have lost none
of the skills that made her the No.1 player in the world.
She chose the Canadian Open to warm up for the US Open which begins
next week. But her game was so strong the warm-up turned into a waltz.
As she had all week, Seles dominated the match with Coetzer. The South
African had simplified Seles' way to the title by knocking out four
seeded players, including Steffi Graf, Mary Pierce and No.4 Jana
Novotna. When she encountered Seles, however, it was no contest.
* ANDRE Agassi defeated Richard Krajicek yesterday capture the Volvo
International championship in New Haven, Connecticut.
Agassi, down a pair of match points in the second set, rallied to win
3-6, 7-6, 6-3 to capture the #100,000 first prize.
The world No.1 has now won 20 successive matches and four consecutive
tournament titles.
* SWEDEN'S Thomas Enqvist entered the world's top 10 yesterday by
beating German Bernd Karbacher to win the #650,000 RCA Championship in
Indianapolis.
When today's ATP Tour rankings come out, Enqvist will be world No.9,
becoming the twelfth Swede since rankings begam in 1973 to crack the top
10.

AMERICAN Lee Janzen stormed home with four birdies in the final five
holes to clinch a narrow victory at the $1.5m International tournament
in Denver, Colorado, yesterday.
Janzen edged out South African Ernie Els by one point in the modified
Stableford format to become the first three-time winner on the US Tour
this year.
He also sent an emphatic message to US Ryder Cup captain Lanny
Wadkins, who overlooked the 1993 US Open champion when he named his two
captain's choices last week.
Janzen reeled off four successive birdies from the fourteenth hole at
Castle Pines, before sinking a testing six-foot par putt at the final
hole to win.
He had six birdies and three bogeys in a closing three-under-par 69,
worth nine points in the format which awards five points for eagle, two
for a birdie, zero for par, minus one for bogey, and minus three for
double bogey or worse.
Janzen finished on 34 points to collect $270,000 for his seventh US
Tour victory and jump to the top of the money list.
But he was aided by Els, who bogeyed the final hole to come up short
for the second successive week.
The South African took a three-shot lead into the final round at last
week's US PGA Championship, but faded to finish equal third.
Looking for redemption yesterday, he made three straight birdies,
starting at the twelfth to vault to the front, but it wasn't enough.
Janzen, who made three eagles during the week to capitalise on the
unique scoring format, said: ''To be in contention considering the way I
played was incredible. Any other week I would not have been in
contention.
''If I'd done this last week the Ryder Cup situation wouldn't even be
a controversy.''
Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal showed his form is good going into the
Ryder Cup when he tied for sixth on 26 points after making seven
birdies, three bogeys, and a double bogey in a rollercoaster closing
round.
''I struck the ball well and made a few putts. It was my best day of
the four I've played here,'' said Olazabal, who earlier in the week said
he was likely to decline a Ryder Cup berth even if selected by captain
Bernard Gallacher.
Ulsterman David Feherty tied for eleventh, his best result on the US
Tour this year, on 22 points after recording two birdies and two bogeys
in an even-par 72. Final points (American unless stated):
34 -- Lee Janzen 10, 9, 6, 9.
33 -- Ernie Els (S Africa) 17, 0, 7, 9.
28 -- Mark Wiebe 8, 15, -1, 6; Jay Haas 3, 12, 13, 0.
27 -- David Duval 10, 9, 6, 2.
26 -- Jose Maria Olazabal (Spain) 7, 5, 6, 8; Tom Watson 7, 8, 9, 2.
24 -- Greg Norman (Australia) 14, 3, -2, 9; Davis Love 11, 6, 6, 1;
Dan Forsman 3, 10, 7, 4.
22 -- David Feherty (N Ireland) 2, 11, 7, 2; Tom Kite 11, -1, 10, 2;
Kirk Triplett 5, 2, 10, 5.

THE Scottish County league leaders, Aberdeenshire, have been cleared
of charges that they did not fulfil a fixture against West Lothian at
Boghall last week.
It took an extraordinary meeting of the full Scottish County Cricket
Board at McKane Park, Dunfermline, to make the decision on evidence
presented. Only seven Mannofield players had turned up at Boghall, and
four others were stranded when their hired car broke down.
It was alleged that because some top players were unavailable, the
team from the North were not keen to play. The 10-man board yesterday
rejected these allegations, although they ruled that the game has to be
played on Sunday, August 27.
The Board's secretary/treasurer issued a statement, which made clear
their views, including that: ''Aberdeenshire were not in breach of
Clause 13 of the constitution . . . and did not willingly fail to fulfil
the fixture at Boghall on August 12.''
Later in the evening, West Lothian intimated that they would appeal to
the Scottish Cricket Union about the rescheduling of the game. It would
seem that next Sunday, they will have four top players unavailable, and
therefore have to field a weakened side when they are still in title
contention.
Both sides, however, managed to get on with the business of playing on
Saturday, and Aberdeenshire defeated Fifeshire by eight wickets at
Mannofield.
Mike Smith took four for 71 in 18 overs, while Aslam Raza top scored
for the Fifers with 50.
West Lothian set about Ayrshire at Boghall, with Ian Beven 52 not out
in their 202 for seven. Ayrshire seemed to be fine at 65 without loss
until Beven with four for 36 and Gordon Hollins with four for 24 had
them just surviving for the draw on 128 for nine.
Mark Kelaher hit a century for Strathmore as they reached 222 for five
away to Arbroath County. Nigel Hazel weighed in with 73, while Neil
Burnett took four for 49.
The home side made it to 163 for eight, Mike Clark hitting 52, And in
a low-scoring match at The Arns, Forfarshire set a target of 180 for the
home side, who reached 155 for seven.

FALKLAND and Edinburgh Academicals have waged their own private war
over the occupancy of bottom place in the first division of the Ryden
East League. On Saturday however, they pulled off a joint triumph as
dramatic as anything on the Festival progamme to leave Royal High right
in the mire.
Accies, batting first at Barnton reached 184 for eight, Craig Symon
contributing 64 and Dave Hill 50. But Symon, the Australian professional
had scarcely begun. He knocked over nine wickets for the cost of only 34
runs as High limped into three figures before expiring.
Across the city at Myreside, Watsonians set Falkland a daunting task
with a total of 239 for eight, 139 of which flowed from the bat of Kenny
Scott who was still there at the end. But a real captain's innings from
Brian Watson who carried his bat for 105 while Manoj Parmar supported
him with 79 enabled the battling Fifers to reach victory.
Those results leave Royal High with a visit to Carlton as their last
chance to escape, but given Freuchie's win at Grange Loan yesterday,
Carlton have their own position to protect. Scott Birrell was man of the
match here with four wickets to add to his half-century. Scott Baker
also hit 50 for the home side.
Corstorphine's hope of a top five place receded with defeat at
Goldenacre, Shahid Aslam's unbeaten 77 the mainspring of yet another
Heriot's win.
Stenhousemuir and Grange had an entertaining match at Raeburn Place,
which featured some fine batting from both sides. Alec Davies dominated
the Grange innings with a knock of 86. While he was at the wicket, 201
runs were added. Roddy Smith chipped in with 39, Mike Everett and Gordon
McGurk entertained with cameos for 20 and Graham Hurlbatt was 29 not out
when over number 52 was completed.
These two extra overs may well have done Grange out of victory as
Stenhousemuir were eight wickets down at the close. On the other hand
they may have cost the visitors' their chance of a win because they
certainly had a go for it and finished only 17 adrift in the draw.

CLYDESDALE finally clinched the Western Union Championship for the
first time in 15 years.
City rivals West of Scotland had arrived at Titwood determined to take
the title race into the final Saturday of the season. Instead, they
could only limp to a draw and so hand a thirteenth championship success
to 'Dale exactly 100 years after their first triumph.
Saturday's performance may have lacked some of the champagne sparkle
which has characterised Clydesdale's campaign. But there was no
disguising the sense of relief as the bubbly flowed in the Titwood
clubhouse on Saturday night.
Skipper Scott Weir, a veteran of the 1980 champions, beamed: ''This
means so much to everyone connected with the club. It's been a long,
long wait.''
Weir also praised pro Aamir Hanif. The Pakistani batsman was once
again bang in form, stroking his way to 124.
Hanif and Weir steadied the home side after the loss of three early
wickets and their stand of 99 ensured that 'Dale would not be beaten.
Hanif's runs came off 143 balls and included fifteen boundaries.
Facing a target of 233 in 46 overs, after Weir had understandably
extended his side's innings, West were dealt a blow when Ian Stanger
removed Caribbean run-machine Mark Harper for 8. And when Greig
Williamson accounted for Alastair Storie soon after, West's own title
aspirations had all but gone.
Their tally of 112 for five represented a disappointing end to their
challenge.
Weir also singled-out Scotland all-rounder Williamson for special
praise.
He said: ''I told Greig at the start of the season that he'd be
opening the batting and that he should think of himself as a batsman who
can bowl rather than vice-versa.''
Aamir's old mate, Sajjid Ali, finished on the losing side despite
scoring a century, Poloc's 230 for nine being overhauled by Kilmarnock.
Greenock and Drumpellier boosted their chances of a Scottish Cup place
with wins over Kelburne and Ferguslie respectively, while Ayr had to
battle all the way to secure a draw against Uddingston.

DRUMPELLIER lifted the Whyte and Mackay Scottish Cup with a tense
three-wicket victory over favourites West of Scotland yesterday.
The Coatbridge side's big hero was veteran batsman Peter Campbell, who
again produced a marvellous display on the hard and true Hamilton
Crescent track.
His entertaining 79 was the outstanding performance of a thrilling
encounter and deservedly earned him the man-of-the match award.
Earlier in the season, Campbell -- in his mid-40s -- reached
thecentury milestone for the first time in his career.
He fell short of the magic mark this time. However, he said: ''In
terms of value to the team, this innings was much more important and
enjoyable.''
Drumpellier's season to date had been tinged with tragedy, as three
prominent officials died suddenly, including Scotland's chairman of
selectors Hugh Stevenson.
Campbell said: ''It would be right to dedicate this victory to Hugh
because he put so much time and energy into the club.''
The writing was on the wall for West when they lost pro Mark Harper
for just six with the total on 13. The Guyanan was brilliantly snapped
up by keeper Steve Allison off Salim Sajjad.
The home men dug in patiently and ground out a total of 213 for seven
from their 50 overs. As usual, Harper's opening partner Ally Storie was
the mainstay of the innings with 53.
However, the most fluent knock was provided by skipper Jon Williams,
who made 79 before being clean bowled by Sajjad, who took four wickets
overall.
But he was out of luck with the bat, going for just seven as he aimed
a wild stroke at spinner Mark Townson's straight ball.
Opener Zulfiqar Shahid hit a solid 57, but it was left to Campbell to
light the fuse.
Although Drumpellier lost three quick wickets in mid-innings for just
eight runs, Campbell was in the middle until they were just 13 short of
the target. He was finally run out by an accurate throw by Colin Mair.
The jitters began when Steve Carr was also run out, but teenager Scott
Dempsie and the experienced Drew Pryde kept cool to steer their side
home with just three deliveries remaining.
Mair had the unenviable task of bowling the final over with the scores
level.
Pryde was unable to make hay with the first two balls, but he raised
his hands in glee after pushing the third through mid-wicket for the
clinching single.

AN 81-ball century from Graham Cowdrey set up a 46-run victory over
Middlesex at Lord's that keeps Kent on top of the AXA Equity &amp; Law
League.
Cowdrey, who smacked seven 4s and four 6s on his way to an unbeaten
101, guided his side to 219 for eight.
Middlesex openers Paul Weekes (32) and Jason Pooley (51) gave their
side a wonderful start in reply, putting on 79 in 14 overs, but Aravinda
de Silva accounted for both as he returned Sunday-best bowling figures
of four for 28.
He was given admirable support by Alan Igglesden, who took two wickets
and conceded just 26 runs, as Middlesex were all out for 173 in 37
overs.
Warwickshire are clearly determined not to give up their title without
a fight, keeping within two points of Kent -- with a game in hand --
thanks to a record-equalling ninth successive Sunday League victory,
over Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.
Dougie Brown was the inspiration behind the champions' latest success,
firing an unbeaten 78 in 67 balls as Warwickshire, chasing 220, made it
with four wickets and three balls to spare.
Paul Johnson had earlier hit 82 off 77 balls as the home side made 219
for five -- a disappointing total after he and Tim Robinson (67) had put
on 90 for the second wicket in 16 overs.
Worcestershire and Lancashire, fifth and sixth in the table at the
start of the day, also kept up the pressure on the leaders with
comfortable victories.
Lancashire gained some revenge for their NatWest Trophy defeat by
Roses rivals Yorkshire with a 36-run success -- thanks largely to an
inspired opening spell from Glenn Chapple.
The England A paceman sent back David Byas, Martyn Moxon, and Michael
Vaughan within 10 overs and Yorkshire fell well short of their victory
target of 210, tottering to 174 for nine in their 40 overs.
Neil Fairbrother had earlier cracked an unbeaten 60 off 58 balls,
while Jason Gallian (40) and John Crawley (35) also made valuable
contributions for Lancashire.

TOM Murray, erstwhile national champion on country, road, and track,
indoor and out, displayed a new facet to his athletics talents on
Saturday. On his hill-racing debut he thrashed the best Scotland has to
offer in the national trial for the World Mountain Racing Championships,
writes Doug Gillon.
Over a brutally demanding 8-mile course in the Pentlands, a total of
2500 feet of climbing, designed to replicate the savage ascents and
descents on the route which will be used on Arthurs Seat for the world
championships a fortnight on Sunday, Murray headed the field by almost
two minutes.
Already a Scottish internationalist on road, track, and country, he is
certain to be named in the senior men's team of six which will be
announced today.
As his rivals came plummeting down the final helter-skelter descent,
Murray looked back up and shook his head. ''These guys must be mental,''
he said. ''I was absolutely petrified coming down there. Your legs just
pack in. You think they are going to buckle underneath you. I would not
like to do that very often.
''But I wanted to win, and win convincingly, to prove myself worthy of
a world place, and no arguments.''
The one-time anorectic has an insatiable competitive appetite. Second
earlier this year in the Northumberland all-terrain marathon, he is now
preparing for his first road marathon, in Holland in October.
In racing for his place, Murray turned down the opportunity to win
lucrative prize money in yesterday's Great Scottish Run. ''With the
world championships in my own country, I wanted to have a go. After all,
it is the only athletics event in which Scotland now competes at world
level.''
Murray was also a member of the last Scottish cross-country team to
compete in a world championships, in Warsaw, in 1987.
The Greenock man, who finished in 59min 12sec, was followed by Robert
Quinn (61-07), another track, road, and cross-country international. It
was only his third hill race. Last year he finished eighth in the World
Mountain Racing trophy event, at Berchtesgaden, when it was uphill-only.
This year's race, in Edinburgh, is both up and down. Both men plan to
race in the Cowal Highland Gathering next weekend, when track athletics
is back on the programme.
Colin Donnelly, former Scottish and British fell-running champion, and
an ever-present in the Scottish team since the world hill-running event
began in 1985, was third.
Alan Milligan enjoyed an even wider margin in the junior race. Third
in the East cross-country championship, the Fifer, an apprentice
mechanic, ran his first hill race only in April. Edinburgh medical
student Grant Stewart who was second, is also a relative novice.
But the women's winner, Helene Diamantides, has all the hill
credentials. Still record holder for the Mount Everest base camp to
Kathmandu run, the Glasgow physiotherapy student won by 33 seconds from
Angela Mudge. Results and probable world selections:
Senior men: T Murray (IBM Spango Valley) 59min 12sec; 2, R Quinn
(Kilbarchan) 61-07; 3, C Donnelly (Eryri) 61-16; 4, P Dymoke
(Livingston) 61-37; 5, G Bartlett (Forres) 61-44; 6, J Hepburn
(Lochaber) 61-59. Juniors: A Milligan (FMC Carnegie) 35-10; 2, G Stewart
(Edinburgh Univ) 37-51; 3, S Cameron (Lochaber) 37-59; 4, James Macleod
(Halifax) 39-00. Women: 1, H Diamantides (Westerlands) 40-20; 2, A Mudge

IT speaks volumes about the state of Scottish men's endurance running
that Peter Fleming, leading home finisher in yesterday's Great Scottish
Run, will today quit Scotland for good, to live and train at altitude in
the USA.
Fleming, national record-holder for yesterday's distance, the half
marathon, placed thirteenth, almost two minutes behind the winner, Sammy
Maritim, of Kenya.
Ranked fifth in the UK at the marathon, and third at 10 miles, Fleming
insists he gets more support for his running career in Colorado than he
has had in Britain.
A former winner of the Scottish People's Marathon, and a Commonwealth
internationalist, he flies outtoday to set up home in Boulder. ''I have
had enough of Scotland,'' he said. ''I have sold up everything I have
here, and hope to have my green card in the USA by Christmas.
''The British Athletics Federation does nothing to support marathon
runners, and I am completely disillusioned. The sooner they realise we
are professional runners, who approach the sport in a professional way,
the better.
''I would like to run in the Atlanta Olympics, but could forget that
if I make my base here,'' added the former Bellahouston Harrier. ''If I
need physio treatment here, it takes three days to arrange it. In
Boulder, I can have it within an hour.''
Fleming, who collected #500 as first Scot, held a place in the leading
group which ran down the early leader, Dave Taylor, of Blackheath, at
six miles (28-42). He was among eight runners who then broke clear,
covering the next two miles in 9-45. But a further increase in tempo, in
which the leaders reached 10 miles in 48-01, dropped Fleming, and last
year's winner, Mark Flint, off the back.
Three Kenyans, a Tanzanian, and a Russian were left at the front,
fighting a tremendous battle in the baking heat. The smart money was on
Joseph Kibor, known to the sport's cognoscenti who recognised him as the
Kenyan who sold his goat to raise money in order to qualify for the 1990
Commonwealth Games, where he finished fifth in the 10,000 metres.
But Kibor has had a hamstring injury recently, and it was another
Kenyan, Maritim, who broke clear, sprinting past the Russian, Leonid
Shvetsov, in the final quarter mile, to collect the #2000 first prize.
Maritim is based in Germany, where he is training for the Berlin
Marathon. He has a best half marathon time of 61-26, and a fastest
marathon of 2-11-50, from Orlando, earlier this year.
The 30-year-old has a 10-acre tea and fruit farm, at Kericho, which
lies at 5500 feet in the Rift Valley. ''No, I didn't run miles to school
every day. I went to boarding school. But I always loved running.''
The third finisher, Christopher Ndome, a Kenyan soldier, is just 21,
but already has clocked 13-20 for 5000m. ''I ran 10,000 metres to and
from school every day,'' said Ndome, who was national schools
cross-country champion. Much more will be heard of this youngster who
was running the distance for the first time.
It was left to the women to spare their country from complete
embarrassment -- and it was one of their very own, Vikki McPherson, from
the City of Glasgow Club, who saved the day, the only home runner to
feature among the medals in a race dominated by overseas and English
runners.
McPherson, team captain for the Commonwealth Games where she finished
fifth in the 10,000m last year, took third with a performance of
considerable personal satisfaction.
Firaya Sultanova, a former physical education teacher from
Naberezhnye, in Tatarstan (an independent state within Russia) won by
five seconds from an Estonian, Jane Salumae. But McPherson eased home
ahead of Suzanne Rigg, who had outsprinted her for fourth on the track
in Victoria. This run was worth a total of #1300 to accountant McPherson
-- #800 for third, plus #500 as leading Scot.
It also should earn her place in the UK team for the world half
marathon championships in France this autumn. Her employers, Arthur
Andersen, have agreed to give her every assistance to make the 10,000m
at the Alanta Olympics next year, including cancellation of late working
which saw her form slump earlier this year.
Commonwealth internationalist Karen Macleod was fifth, suffering from
nerve damage which makes her left foot go ''dead'' during races, and
which caused her to withdraw from the world championships. Trudi
Thomson, leading Briton in the Gothenburg marathon two weeks ago, showed
outstanding powers of recovery, running within two seconds of her best
to place seventh. Details:
Men: S Maritim (Kenya) 62min 46sec; 2, L Shvetsov (Russia) 62-51; 3, C

THE kick-off of the Tennent's Premiership on September 2 brought a
mixture of formal matches and coaching-session clashes on Saturday, and
has concentrated minds wonderfully -- some of them.
Famous when coach of GHK for noting the propensity of players to go
ski-ing in mid-season, Brian Gilbert, now at Glasgow Southern, commented
after a training spin with Glasgow Accies: ''The season now begins in
effect in mid-July, but some of the boys are off on holiday.''
Currie have shaken off any gloom at missing the cut for Division 1.
''I haven't a word of criticism for Saturday's performance,'' said coach
Bruce McNaughton. ''We're progressing well.'' Currie had just beaten
Musselburgh, who will play in Division 3, by 92-5.
For most clubs in the upper echelons, a southern hemisphere
representation is a sine qua non, but not at Musselburgh, who regarded
Saturday's events as a blip after a midweek training session against
Stewart's Melville. Their midfield general, Cliff Livingston, was on
holiday.
Club president Gordon McLanaghan made the point that Musselburgh will
rely on home-produced players. ''We prefer to stick with boys who've
come through the ranks rather than sicken them with imports,'' he said.
There will be plenty of New Zealanders in the West. Kilmarnock, who
were outgunned by GHK in a training spin, will have three in Ned
Carswell and Philip Gordon, who return to Bellsland, and newcomer Jason
Sharp. They also could have Brian Whittle, more used to whizzing round
the 400 metres track and who has been training with Kilmarnock.
GHK looked impressive with all their big guns on view apart from Shade
Munro, who had a groin operation in July. Blind-side flanker Andy Ness
reappeared after a two-year gap because of injury. ''Bloody tough,'' was
his comment. Winger Gerry Hawkes justified the faith of many Herald
Selector Rugby analysts by dotting down numerous tries.
Kirkcaldy rehearsed the open game they expect will pay-off on the big
parks of Division 3, as they won 56-10 at Moray.

ONE of the most common little phrases around just now is: ''Don't we
live in interesting times?'' And, my goodness, don't we just.
But if you were a Scottish international rugby player, you would be
mighty confused right now.
I believe that the SRU have to come up with a reasonable sum if the
players are to be paid what they are worth, but every indication is that
they will not do so, and that is bound to cause conflict.
Last Monday the players met with Freddie McLeod and Jim Telfer, and it
became immediately apparent that the sum was to be nowhere near #35,000,
and that there would have to be contracts involved, and, above all, the
players realised that they were disorganised.
It is absolutely stupid of the players if they are disorganised. They
went into the meeting without their agent, Ian McLauchlan, because he
wasn't allowed to be there, and it would appear to me that the SRU are
terrified that the world of the agent starts to encroach into the rugby
scene.
It didn't take a genius to work out that, even if the union paid 50
players an average of #5000 a head, then they would have to find a
quarter of a million quid.
On top of that, it doesn't take even a dunderheid to work out that if
the top squad, say 25, want to earn a living wage from rugby -- and the
SRU are to be the major source -- then the SRU has to find a whole lot
more money.
I would expect many of the players to take an offer of #5000 as a bit
of an insult. Frankly, even if it went up to #15,000, it still is an
insult.
It all depends on your definition of a living wage, and whether you
think that an international rugby player is worth more or less than that
living wage. Is a living wage #15,000, or #40,000? More? Less?
For a top lawyer in town it might be a quarter of a million quid, and
the same for a top accountant or a banker. Likewise a businessman. For a
doctor it could be #50,000, or more, and a dentist more still.
I happen to come from the school of thought that believes that a top
rugby player is worth more than the rest of them put together. A rugby
player, like a boxer, footballer, runner, or a baseball player, is paid
for what he achieves on the pitch. If he is no good, then he does not
get picked. If he is no good, then he fails, and he fails publicly,
sometimes humiliatingly.
I find it inconceivable that the bloke who fills your teeth could earn
more than Craig Chalmers. But he does, as does the bloke who gives you a
prescription for pills when you have a throat infection.
I would burst into tears if I was told that some high-flying corporate
finance-type banker earning a hundred thousand quid was getting more
than Gavin Hastings. But he will be. And I would beat the cushion to
death if someone said that some lawyer earning eighty thousand quid was
getting more than Kenny Milne. And I am sure that he will be.
You see, I know for a fact that there are players in the international
squad who are earning in the region of #10,000 a year from their
full-time jobs. I have nothing against high-fliers, but they are just
not worth the same as top sportsmen. It's impossible.
Frankly, it's a flaming disgrace. The time has got to come right now
when rugby players appreciate that they are in a negotiating position
with the SRU . . . and they have to get negotiating.
And they have to get negotiating with one voice. It is simply not good
enough of any of the rugby authorities of the world, even the SRU --
and, believe me, we all appreciate that the SRU have financial
constraints -- to say that there is only so much they can afford to pay
the players. They have to go out and get some more.
I don't know who's in charge of it but if they aren't getting in
enough sponsorship money, then they should be replaced by someone who
can.
The time has come for rugby players to realise what they are worth.
Like all sportsmen and women they give us, the watching public, more joy
than any of the big wigs with cash ever did.
It is time they were paid their true value. And that is incalculable.

INTERNATIONAL scrum half Gary Armstrong has passed the first test in
the fight to win back his Scotland place with flying colours.
Yesterday, in a charity match at Bangholm, Trinity Academicals' ground
in Edinburgh, Armstrong played his first game of full contact rugby
since suffering a devastating injury to his left knee almost exactly a
year ago.
Armstrong, 28, last played in the 1994 Scotland game against Ireland
when he damaged thumb ligaments. However, it was in a training injury at
the start of last season that he sustained the knee damage which
required reconstructive surgery, prolonged physiotherapy and 4[1/2]
months off work.
Yesterday's game, between a Trinity Academicals invitation XV and an
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Invitation XV, was in memory of Accies' player
Dr Calum Guthrie who died, aged 29, of a brain haemorrhage while on a
skiing holiday in France earlier this year.
The game, which attracted a crowd of around 2500, raised over #8000
for the medical charity Scottish Orthopaedic Trust into Trauma.
Armstrong was obviously short of match fitness, but all of the old
touches were still there.
He sniped around the fringes and pulled off some gigantic cover
tackles almost as if he had never been away.
His try -- laid on by the recently retired Scotland captain Gavin
Hastings -- was greeted with the loudest cheer of the afternoon and, in
a break from signing scores of autographs, the Jed-Forest man said:
''The knee is fine. It's the wind that's the problem.
''I needed a day like today just to prove to myself that the medics
were right when they said the kneee would stand up to it, and it has.
''I played a 20-minute contact session with the club on Thursday night
but this was a real test today.
''I've no doubt that I'll be stiff in the morning but there don't seem
to be any ill effects at all.''
The game, which was a seriously contested affair and not at all an
exhibition match, also attracted Scotland stars past and present. On
parade were the Hastings brothers, Stewart Campbell, Peter Wright, Jim
Calder, John Beattie, Derek Turnbull and Kenny Milne.
Armstrong added: ''They reckon that the left knee will be better than
the good one and the main thing today was to get over the mental hurdle
of coming back to play real rugby after being away for so long.
''I've said that I want my Scotland place back and that's my main aim
but I'm just taking each game as it comes. I've looked forward too often
in the past and been disappointed.
''But the game is changing now off the field. There's the
International Board meeting in Paris this week when they will decide
whether to pay the players or not, and I have to admit that it would be
nice to come back with a nest-egg for when you're finished.
''However, I'm just taking it one game at a time and I'm determined to
get back into the top flight.
''I lost my way a wee bit when I said a couple of years ago that I
didn't want to play at scrum half but I think I'm coming back now
hungrier than ever,'' said Armstrong.
For the record, the Trinity Academical select ran out winners 72-59, a
plea from Gavin Hastings -- who like most of the Scotland stars was on
the losing side -- that the announcer give out some duff scoreline,
going unheeded!
* NATAL captain and number eight Gary Teichmann was named on Saturday
as the only new cap in the South African side to play Wales at Ellis
Park on September 2.
Teichmann, who toured Argentina in 1993 and Scotland and Wales last
year without making the test side, takes over the number eight shirt
from provincial team mate Mark Andrews who reverts to his usual position
of lock in place of the injured Hannes Strydom. Banned hooker James
Dalton returns in place of Chris Rossouw. Team:
Andre Joubert; James Small, Japie Mulder, Hennie le Roux, Chester
Williams; Joel Stransky, Joost van der Westhuizen; Gary Teichmann, Ruben
Kruger, Francois Pienaar (captain), Mark Andrews, Kobus Wiese, Balie
Swart, James Dalton, Os du Randt.

NEALE Dougan and Chris Woods scored an emotional first outright
victory on Saturday's McRae Motorsport Stages Rally, the penultimate
round of this year's national Burmah Scottish Rally Championship.
The Ayr garage proprietor was in command from the start of the
high-speed, 45 mile event based in the Tweed Valley.
But former British champion David Gillanders staged a dramatic
fight-back and closed the gap to one second as they approached the final
stage.
Sadly, a thrilling duel was denied the spectating thousands when
Gillanders' Ford Escort broke its suspension and he was passed for
second place by John Baird, but managed to hang on to third ahead of
Chris Wagner.
Wagner therefore retains the lead in the Scottish championship with
one round to go, but Gillanders and Baird are still within reach.
Results:
1, Neale Dougan/Chris Woods (Ford Escort Cosworth) 44mins 46sec; 2,
John Baird/Martin Forrest (Ford Escort Cosworth) 44:59; 3, David
Gillanders/John Bennie (Ford Escort Cosworth) 45:22; 4, Chris

ITALY'S Luca Cadalora beat world champion Michael Doohan, of
Australia, by four seconds yesterday, winning the Czech Grand Prix for
his first victory of the year.
Cadalora, aboard his Yamaha, started fourth on the grid and moved his
way up before finally taking control over the final 11 laps.
''Luca and the Yamaha were working exceptionally well and I couldn't
match them in the second half of the race,'' Doohan said.
Cadalora took the lead on the second turn of the fourteenth lap and
gradually pulled away.
The Italian said afterwards he could not close the gap with Doohan
early in the race.
''Then I saw that Mick was starting to slide and I said, 'OK, now's
the time to go for it.' I caught and passed him, no problem. But even
then I wasn't sure I could get away.''
Doohan, riding a Honda, still increased his championship lead to 19
points over countryman Darryl Beattie, who finished another five seconds
back and remained second in the points chase.
''Basically, I blew the start,'' Beattie said. ''I tried as hard as I
could ... by the time I got some clear laps there wasn't a lot I could
do about the guys in front.''

MARTIN O'Neill is bracing himself for the toughest battle of his
career -- getting Norwich City straight back into the top flight.
After opening with an impressive defeat of Luton, the East Anglians
were lucky to keep a point at home to Sunderland.
''It was very disappointing but this is a very difficult league to get
out of. That might not have been brought home to the players after the
Luton match but they'll certainly be in no doubt about it now,'' said
O'Neill.
''There are at least 16 teams who will feel they have a genuine chance
of going up and it's going to be a long, hard slog.''
A flurry of red cards backed up his assessment, with five players
given their marching orders.
Two went in Grimsby's 2-1 home victory over Portsmouth, the visitors'
Paul Durnin for dissent, followed by Mariners' goalkeeper Paul Crichton
for a foul.
Dean Gordon was dismissed in the clash between two more Premiership
drop-outs, Ipswich shading Crystal Palace 1-0 at Portman Road.
And Luton had Ceri Hughes dismissed after just 10 minutes at Southend
-- but still won 1-0.
Millwall, 1-0 winners at Port Vale courtesy of a Kerry Dixon goal, top
the table and are the only team in the division with a 100% record.

CUMNOCK, promoted from the second division of the Ayrshire league, and
looking to re-establish themselves as one of the main forces in junior
football, had some measure of their progress on Saturday when they
defeated local rivals Auchinleck Talbot 2-1 in the Scarlett Cup.
Talbot took the lead in the sixth minute when Jim McGuire scored, but
Cumnock equalised in 11 minutes with a Norman Montgomery header and went
2-1 ahead, courtesy of a goal by Duncan Sinclair, their recent signing
from Pollok.
Kilbirnie, undefeated this season, had a convincing win over Beith
with goals from new juvenile signing Andy Cool and Alex Eadie. Beith's
counter from Craig Shaughnessy came too late to affect the outcome of
the game.
Striker Milton Thompson gave Irvine Meadow a share of the points
against Kilwinning Rangers, who finished the game with eight men
following the dismissals of Sloan, Harkness and Cockburn.
In the Abercorn Builders League Cup, Arthurlie bounced back from a
shock 3-2 midweek defeat by Benburb to beat Pollok 3-0.
A crowd of 1500 watched Arthurlie take the lead just on half-time with
a header by Donaghy from a cross by new signing Scott Archer.
Anderson made it two with a 20-yard shot which keeper Lowrie should
have saved, and with Arthurlie down to 10 men following the dismissal of
striker McDonald, that man Archer ran 50 yards to lay on a third score
by ex-Pollok player Rocky Crichton.
Maryhill took their goals tally to 13 in three games with a 3-2
victory over St Roch's with a Richie McCusker double and a goal from
Neil Watt.
Vale of Clyde and Shettleston will meet in a section decider in the
Abercorn Cup in midweek, following their victories at the weekend. Vale
beat Glencairn 1-0 while a Paddy Kelly goal gave Shettleston a win over
Cambuslang Rangers.
Baillieston's early-season form continued when they beat Bellshill
3-1. Nixon scored from a corner in the first minute and Martin made it
2-0 at half-time. Woods scored a third from the penalty spot before
McGuinness pulled one back later on.
In the East region, Linlithgow (2-1) and Newtongrange (5-0) kept up
their 100% record with respective wins over Bathgate and Arniston.
Armadale have also started well and had a fine 3-2 win over Whitburn.
OVD Cup holders Camelon, despite losing full back Smith and winger
McKenzie to Alloa in the close season, continued their run with a 2-1
victory over Bonnybridge. Jim Ellis and Davie Flynn were the scorers in
their Skol league cup tie.
Hill o' Beath again will be the team to beat in Fife. They remain
undefeated this season.

RARELY does one Saturday afternoon confirm quite so many anticipated
trends as the first 90 minutes of the Premier League season did.
Here were Liverpool, Newcastle, Blackburn, Leeds, and Nottingham
Forest, all off to a flier, with goals from Stan Collymore, Les
Ferdinand, Alan Shearer, Tony Yeboah, and Bryan Roy respectively.
Here were Bolton, Southampton, Coventry, and West Ham, all beaten and
rather anxiously looking at the fixture list for the rest of a difficult
opening week.
There was a surprise. It was the emphatic manner in which Manchester
United were taken apart by Aston Villa in the first 45 minutes of their
3-1 defeat -- a result that nevertheless failed to qualify as shattering
for those who had read the runes of United's troubled summer.
Injuries and suspensions affecting Cole, Giggs, Bruce, and Cantona
further depleted a squad severely weakened by Ferguson's summer sales,
thrusting names like O'Kane and Beckham into the fray. ''What the squad
we had today lacks is big-game experience,'' said the manager. ''But
don't blame the youngsters. In the second half we played excellently.''
Collymore scored the sort of goal against Sheffield Wednesday at
Anfield that Liverpool paid #8.5m for. Robbie Fowler, scorer of 31 goals
last season, was left on the bench to accommodate him, but must be
expected to replace the ageing Ian Rush with increased regularity.
Ferdinand produced an equally impressive debut goal for Newcastle, one
of three in a comfortable home victory over Coventry.
Blackburn's progress towards a 1-0 victory over QPR (with a Shearer
penalty) was interrupted by the sending-off of their England goalkeeper
Tim Flowers for bringing down Trevor Sinclair 18 minutes from the end.
Fortunately, new manager Ray Harford had decided to have a substitute
goalkeeper rather than the three outfield players now permitted, and
replacement Bobby Mimms kept a clean sheet.
Leeds United's Howard Wilkinson, worried about whether three of his
defenders would last for 90 minutes, dispenses with a goalkeeper and
used all 14 men in a deserved 2-1 victory over West Ham at Upton Park.
Yeboah, the Ghanaian who was on loan for the second half of last
season, scored both goals and was rewarded with the accolade from
Wilkinson that ''I wouldn't swop hime for anyone. At #3.4m, buying him
was an unbelievable piece of business.''
Roy scored twice for Nottingham Forest in a 4-3 victory at
Southampton.
The home team's Matthew Le Tissier replied with a hat trick, including
two penalties, and it looks as if he may once again stand between
Southampton and relegation.
After some half-pace friendlies, Chelsea's Ruud Gullit was exposed to
the real thing -- Duncan Ferguson and all -- in a goalless draw with
Everton.

Arsenal 1, Middlesbrough 1
MIDDLESBROUGH foiled Arsenal's expensive signings Dennis Bergkamp and
David Platt to plunder a point from Highbury.
All Arsenal's second-half domination counted for nothing as former
Gunners' reserve keeper Alan Miller pulled off two brilliant saves from
Bergkamp and an even better tip-over from Ian Wright.
Despite a disappointing debut by England captain Platt, Arsenal showed
promise, but they could not find the break they needed as Boro, who gave
as good as they got in the first half, unashamedly shut up shop after
the break.
It had taken a breathtaking goal by Boro's #5.75m signing Nick Barmby
to bring Arsenal back to the harsh reality of Premiership combat after
all the pre-match hype over the Bergkamp-Platt signings.
Barmby silenced Highbury in 31 minutes after a lightning link-up with
Norwegian Jan Aage Fjortoft. Arsenal's reply, though, was not long in
coming, with Ray Parlour forcing his way through on the bye-line from
the right and providing a perfect cross for Wright to head home five
minutes later.
Merson almost gave the Gunners the lead two minutes from half-time
with a lob that cleared the crossbar by inches with Miller well beaten.
Arsenal stepped up a gear at the start of the second half and Boro
were fully stretched to survive some sharp attacks led by Bergkamp and
Merson. But Arsenal still lack a productive passer in midfield and
despite their mountain of possession after the break, it was Boro's Neil
Cox who went closest to scoring a winner.
The full back moved upfield with a powerful solo run, only to drag his
shot across the goalmouth and wide.

RANGERS chairman David Murray's call for a European League to be
established received support yesterday from PSV Eindhoven. Harry ven
Raaij, financial director at the Dutch club, insisted such a set-up had
to happen to prevent the balance of power swinging irrevocably to Italy,
Germany, and Spain.
''At the moment it is impossible for a clubs like PSV Eindhoven, which
has not been in the Champions' League for a few years, to continue the
fight against clubs from these countries,'' said ven Raaij. ''The
difference lies in the distribution of money from television.
''We receive far less, sometimes only a tenth of what those in bigger
countries, are paid. This cannot be allowed to continue and there are
only two solutions.
''One is to set up a European League, where all clubs are paid the
same from TV then we can compete on more favourable terms. If a European
League does not happen, and there is widespread support for it
throughout the Continent, then smaller countries must join their leagues
together.
''If Holland and Belgium united, this would provide greater
competition on the field and a broader and more attractive commercial
base.''
Murray has predicted that a European League will be formed within five
years and this is currently being considered by UEFA.
* RONALD Koeman will this week agree to come out of international
retirement to help Holland qualify for the European Championship finals.
The player quit after the World Cup in the USA, but Holland are in
such disarray, having to win their last three ties to have any hope of
reaching England next summer, that he has relented.
However, his impending return has angered Danny Blind, who succeeded
him as captain. ''I am finished with Holland if this happens,'' the Ajax
defender insists. ''This is a real slap in the face for me and is
totally unnecessary.''
* MARCO Van Basten's sad and premature end to his career has been
blamed on referees who failed to protect him. His father, Joop, a former
striker with Utrecht, said: ''Half the defenders he faced were not
interested in the ball -- only his legs.
''Marco has been kicked out of football because referees were unable
to keep the game clean.''
Van Basten, who has expressed an interest in staying in football as a
coach, said that his ultimate ambition was to take charge of Holland in
partnership with Ruud Gullit.
* BELGIUM will open their King Baouduin Stadium, the replacement for
the ill-fated Heysel, on Wednesday night with a friendly against
Germany.
But the real focus of attention will be on Anderlecht, and how they
fare against Ferencvaros in their Champions' League preliminary match in
Budapest. Trailing 1-0, Anderlecht sacked new coach Herbert Neumann
after three successive defeats.
The veteran Raymond Goethals has been restored as technical director,
with Jean Dockx to assist him, in the hope that he can guide Anderlecht
through for a fourth time to the Champions' League, a feat no other club
in Europe has yet achieved.
Despite the wealth which has been generated, Anderlecht still have
been unable to hold on to their best players such as Albert, Degryse,
and Nilis and are further away than ever from being a major power.
Unless Goethals can persuade Anderlecht to change their transfer
policy and bring in top foreigners, they will remain bit players in
Europe.
* FORMER Real Madrid striker Emilio Butragueno has signed for AL
Selaya, of Mexico. The Spanish champions also have sold another striker,
Alfonso, to Betis Seville for #2m.
* BORA Milutinovic is back in charge of Mexico, replacing Migual Mejia
Baron, sacked after the abortive challenge for the Copa America.
Miluntinovic guided his country to the World Cup quarter-finals when
it hosted the event in 1986. His first task will be to persuade
eccentric keeper Jorge Campos to return to the fold. He quit the
international team as a protest at the dismissal of Baron.
* RICHARD Moller-Nielsen will quit as soon as Denmark's interest in
the European Championship is ended. Morten Olsen, currently with
Cologne, is expected to succeed him as national coach.

East Stirlingshire 0, Dundee 6
(Wieghorst, Hamilton, McCann 4)
SEB Coe that brilliant exponent of the blistering finish once said
that on the track you cannot hide from speed. Brockville on Saturday
provided few hiding places for a ponderous East Stirling outfit as they
were caught in the slipstream of the Dundee jet.
Before the kick-off hopes ran high among the home support that their
team's good form in the previous round against Clyde might carry over
into this second-round Coca-Cola cup-tie against Dundee. Long before the
final whistle these hopes had been dashed as the Jim Duffy's men
ruthlessly exposed the gap between the third and first divisions.
This is not to say that East Stirling are a poor side. Billy Little's
men have clearly benefited from the former Pittodrie star's wide
knowledge of the game and will have learned much from Saturday's
experience.
Every one of Dundee's six goals could be entered as a candidate for
goal of the month award. A classy finish by Morten Wieghorst in five
minutes and a delightful swerving free kick from Jim Hamilton six
minutes later had put the visitors on easy street. Thereafter the crowd
was treated to a virtuoso scoring performance by Neil McCann as the
speedy young forward knocked in four beauties to earn himself a #500
bonus.
A word of advice to Wieghorst, who was booked for persistent fouling.
The big fellow is a class player who can only reduce his effectiveness
by getting involved in such distractions.

Aberdeen 3, St Mirren 1
SCOTT Booth fired Aberdeen into the next round of the Coca-Cola Cup
and himself into international contention with two of the Dons goals in
their 3-1 victory over St Mirren.
He had to sit on the sidelines all last season after suffering a groin
injury while scoring the goal which earned Scotland a draw against
Russia last November. ''Obviously getting back into Craig Brown's plans
is one of my main aims but my first priority is to score goals for
Aberdeen,'' he said.
''I would like to think there was possibility of being included for
the game against Finland next month but because of what happened last
season it makes me a little bit cautious about plans for the future. If
I can play well for Aberdeen for the next three or four games you never
know -- I'll just keep trying. It has been a very difficult time for me
and my family and I hope all that is behind me now.''
He said there was a very positive atmosphere in the Aberdeen dressing
room and he felt that for parts of the St Mirren game they showed what
they were capable of. He expected them to begin to show real flair as
the season progressed and he saw no likelihood of last year's problems
recurring.
Aberdeen got off to a shaky start reminiscent of their performances
last year which sent them to the brink of relegation and went a goal
down in 22 minutes to the first division visitors from Paisley. St
Mirren created all the early chances and went ahead with a stunning
overhead kick by Barry McLaughlin.
Aberdeen's immediate reaction was frenzied and resulted in bookings
for Miller, McKimmie, and Jess before Dodds settled them by confidently
slipping the ball past keeper Campbell Money as he advanced and his
team-mates protested offside.
Aberdeen then took control. Before the break Booth got his head to the
end of a Miller cross for the second. Aberdeen's third was a gift from
Money in 52 minutes. The keeper tried to pass to his defender Law but
Booth intercepted and rounded Money to chip the ball into the net and
earn Aberdeen a third-round tie against Falkirk.
With 11 minutes to go McLaughlin was sent off after being booked for
the second time.
Dutchman Etienne Verveer, who has signed a one-month contract with
Aberdeen to allow manager Roy Aitken to assess him, substituted for
McKinnon and during his brief spell showed glimpses of the pace,
strength and passing ability which has attracted Aitken.
Teenage defender Craig Ireland also made his competitive debut because
of injuries to Gary Smith and Colin Woodthorpe and Aberdeen were without
the suspended Duncan Shearer.
Theo Snelders, who walked out of Pittodrie before last week's friendly
against Coventry, was back in goal but sections of the crowd made it
clear they were unimpressed by his loyalty.
Aitken admitted they didn't get off to a good start but was pleased
how they battled to get back into the game.

Raith Rovers 2, Arbroath 1
MENTION Raith Rovers and the Coca-Cola Cup in the same breath, and
penalty kicks inevitably spring to mind. Having upset the odds by
lifting the silverware in that dramatic shoot-out against Celtic at
Ibrox last season, Jimmy Nicholl's men again had to rely on penalties to
eliminate lowly Arbroath from the second round at Starks Park on
Saturday.
This time, however, it was two spot kick conversions by David Kirkwood
on either side of another penalty by Steve McCormick during the
regulation 90 minutes which saw Rovers through to a repeat of last
season's final against Celtic at Parkhead in the third round.
Kirkwood, who missed out on a cup-winner's medal because of injury,
was only playing due to the absence of Stephen McAnespie, who underwent
a cartilage operation earlier in the week.
''We should have killed Arbroath off in the first 20 minutes and
losing a goal just before half-time gave us the jolt we needed,'' said
Kirkwood. ''We totally controlled the second half, and were never in any
danger of losing.
''We are looking to go as far as we can in our defence, and it would
be a big disappointment if we went out in the early rounds.''
With the second leg of Raith's UEFA Cup-tie against Gotu Itrottarfelag
to come tomorrow, and Celtic due in Kirkcaldy on Saturday as the premier
division gets under way, Jimmy Nicholl is anxious to eliminate the type
of defensive errors of which his side was guilty against Arbroath.
''We have to guard against being too casual at the back, or we are
going to suffer for it,'' said the Raith manager. ''It was a little
reminder to us how troublesome teams can be if you do not give them the
respect they deserve. Arbroath gave as good as they got for the first
hour, but after that we should have had more goals.''
Nicholl has unearthed a real crowd-pleaser in 24-year-old Trinidad and
Tobago internationalist Tony Rougier. He was a constant threat to the
Arbroath defence and with more composure in front of goal, might have
claimed a hat trick.
''He is one of the most exciting players I have seen for a long
time,'' said Nicholl. ''He has got great ability and although he has
still to be tested at the highest level, he could prove quite a handful
for a lot of premier division defences.''
There was never any danger of Arbroath repeating their shock victory
over Raith in the same competition two seasons ago. Although Saturday's
result looks close on paper, Arbroath manager John Brogan was under no
illusions.
''We were murdered 2-1,'' he admitted. ''Our keeper made a couple of
great saves or it could have been four or five. ''The two penaltied we
conceded were schoolboy errors, but although we made a lot of mistakes,
we took a great deal out of the game.''

Berwick 0, Partick Thistle 7
THE sceptics had that knowing look. If there was going to be an upset
in the Coca-Cola Cup, they claimed, then Shielfield could well be the
place.
The Jags minus Lambie and players refusing to resign -- added to the
thought that the home lot were no mugs and positively frugal at the back
-- gave the doubters a field day.
Even the red-and-yellow brigade as they trudged through the old Border
town looked strangely apprehensive, as though fearing that what happened
to Rangers when Adam was a youngster -- Berwick turning them over in a
cup tie -- could happen again on this warm, sunny afternoon.
They should have known better of course. Partick Thistle playing to
the script, how absurd. The only surprise was that Thistle had not gone
into double figures in goals, such was their superiority after a nervy
opening 15 minutes.
Nicky Walker dropped a cross in three minutes, the Thistle defence at
first looked ponderous, missing tackles, and Thistle chairman Jim Oliver
fidgeted in his seat. But after 18 minutes the Jags were off and running
when Albert Craig connected with a header from Grant Tierney for goal
No.1. Soon it was obvious that it was a case of how many, with Craig
again, Derek McWilliams (two), Rod McDonald, Steve Pittman, and Harry
Curran adding to the fun.
Manager Murdo MacLeod looked chuffed. ''Their attitude, football, and
finishing were really good,'' he said.
MacLeod has been at Firhill for just five minutes, but already his
style of play has started to come through. ''There is now backing from
midfield,'' said the manager. ''The problem was that everyone wanted to
charge forward, but that has changed.''
He had praise for everyone, not least Ian Cameron, perhaps the most
gifted player on the Firhill payroll.
The man was swift to smile, but this is a worrying time for him. He is
in search of stable employment, there is no doubt that Thistle need him,
but they appear reluctant to produce, in Cameron's eyes, a worthwhile
contract. This seems a little short-sighted.
To unearth a player with Cameron's ability will not only be difficult
but could cause no little concern to the bank manager.
''The club haven't been forthcoming with an offer,'' said Cameron,
''so I'll just have to wait to the end of the month to see what
happens.'' By this time the smile had gone.

Some might view it as a classic case of sour grapes. That, however,
would be an unfair label for Charlie Duncan's measured, but scathing
attack on the Highland League Cup set-up.
The Fraserburgh manager condemned the cup's four geographical
first-round sections even before Saturday's disaster at Deveronvale
ended his side's interest. His club's 2-0 defeat allowed Cove into the
semi-finals with a 6-2 win against Buckie.
The Broch manager claims the system of first-round district group
matches is devaluing the 50-year-old trophy. He said: ''It takes away
from the event. Cup football should be all about rising to the big
occasion in a one-off match.''
Cove leapfrogged Fraserburgh in the Aberdeen-shire section with a 6-2
drubbing of Buckie. Their semi-final opponents will be Elgin City. And
Clach lined up a semi-final clash with Huntly despite going down 2-1 to
Wick Academy.
Huntly continued their 100% record with a 2-0 win at home to
Peterhead.

FOOTBALL managers could yet become involved in settling transfer fee
disputes. The directors of both Motherwell and Hamilton will be holding
separate board meetings this week to discuss the outcome of transfer
tribunals last week.
It is likely they will ask for a comprehensive review of the tribunal
system.
Motherwell are still angry that they will get just #110,000 for
defender Rab Shannon from Dundee, and Hamilton are bewildered at the
#135,000 price on striker Peter Duffield, now with Airdrie.
Motherwell directors will consider whether there should be a place on
the tribunal for a club manager, but it is believed that Hamilton will
consider a plan which takes that a step further. That suggests club
managers should meet to decide on a player's valuation with two from the
division of the player involved and one each from the other divisions.
That valuation would either be final or could be used as a
recommendation.

Hearts 3, Alloa 0
AN inspirational performance from Scott Leitch in Hearts' victory over
Alloa could result in he and Alan Lawrence teaming up at Tynecastle
instead of crossing in opposite directions.
Just 24-hours before the home Coca-Cola Cup second-round tie at
Tynecastle, the midfield player had been invited to join Airdrie, as
replacement for Lawrence.
However, he rejected the chance to drop down a division and signed a
one month contract on Saturday morning, with a two-year agreement likely
to ensue.
Airdrie want #80,000 for the former Dundee and Meadowbank striker, and
that overstretches Jim Jefferies' budget, but Leitch may have a solution
for this.
His composure and incisive use of the ball from midfield, not to
mention an eighty-fourth minute goal, was rewarded with a home
third-round tie against Dunfermline next week.
That has all the potential of producing a capacity 16,000 crowd, which
could raise sufficient funds to allow the Edinburgh club to embark on
the first stage of the tribunal procedure.
Against gritty but outclassed opponents, Jefferies was looking for a
leader, and Leitch's happiness to take responsibility was rewarded with
a warm reception when he departed three minutes after his goal.
''It was tremendous to hear the reaction of the supporters after what
had been a crazy 48-hours before the game,'' he reflected.
''It was flattering to have another club express an interest in me,
but I've been two seasons at Hearts and want to continue playing at this
level.
''There's been a lot of upheaval at the club while I've been here, but
I feel the team deserves credit for holding together well.
''We've had a good pre-season and on Saturday should have had a few
more goals to show for our efforts.
''I certainly didn't have a conventional or welcome preparation for
the game, but I had a professional job to do and it's always great when
the fans appreciate your efforts.''
Brian Hamilton led the way with a fierce 25-yard drive after only ten
minutes, and Dave McPherson turned in an Alan Johnston cross five
minutes after the interval.
The Leitch goal, which brought the home supporters to a crescendo, saw
him bewilder the Alloa defence before nipping round keeper Paul Graham
to find the empty net.
Hearts' well-documented troubles off the field persist, but they can
now be eased to one side, if not repaired, by Jefferies and his
rejuvenated team.
The former club skipper and centre half has swiftly produced a team
spirit that has been Hearts' hallmark for decades, and Saturday's
victory follows the 5-1 friendly defeat of Manchester City.
The sequence of fixtures has also fallen kindly for them, for they
face Motherwell and Falkirk at home on either side of Dunfermline's
visit in the next two weeks.
That offers the possibility of a confidence-giving run of matches and
much needed turnstyle income to ease the pressure of day to day cash
flow problems.

St Johnstone 1, Livingston 1
Livingston won 4-2 on penalties a.e.t.
SCOTLAND'S newest football club put itself firmly on the map as
Livingston pulled through a tense penalty shoot-out to pile on the
problems for St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock.
The dramatic conclusion to a game dominated by the punchless Perth
team signalled the return of one-time Dunfermline manager Jim Leishman
to a grander stage, following a spell in the wings with Rosyth juniors.
The bespectacled would-be poet laureate of Scottish football is
well-versed in the fluctuating fortunes of the game, and he was happy to
wax lyrical about international notables Horace Stoute and Dave Alleyne,
who did more than most to set up a home tie -- albeit at Meadowbank --
against Partick Thistle.
Barbados-born goalkeeper Stoute answered his manager's exaggerated
touchline prayers with two decisive saves in a 4-2 penalty kick contest.
A delighted Leishman said: ''Horace and Dave left behind their
families, their friends and their country to come to Scotland -- and a
result like this makes it all worthwhile.
Livingston, who won't be ushered into their new town ground until the
autumn, rode their luck after a George O'Boyle goal levelled an early
opener from Lee Bailley. Troubled Perth manager Paul Sturrock groaned:
''We seem to have a death wish.''
Livingston ace Stoute, who admitted his biggest cultural challenge
since coming to Scotland was comprehending his manager's broad Fife
accent, said: ''I can't remember the last time I saved a penalty, but I
told my buddy Dave I would stop at least one.''
He admitted the controversy accompanying Meadowbank Thistle's
transformation into Livingston hadn't quite reached his Caribbean home,
where English and Italian football enjoy high profiles -- but news of
his Coca-Cola Cup exploits certainly would. He said: ''I'm sending all
the cuttings back to Barbados.''
The former soldier, enticed to Scotland by club chairman Bill Hunter,
admitted the summer heatwave suited him down to the ground.
A goalkeeper more accustomed to temperatures in the nineties said:
''This was a cool day for me. In fact, I went out for the warm-up
wearing a T-shirt, goalkeeper's jersey, and a sweatshirt. The guys said
I would burn up, but I was very comfortable.''

Ayr United 0, Celtic 3
CELTIC look set to mount a serious challenge to their old rivals
Rangers this season, but while a mountain of praise was rightly heaped
on foreign stars Andreas Thom and Pierre Van Hooydonk at Somerset Park
on Saturday, one man reckons that the big difference is down to John
Collins.
Ayr United player-manager Simon Stainrod was on the field for 90
minutes as Celtic eventually dismantled his side and said: ''Celtic are
a much better side than they were last season.
''The introduction of Thom has certainly given them a new dimension.
He is a tremendous player, but now that John Collins is playing at the
heart of the midfield it has made all the difference. Celtic were
getting only 50% of Collins when they played him in a wide role.
''We gave Duncan George the job of man marking Collins, and he did
well until he had to go off with an injury in the first half. After that
Collins took over and destroyed us. On the whole, Celtic did a good
professional job on us. Over the course of a season Rangers will
probably have too strong a squad, but it looks as if Celtic are now
going in the right direction.''
Collins, of course, is currently filling the role of club captain Paul
McStay, who is recovering from an ankle operation, and when he is fully
fit it will pose a difficult problem for manager Tommy Burns. But that
is still a month away, and in the meantime McStay is delighted with the
way the side is playing.
After watching the action at Somerset Park, McStay said: ''It was just
what we expected in a cup tie. We had to match Ayr for their effort in
the first half hour, but after we scored our first goal we really played
well. There was a lot of good movement and the manner in which we won
was very pleasing. Last season we would have been struggling in this
type of situation.
''We did give some convincing displays last year, but we couldn't
score goals. In fact, we were six months into the season before we
managed to score three goals in a match, against Meadowbank in the
Scottish Cup. But we have got three right away this time and a 3-0 win
away from home must be considered a good result.
''We had so many good players out there today. Tom Boyd got the
man-of-the-match award, but it could have gone to anyone. You can now
see why the gaffer brought in players such as Pierre Van Hooydonk and
Andreas Thom. They took their goals well and can only get better as they
play together more.
''Andreas is a real quality player, who has a tremendous work rate,
and I also thought Phil O'Donnell, along with Tom Boyd, was outstanding.
Phil had some great, surging runs and that was good to see. It's early
days yet, but things are looking good.''
McStay will begin light jogging today, and said: ''I'm desperate to
get back, but it looks like I am still three or four weeks away.''
Celtic looked eager to please from the moment just before the kick-off
when all their players gathered in a huddle in the centre circle -- just
like an American football side -- with their arms linked and heads down.
''I don't know what they say in there, because I haven't played,''
laughed McStay. ''I just hope one of the lads tells me before I play my
first match.''
Ayr gave a spirited display for the first half hour -- they look a
good bet for promotion from the second division -- but finally cracked
in 33 minutes when Van Hooydonk leap to knock down a free kick from Rudi
Vata, and there was Thom, waiting to slide the ball behind Billy Lamont.
Eleven minutes after the interval, Van Hooydonk took a pass from
Collins, sidestepped Frank Rolling and steered the ball low inside the
post. The scoring was completed in 65 minutes when John Sharples sent
O'Donnell tumbling in the box and Collins scored from the spot.
It is certainly a promising start for Celtic, but what now remains to
be seen is if they can find the consistency which has been lacking over
the past few seasons.

Kilmarnock 1, Dumbarton 0
(after extra time)
BECAUSE the temperature kept rising it wasn't surprising that the
goalposts took on a hazy look. Kilmarnock seemed to be aiming at a
mirage. They were seeing the outline of the woodwork as vague and
shimmering.
Misses, not all of them close, abounded. Under normal circumstances --
that is, pelting rain and chill blasts -- they might have had three
warmers in the net in the first half-hour or so.
As it was, the pain business of scoring slumbered for 116 minutes. It
took the cool intervention of Mark Roberts, Killie's third outfield
substitute, to stir the air.
After some firm pressing by Ally Mitchell and Tom Black, young Roberts
poured cold water on Dumbarton's sun-struck hopes that the tie might
drift to penalties.
Although a bumper of a decider, it was a squeak of a win. After a
mouse of a game, Kilmarnock produced a goal that roared. But they must
now have some worries about making a meek start to the championship.
''We made heavy weather of it,'' conceded Alex Totten, the manager.
While an odd metaphor to choose in the sultry circumstances, it was a
fair self-assessment.
John Henry, whose neatness, quickness, and alert running outshone the
efforts of his mates, also had the most memorable mistake.
At the interval of extra-time, he had the ball, time, and space all to
himself about 10 yards out. He appeared to measure every angle. Each
blade of grass seemed to be surveyed. He might have been taking a putt
on the eighteenth green. As is also the way of golf, he lipped the
target.
Dumbarton recovered well from a dickie start when they looked extra
vulnerable in the air.
Martin Mooney dribbled with confident delight, Ian McFarlane kept goal
with agile grace, and Jim Marsland was a terrier in defence. Chic
Charnley and Sam McGivern showed a maturing partnership until they
flagged in the heat. Men of the match were the water-carriers on both
sides.
Mighty Jim Fallon, the Sons' coach, was asked if he fancied the vacant
job of manager. After taking thought for all of half a second, he said:
''Naw.'' Realising that his response did little to help the scribes'
ink, he became almost garrulous. ''You need a personality to do that.
I'm a coach,'' he explained.

Clydebank 1, Motherwell 1
Motherwell won 4-1 on penalties a.e.t.
FROM the middle-aged to the elderly, there's always the occasional
thought that ''I've seen that before.''
Take a No.7 shirt in Clydebank colours, a laid-back 17-year-old who
skites down the right wing, suddenly leaves the full back going the
wrong way as he cuts inside, and using an educated left peg causes all
sorts of problems in the opposition area.
Then there are the in-swinging corners from the right. There are the
free kicks which have goalkeepers on tenterhooks. Davie Cooper of those
great bygone days.
Joe Robertson of the present era, at Kilbowie in the Coca-Cola Cup
against premier division Motherwell on Saturday. And as the Clydebank
supremo Jack Steedman admitted yesterday: ''The lad does remind you of
David Cooper, doesn't he? Same style. Still plenty to learn, but if he
turns out to be half as good a player, then he'll do well.''
He almost did. A fine strike after only three minutes and two hits on
the woodwork to complement those exciting runs. His feet seem still to
be on the ground, though.
He said: ''I hope some of the magic of that shirt rubs off, but at the
moment, the gaffer thinks my work rate is not enough. I'll need to work
harder.'' Coach Brian Wright agrees.
Now there's another coincidence . . . and another. Cooper never seemed
to break sweat, using sheer genius. And the dad of the man after whom
the new Clydebank stadium will be named was a guest on Saturday.
John Cooper admitted he had found it tough at the start, but
eventually settled down to enjoy an excellent game. Watching Robertson
must have been hard on him. It almost seems coincidental to mention that
Robertson had a year at Rangers as an apprentice.
Now to the match itself, which ended after extra time with the dreaded
penalty shoot-out. Where Bankies had been at the races during playing
time, coach Wright will probably give the squad penalty practice at
training this week.
The young Clydebank defence was magnificent -- Craig Tomlinson and Tom
Currie outstanding. Dougie Arnott proved that Motherwell's trip to
Finland tomorrow in the UEFA may not be as bad as they think when he
struck the equaliser, giving them hope, along with a couple of useful
performances from Tommy Coyne and Billy Davies up front.
And manager, Alex McLeish, reckons that MyPa 47 could be in for a
torrid time. ''Their home form is not that good.'' If Motherwell can
avoid their present bad habit of losing early goals, he could be right.
A couple worries, though, were the stretchering off of Eddie May with
a head knock, and Mitchell Van der Gaag with what seemed to be a bad
ankle injury.
And let's not forget the hero of the penalty shoot-out -- keeper Scott
Howie, in for the much maligned Steve Woods, blamed by many fans for the
3-1 home defeat by the Finns.
Howie saved the first two kicks in the shoot-out. Woods also, for a
change, was cheered when he had to come on as an outfield player.
Motherwell must travel again, this time to Dundee United, but they
will be hoping that the controversial referee Andrew Waddell is given
another assignment.
Mr Waddell did not have a difficult game to control, yet he still
managed to book six players. Rob McKinnon and Jamie Dolan of Motherwell,
and Craig Tomlinson and Gary Bowman of Bankies disturbed his pen first,
then the names of Clydebank's Gary Teale and Motherwell's Davies were
added.

Cowdenbeath 0, Dundee Utd 4
DUNDEE United manager Billy Kirkwood could be in trouble with the
football authorities after a touchline argument with Cowdenbeath
counterpart Tom Steven in injury time.
A one-sided contest was drawing to a conclusion when Steven took
exception to a tackle by United's international midfielder Billy
McKinlay -- ''a coward's challenge'' was what he shouted to the player.
Kirkwood then began a short verbal exchange which developed briefly into
a scene more commonly found in the school playground, with the United
manager half-removing his jacket as he moved towards the home dug-out,
but he was restrained by player-assistant, Maurice Malpas.
The standside linesman drew referee Tom Brown's attention to what may
be termed the ''dugout rage'' incident and the Edinburgh official sent
both managers to the stand for the remaining few seconds of play.
Kirkwood declined to say whether he had been reported to the
authorities over the incident, saying: ''You'll need to ask the
referee.'' Brown, tied by Scottish football's outmoded vow of silence on
such matters, said: ''You'll have to phone the SFA.''
But Steven was more forthcoming. He revealed: ''It revolved around an
incident when McKinlay put in what I called a 'coward's challenge'. They
were winning 4-0 and why that had to happen, I don't know.
''I don't think there should be any action against me.'' He added
pointedly: ''I stayed in our dugout area.''
The controversial ''gagging'' of officials continues to deprive
football supporters of information about disciplinary matters, but one
can guess that Kirkwood could be at risk of a fine, whereas Steven might
get off with a warning. But, thanks to the ''gagging'' policy, we don't
know officially if they have even been reported.
However, with a referee supervisor in attendance, and the fact that
both managers were sent to the stand, it does seem likely that a report
of the incident will have been sent to the authorities.
On the field, Kirkwood was able to welcome back McKinlay, Brian Welsh,
and Dave Bowman, all after suspension, but of greater satisfaction must
have been the two-goal performance of injury-plagued Paddy Connolly.
The man-of-the-match, who spent months on the sidelines through
injury, said: ''I'm just pleased to get my first full game for ages. As
for scoring, my last goal must have been about a year-and-a-half ago.
''I've still got a long way to go in match fitness but we have a new
manager and it's a fresh start, and I'm hoping to get a regular game
now.
''But it won't be easy. The manager is looking for another striker and
already there are four of us fighting for two places up front.''
Kirkwood said: ''First and foremost, our ambition is to get back into
the premier division.''
He also also revealed that United would listen to offers for McKinlay,
if they get any.
It was the midfielder who opened the scoring after 26 minutes when his
free kick took a deflection. Cowden then had a goal disallowed for
offside, but were 2-0 down on the half-hour when Neil Caldwell knocked
in the loose ball after a lob had put home keeper Neil Russell in
trouble.
Connolly got in on the act after the break with a 20-yard effort and
just after the hour he coolly took his time to convert the chance after
the bounce of the ball again had caused problems for Russell.
''United are a quality side,'' admitted Steven, with no complaints.

Rangers 3, Morton 0
PERHAPS it will be a bit like this most of the season, a story about
two Englishmen and a Scot. Mark Hateley, Paul Gascoigne, and Ally
McCoist scored the goals and dominated the game, as well as the
conversations among football's chattering classes afterwards.
Each has a big personality to go with his star name, not to mention
star talent, and if they contribute as handsomely as they can, Rangers
will be all right.
Hateley has done more than his share for five years now and seems just
about ready to produce a season of delight again, especially as his
fellow gunslinger, Ally McCoist, seems to be over his worrying and
wearying spell of injury.
Mark can scarcely contain his pleasure at having his ol' pardner back.
The fact that McCoist's goal was his 300th for the club demonstrates how
much he has meant to Rangers and their fans, but Hateley appreciates his
efforts just as much.
''It felt a bit like old times with him alongside me,'' he said.
''Alistair will need a few games to get his fitness level up, but
already he is looking as sharp as he has done for a long time.''
Hateley, who readily admits he has missed his ally, offered some
fascinating perceptions of McCoist. ''I think I know him as well as
anybody now,'' he said. ''I think his game has come on since I came
here. He is more of an all-round player now.
''When I first came he was just a predator, but now he links up well
and gets involved in play outside the box, which is helpful for me and
the team.''
Hateley has been helpful himself, especially when Ally was at a low
ebb during his run of injuries. ''I have been there myself when you
think you are never going to play again, and all that sort of stuff. It
is a slog training and then you get another injury, but your team-mates
and family help you through that. His new baby came along at the right
time to take his mind of football.''
McCoist, he said, had trimmed down and 'still has a lot of goals in
him.' He considers Ally one of the best goalscorers he has ever played
beside. ''He is a smart lad, Alistair. He told me when I was not long
here that he was amazed at how much I did outside the box. When he got
back into the team, his attitude had changed completely.''
Hateley had interesting thoughts on Gascoigne, too. ''Paul wants to be
on the ball all the time and possibly he is going a little too deep to
get it. I think his strength is further forward and using his power to
get in the box. He gets frustrated when he doesn't get the ball, but he
hasn't played for a long time.
''It is different when he plays for England. He disciplines himself to
play in the last two-thirds of the park, but he will get there for us,
once his fitness level is up and he gets stronger.''
Gascoigne did a lot of attractive things as well as scoring a fine
goal, but there were also signs that his temper is liable to let him
down. He was involved in a couple of skirmishes with Derek McInnes, one
when he seemed to hit him with his elbow, although he said later it was
more a shrugging off action than anything else.
McInnes, to his credit, also made light of it and, in fact, talked
about how much of an education it was playing against a player of that
calibre. ''He still has to get full fitness, but he is brilliant. He
likes to be the main man. It is playing against people like him which
helps us to learn.''
The Morton man also revelaed that Gascoigne talks a lot, sometimes
encouragingly, sometimes ''winding me up''.
There was no doubt the #4.3m man enjoyed his first competitive goal,
the third of the day for Rangers. There was a moment when we thought he
would need help to get his raised arms back to his sides again, but his
joy was warranted. The goal was special. A long clearance by Andy Goram
was nodded on by Hateley to his fellow Englishman and a couple of smooth
body swerves -- which bamboozled three defenders -- later, he had
cleared a path for a left-foot shot high into the net.
That goal came when Morton were doing their best, and that was pretty
effective, to get back into the game. Indeed, they were denied a clear
penalty when Craig Moore flattened Warren Hawke, but Rangers by then had
clearly thoughts on other matters, with the European tie looming.
They were never in any danger once McCoist opened the scoring in nine
minutes with a left-foot shot that the keeper reached but could not
halt.
When Hateley volleyed in a headed clearance from Derek Lilley, the
crowd sat back and enjoyed some fine play in the sunshine, from both
teams.
Morton manager Allan McGraw admired the 'clinical' finishing of the
Rangers strikers. ''You can't give them a chance. It was a lesson to our
own lads that you need to take these kind of opportunities.''
'It felt a bit like old times with Alistair alongside me. He will need
a few games to get his fitness level up, but already he is looking as
sharp as he has done for a long time.' -- MARK HATELEY

Queen of the South 0,
Falkirk 2
FALKIRK'S new manager John Lambie fired an ominous warning to his
players after watching them struggle to beat second-division Queen of
the South at Palmerston.
He said: ''I felt some of the players were not giving enough and I
expect more from them in the future.''
Lambie stressed that he was taking into account the hot, humid
conditions which left him struggling for breath in the dug-out. Still,
he feels his men can do more.
Falkirk started well, but after 10 minutes found Queens coming back at
them and it was only a flash of brilliance by new signing David Elliot
two minutes into first-half injury time that gave them the upper hand.
He raced down the left wing and outstripped the defence before
crossing for Mo Johnston to snap up a chance of the type he rarely
misses.
Queens, however, hit back in the second half and Lambie admitted that
a save by Tony Parkes in 60 minutes was crucial. Parkes dived across
goal to turn a shot from Tommy Bryce round a post.
A lucky escape, indeed, for Falkirk.
It was a cruel blow to Queens eight minutes from time when Falkirk
broke away and substitute Nicky Henderson clinched the tie -- and a home
meeting with Aberdeen -- with a shot that went in off a post.
Lambie was pleased, at least, with the showing of Elliot and the other
new signing, Craig Napier. He said: ''They both put in sterling
performances.''

East Fife 2, Airdrie 3
PETER Duffield's first competitive goal for Airdrie delighted manager
Alex MacDonald.
The former Hamilton hitman netted the second of two goals in a
two-minute spell which effectively turned this tie Airdrie's way.
MacDonald said: ''That's the reason we signed the lad. His goal was
typical of a top striker. He didn't try to blast it, but just picked his
spot in the corner of the net.''
Then he added with a smile: ''Mind you, he should have scored two or
three before then.''
Airdrie were stunned in 19 minutes when Robert Scott lobbed goalkeeper
John Martin to give the Fifers an early lead. But the first-division
side hit back with second-half goals from Jimmy Boyle, Duffield, and
Steve Cooper, before Gilbert Allan netted late on for the Fifers to set
up an exciting finish.
MacDonald added: ''Going to somewhere like Methil is hard enough
without losing a silly early goal. However, we were more determined
after the break and with a bit of luck we could have scored more than
three.''
East Fife manager Steve Archibald revealed his side were devastated at
losing. He said his players had lost concentration after the equaliser,
but never gave up and looked the stronger side at the end.
Airdrie now have a home time with Hibs and MacDonald is confident his
club's recent cup successes will continue. ''It doesn't bother me who we
play or where. Airdrie don't have their own ground, so it doesn't matter
whether we are home or away.''

Dunfermline 3, Stranraer 0
TALENTED winger Allan Moore at last is producing the form which will
win over the East End Park fans.
The former Hearts and St Johnstone player scored the first goal, laid
on the second, and tormented the plucky Stranraer defence as Dunfermline
moved comfortably through to the next round.
Afterwards Moore, who had a miserable, injury-plagued start to his
career with the Fife club, said: ''It is very much a question of
confidence. I am now happy with my game and my form.
''I feel fit at last. I played with injuries last season and didn't
really justify myself. I haven't really been fit for one-and-a-half
years.
''I am really enjoying playing now and was delighted with my
performance against Stranraer. I am now starting to repay manager Bert
Paton and I think the fans are starting to get behind me.''
Moore opened the scoring in four minutes after good work by new
signing Paul Kinnaird.
A clever run by Moore let captain Norrie McCathie add a second in 40
minutes.
The home side controlled the second half and the hard-working Stewart
Petrie scored the third in the last minute.
Paton praised his Dunfermline team and revealed that some of the
club's injury problems were starting to clear up. Craig Robertson will
restart training this week and Canadian internationalist Paul Fenwick
will play in a reserve game tonight.
Three Stranraer players were booked -- Jim Hughes, Nigel Howard, and
substitute Douglas McGuire. Dunfermline's Andy Tod also received a
yellow card.

Hibs 3, Stenhousemuir 1
EAMONN Bannon saw enough of his old club Hibernian on Saturday to
credit them with a chance of repeating their cup triumph of four years
ago.
Alex Miller's team won the equivalent of the Coca-Cola Cup in 1991,
and if anything, his squad is more mature now, with an understanding
that will make them hard to overcome.
The 37-year-old former internationalist, who overcame a hamstring
injury to play at Easter Road, said: ''Hibs are a very difficult unit to
beat, but with Rangers clear favourites, they will have to be at their
best to win the cup again.
''This competition has traditionally become the easiest one to win,
perhaps because it offers an opportunity to a team which goes on a good
early run.
''Hibs were a bit hot-and-cold on Saturday, but scored the crucial
first goal and our part-time players always faced an uphill struggle
from there.
''It is important to remember that Hibs were without Willie Miller,
Gordon Hunter, and Keith Wright, so they will be a factor this season.''
The man recently sacked from his post as assistant manager at Hearts
was angry with his fellow-defenders when Pat McGinlay scored the
important first goal.
Little Mickey Weir was given too much time to place his
nineteenth-minute shot and the ball thumped off a defender and then
McGinlay on its way into the net.
Darren Jackson scored two more, one from the penalty spot, before
Jimmy Fisher's late consolation for Stenhousemuir.
Bannon went on: ''I enjoyed the game and the atmosphere on Saturday,
but it was odd being in a team that wasn't expected to do much. All
through my career I've always been with clubs who were generally
favourites to win. It was a strange feeling to come to terms with.''
He is happy to keep his hand in with Stenhousemuir. But he revealed:
''I signed a one-month contract at the end of last week, but may not
necessarily see that out.''
Perhaps he was referring to the fact that he has been linked with the
vacant job at Dumbarton following Murdo MacLeod's move to Firhill.
Hibs manager Alex Miller was sufficiently unimpressed with the slacker
periods in his team's performance to hold a 45-minute talk-in after the
match.
No doubt this morning he'll remind them of the difficult third-round
task they face against Airdrie, who dumped the Edinburgh team from the
same competition at this stage last season, with a shock 2-1 victory in
the capital.

Stirling Albion 2,
Hamilton Academical 0
STIRLING Albion are today looking forward eagerly to visiting Ibrox in
the next round of the cup. Make no mistake, they thoroughly deserved
this victory over Accies.
The Douglas Park men started the game strongly and had the bulk of
possession in the first half, but failed to capitalise on that pressure.
The more experienced Albion took charge in the second half, scoring
twice. The first came in 54 minutes. The Hamilton defence failed to
clear the danger and the ball fell to Craig Taggart at the edge of the
box. His delicate chip floated over the defenders' heads and Tommy Tait
reacted more quickly than anyone else to place it past keeper David
Cormack.
A 20-yard volley from Joe McLeod in 79 minutes clinched the victory.
A dejected Hamilton manager Iain Munro said afterwards: ''We were on
top for a long period, but didn't make it count. Their experience showed
as the match went on and we can have no complaints.
''The season has just started and we shouldn't panic. It's clear to
everyone that we have a lot of young, talented players here.''
Albion assistant Ray Stewart was obviously delighted with the victory.
''We worked very hard and deserved the win. It was a great team
performance and I wouldn't single anyone out. We try to create a family
atmosphere around the team and hopefully that is going to bring us
success in the season ahead.
''Everybody wants to go to Ibrox. It's a fabulous stadium and gives
smaller clubs like ourselves the chance to make a bit of money.''

'If I did make a bad judgment, then I have to live with it. As far as
I'm concerned, I did the right thing by my fighter.' VINNY VECCHIONE
EVERYBODY forecast that it would be quick, but nobody suspected Mike
Tyson's comeback spectacular would end in such a shambles.
It was not Tyson's wrecking punches which officially brought about the
89-second finish at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas on Saturday night,
but the actions of Peter McNeeley's manager, Vinny Vecchione.
He leapt into the ring on a mercy mission after McNeeley had been
decked for a second time and was ready to sample some more of Tyson's
pent-up fury -- and referee Mills Lane decided he had no alternative but
to disqualify the Irish-American.
Lane observed: ''McNeeley was fighting as hard as he could. I don't
understand why his corner came into the ring right then -- he could have
gone on.''
Vecchione's controversial dive through the ropes was the equivalent of
throwing in the towel -- and the Nevada State Athletic Commission are
ready to throw the book at him.
McNeeley's portion of a near-#400,000 purse will be paid in full, but
Vecchione's third-share has been withheld and he must appear before the
commission to explain why he did what he did.
Nevada State commissioner Marc Ratner said: ''McNeeley was here to
fight. We will have a full hearing within 30 days. We want to see why he
stopped it.
''It is very important to protect the public and live gate, and this
is why we will be reviewing this fight. The manager's share was
$179,820. There was no choice but to stop the fight. When the cornerman
steps into the ring, the fight is over.''
It all left Tyson looking a very frustrated man on his big night after
four years out of the ring. The satisfaction element was taken away from
the former undisputed world heavyweight champion by the farcical finish,
although he said: ''Thank God I did well.''
The flat-capped Vecchione said: ''When he went down, I saw him going
with his back to the ropes, I saw Mike coming in with tremendous speed
and balance. I also remember Jimmy Garcia (who died after a recent fight
with Gabriel Ruelas) and Gerald McClellan.
''The important thing is that this kid is 26 years old and has picked
up a lot of confidence. He wanted to come to fight, and he did come to
fight.
''If I did make a bad judgment, then I have to live with it. As far as
I'm concerned, I did the right thing by my fighter.
''My job is his safety. I thought he was wobbling badly. Peter thought
he got stopped on the three knock-down rule, so that shows where he was
at, at the time.''
The 16,736 sell-out crowd, who had paid huge amounts of dollars for
the ''homecoming'', vented their feelings with a chorus of boos and
uncomplimentary chants -- they felt short-changed --as Tyson left the
arena, blameless.
After all, he did not make the match. That was down to promoter Don
King and Tyson's co-managers John Horne and Rory Holloway -- and all
three will be hoping for something much less contentious in his next
appearance at the MGM, which is scheduled for November.
McNeeley insisted: ''I came to fight, I came out swinging. I tried to
bull the man. I got knocked down, the man hits hard.
''The first punch was a flash knock-down, a quick punch. On the second
knock-down, I was shaky, I slipped on my feet on the rope, I twisted my
knee. Look at the film. I talked the talk for this fight, I walked the
walk.
''I was pretty puzzled, I didn't know what was going on. I thought it
was the three knock-down rule. I went down only twice, it showed how
puzzled I was.
''The people around me who coach me are on the outside looking through
the looking glass, they can tell better. Vinny is like a father to me,
he was just looking after me.
''I stand by that because they love me and I love them. The last punch
was so quick I didn't even know it was an uppercut. I didn't know what
the hell hit me.''
McNeeley was certainly no shrinking violet. After grinning at Tyson's
eyeballing in the mid-ring instructions, he could almost have been on
starting blocks in his corner before rhino-charging Tyson from the first
bell.
Tyson felt McNeeley's head in his face immediately, but short rights
soon had his opponent on the seat of his trunks, although Lane obviously
did not regard it as a knock-down.
Then Tyson landed two lefts, a right uppercut, and a cuff round the
back of the neck to put McNeeley down in his own corner before
Vecchione's performed his rope trick.
Tyson said: ''I was surprised at the way he came at me. I did well,
pretty good. I'm confident I'm going to do well. I was happy to be in
there. I praise God, who blessed me with this victory.
''He came at me, I just used my instincts and started throwing
punches. He was very awkward, he kept his head down, he was difficult to
hit.
''Eventully, he would have got hurt. You know me, I'm a blood man. I
always want to put up the best fight I can, I never want to
underestimate anyone. The last time I did that I came up titleless.''
Tyson earned #280,898 per second for the brief encounter with McNeeley
-- nice work if you can get it.

THE names are not quite the same as they were last December when Raith
Rovers had the most stunning victory in their 102-year history, beating
Celtic in a penalty shoot-out to win the inaugural Coca-Cola Cup, but
the fans of each club will have just a much desire for success as they
did then.
In Celtic's case, the defeat in the final left a scar that was only
partially erased by their win in the Tennents Scottish Cup final later
in the season while Raith went on to win the first division title and
have already had a victory in the UEFA Cup.
Can the Fifers do it again, this time in the third round at Celtic
Park? Their manager thinks so, but he would, wouldn't he? What is for
sure is that Jimmy Nicholl's team will meet a much-changed Celtic on
August 30.
The traumatic result last year quickened the Parkhead management's
move to secure the signature of Pierre van Hooydonk, and they have also
added Andreas Thom and John Hughes to the side since then.
Phil O'Donnell and Tosh McKinlay were unable to play in the final
because they were cup-tied and Peter Grant was also absent because of
suspension.
Tony Mowbray is missing this time because he is suspended while Paul
McStay, who missed the penalty that decided the final in Rover's favour,
is almost certain to be absent after being out through injury, and
Charlie Nicholas, who scored fo Celtic, is now with Clyde. Brian O'Neil
is also out through injury and Andy Walker is not in the side at
present. That may only three players from the team that played then,
Gordon Marshall, Tommy Boyd, and John Collins.
Nicholl is excited at the prospect of the visit to Parkhead. ''I don't
see why we can't beat them again,'' he said. ''We can't compete with
Celtic or Rangers over 36 games in a season but over 90 minutes there is
no reason why not, as we proved last year.''
Stirling Albion will enjoy a bumper pay-out after being drawn against
Rangers at Ibrox but the most intiguing tie is probably the one between
Dundee United and Motherwell at Tannadice. Draw:
Rangers v Stirling Albion; Dundee United v Motherwell; Hearts v
Dunfermline; Dundee v Kilmarnock; Celtic v Raith Rovers; Airdrie v
Hibernian; Falkirk v Aberdeen; Livingston v Partick Thistle. (Ties on
Tuesday, August 29 or Wednesday, August 30, played to a finish. Extra
time, then penalties, if necessary.)

<HEADLINE>Industry giants air their views on future of CAP. It is time for wise farmers prepare for cuts in subsidies</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS, FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976781380</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY a grass-roots debate has opened up on the future of the
Common Agricultural Policy, involving not just academics and Government
ministers, bureaucrats and leaders within the industry. Last week some
practical farmers decided it was time they had their say.
These were no ''ordinary'' farmers, admittedly. They were among the
giants of the industry, both physically and financially. The grass in
which they are rooted is pretty high quality. Interestingly they
espoused wildly differing views of the way things were likely to
develop.
This particular phase of the debate was sparked off by the Forbes
brothers, who chose the occasion of the opening of a #500,000
development at their East Coast Viners feed compounding plant in
Kincardineshire to set out their stall. Brothers Graham and John between
them extolled the view that the subsidies being paid to the grain barons
were ''hellish'' or ''preposterous'' -- leaving the assembled Press to
decide which adjective was most suitable for their particular journal.
We got away with ''hellish''.
They also contended that all farmers should be contemplating the day
when there would be no subsidies -- and adapting their farming
enterprises accordingly. They do, of course, accept European subsidies
where they qualify for them, but are also into areas such as pigs and
peas, which are unsubsidised.
Without naming the Forbes brothers, former National Farmers' Union of
Scotland president John Cameron came up with a robust response, pointing
out that those who knock the CAP are doing the industry a great
disservice.
His stance is not surprising. He has managed to use the system not
just to benefit himself, but Scottish farmers in general. His skills as
a negotiator in Brussels were legendary.
As he arrived at meetings his fellow delegates could be heard to
mutter the French or German equivalent of ''Oh no -- here comes that
bloody Scottish sheep farmer!'' He was rarely, it appears, on the losing
side.
Support for the Forbes brothers came, however, from another giant of
the industry, Maitland Mackie, who used his column in the Scottish
Farmer to weigh in with his view that the present CAP should be regarded
as being in the autumn of its life. The Mackies and the Forbes are
related, but there is no suggestion that they have deliberately formed a
common front.
The Mackie view is that the change from price support to compensatory
payments has brought home to farmers the scale of subsidy they receive
-- and an appreciation, however, reluctant, that it will not last. ''We
should be exploring and negotiating for a soft landing into the world's
real, often hard, commercial markets,'' he warns.
He welcomes the Waldegrave think-tank report as ''a readable, useful
document which makes the issues and options clear and steers a heap of
common sense.''
Contrast that with the view of John Scott, president of the Ayr area
executive of the NFUS, who dismissed that same report as ''driven by a
UK Treasury wish-list.'' He was, he said, ''physically angry'' when he
read it.
He critcised it for its apparent misunderstanding of how the CAP works
and of the realities of what the CAP reforms are currently achieving
within GATT. He detected a failure to appreciate the problems facing the
less-favoured areas. ''The total impracticality of much of what is
suggested left me breathless,'' he told his executive.
''The shallowness of analysis, the weakness of argument put forward
for change, made this report both meaningless and valueless -- an
opportunity wasted.''
If the new UK Agriculture Minister, Douglas Hogg, endorsed the report,
it should become known for what it really was -- ''Hoggwash'', he
suggested.
Proof again that there are two sides to every story. As someone said
during the unbelievably complex negotiations in the last round of Gatt
-- ''If you're not confused, you haven't been paying attention''.
When the folk within the industry can adopt such widely divergent
positions it is hard for an outsider to venture an opinion.
All of those I have quoted are able advocates of their cause. You may
listen to one and be well convinced -- until you hear another exercising
his powers of persuasion from the other side of the fence.
Those, like the Forbes brothers, who advocate preparing now for the
day when subsidies may be withdrawn, appear to have common sense on
their side.
Nobody is suggesting the total withdrawal of support, but it is
increasingly likely that it will be redirected to serve social or
environmental purposes. That could be good news for hill farmers and for
the environment lobby, who want to see the countryside managed in a way
which is sensitive to the needs of flora and fauna.
There are those who argue a cut-off point, which would mean that the
grain barons would have to survive on profit margins alone -- backed by
the economies of scale. The smaller farmer would still be supported.
There seems to be an inescapable logic in the view that the CAP will
not stand the strain of expanding to cope with the accession of the
former Soviet bloc countries who now aspire to membership.
We are probably not on course for a New Zealand-style subsidy free
zone solution -- but perhaps it is time for farmers to broaden out the
base of their enterprise so that, overall, they are less dependent on
the taxpayer. Scottish farmers will collect about #380m in subsidies
this year.

SO that was the harvest of 1995. Fifteen days after the combine
arrived 170 acres were cut away and sent to the grain merchants. It has
been a wonderful harvest with good crops got in ideal conditions. Now
that we are finished what we want is for the weather to break and give
us a nice moist seed-bed for next year's rape.
The winter rape has averaged 31 cwts to the acre which is more than I
expected. It looked poor all year really and yet has yielded as well as
ever. It is an enigmatic crop.
And there has been considerable variation as between varieties. We
tried a cocktail of Rocket and Express this year but it is definitely
well behind the Falcon and Rocket blend we've been using for a year or
two. That yielded from 31 to just over 35 cwts whereas the
Rocket-Express went as low as 27 cwts to 30. As the Rocket was common to
both blends it does make you wonder what we were doing trying Express in
the first place.
Because we are saving some barley for seed we don't have an exact
figure for the yield. On bad days I look at the heap and say that the
average for winter barley is 70 cwts. And then I go back and have
another look at the heap and get the yield up to 72. At all events it is
good considering that much of it was following wheat. Next year it will
all be after rape. That gives a complete break from the cereal diseases
and it will be a case of ''Brace yourself Banker -- here comes the Ardo
barley cheque.''
It has not all been plain sailing.
You know that I am not one to hide my light under a bushel-weight, but
I have to admit to being one of the world's less gifted when it comes to
unloading combines. That involves driving the cart alongside the moving
combine and catching the grain as it pours from a great spout. Despite
the fact that I used to field in the covers I am not a very good
catcher.
The trouble is that, with my arthritic joints, I cannot look far
enough round to see properly where the jet of seeds is landing. I can
just about manage out of the corner of one eye when the ground is level
and the wind is low. But when I am jiggling along at the edge of the
field with one wheel halfway up the dike I am in trouble.
And rape seeds in wind are very difficult. The trouble is they are so
light that as soon as they leave the spout they fan out and by the time
they land they are covering five feet across the six-foot cart. So there
is only one foot of margin for variations in the wind and for errors.
I see that a few precious seeds are blowing out of the left hand side
of the cart so you veer to the left. Just as I make it the wind drops
and the black cloud starts depositing the oil seeds over the right hand
edge of the cart.
Worse than that, I have been so worried about the left/right problem
that you haven't noticed that the combine has been gaining on me and it
starts to pour off the front of the cart as well.
Then I catch a glimpse of the most terrifying sight the Little Ardo
harvest field has to offer; Mains is glowering down ferociously from the
combine. His eyes are flashing and his lips are moving.
Luckily I can only guess what he is saying above the din. It amounts
to ''Here I am doing my best to cut the stuff and you can't even catch
it. I have enough on my plate without having to shut the auger on and
off to do your job for you.'' There may well have been other words I
haven't heard since I was at school.
And there was another tense moment. Mains was anxious to get on
because his father had just been down with the message that the rape at
the Mains was down to 9.6% moisture and there was a rumour that the
merchants wouldn't take it if it got down to 6%.
Now, for trouble-free lifting of rape, it is important that the swathe
be laid evenly out before the combine and this was not the case in this
particular field. It was two steps forward and one back for the Mains.
Every 10 yards or so a great clump of rape straw would spew over the
header amid an agonised rasp from the clutch and the air would turn blue
once again. ''That swather's jist a disgrace. It's jist like a row of
feathery stooks. Every time I have to stop I'm losing time and you're
losing rape.''
Put that way I wasn't very impressed either.
Mossie's in good fettle. He isn't being very forthcoming about his
yields though which makes it difficult for me as you know I can't be
seen to have bigger crops than him or he'll resign as crops adviser.
But he is fairly enjoying the good weather. And he is scandalised at
how easy the English farmers have it.
He's even bought himself a new combine with a starting price of
#160,000. That's twice what I paid for my whole farm and to justify it
he's going to have to do some contracting. But he certainly can't come
here. The Mega cuts 22 feet at a time so it would be sore put to it to
turn in some of our fields and, if there were any gates it couldn't go
over it certainly couldn't go through them.
It has a computer which gives hourly prints-out of the yield per acre,
moisture content and specific weight of the crop. It can do the
invoicing as well so I'm glad to be stuck with Mains. I prefer his
gentler system of appearing in a couple of months time with the
handwritten invoice from the pad with the blue paper.
We could have a fair dram this year for it was a memorable hairst.

Cyprus
GEORGI Vassilev was reluctant to give any lengthy personal interviews
and his Anorthosis Famagusta players were discouraged from making loud,
public statements of intent, but their message was clear just the same.
It was obvious in the way they swaggered through a training routine
and strangely, for a team of humble resources, confidence oozed from
everyone involved.
These Cypriots and their Bulgarian allies believe they can snatch
Europe's attention by beating Rangers in the return leg of their
European Cup preliminary-round tie here in Larnaca on Wednesday despite
injury worries over two players, whom Vassilev refuses to name.
The Bulgarian manager of Anorthosis is a man of few words, but he has
said enough to make it known he doesn't fear the Scottish champions and
nor should he, since he was involved as coach when Levski Sofia beat
Rangers a couple of years ago.
Also, the player who destroyed Rangers' European ambition that year is
waiting for the chance to haunt them again. Nikolai Todorov, one of
three Bulgarians recruited by Anorthosis in the close season, says that
given an opportunity on Wednesday evening, he will score again.
The Cypriot side admitted to anxiety when they arrived in Glasgow and
saw Ibrox filling up, but they left feeling an injustice had been
perpetrated when Gordon Durie scored the only goal of the game. In other
words, they were not overly impressed by the mighty Rangers.
''They seemed to be slightly afraid to open up and play,'' said
Vassilev. ''Perhaps if they have a similar problem on Wednesday we might
take better advantage.''
Todorov says he believes Rangers' defence will offer an opportunity or
two, but perhaps the greater danger will come from the other striker,
Sinima Gogic, who had two good chances at Ibrox.
A Serbian who has just been granted Cypriot papers, which in effect
means Anorthosis have the benefit of four foreign players, Gogic has
told his team-mates they can rely on him this time around.
''But it will not be a matter of us attacking powerfully from the
beginning,'' said Vassilev. ''We are a goal behind, but we can't lose
another. Trying to score at least three times to win would be too
much.''
The strategy will be to protect their own goalkeeper, Cypriot
internationalist Nicos Panayiatou, while probing to test again the
extraordinary ability of Andy Goram, and if they have not beaten him by
midway through the second half all their energies will be channelled
into attack.
Vassilev's tactics at Ibrox were good and he has this team extremely
well disciplined and organised.
The players are benefiting enormously from the steadying influences of
the foreign element around them and no longer are prone to charging
forward, driven by desperation.
''They know what they are doing now and what is required to win,''
Vassilev said.
Anorthosis, founder members of the Cypriot league, have had the best
defensive record over the past three years and believe they are ready to
experience life among football's aristocrats. As they strolled from the
training pitch a local asked Todorov if Anorthosis would win.
''Two nil,'' he replied.
''That would be like a dream,'' said Yiammakis Papatheodorou, the
club's general manager. ''Rangers are a fantastic club, huge compared to
us, but sometimes the strangest things happen, especially if the bigger
team becomes afraid . . .''
Papatheodorou didn't finish his statement, but there was no need
really. Rangers have been warned.
Meanwhile, the man Rangers fans would most wish to see run on to the
pitch on Wednesday, Brian Laudrup, may have to watch the action from the
dug-out.
The Danish internationalist is one of two players who are very
doubtful starters for the return match and manager Walter Smith did not
sound too optimistic about his chances yesterday.
The other major doubt is defender Alan McLaren, whose absence also
would give the manager headaches for a tie that could mean so much for
the club and the country this season.
Smith will not make a decision about these two until the last minute,
wishing to give them every opportunity to overcome the ankle (Laudrup)
and calf (McLaren) injuries that kept them out of the team which beat
Morton at Ibrox on Saturday.
Definitely out of contention are Iain Ferguson, who damaged a
hamstring against Morton, and Trevor Steven, but there is brighter news
about striker Gordon Durie and midfield man Stuart McCall. ''I'm hopeful
they will both be fit enough to play.''
The squad, which leaves today, will be supplemented with three of the
younger lads, Scott Wilson, Stephen Boyack, and Brian McGinlay.
If Rangers have problems, they are not quite in the same league as
those of Motherwell. The Fir Park side, already down 3-1 in their UEFA
Cup preliminary round tie with MyPa 47, will travel to Finland today
without Dutch defender Mitchel van der Gaag, who will be sidelined for
the next two months.
The former PSV man suffered a fracture to a small bone in an ankle
during the Coca-Cola Cup tie with Clydebank on Saturday and is now in
plaster.
It reduces manager Alex McLeish's options for a tie that already looks
beyond his team. He had decided to give Chris McCart time in the
reserves to get back to his peak after a spell out but that may have to
be altered immediately.
John Henry, the man bought from Spurs, missed the weekend action
because of an ankle injury and will not be ready for the game, but there
is a spot of good news. Eddie May, who was carried off on Saturday with
a head injury, did not suffer from concussion and will be okay.
Raith Rovers go to The Faroes with a 4-0 lead from the first leg of
their UEFA Cup tie against Gotu IF, but the Fifers have been hit with an
unexpected race against time.
Their troubles began on Friday when a charter company cancelled the
flight because they did not have a pilot who was qualified to land on
the island's runway.
Rovers organised another company but they could not take them out
until later tonight and, under UEFA regulations, they must be in the
host country at least 24 hours before the game.
The club now may have to seek special dispensation from UEFA before
the game can go ahead although they have been told if they arrive before
midnight everything would be all right.

<HEADLINE>Profits for Thorn EMI expected to hit #65m</HEADLINE>

THE only FTSE-100 company with figures due out this week is music and
rentals giant Thorn EMI, which is planning to demerge its various
businesses.
Thorn EMI publishes first-quarter results for the three months to June
tomorrow.
NatWest Securities sees pre-tax profits rising to #65m from #46.2m
last time, but it warns that this may not be a reliable pointer to the
group's full-year performance.
''First-quarter results cover a traditionally quiet period for Thorn
and this fact, coupled with the intrinsic volatility of the music
division over such short-time periods, makes it dangerous to draw any
meaningful conclusions from the figures,'' NatWest said.
NatWest sees Thorn EMI's biggest profit generator, the music division,
increasing its contribution by #9m to #42m.
Stationer, bookseller and newsagent WH Smith will have its work cut
out to persuade investors that it can revive profits when it reports
full-year results on Wednesday.
The company warned in May, the final month of its financial year, that
falling sales would depress profits to about #115m from #124.8m in 1994.
Nevertheless, it promised to increase the total dividend slightly to
15.65p from 15.4p last year.
''My own feeling is that the supermarkets and other competitors are
still going to be creaming off Smith's sales,'' said Rowan Morgan, an
analyst at Nikko Europe. ''Given that margins aren't that hot, it will
continue to put them under pressure.''
Dawsongroup looks likely to report an increase in half-year profits on
Wednesday after diversifying its truck sales and rental business into
portable cold stores, buses, and fork-lift trucks.
NatWest is forecasting a 14% increase in pre-tax profits to #5.7m for
the six months to the end of June and an increase in the interim
dividend to 2.2p from 1.8p.
The Glasgow-based Weir Group is expected to show some increase in
first-half profit when it reports on Thursday, mainly as a result of its
US acquisition Envirotech showing its first full contribution for the
period.
Investors will be watching to see whether the manufacturer of
specialist pumps has benefitted from any easing of pressure on its
profit margins.
Stockbroker Bell, Lawrie, White has pencilled in a rise in pre-tax
profits to #21.6m from #18.5m.

BEVERLEY LYONS looks at the growing empire of multi-level marketing
WHEN, earlier this month, Wembley Arena was brimming with a frenzied
gathering of eager fans, football was not their goal. Multi-level
marketing, instead, was the game to be played and thousands were ready
to score.
Pyramid selling might be as old as the pharaohs but since its
ignominious British entry in the seventies, the technique has reached
new heights. With a now acceptable name, network selling, multi-level
marketing (MLM), whatever . . . the originally tacky ideas behind the
commercial chain-letter scheme have become legitimate, acceptable to the
masses. The meeting at Wembley was but one recognition of the fact.
So too are recent figures from ''biggie'' network companies like
Cabuchon and Kleaneaze who last year made #84m and #35m respectively in
the marketplace -- an overwhelming increase on their respective 1991
profits of #1.4m and #6m. Cabuchon projects a turnover of #200m at the
end of this financial year.
It is, say experts, a change from the early days when shoddy upstart
companies ripped off the little man giving all the money to a lucky few
at the top. This time, the baddies have been buried under a sandy mound
of legislation and now companies like ISE (I'm So Excited!) Advertising
are popping up in Glasgow and elsewhere.
Explanations for the resurgence of multi-level marketing are given by
many but none can explain the current buzz as simply as Aileen Harvey.
The 24-year-old marketing graduate has been heading ISE Advertising's 20
recruits for one year and in that time has managed to buy herself a
''wee red BMW'' -- paying cash. She took a group of her employees to the
Wembley meet last weekend so that they could collect awards and gain
recognition for their sales.
''You only have to rely on yourself to get the rewards,'' enthuses
Harvey who graduated from Strathclyde University Business School. ''The
incentives are large -- you can be a millionaire eventually, but
essentially the stress is on fun,'' she says.
Commitment and motivation are the key words that unlock the door of
successful network selling, something which Dougie Carlyle, managing
director of Edinburgh's Mentor Marketing is first to admit. Mentor is
the Scottish branch of MLM International, a company which has been
providing training materials for this type of venture for five years.
Says Carlyle: ''You earn as much as you put into it. The sort of people
who do well have been inherently successful in the past and have an
insatiable hunger to do well in life.''
Carlyle and his colleagues have noted a definite upturn in the amount
of training material being demanded in recent years, a consequence, they
feel, of the economic climate.
The benefits appear to apply all round. From a retail perspective the
advantages of MLM mean smaller marketing and distribution costs for the
product supplier.
Gerald Michaluk recognises the benefits of such a scheme. As the
managing director of Marketing Management Services and high-profile
member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing, he suggests:
''Traditionally, a lot of costs go into marketing and distributing
products. This way, the product manufacturer can target a different
customer through different channels. It's a very cheap way to distribute
products.''
Despite the general enthusiasm Michaluk is, however, wary of some of
the ''get rich quick'' schemes which have surfaced -- leading to recent
Department of Trade and Industry recommendations in March to overhaul
the Fair Trading Act 1973. He reasons: ''Vast sums of money are quoted
as being attainable but most of the return is actually poor.''
Even for those who are willing to put in the time, Carlyle agrees that
there are still faults within the system. Those who become too
successful too quickly may be tempted to leave the network and set up on
their own, a dangerous move.
It is evident that the schemes will live forever, but it is perhaps
the advice of Professor Michael Thomas of Strathclyde University's
marketing department which may act as an answer to the riddle for those
who are lured into pyramid selling.
Professor Thomas warns: ''Caveat emptor, let the buyer beware --
participants must be fully informed of all rights and obligations
incurred through the scheme. The law has always recognised this caveat
and will not interfere but it can't protect everyone from foolishness.''
Anyone in doubt should consult recent Government regulations, Pyramid
Selling Schemes 1989 and Amendment 1990.

ANVAR KHAN talks to ambitious TV presenter Kirsty Young about her work
and commitment to her own evolution
I like risk. This is a good time for things to be unpredictable, and I
like that
WHEN TV presenter Kirsty Young met me in the fishbowl lobby of BBC
Scotland, it was decided, after a moderate degree of dithering, that we
perform the interview in the canteen. Kirsty promptly returned to the
remains of her breakfast on a table beside the window. A three-day-old
copy of The Herald enveloped an empty pot of Greek yoghurt, an apple,
and tea like a sleeping manta ray.
''Wednesday's Herald?'' I inquired, puzzled, since it was Saturday.
''I haven't had a chance to look at the papers all week,'' she replied,
tidying up, ''which I suppose is a bit sad really''.
It was to be a while before we got settled. The girl in charge of the
canteen till had volunteered to distribute questionnaires on behalf of
her pal, who, she said, had just left college and was trying to make it
as a jewellery designer.
''I'm conducting an interview,'' I protested, as she handed me two
free multiple choice questionnaires with my cuppa. I don't know if all
BBC staff receive assertiveness training, but I returned to the table
with more questions for Kirsty than I'd arrived with.
If Kirsty had the nous of any old hack, she might have led me to a
clean table, with no debris and therefore no clues. As far as she was
playing it, we were on equal ground. She wasn't cocky because she's not
thick-skinned enough. She was nervous.
A couple of weeks ago, the Sun interviewed TV's Gamesmaster host
Dominik Diamond. Like other examples of the male species, including
Scots rugby star Kenny Logan, he's supposed to have been Kirsty's
boyfriend, once. Obviously a charming chap with a huge vocabulary, he
was reported as saying she was a ''cracking bird''.
''A lot of the people I know have a rather fantastic sense of humour
and I think Dominik was employing his spectacularly odd humour there.''
Kirsty is coming on like an amused parent; unimpressed but not that
angry either.
A less hilarious incident took place last week, when the Record
reported that Kirsty had returned to the arms of Ian Pattison. ''I
haven't spoken to her for over a year'' said the writer. The Herald can
confirm he is taking legal action against the scabloid.
But there are some who think that any press is futile, they think that
the high-profile presenter should be demoted to the cult of
non-personality.
''Am I going to sit here and go 'Oh, things are really getting to me?'
That would just be pathetic. The concept of 'who I am' makes me laugh.
I've met really famous people. When you sit and talk to Elvis Costello,
who is able to reach millions, and you go out in Edinburgh or Glasgow
and people go 'Oh there's Kirsty off the telly', it is a much reduced
experience.''
Male journalists, bovinely and without fail, always ask her if she is
''ambitious''. (Nope, she's on TV by accident, dumbo.) When Kirsty
replies in the affirmative, they punt the idea that she is hard, because
they believe that women who are ambitious are cripples. And in some way,
Kirsty is twisted. But no more or less so than anyone who is driven.
''I really like the idea of doing now what I used to dismiss. I used
to wonder why people ran, now I run.'' Like the very best of modern
womanhood she is committed to her own evolution. Kirsty likes the idea
of changing herself, not through words but deeds, which is an honest and
unhypocritical tack. People can say anything, but it's what they do that
counts. She keeps fit, she works hard, she's her own boss as a
freelance, having rejected a cosy STV contract.
Work the previous week for the BBC's Holidays Out programme demanded
she drive a Czechoslovakian tank, the following, white-water rafting.
''You can't cruise for too long,'' she states. ''I like risk. I don't
have kids, I don't have anyone depending on me, this is a good time for
things to be unpredictable, and I like that.''
What is interesting about Kirsty is that she is impatient with
Scotland, and that's always a sign of wanting to get on. She works for
north and south, to all intents and purposes she is a media ambassador.
But she despises the self-congratulatory and flabby smugness of a
country which refuses to compete. She resents the fact that most of the
people in the Scottish media and Government are middle-aged and male, in
not so much the fast lane as the layby of their lives.
''Scotland is full of wee kingdoms, everyone's got their own. It's not
like that in England, there's no time, you just get on with it. There
is, here, a conspiracy of mediocrity. And a breed of young, strong women
who are a very real threat to such men.''
What Kirsty does understand is her chosen media.
''Kirsty was not a self-help show. You don't heal the world on TV.
That attitude sprang from the American chat shows, the 'we've solved
that, we've talked about that, all the horrific things that happen in
the privacy of our own home, we've talked about them for 40 minutes on
TV'. Well, that's just garbage. You may unearth something that has been
a real taboo, you may expose something you didn't believe happened, but
it doesn't solve things,'' she says.
Apologists for social behaviour believe that TV dominates the
psychology of the nation, but Kirsty rejects the notion.
''I think a very interesting thing has happened with television, which
is that people have a healthy disrespect for it now. There was a time,
when whatever came out of the TV, it was like going to the doctor's, you
might have been told that you were going in for an operation, but you
never really asked what for, then you went home and you knew you'd had
something done. Somebody with a very posh voice said, 'This is the world
according to us'. TV's not like that any more, there are few notions of
power. People have the power of TV in proportion.''
There are few professionals who have the right to poke about the lives
of others. In journalists, the constant examination of the human
character releases either cynicism or compassion.
''I don't have the arrogance to want to turn people over. A television
studio is an artificial environment, the lights and the cameras, having
half-an-hour to talk to people. These are very heightened circumstances,
very strangely and suddenly meeting this very real thing, which is
someone's experience. Whether it is distressing or positive, they have
to talk about something which marks them out as being unusual, in some
way, untypical. What you have to forget about is the artificiality, and
touch base with them very quickly. You do have to build up a trust, and
hope that they are going to like you. You have to reassure them
beforehand that all you want to do is to represent them accurately.
''I want to get the essence of what they are, over in six or seven
minutes. You want to ask them 55 questions, you have time to ask them
eight. You just have to try to transmit the fact that you are genuine.
People usually have quite an acute sense of who wants to fillet them,
and who wants the experience to be advantageous to both parties. I don't
want someone to come out of my studio and think they got an unfair
deal,'' Kirsty says.
There's another angle. There are some women who suffer from flimsy
self-esteem, not because they're female but because they have a job.
Their confidence is not solid and innate, but often governed by how well
they do their work. Their career is a barometer of their self-worth. To
some, including myself, anonymity is hell. Always has been.
''I empathise with that completely,'' Kirsty agrees, as someone else
who used to feel they were living half a life before they made it.
''I don't feel vulnerable in a television studio, I like the
environment. I think it brings out the best in me, which is a slightly
perverted thing.''
Meanwhile, we've got questionnaires, which we dutifully fill in.
Kirsty takes her time, if she's going to do it at all, she's going to do
it properly. She walks me out. Sometimes interviewing fellow journalists
is like performing a duel at dawn, we eye each other like cowboys in a
Sergio Leone epic. ''We'll meet at the top,'' she decides, outside, as
we shake hands and smile. Yeah.
* Kirsty will be appearing in Holidays Out on August 22 and 29 on
BBC1. A new series of late-night Kirsty will be broadcast in the autumn.

Newsview: Why expatriate Scots gathered in remembrance at the other
Wallace monument
INTEREST in the history of William Wallace, one of Scotland's greatest
patriots and national heroes, has been heightened by the Hollywood movie
Braveheart, starring Mel Gibson, which receives its European premiere in
Stirling on September 3.
Events at the National Wallace Monument at Stirling, to mark the 698th
anniversary of the Battle of Stirling Bridge on September 11, will be
the focus of much attention.
However, the 690th anniversary of Wallace's death on Wednesday is also
likely to create interest in two lesser known but highly significant
monuments, some 400 miles apart. The Herald examines the backgrounds of
these memorials, one of which faces a less than certain future.
THERE are those who spend just a few moments in silent remembrance and
then lay flowers at its foot. There are others who cast a curious glance
in its direction as they rush past and then get on with a busy day.
Then there is the occasional person who finds the iron railings
underneath a convenient place on which to chain and park a bicycle.
Watching it all are some of the down and outs of London. They don't
seem too interested.
Those who have always known of the plaque to commemorate the cruel
execution of Sir William Wallace at Smithfield Elms on August 23, 1305,
are amazed to learn that few Scots know of its existence.
It is a handsome monument which is said to have convinced Mel Gibson
he should play the leading role in Braveheart, soon to be released in
the United Kingdom.
Even Nigel Tranter, whose excellent book The Wallace offers the most
authoritative account of the life of the greatest hero Scotland has
known, did not know about the plaque.
It stands on an outer wall of St Bartholemew's Hospital, under threat
of closure. Much of that hospital is a Grade 1 listed building and the
Wallace memorial is listed Grade 11. As a consequence, no matter what
the future holds for the medical aspects of the hospital, both should
survive.
The vicar of the only hospital parish in the world, the Rev Michael
Whawell, whose church, St Bartholomew the Less, is a few yards away from
the Wallace memorial, insists closure does not come into the equation.
''It would cost #250m to close this hospital and transfer specialities
to Whitechapel. When the public learns this there will be a revolt. In
any case, we have a judicial review which will take nine months before
it comes to court and that is nine months closer to an election.
''The Labour Party has said it supports Barts. No matter which party
wins the next General Election the hospital and the plaque will remain
in situ.''
The words on the Wallace plaque could not fail to move a true-blooded
Scot.
Under a lion rampant shield, itself under a crown, they declare:
''To the immortal memory of Sir William Wallace, Scottish patriot born
at Elderslie, Renfrewshire, circa 1270 AD who from the year 1296 fought
dauntlessly in defence of his country's liberty and independence in the
face of fearful odds and great hardship, being eventually betrayed and
captured, brought to London, and put to death near this spot on the 23rd
August 1305.
''His example, heroism, and devotion inspired those who came after him
to win victory from defeat and his memory remains of all time a source
of pride honour and inspiration to his countrymen.''
It continues in Latin.
''Dico tibi verum libertas optima rerum nunquam servili sub nexu
vivito fili.''
In translation that reads: ''To tell you the truth, liberty is the
best of things. Son, never live under a servile yolk.''
And below that there is a message in Gaelic.
''Bas Agus Buaidh.''
The English translation Death and Victory shouts the message that the
influence of William Wallace lives on.
Nigel Tranter's deepest regret is that he did not write about William
Wallace before producing his trilogy on Robert the Bruce. They sold a
million each; his book on Wallace did not do so well.
''There is no question about it,'' he said. ''Wallace was Scotland's
greatest hero.
''While Robert the Bruce fought Edward, the Hammer of the Scots, for a
crown, Wallace did it purely for the freedom of Scotland.''
Wallace taught Robert the Bruce everything about guerrilla warfare.
''It is very sad that Scots know little about William Wallace,'' he told
me.
Betrayed by his squire Jack Short for 40 merks, Wallace was captured
as he lay asleep in a stable in the Garngad area of Glasgow at
Robberstone Loch (the area now known as Robroyston), and taken to
Dumbarton Castle. From there he was transported in chains and under
heavy guard to London.
In Westminister Hall, in the Palace of Westminster, he was mocked in
much the same way as Christ was after his trial.
A laurel wreath was placed on his head before the sham trial got under
way. Wallace was refused the right to any kind of defence. He was told
that as he was an outlaw he could not even speak.
Neverthless, to the anger of Lord Chief Justice Mallory, Wallace
declared: ''I cannot be tried on a charge of treason . . . not here, in
England. I could not be a traitor to the King of England, for I was
never his subject, and never swore fealty to him.''
King Edward's verdict and sentence had preceded the trial.
Wallace was taken from Westminister Hall where the mob, enjoying a
special public holiday for the event, ripped off his clothes. Naked, but
for the laurel wreath, he was attached head down to a wooden structure
and dragged behind two working horses through the cobbled streets of
London first to Tower Hill and then to Smithfield.
When he became unconscious, they threw water in his face to ensure he
was awake for the next stage of his ordeal. They hung him, but the
executioner took pains to ensure his neck did not snap before the final
stage.
Taken from the gibbet still alive, his eyes wide, his stomach was slit
open and his entrails pulled out. They were burned in front of him.
Finally, they cut off his head before quartering the body.
The head was displayed on London Bridge. One quarter of his mutilated
body was sent to Newcastle-upon-Tyne for public display and another to
Berwick. Depending on which version you believe, another went either to
Dumfries or Stirling and the last to Perth or Aberdeen.
The plaque, a few yards from the hospital's Henry VIII gate (rebuilt
in the reign of Queen Anne in 1702 shortly before the Union of Crowns)
bears witness to these events.
It was unveiled on April 8, 1956. Strangely nobody knows much about
it. Certainly Barts hospital have not a clue, even though their
governors gave permission.
Herald research has discovered that the Scottish historian and
novelist, Dr Agnes Mure Mackenzie, who lived in Highgate, London, was
suggesting that a memorial should be placed at the site of Wallace's
death as early as the 1920s. It was a cause she continued to pursue
throughout her life.
However, it was not until the year after her death that a plaque was
finally unveiled.
We have learned that the not inconsiderable sum for these days of
#6000 was raised by expatriate Scots both in England and abroad.
Yesterday, the London branch of the Scottish National Party laid a
wreath at the memorial. A piper played a lament. They all then adjourned
to a pub across the square.
Because it was a Sunday, Norman Macleod of the Royal Scottish
Corporation, based in London, was not there. However, his thoughts were
with them.
The monument at Robroyston which marks the spot where Wallace was
captured by agents of Edward I of England may not be quite so anonymous
as the plaque in London, but there are still many Scots who are unaware
of its existence.
The monument, a 20ft stone Pictish cross with a sculpted claymore and
various inscribed plaques, is a suitably grand edifice.
But its location and the lack of signposts and information points mean
its existence and significance is lost on most passers-by.
The monument is situated just off Robroyston Road on the north-eastern
outskirts of Glasgow, half hidden from the road by trees and close to
two bricked-up semi-detached houses and several derelict farm buildings
at Robroyston Mains farm.
Sadly, it is so close to the road that most people travelling in cars
catch no more than a glimpse in their peripheral vision of what to them
could be just another stone monument of little interest.
That is, of course, far from the truth, for it was here, one night in
August 1305 that Wallace was captured by Edward's agents, before being
taken to London.
The main plaque on the monument states: ''This memorial erected in
1900 AD by public subscription is to mark the site of the house in which
the Hero of Scotland was basely betrayed and captured about midnight on
5th of August 1305 when alone with his faithful friend and co-patriot
Kerlie who was slain.''
A smaller plaque on the right side of the monument quotes Wallace at
Stirling Bridge saying: ''We are not here to sue for peace but to fight
for the freedom of our country.'' Another on the left side quotes Burns
and says: ''Who dared to nobly stem tyrannic pride or nobly die.''
Situated beside the main plaque on the front of the monument is a
smaller one with the same Latin words as used on the Smithfield plaque,
with the words ''Taught to Wallace in his boyhood'' inscribed below.
Members of the Wallace Clan Trust for Scotland, who research Scottish
history and hope to develop a heritage centre promoting Wallace and the
clan, point out that one common misconception about the area where the
monument is situated is that, as it is called Robroyston it is connected
with Rob Roy MacGregor, whose life was featured in another film released
earlier this year.
The area is, however, named after one of the servants of Menteith who
helped capture Wallace as he slept, apparently while journeying from
Glasgow to see Robert the Bruce at Stirling with important documents
signed by three Popes and recognising Scotland as a sovereign nation.
The servant, who was called Rau Raa, was awarded farmland for his part
in capturing Wallace. This land later became known as Rau Raa's toun and
is now Robroyston.
Seoras Wallace, who founded the Wallace Clan Trust in 1986, admits
that what happened that night in 1305 has become obscured over the
centuries, but believes Wallace broke free from the heavy detachment of
English soldiers who captured him and ran several hundred yards from the
stable to a well where he was recaptured. This point is now known as
Wallace's Well.
Seoras Wallace said: ''Wallace was caught totally unprepared and
without weaponry and ran as far as the well where he was quickly
recaptured. Menteith is supposed to have handcuffed him and said: 'Look,
put these on just now and we'll get you past these English soldiers'.
''Of course, as soon as they were on that was the beginning of the end
for Wallace.''
Speaking at the monument, wearing the period Highland clothing that is
worn by Wallace Clan Trust members on the set of the Braveheart film,
Seoras Wallace added: ''This memorial is not a symbol of the end to
people like us. It's a symbol of betrayal and I hope more people will
visit it.
''Wallace was set up by Robert the Bruce, who couldn't allow Wallace
to live because he (Bruce) would never be a rightful king, and, for me,
this monument has one clear warning for people. Watch your back.''

<HEADLINE>Fokker needs big cash injection. Dutch aircraft builder's woeswill affect many UK companies</HEADLINE>

ANXIOUS UK aerospace firms are watching developments at the
headquarters of the stricken Dutch aircraft builder Fokker, which last
week declared record first-half losses of 651m guilders.
Executives at Fokker's base at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport are racing
to complete a business plan within two weeks, which they hope will
persuade the Dutch Government to come to its rescue. Some analysts have
suggested that Fokker needs a cash injection of as much as 1500m
guilders to stay in business.
Late last week Fokker was forced into a humiliating public assurance
that Germany's Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) would honour the Dutch
company's debts. Dasa is a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, the motor and
engineering group that owns 51% of the Dutch aircraft builder.
Fokker's shares tumbled to an all-time low on Friday and its investors
will watching the opening of the Dutch bourse this morning with some
trepidation.
Fokker builds good aircraft, outselling its nearest British rival two
to one, but assembling planes in Holland is expensive. Labour and social
costs are high and the guilder's surge against the US dollar, in which
aircraft are priced, has left the constructor with losses of up to 25%
by value on every plane sold.
To cut costs the group is considering moving some work to low-wage,
dollar-based countries, said Fokker spokesman Leo Steijn.
This is a concern for the company's Dutch employees and many British
sub-contractors who assemble parts for the Fokker 90 and 100 airliners.
Every Fokker jet that takes to the skies is about 50% British in origin.
Derby-based Rolls-Royce supplies the engines for many Fokker planes
and Short Brothers in Belfast builds the wings which create hundreds of
man-hours of work. Other British firms supply avionics and every
UK-based company draws on dozens of others for components.
Some UK firms, however, could benefit from Fokker's troubles. The
biggest beneficiary, at least in the short-term, would be BAe, which is
competing with Fokker for a $500m contract to supply the Belgian airline
Sabena with about 20 regional aircraft.
Fokker was a European pioneer in aviation but has struggled to survive
in recent times.
The company's founder, Tony Fokker, supplied Baron von Richthofen, the
German ace of the First World War, with lethal tri-planes, built at a
Berlin plant.
But recent events have cast a shadow over one of the world's oldest
aerospace manufacturers. Behind Fokker's current problems lies a
distinguished past.
Since it was founded as a commercial aircraft builder on July 21,
1919, Fokker has designed and built over 125 different types of plane,
including the Fokker IV which made aviation history in 1922 in crossing
the United States coast-to-coast.
The company was among the pioneers of passenger flying. It built the
eight-seater Fokker VII in 1924 and made the first direct flight from
the Netherlands to the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) in the same year.
Its founder's death in December 1939 and the German invasion halted
project development during the Second World War. But in 1946 it was
rebuilt by the first post-occupation Government, eager to foster an
independent Dutch aerospace industry.
A 10-year marriage to German plane-maker VFW in the 1960s foreshadowed
Fokker's 1993 rescue by Dasa after optimism at the start of the 1990s
evaporated and the takeover became a lifesaver.
Depressed markets pushed Fokker into the red and prompted the first of
many state bailouts in 1987.
But the company was back in the black by 1990 with record profits of
83m guilders and predicting good times ahead -- spurring merger talks
with Dasa.
Within a year a world-wide recession took hold and Fokker's finances
were shattered. The downturn destroyed all hope of an equal partnership
with Dasa.
Eager for Fokker's impressive know-how and long track record, Dasa
agreed to pay 880m guilders in October 1992 for a 51% stake. But as the
market for aircraft plunged the Germans imposed new conditions and
forced the cost down to 686m guilders in a deal that was finally sealed
in March 1993.

JUST when it seemed that the number of British-registered major
pharmaceutical companies was about to be even more heavily reduced with
the independence of Fisons almost certain to be lost, a proposed
American-Swedish merger will help fill the gap.
Pharmacia of Sweden with annual sales running at SKr25bn, or about
#2200m, is teaming up with Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Michigan, whose annual
turnover is around the same size.
It is intended that the corporate heaquarters will be in London and
that the shares of Pharmacia and Upjohn, as the new company is to be
named, will be be listed on the London Stock Exchange as well as in New
York and Stockholm.
That move is highly logical given London's overwhelming dominance in
international equity trading.
Once the formalities are completed, probably in November, the merged
group will be in the European top five, the US top 15 and in the top 20
of Japanese phamaceutical companies.
Upjohn shareholders come out on top because they will receive 1.45 new
shares whereas those invested in Pharmacia will exchange on a one for
one basis.
About 27.5% of Pharmacia's shares are held by the Volvo car and truck
manufacturer which has been trying to sell the stake as well as the rest
of its non-automobile interests for the last year since the failure of
its proposed merger with Renault of France.
Pharmacia has been seeking for some time to increase its presence in
the US while Upjohn has felt vulnerable to takeover in a sector where
size and revenue to back up the research and development and marketing
programmes are of immense inportance.
Pharmacia and Upjohn yesterday said the combined research and
development expenditure will run at the equivalent of more than #600m.
Sales growth will be above the industry average helped by the
introduction of 28 new products and extensions over the next three
years. These include treatments for glaucoma, Parkinson's Disease,
cancer and Aids.
Pharmacia and Upjohn claim that there will not only be annual cost
savings of #300m but it will be one of the most debt-free pharmaceutical
groups in the world.
Already this year, BASF of Germany has acquired the Boots
pharmaceutical division for #840m while Glaxo successfully launched a
hostile #9000m takeover for Wellcome. Last week Rhone-Poulenc Rorer
(RPR), a Franco-US group, made a #1700m bid for Fisons, which is best
known for its asthma drugs.
That it will have to make a somewhat better offer to succeed is the
generally accepted international view of analysts.
Astra of Sweden and Schering-Plough of the US, both with a significant
exposure to the asthma drug sector, are being touted as possible
counter-bidders to RPR.

* A BRILLIANT, blazingly honest performance from Helen McCrory as Jo,
a single parent living in a drab Welsh valley town who suffers more
afflictions than Job, rescues Kar Francis's Streetlife from being just
one darn thing after another.
The film is exceedingly well made, and Francis has elicited fine
performances from his cast, especially the chorus of women with whom Jo
works in a sweat shop doing ironing. But the story really does pile on
the agony -- all those disasters inside nine months, for heaven's sake
-- and the resolution, involving a pretty policeman, takes a little
swallowing.
Jo, pregnant by her two-timing married lover, decides to have their
baby and, after she has given birth on her own, driven to distraction by
its incessant crying, suffers a mental breakdown and kills it. She has
more woes, but to reveal them would spoil the story. McCrory is
absolutely magnificent, a bawdy, bouncy, bottle blonde bursting with
energy, a sucker when it comes to men. You feel for, and with Jo. If
Edinburgh went in for best actress prizes McCrory would be out in front.
Michael Winterbottom, who made Butterfly Kiss, has done an equally
fine job with Go Now written by Jimmy McGovern and Paul Powell. It is a
moving true story about one of the lads, Nick, a football-mad Scot
(Robert Carlyle on top form), who contracts multiple sclerosis.
Nick falls in love with Karen (Juliet Aubrey) and they set up house
together. One day he suffers double vision, has a tingling in his arm.
Something is wrong. Carlyle conveys most powerfully the agonies endured
by this tough wee man facing up to the fact that his life, which has
been football, the lads, the pub and now Karen, is in ruins. It is a
fine wee movie.
This is turning out a vintage Festival for short films -- Bernard
Rudden's uncompromising version of Kafka's story, Hunger Artist, has
been widely admired, reassuring proof I was not alone in admiring it.
Others worth catching include the very funny The Isle of Voices,
directed by David Cairns based on a Robert Louis Stevenson story. The
feckless Cameron (Moray Hunter), whose father-in-law, Mackay (a lovely,
lip-smacking performance by Graham Crowden) is a miserly wizard,
discovers the old man's secret. Mackay has a time machine, a sort of
tin-tank version of Dr Who's policebox, in which he travels to the Isle
of Voices, a lost land whose seashells turn to gold coins when brought
back to the real world.
The predatory Mackay, invisible to the inhabitants, takes Cameron
along and greed prevails. So does justice.
It is being shown with the Italian Strange Stories, directed by Sandro
Baldoni, which is in effect three short films within a fourth. The
combination makes an unusually satisfying feature film. A father is
telling his teenage daughter stories on a train journey, the characters
in the stories being played by the actors who play the other occupants
of the compartment.
In the first a man is faced with death because he has forgotten to pay
the bill for his air, in the second a lonely woman goes to the
supermarket to buy a man for company, only to reject him because he is
past his sell-by date, and in the third two families living in flats
across a courtyard embark on a war to the death.

AN Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman are about to read their
poetry in a famous beer tent. Everyone is drinking German lager. The
Irishman steps up, is still for a long time, then begins in an almost
inaudible Dublin whisper: ''I am the centre of the universe''.
Slowly the momentum builds. The audience is amazed into utter and
trembling quietness. ''I am the centre of the universe.''
By the end, this refrain has become nine months pregnant with
surrealism and multiple ironies. I can hear the bubbles burst in my pint
of Beck's during the final strange silence before the applause.
Then the Scotsman bursts out with Datchie Sesames and names for
nameless things. He has already been playing some fast and intricate
guitar that evening and says he wants to find a Scots equivalent for
black-American jazz slang.
The poems are hard and tender.
Next comes a Liverpudlian, who can make adults listen seriously to
children's poetry and teach them to hear adult love poems with a child's
innocence.
The poets were Paul Durcan, Don Paterson, and Brian Patten, and
Saturday night at the Beck's Spiegeltent was only the second time I have
been completely enthralled by a poetry recital.
Durcan's unashamed depth and lyrical magic allowed the audience to
hear without forcing them to listen. All the usual barriers to poetry
readings fell away, allowing Paterson and Patten to speak to people
whose ears had just been cleared of wax.
The first poetry reading I ever heard which had a similar effect took
place the previous evening at the same Book Festival. Yehuda Amichai is
one of the few living writers who gives the phrase ''great poet'' some
content.
He gives life to qualities which are too often relegated to romantic
or traditional notions of the poet: the big political voice, a capacity
to see through suffering which is at once personal and societal, the
daring to find an inescapable beauty in an unflinching realism.
When he spoke of love, it came out as an experience and unembittered
understanding of war. And when he spoke about the poet's role, you
believed him: ''Poets are the frontline soldiers of literature. Prose
writers are like the generals in their bunkers. Literary critics are the
war historians.''
Amichai was the Book Festival's crowning event. Not that there has
been a lack of focus elsewhere. Over the past few days Irish writers,
both Northern and Southern, have yet again been putting English letters
to shame.
Colm Toibin, Colum McCann, Joseph O'Connor, Bernard MacLaverty, Ferdia
Mac Anna, and Brendan O'Carroll have displayed a range of the fiercely
comic, the politically engaged and the lyrically sweet, which is
evidence of creativity in competent flower.
And with Janice Galloway giving an angry lucidity to her perceptions
of how linguistic, sexual and class oppressions function in John Major's
Britain, the Book Festival has displayed steel as well as fire.

IN his attempt to quantify the nature of fun, Rich Hall reaches the
conclusion that it has a single unit of measurement: the barrowload of
monkeys. An evening with Rich Hall thus adds up to a wondrous amount of
wheeled simians. Rich's humour revolves around the inventive use of
sheets of perspex and cheese slices. He shuffles about the stage in a
beetle-browed, slightly hectoring manner, and with a mischievous glint
in his eye. He has fresh insights on Hugh Grant, budget deficits, and
British repression.
See him soon and you'll go ape with laughter.

WELCOME to one of the keenest companies on the Fringe. The orchestra
is ready to start bang on time. Well, there's a lot to get through in
the next 90 minutes. Pausing only for changes of Ukrainian costumes (and
there are miles of those, few of them suited for a heatwave), a quick
tune-up, and a well-earned hose down at half-time, the eighteen-strong
dance troupe get through a stack of work.
They have dance steps for every occasion, with much mock-coy pairing
off and fierce competitions for the ladies' attention (none of which you
should try at home unless you want a hernia). Not even the Monday wash
goes uncelebrated. The net result is as charming a way to spend
lunchtime as you'll find between now and Wednesday.

Patricia Fenn goes on a promenade in Paris knowing that if her legs
give out she will not be far from the nearest public transport system
PARIS is one big glorious cliche. It justifies every preconception.
Look for the budding chestnut trees, the fluttering tricolours, the tidy
children playing in the parks, the neat fountains, the bateaux mouches
on the silvery Seine and, presiding over all, that supreme icon the
Eiffel Tower, and you will not be disappointed. In one deep gulp you can
instantly savour the flavour.
Paris makes its own rules. Unlike the rest of France, Sundays and
fetes are good days to visit. The frenetic Parisians will have deserted
the capital, pointed their Peugeots towards their maisons secondaires in
Normandy or taken the TGV for a weekend in the south.
Their absence leaves the beautiful city at its best for tourists, with
space to spare and a slower pace to progress. You can actually stand in
the centre of the Place de la Concorde, normally a frantic screeching
fume-ridden melee, and select the best vantage point for photographs.
Museums on Sundays are cheaper or free, the metro is less crowded, there
are jostle-free tables to be had along the South Bank boulevards, all
making a long weekend excursion not only feasible, but an excellent
idea.
It is perfectly possible within that time to gain a worthwhile
impression of the city's many virtues because the heart of the city is
so compact. Walking is by far the best way to see, sniff, enjoy the
essential Paris. The Metro stations are closer together than in London
and the system is easy and cheap to use, so if the legs give out it will
never be far to the nearest point of alternative transports.
With more time, or greater familiarity, there are of course many
nearby excursion alternatives; I would strongly recommend taking the
Metro to Pere Lachaise cemetery, and to Sacre Coeur and Montparnasse,
and do try and fit in a walk round the Marais and Bastille areas, but
for first-timers and weekenders, here are two walks, one on the Right
Bank, and one on the Left, which cover most of the essential sights.
Taken at a brisk pace, with no stops along the way, either one could
be covered in an hour, but that would be a pity, because stopping and
starting, sitting in cafes and watching tout le monde pass by is an
important Parisian pastime which should not be neglected. I have
indicated some of my favourite watering holes along the way.
For both routes start in the city's focal point, Paris' largest
square, the Place de la Concorde. Look around before setting off. The
traffic can be lethal and crossing to the island on which stands the
3000-year-old obelisk presented to Louis-Philippe in 1795 by the viceroy
of Egypt can test the nerves. Courage! Which is what Louis XVI,
Marie-Antoinette, Danton and Robespierre, to name but four of the 1300
victims, needed when they faced Madame la Guillotine on this spot. When
passions cooled somewhat the square changed its name from Place de la
Revolution back to Concorde.
The seventeenth-century architect of the original square also designed
the two buildings flanking the Rue Royale as a home for the Comte de
Crillon. The one to the left is now one of Paris' most renowned hotels,
receiving royalty and pop stars alike, the Hotel de Crillon. That
heavily guarded building next door is the American Embassy.
Working anti-clockwise round the square, some pleasant gardens border
the Champs Elysees, particularly impressive from this vantage point at
night, when the red and yellow lights of many traffic lanes glitter like
fireflies up the magnificent avenue. By day it is, alas, no longer the
romantic fashionable promenade of yore. Car showrooms, airline offices
and fastfood outlets dilute the glamour. But it is still very agreeable
to stroll beneath the trees up one side (stop for a cafe creme at the
Rond Point) and back on the other (an aperitif at Fouquets). Save this
for another day though. Today we are heading in the opposite direction.
CROSS the Pont de la Concorde, one of the 35 bridges that span the
Seine, to take a stroll along the Left Bank quays. I would rate the art
gallery resurrected with typical Gallic imagination from the old Quai
d'Orsay railway station as a No.1 tourist must. The height, light and
scale of the building, designed as a palace before its first
reincarnation as a station and hotel, place it among the most
interesting of all museum settings, and its 1848-1914 collection of
paintings is supreme.
Most visitors hop straight on to the escalator that takes them to the
top-floor Impressionists, and these alone could happily fill a whole
morning, so save this experience for another day and continue the walk.
Bear in mind, however, the fact that the restaurant with the best
riverside views in the city is right here in the museum. If you did the
walk in reverse you could include a delectable tea-stop.
Browse along the Quai Voltaire, with its fine view of the Louvre
opposite, investigating the eclectic wares -- old posters, antiquarian
postcards and books -- on sale at the distinctive green-painted huts.
Turn right into the rue du Bac, named after a long defunct ferryboat,
and you are immediately immersed in a many-flavoured melee of artisans,
craftsmen, boutiques, art galleries and bistros, set in narrow shady
streets, a small-scale Paris all very different from the sophistication
of the Right Bank.
It is the unexpected treasures that particularly delight -- the
half-hidden gardens, the architectural details of the tall
eighteenth-century houses, the occasional grand mansion annexed by some
foreign ministry, the glimpse of cobbler, seamstress, picture framer,
intent at their trade. Turn left into the rue de l'Universite, then
right into the rue des Saints Peres, passing the grey bulk of the
university on your right.
One of the many charms of Paris is the abrupt transition within a few
yards from one mood to another. The upmarket tranquillity of the
quartier nearest to the river suddenly gives way to the brash bustling
classless boulevard St Germain, lined with brasseries buzzing with
gossip, as they always have been since the Left Bank was the
intellectual and artistic centre of Paris and indeed the whole of
Europe. The famous brasseries where the avant-garde used to assemble,
are ideal for casual dining, because of their long opening hours
(including Sundays and late evening), and wide range of options, from a
simple pression to a full-scale dinner.
Having turned left on to the boulevard, look for two of the most
famous brasseries on your right, first Les Deux Magots and then, on the
corner of the Place St Germain des Pres, the Brasserie Lipp. Sit here
for a while at a pavement table or in the glassed-in terrace for a
serious session of people-watching (and a surprisingly reasonable snack
lunch). Opposite is the 12C church of St Germain des Pres, whose massive
flying buttresses are among the oldest in France.
Turn left into the rue Boneparte then right after the corner garden,
into the rue de l'Abbaye, then left into the rue Furstenberg, crossing a
delightful little square where Delacroix once lived, then left into the
rue Jacob with its many antique and decorating shops. Right into the rue
Bonaparte again, passing the imposing entrance of the Ecole des Beaux
Arts, always animated with art students en route either to their studies
or to a cafe, like La Palette, a favourite meeting place of artists and
gallery owners.
Cross Paris's oldest and most famous bridge, the Pont Neuf, admiring
the equestrian statue of Henri IV, who inaugurated the ''new bridge'' in
1607 by galloping across it on his charger. Now we are in the historic
heart of Paris, the Ile de la Cite. Its cathedral, Notre Dame, is an
obvious tourist magnet but none the less impressive. By all means spend
an hour or so, walking all round Notre Dame, investigating its shadowy
interior with a good guide book, resting in the pretty flowery garden in
the Square Jean XXIII, overlooking the Seine, but do not fail to
allocate time to the island's second treasure, the glorious Sainte
Chapelle, Louis XIV's private chapel, discreetly tucked away in a
courtyard behind the Palais de Justice in the bvd du Palais.
A footbridge-crossing away, floats another Seine island, the Ile St
Louis, smaller, quieter, more residential, less tourist-ridden than its
big brother, well worth investigating. One long street, full of
restaurants and boutiques, runs through its centre, crossed by short
side-streets lined with expensive seventeenth-century townhouses.
CROSS over to the Tuileries gardens, where l'Orangerie is the home of
the extensive Walter-Guillaume collection of Impressionists, notably
Monet's eight gigantic panels of water lilies, inspired by his Giverny
home. The twin Second Empire pavilion at the other end of the gardens is
the Jeu de Paume, once an indoor tennis court, subsequently the most
popular gallery in Paris when it housed the Impressionist paintings now
at the Musee d'Orsay. Today its successfully modernised interior is used
to display exhibitions of international contemporary art.
From here you have a choice. If the sun shines, continue to stroll
along the Terrasse des Feuillants, enjoying the gardens laid out by Le
Notre in the seventeenth century; alternatively cross to the arcaded rue
de Rivoli. The tiny boutiques that huddle along its length are gradually
giving way to souvenir trash, but there are still some vestiges of the
elegance of a more discriminating age. One shop selling gloves of every
imaginary colour and style, with comfortably bosomy salesladies who
judge your size at a glance and show you the correct way to draw on the
soft leather, has been there since the days when it would have been
unthinkable for a lady to stroll abroad without her gloves.
Also in the rue de Rivoli at No.224 is Calignari, the first English
bookshop ever to open up on the Continent, which retains its
old-fashioned style, and whose assistants have time to chat. No.248 used
to be the site of the Old English Tea Room, where nostalgic expats used
to gather to sip Earl Grey. No tea nowadays but plenty of mental
stimulation from an excellent branch of W H Smith. Happily a worthy
teatime replacement is at hand. Angelina at No.226 is the ultimate
Parisian salon de the, as Belle Epoque as you could wish with its stucco
columns and gilt mirrors. It's not only the decor that's delectable --
here is hot chocolate to die for and delicate patisserie masterpieces.
Well worth a detour, whichever direction you're walking.
Sit here and decide if this is going to be a Louvre day. Preferably
not, since the museum is so vast that neither time nor stamina will
remain for anything else. But do cross the road and walk through the
magnificent courtyards. The best day to do this is Tuesday when the
galleries are closed and only a few disappointed tourists share the
vision in the central Cour Napoleon of the controversial transparent
pyramid. Designed by the Chino-American architect IM Pei, this is
compulsory viewing for any visitor to Paris, in order to have a personal
view on its worthiness.
Cross back to the Place du Palais Royal, turn sharp left, cross the
rue St Honore to the Comedie Francaise and, via a discreet arch, you
will enter the hidden village of the Palais Royal and its gardens.
Originally designed for Cardinal Richelieu, who died here in 1642, the
palace acquired royal status when Anne of Austria moved in with her son
Louis XIV and made it a lively centre of fashion and scandal; nowadays
it is more prosaically occupied by the Ministry of Culture.
The gardens and surrounding arcades (good wet weather choice) are
still an attractive rendezvous, combining eighteenth-century formality
with the controversial contemporary Buren landscaping of black and white
striped columns sunken into underground waterways.
Walk to the end of the gardens, past the historic restaurant Le Grand
Vefour, where the dinner menu starts at #90 and into the rue des Petits
Champs, passing the Bibliotecque Nationale on your right before turning
right up the Avenue de l'Opera. Sumptuously ornate, the opera house is
as typical a monument to 2nd Empire over-the-top architecture as you
could wish. Call in to view Garnier's marble and gilt baroque interior,
particularly the grand staircase, and picture the scenes of the opera's
heyday.
Time for more refreshment? Good, because in the Place de l'Opera is
the Cafe de la Paix; they say if you sit there long enough you are bound
to see someone you know.
Cross the Bvd des Capucines to the rue de la Paix, in which all the
world-famous jewellery shops are located, to the no less classy Place
Vendome. Here more jewellers, parfumeries and the legendary Ritz Hotel
all contribute to the loadsamoney character of this ultimate symbol of
Parisian chic. Turn right into the rue St Honore for some more window
shopping, this time for designer label couture. With the present
exchange rate, window-shopping will probably have to do.

AFTER thirty-odd years, Ray Davies is still plainly kinked. Or Kinked.
Bent out of shape by the same things which spur him artistically.
Feelings of adolescent frustration. Anti-authoritarian bitterness. The
desire for revenge. Bloody-mindedness. A sense of being crippled. This
emerges via Ray's selected readings from X-Ray, his semi-fictionalised
autobiography. And then he sings a bit of doggerel about having been
duped out of songwriting royalties by publishers. Thankfully he sings
primal Kinks' songs , too. Vitriolic, twisted stuff like Dedicated
Follower Of Fashion, Tired Of Waiting, Dead End Street. Supercharged
songs performed Unplugged. Ray also admits that he didn't manage to get
the last word with John Lennon back in '64, which maybe tells you more
about Ray's ultimate worth than Ray realises it does.

THERE'S no denying that Andrew Buckland is a formidable performer. So
capable is he of jumping from character to character, each part
distinguished with crisply realised physical detail, that the actor is
even managing to perform Feedback in Edinburgh in the absence of his
co-performer from Mouthpeace Theatre who is on his sickbed in South
Africa.
Anyone with the wit and imagination to take the shape of a discarded
apple, the back leg of a pig, plus selected cheeses is all right in my
book.
I can't, however, show so much enthusiasm for the play, a kind of
eco-fable about big business exploitation of the world's food resources.
It's neither funny enough nor involving enough to justify Buckland's
strenuous efforts and, once you've marvelled at his dexterity, it's all
rather tedious.

IN Auschwitz there are only two kinds of people -- the dead and the
living: the drowned and the saved as they are known.
What it takes to be saved -- to survive the organised rigours of work
and malnutrition, the regular culls, the random brutality -- is the core
of this finely wrought production by a young English company Big Spirit.
Drawing on the writings of Barbara Rogasky and Primo Levi -- played by
Ben Whishaw, he is the main character, here -- the group offer glimpses
of horror that are all the more poignant for avoiding blatant shock.
Terror and sudden death come in movement sequences of stark
simplicity, while the text deftly shades in Levi's dreams and fears. A
sensitive and powerfully dramatic marking of the liberation of Auschwitz
50 years ago.

WITH Sir Charles Mackerras at the helm, it was not surprising that
Dvorak's curious, unpredictable, yet endearing Requiem emerged on
Saturday sounding sometimes like Janacek. Its violent little rhythmic
outbursts, its repetitions, its touches of eccentricity, its individual
way of treating the Latin words seemed unusually full of foretastes of
Dvorak's great Czech successor, making up for the lack of grandeur and
unity from which this work is traditionally said to suffer in comparison
with the requiems of Verdi and Berlioz.
George Bernard Shaw, dismissing it as mechanically solemn and
trivially genteel, evidently missed the aspects of the music upon which
Sir Charles so productively concentrated. The work's pools of purple,
which in bad performances can seem so embarrassing, were shot through
with sharp and bracing colours. Even the Dies Irae, long deemed a feebly
Victorian view of the Last Judgment, was made to sound odd rather than
simply inept. To say that the performance was unfailingly interesting
would be to exaggerate, but Sir Charles surely proved that the work does
not deserve its neglect.
All it requires -- though this is easier said than done -- are
performances as perceptive as Saturday's, from figures who can respond
as thrillingly as the Edinburgh Festival Chorus to the conductor's
clear-cut demands and from a solo quartet crowned by the pure, clear
soprano voice of Jane Eaglen. Though Dvorak, in donning his mortician's
garb, suppressed many of the most recognisable features of his own
style, Sir Charles gave the music a glow, even if the Royal SNO would
probably have preferred to be playing the D minor symphony.
Randi Stene, Thomas Moser, and Alastair Miles shared Eaglen's ability
to make the solos sound operatic rather than drearily liturgical. The
performance as a whole prompted new admiration for an often despised
score. During a Dvorak survey such as Edinburgh's, one could hardly ask
for more.

NOT only does the Dorset Youth Orchestra look mature, it has a sound
to match. All the more disappointing then that under young conductor
Robin Browning, their first half run through of works by
Rimsky-Korsakov, Copland, and Barber should have lacked any real soul.
They more than compensated, however, with an exhilarating account of
Michael Torke's Bright, Blue Music, a rollicking mixture of quirky
rhythms, amid rising and falling cascades of orchestral colouring which
was all performed with pin-sharp precision.
Post interval, proving their real worth, was an ambitious go at
Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 6. The opening adagio had a full warm tone
while highly animated conducting, including vertical take-off, brought
spirited playing in the central allegros, rounded off by an effectively
sensitive finale. Much deserved applause from a near full house.

LABOUR moderates used to be fond of saying that the party's approach
to politics ''owed more to Methodism than to Marxism''. A claim which
could be made good over virtually all the party's history. Some of the
current unease in the party is felt by those who fear, even if they
wouldn't quite put it this way, that New Labour may owe more to
Christian and social democracy than to traditional socialism.
I say traditional socialism as it is possible to define socialism in
so many different ways that every member of the Labour Party can put
hand on heart and say ''I am a socialist''.
Traditional socialism was defined as the scheme of social organisation
which places the means of production and distribution in the hands of
the community. This was generally coupled in Britain with the assurance
that the manufacture of Blackpool rock and the operations of corner
shops would not be brought under state control. This theory was
symbolised by Clause 4. It is true that no Labour Government either came
close to carrying out its principles or indeed showed any inclination to
do so. But there it was.
Mr Blair has swept Clause 4 away and he and his lieutenants have made
clear that they have no thought of recapturing the ''commanding
heights'' of the economy for the public sector. So we may well say
traditional socialism is dead and mourn it if we wish.
Social democracy used to be defined as the achievement of socialism by
a gradual and democratic process. Mr Kinnock, and of course many others,
used to take account of the fears of some voters that socialism had
something inherently totalitarian about it by insisting that he was ''a
Democratic Socialist''.
Only on the right did people unblushingly admit that they were social
democrats rather than socialists, some of them proving this by leaving
and forming a social democratic party. To the traditional socialist
social democrats were pale imitations who accepted the capitalist system
while trying to smooth its sharper edges. To the social democrat,
increasingly as the century progressed, the traditional socialist was a
dinosaur and the collapse of East European communism, with its
revelations of inefficiency as well as corruption, exposed their theory
as one that would not work.
The traditional socialist could reply that it was public control not
state control they were after and that had not been tried.
Leaving them to fight it out we can note that the political-economical
argument has swung so much the other way that the main left-of-centre
party now favours a mixed economy with most of it in the private sector
while the right-of-centre party is moving towards privatising
practically everything but the police force and the Armed Services, and
the Adam Smith Institute may get round to producing a plausible paper on
the cost effectiveness of mercenaries.
But the old left of New Labour are more concerned about Mr Blair's
rapid advance on the centre ground, as it is, from their point of view,
an advance rightwards being conducted at high speed.
Mr Blair, they think, is a social democrat and probably a Christian
democrat as well. Mr Blair, though, as convinced as almost every British
politician that a confessional party would not work in Britain and would
not be a good thing if it did, is a practising Christian and has taken
on board political ideas which have on the continent found their most
congenial home in the Christian democratic parties.
It may be some comfort to the worriers that Christian democrats tend
to regard Conservatives as too right wing. The moderate left have been
delighted to see the European Union constantly nudging the Conservative
Government in more left-wing directions than it wants to go. Resistance
to the Social Chapter represents Major's last stand and it could yet go
the way of Custer's.
Blair apologists would, I think, simply say that the old left are out
of date in considering the political struggle as one between unfettered
capitalism and public ownership. They are looking to a future where the
wealth-creating abilities of capitalism can be harnessed by a system of
public regulation providing a level playing field for all. There is also
recognition that attempts to impose an egalitarian system by legislation
may be as undesirable as it is difficult, but that action to ensure that
public ideas of fairness are observed has a better chance of success.
One critic complained that Mr Blair's speeches contained strings of
moral truisms without being specific about how these might be converted
into politial action. It is probably true that New Labour is so
desperate to win the next election that it is unlikely to reveal any
policy with the potential to alienate large groups of voters. To that
extent it may well win on a bland prospectus because the voters have had
enough of the Tories.
Nevertheless I am prepared to bet that if and when a Blair Government
does produce policies they will prove to be consistent with the general
principles set out in the speeches. Like Mrs Thatcher he will come to
power with a philosophy which easily translates into political action.

THE trademark of the Hebrides Ensemble has always been performing
excellence. From that point of view alone, the concert they gave
yesterday as part of the BBC/Edinburgh Festival Scottish Premiere series
was, by their own standards, highly successful. (And given before a big
audience, too, a fact always worth observing at contemporary music
concerts.)
Fantasy was the name of the Hebrides game yesterday: Judith Weir's
Distance and Enchantment, with its mistily evocative effects where
sounds generated by the instruments are cleverly orchestrated so that
they appear to be swathed in a halo of echoes, is richly inspired by
folklore. The ensemble brought out the full atmospheric potential of the
piece, unveiling also the dramatic undertow where an ominous tread turns
into a threatening march.
James Clapperton, who has made his name as a virtuoso pianist on the
international contemporary circuit, produced a huge, 22-minute piece --
Elrich Fantasyis -- for yesterday's world premiere. Though he suggested,
in a pre-performance talk, that the Scottish elements in his work might
not be easily discerned, Clapperton's references to tradition -- from
medieval dance rhythms to reels -- haunted every bar of the piece.
Scored for violin, cello, clarinet, and piano, Elrich Fantasyis is a
superb piece, full of spectral and ethereal music, an expert use of
silence as a dramatic device, and a series of virtuoso demands
brilliantly met by the players. The long, elegiac wind-down towards the
end of the piece was like the slow and gentle closing of the door on a
nostalgic memory.
Kenneth Leighton's Fantasy on an American Hymn Tune, though containing
some longueurs, was given a decisive and dramatic performance by the
Hebrides, especially in its characteristic driving, rhythmic passages.

CONRAD WILSON is impressed with composer Emmanuel Nunes's masterly
control of pace and depth of emotion
WHO is Emmanuel Nunes? The bespectacled face staring solemnly from the
Edinburgh Festival's programme book on Saturday bore no resemblance to
the composer who took his bow at the end of the two concerts of his own
works in two separate venues. Though scarcely known in Britain, and
allotted only one short paragraph in The New Grove, this 54-year-old
Portuguese, now professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, is
clearly a major figure of modern music.
With his dauntingly didactic Darmstadt background, he could have been
just another person to fall into the void of intricate abstraction
between the pillars of Boulez and Stockhausen. And with a printed
tribute declaring his works to be veritable cathedrals ''hewn out of
rock, tensed between heaven and earth'', he could seem to be just one
more aspiring Messiaen. But the chamber pieces performed at St Bernard's
Church, and the impressively capacious portmanteau of a composition that
required most of the floor space and every gallery of the McEwan Hall
for its execution later in the evening, suggested something rather
different.
The voice of Nunes may have had familiar overtones, but what it said
was very much his own.
Though the massive Quodlibet that culminated Brian McMaster's Nunes
survey was the most audacious of the works performed, the composer
showed that he could pare down his ideas to a dialogue for solo violin
and clarinet entitled Versus I and grip us for 20 minutes with equal
ease. This, surely, was the token of someone in full command of his
material. Separated from each other by the width of the church's
platform, the two instrumentalists, members of the excellent
Geneva-based Ensemble Contrechamps, demonstrated that the sustained cut
and thrust of this epicurean discourse was the stuff of real duo music.
In Nachtmusik I, darker, more disturbing tints were introduced by a
quintet in which the violin and clarinet were replaced by deeper-toned
instruments. Here the sectional writing, and the spacing of the players,
seemed a preparation for the 12 precisely-timed movements, or
cliff-faces, of Quodlibet later in the evening, when illuminated digital
clocks kept the performers and the large audience in close touch with
the work's 56-minute progress.
Though the sounds, within the echoes and ricochets of the hall's
reverberant acoustics, were often sensational, it seemed plain that
Nunes was not merely creating noise for its own sake. And though the
need for two mobile conductors initially standing back-to-back,
underlined the complexity of the composer's demands upon the resources
of the splendidly attentive BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the
dramatically changing timbres of the music proved themselves worth
everybody's effort.
If, at first acquaintance, I detected no audible build-up towards some
definite climax -- the work could easily, it seemed, have been shorter
or longer than it was -- the variety of incident, the light and shade,
the big and small effects, the pockets of players shifting from place to
place in the auditorium, the puncturing of delicate string tone by
rasping brass, the sudden rattle of percussion kept attention fully
gripped.
Written in the first place for the octagonal Coliseu dos Recreios,
Lisbon's popular palace of entertainment where Messiaen's
Transfiguration had its premiere, Quodlibet found what seemed an ideal
new setting in Edinburgh's extravagantly grandiose graduation hall. For
all its seriousness, there was something circus-like about this grandly
circling music, finely controlled by Kasper de Roo and Emilio Pomarico.
By modern standards, moreover, Nunes revealed a masterly control of
pace. Unlike other works of its kind, this music was no stagnant pond,
but a deep, tidal lake along which storms fiercely hurtled.

SHE appeared on every news bulletin. An earnest spokesperson for a
pro-life organisation condemning the suggestion that a woman who had
been in a persistent vegetative state for many years should be allowed
to die. She would meet her death when the hospital withdrew nourishment.
But denying any such patient food and water was a denial of the most
basic human rights asserted the interviewee.
It was the kind of televised exchange which made it very difficult not
to bite the carpet. And it was the kind of exchange given equal
prominence just three weeks before when the parents of a small child
dying in some pain had begged the authorities to hasten the inevitable.
Always someone appears suggesting that whatever the circumstances
passive euthanasia -- allowing someone to die rather than killing them
-- will swiftly lead to the end of civilisation as we know it.
Let me suggest, in contrast, that an acceptance of euthanasia as an
option in very particular circumstances might instead be the start of a
civilising process. There is a research project currently being
undertaken at Glasgow University which is exploring the subject in some
depth, examining among other things the very complex legal and medical
pitfalls involved. When it is complete, hopefully it will make a full
and intelligent contribution to the debate.
And an intelligent input into an area more normally characterised by
ill-informed hysteria will be both overdue and very welcome. I confess
to being irritated by the very term pro-life which has been attached to
an assortment of organisations on both sides of the Atlantic, some of
them on the fanatical side of passionate. (Can there be a more ghastly
irony than an American ''pro-life'' campaigner shooting dead a doctor
who carried out legal abortions?)
The very use of the the term pro-life implies that those not sharing
that perspective are somehow pro-death. And indeed if you believe that
abortion, whatever the reason, is murder then I suppose that is the
logical corollary. My own bottom line is that parents or single women
faced with agonising decisions about possible terminations are in more
crucial need of support than sermons. And that ultimately the decision
has to be theirs.
But when the controversy broadens out into the field of euthanasia the
arguments become even more rabid. We are constantly assured that if any
move is made towards allowing people a choice in their own manner of
leaving this earth there will then follow a stampede of greedy offspring
seeking legal shortcuts to bump off unhealthy but wealthy and
none-too-wise parents.
It is suggested, too, that this is part of a hidden agenda which
includes not just killing off elderly dependants, but genetically
engineering birth so that no handicapped or less-than-perfect child is
born. That seems to me little more than hysterical nonsense but its
constant repetition may be enough to persuade some of the public that
the threat is real rather than manufactured.
A much more reasoned opposition to any relaxation of the laws
permitting passive euthanasia is based on the belief that people who
sign so-called living wills while still of sound mind and body, may
totally change their mind later. That however poor their quality of life
the survival instinct may overpower the desire for relief from pain or
illness. People making these arguments suggest, too, that we cannot
assess for sure the wishes of someone suffering from severe dementia.
These are fair and rational points deserving of respect.
But surely equally deserving of examination are the kinds of
circumstances in which very many thousands find themselves without hope
of relief. Can it really make sense to prolong the daily agony of the
relations of someone in the kind of vegetative state which makes them a
living human being only in the most technical terms? Can it really be
Christian to blow the whistle on a doctor who, having watched a patient
endure years of an arthritic agony beyond the control of the most
sophisticated pain relief, finally bows to her and her family's request
to let her find some peace? Should a person in the advanced stage of one
of the more debilitating ailments leading to total dependence not have
some choice as to whether or not they wish to spend their final years in
a condition they find intolerable?
For some people these questions have a simple answer. They have
concluded as part of their personal credo that intervening in the
''natural'' lifespan is immoral and unethical.
But for many millions more life, and death, are not invested with the
same set of certainties. And just as the debate over much of modern
medicine such as in vitro fertilisation has produced the need to find
new ethical parameters within which the medical profession can work, so
too do we need to re-examine euthanasia and frankly to discuss the legal
and medical and moral implications.
Not least because in countries such as the Netherlands and some
American states the legal waters have been muddied by considerable
hypocrisy.
Keeping euthanasia illegal, but choosing not to prosecute, is a messy
compromise.
Like many people I have watched someone close die who constantly
longed for what she saw as the welcome escape of a relatively dignified
death. I wonder still if that should have been anyone's business but her
own.

THE Edinburgh Festival got down to some serious playing last night
with the arrival of the big boys of the orchestral world. The St
Petersburg Philharmonic didn't so much blow into town as erupt. They
have two festival concerts, one each with their two conductors, Mariss
Jansons and Yuri Temirkanov. Last night it was the hottest ticket in
town, with a packed house and a queue of hopefuls outside. Nae chance;
everybody who's anybody knows what's in store when the St Petersburg
arrive, and tickets are like gold dust.
And that's the funny thing about this great orchestra. They've been in
Scotland many, many times now, but it doesn't matter how often you hear
them; it doesn't matter how intimately you know their style. Every time
is like new; there is always a sense of shock as the incredible depth of
sound whacks you for the first time in the evening. And, every time, the
staggering virtuosity of the orchestra smacks you in the chops as though
you haven't experienced it before.
Last night Mariss Jansons was out of the stocks like a greyhound with
Dvorak's Eighth Symphony. What an amazing conductor. Straining at the
leash, all pent-up dynamism and energy, he powered the orchestra though
the opening movement; it's never seemed so fast, driving up to its
climax in a storm of tension. At the end you're either drained or
sitting with an inane grin on your face.
To the slow movement he brought a rich, dark, quality, more Russian
than Czech, but entirely apt. And while he pounced on phrases like a
tiger going for the kill (the response of the orchestra was stunning)
Jansons was not without poetry -- the third movement was luxurious and
suave, before the finale cut loose with stamping rhythms and blazing
intensity. And, as ever with this man, there were a million subtleties
to savour.
The second half was all Prokofiev, a selection from Romeo and Juliet
that, oddly, seemed to favour the grotesque and quirky numbers, leaving
out, for example, the big love music. Still, this was raw meat, with
Jansons in ferocious form, and the rhythms of the St Petersburg Phil
gripping with a bite like a pit bull terrier. They're back tomorrow with
Temirkanov the Terror; watch out for sparks.

BRUSSELS: Belgium will try to bury the memory of one of football's
worst disasters this week with the opening of a new #18m sport stadium
on the site of the 1985 Heysel disaster, in which 39 people died.
Tomorrow's inauguration of the complex, renamed the King Baudouin
stadium, will attempt to draw a line under the tragedy, which resulted
from a stampede by hundreds of Liverpool fans into supporters of match
rivals Juventus.

NOT another warm, sunny day tomorrow! Can we stand much more of this
sustained summer -- we, a nation living in houses built to keep in
warmth, working in double-glazed offices with no air conditioning? The
almost unimaginable is beginning to happen. Scots are beginning to
complain that our summer has been just too good. And I'm not talking
about the relative few in this country who are not being allowed to
water their gardens or hose down their cars.
It's been a tough couple of months for anyone who is asthmatic or has
other bronchial complaints, a tiring time for pregnant women, and
purgatory for anyone who is overweight and not only looks terrible in
skimpy clothes but feels as if every crevice is oozing sweat and every
fleshy part is sticking to its neighbour.
The most frightening thought is that this could be a taste of the
future. Yes I know that just because this summer is likely to be the
hottest for 50 years we are not necessarily staring at proof of global
warming. The last really hot summer was 19 years ago, the one before
that 40 years ago.
But it has focused our minds, for a change, on the real possibility
that planet earth is indeed undergoing a change in climate and that the
root cause of this is man-made.
Probably a more reliable indicator of global warming is the recent
series of unseasonable weather occurrences across the world -- blizzards
in parts of New Zealand that would normally see only rainfall, floods in
the normally parched dry Gulf states, hurricanes here, typhoons there.
It's very tempting for us in Scotland to contemplate what global
warming would mean for us. A rise in temperature of 0.2C per decade.
Would any of us be able to tell the difference, even over 30 or 40
years? The possible extinction of some rare alpine plants, and a couple
of species of bird, balanced against the arrival of some more exotic
species of orchids and butterflies? How many of us would recognise a
Camberwell Beauty if it landed in our soup? But just a minute.
What is it that the environmentalists are continually exhorting us to
do? To think global and act local? It may not be very sound
grammatically, but you get the idea. Do what you can in your own home to
save energy and every little bit will add up to making a difference. Our
children have got the message.
But what worries me is a growing trend of what might be called
environmental fascism. The idea that saving our precious lifestyles in
the developed world is more important than the future of whole
communities in developing countries.
We need look no further than the venerable wise men of the IPCC -- the
International Panel on Climate Change -- a United Nations committee made
up of some of the world's finest scientific brains, the very people
whose warnings on global warming in the 1980s put the frighteners on Mrs
Thatcher.
Reports this week claim that members of a working party of the IPCC
have produced an analysis which values the lives of people in rich
nations up to 15 times higher than those in poor countries, and have
come to the conclusion that it is quite simply not cost-effective to
take the kind of action necessary to halt global warming.
At the heart of the issue are some of the techniques developed by
environmental economists for analysing the costs and benefits of
preventing the so-called greenhouse effect in which emissions of certain
gases are thought to warm up the earth's atmosphere and cause climate
change. The IPCC working party has apparently placed values on human
lives ranging from $1.5m for people from the richest countries down to
$100,000 for those in poorer developing nations -- valuations based on
assessments of a community's willingness and ability to pay to avoid
risk of death.
India, or Bangladesh, or Brazil, or any of the other nations up to
their necks in debt to international banks, quite simply do not have the
ability to pay to prevent pollution from the few industries they have.
Let us not forget that it is the carbon dioxide emissions from the
United States, and Western Europe, that caused the problem in the first
place. But it is the people living in the low-lying islands in the South
Pacific whose very existence is threatened by rises in sea water level,
the poor of the Third World who will be hit by floods, droughts,
hurricanes, and mass migrations caused by desertification. The aid
agencies who follow each terrible famine and disaster can tell us that.
Let's be honest. The value system of the Western world does have a
hierarchy of human life. Few would admit that the death of 50 Canadians
in a freak storm would concern them more than the loss of the
inhabitants of five shanty towns in mainland China.
But, deep down, that is what happens, even though we know that it is
wrong.
So when we are told to think globally, we should perhaps start urging
our politicians to think the unthinkable -- to revise world economic
strategies along the lines of subsidising developing countries' economic
growth, without imposing crippling debt burdens, to allow them to move
straight to clean technology instead of inheriting the dirty industrial
cast-offs we no longer want. Because we had better face facts, that
using energy efficient light bulbs in your Glasgow flat and taking the
tube to work is just not going to be enough.

IN BED WITH AN ELEPHANT
by Ludovic Kennedy
Bantam Press: #16.99
STRUGGLING with his Anglo-Scots condition, while being raised in
England, Ludovic Kennedy had a childhood experience which helped sort
out his identity. As a small boy visiting Scotland in the 1920s, he was
sitting on Culloden Moor, eating treacle scones and baps and listening
to his mother as she recounted the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie,
appropriately to the background skirl of a distant piper.
Suddenly it all came clear and he was propelled towards an acceptance
of his Scottishness. Like many such people, he became fiercely patriotic
and stands today for home rule.
Indeed, for the title of his book he went to the 1969 Washington
speech of Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, who told the
Americans that living next to them was like sleeping with an elephant:
No matter how friendly and even-tempered the beast, one was affected by
every twitch and grunt.
That is also Kennedy's Scottish feeling about the English, for whom he
thinks the time has come to move over or, better still, move out.
Just as he sat at the scene of Culloden's bloody battle and took that
as his cue to condense the story of Prince Charlie, so does he manoeuvre
himself around Scotland, at different times of his life, and find reason
for producing potted histories of notable moments and portraits of
memorable figures, from William Wallace and Mary Queen of Scots to David
Hume, James Boswell, Robert Burns, and the modern-day Ian Hamilton, who
recovered the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey.
Indeed his retelling of that 1950 drama is one of the highlights of
this volume.
In the structure of a book like this you detect the spade-work of a
good researcher, providing the author with material which he can then
sweep into the framework of his own travels and experience.
There is nothing wrong with that and indeed for those wishing to avoid
heavier tomes this book is a splendid way of picking up the essence of
our history. He brings a lively and often humorous touch to whatever he
writes.
Ludovic Kennedy reminds us of his rather privileged, uppercrust
background, though none of it impresses me half as much as the fact that
he landed the gorgeous ballerina, Moira Shearer, as his wife! That is
something for which he can take the credit.
When the young Kennedy came on holiday to Islay he couldn't understand
the taboo on Sunday golf. How did that come about? So we get the story
of John Knox and the Reformation -- and onward to the burning of
so-called witches (some were innocent victims) for which husbands were
obliged to cough up the cost of execution.
Centuries of condemnatory preaching left its mark on the Scottish
character but, despite its repressive nature, the author thinks the
puritan ideal has been beneficial. It led to thrift, diligence,
intellectual integrity, and sound judgment, without which the Scots
would not have so influenced the world.
In the days approaching the Second World War Kennedy went to Skye for
a week of fishing and to attend the Portree Games and the balls. That
leads us to those other distinguished visitors to Skye, Samuel Johnson
and James Boswell.
He recalls how Johnson, with his supercilious attitude to the Scots,
first encountered the Scottish Boswell, who was so anxious to meet him
that he blustered out: ''Mr Johnson, I do indeed come from Scotland but
I cannot help it.''
Though his tongue was often in his cheek, Johnson had no end of
insults. ''Much may be made of a Scotsman,'' he said, ''if he be caught
young.''
I had not quite realised the extent of Boswell's gambling and
womanising. He really was a lad for the rumpy-pumpy, complete with
condoms made from sheep's bladders or wetted linen. He would write of
his encounters, as in ''I met with a monstrous big whore in the Strand
whom I had a great curiosity to lubricate, as the saying is.''
When they reached Skye on their Scottish journey, Johnson and Boswell
were entertained by none other than Flora Macdonald, by then released
from the Tower of London for her part in aiding Prince Charlie's escape.
Johnson actually slept in the bed occupied by the prince 27 years
earlier.
Kennedy was off to the Navy in the Second World War and sailed for
Scapa Flow, where he spent much of the war. His father had flown south
from Islay to take command of HMS Rawalpindi.
It was from there in Scapa that Jellicoe's Grand Fleet had sailed for
the battle of Jutland. It was there that the Royal Oak was sunk with 800
lives lost.
And it was up the nearby Norwegian coast that the German battleships
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau crept unnoticed, sighted the Rawalpindi off
Iceland and shelled her till she blazed from end to end. Kennedy's
father and 263 of his crew perished.
Before leaving the Orkney area, Kennedy takes in the story of Skara
Brae, that prehistoric village uncovered in 1850, having lain for nearly
5000 years with its furniture still intact.
Then it is on to Edward, Hammer of the Scots, and the terrible fate of
our own greatest hero, William Wallace, which still lies at the root of
so much anti-English feeling in Scotland.
It was history like that -- and how the English had taken Scotland's
symbol of nationhood, the Stone of Destiny, to London -- which fired the
imagination of a tailor's son from Paisley, Ian Hamilton, a law student
at Glasgow University in 1950.
His successful attempt to break into Westminster Abbey in the dead of
night and bring that stone back to Scotland was the sensation of its
time, giving Hamilton the legendary status which he has now enjoyed for
45 years.
Ludovic Kennedy tells the story with full nail-biting suspense, a
modern drama which may still come as a surprise to a younger generation.
So we gain the flavour of men like Burns and the philosopher David
Hume and hear of famous visitors to Edinburgh, including Charles
Dickens, who received the freedom of the city.
Kennedy was less impressed with the 1988 visit of Mrs Thatcher, who
seems to have invited herself to the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland. He is scathing about her ''Sermon on the Mound,'' surpassed
only by his assessment of the lady's public persona, which he sees as
''almost totally repulsive -- pretentious, arrogant, raucous,
patronising, humourless, vain, histrionic, self-pitying, and partly
deranged''.
I don't know what Mrs Thatcher thinks of Ludovic Kennedy. But if she
were looking for flaws in his book she might spot that he appoints
Margaret Herbison as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly in
1994, when she was already 87 -- and 24 years past the event!
And that he gives Robert Burns a longer life than he actually had. But
it's a thoroughly good read for a' that.

SRI LANKA'S reputation for producing and exporting the perfect pot of
tea is being destroyed by ''fluff and sweepings'' and dyed artificial
teas.
A former Tea Board official said there were places along the coast
where ''refuse tea'' was turned into ''artifical tea''.
''These chaps put the tea into gunny bags and dip it in sea water for
a time until it turned black and then sold it,'' he told the Sunday
Times newspaper.
''In the past,'' he added, ''such teas were put back into the fields
as fertiliser.''
Tea first came to Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, last century when a leaf
blight wiped out the hill coffee plantations. Sri Lanka is now the
world's largest tea exporter.
A leading exporter was quoted as saying at least 33m lb of ''fluff and
sweepings'' were now on the open market. They were being treated with
chemical dyes and then exported.
''Good teas cannot be sold in the auction because rubbish is being
sold outside the auction,'' he said.
Trade Minister Kingsley Wickramaratne said the Ceylon tea name had
been tarnished in Russia after sub-standard teas had been shipped
there.--Reuter.

THE Basque separatist group Eta used an old photograph of King Juan
Carlos to back its claim he was within shooting range twice this month
in Majorca, Spanish media reported.
Yesterday an Eta communique claimed that its guerrillas had the king
in their gun-sights twice while he was on holiday on the island, but
''technical complications'' had intervened.
The communique was accompanied by a photograph of the king aboard the
yacht Rioja de Espana.
However several sources said the photo was taken last summer, not this
month as the guerrillas claimed.
Police arrested three Eta suspects on August 10. They had rented a
flat a few hundred yards from the jetty where the king moors another
yacht, and are thought to have been preparing an attack on the king or
other members of the royal family.--Reuter.

SCOTTISH Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace tells Robbie Dinwoodie,
Scottish Political Correspondent, why he feels upbeat about his party's
prospects. He feels these are enhanced because any Labour constitutional
doubts only serve to make his party the guarantor of home rule and could
see it become the second biggest party in Scotland at the next General
Election.
Q. There have been suggestions over the summer that Labour's
commitment to a strong Scottish Parliament is weakening. How do you view
this?
A. We have always negotiated in good faith with the Labour Party. But
there is uneasiness because Tony Blair has gone back on proportional
representation for the Welsh Assembly. He has ditched the commitment to
English regional parliaments, and even before any of the recent flurry
of rumours there were suggestions that he was uneasy about tax- raising
powers for a Scottish Parliament.
Another area for concern is that Tony Blair has said that sovereignty
would continue to reside at Westminster. Jack Straw has said something
similar. That is not what we perceive as the basis for a Scottish
Parliament.
That may well be illustrative of one of the differences between
ourselves and the Labour Party. We obviously want to see it entrenched
and we would want to see that any Bill setting up a Scottish Parliament
has within it provisions to make it very difficult to repeal.
Q. Must there be complete unanimity?
A. Some things can be left as areas on which we can agree to differ.
On important essentials of what the Scottish Parliament is and does, I
would much prefer to see unanimity -- for example, on the electoral
system, on the number of members, and on how we tackle the important
issue of gender balance.
But we will agree to differ with the Scottish Labour Party on the
issue of the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster. We accept that there
is a case for reducing the number. The role of the Secretary of State is
another one. I want to see a Scottish Parliament that's got sufficient
powers that there really would be little if anything left for a Scottish
Secretary to do in the Cabinet.
Q. Surely sovereignty is inviolable -- either you accept the
sovereignty of Westminster or you accept the sovereignty of the Scottish
people?
A. Those of us who signed the Claim of Right, which included Labour
MPs as well as Liberal Democrat MPs, accepted the sovereignty of the
Scottish people. I think the Labour Party have got themselves in some
difficulty over that.
I think that is why at the end of the day our position on federalism
is much more logical, which even Conservative Ministers have accepted.
Where the Labour Party and ourselves come together Labour have reached
their high-watermark, whereas for us there is something beyond that
which would be a proper federal settlement for the whole UK.
Safeguarding and entrenching the powers of local government is
important too and I don't think we have any difficulties with the Labour
Party over that. One of the red herrings which the Tories throw up is
that the Scottish Parliament is a threat to local government. It ill
becomes a party which has tampered with local government and centralised
more powers in the last 16 years than had been done in the previous
century to accuse us of wanting to do away with local government powers.
Q. What about critics of the slow progress of Scottish Constitutional
Convention?
A. I treat with a pinch of salt criticisms of the convention from
parties that deliberately have had nothing to do with it. That said, I
have expressed my impatience. It is fair to say that in the immediate
aftermath of the last General Election many of us in the convention and
other people in Scotland felt we had been punched in the stomach. We
were winded and it took a bit of time to get our breath back.
People say, you Liberal Democrats only want PR because it is to your
advantage, but if you look at both local government in Scotland and
Westminster government in Scotland we are not far off our proportion
under the first-past-the-post system. The biggest beneficiaries might
well be the Tories! But the important point for us is that it produces a
parliament that is properly representative of Scotland.
Alex Salmond is talking through his hat when he says the SNP are the
guarantors of constitutional change in Scotland. Far from being the
guarantors of constitutional change the SNP might be the heralds, of
constitutional upheaval. It is the Liberal Democrats in Scotland who can
best guarantee constitutional change because we have shown in the
convention what we want to see.
No-one looking at Scottish political history can be in any doubt about
the commitment of the SLD to the Scottish Parliament, to home rule, and
if there is any question or uncertainty about whether the Labour Party
under Tony Blair will deliver, then what better guarantee than to ensure
that there are a good number of Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs backed up
by a solid number of SLD votes in the next UK Parliament?
That, I think, gives us a role that we did not obviously have at the
last General Election. I know there are a number of our supporters who
felt that when it came to the home rule and devolution issue there was
an element of ''me too-ism'' between ourselves and the Labour Party who
were both members of the convention. I think we have got a role to play
here, saying we really need a strong Liberal Democrat force in the new
Parliament to make sure that these things we have negotiated are
actually delivered.
I cannot fathom Tony Blair's opposition to PR. As a politician who
talks about pluralism, the new buzz word within the Labour Party, and
makes speeches saying Labour should look beyond its own ranks for other
ideas, PR is one of the best guarantees of pluralism. The concern must
surely be that Tony Blair wants power for power's sake. That begins to
put question marks over what he is about.
We believe government in the late twentieth century has become far too
powerful, far too unchecked. That is a difference between ourselves and
a Labour Party that, in spite of some sweet words from time to time, by
their actions, particularly in local government, still give the clear
impression that they think there is nothing really that much wrong with
the way power is exercised in Britain, if only the right party was
exercising it.
We're not talking here about a difference in tactics [between Labour
and Liberal Democrats]. We are talking about a different perception
about the way in which Britain should be governed. It's not a simple
message but it might become simpler as some of these issues come up and
people see there is actually a difference. I believe we are more in tune
with what people perceive to be necessary.
There is a trap you can fall into by seeing home rule as an end in
itself. It's not. Home rule is the means to better government of
Scotland, to try to deliver better education, health service, transport
arrangments -- a whole series of issues.
Q. How will you respond to Michael Forsyth as Scottish Secretary and
his expected onslaught on your ''tartan tax''?
A. I will happily go into this debate on the attack and say how dare
Michael Forsyth or anyone else accuse us of wanting to put up taxes,
considering the extent to which the Tory Party have put up tax.
If you go back to the last election and even take the figure of three
pence, we have seen tax go up by more than twice that amount under this
Conservative Government that pledged to reduce tax -- airport taxes, new
types of taxes, taxes on insurance policies. It ill becomes the Tory
Party, the party of the poll tax, to start accusing others of inventing
taxes. I will take it as an opportunity to remind people of what tax has
been like under Mr Forsyth.
Secondly, I think there is a strong element of hypocrisy among the
Tories on this. If the Scottish Parliament we want was not proposing
tax-raising powers, we would get the Lord Home criticism trotted out
from 1979 that it would be irresponsible. That was one of their
complaints, that it didn't have tax-raising powers, that an important
element of accountability in a democracy would not be there. That is one
of the most important reasons why there should be taxation powers to
raise or reduce, because that is essentially what gives any political
body its accountability. Local government has the power to raise
taxation.
Let's look at some of the other arguments we've had on taxation which
have gone for a burton as far as our opponents in Government are
concerned. We've really had some wild figures like 22p on income tax.
That would only ever happen if equalisation was abandoned, if the
Government of the day abandoned the principle of needs assessment.
Michael Forsyth has said that would only be done over his dead body.
He has totally rejected the idea of financing Scotland on a per capita
basis and has argued a very persuasive case for Exchequer payments on
the basis of need. That is surely what the Union is about that the
Tories are pledged to defend. The Union does recognise differences
within it, Scotland's geography itself, sparsity of population, the fact
that we spend more on the health service because of our greater health
needs.
Q. The power to lower tax is meaningless. say critics, while Scotland
benefits from equalisation.
A. In the early stages it would be difficult. But what we want to see
is a Scottish Parliament that works with the grain as far as the economy
and business is concerned. We are not going to achieve all these things
overnight. I think there is a danger those of us who espouse the cause
of a Scottish Parliament must watch out for and that is that we don't
give the impression that with one bound everything will be coming up
roses.
That power has got to be there and it may not be possible to exercise
it for the very reason you give, that it would be difficult to operate
equalisation while reducing taxation, but I think one penny on the
income tax to be spent on education might find a resonance with the
Scottish people.
It will be very easy for those who want to disrupt the parliament if
everything the Scottish Parliament depended on was handed down. There
has to be that element of flexibility and accountability. You've got to
say to people, at the end of the day it is the candidate you vote for
that will determine whether that tax-increasing or tax-decreasing power
is used or not.
It enters into the whole UK scene at the moment. I think the Labour
Party are conceding the Tory game by this fear of uttering the word tax.
The Liberal Democrats are not a high tax party. We believe in efficiency
and getting value for money. But it is economic nonsense to say that you
will forever and a day go on cutting taxation.
There will be occasions when it will make economic sense for the good
of the economy to increase tax and I think also people are more readily
recognising that if you do want high quality public services they do
have to be paid for. We are the only party that seems to have the
courage to stand up and say that.
Q. What do you expect from Michael Forsyth?
A. I think he will be very high-profile, he will more combative than
Ian Lang in set pieces, I think he will surprise us on one or two issues
that are not necessarily key to central Government policy.
I would have to accept that as a constituency member when he was a
Minister at the Scottish Office, I never expected him to stand his
ideology on his head to resolve a constituency problem I had, but, that
apart, I found him willing to listen and to be helpful. There may well
be areas where he will be prepared to be practical and pragmatic.
Q. Can he lead a Tory recovery?
A. I don't believe at the end of the day he will affect it all that
much. I would be staggered if at the next election the Tories in
Scotland get 10% or 11%. I think they will go up a bit. They will do
nothing like recover to where they were at the last General Election.
They are in difficulty but I don't honestly believe that Michael Forsyth
will have time to make a real difference. The tide is going out for this
Government.
We have in our sights for the next election the entire junior Scottish
Office team because James Douglas Hamilton, Raymond Robertson and George
Kynoch all hold seats we would want to win and we would not be sparing
any efforts in our attempt to do that.
I am anxious to set our sights high.
I want to make sure we go into the next election on a much more upbeat
basis and the boundary changes give us that opportunity. Aberdeen South
and even Aberdeen North is not a wild hope either. We are going to have
to fight to defend our two seats where we have retiring MPs. We have a
good fight on our hands with the prospect of being able to advance. I am
also keen that as a party we make sure we have a good result in other
seats too because if we have Scottish Parliament elections to fight
shortly thereafter I want to make sure we are well placed. That means we
have got to raise our profile in West Central Scotland and we have some
grounds for encouragement.
Q. Isn't there a danger of being squeezed out of the middle ground by
Tony Blair's New Labour?
A. I don't think so because the Labour Party in Scotland has reigned
so supreme for so long that there really isn't much left to squeeze. We
will do in General Elections what we have done in local elections and
make sure most of our resources go towards those seats were we can get
good results.
An interesting point to consider is that there is every possibility
that we will be the second largest party in Scotland after the next
General Election. We could be the main opposition if there is a Labour
Government delivering a Scottish Parliament. So it is not just a
rhetorical claim to be the guarantors. I think it is something that is
real.
I don't like being tempted into figures but you don't have to be a
psephological whizz-kid to see us going up to 12 or 13 seats.
Q. Can the Scots Parliament provide a modernising model for
Westminster to follow?
A. It ought to be a beacon of good practice but I am highly sceptical
whether Westminster will pay any attention. Westminster has a great many
interesting historic practices, some of which are quaint and inoffensive
but others which inhibit good government. I remember after the fall of
the Berlin Wall Russell Johnston was denied his emergency debate because
it wasn't specific and urgent enough. That's Westminster, caught in a
time warp.
I hope the Scottish Parliament organises itself on different grounds.
I hope we will have signficant number of women members. We oppose any
statutory imposition of that but I would like to see the first
parliament established on this basis. I very much hope the Scottish
Parliament operates a proper freedom of information regime. The fact
that we have our system of private law gives us opportunities for a Bill
of Rights, for example. I hope it can work sensible hours, conducive to
encouraging people to stand for it. I hope it can work more like the US
Congress in taking evidence. I very much hope that the Scottish
Parliament will be imaginative and will not feel under any obligation
whatsoever to follow slavishly Scottish procedures. That could be the
death knell of it before it even got off the ground.
Q. What if the Scottish Parliament takes us down not your road of a
federal Britain but down the SNP road of independence in Europe
A. I don't believe it will lead to independence. At the end of the day
independence will come if the people of Scotland want it. Whilst we
regularly have reminded the Conservatives that at the last election 75%
of the people voted against the status quo, perhaps we haven't spent
enough time reminding the SNP that 80% of the people voted against their
policy of independence.
I am sufficiently a democrat that if people support independence I
will do my best to make it work but I don't believe for one minute that
is what people want. What they do want is more self-determination over
the issues that affect us. As the European dimension to our politics
grows people find the idea of reverting to a sovereign nation state
called Scotland with embassies and so on absurd.
The SNP has been allowed to get away for too long with the saying
independence is the simplest solution. There is nothing simple about it
at all. There is the whole question of the armed forces and the
configuration of our military, and whether it would be sufficient to
give Rosyth work. But if you were seriously addressing the question of
independence these are the issues you have to address. What is going to
happen to our currency? We don't have a single European currency so
would Scotland have its own? What is interest rate policy? Do we have
high interest rates to prevent a flight of capital? If so will the
people of Dumfries be happy paying higher mortgages than in Carlisle?
No company would allow its institutions to be the same as when Queen
Anne was on the Throne. If the UK is going to survive, it cannot allow
its institutions to remain locked in that way.

IT MUST tell us something about the nature of our society, currently
in the grip of such inconsequential nonsense as Gazzamania, that a Scot
with perhaps the most encyclopaedic knowledge I have ever encountered
died last week with hardly a mention in the daily avalanche of print.
By his own efforts, my old newspaper colleague, George Ritchie, had
not only acquired that massive awareness of the world and its letters
but could call it up for appropriate screeds of quotation a good deal
faster than the modern gods of technology.
Within the scope of that phenomenal brain, which could express itself
in half a dozen languages, he also happened to be perhaps the greatest
living authority on the language and literature of my native North-east
of Scotland.
He was steeped in classics like Johnny Gibb o' Gushetneuk (written by
a former editor of his Aberdeen paper, William Alexander) the prose of
Lewis Grassic Gibbon, and the verse of Charles Murray.
For it was there in the North-east that he grew up and became a
sub-editor with the Aberdeen Press and Journal before I was even born,
part of a breed of journalist now all but gone.
In the 1930s he worked with men like John Sleigh, a funereal figure
who had reported on the Tay bridge disaster of 1879. He sub-edited with
George Fraser, who was writing a column before the end of the First
World War and is still writing his column today, 77 years later. It was
my joy to catch the tail end of that extraordinary breed.
George preceded me to Glasgow and it was in 1960 that I finally caught
up with this gentle genius with whom I would rake over the life and
language of that Buchan landscape which bred us.
Conscious always that we say things on a funeral day which would have
been better said in the lifetime of the departed, I took the opportunity
in this column two years ago to express some of my thoughts and feelings
about George Ritchie.
I let him know that he was regarded as an intellectual giant of a man,
yet so quiet and self-effacing as to pass unnoticed unless you took the
trouble to explore the vastness of his mind.
I saw him as the archetypal Scottish lad-o'-pairts, so well read and
self-educated that he could have taken his place among great dons of
Oxbridge.
Gaunt and bearded, he could have been mistaken for a Russian poet or
even a prophet deep rooted in Old Testament day.
In fact, of course, his long ploughman's stride belonged exclusively
to the rolling farmlands of his native Aberdeenshire, from which his
heart never strayed.
If modesty had been a disease we would have lost him long ago. Indeed,
we very nearly did. When he was in his forties and a chronic asthmatic,
there were nights when we heard that George might not see the morning.
But the God he served so well was good to him. Cortisone had appeared
as the wonder drug which would see him through another 40 years or so.
Though not without a struggle, he lived on till last Monday when he
breathed his last at the Erskine Hospital for ex-Servicemen, where he
had only recently settled in with great contentment.
His nephew, the Rev John Christie of Hyndland, Glasgow, asked me to
deliver the eulogy at Clydebank Crematorium on Friday and it was a
privilege to do so for a man I admired so much.
I also felt the better of having written so much of it during George's
life. It surprised him at the time but he quietly expressed his
gratitude.
Among his many talents, George Ritchie was a considerable poet though,
by the very nature of the man, he managed to hide that particular light
till his retirement. He was expressing himself in our native North-east
language, the so-called Doric, with a power which has only recently been
finding its way into Scottish anthologies.
At the funeral I quoted a gem from his poem, Dry-Steen Dykes, in which
he says so much in so short a space about the efforts of our forefathers
in transforming that dour North-east landscape into the productive
farmland it became.
I give you a sample of George Ritchie, one of nature's finest, who
sought a life of anonymity but surely deserves this farewell tribute:
Gyang oot e furth, an fit is't at ye see?
The dambrod parks, an aye the dykes atween
The muckle dykes, aa made o onvrocht steen
The steens wir faithers widna jist lat be
But ruggit oot, an fan the grun was free
They made it into fairmlan, braw and bien.
Though lang and teuch the darg, freen helpit freen
'Deed, they were better men nor you an me.
Gin aa wir Western culture wore awa
An antiquaries fae a future race
Socht fit mith be remainin o wir warks
Technology, art, science, learnin, law
Wid aa be gane, but still the chiels mith trace
The dykes wir faithers biggit roon the parks.

WITH the remembrance of VJ Day we have come to the end of a series of
moving and often painful recollections of the end of the Second World
War. Although that event took place 50 years ago it has been heartening
to see the interest taken in the commemorative events by many young
people who have no direct link with the war closer than grandparents.
This is as it should be, for the young should not be ignorant of the
events of those far-off years. There are particular reasons for this,
and they do not lie in any need to preserve animosities at second or
third hand, or for the thinking of modern youngsters to be dominated by
the alliances and attitudes of the Second World War, or even the Cold
War into which it so easily and distressingly led. The dreadful events
of war should be remembered because they are a necessary reminder of the
depths to which mankind can sink in its treatment of fellow creatures.
It is too much to argue that knowledge of this sort will eliminate
repetition, for the events of recent years around the world have shown
us the futility of this sort of thinking. But a knowledge and
understanding of the horrors of war is necessary for a proper
appreciation of the human condition and hopefully as a caution which may
prevent at least some abuses in the future.
To draw this lesson from the last of the Second World War
commemorations is not as perverse as it might seem at first glance. Of
course the events remind those who were involved of the sacrifice of
their comrades. Yet it is the present and the future which concerns us
most, and it is inconceivable that the young men and women who died
would argue with this emphasis if they could be with us now. For this
reason, and in the context of the perhaps more predictable ceremonies
which took place up and down the country yesterday, it is the
contribution by Archbishop Keith O'Brien in Edinburgh yesterday which
had particular relevance and freshness.
Preaching at the VJ Day remembrance service in St Giles', the Roman
Catholic Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh spoke with feeling of
the cruelties inflicted on prisoners of war by the Japanese and the
bitter and disturbing memories which have persisted to this day; he made
much of the need for the Japanese to apologise. Leaving aside the
question of whether or not the Japanese have apologised properly, we
fear for those who place emotional emphasis on such an event. To say
''sorry'' and to mean it is an act of great intensity and value. But how
can one generation of Japanese apologise for another generation? Where,
indeed, is the value and release in this for those who have been so
personally and deeply wronged?
More controversially, Archbishop O'Brien is likely to have upset many
by his description of the destruction of Dresden, the fire bombing of
Tokyo, and the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki as examples of a
willingness to treat civilians as enemy soldiers. The easy reaction is
to wave fists and demand how dare he say these things. The harder, but
more fruitful, way is to pause and wonder whether Archbishop O'Brien was
attempting to draw a lesson for now and the future; in other words,
precisely what we have already suggested is an important value of
remembrance. The moral and practical correctness of these events will
always be contested, but the Archbishop was surely right in drawing a
line between then and now, and illustrating the way in which civilians
are still the victims, in the Balkans, in Rwanda, in Northern Ireland,
and in a host of other places which he did not mention. Certainly, we
must commemorate our dead, but their sacrifice is also a pointer to the
atrocities and abuses of the present time.

Madrid
ANIMAL rights groups in Spain hailed victory over a cruel village
fiesta.
For over 500 years birds have been strung up by their legs to a wire
between two posts at the village of Nalda, in northern Spain, while
horsemen at full gallop compete to rip off the cockerels' heads in front
of hundreds of fiesta makers.
This weekend the mayor was warned that if the cock-killing went ahead
he was breaking a new animal protection law and the village would be
fined up to #25,000. The mayor vowed the spectacle would take place but
at the last moment backed down and called off the cruelty that
traditionally marks the local saint's day.
Animal lovers are sending a letter to Vicki Moore, now recovering at a
Southport hospital from a horrific goring she suffered while trying to
collate evidence of cruelty at another Spanish summer fiesta. She has
been one of the main campaigners against the slaughter of the cockerels
in the village.

THE news that the Iraqis were a mere three months from achieving a
nuclear device by 1991 is, if true, highly disconcerting. The caveat is
important: the source, Saddam Hussein's defecting brother-in-law, will
have every reason to try to boost his standing with those on whose
protection he has thrown himself, ultimately the United States. Every
effort will now be being made to see how his claim stands up. Should it
be confirmed, it suggests that the successful campaign to liberate
Kuwait was far riskier than it seemed at the time. Indeed would Desert
Storm ever have been mounted if the possibility of a nuclear dimension
had been known to exist? Yet had that possibility been there, why would
Saddam have anticipated his unusual power by invading his target a year
or so too soon? Perhaps it is only in retrospect that the likely
timetable appeared beyond dispute.
This is an issue which will be cleared up once the technical data at
the command of the defector has been analysed. But there is nothing
inherently improbable about a relatively minor power, with no large
technological base of its own, being able to produce the most simple
(but still enormously lethal) atomic devices. Much of the basic physics
is well known, and easily accessible. It may be another matter to be
able to manufacture the actual nuclear material but it can be bought or
stolen -- often in small amounts which can be hard to trace. Easier
still, vital atomic material can be accumulated for warlike purposes
from entirely peaceful activities, like nuclear power generation. It is
true that indispensable components for sophisticated devices are harder
to come by when they cannot be manufactured in a low-tech economy like
Iraq, but many essential components for atomic weaponry have dual
natures, being adaptable for war, though designed for peace. The skill
with which the Iraqis managed a weapons import programme aimed at
providing themselves with the nucleus of an atomic armoury has already
been exposed in this country, even before the formal report from the
Scott Inquiry identifies some of their detailed operations (and
allocates responsibility for our failures in frustrating their efforts).
Although all of this concern is now history, and may not repeat itself
in the case of Iraq, there remain other relatively small, and not
obviously stable, countries which find the allure of an independent
atomic capacity irresistible. North Korea is a case in point, as is
Pakistan. In a somewhat different league, South Africa is supposed to
have developed a nuclear capacity and so has Israel. The key element is
neither the knowledge nor the components, but the money to buy them.
Iraq had that money on an enormous scale thanks to its oil (and South
Africa because of its mineral wealth), but even poorer states can
acquire it through diverting part of heavy taxation to secret funds
which can be disbursed without scrutiny (as were, incidentally, the
British funds for the construction of our own independent atomic
weaponry after 1945).
The real worry is obvious: it concerns the further profileration of
states with the ability to possess such capacities. Saddam Hussein's
Iraq is a warning. It is hard to see, in spite of the UN's
Non-Proliferation Treaty, what can be done to prevent such developments.
Had Saddam not rushed to war when he did, he might have been a far more
serious threat than he actually proved. And even had his activities been
fully known, it would have been hard to counter them given the concept
of national sovereignty. And that is why the sense of disturbance will
not go away even if Baghdad is comprehensively disarmed.

JUST two Saturdays after six murders made Glasgow national news, I
wonder at the Chief Constable's sense of priority. At 3.30pm three
police officers were busy removing parked cars from the dual carriageway
in Shieldhall Road.
The irony was that, while the cars were causing no obstruction (they
weren't even parked on a yellow line), the police operation was delaying
traffic by three cycles of the nearby traffic-lights.
If the police are not prepared to switch at least some of their
resources from the safe and financially-rewarding harassment of
law-abiding car owners to the more socially-essential task of catching
criminals, then perhaps Michael Forsyth should intervene with a
directive.
Meanwhile, I now know how to answer the English journalist coming to
my office to investigate the deterioration in Glasgow's image. I will
divert him from examining the 13% rise in violent crime by claiming that
Glasgow has the neatest parking in Britain.

YOUR recent article on the prospective action against the M74
extension illustrates the knee-jerk political reaction of these groups
to proposals, without considering the effects of their action on others.
Strathclyde Regional Council and the Scottish Office have put forward
this proposal as the most effective means of curing many of the
transport-related ills present in the South Side of Glasgow.
They have carried out years of intensive engineering and environmental
study, specifically on the current problems for the people living and
working in the area, and the West of Scotland economy. Their proposals
are shown to produce economic benefit of eight times the cost of the
scheme.
Even the inexpert eye can see that the environmental benefits to those
living and working in places which will be bypassed such as Rutherglen,
Cambuslang, and the new community of the Gorbals, will greatly outweigh
the disbenefits caused by the scheme.
Those who are to be affected are to be fully compensated, which cannot
be said of the people suffering from the existing heavily used roads.
If people do not know of the scheme, it can only be because of their
lack of interest in their community. To my knowledge, there have been
many newspaper articles and statutory advertisements, public exhibitions
in local halls and libraries, and many seminars for the business
community. All people directly affected will have received formal
notices regarding both the planning application and the proposed
compulsory purchase order.
The group states that their action is also on behalf of the businesses
affected, the success of which businesses creates and keeps the
communities which they also proclaim that they are defending.
I am representing a significant number of these businesses in their
compensation negotiations with the regional council, and know that the
greatest detrimental effect is the uncertainty on whether the scheme is
to proceed or not, rather than the fact that their property is to be
acquired. The businesses are unable to plan in the long term, until they
know when the acquisition is to occur, and how much they are to receive
for their properties.
By contesting the scheme, and proudly stating that they will be active
for seven years, it is the (in)action group, not the authorities, who
will be to blame for the costs incurred by the businesses. Will the
group compensate the community for the lost investments and jobs which
will result?
I have already been able to assist one small company under the
planning blight provisions, so that they have obtained their property
compensation, relocated within the South Side, and been able to minimise
the detrimental effects on their business. That is positive action.
The action groups should be seen for their underlying anarchic
political motives, which are certainly not to the advantage of the
community as a whole.

IT is with considerable anger that I have read the criticisms levelled
at the leader of the Labour Party, Tony Blair, by politicians of the
left in Glasgow, activists in Glasgow, and also Roy Hattersley, a former
deputy leader of the Labour Party. Many of them are those who opposed
one member one vote, who opposed the changes in Clause 4, who opposed
Tony Blair for leader and lost the argument; but they will never learn,
they know better than everyone else.
They speak of democracy, but refuse to accept the consequences of
democratic votes within the Labour Party, which led to Tony Blair being
elected leader.
What those members of the Labour Party have done is give the Tories
ammunition, which they never had before, and allowed them to attack the
Labour Party as being a party in disarray, when nothing could be further
from the truth.
This small group of activists in Glasgow by their conduct reveal that
they think more of their act of self-indulgence than they do of the many
ordinary men and women who have suffered grievously under the burden of
a Tory Government.
The Labour Party, under Tony Blair, is poised to achieve political
power for the first time in 16 years. Surely those in the Labour Party
who indulge in this disgraceful conduct care more for their own ego than
they do for the future of ordinary men and women in this country.
I would ask these activists to confine their criticisms of the Labour
Party within the Labour Party. I feel I speak for the vast majority of
Labour Party members, when I say quite frankly that they should stop
indulging in public criticism of the leadership at this critical time.
They will not be forgiven by those of us who have spent a lifetime in
the Labour and trade-union movement trying to advance the conditions of
the people of this country.

YOUR leader, Rail vision and reality, exposes the sad futility of
Railtrack seeking revenge on its public-spirited mole, instead of
fighting its corner with this Government as the real culprit for
declining safety margins, maintenance standards, and rail investment
levels now at their lowest since 1948 (August 16).
Professional disquiet at the inexorable run-down of the national
railway, now in progress, was evidently of far more concern to this mole
than propaganda that an atomised and investment-starved railway can
somehow deliver a ''better'' service to the public.
Wasn't it similar refusal to paper over Government deceit and the
bleak future for our railways which, earlier this year, finally drove
out ScotRail director, Chris Green -- a man of supreme dynamic and
dedication to achieving a public sector rail system of which we could be
justly proud?
Few conservatives at grass-roots level have any real respect for or
stomach to defend their Government's dogma-driven castration of our
national rail system now in progress. Even Ministers themselves must see
the electorate openly sniggering over the fiction that private sector
interest will somehow rescue our railways after what the Government has
declared them an unwanted part of our national requirement.
Whilst private sector involvement and finance could have an extended
partnership role working along with BR it is simply not prepared to fill
the huge investment vacuum created by this Government's anti-rail
mentality.
Even where a few honey-pot schemes do emerge, the private sector is
likely, as with English and Welsh water privatisation, to finance these
through steeply increased user charges/fares, rather than share issue as
the Government cynically imply.
Much of the current Scottish rail network will simply be left to rot
into uncompetitive absurdity.

AS a frequent flier doing about 100,000 miles a year long-haul and
always in business or first class I must take issue with Katie Wood's
article (Weekender, August 19).
Her statement that British Airways is hard to beat is simply not true
with regard to its business-class product. Although British Airways may
have a very consistent quality and covers most destinations from Britain
its business class is lagging behind many other airlines.
Most business travellers rate space as one of the most important
factors in choosing between airlines, times and connections being
suitable. Judged by this British Airways does very poorly at a mere 40
inches between seats.
Virgin has 60-inch pitch on many of its flights and in every other way
is a vastly superior product. Continental has 55-inch pitch, Qantas and
Air Canada 50, KLM and North West 47, to mention but a few.
I should also remind Katie Wood that North West no longer flies out of
Glasgow.
It is important to note that with most other airlines you can, with a
big of shopping around, easily get 50% off a business class fare, but
not with British Airways. Whatever consolidators they use is a well-kept
secret.
Most other airlines give very generous mileage allowance for their
frequent fliers but for British Airways they will only give miles on
their non-discounted fares, unless you happen to live in the United
States.

COLIN WILLIAMS asks the question ''Who cares about the carers?''
(August 16) and writes about the network of Princess Royal Trust for
Carers Centres in Scotland. I would like to ask another question, ''Who
campaigns for the carers?''
Since 1990 Carers National Association has been working in Scotland
for a fair deal for carers. With sister organisations like Crossroads
and Shared Care Scotland and carer-led organisations like Strathclyde
Carers Forum, and through our own branch network from Caithness in the
north to Tweeddale in the south, we have been campaigning at a national
and local level for the right policies.
Most notably this year carers from across Scotland led a campaign of
support for the Carers Recognition and Services Bill, lobbying at the
House of Commons and organising meetings in different parts of Scotland,
bringing Malcolm Wicks, MP, the Bill's sponsor, to Edinburgh for a
national public meeting in March: The Carers Recognition and Services
Act, 1995, will come into effect in April 1996, in no small part because
of the campaigning efforts of Scotland's carers and their representative
organisations.
Even with all our best efforts, however, the picture for carers in
Scotland is far from satisfactory. According to recent research
published by Carers National Association, four out of five carers think
that the policy of Care in the Community has made no difference to them.
Carers are finding access to residential and nursing-home care more
difficult; means testing is discouraging carers from taking up vital
services; and as individuals, carers are very poor in terms of regular
income and their level of personal savings.
The network of carers centres, which the Princess Royal Trust helps to
fund, are an integral part of that broader carers movement in Scotland
driven by carers themselves, which will give families like the Wilsons
and the Allans, highlighted in Elizabeth Buie's article on the same
page, the best chance of getting a fair deal.

YOUR readers with bank accounts will no doubt be interested to hear
that the bank currently celebrating its 300th year of banking service in
Scotland is still banking on huge increases to customers for its
services.
No less a figure than Sir Bruce Pattullo, the governor of the Bank of
Scotland, has confirmed to me, in answer to my complaint about a 100%
increase in charges, that he indeed fully supports his local Kilmarnock
branch management with this increase.
But does he know that once-loyal customers can also vote with their
feet at a 100% increase in bank charges?

WITH reference to recent correspondence concerning Arduaine Garden,
the National Trust for Scotland refutes the more extravagant statements
made in the letter (August 12).
It is not only untrue but also irresponsible to describe the garden as
being ''in a perilous state'' and to say that the condition of the
garden is deteriorating. On the contrary, there is a view that the
garden has never looked better.
A planned programme of work, approved by the Arduaine Garden Local
Advisory Committee, including the Wright brothers, has been drawn up for
the garden and is being implemented.
The condition of the garden and the way it is being managed has the
approval of the NTS's Scottish Gardens Committee and of the Arduaine
Garden Local Advisory Committee except for the Wrights.
The advice which the NTS would offer its members and the public is to
visit the lovely garden and judge for themselves.

I DON'T know Tom Nairn and so far as I know I have never met him. I
don't agree with his nationalism but over the years I have read a great
deal of his work. It deserves criticism, it is true, but neither Tom
Nairn himself nor his writing deserves the flatulent, sneering treatment
given by Michael Fry (August 16).
I do know David Cohn-Bendit and again I don't often find myself in
total agreement with him. However, he is fluent, passionate in his
beliefs and a fine speaker in the old-fashioned rhetorical style. Above
all, I have found him to be free of malice and courteous.
What Tom Nairn and David Cohn-Bendit have in common (aside from my
opposition!) is that in the 1960s they protested about failures of
democracy, about the Vietnam war, and about tendencies to
authoritarianism.
What's wrong with that? Surely it is more laudable than a lifetime
protesting about nothing more than the temperature of a good claret!
The real question is whether Michael Fry has failed to recognise the
real parasite because it may be too close for comfort.

Srinagar
THE governor of India's state of Jammu and Kashmir today ruled out use
of force to free four Western hostages held by Muslim militants, saying
diplomacy was the best hope for their release.
''The government has no plan to launch a military operation to secure
the release of the four abducted tourists,'' said Governor K V Krishna
Rao.
''Use of diplomatic channels is the best option under the
circumstances to secure the release of the hostages without harm,'' he
said, hours after a separatist militant group opposed to the abductions
announced plans to arrest the kidnappers.
Diplomats working for the release of Britons Paul Wells and Keith
Mangan, an American, and a German by the militant Al-Faran group said it
could take a month to obtain the release of the hostages, already held
for 49 days, by peaceful means.
Al-Faran beheaded a fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, a
week ago after the Indian Government refused to meet to its demand to
free 15 jailed separatist guerrillas.
Rao issued his statement after several reports said the government was
consulting Western experts who had arrived in Kashmir on ways to free
the hostages, including a military option.
Al-Faran responded by threatening to kill the captives if a raid was
launched on its mountain hideout.
Leaders of the group Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon, often regarded with
suspicion by some Kashmiri separatists for its alleged links to the
Indian Government, told a news conference they planned to disarm and
arrest the Al-Faran militants.
''We have sent a group of 25 commandos to track these people in
Ashmuqam,'' said Ansar ul Haq, the group's deputy commander, in
Srinagar.
Ashmuqam is a small mountain village 40 miles from Kashmir's summer
capital Srinagar, where a peasant woman found Ostroe's beheaded body a
week ago.
Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon, which opposes total independence for Kashmir but
wants a plebiscite to decided its fate, has denied that it is backed by
the Indian Government.
Haq estimated Al-Faran had 20 guerrillas. ''We intend to first disarm
them and then arrest them,'' he said.
Indian newspapers said today that Al-Faran changed its hideouts
frequently, on one occasion four times in a day, after warnings that
Indian commandos were planning a raid to rescue the hostages.
The Indian Government has asked the guerrillas to provide proof that
the captives are well.
A group of Western specialists experienced in dealing with kidnappings
met Rao yesterday.
Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao told Indian radio that New Delhi
would make ''all possible efforts . . . to secure the safe release of
the hostages''.--Reuter.

Baghdad
IRAQ has handed over important data on its weapons programmes after
what appears to be ''a new turn'' in relations with UN disarmament
officials but more information is needed, according to a United Nations
envoy.
''Iraq has given very important, significant new information with
regard mostly to its biological weapons programmes and also some
important information on its missile programme,'' said Rolf Ekeus, head
of the UN Special Commission in charge of disarming Iraq under the 1991
Gulf War ceasefire.
Ekeus came to Baghdad on Thursday to collect arms data that Iraq
claimed a high-level defector son-in-law of President Saddam Hussein had
concealed from UN inspectors.
Ekeus said it seemed the Iraqi Government had now taken ''a new turn,
appeared to open up, give new disclosures . . . At last we have come to
a situation where Iraq voluntarily and actively provides the commission
with information.''
He said Iraq had addressed most of the outstanding issues in the
biological sphere, but stressed more information was required as he
still did not regard the programme as closed.
''Indeed, while we are now talking, our specialists are still
receiving information. This takes a long time because it is such a large
amount of data,'' he told reporters before leaving for Bahrain.
He said Iraq also gave ''important clarifying information'' on its
nuclear programme which experts from the International Atomic Energy
Agency would analyse.
Iraq's military mastermind Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan,
and his brother Colonel Saddam Kamel Hassan, Saddam's chief bodyguard,
defected to Jordan on August 8 with their wives -- both daughters of
Saddam.
Ekeus said he discussed the developments with Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz and Lieutenant-General Amir Muhammad Rasheed, head
of the Military Industrialisation Commission and oil minister.
Ekeus is expected to meet Hussein Kamel in Jordan tomorrow.
He said his commission was satisfied that it had accounted for Iraq's
prohibited missiles with a range beyond 90 miles but still had some
questions about production activities.
Ekeus said the latest information was related to missile production
but his experts had not had time to analyse it.
Asked if the new atmosphere could lead to lifting the UN ban on oil
exports imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, he said: ''How the
political development will be played, it is very difficult to say. I do
not know how that will play at the Security Council.''
Ekeus said he would inform the UN Security Council of the latest
revelations and submit his six-monthly report in October.
Earlier, Iraq denied any unusual movement of its troops and said it
was ready to fight if attacked by US forces assembling in the Gulf
region.
''Iraq is prepared for any possibility and would fight on all fronts
with extraordinary power,'' said an editorial in the official
English-language daily Baghdad Observer.
It said there was no truth to US claims that Iraq was moving troops to
attack its neighbours Jordan and Kuwait.
The United States has sent aircraft carriers to the region within
striking distance of Iraq and advanced the date of regular joint
exercises with Kuwait to discourage what it describes as menacing
movements by Iraqi armed forces.
About 4000 US marines and sailors are taking part in manoeuvres with
the Jordanian army.
Washington has pledged to defend Jordan if it is attacked by Iraq for
providing refuge to the defectors.

Ian McConnell browses through a new directory which reveals the
changing face of Glasgow
GIVEN the near-demise of shipbuilding and heavy engineering, Glasgow
City Council's recently published Directory of Glasgow Companies
provides reassuring evidence that the economic heart of the metropolis
continues to beat, albeit more slowly.
The face of commerce has changed almost beyond recognition in the
post-war period but extensive research by the council's business unit
has produced a list of about 5300 companies within the city limits.
Ray Alexander, the man behind what is almost certainly the most
comprehensive city business directory, suspects there may be about 1000
more.
It is virtually impossible to find comparative statistics for the
period which followed the Second World War, but Tom Hart, a lecturer in
economic and social history at the University of Glasgow, is in no doubt
that there are fewer independent businesses in and around Glasgow today.
However, given what the city has lost and the need for acquisitions
and mergers to create bigger companies able to cope with new markets
around the globe, this is no great surprise. The pendulum has also swung
heavily from the manufacturing to the service sector, with a major
expansion of financial services and the evolution of computers.
In 1958, upper Clyde shipbuilders Connell, Yarrow, Stephen, John Brown
and Fairfield could still be considered to be in their heydays, with
full order books.
However, as that batch of boats came off the stocks, they weren't
replaced. From the early sixties, shipbuilding was firmly in decline
although Yarrow survives under the ownership of defence electronics
giant GEC and Fairfield continues under Norwegian owner Kvaerner. John
Brown, owned by conglomerate Trafalgar House, is now focused on more
general engineering.
In the period immediately after the war, Glasgow remained a major
centre for the building and repair of railway locomotives.
After nationalisation locomotive-building was concentrated on a few
sites -- none of them in Scotland.
The demise of shipbuilding and locomotive work took its toll on a host
of smaller companies, dependent on those industries for their
livelihood.
Although the total amount of economic activity has increased, there is
little denying Mr Hart's contention that ''Glasgow is not the city it
once was in terms of international comparisons''.
Glasgow City Council's directory is testimony to the huge changes
which Glasgow, as a business centre, has had to cope with.
There are more than 1500 businesses within the financial and
professional services section. Only 889 engineering firms are listed,
with only 73 of these involved in mechanical and heavy engineering.
Shipbuilding and heavy engineering have been replaced, to an extent,
by financial services, electronics and light industry, and activities
such as food processing.
There has been growth in the software and media sectors, which between
them account for 417 businesses in the directory. The leisure industry
has also blossomed.
Glasgow, which could certainly not have been considered a holiday
centre 40 years ago, is now a major tourist destination, with top hotels
continuing to spring up around the city and restaurants also cashing in.
The days of the independent department store have gone, with
nationwide names now firmly in place. Marks &amp; Spencer's Argyle Street
store is among the retailing giant's five largest outlets in the UK.
The banking sector has undergone radical changes during the post-war
period. Among them was the takeover of the Glasgow-based Union Bank of
Scotland by Edinburgh-based Bank of Scotland in 1955.
Distribution links have also changed beyond recognition since the war.
Mr Hart is convinced that Glasgow Airport will have a higher turnover by
value than the port of Glasgow did.
The rail network has shrunk, with the closure of St Enoch and Buchanan
Street as major overland stations, and the advent of road haulage.
Before it moved from its former site at Renfrew in the mid-sixties,
Glasgow's airport would have been lucky to handle 500,000 passengers a
year. The current airport probably handles nearly ten times as many.
Meanwhile, Glasgow City Council and the Glasgow Development Agency
continue to work with the private sector, including the city's
2100-strong Chamber of Commerce, to identify the skills and training
required for the newer industries.
Joe McLaughlin, the chamber's deputy chief executive, said: ''Probably
the one huge advantage that Glasgow has is that the private and public
sectors are working together to solve the problems.''
Alan Cameron, Bank of Scotland's archivist, said: ''I think there was
a general perception in the 1970s that Glasgow was on its uppers. In
that sense, the Glasgow's Miles Better campaign was good. I think
there's now a kind of buzz about the place.''

Rabat
MORE than 230 people are dead and 500 missing near Marrakesh after
Morocco's worst flash floods in half a century.
Whole families, many on holiday, were reported wiped out in the worst
flooding in the region for 50 years.
The Interior Ministry said rescuers had plucked the bodies from five
of the worst-hit regions of Al-Haouz province south of the city of
Marrakesh, 200 miles from Rabat.
Many victims were holidaymakers trapped in cars swept by rivers of mud
that poured down the forested Atlas Mountains, sending rocks hurtling on
to campsites and villages in the valleys after a freak thunderstorm.
Television showed bodies of men, women, and children caked in mud
being carried off in ambulances after the Gigaya, Ourika, and Gamat
rivers overflowed, blocking roads with mudslides and giant boulders and
stranding many travellers.
The government newspaper Le Matin said 30,000 holidaymakers, many of
them campers and backpackers, were in the area when the downpour began
on Thursday night.
About 80 foreign tourists, mainly French and British, made their way
safely back to the capital Rabat, the government said.
The mainly rural area is a popular holiday resort for Moroccans
escaping the intense heat of the cities, where temperatures have reached
record highs in recent weeks.
Some newspapers said hundreds more people were missing in remote
mountain areas, but the Interior Ministry spokesman implied that
rescuers did not expect to find more bodies after scouring the region
for three days with help from the military.
Residents contacted by telephone from Rabat said they had seen arms
floating in the sludge that rolled down from the mountains.
The mudslides sent cars smashing into each other and television showed
cars stacked up like toys.
The Ministry statement said more than 100 homes and shops were
destroyed. The Al-Alam newspaper reported that 166 bodies were recovered
in Ourika alone, about 21 miles from Marrakesh.
King Hassan ordered emergency supplies to be sent to the region.
Interior Minister Driss Basri visited on Friday to oversee the rescue
and ordered a commission set up to help the rural area.
Thirteen people were killed in flash floods earlier this year in
another part of Morocco, which at the same time is suffering from what
officials call ''the drought of the century''.
King Hassan appealed in May for contributions to a fund to help rural
communities overcome effects of the drought, which has led to one of the
worst cereals harvests on record.
The fund has already collected some #40m, less than one-third of the
amount the king hopes to raise from the nation.--Reuter/AP.

<TEXT>
ROAD rage and fear of attack are turning women into prisoners in their
own cars, according to a survey.
Women motorists are scared of driving alone at night, lock all car
doors whenever they travel, and are frightened of parking in
multi-storey car parks, said the survey, produced by the insurance
company Norwich Union.
The survey showed:
* Seven out of 10 women lock all their car's doors.
* 50% of women are frightened to drive alone at night.
* One woman in six feels threatened driving in cities.
* Two out of three women are frightened of parking in multi-storey car
parks.
* One in five women has reported that her car had been broken into
while it was in a car park.
* One in four women supported the idea of women-only car parking
areas.
''An increase in road rage incidents and highly-publicised attacks on
women in car parks are creating fear for female drivers,'' said Norwich
Union spokesman Derek Plummer.
He added: ''Most women value the independence and freedom a car gives
them but our research shows they feel intimidated and threatened while
driving -- especially when parking.''
The RAC backed the survey's findings and said it supported the Norwich
Union's Safe Car Park award scheme.
A spokeswoman said the RAC had been campaigning since 1988 for
improved car parks, with better design standards in new ones and
improved security in existing ones.
A spokeswoman said: ''The RAC believes that, if car park owners who

for theft and assaults in car parks, provided motorists had taken proper
precautions, then security would be improved faster.''
* The survey was based on answers from 1158 women in Britain during
the last two weeks of July.

Based on a successful Canadian model, Peterhead Prison's STOP
programme tackles the behaviour of prisoners convicted for sexual
offences against children or adults. Priority is given to men assessed
as being at high risk of reoffending. The programme, which adopts a
group-work approach involving up to 10 men, aims to engender personal
responsibility, address the consequences of offending for the men and
their victims, and develop strategies to assist the offenders to
exercise self-control in future.
The programme costs the public no extra cash; the staff are prison
officers and social workers, trained for this task, who would simply be
guarding the prisoners if the programmes did not exist.
Sixteen of the men who went through the first programme almost four
years ago have been released having served their sentences, and of these
one has been detected reoffending and returned to jail. Community
back-up is being set in place by social work agencies throughout
Scotland to assist men released after undertaking the voluntary
programme.
After some initial scepticism it has become apparent that the savings
in both monetary terms and in preventing trauma to victims could be very
considerable.
IN THE wake of a recent murder in the West of Scotland in which a
young woman was killed by a man who had previously raped, the murderer's
Member of Parliament rather intemperately attacked the Scottish prison
authorities for allegedly refusing his constituent help while in jail.
The MP made his criticism in a tabloid Sunday newspaper. Subsequent
investigation shows his knowledge of the true situation was incomplete;
the parents of his constituent, the murderer, had got it wrong, and the
prison in question, Peterhead, was unfairly cast in a poor light.
Had the MP gone to Peterhead and spoken to that particular killer's
fellow prisoners he would have emerged with a different picture. That is
the crux of the matter -- the huge and growing gap in public perception
created by inaccurate and populist reporting as opposed to the reality
of what is taking place inside Peterhead.
It is patently too early to say that the sex offenders inside the
granite fortress are reforming en masse, becoming paragons of virtue who
will eventually emerge into society's sunlight as reborn, reformed and
rehabilitated citizens. But change is undoubtedly taking place. Rapists,
sexual molesters of young children, sodomising scoutmasters and men who
have committed incest are, it seems, just as cabable of reform as any
other criminal.
The rapist who was released to murder and then complained he was
refused help was not telling the whole truth. The men who were with him
on the STOP programme say he was simply a ''kid-on bandit'', someone who
was not sincere in his desire to change but who thought he was smart
enough to beat the system, work his ticket, con the Parole Board.
But when it came down to the harsh realities of the group, his lack of
commitment was exposed and he flunked. He could not stand the pace set
by the other prisoners and he dropped out. It was no-one's fault except
his.
The effects of the MP's misguided protest for the prisoners in
Peterhead who have signed up for STOP -- the flagship sex-offender
intervention programmes now in their third year -- is yet another unfair
knock to be sustained and absorbed. They are used by now to being
labelled ''beasts'' by the tabloids; some of the mentally tougher types
in Peterhead's C Hall, a comparatively protected environment, could even
survive in the mainstream with the label round their necks because they
are capable of meeting violence with violence.
But, like water dripping on a stone, the constant adverse publicity
wears down morale. A group of the Peterhead C Hall men addressed this
problem, and asked this newspaper to put forward their point of view.
It is every bit as difficult to speak to the men as it is for them to
be open about their offending. Many hours on, with everyone feeling
strained and exhausted, we get down to the details of how men have
battered women into submission before raping them, have raped their own
children or sexually assaulted the children of others.
The group room becomes an open confessional, nine assorted prisoners
opening out to a journalist without any authority figure being present.
It is purely voluntary. Peterhead Prison's governor, Alec Spencer, had
said ''Go and see for yourself'' and the supervising prison officer for
the programmes, Alan Boath, had left the group room, saying: ''There's
no point in my being here.''
One grey-haired man, Carl, is the obvious leader, and right away he
castigates a group of prisoners who set up photographs supposedly
showing drug-taking inside the jail for the benefit of one tabloid.
The subsequent publicity was very damaging to the jail, overshadowing
the image of the good work going on with men who were making a serious
and taxing effort.
One man has come back for reoffending -- the one bad apple out of the
16 prisoners who went throught the first STOP programme and who have
since been released.
That man, another prisoner remarks, said he would probably be back and
he was right. The commitment to change was not really there.
Carl goes on: ''When any prisoner comes in here he goes to the
induction centre and his behaviour is assessed by a social worker and
the sentence planning officer. He is told about STOP and he can
volunteer. But the key is you have to be ready to ask for help.''
Another prisoner, John, says: ''There are guys come in here and sit
over in the other halls and they think they have done nothing wrong.
They are deluding themselves. They do not want to come across because
they do not want to find out about themselves.
''There are other guys who don't realise they have got a problem. They
think the way they live their lives is quite normal.
''The bottom line is that we have all done horrendous crimes, and of
all crimes society likes ours least. We are easy targets for all the bad
publicity that the tabloids can throw at us.''
Carl adds: ''A lot of men are frightened to come in here because of
the nature of their crimes. They are afraid to talk about them in front
of others. We have become the culture carriers. We can talk to them and
show them what STOP means. That is going on all the time and a few more
come across each time. Others are waiting now.
''Inside the group everything is secret. You avoid giving exact
specifics about other crimes because, by agreement, if you told a social
worker or an officer about an undetected crime he would be obliged to
report it. We talk about patterns, the thoughts which become feelings
which become actions.''
Another prisoner, clad in working dungarees, says: ''If the papers
paused for a moment they would realise how stupid it is to knock these
programmes and people who are trying to change. It costs the taxpayer
#26,000 to keep each prisoner in here for a year. If the programme can
stop one guy coming back that is a huge saving. One offender can have
dozens of victims, so the saving in pain and trauma to women and
children is enormous.''
Yet another man, plainly uncomfortable, adds: ''A lot of offenders do
not see their victims as human beings but as objects. After STOP you see
the victim as a fellow human. The group forces you to see that.''
As the men talk it becomes apparent that the group is their focus --
and what they most dread.
John: ''When everything I had done came out in one group I just
cracked up . . . a big hard man greetin' like a bairn. I was not feeling
sorry for myself. I was shocked. The groups are hard. I started to feel
some of the victim's pain for the first time and I would not want to
inflict that pain on anyone else.''
Several of the men inside the group room speak of a video film in
which a frail, elderly woman speaks of being raped 35 years before and
never recovering. There is a feeling of unease when it is mentioned.
That message has struck home.
As things open up a hard-looking individual with a pony tail says: ''I
did not really give a shit about people. I conned everyone -- my mother,
my girlfriend, my sister -- and ended up offending against my own child.
I learned what victim empathy is in here, this room. It hit me over the
head.''
A burly man with a red vest added: ''I come from a culture, the
gipsies, where women are held in low esteem by men. But I know that STOP
has changed me. My brothers and cousins see the change when they visit
me and they can't help mentioning it.''
Another man, who first served nine years for rape and is now doing
life, says: ''No-one was ever interested in saying to me that I had a
problem. I thought drink was my problem and drink alone. Now I am a
lifer. I was the problem . . . the way I thought. Drink was just my
excuse. Coming here frightened me. After Saughton it was just hell. Down
there I was locked up most of the time so there was no outside pressure.
The truth was I did not want to see the monster inside me, so that
suited me. Coming here has caused me a lot of pain.''
The pony-tailed man points out that it is easier to deal with survival
in mainstream jails, because a punch is just a punch. Psychological
scars are deeper and there is no room for pride or arrogance in the
group.
There is a ripple of humour in the group as the quietest man speaks
up; the previous day, in the group proper, had been his breakthrough, he
said, the first time he had been able to open up in front of the others
about his offence. Everyone laughs, not at him, but with him.
The red-shirted man explains: ''Everyone builds brick walls but in the
group they take away the bricks one by one until there is a gaping hole
and you can never close it again. Any guy can go into prison and lie
behind his door and do his time. He will come out just the same.''
There are, the men keep saying, no special privileges: no bribes, no
baits, no pats on the head. On the programmes there is no place to dodge
or hide.
The reward is simply the idea of stopping inflicting pain and misery
on victims, their families, the families of their friends, the families
and friends of the offenders themselves.
It is tempting to ask if the Peterhead sex offenders who have been
through the groups are sincere. Are they not just, by their nature,
clever men who have learned to parrot the jargon, mouth the correct
phrases on cue? To a man, they dismiss the idea.
They themselves have got rid of false hierarchies; inside the groups,
locked in the confessional room, there is no place to hide.
Back to Carl: ''You can play games with psychologists or social
workers but when you sit in here with 10 guys month after month you
cannot con them all. There is no escape from the pain and enormity of
what you have done. Men are changing in here. OK, we abide by the rules
and we are considerate, but we also accept our guilt. STOP is the best
thing that ever happened in this place.''
The supervisor, Alan Boath, reinforces this feeling -- that 80
sessions of two hours over a year are too long to hide anything.
And, of all people, the Scottish Parole Board members are no soft
touches.
It is clear that there will always be doubts over some prisoners who
have been through STOP. It is about straightening out people's thinking
and changing their behaviour, which is, to say the least, ambitious in
the extreme.
Meantime, the detractors might do well to ponder on the cost of doing
nothing.

A UNIQUE festival dating back to the days when ploughs were pulled by
horses drew visitors from many parts of the world to an Orkney island at
the weekend.
In the only event of its kind still surviving in Scotland, girls from
South Ronaldsay lined up to be judged as ''horses'' while boys used
hand-held ploughs to draw immaculate furrows along a sandy beach.
The occasion dates from the 1870s, when adult ploughing matches
involving Clydesdale and Shire horses started up throughout Orkney and
boys, keen to imitate their fathers, soon began their own contests.
Today the Festival of the Horse and Boys' Ploughing Match in South
Ronaldsay is the only surviving event.
Weeks of work by mothers and grandmothers go into producing colourful
and highly-detailed costumes based on horse harnesses for the girls who,
over the years, have all but taken over from boys in the horse section
of the festival.
This year, 21 girls and one boy -- two-year-old Christopher Burton --
lined up at Cromarty Square in St Margaret's Hope to be judged on the
quality of their outfits.
The action then switched to the Sands o'Right two miles away, where 20
boys using steel and wooden ploughs -- some more than 100 years old --
produced neatly ploughed rigs along the beach.

BIRMINGHAM: For the first time in three decades, Alabama's prisons are
today ringing out with the sound of steel crashing on rock as the
southern state revives its notorious rock-breaking chain gang.
Three months after Alabama became the first US state to revive the
chain gangs, 160 inmates, shackled together in leg irons, will be put to
work in the sweltering heat crushing chunks of limestone with
sledgehammers to make gravel for state roads.
Inmates, who say the leg irons make them feel like animals, are suing
Prison Commissioner Ron Jones and Alabama Governor Fob James, claiming
that the gangs violate their civil rights.--Reuter.

Firozabad
AT LEAST 300 people were killed today in one of India's worst train
disasters when two Delhi-bound passenger trains collided.
Troops were pressed into rescue work at the site. Nearly 20 hours
after the collision, rescuers were still finding bodies in the twisted
debris of the cars and said the death toll was expected to rise further.
''The entire area was reverberating with cries and shrieks,'' said
29-year-old passenger Manas Patnaik.
''I stumbled several times on severed limbs and some people -- I don't
know whether they were sleeping or dead.''
The accident occurred after the Kalindi express hit a cow on the track
at Firozobad, 125 miles from the Indian capital. Its brakes damaged, the
train came to a halt and was then rammed from behind by the Purshottam
express.
The Press Trust of India quoted railway officials as saying a
signalman had sent the second express down the track without realising
the Kalindi train had stopped ahead.
PTI said three cars of the Kalindi express were completely destroyed,
while the engine and two carriages of the other train crumped like balls
of paper and were thrown off the tracks.
Railway officials said most of the 2200 passengers aboard the two
trains were sleeping when the collision occurred.
''We were fast asleep when I heard a deafening bang,'' said
45-year-old Ram Singh. ''When I opened my eyes, I was lying here,'' he
said after being admitted to hospital in Firozabad with head injuries.
A senior police officer said that hundreds of people had been admitted
in hospitals, some of them critically injured.
''We have sent some injured people to Agra as there is hardly any room
here to attend to them,'' he said.
Today's toll exceeded the 270 people killed in 1981 after a train
plunged into the Bhagmati river in Bihar state.
Indian Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao, who last week took over the
railway minister's portfolio, expressed sorrow over the deaths and sent
senior officials to the site to supervise rescue work.
The state-run railways are an important form of transport across the
subcontinent and crashes involving the ageing rolling stock are fairly
common.
About 100 people died earlier this year in two separate rail
accidents.
Much of the Indian railway network is a legacy of British rule and is
the nation's single largest employer.--Reuter/AP.

AN intelligence-gathering team set up by the Government will begin its
task this week of helping to reduce the workload of junior doctors in
Scotland.
Members of the Special Support Project -- which includes a former
junior doctor from Stirling Royal Infirmary -- will visit NHS trusts
which are facing difficulties over the hours worked by staff in an
attempt to find solutions.
The setting up of the team was announced by the Scottish Office in
June and it will be in operation until the end of March.
Scottish Office Minister Raymond Robertson said yesterday that much
progress had been made in reducing the hours worked by junior doctors,
but more work had to be done to enable targets set out in the ''New
Deal'' to be met fully.
''I welcome this initiative in co-operation with the British Medical
Association to provide solutions which meet the needs of junior doctors
in Scotland,'' he said.
The New Deal was agreed between the UK Health Ministers and the
medical profession in 1990. Under its targets, no junior doctor should
be expected to have to work more than 56 hours a week.
An additional #4m was allocated in the current financial year to fund
extra posts, and this will take the expenditure on the New Deal in
Scotland to #13.4m.
Seventy-five new consultant posts are being funded and, when filled,
will represent a three per cent addition.
Senior house officer Dr Paul Scott, 29, who until recently was based
at Stirling Royal Infirmary, said he was delighted to have been
appointed to the project team.
''From now until the end of March, we will visit trust hospitals and
be lifting up the stone to see what is underneath,'' he said.
''We will endeavour to get hard information from people on the ground
to assess the implementation of the New Deal, including the use of the
resources which the Scottish Office has put into making it work.''
He said his role was to listen to junior doctors and point anyone with
a complaint in the right direction for help.
''Since the project is an intelligence-gathering operation, I hope
that juniors will feel able to talk to me,'' he said.
Dr Scott is joined in the team by a former NHS manager, two
consultants working on a part-time basis, and a nurse manager.

<HEADLINE>Camelot probes 'lottery scams'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976781454</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Lottery organisers are investigating claims that at least
four foreign commercial syndicates are charging overseas players almost
five times the face value of a ticket.
Camelot said yesterday it was concerned the syndicates were damaging
the ''integrity'' of the lottery.
A spokeswoman said the investigation was being led by its director of
security Neil Dickens, a former Metropolitan Police commander, who heads
a team of 10 security officers.
''We have got an investigation under way. Our concerns are to protect
the integrity of the National Lottery and to protect players,'' she
said.
News of the inquiry came as a Sunday newspaper claimed it had
uncovered one operation which uses an Amsterdam address but is based in
Manila in the Philippines.
According to the report, the syndicate employs 20 people to punch
selected numbers on to a computer disk. These are then sent by
electronic transfer to London where it is alleged an agent purchases the
tickets at a London branch of a superstore chain.
It said one client, a Swissair employee who lives in Bangkok, had paid
#162 for two #1 entries a week for 18 weeks -- almost five times the #36
a British player would pay. So far, she had won #10.
The Camelot spokeswoman said: ''This is one of four we know of. They
are charging huge amounts of money. We are looking at whether it is a
'con job' where people are paying money but not getting the tickets or a
case of people coming over here to buy tickets.''
One theory is that commercial syndicates may be taking clients' money,
not buying any tickets, and paying out the occasional #10 prize to avoid
arousing suspicion.
Camelot is looking to see whether any syndicates are in breach of the
law and whether it can avoid paying out to winners who have bought
tickets through these syndicates.
Under the Lottery Act and Camelot's licence, British citizens and
foreign tourists visiting the UK can play but expatriates can take part
only if they have a sterling bank account and a permanent address in the
country.
''We can refuse to pay somebody if we believe, and have proof, that a
ticket has been sold or transferred by way of trade so that someone has
made a profit by selling it,'' the spokeswoman said.
Camelot is asking retailers to look out for unusual patterns of ticket
buying which might indicate the existence of a commercial syndicate.
''These syndicates are not in the spirit of what the lottery is all
about and that is why we don't want this to be happening,'' said the
spokeswoman.

THOUSANDS of athletes sweated it out in the streets of Glasgow
yesterday to finish this year's Great Scottish Run -- the largest and
most popular of Scotland's marathon and half-marathon events.
A total of 7200 took part in the senior race, including the largest
number of top-class athletes in the event's 14-year history, and a
further 2000 entered the junior fun run.
Serious athletes limbered and stretched in George Square long before
the 11am start. Thousands of others descended on the city centre from
all directions shortly before a helicopter fly-past and single artillery
blast marked the start of the 13-mile race.
Celebrities such as Sir Jimmy Saville were among the participants,
many of whom raised cash for chosen charities.
Crowds in the square and surrounding streets cheered the runners as
they passed and hundreds more waited at Glasgow Green to welcome the
athletes at the finish line.
Bands, jugglers, and street entertainers were on hand to amuse the
crowds.
First over the line was wheelchair athlete Ross Low, 19, of Wishaw, in
55 minutes 41 seconds.
Mr Low, who represented Scotland at the Commonwealth Games last year,
said: ''I could have knocked a couple of minutes more off that time if
my wheel hadn't been falling off.
''I knew it was coming off as I went round but I chanced it and
thankfully had luck on my side.''
First in the main race was Kenyan Sammy Maritim with a time of 62
minutes 46 seconds.
He, and most of the other top athletes, finished around mid-day,
shortly before the sun came out and sent temperatures soaring.
Daft costumes were few and far between at this year's event. Dennis
the Menace, alias 47-year-old Graham Greenhalgh, of Clarkston, put the
lack of imagination down to the hot weather.
''Maybe the heat scared them off. I know I kept needing more water but
that was to fill my water pistol and scoosh spectators more than
anything else,'' he said. Mr Greenhalgh clocked a time of 97 minutes.
Staff at the Glasgow Weather Centre said the temperature had risen as
much as 5C to 25C (77F) in the space of just one hour.
Some athletes struggled over the line with the help of other runners
and race officials.
First aid staff were kept busy treating those suffering from the
effects of the heat. One man was taken to hospital after collapsing
during the race.
Ambulance crews took three others to hospital and two to the medical
centre on site. No-one was thought to be in a serious condition.
The race chairman, Mr Bob Stephen, said thousands of extra bottles of
water were brought in for dehydrated runners after the race.
He said: ''The warm weather means that runners will get dehydrated
fairly quickly and we thought it was best to have water available at the
start as well as water stations along the 13-mile route and at the
finish.''

Auckland
DETECTIVES investigating the murder of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon
Common three years ago have arrived in New Zealand to interview a man in
connection with the inquiry.
The two Scotland Yard detectives arrived in Auckland early today on a
flight from London via Los Angeles, and immediately caught an internal
flight to what Interpol in Wellington would describe only as ''a
provincial town'' to the south.
Inspector Lou Bennett, head of the New Zealand branch of Interpol,
based in Wellington, said local police officers would accompany the
British detectives to the house where the man they wish to question was
believed to be staying.
The address was being ''monitored'' by local police, said Inspector
Bennett, who added, however, that the man was not wanted for any
offences in New Zealand and police had no power to detain him there
should he wish to leave.
He dismissed earlier reports that the man, believed to be 30 or 31,
had been arrested on immigration charges.
Immigration records suggested the man entered New Zealand on a
six-month visitor's permit as recently as February.
It was believed he arrived in New Zealand from London with a
girlfriend, thought to be a New Zealander.
According to newspaper reports, the man police want to question
vanished three days after the murder and moved to New Zealand under a
false name after working in bars in Scotland.
The detectives made the 12,000-mile flight in response to information
from a member of the public who claimed to have seen a man wearing a
blood-stained shirt shortly after the brutal murder in south-west
London.
Ms Nickell, 23, a former model, was walking with her two-year-old son
Alex near her south London home when she was stabbed to death in front
of him.
Last year, murder charges against Colin Stagg in connection with the
killing were dropped at the Old Bailey.

THE 250th anniversary of the raising of the royal standard of Prince
Charles Edward Stuart -- Bonnie Prince Charlie -- was celebrated in
style at the weekend at Glenfinnan in the Highlands.
It was there that the Young Pretender landed on August 19, 1745, to
await the clansmen of the Highlands rallying to his cause.
Members of the White Cockade Society, a Jacobite re-enactment group,
did justice to the historic setting of Glenfinnan as they re-created the
event.
However, whereas the prince was greeted by only a handful of
Highlanders, the modern-day participants were welcomed by an
enthusiastic crowd of many hundreds, some of whom had travelled from
around the world.

<HEADLINE>Artist must lower flags after 'illegal advertising' ruling</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ARTIST and poet C John Taylor was never to anticipate the controversy
created after flags and bunting were placed along the road to his
Highland gallery.
Argyll and Bute District Council contended that the display
constituted unauthorised advertisements at the Seil Island showroom of
the Highland Arts business, which takes in more than #1m a year and
employs around 60 people.
An enforcement notice was issued -- which Mr Taylor, who also has
premises at Inveraray, Luss, and Callander, contested -- and the scene
was set for a legal tussle which went all the way to the desk of the
Scottish Secretary.
Now Scottish Office Inquiry Reporter William Patterson has ruled that
the 12 flagpoles at the ''large showroom for tourist goods'' on the
former slate-quarrying Seil Island, near Oban, are advertisements -- and
that the lot be removed.
As might be expected, Mr Patterson went to considerable trouble before
reaching his decision, even consulting Chambers dictionary to elucidate
the meaning of crucial words. In a five-page determination, the Reporter
carefully weighed the case presented by the district council and the
counter claims submitted by Stirling and Gilmour, of Helensburgh, Mr
Taylor's lawyers.
The solicitors claimed the flagpoles were not permanent features and
the flags not flown continuously and that the definition of
advertisements in the regulations did not include flagpoles flying
various national and state flags.
The district council argued, however, that the flagpoles and flags, in
the curtilage of a listed building, were contrary to advertisement
control policy.
The Reporter concluded: ''Plainly the flags, bunting, and poles cannot
be words, letters, models, signs, placards, boards, notices, awnings or
blinds, nor hoardings or balloons.'' Several strands of definition, he
said, lead to the view that the flags and bunting could qualify as
advertisements and the flagpoles which support them as things designed
for the display of advertisements.
Mr Patterson said: ''I therefore conclude that the flying of the flags
and associated bunting at the appeal site constitutes the display of
advertisements.

A DOG seized by police for killing a cat could be alone in kennels for
months while its case goes through court, its owner feared yesterday.
Police still have not told Lisa O'Brien, 23, of Bexleyheath, Kent,
where her bitch Lucy is being held, or even how she is.
The three-year-old English bull terrier was seized by police after
chasing and killing a neighbour's cat on Friday.
Ms O'Brien's solicitor, Mr Trevor Cooper, is planning to serve a writ
on Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon, claiming the
seizure was unlawful.
Mr Cooper said yesterday: ''Under the Dangerous Dogs Act, Lucy would
have to have injured a person, not a cat. The police said that because
the lady whose cat it was was in shock, that meant she had suffered an
injury.
''They seized the dog unlawfully. They had no reason to seize her at
all, even under this ridiculous Act.
Ms O'Brien, who is pregnant and claims she has been unable to sleep
for worry, has been told that she must pay #140 an hour if she wants to
see Lucy.
Mr Cooper said: ''It is the Met's standard practice to charge this
fee. If it had been her husband in the cells, she could have seen him
every day free of charge.''
A Scotland Yard spokesman said a decision on what to do with the dog
would be made today.

A SHETLAND councillor yesterday pledged to continue his battle to stop
island pensioners being means-tested and charged for their home-helps.
Cecil Eunson, an Independent representing Lerwick Breiwick, said the
wording on means-test forms sent out by the council's social work
department was ''high-handed'' and ''absolute nonsense''.
He predicted that many people would refuse to sign the forms, which
demand that applicants grant council officials ''irrevocable'' powers to
investigate their private financial affairs.
Despite losing two previous votes, Mr Eunson yesterday gave notice
that he will ask the full council to suspend standing orders at its next
meeting on September 26 and debate the issue a third time: ''There's
still time to stop the charges before they are introduced on October
1,'' he said
Mr Eunson was confident a majority of councillors would back him.
Social work chairman Leonard Groat said yesterday that he personally
regretted the need to impose charges but it was only a temporary measure
for six months.
''We're investigating different funds that we can use to avoid
charging for home- helps,'' he said.

<TEXT>
LABOUR is to ask the telephone watchdog, Oftel, to investigate what it
regards as back-door price rises for BT customers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths MP, its consumer affairs spokesman, said calls
lasting more than five minutes are more expensive under BT's new
''per-second'' charging system.
He wants Oftel to investigate this charging to decide if customers are
paying too much.
Mr Griffiths claimed that while the cost of a call lasting up to five
minutes is 20% cheaper than before, a 10-minute call is 13% more
expensive, a 20-minute call costs 14% more, and a 44-minute call is 24%
dearer.
''BT's television commercials and newspaper adverts say they have made
calls cheaper. Bob Hoskins says 'it's good to talk' but it's certainly
not cheaper,'' said Mr Griffiths.
''People thought the welcome introduction of per-second charging would
mean all bills would be cheaper or at least not dearer. Instead, BT have
used this as an excuse to put up their unit price from around 1.4p to
1.6p.''
He pointed out that in its advertising, BT says: ''We have introduced
price cuts which will save around 5% on the average bill.''
The Edinburgh South MP said: ''In BT's annual report, the chairman
makes it clear that customers are being forced to pay for the 100,000
redundancies which have occurred. That is why people are still paying
too much for their phones.''
A BT spokesman rejected Mr Griffith's claims: ''When we introduced
price changes on June 28, we said there would be an overall reduction of
5% in an average customer's bill . . . and that is a fact.
He said it was stated that some calls might cost more and some would
cost less. ''Eighty per cent of all calls cost less or the same as they
did before. Fewer than 13% might cost more.''

PRIVATE companies seeking to build and maintain part of the A74(M)
have until the end of this month to submit bids for the work, the
Scottish Office has announced amid further allegations that the project
marked the start of the ''creeping privatisation'' of roads in Scotland.
The Scottish Office refused to comment on a report that a consortium
called Roads in Scotland, including the Trafalgar House group, was
leading the bidding for the project. A spokesman said tenders were
expected to go out to the successful bidders in October or November.
The project, which was announced by the Secretary of State on June 15,
will be the first major road in Scotland to be refurbished as part of
the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), in which public services contract
private firms to carry out work and remunerate them at various stages.
The Skye road bridge is being constructed under PFI, and other
projects are to be considered by the Scottish Office.
The Scottish Office expects that the contracts on the Scottish side
will be worth up to #100m, with those on the English side worth between
#40m and #50m, but said this would be a matter for the Department of
Transport.
The spokesman denied that it meant privatisation or that there would
be toll booths.
The successful bidders will build and maintain the new road, with the
Government remunerating them annually over the length of the contract,
paying a fee based on the road's usage, a system known as shadow
tolling.
The project, which is due to start at the end of next summer, will
involve the upgrading of the road from Cleuch Brae to Paddy's Wrickle on
the Scottish side, and from Guard's Mill on the English side to the
border.
The Skye road bridge is being constructed under PFI and other projects
are to be considered by the Scottish Office.
The spokesman said: ''Instead of having to fork out #100m of
taxpayers' money in one fell swoop, the road will be built by private
contractors with the Government paying them back year by year over the
length of the contract, which will be up to 30 years.''
He added that some bids had been received and denied that the stretch
of the A74(M) involved would be privatised, stressing that there would
be ''no toll booths on the road''.
However, Labour's Scottish transport spokesman, Mr John McFall MP,
claimed the project would signify the start of the ''creeping
privatisation'' of roads and said the work should be paid for up front
by the Government.
''Given the pressure there has been both within and outwith Parliament
over the years on the Government to get something done to upgrade the
road infrastructure between England and Scotland, it seems absurd that
the Government are privatising this small part of the road when all that
is required in global terms when you look at the A74 is just a small
amount of extra capital.
''People will be at a loss to find that only this section of the road
has been earmarked for treatment from charging.''
Trafalgar House could not be contacted for comment yesterday.

<HEADLINE>#4696 for pregnant worker who was sacked</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976781463</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A BAKER'S employee, sacked after she became pregnant, has won #4696
compensation for unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow heard the sacking upset Miss Angela
Hall, who did not know how she would support her baby as she was too
young for State benefits.
Miss Hall, of Portal Road, Grangemouth, started working in the
Grangemouth branch of John C Dalziel (Airdrie) Ltd last October but was
sacked on February 4 this year.
The tribunal was told that Miss Hall told her manager on about January
10 that she was pregnant. She added that, about a week later, her area
supervisor said she would not be paid maternity leave and her manager
added that any ante-natal care or hospital visits also would not be paid
for.
About 10 days later, Miss Hall was given a week's notice, as Dalziel
was cutting back on full-time staff, but at the same time the company
advertised for part-time staff and two people started the week after she
left.
Dalziel's said Miss Hall was dismissed because of redundancy and
denied that the area supervisor said she would not get maternity pay.
The company also claimed that Miss Hall was offered one of the part-time
posts and refused it.
The tribunal said the case ''turned on credibility'' and described
Miss Hall and her witnesses as ''entirely credible and reliable''. It
''regrettably found itself in agreement'' with Mrs Elizabeth Gascoigne,
the former manageress of the shop in Grangemouth's La Porte Precinct,
that Dalziel was ''an unsatisfactory employer''.
The tribunal regretted that it did not find Mrs Sarah Brannen, the
company's area supervisor and its only witness, a totally credible and
reliable witness, ''being vague and evasive in her evidence''.
Mrs Brannen denied in evidence that Mrs Gascoigne asked her some time
after January 10 about Miss Hall's entitlement to time off to attend
hospital and totally rejected the suggestion that she knew the girl was
pregnant before she sacked her. The tribunal ''regretted that it did not
accept that evidence''.
In deciding Miss Hall was unfairly dismissed and sexually
discriminated against, the tribunal said: ''On all the evidence, the
tribunal inferred that the real and principal reason for the applicant's
dismissal was her pregnancy.''
It noted the potential liability for maternity pay if Dalziel's
employed the girl for 26 weeks and added that it was very surprised at
the casual manner in which the company approached employee relations and
compliance with employment law.
''This approach might have been acceptable in a very small business
with a handful of employees but not from a large employer with 350
employees in a considerable number of shops throughout Central
Scotland.''

SMOKE still hangs over Brighton Pier as Health and Safety Executive
officials begin investigating the cause of an explosion and fire which
caused extensive damage yesterday.
The explosion ripped through an electricity sub-station below decking
at the sea end of the pier. Electrician Mike Thompson, who was in the
sub-station trying to repair a fault, was blown against a door and
suffered severe face and neck injuries.
The blaze, which took hold above and beneath decking on the pier, also
spread to a booth and an electrician's van. It was brought under control
after about two hours.
Divisional fire chief George Hammond said: ''Conditions were as bad as
you could probably get. We had to get down through trap hatches and
crawl along piping.''

BRITISH workers are just not suited to taking a risk with the clothes
they wear to work, according to management magazine People Management.
While the hot weather may allow large numbers of men to wear shorts in
the streets, no matter how unwisely considering their shapes, few are
willing to try anything outrageous with their working clothes.
The magazine says that even with a few firms trying American-style
dress down days, people at work are still under great pressure to
conform to a conventional style of dress if they want to get on or be
taken seriously.
For the British male office worker, even minor deviations from the
uniform of dark suit, pale-coloured shirts, discreetly colourful tie and
black shoes would mark him out as lacking gravitas, says the management
magazine after investigating companies' dress rules.
Interest in casual dress policies in Britain has been a lot less than
in America, where many companies, particularly in electronics, allow
workers to dress casually on Fridays. Results in Britain are mixed.
ICL's manufacturing division D2D believes that a more relaxed style of
clothing encourages creative thinking and is considering extending its
casual dress policy from Fridays to the rest of the week.
However, Mercury Communications recently abandoned a casual dress
policy when some employees turned up for work looking too relaxed.
Computer company IBM followed its American headquarters' lead and
relaxed its dress code last year, but admits that many employees, after
initial enthusiasm, have reverted to traditional business wear.
For women, the dress problems can be even more difficult. Many women
on the way up in an organisation feel they are not taken seriously and
therefore play safe by dressing in a way that could not be seen as
remotely provocative.
However, if they become too solemn then that is not liked either.
One woman in a senior position told the magazine that she spends more
time thinking about what to wear at a presentation than on the
presentation itself.
''What all this boils down to is that women who want to get on in
conventional working environments and to command high salaries have to
dress soberly and formally in clothes that appear to mimic the male
business uniform, yet do not look masculine.''
As yet, the magazine has done no research into the career prospects of
West of Scotland males who insist on wearing white socks with black
shoes.
* Redundant executives over 50 are finding it easier to get new jobs,
it was claimed today. Their average search for a job took 6.3 months
last year, compared to 9.3 months in 1993.
While they still take 20% longer than their younger colleagues to find
work, the gap is quickly narrowing, said Drake Beam Morin, a firm of
career consultants.
Employers' attitudes to these workers were changing, it said.
''During the recession, many employers cut back dramatically on
training and that skills gap is now beginning to tell,'' said DBM
managing director Peter Trigg.
''By taking on someone older, employers benefit not only from that
person's mature attitude to work but from the training they received
when purse-strings were less tight.''

A CABER killed a dog in a freak accident at a Highland showground on
Saturday.
Beenie, a five-year-old terrier, belonged to Mrs Eileen MacKay,
secretary of Lairg Crofter's Show.
She said the death of the family pet had been a tragic end to what had
otherwise been one of the most successful shows ever.
''The competitor tossed the caber and unfortunately it just did not go
the right way,'' she said. ''Everyone on the field scattered
immediately. Beenie had been running about. We called her but she never
heard and it landed right on top of her.''
The local vet was on the scene in minutes but could do nothing to
help.
''The caber broke her neck. There was a bit of a heartbeat for a few
minutes but it was really just a case of waiting for her to die. It was
a tragic end to what had been a great day.''
Beenie was well known in the Sutherland village as the constant
companion of Mrs MacKay's father, Stuart, as he went about his coal
deliveries in his pick-up.
''He went just about everywhere with us and was known and loved by
everyone. The local boys were particularly sad,'' said Mrs MacKay.

<RECORDNO>976781467</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S most senior naval officer fired a broadside yesterday at the
BBC TV series, HMS Brilliant.
The First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Jock Slater, said he was extremely
disappointed by what he had seen so far of the fly-on-the-wall
documentary about life on board a Navy frigate.
The series implied that all sailors did was get drunk ashore, he told
Radio Scotland's Eye To Eye programme.
By focusing on one or two individuals, members of the crew of
Brilliant, it gave an impression which made him extremely uncomfortable,
because it was not the Royal Navy that he knew.
Some of the production, photography and camerawork was ''absolutely
fantastic''. However, what he was getting was a distorted image of the
Navy. ''It is failing to show the deep professionalism, the high calibre
of the people.
''It's tending to concentrate, in my view, on many areas -- what I
would call peripheral areas -- how people might or might not behave
ashore.''
Sir Jock said the series clearly wanted to deal with the issue of
women at sea and he knew it had to deal with life at sea ''warts and
all''.
He added: ''I am afraid I find at the moment this programme is
unbalanced. I think there's far too much concentration on peripheral
activity. There's an inference that all sailors do is get drunk ashore,
and the reality is not that.
''The trouble is, if you focus on one or two individuals and then show
scenes around that, in my view the viewers -- and there are seven or
eight million of them -- are getting a view of the Royal Navy which
makes me extremely uncomfortable because it is not the Royal Navy I
know.
''And certainly those I have spoken to within the Royal Navy are
deeply disturbed by what has been shown.''
Sir Jock said he had received many telephone calls and letters, asking
what was going on and why had he allowed the documentary. He said it was
important that taxpayers could see what their money was spent on.
The fifth episode of HMS Brilliant can be seen on BBC1 on Wednesday
evening.

THE Queen saluted Britain's military and civilian heroes last night as
she led the nation in the final great tribute to the war-time
generation.
Emotional church services and ceremonies were held across the country
and peals of church bells rang out in thanksgiving for the end of the
Second World War, 50 years ago.
The Queen made special reference to the veterans of the Far East in
her tribute speech, stressing there were no ''forgotten armies'' but ''a
vast number of men and women who had fought for, and saved, the future
of the free world''.
She went on: ''I am speaking not only of the troops from the
Commonwealth but also of the nurses, firemen, miners, factory workers,
merchant seamen, of all who, in that time-honoured phrase, 'did their
bit'.
''We pay tribute to those who survived and remember with sorrow, but
with gratitude, those who did not. Together, they gave us the chance to
build a world anew.''
A spectacular Beating Retreat ceremony on Horseguards' Parade in
London with military bands, a 300-strong choir, and a symphony orchestra
marked the end of six years of Second World War anniversaries.
In a poignant ceremony, 1000 children walked slowly on to Horseguards'
Parades, holding candles.
The Queen then made her way through the young crowd to the stage to
deliver her speech and bring down the curtain on the VJ-Day
commemorations.
She emphasised that the aim of the weekend's events were to thank
those who fought for their country and to remember those who died.
''Many and deep were the scars it left, physical and mental,'' she
said. ''Our dogged endurance left our resources much depleted. Yet, in
the end, we came through triumphant.
''It is right, therefore, that those who enabled us to achieve the
victory should take pride of place in these final commemorations.
Tonight, we salute them, just as we did on VJ-Day 50 years ago.''
She called on the nation to cherish the qualities that brought Britain
through the terrible war years ''the courage, the comradeship, and,
above all, the sense of common purpose.
''It is for us, now, through God's mercy and our own continuing
vigilance, to prove that the sacrifice was not made in vain,'' she said.
Organisers of the Government's commemorations described the event as
the final tribute.
The heroism of the RAF was marked in 1990 with the 50th anniversary of
the Battle of Britain. It was the turn of the Army in 1992 with the
anniversary of El Alamein and then the Royal Navy in 1993 with events to
mark the Battle of the Atlantic.
Brigadier Tom Longland, head of the commemorations team, said: ''This
is very much the last tribute to the wartime generation.''
On Saturday, more than 25,000 war veterans took part in an open-air
remembrance service outside Buckingham Palace and then marched past the
Queen and other members of the royal family.
A Lancaster bomber flew overhead, opening its bomb doors to scatter a
million poppies over the crowds along The Mall.
The focus then shifted to the River Thames for a spectacular firework
display, watched by the Queen and family from the Royal Yacht Britannia,
moored close to the Tower of London.
The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh began yesterday with a special VJ-Day
service at the Tower of London.
During the service, attended by about 250 guests, dignitaries, and
veterans, the Last Post was sounded and the congregation pledged to
remember the sacrifice of those who fought.
All across Britain, church bells rang out at noon in a nationwide
thanksgiving.
At a VJ-Day ceremony in Northern Ireland, the Duke of York said no-one
could doubt the loyalty and strength and commitment of Ulster folk.
He joined 3000 veterans at a drumhead service at Balmoral Showgrounds
and recalled his pleasure at attending Ulster's VE celebrations and the
''massive public support''.
a lasting peace.
The drumhead service has its origins in military history when
regimental drums were piled one on top of one another before a religious
service.
The Duke told an estimated 3000 veterans and currently serving members
of the armed forces: ''I have had the honour to serve my country in a
much smaller war.''
Today's servicemen were and always would be as committed as the
veterans were 50 years ago, he said.
''Your courage and steadfastness is an inspiration to all who follow
in your footsteps,'' he said.
All three services were represented at the event including a full
colour guard from HMS Liverpool -- the first Royal Navy warship to pay
an official visit to Belfast for more than 25 years.
Minister of State Sir John Wheeler quoted the words of the Duke's
grandfather, King George VI, in his address to the Stormont parliament
in July 1945, in which he said that in every sphere of the national
life, Ulster men and women had shown unflinching readiness to face
dangers and to bear hardships and toil.

TWO war veterans who last saw each other on the battlefields of Korea
44 years ago were reunited yesterday -- thanks to a Jimmy Shand video.
Last night, the two survivors of a group of six friends who fought as
part of a United Nations force in the Korean War enjoyed the dram they
had promised each other.
Mr Davie Ritchie and Mr Archie Morrison trained together in the Kings
Own Scottish Borderers but lost touch during the bitter conflict.
However, a Christmas present of a Jimmy Shand video brought the pair
back together.
Mr Morrison, formerly of Cardenden, Fife, but who now lives in
Maidenhead, had joined a Scottish neighbour to see in the New Year and
view the video.
He said: ''I noticed that the fiddle player looked like Davie and when
I checked the video cover, I saw that the fiddler's name was Jim
Ritchie.
''Through my neighbour's sister in Inverness, I was able to get in
touch with Jim and he gave me Davie's number.''
Mr Ritchie, of Cairnie Loan, Arbroath, added: ''It's just great to see
Archie after all these years.
''I couldn't believe it was him when I got the phone call. I was just
dumbfounded.''
Mr Morrison travelled up from England yesterday for a celebratory
dram. He joked: ''Davie said the drinks would be on him when we next
met. I've been waiting for this for 44 years.
''We can't get over the coincidence that put us back in touch and we
will be toasting the health of Jimmy Shand as well as the memories of
our old comrades.''
* ARBROATH Abbey was packed on Saturday for a drumhead service marking
the VJ- Day anniversary.
Tourists joined townspeople to watch World War Two veterans, Royal
Marines from nearby Condor base, and US Navy personnel from Edzell
parade to the abbey.
Later, the Earl of Airlie, Lord Lieutenant of Angus, took the salute
when the parade left the abbey service.
In the evening, Arbroath was blanketed in thick sea mist but the
town's Victoria Park promenade had one of its biggest crowd ever to
watch a fireworks display mounted by Angus District Council.

AN old soldier was barred from attending the National VJ-Day service
in Edinburgh.
Mr William Goudie, 83, was stopped from going into the memorial
service at St Giles' because he did not have a ticket.
Mr Goudie, who served as a gunner with the Royal Artillery in Burma,
had made a 150- mile round trip from his home in Ayr for the service.
Instead, he sat outside in the cathedral yard and remembered his
comrades who failed to return from the conflict.
He said: ''It's ridiculous. I came all this way only to be told they
didn't want me. No-one told me you needed a ticket.''
Yesterday, a spokesman for the Scottish Office, who organised the
event, said: ''We're sorry Mr Goudie came all this way but it was a
strictly ticket only event. If we'd made one exception then we'd have
had to make more.''

THE Queen Mother charmed thousands yesterday when she joined scores of
Second World War veterans in an emotional service of commemoration in
Wick, close to the Castle of Mey, where she is currently staying.
Well-wishers lined the street as the 95-year-old who was Queen during
the war, drove to the event in Wick's Riverside Park.
The Queen Mother, in sunglasses after a recent eye operation, stepped
gingerly from a Range Rover but walked the few steps unaided to a
waiting chair from where she watched the proceedings.
She stood to join in the hymns and prayers and many war veterans were
obviously emotional as Royal British Legion chaplain, the Rev Stewart
Frizzell, paid tribute to those who gave their lives.
''For victory there is always a high price to be paid,'' he said and
spoke of those who died.
He added: ''Many others lived on, broken in body, broken in mind, and
broken in spirit. Dotted throughout the land there are hospitals and
homes full of these old who didn't only suffer but are still counting
the cost.''
Mr Frizzell said the day was to ''remember the tragedy of those who
still suffer and to thank those who never came back''.
Dressed in a flowery summer dress and mint green coat and hat, the
Queen Mother spent time chatting to about 25 veterans of the fight
against Japan in the Far East.
Mr George Macrae, who lives in Canisbay near Wick, said: ''This is a
day a lot of us thought we would never see, but it is nice to do
something to remember those who we lost in the Far East.
''It was an emotional day for us all but it was certainly nice to have
the Queen Mother here. She really showed a great interest and asked
everyone what they had done during the war.''
The Queen Mother's only nervous moment was when she faltered slightly
as several firecrackers were exploded in the sky to mark the end of the
ceremony just as she was departing.
She steadied herself on the arm of the Vice Lieutenant of Caithness,
Major Graham Dunnett, who reassured her and explained what was
happening.

WAR veterans took their places in Glasgow Cathedral yesterday for a
special remembrance ceremony amid American tourists and onlookers from
the Far East.
Inside the cathedral, there was no warm sunlight, only cold, grey
stone and the stark memories of loved ones and friends who had perished
in the war.
War widows, brothers, sisters, and grandchildren filled the pews
alongside the members of the Royal Navy Voluntary Reserve and
representatives from the RAF.
''We should never forget what has happened,'' said Mr Robin Ewing, 78,
of Bishopbriggs.
''But it won't be easy as time goes on. We're going to run out of war
veterans like myself to fill these places in years to come. And who's
going to remember then?'
''Our grandchildren and children will care but they won't remember in
the same way as the men here with the medals pinned to their jackets.''
Mr Ewing's role in the war was of a signals man stationed in India and
Burma.
''I remember during one air raid watching silhouettes of Kamikaze
pilots coming towards the boat I was on.
''They flew so low the guns couldn't take shots at them in case they
hit another boat. We thought at the time that was the end, but we
survived.''
''I find it very difficult to relate to a nation who could do that
sort of thing,'' added Mr Ewing.
''They were conditioned to it as far as I'm aware -- to fight to the
end or nothing.''
During the 75-minute commemoration and thanksgiving service, guest
preacher the Rev Kenneth MacVicar, told of the awfulness of the
conditions servicemen were forced to operate under and of how they
turned defeat into victory.
As leader of Hurricane Squadron 28, he organised low- level
reconnaissance exercises until he was shot down, captured, and spent the
last 36 hours of the war on the Japanese front line being shelled by
British guns.
''My main concern at this service was to tell people of the terrible
time our boys had,'' he said.
Retired Merchant Navy captain James Henshelwood was aboard the
Imperial Monarch -- the first ship to be bombed in the North Sea at the
beginning of the Second World War.
''This morning's was an excellent service,'' said Mr Henshelwood, 74,
of East Kilbride. ''It meant a lot to me.
''It's important to remember all those who never came back, or who did
make it back but in a very bad way. You only have to look at Erskine to
see what I mean.
''It was the ultimate sacrifice -- to go to war and be prepared to
risk your life if necessary. And many did.''

THE Queen saluted Britain's military and civilian heroes last night as
she led the nation in the final great tribute to the war-time
generation.
Emotional church services and ceremonies were held across the country
and peals of church bells rang out in thanksgiving for the end of the
Second World War, 50 years ago.
The Queen made special reference to the veterans of the Far East in
her tribute speech, stressing there were no ''forgotten armies'' but ''a
vast number of men and women who had fought for, and saved, the future
of the free world''.
She went on: ''I am speaking not only of the troops from the
Commonwealth but also of the nurses, firemen, miners, factory workers,
merchant seamen, of all who, in that time-honoured phrase, 'did their
bit'.
''We pay tribute to those who survived and remember with sorrow, but
with gratitude, those who did not. Together, they gave us the chance to
build a world anew.''
A spectacular Beating Retreat ceremony on Horseguards' Parade in
London with military bands, a 300-strong choir, and a symphony orchestra
marked the end of six years of Second World War anniversaries.
In a poignant ceremony, 1000 children walked slowly on to Horseguards'
Parades, holding candles.
The Queen then made her way through the young crowd to the stage to
deliver her speech and bring down the curtain on the VJ-Day
commemorations.
She emphasised that the aim of the weekend's events were to thank
those who fought for their country and to remember those who died.
''Many and deep were the scars it left, physical and mental,'' she
said. ''Our dogged endurance left our resources much depleted. Yet, in
the end, we came through triumphant.
''It is right, therefore, that those who enabled us to achieve the
victory should take pride of place in these final commemorations.
Tonight, we salute them, just as we did on VJ-Day 50 years ago.''
She called on the nation to cherish the qualities that brought Britain
through the terrible war years ''the courage, the comradeship, and,
above all, the sense of common purpose.
''It is for us, now, through God's mercy and our own continuing
vigilance, to prove that the sacrifice was not made in vain,'' she said.
Organisers of the Government's commemorations described the event as
the final tribute.
The heroism of the RAF was marked in 1990 with the 50th anniversary of
the Battle of Britain. It was the turn of the Army in 1992 with the
anniversary of El Alamein and then the Royal Navy in 1993 with events to
mark the Battle of the Atlantic.
Brigadier Tom Longland, head of the commemorations team, said: ''This
is very much the last tribute to the wartime generation.''
On Saturday, more than 25,000 war veterans took part in an open-air
remembrance service outside Buckingham Palace and then marched past the
Queen and other members of the royal family.
A Lancaster bomber flew overhead, opening its bomb doors to scatter a
million poppies over the crowds along The Mall.
The focus then shifted to the River Thames for a spectacular firework
display, watched by the Queen and family from the Royal Yacht Britannia,
moored close to the Tower of London.
The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh began yesterday with a special VJ-Day
service at the Tower of London.
During the service, attended by about 250 guests, dignitaries, and
veterans, the Last Post was sounded and the congregation pledged to
remember the sacrifice of those who fought.
All across Britain, church bells rang out at noon in a nationwide
thanksgiving.
At a VJ-Day ceremony in Northern Ireland, the Duke of York said no-one
could doubt the loyalty and strength and commitment of Ulster folk.
He joined 3000 veterans at a drumhead service at Balmoral Showgrounds
and recalled his pleasure at attending Ulster's VE celebrations and the
''massive public support''.
a lasting peace.
The drumhead service has its origins in military history when
regimental drums were piled one on top of one another before a religious
service.
The Duke told an estimated 3000 veterans and currently serving members
of the armed forces: ''I have had the honour to serve my country in a
much smaller war.''
Today's servicemen were and always would be as committed as the
veterans were 50 years ago, he said.
''Your courage and steadfastness is an inspiration to all who follow
in your footsteps,'' he said.
All three services were represented at the event including a full
colour guard from HMS Liverpool -- the first Royal Navy warship to pay
an official visit to Belfast for more than 25 years.
Minister of State Sir John Wheeler quoted the words of the Duke's
grandfather, King George VI, in his address to the Stormont parliament
in July 1945, in which he said that in every sphere of the national
life, Ulster men and women had shown unflinching readiness to face
dangers and to bear hardships and toil.

BLUR last night won the biggest battle of the bands of the 1990s when
the Essex boys' single, Country House, pipped Roll With It from
Mancunian rivals Oasis for the number-one slot in the BBC Top 40 chart.
It is Blur's first number one and only the third time that the top two
positions have been taken by new entries.
Between them, the two singles sold around half a million copies in
just six days.
The media excitement over the simultaneous release of singles by the
two bands has boosted their careers immeasurably. Gritty, thuggish
northern rockers Oasis were contrasted with artsy, foppish southern
wordsmiths Blur in publicity that presented the bands as representing
two sides of the British character.
Their rivalry was compared to that of the Beatles and the Rolling
Stones in the 1960s.
National record chains HMV and Virgin both reported Blur outselling
Oasis by about 10%, with singles sales well up on a normal summer week.
Oasis, with their more dedicated following, quickly built up a lead
after the singles' release on Monday but the more widely accessible Blur
gradually crept up on their rivals to take the top spot.
By Saturday night, both singles had sold more than 200,000 copies,
said pop music expert Tony Brown of Entertainment Research and Analysis.
He said: ''In sales terms, it does compare with the days of the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones and, in profit terms, the cash coming in
will be higher because people are buying CDs instead of vinyl.''
The only previous weeks when the top two slots were taken by new
entries were in 1984 -- BandAid's Do They Know It's Christmas and
Wham!'s Last Christmas -- and 1989, when Jason Donovan's Sealed With A
Kiss topped Cliff Richard's The Best of Me.
Mr Brown said: ''Blur and Oasis have sold more than Jason and Cliff
did but they don't compare with the BandAid and Wham! week, which saw
the top two singles sell more than two million between them.''

<HEADLINE>IRA arms still hinder talks, says Ancram</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976781476</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland Minister Michael Ancram said yesterday there could be
little progress to all-party talks in Ulster with the implicit threat of
violence from the IRA.
He said: ''As long as there is not one bullet or one ounce of Semtex
handed over, a question must remain.
''Why, if a party says it is committed to exclusively peaceful
methods, (does) it need to retain its arms?''
However, the nationalist SDLP leader, Mr John Hume, said the
Government should bring all parties to the table to achieve a deal which
would produce lasting stability.
Mr Hume, speaking on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost programme almost a
year since the IRA ceasefire began, said: ''A year ago, no-one would
have forecast we would have had a year of peace.
''I'm quite disturbed by the slowness of the Government to move to
solidify. Ordinary people don't understand why the Government will not
bring people to the table.''
He said the decommissioning of arms was a pre-condition that was never
mentioned at any stage when he was engaged in dialogue which led to the
cessation of violence.
''It is a matter, I believe, which can be settled in the course of the
talks process to the satisfaction of all sides.
''Anybody who knows anything about Ireland knows that most major
political parties in Ireland were founded out of the gun.
''Where are their guns? Did they ever hand their guns over to British
governments? No they didn't.''
However, Mr Ancram, the chief negotiator for the Government, said that
as long as there was a party coming to the negotiating table with the
threat behind them that if they did not get what they wanted they could
return to violence, ''you are not going to get agreement round that
table, or people coming to that table in the first place''.
He told the same programme: ''We are desperately keen to take this
process forward . . . but we have to take it forward on a credible basis
because the last thing we should do for the people of Northern Ireland
is create a house of cards which then collapses.''
In Londonderry, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchell McLaughlin said there
could be no peace without a negotiated settlement and no settlement
without political talks.
He called on the Government to ''take risks for peace'' and to stop
''making excuses'' for not involving Sinn Fein in all-party talks.
The leader of the Roman Catholic church in Ireland yesterday urged
Sinn Fein to make every effort to understand Unionists and try to
reassure them about their future.
Failure to by-pass the ''roadblock of decommissioning'' would be
unforgivable, Cardinal Cahal Daly said.
Speaking in Stewartstown, County Tyrone, he said Sinn Fein had to
accept it was a republican movement which had caused most of the fear
and suspicion felt by Unionists. Dialogue between the political parties
was ''now a primary necessity''.
Referring to decommissioning, the Primate said there was ''surely room
for intermediate decisions'', adding that the British and Irish
governments and the political parties should be ''actively searching for
such a position''.

THE Herald's awards for the best of the talent at Edinburgh's
festivals made their debut at a glittering ceremony on Saturday. As did
the complementary awards for those to whom the fates have not been so
kind.
The first two of the coveted Herald Angels -- awarded at the end of
every week of the festival -- were presented by actress Janet Suzman to
Peter Sellars for his unclassifiable contribution, with composer John
Adams and librettist June Jordan, to the International Festival's opera
programme, I Was Looking At The Ceiling and Then I Saw The Sky, and to
Edinburgh's own Theatre Workshop, celebrating its 10th Fringe year with
a much-praised programme of French theatre.
The trophies, designed by sculptor Allan Ross, go to the work that has
most impressed The Herald's team of festival reviewers and are presented
alongside Herald Little Devils, gremlins awarded as a consolation prize
to those the reviewers feel have persevered to put their show on against
the odds.
The first ''winners'' of the Little Devils are the Fringe performer
Cecilia Delatori and a new event, Bluefest.
Ms Delatori was forced to switch her programme completely after a
series of disasters -- befitting a new take on ''the Scottish play'' --
befell her original production, a show due to combine Macbeth with step
aerobics. Against the clock, her Reservoir Kittens company produced an
alternative that has been received enthusiastically by reviewers.
The second award is made to Bluefest, Edinburgh's first showpiece
lesbian and gay arts event. The Fringe group was beset with problems
after a legal wrangle and new ownership left them without a venue. They
quickly found an alternative home at The Venue nightclub before
organisers Blue Moon Productions decided to cancel the event because of
low audience numbers due to the relocation and fears of major cash
losses. By the end of the first week, only two shows -- one relocated to
the Traverse Theatre, and the other still at the Venue, survived.
The Herald wishes Bluefest better luck next time and it wins the award
for struggling on in the face of initial adversity.
The John Adams/Peter Sellars collaboration, Ceiling/Sky -- as it's
become known -- belongs to a broader category of American music theatre.
Despite drawing on the full range of musical Americana -- close harmony
groups, West Side Story, gospel, rap, rock, and composer Adams's own
brand of minimalism -- the sequence of more than 20 songs succeeds in
creating something new and genuinely crossover.
Every aspect of the show brimmed with energy, colour, and vigour:
decorated by the work of American graffiti artists, powered by the
astonishing playing of Avanti, who sounded like an extremely
sophisticated rock band but are, in fact, Finland's leading contemporary
music ensemble and fronted by seven singers of breathtaking ability.
Theatre Workshop, in a fruitful collaboration with the French
Institute, has shown that exceptional and original work is to be found
close to home.   .
Whether it's the endearing charm of Embarquez, five female clowns, the
engaging postal fantasy of Velo Theatre's Enveloppes et Depallages, or
the liberatingly off-beat excursions of Nada Theatre's Romeo et
Juliette, the French contingent has set the pace for good humour and
imagination in the first week of this year's Fringe. They are the
centrepiece of a well-balanced programme at Theatre Workshop that
comfortably embraces high quality international work, some of the best
Scottish professional theatre, and enterprising community productions.

BRITISH universities may become ''havens for the well-to-do'' unless
the Government increases the level of grants and loans available to
students, according to the SNP Euro MP Winnie Ewing.
Mrs Ewing, writing her monthly report to constituents in the Highlands
and Islands, says many students are dropping out of universities, not
because of examinations failure but as a result of financial hardship.
She says figures published by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals (CVCP) -- which show that the number of students dropping out
of courses throughout Britain increased by 25% to about 40,000 between
1991/92 and 1992/93 -- highlight the gravity of the situation.
''Only 15,000 of those left because they had failed exams. While one
cannot generalise about what made the other 25,000 give up, the CVCP
makes it clear that financial problems are driving the increase.''
Mrs Ewing continues: ''The plight being faced is repeated on campuses
across Scotland: students skimping on food to save money; students whose
basic living costs are more than the maximum available in grant and
loans; students sacrificing studies to take part-time jobs; and students
who reach breaking point and drop out.''
She adds: ''There is little doubt the blame lies with the Government.
In the last decade, students have lost a string of income sources, from
housing benefit to equipment allowances. Meanwhile, the grant is in the
process of being cut by 30% (student loans will be increased by the same
amount).
''To an extent, it has reached the stage where the system of funding
is less important than the amount available. The long battle over the
concept of student loans is largely over -- university principals and a
growing number of students are ready to accept a fair scheme.
''The vital thing now is that enough money is available for students
to survive on. Whether that money comes as a grant or a loan is less
important than the fact that it comes. And quickly.''

TONY BLAIR'S supporters yesterday continued their efforts to stem the
tide of internal disquiet, which threatens to undermine a year of firm
party discipline, by warning disloyalty could lose Labour the next
election.
Shadow Cabinet members took to the airwaves to defend Mr Blair and to
warn the disgruntled left that the modernising will continue, regardless
of pleas for a halt to the rapid pace of change.
Their counter-offensive came as ballot papers were being prepared to
be sent to nearly 350,000 party members who will elect members of the
ruling National Executive Committee.
The result, due at the party's annual conference in October, will be a
major indicator of support for Mr Blair and his reforms. The election of
opponents of change would be an embarrassing setback for the leadership,
which has dismissed the criticisms as ''summer madness''.
Signs of difficulties with the NEC election came yesterday with
confirmation that Shadow Cabinet member Harriet Harman was not nominated
by her constituency because of her support for Mr Blair.
Her name was put forward at the last minute by her constituency
chairman and accepted by Labour headquarters, provoking anger in her
association and a demand that her nomination be withdrawn.
Meanwhile, education spokesman David Blunkett emphasised that failure
to back Mr Blair could let the election ''slip away'' again, while
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar reinforced the
leadership's sympathy for the left's concerns but made it clear it would
not alter its course.
''I don't believe any leadership can ask that constructive discussion
and debate should stop. The problem at the moment is that people with a
reasonable point are suddenly being paraded as examples of disloyalty,
often to their dismay,'' he said.
Discontent stemmed from reforms that had moved power out of the hands
of a few activists and to the membership. ''It's unavoidable that people
perhaps feel they have been devalued. But the party is solidly behind
the leader and I don't think that will alter his course or that the
party will want him to do so,'' Mr Dewar added.
However, the attacks on Mr Blair continued, with two hard-left MPs
criticising the leadership for abandoning Labour principles.
Mr Alan Simpson, the Nottinghamshire South MP who earlier this year
led the campaign against modernising Clause 4 of the Labour
constitution, said Labour was offering voters Tory policies.
He told BBC Radio: ''The tragedy would be that, having got to a point
where the public is seeing the current Conservative Government as pretty
corrupt and incompetent, it would be awful if the only choice we were
offering them was a set of policies the public had already turned its
back on.''
Earlier, Mr Jeremy Corbyn, Islington North MP and secretary of the
Socialist Campaign Group of MPs, said the Blair reforms had led to the
exclusion of party activists from policy-making.
''There is concern that changes in the party structure that Tony Blair
is pushing forward minimise the role of activists who built the party up
in the first place, and are an attempt to by-pass the grassroots of the
party in policy-making,'' he told BBC TV.
In reply, Mr Blunkett challenged the suggestion that popular measures
amount to a betrayal of Labour traditions. Recent attacks on the
leadership would not be recognised by the electorate or any of the
party's thousands of new members.
''There is a danger, in some people's view of the Labour Party from
within, that if we are popular with the electorate then somehow we have
betrayed our principles and values. I reject that entirely. Tony Blair
has leapfrogged the whole Conservative agenda,'' he said.
Mr Blair, who spent the weekend in London for the VJ- Day
commemorations before resuming his holiday in France, chose to avoid
making comment on the dispute. However, Labour sources pointed to the
results of an opinion poll taken since the attacks began two weeks ago
which shows that the party's lead over the Tories has increased.
The NOP survey in the Sunday Times put Labour 29 points ahead of the
Tories, with Labour on 54% (the same as July), and the Tories on 25% (2%
down on last month). The Liberal Democrats rose by 3% on July, to 17%.
Significantly, the number of people polled who agreed that Mr Blair
was behaving ''too much like a dictator in the way he leads the party''
fell to 18% this month from 24% in July. However, 55% of Labour
supporters believed Mr Blair's scale of reform had been about right,
compared with 16% who felt the reforms had gone too far and 15% who
thought they had not gone far enough.
Meanwhile, yesterday, a leading Blair supporter in Scotland took
dissident colleagues to task for criticising his drive to modernise the
party.
Motherwell North MP John Reid attacked ''the siren voices which have
constantly opposed every major reform of the past 10 years, from the
Militant expulsions to the Clause 4 renewal''.
Addressing a meeting of Labour youth in Glasgow he made a clear attack
on the Campaign for Socialism and fellow MPs who support the campaign,
such as George Galloway and Dennis Canavan.

TWO men are to appear at the High Court in Stirling today accused of
making threats and mailing fake letter bombs in a campaign to force the
Government to grant independence to Scotland.
Mr Terence Webber, 30, of Farquhar Road, Aberdeen, and Mr Kevin Paton,
27, of Charles Gardens, Inverurie, are accused of conspiracy to further
by criminal means the purposes of the Scottish National Liberation Army
and a group calling itself Flame.
They are accused of sending a letter to the Aberdeen-based Press and
Journal newspaper containing threats to attack English ''colonists'' and
disrupt their lives and property and threats to estate agents not to
advertise Scottish homes for sale outwith Scotland.
It is alleged the letter also contained instructions for the making of
an improvised explosive device.
The pair are also accused of sending letters containing a threat that
Mr Tony Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank, would be killed unless he
left Scotland within 30 days.
Mr Webber and Mr Paton are further accused of posting hoax letter

A WOMAN who was given a new lease of life when she received the kidney
of a car crash victim from Scotland yesterday had an emotional meeting
with the donor's parents.
Ms Bridget Marriner, 35, was competing in the World Transplant Games
at Wigan when she finally got the chance to tell David and Jean Cameron,
from Bishopton, Renfrewshire: ''Your son saved my life.''
It is extremely rare for transplant patients to meet donors' families
but Ms Marriner, a bank worker, from Saffron Walden, Essex, wanted Mr
and Mrs Cameron to know how much the transplant had meant to her. Their
son, Derek, who was 28, died in a car accident, in 1991.
Ms Marriner, who could hardly climb the stairs before her operation,
wrote to the couple through Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for two
years -- without knowing who they or the donor were -- before Mr
Cameron, a newsagent, could bring himself to reply.
Yesterday, against the advice of professional counsellors, she finally
met her donor's family. ''I just ran over and there were lots of hugs
and kisses and, for the next three hours, lots of laughter and tears,''
said Ms Marriner, who suffered kidney failure in her late 20s from a
hereditary disease.
''At school, I did everything I could to avoid sports but, after the
operation, I started training and running. Later, I discovered Derek was
very athletic and just feel that it is him running for me.
''I wrote to his parents, because I wanted them to know that their
misfortune meant that I was alive and to say thanks a million,'' she
said at the games, where earlier in the week she won a silver medal in
the 5k road race and yesterday won gold in the women's 1500m final, with
a personal best time of 7min 9.86sec, and bronze in the women's 800m
final.
As she crossed the finishing line in the 1500m, she was congratulated
by Mr and Mrs Cameron. ''I did it for my family and Derek -- it's a
fabulous feeling,'' said Ms Marriner.
Mrs Cameron said: ''I just felt as if it were Derek crossing the
line.'' Mr Cameron said: ''It took me about two days to write that first
letter to her. In two years we had not been able to cope with the
thought of writing to her, although we got real comfort from her
letters.''
Mrs Cameron said she and her husband now wanted to encourage more
people to donate organs.
''Having met Bridget, we know finally that our decision was the right
one and that it has all not been a waste. Derek was so full of life and
now we have a new member of the family in Bridget. We can talk about him
now with joy. Before, it hurt too much,'' she said.
On March 6, 1991, Ms Marriner got a call from Addenbrooke's, saying
there was a kidney available.
She said: ''It was a funny feeling -- I was very excited, with no fear
of the operation. At the same time, I was acutely aware that at the
other end of the scale someone was very upset.
''The feeling of health I gained from the operation was immediate.
Within 24 hours, I felt better -- I was sore but my cheeks were rosy for
the first time in months.''
At first, all she knew about her donor was that he was a young man
from Scotland. She thought he had been about 10. Now she knows Derek
Cameron was a keen amateur footballer and all-round sportsman.
Mr Cameron said: ''At the time of Derek's death, we didn't know about
transplantation. It was a family decision to let his kidneys go -- now
we wish we'd given permission for more of his organs to have been used.
He was so fit and healthy that he could have given life to so many
people like Bridget.''
Leading transplant surgeon Neil Parrott, chairman of the Guardian
Insurance World Transplant Games, said: ''This meeting is a very rare
one -- its occurrence has come about because both parties wanted to
meet. David, Jean, and Bridget have found it a very special and
emotional time.''

SCOTLAND'S Chambers of Commerce yesterday launched an attack on what
they claim is the inadequate partnership and lack of proper
representation existing north of the Border between Government and
business.
They also challenged Labour to indicate the action it planned in order
to give them their rightful place as ''the premier representative of the
business community''.
Announcing they had commissioned the Fraser of Allander Institute to
conduct a survey of their 8000 members on devolution, they claimed
business, although the ''engine room'' for all national prosperity, was
currently not represented at local or national Government level.
''Accordingly, it is Scottish Chambers' intention to create its own
representation and this survey is an important element of this,'' said
the chambers, which detailed a number of radical changes they wanted to
see.
''The current system of democracy makes no provision for the business
community, despite its massive revenue-earning capacity, and there is
now a pressing need for change.''
The best opportunity, said the SCC, for the type of change suggested
was a General Election.
Mr Peter Dunn, acting director general of SCC, said that in view of
Labour's reported proposals concerning the establishment of a devolved
Parliament for Scotland in Edinburgh, it was only fitting the business
community should consider this proposal in advance of the next election.
''Our member companies employ more than 50% of the adult working
population of Scotland. Our views must therefore be important to any
'Government in waiting' in addition to the current administration.''
Mr Dunn, describing SCC as ''the authentic voice of the Scottish
business community'', said they wanted to create a new type of Chamber
of Commerce which would undertake important Government tasks at a local
level such as business information, commercial arbitration, and possibly
some tasks at present carried out by local authorities.
''Scotland would also be an ideal place to introduce compulsory
business registration as a pilot scheme and Chambers of Commerce are the
most suitable vehicle for achieving this.''
The chambers also want their business advisers co-opted on to local
authority sub-committees to inject expertise and also a system of
appointing LEC board members through local chambers ''in order to
eliminate the stigmatised political appointments at present''.
''Specifically, Scottish Chambers want the shadow administration to
consider what they intend to do about the current inadequate partnership
and lack of proper representation in Scotland between Government and
business and what provisions they intend to introduce to give Chambers
of Commerce their rightful place as the premier representative of the
business community.
''I would be most interested to receive a response from George
Robertson on this subject.''
A spokesman for the Labour Party in Scotland said they were delighted
the chambers were talking about a partnership between business and
government.
The present Government's dogma had frustrated business and its
approach had cost Scotland jobs.
He said that, over the past six months, a party ''task force'' had
been meeting business representatives and they would welcome the chance
to discuss the chambers' ideas.
A Scottish Parliament, he said, would mean Scottish businesses having
direct access to elected politicians taking decisions on the country's
economy.

SCOTLAND'S top criminal lawyers are facing a lottery for parking
spaces at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Privatisation of the car park means that next month many will no
longer be allowed the luxury of their own space at Europe's busiest
court.
One leading lawyer, Mr Bob McCormack, said: ''It's ridiculous. We have
to be at court hours before our clients to add the finishing touches to
their cases and take care of any last- minute details. We need somewhere
secure to park our cars.
''This latest move in Glasgow seems almost like an attempt to pervert
the course of justice. It's like locking doctors out of a hospital. It's
criminal.''
Car-park custodians in the Sheriff Clerk's Office conducted their own
defence, saying 20 of the city's law firms had been allocated spaces.
''It was all done democratically,'' said Mr Joseph Hutchison, acting
estates manager. ''However, not everyone who wanted a space was
fortunate enough to get one.
''There are only 141 car parking spaces out there and, since the
Sheriff Court first opened, more than 700 permits have been granted.''

ALISON Hargreaves' husband yesterday accepted reports that she had
died on the world's most dangerous mountain, K2, and strongly condemned
American news agencies which have been offering local Himalayan people
more than $1m to steal her effects from the mountain.
Mr James Ballard and Alison's parents met the press yesterday on the
slopes of Aonach Mor after reports from two Spanish climbers who had
been on the mountain with Alison and were now convinced she was dead.
Mr Ballard said it was now clear it had been the ferocity of jet-force
winds which had killed his wife and definitely not an avalanche.
It was almost certain that three Spanish climbers also made it to the
top of K2 on the same day as Alison's party of three. Mr Ballard said he
had also received ''some very unpleasant news''.
''There are American jackals offering enormous sums of money in the
area for the retrieval of Alison's personal effects from base camp. I
have heard from the guy on the ground and the sums mentioned have been
over seven figures in dollars. This is being offered to locals to spirit
away, redirect, steal her things.''
Mr Ballard said this had saddened him as had an unsigned ''hate
letter'' he had received from somebody saying that Alison should not
have been climbing because she had children. ''I don't know whether they
need medical attention,'' he said.
Returning to the attempts to steal his wife's belongings, he said:
''In underdeveloped countries, that sort of money is going to set their
families up for generations to come.
''There is an irony about it. If Alison had been in another age in
America, an outlaw, she would have been flattered that she had a bigger
price on her head than anybody else.
''They want everything. They wanted almost to pick up the tent and
wrap everything in it, and spirit it out.''
He said there could be no doubt they wanted to get her belongings to
see Alison's diaries. They would need to sensationalise the story to
recoup the money. ''You wouldn't wish that to happen to anybody you
cared about.''
He advised against anyone taking up the offer, as the Pakistan
military authorities had been informed. Arrangements were being made for
a BBC journalist in the area to try to collect Alison's things and bring
them back to this country.
''It is important to me that we get these things back, if nothing else
so that when Tom and Kate are old enough to read Alison's diaries they
can. I would love them to read them.''
Mr Ballard said that his two children, Tom, six, and Kate, four, were
adamant they wanted to go to K2 to see their mother's last mountain. He
would be trying to organise that within the next two weeks, although the
weather was deteriorating in the area. He had been in touch with the
country's leading altitude doctor but if he could not accompany them he
probably would not go.
Alison's parents, John and Joyce Hargreaves, from Derbyshire, said
yesterday, however, that they felt it was too soon for the children to
go. Mrs Hargreaves, a retired deputy head of an independent girls'
school, said: ''If Jim says he wishes to take them, we would not say to
him you should not. Our feeling is that it might mean more to them when
they are older. Jim, I think, feels they should go soon. We have agreed
to differ on that.''
Mr Hargreaves, who before retiring worked in BR's research department,
said: ''I think we should go sometime. The time to go is not now.''
Two Spanish climbers, the only survivors of a five-man expedition on
K2, were said to have discovered Alison's body on Monday afternoon,
about 1400 metres below the summit.
They identified the body from her climbing harness, one of her boots
and her jacket.
Mr Ballard received the news from interpreter Jose Bermudez, who
interviewed the Spaniards by telephone after they were airlifted,
frostbitten and exhausted, to Skardu, the nearest permanent habitation
about five miles from the base of K2.
Mr Ballard said: ''Obviously, I prepared myself for this thing. This
probably is the start of the close of the book.''
The two Spaniards who discovered Alison's body were part of an
expedition which failed to reach the summit. Three were killed during
their descent.
Mr Bermudez, a 28-year-old Colombian research fellow at Cambridge
University, said the Spaniards assumed Alison had fallen ''probably from
an area somewhere between the summit and Camp Four''.
The Spanish climbing party reached 8000 metres on K2 before being
beaten back by high winds. They said they had seen no trace of Alison's
colleagues, six of whom are still missing.
* Meanwhile the climbing world was mourning the deaths of two top
British mountaineers swept to their deaths in an avalanche on another
mountain in the Himalayas.
Mr Paul Nunn, the 52-year-old president of the British Mountaineering
Council, and Mr Geoff Tier, 50, were part of a five-man British team
which had conquered the unclimbed 6666-metre Haramosh 2 in Pakistan when
disaster struck.

A SURVEY of mature law students at Strathclyde University shows most
favour a change in the way the legal profession markets and regulates
itself.
A majority, 59%, also think a Scottish parliament or assembly would
lead to more work for solicitors in Scotland.
Strathclyde University began the part-time LLB course in Scots law
three years ago.
Professor Alan Paterson, head of the Law School, said yesterday: ''The
survey clearly shows that our part-time LLB students -- who represent a
broad spectrum of professional and occupational development and,
therefore, a far greater breadth of experience than most law students --
want the profession to develop and diversify in new ways.''
The students say they want the profession to market itself more
effectively, with nearly nine in 10 agreeing that the Law Society of
Scotland should fund and organise a campaign to highlight the benefits
-- particularly to commercial organisations -- of using legal services
in Scotland.
Professor Paterson said: ''Many of our part-timers do not intend to go
into practice on graduating but are convinced of the career advantages
to be gained through combining a legal qualification with their current
professional experience and expertise, thus bringing added value to work
in fields outwith the legal profession.
''By carrying out this new attitude and aspiration survey of the
lawyers of tomorrow, the Centre for Professional Legal Studies at
Strathclyde University aims to open up the debate among the profession
and public alike as to the kind of service they want.''
The main findings of the survey were:
* An overwhelming majority (89%) say lawyers should pay a levy to fund
an industry-wide marketing campaign to identify and develop new areas of
business;
* The legal profession is too dependent on just two main sources of
income -- conveyancing (67% agreed or strongly agreed, while only 10%
disagreed or strongly disagreed) and criminal legal aid work (49% agreed
or strongly agreed, 14% disagreed);
* 88% of law students want the profession and the Law Society of
Scotland to fund and organise a marketing campaign aimed at highlighting
the benefits of Scots legal services to companies located in Scotland
but who use English-based firms or jurisdiction;
* In response to the statement: ''A Scottish parliament or assembly
would lead to more work for solicitors in Scotland'', 59% agreed or
strongly agreed. Only 11% disagreed or strongly disagreed;
* Nearly two students in three (63%) agree lawyers suffer from low
public esteem and nearly half (46.9%) say legal services are ''too
expensive'';
* 66% want an independent body to deal with the thorny issue of
complaints from the public about solicitors.

NEW Scottish Office guidelines to stop councils selling off playing
fields are unlikely to come into force in time to block Glasgow District
Council's plans to dispose of one of the city's largest recreation
areas.
Talks are under way between a private developer and the council to
sell Toryglen pitches on the south side of the city for a supermarket
development. Officially, no figure has been put on the deal, although it
is believed it could net the council as much as #5m.
Last week, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth announced that the
Scottish Sports Council should be consulted on all proposals affecting
sports pitches and local plans should include measures for their
protection.
However, the guidelines aimed at stopping ''unnecessary
redevelopment'' are in draft form and a Scottish Office spokesman said
yesterday they were unlikely to come into force until the new year.
A recent survey by the National Playing Fields' Association in
Scotland found that 600 acres of fields and parks had been lost in
Strathclyde in the past decade.
Glasgow District Council leader Pat Lally said he had not had a chance
to examine the proposed new guidelines but said he did not think they
would affect the transaction. He would not comment on exactly how much
was involved in the deal or who was involved.
''It has been bubbling away for some time now and I couldn't say
exactly when it is expected to be completed.''
Councillor Lally said the change in Scots attitudes to youth football,
which included smaller teams and more emphasis on grass pitches, meant
that the Toryglen pitches no longer met the standards required.
''These are blaes pitches and are not what is needed today. Many of
the football associations demand grass.''
Mr Allan Alstead, chief executive of the Scottish Sports Council, said
he had no details of Glasgow's plans but hoped councils would comply
with the spirit of the new guidelines until they came into force.
''Glasgow has a very great commitment to sport. I don't know the
details, but it would be very out of character for the council to take
this facility away and not provide alternative provision.''
Local Labour councillor Stuart MacQuarrie said he had mixed feelings
over the sell-off. ''As far as I understand, the pitches stretch to
about 25 acres, which is a fair size. I would be extremely unhappy if
this land was sold for a supermarket development as it would destroy the
local shopping in the area. I have also heard that it was being
considered for housing and I would not have such a great problem with
that.''
Last week, the district council completed plans to sell off a piece of
Queens Park recreation grounds to the Victoria Hospital Trust for the
nominal sum of #1. The land will be used to develop the hospital and the
sale was defended by the Scottish Office as quite different to the
projects Mr Forsyth is trying to control.
No-one was available at the Scottish Office yesterday to comment on
Glasgow's plans.

UNDERLYING inflation will peak later this year and fall below the
Government's 2.5% target by 1997, allowing Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to
cut interest rates in the autumn, an economics think tank said today.
A base rate cut from the current level of 6.75% would help the economy
shake off the effects of the mini-recession it had been going through,
said Professor Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for
Economics and Business Research.
The conditions for renewed growth -- including a recent pick-up in
global economic activity and a likely revival in consumer spending,
funded by rising real incomes -- were already in place.
Interest rates would therefore have to rise again at some point in
late 1996 or in 1997 to restrain excessive growth.
Professor McWilliams said the Bank of England, which has been pressing
Mr Clarke to raise interest rates since May, had suffered a temporary
loss of credibility since all the most recent statistics appeared to
have vindicated Mr Clarke's position.

LABOUR Front Bench spokeswoman Marjorie Mowlam was accused yesterday
of ''insulting Scotland and the people of Scotland'' when she claimed
that long-standing Scottish MP Sir Hector Monro was a ''Tory lemming''
who was fleeing Parliament.
Sir Hector, aged 72, whose wife, Lady Ann, died last year, announced a
few months afterwards that he was resigning from Parliament at the next
General Election.
However, Ms Mowlam -- who is Labour's summer campaign manager --
included Sir Hector in her list of what she called Tory lemmings who
were leaping because they had had enough of ''soldiering on under John
Major's lacklustre leadership''.
The Conservative MP for Ayr, Mr Phil Gallie, went to the defence of
Sir Hector, saying he was appalled at the tone of Ms Mowlam's attack.
''I think it is sad when a Labour Front Bench spokesman makes such
statements. Sir Hector is in his seventies. He has served his country
well. He has been in Parliament since 1964 -- over 30 years -- and I
think it's time he should step back and have a bit of a rest.
''Her remarks are an insult to Scotland and the Scottish people,'' he
said.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson said yesterday that Labour
was on track to reach agreement with convention partners on the final
details of a Scottish parliament.
He angrily rebuffed a media suggestion that a weekend meeting of the
party's Scottish executive had been a stormy affair and insisted he saw
no problems looming at tomorrow's meeting with partners in the Scottish
Constitutional Convention to discuss funding for the parliament.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's defence of Treasury funding for
Scotland based on need rather than revenue raised had changed the focus
of the discussion, he said, confirming that Labour was holding the line
on giving the parliament the power to raise or lower the standard rate
of income tax by up to 3p.
Mr Robertson said Labour had resolved to stop being defensive about
the benefits of a Scottish parliament and its associated tax powers, and
promised an autumn campaign meeting Mr Forsyth head-on over the issue.
Of press stories about London-induced ''wobbles'' on the commitment to
powers for a Scottish parliament, he was dismissive: ''The fact that we
have so many newspapers in Scotland and huge competition between them
means every nuance becomes prey to speculation.''
He believed the funding aspects of the plans for a Scottish parliament
would be finalised this week, leaving only the final contentious area of
the number of members who will sit in Edinburgh.
He has publicly favoured a figure of 112 but a consultation exercise
has shown widespread support for the Liberal Democrat preference for
145.

A MAN and a woman died of gunshot wounds yesterday after an apparent
dispute between neighbours got out of control.
Detectives were treating the incident in Milton Keynes,
Buckinghamshire, as a murder and a suicide.
It is understood that the 40-year-old man had been angered at the
behaviour of his girlfriend's next-door neighbour over a party and had
gone round to settle the dispute shortly before midnight on Saturday.
However, as the two men argued at the house in Althorpe Crescent, the
neighbour's wife was shot through the neck.
When the man realised he had killed the woman, mother-of-five Mrs Mary
Wilding, 50, he walked into the street and shot himself in the head.
A family friend said: ''He wanted to scare the woman's husband but,
unfortunately, she got caught in the middle and was shot in the neck.
''Everyone heard a bang and then a few minutes later there was another
shot, out in the street. I don't think he intended to hurt anybody.''
Mrs Wilding's bloodstained body was found lying on her front doorway.
The identity of the man will not be released until this morning. He
was found dead 50 yards away, in Stanton Avenue. His girlfriend was
being comforted by friends.
Ms Shelley Hayfield, a friend of the dead man's girlfriend, said she
understood tempers had flared over a rowdy party.
She described the man who died as very quiet. ''He was not a noisy or
rowdy person.''

FOUR British soldiers died yesterday after their Army Lynx helicopter
crashed into the sea in an accident off the Croatian coast.
The helicopter from 3 Regiment Army Air Corps was on a regular
training flight when it ditched in the sea five miles off the coastal
town of Ploce.
One of the five soldiers on board was rescued and helicopters were
scrambled from 24 Air Mobile Brigade at Ploce to search for the four
missing men.
However, military officials in the Croation town of Split confirmed
last night that the four had died and that the wreck of the aircraft had
been found five miles off Ploce.
The regiment, based at RAF Wattisham, Suffolk, flew to Ploce last
month as part of the build-up of the United Nation's rapid reaction
force in Bosnia.
The cause of the crash was unknown although it is understood the
weather was bad at the time of the crash.
Army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Barry Hawgood, based in Split, said
the incident had an increased poignancy because it came on the same day
colleagues were involved in VJ- Day ceremonies.
''This weekend has shown how dangerous the peace keepers' role is out
here,'' he said.
The dead soldiers had been in the former Yugoslavia for exactly two
weeks.
Lieutenant-Colonel Hawgood said the soldier who survived the crash had
survived by swimming away from the wreckage of the Lynx.
He was picked up by a Croatian fisherman who took him to shore from
where he was rescued by another Army Air Corps helicopter and taken to
hospital, where he was said to be in a stable condition.

SCOTTISH cricket's showpiece match of the season was marred by
violence last night as running fights erupted between rival spectators.
The violence, more associated with the football terraces, had been
threatened during the afternoon when there had been sporadic outbursts
of scuffling among the 800-strong crowd as rival factions baited each
other with club chants during the national Cup Final between West of
Scotland and Drumpellier at Glasgow's historic Hamilton Crescent ground.
Three people were arrested as police moved in to calm the crowd at
about 7pm. They were led away in handcuffs as other supporters were left
on the boundary edge to nurse cuts and bruises.
One young woman was taken to the Western Infirmary nearby after being
struck on the leg by a flying bottle.
The real trouble flared when supporters began to sing racist and
religious songs just before 7pm. Running fights developed with scores of
other fans -- including women and children -- scuttling to safety.
The two policemen on duty radioed for assistance and were eventually
backed up by three other officers.
At least four men were taken to Partick police office just a quarter
of a mile from the ground, which was the venue of the first Scotland v
England football match.
A spokesman for West of Scotland, the home club, said: ''It is a real
shame that such an occasion has been spoilt by the minority who were
clearly the worse for drink.
''If any of our members are proved to have been involved then we will
have to consider whether to welcome them back to Hamilton Crescent in
the future.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police confirmed last night that three
people had been arrested as a result of a disturbance at the cricket
ground. He added that they would be the subject of a report to the
procurator-fiscal.
Drumpellier lifted the trophy with a three-wicket victory.

<HEADLINE>Scots skipper nets the lottery</HEADLINE>

A SCOTTISH fishing boat skipper landed the catch of his life at the
weekend: #3.8m on the lottery.
Mr Alan Wilson's wife Janice phoned him on the ship-to-shore radio
with the news.
Mr Wilson, 29, who got his skipper's ticket only two weeks ago, then
headed for home in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire.
Last night, the skipper's boat Cardiva arrived back from the North Sea
fishing grounds and put into Scrabster. But Mr Wilson was so anxious to
get home he decided not to sail the last leg home to Fraserburgh -- and
hired a helicopter.
The win is the biggest in Scotland.
The boat's owner, Mr Andrew Buchan, of Charlotte Street, Fraserburgh,
said: ''Alan only passed his ticket two weeks ago.
''He was on a high then. Now he has won #3.8m, he will be flying.
''He is a conscientious young man who works very hard. With that
amount of money, he could afford to buy his own boat but somehow I don't
think so.''
The family home in Grattan Place, Fraserburgh, was empty last night,
but there was an empty Champagne case lying inside the foyer.
Mr Wilson has a brother David who is also a fisherman and a brother
Bill who works as an accountant.
After landing in his hired helicopter last night, he went straight to
the home of his wife's family in Crimond.
His father-in-law, Mr Robert Wilken, said: ''He was still wearing his
fishing gear.''
The winning numbers were: 5, 8, 23, 24, 28, 48, bonus 19.
Meanwhile National Lottery organisers are investigating claims that at
least four foreign commercial syndicates are charging overseas players
almost five times the face value of a ticket.
Camelot said yesterday it was concerned the syndicates were damaging
the ''integrity'' of the lottery.

<HEADLINE>Liberal Democrats ready to exploit home rule issue</HEADLINE>

THE Liberal Democrats are poised to exploit any Labour foot-dragging
on the constitution to sell themselves as guarantors of home rule and
leapfrog the Tories as a political force north of the Border, claims
Scottish leader Jim Wallace.
He believes that the final hard-fought negotiations within the
Scottish Constitutional Convention -- over funding and membership of the
proposed Scottish Parliament -- are giving the Liberal Democrats a
strong identity which more than compensates for the seizure by Tony
Blair's New Labour of the middle ground in politics.
Mr Wallace, representing the most remote and scattered constituency in
Britain, took time out in Shetland to tell The Herald why he is bullish
about the party's role in Scottish politics and the niche it has secured
for itself in the future. He envisages:
* The Liberal Democrats exploiting any apparent cooling in Labour's
enthusiasm, particularly in London, for a strong and entrenched Scottish
Parliament and billing themselves as guarantors of home rule.
* The SLD adding two or three seats to its current nine at
Westminster.
* The Conservatives doing better than their current poll ratings but
losing some of their current 10 seats, making Liberal Democrats the main
Opposition to Labour.
He attributes no lack of good faith to his Scottish Labour
counterparts, but believes Labour in London is lukewarm if not
sceptical, citing the reneging on proportional representation for the
Welsh Assembly, scrapping of plans for devolution, and reported doubts
on the funding of the Scottish Parliament.
''No-one looking at Scottish political history can be in any doubt
about the commitment of the SLD to the Scottish Parliament, to home
rule, and if there is any question or uncertainty about whether the
Labour Party under Tony Blair will deliver, then what better guarantee
than to ensure that there are a good number of Scottish Liberal Democrat
MPs backed up by a solid number of SLD votes in the next UK
Parliament?'' he said.
''That, I think, gives us a role that we did not obviously have at the
last General Election.
''I know there are a number of our supporters who felt that when it
came to the home rule and devolution issue there was an element of 'me
too-ism' between ourselves and the Labour Party, who were both members
of the convention.
''I think we have got a role to play here, saying we really need a
strong Liberal Democrat force in the new Parliament to make sure these
things we have negotiated are actually delivered.''

<HEADLINE>Archbishop's attack on Bomb. Veterans angered at VJ-Day service</HEADLINE>

THE Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh angered old soldiers at a
service to commemorate VJ-Day yesterday when he criticised some actions
by the Allies during the Second World War, including the use of the
atomic bomb.
The Most Rev Keith O'Brien made his comments at a service of
remembrance held in the presence of the Princess Royal, Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth, and around 600 war veterans at St Giles
Cathedral in Edinburgh.
The comments which upset many members of the congregation centred on
his views on the destruction of Dresden, the fire bombing of Tokyo, and
the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
He said they were ''seen as simply the most dramatic examples of a
readiness to treat civilians as though they were enemy soldiers''. He
said there were many who looked on Hiroshima and Nagasaki as war crimes.
Afterwards, at a meeting with war veterans, Mr Forsyth defended the
dropping of the atomic bombs. ''If the bomb had not been dropped, many
of the thousands of people who are represented here today would have
lost their lives,'' he said. To applause, he added: ''I hope you realise
that was not in the script.''
Last night, Father Tom Connelly of the Roman Catholic Church of
Scotland supported Archbishop O'Brien and said he admired him for taking
such a bold public stance.
During Archbishop O'Brien's sermon, he described the Far East conflict
as ''the forgotten war'', questioned the morality of having nuclear
weapons, and described Government spending on the Trident system as
''obscene''.
He also mentioned details of a nuclear convoy which passed through
Edinburgh last Wednesday, gave an analytical break-down of the nuclear
capabilities of the Scottish-based HMS Vanguard and said it had enough
fire power to ''evaporate'' 768 Hiroshimas.
Old soldiers leaving the hour-long service were angry at his comments,
although a few did support what they called his ''modern view''.
Merchant seaman Archie Smith, 76, from Glasgow, who was awarded the
Atlantic Star, said Archbishop O'Brien had been ''ill-advised'' to make
his comments.
Mr Smith, who has travelled to Hiroshima to show sympathy to the
Japanese about the bombing, said: ''At the time, the bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki seemed like a blessing to us involved in the war
as it meant the fighting would stop. His opinion has been privately
mentioned by others in some quarters but I believe he was ill advised to
say it today.''
Mr Douglas Lang, past-president of the Burma Star in Aberdeen said
there had been a lot of mixed feelings about the bombing but said he
believed the Archbishop's speech had not gone down well.
Mr Archie Black, 72, from Gretna, who was a private in the Gordon
Highlanders, said he was disgusted by the sermon.
Mr Tom McGowran, 78, secretary of the Scottish Far East Prisoners of
War Association refused to be drawn into the controversy. He said he
believed dropping the atomic bombs actually saved lives in the long
term.
Archbishop O'Brien received support from old soldier John Donnelly,
73, from Kirkcaldy. Mr Donnelly said: ''His is a modern-day view and I
do now believe we should get rid of nuclear weapons. At the time, the
view was that the bomb stopped more bloodshed but since then the
consequences for mankind having the bomb are dire.''
His comments on the Allies involvement during the war came under the
heading, ''How Could They Do It?''. Archbishop O'Brien said: ''As we
reflect on that question directed to the action of the Japanese forces,
so too we must direct it to the Allies, to the American forces, when we
think of the introduction of atomic warfare into our world, our global
village.''
He added: ''There are those who look on Hiroshima and Nagasaki as war
crimes. Along with the destruction of Dresden, the fire bombing of
Tokyo, they are seen as simply the most dramatic examples of a readiness
to treat civilians as though they were enemy soldiers.''
On recompense, he said no amount of money could adequately repay the
lost years of life: ''What they have asked for over the years and do ask
for is to hear the word sorry uttered; to hear that word spoken
sincerely without any excusing clauses by those who have offended.''
Later there were reports of a scuffle outside St Giles' involving
anti-nuclear protesters.
Police said three people had been arrested following an alleged breach
of the peace.
