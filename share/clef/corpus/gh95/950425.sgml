WELL, they did it again. For the third year running, Walt Disney
Studios scooped up a couple of Academy Awards at the tail-end of March.
The precious statuettes were handed over in honour of Best Musical Score
and Best Song from The Lion King. Congratulations, say I.
However, as someone who used to harbour amnbitions of becoming an
animator, and still remains a devotee of the field, I have to confess
that Disney has always got a . . . mixed reaction from me.
That's right. At the risk of sounding blasphemous, and of invoking the
wrath of a hidden horde of Burbank's most ruthless lawyers, this article
will contained negative comments about ol' Uncle Walt. Read on,
Mouseketeers.
First things first. As far as I'm concerned, Mickey Mouse is the most
unappealing cartoon character ever created, and his doggy, ducky cohorts
aren't much better. The theatrical shorts featuring these animals, while
technically flawless, are perhaps some of the least humorous cinema
material ever produced.
It seems inconceivable that while studios such as Warner Bros or MGM
invariably gave up the ghost on their earliest cartoon protagonists in
favour of more finely honed creations, Disney insanely hung on to their
firstborn. More than 50 years on, they still regard this crudely
rendered prototype as the king, despite the fact that they subsequently
created hundreds of celluloid stars more worthy of the title.
Perhaps we should be grateful that these days the soprano rodent is
more often than not used as a logo rather than a performer. With that
said, let's move on to a more positive (and less libellous) point, shall
we?
I do like most of the feature-length productions. Granted, sometimes
they can be a little on the schmaltzy side, but there are some real gems
to be found in the Disney back catalogue. The stylish Sleeping Beauty.
The pure artistry of Fantasia (yes, the mouse is in it. For a bit.
Fastforward). The jazzy Jungle Book and the bizarrely forgotten eighties
films such as The Black Cauldron, buried because it didn't make enough
money for the execs' liking. But they simply don't compare with the
films made since 1990.
The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and, of course, The
Lion King have a vitality about them, a snappy sense of humour and a
willingness to send themselves up and acknowledge their nature -- ie
cartoons, perhaps the best, but nothing more -- that you simply don't
find in the earlier material.
The reason is simple. Under the guidance of directors John Musker, Ron
Clemens, Gary Trousdale, and Kirk Wise, and other artists like them,
Disney the animation machine if not Disney the financial empire has at
last broken free of Disney the man . . .
Anyone who has picked up on the recent hubbub concerning the facts of
Walt Disney's life can't help but come to a realisation of his downright
sinister nature. He was obsessed with realism; so one wonders why he
ever got into animation first instead of live action cinema, especially
when you consider: he was not a competent artist; one of his employees
had to teach him how to sketch a quick Mickey in order to avoid public
embarrassment. He was somewhat right-wing; Disney was part of the same
crazed witch-hunts that nearly destroyed comics (see last month's
feature) in the fifties.
He was willing to condemn trade unionists who spoke out against his
treatment of animators as communists. Net result: his pool of artists
tolerated poor pay and near anonymity for fear of being blackballed by
Hollywood as a whole.
That's why the public remembers one face and one name -- Disney's. He
was a shrewd businessman, a media mogul, a sexist, a racist, a pal of J
Edgar Hoover (conspiracy theory buffs take note), some might say a
monster, others a genius.
Animators are, by and large, not famous people. You rarely see their
faces on screen, and most audience members don't stick around for the
credits after Simba has roared his last.
The thousands of very talented people behind every Disney ''classic''
(how can a film be punted as an ''all-new classic''? Oh well . . .) can
safely walk down the streets of LA mob-free. Walt Disney, by contrast,
is known to children everywhere through cinema, television, video and
audio cassettes, theme parks, and, inevitably, endless merchandise.
Immortality of a sort.
It's tragic that, despite the radical metamorphosis brought about by
today's most adept animators, diametrically opposed films are shelved
side by side. How can Jiminy Cricket's twee ramblings be regarded in the
same light as the Genie's spontaneous outbursts?
It all comes down to the machinations of a long dead American icon.
Hmmm . . . immortality? Perhaps death isn't enough to stop Walt. Today
his conglomeration is chaired by the eerily similar-looking Roy E
Disney.
Somewhere in California, sitting in some cryogenics facility, Walt's
head awaits the day a donor body can be found, allowing him to walk the
earth once more. The big question is: will he have five fingers, or four
. . ?

Hole: Live Through This
ALTHOUGH Live Through This was originally released more than a year
ago, the album was unfortunately overshadowed by some tragic
circumstances. These happened to include the suicide of Nirvana front
man Kurt Cobain, who was the husband of Hole singer/guitarist Courtney
Love. Love's problems continued when her bass player, Kirsten Pfaff,
died last summer of a heroin overdose.
Now that some time has passed since the deaths, the record company has
decided to re-release the album, which is a good thing for everyone.
Surprisingly, Live Through This is a really amazing album. It is not
the punky mess full of talentless thrashings that some expected, and
Courtney Love is certainly no Yoko Ono.
Instead what you get is one of the best angst-ridden grunge rock
albums since (dare I say it?) Nirvana's own Nevermind.
Hole's single Doll Parts is currently skirting around the top 10 and
the re-release of the unfortunately titled album should see it get the
recognition it deserves.
Tricky: Maxinquaye
WHEN you think of rap music you tend to conjure up images of large
American Homeboys hangin' in da 'hood with plenty of gunz, fly honeys
and crack cocaine to sing about.
However Tricky, the newest artist to ''rock the mic'', is just a
depressed young English fella from Bristol.
Maxinquaye is his astonishing debut album and it has just been
released to great acclaim.
The LP is exactly what you would expect from a guy who used to be in
Massive Attack. Subsequently this is a more dance and ambient hip-hop
affair than the aggressive gangster stuff from the streets of Los
Angeles.
While remaining on a dance tip, his drum beats (however loud and
rasping) are kept at a reasonable pace.
Maxinquaye is definitely a brilliant underground, and yes, alternative
album and features the grunge crossover single Black Steel. The album
has deep, crackly, and chillin' beats, bass lines that won't quit, and
lyrics that would make Leonard Cohen shed a tear.
Elastica: Elastica
ELASTICA have been the music media darlings for the past year or so,
yet only now have they got round to releasing an album, which is titled
Elastica.
At its occasional best moments, Elastica could be described as a sad
distant and mutilated cousin of decent guitar pop music. At its worst it
is talentless whingeing.
From the opening chords of Line Up to the relieving closure of
Stutter, there is little let-up from the banality. After the first five
awful songs, the urge to vomit subsides for a few moments during the
first bars of Smile. You even get a chance to think, ''hey, this might
not be so bad''. But then Justine and Co throw in an ''arty'' rhythm
guitar riff or bass solo and you start looking for the sick bag once
more.
These 15 tunes were obviously recorded at the height of Elastica's
press adulation. This is evident in the enormous pretentiousness and
silliness of their incredibly brief songs (15 tracks in 40 minutes, for
God's sake).

THE other day I looked back through the scrapbook of match reports I
wrote when Davie Cooper played for Motherwell. By then, of course, his
magical years at Ibrox were over and he was slowing down. However, his
wondrous skills had not deserted him. Here are some of the comments I
wrote:
* ''Cooper was in captivating and imperious mood.''
* ''The mazy runs of Cooper deserved a more positive outcome.''
* ''Cooper's intricate runs on a slippery surface located him in a
class of his own.''
* ''Cooper flighted the ball hither and thither with unsettling
accuracy.''
* ''His close control was proof that the magnet in his left boot had
lost none of its strength.''
* ''Cooper continued to coax his team with subtle distribution.''
* ''Cooper was now in rampant form. He unleashed a series of masterly
passes and crosses which stretched the Hibs defence beyond endurance.''
I often had Davie Cooper firmly in my mind in recent months when
writing about the emphasis on ball skills which lies behind the SFA's
Children's Development Plan and The Herald Seven-a-Sides (see below). He
was the finest of role models, and was struck down when recording a
video which would have passed on to some of you the secrets of his
exquisite skills. Out there, among you, is the next Davie Cooper. Keep
at it.
Rarely has the football community been so united. They came in their
thousands to pay their respects, including some Celtic supporters who
used to dread his remarkable talents. That was fair play.
Back again with the old chicanery
HERE we go again. The last grand prix season ended in Australia with
Michael Schumacher colliding with Damon Hill, the one driver who could
have deprived him of the world championship. The new season has begun
with both Schumacher and David Coulthard disqualified -- then
reinstated, though their teams have been fined -- for using irregular
fuel in the Brazilian Grand Prix.
Schumacher's Benetton team rarely remains out of the news for long.
Last season alone:
* The German was banned for two races for overtaking in the parade lap
in the British Grand Prix and ignoring a black flag ordering him to
stop.
* He was disqualified because the wooden undertray of his car had been
tampered with and was showing excessive wear.
* Benetton was accused of using an electronic traction control system
in races where it was illegal.
* They were also accused of illegally tampering with their refuelling
rigs to speed up pit stops.
The issue arose after fuel spillage and a spectacular fire during a
pit stop by Schumacher's teammate, Jos Verstappen, in the German Grand
Prix at Hockenheim.
There were clear indications just before the Brazilian Grand Prix that
fuel irregularities might be about to take place. In accordance with the
rules, both Benetton and the Williams team, for which David Coulthard
drives, submitted 120-litre samples before the race for analysis.
Motor racing's governing body, FIA, produces through gas
chromatography a ''fingerprint'' which is compared with another print
taken from the race sample. The two prints should match -- indeed, they
should conform to regular garage petrol.
Both Benetton and Williams failed the test after race practice and
were fined, but went ahead with the grand prix itself.
Damon Hill, Coulthard's teammate, was pleased that Schumacher was
originally disqualified, even if it meant Coulthard suffering the same
fate. Hill saw Schumacher as his main contender for this year's world
title, so what had happened was for the best. There's sportsmanship for
you.
As if all that wasn't enough, they all started squabbling about their
weight. Under a new regulation, the combined weight of car and driver
must not be less than 595k. The drivers are weighed just before the
grand prix season, so if they lose weight thereafter their cars will be
lighter and will go faster.
Official records show that Gerhard Berger's weight increased by 6k
between last season and the Brazilian Grand Prix, of which he was the
eventual winner. Schumacher went up by 8k in the same period, yet an
unexpected test after the Brazilian race indicated a significant drop in
his weight.
Dirty work at the chicane? Not necessarily. When the weight of Berger
and Schumacher was added to that of their cars, it exceeded 595k, so
there was no infringement of the rules. Indeed, in a cockpit where the
temperature can go well beyond 100[DEG]F, dehydration during a race can
be a substantial factor. Yet there were squeals of cheating in a sport
which is now threatening to overtake English football for sleaze.
That was because people expect cheating in grand prix racing. Its face
is pockmarked with the disease of big money. The international
corporations that dominate it will ensure that it always remains so.
Since the cheating is usually of a technical nature, there's not much
you or I can do about it -- except, perhaps, to switch off the TV set in
protest as one monotonous lap follows another in this most tedious of
spectator sports.

CONGRATULATIONS to John Ogilvie High, Hamilton, and Peebles High from
the Borders. They'll contest the final of The Herald Seven-a-Side
competition which will be played immediately before the Scottish Cup
final at Hampden on May 27.
Commiserations to St Bride's High, East Kilbride and Our Lady and St
Patrick's High of Dumbarton, the beaten semi-finalists.
Better luck next year, lads -- and lassies! For the sevens, for
under-12s, are open to boys and girls, and Nicola Conroy scored both St
Pat's goals in their 4-2 defeat by Peebles High. Nicola's strikes came
in an action-packed first half which finished 2-2, with Steven MacLean
also netting twice for Peebles.
Steven repeated his feat in the second half, scoring twice to take his
tally to four in an excellent, highly entertaining match which was
played in the right sporting spirit.
Teams: Our Lady and St Patrick's High: Stephen Murray, Mark Gilligan,
Patrick Kaney, Stephen Storrie, Alan Hogan, David Douglas, Thomas Smith,
Nicola Conroy.
Peebles High: Creag Robertson, Gregor Forsyth, Steven Maclean, Steven
Hague, Andrew Hague, Michael Jack, Ian Dick, Andrew Borthwick.
In the other semi-final John Ogilvie, the bigger team physically,
tended to dominate the play, though a fierce shot by Steven Rouse just
beyond the far post was the closest they came to a goal. In the end it
came down to the dreaded penalty shoot-out, with John Ogilvie eventually
going through by three goals to two.
It was a marvellous occasion for the lads and they conducted
themselves with great credit -- there were only four free kicks in the
whole match and the spirit of sportsmanship was a delight to behold.
Teams: John Ogilvie High: Thomas McGladrigan, Steven Hislop, Alan
Dempsie, Stephen Rouse, Paul Kaczan, Paul Whitley, Kristopher Smith,
Jamie McCarroll.
St Bride's High: Peter Jones, Andrew Cook, Paul Gallagher, Jon
Monteith, Jamie Doyle, Stephen Quinn, Mark McAvoy, Christopher Wilson.

Asked once about the homeless, the Minister of Housing called them
'the sort of people one steps on coming out of the opera'.
STONE Cold, Robert Swindells's powerful novel about homeless young
people in London, was awarded the Library Association's Carnegie Medal
for the outstanding children's book last year.
It tells the story of Link, an unhappy teenager driven out of the
family home in Bradford after the break-up of his parents' marriage and
his mother's relationship with the brutal drunkard Vince, who moves in
and forces Link out.
If anyone has any romantic illusions about sleeping rough in London
they will be destroyed by reading Stone Cold. Link's existence, in
common with that of the other young dossers in search of work whom he
meets on the streets of London, is nightmarish.
Hunger, exhaustion, humiliation, fear, and the numbing pain that comes
from sleeping on concrete-floored doorways are everyday -- and night --
experiences. Robert Swindells has given Link a sensibility which allows
us to feel not only his pain but the pain of those whom he befriends --
and the lost lives they lead.
Link hears about a fellow dosser called Doggy Bag who got the nickname
because he used to hang about cafes, and when a customer left he'd slip
over to their table and drop the scraps in a plastic bag before the
waitress cleared up.
The explanation nearly drives Link to tears: ''What I started thinking
was this. I started thinking about how once, years ago, there was this
baby, and his mum and dad loved him like mums and dads do, and they gave
him a name and dreamed about what he'd be when he grew up and what his
life would be like and all like that, and how they never dreamed he'd be
called Doggy Bag and live on scraps and be so unimportant that he'd
vanish and no-one would care.''
Stone Cold is much more than a story about dossers. It is an extremely
well structured thriller. Doggy Bag vanishes because there's a homicidal
sociopath called Shelter on the loose whose mission is to clean up the
streets and rid London of its down-and-outs.
He stalks his victims, who end up under the floorboards of his home in
Camden, north London, conscripted into his grisly army, the Camden
Horizontals. Will Shelter's and Link's paths cross? Read Stone Cold and
find out.
Robert Swindells, a full-time writer and former teacher who left
school at 15, believes the novelist's first duty is to produce a book
that gives pleasure and keeps children reading. His book is interesting,
gripping, frightening, and achieves its goal.
The BBC has taken the book to establish if it can be made into a film.
One of his earlier novels, Daz 4 Zoe -- set in a two-nations society in
the near future -- is already being dramatised for broadcast by BBC
Scotland.
The author says of Stone Cold: ''I have found that the young people it
is aimed at like it.''
Christopher Aldous, a 15-year-old fourth-year pupil at Mearns Castle
High near Glasgow, is one of the book's many admirers. We asked him what
he would like to ask Robert Swindells about Stone Cold. These are his
questions -- which Mr Swindells found ''very intelligent'' -- and the
author's answers:
* How did you arrive at the title Stone Cold?
My working title was Out of the Opera, for reasons which will become
clear below. However, my editor at Hamish Hamilton rejected it on the
grounds that it would mean nothing to potential readers. I then came up
with Paved with Cold . . . a play on the old saying that the streets of
London are paved with gold. My editor said everyone would think the book
was called Paved with Gold. And so it went on, till we compromised with
Stone Cold, which doesn't seem to have done the book any harm!
* Was there any particular incident which, or person who, moved you to
write Stone Cold?
Yes. When he was asked on one occasion about the homeless, Sir George
Young, Minister of Housing, called them ''the sort of people one steps
on when coming out of the opera''. This struck me as a callous and cruel
remark, particularly coming from a man in his position, and my anger
made me determined to attempt a book for young people which might elicit
a little sympathy and understanding for the plight of homeless
teenagers.
* Who or what was the influence behind the character of Shelter?
Shelter is based on a drill instructor under whom I suffered when I
was an RAF recruit in 1957. I won't name him, because he may have
mellowed into a reasonable human being by this time.
* How realistic a picture do you feel Stone Cold paints of
homelessness?
I believe Stone Cold paints as realistic a picture of homelessness as
anyone who hasn't actually been homeless could manage. It doesn't
mention every bad experience the homeless suffer -- it would be
unreadable if it did -- but I think the reader is left in no doubt that
no sane person would choose such a lifestyle.
* Did you write the book to heighten awareness of the problems faced
by the young homeless or is it just a thriller using homelessness as a
foundation?
I wrote it to heighten awareness. If I had merely set a thriller
against a background of homelessness, I'd be as guilty as my character
Captain Hook of exploiting the plight of the homeless for my own gain.
* How much did you have to research the issue of homelessness?
I read a lot of papers and booklets issued by charities such as
Centrepoint and Shelter, plus a number of analytical newspaper articles.
I also slept out on Camden High Street in north London for three nights,
during which time I talked to a number of homeless youngsters and was
embraced by an old drunk because I gave him 20p. (I hadn't washed or
shaved for a week beforehand and I wore ancient clothes. Nobody
penetrated my disguise.)
* After researching and writing Stone Cold, has your outlook on
homelessness changed?
My outlook on the homeless is the same as it was before I started work
on the book. My hope is that reading Stone Cold might alter other
people's perceptions of homelessness and the homeless.

Life is far from being a soap opera when you are young, broke, and
homeless in Scotland.
LAST November the prime brat of Brookside, Rachel Jordache, and her
sidekick Lee Banks hopped it to London. However little sympathy you may
feel for such a fat-faced, whingeing little monster, the fact remains
that the reality of the runaway situation, both before and after, was
very realistically scripted by Channel 4.
Both Rachel and Lee were at absolute bursting point with a lethal
cocktail of school bullying, family strife, identity crisis, and just
everyday life hassles.
The decision to head for the big city seems logical enough -- less
chance of your granny spotting you and making a 999 call home.
But big cities are grotty if you're young, homeless, and penniless.
Like our soap opera characters, you may well start on the pinball
machine of cheap digs or bed and breakfasts (if you can get anything at
all), fall prey to exploitative sharks looking for ''fresh meat'' to
sell to older men, and lead a lonely, cold existence.
Sometimes people have no choice but to leave home. You're being abused
by a relative, you're at breaking point from absorbing the mess of your
parents' lives -- divorce/alcoholism/debt. Or perhaps you've been in
local authority care, are experiencing unbearable pressure, and just
need to get away. Sometimes you can't define the reasons to yourself;
you've not formulated an explanation but you need to go.
During 1993/94 as many as 1500 young people under 18 in Scotland were
accepted as being homeless by district councils. Another 1300 under 18
were interviewed and regarded as not being homeless or they and the
council lost touch with each other. Five hundred fell into another
administrative category of being under 18, not a priority under the law,
and on the brink of being homeless but not quite.
These Scottish Office statistics are the tip of the iceberg. For the
same year Shelter (Scotland) -- the campaigning organisation for the
homeless -- estimated that 12,000 young people approached their district
council for help.
What responses you get from your district council can depend on how it
chooses to interpret the homeless persons legislation. It shouldn't be
so arbitrary but there's tremendous pressure on council accommodation,
few houses being built, and long waiting lists for decent areas. You
might get offered something but not be able to cope with the sudden
responsibilities and financial pressures.
Robert Aldridge, information officer at the Scottish Council for
Single Homeless, says: ''Everybody leaves home at some stage in their
lives. It's perfectly normal to do so. To be a success it should be
planned and done with the support of your family -- but for people who
do not have a family to help it's much more difficult.
''If you leave home and you're under 16 you're not allowed to set up
home on your own. The new Children's Bill would allow safe refuges to be
set up for young people to leave home.''
This idea of being able to book yourself into a safe, short-term
refuge has met with support from many young people who have previously
run away from home. At the moment, anyone taking in someone under 16 to
live with them would be accused of ''harbouring'' them.
Vicky, now 21, was taken into care when she was 13, and left at 16.
''You want to trust the staff, but mostly they are unapproachable and
just want to get their shift over. I was bullied on my first day and
felt like heading straight back out the door. I think safe refuge would
be excellent, but there would have to be proper counselling, and the
staff running it would need to show you respect.''
Who doesn't need some time out now and again? You may not actually
want to set up home on your own, just some time away to sort out your
problems.
Anne Houston, director of Childline, says: ''Young people are not
running to the bright lights but away from a range of problems -- at
home or at school or wherever. They are picked up and returned home and
the next time they run further away.''
In many ways another insidious pressure which creeps up on you is the
complete lack of cash at an age when you're definitely no longer a child
and hate being dependent on your parents. Perhaps you've left school and
are still at home -- you won't be able to claim Income Support if you're
16 or 17. This in turn can set up a vicious cycle of resentment and
pressure which knocks your confidence at the very time you're trying to
look for a job or get on a course.
One thing is definite -- life isn't a soap opera. Scriptwriters can't
write off too many characters and everything tends to have a nice,
happy, moral ending.
There aren't any easy answers if you're in a bad situation but at
least now young people have been consulted about what they'd like to see
set up and are getting backing from a range of organisations throughout
Scotland.

Our second batch of guest pagemakers offers an array of talents and
original ideas.
SARAH FLOCKHART (S4) captures some of the highlights of Scots Week, an
exploration of Scots language and culture.
AS usual, the bell rings on Monday, March 6, but this isn't any
ordinary Monday at Dumfries Academy. The Scottish flag flies high above
the main building and swarms of pupils have donned tartan trimmings
symbolising the start of Scots Week. So here begins a week of concerts,
storytelling, ceilidhs -- and a general insight into how entertaining
and interesting our culture can be, given the chance.
Monday night was the opening night of Bondagers, the drama production.
I went along, not quite sure what to expect. From the thunderous
applause at the end I can safely say that everyone felt as I did; it was
a huge success, a truly professional and astounding performance by all
involved.
Wednesday evening brought the ceilidh concert with storytellers,
didgeridoos, pupil pieces, and much more. Another magical night that
won't be forgotten. Thursday evening saw the last and indeed the best
performance of Bondagers, which left even the cast in floods of tears.
Though Friday night meant the end of the school week it was by no
means the end of Scots Week. On Saturday night more than 200 people,
young and old, piled into the main hall for our fully-booked Scots Week
ceilidh. There was no shortage of kilted men and hairy knees; spirits
were high and the music was quick. Crowded and hot as it was, the dance
floor was the place to be, and everybody twirled, birled, and jiggled
the night away to the jaunty fiddle music of the Ceilidh Collective
band.
Scots Week -- a quick reminder that being Scots is something to be
proud of; an exploration of our fascinating culture; a real tribute to
Scotland.
A Bondager speaks.
GAIL PRESTON (S5) describes the experience of appearing in Sue
Glover's powerful play Bondagers.
* ''IT can't be tonight! . . . Who's stolen my gloves? . . . I will
never remember all my cues for that scene . . . What do you mean,
backstage now? . . . Oh. I think we're on . . .''
Although Scots Week began for most of the school on March 6, the case
of Sue Glover's play Bondagers had been preparing for opening night
since mid-January. Compared to the vast numbers normally roped in to act
in a school production our cast of just six, including myself, was
minute -- which meant that we had to work even harder.
The play, centred around the lives of six very different women on a
Borders farm in the nineteenth century, was particularly challenging
from the acting point of view. It was once said by Ian Watt (in The Rise
of the Novel) that ''The characters . . . can only be individualised if
they are set in a particular time and place'', and for the first time
since I read that quote I found the bold statement to be true. Our
characters lived in a society and circumstances so far removed from our
own that it was only, for me at least, after several rehearsals that I
felt any sparks of affinity with my character Maggie -- a woman more
than twice my age, with eight children -- building up inside me.
Fortunately, these moments gradually increased in number, until that
nineteenth-century farm servant began to inhabit a schoolgirl of 1995.
Naturally, this progression was not solely due to lovey-esque
devotion. Several factors helped immensely. First was the influence of
our director, Julie Smith, who never gave up hope, and also through
interaction with the rest of the characters, portrayed by a cast who
(despite momentary losses of faith) were both talented and dedicated.
The more technical aspects also had an excellent effect. The layers of
cotton petticoats and rough woollen skirts along with huge boots were as
close to the Bondagers costumes as possible, and really did help to
induce a feeling of permanent exhaustion. The set and props, a mass of
hay, earth and genuine period farm tools, not only looked impressive to
cast and audience alike but, along with lighting, created the different
working environments and atmospheres to maximum effect.
We were all more than a little apprehensive on opening night, still
unsure of whether the weeks of line-learning, rehearsing, the odd frayed
temper, and frequent smiles would all pay off in the end. It really is
impossible for me to comment too precisely on the performance from my
own point of view, but so much of the play felt right -- from the
opening action to the poignant lament of our lost relationship with the
land which concluded the play. Both the adrenalin and the presence of a
receptive audience made sure that the performance contained far more
energy, focus, and intensity than we had ever imagined during the
rehearsal period.
It is perhaps easiest for me to evaluate the success of our play by
listening to the comments of the friends and strangers who watched it --
all of which have been more than favourable. Some simply stated their
amazement at the quality of the production (I chose to take this
amazement as a compliment), even requesting that we do it all over
again.
And I must agree with these sentiments, because when an elderly lady
I'd never even seen before stopped me in the street and told me that our
performance really had captured the feelings of the border farms, I knew
that what we'd done had worked. This personal satisfaction coupled with
the historical and social knowledge we gained mean that Bondagers is
something that will always remain part of me.
The 'lost' tongue
Susan Findlay (S4) argues that language and nationhood are closely
linked.
Bonnie broukit bairn, for weel ye ken, the licht that bends owre a
thing, sae snod an' cool . . .
* CONFUSED? Yes, so was I when our English teacher, Mr Pow, started to
slever on about the various poems he had just read to us in Scots.
''Discuss them,'' he said. Discuss them, I thought. It might help if
we knew what he was talking about first.
Isn't it ridiculous to think that before we could discuss a particular
part of our Scottish culture we had to refer to a Scots dictionary to
find out what half the words of the poems we had just read meant? But
this is a fact. Our native language has been taken from our use and
understanding so much that in today's English classrooms Scottish
students need dictionaries to translate literature written in their own
language.
When someone asks us what our native language is, we answer, without
much thought, English.
But why is it that, on holiday, we Scots are the first ones to state
that we are not English? Whether this is due to us not wanting to get
bricks thrown through our apartment windows, or our towels stolen by the
poolside, I feel that saying we speak English but are true Scots is a
bit hypocritical.
I believe that if we are true Scottish people we must act in a true
Scottish manner, and to do this we must restore our mother tongue.
When Billy Kay, an experienced promoter of Scots, came to talk to our
school on the Scottish tongue, he heightened our awareness of its death
and made me, personally, more aware of how our job in the future must be
to encourage the re-establishment of our language in schools,
work-places, and homes all over Scotland and tell others just how
powerful a language our country had -- and has unfortunately lost
because of changes in society's attitudes.
I believe that before thousands more people are taught the languages
of foreign countries like Germany or France, we should concentrate on
learning how to speak the ''lingo'' of our own country and start to
build Scotland into the independent nation -- with its own language,
culture, and industry -- that it is capable of being.
Priceless art of the storyteller
* A QUESTION often asked is whether or not television is influential
on a child. The answer is yes. Television doesn't invite interaction. If
anything, it avoids it. Most people hate to be interrupted when watching
TV. It is an antisocial, electronic mechanism that can destroy
relationships. For an alternative form of entertainment and
communicative enjoyment, try storytelling.
The world of storytelling is a magical one that captivates audiences
and forces the use of one's imagination. By telling a story one invites
a conversation.
Reruns -- as on TV -- are non-existent in storytelling. No two stories
are ever the same.
On television, imagination is not used because the characters and
scenes are already created in detail. The storyteller is careful not to
be overly descriptive so that the audience can see the characters and
places in any way they desire.
A story is for everyone, no matter how young, old, rich, poor, bright,
or ignorant. A story only takes a little imagination and a lot of heart.
Next time you sit down in front of the TV, pull yourself away. Share
with a friend or family member a treasure -- the gift of communication.
Still not convinced that storytelling has more to offer than
television? Let's look at prices. A decent television costs around #200
and a good story costs nothing. Stories are free, not because they are
worthless but because they are priceless.
MEGHAN VAN HORNE (S4)
TIME FOR CHANGE
The case for independence is put by Ruth Winter and Laura Saddington.
* INDEPENDENCE is not about isolating ourselves from the English. It
is about recognising the social and economic decline of our nation, and
tackling it. Scotland and England will be brought closer together
through an equal partnership, making us, in Alex Salmond's words,
''friendly neighbours rather than surly lodgers''.
Scotland is bursting with culture, has its own language, and is rich
in history. It has, however, been oppressed throughout the present
Conservative Government.
Scotland has the resources and the mandate from its people to govern
itself. One-fifth more is spent per head on the English at the expense
of the Scots. How can the Conservatives justify this while the Scots are
suffering from all-time high unemployment?
We are having to watch the economic death of towns such as Sanquhar.
Can the Conservative Government justify the closure of Ravenscraig and
Rosyth? Can the Government do this to Scottish families, to the Scottish
work-force? The answer, unfortunately, is yes, it can.
The Government can spend one-fifth of its national budget on quangos.
It can try out the poll tax on Scotland. It can close work-places in
Scotland and introduce water privatisation, all with no Scottish
consensus. Less than 30% of Scots want the Tories. This has to count for
something. They have no mandate to be governing Scotland.
The argument for devolution promises little improvement. Keir Hardie
made a speech for devolution in 1908 and the Labour Party has been in
power twice since then with no Scottish assembly forthcoming. Devolution
has been set up by Labour in an effort to save the union. It is clearly
a vote-winning exercise.
Labour has a stronghold in Scotland and it is unlikely it could win an
election in the UK without it. By granting a devolved assembly
Westminster will be creating conflict all the way -- without the SNP
taking a stance of independence.
The assembly will have no power over VAT on fuel -- Scotland is one of
the most energy-rich countries in northern Europe and yet it has the
highest frequency of cold-related deaths.
It will not have the power to rid itself of the nuclear weapons
surrounding its seas, which are a constant threat to its people. In
effect the Scottish assembly will have no real powers at all, no voice
in Europe, no internal power in Scotland. The Scottish assembly will
just be a talking shop, set up to appease the Scots. It will be a faade
while Westminster will continue to make important decisions for
Scotland.
We believe that devolution will be a bureaucratic nightmare with
increased administration costs. This money could be better placed
elsewhere -- in Scottish housing, for example.
The SNP would destroy Trident and bring work to the 16 and 17 year
olds who face at present only a future of unemployment. It would abolish
the quangos, which make a mockery of British democracy. It would give
Scotland a voice in Europe.
Scottish independence is the way forward for Scotland whether via the
wasteful and frustrating path of devolution or straight to independence.
It is for the Scottish people to decide, but with four-fifths of the
Scottish people wanting some change the swing away from the status quo
is inevitable.

Whales are the eighth wonder of the world, 10 times as old as man,
with the largest brains ever created. And we are killing them in their
thousands every year. Jennifer MacPhail, a 4th year pupil at Eastwood
High School in Newton Mearns, Glasgow, makes an eloquent plea for an end
to the slaughter before it's too late.
FROM space, the planet is blue. It is not the territory of humans but
of the whale. The blue seas covering seven-tenths of the earth's surface
are the domain of the largest brain ever created with a
50-million-year-old smile.
These ancient mammals left the land either in search of food or safety
and walked into the water. Their arms changed into water-wings and their
tails into boomerang-shaped tail-flukes so they could fly, weightlessly,
through the oceans.
At last they were free. Free from droughts, earthquakes, ice ages,
volcanoes, and famine. They had used their brains, which were larger and
10 times as old as man's. We massacre thousands of them every year.
Whales start like us, in the womb. They play three times as long as
they spend searching for food, subtle and involved games with floating
seabirds' feathers blown high into the air and logs of wood flipped from
the top of their heads and carried in their teeth -- play without goals.
Games of tag are played that cover the entire Pacific Ocean.
Whales are the gentle giants of the sea with a naked, oily, silk skin,
as smooth as glass. They travel at 50 miles an hour with faultless
streamlining, no drag or turbulence, with a velvet energy.
These graceful animals don't work to eat. They play to eat and can go
for eight months without food. They're not compulsive eaters. The
humpback catches its food by blowing bubbles, 5ft wide, as big as
weather balloons. These bubbles burst making a circle of confusing mist
and the plankton, Arctic shrimps, krill, and sea butterflies are scared
into the middle by the bewildering ring of hissing bubble-bombs. He then
rises and eats.
After dinner, music. Music that carries for miles, a siren's song
leading sailors to believe that their vessels are haunted by the spirits
of the deep. Webs of this elegant, aquatic music stretch around the
globe forming a kind of bio-radio that transmits an oral tradition of
submarine songs from a living memory bank founded 50 million years ago.
They speak with different dialects, themes, clusters of notes,
sequences, phrases, all sung with different tempos to send messages to
individuals. Different songs from day to day, from year to year. An
indication that there are creatures other than man still evolving.
Millions of mysterious sounds are memorised and passed on from
generation to generation, all clearly retained in the mind, uncluttered
by cuneiform tablets, vellum-paper, newsprint, and floppy disks.
The whale's whole body, every bone, membrane, and hollow, is part of
an enormous ear, 20 times as sensitive as man's. Their families and
tribes all have different songs, acoustic picture-languages, spirited
pulses relayed through water at five times the speed of sound through
air. It is varied enough to express complex emotions, cultural details,
history, news, and a sense of the unknown.
A humpback can put on a solo concert lasting for days in which are a
million bytes, a million changes of frequency, and a million tonal
twists. An odyssey the length of Homer's and packed with as much
information can be told in 30 minutes. Fifty-million-year-old sagas of
continuous whale dreams, accumulated knowledge of the past, rumours of
ancestors, the Archaeoceti with life-spans of 200 or 300 years.
Because of us, the blue whale is nearing extinction. We can do this to
a mammal 100ft long and weighing 170 tons -- the weight of 2700 people.
Its tongue is 10ft thick and heavier than an elephant. Even with seven
stomachs, arteries you could swim through, a half-ton heart, eight tons
of blood, seven-gallon testicles, eating a million calories a day,
having as many living cells as there are people in the world, and living
for 120 years. The dark blue nucleus in the transparent plasma of the
sea is nearly wiped out.
The whale is the eighth wonder of the world. It now and again utters
an ominous whistle of 188 decibels, louder than the Concorde. Man has
decided that the whale is an essential component of an expanding
economy. We do not see the whales as the beautiful animals they are but
as a commodity. The whalers have no idea of the pain and suffering of
the whales.
When an underwater shape is detected on the submarine radar, catcher
boats are despatched from the factory ship and the harpoon on the raised
foredeck is manned and swivelled in the direction of the whale. When the
doomed creature comes within range the ship's engine is slowed down and
then silenced. With an accurate shot landing between the
shoulder-blades, a 5ft long harpoon with a time-fused charge explodes
its way into the whale's flesh. Next to the grenade, four barbed flanges
pivot on hinges and as the whale struggles the strain on the rope snaps
the barbs open, flying into the lungs and inner organs, embedding the
harpoon inside the whale and anchoring it to death's door.
The whale goes into a death roll with its jaws clashing together,
panting, flurrying, and spurting blood through its blow-hole, rasping.
Its tail thrashes the surface strenuously, heaving at the 6in nylon
line.
Twenty minutes pass and the whale's ribs become too heavy to move, the
rib muscles give up their strength, the airways collapse to admit a rush
of sea-water to flood the punctured lungs. It suffocates and goes to
whale heaven while its body slowly revolves in the water to leave the
white belly exposed.
It is no big deal to the whalers as a hollow lance attached to an
air-line is fired into the upturned stomach, feeding compressed air into
the corpse to inflate it and keep it afloat. An identifying flag with a
radar reflector and the catcher's boat's number is lobbed into it. It is
left to drift, rimmed with oil-slick and blood. With no enemies in the
sea, the whale is slow to believe in attack.
The factory ship hauls it in and it is inched up a slope on to the
flensing deck where it is sliced into with knives, ripped by winches,
and stuffed through manholes to be carved up by whirring blades. The
skull, jaw bones, rib, spine, and pelvis are dismembered with chain-saws
on deck. From a pregnant whale the unborn is dragged into meat-boilers
with huge hooks slung into its blowhole. This floating factory has just
exchanged 20,000 gallons of petrol for 20,000 gallons of animal oil.
Civilisation was built on the back of the whale and shore stations
near whaling grounds became cities like Boston, New York, Plymouth,
Tokyo, Dundee, San Francisco, Sydney, Lisbon, Liverpool, Philadelphia,
Hamburg, even London and Glasgow. We are plugged into the corpse of the
whale, growing larger by its light. The whale's insulating wet-suits are
hacked off in flensing ships in untold billions for fuel, lamps,
candlewax, lighting, watch springs, umbrellas, toys, and upholstery.
Millions have died in a marine holocaust generating the human appetite
for electricity, petrol and plastic, soap, margarine, lipstick for the
idle fantasy world of beauticians, detergents, nitro-glycerine to blow a
hole in the human herd, riding crops, wax crayons, buttons, inks, shoes,
paint, skin cream, iodine, dog and cat food, fish bait, whale-meat
stews, anti-freeze, hair treatments, shoe polish, and machine oil to
name but a few. With today's technology, can we not produce all these
without the killing of whales?
The killing continues of the largest creatures in the world. As large
creatures disappear, life becomes smaller. Blind dwarfs on top of the
corpses of slaughtered giants -- gentle, visionary giants that are fully
appreciated when dead and unreal. First, the Greenland whales . . .
eliminated. Then the right whales, so-called because they were
considered the ''right'' whales to kill, then the humpbacks, great
sperm, blue, brydes, Tasman, gray, fin, piked, sei, minkes, and the
pilots reduced to a precious few. And now the smallest whale, the
dolphin, the spinners, blackchins, helmets, snubfins, duskies,
bottle-nosed, bridled, spotted, melon-heads, Risso, whitebeaks, piebald,
Irrawaddy, Amazon, and the hour-glass. Two hundred and fifty a year are
netted and killed.
Orion boasted that he would kill all the animals in the world, yet the
earth sent a monstrous scorpion to sting him in Greek mythology. But
what is happening to the whales is no myth. They are the marine
intelligence with the knowledge of the deep. We must remember, from
space our planet is blue -- not the territory of humans, but of the
whale.
* POSTSCRIPT: Norway has resisted international pressure to stop
hunting the minke whale. The fear is that, if Norway were given IWC
approval for commercial whaling, however limited, Norway would extend
its catch to other species of whales; Japan, an IWC member, would also
take up commercial whaling; other non-member countries such as Iceland
and Taiwan would follow suit; and before too long quotas would creep up
to threaten once again the survival of many species of whales.
WHALE FACTS
* The whale is a mammal 100ft long weighing 170 tons -- the weight of
2700 people.

THERE was a tide in the affairs of men. One man, at least. One man, by
a riverbank, with a brown paper bag in his hand containing a bottle of
meths. One man wearing a moth-eaten and ragged dirty coat, covered with
a patina of antique grease. One man who was a millionaire.
This man had no name, at least not one that he could remember. His
mind was being more and more destroyed by the spirits every day. In
fact, his memory was like . . . one of those things you put food in and
shake it and the stuff you don't want comes out of the bottom. What was
it called? A . . . em . . . colander? No, no . . . a tea-strainer? No,
not that either. A sieve, that was it.
The bottle looked up invitingly at the tramp. He took one last longing
look at it, had a final hopeful swig, and threw the bottle into the
river. He got up from the riverbank and wandered into town.
The old man lurched down the street, passing by the windows of shops
that, once upon a time, he had been able to own. But now he had but a
few scant millions to his name, and that level of poverty meant he could
scarce afford to pay the entrance fee that some shops charged.
As he wandered past an electrical store, he paused to examine the news
on the television in the window. A hologram was reading the news. No
real people did any work these days. Nobody needed a regular wage.
''Good evening,'' said the hologram. ''Today is the 22nd of February,
2010. These are the headlines . . .
''President Branson has confirmed that Britain will be sending famine
relief to the drought-ridden Republic of California. The US has stated
that although President Clinton is concerned, she has not committed
herself to a course of action yet.
''The final shares in the Great Britain Government will be sold off
today. Ex-Prime Minister George Graham is said to be disgusted at what
he calls 'The fact that the people are running their own country'.
''Other news: the Simpson Foundation has discovered a possible vaccine
for the new super-strain of the smallpox virus, and tonight's National
Lottery prize has been estimated at #8.6 billion.
''You're watching Groovy Funky Channel 27. Stay tuned for tonight's
episode of Brookside, where Lord Lucan is discovered under the
Jordaches' patio.''
Eight point six billion pounds. The filthy old codger laughed, his
wrinkled face creasing in appreciation of an irony that, in this
obsessed world, only he could understand. Oh yes, he could remember a
time when that old cripple Branson was a poxy little millionaire too.
That was back before the rise of the second British Empire, of course.
Back before Prime Minister Portillo made one of his more conspicuous
errors and ordered a military invasion of the rest of Europe, thereby
paving the way for Richard Branson to become President.
Now the lottery was number one in people's lives. Most average
families were multi-multi-trillionaires, thanks to the daily lottery.
People had become so demanding of money that Branson had ordered more
and more cash to be pumped into circulation, thus destroying much of the
world's economy.
The old reject sighed and wiped a furtive tear from his red
bespectacled eyes. He turned and walked into a bar. The bar was full of
young trendies, who all turned around and looked in disgust at the
pungent old tramp. There was some old nineties music playing in the bar.
REM, guessed the man as he wandered over to the counter.
''What'll it be, old man?'' asked the barman, an immaculately dressed
young man with a trainee moustache and a gold ring through his lip.
''Gl . . . Glenlivet,'' stuttered the old man.
The barman grinned as he opened a bottle of fine Scotch single malt
whisky, and poured the old man a dram.
''There you are, mate,'' said the barman. He looked around shadily,
licked his lips, leaned forward, and added, ''look, I can see you don't
have much in the way of cash. Tell you what, I'll only charge you eight
million pounds for the whisky.''
The crumbly old tramp's face fell like the Roman Empire.
''I . . . only have three million on me,'' he said.
The barman frowned, thought for a moment and finally cracked.
''Okay, I'll take that,'' he growled, ''but don't anybody ever say I
don't do my part for the poor.''
The man sighed with relief as he downed the whisky. In the background,
Michael Stipe crooned along on CD.
''It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine . . .''
Dead right, thought the tramp as he stumbled out into the chill night
air.
The liquor brought ghosts of shattered memories back to the ancient
man. Yes, he had been famous and important once, although something in
his subconscious suggested that he was not particularly well liked. Then
it all flashed back to him . . . the Government; Northern Ireland; the
Criminal Justice Bill; the lottery, his name . . .
He fell into a drunken stupor, but before he did, one of the old
prophecies of Nostradamus floated through his head. ''. . . A pearled
isle will give birth to a leader, a man of the circus, and he shall
destroy a nation.''
Dead right again, thought John Major, before he slipped out of this
hell of his own construction into merciful sleep; away from the demons
of the present and the terrible ghosts of the past.

As part of the recent set95 national, seven-day celebration of
science, engineering, and technology, Glasgow University invited schools
to send in science questions on fax and by e-mail. Dr Graham Durant, who
organised the university's Science Week projects, Lizanne McKerrill,
head administrator of the event, and Jeff Liston, who worked with them,
were impressed by the questions, which were answered by academics at
Glasgow through the university's Science Journalism Society. We were
also impressed by the questions, so we decided to publish a selection.
Be impressed -- and informed!
WHAT started the big bang? (Alexander Arthur, aged 7)
It started as an incredibly small, and fantastically hot,
concentration of the whole mass of the universe in the form of pure
energy -- something like light. This happened about 10,000 million years
ago. This ''point'' exploded outwards, cooling down until eventually the
energy, or most of it, turned into matter -- a bit like water droplets
condensing out of steam from a boiling kettle as it hits the air and
cools. This matter then collapsed under its own gravity to form into
galaxies, then stars, then planets, and even people!
What makes the rainbow so bold, and how does it get its shape?
(Gleniffer High, Paisley)
As the heavy cloud begins to lift after a rainstorm, sunlight comes in
through a break in the storm clouds. Because a lot of light is still
being blocked off by the clouds, the area is still dark, but now the
sunlight is penetrating through to raindrops in the air. When the white
sunlight hits the raindrops it is split into the spectrum of its seven
visible colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) in a
circular band. This band can be seen only from the air, so it looks to
us on the ground as a bow, or arc.
If butterflies don't eat, how long can they survive? (Laurel Bank
School, Glasgow)
All butterflies have mouth parts and can feed. A typical life pattern
for a British butterfly such as a small tortoiseshell is to hatch in
September, hibernate in its juvenile stage over winter, and emerge as an
adult in the spring. It then feeds for several weeks, reproduces, and
dies in the summer.
How was the Soviet space station Mir taken into space and assembled?
(Amy McElroy, 9, Glasgow)
It was taken up in pieces using Russian Proton launchers. The core
module was taken up in 1986. The space station is growing all the time
as more units are taken into space. It orbits between 300km to 400km
above earth and each orbit takes about 90 minutes. A Russian cosmonaut,
52-year-old Valery Polyakov, recently returned after 438 days in space
-- the time it would take to get to Mars and back.
Why is mercury a liquid? (Langholm Academy)
Mercury is liquid at the temperatures and pressures we are familiar
with. It solidifies at -38.3[DEG] Celsius to a solid metal which is
malleable and ductile. Other metals would be liquid if the temperature
were high enough.
How do hypnotic trances work? (Robert Gibney, Trinity High, Renfrew)
Hypnosis is a passive state of mind induced artificially without the
use of drugs, during which the subject shows increased obedience to
suggestions or commands. The hypnotic state (trance) is brought about in
susceptible subjects by placing them in a quiet environment at rest.
They are asked to concentrate on a monotonous stimulus while listening
to the voice of the hypnotist, who talks quietly and insistently. About
15% of people cannot be hypnotised while one person in 20 is
exceptionally prone to hypnosis.
How do broken bones heal? (Karen McGowan, Trinity High)
Since bone is an active, living tissue it can usually mend itself
after a crack or break. The gap is bridged first by fibre-like material
to form a scar or callus. Then bone-making cells, osteoblasts, gradually
move into the callus and harden it into true bone. This is usually a
little lumpy around the edges so bone-destroying cells, osteoclasts,
sculpt the bumps to produce a smooth mend. Some broken bones need a
helping hand to steady them while the parts knit back together, which is
why we have plasters and metal pins.
Which came first, the egg or the chicken? (Kevin Huxter, Trinity High)
The egg. We have fossil evidence of the existence of eggs many
millions of years before the evolution of chickens. The evolution of
eggs allowed amphibians gradually to evolve into reptiles and breed away
from water. Dinosaurs laid eggs and birds evolved from theropod
dinosaurs. The first true chicken would, however, have hatched from an
egg laid by a close evolutionary ancestor.
Why is the Equator the hottest part of the world? (Kevin Huxter,
Trinity High)
This is where the sun comes closest to the earth and the sun's rays
meet the earth straight on. This means that the sun's rays
pass through less of the atmosphere before meeting the earth's
surface. The hottest recorded temperature was taken at al'Aziziyah close
to the Sahara in southern Libya (58[DEG]C in the shade). This is not on
the Equator so other factors must be important too.
Why do stars twinkle? (James McIntyre, Trinity High)
Because of the effect of the air through which the starlight passes.
Although at source they are very bright, they are a long way away from
us. The 6000 or so stars which are visible to the naked eye are many
light years away from our solar system. Alpha Centauri is the closest --
25.842 million million miles away! The light from a star passes into the
earth's atmosphere after an incredibly long journey and is distorted by
atmospheric effects. Stars seen from a space rocket would not twinkle.
How come men go bald, and women don't? (Chris Grieves, Trinity High)
Some men have an inherited gene secreted by the sex organs and when
this gene is activated at puberty the endrogen level goes up, causing
scalp baldness. Women do not have this inherited gene and therefore have
much lower levels of the hormone endrogen. Some women can become bald
due to alopecia.
When you are on a moving train and you jump, why do you land on the
same spot, instead of the floor rushing underneath you? (Paul Dalbeck,
Trinity High)
When you jump you still have the same forward speed that you had when
you were standing on the floor. The train may be moving at 60mph but so
are you. In fact, with no windows there is absolutely no way to tell how
fast you are moving. This is the relativity principle, one of the most
important in science.
Where would you end up in a black hole? (Walter Craig, Drumley House
School, Ayrshire)
If you were to fall towards a black hole, the strong gravity would
pull you into spaghetti-like strings long before you reached the edge of
the hole. But just say you survived: if you crossed the edge of the hole
you would never be able to leave or send a message out. Some people have
suggested that you could end up in some other universe. Since nobody
could ever come back to tell us about it, it's hard to find out if this
is true.
How do the waves in a microwave heat food? (Kristopher McCall, Drumley
House School)
A magnetron produces a beam of microwaves which have heating power.
The microwave radiation excites the water molecules in the food,
releasing energy, which cooks from the inside out.
Why do we yawn? (Barry Reid, Drumley House School)
One theory suggests that we yawn as part of a signal to other members
of our social group that it is time to sleep. In early social groups it
was advantageous to sleep at the same time to avoid waking each other
up. Hence we yawn and the yawning spreads through the group until we are
all tired and go to sleep.
Why is the sun so hot? Ryan McConechy (Drumley House School)
Because the hydrogen atoms which make up the sun are undergoing
nuclear fusion. The temperature inside the sun is about 15,000,000[DEG]
Celsius. The surface of the sun is cooler, a mere 5000[DEG].
What colour were Adam and Eve, the first people on earth? (Golspie
High, Sutherland)
The best evidence we have indicates that hominids evolved in Africa
and hence would have had dark-pigmented skin to protect against
ultra-violet light damage. There is no evidence to indicate that the
first hominids were white. Fossil skeletons do not allow us to work out
skin colour, so we have to use analogy to deduce colour. We can assume
that the climate in Africa at the time of the evolution of the first
hominids was similar to that of today, hence pigmented skins would have
been a distinct advantage. Light skins would have evolved during the
progressive northward migrations. White supremacists do not like this
view of human evolution. Depending on your religious beliefs, Adam and
Eve can be regarded as fictional characters and could be any colour you
want them to be.
How old are the earth and our solar system? (St Maurice's High,
Cumbernauld)
The solar system would have started to form just before the earth,
which is about 4600 million years old.
How long does the solar system have left and how will it end? (St
Maurice's High)
About another 5000 million years. The sun's nuclear fuel will run out
about this time and the sun will swell up to turn into a red giant star.
It will become so large that its surface will actually reach earth,
which will be destroyed.
What is happening to the ozone layer, and what will be the
consequences of damaging it? (St Maurice's High)
Man-made chemicals are destroying ozone by a complicated series of
chemical reactions. The discovery of the loss of ozone above Antartica
was made in 1985. The ozone hole is still increasing in spite of the
worldwide ban in the use of chloro-fluoro carbons, one of the most
damaging groups of chemicals used as propellants in aerosols. The
consequences of losing ozone from the atmosphere are that more
ultra-violet light will reach the earth's surface, causing skin cancers
and other problems.
How can you have dry ice? (St Maurice's High)
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When water-ice is warmed up it melts
to liquid water. When liquid water is warmed up it turns to water
vapour. When carbon-dioxide ice is warmed up it turns straight from a
solid to a vapour, missing out the liquid phase -- hence the name dry
ice.

A QUESTION mark loomed over the future of Rangers striker Ally McCoist
after he missed a warm-up game against Queen of the South on Sunday and
yesterday the concerns became even more worrying when it was learned
that McCoist will visit London for specialist treatment this week for
treatment to a recurring ankle injury.
After the latest breakdown the Ibrox management have decided that
McCoist must attend the London Clinic -- the top hospital in treating
this type of injury -- and attempt to clear up the problem.
Yesterday assistant manager Archie Knox said: ''All we want to do is
find out what is wrong with the player's ankle. It has nothing to do
with any other injuries he has had in the past.
''What we have here is an ankle injury which the player picked up in a
game against Dundee United. He has attempted to come back before and had
problems.
''At Queen of the South he felt the pain again and now we want to get
to the root of the problem. Now that he is going to London, we will
learn what is wrong with him.''
The real problem for Rangers, however, are the problems which have
endangered the career of the striker in recent times.
He broke a leg playing for Scotland two years ago in Lisbon in a World
Cup qualifier which we lost by 5-0 and since has been plagued by
injuries.
He did return to the Ibrox pantheon of greats with a spectacular goal
in the 2-1 victory over Hibs in the 1993 League Cup Final -- a strike
which added to his legendary status although his appearances for the
champions have been severely limited since.
He has been plagued by host of injuries and last season scored only
seven goals from sixteen premier division appearances.
This year it has been worse. He broke down pre-season in Germany with
a calf knock which took until the start of the season to show signs of
recovery -- and then, in the first game of the season, against
Motherwell, he was stretchered off.
There have been various suggestions since that a recovery was on the
way. He scored against Aberdeen, for instance, in an important league
match last November -- the only goal he has scored this season.
He was injured when he attempted a comeback against Dundee United at
Ibrox in February. He appeared as a substitute but went off again after
a collision -- within minutes of his appearance -- with Kelham O'Hanlon
left him with his present injury.
Since then there have been various suggestions that a comeback was on
schedule. A return in the reserves has been intimated, but, like the
Queen of the South game, McCoist has not made an appearance.
Now, the Ibrox back-room staff will be hoping that the injury
nightmare which has dogged the striker for two years is near an end.
McCoist has always remained confident that the succession of injuries
will not affect his long-term career. He shares the view of fellow Ibrox
striker, Mark Hateley, that the injuries which have affected him will,
in the end, extend his playing career.
This week's examination will tell.

ERIC Cantona is expected to make a decision today whether to stay with
Manchester United or move back to mainland Europe.
The Frenchman's agent and lawyer Jean-Jacques Bertrand is meeting Old
Trafford chairman Martin Edwards for a second round of contract talks.
Edwards and manager Alex Ferguson already have indicated they want
Cantona to remain at the club, even though his worldwide ban does not
end until September 30.
It is understood that Inter-Milan have first claim on him should talks
break down.
The Italians are also prepared to double his money.
But cash has never been an issue for Cantona.
His main concern is the reception he will get from rival fans after
his infamous kung fu attack on a Crystal Palace supporter.
United, however, believe Cantona is beginning to warm to the idea of
continuing his career in England after being overwhelmed at the response
he has had doing community service.

LEEDS United manager Howard Wilkinson yesterday insisted that midfield
player Gary McAllister will be staying at Elland Road, despite renewed
speculation linking him with a move to Rangers.
Leeds turned down a #2.5m offer from the Scottish champions for their
captain earlier in the season.
Wilkinson said: ''The new reports linking Gary with Rangers don't
surprise me because every time he turns up for international duty with
Scotland these stories surface.
''It is well recorded that Rangers approached us some time ago with an
offer, which we turned down. Nothing has happened on the matter since.
''Gary has made it clear in the past that he intends to stay with us
and that is all there is to it.''
McAllister, who joined up with the Scotland squad at the weekend for
tomorrow's European championship match in San Marino, is under contract
with Leeds until the summer of 1999.

THE brewer Tennent-Caledonian, who already sponsor soccer's Scottish
Cup, would be happy to make it a footballing double with backing for the
new Scottish rugby cup competition if negotiations with the Scottish
Rugby Union could be concluded to the satisfaction of both parties.
Rugby in Scotland is on the verge of a major upheaval with
restructured leagues and a knockout cup competition set to get under way
next season.
The new league structure, with the top 32 teams playing in four
eight-club divisions, will provide cut-throat competition from the
opening day of the season.
However, the attractions of a cup competition, with finals day at
Murrayfield turned into a jamboree occasion, have obvious attractions
for potential sponsors.
At the weekend SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said that there had been
great commercial interest in the cup with as many as 10 firms currently
expressing a desire to become involved.
Yesterday, Tennents marketing director Mark Hunter said that his
organisation had never made any secret of the fact that they were
attracted to the exposure which their backing for a Scottish rugby cup
competition would provide.
''We have said in the past that if there was a rugby cup coming along
then we would speak to the relevant authorities about it.''

San Marino
JOHN McGinlay and Duncan Shearer, who grew up together in the village
of Caol, near Fort William, will be charged with the responsibility of
applying the finishing touches to Pat Nevin and Gary McAllister's work
here tomorrow night.
If they do so efficiently Scotland will leave the Italian republic
significantly closer to a place in next summer's European Championshp
finals.
Scotland's manager, Craig Brown, referred to them on arrival in San
Marino yesterday as his ''Highland strike force'' and spoke of them in
glowing terms, neglecting to point out that one plays in the Endsleigh
League and the other appears destined for at least a season in the
Scottish first division.
McGinlay's Bolton Wanderers are striving but not yet among the elite
south of the Border, while Aberdeen and Shearer are struggling to avoid
the dreadful prospect of relegation from the premier division.
Loyalty, however, is a fundamental in Brown's life and he believes
both strikers are the type to damage San Marino.
''They have a good rapport and they are totally committed to the
cause,'' said Brown, who also stressed that he would not forsake Shearer
if the Pittodrie side are sucked down by the relegation quicksands.
''First, Aberdeen have not been relegated, but even if they are
Shearer would not be eliminated from my squad. There is only one
question I would ask: Can he still score goals? That's all that matter.
Service to the front two is expected to be supplied by Nevin. The
31-year-old plays the role of reluctant hero well. He shrugs a lot, but
says little about the fact that Brown believes Nevin will be able to
confuse San Marino's defenders and there will be many waiting to be
bamboozled.
The team from the Italian Republic have not been playing this game for
as long as the other nations in Group 8 of the European Championship
qualifiers, and they spend most of their ties huddled in front of their
own goal believing there is safety in numbers.
Brown has decided the guile and subtlety of a locksmith is required
rather than a sledgehammer, and Nevin will be asked to open up the
opposition defence using a touch and control which can be exquisite.
The match in the Serravalle Stadium will bring him his twenty-fifth
cap and there never was much chance of Nevin missing the opportunity to
have a place in the corridor if not the SFA's Hall of Fame itself --
only those with 50 caps get their portraits hung there -- even though
his wife, Annabel, is expected to give birth to their second child any
day now.
''I'm always happy to play for Scotland,'' said Nevin even though he's
entitled to believe he should have been asked more often. Just more than
half of his caps have been won as a substitute as Brown and Andy
Roxburgh before him felt many matches were not for the winger who tried
to grow up, but didn't get very far.
At full stretch Nevin doesn't touch 5ft 6in. and in the modern game,
small may be beautiful to watch but little people are in danger of being
run over. However, just as he had in 1991 when Scotland were in the same
World Cup qualifying group as San Marino, Nevin has an opportunity to
strike a blow for Lilliputians.
Last time Scotland played here in the Serravalle they made the mistake
of holding Nevin in reserve, and it was only when he was sent on that
the San Marino defence began to look confused. He snaked into their box
and was pulled down, allowing Gordon Strachan to score with a penalty.
''Hopefully this time it will be different,'' said Brown, although he
realises that at this stage the three points at stake are more important
than the aesthetic quality of his team's work.
''I remember the last game well,'' said Nevin, ''and I recall being
infuriated by San Marino's determination to foul me. I suspect it will
be the same again and so it will be up to me to do something provided I
can get enough of the ball.''

Are you wondering how you're going to cope with those looming exams?
Worry no more. DICK LOUDEN gets some advice from an expert in the field
and learns how to take the positive approach.
SO you want the definitive guide to how to prepare for your Standard
Grade or Higher exams? Mr Ken Keighren, senior educational psychologist
for Tayside region, runs workshops for schools on positive approaches to
coping with exams. Let's see how he organises his advice to senior
pupils.
It all starts with an exam anxiety questionnaire. This usually reveals
that very few pupils feel either very worried, or not at all worried,
about the outcome of their exams. It also reveals that girls in general
feel more anxious about exams than boys -- or maybe they are just more
willing to admit it. Anyway, it all leads naturally to the obvious
question -- why do pupils worry about their exams? There are three
normal answers:
* It may affect their job/career prospects one way or the other;
* There are strong parental expectations of success;
* They don't want to compare badly with classmates.
So what is anxiety? We all experience it, for example at the dentist's
or in a near miss in a car. Anxiety, says Mr Keighren, is our body's way
of preparing us for events -- and in itself it is no bad thing.
The answer to exam anxiety is effective study. Being effective means
organising yourself during the year -- for example, submitting pieces of
work at the required times. At this stage of the session it involves,
among other things, anticipating and dealing with problems and
temptations, like if your pal phones up and suggests going out, what
will you say? Do you have the willpower to refuse?
Effective study also means reviewing your study methods. What is the
best time of day and the best environment for studying? In Mr Keighren's
view, you should have a dedicated work space in which to revise, not
associated with other sources of enjoyment. A bedroom with a TV and/or
video player installed in it does not help at all.
You should also allow for regular breaks in your study plans. Mr
Keighren classifies study as a periodic rather than continuous
requirement. Unbroken spells of, say, 20 minutes are long enough. After
that time, take a few minutes break. Physical activities like cycling
are useful in reducing the ''interference effect'' -- you get away from
intellectual effort and stop thinking about the issues that are of most
concern to you.
Even in the exam situation, you can allow yourself short breaks as
long as you are within your time pattern. For instance, in a two-hour
exam with six questions, there is a case for relaxing for a couple of
minutes between questions as long as you stay within your average time
allocation of 20 minutes for each.
You may have been bombarded from various sources with conflicting
advice about the merits of studying right up to the day of the exam. Mr
Keighren likens the proper study technique to a pint glass of water
which is almost full. If you fill it too quickly, water will splash out.
On the other hand, if you fill it very gently there will be no spillage.
In the final stages you should not be thinking about new learning. This
is the time for revising, for disturbing what you have already learned
as little as possible.
Some people will advise you not to study on the actual day before an
exam. Mr Keighren does not subscribe to this view. In his opinion it is
legitimate to go over a condensed version of your year's work,
extracting the most relevant information from what you have been taught
during the session.
Then there are the so-called ''exam techniques'' which are intended to
increase your chances of success and can readily do so. Mr Keighren
emphasises the importance of your emotional response -- you must be
calm, in control of yourself, and focused -- and your intellectual
response. We have more information in our brains than we can ever
access. The trick is to remember one aspect of a topic, write it down,
and then you will remember other aspects following from that.
Ken Keighren has two general tips which he feels have the potential to
help you on the great day:
* Be positive -- treat exams as an opportunity to demonstrate what you
know rather than as an ordeal to be endured;
* If things are not working out, revert to the exam version of the
three Rs:
1. Relax -- put your pen down, sit back and think calmly.
2. Refocus -- go back to the basics of the question and think again
about the piece of knowledge which is required of you.
3. Retrieve -- you already know it. From within your store of
knowledge, concentrate and there is every chance that you will find it.
And the very best of luck to all of you. You can do it.

THREE Scots will line up a week tomorrow for a series of races unique
in British athletics. The Northumberland Castle Challenge, an
all-terrain event, will be contested on six different surfaces on
successive days, adding up to the marathon distance of 26 miles 385
yards.
The organisers have confirmed details of the series, exclusively
revealed in these columns 12 days ago. It will have TV coverage by
Channel 4, eight programmes, and carries $52,000 in prize money. The
field is restricted to 15 in men's and women's races, and every starter
is guaranteed $150 per day start money.
The event will have special significance for three-time world record
holder Steve Cram and Scotland's Karen Hargrave, both of whom will be
attempting to revive their careers.
The Scottish cross-country champions of the past three years,
respectively Tommy Murray and Chris Robison, both of IBM Spango Valley,
and England's Keith Anderson, who won this year in Cambuslang's colours,
were all on the list of invited athletes.
The overall winners will pocket $5000 in addition to individual race
prize money. The outright winners, male and female, receive $5000, with
$3000 for second and $2000 for third, down to $400 for tenth place.
Daily prize money, from $500 for victory to $50 for tenth, also will
be paid to both sexes. Points awarded daily will determine overall
places.
The series will have a brutal opening, a four-mile race on sand at
Bamburgh. Following daily are a 5000m track race (Hexham), forest track
(Keilder, 6 miles), cross-country (Belsay Castle, 5 miles), hill race
(Rothbury, 1033ft, 4.1 miles). The marathon distance will be completed
on the established road course at Bamburgh, used for the past two years
for the Castle series which this new event is replacing.
Cram will hope to make a more fluent return to competitive action than
he did in his new career as a commentator, where his marathon debut was
after the fashion of David Coleman.
For more than 20 miles of the Boston Marathon, Cram identified one of
the lead group as former world half-marathon winner, Benson Masya. In
fact, as Cram discovered when he finished second, it was not Masya, but
Moses Tanui.
Coleman spent the 1976 Olympic marathon identifying the winner,
Waldemar Cerpinski, as Polish. Tipped off as Cerpinski entered the
stadium, Coleman said: ''and it's East Germany's Cerpinski, who until
recently did most of his running in Poland.''
Hargrave, formerly Hutcheson when she was based in Fife, ran for
Scotland at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, finishing fourth in
the 3000m behind bronze medallist Liz McColgan and runner-up Yvonne
Murray.
She is returning to competition after injury and the birth of a
daughter, now aged 14 months, having lived in France for the past two
years. She returned to competitive action last weekend in an
international 5000m race in London, where she finished ninth, in 16-13.
Invited athletes named yesterday by the organisers, Brendan Foster's
promotion company, Nova, are:
Men -- Keith Anderson, Mike Hawkins (both Bingley), Tom Murray, Chris
Robison (both IBM Spango Valley), Steve Cram (Jarrow), Paul Davies-Hale
(Cannock), Harald Hudak (Czech Republic), Bashir Hussain (Stockport),
Martin Jones (Horwich), Jos Maes (Belgium), Adrian Passey (Bromsgrove),
Juri Smokotnin (Russia), Kassa Tadesse (Ethiopia). Carl Thackery
(Hallamshire).
Women -- Kath Bailey (New Forest), Veronique Collard (Belgium), Sally
Ellis (Birchfield), Karen Hargrave (Berryhill), Heather Heasman
(Invicta), Angie Hulley, Lucy Wright (both Leeds), Catherine Kirui
(Kenya), Fatuma Roba (Ethiopia), Marian Sutton (Tipton), Dennie van
Rensburgh (South Africa), Andrea Wallace (Torbay).
* LYNN Harding, who ran the marathon for Scotland at last year's
Commonwealth Games, will make her ultra debut by representing Britain at
the European 100 kilometres championships in France on May 27. The
Milngavie woman had planned a low-key start at ultras. ''I thought if
things went well, I might have a crack at the British record,'' she
said. ''Now I will be lining up against the best in Europe.''

Grabbed from behind
I was shoved into a bag
My legs crushed beneath me
Abruptly tossed into a corner
I was left
Alone
Lonely hours turned to hollow days
Suffocation was closing in
Behind closed doors
Distant laughter and frolics
Fear turned to sheer despair
Panic
Suddenly there was a banging
Footsteps approaching agonisingly slow
My breath quickened my heart raced
A door was flung open
Wild laughter filled the room
Terror
The bag was ripped open
Bright lights blinded me
I was hugged squeezed
My eyes adjusting to the light
Christmas paper strewn on the floor
Recognition dawned
Joy

If only she could see herself,
Teetering on the brink of
Destruction
On her four-inch heeled platform
Shoes.
A few hours ago
She would have had her hair in
Curlers
And a green face mask on.
Every head in the street
Turned
Due to her presence.
Men wished they were ten or
Twenty years younger, the
Boys made rude gestures.
The females smirk,
Some perhaps with
Jealousy,

SCOTLAND'S under-21 side will reverse their roles tonight in the
Serravalle Stadium where they will attempt to enhance their prospects of
winning their European group even though Finland head the group.
Tommy Craig, who is in the peculiar position of managing the team even
though he does not have a club job, believes his side can build on their
success in Moscow last month.
''I have been impressed by the ability and strength of their desire,''
said Craig, ''and I believe that a fine performance here can set them up
for a strong finish to their programme.''
It would not be unreasonable to suggest that, should the Scots
qualify, club sides would be foolish not to take a close look at Craig,
whose philosophy is impressive. He wants his teams to play with flair
and intelligence and surely that is what every manager ought to be
about.
His strike force will be Doug Freedman and Stephen Crawford, who will
be hoping wingers Neil McCann and Brian McLaughlin are on form, and if
all goes well the Scots should win comfortably.
''I'm confident we will,'' said Craig. ''We were underdogs against
Russia and Greece and it will be interesting to see how we cope being
favourites. I think it will go well.'' Team:
Stillie (Aberdeen), Jupp (Fulham), Dailly (Dundee United), Pressley
(Coventry City, capt), Bolan and Murray (both Rangers), McNamara
(Dunfermline), McLaughlin (Celtic), McCann (Dundee), Crawford (Raith
Rovers), Freedman (Barnet).

* AS the 17-year-old managing director of our school's Young
Enterprise ''Trin-Designs'' company, I wonder how deep the commitment of
British industry is to the attempts to develop enterprise in young
people.
We are finishing a successful year with more than 70% of sales to
companies and organisations outwith the school. However, we have been
astonished at the lack of acknowledgement, let alone response, when we
have sent samples and proposals to many companies. Do they not keep
themselves up to date with what is on offer to them?
We are not asking for special treatment but we do wonder why top

down throughout companies.
Of course this may be our big opportunity when we set up in business!

HATE to remind you of this, but since the big bad exam season is
nearly upon us, I thought we'd start with some science questions. Ready?
Here we go: How does hypnosis work? Which came first, the chicken or the
egg? How do microwaves heat food? Where would you end up in a black
hole? As part of science week, Glasgow University boffins invited
schools to submit questions which they'd be only too happy to answer. So
if you want the answers to these teasers, and to many more, turn to
pages 6 and 7. While we're in challenging mode, do you know what
tullihoo means? Or fremmit? Baulkin? Well, they're all Scots words and
in their spread on pages 8 and 9 the Doonhamers of Dumfries Academy
explain not only what they mean but why they think it's important to
celebrate Scots. Fegs!
On a more serious note, homelessness is perhaps the big issue today,
if you'll excuse the pun. On page 12 we report on what it's like to live
rough on the streets while on the facing page we talk to Robert
Swindells, prize-winning author of Stone Cold, a powerful novel for
teenagers about being young, down, and out in London.
Final words on exams: Stick in, good luck, and have a look at our tips
on the facing page. They may just come in handy.

* AIR raid sirens, the crash of bombs falling nearby. Watching family
and friends go off to fight, perhaps never to return. Young children
going on possibly the most important journey of their lives. Hearing of
innocent civilians being massacred in the concentration camps. Looking
on in terror as your whole life crumbles before your eyes.
Most of us have never experienced war; hopefully we never will. We are
far too young to have been around during 1939-1945, the period during
which the Second World War took place. We cannot fully imagine the
devastation and consequences of that horrific time. The closest we can
get are pictures from books and television programmes. The days when
Hitler was the name on everyone's lips are just part of our school
history lessons.
On May 8, 1995, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the official
ending of the war in Europe. Although this will rightly be a day for
celebrations to commemorate a historic time, we should also be
remembering all those soldiers and civilians who died while the allied
troops fought to reach Victory in Europe Day and we should reflect on
all the devastation that was caused during the six years of war that
started on September 3, 1939.
Quite regrettably it is more than likely that the loss of all those
lives will be dismissed as we remember and honour those who eventually
ended the war for us. We will unintentionally forget about all the
soldiers who helped to win the war, even though they lost their lives in
the process. No-one wins a war without losing a few thousand soldiers,
sailors, tanks, aeroplanes, and, of course, civilians before it is
finally over and one side has surrendered. May 8 will hold unhappy
memories for many of the ex-Servicemen and women who lost close friends,
but to everyone else it will be nothing but happiness.
It is not wrong to have celebrations. Of course we should, but we
cannot afford to forget the people who won the war. Hitler wanted to get
rid of people of other ethnic origin. He blamed them for Germany's
economic misfortune. Unfortunately he managed to gas millions of these
people as well as many Germans and others. This led the rest of the
world to go to war against Germany while Italy and Japan were its main
allies. Six years later the allied troops overcame Hitler with the help
of the American Army, which had only entered the war on December 7,
1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Whether the outcome would have
been the same without them will never be known.
I am not saying don't celebrate VE-Day. We must, as it was the day
when one of the most evil men on earth was officially pronounced dead.
However, I feel that we must not let ourselves forget the way in which
he died, and the time it took to win the war.
-- Leanne Cowen, 2nd year, Mearns Castle High, near Glasgow.
Lost opportunities
* AS the 17-year-old managing director of our school's Young
Enterprise ''Trin-Designs'' company, I wonder how deep the commitment of
British industry is to the attempts to develop enterprise in young
people.
We are finishing a successful year with more than 70% of sales to

More sport please
* THERE is a lack of sport in Scotland's schools. I believe that in
the afternoon after lunch more sport should be played. It would make
children fitter and might help to cut down the number of deaths from
heart disease.
Children also should have more facilities near their homes. Where
there is nothing to do children will just come lazy and fat.
-- Daniel Thomson, Dalry Secondary, St Johns Town of Dalry, Dumfries
and Galloway.
Unwanted predators
* THERE should be a national campaign to eradicate some foreign
species from the UK, like the American mink and the grey squirrel. And a
programme should be set up to help endangered species and reintroduce
them to areas where they have become extinct.
The American mink is one of the worst predators because, unlike the
weasel, it will kill all it can. If a mink gets into a colony of nesting
birds it kills most of the parent birds and leaves the eggs open to
attack from crows and seagulls. Minks also kill domestic animals like
chickens and even lambs.
Grey squirrels, like the mink, came originally from America. Grey
squirrels eat a wider range of food than red squirrels and will live in
almost any environment. This has forced the red squirrels into the
remoter areas of Britain.
There are ways of accomplishing eradication. Scientists have developed
a drug that can make grey squirrels infertile. If this could be
developed for mink it would humanely control the population. Unlike
myxomatosis it does not harm the animals in any way other than to make
them infertile.

* LUCY McCALL SMITH does seem to have inherited a good deal of talent
from her dad, but she is clearly not getting the kind of guidance from
adults that she deserves before being rushed into print (March 28).
At 10 years a child can hardly be expected to recognise a stereotype
for what it is without some adult help. That does not mean she should be
encouraged to reinforce a cruel prejudice -- in this case against that
unhappy minority of children who are overweight -- before a mass
audience.
Her story is an excellent, although no doubt unwitting, example of how
stereotypes are constructed on the basis of physical difference. Joanna,
the child on whom the story hinges, is introduced as spoilt, but we
discover that she is also fat and lazy -- characteristics that
apparently go together. When she falls off her new pogo stick and breaks
her arm, she begins to scream and kick her fat little legs in the air,
and once again faults of character and physical appearance are linked.
Society has a legitimate grievance against her too, on account of
this: because of her accident the pogo sticks are confiscated from the
other girls. Her fatness also makes her less generally deserving than
other children.
This is exactly how stereotypes of out-groups like Jews, blacks,
women, and the disabled are used to justify depriving them of various
things (such as rights, self-respect, and material possessions) that
people who fit the cultural norm take for granted.
Take a good look at your local playgrounds and you will soon realise
that the fat child, especially if he or she is a sensitive soul, is the
unacceptable other who is driven out of the group or just ignored.
My heart goes out to all those unfortunate overweight children who may
read her story and see their misery mirrored there and justified. The
truth is that if children are fat there is a reason for it.
I do not think it a kindness either to these children or to the
author, who is probably a very kind-hearted little girl, to propagate
her innocent prejudice in this way. One day Lucy may wish that her
elders and should-know-betters had chosen some other vehicle to launch
her into print.

Government, University of Strathclyde.

<TEXT>
REPUBLIC of Ireland manager Jack Charlton is poised to call on John
Aldridge and Ray Houghton for tomorrow's crucial European Group 6
qualifier against Portugal in Dublin.
Charlton hopes to present the Portugese with the good, old-fashioned
pressure game which provided the bedrock of Ireland's advance to the top
rank of international football during his nine-year reign.
Aldridge, 36, but still his country's leading scorer among current
international players, and Crystal Palace's Houghton, 33, look set to be
recalled in place of David Kelly and Roy Keane.
Aldridge, replaced by Kelly in the last two matches and Houghton, who
has not started a game for Ireland since the World Cup finals last
summer, made their international debuts together in Charlton's first
match in charge against Wales nine years ago.
''I've let things slide a bit, thinking that other countries may have
got used to the way we played and could counter it,'' said the manager.
''But now I'm tempted to bring back Ray and John and do what we used to
do best.
''I haven't had the chance to watch Portugal first-hand and that is a
little worrying but, from the video tapes we have of them, it is clear
that they don't like people hustling them and getting about the job very
quickly.
''We also know they have very good, competitive players who like to
pass the ball through the middle, and we can't allow them to get in
behind our midfield or they will cause us problems.''

POSTAL services in Scotland are likely to be hit by strike action next
Monday, after an overwhelming vote in protest against a unilateral
management decision to scrap the traditional May Day holiday.
Scottish staff employed in all six Post Office businesses endorsed
strike action, with Royal Mail employees leading the way with an
impressive 7-1 in a massive turnout of almost 90%. Parcelforce and Post
Office Counters will also be affected, although sub-post offices should
operate as normal.
Commenting on the ballot result, Mr George Robertson, Communication
Workers' union officer for Scotland, said that, once again, the Post
Office and particularly the Royal Mail had misjudged the feelings of
their staff by taking cavalier unilateral decisions on their terms and
conditions.
The statutory seven days' notice of strike action had been lodged,
although the union was seeking to open negotiations to resolve the
issue. However, without such an agreement, further industrial action
could not be ruled out.
The Post Office maintains its decision to axe this year's May Day
holiday was in order to extend the May 8 VE Day bank holiday to
Scotland. It was a one-off arrangement and next year's May Day holiday
would be restored. The proposed strike would be unnecessary and
pointless as Scottish employees would be receiving exactly the same
holiday entitlement as staff throughout England and Wales.

ABERDEEN, who can do with all the help they can get, received a timely
boost yesterday when their Dutch international keeper, Theo Snelders,
returned to Pittodrie in time for the tough, three-game finale of the
relegation battle.
Snelders, who broke a foot five weeks ago, had not been expected to
play again this season, but has returned to training after specialised
treatment in Holland, and he could be set to play against Hearts this
weekend.
Said caretaker manager Roy Aitken: ''His return is a real lift in the
big push to stay in the premier division.
''He is an extremely fit player and was able to complete 75% of his
normal work. He is also very positive about playing his part in our
remaining games.
''No target has been set for his comeback at this stage. We will be
monitoring him daily but he could be available for selection against
Hearts this week.''
Michael Watt has done nothing wrong in the Dutchman's absence but, in
the tense scenario that will prevail for the next few weeks, Snelders'
experience could be invaluable.
The manager knows that a maximum nine ponts from their last three
games is required to have any chance of survival in the top division.
Meanwhile, although he left Dundee United some time ago, Ivan Golac,
their former manager, seems destined to excite interest at Tayside for a
while yet.
The club yesterday went to the length of threatening legal action
against Golac after reports that the Croatian is not only about to take
over as manager of a Greek club, not yet named, but has decided he wants
a United player and one of their backroom staff to join him.
United deduced that the men Golac would want would be defender Gordan
Petric, the former Partizan Belgarde player whom he signed soon after
having become manager at Tannadice, and a choice from Gordon Wallace or
Paul Hegarty, his former assistants, and team captain Maurice Malpas.
Said chairman, Jim McLean: ''At a time when this club is fighting for
its premier division survival, these alleged comments are absolutely
scandalous. Petric, Gordon Wallace, Paul Hegarty, and Maurice Malpas are
all under contract. These stories are unsettling for all concerned and
will not be tolerated by Dundee United.
''If they are repeated by Mr Golac we will consider appropriate action
against him.''
Manager Billy Kirkwood, Golac's successor, also joined in: ''These
suggestions are pure speculation, but Gordan is under contract here and
it would take a very good offer before we would even consider selling
him or any of our other top players.''
Back on the field, United could have striker Craig Brewster back for
the final two league games of the season, starting with the relegation
confrontation with Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Saturday week.
Brewster, who broke a toe against Rangers, will be back in training
this week. Said Kirkwood: ''This week's game with Hibs will come a bit
quick for Craig but he could be involved in a reserve game next midweek,
and that would increase his chances for the final two games.''
* SEVERAL Celtic and Airdrie players will walk a tightrope before the
Scottish Cup final on May 27.
Parkhead men Tony Mowbray and Willie Falconer and Airdrie's Andy
Smith, Graham Hay, Jimmy Sandison, and Steve Cooper are close to the
points threshold.
Anyone stepping out of line could face an automatic ban from the big
game at Hampden. However, Celtic manager Tommy Burns and Airdrie
assistant John McVeigh claim that they will continue to field their
strongest teams in the run-in to the big day.
Falconer, currently on 14 penalty points, is only one booking away
from a suspension.
But Airdrie's problem is more serious, with Smith on 12 points, Cooper
13, Sandison 14, and Hay perched on the 15-point mark.

DEREK Forsyth and Mike Gilbert, the respective coaches of the Scottish
men and women's Under-21 squads, who this weekend start their programmes
in the European Junior Championship qualifying tournaments, have been
hit by selection problems.
Forsyth initially had nine players unavailable through examinations,
and only three days before the team depart for Genoa, centre forward
James Burns (Grange) has pulled out through illness. His place has gone
to MIM's James Spreng.
University commitments forced Sarah Taylor and Rachel Millar to
withdraw from the women's tournament in Poznan, Poland. Squads:
Men -- Graeme Murton (McMahon Kelburne), Mark Ellen and Andrew Balchin
(both Touche Ross Gordonians), Chris Anderson (Menzieshill), Calum Wood
(Grange), captain, Graham Joyce, Euan Miller, Vishal Marwaha (all
Western), Jonathan Christie (Cannock), Graham Dunlop (Clydesdale),
Richard Forsyth (Insights Inverleith), James Spreng and Bruce Montgomery
(both MIM), James McBlane (Beeston), Alan Ralph (McMahon Kelburne) and
Michael Leonard (Watsonians).
Women -- Carolyn Mitchell (Edinburgh Ladies), Claire Murphy, Hailey
Welsh, Jenny Morrice and Gail Crawford (all Western Klick Photopoint),
Gillian Soutar, Dorileen Forbes, Jackie Ferguson, Sarah Esselmont,
Sionnuala Robb and Nikki Wheatley (all Heriot-Watt Univ), Kathryn Gray
and Jocelyn Scullion (both Loughborough Univ), Claire Lampard
(Boroughmuir), Karen Shermon (Bristol Univ) and Suzanne Flemming
(Bonagrass Grove).

THINGS couldn't get much worse for Scotland's cricketers than Sunday's
10-wicket thrashing by Worcestershire, and now the Scots face Derbyshire
this afternoon at Titwood in the second of their Benson &amp; Hedges zonal
matches.
The combination of the Glasgow venue and that sponsor is usually a
recipe for rain. And that might be the only way the Scots escape another
bleaching against a major county.
Derbyshire warmed up on Sunday by whipping Northants by eight wickets,
Chris Adams performing with the bat. The county also have Devon Malcolm,
Phil DeFreitas, Kim Barnett, Dominic Cork, and South African Daryll
Cullinan.
So the Scots will have their work cut out yet again. But any kind of
performance would be a considerable improvement on the weekend,
according to SCU Director of Cricket Jim Love, who admitted that the
Scots' batting and fielding was dismally bad.
The former Yorkshire cap will captain the Scots today having recovered
from the curried prawns-induced tummy bug which made him miss Sunday's
debacle.
''It was embarrassing to have Malcolm Marshall in the side and perform
like that,'' added Love, who will be thinking that anything in excess of
180 by the Scots' batsmen would give Marshall something to bowl at.

IN DOING all that could be asked of them in that uplifting performance
against Romania, Scotland's players underlined two particular areas of
encouragement that should heighten the respect for them among the giants
of the southern hemisphere -- the improvement in their handling
continuity in which forwards and backs frequently intermingled and the
gratifying hint of some strength in depth for certain positions.
The more attractive style surely owes a lot to the efforts of their
coaches, Douglas Morgan and Richie Dixon, to make their preparatory
sessions stimulating not only in honing players' skills so that they
stand up under big game pressure but by conducting so much of the
training at match pace. Even on Friday morning when all the serious work
had been completed there was an agreeable mix of urgency and obvious
enjoyment as support running, communication, and linkage were polished.
In transplanting this to the international on Saturday, Scotland
displayed briskness, togetherness, and collective reactive speed that
the Romanians just didn't match.
In keeping the ball alive with their hands, the Scots have advanced
significantly and, in this, their skills practices in training are a key
ingredient. When Gregor Townsend laid that reverse ball, one-handed,
behind his back for the Gavin Hastings try in Paris, it simply was a
repetition of a round-the-body ball-control routine they do in practice
sessions.
Another area in which practice not only makes perfect but encourages
players to utilise those skills in the heat and burden of international
fray is in the number of one-handed passes with which Scots now keep the
ball on the move.
Thus, in the twinkling sequence leading to the Hastings try against
Romania, the captain himself delivered a superb right-handed pass to
Eric Peters, then as the move was revitalised at the ruck by Doddie Weir
laying ball at the back door with one hand, so Peter Wright used his
left hand to loop up ball to Rob Wainwright. Craig Joiner's try owed
everything to Ian Morrison's deft flip-up out of the tackle with his
left hand.
The part played by forwards in asking questions of secondary defence
positions, was shown in a splendid move that actually stemmed from messy
scrummage ball which Wainwright tidied and that should have spawned
another try but for a knock-on by Kenny Logan.
The sequence included straightening by Craig Chalmers which switched
inside to Kevin McKenzie, then from the ruck Bryan Redpath launched
Wright and from yet another ruck Redpath, Chalmers, Tony Stanger, and
Graham Shiel (on a loop) handled securely before Logan lost control with
Hastings and Joiner free on the outside.
Of course, such skills would be rendered of little value if the
corporate desire to seek that kind of fluency was not there. It seems
now to be implanted in Scottish minds that such a style not only is
possible but, indeed, essential if South African conditions are to be
exploited to the full and if Scotland are to make an agreeable
impression on the competition.
Another string to the Scottish bow was the adventurism of Hastings in
running out of deep positions and once actually performing a hand off in
his own in-goal area. All of which renders Scotland far less predictable
thus making it harder for opposing defences to tie them down.
It was a good game for Shiel and Stanger to make their claims as a
centre partnership because the Romanian midfield defence was a bit leaky
through failing to adjust quickly enough to changing threats.
Their full back also found Hastings' choices of flight path too much
of a handful. Still, Shiel and Stanger provided an interesting blend and
each chose splendid angles of running in scoring tries, Shiel on a wide
sweep that left the Romanian open-side flanker in its wake, Stanger
actually putting both Romanian centres out of the game as well as
proving just too strong for the Romanian open side in scoring his first
try.
Also, when Nicolae Racean scored the Romanian try, Stanger would have
sunk him but lost balance in tripping over Romeo Gontineac.
Bulk will be important for the frontal warfare in South Africa so that
Ken Milne is likely to remain first-choice hooker. Yet, McKenzie has a
sharpness about him, is a sure bet to win 50-50 ball on the deck and
exudes jaunty confidence that is infectious.
Scotland, indeed, aren't all that badly off for back-up in certain
positions when one considers that the current loose forward trio who
have proved so effective have Peter Walton and Ian Smith breathing on
their necks.
Most important of all, however, is that as Romania aren't all that
nhghly rated by the heavy artillery of the Southern Hemisphere, it was
important for Scotland's standing to beat them handsomely. They did just
that.
What is more, England could score only six tries against a weaker
Romania, Scotland scored seven -- and it could have been more.

STRASBOURG: The European Court of Human Rights yesterday heard a plea
from British journalist William Goodwin that a verdict ordering him to
reveal his sources violated his right to freedom of expression.
Mr Goodwin, who wrote an article in The Engineer magazine on a
company's financial woes, was fined and ordered to give up his notes so
that the firm could punish the source of the leak. The court will give
its ruling within a year.

AS PLAY resumes today in the Atlantic Rim women's outdoor bowls
championships at Durban, two questions remain: Can South Africa pull off
a clean sweep? And can Scotland salvage some pride in the singles and
fours?
Sarah Gourlay's injured left wrist holds the key to the second
question. Having been seen on Sunday by Dr Moolla, a specialist in
sports injuries, she will learn this morning whether she will be able to
play.
If there is a doubt about her fitness, she may forsake her singles
berth to play a supporting role in the fours. Eleanor Allan, Scotland's
secretary and team manager, explains: ''If her wrist packed up again, no
substitution would be allowed in the singles, but I could always step in
for her in the fours.''
South Africa, celebrating successes in triples and pairs, are
recalling the last time they hosted a major international bowls event,
in 1976, when they swept the board at the men's world championships in
Johannesburg.
Well though they played last week, it must be said that they are just
coming to the end of their bowls season, whereas their British rivals
have all come off fast indoor surfaces to play on heavy grass greens.
One of the three greens at the Northlands centre has come in for harsh
criticism from competitors. Even the South Africans grimaced when they
played the trial ends against England on that green last week.
A request to the organisers that the lower green should be laid off is
being considered, but the local greenkeeper, it seems, will have the
last word. He was lowering the blades on his mower yesterday -- and
paying close attention to the rogue green.
Scotland take on Namibia and Guernsey in singles and fours today.

JIMMY White yesterday answered the critics who suggested that he would
not mount another serious challenge for the world title.
The six-times runner-up produced his best snooker of the tournament to
take a 6-2 lead over Liverpool's John Parrott after their first session.
White dropped two of the first three frames but went into the interval
level at 2-2.
He produced a break of 58 in the fifth frame and then came one of the
two turning points.
White trailed 58-0 in the sixth frame but eventually cleared up to the
pink with 69 to lead 4-2.
A third half-century break in a row sent him 5-2 clear before Parrott
went ahead in the eighth but once again he could not score heavily
enough to put the frame out of reach. White stepped in again with 51,
arguably one of the top three clearances of the championship so far.
On the adjoining table, Nigel Bond led Gary Wilkinson 5-3 in a battle
between the outsiders among the last eight.

STEPHEN Hendry kept teenage upstart Ronnie O'Sullivan in check at
Sheffield yesterday as the four-times world champion took a 9-7 lead
into this morning's final session.
But the Scot, who has not been behind since the third frame, knows
that the defence of his title still hangs in the balance, as there are
nine frames still to play.
The Essex teenager perhaps was grateful to split the second session
after having resumed last night with a 5-3 deficit.
If he can strike a couple of early blows on the restart, it could put
Hendry under pressure for the first time since the tournament began.
The 26-year-old Scot's break of 62 to open the session was his fifth
half-century of the match and gave him a three-frame lead for the first
time.
Another success at this stage and O'Sullivan's spirit might have been
broken but he took the tenth frame after the latest re-rack of the
championship.
There was no doubt Scottish referee Lawrie Annandale's call was
correct -- unlike the contentious intervention of John Williams during
Willie Thorne's match against Andy Hicks last Saturday.
At the second time of asking O'Sullivan took the frame and also added
the next to trail 6-5.
Hendry responded with a run of 97 but O'Sullivan closed within one
again before the Scot chalked up a century for the 285th time in his
career.
He followed his 103 clearance with an 86 break before O'Sullivan
snatched the last frame of the session to throw himself a lifeline.
Against Darren Morgan in the last round he won nine frames in a row
from 8-4 down, so a two-frame deficit is well within his capability.
Hicks was in early danger of being blitzed by Peter Ebdon on the
adjoining table but by last night it was the other way round. A series
of half-century breaks and an amazing run of 11 out of 13 frames gave
him a commanding lead of 11-5 after their second session and he needs
just two more out of a possible nine today to reach the semi-finals.
Ebdon lived up to his billing of second favourite for the title by
taking a 3-0 lead with breaks of 50 and 85. In fact, he was heading for
4-0 by the interval but Hicks managed to snatch the frame as a
remarkable transformation began.
Hicks followed that with a break of 92 to cut the deficit to 3-2,
pinched the sixth frame on the black with a clearance of 58 and,
although Ebdon restored his advantage at 4-3, Hicks' third half-century
tied it up at the end of the afternoon session at 4-4.
The left-handed conqueror Steve Davis and Willie Thorne in the two
previous rounds picked up where he left off when they resumed last
night, producing five more breaks around the 60 mark as he stretched his
lead to six frames. Ebdon was mostly powerless, his only joy being in
the third frame of the evening session.

THERE was a time when Glasgow was notorious for home-town decisions.
This can no longer be the case after Condorrat's Wilson Docherty was
last night judged by referee John Coyle to have lost on points over 10
rounds to Swansea's Peter Harris in a final eliminator for the British
featherweight title.
Docherty, who held a points win over Harris, cut his opponent about
the eyes and looked to have done enough to win again. But referee Coyle
thought otherwise.
This is the second body blow to Docherty in months, having been
controversially outpointed for the vacant British title by Paisley's
Mike Deveney, also at the St Andrews Sporting Club.
Docherty's brother Drew, the British bantamweight champion, said: ''I
wouldn't be surprised if Wilson chucked it now. That was a disgraceful
decision. It's difficult to see where the incentive is for him now.''
Results:
Light-middleweight -- Billy Collins (Stirling) beat Phil Epton
(Doncaster) rsc second. Welter -- Tommy Quinn (Tranent) beat Billy
McDougall (Birmingham) rsc third. Feather -- Robert Hay (Coatbridge)
outpointed Paul Quarmby (Sunderland) six rounds.

THE bandit-hunting season is upon us again as The Herald Parbusters
feature resumes next week in the seventh annual quest to uncover our
club golfers of the year.
Club golf returns will be scrutinised carefully over the next 16 weeks
to identify the best scores and whenever possible a bandit-of-the-week
will be named and duly interviewed.
Aspirants for such an accolade will find the competition stiff if the
pattern of previous years is repeated as we fully expect. Scores have
been as low as 18 below handicap for a single round for both men and
women, and to have a chance of qualifying for our Parbusters final at
Haggs Castle on October 4 the cut-off mark is generally around minus 11
or 12.
In the scratch sections you will need to shoot in the region of five
under the competition scratch score for men while one under has usually
been sufficient for the women. Course records have frequently been not
good enough.
Such scores do not prove the handicap systems are faulty. Our returns
reflect up to 15,000 rounds each week and in such a large field there is
usually someone who has played out of his or her skin and returned the
card of a lifetime.
In the final the pattern has been different, partly because handicaps
by then have been savaged. Anyone who plays to his or her new mark has
generally won, while level par has been sufficient in the scratch
sections.
The competition works like this: the top 10 scorers over the next 16
weeks in each of four sections -- men's and women's handicap and scratch
-- will qualify for our 18-hole shotgun shoot-out to determine the
winners. There will be a ballot in the event of ties.
Scores are calculated against the competition scratch score (CSS) for
men and standard scratch score (SSS) for women to allow as far as
possible comparisons from course to course. We must have these figures,
otherwise Parbusters scores cannot be worked out.
For example, a net 62 against a CSS of 71 would be a Parbusters score
of minus 9, but for a CSS of 66 only minus 4.
Scores must be from a single strokeplay round (not Stableford, bogey,
or par format) in a recognised club competition and returned to us from
a club official -- not an individual player -- within a week of the
competition taking place. Only clubs with Scottish Golf Union
course-owning status are eligible.

A CENTURY or so ago a despairing British politician -- the forerunner
of a long and baffled line -- complained that ''just when you think you
have solved the Irish Question, the Irish change the Question.'' A
similar sense of frustration is currently concentrating the minds of the
principal investors in a new golf development in the Republic.
Who could have imagined that such major entrepreneurial players as Dr
Tony O'Reilly, Mark McCormack, and Gerry Buckley (of Miller Buckley
fame) might be thwarted of a #5m course, The Links Portmarnock --
designed, constructed, and imminently ready for play -- by the stubborn
resistance of three local women?
For a mere #30 each, these stalwarts have lodged objections that the
development denies them their accustomed ease of access for picnics and
dog-walking on the dunesland beyond the course, devised by American
architect Stan Eadie in consultation with the former Masters champion,
Bernhard Langer.
Thus -- although this most testing example of a true links was
completed a year ago -- not until next month will the local planning
authority decide whether it will ever open for play. Technically, the
course could be ploughed under.
In the wake of the objections to the development, expanded from the
course alone to a hotel and dormie village capable of competing with
luxury resorts such as Turnberry, some #1m has been spent on its
justification, including one of those politically correct diversions, an
Environmental Impact Study.
The contrariness of human nature was remarked on by Buckley when he
said: ''a thousand people did support the objection, but many of the
same people also signed in favour of the project. No wonder, since in
the north Dublin area, the unemployment rate is 14% and the whole
enterprise will generate some 200 jobs.''
Colin Maclaine, a former captain of the Royal and Ancient Club who is
chairman of the course-owning company, is bullish about the prospects.
''It's a sensitive issue,'' he said, ''but it was the authority's
acceptance that a golf course was the ideal use for this land which
encouraged the project in the first place.
''If the 'unthinkable' happened and planning for the resort failed,
the course itself would surely survive.''
Green fees are projected at #35 per round and #45 at weekends, with
concessions for local golfers and ''twilight'' play. Resort hotel
residents would, of course, be accommodated and corporate outings
encouraged.
Under the supervision of its Scottish head greenkeeper, Peter Casbold,
who learned his craft at Turnberry, the course of almost 7000 yards has
sensibly not been rushed into a premature opening.
The density of the rough beyond narrow fairways is positively
primeval. The other day, one member of a group invited to make the first
public reconnaissance separated himself conclusively from eight golf
balls. Even taking the rough back another width of a gang-mower, which
is in future plans, will not much reduce a deal of searching.
There are 96 bunkers, and many are cavernously deep and with sheer
vertical faces in the old style. The most extreme example is the
greenside guardian at the short seventeenth, which from base to apex
rises an intimidating 10 feet.
That hole and the eighteenth would provide a stirring climax to an
inward half set amidst the sort of tremendous dune country given to few
architects to exploit these days -- all depending, of course, on those
three stubborn ladies and of that local authority verdict.

ALL leading golfers have to make their name somewhere, and that of
Bearsden-reared Simon Yates must rank as one of the most improbable.
The 25-year-old, who is now based in Germany, came under the spotlight
at the weekend by winning the final event of the inaugural China Tour,
the Coca-Cola Open at the Jack Nicklaus-designed Mission Hills Golf Club
at Shenzhen with a 36-hole, four-under-par aggregate of 140.
Yates, a former skiing internationalist, has already proved himself to
be a winner. Last year he quietly claimed the German PGA title and then,
on another exotic sojourn, came top in the Thai Tour qualifying
tournament, though he didn't do so well in the tour proper.
His latest success, which made him the official No.2 in China, is one
that he regards as his most prestigious, given that it was in an
international field.
''There were five or six Australians who are in the top 20 of their
order of merit, a lot of the leading players from Taipei, and others who
are regulars on the Asian Tour, so the standard was pretty high,'' he
said from his hotel room in Shenzen yesterday, before making the trip
north to Beijing for this week's 72-hole Volvo China Open, part of the
Asian Tour.
He might well have finished No.1 had he not missed the second of the
four events because of sunstroke, but the $9000 prize, by virtue of a
rediscovered putting touch, has announced that he is back to health. He
credits David Thomson, of Kings Links in Aberdeen and another of the
four Scots currently in China, for his form on the greens.
''I've been using a Ping Anser 5 putter which has no loft and I was
holding the club forward of the ball. When I hit the ball, it tended to
jump. David suggested I put my hands behind the ball at address and the
result is that the ball is rolling much better.
''I didn't three-putt once in the tournament, which is miraculous for
me. I'm usually shaking over two-footers. The long course also suited me
in the windy conditions, because I hit the ball low,'' added Yates, who,
after having forsaken his skis for golf clubs, was initially taught at
Dougalston by his one-handicap father, Chris.
So why is this globe-trotting young man emerging as a force in
far-flung places and not at home?
In January last year, he left the Royal Burgess Golfing Society in
Edinburgh after five years under the guidance of professional George
Yuille to follow the now well-trodden path to more lucrative pastures in
Europe, in his case a teaching pro's job at the Potsdamer club just
outside Berlin.
''I was giving in the region of 20 to 25 one-hour lessons a week,
which didn't feel that much, and left a lot of time for practice. After
two months I was playing much better and the professional there, Simon
Fisher, an Englishman who has now moved to Hamburg, suggested I enter
the German PGA championship, which I did, and won it with nine under par
over three rounds.''
He had three other top-10 finishes on the domestic German Tour, but
having missed four of the eight events, managed a ranking of just No.16.
He also played in last year's BMW International in Munich, playing with
Gary Orr and Steven Richardson, but missed the cut.
Just for a change these days, Yates plans to compete in Scotland next
month in the Tartan Special Scottish Professional championship at
Dalmahoy. ''I finished in the top 30 two years ago, but didn't play last
year. I think I will have to qualify.''
Also on his agenda is a bid to qualify for this year's Open
Championship at St Andrews.
Yuille had Yates identified as a prospect long before he left for
Germany, and said: ''He has a natural talent for striking the ball and
has an exceptionally late hit. He is only about 9st in weight and pound
for pound he must be one of the longest hitters of the ball. He also has
flair and, if things are going right, he is capable of shooting very low
scores.''

Singapore, Monday
JOHN SCRIPPS, a 35-year-old Briton accused of dismembering a South
African tourist in Singapore, today faced six extra charges, including
vandalism.
Scripps faces a mandatory death sentence if found guilty of killing
Gerard George Lowe, a 32-year-old South African who was on a shopping
holiday.
Conviction in the vandalism charge could mean a caning.
Scripps, who absconded from Britain after being released from jail on
parole, is also a suspect in the murders of Canadian tourists Darin
Damude and his mother, Sheila, in the Thai resort of Phuket.
Today he appeared in court and was accused of smashing a window in a
police interview room at Singapore Changi Airport shortly after his
arrest on March 19.
No plea was taken and Scripps was ordered to remain in a detention
centre while investigations continue. His next court appearance is on
May 2.
Scripps was also charged today with five additional counts of forgery
with intent to cheat. Each forgery charge carries a maximum penalty of
seven years' jail.--Reuter.

pro-Europe, centre-right voters and supporters of the extreme-right
National Front to be sure of victory on May 7.
Final official results showed Jospin polled 23.3% to Chirac's 20.8.
Balladur, the runaway favourite at the start of the campaign but later
eclipsed by Chirac in opinion polls, managed only 18.5%, and right-wing
extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen 15%.
The right weighed roughly 60% to the left's 40%, but Chirac's camp
acknowledged the battle was far from won.
Aides said Chirac had telephoned Balladur to thank him for saying that
he would support him in the contest to succeed Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand.
They said the two men, whose rivalry eclipsed left-right divisions and
issues such as unemployment and corruption for much of the campaign, may
meet soon to seal reconciliation with a handshake for the benefit of
television viewers.
''Jacques Chirac told Edouard Balladur that he wanted, like him, the
widest possible unity of forces who refuse a third Socialist seven-year
term,'' his spokesman Francois Baroin said.
Chirac's courtesy paid off today when Balladur, addressing 500 of his
leading supporters at a luxury Paris hotel, asked them to back his
former rival.
However the Prime Minister, in his first day as a lame duck, cautioned
that support would have strings attached: ''We're not talking about
imposing or demanding something. But we have to ensure that our plans
are born of a coalition which is united.''
Aides said Balladur would insist that Chirac include some of his own
supporters in his government and take a clear stand for European
monetary union. Europe integration, largely ignored so far, could become
a key issue in the run-off.
Sixty-two MPs of the centrist CDS party swung their support from
Balladur to Chirac, dubbing the Paris mayor the only man capable of
uniting voters on an anti-unemployment and pro-European platform.
Chirac, 62, will relaunch his campaign tomorrow with a rally in the
central town of Orleans, south of Paris.
Buoyed by his unexpected win, Jospin, 57, said voters had refused to
be dictated to in their decisions. He flew to the southern town of
Valence for the first in a series of daily rallies across France over
the next 12 days.
Le Pen, basking in his record score, left politicians guessing who he
would back. Quarantined by mainstream political parties, he said he
would make his voting recommendation at a ''Joan of Arc Day'' rally next
Monday.
He said he doubted his anti-immigrant suporters would vote for Chirac
and dubbed Jospin ''a respectable man''.--Reuter.

Cape Town, Monday
FORMER church leader and ANC activist Allan Boesak, cleared by the
South African Government of misappropriating Scandinavian aid funds,
today demanded an apology and the withdrawal of charges by his accusers.
However lawyers for DanChurch Aid, a donor agency which alleges
Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice intercepted up to #556,000
intended for anti-apartheid victims, rejected the results of the
government inquiry.
''I would expect a public apology, I would expect a withdrawal of
charges, and I would expect a discussion . . . of restoration that could
be made in the light of the suffering that I and my family have gone
through,'' Boesak said.
However the agency's laywers said in response to Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki's exoneration of Boesak: ''Our answer is that Dr Boesak
substantially enriched himself at the expense of the foundation. We have
compelling evidence to that effect.''
They added: ''Dr Boesak has had nearly five months to show why our
report is incorrect. He has not done so.''
In Copenhagen, the Nordic church aid organisations said they intended
to sue Boesak to get their funds back.
Boesak withdrew as ambassador-designate to the United Nations in
Geneva after the allegations were raised. Today he said he would be
available for another foreign post.
President Nelson Mandela welcomed the report clearing Boesak, saying:
''He deserves a very high diplomatic position.''

The Hague, Monday
BOSNIAN Serbs, already under pressure for rejecting a Big Power peace
plan, faced further isolation tonight after a United Nations war crimes
tribunal named two of their leaders as suspected war criminals.
It suspects them of ordering murder, rape, and ''ethnic cleansing'' of
civilians in the Bosnian conflict.
The move was welcomed as a ''first step'' by Bosnian Government
officials and denounced by Bosnian Serb officials as inspired by the
United States.
In The Hague, tribunal chief prosecutor Richard Goldstone said that
self-styled president Radovan Karadzic, his army commander Ratko Mladic,
and his former police chief Mico Stanisic were under investigation.
He said the investigations could lead to formal charges by the end of
the year.
Bosnian Serb officials at their mountain stronghold in Pale outside
Sarajevo linked the move to a decision by the UN Security Council last
week to stiffen enforcement of Serbia's blockade on them.
''It's interesting to see the timing of the court announcement which
coincides with other pressures. I see it as part of the overall pressure
on our side inspired by the Americans,'' said a Bosnian Serb source.
It was the first sign that the UN tribunal planned to target important
figures associated with the worst excesses of the three-year Bosnian
conflict. The tribunal has so far indicted 22 people, all Serbs, but
none in prominent, public positions.
Bosnia's Muslim-led government has long asked that the Bosnian Serb
leadership be held accountable for the terror and killing that swept the
country when war broke out in 1992.
''I don't know of any case of Karadzic directly taking guns and
killing people but he's responsible for issuing orders that others
carried out,'' said Mirsad Tokaca, head of the Bosnian state war crimes
commission.
Some UN officials in Sarajevo privately expressed concern about the
timing of the announcement.
They said the tribunal's move could damage already strained relations
between the Serbs and the UN at a time when a peacekeeping mission is
struggling to broker an extension of the current ceasefire in Bosnia,
which expires in six days.
Later the tribunal took custody of Dusan Tadic, who was flown amid
tight security from Germany, where he was arrested last year, to
Scheveningen jail in The Hague. On Wednesday he will be asked to plead
on charges of murdering, raping, beating, and torturing Croats and
Muslims in north-west Bosnia.
* Two people were killed and three wounded when an explosion rocked
the Bosnian capital Sarajevo tonight. One reporter described the blast,
caused by two mortar shells, as ''exceptionally strong even by Sarajevo
standards''. The UN confirmed the shelling during an evening of heavy
machinegun fire around the city's Jewish cemetery.--Reuter.

Kibeho, Monday
TUTSI troops said today they were ready to flush out the last 1000
Hutus holed up in southern Rwanda's Kibeho camp, where thousands were
slain at the weekend, while survivors were dispersed nationwide.
''We are getting impatient with these people,'' said one soldier of
the government's Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) as hundreds
of troops massed at the camp.
''Either they surrender and we take them to jail, or we go in and take
them out. We are ready for them but we are just waiting for orders from
Kigali,'' he said.
RPA and United Nations forces have buried most of the corpses in
Kibeho, but a row is raging over exactly how many Hutu men, women, and
children were shot, blown up by mortars, bayoneted, or trampled to death
when Tutsi soldiers opened fire on Saturday.
UN officials initially estimated up to 8000 were killed after a
physical count reached 4000 with much of the camp still to be covered.
President Pasteur Bizimungu visited the camp yesterday and blamed Hutu
gunmen inside the camp for the mayhem. He put the number of dead at 300.
The UN then revised its count to 2000, which aid agencies rejected as
''contemptuous government arithmetic''.
All the camps which housed 250,000 Hutus in south-west Rwanda since
the end of genocidal civil war last July have been closed down in an
operation which started last Tuesday, the RPA said.
Hutus were packed into trucks and sent home to an uncertain reception
in their old districts. Others were force-marched to the southern town
of Butare, where they were handed UN food rations and then driven off in
lorries heading for their homes.
Among 5000 Hutus seen by journalists in Butare's sports stadium, a
holding ground
* THE United Nations Security Council today nominated 12 jurists from
among whom the General Assembly will elect six to serve as judges on a
UN tribunal to try people accused of genocide and other human rights
violations in Rwanda.
The tribunal was established last November to punish those responsible
for massacring between 500,000 and one million people last year. It will
be based in Arusha, Tanzania.
used for Tutsis during massacres by Hutu hard-liners last year, some
had apparently been stoned or beaten by Tutsi villagers during their
march.
Rwanda's government, which alleged Hutu gunmen provoked the carnage by
firing on the RPA, said those remaining in Kibeho were a well-armed
criminal hard core.
The road east of Kibeho towards Butare was today littered with a
pathetic trail of Hutu belongings such as water pots abandoned during
the march.
Oxfam tonight condemned the Rwandan army for killings at Kibeho camp
and said UN troops were failing to protect displaced Hutus.
Oxfam said in a statement that under its mandate, the 5500-strong UN
Assistance Mission in Rwanda should contribute to the security and
protection of civilians at risk in Rwanda including by establishing
secure humanitarian areas.
''Yet Unamir has failed to act on reports by Oxfam and other aid
agency staff that thousands of displaced people are being marched off by
the RGA (Rwandan Government Army),'' Oxfam said.
Meanwhile Britain, the third largest provider of humanitarian aid to
Rwanda, took a cautious line over apportioning blame for the refugee
camp massacre.
Baroness Chalker, head of the Overseas Development Administration,
backed the Rwandan Government policy of trying to clear the camps.
''These camps are full of Hutu extremists with weaponry who were
breaking out at night, terrorising the villages where people have gone
back and settled,'' she said.
Lady Chalker said it was vital for the Rwandan Government to restore
order around the camps, where weapons and extremists were still
prevalent.--Reuter.

G7 nations share the view that the dollar's volatile moves are not
desirable. Japan is currently working on a supplementary budget to help
stem the yen's rise.
Today also sees publication of the UK first-quarter GDP data and the
CBI's Quarterly Industrial Trends survey which will be keenly analysed
for signs of economic slowdown. Sterling ignored money supply data
showing strong growth in M4 and ended off earlier highs.
Against the mark, the pound dropped three-quarters of a pfennig to

CONFIRMATION that Howard Davies, currently director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, is to become deputy Governor of the
Bank of England on 11 September was warmly welcomed in the City. One
City economist, who preferred to remain anonymous, described Mr Davies
as ''extremely able'' and very good at working with people.
The #180,000 five-year appointment had been open knowledge over the
weekend. Mr Davies, aged 44, replaces Rupert Pennant-Rea who resigned
following embarassing disclosures in the press from one of his former
lovers, financial journalist Mary Ellen Synon.
The appointment of another deputy governor from outside the Bank was
almost a certainty although Mervyn King, the Bank's chief economist, was
a very strong internal candidiate. However internal politics coupled
with a desire to appoint someone who has experience of the real world
meant that an external candidate was chosen. Until recently there has
always been a feeling that the Bank does not care about the effects of
higher interest rates in the real economy.
Mr Davies has developed an informal relationship with Eddie George who
he has met on several occasions. This has been part of Mr George's
attempt to strike up a new dialogue on the economy with the industrial
community.
Among others thought to have been in the running for the
deputy-governorship were Peter Burt, managing director of the Bank of
Scotland and Rachel Lomax, an official at the World Bank who has worked
at the Treasury. Mr Davies has been at the CBI for three years where he
has won praise for his pragmatic approach to balancing the needs of
business with the wider community.
He played a leading role in the establishment of the Greenbury
Committee, the City of London group set up to probe top executives'
remuneration.
Mr Davies has had a high media profile whilst both at the CBI and the
Audit Commission. It is unlikely that Bank of England Governor Eddie
George will want him to have such high visibility in his new job. Only
yesterday Mr Davies said that there was no need for the authorities to
respond to sterling's weakness so far with an interest rate rise. ''We
(the CBI) currently feel that the inflation target can still be achieved
with the current monetary and fiscal conditions'' he said. However he
added that if the pound were to decline further he would expect a rise
in interest rates.
Mr Davies is known to be ''sound'' on money which is just as well
because Eddie George, a life-long Bank man, is a passionate believer in
low inflation. However the two men may not see eye to eye on Europe. Mr
Davies is thought to be keener on Britain playing a full role in Europe.
In contrast the term Euro-sceptic could be applied to Eddie George who
has made public pronouncements on the need for a cautious approach to
European economic and monetary union.
Before the CBI, Mr Davies worked at the Treasury and McKinsey, the
management consultants. His curriculum vitae should stand him in good
stead for the deputy-governorship which is basically an internal
administration role.
Mr Pennant-Rea won plaudits, at least outside the Bank of England, for
shaking up the organisation and introducing more modern management
practices. Banking supervision has been separated from the rest of the
Bank's activities and a change has taken place in the internal corporate
culture.
In the past in line with other civil servants there had been a
tendancy to assume a job for life. Under Pennant-Rea's restructuring
much of the dead wood at the top of the organisation has been weeded out
and there are signs that this is now happening lower down in the ranks.
Mr Davies' pleasant manner will undoubtedly be tested by Eddie George
who has a reputation for being dogmatic. Unfortunately the powers that
be will probably decide that Mr Davies has to ditch his bicycle and use
a chauffered car instead. One hopes that working within the confines of
the Bank will not stifle Mr Davies' sense of humour. On BBC Radio's
''Desert Island Discs'' he suggested perhaps having another baby with
his wife as his luxury.
Given the circumstances surrounding the departure of Mr Pennant-Rea,
the powers that be in government and at the Bank will undoubtedly be
relieved that Mr Davies appears to have a happy family life.

ONE of the most important home furnishing investments we make is
largely neglected -- due to the fact that once in place, it's walked
over.
Well-chosen carpeting, however, is an essential part of making the
home look good and feel comfortable. Not only do carpets give each room
a colour base, and therefore a mood, they help to muffle sound and
retain some of the estimated 15% heat lost through uninsulated floors.
Moving to a new home is the ideal opportunity to plan carpeting from
scratch. Working with bare floors and walls, it's easy to tailor the
look and gauge the quality of carpet required for each room. Modern
synthetic yarns give 10 to 15 years' use from a carpet, but most people
will change because they want a fresh look rather than to replace one
that's worn-out. Financial restrictions, however, will inevitably mean
that the decor will change a few times before the question of a new
carpet arises. That, above all, is why the choice should be carefully
considered.
There are two different types of carpet construction -- woven and
tufted -- which have their own distinct look and texture. In woven
carpets, the pile and backing materials are closely interwoven to
produce a high density carpet. All are produced by either the Axminster
or Wilton method and are usually referred to by those names.
Tufted carpets have the pile stitched into a pre-woven backing and
come in a variety of styles.
The volume of traffic through each part of the home is the first point
to ponder. The majority of households will take the carpet strain in the
hallway and on the stairs, especially when there are children involved.
A hard-wearing, self-coloured carpet which veers towards the darker end
of the spectrum is the best bet. Placing a doormat outside is no
guarantee that mucky shoes will always be wiped -- but a trail of mud
across a fluffy off-white carpet is a certainty to raise the temperature
of whoever does the cleaning.
Stair carpets will take the bulk of wear and tear straight down the
middle. It makes sense to carpet that central area, leaving the rest of
the stairs varnished or painted to match the woodwork in the hall.
Family rooms, such as the lounge, will also need a sufficiently
heavy-duty carpet to withstand pounding from thundering training shoes
or someone rolling around on the floor, playing with the family dog.
Achieving a balance here can be difficult -- this is the room which will
be on show to visitors most so dark grey industrial quality cord is
probably out. It's also the room in which the family relaxes, so the
comfort factor has to be high. Whether a self-coloured carpet or an
abstract pattern is favoured, it's important to keep cola spills or
upturned ashtrays in mind.
The feeling underfoot, which is the most luxurious part, will not be
dictated by the carpet but by the underlay. It's no myth that putting
down the best base will give your carpets a ''spring'' for much longer.
Good underlay will outlast the carpet, providing a firm foundation for
the next few choices. It also helps retain heat and acts as a shock
absorber, cushioning the carpet and prolonging its life by as much as
40%.
Floorcovering specialists will have a range of samples in stock to
walk on -- the salesman will also explain how each works and recommend
which will give the best service with your choice of carpet. Underlay
should never be treated as an optional extra or something only worth
spending a few extra pounds on, particularly if you have invested a good
sum of money in the carpet itself.
Professional fitters will also help to get the best from carpets,
working quickly and neatly, making sure that the carpet is
well-stretched without any noticeable seams. Most rooms should conform
to standard widths and shapes, but those who live in older buildings
which have unusual features, such as rounded rooms or alcoves, will need
advice on ''joins'' to avoid metres of waste.
There is scope for a little indulgence in the main bedroom which will
have relatively light traffic. A soft carpet will give an invigorating
bounce to help propel you through the first tentative steps of the day.
Children's and teenagers' bedrooms, however, are a different matter.
It's a fair bet that these will be more heavily used, with armies of
friends tramping back and forward. Where younger children may appreciate
a carpet with cartoon characters or bright primary colours, the
ever-changing moods and fads of teenage life will be best served with a
self-coloured carpet in a neutral tone.
Kitchen and bathroom floors have long been the domain of vinyl or
tiles but improvements in fibre technology have led to carpets which
suit all areas of the home. Made from materials which can absorb higher
amounts of moisture and have surfaces which are particularly
stain-repellent, they are ideal for those who prefer a little extra
warmth in these rooms.
Home fashion has moved from the cool elegance of the eighties, when
shades of grey were the carpet craze, to the homely feel of the nineties
when natural fabrics are taking hold. In response to a demand for
natural floorcoverings such as coir matting, seagrasses and jute, carpet
manufacturers have come up with their own versions, which give the
effect without the hard touch and stain-removal problems.
The carpet industry will continue to provide the latest colours and
looks combined with quality and durability to give maximum service.

muffle

through floorboards
Prepare a
clear plan
THERE will be a clear mental picture of how you want a room to look --
and laying the right carpet sets the mood.
Once you have an idea of colour, choose the right pile according to
touch and feel and the room will quickly begin to shape up.
Before venturing out to choose a carpet, make a sketch of the room
showing the measurements and positions of doors, windows and any
recesses. The salesman will need to have a good idea of the size and
shape of the room before giving a price guide. For a more precise
costing, however, someone will be sent out to measure accurately.
The lighting in any shop will be radically different to that of your
home so make sure to check colours in natural light and if there's still
an element of doubt, ask to see a sample in your home.
If underlay is required, be sure to test a few and order it with the
carpet. Any special requests, such as the removal of old carpets, should
be made when fitting is arranged. It's also important to think about who
will move heavy pieces of furniture if you're not fit enough or able to
do it.
Fashion in home furnishing changes almost as quickly as the clothing
industry, the massive range of colours and textures in any shop will
show that, but a durable carpet lasts much longer than a passing fad.
Keep this in mind and choose a colour or design that will co-ordinate
with a variety of wallpapers and curtains.
Take your time in making final decisions as, properly sited, a carpet
will give years of warmth and comfort to the home.

NOT surprisingly, things have started to move at Broadleys Industrial
Park, the latest manifestation of Central Regional Council's
determination to attract companies and jobs to its area.
One new company has just moved into this attractively landscaped
Stirling estate and another is negotiating to take over one of its large
industrial units. Now the council is pushing ahead on the provision of
infrastructure for further speculative development.
It is hard to believe that the site was farmland little more than a
year ago. Used as grazing land for the well-known Broadleys Farm on the
outskirts of the town, it was designated for industrial use in late
1993.
The regional council then started developing it, building roads,
putting in the services, and building the first phase of two 10,000 sqft
units. It represented an investment of #750,000 but the park, completed
only late last year, is already in use.
Blue Box Design Ltd, a new company specialising in the design and
manufacture of presentation boxes, went into operation earlier this
month, taking half of one of the two 10,000 sq ft units already
constructed by the regional council.
It was, says John Shaw, Head of Property Services for Central Regional
Council, attracted largely by the location of Broadleys. ''It is on the
eastern side of Stirling on the Kerse Road, adjacent to the Eastern
Distributor Road. That means fast access to the M9, M876, and M80.'' he
says.
''Glasgow is a 35-minute drive, with Edinburgh only about 45 minutes
away. These cities' airports are also within easy reach. And the
amenities and workforce of Stirling itself -- and its InterCity rail
station -- are less than two miles away, with local buses stopping
opposite the industrial park.''
Central Regional Council is well aware of the advantages of being
literally at the centre of things and makes the most of them in its
drive to attract companies and jobs. The units at Broadleys are finished
to a high standard and last year a BMW dealership opened its own
operation at another part of the park, a self-build unit which was
another affirmation of the attractiveness of the location.
Now it has been joined by Blue Box Design Ltd, a start-up company
which has already gone into production and design of presentation boxes
and other paper-based products. The whisky and gift industries are among
its major customers.
Managing director Angela Fraioli is enthusiastic about the design of
the 5000 sqft unit her company has secured at a favourable rent from the
regional council.
She and her fellow directors -- design director Duncan Robertson and
production director Peter McElroy -- are also to be given the services
of a marketing consultant, courtesy of a subsidy from the council, and
the company will qualify for a grant for each employee it recruits from
the Stirling area.
''We are delighted with our unit and with the flexibility and support
shown to us by Central Region,'' she says. ''The location is also
first-class.''
Stirling can claim that 95% of Scotland's manufacturing base is within
a 35-mile radius, and within easy reach of Grangemouth's port
facilities.
Responsibility for the new industrial park will no doubt be assumed by
the new unitary authority when it takes over from the present two-tier
councils in April of next year, and when Broadleys' 65 acres are fully
developed it will be a powerful employment focus for the people of
Stirling.
All of its units are built with flexibility and adaptability in mind,
with an area of expansion ground provided for each one, and the
buildings tailored to meet individual requirements. The regional council
has also proved easy to deal with when it comes to terms.
''We are not exactly a dying council,'' says Graham Scott. ''The work
of providing suitable advance units for modern industry is too important
for there to be any let-up. We are confident that Broadleys Industrial
Park will prove of significant benefit to the people of Stirling as they
move into a new era of local government.''
With its combination of location, transport links, quality of
buildings, and regional-council back-up, Broadleys Industrial Park seems
destined to play an important role at the very heart of Scotland's
business environment.

IF money makes the world go round, it might come as a surprise to know
that there is a straight route to one's financial objectives.
Free and expert advice on investments of all kinds is available at
Save &amp; Invest's two investment shops in Glasgow and Edinburgh and its
head office in Glasgow's West Regent Street.
And there is nothing circuitous about the service offered by managing
director Jeffrey Deans and his 40 staff: the help is direct, straight to
the point, and based on years of securing the right investment packages
for people's individual needs.
There is nothing to be gained, for example, from traipsing along High
Streets to see what the latest building-society rates might be. Save &amp;
Invest has that information, and more, available on computer or by fax,
updated day by day.
There is nothing to be achieved by approaching investment-product
providers direct. Going to Save &amp; Invest not only removes the hassle and
even the possibility of rejection but can also result in specially
negotiated discounts, due to the adviser's purchasing power and
contacts.
And there is nothing to be feared from going into one of its shops, in
Glasgow's Hope Street or Edinburgh's Lothian Road. Not only is the
atmosphere welcoming and informal, and the sales pitch noticeable only
for its absence, but the service costs nothing.
Also, around 30% of the funds going through the company go to
investments which bring Save &amp; Invest nothing in commission.
The beauty of a visit to this company is that the potential investor
has entered a no-pressure world where the whole range of financial
products is opened up.
Save &amp; Invest has its finger on the button and is not tied to any
bank, insurance company, investment trust, building society, or other
product provider.
''Someone who has just taken retirement or early severance from a job
might ask: Should I put some in a building society, a Tessa, a PEP, or
National Savings?'' says Jeffrey Deans. ''The answer could well be yes
to all four. But the trick is to know in what proportions, and which
investments to choose.
''There's not much point in blindly accepting the advice of, say, your
bank once it has been alerted to the fact that a large sum has been
deposited in your account.
'' Its particular product might be the best for you, but there again
it might not. So why not come to an independent adviser who is highly
trained, is in touch with the broad investment scene, and who has no axe
to grind?''
Deans is glad to report that Save &amp; Invest was recently named by the
country's biggest financial institution as one of the top 25 independent
financial advisers in the UK, and that his consultants have been
recommended by a large number of Scottish concerns to their employees.
The Herald is one of them, as are ScotRail, ICI at Ardeer, and Glasgow
District Council. He makes the point that his company is Scottish, and
uses Scottish suppliers wherever possible. ''So why send money to
America or to American-owned set-ups?'' he asks.
He finds that clients' needs vary, with some seeking the new range of
guaranteed investments, others wishing advice on taxation matters such
as a wife's income allowance, and others wanting the maximum monthly
income from their lump sum to make up for loss of regular earnings.
Most people's requirements are a mixture of all the above, and Deans
and his team recommend household names such as the Prudential, Standard
Life, M &amp; G, and National Savings as well as leading fund management
groups people may not have heard of such as Schroder, Fidelity, and
Murray Johnstone.
Save &amp; Invest takes pride in the level of client satisfaction
achieved, as witnessed by the fact that nearly 65% of its business comes
from people who have already engaged its services, with 25% of its
referrals from existing customers.
What is the procedure if you have a lump sum or other investment
requirement and you go into a Save &amp; Invest shop? The answer is simple:
you encounter a friendly and professional atmosphere and end up with a
lot of free advice. And that applies whether you have #20,000 to invest
or have just perhaps sold a business and have #500,000 or more.
The chances are that after an initial consultation you will be asked
to spend about an hour with Jeffrey Deans or one of his consultants,
outlining your requirements and expectations. The meeting can take place
at a Save &amp; Invest office or at your own home: either way it could turn
out to be the most valuable 60 minutes of your life.
There is no obligation -- and neither is there any when a
personally-tailored investment plan arrives in the post a few days
later. It sets out the mix of investments seen as the best answer to the
aims which have been set out. It also outlines what the investor can
expect by way of income, growth, security, and tax efficiency.
After that, it is up to you to decide whether to go ahead. Should the
answer be in the affirmative, Save &amp; Invest organises the paperwork,
helps with any queries, negotiates discounts where appropriate, and
generally smoothes the path.
Nor does its service end there: for a small annual fee it monitors the
whole investment package, carries out an annual review, and advises the
client on any changes it might think beneficial, particularly in the
light of any new investment opportunities that might have arisen.
One example of this in recent weeks might well be a guaranteed
investment plan which offers 7.3% net annual return on one's capital,
with all your money back at the end of the investment term. That
compares with less than 5% net from most high-interest building society
accounts and the original capital is just as safe.
''People should come to us first,'' says Jeffrey Deans. ''If they do,
they will soon see the benefit of expert and independent advice.''

A JOINT consultative committee, representing all sections of the
potato industry in Britain, has agreed detailed proposals for a new
organisation to replace the Potato Marketing Board when it is wound up.
The existing Potato Marketing scheme will end after the 1996/97 crop
year to allow a free market in potatoes. The consultative committee has
indicated its belief that the onus will be on the Government to ensure
that a free and fair market in potatoes is maintained within the
European Union so that the British industry is not disadvantaged.
The committee has also pledged that the new potato organisation will
support the Government in taking action through the EU to ensure that
state aids do not distort the market.
It is envisaged that the main functions of the new body should
include: promoting the orderly marketing of potatoes; research and
development; market development; identification of export opportunities
and providing a forum for discussion involving producers, retailers and
consumers.
Most of the funds for the new body will come from annual
contributions. It is likely that the main source of financing will, at
least initially, be a levy paid by growers. The consultative committee
has recommended that in setting a level of financing, account should be
taken of the need to meet competition from other countries and from
other commodities such as rice or pasta.
It is suggested that the new organisation should come under the
direction of a relatively small board with no more than 15 members.
Producer members would be elected by registered producers. Others would
be selected and nominated by organisations with an interest in the
potato industry.
Extensive representation would not be possible and large numbers would
lead to less effective policy making, says the committee. Provision
should be made, however, for organisations representing the industry to
be consulted periodically.
Meanwhile, the board has introduced an updated planting return
designed to fit in easily with other returns already being made by
arable farmers.
Information will now be required field by field. The board suggests
that it would be convenient to fill in the new return along with the
Integrated Area Compensation Scheme form. Both forms use the same
ordnance survey map references and national grid field number systems.
John Collins, head of information services at the PMB, said it would
no longer be necessary for producers with land in more than one county
to submit separate returns. The new forms will be issued this week and
are due to be returned by May 15.

AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave yesterday said he was
immensely impressed with the scale of the Scottish participation in the
International Food Exhibiton at Earls Court in London.
The products on show, he said, demonstrated Scotland's strong
tradition in agriculture and its international reputation for quality in
both food and drink.
The Minister had a special word of commendation for Orkney Meat which
chose the show as the launchpad for a new marketing strategy under the
banner Orkney Island Gold. This new label is aimed at quality retail
butchers in South-east England. It will not be sold through the
multiples or supermarket chains.
Rob Crichton, assistant manager of Orkney Meat, said that Orkney
Island Gold meat would be produced from only the finest stock, matured
on the bone for a minimum of 10 days to ensure tenderness and taste no
matter the cut.
''Our research shows that there is a market in the south of England
for premium quality traditional beef,'' said Mr Crichton. ''We are
targeting that market initially but our eventual aim is to cover the
whole of the UK.''
The Minister had particularly commended their involvement in farm
assurance, giving traceability right back to the primary producer, he
said.
The umbrella organisation Orkney Quality Food and Drink brought seven
companies to the exhbition including the Claymore Creamery from Kirkwall
who won a gold medal for its mild cheddar. On two previous occasions at
London the company has taken gold for their mature cheddar.
The Kingdom Cheese Company from Cowdenbeath won a bronze medal for its
cottage cheese. The company produces about 20 tonnes a week and claims
to be Scotland's premier manufacturer of cottage cheese, low fat and
full fat soft cheeses.
Brewers Maclay of Alloa won a silver award for its oatmeal stout.
Grampian Oat Products of Banff, a subsidiary of North Eastern Farmers,
were putting much effort into attracting overseas buyers especially from
Europe. The company already exports in bulk to Malaysia and the Far East
where its oats products are used as a general cereal. The firm draws its
supplies form more than 500 farmers throughout Scotland.
One of the new products on show came from Green Meadow Foods which,
from its base at the Motherwell Food Park, produces 120,000 sandwiches a
week for outlets such as Tesco, Littlewoods, John Menzies, and
Debenhams. The company also supplies catering companies, colleges and
hospitals.
Its new line is the ''hotwich'' -- based on an Italian ciabatta bread
roll which can be cooked to order in the microwave. Fillings include
smoked ham and cheese or tomato, fresh onions, cheese and herbs. The
company is currently looking at the possibilities for appointing local
suppliers to provide the ingredients for this Italian-inspired
innovation.
The exhibition, now established as a major event of its kind
internationally, attracted 1300 exhibitors. Thirty five countries set up
national pavilions and of these Scotland had the largest with 73 firms
represented. Scottish participation was organised by Highlands and
Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Enterprise food team.
Kevin Gruer, marketing development manager for HIE, said that Mr
Waldegrave had been impressed by the way Scottish food was being
promoted -- emphasising quality and regional identity.

PRICE competition remained fierce in the first half at Associated
British Foods with the resilience and strength of British Sugar
responsible for the improvement in operating profits, writes ANDREW
WILSON.
Income rose from #9m to #26m because of a better return from the
investment portfolio which amounted to a little changed #772m as at the
beginning of March. During the previous year, Associated British Foods
had been hard hit by the fall in bond prices after the increases in US
interest rates.
However, that was more than offset by the reduced surplus on the sale
of some of the remaining holding in Berisford. That brought in just #7m
compared with #22m a year earlier.
The net result was that pre-tax profits eased 4.5% to #173m.
The market reacted by knocking 16p off the shares by the close at
638p. That reflected disappointment with the low return on cash and that
the diversification programme has not yet been substantial enough to
improve the overall return on capital to any significant extent.
British Sugar was helped in its 9% improvement by a good beet
processing season and sales of last year's surplus stocks into export
markets.
The interim dividend has been held at 8.5p with the indication being
that there will be a small increase in the second interim of 1p for a
17p total and a 3.3% yield.

MEMORY Corporation, a Scottish hi-tech company that has found a way to
correct faults in computer memory chips, said yesterday it would start
production of its invention in June and was on target to make a 1995
pre-tax profit of #3.8m.
Since its launch in 1993, the Dalkeith-based company has invested
#2.5m in developing the Partial Memory Engine (PME), a finger nail-sized
chip that can correct errors in millions of faulty computer memory chips
that are turned out by factories each year.
These chips, known as DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memory devices) are
used to build the memory boards of personal computers and provide
upgrades for them.
DRAMs are produced to uniform specifications in such large quantities
that there is even a futures market for them in Chicago, but around 60%
prove faulty and are discarded before leaving the factory.
Memory Corporation says it can correct the errors in nearly all these
defective DRAMs and make them even more reliable than factory-approved
new ones, enabling the doctored chips to command a price premium of
about 5%.
The company was founded by Alex Deas, a 35-year-old Scottish computer
expert who stumbled on the technology to correct errors in memory chips
two years ago while doing other research.
An injection of #1m of venture capital from the Danish-American firm
2M Invest and #3.5m raised in a stock market flotation have enabled him
to bring the concept to the threshold of commercial production.
Mr Deas, who is chairman of Memory Corporation, told the company's AGM
in Edinburgh yesterday that the firm's invention had been thoroughly
developed and tested and had been successfully fabricated in large
quantities in a trial run for mass production.
Chief executive Cameron McColl said demand for complete computer
memory modules known as SIMMs (Single In Line Memory Modules) remained
strong and had been buoyed up by the yen's spectacular rise against the
dollar.
Mr McColl reiterated earlier forecasts of a ''modest'' fall in prices
in the second half of this year, but said the company was confident that
it would meet the 1995 pre-tax profit estimate of #3.8m outlined in the
prospectus.
The chief executive said he expected sales to reach #12m this year and
expand rapidly in 1996.
Memory Corporation employs less than 30 people and all its
manufacturing is out-sourced to a sub-contractor in Germany. The firm
also plans to produce its corrected chips in the US.
Mr Deas said this was because no computer manufacturer in Scotland's
Silicon Glen appeared capable of undertaking the work at present.
Mr McColl said: ''This remains an early stage hi-tech company and
investors should be aware that there are high risk factors involved,''
citing possible production delays and unexpected changes in demand.
But investors have given Memory Corporation a strong vote of
confidence since the flotation of eight million shares, about 13.5% of
its equity, in December. The company's shares rose from 45p at flotation
to trade at up to 160p on the unlisted securities market last week.

MEMBERS of the National &amp; Provincial could be the building society
investors and borrowers next in line for a cash windfall as a result of
a takeover approach from Abbey National, the former building society
which is now a publicly quoted bank.
Abbey said it wanted to talk to N&amp;P about a possible bid as it
believed a combined group would make ''sound strategic sense''. The
group would be prepared to offer N&amp;P members a ''substantial premium to
net asset value.''
There was no immediate reaction from N&amp;P. The bid approach follows
Lloyds Bank's purchase of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and Halifax's merger
with Leeds Permanent.
Assuming a deal is reached, it is likely to mean a payout of hundreds
of pounds to each member.
There will almost certainly be no point people rushing round to open
accounts with N&amp;P because the qualification date for the payment from
Abbey National will be set before today. But those with accounts or
mortgages would be well advised not to disturb them and to keep say #500
in share accounts, which are the accounts which determine membership of
the society.
N&amp;P is the ninth largest society, with total assets of nearly #13bn,
and three million customers. It is one of the largest in Scotland, with
eight branches in Glasgow, six in Edinburgh, and 24 in central Scotland
in total.
Abbey has 50 in Scotland and while there would be an overlap created
by a few branches -- both institutions have nearby outlets in Dumbarton
Road, Glasgow and Morningside Road in Edinburgh -- the two networks do
not greatly impinge on each other. Nationally Abbey is strong in
southern England, N&amp;P more in the north.
An Abbey spokesman said that achieving economies through rationalising
networks was not the point of the deal. Rather it would improve service
to customers by offering them a greater choice of high quality branches.
However, National &amp; Provincial's life and investment division in
Edinburgh could be more at risk given Abbey's ownership of Scottish
Mutual.
Abbey has been eyeing N&amp;P for years and actually had talks with the
society at the time of its proposed merger with Leeds Permanent in 1993.
It only made yesterday's announcement after weekend press speculation
about a possible merger had prompted its shares to strengthen. It also
wanted to make the position clear before N&amp;P's annual meeting tomorrow.
Abbey is unlikely to bid without receiving the approval of the N&amp;P
board, though the latter would be under pressure from members eager to
receive a windfall to agree to an offer. Abbey would not want to
alienate its top management which is one of the society's attractions.
With its honeybee emblem as its marketing tool, National &amp; Provincial
has diversified into a wide range of financial services, including home
insurance, in a similar way to Abbey, which maintains that their
respective managements think along similar lines.
Despite an innovatory style, N&amp;P is one of the medium-sized societies
vulnerable to takeover as the financial services industry coalesces into
larger units. It falls between two stools, being too large to develop a
regional niche but too small to have the resources to become a
fully-fledged financial services group.
National &amp; Provincial has had the For Sale sign on it since the
collapse of the plan to merge with the Leeds Permanent, which also
allowed the field clear for Halifax to merge with the Leeds Permanent.
The failure resulted from a clash of cultures between the two, with
N&amp;P's drive for change and innovation contrasting with the steadier,
conservative image of Leeds Permanent.
In fact, the N&amp;P style owed much to its chief executive at the time,
David O'Brien, who was subsequently ousted a year later. He would
undoubtedly have continued to oppose a takeover by Abbey National, which
had to wait until his departure before trying again.

IVORY &amp; Sime's Enterprise Capital investment trust yesterday expressed
high hopes for venture funding in the UK, as it announced a 2% increase
in half-way net asset value to 119.0p.
Formed in September 1993 from the reconstruction of the Independent
Investment Company, the trust's performance in the six months to
end-March was similar to that of its benchmark NatWest Venture Capital
index, which appreciated 2.9%.
Since its formation, the net asset value of Edinburgh-based Enterprise
Capital, which rose 15% to 116.7p in the year to last September, has
increased by 19%.
Over the same period, the NatWest index rose 14%, with the FTSE
All-Share index up 2%.
During the six months, the #76m predominantly UK and US fund realised
$9.4m (#5.9m) from the sale of its major American holding, Read-Rite.
The proceeds are being invested primarily in the UK development capital
markets.
Contemplating the outlook for UK venture investment, Ivory &amp; Sime's
business development director, Gordon Neilly, said: ''I think we are
starting to see some encouraging results coming from some of the
invested companies. We are actually very hopeful now.''
* EDINBURGH Japan will more than double in size, after realising about
#21.1m before expenses from a conversion share issue.
The #17m Edinburgh Fund Managers investment trust, which was launched
in July 1992, announced yesterday that it had conditionally placed 19.75
million of the 20 million #1 shares it had hoped to issue to
institutional investors and fund managers. In response to its #10m open
offer, #1.34m worth of acceptances were received.
Shareholders approved the issue of the conversion shares at an
extraordinary general meeting yesterday.

Washington, Monday
PRESIDENT Clinton today called on Americans to speak out against
inflammatory political rhetoric in the wake of the Oklahoma bombing, a
crime suspected to be the work of right-wing anti-government extremists.
''When you hear people say things they are legally entitled to say, if
you think they're outrageous, if you think they either explicitly or
implicitly encourage violence and division . . . then your free speech
and your responsibility requires you to speak up against it,'' he said.
His remarks came amid reports of another bombing, this time a letter
bomb sent to a timber-industry office in Sacramento, California. First
reports said one person was killed.
There is probably no connection between this incident and the Oklahoma
City bombing. Instead, it may be the latest attack by the figure known
as the ''Unabomber', a secretive assassin believed to have sent 17
letter bombs in 15 years, killing two people.
Mr Clinton, arriving in Iowa for a conference on rural problems,
criticised reckless talk in the US, continuing a theme he has struck
since attending yesterday's memorial service for victims of the bombing.
More than 80 people were killed in the blast, including at least a
dozen children in a day care centre.
A 27-year-old former soldier decorated for service in the Gulf War,
Timothy McVeigh, was arrested for planting the two-ton truck bomb that
blew apart a federal office building in Oklahoma City.
Two other men with links to right-wing paramilitary groups are being
held for questioning. Today police in Georgia questioned a man said to
have been driving a car with licence plates being sought by the FBI, but
he was later released.
Mr Clinton has suggested that attacks on the government aired on
right-wing talk radio shows can create a climate of violence that
results in incidents like the Oklahoma bombing.
Earlier in Minneapolis, he denounced ''loud and angry voices in
America'' that spread hatred.
''They spread hate, they leave the impression by their very words that
violence is acceptable. I'm sure you're now seeing the reports of some
of the things that are regularly said over the airwaves today. Well,
people like that who want to share our freedoms must know that their
bitter words can have consequences,'' he said.
Meanwhile, rescuers who have worked for 100 hours seeking survivors in
the wrecked Alfred Murra building are now approaching what they call
''the pit'', where they expect to find the bodies of up to 150 people
still missing.
No survivor has been found in the rubble since the first night of the
effort, and Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen agreed that finding anyone
alive now would be a miracle.
Today baby Baylee Almon, whose photograph in the arms of a firefighter
was carried by newspapers and television around the world, was buried
amid tears, flowers, teddy bears, and toy lambs.
Firefighter Chris Fields, who tenderly carried the fatally wounded
child from the wreckage a day after her first birthday, was among the
mourners.

THE Scotch Whisky Association crossed swords with its guest of honour,
European Commission director general of customs and indirect taxation
Peter Wilmott, at its annual general meeting yesterday in Glasgow.
Mr Wilmott, the civil servant who advises the new commissioner
responsible for excise duties, Italian academic Mario Monti, told
industry chiefs in no uncertain terms that he would be advising his
commissioner not to make any proposals to extend the duty-free regime
beyond 1999.
He added: ''I shall be quite pleased if the bargains continue to exist
until they are abolished but in my view they will be abolished at the
end of June 1999.''
Mr Wilmott argued that the economic and political logic existed for an
end to the duty-free system within the internal market set-up.
However, his comments were at odds with the view of The Scotch Whisky
Association, which sees no rationale for such a move given the wide
variation in duties on different alcoholic drinks across member states.
The European duty-free market is the sixth largest for Scotch and is
worth between #60m and #80m each year.
Making a tongue-in-cheek reference to the powerful European wine
lobby, association vice-chairman Sandy Grant Gordon, chairman of
Glenfiddich group William Grant, saw no reason for an end to duty-free
''until such times as the wine of Scotland (whisky) is taxed at the same
rate as that of our continental neighbours''.
Mr Wilmott also ruffled feathers by arguing for a change in the voting
system on excise duties, favouring majority rather than unanimous
decisions.
This would prevent the UK Government using its veto to block a
decision which discriminated against Scotch.
Whisky chiefs were more understanding about the time it is taking the
European Commission to review excise duties within the internal market.
Mr Wilmott did not believe a forthcoming report by the new group of
commissioners considering the issue would recommend a tax on wine.
However, he added: ''Equally it will say that -- because wine is not
taxed in seven member states and because wine is in competition to a
greater or lesser extent in pretty much all member states with other
alcoholic drinks -- it is not appropriate to make changes in the minimum
rates of duty for other alcoholic drinks.''
Mr Wilmott said the issue of tax on wine would ultimately have to be
put on the table, to see how people reacted to the idea.
The whisky industry celebrated its 500th anniversary last year with
record exports of nearly #2200m, as illustrated by the chart.
However, The Scotch Whisky Association said Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke's decision to put 26p on a bottle in December's mini-Budget had
devastated the home market since the start of the year.
Chairman James Bruxner, who urged association members to lobby MPs on
the issue, pointed out that the Treasury's estimate of revenue receipts
from spirits both before and after the 4% duty rise was #1700m.
Citing the fact that half of spirits sold and consumed in Europe come
from the UK, he added: ''Until the Treasury recognises the damage tax
discrimination at home has on exports, we shall be left fighting for
market share on a playing field described recently as being as level as
the slopes of Mount Fuji.''

<HEADLINE>#9000m bid for Wellcome adds to lending figures.  Glaxo distorts money supply</HEADLINE>

IT IS necessary to be a very big corporate player to distort money
supply figures in the way that Glaxo did last month.
The City was caught on the hop yesterday when M4 lending by banks and
building societies to the private sector in March emerged at #8500m
against expectations of #4600m.
But a heavy proportion of Glaxo's #9000m bid for Wellcome was financed
by bank borrowing. It would appear that this added around #6000m to the
M4 lending figure.
The bulk of the money was raised from overseas banks with only two of
the eight-strong consortium being UK-based. The British Bankers'
Association painted a much weaker picture with net lending of #1160m.
Overall M4 growth was also swollen by the Glaxo bid, the largest in
British corporate history. The Bank of England estimated that this added
about 1% to M4. Excluding Glaxo, M4 would have increased by around 0.5%
on the month and 4.5% on the year rather than the 1.4% and 5.5% actually
recorded.
The British Bankers' figures show that they lent #1250m (about #600m
if Glaxo is excluded) to manufacturers in the first quarter. This
compares with quarterly repayments so far throughout the recovery.
James Capel's Adam Cole said that the overall picture (including
overseas banks who are rapidly increasing their market share) ''is
probably considerably stronger than this.
''The data provide further evidence that manufacturers are finally
beginning to increase investment after a very disappointing performance
so far in the recovery.''
Moreover rights issues in the first quarter amounted to #1400m, an
increase on both the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Broad money figures are in the bottom half of their 3% to 9%
monitoring range and have little significance in the context of monetary
policy.
Separate figures from the Building Societies' Association showed sharp
increases, mainly seasonal, in mortgage lending between February and
March.
Gross mortgage lending rose from #2279m to #3193m against #3135m in
March last year. Net advances jumped from #542m to #1067m against #960m
a year earlier. Net new commitments rose to #3666m from #2697m against
#3746m in March 1994.
''Building society net lending over the first quarter of 1995 was 1%
higher than in the same period in 1994, but 5% lower than in the final
quarter of 1994,'' said the associations's head of research and external
affairs, Peter Williams.
''Gross lending followed a similar pattern. Although the decline in
lending over the last quarter is largely seasonal, it is encouraging to
note that the 36% increase in net new commitments in March is
significantly higher than in the same period last year.
''The very sharp increase in net lending in March is very welcome and
reflects the traditional upturn in housing in the spring. However, it is
too early to say whether it is indicative of a recovery in the market.
March figures could simply be reflecting increased building society
market share.''
Outside commentators latched on to the fact net new commitments were
lower than in March last year.
Summing up all the data, Cole said, ''Company borrowing is clearly
turning up, household borrowing for consumption is moving ahead, and the
housing market is as flat as a pancake.''
One encouraging feature of the building society figures was the net
inflow of funds of #520m in March against #519m in February. This was
the ninth successive inflow and was particularly welcome to the
societies as March is normally a month when coffers are raided by
withdrawals to meet PEP deadlines.

<HEADLINE>British nuclear ship is refused entry to Japan</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978714816</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Mutsu Ogawara, Tuesday
THE governor of northern Japan's Aomori prefecture today refused to
allow the entry of a British nuclear ship carrying radioactive waste
which arrived off Aomori port after a two-month voyage from France.
''We cannot accept this vague explanation from the government (on
future nuclear storage),'' governor Morio Kimura told a news conference.
''I have decided not to allow the ship to enter port.''
The freighter Pacific Pintail, carrying 14 tonnes of radioactive
waste, was scheduled to berth around dawn at Mutsu Ogawara port on the
northern tip of Japan's main island, Honshu. Instead, the ship is
waiting two miles off the coast.
Its cargo is a by-product of Japanese spent fuel which has been
reprocessed at a French plant. Kimura said he could not accept the
Science and Technology Agency's explanation that the nuclear waste would
be transferred to an unspecified location in 50 years.
The port, specifically designed for nuclear freighters, was under
tight security with hundreds of police on duty. Scores of anti-nuclear
activists were also gathered outside the port, flying banners and
chanting anti-nuclear slogans.
Demonstrators say the 14 tonnes of waste is so dangerous that just
touching it is enough to kill.
Flights over the port have been banned in case of an accident.
About 1000 demonstrators have camped in the area for days, awaiting
the end of the ship's voyage from Cherbourg.
Greenpeace says this is the most dangerous shipment ever made and 35
nations refused the vessel passage through their waters on its voyage.
Yesterday, a protester eluded the cordon and tied himself to a 60ft
crane for unloading the cargo. Hundreds of anti-nuclear protesters lined
roads near the port.
The toxic waste is in 28 stainless steel canisters and mixed with
glass.
One minute of exposure at a distance of one yard would be lethal,
Greenpeace says.--Reuter.

A major new Charles Rennie
Mackintosh exhibition being planned
for Glasgow next year, will later tour
in America, reports Clare Henry
AS furniture conservator Andrew Stone showed me Charles Rennie
Mackintosh's newly reassembled White Dining Room, he said: ''It's a
miracle it's survived. There are literally thousands of pieces -- like a
giant jigsaw. Despite the fact that these bits of old wood have been
moved from store to store eight times over 24 years, we've only lost a
couple of pieces.
''
The White Dining Room started life in 1900 as part of miss Cranston's
Ingram Street Tea Rooms. After a chequered life, and magically restored
to pristine white and silver glory, it will form the highlight of a
major Mackintosh exhibition opening in 1996 in Glasgow before touring to
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Two years and #100,000 into restoration, there is still a long way to
go. ''It's wonderful to see the room brought back to life. We're
learning more about Mackintosh all the time. Some panels are in fact
silver aluminium, not white. In the old photographs you can't tell,''
Pamela Robertson, the exhibition curator told me, from her base at the
Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow. Robertson began her work
on Mackintosh in 1977, and rejoices at this opportunity for the full
spectrum of his genius to be shown.
The Glasgow show will be in the McLellan Galleries. ''We plan to
follow the story of his life chronologically from Glasgow to London,
Walberswick, and finally France. It's a powerful linear narrative and
forms the spine of the show.
''His work is so diverse -- you can't compartmentalise him. He can be
modernist or gothic. We want to show this multifaceted quality and range
of material.'' The display of 350 exhibits includes 70 pieces of
furniture, six large-scale models of his masterpieces: Glasgow School of
Art, Scotland Street School, Hillhouse and the Mackintosh House,
together with films of these buildings for the American market.
There have been several Mackintosh exhibitions since the first,
fabulous presentation at the 1968 Edinburgh Festival, orchestrated by
Professor McLaren Young. The most recent was in Japan in 1985 and in
Italy in 1988, but there's never been anything on this scale -- and it's
occupying a lot of people on both sides of the Atlantic. Then there's
the book, published in New York, with contributions from 10 authors.
Ten days ago, 10 American curators and organisers came to Glasgow to
sign the official agreement of the million pound budget show. The 350
exhibits have been selected by Robertson (only 220 will travel to the
US) and the exhibition layout and sequence sketched out.
Explains Robertson: ''Ours is the first serious attempt to paint the
full picture; to open people's eyes to the real Mackintosh. But it's
going to be difficult to accommodate both Scottish visitors with a
specialist knowledge and America's largely ignorant general audience.
Architect David Page, who is acting as design consultant, is well
aware that Mackintosh's reassessment may prove controversial. ''He's one
of the world's greatest artists, so of course there's a great local
protectionism. You couldn't pick a more fraught subject.''
Much energy and thought has gone into the exhibition layout. ''We
don't want a predictable, safe, dull line of objects, a parade of
drawings, furniture, watercolours, metalwork and such like from 1888 to
1927. It's time to go further than that: to look at the ideas behind his
designs; the precise geometry of his buildings and their symbolism. We
aim to capture the fundamentals.''
Page believes Hill House is especially revealing. ''It's an astounding
metaphor for love, life and death -- not just a dwelling house but a
temple; a house of God. It's profound stuff. We need to argue things in
strategic terms; find the relevance of Mackintosh to us today; raise the
level of debate. ''
Some Mackintosh admirers are bound to find this reassessment
discomforting.The reality is, says Robbins, ''Mackintosh was like a shop
fitter. It's all facing and dressing. As long as it looked OK he was
happy.''
Stone's tearoom restoration job has not been helped by Mackintosh's
shoddy workmanship. ''It was all made of the cheapest wood battered
together with no joints, no dovetailing -- just nails. There was no
construction: no craftsmanship. The coloured glass was in fact often
just clear glass painted on the back.''
Mackintosh's memorial exhibition in 1933 received little interest. If
his friend and patron William Davidson had not stepped in when the
auctioneers valued the estate at #88.16.2d, (four chairs = #1), even
sheltering it in his basement, the bulk of this UK-American blockbuster
show would be gone.
The American curators were plainly delighted with what they saw in
Glasgow, and with the show's progress. Lesley Bowman from LA County
Museum told me: ''Things are at a critical brewing stage, so we came to
see how it's cooking. It looks fabulous! The White Dining Room is all we
hoped for and more.''
Chicagans have the advantage of ''architectural savey'' says Ian
Wardropper of Chicago's Art Institute. ''As the home town of
Mackintosh's close contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright, we are interested to
see how they measure up. It's an expensive show but worth the money.
Some architectural shows are a little dry, but this one has texture and
richness. To walk into a real space like the White Dining Room should
wake people up! We are so looking forward to welcoming Mackintosh to
America.''
The Mackintosh of the end of the twentieth century is still being sold
as a genius, but a more complex, rigorous, less decorative artist -- one
whose work has a deep philosophical structure. ''The exhibition will
embody values which are greater than the individual pieces, say the
curators. Andrew Stone may privately disagree. For him The White Dining
Room will surely be the star.
Charles Rennie Mackintosh: Architect, Designer, Artist, at the
McLellan Galleries, Glasgow, May 25 -- September 30, 1996 and touring
America 1996-97, is sponsored by Whyte &amp; Mackay, and the Glasgow Art
School models are sponsored by Americans, Donald and Eleanor Taffner.

THE profitability of Scottish companies improved dramatically during
the first three months of this year, outperforming the rest of the UK,
the CCN business information group said in its latest quarterly survey
of Britain's 1000 largest firms outside the financial sector.
But CCN warned that throughout the UK companies were paying out higher
dividends at the expense of much-needed investment and the rate of
growth throughout the economy was slowing.
''Profitability among Scottish companies underperformed the UK as a
whole by a considerable margin last year, but the situation has reversed
completely over the last three months,'' said David Coates, the managing
director of CCN Business Information.
''Return on capital employed is up by more than half to over 10% and
pre-tax margins have almost doubled to 7.8%, well above the national
average of 6.6%, he added.
Return on capital in Scotland was 10.2% compared to a UK average of
9.8% in the first quarter, while debt gearing in Scotland had dropped
from 70% a year ago to the UK average of around 50%, he added.
But Mr Coates warned that UK industry was boosting dividends without
ploughing enough money back into new plant and equipment.
''Rather than relying on an export-led recovery and restoring
dividends to pre-recession levels, companies should be investing more of
their cash in gearing up for a recovery in the domestic economy,'' he
said.
''The over-riding impression is one of a general slowing down in the
rate at which UK businesses are rebuilding their profitability and
financial health,'' Mr Coates concluded.
Scotland's success in the first quarter of this year was mainly
because of a generalised profitability gains in the oil, construction,
electronics sectors, all of which are well represented north of the
Border, Mr Coates said.
He pointed out that these sectors lagged behind the recovery in other
areas of the economy last year, but were now coming forward strongly.
But CCN said profitability fell in several consumer-oriented sectors,
such as hotel and leisure and distribution, reflecting the absence of a
''feel good'' factor among consumers.

Graeme Woolaston catches familial glimpses of a simpler time and place
in a Scottish village school.
RECENTLY I visited Aberdeen, where my mother's family comes from,
looking for some background information about my grandmother's career as
a schoolteacher before the First World War.
In the Grampian regional archives I examined the log-books for the
school in the village of St Fergus, where she was first a pupil and
subsequently a teacher, and the school to which she moved in 1912, in
Port Erroll as it was then known -- now Cruden Bay.
The log-books were completed each week by the headmaster, and usually
contain bare facts about attendances and sicknesses. Occasionally,
however, by reading betwen the lines or through casual asides, I caught
glimpses of what life was like in a north-east village schools early
this century.
For example, the St Fergus log book contains a transcript of the
Inspectors' Report for 1895, the year my grandmother began school there.
It gives an extraordinary impression of conditions:
Upwards of eighty children are taught in the junior room, which gives
proper accommodation for little more than fifty, and, as the other two
rooms are crowded to their utmost capacity, the need for extension is
pressing . . . A large new room should be built and furnished suitably
for infant instruction.
Apparatus and material for kindergarten work and musical drill should
be got, including a piano, instead of the broken-down, wheezy harmonium
at present in use. Simple, pleasing pictures should take the place of
the advertisements of quack medicines and wares of local tradesmen which
disfigure the walls . . .
My grandmother is first mentioned by name on July l7, 1905, when, at
the age of 14, she is included among the staff: ''Barbara Brodie,
Monitor.'' On July 14th ''School was closed on Tuesday to enable
scholars to visit Sanger's Circus in Peterhead''. In the winter of 1905
a new idea was tried in St Fergus:
Nov. 10th: Today the Hot Dinner Scheme was inaugurated, each child
present being supplied with a basin of nice soup.
Nov. 17th: The Hot Dinner Scheme is proving very successful. Dinners
are supplied to the children for the nominal sum of a halfpenny, the
deserving poor being supplied gratis.
Nov. 24th: Attendances show a very gratifying rise, attributable to
the provision of hot dinners.
By the summer of 1906, when she was only 15, Barbara Brodie had become
a pupil teacher, first year, a post long since abolished. She was
appointed an assistant teacher on July 30th, 1909, at a salary of #50
per annum.
The log book continues to throw odd lights on the life of the school.
In February 1911 there was another innovation -- medical examination of
''entrants, leavers, and special cases''. In June the school closed not
for a day, but for an entire week, to celebrate the Coronation of George
V. In March 1912 the school inspector had ''made preliminary
arrangements for the introduction of the teaching of cookery to the
girls''.
Although the log book instructions expressly forbade it, the St Fergus
headmaster, James Cormack, sometimes couldn't hold back from commenting
on external events:
Augt. 17th. 1914: Children greatly excited over the opening events of
the great European War.
October 31st: The War News is receiving a good deal of attention, the
scholars being keenly interested.
The Scholars have just completed a collection throughout the parish in
aid of the Belgian Relief Fund and have succeeded in collecting the sume
of #10 9s. for this deserving object.
By then, however, my grandmother had moved to Port Erroll school,
where she was appointed in March 1912 at the higher salary of #60 per
annum. From February 5, to February 24, the school had been closed due
to scarlet fever, and it was closed again from March 11 to March 31.
1st April: Miss Brodie, the newly appointed assistant, entered upon
duty to-day . . . During the period when the school was closed, the
school premises were again thoroughly disinfected and cleaned and pens
and pencils that had been in use were destroyed or burned.
But the log had passing glances at the rhythm of the Aberdeenshire
year:
7th June: The emigration of the local fishing population to Peterhead
has commenced and the numbers on the Roll have consequently decreased.
There are also glimpses of the changes beginning to affect even Port
Erroll:
11th April 1913: As a result of a communication from the Scottish
Automobile Club to the School Board, a special lesson on how to avoid
street accidents was given in the school to-day.
20th Feby. 1914: The school was closed on Thursday afternoon to allow
the children to witness the arrival and flight of three Army Biplanes.
I can't help wondering if this was also the first time my grandmother
saw an aeroplane.
Unlike the St Fergus log, the Port Erroll log makes no mention of the
outbreak of war, but eventually it makes its inevitable impact:
21st Decr. 1914: The school was not opened until 10 o'clock this
forenoon as the recruits for the Naval Brigade were leaving by the 9.40
train, and all and sundry turned out to see them off.
(How many returned, I wonder?)
19th Novr. 1915: The schoolchildren are giving enthusiastic support in
collecting eggs and money for various War Funds and agencies.
But the old way of life would persist a little longer; the School
Board Minutes record on 22nd October 1915: ''Port Erroll School will be
closed every year on Harvest Thanksgiving day and the Spring Fast day so
long as the churches continue to observe them.'
My grandmother left Port Erroll school on 12th May 1916. By a grim
symmetry the next entry in the log echoes the entry just before her
arrival: ''School closed for scarlet fever, and cleaned again.''
My grandmother married in February 1917 and thereafter, as a married
woman, was barred from the teaching profession.
* My thanks to Mrs Brenda Cluer, Regional Archivist, and her staff,
for their courtesy and assistance during my visit to Aberdeen, and for
permission to quote from the school log-books and Board Minutes.

DID you know that, according to a study released at the weekend, an
independent Scotland would rapidly prosper? That's the conclusion of an
exhaustive analysis by the Centre for Human Ecology, based at Edinburgh
University. Sponsors of the report include Scottish Nuclear, Scottish
Natural Heritage, and -- to the certain chagrin of Ian Lang -- even
Scottish Enterprise.
Scotland free, says the report, would offer the ''potential for a
higher material standard of living and more jobs''. Scotland's
considerable energy resources -- notably the oil and natural gas
reserves of the sea-bed -- would rapidly create a post-independence
boom. Carefully managed, the risk of bust and inflationary horrors could
be readily avoided. And then . . .
Scots pensions could be raised by 50%. Unemployment benefit could
likewise be hiked. State-financed housing grants could be increased
threefold. The free Scotland could afford to spend 20% more on health
care. These are only a few of the 14 sustainable policy initiatives
which, according to authors Malcolm Slesser and Jane King, could be
bankrolled by the fat of Scotland's energy surplus. But there would be a
holistic approach to the nation's wellbeing: not merely would such corn
and wine abound, but the whole carnival could be environmentally
sustainable.
Scotland, the study emphasises, is almost the ideal candidate for a
nation state. We are uniquely well placed for a high standard of living
which would neither strain nor spoil the creation around us. Scotland
has low population density. She is rich in energy supplies. The land is
awash with clean, fresh water. But, says the report, ''. . . it must
generate wealth, and in that respect it is in a steadily weakening
position, becoming a processor of intermediate goods''.
The patient, at present, is sick. The key symptom is her widening
trade deficit with the rest of Britain -- assessed at #3750m for 1994.
The proximate cause is our growing slide into a branch-factory economy
-- more and more of our manufacturing base, be it British Steel or
Rolls-Royce or whatever, being shut down and asset-stripped for English
centralisation. And the disease -- terminal? -- is the Union.
Yet the solution is in our hands. And, if the analysis by the Centre
for Human Ecology is correct (as it plainly is), and if the remedies
outlined for an independent Scotland are realistic (as they appear to
be), then in less than a decade we could obliterate that trade deficit.
We could generate wealth sufficient to raise our standard of living as
outlined above. More: we could move to destroy mass unemployment: up and
running, our new economy would be creating 35,000 jobs a year by 2005.
But it has to be a sustainable economy: a wealth creation actually
conserving, even replenishing, our natural resources. This, insists the
Centre for Human Ecology, is entirely achievable. But such a goal is
now, irrevocably, beyond the reach of Titanic England and the faltering,
foundering, United Kingdom.
Scotland can feed herself -- England can't. Scotland abounds in pure,
clean water -- England, even after drowning several Welsh valleys in the
past half-century, is in dire shortage, and the average London tap
disgorges H[2]O with all the tingling freshness of bleached recycled
urine, which it probably is.
Scotland holds the bulk of the British fishery -- though even Labour's
brave new world of devolution won't surrender control of Scottish fish
to a Scottish parliament. Scotland grows most British timber. Scotland
has space -- hundreds of thousands of empty acres on unspoilt, unbuilt
land. Our air is fresh. Our land is beautiful. Town after town after
town -- Edinburgh, Perth, St Andrews, Inverness -- offer an all-round
standard of living, in amenities and environment and cleanliness,
unmatched anywhere in the United Kingdom.
And yet one-third of Scots live below the official EU poverty line.
Trident submarines, unwanted, unloved, sit on the Firth of Clyde,
bristling death and leukemia. But the jobs and cash for servicing those
submarines went to the south of England.
Thousands still live, criminalised, because they could not and would
not pay the iniquitous poll tax, imposed on Scotland two years ahead of
England in direct contravention of the Articles of Union.
Thousands more live in damp, insanitary housing as other thousands
live on the streets. Tuberculosis, a disease obliterated in the fifties,
is rising again. Teenage Scots, ignorant of love, stripped of hope, fry
their brains on drugs and glue.
Meanwhile, Highland glens stand empty, empty save for the little
tumbled homes of inhabitants forcibly cleared five and six generations
ago. That land is still in the hands of speculators and spendthrifts. My
own native heath was lately the toy of a spoiled lady, so crazy she
heated her castle by burning antique furniture. She has now sold up to
the sprog of a cider millionaire. He promises -- don't they all? -- big
schemes, big improvements, more work for all. I won't hold my breath.
The Tories have no interest in Scotland, save in Scotland's oil.
Labour has no vision for Scotland beyond the urgent need to protect its
Scottish votes. Its toytown Scottish Parliament, as outlined, will have
no voice in the European Union, no power to adjust pensions or social
security payments, no veto on Trident -- or any other martial obscenity;
no powers to take land into public ownership. But it will, of course, be
50% female. Ain't that sweet?
Decades of Liberal government repeatedly promised home rule but at
length gave priority to thumping the Kaiser. The Great War -- surely the
worst disaster in the history of Britain, a calamity that has laid us
low ever since -- sent the Liberals into well-deserved oblivion. In
1977, Liberal MPs vetoed a crucial guillotine on the Scotland &amp; Wales
Act -- the nearest we have come this century to seeing any measure of
home rule -- to wrest the Lib-Lab pact and get Steel cosy with
Callaghan.
And we? We fight when they ask us; we boast, then we cower; we beg for
a piece of what's already ours . . .
So the Proclaimers sang, seven years ago. They have now, very
sensibly, gone big in America. We're still at home on the same stuck
record. Carp, moan, whinge, whine, bleat, greet . . . Realms smaller
than ourselves -- Norway, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg -- sit at the
high table. Scots in Africa, Australasia, and the Americas built an
empire. Our ancestors fought and marched, gave the world arts, poetry
and drama of profound power and beauty. What did we all do last weekend?
We sat on the sofa and cried for Hamish Macbeth's wee dug.
Isn't it time to open our eyes? Time to arise? And time to sing a
better song?

Alexander McKenzie reports on the coming screen tests in cyberschool.
WHEN California State University's new college at Fort Ord opens this
year it will contain all the usual features of an American college
campus except one: it will have no library.
Instead of building an expensive new library complex CSU officials
have decided to invest their funds in the latest computers and on-line
information services.
By tapping into the integrated mass of communications networks known
as the Internet, students at Fort Ord will have immediate access to
America's, and the world's, digital information resources.
With institutions such as the American Library of Congress converting
their books, research papers, photographs, sound recordings and films
into digital forms, many other universities are also encouraging their
students to use the Internet to gain access to the information they
require.
The Internet also enables teachers and students to use their computers
to exchange messages, lecture notes, assignments and tests.
American schools, meanwhile, are exploiting the latest computers and
on-line information services to help pupils improve their computing
skills and to enhance their learning in many different disciplines.
Various studies in the United States have shown that imaginative
computer games and simulations are often more effective than
conventional books and worksheets in helping pupils master new skills.
In addition computer-assisted learning programmes enable pupils to
take a more active role in the learning process. Indeed, American pupils
are being encouraged to learn foreign languages, cultures, and religions
by communicating directly via Internet.
Familiarity with the latest information technology is one of the
reasons that American schools and universities are able to produce so
many talented computer engineers for world-beating companies such as
IBM.
Japan, perhaps the world's most gadget-minded country, has also been
investing in new IT resources for its schools. The Japanese Ministry of
Education's most recent spending programme provided each high school
with 42 of the country's newest computers.
A new information basics course has been added to Japan's required
curriculum and a special study group has been set up to look at other
ways of giving more emphasis to IT. One billion dollars has been made
available for the installation of computer networks with Internet links
at 71 Japanese universities.
Australia and New Zealand, meanwhile, are producing imaginative
computer-assisted learning programmes which government reports say are
helping to increase pupil motivation and make education a more enjoyable
and meaningful experience.
0 In Europe the response to the new developments in Information
Technology has been a mixed one. Some countries like the United Kingdom,
Denmark, and the Netherlands have been quick to install computers in the
classroom. Others, including France and Germany, have been less
enthusiastic about spending large sums on IT equipment.
In the Netherlands, where primary schools have been generously
equipped with new computers, information technology is being introduced
at the earliest possible stage in every child's education.
Denmark has produced a national strategy for the development of IT
although a shortage of funds has forced some schools to encourage pupils
to buy their own portable machines for the classroom.
In France, however, a lack of machines, limited software, and a
mistrust of the educational merits of computers have held back the
development of computer-assisted learning in many schools.
With English dominating the Internet's databases some of France's
leading educationists fear that global information services will
undermine the French language.
Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom have generally made
good progress in promoting IT. Nonetheless there are fears that the use
of obsolete equipment is preventing many schools from keeping pace with
developments in the US and Japan.
In spite of the growing importance of the IT industry to the Scottish
economy some schools continue to be criticised, by HMIs and others, for
not making enough use of advanced technology.

THE humiliating collapse of opinion polls in France might suggest a
country in good health -- after all, any nation which developed a
foolproof system of reading people's minds would be an intolerable place
to live. But two months ago a man called Philippe told his fashionable
neighbours on the rue du Sontay in Paris that he believed France was on
the rim of civil unrest so huge it would rival the 1968 riots which
ultimately toppled Charles de Gaulle.
In their courteous way the neighbours listened, a risen eyebrow
signifying interest in Philippe's whimsical notion that in this
presidential race Lionel Jospin was their man.
But as the weeks progressed their question Why Jospin? altered to Why
not? This may have been the 16th arrondissement where the Balladurs had
long owned an apartment round the corner; it might have seemed the
natural habitat of the Right's leading candidate, Jacques Chirac, whose
very urbanity made him look like a rich art dealer of the quartier. But
perhaps what the residents of rue du Sontay needed was someone with more
intellectual muscle, and as the campaign weeks progressed, Jospin was
clearly not the starchy individual his first appearance implied.
A former education minister recently divorced and now married to
Sylviane Agacinski, an elegant philosopher 10 years his junior, this
political outsider was rapidly being perceived as an insider of a
certain Parisian type. With Agacinski and her young son from a previous
union, Jospin lived in a chic attic flat on the Left Bank, mixing easily
with the intelligentsia.
Even so, the Elysee Palace remains elusive. For a start Balladur has
now endorsed Chirac and the increasing phalanx of right-wing extremists
will now also apply a brutish shoulder to the favourite contender's
wagon. And it may be that for moderate floaters the last-minute
socialist surge in Round 1 has served its only purpose, the registering
of a startling protest vote.
When it comes to the pomp and the power of this peculiarly imperial
presidency, the French may feel that the suave, glad-handing Mayor of
Paris, with his lavish promises of accountability, is better equipped
for the Elysee than an internationally obscure left-winger who, only in
remarriage, has shown any aptitude for fashion.
''Agacinski, who has interrupted her latest treatise to assist the
Jospin campaign, advises her husband on his clothes,'' sniffs a Parisian
journalist, implying no sophisticated Frenchman should need tuition in
style.
But no matter how the vote goes on May 7, Philippe's neighbourhood
urgings have their own piquant significance, for here is not a
professional forecaster or pundit. Philippe is a vagrant, one among
about 6500 homeless people in the capital. Yet over the past four years
he has made himself indispensable to his chosen street by becoming its
vigilante against hated car-parking attendants imposing fines. On the
rue du Sontay people can park legally only for two hours in the day so
Philippe helps them to beat the system by continually slipping updated
meter receipts under their windscreen wipers.
In return the residents give him tips and food, and a local cobbler
permits him to shower and shave in his shop every morning. This
attention to personal appearance, says Philippe, sets him apart from the
clochards, the grimy outcasts of Paris, who sleep on Metro grilles and
under the Seine's bridges. Today he is saving his money in the hope of
some day being able to rent a room but prior to his respectable vagrancy
he spent thirteen-and-a-half years in prison for armed robbery.
Even so, such is Philippe's standing on the rue du Sontay now that
people entrust him with their car keys if it means escaping the 800Fr
penalty for having a car towed away. Still blessed with the alert
antennae of master crook, he hears and sees things down on the street
which give him a head start over any political pollster. The residents
of the rue de Sontay are his family, he insists, and he debates politics
with them, acting as the voice of the unemployed.
So, in his curious way he canvasses unofficially for Jospin because
Philippe believes he is the candidate who possesses enough modesty to
avert calamity, and Philippe also once saved Jospin's only luxury, a
Renault 19 Cabriolet, from the revenge of traffic wardens.
Now, the more boffins dismiss his hero's final chances, the more
Philippe takes heart. After all, poll-taking is nothing but mere
necromancy, and anyway people are unpredictable by nature. You can take
a nation's pulse, he says, but who can be sure that nation hasn't just
run up a flight of stairs.

OVER the past two years, a programme of seven, highly successful
''Frontiers of Science and Engineering'' seminars has been organised for
fifth-year students in Ayr Division secondary schools.
Jointly organised and sponsored by the division's schools-industry
liaison officer, senior careers officers, and Ayrshire Education
Business Partnership, they reflect an ongoing commitment to the
expansion and enhancement of education/industry links.
Based on the notion that science and technology are the cornerstones
of most social and economic development, these seminars are aimed at:
* Encouraging continuing study of science in further and higher
education.
* Increasing awareness of exciting developments at the frontiers of
science in local industry.
* Increasing awareness of career options through talks with young
graduates.
* Providing a structure to allow students to visit these graduates at
work in local industries.
The target group is fifth-year pupils studying maths with a science or
technological studies at Higher grade.
Each one-day programme, attended by about 30 pupils from about 10
schools, begins with presentations from representatives of local
industries operating at the frontier of their respective technologies.
To date these have included: Barr Construction on civil engineering
design and construction; Giltech Ltd on developments in wound
management, and seaweed-based bandages in particular; Crosshouse
Hospital on cochlear implants; Proven Engineering on alternative
technology wind turbines; SmithKline Beecham on the new generation of
drugs used in the treatment of heart disease; Scottish Nuclear on the
dry store of nuclear fuel; South and North Ayrshire Hospitals on the
applications of physics to medicine; and Kelco International on the
ever-increasing uses of alginate.
After question-and-answer sessions with the presenters, the students
break up into groups to meet young graduates from local industries. They
are the able to discuss a range of issues such as qualifications,
student life, career pathways, prospects, and day-to-day routines. The
use of young graduates not only encourages a greater empathy, but also
ensures that the career-specific information they are able to provide is
as up-to-date as possible.
Given the ''real world'' nature of the project, off-campus venues such
as SmithKline Beecham's Training Suite at Irvine, the MacDonald
Education Centre in Ayr Hospital, and Kilmarnock Football Club's
hospitality area at Rugby Park, are preferred to educational premises.
After lunch, groups of students accompanied by graduates undertake a
two-hour trip to local factories and laboratories. There they can see
for themselves the industrial environment in which they are interested,
including the increasingly important role of applied science and
technology in it and learn at first hand about more general design,
marketing, and financial matters.
On their return to base, each group must prove its ability to work
under pressure and demonstrate its communication skills by preparing and
producing a short presentation on its chosen industry, deploying as wide
a range of material as they have been able to muster. This also serves
as a useful reinforcement of all that they have learned, and as a timely
reminder that, in business, there's no such thing as a free lunch.
Follow-up evaluations reveal a high approval rate for all aspects of
the seminars.
* Norman Dunsmore is a development officer with the Technical and
Vocational Education Initiative.

RECOVERY must be well and truly under way. Britain's executives are
receiving inflation-busting pay awards, the biggest for more than two
years. Two surveys published yesterday put the average rises at between
4.8% and 6.9%, depending on how high up the executive ladder you happen
to be. Unsurprisingly, the largest whack goes to company directors and,
according to one of the studies, Scottish directors are now the highest
paid anywhere in the UK. Scottish managers are, apparently, now better
paid than any other managers outside central London.
If you have yet to put your foot on the first rung of the executive
ladder, have been offered the rate of inflation or less (take it or
leave it) in pay talks with your employer recently, and are currently
more preoccupied with your job's security than with fighting for some
real additional cash, all this will be of purely academic interest.
You may even feel a little irked. Why aren't the fruits of recovery
being spread around a bit more? Why should they get paid even more for
keeping the lid on what the rest of us get or, in the most dramatic
cases, telling workers by the thousand they won't be paying them
anything at all in future, thank you very much? Such dark questions are,
I suspect, common currency whenever executive pay surveys like these hit
the headlines.
The debate may lack the emotional heat reserved for privatised utility
bosses, whenever their latest salary, pension, bonus or share-option
deals are revealed. But, if the contents of Cedric -- don't you just
love being in control -- Brown's monthly salary statement guarantee
higher debating temperatures, the impact of more anonymous executive pay
surveys is significant none the less.
No-one spends percentages. And, in real pounds and pence, 6.9% of
#95,000 (the reported average pay of Scottish company directors) is more
than some of our lowest-paid manual workers receive in a year. Even for
workers on average earnings, a rise of #6555 is sheer wishful thinking.
So tongues will, and do, wag at what they -- in the boardroom or in the
manager's office -- are, or are thought to be, getting.
Any attempt at a rational discussion about the structure of rewards
for work in this country is instantly bedevilled by such high-octane
emotion on all sides. The charge of greedy bosses with their snouts in
the trough on the one hand is countered by high-minded cant about the
politics of envy, on the other. The accusation that executives are, in
the long march out of the last recession, getting paid more for wielding
the knife more on those below them is countered by the claim that
executives are working longer hours, burning out faster, and have seen
their own expected tenures significantly reduced.
Caught up in the crossfire are some very substantive issues. But
injecting reason into a debate about them seems beyond us. Why, if I may
pick just one or two of the subsidiary numbers from the Sedgwick Noble
Lowndes survey, does the average head of finance in a British company
receive a base salary 46% -- yes 46% -- higher than the average head of
manufacturing? And why is the total remuneration of directors in
companies with turnovers in the #50m to #300m range actually higher (to
the tune of #1010 a year) than the average in companies with turnovers
in the #300m to #600m range?
According to the other survey, from the Institute of Management, women
managers got higher percentage increases than their male colleagues last
year, but female directors got less than the men. How do we explain
that? Women managers, the same survey tells us, now earn an average
#28,642, but that is still around #5000 less than their male colleagues.
Female directors -- there are, needless to say, very few of them -- earn
an average #30,000 a year less than their male colleagues.
The gender earning gap is not just a British phenomenon. One of the
things I learned in Japan is that fixed wages, for women, are on average
some 39% below those for men. The disparity is at its peak in the 45 to
55 age group (the prime earning years), when the wage gap leaves
Japanese women 47% adrift of equivalent male wages.
But saying the problem spans continents does not explain it. Indeed I
doubt the issue of pay discrimination against women is capable of
rational explanation. It is exploitation, pure and simple. And the
sooner it ends the better, as far as I'm concerned. But such lack of a
rational underpinning for what people are actually paid is, of course,
true of other aspects of the reward structures modern economies have
evolved.
Some argue that pay is simply a price mechanism, like any other. And
that, in free markets, the price paid reflects the scarcity or otherwise
of people willing to do this or that job. The implication is that most
managers are a highly-trained, relatively scarce resource, while those
with boardroom potential are the corporate equivalent of perfect pearls
in oysters.
Now, I'm happy to report that I've met some very impressive managers
in my time. And some company directors, too, who have stood out, in
terms of analytical skills, creative instincts or sheer achievement. But
I've met plenty of duffers, too. And it's not immediately clear to me
that the dross fares significantly less well in the reward stakes than
the stars. Nor is it clear to me that enough British executives are
actually trained to do the jobs they purport to perform.
There is scant evidence that executive pay is clearly tied to the ups
and downs of corporate profits, the state of company balance sheets, or
the success of corporate strategies. With some honourable exceptions,
executive pay, from the boardroom down, goes up in the bad years as well
as the good. And, if a diversification or an acquisition goes
disastrously wrong, there are still too many three or four-year rolling
contracts around, to cushion the resulting exit.
My message is simple. If news that your boss got an increase more than
twice the rate of inflation this year, while you got inflation at best,
irks you, don't expect a rational explanation. In debates about pay,
reason is the first thing to fly out the window.

MORE students come to study in Britain from Germany than from any
other European country. In 1992 there were 7300 German students in
Britain while only 2300 British students went to Germany. The Government
is aware of the imbalance and fears the problem may become more acute.
Sue Garner, of the Department for Education's European Union policy
unit, said introducing fees for all students studying in British
universities is an option under discussion and may well redress the
balance.
This would discourage students from other member states of the EU
coming to study in Britain, while encouraging British students to study
elsewhere.
Many German students come to Britain on Erasmus programmes for six
months a year but later choose to take their whole degree here.
If a student from a member state of the EU decides to take their
degree in another member state, EU law says that student must be treated
as a home student of that country in relation to paying fees.
If, for example, a British student went to study in France he or she
would be asked to pay fees in the same way as a French student but if a
French student were taking a first degree in Britain or Germany their
fees would be paid for them in the same way as a student of that
country.
This raises the question of policy harmonisation on fee paying for
higher education within the EU and whether it would provide a fairer
basis for circulating students.
Since neither Britain or Germany asks students to pay their own fees
this does not explain the large imbalance between the two.
The problem is not only that studying abroad is an impossibility
without language proficiency, it is also that neither the country of
origin nor the receiving country is under any obligation to give a grant
to a student studying abroad.
German students manage to overcome these obstacles more easily than
British ones. This is not only because of their linguistic superiority
but also because they are less dependent on state grants. As grants and
student loans cannot be received abroad such study must be privately
funded.
For most German students in Britain, their living expenses are met by
their parents and the money they make working in Germany over the summer
vacation.
Of all the applications British universities make for Erasmus exchange
programmes less than 60% are taken up. British students cannot be
persuaded to study abroad.
Philip Clift, Head of Erasmus programmes in Brussels, recognises the
imbalance in exchange programmes but believes it is up to the British
Government to encourage students to travel more by putting a greater
emphasis on language training. He advocates a foreign language as a
compulsory part of every degree.
But Dr Roderick Watt, lecturer in German at Glasgow University,
rejects the idea of imposing language classes on undergraduates.
Students underestimate the time and effort needed to learn a language
and often give up when the workload becomes too much, he maintains.
His answer is to improve the level of language teaching in secondary
schools. Here, he says, German students have an advantage over British
students because they spend so much time studying English.
Dr Watt says German students are drawn to British universities by the
more personal style of tuition, less crowded lecture halls, and
specialised areas of study.
''They consider British university education to be better value for
money. They are attracted to the unlimited access they get to staff and
are amazed at how easy it is to speak to them on a one to one basis,
especially professors whom they consider in Germany to be like God
Almighty.
''German students feel that they are spoon-fed in British universities
and like the prospect of getting a degree in four years. It is very
unlikely that someone would get the equivalent of an honours degree in
Germany in that time.''
Michel Franke, a German who is studying for a BA in photography, said
that once in college or university in Britain you have a greater chance
of survival.
''Sometimes if you get less than 80% after the first year in Germany
you are forced to drop out. Some students are even forced to drop out
after four years and are left with no qualification at all.''

OUR photograph today is not, as far as we know, a taste of what may be
to come in a future Labour government. Let us start at the beginning
with the story of No 11 Downing Street and the briefcase belonging to
Tom Clarke, Labour MP for Monklands West.
The tale starts in the British Airways Shuttle lounge in Glasgow
Airport where the airline is taking a strict new line enforcing the rule
that only one piece of baggage may be taken as hand luggage. This is
particularly bad news for Scots MPs, who all travel to Westminster
clutching the maximum-size travel bag with the week's clean laundry and
the briefcase bulging with their papers.
They do so to avoid the excruciating wait at the luggage carousels at
Heathrow. Despite his protestations, last week Mr Clarke had to hand
over his briefcase to British Airways staff. The airline duly managed to
lose it but delivered it safely to the Commons the next day.
On Sunday night British Airways again relieved him of his second bit
of luggage. He asked them to do their best not to lose it this time.
But again he waited in vain for 30 minutes at Heathrow for the
briefcase to turn up. Again he explained that he was an MP and it was
important the briefcase be delivered to him as soon as possible.
British Airways certainly gave the case priority. Which was why a
puzzled Mr Tom Clarke got a telephone call from an even more puzzled
staff at No 11 Downing Street (current tenant one Kenneth Clarke)
wondering why the briefcase had been sent there. And would Mr Clarke
(Tom) mind popping round and picking it up.
Biggest break
PRIZE for the Most Contrived Contribution of the Week goes to Jim Barr
of Lenzie. Mr Barr has been watching the world snooker championship on
the TV. He notes that the current world number three is one James
Wattana of Thailand. He points out that if that country had not changed
its name the player would be known as Wattana, Siam.
A name to
conjure with
THOSE who pen sporting headlines in the tabloid reaches of the media
normally have to corrupt footballers' names in the search for pithy
phrases, viz Gazza for Gascoigne. No such problems with Middlesbrough
striker Uwe Fuchs who was red-carded in a home match against Sheffield
United, leading to the heading: ''Fuchs Off at 'Boro!''
MP for Brigadoon
INFORMATION continues to filter in about Carrick Cumnock, the mythical
Ayrshire Tory. James McGivern of East Kilbride points out that Carrick
is MP for Brigadoon South, one of two constituencies specially created
by the Boundaries Commission to ensure some Conservative representation
in Scotland.
Carrick triumphed with a majority well into double figures. Sir
Michael Hirst failed to secure Brigadoon North in a hotly-contested
three-way fight with David Blunkett's guide dog for Labour and a young
Nationalist who had never slept with anyone remotely connected to Winnie
Ewing. The voters of Brigadoon North are extremely pleased with the
performance of Lucy the Labrador who is widely praised as ''a good
constituency MP''.
But back to Carrick Cumnock, MP. Iain McDougall of Coatbridge wins
today's bottle of hooch for telling us that Carrick, despite being
Scots-born as the younger son of the Earl of Drongan, is not yet quite
up to speed on Scottish affairs:
* He thinks the Times publishes an evening edition for the West of
Scotland.
* He thinks prices are quite reasonable up here but hasn't yet been
for a cup of coffee in Nardini's in Largs.
* He says he is delighted to hear that the majority of Scottish
children are educated in public schools and intends to send his son Kyle
to one.
Finally, in a recent poll, 80% of those asked their opinion of Carrick
Cumnock said the by-pass should go ahead.
The Lobey Lecture
IT is that time of year when the daffies are out and us dafties
celebrate Lobey Dosser's official birthday. The merry-making on the
occasion of the third anniversary of the world's only two-legged
equestrian statue will take place, as usual, in the Halt Bar,
conveniently located just across Woodlands Road, Glasgow, from the
aforementioned stookie.
The now traditional entertainment will be laid on. Walter McCorrisken,
the world's worst poet, will doubtless live up to his reputation. The
Frank O'Hagan Cowboy Band will provide the music.
There is one innovation. Cliff Hanley, the legendary Glasgow writer,
wit, and general know-all, will deliver the first annual Lobey Dosser
Lecture. This is a unique opportunity for you young yins to have
explained to youse all about Bud Neill, creator of the Lobey Dosser
cartoon character.
Cliff was a chum of Bud Neill and can give eye-witness testimony, even
ear-witness testimony, to his special talents.
Remarkably, even although this looks like being yet again one of the
liveliest events to coincide with Mayfest, there is no charge for
admission. Come along and get sworn in. The party lasts from 2pm to 5pm.
* AND finally, we were sad to hear about the Glasgow couple who bought
a waterbed in an attempt to spice up their marriage but they drifted
apart.

THE sale of the historic 14,500-acre Inverlael sporting estate, near
Ullapool, in Wester Ross, is attracting the interest of wealthy hunters
but the #630,000 asking price does not include a house -- Inverlael

Geraldine Abrahams learns how pupils are going on-line for business in
cyberspace.
AYRSHIRE'S young entrepreneurs of tomorrow are taking to the
information superhighway to build trading links with their overseas
counterparts.
A transatlantic network has been established, connecting four schools
in Ayrshire with four schools in Coweto County in Georgia, US, using the
latest information technology such as e-mail and Internet to negotiate
export deals for their own home-grown products.
The project, Achievers International, was devised by Colin Duncan,
manager of Marks &amp; Spencer in Ayr, Tom Kennedy, manager of the Royal
Bank of Scotland in Kilmarnock, and John Curran, manager of the Ayrshire
Education Business Partnership, and is supported by Scottish Enterprise,
Enterprise Ayrshire, and BT.
The main objectives of the initiative are to harness and encourage the
enthusiasm and enterprise of young people, so that they might develop an
awareness of the potential of international trading, acquiring skills
and knowledge that will be directly transferable to the jobs they do
after they have left school.
''The project presents potential long-term benefits for pupils about
to enter employment for the first time,'' said Colin Duncan of Marks &amp;
Spencer. ''But it can equally benefit industry and commerce to have
available a more dynamic workforce with entrepreneurial flair.''
The schools participating are Grange Academy, St Conval's High School,
Wellington School, and Greenwood Academy. The pupils involved in the
exercise have set up companies and have started to identify products
that might successfully be manufactured and exported to the school in
Georgia with which it has linked.
With Ayrshire being renowned on a world scale for both golf and Robert
Burns, the schools are likely to focus on products which utilise both
themes. The Georgian schools have also considered their potential market
and a Southern cookbook featuring the recipes which have become world
famous, is one probable product.
Said Hugh Millar, head teacher of Grange Academy: ''We are delighted
to have been selected for this challenging initiative. This opportunity
will allow our pupils to acquire many of the skills needed for their
success in the modern world.''
This is echoed by St Conval's High School head teacher Michael Murray.
''I am very pleased that the youngsters will be involved. It is very
exciting that the 'company' will be exporting goods to a Georgia
school.''
Despite the recession, the Scottish export market has remained buoyant
with regions like Ayrshire, which has only 7% of the population,
accounting for 15% of Scotland's exports. Of that 15%, around one third
of the products are exported to the US.
But schools, by their nature learning institutions, are not generally
equipped to run businesses. However, part of the initiative will be to
give the participating teachers training in all aspects of the Young
Enterprise Scheme and on crucial aspects of exports and training in
operating e-mail, as well as the opportunity to go out on company
placements. Business and technical support will also be provided by the
initiative designers.
This training is vital because, although many schools have the
capability for IT links, few have the staff trained in its use. This
generally results in the equipment being under-utilised.
This two-year pilot project will be carried out after school hours and
will involve around 15 pupils per ''company''. They will have access to
the Internet so that they can develop these long-distance links. The
schools will be helped with the design and manufacture of their
products.
''The key export theme and the internationality of the exchanges makes
this a first for Scotland and one which will bring home first-hand
practical experience for the players,'' said John Curran of Ayrshire
Education Business Partnership.
''Any project that can raise the potential for young people to make
the most out of their local area within a global context has merit. By
having immediate access to their US partners and markets, young people
will capitalise on both the contacts and the immediacy that this
'superhighway' technology provides.''
In some ways, the Ayrshire intiative is leading the way, since the
Government White Paper -- Creating the Superhighways of the Future:
Developing Broadband Communications in the UK -- clearly acknowledged
the importance of new technology in accessing markets abroad.
By the end of its two-year pilot, the project should have achieved its
two aims of promoting export within the theme of enterprise and used
that context to explore the potential of the global superhighway.
''Not all pupils will become business people,'' said the Royal Bank's
Tom Kennedy. ''But the necessary skills and knowledge, if promoted in
schools, will help them understand the significance of exports as
employees or as future employers.''
If it works, and there is every likelihood that it will, then the
experience of the pupils involved in running these ''companies'' may
very well be used as an example of how Scottish companies can maximise
exporting opportunities around the world.
It will not be the first time that adults have learned from children.

ONE of the consequences of Brian Wilson's selective use of opinion
poll statistics is that he invites other selective, if more fundamental,
statistics in reply (April 21).
While most SNP supporters would agree that not every voter supporting
the party at the forthcoming Perth and Kinross by-election is voting
principally for independence, most recognise that support for an
independence party can help deliver on the big issues like health,
economic rejuvenation, and democratic accountability.
May I point out to Brian Wilson that in another Herald poll earlier
this year 47% of Labour voters stated they were either in favour, or
were quite happy with, independence in the medium term. Long-term
non-delivery on the big issues by Westminster can only push these voters
into the SNP camp.
Many people in Scotland are fed up with the Labour Party's apparent
belief that it is acceptable to have a non-Tory government once very
four terms or so, and that's assuming, and it is a big assumption, that
Labour can rely on the whims of those in the south of England and can
win the next General Election.

YOUR report on the selection of chief executives for the new councils
slightly misrepresents the views of myself and my colleagues (April 21).
We have not argued there should be open competition for these chief
executive posts; we understand why the selection is confined to serving
local government staff in the first instance.
We do argue that the reliance on internal circulars as a means of
making these vacancies known was seriously flawed, for three reasons.
Internal communications in large organisations are invariably weak,
and some interested people may not have seen such circulars.
Secondly, it sets an unfortunate precedent for the new councils when
they come to advertise for the many other posts which must also be the
subject of competition between serving local government staff.
Thirdly, it breaches a practice which many councils view as an
important part of their equal opportunities procedures.
One display advertisement in each of the four Scottish quality papers
would have avoided this criticism.

BRIAN WILSON should be more cautious of opinion poll findings (April
21). After all, in the recent local elections Labour's share of the vote
was nearly 10% lower than its System Three poll rating.
As far as Perth and Kinross is concerned, Brian Wilson gets it all
wrong. He says the SNP vote was down 3% in the local elections compared
with the General Election. In fact, it was marginally up, from 36.0% to
36.6%.
The local elections also showed that Labour is still in third place in
Perth and Kinross, with the Tories second to the SNP. If Labour can't
beat the Tories on such a dismal night for Tory fortunes, then how can
Brian Wilson possibly claim that it can win the seat? The only possible
effect of Labour votes would be to boost the Tories' chances of winning.
However, if Brian Wilson thinks Labour can overtake the SNP (and the
Tories) in Perth and Kinross, then he must also accept that the SNP can
overtake Labour in Scotland since the gaps are the same.

EVEN with a programme devoted mostly to sound bites, and at a time of
serious competition from groups more deeply into baroque authenticity,
this remains the choicest of chamber orchestras. On Sunday its mixture
of young and long-established players conquered the Festival Theatre's
tricky acoustics and showed that Handel performed in the traditional ECO
manner still has plenty to say for itself.
With the alert young Stephanie Gonley as leader, and the inexhaustible
Neil Black as principal oboe, the B flat major concerto grosso, Op 3,
and No 2, served as prelude to an evening of beautifully prepared
performances.
Separating Walton and Vaughan Williams from each other with a small
piece of Rossini was perhaps a somewhat idiosyncratic decision, and
indeed the intrusive String Sonata No 1, demonstrated how these players,
when not strongly enough motivated, can slide into blandness.
But if they failed to reveal the whole charm and wit of Rossini, they
made amends in the poetry they brought to Walton's Henry V pieces and
Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending, with Stephanie Gonley as the most
idyllic of soloists in this most idyllic example of the English pastoral
school.
A smokily atmospheric account of Arvo Part's Fratres, filled with
slow, ritualistic drum-beats, and a dashingly streamlined presentation
of Tchaikovsky's string serenade completed the programme. With an
orchestra like this, the Festival Theatre's acoustics do not seem tricky
at all.

THERE are several very good reasons why the lantern procession has
never really caught on as one of Scotland's favourite pastimes. If it's
dark enough for lanterns and fireworks, it's winter: 10 degrees below
freezing with pelting rain and howling winds, or, as in the case of the
Rite of Spring, Fablevision's closing ceremony for the Eastwood's
Artsfeast, the main event is delayed until light fails, risking an
audience who are cold, losing patience and interest . . . not to mention
the midges?
The evening began well enough, blessed by spring weather and a healthy
crowd. A little behind schedule, we set off to Rouken Glen Park led by a
squad of gallus Park Rangers in oversize khaki shorts and bush hats. The
procession wound through the woods, passing a wee gang of kids dressed
as flower petals, engaged in their best Busby Berkley routine.
At the boat pond a glorious sunset almost stole the show while the
Spring Goddess drifted across the water to strains of ethereal music
emanting from a wee blue van, but all was not well! Winter Sprites,
hordes of kids dressed in an assortment of suitably chilly outfits,
careered along the bank side and King Winter refused to pass his staff
of leadership to Spring.
A timeless and essential ritual, perhaps, this marking of seasonal
change, but its painfully slow and undramatic enactment with crowds of
enthusiastic, but cold and somewhat bewildered children, tried the
patience of even the most sympathetic parent.
As they stood shivering in the now dark field, mutterings had risen to
shouts of ''Light the bonfire''. At last, flames lit up the giant effigy
of Spring, fireworks bursting overhead to offer finally, welcome release
and celebration.

I READ with interest Jim Traynor's ''Final Say'' on Donald Findlay's
comments on the three foreign players rule.
He believes it would damage Scottish football with an influx of
foreign players. Unfortunately he fails to realise that this rule has
now stopped so many Scottish players from seeking employment in
England's top teams. Ten years ago Scottish players were the backbone of
many a top English side in Europe. Now our players are denied the
opportunity to play to a higher standard and to experience European
football.
The three foreign players rule means Scottish clubs will never be able
to compete with leading continental sides and our national team will
continue to fade because not enough of our players have the chance to
play in other countries.

IF Jimmy Reid wishes to use The Herald for a sycophantic assessment of
the administrative abilities of Ernie Walker, the former SFA secretary,
I suppose that it is up to him and to you. I had always thought the word
had some connotation re balance and even-handed assessment.
In his attempt to establish his credentials, Jimmy referred to his
attendance (inferred) at the great Real Madrid-Eintracht Frankfurt game
at Hampden Park in 1959. Sorry, Jimmy, it was in 1960.
As far as hopes for a return to skilful football are concerned, I hope
Mr Walker's administrative abilities can help to create some structure
that will allow those with ability to be encouraged and developed -- we
surely need this desperately.
Unhappily there was little evidence during his last lengthy sojourn in
the higher echelons of the Scottish game that Mr Walker had much effect
in improving the skills of our game.
Let us hope the efforts to be made will focus on skill much more than
it was mentioned in Jimmy Reid's article.
Even where there is skill, the players involved are not given much
protection from referees who, in the interests of ''letting the game
flow'', ignore blatant pushing, jersey pulling, and obstruction. Until
this is effectively dealt with, increasing numbers will take themselves
and their cash elsewhere for entertainment.
Maybe this is the really serious aspect of the present situation that
worries the administrators -- the realisation, borne out by perusal of
the attendance statistics, that a lot of former fans are voting with
their feet and finding other entertainment more rewarding and a better
return for their money.
How many players do we have in Scotland who can perform like Davie
Cooper or Jimmy Johnstone? Five? Ten? Let us hope Mr Walker starts with
the referees and insists that players get the protection they need from
the hammer-throwers.

MICHAEL TUMELTY tells how an idea, born in a Glasgow restaurant, has
led to Britain' three Royal orchestras playing in each other's home
town.
AUNIQUE collaborative venture that will see Britain's three Royal
orchestras perform in each other's home cities was announced at the
Barbican in London yesterday.
The Royal Orchestral Exchange, sponsored by Royal Insurance as part of
its 150th anniversary celebrations, will bring the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra from London and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra to
Glasgow as part of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra's winter
season.
In the #185,000 deal, the three orchestras will visit each other's
halls -- the Barbican in London, Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall, and
Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall -- between October and December this year.
Top conductors will appear with each orchestra: Walter Weller with the
Royal SNO, Yuri Temirkanov with the RPO, and Libor Pesek with the RLPO.
The project has been extended to include a visit by each of the
orchestras to Birmingham's Symphony Hall, where the two English
orchestras play regularly. The unprecedented venture has thus been
fashioned into a 12-concert series: one by each of the three Royal
orchestras circulating around the four cities.
To mark Royal Insurance's 150th birthday, three works composed in 1845
will be included in the repertoire: Berlioz's Corsair Overture, Wagner's
Tannhauser, and Schumann's Piano Concerto. Dvorak symphonies will be the
other unifying theme: the Royal SNO will play the fifth, the RLPO the
sixth, and the RPO the eighth.
Paul Hughes, chief executive of the Royal SNO, said yesterday that the
concept of a collaboration between the three Royal orchestras was
actually born in a Glasgow restaurant, in a discussion with the general
manager of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
''We then approached the manager of the RLPO; everyone agreed it was a
good idea. We had talked it up into a programme and were starting to
look around for sponsors when, coincidentally, along came Royal
Insurance, looking for a way to mark their 150th anniversary.''
Hughes said that while it was a one-off venture for Royal Insurance,
the orchestras hoped it might be developed into a regular exchange:
''Either to encompass different venues, or even to invite other
orchestras to join us -- perhaps the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra from
Amsterdam.''
While the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, whose hall will host
each of the three Royal orchestras, is not part of the exchange, Hughes
said that the CBSO would be invited to Glasgow at a later date.

Shortly afterwards my then boss received a letter saying, if memory

LEST anyone be in any doubt, the articles on cycling in The Herald
(Perspective and news) signal an exciting new era for a city struggling
to cope with the problems of pollution, ill health, and environmental
damage caused by motor vehicles (April 24).
Councillor Gordon's commitment to spend serious money on a cycling
infrastructure is tantamount to a minor revolution. Privately he is a
great advocate of cycling and his determination to clean up our streets
should be applauded and supported.
There is great potential to develop a well-designed, safe, and
separate cycle network that encourages people to leave their cars at
home, particularly for short trips.
However, it's vitally important that the Scottish Office supports his
vision by allocating budgets for cycling and by helping the new unitary
authorities integrate cycling into their strategic planning.
Unfortunately it will take considerable time to convert rhetoric into
cycle lanes. In the meantime, given that 75% of all trips are less than
five miles, a substantial impact could be made if the business sector
encouraged bikes for commuting and on business.
The Glasgow Cycling Campaign has just written to Scottish Enterprise,
Glasgow Development Agency, Glasgow District Council, Strathclyde
Regional Council, the chamber of commerce, and the CBI offering help in
establishing a pro-bike policy.
We simply think that they should be setting an example.

THE only people who would benefit from Christopher Smith's suggestion
would be the driving instructors and not the trainee drivers (April 18).
I was successfully tutored by my father who also successfully coached
his wife, his sister-in-law, and my three sisters through their driving
tests.
Good, clear instructions, patience and more patience were the
important criteria displayed by my father. Familiarity with one's
trainer certainly instils a degree of confidence but as in all walks of
life an independent examination is the only fair way of assessing the
candidate's performance.
However, instead of sitting the driving test only once I would suggest
the Government reviews this and introduces a Resit Test after every 10
driving years. This would help maintain standards, eliminate bad habits,
and the extra revenue raised from these tests could go towards the
upkeep of the highways.
Drivers who successfully pass these resit tests would obviously be
more attractive to insurance companies (especially on passing at first
attempt) and they would be rewarded with lower insurance premiums.

POWER is leaching from Scotland, not in terms of volts, watts or
however you wish to measure electrical activity on a commercial scale,
but in a form every bit as tangible and potent. The power to make
decisions and to control events here, rather than have them passed on
from elsewhere, is vital to the sustenance of the economy. If decisions
affecting Scottish industry and commerce cannot be made in Scotland it
is obvious and provable that the best decision-makers will go elsewhere.
This is devastating for development and for hopes of economic success.
It is in this context that the latest tawdry manoeuvrings over the
future of Scottish Nuclear, which we report this morning, must be
viewed. The Government has a peculiarly difficult problem in that it
needs substantial sums of revenue to provide the tax cuts on which it
believes its hopes of electoral success depend. Government finances are
not, however, doing well. The public sector borrowing requirement is
uncomfortably large and rising. The International Monetary Fund is of
the opinion that taxes may have to be raised because of the decline in
the value of the pound and that the budget deficit must take priority
over tax cuts.
Unfortunately for the Chancellor, the family silver drawer has already
been ransacked and the contents sold off. Anything that could be
privatised has been privatised and the tarnished little spoons lurking
at the back of the drawer in the form of Railtrack or the Post Office
are either politically or economically impossible. This has encouraged
the Government to think the previously unthinkable and to hasten the
privatisation of the last substantial spoon, the nuclear power industry.
Two questions emerge from this radical and alarming proposal, the first
of which concerns the wisdom of privatising this industry at all. It can
only be sold if the ageing Magnox reactors, which require hideously
expensive decommissioning, are withdrawn from the equation. This is the
Government's intention, and it will result in the public purse bearing
the cost of decommissioning while investors gather the benefits of the
modern reactors. Even with the admission that all government is a matter
of balancing books, of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, this amounts to
fiscal lunacy. It is a fraud and an imposition on the public and an
insult in that the reason behind the sale is the electoral survival of
the governing party.
Then there is the question of the Scottish dimension, consideration of
which makes the affair even more galling. The likely Government
proposals to subsume Scottish Nuclear in a holding company with the
English Nuclear Electric Company are yet another insult, this time to
the intelligence. The Government has insufficient time before the next
General Election to sell the nuclear power organisations in the same
manner as other privatisations because of the complexity of transferring
operating licences. The proposals suggested as a solution would
effectively put Scottish Nuclear under the control of the English
organisation, though attempts could be made to disguise this by such
stratagems as the granting of an imposing brass nameplate in East
Kilbride which could then masquerade as a national head office. This
confidence trick has been tried before, notably in the cases of Guinness
and TSB. We may have been deceived then, but we will not be deceived
again. The merger is also a breach of faith by the Government, as Sir
Donald Miller makes clear in a letter to us this morning. Lastly, and
even under the Government's own ideological beliefs, the holding company
suggestion is ridiculous because it creates one large company, thereby
obliterating the holy grail of competition. Nobody, outside of its
promoters, has a good word to say for the sale of nuclear electricity as
a single entity. It is yet another Government mess in the making, driven
by political considerations, fuelled by fear of electoral rejection, and
all the more despicable for it.

Liz Lochhead is in her busy phase as a glance at the Mayfest programme
will testify. Sara Villiers talks to the festival's most featured
writer.
EVEN Paul Bassett, artistic director of Mayfest, agrees that this
year's arts bash has turned out to be something of a Lizfest, but
tracking down Liz Lochhead, the most featured writer of '95 festival
turns out to be easier than anticipated.
Door-stepping activities and huge bribes prove unnecessary to lure her
to spend a few hours discussing her prolificness over lunch. Indeed, she
seemed rather disconcerted that I assumed she would be so busy. ''Oh
dear, yes,'' she says, checking the date, ''I should probably be
knee-deep in rehearsals just now.''
Perhaps, considering that she is both directing and appearing in her
Scottish adaptation of Moliere's Tartuffe at the Tron, and writing and
performing in a late-night cabaret with Michael Marra at the same venue
in In Flagrant Delicht.
''I better get together with Michael soon,'' she muses. Her version of
The Tempest for young people, The Magic Island, is to be performed by
TAG at the Mitchell Theatre, Blood And Ice is at the Ramshorn Theatre,
while even the short film she scripted for Tartan Shorts, Latin In A
Dark Room, puts in an appearance as part of the GFT's Mayfest programme.
She's also patron of Play Girls, an initiative of the Traverse Theatre
Women Writers Group, which will showcase work at the Tron on May 6.
That's quite a presence, Liz.
''Mmm, my husband keeps teasing me that it is ''Moifest'', shrugs
Lochhead, pointing out that she also, unintentionally, staged a similar
takeover at Mayfest some years ago when four of her shows were part of
the programme.
''I go through phases,'' she explains. ''Sometimes I disappear and
stay at home scribbling poems and short stories and sometimes I get
really involved with working with people.'' She's just taken a breather
with a short sojourn at her caravan on the West Coast but this is very
much her year for collaborative projects.
Aside from the Mayfest involvement, Dundee Rep Theatre are about to
stage her luscious, lust-filled adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula
opening on May 5 -- also being performed by Stirling University students
at the MacRobert this week. She's also just penned another short film
script Scrabble, is working with Scottish playwright George Rosie: ''on
something which might or might not come off'', and is co-scripting a
screenplay -- ''a wild fantasy thing'' -- with the drama documentarist
Michael Eaton for Channel 4.
It's a busy schedule, which actually necessitates her taking a
touch-typing course to speed up her working methodology, so it's
difficult to credit her insistence that she is ''very lazy''. I raised a
sceptical eyebrow. ''No, really,'' she insists. ''I need the adrenalin
of pressure and deadlines to get anything done. I have to bite off more
than I can chew, like the show with Michael Marra, which I have been
wanting to do for years.''
Her forthcoming flurry of activity revolves around her involvement
with Tartuffe. This will be the second production for the show she
successfully staged at the Gilded Balloon during the Fringe last year,
under the auspices of her own production company, Nippy Sweeties. Her
adaptation was originally commission by Ian Wooldridge for the Royal
Lyceum Theatre and while Lochhead has very much enjoyed the various
productions of her play over the last decade she has itched to get her
hands on it herself.
''I've always wanted to explore and emphasise the family power
relationships of the play, the domesticity of the tensions, locating it
in a post-war setting which draws on my own childhood memories. Finally
I plucked up the courage to direct it myself, depending on favours from
actors I knew.''
Despite rave reviews and good audience turnouts it was very much a
labour of love, a profit share with no profits, with Lochhead taking a
#1000 bath.
''It was worth it,'' she considers but admits such dramatic
exploration is a pretty expensive hobby. Thankfully, the Post Office
have sponsored this Mayfest production which means the nine-strong cast
will at least be paid Equity rates, although it's still very much a case
of mucking in regarding staging. Guests to the Lochhead household during
May can look forward to sitting on the floor. ''Half my furniture will
be on stage,'' laughs the indefatigable Lochhead.

A FUNNY thing happened to me on my way to the theatre last night.
Bursting through several confusingly similar-looking doors in quick
succession, I lost both my memory and my trousers, and fell forward
heavily on to two policemen who were each spattered in crimson paint and
wearing pink pinnies. At this precise moment, a nun, a frock-maker, my
two wives, and a transvestite appeared.
Naturally, espying me with my trousers a-gley atop the reddened
policemen, the chance quintet of passers-by assumed I was engaged in a
multiplicity of homosexual acts. At length I was able to resolve
everything by shouting ''Not on my wife you don't!'' in a manly
baritone.
Meanwhile, in an astonishing coincidence, a similar set of accidental
activities were taking place on the stage in a drama nigh on 30 years
old. Doors slammed. Women screamed. Men minced. Telly personages much
loved in 1972 could be seen mugging with heroic amiability. More doors
slammed. Relations became muddied.
In addition, telephone conversations were graphically misunderstood,
along with a host of innocent words -- bullocks, queer, cucumber -- and
wholesome phrases, eg, ''My husband can put his hand to most things''
and ''If I were you, I'd take his trousers down and give him the
treatment.''
At one point things got so confused that Windsor Davies assumed that
Ian Lavender was Robin Askwith, ie, Britt Ekland's husband. Shortly
afterwards, Britt Ekland assumed that Ian Lavender, Robin Askwith, and
Windsor Davies were all homosexual. Laugh?
I couldn't, frankly. I had stumbled into darkest British Farceland,
where the sun never rises and playwright Ray Cooney's nib never dries.
If you journey there yourself before Saturday, familiarise yourself with
the exit doors.

YESTERDAY afternoon a friend from a TV production company in Cheshire
called me up to see if I knew of any Scottish musicals based around hit
songs. I had to tell him that apart from one or two small-scale shows,
there was very little of that kind going on. Except there was Three
Steps to Heaven, written by Glasgow's David Cosgrove and originally
staged by Edinburgh's First Base Theatre Company, which has been picked
up by the Chester Gateway for a major British tour.
And I mean major. It opened in Edinburgh last night after a month on
the road and it'll be October before it makes its way back round to
Glasgow again. Such success is just about unheard of in Scotland, which
is probably why it took an English company to think of it.
The show imagines Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens
ending up in a celestial no-man's land immediately after their fatal air
crash -- a place where time jumps backwards, forwards, and sideways as
the plot requires. It's a versatile device that allows Cosgrove to
comment on everything from the history of rock'n'roll to white American
racism with a few anachronistic gags thrown in for good measure.
But a meandering storyline and too much metaphysical psychoanalysis
can seem like Five Characters in Search of a Musical, even if it is
refreshing to hear some of those fifties standards played in a stripped
down narrative setting.
It's the rock'n'roll that the audience is here for and, happily, when
it comes, it's delivered in rattling good form. Hell, there was even
dancing in the aisles.

THE Weekender profile on chef Frances Atkins contains some untruths
which cannot be allowed to remain unchallenged (April 22).
The story alleges that Mrs Atkins signed a contract with me as chief
executive of the Scottish Tourist Board preventing her from cooking in
Scotland for three years. This version of events may lead your readers
to assume that the chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board is in
possession of some statutory powers to exile hoteliers to London.
Plainly, he is not.
These events took place in 1991 and 1992, at least two years before I
became chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board in 1994. They
involved an initial investment in and the subsequent acquisition of the
Farleyer House Hotel in Aberfeldy by a company of which I was a
director.
In such circumstances it is standard practice for there to be a
''restrictive covenant'' under which the sellers agree not to establish
a competing business or undertake competing employment in the area for a
limited period.
This agreement was signed between the company and Mrs Atkins and not
between myself and Mrs Atkins. Frances Atkins continued to be employed
at Farleyer House Hotel as head chef until May 1993.
She resigned voluntarily without any pressure to do so by the
management of the hotel.
I have always operated in business life with openness and integrity.
Aware of a potential conflict of interest, as soon as I became chief
executive of the Scottish Tourist Board in 1994 I resigned three
directorships associated with Farleyer House Hotel.

THE French electorate has a refreshing habit of administering a
reproving slap to politicians who assume too much, as Mr Jacques Chirac
has cause to recall. Nevertheless the latest caution to Mr Chirac, who
remains the most probable winner of the May 7 final presidential ballot,
was not delivered with any sense of elan. French voters are tired and
disillusioned and notably uninspired by the presidential candidates who
have presented themselves in recent months. Of Mr Balladur, the Prime
Minister and defeated right-wing candidate, there is little to be said.
He has been a successful Prime Minister and he capitalised on his air of
gravitas, soundness, and dignity. It would have been better if he had
remained content with both the job and the image, for his presidential
campaign looked stodgy rather than sound, and latterly tacky as he
unconvincingly tried to match Mr Chirac's legendary energy. The
extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen has similarly retired and will not appear in
hopeful-presidential guise again. He has departed the ballot in some
style, with a record 15% vote for his National Front party, but it is
wrong to assume that he will play the role of power broker. He is
powerless to direct the votes of his supporters in the second round and,
although many will vote for Mr Chirac, a proportion will also give their
votes to the Socialist candidate, Mr Jospin, out of class loyalty. The
key to National Front success lies in local government polls in the
summer, and that will be quite a different matter.
Mr Chirac, who virtually split the right-wing votes with Mr Balladur,
still only managed second place behind the surprisingly successful Mr
Jospin. As a late entrant to the contest after his party failed to
entice Mr Jacques Delors to stand, Mr Jospin has done astonishingly
well. He will have to knit together the various left-wing factions and
maintain the ebullience which marked the latter stages of his campaign.
It will not be easy: in presidential terms, the Socialists have been
marred by scandals, by unemployment, and by the resulting disillusion of
the voters. Mr Jospin may have led the poll in the first round, but the
Socialist vote was markedly down on that of the last two presidential
elections and it is impossible for him to acquire the charisma of Mr
Francois Mitterrand at his peak.
The best arithmetic suggests that the overall left vote in the second
round should be roughly 40%. This is far short of the overall right vote
which will presumably go to Mr Chirac, but Mr Jospin may yet benefit
from the large numbers of voters who appear uncommitted and who are
repelled by Mr Chirac. At the moment it looks as if the Mayor of Paris
will become the President of France. It is what Mr Chirac has always
wanted and he has spread his energy and his promises widely in an
attempt to achieve his goal. The effort has not been repaid in votes and
this suggests that a likely Chirac presidency, no matter what votes he
achieves in the second round, will not provide the French with the
strong President they desire.

ACCORDING to press reports, a final decision is expected this week on
whether to merge Scottish Nuclear with the English Nuclear Electric
Company to facilitate a single offer for sale in the forthcoming
privatisation.
Scots should recognise this for what it is -- yet a further assault on
Scottish institutions inflicted by a Whitehall bureaucracy and
London-based advisers insensitive to opinion north of the Border.
It is easy to envisage the arguments put to Government by the
financial advisers for the convenience of a single sale, arguments
remarkably similar to those which led, under Labour administrations, to
the concentration of Scottish industry in nationalised corporations
based in England and which has contributed to the progressive
elimination under both nationalised and privatised regimes of Scottish
industries such as steelmaking.
The fact that a Scottish operation can point to unprecedented
productivity counts for little.
If this merger were to go ahead, Scots could of course expect the
usual attempts at being bought off by the now ritual sops such as offers
of a semi-autonomous subsidiary company, local management, and perhaps
even a national head office located in Scotland a la Guinness.
By now we know from hard experience just what value to place on such
assurances. Any Conservative Government which treated the Scottish
electorate with such contempt could hardly be surprised at its failure
to regenerate support in Scotland.
On a personal level I would regard such a merger as akin to a breach
of faith by the Government.
When, as chairman of ScottishPower, I agreed with the Secretary of
State for Scotland, the Rt Hon Malcolm Rifkind, that it was no longer
practicable to keep the Scottish nuclear stations in the Scottish
electricity privatisation following the decision to withdraw them in
England and Wales, it was on the clear understanding that they would
remain a separate Scottish entity, based in Scotland, with Scottish
electricity consumers continuing to receive the benefits of the Scottish
plants' good performance through exclusive energy sales contracts with
ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric.
That agreement was fully honoured by the Government at the time and I
would hope that Malcolm Rifkind and Ian Lang will have lost no
opportunity to remind their Cabinet colleagues of all the factors in
that agreement.
Any government has a duty to consider wider questions, not least that
of a sensible industrial structure.
The structure introduced in the 1950s in which Scottish interests were
served by Scottish institutions in electricity generation has served
Scotland well -- as indicated by the high performance of Scottish
generating plant over the years and generally lower tariffs.
All these factors should surely weigh more heavily in the Government's
decision-making than that of the convenience of a one-off sale.
Alternative structures have far more to offer, for the Government and
for Scotland, whether selling Scottish Nuclear as a separate and
successful company or a trade sale to a consortium of the two Scottish
electricity companies and perhaps a couple of electricity distribution
companies from the North of England.
Either would avoid creating the type of monolithic structure which the
Government has gone to such lengths to avoid in recent privatisations
and preserve for Scotland an outstandingly successful operation built up
by Scots over the past 25 years.
Let's hope that good sense will yet prevail.

THERE is not much to say about Mondays. Next month, though, there will
be a lot to be said for them. They will be best days. For some people
May will be made merrier by the cancelling of three of them.
Instead of being the off-days at the start of the week, they will be
days off.
For 1674 years since the introduction of the seven-day week, by
Emperor Constantine, there has not been a month so holey with hols.
Never has the calendar of early summer been so civilised.
For the extra break thank Hitler. A Monday-plus is down to him. His
defeat brings a one-off victory over the longness of weeks.
Not everybody will win a medal. Newspaper people and other
shelf-fillers will still stand by their beds. So will the other ranks of
those employers who have forgotten already that there was a war on.
Moonstruck by the calling off of so many moon days, they have blacked
out the red-letter dates and inked them back in for toil.
Only for those and such as those will all the benign Mondays be what
are quaintly called bank holidays.
Most public servants, as they in their turn are quaintly called, will
decide that the world will continue to wag without them. Trains have
promised holiday timetables. And life's deep mystery about when your
dustbin will be emptied will be made deeper.
Ordinary Mays which are twice Mondayless can be nervy enough. On these
spare days only time-planners and diary-keepers with a statutory turn of
mind can remember what places are open or shut. Anybody sharp enough to
have ticked off in advance the free Mondays hardly needs them.
Like all divisions of time -- months in a year; hours in a day --
treating seven days as the same when they are all unequal and lumping
them into a unit called a week is a daft arrangement. Odder is how less
equal than the others Mondays persist in being. They ought to have
withered away long ago.
Yet even people who have no jobs to drag themselves to get that
morning feeling. Much the same sorrow visits those whose weekend
partying delays the start of the week. In their ideal world the core
time for toil seems to start latish on Tuesday mornings to taper off
earlyish on Thursday afternoons.
Yet Monday's blueness endures. Its glum dawn does not change, while
all else around it does. Although Sundays have been broken to become
just another day, the day after Sunday stays the same. Its coming still
starts with the heavy thought that the whole weary world will have to be
re-invented before you can get back on to it. For some the gloom is
worse than for others.
Monday's child who was least fair of face was Brenda Spence about whom
the Boom Town Rats sang their I Don't Like Mondays song. She was the San
Diego schoolgirl who in 1979 shot dead her headteacher and a janitor and
wounded nine others. ''Something to do,'' she explained. ''I don't like
Mondays.''
Glad remedies against Mondays are scarce. To mind comes only the
Polyanna cure. Her hearty formula was to greet the morn of Mon. as the
best part of the week because at no other time would it be so long until
next Monday.
Other serene optimists are no help, especially the namely poets. Their
advice to seize every day and live it, while sound in a general way, is
too much to take first thing after a good weekend. As usual with the
purveyors of useful wisdom Anonymous has come closest.
Traditional lines about Solomon Grundy emphasised with bleak
jauntiness the shortness of mortal days in verses with the added value
of nibbling their way down a page with minimal effort, while leaving
agreeable amounts of white space alongside:
Solomon Grundy,
Born on Monday,
Christened on Tuesday,
Married on Wednesday,
Took ill on Thursday,
Worse on Friday,
Died on Saturday.
This is the end of
Solomon Grundy.
Although admirably brief, the poem would be better as a six-day cycle.
Monday could be removed without loss because the Friday line is
superfluous. A further shortening of Grundy's brief life would brighten
everybody else's.
Strangely, one power in the land to have a shot at abolishing Monday
was Oliver Cromwell. Cobblers! he said to it.
When the puritan army was garrisoned at Perth, a zealous campaigner
called Monday perished. In a competition for the best poem about him the
prize entry came from a city shoemaker:
Blessed be the Sabbath Day,
And cursed be worldly pelf.
Tuesday will begin the week,
Since Monday's hanged himself.
On the strength of the stanza Cromwell was pleased to reward all
cobblers a standing holiday on Mondays.
Some time after Cromwell in this newspaper I lumbered a feature with
the label of Monday Morning. It was reckoned the most off-putting title
for a column in the history of journalism. To me it seemd apt, the
contents being devoted to work, the creation of wealth, labour's
dignity, and such good loin-girding stuff. As a feature it lasted not a
lot longer than one week. There is not much to say about Mondays.

A PUBLIC consultation exercise will be the first major initiative of
the new shadow City of Glasgow Council.
The council's ruling Labour Group wants to get the public's views on
how the new authority should operate and what its priorities should be.
Labour councillors meeting in private yesterday set up four working
groups to consider how best the exercise should be carried out. It could
involve meetings with community councils, schools boards, tenants'
groups, and disadvantaged groups.
The Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, said: ''We've given a
commitment to the electorate in our manifesto that we'd have public
consultation and we'll honour that commitment.''
The vexed question of housing repairs, or the lack of them, could be
one of the consultation issues. Mr Gould explained: ''We've taken stick
over repairs in the Pollok area. We'll perhaps have to set up a
mechanism whereby people can see if they are getting a proper repairs
service and, if not, be given the reasons why.''
Meanwhile, the shadow authority could well have a chief executive by
the end of the week. Twenty applications for the #96,000-a-year post
have been received and it is expected a short leet will be drawn up
after today's district council meeting.
This will be decided by a special panel set up at yesterday's Labour
Group meeting. A further three panels will appoint high-ranking officers
within the council.
It was also disclosed yesterday that Councillor Pat Lally would remain
leader of the current district council until the new authority takes
over next April.
Nominations for the district council Labour Group leadership closed
yesterday and Mr Lally was not challenged. He commented: ''I will be
delighted to lead the council in its last year of existence. It is a
testing time for local government and we will work towards making the
changeover as smooth as possible.''
Ealier this month, Mr Lally was narrowly defeated by his old rival,
Councillor Jean McFadden, for the convenership of the new shadow
authority. However, it is expected he will mount a challenge for the
lord provostship when the shadow authority assumes full powers next
April.

families would have to take them 60 miles to another hospital.
In one case, micro-surgery proved to be too late and the child's

A PROSTITUTE and her boyfriend who hid more than #1000 worth of heroin
internally were each jailed for five years yesterday.
Elaine Paterson, 28, hid seven packages of the powdered drug in a
condom inside her vagina and James Scott, 42, had several packages in
his rectum, the High Court in Edinburgh was told.
The pair were stopped by police on the Dundee by-pass as they were
driving to Aberdeen from Glasgow where they had picked up the drugs.
At police headquarters in Aberdeen, they admitted they were concealing
heroin internally.
Paterson, of Bedford Avenue, Aberdeen, pleaded guilty to being
concerned in the supply of heroin between March 1 and March 21 last year
at her home. She also admitted having heroin in her home on October 10
last year.
Paterson, and Scott, of Seaton Drive, Aberdeen, pleaded guilty to
having heroin in their possession in a car while travelling between
Glasgow and Aberdeen on January 6 and 7 this year.
Jailing Paterson and Scott, temporary Judge Robin MacEwan said: ''It
has been said many times in the High Court that the misuse of drugs is a
scourge in this country.
''It is well known that the use of hard drugs is injurious to health
and is, generally, harmful to the community.
''The resources of the state have to be devoted to the prevention,
detection, and prosecution of people who take drugs or are concerned in
their supply.''
The judge said both accused had extensive criminal records.
Defence counsel for Scott, Mrs Mhairi Richards, said her client had
hadan ''extreme'' heroin habit over many years.
Defence counsel for Paterson, Mr Jack Davidson, said his client was
also a heroin addict who made her living from prostitution.
Mr James Campbell, prosecuting, told the High Court that Scott and
Paterson had had a relationship for three years. The Crown accepted that
both had a history of heroin addiction.
Police had been tipped off that the accused were travelling to Glasgow
to acquire further supplies of heroin. They were arrested at a filling
station at Kingsway West, Dundee, on their way back to Aberdeen.
At police HQ in Aberdeen, they both admitted having heroin concealed
inside them, and claimed they had paid a Glasgow dealer between #1200
and #1300 for the drugs. Paterson also admitted supplying three #20
packets of heroin to three named people.
Both admitted they each contributed money to buy the heroin supply.
At the start of the hearing, the Crown accepted a plea of not guilty
to possession of heroin at Bedford Avenue, Aberdeen, on October 10 last
year from Ms Lana Graham, 26, of Elphinstone Court, Aberdeen.

<HEADLINE>Lanark Blue decision this week.  Judge to decide future of cheese</HEADLINE>

THE future of Scotland's Lanark Blue cheese now lies in the hands of a
Court of Session judge.
Mr Humphrey Errington, of Dunsyre, in Lanarkshire, will know by the
end of this week whether he can continue to make the cheese, reputedly a
favourite with the Royal Family.
He has asked the Court of Session to overturn the decision condemning
44 batches of his cheese, which a Justice of the Peace ruled was
potentially hazardous to public health and unfit for human consumption
after hearing that traces of listeria had been detected.
Mr Errington claimed he was denied natural justice when he was refused
the right to cross examine witnesses at the hearing before the JP
earlier this year. He has already secured an order to prevent the
existing cheese being destroyed before a ruling is made in the present
case.
After hearing closing arguments in Edinburgh yesterday, Lord Weir said
he hoped to be in a position to give his decision by the end of this
week.
Later, Mr Errington, 50, said he faced going out of business --
jeopardising the jobs of seven staff -- if the decision to destroy the
#27,000 worth of the blue-veined semi-hard Lanark Blue, which has been
frozen, was endorsed by the judge.
Mr Errington stressed that his cheese was ''absolutely safe'' and that
63,000 portions had been consumed between October and December last year
with no reports of illness.
''If we lose this case, there is no future for farmhouse cheesemaking
in Britain,'' he said, adding that the implications of the case needed
to be discussed at a high level between the specialist cheese producers
and the Government.
Earlier, the Court of Session heard that scientific tests revealed
traces of listeria in the cheese up to 5000 times above acceptable
Government guidelines.
The court was told a sample of Lanark Blue was tested by environmental
health officials in Edinburgh and found to contain listeria
monocytogenes at 13 times the acceptable level.
Officials from Clydesdale District Council, the authority governing
the area where the cheese is produced, found levels at 190 times the
guidelines.
Mr Colin Sutherland, QC, for the council, said subsequent laboratory
tests found 44 of 50 batches of the cheese tested were contaminated with
listeria. The most extreme was more than 5000 times the recommended
level.
He said experts had claimed that, although the disease listeriosis --
caused by the bacteria -- was rare, it carried a high risk of death.
He argued that when JP Mrs Elizabeth Wilson took the decision to
condemn the cheese, she was acting in an administrative function, rather
than a judicial one.
However, Mr Michael Jones, QC, for Mr Errington, said they had wanted
to cross-examine witnesses at the hearing before the JP and, as they had
been denied the chance, her decision should be ruled void.

THE saga over allegations about drugs and money laundering in Paisley
took a new twist last night with a series of answers from the Government
to Paisley North Labour MP Irene Adams.
Mrs Adams has put herself in the forefront of the campaign against
drugs in the area, despite alleged threats to her family, and last week
tabled detailed parliamentary questions about the activities of the
Ferguslie Park Partnership and Ferguslie Community Business Securities.
The MP has claimed that FCB was being used as a front for ''illegal
activities,'' but last night the Government put the ball firmly back
into Mrs Adams's court.
In a series of responses to her questions, Scottish Office Minister
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton gave details of the amount of Government
money channelled into various projects in the area, but took a hands-off
approach about Scottish Office involvement in the two organisations at
the centre of Mrs Adams's claims.
Mrs Adams pledged last night to fight on, despite the Scottish Office
answers. She said: ''My reaction is that these are not the answers I had
hoped for, but they are what I had expected.
''The Secretary of State really cannot wash his hands of this and it
is remiss of him to try to walk away from it. I am not backing down.''
One of her questions was whether the Secretary of State would
''arrange for an inquiry into the accounts of Ferguslie Park Community
Business Securities, its holding company or companies and their
predecessors.''
She also wanted an assurance that the scope of the inquiry would
include employment practices and accounting procedures.
Lord James told her: ''My Right Hon. Friend (Mr Lang) has no
involvement in the management of the companies and has no locus to
establish such an inquiry.''
Mrs Adams also wanted a list of the number, and sources, of
representations received by the Secretary of State or the Ferguslie Park
Partnership into the activities of Ferguslie Community Business
Securities, their holding companies and predecessors, to which Lord
James replied: ''No such representations have been received.''
Mrs Adams wanted copies of the annual reports of FCB Securities, FCB
holding companies and the Ferguslie Park Partnership placed in the
library.
Lord James said: ''The Secretary of State has no involvement in the
management of either FCB Securities or Ferguslie Park Community Holdings
Ltd and does not, therefore, hold copies of their annual reports. These
should be available from Companies House.''
The Minister said the Scottish Office is not and had not been involved
in the running of any of the businesses referred to by Mrs Adams --
though urban programme grants had been received for the purchase of such
as the acquisition and improvement of premises, purchase of equipment
and management and administrative costs.
The Ferguslie Park Partnership, he said, was a ''voluntary grouping of
parties dedicated to the regeneration of the area.'' As such, it did not
produce annual accounts and so there was no external auditor.
The Secretary of State was not aware of any inquiries into the
operation of FCB with regard to compliance with the laws and regulations
governing insolvency and bankruptcy, and no reports had been made by the
Accounts Commissioners for Scotland into FCB Securities, FCB holding
companies or their predecessors, or Ferguslie Park Partnership.
Mrs Adams asked whether the Secretary of State would make a statement
on the scope of investigations and inquiries which ''have been and are
being conducted by the Charity Commissioners into FCB Securities or its
holding companies, and when the reports will be published.''
Lord James said: ''The supervision of charities in Scotland is the
responsibility of the Lord Advocate and the supervision legislation is
implemented by the Scottish Charities Office. No investigations have
been or are being conducted into Ferguslie Park Community Holdings Ltd
by the Scottish Charities Office.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''We have no comment to
make beyond the fact that we have given very comprehensive, factual
answers to questions. We have no locus to become involved in any further
inquiries.''

BRITAIN will not be following the lead of the United States in paying
compensation to alleged victims of the so-called Gulf War Syndrome,
junior Defence Minister Lord Henley made clear yesterday.
He told the Lords: ''Although we retain an open mind on the question
of Gulf-related illness, our examination of more than 200 British Gulf
veterans has so far failed to reveal any evidence of the alleged Gulf
War Syndrome.''
He added: ''I accept that President Clinton has authorised a programme
of award payments to US Gulf veterans suffering from undiagnosed
symptoms.
''But this should not be taken to mean that the US Government
acknowledges the existence of the Gulf-related condition or that it is
compensation in the legal sense.''

The industry's regulator explains to Elizabeth Buie why he is against
the merger.
THE creation of a single UK nuclear company is likely to face
opposition from Offer, the electricity industry's regulator. The
Director General of Electricity Supply, Professor Stephen Littlechild,
is adamant that a merger of Scottish Nuclear and its larger neighbour,
Nuclear Electric, would reduce competition in power generation.
A Cabinet determined to privatise the nuclear generating industry --
minus Nuclear Electric's first generation Magnox stations -- has three
options: to leave the companies as they are; merge them; or transfer
some stations from one company to the other. The difficulty with leaving
them unchanged is that Scottish Nuclear, with only two stations, is
thought to be too small to be viable in the long run, particularly when
it has to finance a replacement for its older station at Hunterston
early next century.
Nuclear Electric favours a merger because of the added strength and
credibility that an enlarged company would have. It says the merged
companies (minus the Magnoxes) would account for only 22% of the UK
electricity generating market, and within that, only 18% of the market
in England and Wales.
The third option would be to reallocate two of Nuclear Electric's
advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) -- probably Heysham 1 and 2 in
Lancashire -- to Scottish Nuclear, and create two equal-sized companies
with four stations and about 11% of the market each. Although this would
enhance competition, some fear that this would leave both nuclear
companies too small to be credible players internationally.
In his submission to the Government's Nuclear Review last October, the
regulator, Professor Littlechild, argued that a reallocation of capacity
between the two nuclear generators would strengthen competition, both
north and south of the Border. Nothing in the six months since that
submission has caused him to change his mind.
''Such reallocations would protect customers against the nuclear
companies' market power. They would also enhance incentives for the
efficient operation of existing stations, increase competition in
generation, provide greater choice to customers and increase diversity
of decision-making on new capacity,'' he said.
He added: ''Nuclear Electric has a significant role in the electricity
market in England and Wales. It has an ability to influence the market
through its position in both the pool and the contract market. I have
earlier expressed concern that its policy may have restricted choice and
increased prices.
''It could well become the second largest generator this year. It will
have a market share of 25% or more, which it will be able to maintain at
least over the rest of this century. Its market share and market power
could increase in future if it is able to construct or purchase new
plant.''
Scottish Nuclear, too, is seen by Offer as having an indirect
influence on the Scottish market, and by 2005, when it can choose how to
sell its output, will have a direct role in the market in Scotland. At
that stage, even without further plant construction, Scottish Nuclear's
own output is likely to account for a third of the total generation
market in Scotland, or nearer a half if output related to the
interconnectors is excluded, giving the company significant market
power.
Professor Littlechild warned: ''Given the significant market power of
the two nuclear companies, and their opportunities to extend this, it is
important to ensure that nuclear companies are not subsidised in such a
way as to distort their output, pricing and investment decisions.''
He added: ''This would have adverse effects on economic efficiency,
the extent of competition, other market participants, customers and
taxpayers. This applies whatever the ownership of the companies, but
could well be a more significant concern if the companies were
privatised.''
The regulator also recommended that a ''desirable development'' would
be to reconsider the ownership of the AGR and PWR (pressurised water
reactor) nuclear plants in Britain with a view to promoting competition
and protecting customers against the nuclear companies' market power.
''Reallocations of nuclear capacity would strengthen competition in
England and Wales, and in the longer term in Scotland also. This would,
in addition, enhance incentives for the efficient operation of existing
stations, increase competition in generation, provide greater choice to
customers and increase diversity of decision-making on new capacity.
''They would significantly reduce the regulatory concerns surrounding
the present market power of the two nuclear companies, thereby reducing
regulatory uncertainties, including those of potential shareholders.''

<HEADLINE>Man who threw stones at train is jailed</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A MAN who threw stones at a 110mph InterCity express train was jailed
for five years yesterday.
Judge William Allardice told Simon Hawkes, 20, unemployed, that he had
committed an ''act of utter recklessness'' when he threw stones at the
train with intent to injure or endanger the lives of passengers.
Hawkes was also convicted at Stafford Crown Court earlier this month
of assaulting train driver Mr Barry Hart, from Crewe in Cheshire, and of
damaging the train's windscreen.
Two 15-year-old boys, whose names were not disclosed for legal
reasons, were sentenced to 11 months' and six months' detention
respectively in a young offenders' institution for their part in the
attack.
Hawkes, of Dormer Avenue, Bolehall, Tamworth, Staffordshire, had
denied the charges and had not given evidence.
However, the two 15-year-olds, also from Tamworth, admitted
endangering the safety of passengers by throwing stones. They further
admitted assaulting the driver and damaging the train's windscreen. One
of the boys admitted assaulting a person unknown.
Judge Allardice told them yesterday: ''I am not going to give a
lecture on the gravity of offences of throwing stones at trains or buses
or cars.
''It is so obvious that this is a serious incident which the public
can well themselves accept. There is an element of deterrent in the
sentence I am going to pass.''
Mr Simon Tonking, prosecuting, said the London to Carlisle train had
been ''ambushed'' in April last year as it passed under Monkey Bridge, a
mile from Tamworth station.
He said the trio had put stone ballast into socks, which they then
threw at the passing train.
''The windscreen was shattered and the driver had glass in his eyes
but managed to stop the train a mile down the track. He was taken to
hospital and was off work for seven months,'' said Mr Tonking.
Mr Ben Nichols, defending Hawkes, said: ''Intellectually and
emotionally he is extremely immature for his years.
''He was not the instigator but took part in a joint enterprise. His
family has suffered and his father has not condoned in any way his son's
conduct.''
Mr Paul Farrer, lawyer for one of the boys, said: ''This was a
misguided prank. It never crossed his mind for one moment that he might
cause injury or present a danger to people on the train.''
He added: ''His regret for what he did is genuine.''
Mr John Evans, lawyer representing the other boy, said: ''He gave his
participation no thought at all. He just did what everyone else was
doing.
''It was infantile and immensely stupid but he admitted his
responsibility straight away.''

AT dawn 80 years ago today, the first major amphibious operation in
modern warfare stained the sea red with blood around the Gallipoli
peninsula in Turkey.
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames will head a British party at a
commemoration service for the bungled campaign in which hundreds of
thousands of men were killed and injured.
The Lancashire Fusiliers won six VCs before breakfast as small boats
ferried British, Australian, New Zealand, and French forces. The Turks
held their machine-gun fire until the boats were practically touching
the shore. The result was devastating. Boatloads of dead men, with not a
single survivor, rolled in the surf.
Men struggled ashore on five beaches only to be shot as they became
entangled on barbed wire that reached to the water's edge.
Gallipoli provided the textbooks for D-Day and the Falklands operation
at a terrible price. The planners combined such novelties as aircraft,
radio communications, and submarines, but provided only one
flat-bottomed assault craft, an adapted Clyde steamer.
A British airman reported that the sea for a distance of 50yds was
''absolutely red with blood''.
The alerted enemy cut a marker buoy so that boats carrying Australians
and New Zealanders missed their destination by a mile to land at a
cliff-fringed bay they made known for all time as Anzac Cove.
Instead of an advance to Constantinople, the landings were followed by
eight months of trench warfare. Every attack and counter-attack ended in
ruin, the Turks losing 10,000 men in one day alone at Anzac Cove. The
allied dead and wounded totalled 120,000 while some authorities put
Turkish casualties at between 300,000 and 400,000.

A MAN ran up telephone bills of more than #1250 in an attempt to
uncover alleged irregularities at a computer firm.
Ian Gomeche made nearly 300 phone calls in the space of six weeks
during his investigations, Aberdeen Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Gomeche, 43, of Dunlin Court, Portlethen, Aberdeen, was trying to
contact a local businessman involved in a computer firm.
The firm's premises were in a building shared by a development company
and a nightclub which Gomeche kept phoning.
The volume of calls began to affect other businesses and eventually
the police were called in.
Gomeche admitted three charges of breaching the peace by persistently
phoning the nightclub owner and two telephonists at the development
company.
His not-guilty pleas to nine other breach of the peace charges,
including one of threatening to ''fire bomb'' the city nightclub, were
accepted by the Crown.
''It was simply the fact that he was never off the phone,'' said
depute-fiscal Sandra MacRoberts.
''He decided to have a look at what was going on and was not happy
with the answers he was getting.
''In his zeal to pursue his investigations, he made too many phone
calls,'' explained his lawyer Mr Mark Harrower.
''He uncovered a lot of information and handed it on to Grampian
Police and trading standards officers,'' added Mr Harrower.
Gomeche, who worked for a computer firm in London until forced to
leave in 1985 because of ill-health, had managed to recover some money
for an individual as a result of his inquiries.
''His suspicions were well founded but his actions were over zealous.
There were no threats of violence to these people but because of the
issues he became wrapped up in it,'' said Mr Harrower.
Sheriff Alexander Pollock deferred sentence on Gomeche for six months
to be of good behaviour.

The nuclear power debate: Herald writers reveal the turmoil behind the
scenes as the industry comes under the hammer.
Alf Young reports on the ministerial scrabbling as proposals to
privatise nuclear power stations is brought to the front burner.
MORE than five weeks ago, I wrote a story on the front page of The
Herald warning that Scottish Nuclear was facing a hostile takeover bid
from its southern cousin, Nuclear Electric, as part of the Government's
review of the one part of the electricity industry still in public
ownership. That news triggered barely a ripple in the rest of the media
at the time.
I followed the story up with a column suggesting that, if it came to a
battle for independence, few Scots would rally to state-owned Scottish
Nuclear's defence, in part because of public suspicion about nuclear
power. Workers in the industry responded with a campaign bulletin
suggesting: ''Brother Young may be right . . . But we will fight the
Scots nuclear power battle'' and ending ''We'll see you on the
barricades, Alf.''
Maybe, in terms of predicting what heat the issue would generate, we
were both wrong. We did not know then that the Tories would be wiped out
at the Scottish council elections. In that context, any decision to
sanction the merger of the two nuclear utilities to facilitate a quick
pre-General Election sale takes on a whole new dimension.
The fate of Scottish Nuclear is now well to the fore in newsroom
agendas throughout the land. Speculation is mounting that the Cabinet is
poised to agree that threatened merger this Thursday to ensure the
speedy privatisation of an industry thought unsaleable just a few years
ago. A political row of major proportions is rapidly coming to the boil,
with a number of Scottish Tory MPs clearly disaffected over the issue.
So, what has happened in the interim? It is not easy to piece together
the sequence of events. Scottish Nuclear's chairman James Hann and chief
executive Dr Robin Jeffrey have been told not to speak publicly about
the issue. Hann did tell us yesterday that he has not yet been consulted
about the widely-rumoured frontrunner, a plan to combine Scottish
Nuclear and Nuclear Electric into a single corporate entity which would
then be floated on the Stock Market. Hann has not yet met Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang on the issue.
If the key participants are not yet talking, what is there to know at
this stage? When Nuclear Electric started making predatory advances on
its smaller Scottish rival and its two AGR stations at Hunterston and
Torness, Scottish Nuclear responded with what has become known as the
four:four option.
Under that idea, Scottish Nuclear would take over the running of the
two Heysham AGRs in Lancashire from Nuclear Electric, leaving NE with
three other AGRs and the recently operational Sizewell B pressurised
water reactor in Suffolk.
If the older Magnox stations stayed in the public sector, that would
create two modern nuclear generating companies of comparable size,
capable of competing effectively with each other in the private sector.
The electricity regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, seemed to
favour that approach.
Initially, Scottish Nuclear believed, the four:four option was well
received by the Treasury. In its propoganda Nuclear Electric began to
look defensive. But Scottish Nuclear had underestimated the tortuous
political dimension to the sale. And then that political dimension got
contaminated by fundamental regulatory issues, not of the Littlechild
variety, but those under the control of the Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate (NII) and Her Majesty's Industrial Pollution Inspectorate
(HMIPI).
Those ministers, notably Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who are pushing
hardest for privatisation, want a quick job. They want the sale
completed by the summer of 1996, leaving the latter half of next year
clear for a snap election, as the Government's term gets closer to its
1997 end. But before they could push ahead with the four:four option in
that tight time frame, the men from the NII and the HMIPI demanded their
say.
There are complex licence agreements both for the running of nuclear
power stations (NII) and for the discharge of waste (HMIPI). Both
bodies, The Herald understands, insisted that any transfer of nuclear
plant from one operator to another would require transfers of
undertakings under these licences. And that would take time, more time
than is available to do that and squeeze in a share sale to the public
by this time next year.
That intervention effectively killed off the four:four option and left
ministers scrabbling around for a quick fix. The fix which is emerging
is the single holding company option, under which Scottish Nuclear and
Nuclear Electric would be transformed into subsidiaries of a new holding
company (British Nuclear, say) shares in which would be offered in the
sale.
The two subsidiaries would retain their existing licences to operate
and discharge from the power stations they already run, thus keeping the
NII and HMIPI inspectors happy. They would also retain their existing
supply contracts with end users for the electricity they generate, in
Scottish Nuclear's case with ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric.
To assuage the mounting anger at what is seen as a southern takeover
in Scotland, ministers may also approve a plan to locate some of the new
holding company's headquarters functions in Scotland. A brass plate,
certainly. Perhaps some board meetings and a mandatory Scottish agm.
But, even before the Cabinet has approved the final details, the plan
is being viewed as in the grand, but duplicitous tradition of
Guinness-Distillers, BP-Britoil, and (perhaps the best parallel) the
sale of the Trustee Savings Bank. In each case firm promises were made
of Scottish HQ functions, promises which were later reneged on, when the
commercial logic dictated otherwise.
Two fundamental questions are being asked. If nuclear power is to be
privatised, why should the best commercial solution be compromised for
the sake of electoral advantage? And, if political considerations are
paramount, why not shape the holding company solution in such a way that
the headquarters operation of the combined businesses really is located
in Scotland, rather than the Cotswolds?
The demand this time is for more than a brass plate. The next few days
will tell whether the Government is listening.

Ian Lang faces tough questions from MPs today when they debate the
sale of Scottish Nuclear, reports Geoffrey Parkhouse.
THURSDAY'S Cabinet is expected to endorse a plan to sell-off as a
parcel Scottish and English nuclear generating power. Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang appears content that they should be marketed together. So he
will not find himself isolated at the meeting, like so many of his
predecessors, on a major industrial decision.
It may be different in Scotland, where a political furore is building,
with Tory MPs as concerned as others that Scottish Nuclear is to lose
its separate identity. Mr Lang may well find himself isolated in
Scotland -- but this will depend on what kind of a deal he has been
given to sell.
A distinct possibility was emerging last night that Mr Lang has argued
sucessfully in the Cabinet's economic sub-committee that a simple merger
of Scottish and Nuclear Electric is not on. Scottish Nuclear's track
record deserves better.
An attempt has been made to turn the ''Scottish identity'' argument on
its head with a proposition that the new combined operation of two
Scottish, and six English, plants will be anchored in Scotland with a
holding company, probably in Edinburgh. This scheme, it is said, will
provide not less, but more jobs in Scotland -- and high quality jobs at
that.
What is not yet clear -- and there may need to be more than one
Cabinet meeting on the issue -- is whether this outline plan will have
an in-built safeguard to prevent the new holding company from suffering
the same fate as the Britoil HQ in Glasgow. Mr Lang is said to have had
some support from Mr Michael heseltine, President of the Board of Trade.
If Lang can emerge with this kind of deal he may be able to win over at
least his own Scottish sceptics on the back benches.
Mr Lang has convinced himself that selling off Scottish Nuclear
separately is not commercially feasible. He and others have spent many
months putting out feelers for such a sale, and have received not a
single firm response. With that avenue apparently closed, Mr Lang has
tried to look after Scottish interests in a different way.
The whole issue of nuclear privatisation was put on a Government
backburner in 1989, Prime Minister Thatcher having failed to incorporate
nuclear and conventional generation for sale. Very recently, Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke, looking for a nuclear sale worth about #3 billion to the
Treasury, convinced Mr Major that if they were going to do it there
would be only a ''window'' of 12 months opportunity before the next
General Election.
Cabinet E Committee set to work again in earnest a few weeks ago,
charged with the task of delivering a workable plan. In these
circumstances, Mr Lang had little opportunity to deploy an alternative
case, even if he had been able to do so. He had already backed-off
committing himself to a separate Scottish Nuclear privatisation which he
did not feel could work.
The speed-up caused surprise all round, not least among Whitehall
civil servants. It also alerted the political oppositon; Mr Lang is
likely to get his first sharp taste of it at Scottish Questions in the
Commons tomorrow .
With the demise of Tory fortunes in Scotland, it is essential for him
to be able to argue that the privatisation will be of positive benefit
in terms of jobs and prices to consumers. He faces an uphill task, with
Labour promising him 12 months of campaigning hell against nuclear
privatisation, Scottish or English.

TOMORROW
Day 3: Kirsty Scott examines the changing role of men in Scottish
society
It's tough at the top: in the second part of the series Kirsty Scott
gauges the determination of Scottish women to realise their potential in
life as in business
I AM in my early forties. Single but seeing a younger man. He's
pushing for a commitment but I'm not so sure. Career's going well and
I'm thinking of having my first baby. Maybe with him. Maybe not. Hell,
the choice is mine.
I'm the female icon for the nineties, sketched by a flood of new
reports and statistics and fleshed out by commentators and analysts. I'm
confident, career-building and positively swamped by opportunities. Men?
Eat my dust. I'm way ahead.
It's an intriguing and optimistic profile, but a real one? Glasgow
University sociologist Barbara Littlewood isn't convinced. ''Oh Good
lord, no, absolutely not. Look at relative pay levels, look at women who
are in management, look at directors of companies. Everywhere you look
at there are still discrepancies.
All the time we are being told about this wave of well-qualified
bright young women who are breaking through the glass ceiling, but they
have been saying this for 20 years and it never happens. The glass
ceiling, it seems to me, must be made of tempered steel.''
No-one doubts, least of all Littlewood, that there have been dramatic
changes in women's lives recently. In the past two months alone a series
of major surveys have uncovered a clear shift in the way we work, the
way we choose our partners, the way we choose to have, or not to have,
families.
The first was the study from the Office of Population Censuses and
Surveys at the end of March which found that births to women over 40 had
risen by half in the past 10 years. The birth rate for women in their
thirties had also risen but the rate for women in their twenties had
dropped.
The study also found that increasing numbers of unmarried women in
their forties were choosing yougner partners to father their children.
The fathers of babies born to four out of 10 single women aged 40-44
were still in their thirties.
Less than two weeks later the Family Policy Studies Centre released
research which suggested that one in five women in the UK will not have
children, a childlessness rate that has doubled in a generation. The
FPSC admitted it didn't know why the birthrate was changing and would
carry out further studies to see if it was a lifestyle choice or
something dictated by social and economic pressures. Other research
shows girls outperforming boys at school and an increasing number of
women entering the workplace.
The studies emerged to a steady flow of discussion about where three
decades of feminism have left women and men. The general opinion seemed
to be that feminism was now pretty much an unstoppable force, but
Littlewood and equal opportunity campaigners in Scotland are concerned
that the latest trends have been allowed to overshadow some equally
relevant, but less ''sexy'' research.
Earlier in the spring a study released by the Equal Opportunities
Commission showed continuing employment discrimination and barriers
between men's and women's jobs despite 20 years of equality legislation.
The study found a striking segregation of the sexes in workplaces with
men and women being given clearly defined roles.
A separate study found that women were still earning only about 75% of
their male colleagues' pay packets. In Scotland the figure is 71%. A
sample of almost 500 men and women managers across a variety of
industries produced an average salary of #18,000 for men and #13,500 for
women.
Muriel Robison is the legal development officer for the EOC in
Scotland and has at her fingertips a mass of statistics rejecting the
notion that women in general and Scottish women in particular are
becoming the dominant force socially and professionally.
''There's no doubt that there have been changes, there have been
enormous changes since the Sexual Discrimination Act came into force . .
. but we have not nearly come far enough. There are more low-paid women
in Scotland, and when it comes to looking at the professions, at
management, there are definitely an awful lot less women in higher
positions in Scotland.
''The most telling one is in education -- only 3% of head teachers in
Scotland are women compared to 20% in England and Wales . . . there are
big problems in all of the professions. Women are way far behind.''
Robison's figures reveal that there are two female local authority
chief executives in Scotland; three women directors on the boards of the
top twenty companies; 14 women among the country's 389 secondary school
headteachers; and seven full-time female sheriffs out of 101.
A report by the equal opportunity group Engender, released last year,
found that 48% of women employed full-time in Scotland are low-paid
compared to 20% of men and more than 250,000 women in Scotland are
estimated to be unable to work because of household or childcare
responsiblities; almost 40% of top businesswomen in 1993 identified
sexism as a barrier for women wishing to pursue a career in management;
Scottish schoolgirls are outperforming boys but at higher education
levels women make up one-third of post-graduates, one quarter of
lecturers and 4% of professors.
Just yesterday, the Institute of Management issued new figures showing
that the number of female managers among Britain's largest organisations
stands at 10.7%, up from 9.5% the year before. The number of women in
the boardroom stands at 3%, and the average female manager earns
#28,642, almost #5000 less than the average male manager.
Last week Scotland appointed its first professor of gender relations,
a post, according to officials at Dundee University, which will examine
why women outperform men in many areas of education but are seriously
under-represented in decision-making.
Barbara Littlewood believes the current debate about feminism and how
far it has come has overlooked such statistics and is part of a wider
reaction to small gains made by women in recent years.
''I think this is part of the backlash phenomenon that Susan Faludi
has talked about. Her argument is that as soon as women inch forward
then there's a huge moral panic about women having far more advantages
than men do. Any kind of advancement is seen as a huge threat to men's
positions. This is not new, it's happened for hundreds of years. As soon
as some type of slight gain is made by women, it's seen as the end of
civilisation as we know it.
''There are changes certainly over the last generation or two in
women's lives, you can cite growing rates of divorces, women going into
employment and staying in employment and you can cite rising rates of
illegitimacy -- I think that has to do with women making economic
choices about whether it is in their interests to get married.
''These are three very important changes in women's lives but they
have often been construed as threats to civilisation. There has to be a
shake-up in relations between men and women. Women are no longer so
identified about a purely domestic role. They don't see their lives
coming to an end once they get married and become someone's mother. They
expect to have more out of their lives.''
The picture is changing just as much for younger women as it is for
their older counterparts. Bunty has given way to Tank Girl, the solitary
punk heroine of the future. Cosmetics companies are shelving the old
soft-focus look for the militaristic overtones of Boots 17's latest
advertising campaign: ''It's not make-up -- it's ammunition.''
Studies are also uncovering a new breed of super-confident teenage
girls, apparently unfettered by the ties of tradition. A recent report
on 15-24-year-olds found young women were facing the future with more
confidence and less conformity than their male peers.
They were inspired by better job opportunities, more likely to want to
travel the world before launching their careers, and four out of 10 said
they rejected their parents' lifestyles. Less than 30% of their male
peers took a similar stance. The young men who were questioned were more
alarmed at the thought of life without a steady relationship.
* SARAH McGREGOR is 17 and takes surveys which purport to tell her
what she thinks with a pinch of salt. She's in her sixth year at
Stirling High School and is planning to study medicine at Edinburgh
University. It could just as well be geography, nuclear physics, or a
job straight from school because she's never felt anything has been
closed to her.
She agrees with feminism as a concept, but clearly feels it's a little
outdated and possibly a convenient peg on which to hang some tired old
arguments.
''I think it's sort of achieved what it set out to achieve,'' she
says. ''Most of the time things are fine. There are obviously times when
women are discriminated against, but it's not all the while. It's OK at
the moment. You just have to be careful it doesn't go the other way.''
She thinks the youth lifestyles study missed the point about steady
relationships -- that's something both sexes would want. ''I think the
girls are the same as the boys, y'know, they say things like what
happens if I don't get married, but it's not a big deal.''
She herself, is firmly career-orientated at the moment but does
sometimes think that it might be tricky to interrupt her medical
training or the early stages of her working life to get married and have
a baby.
Does she want to have it all? ''That would be quite nice,'' she says
with a laugh. ''I'm not saying I will definitely have all of it, but I
think that's probably what everybody would want, men as well as women.''
* SUSAN CASTLE is 32 and the director of her own printing firm, Splash
of Colour, in Edinburgh. She was brought up in a traditional family
structure -- father worked, mother stayed at home. She went to
university and did post-graduate studies before starting her career in
advertising and marketing. She set up Splash two years ago with her
husband and has always felt women wielded more power than they were
given credit for.
''I think women have always had an awful lot more control than they
ever allowed men to think. Women have been bringing up the families and
educating the children, that's a huge amount of control. If you start
taking women away from that, that's a huge amount of control you are
losing.
''I think a lot of younger women are being encouraged to realise that
they're not going to spend their entire lives dependent on men and that
does give people a certain amount of freedom. I think women are just
naturally high achievers, they tend to be more perfectionist. They are
more competitive than men and these days -- they are carrying that on
because the options are open.
''Sometimes its quite encouraging to read that women in general are
being more successful but I don't think it's terribly relevant, you've
just got to go out and do your best.''
She believes that discrimination still exists in some quarters but
people should not get too exercised about it.
''I would sound blind if I said there was no prejudice in the
workplace. There is the occasional bit of patronising behaviour but you
just have to laugh at it. These people aren't credible. I think that we
have equal opportunities but there are still some dinosaurs out there
who think women should do certain jobs or assignments, and they're not
all male.
''The one thing we have to remember, however, it that there's a
difference between equality and 'being the same' and I think we are
equal but we will never be the same -- we shouldn't be trying to be.''
* BARBARA LITTLEWOOD, meanwhile, sees a real shift in relations
between men and women but believes from the woman's point of view, the
struggling and the juggling are continuing, maybe just as much now as
they ever have.
''When I was in the sixth form and about to leave school the
headmistress called all the girls in for a little chat,'' she says. ''It
was the 1960s. She said women can only have two out of the three things
that they really want and the three things she assumed we really wanted
were a husband, a child and a career. You can only have two of these but
you can't have all three, she said. I suppose it was quite
forward-thinking of her at that time and it's maybe still true. I didn't
want to believe her. We really thought we could have it all.''

A BUS driver was crushed under the wheels of a bus because his
employers did not have the proper safety procedures in place, it was
alleged yesterday.
Mr Thomas Butcher, 52, of Stewarton, died in July last year after a
minibus reversed over his head at Kilmarnock's Green Street bus station.
At Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Mr Butcher's employers, Western Scottish
Buses, of Nursery Avenue, Kilmarnock, -- who owned the minibus -- denied
blame.
They are accused of failing to ensure the safety of their employees,
in particular Mr Butcher, by failing to provide a safe system of work in
the reversing of public conveyancing vehicles.
They are also charged with failing to take a suitable and safe
assessment of the role of health and safety for their employees, in
particular when exposed to the risk of being struck by a reversing
vehicle.
Both offences are alleged to have taken place between June 30 and
November 20 last year.
Mr Adam Francie, 41, said that, on July 1 last year, he saw colleague
William Brown chasing a minibus and screaming at the driver to stop.
The bus was reversing, he said, at around 5mph.
Seconds earlier, he had noticed Mr Butcher standing behind the bus,
looking across the concourse.
Mr Francie said: ''The briefcase Mr Butcher had been holding was lying
on the ground at the front of the bus, Mr Butcher was underneath the
vehicle with his head under the axle of the rear wheel.''
When asked by defence advocate Hugh Gibb why he believed Mr Butcher
was standing behind the minibus, Mr Francie said he assumed he was
looking across the concourse to find his own bus.
Mr Francie said it was standard practice for drivers to stand on the
concourse because parked buses made it difficult to spot bus numbers in
the parking bay.
He said there were no instructions at the time about not standing on
the concourse.
The court heard that, following the Western Scottish takeover by
Stagecoach last summer, a stance controller had been appointed to advise
drivers when to reverse.
Prior to this, drivers helped colleagues if they had time.
Mr Francie said that before this accident he was not aware of any
particular company policy regarding reversing.
Mr Gibb said all drivers had been given reversing procedures when they
sat their initial PSV test.
The trial continues.

AS the new chairman of Grampian Enterprise, Mr Maitland Mackie plans
to use his personal experience to encourage businesses in the rather
reserved North-east to undergo the sometimes traumatic changes required
to improve their competitiveness.
The former vice-president of the National Farmers' Union follows Sir
Ian Wood into the guiding seat of the enterprise company in one of
Britain's most affluent areas. He sees one of his main tasks as
converting business from the ''dae fit yer telt'' type of management,
which has served them well for so long, to new techniques.
He admits to learning much from his boardroom involvement with
Grampian Enterprise in its first three years and he has translated these
lessons into the management of his own company.
''We are well down the road of shifting from an opportunistic
day-to-day system of management to taking a much longer-term view of the
business over how we are going to develop it, rationalise bits of it,
focus on the important parts, and establish a good five-year plan.
''It is very important to disseminate the knowledge of what we are
trying to do right through the work-force and introduce useful
participative management as distinct from 'dae fit yer telt!'
''A substantial number of traditional sector businesses are becoming
switched on to these concepts and Grampian Enterprise, along with the
local enterprise trusts, has a very important role in catalysing
activity down this development road.''
Mr Mackie will be able to tell those prepared to listen that, for a
company to grow, progress can be painful and traumatic decisions have to
be made.
One of his hardest decisions was selling the Mackies' milk business
which made them a household name. The business had doubled in three
years and required massive reinvestment.
Analysis showed they could not remain in business at the scale in
which they were involved and that it was better to sell, as they did to
the expanding Wiseman Dairies, and concentrate on their rapidly growing
specialist ice-cream business.
They are now also developing a specialist confectionery market,
producing truffles and quality sweets, which has a #1m turnover target
within five years.
''That is focusing us down a specialist route where we dictate the
price and we don't have to take someone else's commodity price. Liquid
milk has become a pure commodity market,'' he said.
The same careful analysis was applied to the land his family have
farmed for generations. After examining likely trends, they have
rationalised and consolidated by concentrating their interests in their
two main farms, which they have enlarged.
''It has been very difficult. We have been a traditional family around
this country for 200 years, developing farming, and most of the land has
been in the family for quite a long time.''

SCOTTISH Nuclear's chief executive Dr Robin Jeffrey has been steadfast
in his defence of the company and its staff. To claims by Nuclear
Electric that a merger of the two companies would make a stronger entity
which could compete both in the UK electricity market and for
international nuclear-powered stations construction contracts, Dr
Jeffrey reacted: ''The creation of a single UK nuclear company is a
proposal which has little or nothing going for it. It would mean less
competition in the electricity generating industry and the destruction
of yet another leading Scottish company on the altar of 'big must be
best'.''
Scottish Nuclear is more inclined to the view that ''small is
beautiful'' and points to considerable improvements in output and
efficiency. Better yet, however, would be a scenario offering it
equality with Nuclear Electric, in which two of Nuclear Electric's
advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) plants were transferred to the
Scottish company, creating a four-four option compared to the current
six-two situation and the eight-nothing preference of Nuclear Electric,
stacking the odds all in its favour.
Even the siting of the new company's headquarters in Scotland would be
recognised as no more than a sop. The expertise of a Scottish workforce,
which has succeeded in improving its efficiency considerably, would be
lost.
The current battle between Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric is
not the first time the two companies have clashed.
Before Scottish Nuclear was hived off the South of Scotland
Electricity Board, the SSEB gave evidence to the Sizewell inquiry in
favour of the AGR plant, rather than the pressurised water reactor
(PWR), based on an American design, that the Central Electricity
Generating Board wanted to build. The CEGB won the argument -- but, in
its reincarnation as Nuclear Electric, may not have forgiven the uppity
Scots for questioning its plans.
Scottish Nuclear, which operates only AGR plants, has been proud of
its safety and environmental record.
Most recently, however, it has been trumpeting its financial
successes.
''In our first four years of operation as an independent company, a
loss of #33m has been turned into a profit of #72m; output has increased
by 16%; productivity per employee by 11%; and the cost of generating
each unit of electricity has been reduced by 12% to 2.83 pence per
kilowatt hour,'' said a Scottish Nuclear spokesperson.
Most recently, Scottish Nuclear has announced that all its members of
staff will receive a payout of #2000 per person this year based on
efficiency gains.
Dr Jeffrey said: ''The news of the full final Gainshare payment comes
as a real tonic for Scottish Nuclear at a time when we are restating our
commitment to remaining an independent Scottish company.''
A company spokesperson said, hopefully: ''With the outcome of the
Government Review imminent the successful results of the Gainshare
scheme's initial year will not go unnoticed in the Scottish Office,
Department of Trade and Industry, and other Government departments.
Meanwhile, sources within the Scottish company, point to remarks by
the chief executive of Nuclear Electric, Dr Robert Hawley, who claimed
recently that the salaries of some of his directors were far too low.
Dr Hawley said that because the industry was still state-owned, his
executives were underpaid on a salary of #90,000. Earning #162,000 a
year, he was ''okay'' because he came from private industry -- by
coincidence, Rolls-Royce, a company which does not enjoy huge popularity
in East Kilbride at present.
Scottish Nuclear's current strategy involves a saving of #25m a year
by extending Hunterston B's useful life from 2005 to 2010. The creation
of a dry fuel store at Torness would save a further #45m because it
would not have to pay for reprocessing spent fuel south of the Border.
Scottish Nuclear has believed for the past few years that it is a
better prospect for privatisation than its less efficient counterpart
Nuclear Electric.
Chairman James Hann said the company would be ''better off and able to
perform better if not under control of the Government and Treasury''. It
is therefore ironic that it faces the prospect of being swallowed up,
Goliath-style, by its neighbour.
Scottish Nuclear points to the fact that Nuclear Electric is
subsidised through the 11% levy of electricity bills whereas it receives
no subsidy and is, in fact, profitable.
It also believes that if Nuclear Electric were to be allowed to absorb
Scottish Nuclear on the pretext of creating one globally competitive
civil nuclear power contractor in the UK, in truth it would be after the
Scottish AGRs at Hunterston and Torness, some of the best-performing
nuclear plants in the world.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday won the backing of the shopworkers'
union Usdaw for his revamped party constitution, which is looking
increasingly likely to win the day handsomely at Saturday's special
party conference.
After being addressed by Mr Blair, who again set out his ''fairness
not favours'' approach to the unions, delegates to Usdaw's annual
conference in Blackpool overwhelmingly agreed to endorse the proposed
rewriting of Clause 4, including Labour's historic stance on
nationalisation.
By an equally emphatic margin, the 650 delegates voted down a motion
seeking the retention of Clause 4 and its commitment to ''the common
ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange''.
Mr Blair said last night of the vote: ''I am delighted with the
result. It shows a union in touch with its members.''
Although the Transport and General Workers' Union and Unison are
expected to deploy their joint 25% of the total conference votes against
change and for the retention of Clause 4, Mr Blair's aides are confident
that the votes of the AEEU (8.7%), the Communications Workers Union
(4.5%) and now Usdaw (4.8%) and a batch of smaller moderate unions plus
the bulk of the 30% of the votes controlled by the constituencies will
go his way.
Today the national executive of the General Municipal and Boilermakers
will decide on how the GMB's 12% vote will be cast next weekend.
If it follows the recommendation of general secretary John Edmonds, it
too will back the modernised Clause 4, which sets out the aim of a
''thriving private sector and high-quality public services where those
undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public
or accountable to them.''
The Manufacturing Science and Finance union will decide how to use its
3.7% of the votes immediately before the special conference and as TGWU
general secretary Bill Morris repeated yesterday his union delegation
will make the final decision on the use of its 14% vote on Saturday
morning.
The executive of the TGWU the largest party affiliate, has recommended
against the change but chairman Dan Duffy, of Glasgow, who represents
the union on the Labour Party executive, has been arguing for change and
it is not unknown for the delegates to have a last-minute change of
heart.
Mr Blair, who received a standing ovation from Usdaw delegates, made
no mention in his address of those unions who were opposing change.
He emphasised that unions were regarded by Labour as a healthy part of
a strong and well functioning democracy and that fairness meant they
should not be shut out or disparaged and they would be listened to and
consulted on issues that effect their members.
Howeer, fairness never meant confusing unions with the government of
the country, he said adding that the public knew that and so did trades
unionists who as much as anyone expected a Labour Government to govern
in the public interest, for the whole nation, without fear or favour to
anyone.
He won loud applause from delegates when he pledged that a Labour
Government would renationalise the health service and said the fight
against rail privatisation would continue. He also repeated his pledge
to introduce a national minimum wage.
However, he reminded delegates that pre-strike ballots and
restrictions on mass picketing would remain but would be matched by
rights -- ''the right to be in a trade union, be active in it and, where
there is proven substantial support at the workplace, to have it
recognised''.
Mr Blair argued in favour of change and angrily attacked the
Conserative Government as the ''most discredited administration this
century''. He said he was ''haunted'' by the prospect of the Tories
winning the next election and said they should be ''torn apart'' instead
for the damage they had caused the country, which was crying out for a
Labour Government.

Allan Laing explains why, despite Robbie Coltrane's criticism, we need
television game shows.
ROBBIE Coltrane was 100% right. Up to a point. With Cracker winning a
viewers' prize at the Bafta Awards for being the most popular TV
programme of the year, he declared: ''It's a good stick in the eye for
cynics who think the only way to get ratings is to put on crappy game
shows.''
The problem is that crappy game shows (which, it has to be said, most
of them are) remain something of a necessary evil for television the
world over.
It could be worse. We could be in America where, it seems, every
second programme falls into the category of mind-numbing,
intelligence-insulting, Crappy Game Show.
The sad truth is that, in order to appreciate the good and the great
on television it is sometimes necessary to have something truly awful
with which to compare it. Cracker is clearly a fine and successful (the
two do not always follow each other) programme at the cutting edge of
drama; Play Your Cards Right is telly's lowest common denominator.
Visual wallpaper.
Indeed, the nadir of the popular game show will probably be reached
this weekend when LWT's You Bet! features a team of partially-sighted
teenagers who try to score 10 goals past a blindfolded professional
keeper. Meanwhile, four ''celebrities'' will place bets on the outcome,
their winnings going to charity.
Now compare that puerile, tasteless, drivel with, well, Cracker for
one. Or Prime Suspect (which starts again on Sunday). Or Band of Gold
(which ended recently after critical acclaim and huge audience figures).
Or our very own Taggart (which in its day has attracted a massive 18
million viewers).
There is, of course, no comparison. For a start, you are not comparing
like with like, are you? But, then again, they're both network
television programmes designed to appeal to a mass market. One falls
into the drama department; the other into light entertainment. Sadly, we
need them both. And, before we jump upon our intellectual high horse, it
should be pointed out that millions of people enjoy game shows, even
crappy ones.
In any case, popular television could not survive on a diet of pure
drama. The fact is that we, the viewers, wouldn't like it. You might
think that TV Heaven would be a constant run of top-notch serials,
one-off thrillers, medical dramas, etc, with the occasional break for
the soaps and the news. But we would soon tire of its intensity; become
blase about its excellence. You really can get too much of a good thing.
This is perhaps just as well, for the unescapable truth is that drama
is the most expensive form of television. A one-off period drama, for
instance, can cost well over #1m. Taggart costs around #600,000 a show.
In order to ensure that a TV station (and this applies to both the
commercial network and the BBC) keeps within its budget, a balance must
be struck. Enter, as if on cue, game shows. It's just a shame that so
many of them have to be so crappy.
They are cheap and cheerful. The most expensive element of a game show
is the prizes. An entire series of, for example, Scottish Television's
Wheel of Fortune is made in the space of a couple of weeks. The audience
is wheeled on and off, the compere does his bit, goes off to change his
shirt, and it's on to the next edition. Even the Christmas Special is
made on the same conveyor belt.
There is an argument, however, to suggest that game shows are a false
economy. If you examine the audience ratings figures, soaps -- the
EastEnders and the Coronation Streets -- come top. Next, usually, come
the drama serials like Casualty, Peak Practice, and Heartbeat. Then come
the audience participation shows like Noel's House Party and Blind Date.
And finally, if they're lucky, come the Crappy Game Shows.
Then again, not always. To return to Wheel of Fortune, the network
strategically placed it on a Monday evening to compete directly with
EastEnders. In the event, it gave the BBC1 soap a run for its money with
audience figures which often beat the saga of Albert Square. It was a
neat scheduling trick because, by and large, both programmes were
pitched at the same audience.
But perhaps Coltrane's remarks were intended to be a little deeper
than a straight drama vs game show contest. One man who agrees
wholeheartedly with him is Paul Marcus, one of Britain's top programme
makers who has just produced (and directed) the latest Prime Suspect. At
the new series's launch in London last week he made an impassioned plea
to network bosses to avoid falling into the trap of making ''drama
simply as product''. This, he reckons, was what Coltrane was alluding
to.
''It's easy for people whose major concern is ratings and scheduling
to look for the lowest common denominator. It is perfectly proper for
ITV bosses to renew a successful series for, say, a further year when it
is hitting the 10 or 11 million audience mark. But recent experience has
proved that, if you take a really objective judgment, you see that
perhaps something is falling off its previous standards, and you don't
reschedule it. Instead, you take a chance on a new programme.
''I have a very healthy respect for the viewing public. A great
percentage of the audience is prepared to rise to the challenge of
something that is new. They will always be prepared to give it a try.
Band of Gold (which achieved regular ratings of 14 million viewers) was
a good example. Sometimes you have to take a gamble. There are people
out there in the system who are capable of making the right editorial
judgments and commissions,'' he said.
Marcus conceded that the realities of the ITV franchise system made it
necessary to produce a broad range of different kinds of programmes. But
he added: ''There is no excuse for a company, which is a franchise
holder in a profitable year, not to at least explore the possibility of
making interesting and new drama.''

SCOTTISH cattle were resoundingly disparaged in the Commons yesterday.
Alas, no Scottish MP was in his place to defend them.
This was not dereliction of duty. This was Welsh Question Time. As
with Scottish Questions, English Labour MPs mostly absent themselves,
not wanting to get in the way of their colleagues who are so
preponderant a force in the Northern Kingdom and the Principality that
all cannot get their questions in during the time allotted.
By contrast, which on current trends looks like becoming even starker
in the next Parliament, Tories are thin on the ground and a few English
colleagues elect to help out the embattled ministerial teams with
supportive questions productive of wonderful statistics which might make
the unwary visitor to the Public Gallery wonder why the lands of Bruce
and Glendower are not politically bright blue.
Occassionally, however, a question strays off the well- beaten
statistical path. This one came from Mr Michael Fabricant (Mid
Staffordshire -- Con.), chiefly famous for his light orange-coloured
hair.
The Welsh Black, he enthused, was ''more lean, more tender, more
succulent, more tasty than any Scottish breed whatsoever.'' He followed
up this astonishing assertion by demanding to know why the Welsh Office
was not promoting this excellent breed and why it was not being served
up in House of Commons restaurants.
Mr Gwilwym Jones, a Welsh junior Minister, wisely ignored the threat
to the Union implicit in the question and replied that Welsh Beef
Promotion was actually working on these beasts' image now, which is bad
news for some of them currently munching the green grass of Dyfed and
Clwyd and thinking life is wonderful.
The banner of Glendower having fallen into the hands of Mr Dafydd
Wigley (Caernarfon -- Plaid Cymru), he acted in the manner of his great
predecessor and mounted a foray against Shropshire. The denisons of,
say, Ludlow have often had to race behind the castle walls for fear of
being carried off into some mountain fastness.
In 1995, it is Shropshire factories the Nationalists are after,
complaining that the consummately dry Secretary of State, Mr John
Redwood, has been siding with the English Industry Department which
believes that the factories are better stopping where they are.
''Your job is to stand up and attract as many firms as you can, not
side with authorities on the other side of Offa's Dyke,'' roared Mr
Wigley.
The grants on offer were paid out in British money, soothed Mr Redwood
and it did not represent good value for the taxpayer to use them to move
a firm which was perfectly happy where it was to the other side of the
border. Mr Wigley glowered but, factories being more difficult to carry
off than cattle or human beings, Shropshire industry seems safe for the
time being.
Mr Roger Knapman (Shroud -- Con.) went into the lead in the Most
Outrageous Question of the Session competition. Intervening in a
civilised discussion of nursery school provision in Wales, he asked if
nursery education could be provided for Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the CBI, whose promotion to Deputy Governor of the
Bank of England was ''the most bizarre appointment since the Emperor
Caligula made his horse a Senator.''
The Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, cut him off at the knees in no
uncertain terms. ''Now, let's have a sensible question from Mr
Robathan'' she said briskly. The Tory MP for Blaby who regularly pursues
his prey with an intensity any Great White Hunter might envy, demanded
to know what effect the feral mink was having on the indigenous wildlife
of Wales. The minks impact, he was told, was ''difficult to assess'' --
there appeared to be no cases of them attacking Welsh Blacks.

THE Stornoway-based coastguard helicopter flew its 1000th mission
yesterday, to rescue a lobster fisherman.
He was alone on his vessel, Tiree Maid, placing lobster pots when he
fell overboard.
Despite an injured leg, he scrambled ashore on the rocky islet, Eilean
Bheg.
His empty boat was discovered by his uncle, who raised the alarm.
Oban coastguard immediately scrambled the helicopter, Portree
lifeboat, two coastguard response teams, and alerted three fishing
vessels.
The injured fisherman, who was suffering from hypothermia, was found
by the helicopter crew and flown to Broadford Hospital in Skye.
The helicopter has been in service since May 1987.

Conservative Jacques Chirac may be the favourite, but as Nicholas
Powell reports from Paris, the voters' message is that there's still
everything to play for in the race to become France's next president.
FRANCE woke up yesterday with a formidable election hangover, still
trying to come to terms with the first-round poll in the presidential
election. Voting contradicted every opinion poll and revealed a worrying
fragility in the political make-up of the country: a record 20% of votes
went to the extreme right, the traditional right-wing was seriously
weakened, the Socialist Party experienced an unexpected resurrection and
the far left prospered.
The only certainty of Sunday's poll is that the Gaullist candidate
Jacques Chirac goes forward to the second-round vote on May 7 with the
socialist candidate Lionel Jospin. And with Sunday's vote roughly
divided 60% to the right and 40% to the left, it seems likely Mr Chirac
will finally qualify for a seven-year stint as president of the French
Republic, if others come to his support.
Public support for Chirac and his fellow Gaullist, Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur was anything but enthusiastic, partly on account of the
absurdity of the career contest which pitched them one against the
other. Chirac's 20.47% score, some seven points lower than opinion polls
had predicted, is barely better than his performance in two previous
bids for the presidency in 1981 and 1988. His lead over Balladur, who
scored 18.54%, is so tiny as to be unconvincing. If Chirac does prove
third time lucky on May 7, his poor first-round performance will have
left him dependent on the goodwill of his former rival. And, worse, on
that of National Front voters.
Almost as soon as the results were published on Sunday night, Chirac
and Balladur, after weeks spent sniping at each other, were pledging
each other support and esteem. Yet after all the tub-thumping promises
of his long campaign, Chirac will have to spend the next fortnight
changing his tune. In particular, his populist claims that the notions
of right wing and left wing are obsolete will appear foolish in the
light of Sunday's results which underlined political divisions and
growing support for political extremes.
Against that background of right-wing division, National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen supplied the biggest single shock by scoring over 15%,
the highest score ever achieved by his party in its 25-year history, and
one which put its leader only a few points behind Chirac and Balladur.
Nevertheless on Sunday evening, Le Pen was an angry and frustrated man.
For had the independent far-right candidate Philippe de Villiers not
copied his programme and ended up with 4.8% of the far-right votes, Le
Pen could have got through to the second round, and France might have
experienced the nightmare scenario of an extreme right-wing president.
As things stand, Le Pen's role over the next fortnight will be
crucial. During a huge National Front rally in Paris on May 1 (the feast
day of St Joan of Arc and also, provocatively, Labour Day) Le Pen will
call on his followers to vote for either Jospin or Chirac, or abstain.
The choice between the two candidates is less obvious than it appears.
Chirac, who has always refused even to meet Le Pen, is more hated by the
National Front than virtually any other conservative politician -- Le
Pen did not urge his supporters to vote for him in his second-round
presidential battle with Francois Mitterrand in 1988. Politically, Le
Pen could make greater progress in opposition to a socialist president
than living alongside a traditional conservative one. Yesterday, after
years spent insulting socialists, Le Pen perversely chose to compliment
Jospin, describing him as ''respectable''.
Chirac's position is unenviable. He is now in need of National Front
votes, yet he is on record as saying he will have no truck with the
organisation. His campaign spokesman, Foreign Affairs Minister Alain
Juppe, tried to edge towards the far-right voters yesterday by saying
the National Front had ''legitimate preoccupations which must be taken
into consideration . . . everything concerning security in our towns,
cities and suburbs and preservation of a certain form of national
identity''. Le Pen merely said that those who expected ''a large
transfer of National Front votes'' to Chirac were suffering from
''illusions''.
The other great surprise on Sunday night was the surge in support for
socialist candidate Jospin, who gained 23.21%, even although he had only
been chosen to represent his party in February. At the time, the
socialists were weakened by internal divisions, demoralised by the
decision of former European Commission president Jacques Delors not to
stand, and still groggy from the hammering in the 1994 European
election.
One of the few leading socialists not to have been involved in
corruption scandals which dogged the last socialist government, Jospin
has succeeded in giving the impression that his programme of reform
marks a clean break with President Mitterrand's old and discredited
regime. And throughout the campaign Balladur and Chirac were too busy
attacking each other to find time for Jospin.
Further left against a background of continuing high unemployment,
growing problems of poverty and homelessness, and tension in workplaces,
the Communist Party and the Trotskyist organisation Lutte Ouvriere both
recorded a surge in support. Robert Hue, the Communist candidate,
reversed 20 years of severe decline for his party by scoring 8.73% of
votes. The central committee of the CP meets tomorrow and will probably
call on Communist voters to support Jospin.
After an energetic and virulently anti-capitalist campaign, the
Trotskyist Arlette Laguiller drew 5.37% of votes, well over double her
score of 1988. On Sunday night she announced the creation of a left-wing
political party and repeated she would not be voting for Jospin, whom
she accuses of being as basically pro-management as the right-wing
candidates. Ouvriere has also renewed calls for the ''third round'' to
the election, a wave of strikes and industrial action it hopes to
trigger after May 7.

THE ambulance service announced yesterday that it is to phase out its
single-person crews and contract drivers.
Mr Andrew Freemantle, chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance
Service NHS Trust, said that by next April every accident and emergency
response will be made by an ambulance with two fully-trained officers on
board.
More than 250 people will be taken on, at a cost of #3m, to improve
the service.
At present, around 4000 calls are answered by single-person crews,
particularly in rural areas of the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway, and
Tayside.
In some of these areas, people have had to be contracted to drive the
ambulances.
Mr Freemantle said the fact Scotland was the last place in Britain to
do away with single crews was a source of embarrassment.
He added that he hoped the extra staff would help cut down response
times to calls, particularly in sparsely populated areas.
Mr Freemantle said it was impossible to say whether having one-person
crews had cost lives.
However, he said, common sense dictated that having two people in the
ambulance was better than just one.
Mr Freemantle said: ''The vexed issue of single crews has caused us a
great deal of trouble for a very long time. Consider a road accident in
the Highlands where maybe there are three casualties and where an
ambulance crewed by one person turns up.
''Not only is it difficult for a single person to administer, it is
almost impossible to get a casualty into the back of the ambulance.''
There are more than 1000 vehicles and 2800 staff employed by SAS in
more than 150 locations in Scotland.

EMPLOYEES, through their trades unions, should be represented on
company remuneration committees, says the TUC in evidence to the
Greenbury Committee investigating executive pay.
The TUC also draws attention to new research which reveals how company
pay differentials have grown considerably over the last 10 years, during
which the average ratio between the highest-paid director's salary and
that of the average employee has grown from 7.8 in 1984 to 12.57 in
1994.
Over that period the salary and bonus of highest-paid directors rose
from an average of #98,261 to #211,629 -- an increase of 115% in real
terms -- while the average employee pay increased from #12,601 to
#16,831, just 34%.
Thus, argues the TUC, even without taking into account share options
which are often on offer to directors, top pay has outstripped pay
increases for ordinary workers by a factor of more than three and in
some cases there had even been simultaneous wage cuts.
The evidence, Pay and Perks -- Narrowing the Gap, stresses that the
differentials now seen in many companies cannot be justified and that
most companies do not value sufficiently or reward the work of those at
the bottom of the company in relation to those at the top.
This is seen as particularly relevant where high pay for directors was
justified on the basis of company performance, because performance
depended on all employees and this should be recognised by remuneration
committees.
Other TUC recommendations include:
* Institutional shareholders to be represented on remuneration
committees;
* Incentive schemes to be based on long-term results;
* The abolition of annual bonus schemes;
* A #50,000 limit on the value of share options;
* The ending of three- and two-year rolling contracts;
* Greater transparency in the rates and the setting of executive pay.

A FORMER RAF corporal, who claimed she lost more than #200,000 as a
result of her discharge because of her pregnancy, has been awarded #4236
compensation.
Mrs Grace Smitheman, 37, told an industrial tribunal in Dundee that
she would have returned to work if allowed after her first baby was born
and said she had applied to extend her service to a period of 22 years.
However, the tribunal concluded she wouldn't have returned after her
daughter was born and found she had extended her service only from nine
to 12 years.
Mrs Smitheman, of Larkhall, Lanarkshire, discovered she was pregnant
the year after she married Mr Roy Smitheman, a weapons fitter in the
RAF. She said the pregnancy was not planned. Mr Smitheman had just
accepted an overseas posting on the basis he would not be co-located
with his wife.
Mrs Smitheman was discharged and joined her husband in Germany. Her
daughter Simone was born in June 1981. A second daughter, Kirsty, was
born almost two years later.
Mrs Smitheman joined the RAF training Volunteer Reserve and became a
flight lieutenant. She also worked as a housekeeper for a wing-commander
in Britain. She separated from her husband last year.
Whether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned, the tribunal came to
the view that Mrs Smitheman would have left the RAF anyway in order to
join her husband.
She had claimed her losses to the end of a 12-year engagement were
more than #55,000 and totalled #204,000 up to the date of the tribunal
hearing last month. However, the tribunal limited her award to #1500 for
injury to her feelings, plus interest.
The Ministry of Defence conceded her discharge from the service was
discriminatory. The tribunal had to decide only on the level of
compensation.

SCOTTISH business must emulate Labour's ability to overcome old
prejudices, such as its relationship with the trade unions, by
''throwing off the baggage of the past'' and rejecting hysteria about
the EU Social Chapter, Labour MP Mrs Helen Liddell said yesterday.
Addressing the monthly members' meeting of Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce, Mrs Liddell (Monklands East) said she recognised that many
small businesses feared the consequences of the Social Chapter and a
national minimum wage, but emphasised  that a Labour Government would
help those firms affected.
The first Scotswoman to address the Chamber in the past 20 years, Mrs
Liddell  used the occasion to remind businessmen and women that,
although the trade unions were an inevitable part of the Labour
movement, they no longer controlled the party and Labour leader Tony
Blair ''owes no debts to anyone or to any pressure group.''
In a speech entitled Scotland's Economic and Industrial Future -- the
Poverty of Policy, she told Chamber members that business also should
''set its house in order,'' adding that ''the fat cat salaries of the
public utilities have appalled many and, when we see the management of
Rolls-Royce paying themselves handsomely while closing down or
threatening to close down centres of excellence in Scotland, people have
a right to ask questions.
''The Porsche outside the door of the managing director does not go
down well when workers are earning #1.50 an hour and we all know
businesses here in Scotland where that is happening.''
Mrs Liddell dismissed as hysteria the Government's suggestion that the
Social Chapter would damage companies' profitability and said the
negative rhetoric about it was a sign that the Tories had failed to
recognise that successful businesses were those which empower and give
protection to their workers.
''The reality is that the Social Chapter embodies much that
forward-looking management have been doing here in Scotland and Britain
for years. It is an opportunity to build a framework of best practices.
It is an opportunity to allow the quest for excellence in our business
community to extend from the highest to the lowest.''
She said she recognised that many small businesses were frightened by
the Social Chapter and could be made vulnerable by the national minimum
wage, adding that this ''produced a challenge for the Labour leadership
and for you to find a means of helping those businesses whose day-to-day
running is probably more in the hands of the bank manager than it is in
the hands of the bosses.''
Mrs Liddell said she believed it was up to Labour and the business
community to find a way to help such companies with their initial
difficulties.
She added:''Labour has overcome many of its prejudices. I ask you to
throw off some of the baggage of the past. In your business, you have
had to do it. Now, in the wider society I ask you to do what Labour has
done.''
Mrs Liddell said earlier that the challenge extended to the banks and
claimed Scotland was not as well served as it might be by the financial
institutions.
She said she found it ironic that the Royal Bank of Scotland gave the
Conservative Party overdraft facilities of #17m, yet asked for personal
guarantees for a business loan of #70,000.

FIVE M77 protesters were ejected from the annual meeting of
construction company George Wimpey yesterday for disrupting the
proceedings at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London.
The company allowed about 20 to enter the meeting as they were proxy
shareholders on behalf of Mr Lindsay Keenan, of Glasgow Earth First, who
is a private shareholder.
However, both the press and television cameras were barred -- the
reason given by a Wimpey spokesman was that their presence would only
play into the hands of the opponents of the #53m scheme. The company,
therefore, missed an opportunity to show a wider audience outside the
hall its side of the argument.
After the meeting, another Wimpey representative, Mr Iain McConnell,
director of corporate relations, said people had been thrown out because
a lot of damage had been done to the stage and that some of the elderly
shareholders had complained.
While he was speaking, the proxy holders were tearing up Wimpey annual
reports on the doorstep beneath the impassive gaze of two Scottish
members of the Metropolitan Police.
However, one shareholder said that all that happened was that a
backcloth had fallen, although added the proceedings were ''very
exciting''.
Retired engineer Mr Ray Phillips, who has worked on the Hamilton
by-pass, said he was not sympathetic. He argued that Scotland needed a
good road system.
Mr Keenan said he had ''come along to explain what George Wimpey is
doing in destroying the environment''.
He claimed that security costs already exceeded #450,000 and that the
protesters would make the contract unprofitable.

WAR widows who remarry will no longer lose their right to a pension,
the Government announced yesterday in a #40m concession timed to mark
next month's celebrations of VE Day.
Describing the gesture as proof that the nation recognises ''the debt
we owe to so many,'' Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley announced
that remarried war widows who were subsequently bereaved, divorced, or
legally separated, would have their entitlement to up to #143 a week
reinstated.
The Government, and in particular the Treasury, had opposed the
change, but was forced to make the concession in the face of public and
all-party demands that war widows be among those remembered in a year
dedicated to marking the end of the Second World War.
Opening the second reading of the Pensions Bill, designed to tighten
regulations following the Maxwell affair, Mr Lilley told MPs: ''In this
50th anniversary year, the whole nation wants to recognise those who
sacrificed their lives so we could be free.''
Accepting the amendment making the change, which should take effect
from October, Mr Lilley said the position of some war widows had become
unacceptable and added: ''I am sure this announcement will be well
received by the country as a whole demonstrating this nation's
recognition of the debt we owe to so many.''
Last month, the Government failed, by a majority of 46, to block the
amendment in the Lords, where it was moved by the crossbench peer Lord
Freyberg. At 24, he is the youngest peer in the Lords and the grandson
of a First World War VC.
Under the present arrangement, war widows receive up to #143 a week
for life, tax-free and not means-tested. On remarriage, however, the
pension is withdrawn and a lump-sum worth one year's pension -- up to
#7000 -- is awarded.
MPs on both sides welcomed the announcement, which affects 16,500
women.
Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme -- Con.) said: ''It will go a long way
to alleviating the pain and hardship and unfairness which those who have
suffered under the present arrangements have endured.''
Sir Andrew Bowden (Brighton Kemptown -- Con.) welcomed Mr Lilley's
announcement but said that for Ministers should go further.
''I say with great regret that I believe that all governments since
the end of the Second World War should hang their heads in shame at the
way they have treated war widows.
''I hope in this 50th anniversary year the Government will look again
and give more help to war widows.''
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar welcomed a decision he
said was ''a change that will mean something to a very important group
in our community''. He regretted the Government had not seen fit to back
the measure in the Lords.
The Pensions Bill was given a second reading without a vote after a
Labour attack on the legislation was defeated by 267 votes to 228, a
Government majority of 39.
Mr Lilley also said during the debate that the Government would not
accept a Lords amendment which would base a person's
State-Earnings-Related Pension (Serps) on the best 44 years of earnings
rather than a full working life.
He said: ''This amendment would increase expenditure in a poorly
targeted way and would cost over #2.5bn a year by the middle of the next
century. I believe that my proposals give a viable and affordable Serps
for the longer term and I will therefore be asking the House to reverse
the effects of this costly Labour amendment.''
Mr Dewar said Labour accepted much of what was contained in the Bill,
but would scrutinise its details. The party was committed to a flexible
decade of retirement. ''It seems to us that the emphasis should be one
of choice. It is important because choice matters. It seems strange I
should have to preach that point to the Conservative backbenches,'' he
said.
Mr Churchill later called for British pensioners living abroad to get
a full pension. In many countries, they received only part or frozen
pensions -- a prospect that he said had not been made clear to members
of this ''hero generation'' before they went to live overseas in the
1940s and 1950s.
Labour MP Mrs Helen Liddell (Monklands East) said that for many people
affected by the Maxwell scandal ''the chapter would never be closed''.
She said many had lost money and others had not lived to see the
legislation come about.
She added: ''A great deal of the lessons that should have been learned
have not been learned and I hope that in committee some of this can be
put right.''
* The Bill's second reading brought immediate condemnation from the
Confederation of Occupational Pensioners' Associations, which claimed
the measure would be a licence for bad employers to underfund
occupational schemes and to cream off surpluses.

THE parents of Melissa Reid, who died in an infection outbreak at a
special care baby unit, were last night considering calling for a fatal
accident inquiry.
Yesterday, following press intervention, the couple were finally shown
the results of a post-mortem examination of their daughter -- almost a
month after the report became available on March 28.
Hospital managers sent a taxi to collect the Reids, who claim they
have been ignored since Melissa's death on March 24. Then they
apologised for not keeping the parents properly informed.
They admitted that a vital filter in a humidifier, which helped
Melissa to breathe, had been missing and blamed human error.
Melissa suffered a heart attack in February. She died, aged three
months, on March 24, just hours after she was christened.
Now Morag and James Reid are considering calling for a fatal accident
inquiry into their daughter's treatment at the special care baby unit at
Ninewells hospital in Dundee.
Mrs Reid, 29, of Logie Street, Dundee said: ''When I asked about the
missing filter, they admitted human error.
''I have nothing but praise for the nurses at the unit but they don't
have the resources and the staff they need.
''I am helping to raise cash for a mobile incubator by organising a
car boot sale. I just don't want this to happen again.''
Last night, Labour's health spokesman, Mr John McAllion MP, said he
was concerned at the questions raised by Mrs Reid and demanded the early
publication of an independent inquiry by two consultants into the
Ninewells outbreak and its handling.
A spokesman for Ninewells confirmed the hospital had met the parents
and said there would be a further meeting next week.

<HEADLINE>Leniency for 'sexual slave' killer. Judge told how older woman humiliated Untouchable servant</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978714888</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PENNILESS servant treated as ''a sexual slave'' by his older woman
employer finally snapped and killed her after a row, the Old Bailey
heard yesterday.
Essaki Gopal, 27, was forced to massage 47-year-old Mrs Indu
Bhagchandaney night and morning and to have sex with her.
She and her son humiliated him in front of friends and acquaintances
and he was made to cook and clean for them without pay, said Mr David
Calvert-Smith, prosecuting.
After stabbing and strangling her, and fracturing her skull, Gopal cut
off her head and sawed her body into 12 pieces. It was found after
workmen at a refuse tip discovered an arm. Her head was discovered
floating in a stream by a man walking his dog.
However, because of the way he was treated, the Crown had taken ''the
highly unusual, almost exceptional'' course of accepting his plea of not
guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of
provocation, said Mr Calvert-Smith.
Gopal, an Untouchable, was jailed for four years and recommended for
deportation by the judge who told him: ''You were brought to this
country from India as a servant, after your arrival you were treated for
eight months as a slave.
''You were starved, physically assaulted, and you were not paid. In
addition, you were used by your employer as an object of sexual
gratification.''
He said Gopal had made attempts to escape but when he was assaulted
again ''your self control snapped and you killed the woman . . . who had
treated you in such a barbaric and humiliating manner''.
Mr Calvert-Smith said: ''Although it is clear Gopal had good reason
and no doubt did come to hate his employer, it seems there was also a
sexual attraction of some kind.''
However, he had also complained repeatedly of his treatment and
friends and workmen renovating Mrs Bhagchandaney's #150,000 four-bedroom
home in Finchley Lane, north London, were all aware of it and felt sorry
for him.
It had been arranged that he would work without pay as Mrs
Bhagchandaney's servant for three to five years. At the end, he would be
paid in rupees for the work he had done.
Mr Calvert-Smith said Gopal was brought to Britain from India by the
victim's father in July 1993. He had been his servant. Gopal, from a
village outside Madras, was hoping to improve his family's standard of
living.
He complained that he had no money and was not allowed to sleep or eat
properly and he tried to plan his escape.
''It was quite clear to others he was suffering very unfair and indeed
barbarous treatment at the hands of his employers,'' said Mr
Calvert-Smith.
On one occasion, visitors noticed his head was shaved in a peculiar
way. It turned out that rather than pay for him to have a haircut Mrs
Bhagchandaney's son Rajesh, a tailor, had cut it himself.
His employer told him if he complained about his treatment she would
''cut him up in pieces''.
In March last year when he was already an illegal immigrant because
his visa had expired, Gopal asked a friend to look after his passport
and driving licence.
Mr Calvert-Smith said although this might indicate he had pre-planned
the killing it was more likely he was genuinely planning his escape from
the house where he was treated ''not only physically as a slave but
sexually as well.''
Rajesh was abroad on a business trip when his mother was killed. When
he returned Gopal claimed she had taken the car and gone away.
But by this time police had found her remains and kept the house under
observation. They had been able to identify her quickly from
fingerprints as she had a DHSS fraud conviction.
Mr William Clegg, QC, in mitigation said Gopal had been treated
''worse than a dog'', forced to work from early morning until late at
night for no pay and to sleep on the floor of an unheated room. His
employer kept a long cane in the corner of her room and he was regularly
beaten with it.
Mr Clegg said Gopal finally snapped after Mrs Bhagchandaney assaulted
him again.
''Many a man not used to subservience would have snapped a great deal
earlier. But in India Gopal was used to subservience. He was an
Untouchable.''
He lived with his family in a one-roomed thatched hut and had come
here to try to raise money for his sisters' dowries, without which they
could not marry.
Ironically, Gopal, ''a simple young man'' with no previous
convictions, was now living in Brixton Prison on a level of luxury he
had never experienced before, sleeping on a bed and getting regular
meals.

SECURITY staff were carrying out a search of the Clyde Submarine Base
early today after peace protesters claimed they had entered the base.
A spokeswoman for the Faslane peace camp said that eight of their
members had penetrated security last night.
Ms Pat Freeborn said their mission was to ''liberate'' three high
speed inflatable dinghies belonging to Greenpeace, which were impounded
by the Navy at the weekend.
On Saturday, Greenpeace supporters attempted to prevent the departure
of the Trident submarine Vanguard on patrol, by spreading fishing nets
in its path.
A spokesman for the base said staff were investigating the alleged
break-in, but no trace of protesters had been found early today.

THE Labour MP who launched the safety campaign for the A1 route
through his East Lothian constituency yesterday welcomed the the start
of the first phase of a dual-carriageway project.
However, Mr John Home Robertson warned that the fight for the
upgrading of the whole route between Edinburgh and Newcastle would
continue.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Minister for Roads and
Transport, performed the sod-cutting ceremony for reconstruction of the
road between Haddington and Tranent.
The #27.9m safety work will upgrade the busiest section of single
carriageway on the A1, bypassing Gladsmuir and Haddington.
Mr Home Robertson said the upgrading would save lives and boost the
economy.
He said that, less than five years ago, the Scottish Office had
maintained A1 traffic flows did not justify dualling, adding: ''The A1
Safelink Campaign has forced the Government to think again.''

FOUR men appeared before magistrates yesterday charged with the murder
of teenager Stephen Lawrence after his parents launched a private
prosecution.
On Saturday, Neville and Doreen Lawrence applied to Greenwich
magistrates for summonses and warrants for arrest against the four men
they believe responsible for their son's killing.
School student Stephen, 18, died of stab wounds after he was attacked
at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, two years ago last Saturday.
Appearing before Greenwich magistrates were Neil Acourt, 19, Luke
Knight, 18, David Norris, 18, and a fourth man, also aged 18, who cannot
be named for legal reasons.
The addresses of the defendants were not read out in court after their
legal representatives made an application to stipendary magistrate David
Cooper.
All four were remanded in custody until May 2.
Stephen Lawrence's parents were at court for the remand hearing. The
defendants' mothers were also present.
Applications for bail were turned down.
Afterwards, the Lawrence's solicitor Imran Khan said: ''The family and
myself are happy that proceedings have now started two years after the
event.
''I would have liked the Crown Prosecution Service to have continued
the proceedings.''
On Sunday, about 300 people attended a memorial service for Stephen --
an unveiling of a plaque at the spot in Well Hall Road, Eltham, where he
fell.

<RECORDNO>978714892</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAN told a murder trial at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday of
the day he found a body stuffed inside a wheelie-bin.
Mr Ronald Kee, 38, said two women were standing beside the bin and
told him they thought it was a dummy.
He told the court he reached in and felt a hand which was sticking up
and knew it was a man.
Mr Kee said the body of 48-year-old Kenneth Syme was doubled up inside
the bin with his head between his legs and with an arm pointing upwards.
Earlier, witnesses claimed that Mr Syme, of Fullers Gate, Faifley,
Clydebank, had been thrown from a fourth-floor window in nearby
Watchmeal Crescent early on New Year's Day.
They also alleged the body was carried back to the same bedroom and
thrown out again by 35-year-old Kenneth McGuire, who later put the body
in a wheelie-bin.
Mr McGuire denies repeatedly throwing Mr Syme out of the window of his
flat and murdering him on January 1 last and hiding his body in a
wheelie-bin.
He also denies assaulting Mr John Slevin, 39, in the flat that night,
and threatening to throw Mr Ian Reid, c/o the police, from a window in
the flat on December 15 last.
Mr McGuire has lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming
Michael Fay, 28, and Raymond Henfry, 28, who have had their pleas of not
guilty to the murder charge accepted by the Crown.
Fay has pleaded guilty to throwing Mr Syme out of the window and
attempting to murder him, and Henfry has admitted moving Mr Syme in a
wheelie-bin with intent to defeat the ends of justice.
They will be sentenced at the end of the trial.
Yesterday, Mr Kee, of Faifley Road, Clydebank, told Mr Ian Duguid,
prosecuting, that a boy approached him on New Year's Day and said there
was someone in a wheelie-bin near some lock-up garages near his home.
He thought the boy was joking but later went to investigate when he
saw two women standing looking at the bin. Then he discovered the body.
Earlier, Henfry claimed he saw Mr McGuire and Fay throwing the body
out of the window during a party, and that Mr Syme had shouted: ''No,
no'' as he disappeared over the edge.
He said he and Fay brought the victim back up ''still breathing'' but
that Mr McGuire shouted ''What's that bastard doing back here'' and
''papped'' him back out the window again.
Mr Douglas Gordon, 33, c/o the police, said he went to the party with
Mr Syme and knew there was some trouble about a Giro cheque with Mr
McGuire.
Mr Gordon claimed he heard Maguire asking why Mr Syme had been brought
back to the bedroom and alleged he was ''60 to 80% certain'' that Mr
McGuire ''papped him back out again''.

THE technical manager of His Majesty's Theatre in Aberdeen has been
suspended just one week after he was given a vote of ''full confidence''
by the theatre director.
The vote of confidence in Mr Jon Kerr came in the wake of allegations
that he was involved in bullying. Theatre director, Mr Robert Robson,
said an investigation had been carried out but no substance had been
found in the allegations.
However, Mr Kerr was suspended on full pay on Friday following a
further allegation into an incident which is said to have occurred last
week.
Bectu -- the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cineomatograph, and Theatre
union -- had claimed Aberdeen District Council was trying to sweep the
initial allegations under the carpet.
The union had prepared a document listing 12 alleged incidents of
bullying on behalf of its 20 members who work in the theatre.
Mr Kerr started work in Aberdeen four years ago following a similar
post with the Globe Theatre in Belfast.
The claims included approaching a stage hand from behind and holding a
dagger at his throat during a performance of Sherlock Holmes and the
Crucifer of Blood. During the same run, he is also alleged to have
forced a 8mm starting pistol against the man's head.
Mr Kerr has claimed the incidents were nothing more than normal
horseplay and the allegations were as a result of ''sour grapes'' about
his appointment and subsequent appointments he made.
A meeting has been scheduled early next month between Bectu officials
and Aberdeen District Council, which owns the theatre, to clear the air.
The union said it was confident the situation could be resolved.
Yesterday, its national officer, Mr Willie Donaghy, said: ''I am aware
there was an incident but I am not party to the reason for his
suspension.''

A FATHER told a murder trial yesterday of a happy Christmas Day dinner
party which was followed by tragedy.
Mr John Frater, 42, said the family gathering was the last time he saw
his 17-year-old son John, a Borders rugby player, alive.
Mr Frater, of Priors Meadow, Jedburgh, said that hours later he was
roused from his bed by police who told him John was dead.
Mr Frater was giving evidence at the opening of the trial of Mr Kevin
Maxwell, 31, who denies murdering Mr John Frater, of Priors Meadow,
Jedburgh, in Crown Lane, Jedburgh, by stabbing him with a knife.
Mr Maxwell, described as a prisoner, also denies attacking Mr Steven
Frater, 16, brother of the deceased, by striking him with a knife to his
injury.
Mr Frater told the High Court in Edinburgh that John was the eldest of
four children. The family, including John and Steven, went to their
grandmother's home for Christmas dinner.
Mr Frater said: ''The last time I saw John was in his grandmother's
house at Christmas dinner -- December 25. He left there at six in the
evening. He was going to get changed and go out with his girlfriend. He
had brought a change of clothes with him.''
Mr Frater said John had only two glasses of wine at the dinner.
He added: ''He seemed all right, the last time I saw him.''
About 1.30am on December 26, Mr Frater said police officers came to
the house and told him his son was dead.
He said he then went to the mortuary in Edinburgh and identified his
son's body.
He said ''John's main hobby was rugby, he was a fit, healthy boy who
never took drugs.''
Later, Steven Frater told the court that he was walking with his
girlfriend Lesley Short in High Street, Jedburgh, after the Christmas
dinner. His brother John and a friend were walking ahead of them.
He said that as he walked past a close, a man standing in the entrance
made a remark about Lesley.
The man, who he identified in court as Mr Maxwell, came out and put
his hand behind his back. He said that he thought Mr Maxwell was going
for a knife and he smashed a bottle of vodka over Mr Maxwell's head.
He said Mr Maxwell later caught up with the group and at first just
walked behind them. However, when they turned into Crown Lane, Mr
Maxwell became aggressive and demanded to know why he had been hit over
the head with the bottle.
Steven told the court he became frightened when Mr Maxwell again
reached behind his back, so he head-butted Mr Maxwell.
He added: ''Mr Maxwell got back up and stuck a knife into my brother's
chest.''
The trial before Lord Milligan continues.

<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE chiefs were again under fire last night after revealing
details of a new multi-million pound contract.
The Tay 620 engines involved in the deal with airline Alitalia were
designed and produced at East Kilbride, but the contract -- worth more
than #50m -- will not save the 600 workers there who are facing the axe.
News of the order came as management and union leaders at the aero
engine design unit met for talks for the first time since strike action
began. It has sparked a fresh outcry in the increasingly bitter dispute.
East Kilbride Labour MP Adam Ingram said it was another example of the
''twisted logic'' shown by management. Shop stewards' convener Graham
Irvine described it as ''a new stab in the back for the work-force''.
The deal is for 30 Tay 620 engines for the twin-engine Fokker 70
plane. Industry experts say #50m is a ''conservative estimate'' of its
value to Rolls-Royce.
Work on the order will be carried out at the firm's Derby works, the
plant that will benefit from the closure of East Kilbride's profitable
aero- engine design unit.
Last night, a company spokesman said the deal would have ''no
bearing'' on the decision to close the East Kilbride plant and transfer
production to Derby and Bristol.
Mr Ingram said: ''It shows the twisted logic of Rolls-Royce. East
Kilbride workers designed and produced this engine yet, instead of
sharing in its success, they are to be rewarded by losing their jobs.
''They have every right to be furious and that's why the fight to save
these jobs must go on.''
Mr Irvine said: ''It is utterly disgusting. All the work on this
engine was done in East Kilbride. It is a new stab in the back to what
was a dedicated, highly skilled, and highly productive work-force.''
Workers are on strike today and tomorrow. They will decide on new
strike action at a further mass meeting. Union leaders say the action
will cripple production because the plant still has orders to fulfil.

CAMPAIGNERS yesterday demanded the introduction of a proper system for
keeping crime victims informed of the progress of their cases throughout
the prosecution process.
The call came as a new Scottish Office survey showed that only one in
10 victims felt that they were kept well informed by police and courts.
Officials believe that a new computer system, scheduled for installation
in procurator-fiscal offices next year, could be used to help improve
matters.
However, the Victim Support Scotland organisation is seeking more
sweeping measures. Director Alison Paterson said: ''We accept that
computerisation is going to be helpful to some victims but many victims
talk about insensitive treatment.
''We are very concerned about the human face of giving information. We
would hope the Government would look at the need to put in place victim
liaison staff in the various services to ensure that an already
over-burdened procurator-fiscal service does not have yet another
expectation put upon it that it cannot meet.
''We are pleased to see the Government funding this kind of research,
and the results back up our experience on the ground, but we need
concrete signs about what it is going to put in place as a result of the
research, and the Scottish Office statement is not clear about that.''
0 According to the Scottish Office research report published
yesterday, all police forces in Scotland have a policy for keeping
victims informed, although the frequency and method of providing
information are not always specified.
Unless the case is very serious or the victim particularly vulnerable,
procurators-fiscal provide information only when victims ask for it.
The research showed that some fiscals felt this reactive system was
acceptable as they did not have enough time or resources to give
information to every victim. Others felt that a more proactive approach
might improve satisfaction among victims.
Almost half of the victims surveyed had received some information on
their case from the police. Older female victims were most likely, and
young males least likely, to be kept informed.
The vast majority of those victims who had not received information at
key stages of their case had wanted it.
A Scottish Office spokesman pointed out that the main focus of the
research was on those victims who would not have face-to-face meetings
with the prosecutor, so the survey did not include victims of serious
offences such as rape.
The research was carried out in response to a White Paper, published
last year, on the Government's commitment to improving the treatment of
crime victims and possible ways in which this could be done.
The spokesman said the research had provided useful information about
what victims wished to know and how this should be provided.

THE Forth Rail Bridge, described recently in various quarters as a
rusting hulk and as being in a deplorable state, is to have a partial
face-lift.
Last night, however, Fife Central MP Mr Henry McLeish called on
Railtrack to come clean over the ''appalling confusion'' which has
arisen over the state of the bridge.
Residents of North Queensferry in Fife, whose homes adjoin the bridge,
have been told by Railtrack, which maintains it, that netting would be
erected during the next week.
Scottish director Mr Paul Prescott said yesterday that this would be a
prelude to the erection of scaffolding to enable painting of sections of
the approach viaduct.
He said painting was expected to begin next month and, when completed
later this year, would significantly improve the appearance of the
bridge from the homes in North Queensferry.
Railtrack stated this was part of ''routine maintenance'', although
pressure groups, including Fife Regional Council, have been highly
critical of the state of the whole bridge.
Mr McLeish said the decision initally to repaint the north viaduct was
only a short-term cosmetic move and would in no way reassure residents
of North Queensferry.
More importantly, he said, the real concern was on the structural
safety of the bridge into the next century.
He added: ''We know the Health and Safety Executive is to undertake a
review of the bridge and the possibility of whether any structural
damage goes beyond any cosmetic exercise has to be made clear.
''I think this latest decision will raise fears of North Queensferry
residents rather than allay them.''
The MP said he had received reports from local people of peeling paint
and, in one case, metal falling from the structure, and visited it
personally with Labour colleague, Mr Gordon Brown.
''It is in a deplorable state,'' said Mr McLeish.
''Any long-term problems for the stability of the bridge, an important
east coast rail link to the north of Scotland, have to be addressed from
a commuting and development potential situation.''
In defending its decision to postpone regular painting of the
105-year-old structure, Railtrack said recently that the appearance of
the bridge was superficial and that it was structurally sound.
Junior Transport Minister Steven Norris also admitted in the House of
Commons that, from a cosmetic point of view, it could look better, but
it would cost Railtrack tens of millions of pounds to make it resemble a
gleaming tourist attraction.
Yesterday, a spokesman for Fife Regional Counil, which has been
emphasising the importance of the rail link across the Forth for future
industrial development, said: ''We do not wish to comment at this stage
until we know the extent of the work.''

A KNOWN criminal shot dead when armed officers confronted a gang of
four masked raiders inside a social club may not have been armed, a
police chief admitted last night.
The Police Complaints Authority is investigating the death of the man,
who has not yet been identified formally -- although he was known to the
police.
The man, in his early twenties, was shot dead early yesterday after a
Northumbria Police tactical firearms team challenged the gang, who had
broken into the Excelsior Social Club at Westerhope, on the edge of
Newcastle upon Tyne.
The shooting came some time after the four forced their way through a
ground-floor window into the accommodation of steward Don Gray, which
gave direct access to the club.
Armed officers were lying in wait at about 3am inside the club, after
advance information that the raid would take place. More officers, not
all of them armed, were on duty outside.
A single shot was fired and one raider died. The others escaped
through the window by which they entered the club.
At a news conference last night, Northumbria Assistant Chief Constable
Alan Oliver offered an apology to the dead man's relatives, who have not
yet been traced.
He said at this stage they did not know whether or not he or any of
the others had been armed.
''I would say my concern at the present time is the tragic loss of
life which has occurred in this case and I would offer, when we do
formally identify the victim, sincere apologies for the fact of the
death.
''But equally, it was in the process, as we would see it at the
present time, of a criminal offence being committed.''
So far, no firearm has been found, although an imitation gun and a ski
mask were discovered later, along with items of clothing, near a flat in
the city's Newbiggin Hall area, not far from Westerhope.
Although there were officers outside the club during the incident, the
three raiders who escaped apparently succeeded in eluding them, possibly
as a result of bad weather obscuring what was happening.
However, since the incident, several people have been arrested and
others are being sought. Those in custody are being held for questioning
at several police stations in the city.
The Police Complaints Authority has approved the appointment of Mr
Eddy Marchant, assistant chief constable of neigbouring Durham Police,
to head the inquiry into the shooting.
While the identity of the dead man has not yet been confirmed,
Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Crimmens, the force's CID chief,
told the news conference they believed they knew who he was.
''He is previously known to us through criminal activity and is in his
early twenties. I don't want to say anything more about his identity
until his relatives have been informed -- we are seeking them at the
present time,'' he said.
Mr Oliver confirmed that ''something'' was found under the dead man's
body but it was not a gun.
Asked if the man might have been holding something which looked like a
gun, he said: ''That is something for the investigators to consider.''
He added that it was ''a hand held object but I can't say further than
that.
''It may have been a torch but I cannot comment any further. It was
not an imitation firearm,'' he said.
A doctor and paramedics attended the man after he was shot but he was
found to be dead, said Mr Oliver.
Mr Oliver said the club's weekend takings would have been the likely
target.
He explained that the normal procedure when armed police confronted
suspected criminals would be to shout ''as many warnings as it would
take''.
The team waiting inside the club comprised ''fully trained and fully
experienced officers but I cannot comment on whether they have been
involved in armed operations before''.
Mr Oliver said the operation was mounted because of a tip-off.
Asked whether the information was that the gang would be armed, he
replied: ''I cannot comment specifically and directly on that but,
clearly, we would not have mounted an armed operation had we not
believed that armed people would be involved in the commission of the
crime.''
The officers involved in the shooting had received counselling, he
said, stressing there was no question of any suspension arising from it.
The break-in and shooting were not a ''simple immediate sequence'', he
added -- there was a ''considerable time'' in between.

BRITISH Waterways yesterday formally submitted its bid for #50m of
funding from the Millennium Commission towards the restoration of
Scotland's Lowland canals, writes DUNCAN BLACK.
The #100m Millennium Link scheme would restore the Forth and Clyde,
and Union canals and provide a navigable route across Central Scotland,
linking Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Supporters will learn in July whether the commission has chosen it as
one of the major projects intended to celebrate the end of the second
millennium AD.
Yesterday, in a ceremony outside British Waterways' Glasgow office on
the Forth and Clyde Canal, a coal-fired steamboat led a flotilla of
canal boats to mark the submission of the bid.
Originally, consultants estimated that the project would create 4000
permanent jobs. However, their latest study has produced an increased
figure of between 4200 and 4600. The scheme is expected to lead to a
gross private sector investment of #400m.

FORMER Celtic footballer Alan McInally appeared at Ayr Sheriff Court
yesterday after being arrested at the home of his estranged wife.
Mr McInally, 32, of Kilmarnock Road, Monkton, had been held by police
in the early hours of Sunday at the house of Mrs Rhona McInally in
Greenfield Avenue, Alloway.
An interdict gained by Mrs McInally in September 1993 prevents her
husband from visiting the house.
Yesterday, Sheriff Colin Miller considered a petition by the
procurator-fiscal stating that Mr McInally had breached certain aspects
the interdict.
The petition said Mr McInally had gone to the house in the early hours
of Sunday, demanded entry, and shouted and swore at Mrs McInally.
It went on to state that while no criminal charges would be made
against him he should be held at Barlinnie until tomorrow at noon.
The action had been brought under the Matrimonial Homes (Family
Protection) Act, 1981, which allows for a maximum detention of 48 hours
in such cases.
This would have dated from Mr McInally's court appearance yesterday.
Sheriff Miller heard from Mr Ian Gillies, solicitor for Mrs McInally,
that his client did not wish to see the matter taken any further, and
that she does not intend to raise a separate action for breach of
interdict.
After hearing further submissions from Ms Iona MacDonald, on behalf of
Mr McInally, Sheriff Miller dismissed the petition and released Mr
McInally.
Mr McInally played with Ayr United and Celtic before joining Aston
Villa.
He then went abroad, playing for a spell with Bayern Munich where an
injury brought his career to an end.
Since returning to Scotland, he played on a couple of occasions with
Kilmarnock, but is no longer playing top-class football full time.
Mr McInally was first capped for Scotland against Cyprus in 1989 and
went on to play eight times for his country in the following two
seasons.

AN ENGLISH company was named yesterday as the saviour of one of
Scotland's best-known tourist attractions, the steam train service
between Fort William and Mallaig, writes CALUM MACDONALD.
The service, which was previously run by a division of the British
Railways Board, faced extinction after rail re-organisation left it
without an operator.
However, the West Coast Railway Company of Lancashire said it would
operate 60 trips this summer, each carrying around 300 passengers.
Company spokesman Mr David Smith said that, depending on the response,
he hoped to run the service for a further four years.
He praised the support provided by local enterprise company, Lochaber
Limited, the Fort William and Lochaber area tourist board, ScotRail, and
Railtrack.
Lochaber Limited has agreed to spend #20,000 on marketing the service,
which it sees as of major importance to the local economy.
The move was also welcomed by local MP Charles Kennedy. He said the
involvement of the LEC should send a signal to both Highlands and
Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Office.
''They must now agree to fund the sleeper and Motorail services over
the summer months, with a similar marketing package, to give a real
chance for consultation over the future of those services.''

<HEADLINE>Survey finds double standards over drink in the boardroom</HEADLINE>

THE problem of drinking in the boardroom is likely to be targeted in
future national alcohol awareness campaigns.
A survey commissioned by the Scottish Council on Alcohol shows that
many Scottish managers and professional workers think it is more
acceptable for them to drink during office hours than it is for other
staff.
Many people in the highest social group are the least likely to regard
drinking as a major source of problems in the workplace.
The survey, carried out by System Three as part of a study of
attitudes towards alcohol in the workplace, shows that those most likely
to report awareness of drinking were in the managerial and professional
social class group ABC1s (37%), compared to C2s (29%), and DEs (28%).
However, those in the higher social grouping were least likely to view
alcohol as a major source of workplace problems, with 31% of ABC1s
regarding it as a major problem, compared with C2s (40%), and DEs (36%).
The SCA findings, based on the survey results, say this may reflect
''false stereotypes'' about what constitutes problem drinking or that it
is more acceptable for those in the higher social groups to drink at
work.
''This suggests we may have to target future alcohol awareness
campaigns towards boardroom, professional, supervisory, and managerial
groups.''
The survey results were released at the launch of the SCA's second
annual awards scheme, which recognises employers who adopt sensible
policies and practices to help minimise the problems of alcohol misuse
in the workplace and to help those with alcohol problems.
Dr Alex Crawford, director of Renfrew Council on Alcohol and one of
the scheme's judges, said: ''Many of the existing stereotypes on
drinking habits are untested and we will be trying to explode some of
the myths.
''We are particularly interested in looking at the differences between
employers and employees, to see if their drinking habits are better or
worse.''
Mr Douglas Allsop, director of the SCA, said: ''There has been a
change over the last five years among employers about the impact alcohol
can have on the workforce. A tremendous number of employers have shown
interest in developing a policy on what is the biggest cause of
employment problems in Scotland.''
The scheme is sponsored by the Portman Group, which promotes sensible
drinking on behalf of Britain's major alcoholic drinks companies.
The survey was based on 1083 randomly-selected people aged 16 and
above who were representative of the Scottish adult population. They
were interviewed between March 23 and 28.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry told of rise in jail suicides</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978714904</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SEVEN inmates of Perth's top security jail have hanged themselves
during the past 15 months, it was disclosed yesterday.
Dr William Shennan, 40, a prison medical officer, told a fatal
accident inquiry at Perth Sheriff Court that six prisoners committed
suicide during 1994 and a seventh this year.
He said: ''The number of suicides last year was certainly high and out
of the ordinary. Until then, we maybe had one a year, two at the most.''
The doctor said that all the recent deaths were by hanging.
The inquiry followed the death last July 13 of Daniel Ward, 29, of
Livingston, West Lothian, who had served two years of a life sentence
for murder.
He was found hanging from a ceiling beam in his cell by a noose made
from a torn sheet and a shoe lace.
Dr Shennan said that Ward was HIV positive and probably contracted the
condition because of his homosexuality.
Another medical officer, Dr Daniel Carlin, 44, said Ward, attended the
prison surgery regularly and had been prescribed an anti-depressant
drug.
He continued: ''On his last visit on July 11, he said things would be
better if he wasn't here but he did not give the impression of being
suicidal. He assured me he didn't intend to harm himself. If I had
thought he was suicidal he would have been placed on special
supervision.''
Mr Murdoch Ward, 33, of Livingston, said he last visited his brother
two months before his death.
He said: ''He told me then that I would hear about him in the news. I
wasn't sure what he meant -- maybe that he would break out. I didn't
realise what he had on his mind.''
In a reference to Ward's HIV status, inmate William Gibson, 24, said:
''Tony found it difficult having two life sentences. He was very
depressed and more than once said that he was going to take his life. I
was so worried about his safety that I wrote to the Samaritans about
him. He died two days after I sent the letter.''
The inquiry continues.

A CRASH investigator claimed in a court yesterday that a driver who is
suing the family of a teenager killed in a road accident, was cutting a
corner and driving too fast.
Mr Norman Airey, an accident investigator, told Greenock Sheriff Court
that before Alan Inglis collided with Mr Stuart McKeegan's car, Mr
Inglis was, in his view, already veering into the middle of the road at
an excessive speed.
Mr Inglis, of Gourock, had previously been convicted of reckless
driving after the crash nearly four years ago.
Having examined photographs of the crash in which 18-year-old Mr
McKeegan died, he said it was also possible that Mr Inglis, who had
already admitted driving at over 70mph, had lost control of his vehicle.
He also dismissed Mr Inglis' claim that Mr McKeegan had been driving
on the wrong side of the road.
Mr McKeegan, a student at Glasgow's Caledonian University, was killed
on the A78 near Inverkip Cottages on July 3, 1991.
He had been driving from his home in Wemyss Bay on the Clyde coast to
visit his grandmother in Greenock. A jury later convicted Mr Inglis of
reckless driving but deleted the section in the charge which accused him
of causing Mr McKeegan's death.
Mr Airey's evidence came on the final day of evidence of a civil
action raised by Mr Inglis against the dead teenager's parents, William
and Joan McKeegan.
Mr Inglis is claiming #60,000 in loss of earnings and injuries.
Although admitting he was driving at 70mph, he claims he was not
responsible for Mr McKeegan's death because the teenager had been
driving on the wrong side of the road.
However, giving evidence before Sheriff Sir Stephen Young, Mr Airey
said that from the positioning of Mr McKeegan's car after the accident,
and from the tyre skid marks left by Mr Inglis car, it was not possible
that the Mr McKeegan had been on the wrong side.
Instead, he suggested that Mr McKeegan had swerved right in an attempt
to avoid Mr Inglis as he cut the corner at high speed.
Another witness, Mr William Logan, told the court that he had been
outside his former home beside the A78 when he had heard a car being
driven at high speed.
He said he looked up and a second later saw the crash. He added that
Mr McKeegan had been driving on the right side of the road and was not
going fast.
Mr Inglis' lawyer, Mr Alistair Leggat, told the court that Mr Inglis
had seen Mr McKeegan's Vauxhall Nova on the wrong side of the road.
''The evidence of the pursuer (Mr Inglis) was that he was driving at
70mph, he goes round the bend, sees the vehicle on his side of the road
and brakes hard.''
Advocate Maria Maguire, representing Mr and Mrs McKeegan, claimed Mr
Inglis was to blame for the accident -- a claim she said was supported
in evidence given by several witnesses and Mr Airey.
''The pursuer has not proved his case to the required standard. The
facts support the contenders' contention that the accident was caused
soley by and was the fault of the pursuer.''
Sheriff Young said he would deliver his judgment in due course.
Mr Inglis refused to make any comment before being driven away from
the court.

A MAN was arrested last night after an incident involving a firearm at
a health centre in Aviemore.
Nine staff and about a dozen patients were led to safety as police,
some armed, cordoned off the building in the village's main street
shortly after 5pm.
A spokesman at Northern Constabulary's headquarters in Inverness
declined to give details of the incident but it is understood that a
40-year-old man was receiving treatment at the centre when medical staff
saw he was carrying what appeared to be a gun.
They contacted the police, who advised that the building should be
evacuated. Officers and police dogs were sent from Inverness to support
colleagues in the Speyside holiday village.
About 90 minutes after the incident began, police confirmed that a man
was in custody. He was thought to have been detained at Aviemore's
police station.
Local photographer Pavel Satny said later: ''Some of the staff at the
centre managed to usher the patients out.
''The incident ended quite dramatically when a man came out and threw
something on to the roof of the building. It bounced back off on to the
street below.
''At that point, about five police officers overpowered the man.''
The incident had begun soon after the opening of evening surgery at
the centre, which is situated opposite Aviemore's ambulance and fire
stations and only 200yds from the police station.
Three doctors, Jill Irvine, Angus MacNeill, and George Jachacy, were
on duty, along with four nursing staff and two receptionists.
It is understood that they, and the patients, left from the rear of
the centre, which is administered by the Highland Communities NHS Trust.
No-one was thought to have been injured.
Staff at the centre later refused to comment on the incident and
referred all inquiries to police. Patients arriving for the second
surgery of the evening also were turned away and told the centre would
reopen this morning.
Police were still at the scene last night, interviewing staff and
patients, although the popular skiing village, busy with visitors, had
otherwise returned to normal.
Police later confirmed that patients visiting the centre had been
evacuated, as were a number of medical, nursing and medical staff.
A report on the incident was being submitted to local
procurator-fiscal. Police say that a 40-year-old man is expected to
appear today at Inverness Sheriff Court.

AN announcement is expected this week which could save the Mar Lodge
estate on Deeside for the nation, it emerged yesterday -- as a #1m
conservation project was announced for another national treasure, the
Cairngorms.
The National Trust for Scotland is set to finalise a deal, believed to
be worth around #9m, for the 77,000-acre Mar Lodge estate, and it is
understood that cash from the National Lottery may be used partly to
fund the purchase.
Mar Lodge is owned by American billionaire John Kluge, who bought the
estate as a wedding gift for his wife Patricia, a former belly dancer
and soft-porn actress, in 1989.
She wanted to live near the Royal Family and Mar Lodge borders
Balmoral Estate.
When the couple split up in 1991, Mr Kluge put the estate on the
market for #13m.
Following an approach by Prince Charles, he dropped the asking price
to #10m, with the proviso that it must be bought for the nation and
managed for conservation purposes.
The estate stretches from Deeside to the summits of three of Britain's
five highest mountains -- Cairn Toul, Braeriach, and Ben Macdui.
Now the National Trust for Scotland, which has been involved in
protracted negotiations with Mr Kluge, look set to take over the estate.
It is not known if Mr Kluge is prepared to sell the estate or if it
will be leased to the trust.
A key management agreement is understood to have been hammered out
between the trust and Scottish Natural Heritage, the Government's
environmental agency in Scotland.
However, the National Trust would be expected to continue to allow
sporting interests such as deer stalking and grouse shooting.
Meanwhile, it was announced by Scottish Natural Heritage that about
#1m is to be spent on a conservation project for the Cairngorms.
The money will be used to help the newly-formed Cairngorm Partnership,
set up to resolve conflict between conservation and development in the
area.
SNH, which normally spends around #500,000 on the Cairngorms, says it
is committed to making the partnership body work.
It said most of the money will be spent in grants for repairing eroded
footpaths, improving ranger service coverage, and providing visitor
interpretation facilities.
It will also be used to establish an inventory of the key natural
heritage features of the area for future use.
''We will be looking at a whole range of surveys to see what state the
natural heritage of the Cairngorms is in,'' said Mr Laughton Johnston of
SNH.
''We will study mammals, vegatation, red deer numbers, and the ancient
Caledonian pine forest.''
Mr Dick Balharry, of SNH said: ''Management of the Cairngorms has been
failing for decades.
''But the time is now ripe, the money is there, the trees are still
there, and we cannot contemplate the new partnership initiative
failing.''
He added: ''We are not looking to make the Cairngorms some sort of
fantastic nature reserve. There has to be a living for the people in the
area.
''But if the current landowners want estates that they can pass on
with pride to their sons and daughters, then it is essential that we
work together.''

Victim's parents raise civil action for damages in Court of Session
after not proven verdict
THE PARENTS of murdered student Amanda Duffy have begun a civil action
against the man who stood trial for her murder.
Mr Joe Duffy and his wife Kate are suing Mr Francis Auld in the Court
of Session for #50,000 for the ''loss of society'' of their daughter in
an action believed to be unique in Scots Law.
Mrs Duffy explained yesterday: ''Winning the #50,000 is immaterial.
This sum merely reflects the seriousness of the crime.''
The case against Mr Auld was found not proven at the High Court in
Glasgow in November 1992. The decision led to a high-profile public
campaign for scrapping the not proven verdict.
Ms Duffy, 19, was found murdered near a Hamilton town-centre car park
in May, 1992. She had celebrated earlier in the day with friends after
winning an audition for the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in
Glasgow.
The solicitor acting for Mr and Mrs Duffy confirmed yesterday that the
civil action against Mr Auld had begun. However, he warned that it could
be up to 12 months before any hearing would take place.
The Duffys made it known in May last year that they intended to raise
a civil action against Mr Auld, believing it was ''the only way
forward''. The couple expect the case to cost about #30,000, but are
hopeful of raising the money through ''hard earned savings'' and a
public appeal fund set up in Hamilton last October.
Mr Peter Anderson, of Edinburgh-based solicitors Simpson and Marwick,
acting for the couple, confirmed yesterday that a summons had been
lodged with the Court of Session on March 24 intimating the intention to
seek damages of #50,000 against Mr Auld in a civil action.
The solicitor said: ''At the moment I am waiting to hear back from
solicitors representing Mr Auld. If they don't accept the authorisation
within the next day or two I will simply instruct court officers to
deliver the writ directly to him.''
However, it is not a foregone conclusion that Mr Auld will elect to
appear in the civil court, although his failure to challenge the action
could result in him facing a bill for #50,000.
Mr Anderson warned: ''The court action has started but any proceedings
will still be nine or 12 months away, if indeed there is ever to be any
proceedings. It is perfectly possible that Mr Auld will not defend the
case.''
No-one from the Wishaw-based solicitors, Ness, Gallagher, representing
Mr Auld, was available for comment yesterday.
Mrs Duffy, 41, who has two other daughters aged 19 and 24, and a son
aged 18, said yesterday at her Hamilton home that securing the #50,000
was not the object of the civil action against the man cleared of her
daughter's murder.
She pointed out that wrongful convictions can be appealed against but
emphasised that victims and their families who felt there had been a
wrongful acquittal had no such appeal.
Mrs Duffy said the family had not rushed into proceeding with the
civil action. ''This process has been under way for almost two years,''
she said. ''We feel this is the only form of justice we feel we have
left.''
Asked how realistic the chances were of winning the case, Mrs Duffy
said: ''It is the only hope that we have left. It is well recorded that
we are not over enamoured with the Scottish judicial system although we
are still seeking justice through the courts. I retain an open mind on
the matter.''

ROCK stars Van Morrison and Georgie Fame were relaxing after a concert
when trouble flared in their hotel, Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told
yesterday.
Mr Frank Connolly, 39, had been chatting to Fame, aka Clive Powell,
when he was involved in an incident which left him with a broken eye
socket and a fractured skull.
Retired firefighter Connolly told the court he tried to reason with a
man who had been shouting and swearing but was hit in the face and fell
backwards.
Mr Graham Philp, 40, of Kalulu Cottage, Tannadice, Forfar, is on trial
charged with assault and breach of the peace at Caledonian Hotel,
Princes Street, Edinburgh, last May 7.
He denies assaulting Mr Connolly by punching him on the head to his
severe injury and conducting himself in a disorderly manner. Mr Philp
has lodged a special defence of self defence, claiming that he was
assaulted by Mr Connolly.
Georgie Fame, 51, told the jury that he heard a ''thwack'' behind him
and turned round to see a man in a kilt heading up the hotel stairs.
He said he went to bed fairly quickly but added that he was told an
ambulance had been called and that a man lying near the stairs appeared
to be unconscious.
Mr Connolly, of Millhill Street, Dunfermline, said he had been at a
rugby dinner with a friend, Mr Terence O'Connor, and had been at the
same table as Mr Philp, whom he did not know.
In the residents' lounge at the hotel in the early hours, Mr Fame came
across and started chatting to Mr Connolly and Mr O'Connor.
In the corner where Mr Philp and Van Morrison were sitting there was a
lot of shouting and commotion, said Mr Connolly, who added that he heard
the words ''Irish asshole'' being used. He said that, shortly
afterwards, Morrison came across to where he was standing with Mr Fame
and seemed to be concerned about Mr Philp's behaviour.
''Van Morrison was quite apprehensive that Mr Philp was going to come
across and start verbally abusing him again,'' said Mr Connolly.
When Mr Philp did start to come across, Mr Connolly said he tried to
reason with him and calm him down but was assaulted.
He woke up in hospital with what he was told was a ''blow-out''
fracture of his left eye socket and various skull fractures. He told the
jury that he is now deaf in his right ear and has irreparable double
vision in his left eye.
Mr O'Connor, 48, of Old Mill Court, Dunfermline, also an ex-fireman,
told the jury: ''There was a commotion and I saw Mr Connolly lying on
the floor and Mr Philp walking up the stairs.''
Mr O'Connor said Mr Connolly's left eye was ''hanging from its
socket'' and that he had swallowed his tongue. The trial, before Sheriff
James Farrell, continues today.

A STUDY of eating and growth patterns of teenage girls at two Scottish
schools has found no evidence of anorexia nervosa or reasons to suggest
that girls of low weight are at special risk.
More than 100 girls from Boroughmuir and Tynecastle High in Edinburgh
took part in research into the development of female adolescents.
Undertaken by researchers in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Sheffield, the
three-year study examined their development from first to fourth years.
It confirmed previous findings that erratic patterns of eating habits
and skipped meals were common in normal adolescence.
However, the preliminary findings issued yesterday warned that a
good-quality diet was important for normal growth.
It backed up a recent Glasgow study which demonstrated that
socio-cultural influences on dietary choice were important.
The Edinburgh research, which was not carried out in deprived areas of
the city, produced similar findings.
It stated: ''From a nutritional perspective, many of the girls
habitually chose low-quality food.''
Formal findings from the study will be presented in June at a seminar
in the Royal Edinburgh Hospital on teenage nutrition and adolescent
eating disorders.

A NINE-YEAR-OLD boy has been charged with attempted murder following
an alleged assault on a seven-year-old boy.
The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to
hospital suffering from serious head injuries.
He has been detained in the intensive care unit of Ninewells Hospital,
Dundee, where his parents are at his bedside. His condition is described
as stable. It was his seventh birthday on Saturday.
The incident happened on Saturday at around 5pm in a garden between
Pitkerro Road and Cumnock Place, Dundee.
Police have interviewed children who were playing in the area at the
time.
The nine-year-old was taken to Tayside Police HQ and charged on Sunday
night but was allowed to return home.
A report is being sent to the procurator-fiscal.
Inspector Mark Watson, press officer for Tayside police, said tonight:
''We are carrying out a full investigation to establish the
circumstances which led to the boy sustaining his injuries.
''Children who were playing in the area at the time are being
interviewed. Anyone with knowledge of the circumstances of the incident
are requested to contact the police.''
In Scottish law, the age of criminal responsibility is eight years and
over and it is possible for a child of this age to be prosecuted in the
Sheriff Court or High Court of Justiciary but only on the instructions
of the Lord Advocate, Scotland's senior law officer, or at his instance.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

ROYAL aides are paying rents of no more than #202 a week to live in
palace apartments with up to six bedrooms ''in probably the most
sought-after part of London'', a Commons committee was told last night
One Labour MP described the low rents as ''extraordinary''.
The issue surfaced at a Public Accounts Select Committee hearing into
occupied royal palaces in England.
Before the committee was Mr Hayden Phillips, National Heritage
Department Permanent Secretary.
Labour's Mr Alan Williams, MP for Swansea West, long-term campaigner
for greater openness in palace funding, said a report to the committee
by Comptroller and Auditor-General Sir John Bourn showed 11 senior staff
on salaries of between #40,736 and #87,436 were paying between nothing
and 12% of their salary to live in royal palaces.
This meant that the maximum rent being paid was #202a week for
apartments with four or five -- and in one case six -- bedrooms ''in
probably the most sought-after part of London'', Mr Williams said.
He added: ''That is an astonishing figure -- #200 a week for all that
accommodation at our expense.''
Another Labour MP, Mr Mike Hall, for Warrington South, asked where
anyone could rent an apartment in Chelsea for #200 a week.
He added: ''There are two of my colleagues that are actually paying
far more for rented accommodation in Lambeth!''
In earlier exchanges, Mr Williams said that, according to a
parliamentary written answer, #819,000 had been spent on furnishings,
fixtures, fittings, and decorations for four senior members of the Royal
Household since April 1991.
Mr Phillips replied: ''That sum of money was provided to do necessary
basic work on a number of apartments, then to ensure that they were
fitted out for use and in some cases to provide furnishings.''
Mr Williams protested that he had not been given figures going back to
1982 because he had been told that the cost of providing this
information would be available only ''at disproportionate cost''.
He challenged Mr Phillips: ''The #800,000 is the tip of an iceberg --
and you don't want us to see the iceberg, do you?''
In reply, Mr Phillips insisted that neither he nor the Royal Household
''are in the business of trying to avoid giving you readily available
information''.
Meanwhile, the rent-free ''grace-and-favour'' apartments gifted by the
Queen look set to become a royal relic. Only four units are presently
occupied by grace-and-favour pensioners and Buckingham Palace says they
are likely to be the last.
Most of the 285 Royal Household flats and houses are rented by their
occupants at Civil Service rates.
Eight properties are occupied by members of the royal family, 13 by
the Military Knights at Windsor, and 27 by other pensioners with around
20 years' service in the Royal Household.
The remaining 213 self-contained apartments and houses consist of
job-related accommodation which employees vacate when their work with
the Royal Household ends.
Latest figures for January showed that 18 flats and houses were
undergoing refurbishment and two were being used for ''other purposes''.
The Royal Household took over management of the maintenance programme
for the English Occupied Royal Palaces Estate in 1991.
It received a grant-in-aid from the Department of National Heritage of
#20.7m for 1995-96 for the upkeep of the palaces and other property
services.
The Queen has surrendered the revenues of the Crown Estate -- about
#80m each year -- in return for the Government maintaining the palaces.
Since April, 1994 staff and pensioners have been charged rent
amounting to 16.7% of their salaries or pensions -- an arrangement which
is being phased in as employees join the Royal Household or transfer to
a new performance-related pay system.

LIBERAL Democrats yesterday played down apparent backtracking by
Labour over fair representation for women and for different political
parties in a Scottish Parliament.
Launching the agenda for its conference in Perth, the SLD made clear
that the debate over a Scottish Parliament -- including the issues of
gender equality and proportional representation -- would be a keynote.
But its up-beat view of plans to discuss progress on fair
representation in the new Parliament -- arrived at in cross-party
discussions between women -- was thrown into doubt by reportedly hostile
comments by Scottish Labour leaders at the weekend.
The female negotiating group drawn from the two parties had been
moving towards a view that a forum of 145 was appropriate for the new
Parliament, but this had been dashed by comments from Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson, holding the line at 112.
Mr Robertson was not available for comment last night but the general
secretary of the Labour Party in Scotland, Mr Jack McConnell, stressed
that there had been no change of position on the issue, only a
reaffirmation of a negotiating position.
Scottish Liberal Democrat convener Councillor Marilyne Maclaren
expressed her ''disappointment'', however, and made clear that she
thought there had been an intervention which had damaged trust between
the two parties.
A Labour counterpart in negotiations, Ms Rosina McCrae, admitted she
had been disappointed with the tone of the weekend meeting of her
party's executive, but like Councillor Maclaren she promised that the
two sides would continue to talk to each other.
Speaking at yesterday's Liberal Democrat press conference in place of
Scottish party leader Jim Wallace, who was in Orkney with influenza, Mr
Menzies Campbell, MP, also tried to play down talk of a split with
Labour.
However, he said: ''I don't think we could carry 112 through our
conference. If the Labour Party adopt that figure, then that will fail
to give effect to gender balance and proportional representation and
jeopardise the principles agreed between us and them.''
Many Liberal Democrats oppose any moves towards gender balance that
could be deemed coercive. Labour women, on the other hand, are so
strongly for gender parity that they would trade a degree of party
political proportional representation which alarms their leadership..

EXCLUSIVE By LYNNE ROBERTSON
UNIONS at the offices of the Criminal Injuries Compen-sation Board in
Glasgow are threatening to call in Health and Safety investigators over
an unidentified ''illness''.
Staff at the offices are blaming bacteria in the heating and
ventilation system at their new Glasgow offices, in Tay House, Bath
Street, for the illness, which they say causes headaches, nausea, and
facial cold sores in extreme cases.
At least seven members of the 300-strong workforce, who deal with
claims from those who are injured or fall sick as a result of crime, are
thought to have been affected.
The Civil and Public Servants' Association, which represents many of
the staff, said yesterday it was understood one air-quality test had
already taken place at the office but that senior staff had been unhappy
with the results.
Nothing in the report over the tests had suggested there was a problem
with the heating system.
A second investigation into air quality will now be called for but, if
the findings are inconclusive, the Health and Safety Executive will be
asked to investigate, said the union.
CPSA spokeswoman Claire Docherty said there had been temperature
problems since the board had moved into the premises in February.
She said: ''The heating system was designed for an open-plan building
but, after it was refurbished, it was partitioned off and the
temperatures have been more difficult to maintain.
''There has been a series of problems but the illnesses have come to
light only in the last couple of months.''
At least two people are thought to have been affected severely by
suffering cold sores and a further five are reported to have suffered
headaches and nausea.
Ms Docherty pledged the unions would take every step to maintain staff
health.
''The health of our members is of paramount importance,'' she said.
A spokesman for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board said they
were not in a position to comment and directed inquiries to Property
Holdings, who sub-let the building to the CICB.
No-one was available for comment at the Edinburgh office of the
company.

THE King of Hearts is a title which Mr Eric Hunter, 48, can justly
claim. He is believed to be the only person alive who has had four
hearts.
His own heart began failing when he was in his 20s and he has had
three transplant operations.
Mr Hunter, a father of two and a grandfather, is doing fine at his
home in Cottingley Crescent, Leeds, eight years after his last
transplant.
He says he treats every day as a bonus and lives for his family and
two grandchildren -- Emily, who is two-and-a-half, and Oliver, who is 14
months old.
Mr Hunter was having health problems in his late 20s and doctors
recommended a heart transplant, carried out at Leeds General Infirmary
in March 1981 by Sir Terence English. He was only the 18th such patient
in Britain.
However, his second heart was diseased and three years later he was
back on the operating table. More problems meant a third operation in
January 1987.
He enjoys a happy family life with wife, Margaret, 48, and two
daughters Julie, 29, a coronary care nurse at Leeds General Infirmary,
and Dawn, 25, who has her own dressmaking business.

LABOUR last night attempted to reopen the controversy over Junior
Minister Jonathan Aitken's links with Middle Eastern arms dealers.
Opposition Trade and Industry spokesman Brian Wilson said he would be
seeking further clarification of the relationship. He claimed that a
Commons written answer appeared to contradict an earlier statement by
the Treasury Chief Secretary.
The reply from Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman, Mr Wilson
claims, suggests that Mr Aitken had three official meetings with
Lebanese arms broker Fouad Makhzoumi during 1993.
Two were said to have taken place over dinner at the Dorchester Hotel
in London, and one at Ministry of Defence headquarters in Whitehall.
In his public statement two weeks ago, Mr Aitken said he was
approached in late 1992 by the Makhzoumi brothers (Fouad and Ziad), whom
he described as ''long-standing personal friends and banking clients of
mine''.
They had asked about defence sales possibilities in the Lebanon, and
Mr Aitken, then the Minister responsible for defence exports, said he
had turned the matter over to MoD officials.
He claimed he had acted with ''scrupulous propriety by thereafter not
participating directly in negotiations with the Makhzoumis on this
matter''.
However, Mr Wilson last night alleged that Mr Freeman's written answer
seemed to contradict a key element of Mr Aitken's defence.
Mr Wilson said: ''He gave the impression that he bowed out of official
contact with the Makhzoumis soon after being approach by them. Now we
know that he was still meeting them, at the MoD itself, almost a year
later. Why?''
The Labour spokesman also highlighted another section of Mr Freeman's
answer, in which he said that ''other meetings with the Makhzoumi
brothers . . . not on MoD business . . . are a matter for Mr Aitken''.

Exclusive
By IAIN WILSON Chief Reporter and ALF YOUNG Economics Editor
AN OUTSPOKEN attack on Government plans to merge Scottish Nuclear with
its English counterpart was launched last night by Sir Donald Miller,
former chairman of ScottishPower.
Sir Donald, in joining the growing opposition to such a merger,
insisted it would be akin to ''a breach of faith'' by the Government --
and another assault on Scottish institutions by ''a Whitehall
bureaucracy and London-based advisers insensitive to opinion north of
the Border''.
He also warned of a further collapse in Conservative support in
Scotland should the Government treat the electorate with ''such
contempt'' and proceed with a merger.
Sir Donald, who headed the electricity industry both before and after
its transfer to the private sector, makes his charges in a letter
published today in The Herald.
His most damning criticism is that, when chairman of ScottishPower, he
had agreed with then Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind that:
* It was no longer practicable to keep Scottish nuclear stations
within the Scottish electricity privatisation, following the decision to
withdraw them from similar sell-offs in England and Wales, and:
* That agreement was on the clear understanding that Scottish nuclear
stations would remain a separate Scottish entity, with Scottish
electricity consumers continuing to receive the benefits of the nuclear
plants' good performance through exclusive sales contracts with
ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric.
Although the Cabinet is poised to take a decision this Thursday to
merge Scottish Nuclear and the larger Nuclear Electric under a single
holding company which would then be privatised, it emerged last night
that Scottish Nuclear's chairman, Mr James Hann, has not yet been
consulted on that solution.
In a letter to staff yesterday, Mr Hann told them: ''On an issue of
this importance we really do want our staff to receive reliable
information from us. The trouble is we ourselves do not know exactly
what is going on in Whitehall or the Scottish Office.''
Later he told The Herald: ''At my request I met senior civil servants
in the Scottish Office this morning. But they could tell me nothing. I
was told Ministers are still consulting but I have not been consulted on
the holding company option.
''I have been promised a meeting with the Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
this week. But so far we have not met. To my knowledge, I don't think
John Collier, my opposite number at Nuclear Electric, has been consulted
either.''
Sir Donald, who stressed the agreement with Mr Rifkind was honoured at
the time, argued a merger of Scottish and English plants to facilitate
flotation in a year's time would be akin to a breach of faith by the
present Government.
He said Scots should recognise such a merger for what it is -- yet a
further assault on Scottish institutions. He also warned Scots to expect
''the usual attempts at being bought off by the now ritual sops such as
offers of a semi-autonomous subsidiary company, local management, and
perhaps even a national head office.
Sir Donald called on Mr Rifkind, and his successor, Mr Lang, to lose
no opportunity to remind Cabinet colleages of all factors in the
agreement.
In an exclusive interview last night, he explained why he took pen to
paper publicly to condemn the Government. It is expected to approve the
merger, unless the increasing chorus of cross-party opposition forces a
U-turn on Thursday. This opposition claims 500 Scottish jobs are
threatened, and has also raised the spectre of nuclear safety if the
industry was privatised.
Sir Donald, chairman of ScottishPower and its predecessor from 1982 to
1992, said he did not want to see any erosion of Scottish control of its
energy supply systems, which he regarded as among the world's best.
He said: ''I am old enough to remember the structure before the
Scottish industry was set up in the fifties. It was not good for
Scotland, and did not perform as well as the Scottish one has. A merger
would be a backwards move.
''I spent 25 years in the industry, and do not want to see Scottish
control lost or it merged into some shapeless national organisation. The
Scottish industry has been enormously successful, and should be
maintained.''
Sir Donald said alternatives have more to offer, both for the
Government and Scotland. He suggested Scottish Nuclear could be sold as
a separate company or to a consortium of the two Scottish electricity
companies.
Such solutions would avoid creating a monolithic structure which the
Government had gone to such lengths to avoid in recent privatisations,
and keep a successful Scottish operation in Scottish hands.
His comments will prove a fillip to those fighting against proposals
to surrender Scottish Nuclear to English control, including Scottish
Tory MPs Phil Gallie and Allan Stewart, a former Scottish Office
Minister.
However, Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Minister for Industry, gave little
away yesterday when pressed on the privatisation plans. He acknowledged
the Scottish Secretary will take the ''Scottish dimension'' into
account, but stressed the Cabinet also has to look at the future of the
UK nuclear industry as a whole.
Mr Kynoch said: ''I know that the Secretary of State is very aware of
the success of Scottish Nuclear in Scotland. I am sure he is doing
everying possible to ensure the future of Scottish nuclear as seen in
the interests of Scotland and the UK. . .
''I am sure the Scottish dimension and success of Scottish Nuclear in
Scotland will be borne in mind when the Scottish Secretary and
colleagues have to look at the future of the UK nuclear industry of
which Scottish Nuclear has an important part.''
Today, Scottish Nuclear will release its financial results for the
past year -- apparently against the wishes of the Scottish Office. These
are expected to show a dazzling improvement in performance, thanks to
output well ahead of plan, further cost savings and efficiencies, and
the first impact of the new reprocessing deal with British Nuclear
Fuels.
The company was budgeting to reduce the generating cost per unit to
2.5p but all the indications are that it has managed to get down to a
figure of 2.21p. The impact on profits (#72m in 1993/94) could be
dramatic. They may have doubled.
Against that background the political row over Scottish Nuclear's fate
can only intensify. The single holding company option now being
considered by Ministers is more complex than a straight takeover of the
Scottish business by Nuclear Electric and appears to have been pushed to
the fore because nuclear inspectors demanded more time than was
available under the Government's tight sale deadline to approve the
operating and discharge licence transfers necessary under any
alternative sale scenario.
Ministers are believed to be considering a solution whereby some of
the new holding company's headquarters functions will be located in
Scotland. But, after Guinness/Distillers, BP/Britoil and the TSB saga,
Scottish opinion will take some convincing that that is not simply a
rerun of the broken promises of the past.
East Kilbride Labour MP Adam Ingram said he was encouraged by the
groundswell of support for Scottish Nuclear to remain Scottish. He
pledged to work with parliamentary colleagues to ensure the Government
was ''left in no uncertain terms about our strong feelings on this
matter''.
Mr Ingram said a merged headquarters in Scotland would not be
satisfactory. He said Scottish Nuclear must stay in the public sector
and receive a long-term commitment to its future as a separate,
independent nuclear generating company.
SNP energy spokesman Nicole Sturgeon described the merger proposal as
sheer madness. If approved, the Conservative Party's already tenuous
position in Scotland would be compounded and it would also show that the
City of London was able to exercise more say over Scotland's future than
its people.
Staff from Hunterston and Torness joined colleagues at East Kilbride
yesterday to draw up battle plans.
They said managers had ordered them to stay silent until a Government
announcement, but Unison shop steward Bill Dewar voiced their fears:
''This won't be an amalgamation. It will be a takeover, and when that
happens no-one believes the new private company will want to have two
headquarters -- one in Scotland, one in England. There are real fears
for our jobs.''

THE stand-off between the Government and Sinn Fein was broken last
night with announcements from both sides that there are to be peace
process talks at ministerial level. They are expected to start next week
after a deal was put together by London and Dublin.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland Minister in charge of
negotiations, and Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein negotiator, are to
meet soon. Mr Ancram and the Prime Minister have persuaded Sinn Fein to
end their attempt to link serious talks about handing over weapons with
''demilitarisation''.
Sinn Fein has been given the right to discuss the removal of the
British Army from Ulster as part of these talks. Both sides seemed
satisified last night that the log jam is over.
It marks the beginning of the end of the exclusion of Sinn Fein from
serious discussions about a political compromise. The deal was agreed
yesterday after the Irish Premier Mr John Bruton was heavily involved in
talks with Mr Major and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader.
Last night, Mr Bruton expressed his pleasure at the development: ''The
position now is that the requirements of the British Government and of
Sinn Fein in terms of issues to be discussed will both be met in an
early meeting at ministerial level.''
He said that a ''lot of effort by a lot of people'' had broken the
impasse. President Clinton is also said to have been involved in putting
pressure on Mr Adams following his feting by the American Government.
Mr Bruton said: ''The important point to make is that there were very
intensive and detailed discussions, almost on a daily basis, going on
with a view to breaking this impasse. A lot of issues were covered in
those exchanges that will now be much easier to deal with in the talks
themselves. So it was not lost time, just good preparation.''
Mr McGuinness said last night that Sinn Fein would be in contact with
the British Government immediately to arrange a meeting with Mr Ancram.
''I think everybody would like to see this expedited as it is essential
that we move on as quickly as possible towards all-party peace talks
which are the next stage of this process.''
He had been trying to force the British Government to approach these
talks linking ''demilitarisation'' to serious discussion about how the
IRA are going to start handing over their arsenal.
President Clinton and Mr Bruton have assisted in convincing Sinn Fein
that it is not possible to link illegal weapons and forces with the
legal deployment of the British Army in Ulster.
Mr Ancram said at Stormont last night that the Government had
emphasised to Sinn Fein that he would want to discuss ways that IRA arms
could be decommissioned and how this could be verified. He insists that
this is the first item on the agenda. However, Mr McGuinness can raise
any other issues -- demilitarisation included -- at a later stage.
Mr Ancram said: ''We have informed Sinn Fein that following our
communications we now believe there is a basis on which Ministers can
become involved in exploratory dialogue.''
The essential condition for this breakthrough he described as Sinn
Fein's being ''prepared to discuss everything constructively and
seriously, including the decommissioning of arms which we would discuss
separately and first''.
Democratic Unionist party leader Ian Paisley condemned the decision on
the grounds that the Government had stated it would not talk to Sinn
Fein until decommissioning had been resolved.

HOPE was fading last night for two divers reported missing while
exploring the hull of a sunken Second World War ammunition supply ship
off the coast of Argyll.
An air and sea search was launched around midday yesterday after the
pair failed to return from a group dive on the SS Breda, which lies 60ft
below the surface in Ardmucknish Bay, north of Oban.
It was feared the two men, Mr David Waterhouse, 29, of Deeside, Clwyd,
and Mr David Waver, 26, of Mercwys, by Mold, both North Wales, had
become trapped in one of the Breda's holds but an examination of the
vessel by local divers found no trace of them, Oban coastguard said last
night.
Coastguard officers scrambled a Royal Navy Sea King rescue helicopter
from Prestwick and the Oban lifeboat as the alarm was raised. Several
other diving boats went to help.
The divers were staying at Tralee Bay Holiday Park. Site owner Pauline
Shellcock said: ''The sad thing about it is that they should have gone
home on Sunday but they elected to stay another night because they were
having such a good time.
''There were six in the party and three went home this morning and the
others decided to have a final dive.''
The Breda is a popular site for divers. Recently, parts of the ship
became unstable and Oban police said diving parties had been warned of
the danger.

THE Prime Minister ended the exile of nine Tory rebels last night on a
take it or leave it basis. Eight are expected to accept the restoration
of the Whip to end Tory disunity.
Mr Major sanctioned a two paragraph letter to the rebels after a
meeting at Chequers where his key advisers and Ministers were discussing
how to cope with party problems in the run-up to local elections in
England and Wales.
At 6pm, the nine rebels received individual letters from Chief Whip
Richard Ryder stating: ''The Whip is restored to you -- let me know if
you do not want to accept it.''
The letters arrived at the House of Commons too late for the rebels'
meeting at 4.30pm, but by this morning eight of them are expected to
announce that their six month period off the Whip is over.
The eight were expelled last November for defying the Government in a
confidence vote on the European budget. They are: Mr Nicholas Budgen
(Wolverhampton SW); Mr Michael Cartiss (Great Yarmouth); Mr Richard
Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills); Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay); Mr
Christopher Gill (Ludlow); Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North); Mr John
Wilkinson (Ruislip Northwood); and Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East).
The ninth rebel, Sir Richard Body, is expected to hang out a little
longer for special treatment from the Chief Whip because he resigned the
Whip in sympathy with the eight.
The Chequers meeting, attended by Mr Major's ''chief of staff'' David
Hunt, party chairman Jeremy Hanley, both Lords and Commons leaders
Viscount Cranborne and Mr Tony Newton, and all the business managers,
was designed to get the Government through the impending disaster of
local government elections in the first week of next month.
The Prime Minister also required a discussion about convincing the
electorate the party is united on the key issues of nuclear
privatisation -- to be discussed in Cabinet on Thursday -- and Europe.
After the disastrous Scottish local elections, Mr Major is concerned
that unity is at least superficially restored before the elections south
of the Border. Key to this was a settlement with the Tory rebels.
Tory chairman, Mr Jeremy Hanley, welcomed the move to restore the
Whip. He said: ''The Prime Minister has acted decisively to reunite the
parliamentary Conservative Party -- just days before a sizeable part of
the Labour Party will show their opposition to their leader.
''The Chief Whip has restored the party Whip and therefore the
position is clear: it is now for those of my colleagues who were elected
as Conservatives, and thanks to the hard work of Conservatives, to
decide whether or not they wish to act as Conservative MPs in future.
''Members of the party up and down the country will expect us,
newly-reunited, to campaign against our common enemy -- socialism.''
However, the opposition parties seized on the news as a sign of the
desperation in Tory ranks in the run-up to the May 4 local elections.
The Liberal Democrats' spokesman on Europe, Mr Charles Kennedy, said:
''This fragile unity at the 11th hour will last until the next vote on
Europe. One thing is certain: John Major needs the Whipless wonders more
than they need him.''
Labour's deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, said: ''This is a pathetic
retreat by a weak Prime Minister who has caved in to a group of people
who hold him in contempt. They have won, he has lost, and he looks
ridiculous.''

<HEADLINE>Drinks ban imposed on Scots Tartan army flies in to a drinks ban in Italy</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE by RON MacKENNA
A BLANKET drinks ban has been imposed on Scots football fans using the
Italian coastal resort of Rimini as a base for tomorrow's European
Championship qualifier in San Marino.
In a case of mistaken identity, Italian authorities have taken the
decision to shut down bars and off-licences all along the Adriatic coast
following newspaper reports headed ''The hooligans are coming''.
Italian daily newspaper Il Resto De Carlino carried the story of the
''hooligan invasion'' on the front page of its Romagna supplement
yesterday. It warns: ''These are hooligans who don't joke when it comes
to bottles or fists''.
It claimed the order for ''four days of sobriety on the coast'' was
made by Raffaele Pisasale, the Prefect of Forli. Mr Pisasale is quoted
as stating ''it was worthwhile taking avoidance measures''.
The alcohol ban covers an area of approximately 35 square miles from
the town of Casenetico to Cattolica.
No such ban covers the republic of San Marino. Alcohol controls have
been limited to stopping bottles being taken into the stadium and
closing the stadium bar during the game.
Rimini was extensively damaged during the 1990 World Cup by visiting
English football supporters. More than 1000 Scots fans are expected to
stay in and around the town before the game in nearby San Marino.
Regional officials have imposed a by-law banning the sale of alcohol
between the hours of 8pm and 7am for the three days surrounding the
match. However, last night as it came into force, a number of bars and
restaurants seemed to be ignoring it.
Mr Nadi Fiore, a restaurant manager, said he had seen newspaper
reports of the ban, but had not been officially notified of it.
''I will continue selling alcohol because nobody has told me directly
to do otherwise,'' he added. Mr Fiore said the ban was a reaction to the
damage caused during the World Cup. ''Rimini was badly damaged, a few
parks were torn up and things like that.
''People here assume that if you speak English you are English. They
do not appreciate the difference between the Scots and English.''
Glasgow-born translator Mr Mike Clarke, who lives in Rimini, said he
was extremely annoyed that Scots supporters, known for their good
behaviour abroad, were being penalised for the behaviour of English
fans.
''There's no doubt the Scots have been desribed as hooligans because
of the way the English supporters behaved,'' he said.
Mr Clarke said that Scots fans had started arriving in Rimini last
night but that there was no sign of any trouble.
