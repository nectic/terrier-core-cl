<HEADLINE>Explosions on Richter scale Blasts at Beaufort's war dump</HEADLINE>

THERE have been nine unexplained explosions, some as strong as a small
earthquake, around the controversial munitions dump at Beaufort's Dyke off the
Scottish coast.
The blasts were recorded by scientists in Edinburgh.
A local Labour MP said it ``raises terrifying questions'' and warned of
``potential catastrophe''.
The Second World War munitions dump is thought to contain more than a million
tons of bombs, shells, and gas canisters, and the explosions took place south
of a new pipeline being built by British Gas between Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
The head of the team of scientists, Dr Chris Browitt, said the dumped munitions
could have caused the underwater blasts.
The earthquake experts are now involved in talks with the Scottish Office about
establishing a system for monitoring underwater activity in the area.
Scientists at the British Geological Survey centre in Edinburgh said they hoped
this could help them discover the cause of the explosions recorded in the past
year around the 263-fathom trench, six miles off the Galloway coast.
Some of the underwater blasts could have reached up to 2.5 on the Richter
Scale, the equivalent of a small earthquake, scientists said.
The BGS is understood to be bidding for Scottish Office cash which would be
used to fund comprehensive research into the cause of the explosions.
The latest development follows a long standing row over the Second World War
dump. The laying of the gas pipeline near the site has attracted fierce
criticism. Opponents of the project claim the excavation of the seabed
disturbed the dump, sending 4000 flares and incendiary devices to the surface
and on to Scottish and Irish beaches.
In October, dangerous canisters were washed up on the south-west coast burning
a four-year-old boy who picked them up.
Last month, the Scottish Office agreed to commission an emergency survey of the
dump ``to allay public fears''.
Dr Browitt, director of BGS Scotland, said although it was possible the
munitions could have caused the blasts, there were several other possible
explanations, such as Royal Navy manoeuvres, civil engineering work, or
wreck-clearing operations.
He said: ``We should be looking at this in greater detail and we are currently
talking to the Scottish Office about proposals to this effect.''
The BGS has four monitoring stations in the Irish Sea. Dr Browitt said
Admiralty charts were altered in 1968 to provide a warning of the possible
dangers after two ships were rocked by explosions near the trench.
He explained that there were several hundred underwater explosions recorded
around the British coast throughout the year: at least 100 of those would be in
Scottish waters, with some in the Beaufort's Dyke area.
However, he said further investigations could detect many more explosions.
Mr George Foulkes, the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley MP, has campaigned
against the laying of the pipeline by British Gas. He said fisherman had also
reported explosions over the last 40 years.
He added: ``Reports of up to 10 explosions in the last year raises terrifying
questions. If a pipeline is laid in an area where there have been explosions it
could have a catastrophic effect. This underlines the importance of carrying
out a detailed survey.''
He said ``an explosion in that area would be absolutely disastrous. We must
have an immediate investigation into the intensity and every aspect of these
explosions.
``And what with the chemicals and nerve gas supposed also to be in the area,
any dislodgement could mean the possibility of alien matter getting into the
fish and the food chain. It is an absolute disaster of unbelievable proportions
waiting to happen.''
He said Scottish Office Ministers had promised to look at the possibility of
conducting an enhanced survey. He welcomed the news that BGS might be involved
in research work. Mr Foulkes added: ``There should be a moratorium on
commercial activity until we get a full explanation as to the cause of the
explosions.''
A Scottish Office spokesman confirmed that talks were taking place.
The official survey report from the Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen is due to be
published on January 8. Gas is due to start flowing through the pipeline by
October next year.

PEOPLE are in a rush to get away to the sun over Christmas and New Year,
according to travel agents.
Last-minute bookings for the festive period have been taken, mainly for the
Canary Islands.
Portugal is also a favourite, according to tourist group Frutin Travel, whose
holidays are on offer at #130 for seven nights in Portugal with return flights
included.
A spokesman for the company said that apartment holidays at #350 including
flights, on a week-long basis, were being taken at late notice.
He added: ``We have also noted that the Canaries is a popular choice for the
New Year, because of its climate.''
A.T Mays said that it too was experiencing heavy bookings over the New Year
period, with the Canaries, Cyprus, Florida, and winter sports resorts in Europe
the main choices.
Thomson said it would be taking about 100,000 people away, many going to far
away spots such as Barbados and the Indian Ocean.
British Midland airline, which has recently opened new routes in Europe,
confirmed that it was taking additional bookings.
Going Places estimates that more than 500,000 Britons will be heading abroad
over the festive period.
British Airways is expected to take 250,000 people overseas. While operating no
domestic flights on Christmas Day, it will operate 24 long-haul flights from
Heathrow, along with 11 short-haul flights. Included in its menu are 1300
turkeys.
Glasgow and Edinburgh airports said yesterday that while demand was high, no
additional flights were scheduled because bookings in general had been made
earlier this year.
A spokeswoman at Glasgow airport said: ``We are busy, and Tenerife is proving
very popular this year because of its climate.''
Direct Holidays, which recently opened a new office in Edinburgh, said it was
enjoying heavy bookings, particularly to the Canaries.
It was quoting self-catering prices for a week, including return flights, at
#239, #319 for a fortnight, and #369 on a half-board basis in a four-star hotel.

THE council workers' union, Unison, yesterday welcomed an internal inquiry into
allegations of bullying and harassment within Scotland's second biggest
district council.
Preliminary findings are expected to be presented to the chief executive of
Edinburgh District Council, Mr William Blyth, next month.
Senior Unison official John Ross said the large-scale allegations of bullying,
harassment, and victimisation had come from nine members of staff and four
former workers within the temporary accommodation section of the authority's
housing department.
``The situation was first raised with us a year ago and we asked for an inquiry
at that time. It appears to have been a situation which has arisen over a
number of years, but it is only now that the staff have said enough is
enough,'' he said.
Mr Ross said he could not comment on whether the complaints targeted certain
individuals within the department, but welcomed the appointment of the
council's director of planning, Mr Graham Duncan, as head of the investigation.
Edinburgh District Council yesterday confirmed it had launched an investigation
into the allegations.
Mr Blyth said: ``I have called for an investigation into allegations made by
Unison on behalf of employees and ex-employees in the temporary accommodation
section of the housing department. The council will not be saying anything
futher until the investigation is complete.''

THE festive lights end at Argyle Street, but spotlit by the unaccustomed angle
of the winter sun, the Saltmarket glitters. Children coax a tune from an old
toy piano. Parents pick over the second hand clothes, plates, and pictures that
once were someone's pride and joy, and bug-eyed soft toys that fell off a
lorry. ``My God, it's freezin,'' screech the traders, cheerful because the
buying frenzy has seeped down to Paddy's Market at last.
Purple decorations dangle in a window in the High Court building. Next door in
Hope House, equally garish tinsel spirals round the pillars of the Oasis day
room. The only other colour among the grubby walls and stacking chairs of the
Salvation Army hostel is in the language of the group clustered round the pool
table.
``They do their best to make it cheerful,'' says John, in quiet gratitude. If
you met him spinning out his Invalidity Benefit in the cafes or pubs around the
Clyde, you'd take him for a generation older than his 49 years. He's been in
the hostel for three weeks since he came out of hospital, after a stroke, but
this is his second time round this particular route. He split up with his wife
two years ago as a result of both his and her problem with alcohol. She's now a
member of Alcoholics Anonymous, but he's never been one for meetings.
He visits fairly regularly, taking his washing in a plastic bag, but he's not
sure whether he's up to a family Christmas. With six children, it used to be a
great occasion when they were small. ``I was working so it wisnae a problem to
buy presents, but I feel sorry for young folk with two or three kids now with
all this unemployment.
``To tell the truth, I've no been feeling too good,'' he says. It seems he will
be just as likely to stay in Clyde Street to share the Hope House turkey.
About half the 120 residents will be there for Christmas dinner, unable or
unwilling to go to relatives. Nora Morrison will be among them as she has been
for the last dozen years. At 81 she has no family now except for a few cousins
- ``And what would would cousins ever do for you?''
She'll be singing the old carols on Christmas morning in Hope House, the
Salvation Army hostel in Glasgow. She was a fine singer in her youth on Lewis
and the service every morning is one her the chief joys of her life. A large
capable woman, whose appearance belies her age, she's one of the few elderly
people to live in the hostel as more people are channelled to independent
living. It is partly because she's used to institutional living in hotels and
hospitals, but more because she is frightened to live on her own in a big city,
that she has made a hostel for the homeless her home.
``I had a flat, but Glasgow people can be awful clannish. They wouldn't knock
on the door, just push a card underneath at Christmas. I'll never forget
that,'' she says, unable still to fathom a way of life which does not include
visiting and helping your neighbours.
With the guileless art of the Celtic storyteller, she recalls leaving home at
17 to follow the herring as the country girls did, though the town girls from
Stornoway wouldn't consider it. Her job was to pack as quick as lightning,
despite frozen fingers, the fish her friends had gutted in Shetland, Mallaig,
North Shields, Hull, Lowestoft, or Yarmouth. An only child, Nora was born two
weeks after her father was killed in the First World War and was very close to
her mother, returning home at every opportunity.
During the Second World War she worked in the munitions factory at Bishopton
and in an aircraft factory in Birmingham. She was married briefly, but with no
possibility of a house of their own, there was conflict between whose parents
they would live with and she returned to her mother. Nora describes her as a
very godly person. ``The woman next door to us was married to a fisherman and
when there were no fish, they didn't have much money. Many's the time I've seen
my mother go to the van and buy a bag of groceries for her. She had a heart of
gold.''
After her mother's death, Nora found domestic work in a hotel then in hospitals
in the South of England, returning to Scotland for her retirement. ``I accepted
a flat in Castlemilk, but it was next to the lift in a multi-storey block and I
was so worried about someone breaking down the door that I was sitting up until
five in the morning. I have my room here where I can go to have a rest or write
a letter. I come down to watch the television, but it can get very noisy if
there are a lot of young people and I had money taken out of my handbag once
when I dozed off. There are some terrible people about. You could not make
friends with them. But it is very well run and Major Ward and his wife won't
take any nonsense. As well as paying for my bed, I pay #14 a week for my meals
in advance so I know I'll always get my food and then I save up to buy soap and
stockings and the things you need.
``We have a fine Christmas. It's not something we bothered with at home; that
was more New Year.'' Nora was heading south to find work when the former
barracks opened its doors to the homeless 30 years ago. Legislation and housing
benefit has changed much since then, but not the need of those who knock on the
door and ask for shelter.

TV EXECUTIVES have developed a hi-tech strategy to increase even further - as
if that were possible - the excitement of darts.
For it is now possible for viewer to watch the game from an armpit level.
Sky Sports is pioneering the ``chest cam'' during the forthcoming televised WDC
World Darts Championship staged in Purfleet, Essex.
Tiny but still visible cameras will be attached to the clothing of players such
as Jocky Wilson and Eric Bristow.
The World Darts Council, a breakaway from the British Darts Organisation and
now holding its third world championship on Sky, is known for its showmanship.
Commentator Sid Waddell insisted the new camera angle would shed light on
serious aspects of dart play. He said this is a good idea because it shows how
much control the players have over the arc of flight.
The commentator did not think the cameras would impede the players. ``Some of
'em wear about three pounds in gold jewellery. If you hid a camera in that lot,
you would never notice it.''

MEMBERS of the royal family were gathering for Christmas at Sandringham last
night, still waiting to hear whether the Princess of Wales will consent to a
``quickie'' divorce.
The princess is taking time to consider her response to the Queen's call for an
early divorce to end the 14-year marriage.
She turned down an invitation to spend Christmas at Sandringham and will be
away from Prince William, 13, and Prince Harry, 11, who will be at the Norfolk
estate with their father.
There is a belief she will agree to an early divorce, but could wait until the
new year before announcing her decision.
Instead of being with her children on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, as
originally planned, she is expected to fly abroad for a holiday, possibly
skiing in the US, at Vail, Colorado.
She could also spend some time, probably in London, visiting the homeless and
other disadvantaged people as part of her ``queen of hearts'' charity work.
Whatever her decision on divorce, she will wish to obtain a deal which
guarantees her status, her position within the royal family and a high-profile
role as a goodwill ambassador before she gives her consent, according to one
newspaper report.
She is said to be appalled by the leaking of the Queen's call for a swift end
to her 14-year marriage.
She blames the disclosure on her husband's camp, according to the Daily Mail
report which claims she has asked her friends: ``How could they do this at
Christmas?''
In her Panorama interview, the princess said she was against a divorce, but
wanted to hear her husband's views.
Now, following the Queen's call, which has the backing of
the Prime Minister and Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles has let his wife know
he believes it is for the best.
Charles has acted to end speculation about his future and remove possible
objections to his becoming king by making it known he would not remarry after a
divorce.
The response puts to an end mounting speculation that the heir to the throne
might marry divorcee Camilla Parker Bowles.
Meanwhile, senior royals at Sandringham with the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh
were expected to include the Queen Mother, convalescing after her recent hip
replacement operation, Princess Margaret, her daughter Lady Sarah Chatto and
artist husband Daniel, and Margaret's son Viscount Linley and his wife
Viscountess Serena.
The Princess Royal is expected with her husband Commander Timothy Laurence and
children Peter Phillips, 18, and Zara Phillips, 14.
The Duke of York will stay with the rest of the family at Sandringham House
while his estranged wife, the duchess, will be at Wood Farm, nearby on the
estate, with daughters Princess Beatrice, seven, and Princess Eugenie, five.
The young princesses usually open their presents with their cousins at the
``Big House'', in Hanoverian tradition, on Christmas Eve.
In the past, the Queen has called in at Wood Farm for tea with the duchess.
Prince Edward is also expected at Sandringham but it is thought unlikely he
will be joined by girlfriend Sophie Rhys-Jones until after Christmas.
Speculation continues to mount that Edward and Sophie will announce their
engagement early in the new year.

Oslo, Friday
FIFTY researchers formed a circle around the South Pole and cheered Norwegian
adventurer Borge Ousland as he dragged his sled the last yards of his third
polar skiing record.
The 45-day, 838 miles trek made Ousland the first person to ski alone and
unaided to both Poles.
Last year, he set the solo record for the North Pole, and in 1990 he and
another Norwegian were the first team make that trek with no help. Ousland has
also skied across Greenland.
``He got a fantastic reception at the South Pole,'' Ousland's spokesman, Hans
Christian Erlandsen, said after speaking to the skier by short-wave radio.
A doctor at the Scott-Amundsen Base examined Ousland and pronounced him fit,
except for some minor frost bite.
Ousland's trip, however, was only half over. He plans to ski all the way across
the frozen continent, becoming the only person to do that also.
Ousland and British adventurer Roger Mear, 45, both set off from Berkner Island
in the Weddell Sea in early November on separate efforts to become the first to
make the solo crossing. Mear gave up and was rescued on December 17.
On his return, Mear blamed the wrong type of snow.
His high-tech sled sank into snowdrifts and caused so much delay he radioed for
help after 41 days on the ice cap.
The 45-year-old Derbyshire explorer admitted the sled, which carried his
supplies for the 100-day walk across the sub-continent, had not been tested in
Antarctic conditions.
His defeat ended a race reminiscent of the first Norwegian-British showdown at
the South Pole in 1911, when Norwegian Roald Amundsen beat Briton Captain
Robert Scott in a race to conquer Antarctica. Scott and four team-mates died on
their way back.
Ousland will probably rest for a couple of days, before starting the 50-day
trek to the American McMurdo base on the other side of Antarctica.
``I don't think he'll say no to a good Christmas dinner at the Pole if he's
invited to the base,'' Erlandsen said.-AP.

Afghans deny
bombing link
PESHAWAR: The Afghan government denied yesterday that it had any responsibility
for a car bomb that killed 36 people and wounded more than 100 in the
northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar. Official Kabul radio said some
Pakistani officials had blamed the Afghan government for Thursday's blast in a
busy shopping street.
Islamabad and Kabul have been on frosty terms since the Pakistani embassy in
the Afghan capital was sacked in September by protesters accusing Pakistan of
supporting the rebel Taleban militia. Islamabad denies the charge.
Fight for life
ATHENS; Doctors fighting to save ailing Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
said yesterday he was fending off a new secondary infection but was still in
critical condition. ``In the last six hours the infection seems to be
controlled by antibiotics. His breathing is supported periodically by a
respirator. His heart has not been affected,'' the latest medical bulletin
said.
Kabul attacks
ISLAMABAD: The opposition Islamic Taleban militia fired 23 rockets at Kabul
overnight and yesterday, killing five people and wounding 22,
government-controlled Kabul radio reported. The radio, monitored in Islamabad,
said at least 12 rockets landed in Kabul on Thursday night, killing five people
and wounding 18, and a salvo of 11 rockets yesterday wounded four people.
Several shops and houses were destroyed.
Banda claim
BLANTYRE: A judge said yesterday there was no evidence showing that former
Malawian president Kamuzu Banda ordered the killing of four politicians in
1983. ``Although Banda had unlimited authority and power, there is no evidence
adduced in court to suggest that he ordered the killing,'' Judge Mackson
Mkandawire told the court and jurors during a summary of the case.
US quake
SAN FRANCISCO: A 4.9 magnitude earthquake rattled the Tahoe Valley area along
the northern California-Nevada border early yesterday, but officials said the
tremor caused no damages or injuries. The tremor struck at about 1 am and was
felt from Sacramento, California, to Yosemite National Park. It was centred
about 25 miles southwest of Yerington, Nevada, and about seen miles north
northwest of Markleeville, California, in the Tahoe Valley area along the
California-Nevada border.
Burundi fears
GENEVA: Gunmen are killing at will in Burundi, dragging the country into a
``genocidal trend'', a United Nations human rights investigator said yesterday.
Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, a Brazilian law professor who serves as special
investigator, warned that the Burundi ethnic crisis might explode and lead to a
mass exodus of Rwandan refugees.

A MAN charged with two murders after a fire at a hotel in Aviemore has been
released from prison, and the case against him has been continued.
In the meantime it was announced yesterday a fatal accident inquiry into the
New Year's Day blaze at the Four Seasons Hotel will go ahead on April 16 at
Inverness Sheriff Court.
After investigations police arrested 21-year-old Alan Moffat, of Drumpellier
Street, Blackhill, Glasgow, in late August and charged him with the murder of
fire victims Graham Strachan, 64, a Scott Lithgow director from Strathblane,
Stirlingshire, and Leeds woman Patricia Shaw, 55.
Mr Moffat was remanded to the Inverness's Porterfield Prison to await trial.
However, since the Crown Office was allowed to keep him in custody for no more
than 110 days before bringing the case to court, prosecuters ordered his
release on November 8.
With Mr Moffat at liberty, the Crown has a year from his original court
appearance to bring the case to trial rather than 110 days.
The four star Stakis-owned hotel was reopened at the beginning of August.
Mr Peter Watson, of Glasgow solicitors Levy and MacRae, who is representing the
families of the two victims, said: ``We are very pleased that a fatal accident
inquiry is finally being held. It has been a very difficult time for the
families.
``We will be expecting to hear a full explanation of the circumstances
surrounding the fire.''

<HEADLINE>Belfast killings raise fears that terrorist squads remain active Anger at refusal to free IRA men</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974749707</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TENSION increased between Sinn Fein and the Irish Government last night after
the Cabinet decided not to free nine IRA prisoners in time for Christmas.
The decision was made in the light of killings in Belfast this week linked to
the IRA, and a report that police had uncovered a plot by active service units
to stage a series of raids on cash shipments in-transit.
Information about the IRA plot from security chiefs moved the Cabinet to halt
the scheduled early release of the nine men.
Their release would have been part of Dublin's continuing bid to progress the
Northern Ireland peace process. Instead, they were only given parole for the
Christmas holiday, to return to jail by the New Year.
Among the nine is Thomas McMahon, who was jailed for life for the murder of
Earl Mountbatten on a fishing trip off County Sligo 16 years ago. Already
frequently released on parole, he has been on a pre-release training scheme for
almost a year.
If the IRA men had been freed permanently, they would have brought to 45 the
number of terrorist prisoners released by Dublin since the start of the
Northern Ireland ceasefire last year.
Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's senior strategist said, the move was a slap in
the face for his party.
Party leaders are expected to seek an early meeting with Irish Premier John
Bruton to discuss the decision. However, in the absence of further IRA-linked
incidents, more releases should be approved by Dublin early in the new year.
Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, former Irish justice minister said for the Irish Fianna
Fail opposition party that no government would take a decision to cancel
releases lightly.
``Looked at in the overall situation, there is no doubt widespread concern that
the recent spate of killings in Northern Ireland may have some connection with
the IRA.
``The decision has to be based on very careful consideration of sensitive
security information.''
Meanwhile, loyalist and republican prisoners left Northern Ireland's top
security Maze prison yesterday to spend Christmas with their families.
They have been given the usual seven days parole but there were complaints from
loyalists that with the ceasefire continuing they were not being allowed to
stay out for New Year.
Loyalists were let out first, followed by republicans.
Some 450 inmates applied for parole and around 390 were given it, said the
Prison Service - 25 more than last year.
Increases in remission for paramilitary prisoners introduced last month - up
from one third to 50% - meant that an extra 80 men had completed enough of
their sentence to qualify for parole.
The Northern Ireland Office said 86 prisoners were given final release last
month following the remission changes.
Against expectations, no IRA men transferred permanently from England to
Northern Ireland jails since the ceasefire to serve out their sentences for
mainland bombings and shootings were released.
The Prison Service said none of them qualified for parole.
Prisoners have to have served at least 11 years of their sentence, or in the
case of lifers, to have been given a provisional release date or had a
recommendation made to the Secretary of State for a release date by the life
sentence review board.
The decision has to be based on very careful consideration of sensitive

THERE was a royal fan club at Murrayfield yesterday as Peter Phillips, the
Queen's grandson, made sporting history when he played for the Scottish schools
rugby side.
The Princess Royal watched her son, with her husband Commander Timothy
Laurence, and Peter's sister, Zara. The boy's father, Captain Mark Phillips,
also attended the match, against a French schools side.
Peter, 18, is the first royal to play for his country at international level,
but the Scottish team, alas, lost 18-12 at a wet and windy Murrayfield. The
Princess Royal, who is president of the Scottish Rugby Union, declined to watch
the match from the royal box, choosing instead to join other parents in the
crowd of around 300.
The French side dominated the game from the beginning, scoring three tries,
while the Scots managed to score only through penalties.
After the match, Mr Tom Robertson, president of the Scottish schools rugby
team, said that the entire team, including Peter, had played well.
``They gave everything they had and Peter played his part to the full. He did
everything we expected him to do,'' he said.
He said it was now a matter for the selectors to decide if he will play in the
next international, against Wales on January 5.
After the match, Captain Phillips left with the rest of the royal party.

Back door only
at City Halls
ACCESS to Glasgow City Halls will be through the back door only for the next
four years. The halls in Candleriggs are currently under renovation and signs
outside the main entrance redirect visitors to the back until June 1999.
A Glasgow District Council spokesman said: ``It's not like we are trying to
rebuild the pyramids or anything, but the work will take four years.''
Coining it
OLD coins left outside Strathcarron Hospice near Denny in Stirlingshire have
raised #40 for its funds. The coins were found in an old ice-cream carton with
the words ``For Strathcarron Hospice'' written on it.
Drugs warning
TWO young women who took amphetamine at a nightclub were admonished yesterday

Missing plea
POLICE in Edinburgh have asked for help in tracing a 13-year-old girl who has
been missing since November 25. Debbie Reid, who is also known as Cheyne, was
last seen when she set off from Ratho for a shopping trip in the capital. She
is about 5ft tall, of heavy build, with dark brown hair and eyes, and was
wearing a navy Reebok sweatshirt, checked blouse, and beige jeans.

Councillors reject
city mosque plan
A PROPOSAL to build a new mosque in Aberdeen on a five-acre site, at the corner
of King Street and the beach esplanade, has been rejected by city councillors.
The present mosque in the Spital is said to be too small, but the arts and
recreation committee decided yesterday the King Street site was inappropriate
and referred the decision to the property committee.
Heated attack
EAST ANGUS MP Andrew Welsh yesterday in Arbroath attacked the Government for
cutting #31m from its home insulation grants scheme ,from #100m to #69m, next
year. The SNP housing spokesman said the cut would increase health risks for
those in poorly insulated houses, could mean 200,000 fewer houses being
insulated, the loss of 1000 jobs, and a #12m fall in sales to insulation
suppliers.
Victim named
POLICE have named the victim of a road accident on the A93 Blairgowrie to
Braemar road as Mr William Paisley, 33, of Broughty Ferry, Dundee. He was
travelling south when his red Honda Prelude left the road south of Bridge of
Cally during heavy snow.

CHRISTMAS came early to the holiday island of Majorca yesterday when the #185m
top prize from Spain's biggest lottery ``El Gordo'' (The Fat One) - billed as
the world's richest - showered on the capital, Palma.
Wine flowed and people danced and sang in the streets as it was revealed that
the jackpot was shared between holders of 117 tickets bearing the number 45495.
Each ticket is worth #1.5 million, and the winning tickets were sold entirely
in the working class Coll d'Enravassa neighbourhood of Palma.
Within minutes of the winning number being drawn at lottery headquarters in
Madrid traffic police were rushing to Antonio Duran's lottery shop in the area
to try to sort out a massive jam.
Mr Duran said: ``Everyone seems to have won something, the tickets were that
spread out.
``I didn't keep a ticket for myself, but someone gave me two small shares as a
present.'' He won #8000.
``We'll be treating everyone to champagne,'' said a chef at a hotel whose staff
bought one of the winnning tickets.
``It's the first time it's happened to me,'' said a middle-aged woman. ``And
it's more than welcome; my husband is unemployed and my house is old.''
Each lottery ticket costs #160 and they are normally bought by friends,
families or workmates who club together to take shares. It was not known
exactly how many people held this year's winning tickets.
El Gordo is a national obsession in Spain and the country comes to a standstill
each December 22 as people watch a nationwide live television broadcast to see
if they have struck lucky.
In keeping with tradition, 28 boys and girls from Madrid's San Ildefonso school
took turns drawing the winning numbers.
The 1995 lottery was expected to pay out a total of almost #1000m in prizes. El
Gordo is ranked as the world's richest lottery although others often award
larger top prizes.
Statistics show Spaniards are the world's biggest gamblers after Filipinos.

THE European fish deal met a cool welcome yesterday from Scotland's fishermen
who say it is a poor agreement, though it could have been
worse.
Some predicted last night that in spite of the concessions won some fishermen
would be forced to land illegally caught fish - black fish - to survive.
They added that jobs on land and at sea could be lost as a result of the cuts
involved in the agreement reached after 14 hours of talks.
Scottish Fisheries Minister Raymond Robertson welcomed the deal as the best
which could have been secured. He said: ``Overall this deal has to be seen as
a
balanced one and the best which could have been negotiated for our fishermen.
``Tony Baldry, the UK Fisheries Minster, and I were determined to strike the
right balance between responsible fish management to ensure a healthy future
for the industry and avoiding too much disruption in the short term.
``We achieved important increases in the stocks of interest to the Scottish
fleet - an extra 16,700 tonnes of herring and an extra 4700 tonnes of whiting.
``Overall, therefore, we have achieved a level of quotas for the Scottish
whitefish fleet at around the same level as this year both in the North Sea
and
in the West of Scotland.''
Mr Robertson added: ``The quotas for mackerel and North Sea herring are much
lower than for 1995. That reduction follows a number of years of intensive and
profitable fishing and we have to respect the warning from the scientists
about
the worrying state of these two stocks.''
However, his optimism for the future was not shared by the fishing community
even though the delegation was able to add more than 50,000 tonnes of fish
worth about #30m to the UK quota.
The industry pointed out that the success was simply in reducing the cuts they
face.
The processing industry demanded that catches be fixed years in advance,
rather
than days, to provide stability and to allow them to plan ahead like other
businesses.
The agreement was condemned by Mr Tom Hay, chairman of the Fishermen's
Association, the new organisation formed by disenchanted fishermen because of
the refusal of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association to back moves
for
Britain to withdraw from the Common Fisheries Policy.
Mr Hay said that even before the cuts Scottish fishermen were unable to live
within the law and even more would now be forced to become law breakers by
landing black fish.
``These throttling regulations emanating from Brussels will mean more
fishermen
cheating and falsifying any document they can to retain their viability,'' he
said. ``This is a terrible situation.''
He added that conservation measures would only be respected by Scottish
fishermen if they were to reap the benefits in the future.
Mr Hay said he believed there had never been any over-fishing by British
vessels and that they had been granted derisory proportions from the 80% of
stocks within ``our waters''.
It was vessels from Spain and Portugal which were plundering the stocks and
the
solution to the problems could be achieved overnight by taking back into
British control an exclusive fishing zone.
The chief executive of Aberdeen Fish Merchants and Curers Association, Mr
Robert Milne, also predicted problems but said they were totally opposed to
CFP
withdrawal although the whole quota system had to be changed.
``I feel under the circumstances the Ministers have done as well as they
possibly could but really the quota levels are still such that industry ashore
and afloat cannot survive on that.
``I am very critical of the mechanism where we are told on December 22 what the
availability of raw materials will be for the
next year. No industry can operate like that.
``We have got to get a system in place where we know, possibly years in
advance, what the availability is going to be. We have
got to get multi-annual Total Allowable Catches.
Mr Milne said: ``The uncertainty is costing us a lot of money and is making us
less efficient than we would want to be.''
He added: ``I do think the time has come when our negotiations must take much
less notice of the scientific evidence. Marine
science is a very inaccurate science and more recognition must be taken of what
the fishermen are saying. They are out there all
the time and know what the stocks are like.''
Mr Bob Allan, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, agreed
that the Ministers had got as much out of it as
they could but from a very poor starting point.
He condemned the way Norway had been able to dictate terms in its negotiations
with the Commission and had asked the Ministers
to try to reopen the Norway negotiations, something they were not prepared to
attempt.
He said it was not a good deal for pelagic fishermen but the white fish
situation was not as bad as it might have been and the
Ministers deserved credit for that.
One of the things they had argued long and hard for was an increase in west
coast prawns from January 1, not like this year when
a review gave them an increase too late to be effective. He said they had been
unsuccessful but were assured the same review
mechanisms were in place and would be acted upon far earlier.
The main changes for British fishermen in key North Sea, western waters and
English channel fishing grounds nexy year compared
with UK catch quotas for this year are: herring - total quota for 1996 101,270
tonnes (117,840 in 1995); North Sea cod - 54,860
tonnes (50,960); haddock - 86,620 tonnes (85,215); whiting - 41,840 tonnes
(40,220); hake - 5460 tonnes (5900); North Sea plaice
- 22,290 tonnes (30,440); mackerel - 144,940 tonnes (217,350); North Sea sole -
990 tonnes (1285)

Moscow, Friday
THE communists were firmly in the lead in Russia's parliamentary election, five
days after the vote, and final figures should be announced on Monday, the
Central Electoral Commission said today.
In voting on a party basis, which allocates half the 450 seats in the State
Duma lower house of parliament, the Communist Party remained first on 21.81% of
the votes cast after counting from 196 of the 225 electoral districts.
This, together with a strong showing in single-mandate constituency voting
which decides the other 225 seats, means the Communist Party led by Gennady
Zyuganov will occupy about one third of the seats in the new Duma.
The results, announced late today, fluctuated only slightly on the figures
published earlier in the day, when a commission official said about 56 million
votes had been counted from the December 17 election in the world's biggest
country.
The position of the top four parties set to clear the five percent barrier to
win places through party lists remained unchanged.
The communists were followed by the ultra-nationalists of Vladimir Zhirinovsky
on 11.29%. Third was Our Home is Russia of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
on 9.74%.
The fourth group set to clear the five percent barrier needed to take up seats
in the Duma was the liberal Yabloko movement of economist Grigory Yavlinsky,
with 7.03%.
All other 39 parties were below the threshold and were not expected to clear it
when the commission announces the final count.
The count in the 225 first-past-the-post individual constituencies was
unofficially finished yesterday.
The communists won 58 of these constituency places. The Agrarian Party, a
likely ally for the communists, had 20 places, while Yabloko had 14 and
Chernomyrdin's bloc 10.
Altogether, 77 constituency seats have been won by independents who have yet to
declare their loyalties. Some may support the communists, although in the last
Duma most were pro-government.
Apart from the combined total of about 150 seats which the communists are
expected to have, around 30 other seats are expected to go to other leftist
parties.
Meanwhile, Russian troops laid siege to Chechnya's second town today after an
eighth day of fighting with separatist rebels who are holding strategic
buildings and pinning down isolated Russian units.
Lieutenant-General Stanislav Kavun, deputy commander of Russian interior troops
in Chechnya, said 36 of his men had been killed in the region since an upsurge
in fighting last week at the start of Russian parliamentary and local
elections. -Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Serbs set to flee with their dead New fears as Muslims prepare to take control of Sarajevo</HEADLINE>

SOME Sarajevo Serbs dug up their dead today ready to flee the Bosnian capital
before Serb areas revert to Muslim-led government control under a peace plan
backed by a Nato-led, 60,000-strong world army.
``My heart has a terrible pain because we Serbs have been sold by the
politicians,'' lamented 32-year-old Jadranko as he and other relatives exhumed
the bodies of a father and son killed in the worst European conflict for 50
years.
With the peace signed and Nato gradually taking control over the peacekeeping
mission, the Bosnian government said today it was ending the formal state of
war which has existed since June 1992 on territory it controls. For the time
being a lesser state of alert would remain in force, the Bosnian state news
agency said. The decision, which was widely expected, comes a week after
Bosnia's self-styled Serb Republic announced it was ending its state of war.
A statement issued by Bosnia's presidency offered security guarantees to Serbs
living in suburbs around Sarajevo and called on them not to flee ahead of the
transfer of their areas to government control.
But despite this and assurances from Nato and the international sponsors of
last week's Paris peace agreements, many Serbs fear they will become victims
when the entire, Serb-besieged city comes under Muslim control.
``After (the peace agreeement) this is Moslem (Bosnian government) territory.
They will destroy our tombstones. We have here many Muslim tombstones. They are
not destroyed. But when the Muslims come, they will destroy ours,'' Jadranko
said.
As Nato troops fanned out across the country, the UN Security Council voted to
create a 1700-strong police force to control, recruit and organise local police
to allay such fears.
The force, to cost $90m in the first six months alone, is expected to be
deployed mainly in Serb suburbs of Sarajevo when they revert to government
control.
Leaders in these suburbs are preventing a Serb exodus in a final bid to reverse
parts of the Paris peace deal, UN aid officials said.
Thousands who want to leave their homes immediately are being stopped and
turned back at checkpoints or denied the paperwork they need as their leaders
campaign to make peace negotiators change their minds.
The UN-sponsored police force will come under the wing of Carl Bildt, the
European envoy in charge of civilian operations, who met Bosnian Serb leaders
in Pale today.
``It has been war, it is now peace, it is going to be very difficult to treat
the enemies of yesterday as partners of tomorrow,'' Bildt told reporters after
the meeting.
``Reconciliation is an extremely difficult thing to do. It is very easy to
start war, but it is very hard to have a genuine peace,'' he said after meeting
Velibor Ostojic, deputy ``prime minister'' of the Bosnian Serb government.
Nato officers reported that about 20,000 troops, a third of the Implementation
Force (IFOR), the largest in alliance history, had now deployed across the
wintry Bosnian landscape.
On the third day of its operation in Bosnia, Nato reported encountering no
resistance as the first units of the force penetrated further into the divided
country.
``There has been no significant delay of freedom of movement,''
Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Rayner, spokesman for the alliance's ACE Rapid Reaction
Corps, told reporters.
He said British forces had now reached the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja
Luka and secured other positions in areas previously barred to all foreign
troops.
A French general said his Nato troops would move within days to re-establish
freedom of movement around Bosnia's second major danger-point after Sarajevo,
the divided city of Mostar.
Brigadier-General Francois Gaubert said at a shell-battered airport in Ortijes,
a village just outside Mostar, he was determined to open up roads in the highly
sensitive area.
``Freedom of movement must be guaranteed throughout Bosnia, by day and by
night, and that is what we plan to do.''
Meanwhile, the Security Council today demanded that Croatia lift immediately a
December 27 deadline for Croatian Serbs, who fled Zagreb's army, to reclaim
their property.
In a statement read at a formal meeting, the council said that Croatia had
ignored earlier requests to lift any time limits on the return of refugees.
``The requirement that owners must reclaim their property by December 27
constitutes a virtually insurmountable obstacle for most Serb refugees,'' the
statement said.
``The Security Council strongly demands that the government of the Republic of
Croatia lift immediately any time-limits placed on the return of refugees to
reclaim property.''-Reuter.

RESCUE workers all but gave up hope today of finding more survivors from the
wreckage of an American Airlines jet that smashed into an Andean mountain in
southwest Colombia with 164 people aboard.
Four people are known to have survived the crash of the Boeing 757 on Wednesday
night, four minutes before it was to land at Cali. At least 48 US citizens were
believed to be on board.
Other reports said six people were initially plucked alive from the wreckage,
nearly 12,000ft up on jungle-covered San Jose mountain, in Valle del Cauca
province.
But Cali University Hospital spokesman Humberto Rupiales said there were only
four survivors, and all were expected to fully recover.
``We don't expect to find more survivors,'' said Major Carlos Granados,
co-ordinator of the army rescue operation.
The plane's flight recorder was recovered early today and could provide
information why the aircraft apparently strayed up to 13 miles off course while
approaching Cali in clear weather. The ``black box'' is to be flown to the
United States for investigation.
Rupiales identified the survivors as Gonzalo Dussan, 37; his six-year-old
daughter, Michelle; Mercedes Ramirez, 21, and Mauricio Reyes, 19.
He said they were seated in the central part of the aircraft and were found
trapped amid twisted metal that may have shielded them from fatal injuries.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at least 48 US
citizens were believed to be on flight 965, which originated in Miami. ``This
is not a firm figure. It is possible that this figure could increase,'' Burns
said. Two of the four survivors are ``American citizens,'' he added.
Helicopters airlifted bodies in black plastic bags down to the town of Buga,
where rescue efforts are being co-ordinated and the bodies were being laid out
side-by-side for identification. Rescue efforts are expected to take about
three days, and Burns said about 20 US officials are involved in the effort and
the crash investigation.
The crash was the worst in Colombia's history. It was also the most deadly
involving a US carrier since the 1988 bombing of PanAm flight 103 over
Lockerbie that killed 270 people. It occurred within hours of the December 21,
1988, anniversary of the Lockerbie crash.
At the crash site reached after a three-hour walk through rugged and steep
terrain, relatives of passengers looked for their loved ones.
Dussan, a New Jersey man who was travelling with his wife and two children,
told reporters that he was unaware of any problems with the plane before he was
knocked unconscious when it hit the mountain. The fate of his wife and his son
was unknown.
Radio reports said the pilot reported nothing unusual seconds before the crash.
The airliner was carrying 156 passengers and a crew of eight. It went down in
an area dominated by leftist guerrillas, who have targeted radio beacons for
sabotage attacks in the past.-Reuter.

THE parents of a nine-year-old boy have died within a few days of each other.
Ben Bradshaw - an only child - came home from school to find his mother dead
just two days after his father's funeral.
The results of a post-mortem examination to discover the cause of Annette
Bradshaw's death have yet to be released, a police spokesman said.
Her husband, builder Bill Bradshaw, died at the age of 45 last week from bowel
cancer.
Ben found his mother's body at the family home on the Peachcroft estate,
Abingdon, Oxfordshire, last Friday. He immediately dialled 999 and asked for an
ambulance and police.
Ben's headteacher, Mr John Fisher, said: ``This is a very tragic story and has
been a shock to us all. It has stunned the whole school. I sent a letter to
parents of all children at the school expressing our deep sympathy.
``Ben is an ordinary little lad and it is doubly tragic that it has happened at
this time of year.''
An inquest is expected to be held into the death of 44-year-old Mrs Bradshaw.
Ben is being looked after by relatives in Preston, Lancashire.
Mr David Hastings, a friend of the Bradshaw family who works as a computer
expert at Oxford University, said: ``Annette's death is a loss and it is hard
to react other than to be very shocked and sad.
``Ben took up most of her time, he is a lovely boy. He is very lively,
energetic and always very polite. This is such a tragic way for him to spend
Christmas.''

Victims of gas rig explosion named
THE three men killed in an explosion on a gas rig at a Tyneside yard were named
yesterday.
Mr Steve Welford, 38, Mr Shaun McAlindon, 41, and Mr Ian Hamilton, 32, died in
the blast which happened when high-pressure gas escaped from a compression unit
100ft off the ground.
Mr Welford died instantly and Mr McAlindon and Mr Hamilton soon after in
hospital.
The men were working at Amec's Howdon yard on the River Tyne.
Mr Welford, of Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, Mr McAlindon, Jarrow, and Mr
Hamilton, of Hebburn, both South Tyneside, took the full blast as nitrogen
erupted from a pipe through which it was being passed to test the system.
The pipe fitters were also hit by pieces of metal as the structure gave way in
what a fire brigade spokesman said was like ``a balloon bursting under very
high pressure''.
Four other workers, Mr Philip Jeffries, 32, Mr James Marshall, 46, Mr Thomas
Lowe, 58, and Mr Eric Moir, 35, were released from hospital after treatment for
minor injuries and shock.
Apart from Mr Moir whose home is in Tornashban Gardens, Dyce, Aberdeen, the men
were all from the North-east of England.
The rig was undergoing final commissioning work before being towed across the
North Sea to start production on a new gas field off the coast of Denmark.
For Mr Hamilton, a father of two, it was his first shift of a 12-day temporary
contract to work on the rig.
His father-in-law, Mr Michael Watts, said: ``He was a fine upstanding young lad
- a smashing son-in-law and a splendid father.''
A spokesman at the home of Mr McAlindon, a father of teenage children, said his
wife Heather was too upset to talk.
Divisional officer Dave Simpson, of Tyne and Wear fire brigade, said: ``It was
a quite horrific incident. The men who died had no chance at all. They were
right on top of the pipe when it exploded.''
Health and Safety Executive officials are carrying out a full investigation.
A spokesman emphasised there was no evidence that safety regulations had been
breached.
Mr Dennis Scott, Amec's director of operations, said: ``There is nothing out of
the ordinary about the operation but obviously something did go wrong.
``There could be a number of reasons why it happened and I really would not
like to speculate until the investigation is completed.''
Amec was recently awarded the Sword of Honour by the British Safety Council for
its good safety record.

Police urged demonstrators to be ``peaceful and dignified'' at a vigil today to
be held in memory of Wayne Douglas. The 25-year-old's death in police custody
last week caused rioting in Brixton, south London, which resulted in #1m damage.
Police say two post-mortem examinations have ``vindicated'' the official
version of events that Mr Douglas's death was caused by a heart condition.
Campaigners claim, however, that he died while being restrained with excessive
force after being arrested for aggravated burglary.

A PRIVATE housing development near a memorial which marks the spot where
William Wallace was betrayed and captured in 1305 is unlikely to be afforded
any connection with the Scottish patriot.
Glasgow District Council had refused a request to have streets named after
Wallace on the 520-house Briarcroft development built by Wimpey Homes at
Robroyston, in north-east Glasgow. The reason given was that several city
thoroughfares bore his name. Bartholomew's Glasgow Streetfinder lists 11 such
streets.
Yesterday the council appeared to relent. A spokesman said: ``If names
associated with the story of William Wallace can be incorporated into further
phases of this project we may consider them if we think they are appropriate.''
Mr William Douglas, secretary of the Society of William Wallace, welcomed the
change of heart, and said that the society would campaign to have the estate
named after Wallace.
However a spokeswoman for Wimpey Homes said: ``It is too late. The brochures
and signage.......have already been produced.''
A 20ft stone cross with a sculpted claymore and inscribed plaques, yards from
the estate, marks the site of the house where Wallace was seized by agents of
King Edward.I.
Supporters of Wallace will now have to take on Wimpey if their hero, recently
played by Mel Gibson in the film Braveheart, is to gain commemoration on the
estate.

THE Scottish Office has failed to win vital European funds for the Brechin area
which has been hit by the US Navy's gradual closure of its listening post at
Edzell, costing 400 jobs.
The European Union announced that #84m will be spent in Britain in areas hit by
the run-down in the defence industries.
Nearly #10m is coming to Scotland, which would generally be regarded as good
news. However, the delight was marred for Industry Ministry George Kynoch as he
was unable to secure any of the money for Edzell, which is in his own
constituency. Mr Kynoch has been criticised for lack of action by opponents.
Instead the money, which is in a spending programme called Konver, is being
used in Glasgow, Fife, Edinburgh, Cunninghame, and Argyll and Bute, where it
has to be matched by local authority money.
``The Government will continue to argue strongly for the area's inclusion and
will take the opportunity early in the new year to seek Edzell's inclusion
during discussions on proposals for extending the initiatives,'' said Mr Kynoch
yesterday.
Welcoming the money, Councillor Iain Macdonald of Strathclyde, chair of the
local authority based Arms Conversion Project, said there was still
insufficient help from the Government for local authorities, and he called for
a proper Defence Diversification Agency being established to bring together
defence companies, trade unions, local authorities, and Government departments
to tackle the problems of areas affected by defence closures.
The EU also announced #5.5m for Scotland to help alternative economic activity
in areas hit by textile closures.

Bethlem, West Bank, Friday
PLO leader Yasser Arafat's wife Suha arrived with her baby in Bethlehem today
as Palestinians celebrated their first day of rule over the traditional
birthplace of Jesus.
Hundreds of Palestinians cheered as the Christian-born Suha, carrying her
four-month-old daughter Zahwa, lit up a tall Christmas tree near the Church of
the Nativity.
``I am very happy to be here,'' she said, surrounded by Palestinian flags and
portraits of her Muslim husband, who was expected to make a triumphal entry
from Gaza tomorrow morning and attend Midnight Mass on Sunday.
Bethlehem yesterday became the fifth of six West Bank towns to be handed by
Israel to the Palestine Liberation Organisation by year's end under their
September deal expanding self-rule from Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
Earlier today, French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette was the first foreign
visitor to be received by Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij since the handover of the
town after 28 years of Israeli occupation.
``I am very glad to be in Bethlehem on the first day after the withdrawal. I
think it is a very good event for us to participate in the joy of the
Palestinian people. I feel very proud to be here,'' de Charette told reporters.
Mayor Freij presided over a ceremony today in which the Palestinian flag was
raised over former Israeli military headquarters to the skirl of bagpipes.
Freij denied reports on Israel Radio that citizens of the Jewish state would
not be welcome this Christmas in his town.
``We will not stop anyone coming to Bethlehem for shopping or sightseeing but
they must come without guns,'' he told Reuters.
But Israeli Tourism Minister Uzi Baram told Israel Radio: ``There is an
agreement between the (Palestinian self-rule) Authority and our groups that
Israelis will not go to Bethlehem to see the Christmas celebrations.''
The Israeli army said it was for now barring Israelis, but not foreign
tourists, from the town. Israelis were allowed only to visit Rachel's tomb on
Bethlehem's outskirts, it said.
Israeli soldiers yesterday waved to cheering Palestinians on leaving the
military headquarters. Church bells pealed, fireworks lit up the sky and
Palestinians fired off pistols when Israelis left Manger Square. Thousands sang
and danced.
The town of 45,000 is about 40% Christian and 60% Muslim. It is expected to be
flooded with 50,000 tourists on Christmas Eve.
Meanwhile, Arafat has appointed senior PLO figure, Mahmoud Abbas, to head a new
10-member commission supervising the first Palestinian elections next month,
officials said today.
The commission replaces an interim body which was headed by Saeb Erekat, a
member of the Palestinian Authority, who is also a candidate for the January 20
poll.
It is the first prominent post Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen, has taken
connected to the Palestinian self-rule deal with Israel he helped to negotiate
in Oslo in 1993.
Abbas was a key mover behind the breakthrough agreement but subsequently
withdrew from active public life and was reported to be unhappy at the way the
peace deal was being implemented.-Reuter.

IT is disappointing to see The Herald's economic forecasting reduced to the
level of the English press - whether or not there is confidence in the High
Street, whether or not there is a feel-good factor (For whom the tills tell,
December 20).
In any other field of knowledge such vague guesswork would be denounced as
meaningless mumbo-jumbo. There is a crying failure to link up these economic
vaticinations with other relevant areas of the economy.
As, for instance, that there are now some 20 million unemployed in Europe; and
that there is now, because of computerisation and automation, growth without
reduction of unemployment.
I even have it on good authority that the CBI thinks there will have to be a
40% reduction of costs throughout British industry.
The simple fact is that people do not have enough money in their pockets to
buy, despite the hype we shall read about Christmas sales breaking all records.
This is so because of competition, and hence downsizing, laying off hands, etc,
to keep the bottom line in the black.
The result is that fewer and fewer people are producing more and more goods,
working 60-hour weeks. So there is less and less money about to buy what this
hugely increased productivity produces.
It is not the consumers who hold the key to the economy. It is the Government
with its obsessive free-market dogma which is driving Britain towards economic
crisis.
What Britain needs is production for human welfare, not production for profit.
Otherwise we are heading straight for economic and social catastrophe.

IN the 1980s the mention of the name ``Bangour General Hospital'' always
brought the response, ``Oh, yes, the burns unit''.
In fact, the fabulous testament to its history, The Bangour Story, written in
1991, shows within its covers that many and various firsts were pioneered there.
I'm sure that my late grandfather, who worked as a nurse there and never moved
more than half a mile from its 960 acres until he died in one of its wards in
1984, would have hoped that it could be preserved in some way with a lasting
memorial.
He certainly would have been very sad if he had thought that, when St John's
Hospital, Livingston, celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary in the year 2015,
the buildings that made up its predecessor should be found in a similar
condition to those of Killearn Hospital (December 11).

GLASGOW is being promoted as a European and international city. Our museums and
galleries are free, well-attended, and win awards.
I show many overseas visitors around the city - the Tenement House, the
Burrell, Kelvingrove Art Gallery, and the Museum of Religion.
My last visitors, from New Zealand, were amazed and irritated to discover that
although they were able to buy postcards and greetings cards, they were unable
to buy the necessary stamps with which to post them.
Only 19p and 25p stamps were available but not the requisite 35p and 41p
stamps, or even the stamps to make up the postage for standard international
mail.
This was especially bizarre at Kelvingrove which even provides a letter-box.
The only helpful place was the square-yard section of the Barras Market where a
stallholder gave my friends stamps from his wallet.
The Barras gets none of the support the others do.

I've a good mind to shout ``Christmas Tree!'' or sing ``Away in a Manger'' at
John Macleod just to spoil his Christmas.
I do, indeed, but I'm not allowed to. You see, as a Catholic who tries, often
unsuccessfully, to put into practice the rules of living laid upon me by my
pastors, my church, and my Maker, I must love John Macleod . . . and Ian
Paisley . . . and, man for man, the entire Rangers football team.
I don't have to like them but I must love them.
I know not of one thinking practising Catholic who has nowt but the greatest
admiration for the present Lord Chancellor. The quiet dignity, the steadfast
holding to principles (not notoriously Catholic principles), the sheer
integrity of the man, all shine out like a strong beacon in the filthy morass
of what we call Government.
To bring in ``assorted Roman Catholic bigots in high places already baying for
his blood,'' as being part-players in the recent Free Church family quarrel is,
in all seriousness, a matter for the psychiatrists (December 12).

MR BLAIR continues to ensure that Labour retains the image of moderation which
he has already imprinted on it. Just how important that is to its success may
only be guessed at but few would doubt that it is important to the lead Labour
at present enjoys in the opinion polls. The British political culture places no
premium on extremes - indeed, it is more likely to impose a penalty on any
party which allows itself to move too far from the middle ground where the
competition for votes is always most intense. Mr Blair has insisted that he has
no intention of overturning all the changes brought in by the Tories these past
16 years.
Several arguments suggest that he is right to be cautious. First, many of the
Thatcher changes, especially in industrial relations, were popular. At the
time, and even more with hindsight, it seems clear that the changes wanted by
Mrs Castle (``In Place of Strife'') during the Wilson administration would have
been enough to have satisfied public opinion about trade union rights and
responsibilities. The unions scuppered all of these, but the Thatcher proposals
which replaced them were more severe. Mr Blair must also have considered the
argument that any commitment to return to the old dispensation would simply arm
the Tories with tried-and-tested weaponry. Where the Tories did go too far - as
with union rights and representation at the communications centre at Cheltenham
- they are themselves beginning to retreat, a process Mr Blair will probably
both strengthen and speed. It is doubtful, however, if he will re-establish
unfettered rights to strike, the main right Mrs Thatcher withdrew.
Complete reversals of policy have been rare in post-1945 British politics. A
big exception concerned the steel industry which came and went from state
ownership more than once; but a general respect for each party's legislation
seems to have prevailed, mainly because the parties have not been as
ideologically motivated as their rhetoric would suggest. Each of the parties is
an informal coalition of groups and interests with a degree of overlap,
something which allows opinion to move to and fro far more easily than would be
the case were their separation more marked and permanent. In fact their own
centres of gravity move, something which has allowed Mr Blair to move Labour in
a direction and to an extent which makes it electable tomorrow where it was not
yesterday, so to speak.
Partisans do not always see this: they tend to imagine that votes are lost
because what a party offers is not extreme or ideological enough. In fact, it
is obvious that such opinion is immobile; whereas political change is brought
about by opinion which is fluid. Mr Blair is appealing to that sort of opinion
and he has to remain moderate to do so. He is far from being the first Labour
leader to know that: Neil Kinnock and John Smith both established similar
positions, to Labour's advantage, since its recovery in public esteem began
under them. Mr Blair is unusual only in that he has so far managed to marshal a
degree of support which escaped them. If he can maintain that into a General
Election campaign, Labour will be home and dry. Given the extent of the gap
between state revenues and public spending only a very bold critic would reject
Mr Blair's caution at this juncture. Its rejection would definitely involve an
open commitment to much higher direct personal taxation. Does anyone believe
that would be popular?

Leon, Spain, Friday
AN army officer and one other person died in a car bomb explosion in the
northern Spanish city of Leon today, police and local officials said.
Police confirmed that an artillery commander was killed when an explosive
device attached to a saloon car blew up soon after midday.
There was no immediate indication as to who was responsible, but the technique
was similar to that often employed by ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom)
guerrillas.
Initial reports said the bomb had been attached to a car driven by the
commander in the centre of Leon, a major city in the region of Castilla-Leon.
ETA is last believed to have struck on December 11 when a car bomb went off in
a busy Madrid district last Monday, killing six navy employees and injuring a
dozen people.
No-one claimed responsibility for that attack but officials blamed ETA, which
has killed around 800 people in a 26-year-old struggle for Basque independence.
The officer was named as Major Luciano Cortizo who had been shopping in the
city. His 18-year-old daughter in the passenger seat was gravely injured in the
explosion and three passers-by were also taken to hospital.
In the past 11 days, ETA has killed eight people and injured 30 in three bomb
attacks.
Spain's chief of police said that there was no limit to the separatists'
campaign of ``terror for the sake of terror''.

A NATIONAL supermarket chain has called upon a scientist who believes there is
a link between mad cow disease and the fatal human brain condition CJDhas been
asked to pass details of his work.
The Asda chain wants to find out more about the method Dr Harash Narang is
developing in a bid to test cattle for the presence of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy before they are slaughtered.
Newcastle upon Tyne-based Dr Narang also claims the method can be used for
testing for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in living people. CJD is recognised as
the human equivalent of BSE.
The former Public Health Laboratory Service research scientist has long been at
the centre of controversy over his belief that BSE and CJD are linked, and
Asda's national quality control department, based in Leeds, contacted him about
his test.
The approach coincides with growing public concern which has seen sales of beef
dropping by more than 15% over the past month nationwide.
Dr Narang, who has also sent details of his test to Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg, said: ``I am very pleased someone seems to be taking notice.
``Asda only found out about my test after reading about it in an article.
`` This was only a short while after being told by the Ministry that there was
no way of testing live cattle.''
Mike Barber, Asda's meat production manager in charge of meat quality, said he
had not yet been able to study the details sent by Dr Narang.
``The position is we try to keep on top of developments in the industry but we
have total confidence in our meat goods.
``We only use reputable suppliers and we employ the most stringent
procedures,'' he said.

IAN Bell cheers the fact that there are now more people earning their bread
from art-related activities than there are now primary teachers, shipyard or
even whisky workers (December 20). Why the cheers?
Rather than cheer I despair because jobs for arty subsidy junkies can never
create the wealth required even for an independent Scotland never mind a
prosperous UK plc. Is there not a correlation between the number employed in
arts and the declining position of UK plc in the economic league?
Is not part of the problem that the media appears to be obsessed with the arts
(and The Herald is no exception) at the expense of the wealth-creating trades
and professions?
My solution is that for starters any teacher who discourages his or her star
pupil to take up technical subjects should be immediately dismissed.
Secondly, the media coverage now committed to the arts should be replaced with
technical subjects. In other words what UK PLC desperately need is to encourage
a generation of wealth creators.
I sincerely believe that what this country needs are more wealth creators. Of
course the Oxbridge arts faculties have produced some fantastic comedians, and
made UK broadcasting media one of the best.
But will it pay for my pension?

HUNGOVER disc jockey Chris Evans was fined a day's pay yesterday for failing to
turn up for his BBC Radio 1 breakfast show on Thursday.
The #1m-a-year presenter, whose company, Ginger Productions, makes the
programme for the BBC, was believed to have been fined about #7000 by Radio 1
controller Matthew Bannister.
Evans, 29, spent almost half-an-hour in the controller's office where he was
warned about fulfilling his contract.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ``Chris has been severely told off and his wages
docked, which for him is quite substantial.''
Yesterday Evans returned to the airwaves in wise-cracking style and joked about
missing the programme.
``It's so good to be back, I feel like I've had a holiday in Bermuda - although
it was more expensive than a week in Bermuda, obviously,'' he told listeners.
Evans left Broadcasting House at 10am in his new Bentley. He refused to speak
about the incident.

<HEADLINE>Lord Advocate to seek definitive legislation on doctors wishing to withdraw treatment Coma case goes to three judges</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974749734</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S first ``right to die'' case is to be heard by three senior judges
because of the importance of the public policy issues involved.
The Lord Advocate also made it clear yesterday that he is pressing Government
colleagues to consider legislation to remove the legal uncertainty faced by
doctors who wish to withdraw treatment from patients in a persistent vegetative
state.
Lord Mackay of Drumadoon said it would be ``quite intolerable'' for doctors in
Scotland to feel at a disadvantage compared with their English colleagues who
have the legal protection of a House of Lords ruling.
He also explained why he had not issued a statement to the effect that doctors
treating 52-year-old Mrs Janet Johnstone, who has been in a deep coma at Law
Hospital, Carluke, for nearly four years, would escape prosecution if they
withdrew her artificial feeding.
The doctors and Mrs Johnstone's family agree that she should be allowed to die,
but because of risk of prosecution for murder or culpable homicide, Law
Hospital NHS Trust has asked for the protection of a Court of Session order
before taking any steps to withdraw treatment.
Lord Mackay argued yesterday that this was a case which the court should report
to three judges because it involved complex and important issues arising from a
very difficult human situation.
He agreed that there was ``considerable uncertainty'' about the legal issues
involved, except for one - there could be absolutely no doubt that, in its
present terms, the order sought by the NHS trust was incompetent.
``The position I adopt is to ensure that the court only grants a competent
order upon a proper examination of the legal issues involved,'' he said.
``It would do no service to those who have to practise in this field, nor would
it be of service to relatives or patients who are caught up in this situation,
for the court to pronounce a remedy out of a feeling of sympathy rather than a
proper legal examination of the issues.''
He pointed out that the Scottish Law Commission had recently produced a report
on the issue with a strong recommendation that legislation was needed.
That was now receiving the attention of the Government and the Lord Advocate
said he would be making it abundantly clear to his ministerial colleagues that
the problem should be addressed as a matter of urgency.
``It would be quite intolerable that the medical profession in Scotland should
feel at a disadvantage as opposed to their counterparts in England.''
In England, the House of Lords laid down in the Tony Bland case that there was
no absolute duty on doctors to continue treating a patient no matter what the
circumstances.
Lord Mackay said the suggestion had been made that doctors had not received
guidance from him. The complaint was that he had not formed a view as to the
lawfulness or otherwise of the course of conduct the doctors wished to follow
in Mrs Johnstone's case.
``In my submission it is not for the Lord Advocate of the day to provide
members of the public with legal advice or guidance as to whether their past
course of conduct has been lawful, or proposed course of conduct would be
lawful.
``The Lord Advocate cannot express a view that, if certain conduct takes place,
those who carry it out would be guilty of a crime because that is not for the
Lord Advocate to decide. That is for the High Court or the sheriff court to
decide after proper criminal proceedings.''
The Lord Advoate said the hospital in this case had relied heavily on the Bland
case, but there was a quite fundamental distinction between Bland's case and
this one.
The Bland question had been decided by the House of Lords judges expressly
addressing the issue of criminal responsibility and it appeared that civil
courts in England would adjudicate on issues of criminal responsibility.
That was not the case in Scotland, but it was clear that in this case the Court
of Session was being asked to involve itself in a question of criminal
responsibility. This was an area into which, until now, the Court of Session
had steadfastly refused to go.
His suspicion was that the main purpose of the present action was to get as
much protection as possible from criminal proceedings.
However, he expressed sympathy with the medical profession and relatives caught
up in a situation where there were differences between Scotland and England for
reasons which they might not readily understand.

A COUNCIL took emergency measures yesterday to cancel Christmas and New Year
raves at one of Scotland's top rave venues, the Fubar Club in Stirling.
At an emergency meeting, Stirling District Council's civic licensing committee,
acting on police advice, suspended the club's public entertainment licence for
raves over the period.
There had earlier been a series of dawn raids on homes in Central Scotland.
It is understood that four people were arrested in connection with alleged drug
dealing at the Fubar. The four, who have not been identified, are expected to
appear in court on Tuesday.
The arrests are the result of a long-running police operation.
About 800 tickets for the Christmas Day rave have already been sold, and
Stirling's civic licensing chairman, Mr Geoff Hill, urged people to stay at
home.
Licensing committee members, meeting behind closed doors, voted to suspended
the Fubar licence for up to six weeks on the grounds of public safety. They
received a verbal report from the police divisional commander for Stirling,
Superintendent Joe Holden.
The committee will hold a full hearing in the new year at a date to the fixed.
The Fubar nightclub had intended to hold raves on Christmas Day, Boxing Day,
and Hogmanay.
A spokesman for Castle Leisure Ltd, which runs the nightclub, said directors
and other executives were attending Christmas functions and were unavailable
for comment.
The club was first granted a conditional six-month licence to hold raves in
November 1992, despite protests from local mothers. The women and members of a
self-styled Drugs Action Group said allowing raves would create a magnet for
drug dealing.
The licence was renewed for three years in April 1993, amid protests from local
residents about noise from the club. It is due to expire on April 23.
In December 1993, the civic licensing committee decided to suspend the club's
licence for one month because of a breach of conditions. It was said that
tickets for events had been advertised for sale on the door, when the licence
only allowed admission by pre-sold tickets.
The suspension of the Fubar's public entertainment licence does not affect the
club's discos or House Music evenings, which operate under a separate liquor
licence from Stirling licensing board.
A report will be sent to the board by the civic licensing committee explaining
the committee's decision.

<TEXT>
OVER one million British diabetics may be able to throw away their syringes and
simply pop a pill in the future thanks to a revolutionary medical breakthrough
by Scottish scientists.
The prospect of a new drug to treat the condition, which can cause blindness,
heart disease, and kidney failure, has attracted great interest from drug
companies anxious to conclude deals with the Scottish team.
More than three quarters of diabetics do not lack insulin within their bodies,
but suffer from a defective ``signalling system'' which prevents insulin from
stimulating muscle and fat cells in the proper way.
Now scientists have isolated an enzyme which plays a vital part in the
signalling process and allows the insulin to transform glucose into a form
which can be stored in the body.
The team, based at the University of Dundee, is led by Professor Philip Cohen,
one of the world's top 100 scientists, and has made one of the biggest
breakthroughs in 70 years of research into the disorder.
Yesterday he said: ``This is a very important breakthrough. We are doing the
research side of things. It is now up to the pharmaceutical companies to
develop a drug which can activate the enzyme.
``But with modern techniques for drug development it may not be long until we
see this new treatment for diabetes.''
The research has already attracted interest from several pharmaceutical
companies and researchers are confident that their findings mark the beginning
of the end for daily injections of insulin.
Professor Cohen said: ``Research into the insulin signalling system first began
in 1973, but it is only after advances in our understanding of the function of
enzymes, during research into heart disease and cancer, that we were able to
understand the importance of enzymes in diabetes.
``The more we unpick the chain of events involved in the signalling mechanism,
the easier it should be to develop drugs to treat diabetes.''
He said that the enzyme, named c-Akt, leaves only one or two of the secrets of
insulin left uncovered.
Researchers Dario Alesi and Darren Cross discovered that c-Akt can ultimately
protect against high levels of glucose in the blood, and had their findings
published in Nature scientific magazine.
The British Diabetic Association, which currently funds 66 research projects
and has allocated more than #4m for research into diabetes in 1996, has
welcomed the breakthrough.
Director of research Dr Moira Murphy said: ``Results such as these are an
important step forward in tackling diabetes.''

Amsterdam, Friday
DUTCH teenage striker Patrick Kluivert is to be prosecuted for causing death by
dangerous driving for his part in a fatal accident last September, the news
agency ANP reported today.
The 19-year-old Ajax Amsterdam player, who scored both goals against Ireland
last week to earn the Netherlands a berth in the 1996 European championship
finals, has already admitted to speeding.
Kluivert was unhurt when the BMW sports car he was driving ploughed into the
side of another vehicle on September 9, killing its driver and seriously
injuring a passenger.
He faces up to one year in jail, a fine of 10,000 guilders and a five-year
driving ban if found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.
Laboratory tests on behalf of the Amsterdam public prosecutor estimate Kluivert
was travelling at around 104 kmph - double the speed limit - but his lawyer
says the car was going much slower. The case will open some time in the first
three months of next year, ANP added.
It was a second blow for Ajax after the club learned earlier that international
winger Marc Overmars would be out for the rest of the season with a serious
knee injury and would also miss the European finals in England.
q A man who threatened to kill tennis star Boris Becker and his family in a
bizarre extortion case was convicted by a Munich court today and given a
suspended two-year sentence.
Michael Jung, 29, was also ordered to immediately start psychiatric treatment.
Prosecutors had requested a four-year sentence but presiding judge Norbert
Schmitt accepted the defendant's statement that he never intended to carry out
his threats.-AP/Reuter.

<TEXT>
AN image of Jesus found on a rock has brought neither peace nor goodwill to the
people of the Australian wheat-belt town of Beverley this Christmas.
A deep rift has emerged between believers and doubters since local businessman
Julian Webb said he saw the image of Christ's face mystically appear on a slab
of granite at his farm six weeks ago, 87 miles east of Perth.
Attitudes among the 1400 townsfolk vary. Some think they have beheld a miracle,
others think it is a hoax and a tourist trap. There is a growing and uneasy
feeling that the rest of Australia is laughing at them.
Rumours abound that a wealthy American is preparing to buy the newfound relic,
together with up to half the town; that the face fulfills an aboriginal elder's
15-year-old prediction; and that it is somehow linked to other phenomena such
as crop circles and mysterious lights that appear over the town.
The divide between the sceptics and the faithful has soured relations in a way
no worldly controversy has in the past.
``It's because of the religion thing that gets people's backs right up,`` said
Ray Dickie, the doubting publican of the suitably secular Freemasons Hotel.
``If it was a nugget of gold someone found you could say `That's a fake' or
`It's got to be a plant' and you'd be entitled to your own opinion,'' he added.
``But with religion, some people give you a real serve.''
Dickie lamented that of the thousand-plus pilgrims and tourists who visited the
rock last weekend, when it was displayed at the Beverley town hall, none showed
an interest in drinking.
Local professional psychic Roma Paton has examined the energy fields of the
``miracle'' rock and doubts it is a hoax.
``Its energy field is very different from granite. I sensed no density from the
rock or the quarry around it,'' she said.
``If it is a hoax, then that doesn't explain the strange light my husband and I
saw over Beverley the night it was found (November 9) or the crop rings which
appeared three weeks earlier.''
She had also heard an aboriginal elder predicted 15 years ago that the face of
Jesus would appear in Beverley.
The rock will be displayed over Christmas, guarded by friends and relatives, at
the quarry site where it was found on Webb's property.
``I was fully expecting the backlash from the sceptics but the faith of so many
well-wishers has been enough to keep me going,'' Webb said.-Reuter.

CAMERON Simpson reports that the SNP are rumoured to have tapped Dilip Deb to

delegates for Govan South Branch to Govan Constituency Association.
Our branch put forward Nicola Sturgeon in September, and the other branch in
the constituency (Govan Riverside) put forward Patsy Thomson and Shona Robison.
The selection meeting for the constituency was on November 6, and the vote was
decisively for Nicola Sturgeon; our choice was ratified by our national
executive on November 11 - long before Labour's present shenanigans. It is
precisely because she is a candidate of such high calibre that Labour are
worried, and quite rightly so.

Lest we also forget, in a previous leader (September 12, 1991) you said that

<TEXT>
THE English owner of Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern's ancestral but
and ben in the Highlands faces being taken to court for allowing it to fall
into disrepair.
Lord Mackay takes his title from the former shepherd's cottage, Clashfearn,
situated on a rocky hillside near Scourie in Sutherland.
His late father lived there and generations of the family before him. Mr Mackay
later moved to Edinburgh to work on the railways. His son was born in the city
where he was to become a mathematics lecturer before going into law.
A cousin, Mrs Johan Munro, 86, who lives near the cottage, said yesterday: ``He
was up here with his wife visiting us in hospital about a year ago and he was
sad to see the state the cottage has fallen into. He obviously has a
sentimental attachment to it.''
Mrs Munro, her son, and council planners have been fighting for years for
chartered surveyor and estate agent Gerald Garratt of Derby to do something
about the cottage he bought as a holiday home about 15 years ago.
The cottage, with two rooms donwstairs and two attic bedrooms with skylights
upstairs, had part of the roof raised by Mr Garratt and a dormer window put in.
But the work was not completed and Mr Garratt has not been seen there for about
three years.
Mrs Munro said: ``The house is in an awful looking state. The slates have been
stripped off and the rain must be pouring in. I don't know what the man was
thinking about leaving it like this.
``The sad thing is since Lord Mackay took Clashfearn as his name a lot of
people are interested in seeing the place. It would be nice if it was in a
better condition.''
Sutherland planning officer David Polson described the stone-built cottage as
now looking ``rather odd'' with a third of the roof higher than the rest.
He said: ``Mr Garratt has repeatedly ignored requests from us to do something
about it. So he is now being served with a Waste Land notice ordering him to
put the cottage back the way it was before he started his part-completed
alterations.''
If this was disregarded, a report could be sent to the procurator-fiscal in
Dornoch and prosecution could follow.
Mr Polson added: ``It's not because it's Lord Mackay's former family home we
are taking this action. But his relatives have complained and the place is an
eyesore the way it is.''
Mr Garratt, at his business in Queen Street, Derby, said: ``I don't want to say
anything at the moment. I haven't been served with the notice yet. I've had
problems but not to do with the cottage.''

SEVEN private organisations have expressed interest in providing hospital
services in Stonehaven, as has the Grampian Healthcare NHS Trust.
Grampian Health Board will now consider the eight submissions and selected
organisations will be invited to meet informally with the board early next
month.
After more detailed consideration, the board will agree a short-list of
organisations who will be given a copy of the service specification to submit
tenders before April 16. Those on the short-list will be named at the end of
next month.
The Government caused controversy earlier this year when it rejected Grampian
Health Board's proposal that Woodcot Hospital in Stonehaven be disposed of and
a new hospital built on the site of Arduthie Hospital.
The Scottish Office NHS Management Executive told the board to invite open
competition. While some welcome the move as an opportunity for Stonehaven to
gain a hospital service tailored to the needs of the community, others see it
as a step towards privatisation of the National Health Service.
Grampian Healthcare are heading a consortium which includes Community Health
Services who run a number of private nursing homes, Miller Construction of
Scotland, and the British Linen Bank who will finance the project. Their
proposal involves a new hospital and a 30-bed nursing home on the Arduthie
Hospital site.
Details of the specification for the tender will be made public next month and
the document is currently in the final stages of preparation. It is based on
the needs identified by local GPs and the views of the people of Kincardine.
Mr Derek Ogston, Professor of Medicine at Aberdeen University and vice chairman
of Grampian Health Board, said yesterday: ``This is another major step forward
in the development of new hospital services in Stonehaven - provision which
would not have been possible if we were not going through this process.
``We have been very encouraged by the level of interest shown in this
innovative project.
``It is a good demonstration of the potential benefits that can be gained when
the public and private sectors work together and we look forward to further
discussions with interested organisations over the next few weeks.
``From a preliminary consideration of the submissions we are confident we will
be able to purchase excellent services to meet local needs.''

Los Angeles, Friday
ACTOR Jimmy Stewart was admitted to a second hospital today after bumping his
head in a fall at his home.
Stewart, 87, injured himself yesterday when he fell down and hit his head
against a chair.
His publicist, John Strauss, said the actor, who starred in such memorable
films as Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, Mr Smith Goes to Washington,
Harvey'' and Anatomy of a Murder, was admitted to St. John's hospital in Santa
Monica for observation. He is expected to remain there for the next 24 to 48
hours.
Stewart had been taken to Century City Hospital by paramedics late yesterday
after he slipped and fell at his Beverly Hills home. He was treated at the
emergency room and released shortly after midnight.
According to local television reports, eyewitnesses who were singing Christmas
Carols outside Stewart's Beverly Hills home said the popular screen actor was
taken out of his home on a stretcher with bandages on his head.
Although probably best known for his leading role in the annual holiday classic
It's a Wonderful Life, Stewart has starred in a wide range of films, including
thrillers such as Rear Window and Vertigo, comedies and even musicals, playing
the band leader in The Glenn Miller Story.
He was nominated for an Academy Award five times, winning once in 1940 for his
role opposite Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story in 1940.
q Evangelist Billy Graham was released from a New York hospital today following
treatment for broken ribs suffered in a fall, his main office said.
Graham fell in his room at a Manhattan hotel on December 12, suffering four
broken ribs and a bruised right shoulder.
The 77-year-old preacher has Parkinson's disease but doctors said they did not
believe that was what caused his fall.-AP/Reuter.

I FIND it very depressing that in all the political debates on a variety of
subjects not one politician or political party has raised the major question
facing the social fabric, both now and in the future, namely the relationship
between people and modern technology.
The recent postal strike brought this question to a head as a problem which
exists in every factory, office, and shop.
Just how are we going to plan so that people will not feel fearful when
technology provides alternatives to personal labour? It is high time this
question is faced as doing nothing could be the cause of much social strife.

ARMED police surrounded a flat where an escaped killer was hiding, a court
heard yesterday.
They were acting on a tip-off that David Cochrane, 43, who had been on the run
for two-and-a-half weeks, had a weapon.
However, Cochrane gave himself up and walked into the arms of the police, the
Glasgow Sheriff Court was told.
A search of his wife's flat revealed he had never been armed.
Yesterday Cochrane, who was convicted of murder in 1979, was jailed for a
further 15 months.
He admitted escaping from his escorts during a compassionate visit from Perth
Prison to his mother's home at Green Street, Calton, Glasgow, on November 7.
It was Cochrane's second escape from jail since beginning a life sentence.
Last March, after other prisoners had cut a hole in the perimeter fence at
Dungavel, Cochrane took his chance and walked through it.
He was detained soon after and sentenced to 60 days imprisonment.
Yesterday Mr John Macaulay, defending, said that Cochrane was suffering
emotional distress on two fronts: his mother's illness and the fact that he had
not seen his nine-year-old daughter for five months. Mr Kenneth Donnelly,
prosecuting, revealed that after an apparent argument with his wife Janice,
during a visit to his mother's home, prison officers agreed to let them speak
together just outside the living room door.
As they cuddled Mrs Cochrane, who married him in jail in 1988, suddenly opened
the front door then she snibbed it after he  had bolted
Cochrane and two other men were jailed for the murder with an iron bar of
Gallowgate butcher Thomas Woods and the attempted murder of his friend,
Constable Brian Coppins, during a robbery in the butcher's shop.

Making up with       Cannon and Ball was never going                 to be easy
but     Anvar Khan managed to keep them from getting too lippy as they helped
her to consumer test the latest lipsticks
BOBBY Ball is aghast. ``Do you honestly think, that my wife would believe this,
if I walk in, with a bag of lipsticks. `Where did you get these?' Oh, well I
did this interview in Glasgow......'' I am trying to offer both Tommy Cannon
and Bobby Ball a small token of appreciation for the time spent kissing me in
their dressing cubicle in the King's Theatre, Glasgow.
Bobby is chain-smoking. They have just finished the matinee performance of
Robin Hood and the Babes in the Wood. Cotton wool, pens, foundation, and a
bumper size bottle of Happy Shopper Table Salt at the special price of 44p, sit
on their 100-watt mirrored dressers. Glad to see they're still counting the
pennies at this advanced stage in their career.
There was a purpose to being here, being gently slagged by the amiable and
ebullient Cannon and Ball. For my mission was to see just how much staying
power long-lasting lipsticks really have, and how better to road-test them,
than under the mistletoe with a couple of stars, notorious for their decorum,
their sense of humour, and their durability.
The interview was not easy. I am gullible and the smaller, curlier half, is a
mischievous wee imp. Outrageous lies included working as Santa Claus in the
mornings at Marks &amp; Spencer. Cannon and Ball are men. Please take their
comments with a pinch of the Happy Shopper. They know what they like and what
they don't like, because, when it comes to how women look, male opinion is
almost always based on prejudice.
n.Shiseido SP5 Red and Famous, #16
``Don't press your lips together for a few minutes after putting this on,''
warned the sales assistant. ``You have to let this lipstick dry.'' Yes, one has
to stand in front of the mirror with one's jaw hanging open like a moo. Letting
your lipstick set is quite a concept. You're applying paint, a thin, plasticky
film of average colour. But it provides invisible kisses. I had to rub
violently at my lips with a tissue to get it off, because I neglected to buy
the special Shiseido Absolute Lipstick Remover at #8.95.
Cannon: My wife wears red lipstick, but I wouldn't buy this, not when I can't
even pronounce the name.
Ball: It sounds like a Chinese takeaway.
Cannon: It looks like a small biro. You want it to last a lifetime at #16.
Ball: If this was in my wife's bag I'd think it was a suppository.
n.Boots No7 Lasting Colour Lipstick in Matt Desire, #3.95
Matt lipsticks are, by their very purpose, dry. I applied this product on to
beeswaxed lips and had to blot several times with a tissue for me to trust it
enough to take. Although I was wearing lip pencil, after the first few hours of
the working day, coffee, a roll and a lot of talking, it tended to clump at the
corner of my big mouth. There is, in this tube, #4's worth of transferable
goop. Avoid his crisp white collar.
Ball: Why don't they make a lipstick which comes off your jacket?
Cannon: This doesn't look like desire to me. Why don't they invent a flavoured
lipstick, like a pint of McEwan's lager?
n.Max Factor Lasting Lip Colour in Teasing Pink, #3.49
A creamy substance which will only imprint a shell of a kiss on the cheek.
However, after delivering the first half dozen smackers, it tends to congregate
in the lines of your lips. Sticky. The outer, moisturising layer landslides
after a drink, to reveal pink stained lips. A quick slick of lip gloss to
lubricate, however, and you can carry on pecking.
Cannon: This is the strangest interview we've ever done. I think we'll have to
be careful in future when we're stopping here in Glasgow, after talking about
lipsticks.
Ball: It looks like a mouth freshener.
Cannon: It actually looks like one of my kid's finger crayons. You put your
finger in here......
n.Rimmel Lasting Finish Lipstick in Birthday Suit, #1.99
Gives even colour on the mouth but comes off on a glass of wine (not that I was
drinking on the job, not that Cannon and Ball drove me to it, no way). This is
not an adhesive. One kiss leaves a shimmering butterfly. But it's cheap, and if
you buy a pale colour such as this, where's the problem if it gets on someone's
shirt? Aren't they lucky to get a kiss from you anyway?
Cannon: Is that supposed to be the colour of skin? It's a very cheap, plasticky
case. I'd give it as a present to someone I didn't like. A naff effort.
Ball: We use Clarins, y'know.
Cannon: I'm getting bored. What do I know about lipstick anyway?
Ball: But seriously though, have you see the women who put that lip liner
around their mouths. They look as if they've got a bad heart.
n.Beauty Without Cruelty in Peony Passion, #2.65
Without the use of petrochemicals, with a sole reliance on natural, traditional
ingredients, this lipstick does pretty well. Even without pretensions to being
extra lasting, it remains on the lips for just as long as the Rimmel product.
It has a mild glossing effect, which frankly, makes lips more luscious. Warm,
soft and smoochy.
Ball: That's your colour, Tommy, you suit it!
Cannon: At #2 odd, can it be any good? I suppose they charge more if they test
a product on animals.
Ball: I like this blue case.
Cannon: I suppose women feel better with lipstick on. When a woman's made up,
she looks great, but I don't think a fella should see her doing it.
n.Cutex Lasting Colour Lipstick in Northern Lights, #3.49
An interesting interpretation of the colour of the Northern Lights. An
opalescent mauve. It will stay on your lips for up to five hours, but expect a
frost of purple after biting on the snowy plains of any white bread sandwich.
You must blot either before eating and drinking, or after, in order for the
colour to stick. You can kiss away the party hours, however, with this one, if
you're delicate. Just don't press too hard or you'll leave the dreaded tattoo.
Cannon: I hate lots of lipstick on a woman. You go on a date and you kiss her,
and then you walk about for hours with lipstick on yer face. I don't like
sliding about on them, women's lips, like being on a ski slope.
Ball: Can we go home now?
All lipsticks featured are available from Debenhams, Frasers, Boots, and good
independent chemists.
n Cannon and Ball are starring in Robin Hood and the Babes in the Wood at the
King's Theatre, Glasgow, until February 3.

JAMES Freeman's report, Laying down law of the Loch, will provide heartwarming
news for all those who have campaigned for years for the introduction of
by-laws to control speed limits on Loch Lomond (December 19).
As your report notes, the by-laws are a significant step forward, but are not
the final answer. The introduction of a National Park, with an all-purpose
authority with planning powers - and adequate financial resources - is
essential to the long-term sustainable use of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs
area.
Michael Forsyth's support for the by-laws is a welcome recognition of the
nature and scale of the developmental pressures affecting this
internationally-renowned area, but his comment that the by-law measures are a
perfect example of local solutions to local problems is correct only in part.
Local solutions are essential if a national park mechanism is to work
successfully, and be seen as a democratically-based designation which has the
support of local people.
However, the problems of Loch Lomond are not only local, they are of European
and international significance. At a recent seminar Professor Adrian Phillips,
chairman of the World Conservation Union Commission on National Parks and
Protected Areas, set out the criteria by which Loch Lomond and the Trossachs
could receive international recognition.
He concluded on a personal note by saying: ``If it were decided to create a
National Park for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, it would be a welcome partner
to the European and global network of protected areas.''

Recent events in Govan have highlighted a problem much more potent and harder
to tackle than overt racism, believes Jimmy Reid
THERE are more than two million Asians in Britain. Many have been born here.
All are British citizens. More than 77% vote Labour. Seven British Asians stood
for selection as Labour parliamentary candidates for the impending General
Election. All were rejected.
The last to be rejected was Mohammad Sarwar in Govan who lost the nomination by
one vote. Fifty two votes of accredited party members were ruled ineligible.
The majority had been cast for Mohammad Sarwar.
Maybe in each of these constituencies racism played no part. But one thing's
for sure, if Mohammad Sarwar was called Maurice Smith there wouldn't be a
fraction of the public and media interest we now see focused on the Govan
Constituency Labour Party.
I remember once sitting in the control room of a television programme on the
results, which were flowing in, of local government elections in Scotland. On
the screen came up the news, Bashir Maan wins in Glasgow. The director who was,
as you would expect, directing the operation, cried out to his minions:
``Scotland's first coon cooncillor.'' Everyone laughed. I didn't. The man
wasn't kidding. He was a full-blooded racist.
Our main problem isn't the full-blooded racist but the wishy washy one, who
quite likes blacks as long as they know their place and they don't forget it,
as in the America of 50 years ago. Negroes voted Democrat. The Democrat bosses
welcomed negro votes, but not negro candidates. Negroes determined to be
candidates were considered uppity niggers. There are those today in Scotland
who consider Mohammad Sarwar an ``uppity Paki''. And to deny this, is dishonest.
In a very real sense it couldn't be otherwise. Until fairly recently, in the
timescale of history, our country was the centre of the biggest empire the
world has ever seen. Empire implies subject peoples. The Romans had no qualms
about their empire and subject peoples. They simply saw them as the legitimate
booty of conquest.
But after the Enlightenment, European nations had to disguise their empire
building, and dress it up as a humanitarian crusade. The savages had to be
civilised. We could subdue them, no bother at all, our cannons against their
spears. But as they were unfit to govern themselves (though they had been doing
so for thousands of years), we would govern them instead, and the missionaries
would come and try to show them our ways.
This whole approach was based on a hierarchical delineation of peoples, which
defined their fitness or unfitness to govern, based on a concept of superior
and inferior races. To the colonialist, unfitness to govern was in practice
permanent. The inferiority of colonised people was genetic and not cultural. A
view which differed in degree, but not in substance, from the Nazi concept of
race.
Read the popular fiction of those Empire days, still very much in our public
libraries. Agatha Christie wrote a book Ten Little Niggers. Her non-white
characters are, shall we say, invariably dubious. She was also a rabid
anti-Semite. So was John Buchan, author of the 39 Steps.
Some of Britain's most revered twentieth-century poets were anti-Semitic and
racist. There are existing photographs, taken this century, of official British
posters, in the coastal towns of China, which state: ``Dogs and Chinese not
allowed on these premises.''
British writers and film-makers glorified villains like Cecil Rhodes, who went
into the African hinterland with a gang of mercenaries, armed with the latest
machine guns and cannons, and slaughtered all who stood in their way. Rhodes
gave vast tracts of land, and the people who lived on the land, to his
henchmen. Mineral rights he kept mostly to himself.
Queen Victoria blessed his deeds. He became a national hero. Rhodes and his
gang did to a big chunk of Africa what Al Capone and his mob did later to
Chicago. They split it up among themselves. Each had his own territory. The
bigger rackets, which transcended the individual territories, were bossed by
Cecil, as with Al in the windy city.
But even Al baulked at calling Chicago, Caponeville. But Cecil's backers, back
home in the mother country, for whom he was making an awful lot of bucks, had
no such inhibitions. They called a vast area of Africa Rhodesia, which for
sheer chauvinist arrogance takes some beating. Clive more or less did the same
kind of dirty deeds on the Indian subcontinent.
The question to be answered is simple and to the point. Can it be true that a
people brainwashed for centuries by the implicit and explicit racism of Empire
are now completely free of even the vestiges of racism, due to the principled
leadership of successive governments that made all of us come to terms with the
negative and shameful features of our past? The answer has to be, it isn't
true. Just think again of the last night at the Proms.
The British Empire pioneered the concept of the concentration camp in Southern
Africa. The Nazis turned the concept into a grotesque obscenity. Britain, which
played such a noble part in the defeat of German fascism, demanded, along with
our allies, that the German nation and German people should acknowledge their
guilt.
It would do us no harm and a helluva lot of good to acknowledge our own guilt.
Britain has contributed to the racial divisions which have torn mankind apart
in this century. Ask any of our political leaders to confront this problem and
they'll run a mile.
Paul Robeson was one of the finest human beings I've ever known. He was
profoundly ashamed of one episode in his life. In the 1930s, when he was living
in London, he was talked into doing a movie. It was about a noble young native
chief and an even nobler British governor. It was shot in bits and pieces. When
he saw the finished product, Paul was devastated.
It was pernicious racism. Good noble savage. Bad noble savage. Wise,
strong-minded, English pukka sahib, who is fair, and treats natives, of all
ages, as children. The racial paternalism was deeply offensive and poisonous.
He tried to buy the film to burn it, so that it could never be shown. What
particularly appalled him was that some of his English friends thought there
was nothing wrong with the movie. To them racism was the Ku Klux Klan.
There is more to racism than the crudities of overt fascism. In a sense that is
more easily dealt with. After 1945 none but the evil or chronically ignorant
could identify with the racism of the National Front or the British National
Party.
But there are many levels of racism. One of my favourite television programes
is Dad's Army. Corporal Jones regularly regales his comrades with stories about
how the fuzzy wuzzies didn't like cold English-steel bayonets stuck up their
jacksies. His stories implied that the English Tommy did.
If Corporal Jones met a black man on the street we know he is more likely to
give him a black pudding, no pun intended, from his butcher's shop, than a kick
up the backside. But if Corporal Jones was a member of the Labour Party, and he
might well have been, and this black man was nominated for selection as a
Labour candidate, then Corporal Jones would not vote for him.
He might not say much, for he is, after all, a decent old cove who doesn't want
to offend anyone. But a black councillor or MP wouldn't sound or feel right to
him. It is difficult to come to terms with this kind of racism, for it is
ingrained and quiet, and resides in people who are otherwise reasonable.
Was there overt racism in Govan Labour's selection procedures? Definitely not.
It would not have been tolerated. But racism has many levels. As a member of
the Labour Party in the Govan constituency I became aware that all who had
approached me in support of Mike Watson, who is a very good man, were white,
university graduates, Christians, comfortably middle-class and with settled
careers. Comfortable is the word. And all of them good people.
They had a natural affinity with Mike, who was white, a university graduate,
Christian, comfortably middle-class, and who thought he had a settled career in
politics, until his constituency disappeared due to boundary changes. They
identified with Mike's career predicament. They were veterans of the Vietnam
marches, student politics of bygone decades, and their chat was no longer a
call to arms, but a substitute for action.
They have cruelly been called the chattering classes, but there is an element
of truth in it. Sarwar moved not in their circles, nor they in his.
Professionally they are miles apart. Cash and Carry, even on the grand scale,
is, for them a jumped-up Barras.
The chasm between such people and Sarwar is more cultural than political. The
cultural in this context can have slight racial undertones trembling in the
background.
Mohammad Sarwar's natural affinity is with current community activists. The
richest man around, he wears his wealth well, undemonstratively, and he moves
easily among the poor, which isn't surprising, for he knows about poverty,
having sampled it first-hand, at its rawest, in the Third World.
Having said that, I'm not certain that Sarwar would be a better MP than Mike
Watson, and I'm not certain he wouldn't. We mortals have to take decisions
without the benefit of certitude, which is the prerogative of the gods.
One thing is certain, politics has to rise above the subjective if it's to see
the way forward, and you can't do this without principles, which are our
guiding stars. The electoral loyalty of Asians has given Labour more than 20
seats in the UK. But to treat an ethnic minority as voting fodder is a form of
racism, and is unprincipled electoral opportunism. Sarwar should have been
elected as Labour's standard bearer in Govan, not in spite of being an Asian,
but because he is an Asian.
This was the only principle at stake in this selection ballot. Labour is
concerned that there aren't more women Labour MPs and decided, rightly or
wrongly, on all-women shortlists in certain constituencies, to ``improve the
gender balance''.
There are no Asian Labour MPs at all. Is racial balance given no priority by
the Labour Party? That is how it looks, and as a consequence Labour could now
lose Govan. Without the Asian vote, it might also lose Hillhead. The
realisation that there won't be a single Asian candidate standing for Labour at
the next election is now known by Asians throughout the UK. If they say, enough
is enough, then Labour could lose a lot more seats.
This mess was predictable and predicted, by myself, and others. Parliamentary
seats were at stake, but much more important, a principle was at stake. A
multi-racial society needs multi-racial political parties.
Labour's history and traditions are for the unity of peoples. It was a Labour
government that dismantled the Empire. People from the former colonies know
this, and look upon Labour as their party. Just as the Irish did, when driven
by famine, in years past, to our shores.
I know current leaders of the party are not too keen on old Labour traditions
and are getting shot of them, right, left and centre, but mostly left. Some of
these traditions became what could be called our birthright.
I believe in the unity of all races and creeds for a better way of life and a
more just society is part of my birthright as a Scot and a member of the
Scottish Labour Movement. Part of my reaction to the events of last week was
shame. We had once again betrayed an important part of our heritage.

Our antiquated licensing laws were given a much-needed boost, thanks to one
eminent doctor. But, says Jack McLean, it's high time the job was completed
Temperance ladies were, in fact, supplying taverns with a livelihood in the
illicit trafficking in alcohol
A WEE while back I was on Radio Scotland talking about the public house
licensing laws, absurd as they are, and the young researcher couldn't quite
grasp what I was saying. It was about licensing laws and the Clayson Committee
Report.
Dr Christopher Clayson was a chest doctor, indeed a former president of the
Royal College of Physicians, and a very unlikely champion of topers like
myself. He is now damned near a hundred, and though no teetotaller, is not a
heavy tippler.
Yet it was Lord Clayson who changed the world of licensing; for Dr Clayson
produced a report which said that there could be such a thing as civilised
drinking in Scotland. He started his report in 1971 and eventually finished in
1976. It took more than four years to implement even a part of it. Indeed, much
of Clayson's proposals remain on hold.
The licensing laws in Scotland, and especially in the west industrial belt,
were much informed by temperance societies' zeal. The British Women's
Temperance Association, which adopted a white ribbon as its symbol and was
known ever after as White Ribboneers, once held sell-out meetings all over
Britain, and perhaps their most glorious hour was in 1895 when 80,000 women
turned out at the Albert Hall in London. These silly ladies should have known
better. They were, in fact, through the agency of their long-suffering
husbands, supplying the many owners of taverns, many of them in fact women,
with a very lively, well, livelihood in the illicit trafficking in alcohol.
Sabbath drinking is to this day forbidden in many parts of the Western Isles,
as a result of which the continued presence of the ``bothans'' - basically
shebeens - sees to it that Sabbatarian drunkenness is still prevalent in the
Western Isles. Do not listen to the Wee Free clergy or the community leaders in
Barra or Lewis. I could get a drink there on a Sunday quicker than I could in
Glasgow, believe me. Certainly in the early eighties even we had hotels only,
places in which you could only order alcohol if you were a bona fide traveller.
You had to sign a book with your name and address. Thus there were such
signatures as ``R Hood, Sherwood Forest'', and ``M Mouse, Hollywood''.
And how about Glasgow? I can assure you that here if I want a spot of the amber
after closing time it would not give me a moment's thought. The habit of most
publicans and bar staff of having a quiet wee relaxing half hour or so after a
long and busy day is well known, as is the wee invitation to a few selected and
favoured customers to join them. The after-hours, the overtime, the lock-in,
call it what you will, is still, technically, against the law.
Indeed the law often seems ludicrously zealous in the exercise of it when it
comes to licensing. As radio presenter Tom Morton put it not so long ago in the
programme for which I was a most distinguished contributor: ``If it was the
drinking that was the problem why don't the police turn up at your own door
when you are starting on your carry-out, demanding your presence outside and
locking you up.'' How can you be permitted the strong liquor on your own but
not in good company?
Around the turn of the century came many a piece of legislation; 1915 saw more
of it when Lloyd George curtailed any drinking in the afternoon (he thought it
would boost industrial production). By the time I became a drinker Scotland had
two things: the most draconian hours for the sale of liquor on licensed
premises in the Western world, and the worst alcohol problem as well. Scotland
continues to suffer from the highest rates of alcohol-related deaths in Europe
(oddly Ireland has one of the lowest because of the large numbers of
non-alcohol swallowers in that country), and Clayson's proposals were an
attempt to stem the awesome tide of alcohol-induced problems. By and large they
have worked.
Yet large parts of Scotland continue to be horribly uncivilised. Clayson wanted
family pubs, places where, as one would find anywhere in Europe, children could
go to any cafe or restaurant and their parents would have a strega or a cognac
or a glass of wine with a meal; places in which children took alcohol for
granted and their parents took theirs sensibly. Clayson's proposals were
dreadfully sensible.
Clayson proffered a new era. He wanted places in which alcohol could be offered
but there ``would be no public bar or table service, simply cafes where parents
could take their children''. It was all part of the idea of introducing
children to alcohol under parental control in a public place. The conditions
recommended for the recognition of such suitable pubs were not even debated.
``The Secretary of State for Scotland (the then somewhat Calvinistic Willie
Ross) said of children in the public bar that this would not be in line with
current Scottish practices. Well, of course we knew that. But we were planning
for 25 years or more ahead''.
It is now more than 25 years ahead. Drunkenness has subsided amazingly, (don't
listen to alarming reports of alcohol-induced acts of violence: there is
considerably less drunkenness, just a lot more violence, and no matter what a
variety of lobbies say the truth is that drugs are to blame for far more crime
than a night in the pub). The tendency towards all-out prohibition is still
strong in Scotland, and certainly in Glasgow and the west. Clayson wanted a
clearer view of alcohol use, and most certainly a clearer one of unacceptable
abuse. Irish children find little difficulty with the proximity of a nearby
pub, Europeans see no problem. The days are perhaps over in Scotland, or in
most of her cities, when licensed permises were glazed over with curtains and
dark windows, and a glamourous prurience.
Dr Clayson set off to destroy the business of licensing laws which established
the Scottish practice of heavy drinking, the carry-outs after 10pm (in my young
days it was 9.30pm closing and the tables were groaning with last-minute rounds
of beer and spirits bought), the culture of drinking till you dropped.
But Clayson, and after all he is a Scot, with the baggage of temperance and
moderation and excess upon him, got it wrong.
A few years ago he said he was mystified as to why licensing authorities had
allowed these hours to extend in the first place. He said: ``My committee's
original proposal was for the hours to run from 11am to 11pm and exceptions
were to be rigidly controlled.''
Clayson said, back in the early 1970s, that we have traditionally examined our
drinking and licensing laws every 10 years or so. We are now a quarter of a
century on from Clayson. Clayson made life a lot more civilised. (Not least for
publicans and bar staff who at last had shorter, and not longer hours, for the
split shift of an afternoon was grim.) But the time has surely come, after the
best and most continental summer Scotland has seen in more than 50 years, to
think again.
It is not really for you or me or anybody else, and most certainly not some
half-jaked politician, to decide when you eat or drink or sell food or alcohol
on the basis of what you or myself or it thinks is acceptable. Frankly a lot of
people, especially our amazed European visitors, find the blanket closure of
this city less worthy than any puritanical nonsense thought up by churches,
magistrates, and a police force quite so incapable of looking after citizens
that their first response is to send perfectly decent people to their beds
early, while incapable of policing the handful of people determined upon
delinquency, whatever age they may be.
Clayson and his report helped Glasgow to shift into the later part of this
century. New ways of approach are needed now. And why is the United Kindom not
looking abroad, in any way at all?

AMEN Corner was once the name of a pop group but I believe that its origins lie
in the Deep South of America, in black churches. It is a function akin to that
of a precentor in presbyterian churches which do not rely upon an organ to lead
singing.
However, those who occupy Amen Corner lead response to the sermon by
interjecting shouts of ``Amen'' or ``Hallelujah'' or other words of assent at
appropriate moments during the sermon, rather in the way that MPs shout ``hear,
hear'' during Front Bench speeches in the House of Commons. It has the effect
of whipping up an atmosphere of support for the speaker, and has been adopted
by many white churches who follow the charismatic tradition.
In these churches they tend to say things like ``Praise the Lord!'' as well as
the more routine Hallelujahs or Amens. Perhaps I have just not been saying the
right things in my sermons but apart from the rustling of sweetie papers in the
choir seats, I have yet to be interrupted by a chorus from Amen Corner. Until
this week, that is.
It wasn't quite an outbreak of mass hysteria. You can't count eight old ladies
taking communion in a back room at an old folks' home as a mass - even if one
of them turned out to be an RC.
Four sat quietly, two were stolen away by Morpheus during the communion service
but had the decency not to snore. The other two joined in the service as a
chorus, reciting the scripture reading along with me and the words of the
communion service.
I should mention that their participation was not of the off-putting ``echo''
style, in which they simply repeated what I was saying and finished a fraction
behind me. They actually knew the words and said them at the same time. Since
we are not strong on responses in my part of the Reformed tradition, I must
confess to wondering where they acquired the habit.
Rather than putting me off, it contributed a strong sense of communion to the
occasion.
Elderly people who are less aware of day-to-day events, often have clear recall
in respect of long-term memory, and this was obviously the case with my old
ladies in the nursing home. They reminded me of an important truth that we
often neglect - that we all have within us mental resources from the past which
can be invoked to brighten our reality in the present.
Too often we think of memory or the past as something which has gone for ever,
never to be recalled. Certainly we all know people who live too much in the
past, but what I am talking about is the capability to invoke memory to assist
us in the present.
In one way, Christmas provides a strong example of this. We enjoy it now, in
the present but most of us are susceptible to the memory of our Christmases in
the past. Watching children open their presents, or singing Away in a Manger,
or walking timidly up to Santa. There is magic and there is romance in the
present moment which has the stardust of memory sprinkled upon it.
As stated elsewhere on this page, one of the strengths of Christmas is that it
provides a common culture for a society which has fragmented into groups with
vastly different interests. This process is paralleled in science which has
succumbed to the disease of reductionism, resulting in scientists being unable
to explain their subject with others because the language, jargon, and
specialities have so little in common.
It affects not only science but the social sciences. Personally I find some of
the documents which emanate from social work departments to be as
incomprehensible as they must find some of the theology texts which are
produced by my colleagues in divinity faculties. Yet we are supposed to be
addressing different aspects of the human condition.
Even worse is the reductionist approach to compassion. Bureaucratised into
statutory care, privatised into businesses, or politicised into partisan
interests, there are glaring divides within the human agencies which look
askance at one another.
The NHS/social work leviathan is castigated or canonised depending on your
point of view. Private care agencies are treated with suspicion or seen as the
solution of all ills, according to prejudice. Charities float in and out of
this landscape trying to run with both fox and hounds - and who can blame them?
But some charities or church committees or political groups want to claim that
one particular way of dealing with human issues is morally superior. I get
pretty exasperated with any group which tells me that they have a monopoly on
compassion and lectures me for daring to question their solution with awkward
facts.
There is no more a ``right'' solution to poverty or homelessness than there is
one to asylum seekers or hunger in the developing world. But surely there is a
basis for a practical solution in a combination of compassion and common sense.
Is that, after all, another way of defining justice? When I read things that
annoy me in the newspapers, I usually find that either common sense or
compassion is lacking. (Whether it is princesses who want compassion but resist
common sense being applied to their situation; or surgeons who are put on trial
for trying to do their best for patients).
The supreme illustration of this principle is Christmas itself. God showed
compassion for the world by the incarnation, but showed us the value of common
sense in not identifying Himself with any one political solution. I hope that
some of you might say ``amen'' to that. Merry Christmas!

YOU quote Sir Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister, criticising Mr Malcolm
Rifkind as saying of the Tory Party's ambivalent stance anent the current
antics of the European Union, ``There is no merit in isolation, I hope he (Mr
Rifkind) can modify what he has been saying'' (December 11).
No merit in isolation?
Has age so wearied Sir Edward that he does not remember those dark, desperate,
but heroic days between September 3, 1939, and December 8, 1941, that time of
isolation when Eire hedged its bets and fascist Spain did the same, and Festung
Europa (today, slightly modified, the EU) was engaged in exterminating a
complete race of people and a lot of other odds and sods besides, and this
island home of ours, having withstood in the evil days, prevailed - but only
just?
Of course, Sir Edward remembers those days in which he played his own part to
the full. But does he choose to sweep the legacy of Julius Streicher, that
lives on in those he sired, under the carpet along with that of Irma Greese
(who made lampshades from the flayed bodies of victims taken from the gas
chamber after they were put to death)?
Sir Edward is a pragmatist who prefers to swallow the past's camels wholesale
whilst straining at today's gnats, of which I am one, for the past to me is
still very real, albeit I came to terms with it long ago.
The French, ever a down-to-earth people, pragmatists to a man (or woman), have
a saying, ``Plus que ca change, plus que c'est la meme chose'' - something I
believe fervently.
To whichever ethos Sir Edward may choose to cleave, I myself am a friend of
nearly every individual European of whichever nationality - but no mess of
European pottage can attract, far less buy, my fealty, come what may, and be
damned to ``Frres Jacques'' Santer et Delors, not to mention Master Tony Blair
and his sycophants.

<HEADLINE>New twist to girl's murder inquiry Police investigating death of teenager Mhairi Julyan question victims of obscene phone calls</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974749753</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
OBSCENE telephone calls were made to school friends of murdered Kilmarnock
teenager Mhairi Julyan shortly before her death. At least four girls were
pestered by the caller, who claimed to know them intimately and referred to
them by their first name.
The calls were all received in the week leading up to Mhairi's murder. One
teenager was subjected to such a call on Sunday - the day detectives discovered
the body of the 16-year-old Kilmarnock Academy schoolgirl in a bus garage yards
from her home.
Another teenager, who received a telephone call four days before Mhairi's
death, lives in a house overlooking the garage where the attack took place.
Police, who revealed this week that Mhairi's murder was sexually motivated, are
questioning the girls about the calls. All are in their early teens and attend
the same school as Mhairi.
One mother said: ``The caller sounded mature and we think he was calling from a
mobile phone as there was a lot of crackling in the background. He asked if my
daughter was still wearing her school uniform then he suggested something
obscene. She slammed the phone down.
``We never thought anything about it until my daughter discovered other girls
at her school were getting the same calls. One girl has been phoned twice by
him.''
Detectives are reluctant to confirm whether they are linking the calls to
Mhairi's murder but say one line of inquiry is being followed up.
Christmas Day prayers will be said for the family of Mhairi. Pleas will also be
made from the pulpit for anyone who has information, or who may be shielding
her killer, to come forward.
As the murder hunt entered its fifth day yesterday, police revealed that
although they had no lead, several women had come forward to say they may have
been followed on Kilmarnock's London Road, where Mhairi was last seen alive.
Officers also said a ``tremendous'' amount of information was flooding in on an
unprecedented scale from the public, showing how the community had united in a
bid to trap the murderer.
Superintendant Louis Munn of Strathclyde Police said: ``I don't recall any
major incident where so many members of the public have responded in such a
positive way. This has really gelled the community.''
Police have traced a caller who may be the last witness to have seen Mhairi
walking home. They have also interviewed a young woman who described a man who
followed her in London Road three days before Mhairi vanished.
Christmas leave has been cancelled for key officers on the murder inquiry, but
Mr Munn said no-one was complaining. ``Christmas will not be a very happy time
for the Julyan family,'' he said. ``We've all got to appreciate this is a
terrible crime.''
The Rev Tom Jarvie, school chaplain at Kilmarnock Academy and Minister of
Riccarton Parish Church, said: ``We will be remembering them in our prayers on
Christmas Day, as will the whole of the presbytery.
``I will certainly make an appeal for anyone who has information, however
small, to come forward.''
Mr Jarvie also revealed that young schoolgirls were now ``shattered and
frightened'' and many would only go out in pairs. ``I heard one of the wee
girls has bought one of those panic bleepers, and she's only 15,'' he added.
Mhairi vanished after leaving the Sleeping Beauty pantomime at Kilmarnock's
Palace Theatre on Saturday night. On Sunday her body was found in a bus depot
close to her home in Samson Avenue. Police described the attack as
``particularly brutal and savage''.

HE case that Clare Henry makes for the damaging effect of cuts in the National
Galleries' purchase grant is a telling one (December 19).
Without the ability to provide matching funding neither the National Museums
(purchase grant cut by 57%) nor the Galleries can make effective use of the new
money available from the Lottery. And the vital acquisition of inexpensive but
important historical and scientific material will become impossible.
I wish that her vision of plenty at the National Museums was equally
well-founded. In fact, the #32.5m for the Museum of Scotland, which she refers
to as a Christmas bonanza, is the same #30m that was allocated to the project
in 1990, adjusted for inflation.
And the National Museums, unlike the National Galleries, have had their running
cost grant cut from #11.126m in 1995/96 to #10.702m in 1996/97 at a time when,
as she rightly says, we are having to devote a great deal of time and money to
preparing for the new museum.
Finally, I don't think that the National Audit Office report found us on an
elitist high horse. The survey which the NAO commissioned reports that ``the
Museums are successful in attracting visitors from virtually all sectors of the
population'', including a higher proportion of those in socio-economic groups
C2, D, and E, than any other museum or gallery that I know of.

Director, National Museums of Scotland,

IF you are one of those people who see the turn of the year as a time to review
your investments and think about policies for the year ahead, remember the
comment by Mark Twain. He listed the ``most dangerous'' months for investors on
the Stock Exchange. He put them in higglety-pigglety order but they added up to
12.
With Wall Street and London having hit a series of peaks in the run-up to
Christmas, it would be surprising indeed if the coming year did not see a fair
bit of volatility in share prices. Some people will decide to cash in fat
profits; others will be buying on the view that there is more to come. The
trick will be to decide if a setback is merely a blip in a continuing upward
pattern and, therefore, a buying opportunity, or if it is the start of a longer
reversal of market fortunes.
Wall Street gave a sharp reminder this week that prices can drop quite rapidly
if anything looks like upsetting sentiment. The quick recovery after interest
rates were lowered by the now fashionable quarter point showed both how vital
interest rates are and how willing the buyers are, for the time being at least,
to remain loyal to shares.
We seem to be in a low growth environment, with the financial authorities
prepared to take action to avoid a slip into a no growth or reverse growth one.
Inflation looks like staying low and the tiny cuts in interest rates have
persuaded the markets that there is more to come. So, in spite of the latter's
high levels, the bulls out-number the bears by a fair margin.
One of the bulls is Ian Harnett, an economist at Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull. Writing in the latest edition of ProShare's Investor magazine, he
sticks his neck out for 4100 on the FTSE-100 index in 1996 and for Wall Street
to continue its upward march.
Mark White, investment director at Save &amp; Prosper, is a little more cautious.
With an eye on the interest rate trend, he predicts the Footsie should ``climb
towards the 3800 mark''.
So far as individual shares are concerned, he says that with the economists
predicting consumers will be spending a bit more, sectors such as brewing and
retail should lead the way. Political worries may put utilities among the
laggards. Mr White spotlights the attractions of a better-than-average income
when he makes his selection among his group's units for people wanting to
invest in the UK. He picks its High Yield fund which invests mainly in UK
blue-chip companies.
The December survey of fund managers carried out for broker Merrill Lynch also
showed 54% of them prefer the larger companies, a marginal increase from 53% in
the November survey. On a three-month basis they were more optimistic about UK
shares than they had been in November, 40% against 27%, but were more cautious
on a 12-month basis with only 35% bullish.
Japan was top of the pops with 67% optimistic on a three-month forecast and 78%
on a 12-month prediction.
Save &amp; Prosper's Rod Birkett, who runs its Japan Growth fund, predicts Japanese
shares will ``continue to benefit from strong corporate earnings growth, lax
monetary conditions and strong buying by overseas investors''.
The Japanese government is still demonstrating its determination to solve the
crisis in the financial and banking sector there and get the economy moving
from a position of virtually no growth this year. Japan will, it is hoped, be
one of the main forces keeping the world's economies on a growth path in the
coming year.
If you have interests in Europe, the year does not look particularly exciting.
A number of governments are cutting spending to meet Maastricht targets and the
economic slowdown looks like continuing. Analysts have been trimming their
forecasts for UK company earnings and the same is happening in continental
Europe.
Although Germany remains the most powerful force, professional investors
continue to prefer France, even though their confidence has been weakened a
little by the industrial problems sparked by Prime Minister Juppe's spending
cuts.
Emerging markets have been a disappointment this year - none have managed to
beat the impressive and not very well forecast performance of Wall Street.
Maybe they will do better next year. Analysts at Bank of America are hopeful
for Mexico, whose problems reversed the rise and rise of emerging markets as a
whole. They are not too worried about the success of the Communists in Russia
and think Turkey should make progress after its forthcoming general election.
The Save &amp; Prosper team says emerging market share prices are ``attractive not
only in comparison to developed markets but in absolute terms also''.
The members cite Poland, which is on a price-earnings ratio of around six to
seven times the profits projected for 1996, and also point to India, ``valued
at an historically low 13 times''. China is reckoned to have overcome the
problem of rising inflation and this should ``help to improve confidence in the
long-term prospects of what is the world's most exciting emerging market
story''.
Looking at emerging markets as a whole, it is reckoned that while share buyers
have been unenthusiastic, direct investment by multi-national corporations
continues with a record of more than $100bn being committed to these areas
during the year.
Investors will almost certainly need cool nerves in 1996. More than ever it
will be important to keep a close eye on the markets. Mr Harnett, bearing in
mind that people traditionally worry when prices keep hitting new peaks,
suggests there is no reason to fear a crash unless the Footsie reaches 4500 and
the Dow Jones 6000 by the end of next year.
He warns: ``If everybody starts to get positive about equity markets all at
once it is probably time to get out.'' Mark Twain would, one imagines, agree
with him.

q Having recently been made redundant I have had to carefully consider all my
outgoings, and it is clear that I cannot continue to pay the premiums on a
10-year endowment policy I took out in 1989. I have been advised against
cashing in by the insurance company, but what else can I do if I cannot keep up
the payments?
n There are alternatives to cashing in the policy. You could consider making it
paid up and you will not then be required to pay further premiums. It will
mature as expected in 1999 but at a reduced value. You may, of course, have an
urgent need for the cash and if this is the case, a further alternative to
surrendering the policy would be to sell it on the second-hand market.
To evaluate these options ask your insurance company to quote the present
surrender value and to estimate the value on maturity if it is now made paid up.
q I have been grateful for your financial advice in the past. I believe I am in
a comfortable position at my mid-thirties having 13 years remaining on a
#60,000 endowment mortgage, provision set aside for the children's university
education, good company pension arrangements, and reasonable life assurance via
endowment/savings plans.
You previously gave me advice to follow investment trusts. I make small monthly
contributions to Foreign &amp; Colonial and Murray Smaller Markets. I now have
about #200 a month to invest, and I would be obliged if you would advise me of
the best investment products in today's market. I am guided towards a MIP with
Allied Dunbar.
n You seem well set up, and so long as you are sure you have done all you can
to ensure a good company pension, you should stick with the beast that you know.
Your investments with Foreign &amp; Colonial and Murray Smaller Markets should be
paying dividends, especially with you choosing monthly contributions to build
up your holdings. You may be interested to know that Foreign &amp; Colonial has
just become a constituent of the FTSE-100 share index and that its shares
gained additional value in anticipation of this.
For the small investor, internationally diversified investment trusts remain
the best method of building up capital, especially in the early stages. Other
trusts you might care to try are Alliance Trust in Dundee, Martin Currie's
Scottish Eastern in Edinburgh, and Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage, also in
Edinburgh.
You can subscribe to all of these through monthly contributions. You might,
therefore, like to spread your #200 around these and step up your contributions
to Foreign &amp; Colonial and Murray Smaller Markets.
At a later stage, when you have built up your capital and your financial
position has been further improved by paying off your mortgage, you might like
to think of investment through personal equity plans, assuming they still exist.
q The Chancellor has just increased the threshold for inheritance tax from the
previous rate of #154,000 to #200,000. What would be the position in the case
of a relative's will when, say, the person had died prior to this change, for
example in September, and yet the solicitor says the estate will not be settled
until the middle of 1996 at the very earliest?
n The nil rate band applies to chargeable transfers at the date the transfer is
made. On the death of a person inheritance tax is chargeable as if they had
made a chargeable transfer of the estate immediately before they died. The
estate is valued for tax purposes at that date and the rates of tax in force at
that time are applied. This includes the amount of nil rate band and,
therefore, the date of settlement of the estate is irrelevant for this purpose.
q I have received literature from Invesco regarding its new corporate bond PEP
called High Income Investment with an estimated 8.5% interest rate. If my
memory serves me correctly I think some time ago you advised caution on
investing in corporate bonds. The rate of interest appears to be higher than
the average offered just now and, as I have an old investment maturing soon, I
would be obliged if you would advise me if you consider this a good choice or
whether I should go for something else.
If your advice is against Invesco, would you please give me your preference for
investment for income. I am retired and pay income tax at the standard rate.
n Corporate bond PEPs are fine as part of an income portfolio which includes
other risk-free investments. But it would be unwise for any investor to have
all of his or her money in them.
The problem with corporate bond PEPs is that they are not free from risk,
though they are less risky than straight investment in shares. If interest
rates go up and/or the stock market falls, the value of the bonds will also
drop, leaving you with a potential capital loss.
Generally speaking, the higher the yield, the less likely it is that the
capital will be maintained. If you want to be on the safe side, you could
choose a lower-yielding PEP such as that offered by Whittingdale &amp; Co (0171 623
2444), which has a better risk profile than most.
q Over the past three years, the company I work for has had to suspend pension
premiums due to various circumstances. It is now in a position to restart
contributions to my pension fund. I will retire in six years. In view of the
timescale, would an AVC be the best place for the contributions or should they
be placed in PEPs or a Tessa? If the pension is advised is there a point when
further AVCs at a later date are not justified by the annual amount received.
n It is difficult to give a full reply without knowing more details. It would
seem unlikely that your company would allow you to choose how its contributions
will be applied. In any case, they could not be used for a PEP or Tessa because
tax relief would be lost.
If it is a final salary scheme then the contributions will automatically go
into the pension fund. If it is a money purchase scheme, where a pot of money
builds up for each employee to buy a pension on retirement, or the company
contributes towards your personal pension plan, then there is no point
considering an AVC which is essentially the same thing.
An AVC is an extra voluntary contribution made by the employee which may or may
not be connected to the main scheme. It is used to augment the pension
available from the main company scheme.
q During 1994-95 my company car was off the road for a seven-week period
following an accident. During that time I had to travel by public transport
both to and from work and while on my employer's business as he would not hire
a car for me on a temporary basis. My notice of coding for 1994-95 included a
car benefit for the full year. Am I due a tax repayment on the scaled down
benefit and, if so, how do I claim it?
n On the information supplied your car benefit will be scaled down to
316/365ths of the normal figure. Scaling down of benefits is possible where the
car was incapable of being used at all throughout a period of at least 30
consecutive days.
As you have been taxed on the full benefit you will be due a repayment. Write
to your Inspector of Taxes explaining why you think a repayment is due and ask
him or her to issue a schedule E assessment. It may be worth checking first
that your employer has reported the correct information on the year-end return
form P11D as otherwise your repayment will be delayed until the benefit is
sorted out.
q It was in my mind to invest #10,000 each for my nephew's children who were
born in 1993 and 1995. I would want them to get the total amount when they
reach 21 years of age.
n Over such a timescale an investment in equities would produce the highest
return and well-established investment trusts with a consistent track record
would fit the bill admirably. You could divide each #10,000 and put equal
amounts into Alliance, Bankers, Foreign &amp; Colonial and English &amp; Scottish.
The share certificates should be issued to you (or somebody else) as nominee to
hold for the child as beneficiary. Then tax on the dividends could be reclaimed
if the income fell within the child's personal allowance. Each of the children
could then expect to receive a handsome nest egg when the time came.

Sex Appeal Rating: HHH
Product: Jean Paul Gaultier
Price: Eau de Toilette Spray #35 (50ml), #50 (100ml); Parfum #98 (30ml)

smell edible, like a French pastry. Product comes in a blank soup tin. Top half
of the bottle is sculpted into the shape of a woman's body in a bustiere
David: Is that a tin of Spam?
Lesley: A masculine packaging, but a very feminine bottle inside. The perfume
looks like pink champagne. The feminists would go mad, that a woman's body has
been used in this commercial way. It reminds me of vanilla, of home-baking. For
office girls, safe and nice.
Naila: Ostentatious but humorous. This is humid, dizzy and motherly, like
tropical flowers from the Botanic Gardens in Glasgow. I can imagine big women
wearing it.
David: If you think of the various perfume bottles over the years, this is very
different. The scent calms down nicely. I'd like this on a woman's neck.
Sex Appeal Rating: HH
Product: Gio by Giorgio Armani
Price: Starts at #19.95 for 30ml, then #23.50 and #35
Description: Bog-standard Italian effort. For women, but our panel thought it
was an aftershave.
Naila: Talcum powder, nae class. I wouldn't trust a man who smelt like this.
Lesley: It hasn't any layers, a monotonous smell, very synthetic. You'd imagine
deadly nightshade smelling like this. Unsettling.

maternal smell. I like it, although it reminds me of Fahrenheit aftershave.

shaped product is ``water suspended in pure, transparent glass''.
David: This looks like a specimen bottle and smells like a sauna cabin before
you turn on the heat.
Lesley: It looks like one of the Three Wise Men. It smells of Creamola Foam or
sherbet. It's very light. You used to call this toilet water. A man would smell
clean wearing it.
Naila: The bottle reminds me of a weapon. It brings back memories of a
ski-resort I once visited. It has a chemical smell, quite refreshing like an
alpine forest.
Sex Appeal rating: H
Product: Dolce Vita
Price: #33 (50ml) and #49
Description: A pleasant eau de toilette for women.
David: Smells like an aftershave and lasts a while.

Price: #17.50 for 50ml Parfum
Description: Reasonably cheap if not inspiring flowery scent for women.
Naila: Ooof, detergent. This reminds me of doggy shampoo.
David: Someone's got a sense of humour. This is stinking. Smells like wood
resin. It's getting worse, I'm going to wash my hands.
Lesley: Raw, it hits you right on the nose.
Sex Appeal Rating: Nope.
Product: L'Eau d'Issey pour homme by Issey Miyake
Price: After Shave #24 (100ml), Eau de Toilette Spray #38 (125ml)

It smells rancid, like lard or fat.
Lesley: It smells like human sweat. Maybe it's intended as an aphrodisiac.
David: You could use the bottle as a wedge for the door.
n.Many Thanks to our panel of consumers; David Ewing, Naila Khan and Lesley

<RECORDNO>974749760</RECORDNO>

THE English vicar who thought he was being honest and open with the children in
his church in telling them recently that Father Christmas does not exist, soon
found out that such simple truths are far from simple. He was verbally
snowballed by irate parishioners who did not want their Christmas myth to be
melted by such brutal facts. Moderators or bishops who have cast doubt upon the
Virgin Birth or the details of the Christmas story have faced similar
hostility, even from those who would consider themselves to be fairly
sceptical. When they approach Christmas, they must tread gently, for they tread
upon the thin ice of ancient myth and hallowed tradition. Underneath lies icy
disapproval for having broken the common ground upon which so much of our
Christmas celebrations depend. Many of the elements which go to make up
traditional Christmas come directly from the Bible stories of the incarnation
and involve shepherds, angels, a stable etc. Others are products of pagan
mythology such as Yule logs, fir trees, and reindeer. The wise men with their
reliance on astrology seem to have a foot in both camps.
Far from being irreconcilable, these differing traditions have made common
ground in Christmas. Christianity took over and then embraced the pagan
traditions. Now we are witnessing a second wave of syncretism, in which secular
society has embraced the Christian symbols. Hymns are played incessantly in
supermarkets, while jokey advent calendars featuring pop-open windows of a
distinctly non-religious nature sell alongside the more pious originals. This
marriage of convenience is a strong and mutually beneficial alliance. Those who
wish the holy event to be given prominence are aided by the galaxy of marketing
and sales promotion geared to Christmas. They can insist, with integrity, that
we should not lose touch with the original meaning and uphold the spiritual
values of Christmas. Those who simply want to warm the chill darkness of the
winter solstice by eating, drinking, and making merry, are assisted so to do by
the ritual meal which is integral to Christmas. Many of them will even find
themselves in a church on Christmas Eve bellowing out hymns about being
``begotten not created''. Even if their essential beliefs or motives are very
different, both groups are able to profit from the activities of the other.
This may go some way to explain why debunking clerics are deplored by those
whom they seek to liberate from the mists of mythology. We want the mystique of
Christmas and we are prepared to suspend our critical faculties in order to
keep it. Rather than deplore this state of affairs, we should look carefully at
the benefits it brings, not only to the religious and the revellers. The common
ground of peace and goodwill which Christmas occupies is a window of
opportunity for charities and caring organisations to touch the conscience of
the public. In our increasingly fragmented culture, it is one of the few
remaining festivals which command near-universal celebration and retain the
semblance of a unified society. Christmas goodwill - whether forced or simply
formal - can never go amiss in a divided and uncertain society. Even if it is
ice which covers deep social problems, even if it is thin ice - it is still a
common ground upon which we can join groups, nations, and continents in order
to seek peace and goodwill in a divided world. The freezing weather of winter
creates that opportunity in nature. The celebration of Christmas creates it in
human nature throughout the world. We happily use it as an opportunity to wish
our readers the blessings of Christmas.

A DENTIST drank two bottles of vodka a day and turned to tranquillisers when
his flamboyant life-style became too much for him.
A court heard that Raymond Smith, who amassed a fortune, was unable to cope
with the stress of life in the fast lane and is now a shadow of his former self.
The high flier was not only involved in dentistry but also had interests in
North Sea oil rigs and fishing trawlers.
But when Smith's empire crashed he tried to bolster his earnings by fiddling
claims for the dental work he had carried out, Aberdeen Sheriff Court was told
yesterday.
Over an 18-month period Smith overstated the dental treatment he had given to
68 patients.
While practising in Aberdeen he gave one patient veneers instead of crowns and
claimed he had filled more teeth than he had.
The swindle was uncovered when he submitted the claims for payment to the
Scottish Dental Practice Board in Edinburgh.
Once passed by the SDPB they were then forwarded to Grampian Health Board who
authorise payments to individual dentists.
Smith, 51, who no longer practises and now lives in Garleston-on-Sea, Norfolk,
admitted attempting to defraud Grampian Health Board of #7627.40.
The court was told at an earlier hearing that a number of Smith's patients had
had their mouths examined by dental officers and these revealed discrepancies
in his claims.
The bogus work was carried out between 1989 and 1991 after Smith's business
ventures collapsed, his counsel, Miss Frances McMenamin said.
His surgery had been in Albert Street in the city's West End and he had also
carried out work at Old Mill of Forresterhill, near Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire.
But Smith, who has a long list of ailments and now walks with a stick, had no
recollection of committing the crime, she added.
``Due to his medical and pyschiatric problems he had memory lapses for some
considerable time.
``Not least of which is the fact that at about the time when the offences were
being committed he took two bottles of vodka a day supplemented by valium and
diazepam.
``He got to that stage because he had become such a high flier that he found it
hard to cope with the stresses and strains of continuing this way of life.
``He was not only involved in dentistry, he had interests in oil rigs and he
had interests in trawlers.
``It seemed that he had quite an entrepreneurial skill but in the early 1980s
everything fell apart financially and he became bankrupt.''
Miss McMennamin added that Smith had lost everything and was now dependent on
his wife.
``He cannot remember from one minute to the next what is going on. He has no
recollection of being married or of his wedding,'' added the advocate.
Sheriff Alexander Pollock fined Smith #1500 saying: ``The crime to which you
have pled guilty must be viewed seriously by the court especially as it
involved an attempted fraud on the public purse.
``The court must make clear its disapproval of what you did,'' he said.

THIRTY vehicles in four hours hit the same garden wall after skidding on an icy
Coatbridge road.
Mr Angus Walker, 56, of Horslett Street, watched helplessly as the vehicles
slid sideways down the ungritted hill before coming to a stop when they hit his
wall.
Mr Walker called the council and asked them to grit the road but it took them
four hours to get there.
Mr Walker, said: ``It was like watching dodgems. It wasn't the drivers' fault,
because they were only doing about five miles an hour.
``It's lucky they were going so slowly so there was no real damage done. But if
a car had been coming along my street there could quite easily have been a
crash. Someone could have been seriously hurt.''
He added: ``This is the second time that this has happened. Two years ago a
lorry came right through the wall and caused loads of damage.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said: ``There is an order of
priority for which roads we grit first. That's done on a safety basis.
``Motorways and access to schools and hospitals must take priority.''

BRITAIN'S two leading motoring organisations are sponsoring research to build a
psychological profile of male and female drivers in an effort to reduce
accidents.
Yesterday the Automobile Association announced it has commissioned a University
of Reading professor to examine the different behaviour patterns of men and
women drivers.
Psychology professor Frank McKenna will spend three years analysing the
``gender differences'' in hazard perception, speed, and overtaking.
The aim is to tailor the needs of driving courses to men and women, should
differences emerge, dispel sterotypical myths, and ultimately to prevent
accidents.
The study follows recent RAC-commissioned research into aggressive driving and
a novel stunt this week by its author, Glasgow-based psychologist Conrad King,
to counsel potentially aggressive, violent drivers at motorway service stations.
Back at home in Glasgow yesterday Mr King admitted he was exhausted after his
three-day roadside therapy sessions in the South of England. In service
stations off the M25, M11 in Essex, and the M3 in Hampshire he heard
confessions of aggressive driving including a claim by one driver that he
carried a plastic shotgun in his car to point threateningly at other road users.
The purpose of the exercise was not so much to change attitudes over a coffee -
Mr King says only a series of sessions can achieve results - but to raise
awareness of the issues and to allow stressed-out motorists a chance to let off
steam.
Mr King, who is set to publish a book on aggressive driving in the new year,
said the RAC was planning to submit a proposal to the Home Office for a network
of counsellors able to offer help to those convicted of aggressive driving
offences or involved in an accident.
The freelance psychologist said his research had centred round studies of the
attitudes of people at work and in their cars. There was, he said, a noticeable
increase in the amount of aggression when people got behind the wheel.
``People become more aggressive because they feel like they are in a protected
environment and feel more powerful. Being in a car is like having armour and
can have a dehumanising effect.''
Of his roadside therapy sessions Mr King said: ``I got quite a positive
response. Most people want to talk about other people's driving which is why
it's hard to get them to look at their own.''
His own skills were put to the test when, reluctantly posing on a couch for
press photographers on a slip road, a motorists screeched to a halt beside the
sofa believing he could not get past, instantly becoming irate at the
obstruction. ``He had in fact assessed the situation wrongly and could get
past. I was able to mediate.''

GLASGOW-based Ashbourne is following the lead of US nursing homes groups by
selling and leasing back properties to free up cash for ambitious expansion
plans.
Ashbourne yesterday claimed the first major transaction of this kind in the UK
healthcare sector. It is to raise #16.8m from the sale and lease back of five
of its 25 nursing homes in a deal with Abbey Life Assurance Company.
The proceeds will be used to reduce Ashbourne's gearing to nil and will ensure
the group's development programme can be financed without cash calls on
shareholders.
Abbey Life has purchased Eastwood Court in Giffnock, Glasgow, Warren Park in
Largs, and three other nursing homes in Bromley in Kent, Cardiff and
Leicestershire, which had a combined book value of #14.8m on October 1.
Ashbourne will initially pay aggregate annual rent of #1.65m, on 35-year
leases, with rent reviews every five years.
The nursing homes group will open another development in Middlesex on January
11. It has another four homes under construction and four landbank sites which
have still to be developed.
It is actively seeking further sites near the M25 around London, which it sees
as the major growth area.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the sale and leaseback agreement at an
extraordinary meeting in the new year.
Ashbourne, which last month announced a rise in pre-tax profits from #1.2m to
#6.5m for the year to October 1, envisages that gearing will not rise above 10%
in the current 12 months.
A spokeswoman said: ``When it is offered the right price, Ashbourne is very
keen to do this.
``(Chief executive) Tom Hamilton has looked at the US market and this is the
market which has led the way on this. Most US nursing homes groups work on the
sale and leaseback principle because it provides them with the cash to build
more homes without having to go back to the shareholders.''
Ashbourne is disappointed about the dearth of property investment trusts
covering the UK nursing homes sector because this would provide another avenue
for sale and leaseback agreements. Such trusts are more common in the US.
Shares in Ashbourne, a management buy-out from hotels and casinos company
Stakis in 1993, yesterday lost 1p to 132p.

<HEADLINE>Area's milk may be marketed on its unrivalled qualities Ayrshire's cream of the crop</HEADLINE>

THE Ayrshire Cattle Society's confidence that its breed produces the best milk
has been confirmed by market research as part of a study into the prospects for
a niche-market promotion of Ayrshire milk.
Cambridge Market Research used six countrywide consumer panels involving 49
housewives. In taste, health, and overall impression Ayrshire milk came out
with a top score of 39 out of 50. Any score over 36 is assessed to be a very
good product.
In a ``blind'' tasting using three milks, Ayrshire came out top with 49%
preference.
The market research company's conclusion is that milk from Ayrshire cows was
well received. ``The product itself performed very well .....and we recommend
that this milk is launched nationally,'' they added.
Ayrshire whole milk was described as uniquely sweet and creamy without being
too rich in taste. It also had a smooth texture and a light, rather than thick,
consistency ``giving clean and satisfying responses as a refreshing, drinking
milk''.
An interesting plus from the dairy farmer's standpoint was the consumers' view
that Ayrshire milk warranted a premium price because of its quality and
superior taste.
The consumer results were also matched by scientific work at the Hannah
Research Institute where expert panels compared Ayrshire milk against branded
high-fat milk on four sensory attributes - creamy aroma, creamy flavour, sweet
flavour and mouth-feel. Ayrshire scored highest in all four attributes.
The scientific and consumer research work backs up the market place experience
of Marks &amp; Spencer which sells only Ayrshire milk in its Scottish stores
(supplied by Scottish Pride). Some individual producer/processors have also
proved that there is a niche market for the milk promoted as a superior quality
product.
Earlier this year, the Ayrshire Cattle Society appointed Dr Tony O'Sullivan of
the Agri-Food Consultancy to conduct a feasibility study on the prospects for
establishing Ayrshire milk as an identifiable brand. He forecast then the
possibility of some Ayrshire producers forming their own processing group.
He takes the view that milk should be brought to the customer as fresh as
possible, being collected from farms on a daily basis. ``If you produce high
quality milk, you don't want it sitting around in tanks for an extra 24
hours,'' he said. In Scotland the milk for Marks &amp; Spencer is collected on a
daily basis from 35 farms.
The Ayrshire Cattle Society will consider proposals for implementing the next
stage of the marketing development programme at its council meeting in
February. Details of the findings to date are being passed to the Scottish
Office which has given 50% funding for the research work under the Marketing
Development Scheme.
The society has already registered a trademark based on the word Ayrshires with
a drawing of an Ayrshire cow's head appearing through a capital A.
q.Farmers are increasing the risk of significant lungwork losses in cattle by
cutting out vaccination, according to a Veterinary Investigation Centre study.
Twelve affected UK herds, only three of which carried out routine vaccination,
were observed in the study. Graham David of Shrewsbury VIC said that wormers
alone could not be relied upon for long-term prevention.

Dame Nita Barrow, nurse and public servant; born Barbados, November 15, 1916,
died there, December 19, 1995
DAME Nita Barrow, the first woman Governor-General of Barbados, and a widely
respected figure known as ``the People's Governor-General'', has died in
Bridgetown at the age of 79 after collapsing at a party.
Dame Nita was appointed Governor-General in 1990 after a lifetime in public
service in the Caribbean and on the world stage. She was the elder sister of
Errol Barrow, a former Prime Minister of Barbados, founder of the present
opposition party there, and architect of the island's independence.
A nurse and public health expert by background, Nita Barrow pursued specialist
nursing studies at Edinburgh University in 1951-52 and at Columbia University
in the US a decade later. A series of administrative posts in nursing in the
Commonwealth Caribbean culminated in her becoming director in 1964 of a
research project into nursing in the region. It led to the reorganisation and
upgrading of nurses' training there.
This aspect of public service was complemented by Nita Barrow's international
commitment through the YWCA and World Council of Churches. Her appointment as
associate director of the Christian Medical Commission of the WCC in 1971, and
as director four years later, gave her the chance to promote primary health
care and direct Western thinking towards recognition of traditional medicine.
Nita Barrow's travels as director of the CMC, as world president of the YWCA,
and as president of the International Council of Adult Education also allowed
her to promote the cause of women and the improvement of their status.
Her success as convener of the conference marking the end of the UN Decade of
Women in 1985 led to her nomination as the only woman in the ``Eminent Persons
Group'' set up to visit South Africa the following year and encourage the
necessary process of political change from apartheid to majority rule. She
lived to see, and rejoice in, the establishment of democracy there.
In 1986 she was appointed the Barbadian ambassador to the United Nations, where
one of her first speeches was on the status of women.
She was made a dame by the Queen in 1980 and was the popular choice for
Governor-General of Barbados in 1990. Her last international meetings were
associated with the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, appropriately,
for she herself was a widely admired and liked figure on the international
scene.

THE parents of a British property executive were last night awaiting the return
of their son's body after he was discovered murdered in his Paris flat.
Ian Wootton, 31, was expecting to move to a new job in New York when the killer
struck.
Detectives said he had been hit several times over the head, apparently after
interrupting thieves as they rifled through his belongings.
His father Leonard, 69, a retired bank official, who lives in Brentwood, Essex,
said he had seen his son 10 days ago and they had been due to meet up again
over the Christmas period.
``We don't know much of what is happening at this stage - it is in the hands of
the police in Paris,'' he said. ``It appears from the face of it that it is a
suspected murder case.''
The dead man was a manager with the Hammerson property company. He had been due
to move to America in the new year.
He qualified as a chartered surveyor and took a degree at South Bank University
before studying in Paris.
His father said he was a dedicated employee who spent much of his time at work.
His body was discovered on Thursday night.

THE former boyfriend of Samantha Fox was yesterday found guilty of taking part
in a bogus diet conspiracy involving a Young Slimmer of the Year, whose weight
dropped from 22st to 10st.
Marketing executive Peter Foster, 33, an Australian, stood impassively as the
jury returned its verdict after being out for 45 minutes at Liverpool Crown
Court.
Then the court heard that he had been fined for a similar offence last year and
was on bail for an alleged offence relating to a thigh reducing cream.
Judge Richard Hamilton remanded Foster, of Hadley Wood, Barnet, north London,
until January 11 for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.
Foster had denied conspiring with Young Slimmer of the Year Michele Deakin and
others to supply slimming granules under the name Deakin Diet, contrary to
trading standards rules.
Mr Neil Flewitt, prosecuting, told the court after the verdict that Foster had
one relevant previous conviction.
In September 1994 he was fined at Warwick Crown Court for similar offences
involving Bai Lin tea, allegedly a slimming aid.
Foster had left the country in June 1988, on the day he was due to stand trial
at Warwick.
``He stayed out of the country for six years,'' added Mr Flewitt.
``He was on bail to Warwick when he approached Michele Deakin.''
Miss Deakin, 27, pled guilty to the same charge that Foster faced at Liverpool
Crown Court in 1990.
She was given a suspended six-month prison sentence and fined #250.
The court heard during the four-day trial how Foster contacted her when she was
named Young Slimmer of 1988.
He persuaded her to endorse his slimming product, made from Guar Gum, although
she had never used it.
But Foster told the court when he gave evidence yesterday that he never
attributed Miss Deakin's weight loss to the product, formerly called MRA30.
Judge Hamilton told the jury of nine men and three women before discharging
them after the verdict yesterday: ``I wish you seasonal greetings.
``If you over-indulge during Christmas, I hope you will be better informed
about slimming remedies.''
Mr Frank Harper, principal trading standards officer at Knowsley, Merseyside,
who brought the action, said: ``I am very pleased with the verdict.
``I have always been convinced that Foster was behind the scam.''

Councillors in Border counties have forced a meeting in Whitehall with
Government officials to discuss low-flying aircraft. Andy Murray reports
TO the purple-faced child who shrieks as a formation of supersonic RAF Tornados
hurtles overhead at 450 knots, LFA 20 (T) is meaningless. Toddlers bothered by
decibels do not know that over much of Southern Scotland jets may legitimately
fly as low as 100 feet.
LFA 20 (T), the Borders Tactical Training Area, is one of only three areas of
Western Europe in which pilots may fly this low. The others are Central Wales
and the North-west Highlands.
Disenchanted campaigners who thought they would get more peace when the cold
war thawed include George Foulkes, Labour MP for Cumnock, Carrick and Doon
Valley, who has tabled 38 parliamentary questions on low flying. The Ministry
of Defence told him this month that compensation paid to farmers for incidents
had almost doubled in three years.
Pay-outs for damage to livestock totalled #182,000 in 1992-93, while in 1994-95
they amounted to #327,000. Over the past financial year compensation paid for
property damage was #86,000; for aircraft crash damage #148,000; for personal
injury #121,000 and for other damage #21,000.
This is for transgressions in the UK by British and foreign pilots. It does not
include payments made by delegated ``Defence Land Agents''.
``A spectacular #750,000 was paid out last year. The conclusion to be drawn is
how dangerous low flying is,'' says Foulkes.
``Even with no major incidents they are still causing a lot of problems. There
have been pay-outs totalling more than #3m over the last six years.''
Earl Howe, Under Secretary of State for Defence, assured MPs in Southern
Scotland recently that he would seek ways of reducing the frequency of sorties
in LFA 20 (T).
``But all the brass hats will be trying to pull him in the other direction.
That is our fear,'' says Foulkes.
Meanwhile, the Inter-Authority Group on Low Flying, which comprises councillors
from thoughout Southern Scotland and Northern England, has secured an
unprecedented showdown in Whitehall with Earl Howe on January 10.
Its chairman, Councillor Denis Male, vice-convener of Dumfries and Galloway
regional council, said: ``Low flying is a problem which has plagued communities
in the Border areas for too long. We are not against training, but we want to
make pilots accountable.
``Some of them have a gung-ho attitude and they do not seem to give a damn
about people on the ground.''
The group says the RAF should be made aware of galas, common ridings,
equestrian events and agricultural peak periods. It accuses pilots of
deliberately ``targeting'' rural schools, hospitals and other landmarks, and it
will press Earl Howe to confine low flying to wilderness areas outwith national
parks.
The group will criticise the secrecy surrounding exclusion zones and
investigations. ``We want alert statuses and perhaps a charter on low flying,''
says Male. ``We want on-board flight monitoring equipment to record heights and
target lists and we want an Ombudsman on low flying.''
Malcolm Spaven, an Edinburgh-based defence consultant, researched low flying
for the Economic and Social Research Council. ``There is a general concern
that, despite the end of the cold war the intensity of low flying, particularly
in the Borders, is not going down,'' he says.
``The RAF says more hours of low flying are needed per pilot. Spending on the
MoD's Civil Service has been transferred to frontline units. Although the
number of sorties has gone down the number of hours of low flying has gone
right up. There is more emphasis now on realism, and pilots are expected to
have more low flying in their training.''
Health problems caused by the sudden appearance of a jet which clocks up 125
decibels have never been properly gauged in the UK. A report published last
month by the University of Leeds, however, concluded: ``There is no doubt that
noise from military low-altitude flights is a stressor. The literature
catalogues numerous suspected health impacts.
``With the exception of noise-induced hearing loss and possibly blood pressure
effects these health impacts remain unproven and, sadly, are likely to remain
that way.''
Another study suggests that children living in tactical low-flying areas
perform more poorly in school and are more susceptible to anxiety disorders.
German studies suggest that frequent exposure by children to low-flying
aircraft can lead to headaches and nightmares.
In 1990 a survey conducted at RAF West Freugh in Galloway revealed several
instances of jets flying at 128 decibels, although the MoD had long adjudged
125 decibels to be the level above which there was a health risk.
An MoD official argued: ``In height-judging competitions held in 1987 at Battle
of Britain open days most people underestimated heights. More than 70% of
people were more than 100 feet out in their estimates, and 45% were more than
150 feet out.''
Pilots had to be able to fly as low and fast as possible to have a reasonable
chance of penetrating enemy defences. Flight simulators were not good enough.
Apparently ``specially designated, sparsely populated areas'' such as LFA 20
(T) are.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland has upped its stake in Banco Santander SA to 2.4%
with the #50m acquisition of 1.6 million of the Spanish bank's capital stock.
The banks entered into an alliance strategy in 1988 which allows each to hold
up to 2.5% of the other's stock. Two representatives from each bank sit on
their partner's board.
NFC drops talks
NFC has pulled out of negotiations with Lep Group to buy its freight forwarding
business, Lep International, which it is understood will now be acquired by its
management for a nominal sum.
The business has assets of #68m and made operating profits of #6.5m in 1993 but
is saddled with debt.
Taylor-made post
JOHN TAYLOR, 48, a European vice-president of Exxon Chemicals, has been
appointed chief executive of state-owned British Nuclear Fuels, operators of
the Sellafield site in Cumbria. He takes up his post in March.
Broadgate deal
BRITISH Land has spent #121.5m to take control of Broadgate Properties. The
property developer is buying the 50% of Broadgate, which helped build the high
profile office development of the same name in the City, it did not already own.
Mercury man
ROD OLSEN, finance director and acting chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, has
been appointed chairman of its Mercury telephone subsidiary. The business has
been without a chairman for a month since Lord Young stepped down as chairman
of both Mercury and C&amp;W.

EDINBURGH-based Cairn Energy has raised #4.88m through a share placing to fund
a solo offshore drilling venture in Bangladesh and projects in the Netherlands,
UK, US and China.
The main action for Cairn is in Bangladesh, where it is targeting the offshore
Sangu-1 well on block 16.
Unlike Semutang on the adjacent onshore block 15, where the company is working
with Midlands Electricity, Cairn is going it alone with Sangu-1.
Chief executive Bill Gammell has not ruled out bringing in a partner along the
way, but he believes it is in the best interests of shareholders for the
exploration to remain a solo venture for the time being.
Cairn, the first Western company to sign a production-sharing contract in
Bangladesh, now has an interest in four million acres in two blocks. It is
hoping to construct a power station, with Midlands, which would be fuelled by
gas from the Semutang well.
The company has recently exercised its option to puchase a 30% stake in the
power project even though it has not agreed on a price for the conversion of
gas to electricity with the Bangladeshi government.
Construction of the power station, which Cairn hoped would begin in the second
quarter of next year, will not now start until the end of the year. Cairn is
trying to negotiate a financing package with the World Bank.
The new shares, which were placed by SG Strauss Turnbull at 111.5p, represent
5% of the company's issued share capital prior to the deal.

A SCOTTISH hospital has secured #900,000 out of #13m unused NHS capital
spending to assist the development of its cancer services.
The Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, a world renowned cancer treatment
centre, has earmarked several items which are needed for its work.
The news of the funding came after a visit to the Western General Hospital
yesterday by Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Lord James said the Scottish Office would redistribute the rest of the #13m to
various other hospital projects.
Hospital trusts from all over Scotland have submitted bids for the cash, with
priority being given to bids which focus on cancer services, mental health, and
cardiac and cerebral vascular services.
Among the items to be purchased by the Western General Hospital is a #90,000
machine which enables computerised analysis of DNA sequences to identify the
genetic likelihood of developing conditions such as Huntingdon's Disease.
During the tour of the hospital Lord James said: ``Let me make it clear at the
outset that this is not new money but arises from slippage in the NHS capital
programme.
``I will come to a decision on other individual bids very soon.''
Lord James said the Western General's submission was an ``impressive'' one.
Mr John Connaghan, chief executive of the Western General Hospitals NHS Trust,
said: ``This is a timely announcement of capital funding that will enhance the
services we provide across a range of specialities, including cancer services,
neuro-sciences, clinical genetics, and imaging.''

William Torrance Cavaye; born February 5, 1929, died December 11, 1995
THE well-known Edinburgh businessman, Mr Bill Cavaye, has died suddenly in
hospital in the city. He was 66.
Born in Edinburgh in 1929, he was educated at the Royal High School and joined
his family's firm of MacGregor &amp; Company, distributors of glass and china, in
1948. He took over as managing director from his father in 1973.
His commitment to his business was legendary throughout the licensed and
catering trades. He took MacGregor's from a one-showroom enterprise in Leith
Walk to its current standing with branches in Glasgow, Inverness, Gateshead,
and Aberdeen. He retired two years ago and was chairman of the company at the
time of his death.
Beyond his business, Bill Cavaye had many interests. He was a past moderator of
the High Constables of Edinburgh, a past president of Leith Rotary Club, and a
senator of the Junior Chamber International. He was a steward at Murrayfield
for 40 years before the stadium was reconstructed.
He is survived by his wife and two sons and a daughter.

WORKERS at a Clyde shipyard were told yesterday that they had won a #19m order
for a fishery research vessel which will help secure their jobs.
The order placed with Ferguson Shipbuilders, of Port Glasgow, was announced by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth. It gives the yard its first order since it
was taken over by millionaire Frank Dunnet earlier this year.
The new ship, a replacement for the FRV Scotia, is due to be completed by
autumn 1997.
Ferguson won the contract in face of fierce competition from the UK, Europe,
and America.
``It is excellent that a Scottish shipyard and its workforce should be judged
fully capable of meeting all the demanding technical requirements of such a
sophisticated, hi-tech vessel,'' said Mr Forsyth.
``This contract represents excellent value for the taxpayer, having been won as
a result of a competitive process.
``It also demonstrates the Government's support for the long-term interests of
the fishing industry.''
The yard is currently finishing off two tugs and is working on a ferry and an
offshore supply vessel.

BEN Allen, managing director of Kellock, a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland,
has been acting as a modern day Santa Claus since December 1, travelling 5000
miles to visit firms in Scotland, England and Wales.
Allen, who founded the factoring company in 1976, calls unexpectedly around
Christmas time bearing gifts. This year he visited a record 189 of his 500
clients, beating last year's total of 144 visits and covering the UK from
Aberdeen to the south coast of England. He arrives at his client's offices in
his Jaguar with a gift of a bottle of red and a bottle of white wine.
He finished his tour in Glasgow yesterday, and I spoke to him just as he was
about switch off the office lights and head home to Reading to enjoy Christmas.
``It's great fun but because I don't make appointments I miss about 20% of the
clients, but if I made appointments it would take me much longer as I would
have to spend more time with each one. I enjoy it very much. I have only missed
doing the tour on three occasions since the company started in 1976, and one of
those was 1990 when we were making a loss, and I didn't think you could give
gifts in a loss making situation.''
Postgraduate
skills in demand
THE British Council in Edinburgh is looking for companies interested in
participating in the Scottish International Resource Project. Every year it
works with a group of around 80 people selected from postgraduate courses
throughout the country's universities.
Companies should let Sheila Lumsden, the project manager at SIRP, know about
any particular requests they may have, and what nationality or discipline is of
interest. The postgraduates come from key overseas markets, and are keen to
develop business contacts during their stay.
There are now more than 2000 SIRP participants back home in 50 countries who
are willing and able to assist Scottish exporters. If you are interested in the
scheme, or would like to contact a SIRP person in a particular country to help
you on the ground, call Sheila Lumsden on 0131 452 9789 or e-mail her on
Sheila.Lumsden britcoun.org.
Masked men are
just the ticket
BUSINESS Diary readers have the chance to start the New Year in style with a
bottle of champers and a pair of tickets to see Phantom of the Opera at
Edinburgh's Playhouse Theatre courtesy of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
The accountancy firm held a Christmas party earlier this week, and as it
sponsors Phantom of the Opera it decided it should be themed round the show. As
well as a guest phantom playing favourite tunes, there was a competition to win
the best seats and anovernight stay at the Caledonian Hotel. The 100 or so
guests certainly got into the spirit of things and raised more than #700 for
charity.
To keep the fun going, and to make sure Business Diary readers don't miss out,
we have organised a little competition of our own. All you have to do is
identify the Coopers &amp; Lybrand partners behind the masks (pictured left), and
fax your answer to Julie Moulsdale on 0141 221 8256 by Friday, December 29.
The winner will receive a bottle of Coopers &amp; Lybrand champagne and a pair of
tickets for the show. Employees of the firm need not apply!
Lunch with a
European theme
THE Scottish Council of the European Movement lunch in the Sheraton Grand Hotel
in Edinburgh on January 18 should be an interesting occasion. Sir David Simon,
chairman of BP, will address the meeting on the subject of Building a European
Company.
We are told the talk will reflect his vision of a single market for oil
products, and it will be intriguing to hear what he has to say about the
proposed Euro. If you would like to attend the lunch, which costs #35, give
Barbara MacLeod a call on 0131 220 0377.
Chamber gets
the travel bug
SCOTTISH Chambers of Commerce is organising two trade missions during 1996. The
first, planned for April, will visit the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, while
the second will travel to Israel in July.
The UK is the third largest supplier to the UAE after Japan and the US, and
half our exports there are to the rapidly growing manufacturing sector.
According to the British Embassy in Dubai, the priority sectors include
construction, medical supplies and power generation. In Kuwait opportunities
exist for companies in the oil sector and fine quality durable goods.
Anyone requiring further information on the missions should contact the
International Trade Division on 0141 204 2121.
Soviets march
on the SECC
A CONFERENCE and exhibition aimed at improving trade with the former Soviet
Union countries is coming to Glasgow's SECC in the spring. The Spectra 96
Anglo-Scottish Eastern Europe Business Conference will be held from March 12 to
14 and will include a mix of exhibitors from the UK and the former Soviet Union
targeted at key sectors such as electronics, textiles, engineering, oil and gas.
To get involved, contact AR Trade Fairs, Suite 6, Mostyn Hall, Penrith, Cumbria
CA11 7XR; tel 01768 899739 or fax 01768 892259.
Royal affair at
the institute
IT WILL be a right royal affair at the West of Scotland Branch of the Institute
of Petroleum annual dinner on March 28 when Their Majesties King Constantine
and Queen Marie are to be the principal guests.
There will be more than 900 guests at the dinner in the Hospitality Inn,
Glasgow, and King Constantine will be the main speaker and propose the toast to
the institute. Gilbert Gray QC will respond, and Bill Beaton chairman of the
West of Scotland branch will chair the proceedings.
This is another nice little coup by Beaton and his committee, which every year
produces a speaker just a bit out of the ordinary. At this year's dinner it was
Pik Botha, the South African Foreign Minister.

SHADOW transport spokesman Brian Wilson has called for a halt to the sale of
British Rail's freight arm after allegations about the background of companies
involved in bids.
Mr Wilson has also demanded a full investigation of the main shareholders in
two US-led consortia which hope to take over the three regional companies which
make up the service.
He said that one company involved, the US construction firm Kiewit, paid $415m
in 1990 to settle a law suit which alleged it had used a computer to identify
and lay off workers just before they qualified for pensions.
The same company, which is involved in a consortium led by the Denver based
firm Omnitrax, is now at the centre of an FBI investigation over problems with
a multi-billion dollar subway in Los Angeles.
Last night, the president of Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation,
which is leading the second bid, faxed a letter to Mr Wilson asking for a
meeting with the Labour MP.
Mr Edward Burkhardt said he was concerned about press reports of a tax
investigation into the corporation's New Zealand merchant bank co-investors,
Fay Richwhite.
Mr Wilson said: ``I would be delighted to meet with Mr Burkhardt.''
A spokesman for the Department of Transport said last night: ``We haven't
actually said who the bidders are and we won't until we annouce who has won the
contract.
``We are satisfied with the quality of the bidders. We will be announcing the
sale early in the new year.''

PETER Cook drank himself to death and it was perhaps not the funniest thing he
ever did. Neither, on the other hand, was it a joke capable of much repetition
- no encores to speak of - and as Drinking Yourself to Death gags go,
``Cookie's'' must be one of the best. He exited, as it were, glass in hand.
It was never clear in the latter part of his life, when his comedic inventions
were limited to the role of reliable, and reliably squiffy, chat show guest, if
he much cared. Omnibus: Some Interesting Facts About Peter Cook (BBC1, Tuesday)
spent a good deal of time trying to discover of his old comrades whether the
comic was a man whose hopes had been disappointed, or someone who had never
hoped for very much in the first place.
Jonathan Miller was as pompous as ever; Alan Bennet vaguely wistful; and Ian
Hislop still the loyal fan eager to please. It was thus left to Dudley Moore to
inject some life into the proceedings and explain why the ``legendary''
partnership broke up. Art had nothing to do with it; trying to perform nightly
with a man who had taken precautions to render himself utterly incapable simply
drove little Dud up the wall.
What seemed obvious from the clips, each as glorious as ever, was that Cook's
comedy was an intrinsic part of him, the unpredictable stream of his
consciousness. Witness after witness, some of them the most garrulous in the
business, remembered a man who, in the beginning, could talk anyone under the
table. The booze put an end to that, as this thorough but unimaginative
portrait made clear. If, at the end, Cook affected not to care about all the
potential he had squandered, that was simply because he had no choice in the
matter.
To speak of squandering is to speak, invariably, of our beloved institutions.
Thus it was that the BBC at its most deferential could waste valuable resources
on a portrait of the royal yacht (Britannia, BBC1, Wednesday), itself a
floating symbol of the monarchy's conspicuous consumption of state cash and
public gullibility.
The excuse, such as it was, was that Her Majesty has at last condescended to
part with her gin palace, the supposed ``hospital ship'' that never saw a
patient and served Britain only by servicing the arms salesmen who give us all
so much cause to feel proud. Produced by the team who made the immensely dull
record of a year in the Queen's life, Britannia was a desperately
old-fashioned, utterly servile piece of television.
Elizabeth did not put in an appearance herself - it's the mystique you see -
but her husband explained what a wrench it would be to lose the boat (commanded
by her very own admiral) that has served the nation through some of the most
gruelling excursions to tropical paradises any freeloader has ever had to face.
Given the conditions on board, each gaudy detail lovingly observed during a
state visit to South Africa, you could see why the old boy was cut up. Equally,
you might just have understood why others among us might wish the same fate on
the boat's passengers. This sort of dire, antique advertising was precisely
what the royals don't need just at the moment.
Equally, you might guess, Ray Davies probably doesn't need to be known as ``the
godfather of Britpop''. It's rather like giving Louis Armstrong credit for the
silvery tones of Herb Alpert, or thinking the Beatles were important because of
their influence on Take That. Naff and daft, in other words, an intended
compliment that is actually a fairly substantial insult, not least when you
compare the sheer craft of Davies with the elementary noodlings of some of his
young admirers.
But as I'm Not Like Everybody Else - The World of Ray Davies And the Kinks
(BBC2, Wednesday) felt obliged to remind us, the singer was young himself once.
It was the songs, whose genesis he explored ably enough, which were
astonishingly mature from the very beginning. And if, as with Cook, Davies
could never repeat the successes of the sixties, that doesn't diminish his
achievement. Anyone who could write Days or Waterloo Sunset has nothing more to
prove.
It was a good piece nevertheless, with even Dave Davies, the singer's eternally
squabbling sibling, making a useful contribution.
Eschewing nostalgia, it managed to demonstrate that the complexity of Davies
the man, in no way like everybody else, was directly related to the complexity
of his art. He made it sound simple, but the good stuff never is.
Hence, perhaps, the astonishing success of Michael Barrymore, even when
confined to a vehicle as deeply awful as Michael Barrymore's My Kind of People
(ITV, Thursday). The contrast between his seemingly effortless professionalism
and the straining performances of amateurs in a shopping mall in Dudley (hell
is many things, and this was only one) was the comedian's best advertisement
for himself.
No format could have been worse, no setting more unappealing, yet Barrymore
sailed through it all, coaxing the kids, partnering a ``singing receptionist'',
and generally adding fresh dimensions to the word ``multi-talented''. It was
pointless even to try to hate it, but one visit to Dudley, even in this
company, was probably enough.
One visit to the Christmas schedules should also be sufficient for any
reviewer, but this week at least the networks were fairly restrained.
Granted, the BBC2 planners who allowed Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus
(Monday), perhaps the worst film even Charles Bronson has made, on to the air
deserve a thorough basting. But since they were presumably the same folk who
decided to give James Stewart's marvellous Mr Smith Goes to Washington an
airing the following day, it is hard to be harsh.
That may be the heart of the annual festive TV problem, however. All judgment
is suspended, it seems, when a programme has ``Christmas'' in the title. Any
old tat, and much brand-new tat, is slung on to the schedules with the gems.
Viewers are presumed to have lost such discrimination as they had and the
schedulers give their imaginations a holiday.
You know its Christmas, in other words, when the desire to drown Jilly Goolden
and Oz Clarke (Food and Drink, BBC2, Tuesday) in ``the best alcoholic seasonal
offers available'' becomes overwhelming. But don't let me put you off.

Steve Bruce argues that it is perverse to lay claim once a year to a liturgical
tradition and a theology which most of us disdain and deny the rest of the time
THIS week I have done two things: sung carols and spent money. The latter
caused some pain but the former caused disquiet. The carols themselves were
refreshingly old-fashioned. Thirty years ago I enjoyed church-going because I
loved the grandeur and the elegiac tones of the Presbyterian and Methodist
hymns we sang.
To this day massed voices slowly climbing up the last line of ``For those in
peril on the sea'' or walking through the bass part of The Lord's My Shepherd
bring a tear to my eye. But I gave up church and I gave up the music because I
felt deceitful delivering with gusto words I did not believe.
As will have been the case for many of us, my return to dishonesty was
occasioned by the school. The children have a carol service; parents and
younger siblings are invited. To deprive my children of a pleasure enjoyed by
their chums would be a tad precious. So I sing carols.
Even if the school had not contrived their socialisation, my children would
acquire some knowledge of Christianity from the iconography of the impending
Christmas. Having children forces us to contemplate our beliefs. Just what do
we want them to believe? Which fond fantasies do we wish to challenge? The
tooth fairy and Santa Claus are easy enough. Disabusing our children of those
notions is a matter of timing; when, not if.
But Christianity is a bigger problem, because grown-ups believe in it too. Not
many, it has to be said. The recent Scottish Church Census showed 14% of
Scottish adults in church on a typical Sunday. Perhaps a further 20% believe in
a personal God.
The weight of irreligion is such that I could remain politely reticent when my
children talk of the baby Jesus and wait until they realise that Christians are
in a minority. But should I sing carols now?
Should any of us outside the small circle of committed Christians sing carols?
Should those who never attend any other kind of Mass celebrate the ``Mass'' for
Christ?
Is it not perverse to lay claim once a year, in however a feeble and befuddled
way, to a liturgical tradition and a theology which most of us disdain and deny
the rest of the time?
There are obvious secular virtues to a grand midwinter blow-out. We can mock
the forced conversation and supressed feuds of ghastly Christmas dinners with
relatives we do not much like, but a society is improved by an annual
requirement to renew social bonds and to place convention above personal
preference.
We can denounce the enormous sums often ill-advisedly spent on presents but
there is much to be said for spending a few hours thinking about what our
spouses and children might like. We can deride the superficiality of our annual
outburst of charity. It is indeed pathetic that we open additional hostels and
soup kitchens for the homeless and run them for four days, before lapsing back
into our cold indifference. But four days is better than a kicking.
We might think the stretch between Christmas and New Year a trifle (and a cake
and a pudding and some chocolates) over long but it allows us to attack the new
year with a renewed enthusiasm for our working lives.
Anything which brings us together for a week has got to be a good idea. The
great Trades Weeks, when Glasgow and then Edinburgh and then Dundee emptied its
working class ``doon the watter'' or to the Isle of Man or to Blackpool, belong
to the era of black-and-white photographs. We now take our summer holidays as
families or with very small numbers of friends. Economies are no longer so
localised that a city can just close down. Except when the rest of the
``Christian'' world does. At Christmas.
The case for the defence of the unreformed Ebeneezer Scrooge would begin with a
critique of the mass media. Much of what we think, feel, see, and do at
Christmas is second-hand. This life at one remove is not received ``through a
glass, darkly'', as St Paul put it. It comes through a glass with stunning
brightness; a hyper-reality more real than our own lives. We both celebrate
Christmas by watching fictional characters celebrate Christmas and we allow our
own celebrations to be stage-managed by the media.
The schedules will include a large slice of nostalgia topped with clotted
sentimentality. The Yorkshire Dales of the 1930s (All Creatures Great and
Small), the Yorkshire moors of the 1950s (Heartbeat), any place and any time
past can stand for a more authentic life when people had fewer presents and
shorter holidays but enjoyed them more. But the cloying is nowadays accompanied
by the corrosive.
The school of grit-in-the-mince pie realism, that probably began with that
truly awful Christmas with Alf Garnett in Till Death us Do Part and lives on in
EastEnders, will provide us with enough dysfunctional families to satisfy the
greediest social worker. The criticism is not that the mass media present us
with images that are false in the sense of the big lie (although the preference
for the past over the present comes close to being a big lie).
It is that the hyper-reality of mass media worlds (so better scripted, filmed,
and acted and so much more to that point than our lives) dissuades us from
dodging Christmas ourselves. It is more exciting to watch other people doing
Christmas. Festive season mass media promotes voyeurism. As with the sexual
perversion, for the truly sad, television Christmas is a substitute for the
real thing; but even for us normal folks it is an unhealthy discouragement from
a real sex life.
Even when we prefer our own circumstances and relations to those of hyper-real
TV communities, we may allow the mass media to provide the basic material for
our celebrations. The many choral services are a pleasure to both churchgoers
and to the wider audience of people for whom watching fresh-faced choirboys in
surplices is the nearest they came to a shared act of religious worship.
At yet a further remove from reality, the special mass media events of the
Christmas period, instead of being a reflection of Christmas, or an aid to
celebrating Christmas, themselves become the event. The Queen's Speech, the
Agatha Christie adaptation, the pile of blank videos, and the carefully
marked-up Radio Times; these are what we celebrate. We know it's Christmas
because Scrooge is back.
There is, of course, a truckload of truth in the above critique but it
exaggerates the importance of the mass media and it mistakes the target. Try
turning it into a positive proposition. At our major annual holiday, when the
days are short, cold, and wet, when most facilities are closed, and when most
people have a chance to relax, television and radio should put on their
dullest, cheapest, least interesting programmes. Of course not. It is the big
holiday. Push the boat out. Put on the best.
If there is something wrong with the part that the mass media play in
structuring our Christmas holiday it is the same thing that is wrong with our
attitude to it all the year round and there is no-one to blame for that but
ourselves; there is an off switch. If we have become a nation of voyeurs we
cannot blame our dirt merchants for selling us an extra juicy morsel at
Christmas time.
Having roasted the media, counsel for the defence of Scrooge would go on to
decry the vast sums spent on presents. He would speak wistfully of the days
when children were thrilled with an orange and a few nuts in a darned sock. But
again try putting that in the form of a positive proposition. At our main
present-giving time of year, people should exchange gifts worth far less than
they spend on themselves every day. Silly.
Anyway, we are wrong to think that our grandparents appreciated small things
because they had a better sense of proportion and knew what really mattered in
life. They appreciated an orange and a few nuts because oranges and nuts were
expensive and rare. But even if we did believe that people with few posessions
are more authentic than us modern consumers we could hardly promote economic
decline.
Counsel for the unregenerate Scrooge would then turn his attention to the
``Christ'' part of Christmas; and here he would have my sympathies. He could
argue that our present midwinter festival is damaging to the nation's soul
because it is dishonest and dishonesty diminishes a people as much as it does
an individual.
The corresponding case for the ersatz tartanry of the tourist Scotland is well
known. Our local capitalist dairy farm makes wonderful luxury ice cream (that
is, it leaves all the fat in). It recently added a new brand called
``Highlander'' and in its promotional material discovered previously unremarked
geological features in our gently rolling rich farm land. The Bens and Glens
have moved east and south!
I can recall a marvellous Billy Connolly monologue in which he ruminated on the
significance of little ``Hairy Highlander'' dolls on sale in a Scottish tourist
resort. He rhetorically asked if we could imagine American blacks selling each
other golliwogs!
Intellectuals, especially of a nationalist persuasion, are prone to view the
tartanry of Bens and Glens as a perversion, a ``pathological discourse'' which
prevents us appreciating what modern Scotland is really like and acting in a
clear-minded and rational way to pursue our real interests. From that
perspective, tartanry is not a harmless bit of fun. It is cultural oppression.
I am not entirely persuaded by this criticism. Apart from anything else it
implies that there is a real authentic Scottish culture which should replace
the bastard creations of the Scottish Tourist Board and the American film
industry. My guess is that modern societies, even those of small nations, are
so fragmented that the search for a real national culture is a pointless grail
hunt. If lowland Scots find that wearing tartan makes them feel ``Scottish''
then I am not going to try to talk them out of it.
But the dishonesty with regard to Christianity is greater because a religion
carries more social and behavioural significance than a mistake about national
history and poor fashion sense. A religion supports a theory of how and why the
world is as it is and a theory of how we know about it.
Christianity has a theory of origins (Creator God, Six Days etc) and a theory
of truth, Holy Spirit and either Holy Writ (Protestant Version) or Holy
Catholic Church on Holy Writ (RC version). It sustains a body of moral values
and an ethical system. Most people no longer believe these things. Even
churchgoers have largely abandoned hell (which one would have thought was
essential to the enforcement of the ethics).
So why do we not have the courage of our convictions? Why do we mislead all
those poor clergymen who hope that our annual visit to church might just be
turned into something more enduring?
Which brings me back to where I started. However any of we non-believers
personally reconcile ourselves to the disingenuity of annually paying lip
service to a religion we no longer take seriously, surely we should have some
consideration for those who do believe it. Although the Christian references
are being scaled down (``Yuletide'' for ``Christmas''; Georgian coaching inn

strip out the last vestiges, and leave the symbols of the primary Christian

The rest of us could simply enjoy a much-needed and much-appreciated midwinter

everything to the small band of those for whom it means anything at all.

PROFESSOR Donald MacKay, the chairman of Scottish Enterprise who agreed a
multi-million pound cut in the agency's funding last week, has been asked by
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to stay on as chairman for another four
years.
It means that the partnership of Professor MacKay as chairman and Mr Crawford
Beveridge as chief executive will continue until at least 1998, confounding
rumours that the two highly active businessmen had difficulties in working
together.
The reappointment comes at a difficult time for Professor MacKay. He had to
offer the Scottish Office a 7!s% cut in funding, worth #33m, earlier this month
in order to save the enterprise network from even deeper cuts.
He said afterwards that Scottish Enterprise and its group of local enterprise
companies would still be able to deliver a high-quality service despite the
cut-backs. The individual enterprise companies will find out what their budgets
are going to be next month.
In theory Professor MacKay, who is also chairman of the Pieda consultancy,
works at Scottish Enterprise for only two days a week, but his hands-on style
means he spends considerably more time than that on Enterprise business.
It is this involvement which many observers felt would lead to a clash with Mr
Beveridge. However, it is believed that both men have worked out the areas each
should stick to, and now have a good working relationship.
Mr Forsyth said he valued the clarity of vision and positive leadership which
Professor MacKay had brought to the job.
``He has applied much time and energy to the task of developing the enterprise
network and seeking out opportunities, and most of all he has sought to focus
Scottish Enterprise's efforts on its central task of promoting the
effectiveness of Scottish business,'' he added.

THE Scottish Office has given in to demands for local councillors to be
involved in deciding which projects are to benefit from Objective One funding.
In another change to the way the EU funds are to be distributed, 70% will be
allocated to the most disadvantaged areas, an increase from 50%.
Projects from all areas will also now be able to compete for the remaining 30%.
The moves follow complaints, especially from Highland regional councillors,
that the decision-making process was too involved.
The Scottish Office has agreed that informal partnership groups should be set
up to advise on projects to be given the green light.
Critic of the administration of Objective One, and the sharing out of funds,
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald, said it was an improvement, but was still
baffled as to why all of the money is not being targeted at the poorest areas.

William Ian Robertson Finlay, CBE, director of the Royal Scottish Museum
1961-71; born Auckland, New Zealand, December 2, 1906, died Edinburgh, December
10, 1995
MR Ian Finlay, former director of the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh, has
died at the age of 89. A well-known figure in the arts, he was the author of
many books on Scotland and her people, and delivered many broadcast talks on
art and other topics. He took a lasting interest in silver, and one of his
books was A History of Scottish Gold and Silver Work, first published in 1956.
He joined the staff of the museum in 1932 and was keeper of the department of
art and ethnography from 1955-61. He was director of the museum from 1961-71.
During his tenure as director, many new developments took shape. He began the
programme of building renewal at the museum, set up its education section, and
began a programme of public lectures at the museum's lecture theatre.
Among his many positions, he was secretary of the Royal Fine Art Commission for
Scotland 1953-61, Professor of Antiquities to the Royal Scottish Academy
1971-95, and a member of the Edinburgh Festival Council 1968-71. He was awarded
the CBE in 1965.
Mr Finlay was born in Auckland, New Zealand, but his parents soon returned to
Scotland and he was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University.
During the Second World War, he was seconded to the Ministry of Information and
was deputy regional information officer for Scotland 1942-44.
He married Mary Pringle in 1933. They had two sons and a daughter.

<HEADLINE>Chief executive to leave group with #400,000 as rivals Fyffes and Wibdeco pay #147.5m for fruit trade Geest sells off banana business</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GEEST has agreed a price of #147.5m for the sale of the banana business with
which it has been associated for more than 40 years.
The buyer is a joint venture between Geest's rival Fyffes and Wibdeco, which is
owned by the governments and banana growers of the Windward Islands whose
economies are heavily dependent on the fruit.
Geest shares, which hit a low of 107p last month, jumped 39p to 192p as the
price was higher than expected. The chief executive, David Sugden is to leave
the group, with an expected pay-off topping #400,000.
Geest decided to throw in the towel after a volatile period during which its
banana supply was hit by disease and hurricanes. This year its margins were
badly hit by a sharp fall in prices in Europe as a result of oversupply from
Central and South America.
The company's banana business includes a ripening depot at Garrion Bridge, near
Wishaw, which supplies Scotland and employs about 30 people.
Geest warned in November that profits would be well below market estimates and
this caused analysts to slash their forecasts from #14m to #9m before
exceptional costs of #12m. Profits of #12.8m were earned in 1994.
The Geest name is not to disappear. The business will continue to be run
independently of Fyffes and Wibdeco, though it already has a close relationship
with the latter. Geest was instrumental in setting up the banana industry in
the Windward Islands, beginning in 1954.
The industry is now a leading employer and revenue earner in the islands, with
20,000 growers producing fruit. Wibdeco looks after the Windward Islands end
whilst Geest deals with shipping, ripening, marketing and distribution.
Geest will use the cash to reduce debt and concentrate resources on its fruit
and vegetable processing business which has better growth prospects.
The banana trade in the European Union is controlled, with relatively high cost
fruit from the Caribbean and the Pacific given a protected market and the
cheaper Latin American produce subject to quotas.
Prices fell sharply in November, touching 19p a pound retail because further
Latin American bananas were allowed in because of hurricane damage.
The lower prices stimulated consumption and bananas have overtaken apples to
become Britain's favourite fruit. It is also very popular in Germany which
would like unrestricted entry for Latin American fruit.
Geest has a Costa Rican business and Fyffes believes it can improve its
performance.
Dublin-based Fyffes believes it will benefit from the joint venture and
acquisition through the development of a closer relationship with Wibdeco; the
increase in the scale of its Latin American business; the opportunities
provided by the successful banana boat operations which transport general cargo
on return runs; and a rise in the return on its cash resources as part of them
are invested in Geest.
Shorn of bananas, Geest reckons it can achieve significant cost savings in its
fresh foods business, where it intends to increase new product development,
maintain technical innovation and consolidate its leading market positions.
Excluding recipe dishes, it has more than 20% of the prepared foods market in
areas like fresh dips, sauces and pasta.
Analysts were pleased with the bananas sale, pointing out that Geest will now
be focused on growing markets with considerably greater resources to expand
through acquisition. In view of its commanding market positions it could also
easily attract predatory interest.

Alison Daniels talks to top Scottish lawyer Ross Harper about his hectic year
of globe-trotting as president of the International Bar Association
THIRTY countries, six months abroad, and enough horror stories and anecdotes to
last a lifetime. A year after donning the prestigious mantle of President of
the International Bar Association, one of Scotland's leading lawyers, Ross
Harper, believes Scots law, warts and all, can still be described as the best
in the world.
Yesterday Harper was back in London keen to relate some of the new initiatives
undertaken by the international Bar this year and some of the enormous problems
faced by lawyers operating in some of the 167 member countries.
The second Scot to be elected president in 50 years, Harper has this year had
the opportunity to examine first-hand legal systems as diverse as the Japanese,
with its astonishing 99% conviction and 95% confession rates, to the abuses of
the failing Nigerian legal structure. He has spent more than half the year
abroad, addressing lawyers' conferences and meeting senior government figures.
The experience has confirmed his faith in Scots law, reflected, he says, by the
high esteem with which the system, in spite of its flaws, is regarded abroad.
There is, he adds, also a lot of interest among Scottish lawyers in
international law and an enthusiasm for broadening horizons and experience.
The IBA's main role is to bring together the international law fraternity to
meet and discuss issues of common concern in areas as diverse as family law,
patent law and maritime law. The organisation also attempts to assist lawyers
struggling to protect the rule of law in countries where abuses are common. In
addition, there is a twinning scheme - the Scottish Law Society is twinned with
a similar organisation in Lithuania - allowing lawyers to exchange information
and ``shrink the world''.
Moves have also been made by the IBA to persuade the Foreign Office to withhold
aid from countries who abuse human rights.
According to Harper, one of the biggest achievements of his presidency has been
the foundation of a Human Rights Institute in the IBA's new London headquarters
just over a fortnight ago. The institute, funded by contributions from members,
will specialise in monitoring cases involving lawyers in the dock as well as
the trials of non-legal accused whose own lawyers have run into difficulties in
securing a fair trial.
Lawyers from any of the IBA's member countries who volunteer will, says Harper,
be trained in trial observing. They will then be sent to monitor a trial
providing, in effect, the legal eyes of the world. While playing quite a
specialist role, the institute will build on links which already exist between
the IBA and organisations like Amnesty International.
``We have already had one observer at a murder trial in Malaysia where normally
these cases last about half an hour. In that particular instance the trial
lasted three and half days, and the outcome was a lot more favourable than it
might have been.''
With this year designated African year, Harper has paid vists to Uganda,
Swaziland and South Africa and despatched an American lawyer to Ghana. In
general, the picture is of improving legal systems. The highlight came in
Johannesburg, a meeting with fellow lawyer South African President Nelson
Mandela. The most depressing trip was to Nigeria and the brief glimpse Harper
was allowed of Nigerian justice. ``It was a most fearful experience, travelling
past armed guards. The rule of law is being completely ignored.''
Japan's legal system came as one of the biggest eye-openers. Invited by the
Japan Federation of Bar Associations, Harper was given an account of the
substitute prison system where the accused can be held in custody for 23 days
without access to a lawyer, without an indictment being served and without bail
being granted.
Only through direct approaches to the Japanese Government can the basic rights
of a suspect be enshrined in law, a task which Harper says foreign Bar
association members are better placed to fight for than home lawyers.
Looking forward to his second and final year as president Harper hopes that a
number of Scots will volunteer to work for the institute in the role of trial
observers.
Next year has been designated Latin American year and for Harper will include a
trip to Argentina. ``Lawyers tend to be all-pervasive in Latin America, so we
will have access to the top. One of the problems in the past has been language,
but I think now it is generally recognised that English is the international
language of the law.''

<HEADLINE>Council rejects site for new hospital</HEADLINE>

AN appeal to the Scottish Secretary could follow a council's rejection
yesterday of plans for a new community hospital for East Ayrshire.
The controversial proposal to provide general daycare and residential
accommodation for the elderly and handicapped was knocked back after Cumnock
and Doon Valley councillors visited the site on Ayr Road.
The application by Ayrshire and Arran Community Health Care NHS Trust was
rejected five votes to four, mainly on the grounds of road and public safety.
The outcome has surprised trust officials as well as officers of the council's
planning department who had recommended approval subject to 25 conditions.
The proposal was tainted with controversy this year when plans were submitted
by the Health Care Trust for Cumnock and by South Ayrshire Hospitals Trust for
Ballochmyle near Mauchline.
Doctors and health professionals, including GPs, backed their local
applications and the debate, polarised between the two sites, was often
acrimonious.
Then the board decided unanimously that the Health Care Trust should get the
nod and plans for a greenfield site near the centre of Cumnock were submitted
to the district council.
Meanwhile it was disclosed that private finance would be used to build the
100-bed hospital although the trust stressed it would only be for NHS patients
and would be run by NHS doctors and nurses.
The applicants are now left with the options of applying once again, with these
conditions met or agreed, or appealing to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
They can also hope the full council will suspend standing orders and consider
the matter again, possibly overturning yesterday's decision.
It is understood that council leader David Sneller backed the application and
that he might favour another look at the whole question.
Councillor Anna Boyd, believed to be a supporter of the plan, left the meeting
before the vote and the planning chair, Councillor Robert Taylor, would have
cast his vote in favour should it have been tied 5-5.
The trust's vice chairman, Mr Scott McConnell, who attended yesterday's
meeting, said: ``The councillors made their decision against the advice of
their chief planning officers apparently on road safety matters.
``We are desperately disappointed that the councillors chose to reject the
application but we will continue to try to work with them and their officials
in an attempt to solve this problem.
``Unfortunately the council's preference for Ballochmyle as a site is
well-known, but this option has been rejected on various grounds by the health
board in favour of Cumnock which is at the centre of the 30,000 population
which the hospital will service.
``Failing a favourable result to negotiations after the New Year we will be
forced to submit an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland. We believe
the site is right and will be happy to meet any conditions attached to the
planning application.''

ON the Greek island of Mykonos, a glittering haven for the world's hedonists, I
met Yannis Pasolikis. He is somewhat of a celebrity there; a big spender, bon
vivant, night-club habitue and he was invariably accompanied by the most
outstanding blonde available which is quite a feat in this shifting community
of beautiful people. He is also 68 years old. His fame, or more accurately, his
noteriety, is a result of him winning the national lottery.
This stroke of luck propelled him out of the grey depressing city of Larissa,
central Greece's equivalent of Rotherham, where he was an odd-job man with a
wife, family of three, and a lean-to shack which he called home.
Now the family have a splendid villa on the outskirts and a way of life of
which formerly they could never even have dreamt. They don't see Yannis as
much, however. After his win he suddenly found a job in ``shipping'' which
necessitated him purchasing a bachelor pad in Athens and travelling far and
wide returning home only for special occasions - Christmas, Easter, or one of
the numerous celebratory Saints' days.
Yannis, however, has a dark secret. He doesn't have a job but has shrewdly
invested his money in businesses which, remarkably, have excelled. This allows
him to live the life of an ageing, yet well-preserved, playboy. ``My family
need never find out and when I die they will be rich,'' he says simply and
without guilt. ``Life is for living,'' he smiles, as he slips his arm around
his companion's 22in waist.
Such a tale in Britain would guarantee at least six pages in the Sun. On
Mykonos it was an open secret and no-one cared. Winning the lottery is expected
to change your life, for better or for worse. No soul-searching. No anguish
about how many drachma goes to charity. No angry letters in the press from the
Peleponnese Women's Co-operative Theatre Workshop about lack of funding.
Contrast this with our lottery, fast becoming one of the most successful in the
world yet one of the most criticised. There is something deep in the British
psyche which shies against it but at the same time participates in the general
mania. It has always been thus. Even in 1808 a select committee of MPs had
concluded that, as a result of lotteries, ``Idleness, dissipation, and poverty
are increased, domestic comfort is destroyed and madness often created.''
George Orwell was to return to this theme in his book Nineteen Eighty-Four. He
wrote: ``The lottery with its weekly pay-out or enormous prizes, was the one
public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that
there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal, if
not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly,
their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the lottery was concerned,
even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate
calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who
made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets.''
Some would argue that this has come to pass although the usual grounds for
complaint are that less is spent on bread than circuses and that there is an
unfairness in gathering money from the poor to spend on amusements for the
wealthy.
These objections are specious. The lottery cash is for the ``extras'' of life,
the fundamentals are and must continue to be provided by the Government through
our taxes. As for the poor paying out a higher proportion of their income every
time they purchase a lottery ticket, this applies whether they buy a pint of
milk or a loaf of bread.
No matter to which cause the cash is allocated the wealthier groups gain most.
Research shows that those in the socio-economic groups A, B, and C1 (those in
white-collar jobs) are more likely to play sports or pay to watch them than the
groups C2, D, and E (blue-collar workers and pensioners). When it comes to
pastimes such as visiting beauty spots or museums, the middle classes come out
tops again, even more so with theatre, opera, classical music concerts, or art
galleries.
The lottery, however, could be made fairer. The Government should have made a
start by sacking Peter Davis, the lottery regulator. The Heritage Secretary
Virginia Bottomley forfeited an opportunity this week to do just that - and not
for Mr Davis's silly decision to accept hospitality from an American lottery
operator. That was just bogus indignation from the Labour Party. Mr Davis
should have gone because of the abysmal way the lottery has been regulated.
For Camelot to be making #50m a year after tax - an annual profit they can
expect until their licence runs out in six years - for a total investment of
just over #45m is unacceptable. If it was the result of efficiency it would be
justified. It is not. It is the result of monopoly which has seen Camelot keep
the scratch-card game in-house, which is hardly surprising since it was they
who were given the right to scrutinise bids and, lo and behold, they chose
themselves.
The regulations on this and other aspects needed to be framed to encourage
competition. Mr Davis had failed to do so.
However, the Government could by allowing reputable companies the right to run
big charitable lotteries in opposition to the National Lottery. This would give
everyone a greater choice about where to put their money. We would, at the same
time, be able to sweep away so much of the hypocrisy which surrounds the
lottery. A multiplicity of consumer-driven lotteries would mean punters could
buy a ticket for the one they considered funded the worthiest cause or they
could play the one with the biggest jackpot. Want to bet on charity or the life
of Yannis Pasolikis?

THIS week's Trailblazer is the long-established Simpson Lawrence. For more than
80 years, since it set up in the basement of a tobacco merchant's house in
Glasgow's Merchant City as a manufacturer of wooden packing cases, the company
has held firm.
Now, as the production arm of one of Europe's three largest wholesale yacht
chandlers, Hillington-based Simpson Lawrence Engineering is blazing a trail
across the oceans as an exporter of high-quality yachting equipment to more
than 60 countries.
No-one produces the same range. It includes the whole anchoring package, says
commercial director Chris Lang - horizontal and vertical windlasses, capstans,
anchors - and yacht toilets. And its long history of listening to the market
and innovating has resulted in a number of awards for its products and steady
growth in its international reputation.
Simpson Lawrence's current success is the result of decades of far-sighted
management insistence on research and development. Since the founding owner's
interest in the sea first led to its diversification from packing cases to
yacht equipment, it has continued to chart new waters.
Fifty years ago it supplied the legendary C-Q-R anchors which held the Mulberry
Harbour in place on D-Day. Today it manufactures the only genuine drop forged
C-Q-R plough - the Rolls-Royce of anchors, and the saviour of many a yacht
caught in the fury of a Caribbean hurricane.
In 1980, in response to US demand for more adaptable windlasses, it was the
first to design one whose gypsy could cope with both chain and rope, and since
then there have been constant improvements to ensure better handling of ropes
of different sorts under various conditions.
In 1990 Simpson Lawrence saw a shift was taking place: power yachts were taking
an ever larger share of the market. This meant there was increasing demand for
remote control, automation and press-button equipment.
One-piece anchors, which were easier for power windlasses to handle and neater
to stow, were what premier powerboat builders wanted, so it designed and
launched another new product - the Delta. This has received more acclaim from
the world yaching press than any other anchor in recent times.
More recently still, it has developed a power windlass with a completely new
widget component. This eliminates the need for an electrically operated brake
and allows powerful and fast chain drop and retrieval, all remote from the
foredeck and at the touch of a button. It has been so successful - 3000 Horizon
500s have been sold this year - that a whole new range of power windlasses are
to be launched at the London Boat Show.
Still more important for Simpson Lawrence is the Miami Boat Show in February.
More than 90% of the company's total output is exported, and a large proportion
goes to the US, either directly or installed on British-built boats.
In all its products the firm strives for excellence. And a 50% growth in
turnover over the last two years is solid vindication that it is steering the
right course.

THE jury in the trial of a man accused of a neighbour's murder in a row over a
barking dog was discharged yesterday after failing to reach a verdict.
The panel of six men and six women had spent over six hours discussing the case
of 32-year-old Nicholas Farnell, of Waterlooville, Hampshire.
Mr Farnell, who now faces a retrial at Winchester Crown Court at the earliest
possible date, denies murdering 56-year-old Willy Pottage, but admits
manslaughter.
After the jurors, who retired on Thursday to consider their verdict, sent in a
note Mr Justice Turner said: ``I understand you to be saying that you have
reached the stage where you are quite simply unable to reach a decision where
at least 10 of you agree upon a verdict.''
The prosecution had alleged that Mr Farnell struck Mr Pottage with a crowbar
after losing his temper during the argument, which happened last May. Mr
Pottage suffered a fractured skull as he fell to the ground, and died four days
later.
It was not suggested Mr Farnell had intended to kill Mr Pottage but he had
intended to cause him serious harm, the prosecution contended.

Konrad Zuse, computer pioneer; born June 22, 1910, died December 18, 1995
KONRAD Zuse, the German engineer who built one of the world's first computers
and lost it in the wartime Allied bombing of Berlin, has died of heart failure
aged 85 at his home near Fulda.
Experts argue over who invented the electronic brain that revolutionised life
in the late twentieth century but Zuse's ``Z3'' model built in 1941 is
considered the first automatic and programmable computing machine. Fleeing
Berlin to protect his ``Z4'' model from the bombing, he refused Nazi orders to
hide the computer at the mountain caves of Mittelbau Dora when he found that
slave labourers were building the V1 and V2 rockets there.
The machine, eventually hidden in southern Germany, was later set up in Zurich.
Zuse founded his own computer-building firm after the war which was bought by
Siemens AG in 1966. Despite his pioneering work, he always had to struggle for
recognition. After a 26-year legal battle, a German court ruled in 1967 that a
later version of the ``Z3'' was ``not an invention worthy of a patent''.
``He was a brilliant inventor and tinkerer,'' Raul Rojas, a computer scientist
and historian, told Reuter. ``In contrast to the others, he was all alone.''
Among other pioneer computers were the Mark I built by Harvard University
professor Howard Aiken in 1944 and the ENIAC machine built at the University of
Pennsylvania in 1945. Aiken had major funding and staff help from International
Business Machines (IBM) while ENIAC was developed by the US military, said
Rojas, a Mexican-born professor of computer science at Halle University in
eastern Germany. But, added Rojas, only a mixture of all these limited models
led to the first real computers as we know them now.
Zuse was only 28 when he built his first model, the ``Z1'', covering four sq
metres (43sq ft) in his parents' living room. He built it ``out of laziness''
because he hated adding up the long columns of figures he calculated as an
aircraft designer. The machine was programmed by punched tape, stored only 64
characters, and took up to two seconds to do simple addition. His first three
computers were demolished in bombing raids but Zuse rebuilt the ``Z1'' from
memory more than 40 years later.
During the war, Zuse tried to get support from the Nazi government for a
two-year project to develop a large new computer to help improve anti-aircraft
defences. ``And just how long do you think it will take us to win the war?'' he
was asked when the project was rejected.
Only weeks before the Third Reich fell, Zuse moved his only remaining computer,
the ``Z4'', to Goettingen in central Germany to protect it from advancing
Soviet troops. Hermann Goering's Aviation Ministry ordered him to hide it in
nearby Mittelbau Dora, an underground concentration camp.
``It was there we first learned of the terrible conditions under which the V1
and V2 were being built,'' he wrote in his memoirs. ``We refused to leave the
machine there and, with the help of Werner von Braun's staff, we managed to get
hold of a truck to transport it elsewhere.''
After selling his company to Siemens, Zuse, who called himself a ``failed
capitalist'', turned to theoretical computer research and was active until his
death. ``He still had a lot in his head that he hadn't yet written down,'' said
Rojas.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair said yesterday that he had no intention of overturning
all the changes brought in under 16 years of Tory rule.
He said there would be no revolution the moment a Labour government took
office, and he instead offered a process of gradual change.
``Of course it is the case that the world is not going to be revolutionised the
moment Labour comes to power. That is only sensible,'' he said in an interview
he recorded with BBC Radio 4's Today programme before leaving for Australia.
``The country doesn't want a revolution - it doesn't want the barricades up at
the end of the street after Labour comes to power. They want a fresh start and
a new direction.''
On the economy he offered caution, ruling out ``quick fix'' solutions aimed at
raising short-term growth at the expense of stoking inflation.
``The progress that we will make is not going to be progress that is some great
dash for growth or attempting to overthrow everything that the last 16 years
have done,'' he said.
``It is attempting to set a decent direction for this country based on what I
call modern, one nation politics - radical but recognising that it is only if
this country works together and keeps together united as a nation that we will
make progress.
``The policies that we are putting forward - for example in the field of
technology and industry - are policies that will transform people's lives over
time and over time is not a bad thing to have.''
Mr Blair's essentially cautious message, while unlikely to please those on the
left of the party, marks a further step in his campaign to woo the middle
classes and reassure them they have nothing to fear from a Labour government.
He said Labour would be pressing hard for an early General Election, following
the Government's latest Commons defeat on Europe - although he expected
Ministers would resist pressure to go to the polls for as long as possible.
``If we can possibly bring about an early change of government then we will do
so, because it is in the interests of the country,'' he said.
He was scathing about the problems that the Government now faced with a tiny
majority and - with two by-elections looming - the prospect of a further cut.
``Although it is difficult to see them wanting an early election, I really
don't know how the country can put up with another 18 months of this,'' he said.
``In the House of Commons business has virtually ground to a halt. I don't know
what is happening in government any more.''

THIEVES have butchered three young lambs in a callous bid to get rich for
Christmas.
Police said that their remains were found in a field below Stirling Castle. The
animals' throats had been cut, probably with a kitchen knife.
SSPCA inspector Gordon Stanforth said: ``They would have died in agony and
terror. ``They'd have been chased round the field and cut by people not knowing
what they were doing.''
The remains were found by their owner, Jack Bain of Queenshaugh Farm, Stirling.
A spokesman for Stirling District Council's environment health department
warned the meat could be offered around pubs and clubs as a cheap Christmas
treat.
He added: ``This meat has not been properly slaughtered or butchered. It may
well be contaminated and poses a health hazard. Anyone being offered cheap cuts
should contact their local police.''

ONE of the critical points in the Lanark Blue cheese saga was the Sheriff's
telling comparison, in his 32-page judgment, of rival tests for listeria
monocytogenes on samples of the cheese by the Scottish Agricultural College and
the Analytical Services Centre.
The college had carried out its tests for Clydesdale District Council, the
results prompting the council's officers to serve notices on Humphrey
Errington, the cheesemaker, condemning the batches as unfit for human
consumption.
Analytical Services Centre is the laboratory testing arm of D&amp;M Clark, a group
of companies headquartered in the Motherwell Food Park specialising in a wide
range of food-related consultancy services. ASC has carried out testing work
for Errington since he started making Lanark Blue, and its sister cow's milk
cheese, Dunsyre Blue.
In his judgment, Sheriff Douglas Allan compared tests for listeria done by the
college last February with those done by ASC on the same sample cheeses in May.
The ASC results showed that no listeria was found in two samples, while in the
rest the count in each case was below 100 cfu (colony forming units) per
gramme. The college results ranged from 45,000 to 5,100,000 cfu/g.
The Sheriff decided the difference could not be explained by the fact the
samples had been frozen in the interim. In his final judgment, rejecting the
council's application, he went on: ``No reason for the disparity in these
results emerged from the evidence and, since the evidence did satisfy me that
the Analytical Services Centre results could be relied upon, the doubt remained
as to the reliability of the SAC results.''
Later he described the ASC results as ``reliable and accurate''. The outcome
was a vindication for the Motherwell lab, which, at one stage, had six staff
attending the inquiry. Three took the stand to give evidence. One of them was
Maureen Howard, who as supervisor in the microbiology lab, had been directly
involved in testing Lanark Blue samples for years.
``Listeria is always going to be there in that kind of cheese,'' she says now.
``They were saying the count was too high. We had found listeria, but at low
levels. We had also sent samples to the Pasteur Institute in France and they
got the same results we did.''
ASC has another reason for having confidence in its findings. Since December
1993 it has been NAMAS accredited for both microbiology and chemical analysis,
the only lab in Scotland to be quality controlled in this way. Under the NAMAS
system unidentified samples arrive at regular intervals to be tested, as part
of an ongoing independent audit.
The last time I met the man who, with his wife, founded D&amp;M Clark was five
years ago, in the middle of the great salmonella scare about eggs. David Clark
told me then that a little bit of food poisoning could do you good by
stimulating the development of microflora in the gut. But a lot more has
happened to the business in the past five years than a switch of focus from
eggs to cheese.
The creation of the separate ASC identity was a deliberate move to reduce the
focus on David Clark himself. ``With my name above the door, everyone wanted to
talk to me. But, with the role I'm now trying to play as chairman and MD, I
can't be involved in every day-to-day activity,'' he argues.
Although laboratory food testing remains at the core of the group's work, with
up to 600 samples a week being tested compared with just 200 a year ago, it has
steadily diversified into other areas. For example, since the mid eighties, D&amp;M
Clark has been involved in every commercial mineral water development in
Scotland.
Clark and fellow director Denise Johnstone play a part from the start, even
masterminding the sinking of boreholes to tap the right reservoirs. ``We got
involved initially in the water analysis,'' says Clark. ``But we soon realised
that, if the bores were drilled in the right way, our clients would get better
quality.''
From working with Highland Spring and the ill-fated Lovat Water venture, Clark
and Johnstone have taken their expertise to manufacturing companies which
require large quantities of clean water.
Some of the semiconductor fabricators, such as Motorola and National
Semiconductor, as well as general industrial concerns like Anaplast, have used
D&amp;M Clark to draw their own water from the ground. The group is also involved
with water treatment for hotels and swimming pools.
Another natural diversification was into managing the funding and construction
of new food processing plants. Clark is involved with two cooked meat plants,
one in Dumfries and the other in Glasgow.
``We do everything from the business plan and grant applications, to putting
the funding package together, instructing the architect, overseeing the
construction and training the staff. It's a full turnkey operation, and we
don't need to do an awful lot of them in a year to feel the effect,'' he adds.
The latest diversification is a joint venture - Alimek Clark AEIE - in Spain,
which opened a few weeks back. It covers the same spectrum of activity and
involves D&amp;M Clark and two women based in Spain, one of whom used to work at
the Motherwell lab.
``At the moment it's all go with faxes and e-mail to Spain virtually every
day,'' Clark says. ``But, in five years, the deal is we'll be out of it and it
will be self-supporting.''
Now into his late forties, with two sons - one in medicine, one in engineering
- who show no inclination to join the business, David Clark has set himself the
task of bringing good people on and building the business in ways which will
allow him, one day, to withdraw from it, confident that it will run on without
him.
He recruited Alastair Fleming, ex-Rowats and Greenmeadows, to head up the lab
operation and, in July, Fleming became a director. Another step in that
consolidation which will ensure a 20-year-old business playing a vital role in
the Scottish food sector has plenty more years ahead of it.

ACTORS and actresses don't have much of an image in Britain. Unlike Americans,
for whom fame is the prime justification, we mistrust people who think of eight
hours strutting in front of a camera as a hard day's work. I was given a chance
to test this when I got an audition for Ken Loach's film which is being shot in
Glasgow.
The production team invited me to their office which was in one of the old
wards in Knightswood Hospital. Ken (as I call him) met me there and I was shown
into one of the old doctors' rooms where I went through an acting exercise.
This involved a real actress called Anne Marie who played the part of a rather
upset mother who was giving a doctor (me) a hard time over the treatment her
son had been given.
If I looked convincingly perturbed and apologetic, this was less to do with
acting than it was to do with the fact that she was so convincing that I felt
perturbed and apologetic. Her distress was so real that even Ken Clarke would
have felt sorry for her.
At 7am last Thursday I was back in Knightswood getting kitted out for my debut.
The wardrobe girls triumphed in finding a white coat to fit me, which is what
hospital laundries fail to do, and by the time I had my pockets stuffed full of
scrap paper, I was Frank Boyle, the young intensive care doctor.
Having a whole day's filming, I thought Frank must be pretty important to the
plot. Should he be moody, or jovial? Kind or brusque? I wondered what qualities
I could bring to the role, then I realised I hadn't seen a script. Mildly
non-plussed, I got into the car to be driven to the set.
The driver was effusive in his praise for Ken. Apparently he ``doesn't work
like other directors,'' in that he likes the actors' reactions to be unforced
and natural (this avoids pratts like me trying to ``be'' the part.) The
production assistant spent 10 minutes telling me to ``unblock the creative
channels and be the natural self'' before I realised he was taking the rise. No
luvvies here.
The car stopped at the Southern General's car park. We weren't rushing to get
to work, we were rushing to get breakfast from the catering van. What a skate
this filming is, I was thinking: not a stroke of work done, and here I was
standing around tucking into hot coffee and a roll and bacon liberally dowsed
in tomato sauce.
When I got to the set, Ken Loach gave me a welcoming but vaguely quizzical
look, I thought he was amazed at how right I looked.
My scene was quite simple, culminating in a few lines of dialogue with the main
character played by Bobby Carlyle. It looked so simple, that I thought we'd get
the lot done by morning tea break and perhaps get home by lunchtime. Tea break?
At 2.30 we were still filming, trying to get the last bit just right.
Admittedly it was partly my fault. You might think that writing your name on a
sheet of paper, putting the pen in your pocket, picking up a folder, saying 10
words and walking off is simple. It should be. But throw in a 20-man film crew
and a famous actor and it feels like brain surgery by numbers.
Ten times on the trot I had to endure the same routine: clapperboard, camera,
lights, action. ``OK JP, walk and talk!'' Three times I tripped over the table
leg, twice I stuttered during my lines, and four times I picked up the paper in
the wrong way.
Everyone was really nice; not once did anyone demand my immediate sacking. The
professional actors, meanwhile, managed to produce carbon copies of their
actions time after time. The worst actor in the place (apart from myself) was
probably Ken Loach himself, who had to say ``Great JP, it's coming along fine''
about 10 minutes before he sounded serious.
After I'd eventually got it right, everyone was very nice. On my way out, Ken
thanked me, as did the writer, Paul Laverty (I think they were just relieved
that they could get rid of me). As my day was finishing, the crew was preparing
for at least another six hours filming. That night I slept soundly, dreaming of
the Bafta's ``and the award of Best Cameo Appearance As a Young Doctor goes to
. . .''
No-one's sure what the film will actually be called, but the working title is
Carla's Song. If you get the chance, go to see it, and look out for Frank
Boyle; he's the doctor with no acting ability, and a large tomato sauce stain
down the front of his white coat.

FORMER Barings trader Nick Leeson has until next Saturday to decide whether to
appeal against his six-year jail sentence in Singapore, his lawyers said
yesterday.
If he gambles on an appeal he is likely to be in court by the end of next
month, but he risks having his sentence increased to the maximum seven years,
according to legal sources in Singapore.
His lawyer, Mr John Koh, has now received the judge's written explanation of
the sentence.
``He's going to take the Christmas holidays to review the document and then see
Nick Leeson about it and decide whether to proceed with the appeal,'' said Mr
Koh's legal assistant, Ms Frances Silverayan.
Leeson, whose unauthorised dealings caused the #860m crash of Britain's oldest
merchant bank, was jailed after pleading guilty to two charges of cheating.
He lodged notice of appeal against the six-year sentence on one of the charges,
but did not appeal against the concurrent six-month sentence on the other
charge.
He received the written judgment on Wednesday. A 10-day period is allowed to
take an appeal to the High Court under Singapore law.

FOLK with an eye to a Christmas present bargains would do well to visit their
local newsagent this month where the shelves are filled to overflowing with
festive editions of their favourite magazines, most of them carrying a special
free gift which the canny shopper could wrap up and pass on to an unsuspecting
friend.
Healthy Eating for instance, comes with a useful recipe book worth #2.50. Dogs
Today offers a sample pack of light menu dog food while Your Cat has, not only
a packet of ``delightfully crunchy'' catfood but free cat calendar as well.
Bridal Guide comes with a handy wedding budget planner, Wedding and Home offers
a tiny bottle of perfume, People's Friend has a cassette of Christmas carols by
Paisley Abbey Choir and the home decorating magazine, Inspirations, carries a
miniature wall basket for readers to decorate.
Other free offers from publications like Crafts Monthly, Good Woodworking and
Sega Pro, include embroidery sets, stencil and brush kits (``valued at
#5.99!''), a guide to the world's worst B movies, a book of training secrets
for runners, a 200-page tool catalogue, packs of five Christmas cards featuring
your favourite football players, salami sticks and a mini pack of cornflakes.
The teen magazines carry free novels and pairs of tights along with the usual
badges and posters while kids' comics are giving away everything from stick on
earings and felt-tipped pens to plastic toys and Highland toffee.
Competition among the increasing range of computer magazines is fierce at any
time of year. No matter the month, they all carry one or more demo discs taped
to their covers to attract readers. So it's no surprise to find that most of
the Christmas issues are offering at least two of these freebies, with the
current crop including Where Does it Hurt?, a taster for a new computer
programme which lets you check the state of your health.
Just the thing for a hypochondriac friend or relative.

SHARE markets around the world were closing on a high note yesterday in the run
up to Christmas and the New Year.
At home, the FTSE 100 Share Index led by futures though in thin trading
finished up 25 points at 3658.3, just 22 points short of its high for the year
at the beginning of the month.
There have been hiccups along the way, but it has still risen 20% since the
start of the year, fuelled in part by Wall Street, which is almost always a an
important influence, but also by corporate activity and, in particular, bids
and bid speculation in several leading sectors including banks and utilities.
Wall Street has had an up and down experience over the past few days with the
Dow Jones Index sliding 51 points on Wednesday only to bounce back with a 37
point rise the next day. Yesterday Wall Street was ahead in early trading.
At present the main influencing factor in the US is the impasse over the
Federal Budget, which has meant a delay in publication of US economic data.
However, observers believe this is likely to be resolved soon. If so, it should
be bullish for share prices.
In Tokyo, foreign investors' purchases of blue chip stocks helped share prices
reach their highest level of the year, though it was still the worst performing
major equity market over the year.
In economic terms, Japan is now becoming more optimistic after going through,
unusually for that country, a troubled period. Certainly the outlook for share
prices next year is thought to be more enouraging.
``With no negative incentives in sight, we can hope for a brighter end of the
year than we have seen in a long time,'' was the view of one trader.
Brokers generally expect the Nikkei Index to maintain its current firm tone for
the rest of the year with the upward trend likely to extend into the New Year.
The outlook for shares in the UK must continue to be influenced to some extent
what happens in the US but the Federal Reserve recently sliced a !f-point off
interest rates to provide some stimulus to the economy, as did the UK, and the
trend in rate is downward.
This is a definite plus. And although the British economy has slowed, both the
Treasury and many leading economic gurus expect this to be temporary as
consumer spending increases. Also in the UK the high level of market liquidity
and corporate activity cannot be underestimated.
Brokers Henry Cook Lumsden suggests that it is no concidence that the run,
which has seen the FTSE rise more than 400 points in a little over six months,
began when institutional investors received the #6000m of cash from Glaxo's
takeover of Wellcome.
Assuming that all the current bids on the table succeed the total value of
take-overs in 1995 will be approximately #50bn according to Lumsden, a return
to the heady levels of 1989, which saw the peak in merger activity.
Topping the bill at present is Granada's bitterly contested #3300m bid for
Forte which took the market by surprise. And it is far too early days to judge
what the outcome for this will be.
Of course, if the equity market as a whole is to continue to perform, there has
to be a revival in the domestic economy. In the short-term, there are likely to
be further individual company profit warnings and downgradings by analysts.
The Chancellor has pencilled in 3% growth for next year, but if the economy
does not pick up as expected, then some further stimulus in the form of another
!f-point of interest rates - which many analysts feel is in prospect anyway -
would seem inevitable, particularly as inflation is not thought to pose a
threat at this time.
The importance of corporate activity is also stressed by Scottish Amicable.
Most significantly, cash consideration as opposed to paper remains high.
Against this, though, demand for funds from new issues and rights has remained
relatively subdued.
Strong corporate balance sheets and historically low interest rates have
encouraged cash bids and this is likely to continue to provide support for
equities at the beginning of next year.
However, as the year proceeds, attention will be focused on the broader economy
and this should impact on equity markets.

THE finest in Scotland's art will be on display in tourist information centres
if discussions between the Scottish Tourist Board and the Scottish Museums
Council on a computer database project are successful.
The click of a mouse button will conjure up images of treasures housed in
museums, galleries, and heritage sites scattered all over the country.
The ultimate aim is a database that consists of 100,000 digitised images of
important Scottish collections. This will be accompanied by text explaining the
historical background of the artefacts.
An official of the Scottish Museums Council confirmed that the STB was very
interested in the project - which is initially to be set up in schools through
cable and CD-ROM networks
The information technology project is part of Scran 2000, the Scottish Cultural
Resources Access Network that has been set up by the Scottish Museums Council
along with the National Museums of Scotland and the Royal Commission on Ancient
and Historic Monuments of Scotland.
The Millennium Commission awarded #7.4m to Scran 2000 in October of this year.

ABERDEEN-based OIS announced yesterday its rejection of drilling company Abbot
Group's #8.25m takeover bid.
OIS, which provides technical inspection services for the oil, petro-chemical
and power generation industries, said in a statement from its board members
that Abbot's offer was unacceptable.
``The board of OIS, which is being advised by Beeson Gregory, believes that the
offer does not reflect the potential of OIS and does not represent full value
for OIS shareholders,'' the statement said.
No-one from either OIS or Beeson Gregory was available to explain why they
regard the bid as a ``wholly inadequate offer''.
Abbot had approached OIS with an offer six weeks ago. After receiving no reply,
Abbot decided to go ahead with its bid launch anyway.
The drilling company is offering one of its own shares for every OIS share,
which values OIS at 27.5p per share. There is also a cash alternative of 24.5p.
Abbot chairman Alasdair Locke said on Thursday that disappointing profit and
dividend performances delivered by OIS since its floatation on the Stock
Exchange three years ago were unlikely to improve under the company's present
management.
The inspection services company was floated at 50p but has been below 25p for
the last three months.
The announcement of Abbot's bid, which came just before market closing
Thursday, pushed OIS shares up 7p to 25p while Abbot lost 3p to 52p.

HERITAGE Secretary Virginia Bottomley has brought the wrath of Wales down upon
herself after bringing down the curtain on plans for a new Welsh Opera House.
Hopes for the #86m showpiece in Cardiff's docklands were dashed after the
Millennium Commission refused to fund it.
The 1800-seat opera house was to be the ``jewel in the crown'' of Cardiff Bay's
#3000m programme to regenerate the economy of the Welsh capital and South
Wales.Supporters were confident of a #40m grant.
Lord Crickhowell, opera house trust chairman and a former Welsh Secretary,
described the rejection as ``a tragedy for Wales''. He was dismayed that the
Millennium Commission was not even prepared to risk #2.75m to take the project
on to the next stage.
He said: ``If it had been in London it would have been built.''
The opera house, planned to open on March 1, St David's Day in the year 2000,
was to have been the new home for the Welsh National Opera whose present base
in Cardiff will be demolished because of city redevelopment work.
Welsh opera stars Dame Gwyneth Jones and Dennis O'Neill were left
``dumbfounded'' by the decision.
The commission turned down the bid on the grounds that the opera house was too
big and did not offer value for money.
Mrs Bottomley, the chairman of the commission, said: ``We share the
disappointment because it was an exciting project with an impressive site. But
the business and financial uncertainties were such that the commission did not
feel, in the light of the professional advice we received, that we were able to
take it forward.''
The Shadow Heritage Secretary, Welsh Labour MP Ann Clwyd, said the decision was
``inexplicable'', adding: ``The Millennium Fund can find #55m for the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, and yet a vital scheme for Cardiff is rejected.''
Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid, based in London, whose controversial Crystal
Necklace design won an international competition for the Cardiff project, said:
``It's incredibly disappointing and very sad.''
Welsh hopes for lottery cash had to switch from song to the other passion,
rugby. The Welsh Rugby Union's bid for nearly #50m to help rebuild Cardiff Arms
Park will be considered by the commission in February.

<HEADLINE>Paper looks at further sheep scab measures</HEADLINE>

THREE possible new measures for helping farmers to control sheep scab are
outlined in a discussion document issued by the Earl of Lindsay, Scottish
Office Agriculture Minister, writes Robert Ross.
Until 1992 there were regulations on compulsory dipping and since their
withdrawal scab has re-emerged as a serious problem for sheep farmers. There
are now health concerns over the use of organo-phosphorous dips and many
farmers have gone over to using injections.
The spread of scab has been a source of concern to vets, farmers and
auctioneers. It also affects the value of pelts damaged by the scab.
One proposal from the Scottish Office is that local authorities should be given
powers to require common grazings or open, unfenced land to be cleared of sheep
for a minimum period where there is evidence of scab.
Such powers would generally be used where the grazier's association was unable
to resolve the problem by a consensus approach. When sheep were allowed back on
to the land only stock which had been treated against scab would be permitted.
It is also envisaged that it would become an offence to offer sheep with
detectable scab for sale, other than for direct slaughter. This would go
further than present provisions and would also apply to sales of sheep made
away from markets - the main route now believed to be adopted by the minority
of farmers and dealers who still continue to sell scab-infested sheep.
It would also become an offence not to treat sheep with detectable scab within
a reasonable time or after service of a notice by a local authority.
Lord Lindsay said: ``The sheep industry is very important to Scotland and I
hope that many people will take the opportunity of giving us their views on
these proposals.''
Although all secondary legislation detailing control measures for sheep scab
were revoked in 1992, it remains a ``disease'' under the Animal Health Act of
1981 and is technically notifiable to a police constable. The Government plans
to withdraw that provision next year but has promised consultation before any
action is taken.

<HEADLINE>MP accuses hospital trust of partisan behaviour after `strong lobbying' letter</HEADLINE>

A LABOUR MP is to lodge an official complaint with the Scottish Health
Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, and the chief executive of the NHS in
Scotland over what he claims is behaviour that has broken the rules of
political neutrality.
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, said a press release issued on
behalf of South Ayrshire Hospitals NHS Trust, detailing comments by Mr Phil
Gallie, MP for Ayr, amounted to ``totally unacceptable behaviour''.
In the three-page release trust chairman Douglas Brown welcomed increased NHS
funding for Ayrshire and Arran Health Board for 1996/97, attributing it to
``strong lobbying by the trust, the health board, and local MP Mr Gallie''.
Mr Gallie had said: ``Over recent years, the Government's aim has been to make
sure that everyone benefits in equal proportion from the ever-increasing amount
of cash injected into the NHS. I am delighted this week's news indicates the
success of the Government's policy and its determination to strengthen the NHS
whenever possible.''
Mr Donohoe said yesterday: ``It is incredible that we have an NHS trust using
quotes from a Tory MP defending a highly marginal seat in a press release
praising the Scottish Office for giving more money to the local health board.''
Mr Donald McNeill, chief executive of South Ayrshire Hospitals NHS Trust,
responding to the criticisms, defended the right to make the local community
aware of the Government's plans for public expenditure in the NHS in Ayrshire.
He said: ``It is entirely correct and in the public interests for this
information to be made available. The national picture was outlined in
Edinburgh last week, and it is important that the wider Ayrshire community
understands its implications for their local services.''
Meanwhile, Labour yesterday highlighted the ``relentless'' cuts in hospital
beds which it said were causing patients to suffer.
More than one in six NHS acute beds had been cut since 1990, said Labour, and
7664 beds were removed in England last year alone.
In that time the number of beds in private hospitals had grown over the past 15
years by 66%.

WHAT is the office party all about?
SEX (a): Photocopiers, staplers, Tippex, over the desk, the much-missed library
cuttings table.
SINCE new technology arrived, nobody gets to have the office party in the
actual office. Which is a great pity and a terrible waste of seclusion behind
the filing cabinets, but never mind. Our library cuttings table was a great
favourite. Underneath was like a four-poster. On top was like a wondrous divan.
It didn't just feature in our office party fantasies, but in the movie Heavenly
Pursuits, filmed in this office, when Helen Mirren and Tom Contie tried it out.
That's what you call pedigree.
But these days you can't have Davie the new sub pouring his can of lager down
the Power Mac. Well, you could all too easily, which is the point. Inland
Revenue allows companies #50 a head for the employees' Christmas bash, but the
insurance company is less benevolent. Hence the annual restaurant search for a
booking, and the difficult task of getting one that doesn't remember the fracas
of three years ago.
SEX (b): The Ride Home.
THE depressing truth has been revealed recently that 20% of males hope to have
casual sex at the office party, and only 1% of females. So most of this wishful
thinking is statistically improbable. Worse. Your office section doesn't even
employ 100 women, so at best there's only one female at your party who
entertains even a modicum of interest. And it isn't going to be for you, is it?
It's going to be for one of the 80% who isn't interested in her. Some party.
So, how come they're all sharing taxis together, and shoving #10 tips at the
driver?
SEX (c): Incapacity.
IF you got this far, incapacity would be the reason. Mutual incapacity. She'd
be incapable of telling you to ``sod off''. You'd be capable of sod-all. What
you had in mind was a party-popper climax to the evening. What you've got is a
crumpled cracker, and little understanding of how to get it pulled. Your party
hat is squashed. Your charm is crap. But there's always the motto, and the
motto reads: Go home. Or, like DJ Chris Evans, you'd better phone in and have
the PR department say something diplomatic after your 17-hour bender, like:
``He and the team have worked like maniacs for eight months so they deserved a
night on the town.'' Then get sacked.
HOME TRUTHS (a): A've Alwaysh Fanshied You.
YOU'VE been waiting all year for the chance. The office party, once the
inhibitions come down, is where what always needed saying gets said, at last.
With disastrous consequences.
HOME TRUTHS (b): You're a Shit!
DITTO!
CAREER MOVES (a): Toadying.
YOU'VE seen him. He's the one who laughs at all the boss's terrible jokes,
helps young Gerry to the toilet to be sick, sticks to Perrier, calculates the
division of the bill, organises search parties for giggling Elsa from accounts,
is still talking about the corporate plan for 1996 at the bitter end, and then
ferries the worst of the inebriates home in his Rover. The tragedy is he never
went in for social work.
CAREER MOVES (b): Hitting the Boss.
IT is always the quietest one in the office, the one who never complained and
just did all that was asked with stoical endurance. Friends said he/she was
looking a bit drawn in those last December weeks, and right up to the fateful
moment was hardly heard to utter a word.
CAREER MOVES (c): Snogging the Boss.
SHE says she never planned it, but just catching him there underneath the
mistletoe, it was like seeing him in a different light - he was almost human,
and why shouldn't bosses have fun, too? She is so generous, so charitable, so
capable of seeing the best in anyone useful, she is bound to make it to the
top. And she does, eventually. She calculated each step, office party by office
party, boss by boss. She got there. That's why you're snogging her now.
BEAN FEAST: And then we had turkey with cranberry sauce...
THEY take you through it course by course. They remember precisely what Geoff
ordered, and Pat and Mrs Taylor from reception, and what it looked like on the
plate, and what came next. They'll take you through to the After Eight mints
and the coffee, if you'll allow them, and this is three days after the party
when everyone else is desperately trying to forget the little they can recall.
THE SINGSONG: Sloop John B, Michelle, Yesterday.
THEY never know the words to anything that charted after 1968, and the tunes
were always lost. They were boring the backside off everyone after office
parties many years before Karaoke was ever invented. In fact, they were
probably responsible for inflicting it on modern uncivilisation. You suspect
they must rehearse in the bath in the weeks leading up to this fag-end event. I
mean, is it reasonable for anyone to know the entire lyrics to American Pie or
want to run through the full score to West Side Story?
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER...
THE blessing is you do forget the worst of it, the most embarrassing bits of
it. That's human nature. Regrettably, it's also human nature for everyone to
want to help remind you a week later. You hear bits of it second or third-hand,
and the galling thing is that this is going into the annals of office lore, to
be repeated and re-dramatised every time the next party comes up. Ultimately,
that's what the office party is all about: wonderful, amateur, helpless,
extravagant indiscretions.

<HEADLINE>Salmon farms may need more support</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>21</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974749804</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Fisheries Minister Raymond Robertson has called for an investigation
of the salmon market to determine whether further action is required in
addition to the imposition of a minumum import price for salmon announced
earlier this week by the European Commission.
While welcoming the commission's move, Mr Robertson expressed concern that a
minimum import price could not, in itself, address the underlying difficulties
of the market.
Mr Robertson said that he had explained to the fisheries council the importance
of salmon farming to the economy of the Highlands and Islands - and the
difficulties which had faced Scottish producers in the wake of a sharp fall in
prices.
``The introduction of a minimum import price should help put a floor on the
market, and I am sure it will bring some relief to Scottish salmon farmers,''
he said. ``However, it will not address the underlying problem and it will not
bring about a more stable market in the medium to long term.''
There were no easy solutions and that was why a full investigation of the
salmon market was required, he added. ``It is important that the Scottish and
other European salmon farmers co-operate in this study. The commission will
need hard facts and solid arguments.
The Scottish Salmon Growers Association have welcomed the minimum import price
as a first stage in tackling the problem of massive over-production by Norway.
SSGA chairman Phillip Thorn has suggested that the price control should not be
restricted to whole fish but should cover fillets as well. The association has
indicated that it will be pressing for further medium and long-term measures
including volume control on Norwegian exports to EU countries.

LEADING Scottish seed potato producer Gordon &amp; Innes Ltd, which has bases at
Elgin, Huntly and Banff, has won an export innovation award for its work in
tailoring seed to meet the specific requirements of overseas markets.
The award, sponsored by the Potato Marketing Board and organised by Food from
Britain, recognises the substantial growth of the company's export markets.
Gordon &amp; Innes exports seed potatoes to 23 countries, and overseas sales
represent more than 34% of total sales.
To meet the needs of overseas customers, the company has a dedicated department
which carries out detailed local research. This may lead to modifications in
the size of seed or to the delivery date. In the Far East customers require
delivery much earlier than in other markets. Gordon &amp; Innes has developed
growing techniques which provide early harvesting to meet the Far East demand.

<HEADLINE>Straw fears knife adverts fuel culture of violence</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday called for a crackdown on advertisements for mail order knives
as Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw sent examples of the pictures featured in
military and martial arts magazines to the Advertising Standards Authority.
He said he was shocked to see some of the adverts for weapons such as 10in
knives called Rambo Sidearm and Rambo Shortsword.
The adverts stated no age limit and Mr Straw asked the authority whether they
contravened its code of practice.
``There is a real risk that such advertisements encourage a culture of violence
- particularly amongst young people.
``Labour argued during the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill last year that
these sort of advertisements ought to be properly regulated.
``In response the Government said that the Advertising Standards Authority had
sufficient powers to make sure that they neither condoned nor incited violent
behaviour.
``That is why I have written to the authority's chairman, Lord Rodgers of
Quarry Bank, to ask him whether he thinks such advertisements contravene the
authority's code of practice,'' he said.
Mr Straw told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ``There is a knife culture at the
moment. These are openly advertised, then openly bought, then openly carried,
and we have got to hit the knife culture at every point.''
Tim Riffley, editor of Combat and Survival magazine which features some of the
controversial adverts, bluntly dismissed Mr Straw's complaints, accusing him of
portraying a ``caricature'' of the adverts.
``Our reader (is the) average British soldier who wants a knife to go to Bosnia
to cut up wood or cut up his meal,'' he said.
``If you were having an affair with your secretary and you went home and your
wife found out, she would not pick up Combat and Survival and think `I need a
knife'.
``These are practical people who want to use knives for totally legitimate
purposes,'' he told Radio 4's The World At One.
Tougher laws on carrying knives and enlarging police search powers are to be
introduced following the recent death of headmaster Philip Lawrence at a west
London school.
The new legislation, to be introduced in a Private Member's Bill, will be
backed by the Government and Labour, and is expected to be passed next month.

Women have been doing it for centuries. So what's all the fuss about getting a
man to try it? Paul Welsh introduces a friend to the art of sugaring
THE beautician spoke reassuringly. ``People are always apprehensive the first
time, John, but don't worry, you'll be fine!'' Let's hope so. For men, the
thought of hair removal is liable to leave them feeling nauseous.
Older than civilisation, popular beauty treatments including shaving and
waxing, are widespread, but the latter technique still bamboozles males,
striking fear into the toughest of them. ``How could someone do that?'' we ask
ourselves incredulously. Peeling-off an Elastoplast is bad enough, but bonding
a six-inch, hot-wax version to your lower leg then stripping-it-hairless in one
swift action, is simply madness.
After 3000 years of fine tuning, however, an alternative technique known as
sugaring is now gaining popularity, and this may demand a change of outlook. In
North Africa and the Middle East, this is the preferred method of hair removal,
practised there for millenia by aspiring beauties reclining further back than
Cleopatra.
XS Sugaring, a training centre and practice newly set-up in Bonhill,
Alexandria, has provided much of the impetus for this recent surge in interest,
and according to first-hand reports, sugaring is less painful than waxing, more
thorough and equally hygenic. Must be time for a man to try then? Well,
apparently not.
``Men are always reluctant to inflict pain on themselves,'' reflects XS
co-founder Mairi Stevenson, before the guinea-pig session begins. ``I think
there is a fundamental difference between males and females in this respect. I
am sure if a man had a child, he would only have one. Come to think of it, if
we left procreation to men, the human race probably wouldn't last very long.''
That's just what we needed to hear. Feart by nature or not, the first man to be
sugared in Bonhill was now quaking at the prospect.
``Certainly if you have been shaving, it's a bit nippy.'' Stevenson's business
partner, Jan Ferguson, explains. ``Taking the hair out by the root causes all
the pain and shaving makes the hair and roots coarser, so it is even more
painful. Consequent treatments are almost painless though. If the hair is
continually removed this way, eventually it grows back very fine, leaving the
type of down found on a baby. Personally, I was converted because sugaring is
only half as painful as waxing.''
In the Middle East, sugaring paste is made from tree sap, and in some cultures,
pubescent women still have their hair removed using this technique, remaining
hair-free for life. Ferguson and Stevenson have developed their own range of
products, however, including a Scottish version of the sticky honey-like paste
which is spread warm on the skin, before a deft, skilful flick carries away all
offending hair.
``I can't say what's in the paste,'' says Ferguson, ``because it's absolutely
top secret! It is predominantly sugar, though, 100% natural with no additives,
chemicals or anything like that.''
Another reassuring thought, unlike previous publicity for sugaring in Britain.
A number of years ago, home-sugaring kits had to be removed from High Street
stores after people burnt themselves badly with paste over-heated in
microwaves. And without proper training, the necessary action of sugaring can
also damage skin.
``Sugaring should always be done by an expert,'' says Ferguson. ``If you do not
have the right technique, you can bruise the skin when the paste is removed,
and it takes a significant amount of time to develop this skill. I could show
you how to wax someone's legs in an hour, but you cannot learn sugaring in that
time.''
Both Ferguson and Stevenson trained in the South-East of England, but since
starting XS, they have developed their own instruction course for anyone
interested in setting-up a professional clinic. It includes advice on tax
legislation, pricing, a code of practice, ethics and marketing, as well as the
technical details of sugaring.
``If a woman can turn a room over to sugaring,'' says Ferguson, ``they can
develop a fantastic business. I never thought I would be busy from home, but it
reached the stage where I could not cope with the demand. This is my first
business, and a complete contrast to what I was doing before. It is ideal for
job sharing, generating a little extra money, or even more - at the moment we
are training one woman who is taking her redundancy and going into sugaring
full-time.''
Training involves 50 hours one-to-one in Bonhill, and another 150 hours of
assessment, theory and practical work with models or clients at home, wherever
that may be. Sugaring ``graduates'' have alrady established businesses in
Glasgow, Perth and Islay, and the two partners at XS have enough clients to
regularly work 10-hour days.
Waiting to be sugared in their relaxing, pristine Bonhill clinic (a converted
ground-floor tenement flat), John had resigned himself to an uncomfortable
fate. ``I don't particularly want to lose my hair,'' he announced. ``If you
pull a hair out, it has to be painful, there is no way round that. Paul just
asked me to come down and give it a go, but my mum nearly hit the roof when I
told her. Mums love their boys the way they are, with no changes.'' But
sugaring is all about change.
``People are very self-conscious about their body hair,'' says Ferugson, ``and
you would not believe the variety we see. Facial hair, chest hair, all sorts,
so you have to offer a discreet service. If there was a demand from men, we
would have to arrange a separate evening or consultation time for them, as
well.''
Both HRT and forms of medication containing male hormones encourage hair
growth, and, as a result, increasingly more women require this service. The
specifics of personal motivation still vary significantly, though.
``Some girls are just vain,'' says Stevenson. ``They want their legs done but
you would need a magnifying glass to find any hair on them. Other women,
though, have bad problems with unwanted growth - for instance facial hair - and
helping to improve their quality of life gves me a good feeling.''
Only two questions remained. Could they do the same for John and was it really
so sore?
``I removed a man's moustache once,'' Jan recalls, ``but he nearly catapulted
through the ceiling. He was going to Kenya and didn't want to shave when he was
away, so his girlfriend sent him to us. Shoulders, chest or back are probably
better.''
Soon John was smiling contentedly, though, as XS pampered, prepared then
massaged his new, baby-smooth back. ``It stung a little but was definitely not
as sore as I thought it would be,'' he confided honestly. ``You would really
have to want this treatment a lot, but it's probably worth it for the massage
at the end. I'm a sucker for a back-rub - that feels great - just wish I wasn't
so fat, though.'' Don't ask why I didn't try but lipo-suction is next, John
fancy it?

TGIF, Radio Scotland's light-hearted end-of-the-week programme, was, as befits
the season, even more loopy than usual yesterday. We had a Los Angeles promoter
of singing dogs and moggies, howling their way through Queen's Bohemian
Rhapsody and howling their way through Jingle Bells. These records apparently
achieved some chart success, but we have no reason to be snobbishly superior -
the results were rather better than our soap celebs' ghastly renditions which
would turn the most sentimental Christmasites to Schoenberg Scrooges.
Austin Lafferty doesn't really sound like a lawyer, in fact maybe he's not and
that's why the BBC can afford him. Not that he fails to give good advice. On
the contrary, but he claims to send possible clients away when they approach
him with a libel suit. His colleagues consider such cases the prostitution end
of the market, and seemingly wouldn't touch them with a Gold American Express
Card. He laughed and said poor misguided folk call it ``deformation of
character'' but I've never heard of a lawyer who turns down business because a
potential client doesn't talk right.
You don't get legal aid for such matters, and the two guys currently taking on
McDonald's are representing themselves, with the help of a borrowed word
processor - and they're getting all the sympathy. Unlike David Ashby whose
libel action action against the Times brought more ridicule than the offending
article ever did.
I did miss a good source of defamation and gossip this week because yesterday's
TGIF did not include the latest from The Split Ends Salon. Kate Donnelly and
Clare Hemphill normally do a very funny line in lasciviousness amid the setting
lotions and cultural commentary among the curlers. Hope there are more
appointments booked for them in the New Year.
The humour of the Shargorodsky brothers, the subject of Samovars and Cuckoo
Clocks (R4) was blacker and more bleakly brilliant. Presented by Matthew Reisz
and produced by Virginia Crompton, the account of this Russian-Jewish satirical
duo made for captivating listening. This irreverent double act were kicked out
by the communist regime in 1979 as it became plain that the authorities found
them as funny as David Ashby found his wife shouting ``Poofters'' through his
friend's letterbox. Instead of getting their wallpaper shredded by talons that
obviously needed the attention of the Split Ends expertise, they were instead
relocated to Geneva, where the surviving brother Lev (Alex died some years ago)
still plies his wry trade in the local cafes, and sales of their material
continue to thrive.
One of their stories, So you're Jewish? Prove it!, read by comedian David
Schneider, found their grandfather in the novel situation of having to prove
his Jewishness, finding that his name, religious observance, and circumcision,
did not add up to non-Gentile status. Beautifully ironic and with the serious
undertow that is contained in the best humour, the story perfectly conveyed the
bewilderment of a man whose attempts to prove the patent truth of his identity
led him to parody his natural self.
Nothing could be less natural and more weird than the architecture of Las
Vegas. Tony Palmer, on Radio 4's Night Waves, conjured up a place so far beyond
tastefulness as to be surreal. The Luxor Hotel, an Egyptian pastiche,
four-fifths the size of your actual pyramid, with its own Nile running through
it, made claims to be educative, its displays putting Cairo to shame. There are
plans for a replicated Paris, with its own half-size Eiffel Tower. ``I have to
ask you why?'' said Palmer, and the reply came quick as a thrown dice -
``Because it's never been done before.''
A grotesque confusion of styles and a weird sense of Las Vegas as a historical
and amoral place where the redefinition of self becomes as possible as instant
wealth, have metamorposed what only 30 years ago was a ``private little town''
(a little secret of Sinatra, Dino, and Sammy J) into the American adult
equivalent of Disneyland.
This is a world of no clocks and few windows, which is slowly sinking into the
sand, a few desert miles away from the planned nuclear waste site. Las Vegas
has coined a new word - Signage - for its neon cityscape. There is even a
neon-sign graveyard for the discarded signifiers . . . I think if I won some
unearned money, I'd rather go to Paris, Paris France.

The Turkey - Profile
DECORATED in its Christmas costume of roasted skin, plumped out with sage and
onion stuffing, and served with a dollop of cranberry sauce, the turkey has the
image of a happy beast of burden. Children's cartoons often show them
high-kicking in a long line, the chorus in a curious Busby Berkeley number. The
line last Christmas numbered 10 million birds, found on 87% of tables - that's
a lot of little top hats and canes.
In America, where turkey is the Thanksgiving meal, devoured in honour of the
Pilgrim Fathers, the originators with the native Americans of the noble art of
the turkey shoot, the percentage rises to almost 100%. In fact, the first meal
on the moon, eaten by Armstrong and Aldrin, was cold roast turkey.
While factory farming has reduced the price per pound of turkey to less than
dog food - 29p per pound in Asda - there are always people willing to pay more.
Linda McCartney, for example, paid #95 per pound for Noel or Henley (depending
on which tabloid you read), a 28lb turkey which had been destined to feed the
customers at a Birmingham restaurant.
Her daring rescue mission was launched the same week as Free As A Bird, the
first Beatles single in 25 years - and a less-fortunate turkey, according to
some critics.
However, it was the first blow in a battle of the birds which went on to
involve ``Bootiful'' Bernard Matthews. Newspapers alleged that birds in the
great man's food factory were being maltreated, a point he denied but said he
would investigate.
As more people become aware of the conditions in which most turkeys are kept,
tastes may change.
But it remains a confusing market with choices available from: fresh, farm
fresh, traditional farm fresh, fresh frozen, frozen oven-ready, frozen with
water and ready basted. It is no wonder the British Turkey Information Service
Turkey Talkline - yes, there is such a service - took a call from a women
wanting to know how to thaw a fresh turkey.
This makes turkey even more complex dead than alive. Bernard Matthews once
said: ``All they need is food and warmth. They do not need to be taken to the
cinema twice a week.'' It is a fact that turkeys are so stupid that, one expert
pronounced, if asked to vote for Christmas they would. A professor of poultry
science at North Carolina State University discovered that they think entirely
in the present, with little or no concept of the future.
In fact, Turkeys can be so mesmerised by rain that they stand, beaks open in
awe, until they drown. New drinking containers are a mental challenge beyond
their limited capabilities, with researchers having to tug their heads down to
drink, and should just one fall in, the rest will foolishly follow. It's nice
to feel superior to something - even if it is only your Christmas dinner.
The turkey is also as pretty as it is clever. And so it resembles a vulture
with a hangover, one which has lasted 10 million years to be precise. Although
there exists a turkey vulture, they are not related.
The common turkey originated in Mexico where the Aztec Indians saw the large
local bird as an alternative to human flesh, and not as salty. So by the time
Cortes gate-crashed the dinner table in 1521, the domesticated bird could be
shipped to Europe.
One version of its English debut has it boxed and sent from Spain with a
consignment of bulbs. Another tale is of an enterprising cabin boy, young
Yorkshireman William Strickland, who sailed around the coast of North America
in 1526 and traded with the natives for six turkeys, selling them for tuppence
each in Bristol. Upon later voyages he soon racked up enough profit to charter
his own ship, buy a title and, as Sir William, have a turkey mounted on his
coat of arms.
Though the native Americans called the bird ``furkee'' it's current title was
as a result of a mix-up. Upon its arrival in England it resembled African
guinea fowl which had been imported through Turkey. At the time the guinea
fowls were called ``turkey'' by poultry merchants.
When the difference was noticed the birds were given separate names. The New
World birds acquired, incorrectly, the name ``turkey'' while the guinea fowl
was given its present name.
Despite problems of nomenclature - ``I don't know what it's called but it's big
and squawks and I'll eat it anyway'' - turkeys proved popular, especially among
the royals. During James I's reign the price of turkey was fixed at an
astronomical six shillings. Henry VIII enjoyed turkey, while Edward VII dined
on it at Christmas. The idea of eating certain foods only at Christmas was a
legacy of the mid-winter feasting.
To satisfy the growing festive demand, over the centuries a bizarre form of
``Wacky Races'' took place with farmers driving flocks of turkeys and geese
from East Anglia to London. The journey often took up to three months, and each
bird was fitted with little sackcloth footwear to prevent lameness. An actual
race in the seventeenth century resulted in the geese winning by 24 hours.
While the noble bird has poked its beak into the works of Tolstoy's Anna
Karenina, Marcel Proust's Swan's Way, it was Dickens who was the ``first to
find out the immense spiritual power of the Christmas turkey'' said Mrs
Oliphant, a critic at the time. It was a symbol of the bird's high regard and
expense that Scrooge replaced Bob Cratchit's goose with a turkey. Today he'd
have a fight on his hands.
In France a ``Jesuit'' was common slang for a turkey, because the religious
order raised thousands near Bourges. Thankfully a request for roast ``Jesuit''
was, in 1815, years after the Reformation. In fact, the French love their
turkey, but are wary of the beak.
Alexandre Dumas wrote in his Grand Dictionnaire De Cuisine of a turkey attack
on Nicolas Boileau, the literary critic, who was pecked on a particular point
that rendered him ``no longer capable of becoming an erotic poet''.
Yet the beast of yesteryear is distant from today's generation. Readers who
still wish to savour Monday's sweet taste may exit now - for the turkey remains
a beast of burden whose burden is, in fact, itself. Selective breeding, using
the heaviest birds, has bloated them to the point where they can no longer
procreate unaided or carry their own weight.
The factory-farming methods, introduced and encouraged by the Government in the
fifties, which have resulted in affordable turkey meat for all, has been at an
appalling price for the birds themselves. In December, Compassion in World
Farming highlighted the current problems.
A turkey's death is a two-stage process with the birds being shackled up-side
down on a moving line, the first stage is stunning in an electrically charged
waterbath, then, while unconscious, their necks are cut. However, up to 50% of
the creatures receive pre-stun shocks as their wings enter the bath, the
shackles are severely painful, and more than 35,000 birds enter the scalding
pools, which remove their feathers, alive.
The CWF are campaigning for a reduction in the time spent in shackles (up to
six minutes currently), a law stating that their necks must be properly cut,
and a more adequate system of stunning.
They seem so peaceful, cling-film wrapped and chilled in the superstore's
refrigerator that few people consider how they got in such a state. Yet from
the top down the tide is turning. Among the upper-classes duck and geese are
rated tastier, while a small but growing number of people, in light of recent
poor publicity, are demanding free-range turkeys. They still die, but first
they live.

Viscount Watkinson, PC, CH, businessman and former politician; born January 25,
1910, died December 19, 1995
VISCOUNT Watkinson, who has died aged 85, was the Conservative Minister of
Transport much concerned with the planning of the M1, although the first
section did not open until November 1959 after he had left that office.
He had an engineering background which was of help to him in assessing remedies
for the growing problem of traffic congestion in towns, the construction of an
underpass for Hyde Park, and modernising British Rail.
Although a member of Harold Macmillan's Cabinet from 1957 until 1962, when he
was one of those purged in the famous Cabinet Night of the Long Knives as
Macmillan tried to give his Government a new look, he attracted little public
notice.
He was more of a businessman than a politician and had a businessman's
frustration at the way politics often diverted ministers from taking what
seemed obvious decisions. Although he was colourless as a politician his
colleagues valued his advice on matters outside his own responsibilities for
its sensible bluntness.
Harold Arthur Watkinson was born in 1910. His father ran a small builder's
business at Walton-on-Thames. From Queen's College, Taunton, Watkinson went on
to study engineering at King's College, London.
After working in the family business for some years Watkinson concentrated on
engineering and became managing director of a machine tool company. During the
Second World War he served in the RNVR on Channel convoys and then as a
lieutenant commander in charge of training at the main naval anti-aircraft
gunnery school.
On demobilisation he extended his engineering experience to shipbuilding while
taking an increasing part in Conservative party affairs in Surrey. When he was
elected to the Commons as MP for Woking in 1950, his knowledge of industry and
defence matters won him quick advancement. After the 1951 election Churchill
appointed him Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation.
A year later he was moved to the department of Labour and National Service
where his experience of industry and good relations with trade union leaders
were a great help to his Minister, Sir Walter Monkton, who had a brief from
Churchill to avoid industrial strife but whose experience of labour affairs was
limited.
Watkinson made good contacts with both employers and unions and contributed
much to the relative industrial peace of that period, chairing a national
committee which produced a report on Human Relations in Industry.
Given a department of his own in 1955 he found his status elevated two years
later when he became the first Transport and Civil Aviation Minister to sit in
the Cabinet. What was technically the country's first motorway, the Preston
by-pass, opened in 1958. He had much to do with the planning of the M1.
In 1959 he became Defence Minister at a time when the forces were being reduced
in size and faced closer integration, leading to service rivalries with which
he had to cope.
With the Defence budget under fierce financial pressure the decision to abandon
Britain's own Blue Streak missile in April 1960 was seen as another admission,
following the Suez affair, that Britain could no longer play in the same league
as the two world super-powers.
Watkinson flew to Washington and began the negotiations which were to lead to
Britain's acquiring Polaris as a substitute missile. But by the time the deal
was finalised, in December 1962, he was no longer Minister, having been sacked
along with six Cabinet colleagues.
After leaving office he went on to hold several top-flight business
appointments, being group managing director Schweppes 1963-8 and chairman of
Cadbury Schweppes from 1969-74 with other directorships including the Midland
Bank. He was president of the CBI 1976-67.
Watkinson's belief in Government's co-operating closely with industry and
unions was out of step with the Thatcherite approach. Just after her arrival as
party leader he published in 1976 a study of British industry since the war,
arguing that politicians rather than management and workers were mostly to
blame for current problems. In 1987, long after his retirement, he surprised a
CBI council meeting by encouraging them to continue to resist Thatcherite
solutions.
He became a Privy Councillor in 1955 and was made a Companion of Honour in
1962. He married Vera Langmead in 1939 and they had two daughters. Thus his
peerage, created in 1964, is now extinguished.

THE Diary this week is devoted entirely to exchanges in the House of Lords
about pelicans in St.James's Park, pelicans - sorry, politics - being a serious
business.
Lord Stodart of Leaston: ``To ask Her Majesty's Government whether the arrival
of two pelicans from Prague was the result of a request made to the government
of the Czech Republic, and whether there are more to come to join Vaclav and
Rusalka with a view to restoring the number of pelicans in St James's Park.''
Lord Inglewood, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of
National Heritage: ``My Lords, the two pelicans - Vaclav and Rusalka - joined
the white pelican and the eastern white pelican at St James's Park in
September. They were brought from Prague Zoo. There are no plans to acquire any
more.''
Lord Stodart: ``I thank my noble friend for such a positive reply. Is he aware
of the fact that over the past 30 years or so, when this subject has been
discussed, questions have been asked about the possibility of reproduction
among the pelicans in St James's Park?
``On each occasion the Minister answering the question has been obliged to say
that because of his ignorance of the sex of the pelicans he has been unable to
provide any information.
``On this occasion, the two pelicans have been supplied with Christian names.
Does that give my noble friend the possibility of adding a plume to his cap by
refuting the claim that the only thing that knows the sex of a pelican is
another pelican?''
Lord Inglewood: ``My Lords, I am sure that your lordships are grateful to my
noble friend for having the interests of the pelicans in St James's Park so
close to his heart over so many years.
``As my noble friend commented, the two newly acquired pelicans are called
Vaclav and Rusalka. Vaclav is the same name as Wenceslas, a male name, and
Rusalka is a female name. When the pelicans left Prague Zoo the experts there
identified the sex of each of the pelicans.
``In order to ensure that they are no longer in the predicament of not knowing
the identity of the sex of the pelicans the Government have ringed each of them
so that the knowledge can be retained.''
Lord Campbell of Croy: ``My Lords, the Minister who replied to a similar
question on this subject in 1988 indicated that the park pelicans had not laid
an egg for 300 years. Is that because conditions in the park are not propitious
for the propagation of pelicans? If so, is it kind to import those pelicans and
so deny them a normal life with a mate, including the patter of little webbed
feet.''
Lord Inglewood: ``My Lords, an egg was laid by the pelicans in St James's Park
but it was infertile. I am advised by ornithological experts that the reality
is that pelicans tend not to produce fertile eggs unless they are part of a
larger flock of a minimum of about 10 birds. I understand that London Zoo plans
to try to establish such a flock. As for the nature of the community in which
pelicans live, that is similar to that experienced in monasteries and
nunneries.''
Lord Strabolgi:``My Lords, is it true that there have been pelicans in St
James's Park since the reign of Charles.II and if there are no pelicans there,
according to myth, dreadful things will happen? Can the noble lord elucidate on
that?''
Lord Inglewood: ``My Lords, the first pelicans in St James's Park were
presented to King Charles.II by the Russian ambassador in the early 1660s. In
February 1665, John Evelyn noted that he had seen a pelican which was `a fowle
between a stork and a swan'. I have no detailed knowledge of the myth to which
the noble lord refers.''
Lord Gisborough: ``My Lords, in view of the importance of pelicans and the
amount of traffic in St James's Park, will the Minister consider putting up
pelican crossings?''
Lord Inglewood: ``My Lords, that is a matter for the Department of Transport.''
This is democracy in action. Merry Christmas.

RUGBY
SCOTLAND'S top 10 clubs have arranged another meeting next week when they will
again try to hammer out a consensus on the issue of clubs or districts in
Europe next season, write Derek Douglas.
The meeting, to take place at Meggetland on Thursday, will debate alternatives
to the Scottish Rugby Union's plan for districts to fly the saltire in Europe
and for the make-up of the domestic season.
Even the top 10 remain split on the European issue with Hawick, Gala,
Jed-Forest and, apparently, Heriot's FP adamant that it should be districts,
whereas Scottish champions Melrose, and their director of rugby Keith
Robertson, have been among the principal campaigners in favour of club
representation.
Robertson has been a tireless campaigner in favour of clubs, and some
indication of the heated nature of the debate can be gauged from the fact that
the pro-districts lobby in the South are now privately suggesting that the
former Scotland star's work in favour of clubs - which he maintains is the only
realistic route for the the game as a whole - is incompatible with his position
as assistant coach with the South of Scotland district side.

\ROY Aitken, the Aberdeen manager, has a festive wish for for his young
players, and that is to put extra pressure on the club's established stars.
Aitken urged his Pittodrie youngsters to follow Stephen Glass into the first
team to strengthen their challenge for the top honours. ``I don't have a
fortune left to bring in new players,'' said Aitken. ``This must largely be
done through wheeling and dealing.
``It is vital for this club to keep producing our own talent. I know that
talent is there in our reserve and youth sides. I want them to pick up the
gauntlet and stake their claim. I realise it is a hard task to make the step up
and compete at this higher level. But Glass achieved this and the challenge is
there for these youngsters to follow his example.''
Scotland striker Scott Booth will make his comeback in the reserves today and
be pitched into the firing line at Falkirk on Boxing Day if he proves his
fitness.
``I now have all the first-team squad available apart from Colin Woodthorpe,''
said the manager. ``I'm happy we are in such a strong position going into the
demanding holiday programme.
``We have come a long way since last season. I am reasonably satisfied that we
have a trophy in the boardroom and lie fourth in the league with 26 points.
However, I have told the players I expect them to do better in the second half
of the league, show more consistency, and take a greater percentage of the
points.
``We have a good record at Brockville but will take nothing for granted. They
have had changes in personnel since our last meeting.
``Their manager, John Lambie, has been through the premier division survival
route before. He will have his players fired up for the task and it will be a
difficult game despite their league position.''
q HUNTLY manager Doug Rougvie will miss the festive double-header against Cove
Rangers - giving his understudy the chance to shine again for the scouts.
Rougvie had a motorbike accident a fortnight ago and has been off work ever
since.
The manager's absence has opened the door for young Mike Newlands to fit into
Rougvie's boots and alert the senior scouts to Christie Park. Aberdeen have
watched him and Celtic are reported to be interested.
Newlands' recent good form has led to speculation that 41-year-old Rougvie may
be set to retire and concentrate on managing the team.
Cove have won eight in a row, and victory in the festive games would cut the
gap at the top to one point with a crucial game in hand. If Cove fail to break
their recent hoodoo against Huntly, black-and-gold ribbons will surely be back
on the trophy.
The Buchan derby pits cup specialists Fraserburgh against Peterhead and both
will be looking to take advantage of any help Cove may throw their way.

q STIRLING Albion hope to have the chance today to move within three points of
East Fife at the top of the second division, but first they need a sufficient
thaw for Forthbank to be playable for today's scheduled match against bottom
club Montrose, writes Bill Sutherland.
Albion manager Kevin Drinkell will warn his men against a repetition of their
performance against the strugglers earlier in the season, when they threw away
a two-goal lead at Links Park.
Stirling last week hammered Queen of the South 5-1 at Palmerston and Drinkell
reckons he is finally getting the rewards for his patient dealing in aim. They
will have defender Paul Livering back after suspension.
the transfer market. Now, there are goals to go with the good football.
In the third division, Albion Rovers are once again managerless following the
resignation of Jimmy Crease. Joe McBride will take charge today against
Caledonian Thistle, but the player-coach will remain at the club only until a
new appointment is made. McBride's request for a free transfer has been granted
- but he obviously wants a shot today at becoming Rovers' manager of the month.
Chairman David Shanks said: ``Both have worked hard in a difficult situation
and I would thank them.''
If today's match beats the weather, Caley striker Iain Stewart is aiming to add
to his goalscoring tally before he jets out on a family holiday.
The 19-goal striker will miss three games, including next week's derby against
Ross County and the Scottish Cup tie against third-division leaders Livingston.

SKI-ING
LIFE is never dull with Alberto Tomba around, and the Italian, who boycotted
the giant slalom on the Podkoren course in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, on
Thursday, stormed back into the limelight yesterday to collect his second
Alpine World Cup slalom success in four days.
The win was the forty-sixth of Tomba's often turbulent career, moving him past
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli into second place on the all-time victory list
behind Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark, who won 86 times in the 1970s and 1980s.
Tomba, who recorded his first victory of the season on home snow in Madonna di
Campiglio on Tuesday, recorded a time of 1-36.84 to beat local favourite Jure
Kosir, whose home is only 10 kms from Kranjska Gora, by 1.21 seconds, with
Frenchman Sebastien Amiez third in 1-38.43.
There was talk of Tomba boycotting yesterday's slalom, furious as he was at a
decision to restart Thursday's race from scratch after fog forced an
interruption. Tomba, one of 12 racers to ski before the fog descended, refused
to go back up the slope for a second start, saying lack of snow made the course
dangerous.
The controversy appeared to fire him up yesterday and he charged through the 57
gates of the first run, setting the best time by half a second. In typical
Tomba style, he refused to ski cautiously in the second run, battling his way
down the hill again to extend his lead.
Despite the win, the thirty-first slalom victory of his career, Tomba was still
fretting about recent events. ``This is a great win but I'm not happy,'' he
said. ``Too many things have happened in the last 24 hours.
``People sometimes don't understand my reactions. They don't see that my
purpose is to defend ski racing and that I had nothing to gain with all that
happened yesterday.''
He then went on to accuse the Slovenian fans of trying to disrupt his final
run. ``There were whistles on the course,'' he said. ``In Italy we are always
nice when Kosir is racing. But I knew I was in winning form, it was just a
matter of putting two good runs together.''

Dragging himself out of drag is, well, a bit of a drag for Paul Young this
Christmas
THERE was an old Goon Show joke. Neddy Seagoon cried, deep from the heart,
``Christmas Eve, and still no offers for pantomime!'' As an actor, one knows
how he felt, but this year I am to be found dragged up as one of the Ugly
Sisters . . . oh yes I am . . .in Cinderella at the King's Theatre in
Edinburgh. Andy Gray and I are Agnes and Senga, the ``Sisters from Hell'' we
hope you love to hate. We even manage to get a couple of fishing jokes into the
script, and that is the fascinating thing about panto.
You can be in Inverness doing Dick Whittington, a story set in London, or
Aladdin, a story of old Peking, performed, perhaps, in Perth and you can still
get away with doing local jokes. Andy Gray's ``What does Inverness stand for?
It's no very exciting, right 'nuff. Even Saturdays and Sundays'' seems to
capture the mood.
Organised anarchy on stage is panto, and, I may say, very different from the
filming of our new series of fishing programmes to be seen early in the new
year on Scottish Television. Mind you, I suppose there are also similarities.
We had some wonderful days in Scotland but also travelled further afield than
we have done before in making the programmes, sampling the delights of fishing
in Alaska, Florida, and Northern Ireland, but always when away from home, there
was the Scottish comparison to be made.
In Alaska, we were fishing for salmon. Well, I've done that for a few years in
Scotland, but not for Pacific salmon, which behave in different ways from their
Atlantic brethren. Not only that, there are several species to be caught.
We arrived at the end of the Chinook or king salmon run, and halfway through
the numbers of chum or dog salmon - and just at the beginning of the silvers,
the Pacific salmon that looks most like our fresh-run fish. But I know of a few
rivers in Scotland where you can fish the equivalent of a well-greased
Muddler-type fly in bright pink where the salmon will follow and slash at it on
the surface. Or rivers where you can peer into the pellucid waters and see
groups of 30 or 40lb fish waiting to take your fly at the end of a sink-tip
fished on a nine-foot single-handed rod. It happened on the Alagnak Rivers and
what followed wasa bit of a . . . well, pantomime.
In Florida, we fished for large-mouthed bass. Sounds a bit like another panto
character, perhaps, but these are highly prized fish in America and we found
ourselves in a boat on a lake outside Dundee, Polk County, Florida. Would the
jokes travel? Yes. Dave Hoy, my angling partner, was on for it and though we
came from very different angling backgrounds, if he'd been in our Dundee, we
still had that essential point of contact in that we both just loved fishing of
any kind . . . Oh yes we did!
Then, out from the Keys at Islamorada, we met another band of strolling fishers
who differ from us Scots only in that they have the sun on their backs all year
round.
Telling them of night shore fishing competitions on the Clyde estuary in winter
elicits paeans of praise for our fortitude, but they know why we do it. They'll
tell you what hell it is quartering the deep blue ocean between the Keys and
Cuba week after week looking out for shoals of fish to keep the anglers happy
and trying not to get too much sun on their backs.
I was one of those anglers for a couple of days and was I happy? Oh! yes I was!
Northern Ireland after the ceasefire was brilliant. Optimism was three-feet
deep in the street. The anglers we fished with were brilliant but their rivers,
like Scotland's this summer, suffered from lack of water. We caught fish,
however, and made lots of friends.
But despite our journeys far afield, the biggest fish was caught in Scotland. A
beautiful late autumn morning in the Sound of Mull saw another Dave, Dave Holt,
put me on a spot where big skate are known to rove. A couple of mackerel on a
large hook, 400ft down, proved too much of a temptation for that rare
commodity, a common skate. An hour or so later, I got it to the surface. The
heaviest fish of my lifetime,
So making fishing programmes is a bit like pantomime. It can make all your
dreams come true. Oh yes it can!

ON a fine morning at the end of October, the period when such calamities were
almost always to be apprehended they found the Highland thieves had been down
upon them and swept away ten or twelve head of cattle. Rob Roy was sent for,
and came with a party of seven or eight armed men. He heard with great gravity
all that could be told him of the circumstances . . . and expressed his
confidence that . . . he should be able to recover them.
As with so much that Walter Scott wrote, that autumn morning is as fresh as
yesterday. But did it happen? The mining of Walter Scott's library which is
just beginning may strike the ore of historical truth from which the
introduction to Rob Roy is fashioned. However, that story of cattle thieving
and blackmail is already a primary source, told in person to the Laird of
Abbotsford. Scott knew as well as anyone the difference between the sparkling,
unpredictable stream of oral history and the sieved and channelled clarity of
the printed page. It is as sharp as the Highland Line itself.
On a fine morning at the end of October we crossed the Highland Line. The road
from Callander to the west takes you over the Border. Today there is no
language, no culture, no social and economic structure to distinguish highland
from lowland, but within a hundred yards of Kilmahog the form of the land is
utterly changed.
The road that took the blackmailers to the lowland cattle now takes the tour
buses to the highland coffee shops. The precariousness of the income may not
have changed as much as its nature, despite the Scottish Tourist Board's
promise of autumn gold. This October it was a promise fulfilled, because of the
gold that the sun had poured into the glens in the long summer and which now
fragmented into the browns and reds of leaves and fruits which shone above our
heads and fell among our feet in the woods of Balquhidder.
The trees were spreading their genes with a natural superabundance. No more
than one in a million seeds would germinate, just as each birch along the
burnside descended from one seed in a million scattered in Rob Roy's autumns.
The patches and strips of broad-leaved woodland catch the sun and throw it back
in your eye because they stand out against the tide of dark forestry that
washes up the braes of Ben Vorlich, Ben Ledi and Balquhidder. It was not always
thus. Walter Scott's informant had gone with Rob Roy to fetch back the cattle.
No shelter. No woods. Yet this October the glens were once again deep in trees.
The fat resilient nuts sit in their thimbles on stalks; these are pedunculate
oaks, not the sessile oaks of the Caledonian forest but a species any textbook
will tell you is an English oak. The landscape of Balquhidder today is quite
artificial - just as artificial, in fact, as the bare moors of the eighteenth
century.
We pay Rob Roy attention because he was the last example of a doomed way of
life.
After the '45 the meeting of the tales of the clans and the books of the
cities, which had begun with Tacitus in the first century AD, came to its
inevitable conclusion. The neolithic farmers, the Celts themselves, the red
soldiers and now the Forestry Commission: all had come from the south, like the
seeds of birch and willow after the northward retreating ice. It's just the
shape of history in Balquhidder, natural and human.

MEAN CITY, Ron McKay (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #9.99).
n.Glaswegians, and that includes me, have a wary civic pride in their city's
reputation as a hard hoodlum burg. We like the grim tales of gang wars and the
Runyonesque anecdotes that go around about our own local Dave the Dudes and
Harry the Horses, though most of us would run a mile if we met them, if they
let us run. This is where fiction comes in handy - for example journalist Ron
McKay's tough, intelligent, and exceptionally well-written gangster-dynasty
thriller Mean City, which takes up where McArthur and Long's No Mean City left
off in the 1930s and carries on to the present day in a blaze of gunfire and
gallows humour. It lights up its subject like a firebomb through a pub window.
I COULDN'T PAINT GOLDEN ANGELS, Albert Meltzer (AK Press, #12.95)
n.WHEN Jessica Mitford was in the Communist Party she always misheard the line
in the Internationale about ``the final conflict'' as ``a fine old conflict'';
and allowing for the lifelong anarchism that makes it unlikely Albert Meltzer
would ever have sung the Internationale, he's been fighting the fine old
conflict all his life. At various times a signwriter, boxer, printer,
copy-taker, bookseller, and a great deal else, he's always been there or
thereabouts in every working-class struggle of his long lifetime. His memoir is
cantankerous, dogmatic, fascinating, generous, and wonderful.
DELICATE MATTERS, Vickery Turner (Warner, #5.99).
n.JANE Hampton is 13 years old and lives in shabby-genteel London squalor with
her distraught and dumped-on mother, and a photographer lodger called Freddy.
Father, separated, plans to become an MP if his wife doesn't kick up too much
fuss. Mother works for a yob laundromat king called Vincent (a name and
profession right out of Martin Amis, if ever you saw one). A wry, mousy child
who reads like a cross between Adrian Mole and Candide, Jane reports on their
lives for a school project on love and sex in a manner that is undignified,
comical, and highly unlikely - which sounds just about right.
THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF, Jean Giono (Harvill, #8.99).
n.Don Quixote meets Albert Camus's The Plague in this marvellous
nineteenth-century French metaphysical adventure (coming to a cinema near you
next month, directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau of Cyrano de Bergerac fame), a
picaresque tale of love, loyalty, and contempt for death.

Clare Henry meets an artist with a morbid fascination            for medical
equipment and discovers how an Italian scholarship will take her back to basics
FOR such a nice girl, Julie Roberts has a morbid fascination with mortuary
slabs, hypodermic needles, straitjackets, tourniquets and operating tables! And
despite the subject matter, her paintings, exhibited in Paris, New York,
Hamburg, Stockholm, Lucerne, Budapest, London, and at the prestigious art world
Olympics - the Venice Biennale - have had great success. They are sobering
images, painted in a meticulous fashion - but gruesome they are not. No blood
and guts here.
Clean, clinical, shiny, stainless dentist chairs or operating tables float on
flat, plain, subtly stiped backgrounds as isolated objects, realistic but in a
vacuum, unattached to the surface of the canvas. She does them one at a time,
depicting the fearsome in an objective, routine, dispassionate way.
Unusual subjects for an unusual career. Roberts is a straightforward painter
who started as a graphic artist doing a lowly HND at Wrexham in Wales, and only
came to Glasgow later.
``I was doing a Design postgraduate at St Martin's and decided to apply to
Glasgow. I couldn't paint. I've never had any formal training. They must have
accepted me for my potential! We were all guinea-pigs, the first lot to do a
Master of Fine Art: Craig Richardson, Jim Hamlyn, Ed Stewart, Peter McCaughey,
and me. It was 1988.''
Roberts quickly became successful, and there are disadvantages to this. ``I've
been exhibiting ever since I graduated and so I've had to make my mistakes in
public.''
I went to see her in her sunny, well-lit WASPS studio high up in King Street
just as she was packing to leave for a year's residency in Rome. (``Before I
had this studio I painted in my bedroom, remember?'') She and her boyfriend
will drive a van there loaded with #2000 worth of canvas, paint, and stretchers.
``It's expensive abroad.'' One of the joys of that #4500 plus free board and
lodgings scholarship - other than 12 months in one of the most beautiful cities
in the world - is that, as Roberts puts it, ``I can **** up a bit; have enough
time to develop my work in private in the studio. I want to try watercolours
for my show at Glasgow Print Studio next October.''
Now 32, Roberts, who has been teaching at Glasgow since 1992, is the first
recipient of the Scottish Art Council's scholarship to Rome which supplements
SAC residencies in Amsterdam and Australia. The British School at Rome was set
up in 1901 as a top centre for research in architecture, archaeology and fine
art, and has a long tradition.
The facade was designed by Sir Edward Lutyens in grandiose classical style
based on the upper storey of St Paul's - but behind it, things are more casual,
even ramshackle. It caters for about 25 scholars in studios and apartments
around a central courtyard where in summer meals are, in my experience, great
fun.
It's ideal for visiting artists like Kate Whiteford, Will Maclean, and Paul
Neagu who, like Roberts, have taken advantage of its interdisciplinary aspects.
The school occupies a splendid site beside Rome's largest park, the Borghese
Gardens. Nearby are the Gallery of Modern Art, the Villa Guillia Museum of
Etruscan Antiquities, and the Faculty of Architecture.
In Rome Roberts plans to investigate ``the weird spiritual societies which
flourished there, the Italian obsession with stigmata and medieval bones in
cases. All medicine was done in the confines of the Catholic Church. And think
of all those paintings of the Resurrection. It will be amazing for me!''
The Vatican Museum, look out. Here she comes.
Rome is very unlike King Street, although the studios there are not so
different - however, I think Roberts could paint anywhere, for she often
obtains her reseach material via books.
In the UK she began with household objects around the house: scissors, metal
cooking equipment etc, which she painted on the walls of the Castlemilk
Womanhouse in 1990. For Windfall 1991 she had a go at buildings, painting the
walls with homes as shown by estate agents. ``It didn't really work.'' By the
time of her solo show at the CCA in 1992 she had found her topic: medical
instruments.
She isn't squeamish, she says. ``After my Nana died I did more medical stuff. I
did miss her. It was like I kind of did it for her. Some of the images are sad,
isolated, but others are very positive, such as the wheelchair for a
special-needs child. It shows something to help a kid sit more comfortably. My
work is less clinical, less hard, than when I began.''
At first she relied on up-to-date sales catalogues, selecting her tubular
chrome trolleys, stethoscopes, microscopes, and forceps from them.
Gynaecological items featured prominently. Then she visited the University's
Anatomy Department and local hospitals to see the real thing. In recent work
she has resorted to researching antique medical apparatus which she finds in
museums, some from Edinburgh's Hall of Surgeons, and from the Bedlam Royal in
Kent.
``I had gone as hi-tech as I could. I had to go backwards in time. A bit like
my studies. I'd never sketched, never done formal drawing. Now in Italy I'll be
able to go as far back as looking at the Romans!''
Roberts's objects include a First World War stretcher which she found in the
studio; old metal beds from hospital stores, a nineteenth-century field kit
complete with saw for amputations, and recently, old strait-jackets. ``The ones
for women are like a tapered bolero jacket tied with a thin string that a child
could break. I got it from Montrose. The other male version is huge, borrowed
from Bedlam Royal. I showed it in the Persistence of Painting show at Glasgow's
CCA in November.''
The new paintings are richer in colour than before; more iconic. ``I was
trapped in cream and grey monochrome! Now I try to get my feelings across.''
Drapery has become important, sheets on a bed, Freud's Couch (``It looks as if
it belonged to an old hippy''), scarlet plush and leather on an old-fashioned
dentist chair, coverings over a dead body, a positively lush table draped with
gold-fringed velvet, Irish linen, and chiffon on emerald or violet. ``I use
Venetian turpentine, like Rembrandt did, to give it                        a
kick.''
The first drawing Roberts did in Scotland was skeletal, ``on a big bit of
paper. I've gone round in a circle''.
I left the cheerful Roberts merrily packing. Her concern with the supportive
machinery which helps us when our bodies start to collapse and fail us, or the
complex interaction of medicine and the individual, may make some feel uneasy.
But then mortality usually does.

ABOUT three years ago German businessman Hans Nagel-Hayer was persuaded by a
friend to promote a jazz concert in his native Hamburg - now Nagel-Hayer, after
that first tentative involvement, is running a flourishing record label of his
own.
In two-and-a-half years he has issued more than 20 CDs and others are scheduled
for issue - all of them featuring a mix of the best European and American
mainstream stylists.
The roster of artists includes reedmen Kenny Davern, Bob Wilber, Alan Vache,
Danny Moss, Harry Allen, and Ken Peplowski; trumpeters are Warren Vache, Randy
Sandke, and Ed Polcer; trombonists include George Masso and Dan Barrett, while
among the pianists are Mark Shane, Brian Dee, and Johnny Varro.
Nagel-Hayer explains: ``I only got into this business by accident. A friend
asked me if I would promote one concert here in Hamburg using a band which was
being led by the trombonist George Masso. I did that, made a recording of the
event, and the label was born.''
Nagel-Hayer's interest in the music began at school when a liberal music
teacher played jazz records in class. Nagel-Hayer grins: ``I was only 15 years
old and in class one day the music master decided that we should broaden our
horizons a little and he played the Eddie Condon recording of Maple Leaf Rag,
the one where Ralph Sutton played the piano.
``From that time onwards I was hooked on jazz.
``After the first promotion, with George Masso's group, it was the trumpeter
Randy Sandke who asked if I would be interested in backing a Bix Beiderbecke
tribute he was putting together to bring to Europe on tour.
``I agreed, recorded that band, and everything went so smoothly I have
continued. The Bix project was a major artistic success and the record I issued
is one of my own personal favourites. Ken Peplowski solos on clarinet on China
Boy and that is just wonderful.''
There was a tribute to Buck Clayton, too, with Sandke as leader, and another to
Eddie Condon where Ed Polcer, who used to front the house band at the last
Condon's club on West 54th Street in New York, was in charge of a group which
had a clutch of British musicians including Roy Williams and John Barnes on
board.
And, as Nagel-Hayer said the other day, there are more albums to come. One of
these will be co-led by Masso and Peplowski while another will be an
all-European affair to celebrate the 65th birthday of trumpeter Oscar Klein.
Nagel-Hayer says: ``What Oscar has done for this CD is round up musicians he
played with in the different groups, Werner Keller from the Tremble Kids, for
example, is involved and there are others from the various groups he has played
in over the years.
``Apart from the Swing College, who recorded frequently in their heyday, not
enough albums were made by the various European bands and this one boasts an
all-star line-up.''
The CD will be on the Nagel-Hayer label, of course, just like all the others
which have been produced in Hamburg. The albums are all available from
specialist jazz record shops.

A SEASONAL problem has reared its head in the North: ``It's always difficult to
fit in all the people who want a reindeer in the lead up to Christmas because
they invariably want them on a Saturday,'' says Tilly Smith, who with husband
Alan runs Britain's only free-ranging reindeer herd at the Reindeer Centre near
Aviemore.
It is not the only problem. Christmas sleighs have to be purpose-built,
surrogate Santas are not always up to the occasion, and the reindeer
themselves, though co-operative and sociable, have a habit of doing what, in
December, comes naturally.
``Around now they begin shedding their antlers, preparatory to growing a new
set in the spring,'' Tilly explains. ``On occasion we have had to resort to
harnessing up two reindeer with only one antler each - one with the left side
intact and the other with the right - in a desperate attempt to keep up
appearances.''
While Tilly works hard to make her busy Christmas schedule a success, she
refuses to extend the season. For her and Alan the real business of reindeer
herding goes on for the other 10 months of the year as the animals range
naturally across the hillside and the annual round of calving, growing, and
shedding antlers and surviving the winter takes its course.
The Smiths' commitment to preserving the ancient traditions and culture of
reindeer herding earned them a place at the First International Gathering of
Reindeer People and would no doubt have met with the approval of the Cairngorm
herd's founder, Mr Mikel Utsi.
Mr Utsi, a Swedish Sami or Lapp, had grown up herding reindeer. In 1947 he
married Dr Ethel Lindgren, a Swedish-American anthropologist, and the couple
came to live in England. A trip to Scotland inspired them to set up the
Reindeer Council of the UK and embark on a mission to establish reindeer in the
Highlands.
On April 7, 1952, eight Swedish mountain reindeer arrived in Glasgow from
Narvik.
The early years were not easy. The journey itself took its toll and the first
grazing area was not ideal - too low-down, it left the reindeer susceptible to
midges, mosquitoes, and flies. However, in 1954, 2429ha (6000 acres) on the
northern slopes of Cairngorm became available and by the end of the 1950s the
herd was becoming firmly established.
It was Mr Utsi who began the daily guided visits to the hill and by the time
Tilly and Alan, who used to work for him, took over the herd in 1989, it was
clear that this was where the future lay.
``We have made the visits very much a hands-on affair,'' says Tilly, who can
put a name to each of the 100-strong herd. ``People are able to feed and stroke
the reindeer and even the most apprehensive are soon won over by the gentleness
of the animals who are amazingly at ease with visitors.''
And the visitors come in increasing numbers, often becoming involved in the
adopt-a-reindeer scheme and returning year after year to see ``their'' reindeer.
Meanwhile, anyone wanting to book one or two for Christmas has to do so well in
advance, as the lady who has already inquired about their availability for the
millennium clearly realises. Still, at least she wants them on a Sunday.
Looks like reindeer are still a popular part of the Christmas tradition. Sue
Clapham meets a couple who care for real-life Rudolfs all year round

IT sounds a contradiction from what some folks regard as the real world of
football to say that Airdrie are not finding success in the first division all
that easy.
And when coach John McVeigh admits that part of the problem seems to be that
they are not ``digging in hard enough,'' the cynics, as well as those not too
well up on the hard facts that surround the first division battle, may well
mock such a statement coming from a club whose past on-field reputation still
has a habit of going before them.
So be it. And if the tight confines of Kilbowie Park survive the weather today
- frost, fog, and now possibly flood being the enemies - the rearranged meeting
against Clydebank will go ahead with an Airdrie squad arriving with a
kindergarten look about them.
With Sean Sweeney and Steve Cooper suspended, and only a first-team pool of 15
to start with - and that includes the long-term injury to Paul Jack - Paul
Bonnar, John McClelland, Gerry McKenna, and Gordon Connolly, all 18, and Tony
McPeek, at 19, will travel with the squad.
McVeigh admits that it's time Airdrie began to pick up the odd three points or
so, and with his side on 23, ahead of Clydebank only on goal difference, today
would be a good way to start.
Bankies, of course, have the same aim . They will have defender Paul Livering
back after suspension.

FOR seven years Stephen Wright kept it a secret, but in the last five months he
has been free to admit the truth: he was a Rangers fan as a boy in Hamilton. It
would not have been a prudent revelation when he was signed, nurtured and
matured by one of the Ibrox club's greatest rivals, Aberdeen, but after Walter
Smith paid #1.2m to bring him south from Pittodrie the Rangers affection could
be confessed without incurring the wrath of the gangs in the stand.
That deep-seated enthusiasm for the Govan team was the main reason why he did
not have to think long and hard when Smith made his desire clear. The other
factor was just as obvious, the chance to join the biggest club in the land.
If the thrill of that move is still easy to detect in the 24-year-old's
demeanour, it is also true that it was perhaps better that he could not foresee
what was to become of him after only four months savouring the new life in
Glasgow.
In a game that has become notorious for other reasons, the Champions' League
meeting with Juventus at Ibrox last month (it ended 0-4, but for obvious
reasons it seemed a good idea not to dwell on the scoreline), Stephen went down
in a tackle and knew immediately something in his knee had ``gone''. The injury
turned out to be severe damage to his cruciate ligaments, the same kind of
problem which afflicted Ian Durrant and Andy Goram, two of his new team-mates
at Ibrox.
After such a short time in Glasgow when he was still establishing his
credentials in the side, it was a desperately tough blow for the player but, if
it upset him at the time, there was soon a return to that phlegmatic acceptance
of the situation which seems to be a hallmark of the player's nature. He would
admit to being a bit laid-back and that very quality has helped him cope
sensibly with the damage, mental as well as physical, such a serious injury can
have on a player.
Stephen has been to America for surgery, following on Durrant and Goram, both
of whom were able to assure the new boy that he had every reason to be
optimistic. He is also grateful Rangers have allowed him to get the best
possible treatment from the experts in the field and reckons that this is only
one benefit of being with a club as significant in standing as the Ibrox lot.
``It is only when you come here that you realise just how enormous this club
really is. Ten or 15 years ago, though, even Rangers might have not been able
to do much about this kind of injury and I have to be very thankful that
technology is available to tackle it.''
Wright is aware that not so very long ago damage such as he sustained would
probably have ended his career. Now after his operation all seems to going
according to plan, but even at that he has had to count off this season totally
in terms of playing for the top team again. His daily routine in the meantime
involves keeping in trim by taking to the pool at Ibrox where he walks in the
water to strengthen his leg. The club physiotherapist has set no targets,
preferring to let nature take its course, but Stephen is delighted with
progress, especially now that he has been able to discard the crutches.
A naturally fit young man, Wright has at least one consolation at being
sidelined in that he can give Christmas dinner some dedicated application,
unlike his mates who will be in action on Boxing Day.
That will not prevent him feeling extremely frustrated on the day for, like
most footballers, he is not the best of watchers. However, his pragmatism comes
in handy at these times as he shrugs his shoulders and waits for the healing
time to pass.
It was not what he had envisaged when he made the move from Pittodrie where
last season he had to endure, along with the rest of the Aberdeen regulars, the
nerve-jangling race against relegation.
``The difference this season has been incredible,'' he says. ``As well as
leading the league there has been the Champions' League and big crowds all the
way. The demands are tremendous, too, because you are expected to do well all
the time.''
He will have to hang on a touch before he can attempt to perform that difficult
feat but in the meantime he is also free to let us know that his schoolboy hero
was a man whose death proved to be the saddest moment of 1995. Davie Cooper, he
of the feinting hips and devilish control, was the fellow Hamiltonian who stood
above them all for the young Stephen Wright. ``I can remember my dad, who knew
Davie's father, arranging a visit for me to Davie's home. I was only small but
I can remember it clearly.''
In due course the Cooper fan had to become a Cooper opponent and in this case,
a direct opponent. Wright had to try to shackle the great man when Motherwell
met Aberdeen. ``He maybe wasn't as good as he had been but his skill was still
tremendous,'' he recalls with admiration, ``but I think I did all right against
him. It wasn't easy to play against somebody you idolise.''
It was not Rangers who spotted the teenager with Eastercraigs but Aberdeen and
he signed from them as a 16-year-old. Within two years he had broken into the
first team, taking over from the injured Stewart McKimmie and more or less
staying in the top squad ever after.
Now as a Rangers player he has had to try to handle, among other things, the
ferocity of the Old Firm derby, but maybe his view of that is a little
surprising. ``To be honest I didn't think it was any different from games
between Aberdeen and Rangers. The atmosphere is fantastic, of course, but on
the field the competitivenes is much the same. I enjoyed it.''
He still keeps contact with some of his ex-team-mates at Pittodrie but, while
he is pleased for them that they won the Coca-Cola Cup, he would much preferred
it if he had been the one picking up a medal. Any medals will have to wait as
Stephen goes walkabout in the swimming pool, dreaming of the day he can put on
that Rangers shirt again. ``All I am thinking about just now is getting fit and
then getting back into the Rangers team. I don't want to look beyond that.''
If he hadn't been injured his thoughts might occasionally have strayed towards
next summer and the possibility of making it into the Scotland squad.
Capped twice already, Wright one day perhaps will be the natural successor to
his old Pittodrie colleague, Stewart McKimmie, in the Scotland team.
For the moment he will take the recovery programme stage by stage . . . and
have a Christmas dinner to remember with his wife Liska in the new house they
moved into a few days ago.

EVERTON striker Duncan Ferguson will know the outcome of a judicial review to
determine his immediate future next month. The hearing, granted at the club's
request on the grounds of `double jeopardy,' will now take place on January 19
and not in March as expected.
Everton claim that Ferguson will have been punished twice for the same
head-butting offence if he is forced to complete a Scottish FA imposed ban,
having already spent six weeks in prison.
If the claim is not upheld, he will have to serve out the remaining seven games
of a 12 match ban.
Meanwhile, flu has ruled Ferguson out of today's Premiership trip to Coventry.

STATISTICAL analysis of the 1995 World Cup suggests that you kick the ball
rather than pass to win rugby games, and Scotland don't play the right way to
help themselves.
But first, an award has been given for the best communication of this summer's
World Cup, and it has gone to a little eight-year-old New Zealand boy from
Wellington, who made his father fax the All Blacks with the following endearing
message: ``Remember, rugby is a team game. All 14 of you, pass the ball to
Jonah ..... Yours, etc.''
Remember the World Cup? It was six months ago that we lucky people in life went
there for six weeks to watch it and write about it. Now, the facts and figures
have been compiled to give a real insight into the way rugby is going, and the
way the game has changed over the three competitions, 1987, '91, and '95. Alun
Carter and Gareth Potter, of the Centre for Notational Analysis of the Cardiff
Institute of Higher Education, examined all the games, and they come up with
some funny old statistics. Some of them give us a fright.
Excluding extra time, the average game in the 1995 finals had the ball in play
for under 27 minutes of games lasting an average of 84 minutes. The average
match featured 179 passes, 96 kicks, 37 lineouts, 27 scrums, and 25 penalties
or free kicks.
Only three games broke the 30-minute barrier when it came to ball in play.
But do you know one of the most significant bits of statistical analysis that
has come from the World Cup '95? No? Well, it happens to be that the numbers
say that the winning sides kicked the ball more than the unsuccessful ones, who
appeared to pass more.
Taking a pass/kick ratio as a starting point, the losing sides in the last
eight matches passed the ball more than the winning ones. You have to take
France out of that equation, because they pass the ball even when they are on
their death-beds. But if you take, say, Scotland versus New Zealand as an
example, then you see that Scotland passed 94 times and kicked 50, whereas New
Zealand passed 93 and kicked 52. It's close, but it works.
When New Zealand stuffed England, the English made 120 passes but kicked 45
times, the Kiwis passed only 72 times and kicked 54.
In the final, New Zealand, and we all remember this, kicked 53 and passed 107.
The South Africans kicked about the same, 56, but made only 67 passes. It seems
to stack up, doesn't it? Losers pass the ball more than winners. Frightening,
and it's been the same for all three finals.
But a big question is: If the ball was in play for an average of just under 27
minutes in a game, then what the heck was going on for the rest of the time?
The answer is that the teams were preparing. Yep, preparing. Of the total rugby
time in the World Cup, about 2700 minutes, the ball was in play for
approximately 850 minutes and out of play for 1860.
Of that time, 312 minutes were spent preparing for scrummages, 502 waiting for
lineouts, 152 preparing for restarts, and 474 preparing for kicks at goal.
Scotland, believe it or not, spent more time preparing for kicks at goal than
any other team - with Gavin Hastings attempting 28 penalties in four matches
which took a total of more than 34 minutes, which is 73 seconds per kick.
Another proud statistic the Scots have is that we took the longest time, on
average, to prepare for scrummages at more than 25 seconds. On paper we top the
league of average total preparation time per game at 29 minutes, but that's
distorted because of the number of tries scored and therefore lining up
conversions is included.
However, a point worth considering is this then: we, in Scotland, make our
players jump through hoops to get fitter and leaner than the opposition, but in
games we let our opponents take a rest. It doesn't make sense to do that but
that's what the numbers say we do.
But how has rugby changed over the three sets of finals? My favourite statistic
is the one that shows how the teams that won in '87, '91, and '95 have changed
the general style of play, on average, at the knock-out stages. And do you know
the biggest change? They kicked more and passed less in '91 and '95 than they
did in '87, despite all the law changes.
In 1987, on average, New Zealand, the winners, kicked 48 times and passed 94.
In 1991 Australia kicked 61 and passed 66, and in 1995 South Africa kicked 55
and passed 65.
So my little message to those at the top is: the competition was wonderful, but
it could be better. I want to see more passing and less kicking. And I want to
see Scotland hurry it up on the field, too.

ARCHIE AND THE LISTERS
Robert Edwards
Patrick Stephens, #17.99
ARCHIE Scott Brown had the looks of Errol Flynn as he sat in the racing car,
but he used only his left arm for driving and his tiny legs could barely
support his weight. Archie was born handicapped after his mother had German
measles in 1927. An orthopaedic surgeon, Naughton Dunn, broke and reset the
boy's legs to straighten them. His feet had to be virtually amputated, rotated,
and re-attached the right way round, without damaging the nerves.
Archie and the Listers is a story of guts, a fight not only against deformity
but family troubles. His father, a First World War flying ace who was in the
motor trade in Paisley and Glasgow, became an alcoholic and the boy had to find
his own feet. ``By 1933 Archie was walking, after a fashion. His method,
encumbered first by plaster casts, then callipers and surgical boots, was
simplicity itself. He would trot, bottom sticking out, body leaning forward and
close to toppling over, arms waving to retain balance. By the time he was eight
he had mastered locomotion, but it became clear that his lower legs were not
going to grow any more.''
His parents bought him a pedal car, and he discovered a new form of speed where
the power came from beyond his legs. When Archie was sent to Merchiston Castle
School in Edinburgh his maternal granny thought he looked odd, and insisted
upon an artificial hand.
The boy wore it, but it ``crippled and humiliated him,'' and the headmaster
urged its removal. Archie went up to St Andrews University, but instead of
economics textbooks he absorbed himself in the Autocar, becoming a
``moustachio'd cavalier, quick with a joke, very handsome, a little on the
short side, right arm inevitably shoved into the pocket of a nicely-cut tweed
coat''.
His mother Jay separated from her husband and went south with her son to his
post as a sales rep in East Anglia with George Dobie and Sons, the tobacco
company. The cruel granny, who had imposed the artificial hand, left Archie
#1000, which he invested in an MG TD.
The story accelerates. Brian Lister designed the cars, Don Moore developed the
engines, and Archie Scott Brown raced them in the heady 1950s. Despite his
handicap, he had notable wins and his mother was his greatest fan. He was in
the lead in the Belgian Sports Car Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps on May 18,
1958, when he came off the wet track in his Lister-Jaguar, which somersaulted
into straw bales and burst into flames. He died as a result of severe burns.
Robert Edwards, his sympathetic biographer, writes: ``With an interval of
nearly 40 years, it is hard to believe how popular Archie was. He enjoyed a
relationship with the racing public and, more importantly, his peers, that
virtually no British driver, before or since, has ever approached.'' His father
scattered Archie's ashes on the Clyde side of the Isle of Arran, overlooking
the waters they had sailed together, on a hill known as the Sleeping Warrior.
This isn't only a story of motor racing: it's the story of a man taking the
chequered flag for courage, an example to the handicapped, and a lesson to the
sound of limb never to write a person off.

THE English Premiership yesterday threw a considerable spanner into the works
by scrapping their own restrictions on European Union players as the two major
governing bodies in world football, FIFA, and UEFA, remained firmly behind
their three-foreigner rule in the face of last week's Jean-Marc Bosman judgment
in Europe.
The consequence would seem to be that UEFA is standing by a set of rules for
its competitions which the top English league authorities believe is against EU
law and cannot be enforced in England.
Until yesterday, only three non-British Isles players were allowed to appear in
any one game in the Premiership, but the decision by the European Court last
Friday, which ruled that UEFA's ``foreign players'' rule was illegal, led to
the league taking legal advice about whether the rule could still be enforced.
That rule was challenged by Manchester City, who asked for permission to field
new Danish loan signing Ronnie Ekelund alongside German duo Eike Immel and Uwe
Rosler and Georgian Georgiou Kinkladze.
Premier League chief executive Rick Parry announced: ``We have advised our
clubs that, with immediate effect, the restrictions which govern foreign
players can no longer be applied to citizens of the European Union.
``Clubs are therefore free to play as many European Union nationals as they see
fit.''
If that is taken to its logical conclusion that would mean that in the
Premiership's opinion, Nottingham Forest, their last European contenders in the
UEFA Cup, could not be forced to stick to three foreigners (and two assimilated
players) in the quarter-final next March, even though UEFA have insisted that
the rules of the competition cannot be changed halfway through.
Parry went on to say: ``The legal advice we have received makes clear that
rules which attempt to limit the number of EU nationals are unenforceable in
the light of the Bosman judgment. We have accepted that advice and are now in
the process of informing our clubs of that position.
``In due course, relevant rule changes on these matters will be brought forward
following consultation on possible limits governing non-EU citizens.
``We believe that in offering this advice, we are acting sensibly and
appropriately. We have stressed throughout the discussion on the Bosman case
that sports governing bodies must proceed properly and with the right legal
advice. These principles have guided the Premier League's approach to all of
the issues relating to Bosman.
``We are, of course, aware of the statement issued today by FIFA and UEFA. We
accept fully that in the interest of continuity and fairness, competition rules
should not be changed part-way through the season.
``However, our legal advice is clear - current rules on EU nationals, even if
maintained, cannot be enforced.''
The chief executive said that the League would be having further discussions
with the EU and in the meantime take legal advice on the rule governing
transfers.
The hope is that the divergence of views will have been ended by the time the
European tie comes around, but after their meeting yesteday, FIFA and UEFA made
their position clear, saying that the current three-plus-two rules would remain
in operation for the rst of this season.
``It is in the interests of continuity and fairness in every sporting
competition that the regulations are not changed during the course of the
competition.''
The advice may be good, but already football folk are paying close attention to
the new game that is taking place off the field. Celtic manager Tommy Burns
demonstrated that when he talked of his approach to the transfer market since
Bosman won his case.
``The freedom of players to move at the end of their contract has put
everything into a different light, from everybody's point of view,'' said Burns
who has been abroad this week, ``It affects both the buying club and the
sellers because you can go and look at a player just now who might be worth #2m
but can be got for nothing at the end of the season.
``We are looking at players because it is part of our job but we are not
desperately hunting for new men. We are lucky that way because the players we
have here are motivated and determined and playing very well.
``If I think we still need a certain player we will still buy him but we go
into negotiations in a different position now. We can go in knowing that the
other club are going to lose him for nothing at the end of the season anyway.''
Meanwhile, FIFA and UEFA insist that they are working to reach an agreement
with the international players union to combat the new ``free transfer'' era.
Immediately, however, the two bodies have decided to try to prevent clubs
taking advantage of the situation with a ``back door'' scam to get players for
nothing.
If for instance, an out-of-contract Rangers player was wanted by Liverpool, he
could be signed by a French team and then transferred for nothing to Liverpool,
leaving Rangers with nothing for a player who might have been a #2m man. ``We
will act to ensure that artificial international transfers are not misused as a
means to dismantle domestic transfer regime ``by the back door.''

n.THIS little gadget is probably how today's hi-tech Santa Claus manages to
remember, with miraculous accuracy, which child should get what present this
Christmas. It's a Pereos mobile storage unit from Datasonix, and it's small
enough to fit into a pocket. What makes it different is the amount of
information it can store. It takes a cartridge that's the size of a postage
stamp, and in that tiny space it can hold more information than a shelf of
encyclopaedias.
Quite remarkably, the little cartridge         can store the equivalent of 968
floppies, or about 1000 reasonable-sized novels. The system has been designed
to meet the needs of portable computers, and the makers            say it's
ideal for architects, executives, lawyers, accountants, editors, and engineers.
Ideal too for elderly philanthropists in red suits.
The Pereos eliminates the need to decide what information to download on to the
laptop. The bottomless well of a cartridge can store every fact they need to
have on hand. While mobile computer users are using the most powerful laptops
these days, they still have to carry around bags of documents and floppies. The
Pereos is designed to cut down on the baggage. It holds an astonishing 1.25
gigabytes of data, runs on two standard A   batteries, and needs less space
than a can of Irn-Bru.
Selling for about #700, it automatically backs up to protect data, has a system
to track misplaced files and has a transfer time of 1 meg every six seconds.
Datasonix says that transferring a 100 megabyte file would save almost a full
day.
And just in case our message is not stored on Santa's system, we'd like one of
these in our stocking.

Old School Rap 2; Eighties Garage Classics Volume 2; Electro Classics Volume 2,
various (all Deep Beats/Castle)
q Knowest where thou cometh from, dude: only then wilt thou be able to advance
righteously with a properly-chosen groove. This ongoing archival series traces
the roots of dance music in the early eighties. Old School Rap focuses on the
grist created at New York's Sugarhill and Sleeping Bag labels in 1981-82.
In addition to the timeless Adventures On The Wheels Of Steel by Grandmaster
Flash, there is plenty of sinuous synth-bass and perkily-mechanical rhythm. The
Eighties Garage collection is distinguished by Cuba Gooding's Happiness Is Just
Around The Bend.
It's Electro Classics which comes up trumps, however, from the ironic
Latin-tinged mechano-funk of Konk's Your Life to Nairobi's camp,
Kraftwerk-derived version of Soul Makossa. Plus there's the blank-eyed
electro-rap of Whip It by the Treacherous Three; Reggie Griffin and
Technofunk's bleepy Mirda Rock, and last but not least electro's crowning
glory: Nunk by Warp 9. What do you mean, you missed it back in 1982? Make up
for lost time. It's never too late to realise that everybody gotta nunk to the
new-wave funk.
Oh Brother Where Art Thou?, the Legendary Jim Ruiz Group (Minty Fresh)
q Who is Jim Ruiz, and why are he and his group legendary? Jim Ruiz is plainly
the wee nephew of Jonathan Richman, while his band have listened long and hard
to Astrud Gilberto and the Swingle Singers. And to tell you the truth, guv,
neither Jim nor his band are yet legendary, but if you buy this album - as you
must - they will reign in your heart forever.
``Who will drive my Yugo when I die?'' is one of the many poignant (yet
practical) questions Jim asks, before going on to allude to the automotive
tragedy which befell showbiz folk who opted for flashier means of getting
around. Aye, whaur's your Porsche noo, James Dean? Alas, Marc Bolan: you should
never have bought that swanky Mini 1275GT.
If you heed my words and invest in this album, you will actually never need a
car: you will be content to stay at home, jitterbugging in a frantic (yet
ironic) fashion with Jim Ruiz and Co, legends in your living room.

RANGERS midfielder Alexei Mikhailichenko will discuss his future with
Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mark McGhee next week before any financial deal
is settled by the clubs.
The move, worth about #500,000, now depends on the former Soviet Union World
Cup man who has been at Ibrox since 1991, when he was Walter Smith's second
signing after taking over as manager (Andy Goram was the first).
Mikhailichenko, who cost #2m then, could not have played in the English club's
festive games as the deadline for the transfer had passed and so there is no
rush to get a move sealed.
However, the Ukrainian has been happy in Glasgow, even if he has not been able
to maintain a weekly place in the top team and McGhee might need to be
particularly persuasive to get him to move south.
In the meantime, he will be part of the pool from which Smith will choose his
teams for the crucial period coming up, when Rangers, champions and league
leaders, take on Kilmarnock at home on Boxing Day, then Hibs at Ibrox next
Saturday, and last, but certainly not least, Celtic at Parkhead on January 3.
Smith will be without Ally McCoist and Stuart McCall for the first of those
games, but Alex Cleland and Gary Bollan could be fit to take part. Definitely
back in action will be Paul Gascoigne and Oleg Salenko, both free to play again
after suspension.
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten had hoped to use two players in reserve games
this week to prepare them for a return against Rangers, but the weather forced
both matches off and he now has to consider whether Ray Montgomerie and Tom
Black should go straight into the side. Montgomerie has been out for 12 weeks
after breaking his nose while Black has missed the last two games after
suffering from tonsillitis.
The manager points out that his team, which has been in good form at home, can
collect some reward from their away match. The fact that Killie have scored
five goals more than they managed at this time last season explains why they
have recently climbed up from last place to fourth bottom spot.
For Totten and the three managers below him, Murdo MacLeod of Partick Thistle,
Alex McLeish of Motherwell, and John Lambie of Falkirk, the festive period
could be vital in their bids to outdo each other in the race to escape
relegation. Each has a tough set of fixtures to tackle.
Kilmarnock, for example, take on Rangers at Ibrox, then Aberdeen at home, and
Motherwell at Fir Park, every one a demanding task. Thistle will find it no
easier with their programme reading as follows: Hibs (h), Raith Rovers (a), and
Falkirk (h).
Nor will it be a comfortable time for bottom club Falkirk, who face up to
Aberdeen at Brockville on Tuesday, Motherwell at Fir Park, and then Thistle at
Firhill.
They will have a new man on their side, however, after manager John Lambie
yesterday signed an Englishman of many clubs, Andy Gray. The former Crystal
Palace, Aston Villa, QPR and Tottenham player negotiated his own transfer from
Spanish team Atletico Marbella.
Gray, 31, began at Crystal Palace before moving to Villa for #150,000. After 15
months in the Midlands he switched back to London when Queen's Park Rangers
paid #475,000 for him, but after that he returned to Palace for #500,000 before
Spurs bought him for #900,000.
Motherwell, the fourth member of the quartet near the bottom, must take on
Hearts at Tynecastle, then Falkirk at Brockville, and Kilmarnock at home, but
after their draw with Rangers on Tuesday they will tackle the job with a will.
They hope to have Dougie Arnott fit after a virus and will make a late decision
on Brian Martin, who has had a hamstring injury.
Celtic have no injury worries for their visit to Kirkcaldy to meet the
dangerous Raith Rovers, but the really good news for their fans is that Brian
O'Neil, the brilliant young defender who has not played for seven months
because of knee ligament damage, could return in a closed doors game against
Dumbarton, if conditions permit, today.

Writer and playwright Marcella Evaristi, in a story      specially created for
Weekend Extra, presents
a seasonal remembrance of saints, separations,
and aquamarine eyes
CHRISTMAS comes but once a year, and once a year, my birthday disappears:
dissolves like a snowflake, melts like brandy butter down the side of the
seasonal pudding, dribbles away and down like the candles on that cake: ``Many
Happy Returns, Jesus. You are Zero Today.'' Where my cake should have been.
My birthday disappears on the twenty-fifth of December, imploding inside
itself, like a self-obliterating cracker, like a kamikaze space in the calendar
- I know one simile would have done, you probably got the idea at
``disappears'', but I'm waiting for someone, so to pass the time I'm spreading
this out, as the high days and holidays of my year are not.
Besides I am addressing this to myself, the ``you'' that is you is rhetorical,
I am addressing this to myself as I used to address birthday cards to myself,
and balance them in front of the competition on the mantelpiece. Being without
existence, like my birthday, you are not free to patronise my self-pity; so
listen, nobodies at my non-party, and consider. (You won't have to for long, he
is rarely late, not without phoning, and after all it is my . . . Christmas.)
This is the line I got as a kid from Sister Imelda - ``Deirdra, darling, you
are a very lucky little girl. Other children can look up which Saints Day
coincides with their own birthday. Find themselves attached to St Jude, for
hopeless cases maybe; or St Anthony who helps with lost things, and that's very
nice, very nice indeed, but nothing compared to your luck, for you are honoured
to share a birthday with the Baby Jesus Himself. All of God's children get a
visit from Santa, but you get an extra present, more precious than any bicycle
or doll, and that's a special blessing from He who invites the whole human race
to the holy celebration of his birth.''
So when I opened the Christmas day flap on my Advent calendar, I fully expected
to see my own incredibly blessed face beaming out at me. But it was always a
crib. I couldn't figure out how come if He shared my birthday, He never got any
older, whilst year on year I aged visibly, invisibly. And how could I compete
with someone who's already invited the entire population to His party?
``Dear Deirdra, Birthday Greetings! I will be able to attend, crossed-out, I am
very sorry I cannot attend, underlined, your party on the twenty-fifth. Love
and kisses, Alice.''
``Oh please come to my party, it's going to be great - Alice? - ah, please
pals! - I'm going to have musical chairs, and butterfly cakes and pin the tail
on the donkey and Mr Bonzo, a real live circus clown is going to do tricks.''
``Sounds fun, but round at the Son of God's we're getting to walk on the
Liffey, the Tizer's going to turn into wine, Dominic McLafferty is going to get
his squint fixed, and there's a Mr Chaplin booked for the cabaret.''
``Well, I hope when you look inside the party bags you'll find an Immaculate
Medal and plenary indulgence to suck on!'' Imelda must be the patron saint of
atheism.
Mummy did her best. One year she tried giving me a party the week before; we
all went to the panto we were booked to go to anyway, and all my birthday
presents were wrapped in Christmas paper with the sleighbells felt-tipped out.
But it was better than the year I got my party the week after.
In the days before recycling, I was the recipient of four boxes of bath cubes,
those chalky little blocks you never see now, distant festive relatives of the
Brillo Pad family they must be, the kind that scoured your bottom in the bath
if you sat on them.
I also got a hanky with the initial ``F'' embroidered on it - `` `F' for
`Deirdra','' I said. ``Thanks for the personalised present. Fatima. It's
dabulous.'' ``It's an `F' for Friendship handkerchief,'' said Fatima Maguire,
fibbing through her brace.
Given my mood I quite liked the rat-a-tat machine gun I got from Steven whose
Daddy was nice, English, nervous, and active in CND. The worst was a pale
green, luminous, 15-inch high statue of Our Lady, who up until then I always
believed was more inclined to favour pastel blue cloaks, white shifts, and
snake-entwined sandals. Must have been Our Lady of the Celtic. Had me roaring
and screaming, anyway, when its creepy jade glow pitched itself into my dreams
and Mummy had to come and take it away in the middle of the night, and after
that we reverted to . . . - I though that was him at the door there. But it was
just some carol singers. He's still not what you'd call late. Travelling on
Christmas Day is always a nightmare.
When I reached my teens I went from being sad to being mad about the situation.
I adapted carols for myself, and sang them as loud protest songs at midnight
mass. ``Come All Ye Fortgetful'' I bellowed, feeling betrayed by the faithful.
And twisting the Latin as my fate had twisted me, I decibelled to the tune of
Adeste Fidelis, ``At-test te yir fail-yirs -.'' Lord, how devastatingly
sardonic I thought my strained unheard revisions, which were still too subtle
to resist the deluge of sentimental Christmas bonhomie that swirled around me,
insultingly all-inclusive, and quite promiscuously unspecific.
Like all young girls I decided I had been born in the wrong place, to the wrong
parents, and, most importantly, at the wrong historical moment. BC - that was
the time I should have been conceived in. Among the ancient Egyptians I could
have reappropriated my birthday. On the twenty-fifth of whatever they called
December, the ancient Pharaohs could have decked my young pre-Christian body
with golden links ornate with rubies, rubbed heady unguents into my midnight
blue-black hair, and given me 15 of the dumps beside the pyramids. And capital
F-you, Fatima, as yet unborn. Stuff your hanky.
Once I waited till the family had sat down to Christmas lunch before my
entrance, dressed as Cleopatra. This was when I was still in my AD denial
phase. I'd used up to half a bottle of black eyeliner, and made this dinky
crown affair with a little snake curved above my fringe. It's amazing how
inventive one can be with a whole packet of fuse wire, (although later, after
the fairy lights had blown, I stayed silent as a Stoic, repressing my
Catholic-conditioned instinct to confess). It just shows how little notice you
take of me, I thought, shaking my fuse-wired head, whilst everybody searched.
It's getting dark now, I will light the candles and suppress all thoughts of
accidents, black ice, and the contingency of brakes.
``More cranberry sauce, Cleo?'' said Daddy, cosmically missing the point. Then
they all started to discuss Elizabeth Taylor's diamonds, Richard Burton's
boozing, his poor abandoned wife, Cybil, the ruined childhood of his daughter,
Kate, the racial characteristics of the Welsh compared to the Irish, National
Velvet, and the visit I might have to make to Dr Sweeney if I couldn't prise
out the costume jewel I had pasted to my belly button.
Eight o'clock. I won't have a second port. I don't want to be out of synch with
him, when he arrives. There's nothing worse than having some mini-disaster,
some deeply frustrating, but not fatal, contretemps completely cocking up your
day, then coming home to find your should-be confidante is so far gone ahead of
you, that your intended anecdote evaporates before you've raised your glass.
There is one thing going for us No-Birthday No-els - Now, that's reminded me of
yet another injury inflicted on my lot. The names. I got off quite lightly,
thank God, with ``Deirdra'', but pity the Hollys and the Rudolphs. Robin is
borderline and Natalie is OK, but I swear I know a Bethlehem. Jeez, I'd rather
be called July.      Or Sunburn.
My theory is that his mother, whilst consciously thinking she was calling her
beautiful wee Christmas baby something cute and apposite, was actually wreaking
her subconscious revenge for being in labour, screaming for oxygen, panting her
way through the Queen's speech, episiotimised like a turkey under poultry
shears, while her spouse, poised to be a proud father, raised endless glasses
in celebration of a Virgin Birth.
But maybe not. This waiting is making me nervous and more cynical-sounding than
I really feel. Perhaps it's the coffee.
The one thing going for us, as I was about to say, before I sidetracked myself,
my ghostly birthday party guests - I can see you all cavorting,
semi-transparent, with dusty paper hats and blowing on those tooters that,
crinkling, turn and curl upon themselves like paper scorpions - the solitary
advantage is that, if you're heading for a melancholic Christmas, the wallow is
satisfyingly squared. If you're feeling masochistic, you get a double de
profundis.
But it seems such a long time since I felt that way. I've been looking through
my photograph albums to pass the time. Strange expression that, ``to pass the
time'', as if alternatively, you could cross the street to avoid the time, or
dodge into an alleyway so time passed you, and left you where you were.
There's me and Steven on the march he invited me out to. I used to fancy him
like mad: my first kiss from him coincided with my New Statesman being
confiscated in class. He told me he was proud of me and that I reminded him of
Nathalie Wood. My twenty-first birthday party, Boxing Day, nineteen eighty one.
Also my engagement party. Alice's pretty face, a picture of appalled affection.
Daddy's making his speech there. ``I'd like you all to know it was Deirdra who
insisted on the two celebrations being on the one day. After all these bloody
years of griping at us! So be warned, Christopher.'' But there he is dancing,
his arms wide open, the alarm bells drowned out by the band.
The phone is ringing from the hall now. But to get there, I have to run through
a marriage-long catalogue of calls like this, however fast I am, no matter how
quickly my body moves. (If there's a hell after death, mine would include a
house where the chime of the doorbell and the sound of the telephone were
indistinguishable. Who's there? Who's not coming?)
At first, I am running to a pay-phone down a fusty corridor in a guest-house
called the Buena Vista in Tufnell Park, London.
The fact that the call is for me is a slightly grudging disappointment to some
of the other Vistans, who open their doors and peer theatrically round in my
direction, and although their faces are like stop-watches already clocking the
length of my conversation, they are not hostile. Most of them are theatricals,
in fact, and programmed to waiting for things. Three are currently playing
Wombles in a Christmas show, and in the evenings I can hear them singing round
the piano in the front room, which they have effortlessly appropriated.
``I went to a wonderful party . . . '' they stress, as if a Noel Coward song
could turn sweet sherry into whisky sours and effect a transformation scene
where the Womble world of Wimbledon Common quick-changed forever into Drury
Lane.
The Vistans do not have too long to wait. It
makes more sense for me to come back home to Ireland in a week or two, instead
of him arriving here, I made the digs so dreary sounding, so hilariously dire,
but of course it's hardly that just. He saw the swans at Bantry Bay at dusk, I
would have wept, I would. He's just half-finished a letter to me, quite
ridiculously long. Now he's running short of change. And sorry this last-minute
change of plan is painful, but there was work and working out to do, he
realised, but honestly our love's a feast that's moveable. So let's not get
ourselves too short-term sad, and all hung up on dates.
Kiss you all over, he said softly, hanging up. So Merry Birthday, I thought,
sipping on a Womble sherry. Happy Christmas Next.
And next I'm racing across our mortgaged kitchen floor five years ago, and it's
not the doorbell that's ringing. I know what's coming. Then I'm giving it -
``Yes.'' Briskly.
``Yes, but it's nine now. Fine. I know these things happen, but why wait till
nine, when you said you'd be back, to tell me 10.30, when you definitely will
be back, yes, but you must have known before now, before nine, I wouldn't mind
- I just don't see why.
``Listen, if this crisis has just happened this minute, how come you weren't on
your way home already? If you'd been on your way home already, you'd only have
been half an hour late, hardly late enough to even bother phoning to say, and
that way the crisis would have been forced, amazingly enough, to solve itself
without you.'' (I wonder who that was? I recognised his voice, but not the
harridan, not hers.) We eat at 10.45. The meal is hardly ruined, perfect
really, apart from a charred crust, but I removed that, sauced it over, as you
can do, up to a certain stage.
At 12 when I am technically my new age he opens the champagne, and sitting by
the fire I pose for the automatic camera which stands by the cards and the
candlesticks on the mantelpiece. He sets it up, a little light goes on and he
dashes to my side, his arm around me just in time, and then we smile. Flash,
and we're caught together. Perhaps we won't need a third party anymore, now we
have technology.
I reach the phone now, and simultaneously the buzzer sounds and I try to answer
everything, but the ghosts of all my ghost-birthdays populate the hall and
holding hands surround me in a ring.
There's Steven in the corner firing a starter's gun to start the singing -
``For she's a jolly good fellow, for she's a holly good fellow, for she's a
jolly dude fe-e-stive, and so pray all for us . . .''
So strange, without the volume fading on the chant it's quite enough to ask him
how he is. ``Greenpeace. One child, separated, trying. Me, I mean, not the
child. The child's fab.''
Fatima is big as a whale and grinning. ``Writer. Required to do a story about
guilt for a creative writing class at Queen's. Started with that hanky. Never
stopped. Been looking back ever since. Ducking morning sickness still. And due
today.'' ``Ah, a Christmas day baby, how divine.''
Alice is not as pale as the others. ``Overdose. July, 1976. Optimism too
painful.'' The reveller with the camera lowers it from his face. ``Overworking
still. Remarried from you. But you know that anyway because I keep in touch.
Odd times. That was me on the phone just now. Smile, gentles, smile.''
If you're telling me the truth, and you didn't start without me - for which I
would not have blamed you - could you then tell me, please, why you are
kneeling on the floor smiling at the umbrella stand? he asked me, when he
finally despaired of me opening the door, dropped his luggage and parcels and
fished out his own keys.
I can tell how cold his face is, but not because of the usual signs. He has
barometer eyes, and it's a very rare condition, though that's not the official
name. One in a million his doctor told him a long time ago. His eyes change
colour when he loses body heat. It's just me that calls him barometer eyes, and
of course no-one believes me, unless they meet him. If love is blind, then why
not colour-blind? they think.
It was snowing that first time I saw him and my heart sank. Heavens, was he not
beautiful, but thank God, there's salvation - would you look at the fakey
coloured contact lenses, almost neon beneath the black lashes? Naff flash
bastard, I'm as safe as igloos. Then he began to explain, and the melting
started.
``That's fascinating,'' I laughed. ``Do they turn pink when you're warm? I had
a wee statuette of a poodle like that my auntie brought back from Rimini or
somewhere.''
Shut up, sweet Jesus, shut up, Deirdra. Oh Fellow Birthday Boy, could you not
arrange an avalache for me? (And didn't he just.)
His normal eyes are blue, not light - but the blue when he's cold, becomes
stronger. Like dark aquamarine, but bright-bluer than that sounds, startling.
No, I haven't found the words yet. I live on the cusp of description when I
think of him, and when I look at him I always have to start again. Be tempting
the gods, to     say God's gift of found gold, frankinsence and more. Parcels
left till morning, no guessing . . . getting warm.

ONE Man attempts to bridge a 26-year gap and deliver King George VI Chase
success for his trainer Gordon Richards at Kempton on Boxing Day.
In the shadow of Desert Orchid, four-times winner of the prize, the new white
hope faces the most important race of his career so far in the first big test
of his Cheltenham Gold Cup credentials.
A triumph in the Tommy Whittle Chase at Haydock, where his athletic jumping
bore comparison with Desert Orchid, brought consolation for having to miss the
Hennessy Gold Cup.
But 10 of the fiercest rivals he has met will bid to ensure there is no One Man
show for new jockey Richard Dunwoody and no repeat for Richards of Titus Oates'
1969 victory.
Richards has his chaser in perfect shape for the task, the one question mark in
connections' minds being the likely state of the going at Kempton, where One
Man suffered a fall in February when the ground was heavy.
Four days before the big race owner John Hales can't wait to get the race over.
``I'm a bag of nerves,'' he said. ``I just hope the weather is kind to us. If
it's soft he should be okay but if it got heavy then we'd have to think about
whether to run.''

DUTCH international winger Marc Overmars will not be facing Scotland in next
summer's European Championship finals in England. The Dutchman has been ruled
out by torn ligaments in his left knee.
The Ajax player was injured in a league match on Wednesday and the problem was
found to be worse than feared during an exploratory operation at Amsterdam's VU
hospital.
EVERTON have been told they must release Nigerian striker Daniel Amokachi for
next month's African Cup of Nations tournament.
The Merseyside club, startled to learn Amokachi could miss as many as 10 club
games, called in the FA after experiencing problems contacting Nigeria for
clarification of the situation. They established that FIFA rules stipulate
players must be released 14 days before the tournament, which begins in South
Africa on January 13.
Nigeria play their first match 24 hours later against Zaire in Durban so
Amokachi could miss the third and fourth rounds of the FA Cup as well as
important Premiership fixtures against Arsenal and Chelsea.
Wimbledon face a similar dilemma with Efan Ekoku, who is also in the Nigerian
squad. Leeds trio Tony Yeboah, Phil Masinga and Lucas Radebe also will be
involved, along with Nii Lamptey of Coventry.
PARTICK Thistle and Raith Rovers have each been fined #100 by the Scottish
League for fielding ineligible players in reserve matches. One of the players
was involved with both the clubs.
Partick included Billy McDonald and Paddy Atkinson, who was looking for a club,
without the required clearance. And Raith also included Atkinson when he did
not have the necessary clearance.
STRANRAER striker Billy Ferguson has joined Hong Kong club Happy Valley for a
small fee.
Ice hockey
FIFE Flyers jumped into seventh spot in the Premier Division with back-to-back
wins over fellow strugglers Slough Jets and Milton Keynes last weekend and now
player-coach Mark Morrison hopes to make it a treble when they meet league
anchormen Newcastle Warriors tonight.
In the first division, third-placed Dumfries Vikings face big-spending
Manchester Storm, who sit one place above them on the table, while Paisley
Pirates are minus net-minder Dave Rook, who is on a two-game ban, for their
weekend double-header with Swindon.
MILTON Keynes Kings have won the race to sign 30-year-old Canadian defenceman
Scott Young, who was released by Humberside at his own request last week.
Golf
MIKE Thomson (Torwoodlee) and Craig Watson (East Renfrewshire) will represent
Scotland in the Lake MacQuarrie Open in Australia next month. The duo,
respectively winner and runner-up in the 1995 Claremont Scottish Mid-Amateur
championship, will play at the Belmont International course in New South Wales
from January 26 to 28.
Scottish amateur champion Simon Mackenzie (West Linton) had hoped to attend,
but work committments prevented him making the trip Down Under.
Basketball
INVERNESS will stage the Home Countries junior men's championship next April 12
to 14. The event, the first British and Irish Federation championship to come
to the north, will take place at Inverness Sports Centre.
The SBA are still looking for a coach to take charge of the Scotland team. The
senior women's Home Countries event goes to Spelthorne, near London, while the
junior women travel to Ireland.
Boxing
THAILAND'S Samson Gym successfully defended his WBF junior bantamweight title
with a ninth-round technical knock-out of Thembinkosi Ntyinkala, of South
Africa, in Sakhon Nakhon.
NIGEL Benn's tragic world title fight with American Gerald McClellan won the
1995 battle of the sports television ratings. ITV, who screened seven of the
top-10 sports programmes this year, had 13.1m viewers tuning in to the WBC
super-middleweight contest in February. That was over a million viewers more

Hollywood 95/Royal SNO (Varese Sarabande)
q NEW venture for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. Recorded in Glasgow's
City Hall in mid-September, with the orchestra under the direction of Hollywood
composer Joel McNeely, this is a vivid, full-blooded set of contemporary scores
for Hollywood films.
And I mean contemporary - bang up to date, with soundtracks from Batman
Forever, Apollo 13, Judge Dredd, Caspar, First Knight, Waterworld, and the
evocative end-title sequence from Braveheart. The single exception is the theme
music to Alexander Korda's 1940 film, That Hamilton Woman, written by Miklos
Rozsa, who died this year, and recorded here as a tribute to one of the most
prolific of film music composers.

DRUMLANRIG, December 23 - The Jacobite army is back in Scotland, and still
marching rapidly northwards in an effort to rendezvous with reinforcements.
Three days ago, which was also Prince Charles Edward Stuart's birthday, the
clansmen held a wild celebration after they crossed the border at Longtown on
the River Esk. The river, in flood as a result of heavy rain, would have been
impassable for a conventional army. But several hundred Highlanders plunged in
and formed a human barrier against the torrent, allowing the rest of their
columns to pass over.
The scenes of joy then took place on the Scottish bank of the Esk. Bonfires
were lit, the pipers began to play and the soldiers danced Highland reels till
they were dry. One officer said: ``We have carried the standard of Glenfinnan
150 miles into a country full of foes, and now we have brought it back
unscathed, through the accumulated dangers of storm and war.''
The next day the Jacobites captured Dumfries, a strongly Presbyterian and
therefore hostile town which had already raised a company of volunteers to
fight them. In the event, there was no violence apart from the clansmen's
plundering. But Charles laid a tax of #2000 on the citizens and demanded 200
pairs               of shoes besides, since many of his troops         are
barefoot.
The Highlanders then marched up the valley of the Nith. They are tonight
bivouacked at Drumlanrig Castle, seat of the absent Duke of Queensberry. They
are wrecking it. While they drank up the wine and spirits from the cellar, they
slaughtered 40 sheep inside the house rather than in the cold outside. After
their meal, they laid straw in all the fine rooms, and entertained themselves
before going to sleep by defacing portraits with their swords, especially one
of King Billy.
It is obvious how glad they feel to be at home after their hardships in
England, which their chieftains never wanted to invade anyway. They can also
expect an improvement in their military situation. During their absence,
recruiting drives for Prince Charles have gone on in Perthshire and
Aberdeenshire, while a French force of 800 under Lord John Drummond has landed
at Montrose. The Jacobites may be able to boost their present strength of about
4000 men by another 2000. From the headwaters of the Nith, the prince intends
to cross to the valley of the Clyde and descend again into the Lowlands.
There is little immediate prospect of the Government's forces which followed
him from Derby continuing their pursuit. In the end the two sides fought only a
skirmish on English soil, but the Jacobites came off better.
Their general, Lord George Murray, conducted the rearguard, the regiments of
Glengarry and of Colonel Roy Stewart with the artillery and heavy equipment,
over the Cumbrian hills. Hindered by the local militia, they were in danger of
being caught up by units of cavalry sent ahead on the orders of the royal
commander, the Duke of Cumberland.
Murray had to put a stop to the harassment, and on December 18 he arranged an
ambush. From Clifton, near Penrith, he sent the baggage forward to join the
main Jacobite column. The Glengarry men scattered some nervous patrols of
militia, and ran down others at Lowther Hall nearby, the home of Lord Lowther,
Lord-Lieutenant of Cumberland. When prisoners reported that Cumberland was
approaching with a force of 4000, Murray sent to Prince Charles for
reinforcements to attack the English army before it could have time to deploy
properly.
This request was actually refused because the prince thought the rearguard had
only militia to confront. It says a lot about the state of Jacobite discipline
that two regiments, of Cluny Macphersons and Appin Stewarts, came back of their
own accord to help Murray, who was then able to arrange his ambush anyway.
They arrived an hour after sunset to find him under fire from 500 enemy
dragoons round the village of Clifton. In the gathering dusk, the fresh
Highland troops crept close under the cover of hedges and stone dikes. At the
shout of Claymore, they cut their way through the thickets, let off a volley
and fell on the English cavalrymen. More than 40 dragoons were killed or
wounded, and the rest forced back. In the darkness, the four Jacobite regiments
reformed and hurried on to Penrith. Despite his superiority in numbers,
Cumberland chose not to pursue them.
The next day, December 19, the Jacobites regained Carlisle, which they left on
the first stage of their invasion less than a month ago. Here Prince Charles
took a controversial decision to garrison the city while the rest of his army
marched on. Lord George Murray opposed him on the grounds that this would mean
a useless sacrifice of men. It would be better to blow up the castle and walls
of Carlisle, which were anyway in too poor a state of repair to be defended.
But the prince expects to return this way once he is reinforced. If his own
troops hold a strongpoint on the Border, it will be easier for him to enter
England again. He called for volunteers, and 400 came forward, including his
only English regiment, raised in Manchester under Colonel Francis Townley.
Cumberland has now laid siege to Carlisle. As he has called up heavy cannon,
which are being brought by sea to Whitehaven, the Jacobite garrison is unlikely
to hold out long. But for the time being, it has halted the pursuit of Prince
Charles.

has 5000 members
n ``At this time of year, pagans look forward the rebirth of the sun which we
celebrate on December 21/22 with a little ritual symbolising light coming into
darkness. Contrary to what some people think, the festivities don't include a
mass orgy. Officially we don't recognise Christmas Day but my partner's father
usually joins us then and we make a special meat meal for him and our two cats
who, unlike Charis and me, aren't vegetarian. Decorating a living tree is very
much in keeping with the pagan ethos of love and respect for nature.''

accounts of the rebellion, sees the gladness

soil, and the results of their exuberance

THE SFA yesterday pulled the plug on their Travel Club ticket hotline after
fielding thousands of calls from the Tartan Army.
A week ago the memberships of the SFA Travel Club stood at 5500 - ahead of
Sunday's Euro '96 draw, which matched Scotland with England, Holland, and
Switzerland.
Now officials are processing applications which will take the membership to
between 10,000 and 11,000.
``We are closing the hotline as we don't want to mislead fans who think by
joining the Travel Club now they will get tickets for Euro '96,'' said SFA
spokesman David Findlay.
``The response has been incredible and we will revert to written applications,
but fans should realise they won't necessarily get European Championship
tickets.''
If Scotland receive more than the 7000 tickets guaranteed for each visiting
nation, they will go to Travel Club members who have had their applications
date and time-stamped this week.
Meanwhile, Scotland manager Craig Brown's preparations for Euro '96 will not
stop over Christmas. He will take in a game in England today and the
Leeds-Manchester United match tomorrow, as well as another fixture on Boxing
Day.

MYTHS: Master Acheson, you are one of a number of traders in the burgh who have
already declared they will pay no heed to the king's command that Christmas Day
should be observed throughout the land this year as a holy day. The market, if
you don't mind me saying so, is going like a fair today. Will you be at your
stall as usual tomorrow?
ACHESON: Hold on a second boss, duty calls. Yes missus, goose eggs - fresh this
morning. Half a dozen. Sure thing. There ye go, love. Goat's cheese? Should be
in from Dunlop this afternoon. Aye you were saying - this nonsense about
shutting up shop for Christmas Day - crazy. Do you know that Christmas, or any
other holy day, doesn't rate a mention in the scriptures? Honest. Huv a swatch
yersel.
MYTHS: But King James is said to be of the opinion that Scotland is losing
track of the real meaning of Christmas, seeing it merely as a commercial
opportunity rather than an important religious celebration.
ACHESON: Two points worth making there, son. Hell, where's ma cheeses. Where
did that wee wumman disappear tae? Aye, two points. Firstly, the kirk decided
long since that Christmas was a beggarly festival and should be abolished along
wi' popery. Now the king is trying to help us back doon the road tae Rome and
basically, we'll no' wear it. It's a' politics.
MYTHS: But on the point of the commerciality of this time of year. If you don't
mind me saying so, it seems you're trying to get the best of both worlds . . .
having your Christmas cake and eating it. On one hand you want to make a
killing from the event while refusing to celebrate it in what the king sees as
an appropriate manner.
ACHESON: Finnan haddies, straight oot the smokehoose! If you don't mind me
saying so, son, that's crap. Look at last year. The king ordered Christmas
observance in Edinburgh and whit happens? I'll tell you, in fact, better, I'll
show you. Here's a clipping fae the evening paper. See, there you are, ``the
Great Kirk was not half filled and dogs played around the floor,'' and that
bampot Patrick Galloway denounced non-attenders saying that lameness, deafness,
and blindness should fall upon them. It's him that's lame-brained. Every
luckenbooth was open. The truth is the Scots want Christmas as a normal working
day.
MYTHS: Then can you predict what is likely to happen tomorrow in Ayr?
ACHESON: Well, like almost every burgh, at least here in the west, it'll be
``business as usual''. I don't know a stallholder who'll be away from their
stance. This past half-century it's been our busiest day of the year and there
is no chance of us backing away from our responsibilities to the public -
bananas missus, no, you'll huv to come back next century - aye, I wis saying,
you'll notice that King Jamie has refused a referendum on this 'cause he knows
fine well that his hin' end would be oot the windae, if it cam' to a vote.
MYTHS: So you'd be prepared to answer to his majesty's commissioners?
ACHESON: Let's put it this way, wee man. They'll need a helluva big dock to try
20,000 traders. But maybe they're thinking of hiring Murrayfield. It's as
simple as this - we've a living to earn whether it's selling goose eggs, wally
dugs, black puddings, or lottery tickets. Actually I'd like to see Christmas
expand. It may sound a bittie radical but we could start our promotions a full
week before Christmas, couldn't we? Anyway, there's a queue building up here.
You'll have to forgive me. A merry Christmas to you.
Jim Hewitson reveals that the Christmas break was not always
universally acclaimed

temporary accommodation is gradually becoming a way of life
JACK'S not scared of strangers. Not when they come into the house that he
thinks is home and sit themselves down in the bare lounge under the limp
strands of Christmas bunting. He's up at your knee instantly, patting,
proferring toys, strangely calm with unknown company.
It's not surprising that new faces hold such little allure; he's seen maybe a
dozen come and go during the past year, strangers moving in then moving out. At
the moment it's Danny and Claire and their five children, and Danny smiles
easily and is willing to play; but in a couple of months it might be someone
else, someone a little less friendly.
Across the room, Sherry and Dave watch their 15-month-old son with anxious,
eyes, calming restless hands with a succession of cigarettes. They know this
halfway hostel will be home for another 14 to 18 months and they've been
homeless for a year and a half already. Three whole years in limbo. A life on
hold for a home of their own.
They're both 22; Dave, thin and gentle with a deep stretch of lines across his
frequently furrowed brow. Sherry is gray-pale with deep dark smudges under each
eye and shoulders weighted low with worry. She's just been diagnosed with a
heart murmur, caused, she says, by the stress of their situation and she's been
on medication for as long as she can remember. Throughout the interview they
both perch on the edges of a chair, never settling back, never relaxing.
This was not how they envisaged their life together when they met in the April
of 1993. Dave was in his late teens and had moved down to Devon to look for
work, booking himself into the bed and breakfast run by Sherry's mum.
They moved back to Scotland the following December when Sherry was pregnant
with Jack and she gave birth to him in September while they were staying with
Dave's mum in East Kilbride.
They had first put their names down for a house when they moved up in December
1993, but by January of 1995, life was becoming a little too crowded and they
moved into the homeless unit in Greenhills.
Shortly afterwards, Sherry was hit by a bad attack of post-natal depression
and, unable to cope, took the family down to Devon to stay with her mum. When
they returned some four months later, they assumed they would still be in the
same situation for getting a house, but say they were informed that because
they had been away for so long, they were almost back to square one in their
search for a home and were facing a wait of between 14 months and 18 months.
The policy had apparently been introduced in 1991 and neither Sherry nor Dave
were aware            of it.
``We went from 88 on the list to 219 and now we're at 131,'' says Sherry. ``It
was devastating, just devastating, it just felt as though you were falling
apart, the thought that we were going to have to stay here for another 14
months or so, the thought that Jack will be brought up here. He's never had a
stable home since he's been born. It's unhealthy. He's in the same room as us,
he should have his own room. He's going to be totally clingy towards us. He's
not going to be independent enough. It's more distressing for the kids.
Different people all the time. They get used to someone then they go and
someone else moves in.''
From the outside the homeless unit is only distinguishable from the other
buildings in the quiet cul-de-sac by the extra layer of peeling paint around
the door and the total absence of anything that might mark it as a real home.
No name on the door, no doorbell, no well-chosen curtains at the window, no
tended garden.
Inside, the communal lounge has the stagnant air of a waiting room, sparse with
its sofa, two chairs, and a cardboard box of toys in the corner. There's
muffled noise everywhere, the wail of a child, a faint-mumbled conversation in
another room, dunts and bumps on floors and ceilings.
Dave is apologetic about the thin strings of glossy paper hanging from the
sitting room ceiling and the plastic Santa face stuck to the wall. ``You've got
to do something for Christmas, don't you, got to make a bit of an effort,'' he
says when he catches you looking at it.
But deep down he's quite glad that Jack is probably too young to pick up on the
idea of Christmas Day. ``We'll be at my Mum's on the day but in the back of
your mind is the thought that it's not your house and you can't really
celebrate. You've got to be back in the unit at a certain time, before 11pm or
12am. If you stay out overnight, you've got to tell them you won't be back that
night.
``In a way I'm glad Jack's not really old enough to know about Christmas. I
wouldn't like him to remember this. I don't think kids should be brought up in
this situation.''
Two of Danny and Claire's offspring have been drawn to the interview in the
lounge; a tiny child in a green romper suit, nappy hanging low out of the gap
at the back; and Robin, a sturdy child of five or six. His wellies have the
face of a frog raised on the front of each foot and he's demanding to know
where Stephen is. ``Where is he? Is Stephen here?''
Like Jack, he doesn't appear even remotely curious about these new incomers to
the house. ``Stephen was one of the kids who used to live here,'' says Danny.
``It's difficult for the kids to get used to. Jack will probably be the same
when we go. He'll want to know where Robin is. They don't understand where
they've gone''.
Jack hasn't settled, wandering from one person to the next, trying to elicit a
game or a reaction from them in turn. Sherry worries that he's already
developing hang-ups nurtured by the general uncertainty of his life and his
parents' deep sense of unease.
``He has tantrums a lot. If you tell him off he will sit there and scream at
you. Now he's starting to change. We can see it in him. He's not got any
routine whatsoever. He's in the room with us, we're lucky if he goes to sleep
at 11pm. I think he does have a lot of stress.''
She takes us up to the one room they can call their own. There's a smallish bed
for the three of them and some furniture for their belongings. A couple of
Christmas cards have been stuck on top of the wardrobe, but there's no sign of
the familiar clutter that collects around families. ``It's so difficult,'' she
says. ``Each day, we get up and that's it really, you feel so down all the
time. We feel as though we've just been forgotten. Stuck away in a homeless
unit and that's us.''
They may feel isolated, but they're not alone. Over the past years the use of
temporary accommodation has more than doubled in Scotland, from 2123 households
in 1990 to about 5000 in 1995. The homeless charity Shelter which is conducting
research into the issue say there is well over a million bed nights spent in
temporary accommodation in Scotland in any given year.
``The temporary accommodation use mirrors the increase in homelessness,'' said
Gavin Corbett, Shelter research officer. ``At the same time as homelessness has
increased there are more and more council houses sold.''
Corbett said he can understand why those in temporary accommodation feel, like
Dave and Sherry, that they are a forgotten breed.
``We would like to see local authorities strive where possible to avoid the use
of temporary accommodation by providing homeless people with secure
accommodation as quickly as possible. But if they have to use it to avoid
certain types, like bed and breakfast, and to keep in mind the ongoing needs of
people, not simply to allocate temporary accommodation and then leave them for
a year. To frequently review it and to talk to people rather than just
depositing them in temporary accommodation. Not all authorities are very good
at that yet.''
Back at Greenhills, Sherry is pointing out the grimy upstairs bathroom that
serves all 10 of them with a separate toilet downstairs. There's also one more
room in the house they can't use. It's known as the emergency room and it needs
to be empty for those last-minute, sheer desperation cases. It's a house, but
it's not a home and Dave, in particular, seems to find it well nigh impossible
to settle here. He doesn't sit still for longer than a few minutes at a time.
``I don't like to stay here during the day,'' he says, rising yet again from
his perch on the edge of the chair, one eye on Jack. ``So we go out, out for a
walk to get away. But it makes it harder this time of year when you walk by
everyone else's houses and they've got the decorations out and the presents out
and the tree.
``And you're still in here with other people you hardly know and the stress is
always in the background. There's no privacy whatsoever. I'm not really in that
much, I don't like staying in. It gets even more depressing. We'll go out for
walks just to take the edge off the boredom.
``I don't think you can bring a family up like this. You can't concentrate on
trying to plan for the future, you don't know what's going to happen then. It's
not a normal life and we haven't got anything to look forwad to at the moment.''
He stops himself suddenly, apparently embarrassed as this outpouring of
desperation. ``It's an alright place here, but it's not our home.'' He pauses
again and curls his fingers around Jack's head. At his side Sherry lights
another cigarette and drops her head a little lower. ``I'm glad we're not out
on the street,'' he says finally. ``But what we have here it's just an
existence, it's not a life.''
A spokeswoman for East Kilbride District Council confirmed that they operate a
policy where those on the council house waiting list can only move up to 15
miles away from the town. Any further and they will be taken off the list. The
spokeswoman said that Sherry and Dave had been informed of the policy, and that
after the returned from Devon, the council had only taken five months off the
time they had waited for a house. ``That appears to be very reasonable, because
they did move about 500 miles away and it was a permanent move as such.''

REPUBLIC of Ireland officials may be ready to appoint a successor to Jack
Charlton as early as January 15.
Charlton resigned as manager on Wednesday and already a host of names have been
suggested as potential inheritors of his throne.
Mick McCarthy of Millwall and Wimbledon's Joe Kinnear are the front-runners,
but others in the frame include former Denmark and Turkey manager Sepp Piontek,
ex-England supremo Bobby Robson, Kenny Dalglish, Brian Kidd, Ron Atkinson,
Kevin Moran, and Liam Brady.
FAI chief executive Sean Connolly confirmed: ``The job will not be advertised.
Our executive meeting will take place on January 2 and set out the terms of
reference for the man we want. Essentially it will be a head-hunting
operation.''
It is expected that two senior FAI officers will start the interviews early in
the New Year and then report back to a full FAI council meeting on January 15,
which would be a rubber-stamp approval.
``We would very much like to have the new manager in place by January 23, when
our World Cup fixtures meeting takes place in Liechtenstein,'' explained
Connolly.
The Republic have what appears to be a relatively comfortable qualification
path to the 1998 finals in France after being drawn against Romania, Iceland,
Lithuania, Macedonia, and Liechtenstein last week.
The lure of a salary of #150,000, plus the remarkable sponsorship bonuses
available, means the Irish are in a position to talk to all the top managers.
McCarthy remains the favourite, but he said: ``I haven't spoken to anyone from
the FAI and I am wary of that tag. We all know what can happen to favourites.
``All I would say is that I would do my best if I got the job. Like any other
manager, I would look at the players available and make decisions on that.
``But to be honest, my first priority at the moment has to be Millwall. We have
gone from top of the first division table to tenth in five games. Speculation
about the Irish job is taking attention away from that.''

OPPORTUNITY knocked for Scott Murray two years ago, when he was scheduled to
represent Scotland at different sports on the same weekend.
The 19-year-old Edinburgh Academical, who has capped a story-book season with
his selection to play for Scotland A against the Italians a fortnight today,
had been chosen to play in an under-17 basketball tournament for Scotland. That
same weekend he was in the Scotland under-18 rugby team and it was time to make
a tough decision.
``I hadn't realised that the two things clashed, but when the basketball
coaches found out, they wanted me to play for them on the Friday night and on
the Sunday, and fit the rugby in between,'' said Murray.
``I couldn't do both and so I decided to go with the rugby. It seems I made the
right choice.''
Murray has played the game for just three years, but his rise through the ranks
has been meteoric. Standing 6ft 7in, but tipping the scales at just 15!s-stone,
Murray has been one of the finds of the season. He has represented Scotland at
under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels, and played, too, for the senior
Edinburgh district side.
With Scotland under-19 at the Junior World Cup in Bucharest last spring, it was
immediately apparent that Murray possessed a special talent on the touchline.
Bringing the basketball player's athleticism and ball-sense to touchline duty,
the youngster has been the most outstanding lineout jumper in Scotland this
season.
He has played front-line rugby for only two-and-a-half seasons, first with
Preston Lodge and then under the tutelage of David Sole and Jeremy Richardson
at Edinburgh Academicals, where he is midway through his second season.
Murray, who is currently taking highers at college and hopes to go to
university to start a sports science degree next year, is without doubt a star
in the making but is far from the finished product.
As a lineout leaper he is out of the top drawer, but elsewhere he is still
learning his trade and SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer, very much an admirer,
is keen that he be given space to mature in his own time.
``Scott is an exceptionally talented rugby player, but I would appeal to the
media to hold back a bit,'' said Telfer. ``He is very young and very light and
still learning the chores of a lock about the park.
``We don't bring a 19-year-old into the A side lightly, but he has showed that
he can handle each step up so far, and not only handle it, but be outstanding.
He must, though, be allowed to develop without intrusive attention.''
The taciturn Murray said yesterday: ``I've come a long way in a very short
space of time and I have to admit that I didn't expect it to come so soon. Jim
Telfer phoned me to tell me I had been picked on Wednesday night and the letter
came the next day.
``I'll approach the game with the same kind of attitude that has got me through
this far and, hopefully, it will be OK.''
Murray, who is now involved in an intensive weights programme and has put on a
stone in the past year, is already the subject of approaches from rival clubs
now that Edinburgh Academicals have been relegated to the second division.
However, he wants to stay at Raeburn Place next season. ``I have benefited from
the help given to me by David and Jeremy and I would like to stay at Accies.
Hopefully, that's the way that it will work out.''
q.LAST night's inter-district championship match between Edinburgh and North
and Midlands, which was originally scheduled for Meggetland, with Murrayfield
on weather stand-by, has been postponed and a new date will be arranged.
Meggetland was unplayable, as were the back pitches at Murrayfield. The SRU say
is was not possible to bring the main pitch, with its undersoil heating, into
play because it had been used for the Schools international between Scotland
and France earlier in the day.

THE BORDERS BOOK
Edited by Donald Omand
Berlinn, #16.99
THE title says it all. This is a wide-ranging exposition of the Borders of
Scotland, ranging from its geology and very early history to such niceties of
modern times as rugby, the distinctive dialect, or dialects, and the King's Own
Scottish Borderers.
That breadth of interest is both the book's strength and its weakness. For in
his obvious desire to look at many aspects of the Borders, the editor, Donald
Omand (head of the Department of Adult Education at Aberdeen University), seems
unable to decide whether the Borders Book should be an academic work, or an
account of this unique area and its people, written from a human point of view,
with the distinctive ring of the Border voice coming through.
The early chapters are authoritative, comprehensive treatises on archaeology,
landscapes, prehistory, etc, using the correct academic terms and descriptions
as befits their subject matter. But they make heavy reading.
Not until chapter six, written by the self-taught historian and former
fencing-contractor Walter Elliot, does the book come alive. The Borderers have
a long tradition of story-telling and balladry - think of Hogg and Scott and
many more who wrote down and perpetuated the ancient oral tradition - and the
words of Elliot and other Border contributors, such as Judy Steel and Brigadier
Frank Coutts, are fine reminders of the art.
Elliot covers the period between early medieval times and the Union of
Parliaments in three vivid chapters which still have great relevance to the
area today. Among his most interesting revelations is the story of the Selkirk
Papers, some of which had lain in the attic of Selkirk's Commercial Bank since
the sixteenth century until the Second World War. Then, an edict that
``wastepaper'' must be burnt to reduce the danger of wartime fire sent a
zealous bank manager to clear them out.
Fortunately, next door were the Mason brothers, bakers, who persuaded the
odd-job man who was delegated to burn the old records, to let them have a quick
look. Despite the bank manager, the brothers determined to save what they could
and, in fact, managed to rescue around a fifth of these wonderful documents
from the flames. On his death, Walter Mason willed the papers to Walter Elliot
and, after years of study, a trust set up by Elliot has published some of these
remarkable archives as The Selkirk Protocol Books 1511-1547.
Judy Steel, with a claim to Border history in that she and her husband, David,
restored the old Border peel, Aikwood Tower, contributes chapters on Borders
traditions in general and the annual common riding festivals in particular,
still local events rather than anything staged for the tourist trade. She also
writes on Border folklore and James Hogg.
The final chapter, contributed by Borders archivist Ros Brown on the Border
Regional Archive and Local History Centre, indicates that there are many more
sources still to be tapped in addition to that rich oral inheritance.

AS a blind man, Ernie Plimer holds his own in a personal world of dark
confusion; blind drunk his life was black chaos. He was, he admits, a liability
to himself, his family, and his employers. Sober these past 32 years, Ernie
concedes at the age of 78 that Alcoholics Anonymous, then running, made life
worth living again. To prove it, he will make a personal statement, lining up
as the oldest competitor in Edinburgh's New Year athletics meeting.
When the hospitality flows with traditional profusion at the Meadowbank meeting
a week today and tomorrow, Ernie will touch not a drop. In 1974, when he made
his running debut, the meeting was sponsored by a brewery - the first time
drink had ever done him a favour.
Since then Ernie has missed only two of the annual footracing festivals. Last
year a poisoned mouth - dentistry gone wrong - kept him out; and in 1987 he
went to the World Veteran championships in Australia where he reached the final
of the over-70 100 and 200 metres, finishing fifth and sixth respectively.
``More than 30 people ran each event,'' he says.
Ernie has won the Scottish 70-plus title at both 100 and 200m for the past four
years, and the British titles from 1992-'94. When he went to defend his UK
crowns this year the train broke down, and he was abandoned at Carlisle for
three hours, missing the race. He is eagerly anticipating the world event in
Britain four years from now: ``provided my eyes hold out that long.''
Red all-weather tracks are all he can run on now. ``I used to run in the
Queen's Park, but kept bumping into things, and until six years ago I did the
highland games, but I can't make out white lines against the green, any more,''
he says.
Even technology could not alleviate an affliction which makes even dim light
blindingly bright. He had 26 fittings for contact lenses during the '60s, in
the days when they were made of glass. Now lenses are of plastic, to which he
is allergic.
``I can see only a couple of metres - enough to make out the white lines
against the red,'' he says. ``Running in lanes, knowing there is nobody there
to bump into, gives me the confidence to run.
``Nervous? Not at all. On the track I am free - the only place I am at ease. I
feel tense just crossing the road, or alone at the bus stop, when I don't know
what number of bus is coming. There is a lot more tension there. I refuse to
carry a white stick. It just advertises your disability and makes you
vulnerable to thugs.
``I get off the bus and the glare off the pavement is unbearable. I like dull
days, and when I get on to the track, the stand gives a bit of shade from the
light.''
Ernie became blind when put in an orphanage, aged five, during the Depression.
``We lived in Alloa, and my mother took ill. My father could not give up his
job, and my sister and I were sent to an orphanage in Aberlour. By the time I
could go home a year later, malnutrition had ruined my sight.
``From the age of six to 12, I had no schooling at all. It would never be
allowed to happen now. I was in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and passed the time
playing hymns on a wee trumpet. A man training for the ministry was in for an
operation which went wrong, and he went stone blind.
``Later he qualified as a minister, found out where I lived, and told me how my
hymns had helped him through a difficult time. It was he who got me admitted to
the school for the blind. I was educated there till I was 18.''
Ernie worked as a rep, selling articles made in the asylum. But drink
eventually became his master. ``I was on the booze for 25 years, and was a
complete wreck by the time I was in my forties - in the pub all the time.
Eventually I couldn't concentrate at all, got found out, and lost my job.
``The guys at the AA showed me the way - I clung to every word. I could not
face that again. I would go swimming, then walking and climbing, with a camera.
It was 10 years before I started running - thanks to a chance remark from a guy
at the pool who said he was training for the New Year meeting.
``As a teenager, the old ped who trained Edinburgh Police wanted to prepare me
for the big sprint, because I showed some ability. I never did go, but I once
stayed sober for a week and won five bob (25 pence) in a long jump contest. I
immediately drank the winnings. But that one chance remark got me thinking.
``I was 59 when I started running. The strength had come back to my legs, and I
felt clean again, like it was a new beginning. You lose your own identity,
drinking, and when I started running it was using an assumed name, Ernie
James.''
The nom de guerre was in the best pro tradition, but it suited him for another
reason. ``I was disgusted with myself, ashamed of my name, of letting the
family down.''
His wife and daughters stuck by him, but he admits people would cross the
street to get out of his way. ``But running gave me a new start, and respect.''
He has twice won the veteran sprint, and has entered that as well as the big
sprint next weekend. Wherever he finishes, Ernie will be a winner. ``I just aim
to do my best, and not make a fool of myself. The benefits are for my whole
body, and my outlook psychologically. I would be plunged into depression
without running in my life.''

The Given Note, Liam O'Flynn (Tara)
q The uilleann pipes-meister returns, pumping blood through the Irish, Scots,
and Galician traditions and presiding over the gloriously rambunctious, the
frankly romantic, and the elegiac alike. Andy Irvine and Paul Brady, chirpy and
wan respectively, contribute a song each; Sean Keane plays superb earthy
fiddle; Shaun Davey provides arrangements both warm and spiky; and Seamus
Heaney contributes the title and an enthusiastic sleeve note which the contents
live up to with ease.
Lunar Spell, Andrea Vicari (Thirty-Three)
q Vicari's well-received debut, Suburban Gorillas, featured her writing for an
11-piece. A year on, this follow-up finds her still-developing piano talents at
the heart of a quintet including the robustly creative saxophonist Mornington
Lockett. The reward principle seems to be at work for both musicians and
listeners - get through the initial tense intricacies and the overdrawn title
track, and there's some celebratory Africana, a latin romp, and a sturdy blues
to enjoy at the end.

BULLETS OVER BROADWAY (rental, cert 15).
n COMING from any other director but Woody Allen, his 1982 grouchfest Stardust
Memories could have been a great career move towards early retirement; never
has any popular artist dissed his audience as thoroughly as Allen's alter-ego
Sandy Bates, with his mean moans about the fans who ``loved all your movies -
especially the early, funny ones''.
Fortunately for us all, however, Woody and the Muse of Comedy have gradually
come to kiss and make up, and Bullets Over Broadway finds their rapprochement
almost complete. They've moved back in together, but - if the third act is any
guide - he still reserves the right to sleep with her sister Tragedy at the
weekends.
For its first hour, Bullets Over Broadway is the best Woody Allen for 20 years.
With the amiably hangdog John Cusack in the obvious Allen role as a deep and
meaningful young 1920s playwright having trouble getting his latest play put
on, saved eventually by a gangster angel at the cost of a big role for his
talentless Brooklyn moll (Jennifer Tilly), it flies through 60 minutes of
breezy backstage comedy at a hell of a lick.
Driven by superb performances from Dianne Wiest as a Great Actress and Chazz
Palminteri as Tilly's mob minder, the dialogue sings like a stool pigeon. The
grim contrasts between the razzmatazz of the Great White Way and the offhand
brutality of Palminteri and his fellow goons stays just the right side of
repulsion, while the central-plot device of having Palminteri turn out to be a
better writer than Cusack works brilliantly.
Two-thirds through, however, there's an awkward shift in tone: the laughs
disappear and it all winds up on a hasty romantic resolution justified by
nothing that's happened before. Flawed as it is, however, this is a damn fine
little lullaby of old Broadway.
ED WOOD (rental, cert 15).
n THE great thing about Edward D Wood Jr that Tim Burton's sweetly strange
biopic recognises is that he wasn't (just) a talentless bum with access to a
movie camera; he was the McGonagall of cinema, utterly sincere in his art and
convinced of his genius despite all public and critical evidence to the
contrary.
That's what gives Ed Wood its tenderly humorous tragi-comic tone. Burton, the
auteur-angel of oddball sympathy from Pee-Wee's Big Adventure to The Nightmare
Before Christmas, sees the crippled artist behind Z-grade movies like Glen or
Glenda and Plan 9 from Outer Space and respects his dreams.
Shot in shimmering black and white, Ed Wood concentrates on the nearest Wood
came to having any golden years - 1954-56, when he befriended Bela Lugosi.
Johnny Depp plays the role of his life as Wood, radiating optimism and charm in
sharp suits or angora drag as he hustles money for his loser movies, the
recreation of whose filming is terribly funny and terribly sad. But it's Martin
Landau who steals the movie with a heartrending performance as the half-mad
Lugosi, and the film loses a lot of steam after Lugosi dies.

Joe Donnelly speaks to scientists who not only believe in Santa, but have
proved exactly how he delivers presents to millions of children around the
globe in just one night
IT CAN fly in any weather, circle the globe overnight, carry millions of pounds
of cargo, and make silent, rooftop landings with pinpoint accuracy. Is it a
stealth bomber? Maybe even Space Station Alpha? No, it's Santa's sleigh, one of
the engineering wonders of the modern world. And a US scientist thinks he's got
it sussed.
Dr Larry Silverberg at North Carolina University speaks our language, and he
puts his mind to some problems that other scientists don't have the imaginative
capacity for. There are few doctorates or major grants in working out the
mechanics of Santa's sledge.
That does not bother Silverberg. He's a believer, and he tells us: ``Santa
clearly is ahead of the game when it comes to applying advanced scientific
theories to his sleigh's design. Children shouldn't believe others who say he
isn't real because there's no way he could deliver toys all over the world in
one night. There is a way, and it's based on plausible science.''
As an academic exercise in fun, and as an aid to beleaguered parents who are
asked many an awkward question at this time of year, Silverberg, who's a
professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and a member of Nasa's Mars
Mission Research Centre, set his students to work.
They came up with answers to the questions most often asked about Santa's
operation.
How can Santa's sleig
How can one sleigh carry all those presents? It doesn't have to. Thanks to
state-of-the-art nano-technology, which was developed in 1988, Santa can now
use a hierarchical distributed mobile manufacturing system to make the gifts on
site in each child's home. Silicon-chip-based machines, so tiny they can fit on
the head of a pin, are loaded with a code containing the child's toy list.
Using large-scale algorithms similar to those that make DNA work, the machines
literally grow the toys, atom by atom, from bits of snow and soot that Santa
collects along his route.
How can Santa's reindeer fly? It's in their genes. After centuries of selective
breeding and (more recently) bio-engineering, the volumetric displacement of
their lungs is of such a proportion that when filled with an appropriate
mixture of helium, oxygen, and nitrogen, they become buoyant.
What is Santa's sleigh made of? Since it's never been analysed in a laboratory,
we can't be sure. But it is likely to be made of a Kevlar-like composite fibre
encapsulated in an epoxy resin matrix. This would make it very strong,
lightweight, durable, and cold-resistant.
Silverberg's team missed out a couple of other important questions which we at
Frontiers have investigated with equal vigour. What makes Rudolph's nose shine
so? Professor Ken Killham of Aberdeen University recently found the answer in
the ``lux gene'' which enables some organisms to glow in the dark. These genes
can be grafted into other organisms, and this has obviously been the case with
the reindeer.
And as far as getting down the chimney is concerned, that's an easy one.
Einstein's theory also allows for the expansion of matter at acceleration
nearing the speed of light. Under the aforementioned conditions, while Santa is
working in a stasis period, the conditions enable his own atoms to contract
just enough.
And why does he live in the North Pole? Because he's one cool dude, of course!
And he needs the peace and quiet.

<HEADLINE>Bradford injunction on Megson move</HEADLINE>

GARY Megson was last night halted from taking over as manager of Norwich after
former club Bradford were granted an injunction against the Norfolk outfit.
Megson walked out on the second-division club on Thursday to return to Carrow
Road, where he had been caretaker manager following John Deehan's resignation
last season.
But Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond accused Norwich counterpart Robert
Chase of making an illegal approach to 36-year-old Megson, after he had sent a
fax to the Canaries saying they could speak to Chris Kamara's assistant only if
they agreed to pay #100,000 in compensation.
The two chairmen became embroiled in a war of words during the day, with
Richmond accusing Chase of ``a flagrant breach'' of Football League regulations
and Chase responding by promising a vigorous defence.
But last night Richmond and his club were granted a High Court restraining
order for the next seven days by a judge in chambers.
The order means Megson is legally prevented from taking up his post for
Norwich's Christmas fixtures at Portsmouth today and at home to Southend on
Boxing Day.
q ANDY Linighan steps out of the Arsenal shadows to take on British football's
most expensive player Stan Collymore at Anfield today, with Highbury manager
Bruce Rioch telling him: ``This is the chance you've been waiting for.''
The 33-year-old Geordie was a Wembley hero for the Gunners in 1993, scoring the
last-gasp FA Cup winner against Sheffield Wednesday. But his career has gone
into reverse, and under new manager Rioch he has made just one fleeting
appearance as a substitute.
Now, with Tony Adams and Steve Bould both suspended, Rioch is forced to change
his defence for the first time this season, with Linighan drafted in to partner
Martin Keown in the centre.
The Liverpool line-up is likely to be the one which beat Manchester United on
Sunday, with Rob Jones again at left back in the absence of Phil Babb.
While Liverpool and Arsenal both need a win to lift themselves back into the
championship race, Newcastle could find themselves 10 points clear of the pack
if they can overcome Nottingham Forest at St James' Park, where will be a pitch
inspection this morning.
q SIMON Osborn yesterday completed his #1m move to Mark McGhee's Wolves - and
fired a parting shot at his old Queen's Park Rangers manager Ray Wilkins. The
23-year-old midfielder will make his Wolves debut away to another former club,
Reading, after falling out of favour with the Loftus Road manager.

RAIN appears to be running neck and neck with frost in the race to become the
most disruptive influence to the National Hunt programme on Boxing Day.
The weather people have predicted a thick band of rain pushing south during the
weekend, followed by further cold nights as the country limbers up for a full
sporting programme on Tuesday.
``There has been some heavy rain up and down the country, but that has now died
out,'' commented a spokesman for the Met office. ``However, on the tail of the
rain which is moving south - reaching the south coast on or around Sunday -
there will be sleet and snow and colder weather.''
A further warning by the weather centre for snow on the hills in the north will
not cause Kempton's clerk of the course, Michael Webster, any sleepless nights,
but the threat of further rain is another matter.
``We have had two inches of rain in the last five days and further showers
forecast,'' said Webster. ``But the forecast is for colder, brighter, and drier
weather until Boxing Day and my only worry at the moment is the forecast heavy
frost for Christmas night.
``We will take the precaution of covering the take-offs and landings. At the
moment there is some good ground but a lot of soft.''
Ayr's Boxing Day fixture is in jeopardy due to an expected freeze. Course
manager Mark Kershaw said: ``The course is raceable at the moment but there is
a severe frost forecast for Saturday and Sunday night, and in view of that we
will hold a precautionary inspection at 11.30 on Sunday morning.''
Ian Renton, track official at Wincanton, is optimistic of racing taking place
at the Somerset track. ``I am confident and the prospects are very good,'' he
said. ``The going is good to soft, but the threat of severe frost has receded
with only a light frost forecast for Christmas night.''
Newton Abbot had water lying on top of heavy ground yesterday, but a spokesman
reported: ``We don't have to race until Tuesday and the forecast over the
weekend is for drier weather.''
Hereford, Market Rasen, Wetherby, and Wolverhampton report no problems and are
confident the weather will not beat their attempts to race.
And although Sedgefield has frost in the ground, clerk of the course John
Cleverly is hoping that predicted favourable weather for the Durham area
materialises over the weekend.
q TRAINERS David Nicholson and Gordon Richards have nominated horses for
sponsored charity bets on Boxing Day. Nicholson selects Shankar (Kempton 12.45)
and Richards's choice is One Man (Kempton 2.20).

A PLAYER from Iceland and Oldham may seem unlikely bedfellows in the pioneering
post-Bosman era, but that combination could test the theory that domestic
transfers can operate as per normal, despite the EU ruling, writes Ian Paul.
The English League have instructed their lawyers to examine the full
implications as Oldham seem prepared to cash in on the European Court ruling by
signing out-of-contract Stoke midfielder Toddy Orlygsson for no fee.
The Latics could become the first club to benefit from the European Court of
Justice's declaration that the current transfer system contravenes European
Union law.
Oldham made a #100,000 bid for the 29-year-old Icelandic internationalist, with
Stoke demanding #400,000 following the midfielder's decision to reject a new
deal which would have kept him at the Victoria Ground.
Oldham opted to sign the player - who joined Stoke on a free transfer from
Nottingham Forest in August 1993 - and let an independent transfer tribunal set
the fee on January 9.
By then, though, UEFA are expected to have made a definitive announcement on
the Bosman case and Oldham are aware that it is possible Orlygsson's status as
a free agent could see the player arrive at Boundary Park for nothing.
Oldham manager Graeme Sharp said: ``It looks like there might be a precedent
set, but we will just have to wait and see what UEFA say.
``We have done everything right. Stoke put a valuation and we told them what we
wanted to pay.''
Football League spokeswoman Sheila Andrews said: ``We have not encouraged
Oldham to take this stance in any way because we cannot say where we stand on
the matter until we take legal advice.
``The tribunal on Orlygsson is due to meet on January 9 and by that time our
lawyers will have advised us on the legal implications of the Bosman case.
``Oldham will obviously put forward the Bosman ruling as part of their case,
but we cannot really comment on that until our lawyers have examined the ruling
in full.''
However, Stoke manager Lou Macari is confident that the Bosman ruling will not
save Oldham from having to pay a fee for Orlygsson.
Macari said: ``I don't know what everyone is getting so excited about. I expect
the tribunal to go ahead on January 9 and we will get a fee for Toddy.''
His club's chief executive, Jez Moxey agreed. He said: ``I've spoken to Graham
Kelly (FA chief executive) and David Dent (Football League secretary) and both
have asured me it's business as usual.
``Oldham have given every indication they are prepared to pay a fee and have
followed the rules which govern the tribunal procedure.
``They have already paid us #50,000, which is half their bid of #100,000,
although we are looking for substantially more than that.''

SKI-ING
THE newly unveiled Edinburgh's Telford College Developing Excellence (DEX)
programme, integrating education, career, and sports for athletes, has had
double cause for celebration.
In recent slalom, giant slalom, and Super G races in North America, four of the
five Scottish skiers on the pioneering course skied to personal best
world-ranking points scores, ahead of their early season targets.
The capital initiative offers a mix of coaching facilities and academic courses
from higher grades to many diverse qualifications.
The initial experiment with Finlay Mickel yielded favourable exam results and
allowed him time on the snow. Last week, Mickel, pursuing qualifications at
Telford, recorded one of the better British Super G results of the season.
Ski-ing is an acid test of the course's flexibility. The Scottish squad of 17
and 18-year-olds will face 190 days on snow this year - 160 at least abroad, a
schedule which even for the pre-university student would mean a choice between
missing a year's ski-ing to attain higher results, or skiing and trying to get
higher results at a college later.
With four sports involved - Ski-ing, rugby, football, and badminton, it is the
college's course tutors who are responsible for accessing the highest level of
cross training and fitness monitoring, while a management team take
responsibility for modules in lifestyle management, nutrition, psychological
preparation, and fitness.
Scottish ski coach John Clark has two main targets for the development of the
course. He would like to bring on younger, school-age skiers quicker through
the college - 16 and 17-year-olds - and wants to be able to build connections
with other colleges in Europe.

WILL you go for the ``Grand Master'' on Christmas Day, followed by a ``Russian
Defence''? Or will you stick to a more modest ``Minor Piece'', followed by a
nice ``Danish Gambit''? If you choose any of these, you no doubt visited Oban's
Boxtree Restaurant during last month's splendid Oban Congress.
The ``Grand Master'' is otherwise known as Scotch smoked salmon, served up with
creamed horseradish with ginger. The ``Russian Defence'' is a fine halibut
steak, with light creamy mustard sauce. The ``Minor Piece'', cheapest of the
``Openings'' on the Boxtree's menu, is unfussy cream of vegetable soup. The
``Danish Gambit'', a good Boxtree ``Middle Game'', is succulent pork steak,
with apple and almond sauce.
As you can see, the Boxtree Restaurant got into the swing of things to welcome
the chessplayers to Oban. Their lengthy menu of ``Openings'' and
``Middlegames'' also proved an entrepreneurial success, with chessplayers
packing out the place throughout the Saturday night during the congress.
I hope all your celebrations next week go down as well as the Boxtree's bash. A
word of caution, however - just go easy on the ``Poisoned Pawns''!
This week's game is also a firecracker. Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand won
the recent super GM tournament in Belgrade. Kramnik, in great form, destroys
Vassily Ivanchuk's defences in a brilliantly played King's Indian Attack.
White: V. Kramnik
Black: V. Ivanchuk
Investbanka International, Belgrade 1995
Reti's Opening
1 Nf3 d5 2 g3 c6 3 Bg2 Bg4 4 0-0 Nd7 5 d4
This is a relatively new idea against Black's system. The usual move is 5 d3,
aiming for a later e4 or c4. It looks strange apparently not to contest control
of e4. But White still has prospects of a later break with e4 in the centre, as
we shall see.
5 ... e6 6 Nbd2 f5?!
This is a typically uncompromising Ivanchuk plan. Rather than play the solid 6
... Ngf6, he tries to frustrate White's intention to break with e4 utterly.
Kramnik, however, throws doubt on this ambitious strategy.
7 c4 Bd6 8 Qb3 Rb8 9 Re1 Nh6?!
I am not sure where this knight was meant to be heading, but it certainly fails
to get there following Kramnik's next few moves. Perhaps 9 ... Ngf6 was better,
although Black may have feared 10 cxd5 cxd5 11 Ng5, and if 11 ... Qe7 12f3 Bh5
13e4 with good play.
10 cxd5 cxd5 11 h3 Bh5 12 e4!
This superb break takes full advantage of the dark side of Black's plan. The
move 6 ... f5, lost a development tempo and above all weakened the e6 square.
12 ... fxe4 13 Ng5!
There seems to be no good reply to this move, e.g. if 13 ... Qxg5 14 Nxe4 Qe7
15 Bg5 Qf8 16 Nxd6+ Qxd6 16 Bxd5 or 13 ... Qe7 14 Ndxe4 dxe4 15 Nxe6 with a
vigorous attack.
13 ... Bf7 14 Ndxe4 dxe4 15 Nxe6 Bxe6 16 Qxe6+ Qe7 17 Rxe4!
This quiet recapture emphasises the terminal nature of Black's weaknesses in
the e-file. If 17 ... Qxe6 18 Rxe6+ Be7 19 Bxh6 gxh6 20 Rae1 and wins.
17 ... Kd8 18 Qd5 Black resigns. Or if 18 ... Qf8 19 Bg5+ Nf6 20 Rae1 with a
winning attack, eg 20 ... Nf7 21 Bxf6+ gxf6 22 Re6 H5 23 Rxf6 Rh7 24 Ree6 and
wins.

IF the Scottish Rugby Union wish to improve the quality of the national XV,
they could do worse than sign up 11-month-old Luke Greer - as a selector,
rather than a player.
For Luke has won The Herald's Selector Rugby competition - or at least it was
his name which was on the winning entry, one of many filled in by his dad, Mark.
Remarkably, 15 of the teams which Mark completed (in his own name and that of
his son, plus wife, Victoria) finished in the top 50 of more than 5000 entries
for the contest, which was run in conjunction with Scottish Rugby magazine.
They tell us that five of the top 11 were Greer entries, and nine of the top 20
if you include one from Mark's brother, Simon.
The Greer family, from Glasgow's Kelvinside, have chosen to receive the #5000
cheque, which they will use to fly as a family to see Scotland play the All
Blacks in New Zealand next year.
Even more remarkable is the fact that Mark and Victoria were winners of
Scottish Rugby's contest earlier this year, which resulted in them going to the
World Cup in South Africa, where the then four-month-old Mark was Scotland's
youngest supporter, featuring on TV before the Scotland v France match.
Luke obviously went on a fast-learning curve, absorbing more than just the
rudiments of the game, to come up with a winning XV of his own so young.
``The real secret,'' confided his father, who played scrum half for Allan
Glen's until he quit to start his own business, ``is to spend a lot of wet
Saturdays at Old Anniesland, paying #6 to watch national league rugby.''
This is not even Luke's first success in a rugby competition. An entry in his
name won two VIP tickets to the Scotland v Wales match at Murrayfield, his
dad's thirtieth birthday. And entries from all three of the family are
currently in contention for a major prize in an English-based selector-rugby
style contest.
``We're not constantly ripping labels off baked beans cans,'' said Luke's mum,
artist Victoria Cassidy. ``We're not competition freaks, just rugby freaks.
Yes, we have a system, but let's not give everything away.''
The family won by just two points, from Mr N Anderson, of Edinburgh. Currie
stand-off Ally Donaldson, who topped the final player scores, and his wife,
Elaine, had three entires in the top 20.
Luke's winning team - it contained only two of the top-10 points scoring
players - was:
Graham Aitchison (Kelso); John Kerr, Scott Hastings (both Watsonians), Dave
McKee (West of Scotland), Derek Stark (Boroughmuir); Mark McKenzie (Stirling
County), Gary Armstrong (Jed-Forest); Milan Brown (Melrose) Kevin Barrie
(Jed-Forest), Gordon McIlwham (Glasgow High/Kelvinside), Robbie Brown

Charity shops are in the vanguard of fashion's constant plunder of the past.
Anna Burnside trawls round the racks of ladies' blouses and double-breasted
suits
DESPERATE for a Reader's Digest condensed book? Short of the glasses petrol
stations were giving away four years ago? Morningside Road in Edinburgh would
be a good place to start. With its 13 charity shops, it's a mecca for bargain
hunters, junk junkies and all the other people who are prepared to make the
effort to find something cheap and different.
It's also a half-mile example of the economic realities charity shops find
themselves facing. They're all competing for the three things they need to keep
going: customers, volunteers and donations. The recession, fashion's constant
plunder of the past and the age-old appeal of a bargain provide a market for
5500 charity shops throughout the UK, with an annual turnover of #200 million.
This represents 0.2 per cent of national retail sales and a lot of ladies'
blouses.
The Oxfam shop has fallen into Hoover and Biro territory, it has become a
generic term for any charity shop. The clear market leader, it began with two
shops in 1960. Now it has 842 shops in the UK, 68 of them in Scotland, putting
it in the national retailing top 10. Oxfam's nearest rival, the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund has 470 shops, 59 in Scotland. They keep on coming - around 35
new charity shops opened in Scotland last year, with tiny local organisations
just as keen as the established names.
The regular, predictable income that comes from shops is very attractive to
charities, giving them a reliable source of funds to cover their long-term
work. It also gives them a presence on the High Street and a drop-off point for
donations and cash for emergency appeals. Simon Hodson, who used to manage an
Oxfam shop in East Kilbride, is now the charity's Scottish press officer. He
reckons that their 50 years of experience in this specialised corner of
retailing will help them keep their number-one slot.
``We've been doing it longer than everybody else and we're trying to stay ahead
of everybody else. We started by default but have developed from that. Having
got to the top we're trying to think of ways to make sure we stay there. We
only run secondhand shops because they make a profit but that doesn't mean we
shouldn't do it well and efficiently.
``We're trying to get away from the down-market image, saying you can buy quite
trendy things in Oxfam shops if you know what you're looking for. It's
particularly good in retro periods such as now, when people can actually get
genuine seventies stuff - if our volunteers don't chuck it out because it's out
of date.
``It's a really complicated process, keeping up. Our volunteers don't go
clubbing on Friday and Saturday nights, they don't know what's trendy for a 14
or 15-year-old. With our volunteers being a different age group we've got to
help them so we give training, price guides, and send out newsletters to tell
them to look out for certain things.''
The shops with storage space have been saving the winter clothes handed in
through the summer to fill their shelves in the coming months. The single
biggest seller is ladies' separates in large sizes but the vagaries of style
mean that previously unsaleable items burst into fashion at unpredictable
moments.
``We couldn't give double-breasted suits away in the early part of the 1980s.
They would get handed in all the time, you could hang them on the rail but
no-one would even think about buying them, then suddenly Jonathan Ross starts
wearing them and that's it. Waistcoats came in and out - we were taking
waistcoats off the hanger of a three-piece suit and selling them for a fiver
when you couldn't get a fiver for the suit.''
Donations are taken straight to the sorting room, where volunteers sift through
the goods, price them, and get them ready for the rails. Around 80 per cent of
donated clothes are never sold and go for recycling. Volunteers are encouraged
to specialise in different areas, such as linen or books, and interesting items
will be kept aside for them to deal with. Microeconomics, especially the
housing market, affects the level of donations, as the charity shops benefit
from the major clear out that accompanies a move. The growth of car boot sales
has increased the competition for bric-a-brac. Hodson reckons: ``With boot
sales and The Antiques Roadshow, people are less likely to bring in things that
are of value than they used to be.''
Attracting reliable, committed volunteers is a constant worry for all charity
shops. Hodson says some Scottish Oxfam shops are struggling with 15 people -
the ideal number is 40. Some charities, such as Cancer Research Campaign
Scotland, have always had professional managers to run their 30 shops and look
after their precious volunteers. Oxfam has one manager for its two Glasgow city
centre stores.
Scottish trading manager Donald Easson says:``Historically, we have enjoyed
very good support from long-standing, committed volunteers. The difficulty is
that they're ageing and replacing them is more and more of a challenge. The
Glasgow shops may well be the way of the future but we're trying to resist it
because it will strongly hit our income and smaller shops could not sustain the
cost of a manager.''
Oxfam has been able to use its powerful position to combine selling some fair
trade goods with the tracksuits and tea sets. Last year in Scotland it made #1m
on recycled notepaper and Cafe Direct coffee, and #3.5 million on donated
goods. Oxfam argue, that, although they are new, these goods are an integral
part of its aid work, so should not affect the shops' charitable status.
``Selling the goods from an income-generating project for women        in
Bangladesh is          different from selling Christmas cards which have no
intrinsic value to our work,'' says Simon Hodson. ``They are very profitable
and we sell more than anybody else so we'll continue to do that but we are not
looking to develop that market, we want to develop the other side of it.
``The people giving us stuff tend to be the ones who buy the fair trade goods,
people buying secondhand clothes don't. We don't make profit on new goods, we
are supporting people in the projects but not making spare cash to allow us to
do anything else.''
Cancer Research Campaign Scotland sells no new goods except Christmas cards;
for the ICRF pot-pourri, cards, vases and other gift items account for between
two and eight per cent of their stock. Some traders are unhappy when charity
shops, with their tax concessions and rates relief, sell new goods. Carol
Stewart of the ICRF says they attract new customers, boost the donated stock
and help the shops make a profit. Simon Hodson reckons High Street shops have
no need to worry. ``If you're selling craft goods you've brought in from China,
I'm sure you can sell them cheaper than Oxfam. We're trying to persuade people
to spend more money so that the person who produced it is not being ripped off.
``People will pay a premium price. They say, `I've got to buy Christmas
presents so I may as well buy something out of Oxfam'. If they're going to
spend that money they might as well give it to us.''

Scottish Schools 12, French Schools 18
I BLAME David Sole, myself. In 1990, immediately after Scotland had completed
the Grand Slam by beating England, he handed over his blood-stained jersey to a
kid in the dressing-room. The boy, the Queen's grandson no less, was back at
Murrayfield yesterday winning a schools cap, the first member of the Royal
family ever so to do.
Not only did we have Peter Phillips. His mother, the Princess Royal, her
husband, Commander Tim Laurence, and his sister, Zara, were there too, sitting,
not in the Royal box but up in the top tier, the gods as it were.
All of this attracted about three times the normal attendance at a schools'
international and a fairly hefty delegation from the world's media. Indeed, in
another match which went on simultaneously, the story-seekers and
picture-takers fought a pitched battle with the security forces of the Scottish
Rugby Union.
There is nothing the old yellow jackets like better than imposing a ban on
media activities. With a jolly shout of ``Get back - you can't film there''
they soon sent the Christmas spirit soaring.
Even the president of the Scottish Schools' Union, Tom Robertson, took 15
minutes before he found anyone who would let him into the ground. ``More than
my job's worth, sir.''
Master Phillips, a bright young man studying for his A levels at Gordonstoun,
qualifies to be Scottish on residential grounds. He is said to dislike personal
publicity but with relations like his, he had better get used to it.
How did he play? Enthusiastically, would be my summing up. He is a great
encourager of others, a slap on the back there, a ruffle of the hair here, he's
a tactile lad. Once in the first half he was hit after the ball was long gone
and there was a flash of a Royal right hook which, probably just as well,
failed to find its target.
Peter tackles stoutly, he burrows well and likes to have the ball in his hands.
I am not at all sure that he is going to make it as a flanker in the senior
game - a little bit light and short on pace - but he is very determined. He
earned his cap.
Tom Robertson fielded the questions at the press conference. ``Peter's a bit
down like the rest of the lads because of the defeat, but he'll bounce back. I
thought his performance was whole-hearted - he gave everything he had.''
Will he play against Wales in the next match. ``Ah, that's for the selectors to
say.''
The game? Well, it was not exactly scintillating in the lachrymose conditions
and most of the bright spots came from the French, big boys, most of whom
looked as though they had been shaving for at least 10 years.
Scotland kicked four penalty goals, all from the boot of Gordon Ross, who is a
considerable fly-half prospect. I liked the cut of Tom Lightoller's jib - he is
one of PP's pals at Gordonstoun - and Telfer Boyd did well to take some decent
lineout ball.
The Scots actually led 6-5 at the interval, two penalties to a try from flanker
Benoit Jezequel. Fly-half Romin Teulet missed the conversion and several
penalties.
Ross booted us further in front but the French sparkled to life with a try from
winger Christophe Heymans and Silvan Kosdik added a third touchdown. Teulet
astonished everyone by kicking a goal and though Ross had one more shot in the
locker, it was not enough.
As the camera scrum around the tunnel was ruthlessly cleared by the guardians
of the stadium, a rumpled hackette enquired: ``What was the score?'' That the
Royals can still draw a crowd, I would say.
And will he present his jersey to D Sole?

THE final day of England's match against the South African students was washed
out and the contest abandoned as a draw, but meantime Jack Russell is back on
alert to bat at No.6 in Tuesday's fourth Test at Port Elizabeth.
Until his exploits on this tour, where his first-class batting average is
nearly 80, the wicketkeeper was criticised for failing to score enough runs
against top-class opposition. But his finest performance came in Johannesburg,
where he kept captain Mike Atherton company while the second Test was being
saved.
Manager Ray Illingworth and Atherton would like to confront South Africa with
five front-line bowlers on Boxing Day - particularly if the pitch is
spinner-friendly. The inclusion of all-rounder Mike Watkinson for his first
Test of the trip would give some batting insurance lower down.
But such a move would still represent a remarkable change in fortunes for
Russell - and confirm that he is now regarded as an all-rounder himself.
However, the 32-year-old Gloucestershire player insisted: ``I wouldn't try to
change how I'm batting. I play my own game these days and that's the way I must
continue.''
England will not decide until they have seen the Port Elizabeth pitch,
satisfied themselves about Peter Martin's fitness - he has a sore right
shoulder - and worked out whether Jason Gallian is ready to bat at No.3 after
just one innings in South Africa following his arrival from Pakistan.
The choice for England is whether the inexperienced Gallian, who also offers a
little medium-pace bowling, represents a better all-round bet than Watkinson's
off-spin plus lower-order run-making.
If they go for the second option in Port Elizabeth, then Robin Smith looks
favourite to move up to No.3 - with Russell happily accepting promotion to No.6.
q.DISCARDED all-rounder Greg Blewett gave the Australian Test selectors a
reminder of his ability with a century as West Indies struggled for form again
at The Gabba yesterday.
Blewett, who was dropped from Australia's Test side before the start of the
current three-match series against Sri Lanka, punished a weakened attack, and
scored 115 before the Australia XI declared their first innings on 323 for
seven.
West Indies openers Stuart Williams and Phil Simmons survived the final hour to
guide the tourists to 37 without loss at the close of play.

FINNISH Formula One driver Mika Hakkinen, recovering in his Monaco home from a
horrific crash in Adelaide six weeks ago which almost cost him his life,
yesterday declared that said he could not wait to start racing again next
season.
Hakkinen, who fractured the base of his skull in a 168mph crash in qualifying
for the Australian Grand Prix on November 10, said: ``The spark is back within
me in a big way. Now I'm thinking only about racing, about getting back to this
sport I love so much.''
He said he was already driving his own Mercedes in Monaco and had been told by
Formula One doctor, Sid Watkins, that he could drive his McLaren team car from
the end of January.
Hakkinen added: ``But at the moment, I'm not aiming for anything beyond getting
back to my old physical condition.''
The Finn said he had lost around 23lb in weight during his hospital stay after
the accident but that he was now eating well, taking long walks, and using an
exercise bike to get fit.
He said he recalled most details of his crash. ``I remember going flat out down
the straight, changing down to fifth gear for the corner, turning into it, and
feeling there was a problem at the back end of the car. I knew it was a
puncture.
``I tried to keep the car on the track but at that speed it was impossible and
I started spinning. I have no memory of actually hitting the wall, but I
remember sitting there in the car immediately afterwards and not being able to
see anything.
``I was feeling pain and I couldn't move but I understood what was going on and
remember telling myself to relax, just to let the medical people do their job.
``Certainly, I understood I was hurt quite badly and it was getting difficult
to breathe. Then I felt this massive pain in my throat which I guess was when
they put the tube in (for a tracheotomy) and at that point I lost
consciousness.''
Hakkinen said he woke up in hospital to be told by Watkins he had been lucky to
escape brain surgery.
``Later I found out that my helmet had hit the steering wheel and it was this
which caused my injury,'' he said.
``When I sit in my McLaren with the seat belts on, there is no way I can get
near the steering wheel with my helmet, so it just shows how big an impact I
had with the wall.''

GO ON ..... enjoy yourself! That's the kind of encouragement that keeps your
Frontiersman happy, especially when it comes from a serious scientist who has a
lighter side. His prescription comes just at the right time of the year.
Our festive philosopher is Professor David Warburton who is a founder and
co-ordinator of Arise, the Associates for Research Into the Science of
Enjoyment. Exactly our kind of people!
The Associates study pleasure and the quality of life, and debate issues on
alcohol, chocolate, coffee, tea, tobacco, and most other legal pleasures. They
believe that pleasurable experiences play a central role in human life and, in
moderation, can be beneficial to health.
Warburton, who's Director of Human Psychopharmacology at Reading University,
tells us: ``We want to put science into pleasure and we came together as a
group of academics who discovered that pleasure itself is a very
under-researched subject. The emphasis is on science, but we do enjoy our work.
``Pleasure is undervalued, and that is unfortunate from any point of view. We
know that pleasure is moderated by a common pathway in the brain. In cases of
depression, this malfunctions and people lose the pleasure in everything from
music to basics like organised sport or sex. They don't get enjoyment in music,
food tastes like cardboard.
``As they recover, they get the pleasure back. Tastes and smells activate the
pleasure pathway. We get the input from nice tastes and some things which
people drink. We know from lab studies that a few pieces of chocolate, a glass
of wine, a few puffs on a cigarette, a couple of cups of coffee, all make
people calmer in tests which we use for evaluating anti-anxiety conditions.
``Going back to science we know that pleasure strengthens the immune system and
reduces the stress hormone action on it. Pleasure is an antidote to ills.''
So how does a scientist advocating pleasure research the subject? What does
Warburton do for enjoyment?
``My own pleasures? I have normal healthy appetites. I enjoy wine ..... it's
good for relaxing. Stresses are inevitable. And we all suffer from them to a
degree. The important thing is how quickly you can unwind after it.''
Arise is taking its campaign for general happiness beyond Christmas and into
the New Year which, they say, after all the fun of Christmas, is a depressing
time of the year, and one riddled with guilt as New Year resolutions are broken.
``Happier people live longer. Our New Year resolution should be really to enjoy
to the full the only life we are likely to live.''

POWER PLACES OF KATHMANDU
Keith Dowman. Photographs
by Kevin Bubriski
Thames &amp; Hudson, #24.95
n AS moths to the flame, go climbers to the Himalayas, and there are few holier
spots where you can die. In Hindu tradition the great mountains of the Indian
subcontinent are the thrones of divine authority, and the antechamber of the
gods is the beautiful, elevated ellipse of the Kathmandu Valley.
Here, even the least sensitive of Nepal's trekker-tourists get some glimmering
of the intricate fabric of the valley's religious life, where the ancient
practices of animism and shamanism coexist with the high cultures of Hinduism
and Buddhism, each finding different expression in a multiplicity of temples,
shrines, and holy places.
Power Places of Kathmandu (Thames and Hudson, #24.95) is a rich pictorial
celebration of the ``focal points of divine energy'' where mighty pagoda
temples, solemn stupas, and unhewn sacred boulders permit human communicants to
make contact with the gods. The complexity of Keith Dowman's scholarly text is
simplified by the potency of Kevin Bubriski's colour photographs.
Their detail of sculpture, carving and relief is stunning. Here are Buddha
offering his flesh to feed a tigress on the Namo Buddha stupa, terrifying Kali
Mai with her necklace of skulls on the Golden Gate at Bhaktapur, noble Lord
Vishnu on his mount Garuda in the inner shrine of Changu Narayana, a gibbering
Hanuman, a Babar-like Ganesh.
Here, too, is the blood sacrifice of goats to the Mother Goddesses at Dakshina
Kali - a ceremony which sanguinary Western tourists enjoy snapping. The
Kathmandu Valley is under pressure from tourism and development. The authors of
this eloquent work let it make its case for ``the gods of the valley, the
magic of sacred places, and the unique creativity of the people''.

SOME golfers never score a hole-in-one, others are a little luckier, but good
fortune finally ran out for veteran American player Peter Sedore in California
yesterday when, after having recorded his eighteenth ace, the old man suddenly
dropped dead.
But the 83-year-old's son did not appear too upset at his father's passing.
``There was no other way he would have wanted it,'' said Sedore's son, Dennis.
``Maybe God wanted him to do it one more time before taking him.''
Sedore Jr added that is was fitting his father died while playing the game he
loved. And the happiness that came from the hole-in-one made it easier for his
family and fellow golfers to accept his death. Playing partner Bill Rutledge
said their trio did not know the ball landed in the hole until they looked in
the cup. He said Sedore Sr used a driver for the ace. ``He lifted his arms and
said, `Hooray, No. 18,'.'' Rutledge said. ``He was real happy.''
The group played one more hole. Rutledge signed the scorecard to verify the
shot. He called Sedore over to initial it, and Sedore collapsed in his arms.
Jack Pawling, president of the golf club, was playing behind the group. ``I
guess, if you have to go, then that's the way to go,'' he said.

THERE is a truth universally accepted, that one should keep one's name - not to
mention one's work - away from lavatory walls and doors. Traditionally, this is
the place for fantastic descriptions, where aspiring short-story writers relate
tales of pliant women and enormous men, which easily sit alongside advertising
slogans of which Maurice Saatchi could feel proud - Large Chest for Rent, Jig
and Tool Rigger, terms available or, best of all, from the men's lavatory at
Glasgow Central Station, Demolition work to hand, temporary erections a
speciality.
I first read about graffiti when I was 15. I knew what it was, but didn't know
it had a name. At the end of third year we were allowed to read what we liked
in the English class. I read a war novel. In the opening pages of Unbroken, by
Alistair Mars, a submarine commander comes north on a crowded overnight train
from London, arrives in Central Station needing what Americans call facilities,
and rushes into the first cubicle he can find. In it someone has written:
This bloody roundhouse is no good at all,
The seat's too high and the hole is too small.
Beneath which was added in a different hand:
To which I must add the obvious retort,
Your arse is too large and your legs are too short.
Cubicle walls and doors were best because one had time to read. Walls outwith
the cubicle were usually given over to shorter, snappier slogans. The condom
machine stalwarts - This is the worst chewing gum I have ever tasted, and
Remoulds, only used once - had just been replaced by the advertising slogan of
a Scottish Sunday newspaper - If it's going on it's going in - when the
government decided something should be done.
Aids arrived and everything became serious. Condoms could be mentioned in
public, the word was news, could be printed in the papers, and the items
themselves became respectable enough to be sold in places other than chemists'
shops.
Health requisite shops went out of business or became health food stores.
Something for the weekend? and Three in a packet, ye cannae whack it became
politically incorrect mentioned in hushed breath, if at all. People were
risking their lives and gentility was replaced by safe sex.
Now students at two Dundonian seats of learning, the Universities of Dundee and
Abertay, are being used as guinea-pigs in a health education scheme which is
laughingly described as innovative. All that's happened is that the Health
Education Board for Scotland has persuaded a number of writers to have extracts
of their work tastefully reproduced on A4-sized posters, and these extracts
from contemporary fiction will be pasted on to lavatory walls.
The approach is hardly novel. The basis of selection seems to be the mention of
a condom and circumstances under which it could have been bought or used. The
most famous of all, Stan Barstow's account of Vic Brown's failed encounter with
a chemist's assistant in A Kind of Loving - which even works in the film when
Alan Bates emerges with a bottle of Lucozade - is not the sort of thing at all.
This is the 1990s, and a thrusting new approach is called for; anyway, Lucozade
is now a sports drink. So the Dundee students will be treated to extracts from
Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh, Foreign Parts by Janice Galloway, The Rachel
Papers by Martin Amis, The Crow Road by Iain Banks, and High Fidelity by Nick
Hornby.
There is obviously a serious side. Young people, it seems, are reticent about
discussing condoms and even in long-term relationships know little or nothing
about previous partners. It's part of a wider scheme which includes a
publication for parents on teenage sexuality and a magazine ``packed with
practical advice for young people''.
So now that the impossible has happened, and advertisers have convinced writers
that a good cause can be served on lavatory walls, one question remains: ``Why
Dundee?''
I fancy going back in a few weeks' time, say around February or March, to see
what additions, amendments, corrections, slogans, or simple statements have
been added. I bet there's been some changes made.

THE dream of playing against Celtic this afternoon could end a nightmare for
Dumbarton's Hugh Ward.
He was involved in a freak, fatal car crash five months ago in which his friend
died. Ward, who fractured an ankle in the incident, has been struggling since
to recover and shake off the gloom that has hung over him since.
However, he is now back at work as a postman and training hard to recover the
form which enabled him to score 14 goals for Dumbarton last season.
Although he is on the mend, the memory of Martin Simpson and the accident in
August will not leave him. ``I just could not see the end of the tunnel,'' said
Ward. ``My family and friends and all at Boghead have hauled me up and given me
real hope.
``I do not know what I would have done without their help and support.''
``I was always a Celtic supporter and I've always dreamed of being in a match
with them. I was supposed to play, but now I don't now know whether the game
will be off because of the bad weather - and I've picked up a calf muscle
injury.
``I'll be at the ground for a fitness test in the morning. It's disappointing
because I would love to take part in the match.''

AMERICAN FOOTBALL:
COMPLICATED is an understatement. There is hardly a soccer scenario imaginable
which could match the ifs, buts, and maybes attached to the web of
possibilities which annually accompanies the last-minute scramble for places in
the National Football League play-offs.
With eight of the 12 places spoken for, the final round of regular-season games
this weekend allows 10 others to fight for the four remaining berths. For some,
victory will be enough; others must win while hoping that their rivals lose -
or perhaps that just some of their rivals lose.
Take the Miami Dolphins, for whom all-time great quarterback Dan Marino may not
get many more chances to win a Super Bowl. The Dolphins will be hoping that
Seattle win - or maybe that Seattle lose. Miami can clinch a play-off spot with
a win and one of the following:
l An Indianapolis loss or tie, or a San Diego loss or tie, or an Oakland loss
or tie, or a Seattle win.
l Or an Oakland loss and a Seattle loss, OR an Indianapolis win and a San Diego
loss, and either an Oakland loss or a Seattle loss.
The problems arise because there are different tie-break mechanisms which come
into play if teams have identical records. If teams are level within a
division, their records over all eight matches against divisional rivals would
be the yardstick. But in the chase for wild-card places, teams compete across
the whole American Football Conference, or National Football Conference, and,
when level, the records for comparison are similarly extended to all AFC (or
NFC) matches they have played over the season.
The paradox, basically, is this: the team above you in the division may not
come out of it too well if the comparison is extended to include non-divisional
matches, in which you happened to have fared better than they did. Thus, the
pecking order can change depending on which teams end up with identical,
overall records.
The standings (see below) show that Denver need an almighty amount of help
because of their 7-8 record in the AFC, but it is still possible for the
Broncos to make the play-offs. However, the Carolina Panthers, newcomers to the
NFC who also have a 7-8 record, cannot qualify because all possible tie-breaker
comparisons would be unfavourable.
Even those who already have qualified for the play-offs have something to play
for this weekend. In the AFC, Kansas City (12-3) and Pittsburgh (11-4) have
clinched first-round byes, but the Chiefs must stay one win ahead of the
Steelers in order to ensure the valuable, home-field advantage, which means all
their matches being played in KC.
In the NFC, San Francisco have the tie-break edge over their fierce rivals, the
out-of-form Dallas Cowboys, if they finish with identical records.
San Francisco remain favourites to win the NFC championship, and all the other
contenders will be hoping that Dallas, seen as softer, somehow manage to win
home-field advantage. The 49ers, the Super Bowl champions, are formidable at
their own Candlestick Park and the general opinion is that Detroit - with six
straight wins since coach Wayne Fontes was told he would lose his job if they
failed to make the play-offs - have the best chance of stopping the 49ers.
Pittsburgh and Kansas City are the AFC favourites, but many neutrals will want
Miami to qualify in the hope that Marino's golden arm will work better than in
1985, his only previous Super Bowl appearance. The opponents that day? The
49ers, of course.
Divisional standings of play-off hopefuls (teams in bold have qualified):
American Conference. East - Buffalo 10-5; Indianapolis 8-7; Miami 8-7. Central
- Pittsburgh 11-4. West - Kansas City 12-3; Oakland 8-7; San Diego 8-7; Seattle
8-7; Denver 7-8.

CHRISTMAS came early for the 23 of us who have been given contracts by the SRU.
With the potential to earn #25,000 this season we are not in the same pay
league as the New Zealanders, Australians and South Africans, who will be on
more than #100,000, but it's a start and, personally, I'm just glad that the
whole thing is over.
There's no doubt that the negotiations have been a distraction, but it was an
inevitable part of the road to professionlism. It's been difficult sometimes,
with all the to-ing and fro-ing over cash and with the rows going on over next
season's European Cup, to remember that first and foremost this is supposed to
be all about playing rugby.
The other point that has to be made is that now we're to be paid there's a very
real danger that the special relationship which has existed between the
Scotland team and the Murrayfield crowd might change.
In the days when we were just enthusiastic, but virtually full-time, amateurs
maybe the spectators were more inclined to be forgiving when things didn't go
as well as they might have done out on the pitch. Now, though, I suspect that
if results don't go as we would all want them to then the spectators will be
more inclined to say that you're not worth your 25 grand and you should get out
of it.
That's understandable and it's something that we, as players, will have to come
to terms with. If someone is paying more than 20 quid for an afternoon's
entertainment at Murrayfield and we're on three grand a game, then they are,
for sure, expecting to be entertained. They're not going to come along to see
Scotland beaten.
Of course, the 23 of us who have been given contracts are just the same as we
were before the deal was done. It's a great honour to play for your country and
if the International Board hadn't decided that the game was turning pro then we
would all have been perfectly happy still to play for the jersey. But it wasn't
the players who made the decision to scrap amateurism, it was the
administrators.
There is no doubt, though, that now we're semi-professionals, the fans will be
expecting more from the players and we will have to try even harder to meet
their aspirations which are, in any case, exactly the same as our own.
The Scotland A side to play Italy a fortnight today looks very much like the
real thing. When I heard that the selectors were going to use the A game as a
dress rehearsal for the Five Nations' Championship I can tell you that I was
sitting with fingers, and everything else, crossed until I knew that I was in.
I've had a bit of a fraught start to the season with injuries and illness and I
certainly wasn't taking anything for granted.
The omission of Craig Chalmers is the big talking point. Gregor Townsend has
got the No.10 shirt ahead of Craig. They are both very good players, but I can
tell you that Craig is one of the most competitive people that I know and he
won't give up his place without a fight.
Congratulations, by the way, to Scott Murray, who wins an A cap at the age of
19, which is very young for a tight forward. I've never met him, but he's had
rave reviews this season and he seems to be someone with a bright future.
Twelve red roses arrived at my home this week by special delivery. There was a
card and a telephone number and the message ``call me.'' Stewart Hamilton, you
great big softie, I know you want to kiss and make up, but all you had to do
was give me a ring.

IF A marriage is going to split up, Boxing Day is the classic time to do it.
One counsellor tells the story of a Scots family where the husband accused the
wife of having an affair, just before Christmas (she had been invited to dinner
by a visiting director of her company, where she was a manager). Their two
grown-up children, home for the holiday, stayed up late into the night on
Christmas Eve with their father, trying to convince him it wasn't true; by the
morning of Christmas Day the son had disappeared home, unable to face any more.
On Christmas Day itself the husband told his wife he was leaving, but changed
his mind on Boxing Day: ``Maybe we can work it out''. His wife said: ``I'm
leaving, then. You've proved you don't need me. Live your own life.'' Now that
really was a Christmas to remember: and by next December, the wife was in her
own house; by the following year, the divorce had come through.
``Around Christmas time, if a partner is going off a marriage they often choose
Christmas to tell their partner,'' said Sister Mary Ross of the Notre Dame
child guidance centre in Hillhead, Glasgow.
``Boxing Day is a great day for it, after Christmas Day is over and the kids
are settled, they will tell their wife they're away off with the secretary.''
``Women in particular have high expectations of themselves,'' said Deirdre
Bett, of Lothian Marriage Counselling Service. ``They want everything to be
nice for their families.'' The cruel truth is that people in robust, healthy
relationships make the most of Christmas, but fragile partnerships break,
making January the busiest time of year for counselling services.
Money causes extra stress. Ross said: ``We have got families here who are in
debt and trying to spend hundreds of pounds that they haven't got to keep their
children the same as any other child.''
And a death in the family too often goes unacknowledged. ``If there's been a
death in the family - when there will be a contrast between how happy they
could have been - I would advise them to acknowledge it, not to pretend that
everything was the same, to sit down and talk about what that person would have
been doing and saying over Christmas if they were still here,'' said Ross.
It's too late to get away from it all (it's no coincidence the rent of holiday
flats and cottages shoots up at Christmas and by November there's not a bed to
be had in the land).
You could work for others over Christmas; CSV Scotland runs volunteer
programmes during the festive period and would appreciate any help (call 0141
204 1681).
But for those who do have someone to share Christmas with - and a lot of people
on their own may envy even the bickering over the turkey - it's a matter of
survival. Relaxation is the key, says Anne Shearer, director of the Phoenix
stress counselling centre in Glasgow.
She suggests making time for yourself regularly, either by nipping into another
room, or outside, or simply practising good breathing technique, the basis of
disciplines such as yoga and Tai Chi.
Having a bath, even in the middle of the day, is also a good way to make time
and space for yourself. Don't expect too much, and delegate work - don't think
you have to do everything yourself; people are often delighted to be asked to
help, but will not volunteer. Keeping people busy, rather than just sitting
around, will dissipate tension.
If things get really bad, try talking it over with someone from outside the
family circle. Scotland's Marriage Counselling service has started a telephone
helpline manned in Glasgow from 6.30pm to 8.30pm Mondays, 10.30am-12.30pm
Wednesdays (0141 226 4122) and in Edinburgh from 10am-1pm Mondays and 4pm to
7pm Fridays (0131 558 3334, open 2pm to 4pm Wednesday, Thursday and Friday over
Christmas).
And try to keep things in proportion. ``If we are uptight and stressed and
tired, we get into a compulsive, obsessive frame of mind,'' said Shearer.
``We have to learn who is pulling our puppet strings about what we should and
should not do at Christmas.''

IN the run-up to the festive season the salerooms went all childish - trains,
toys, and teddy bears dominated the goods on offer. Christie's in South
Kensington decided to concentrate on trains and held two sales a day apart at
which they offered toys from famous makers like Basset-Lowke and Marklin, all
priced far beyond a small boy's pocket money.
Trains are now big business and last December, when Christie's held a similar
sale, a Marklin Swiss ``Crocodile'' locomotive made #35,200. On offer this year
was a gauge 11 armoured train with a gun carriage that Marklin made in 1909
(estimated around #20,000); and a 1937 model of the LNER's Cock o' the North,
one of the great historic trains of the Scottish railway system. The Cock o'
the North was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley who also designed the Flying
Scotsman, and it ran between Edinburgh and Aberdeen which was an arduous,
uphill journey that required nine tonnes of coal for ordinary engines. In those
days, nine tonnes of coal cost the same as a first-class passenger fare.
Gresley's design incorporated a unique coal-saving feature which made the
service much cheaper to run. This device was also carefully incorporated into
Marklin's model of the train which was estimated in the sale at around #20,000.
How many first-class fares is that?
For train fanciers there were also artefacts made by the British-based
manufacturer Basset-Lowke, including tiny water-towers with movable arms and
decorated with advertisements for such 1930s delights as Bovril and the Boy's
Own Paper (estimate between #600 and #800); and replica platforms of Harrogate
and Beaconsfield stations with carefully re-created ladies' waiting-rooms.
Another station lavatory made by Marklin, the German firm, had twin cubicles
marked Damen and Herren and so detailed were the models that the locks on the
doors worked. The men's lavatory was painted blue and the women's pink and the
estimate was also around #800.
Bonhams also got into childhood mood and on December 20 offered a range of
dolls, toys, teddies, and trains. The list contained a Basset-Lowke model of
the Flying Scotsman and the Royal Scot by Hornby. Lovers of the motor car were
not forgotten and a Kingsbury metal model of Sir Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird
included in the sale with an estimate of around #800.
Less macho toys were dolls and bears which included a Steiff centre-seam bear
dating from around 1910 (estimate about #3000) and a Tete Jumeau doll which was
expected to sell for about #1500.
In Scotland, Phillips included toys, dolls, and bears in two sales held in
Edinburgh. One of the star lots was a Shirley Temple doll, dating from the
1930s, dressed in a floral dress and hat. She had blonde curly hair, green eyes
with lashes, a pouting open mouth, and a jointed composition body and she came
with her luggage - four new outfits, extra underwear, and a Shirley Temple
badge, all contained in the original box. The estimate was around #500.
Among the Christmas presents from not so long ago attracting the attention of
collectors was a Tudor Rose table-top soccer game dating from the 1960s,
estimated at about #30, and a German-made toyshop with a four-drawer cabinet
inscribed with the words ``Rice'', ``Macaroons'', ``Chocolate'', and
``Raisins'', a counter and three-walled backdrop. It was made early this
century and is worth about #60.
Toy soldiers were a favourite at Christmas and in the Phillips' sale there was
a collection of ``Armies of the World'' lead soldiers, Steadfast soldiers, and
military memorabilia including postcards, magazines, and a cavalry jacket.
Because the soldiers were still in their original boxes, the estimated price
was #500.
Another sale of more unusual childhood items was held by Christie's in South
Kensington when they sold a collection of magic lanterns, lantern slides, and
optical toys brought together by a Mr and Mrs Lear who used to tour the
waterways of Britain in a narrow boat giving lantern shows. They started
collecting as recently as 1970 and in 1991 opened Lear's Magical Lantern Museum
in Llandrinod Wells, Wales.

I HAVE been reading through the garden notebook I used when we first moved into
this house, and am rather ashamed to see how much money I have spent over the
years on bulbs. What has become of them all?
Those white tulips that looked so coolly elegant under the variegated cornus
are no more than a lovely memory. And the frilly pink parrot tulips with the
green streak down all the petals, a perfect colour match for the neighbouring
azalea - all gone.
There are, of course, all sorts of natural explanations. The white tulips
lasted four years, the pink ones only two. Perhaps the pinks weren't planted
deep enough, or the mice ate them, or the urban fox who trots through our
garden every night may have nosed out some bonemeal in that bed and dug up the
lot (though I do think I would have noticed that).
This year I have decided to have one last throw. I have planted 38 tulips,
bought very cheaply from B&amp;Q, and from now on I shall concentrate on more
reliable bulbs.
Apart from the ubiquitous wild hyacinth which, though lovely en masse, does
tend to act like an enthusiastic extra from The Day of the Triffids, and my bed
of Crocus tomasinianus which is locked solid with their bulbs under a blanket
of small-leaved ivy, the bulbs that have done really well with me are all
autumn flowering.
They are the Colchicum speciosum which most of us think of as autumn crocus
though that is not strictly accurate. When grown alone, I used to hate the way
they flowered then promptly keeled over because the slender stems couldn't
support such a large flower head. Now I have them planted in a bed of nepeta,
the plant that sends cats into ecstasy and so gave it its popular name of
catmint.
Nepeta flowers first in tandem with the roses but, once the purple flower
spikes fade, I clip the whole bed back and there is time for it to flower again
in October on shorter stems just high enough to give support to the colchicums.
Grown this way the original three bulbs have increased enough to make quite a
bold statement. Inevitably, a few still sprawl but these are the ones I cut for
the house. Despite their very fragile appearance, colchicums last well in water.
The foliage appears in the winter and disappears in spring. The leaves are
large, bright green and rather coarse looking but, since everything else
including the cut-back nepeta bed is looking so miserable by then, I really
quite welcome it, always aware those big leaves mean a bold show of lilac
flowers next season.
The tiny Cyclamen hederifolium have been generous too. I had one corm under a
tree for years, the sole survivor of a group of three. It was a reliable
flowerer but never increased. Two years ago the tree had to come down and at
the last minute, as the men were revving up their chainsaw, I remembered the
corm and rescued it.
I decided to try it in a raised bed at the kitchen door where I reckoned I
would get maximum pleasure from its few fragile flowers whose back-swept pink
petals with deep mauve base look so brave in November's greyness. The prospect
was so enticing that I added another corm bought in bloom from the garden
centre.
After they flowered last autumn, I found several stems coiled like a bed
spring, each with a large seed at its centre. I had never noticed this when
they were under the shade of the tree, or perhaps it only happens when they are
in a site they are happy with. To help things along I poked the seeds into the
earth, and crossed my fingers.
This year I counted 35 perfect little cyclamen - the stems are no more than
three inches high and the blooms less than an inch across - and dozens of tiny
new leaves just showing above the earth. I was so delighted I promptly added a
pot of the white variety to my expanding colony. The silver-etched green leaves
will last all winter but I must find some way of marking their enlarged
territory so that I don't dig them up inadvertently when the leaves disappear
in early summer.
Undoubtedly the showiest autumn flowering bulbs are the Nerine bowdenii. There
is something rather startling about a show of nerines in October. Possibly it
is because one's eyes have become attuned to the autumn range of colours and
then come these tall stems that end in a burst of sweetie pink, fizzing like
sherbet, real Barbara Cartland efforts. They make brilliant cut flowers,
especially if you can team with some prunings from a red-leaved shrub like Rhus
cotinus.
The leaves come in early summer and have died down before the flowers appear.
They are hardy enough in Scotland but they do need a warm position. I grow them
at the side of the front door by the house wall where they get full sun, and
that bed is covered in gravel. They certainly seem happy there.
From five bulbs, the colony has grown this year to 37 stems, each one bearing
up to nine curling flowerlets. I must now think of splitting them, but that
will be the first bit of attention they have received in five years. That's my
kind of gardening.

Catherine Brown looks back at
trends in the
food industry
PEAK of the year for crazy food buying is Christmas. Caught at our most
vulnerable, exhausted, frazzled, brain-in-a-panic mode, we are in danger of
picking up the strangest items especially if they look as though they might
save time.
Such as this pack of ready-to-microwave baby potatoes - with pat of butter on
top - which the food industry is tempting me to pay extra for because they have
put butter on potatoes. Or will I grab this packet of ready-fried croutons? Not
if I stop to think that at 59p for 40 grams (just over an ounce) I could buy a
whole loaf for the same price.
Now I'm among the loaded shelves of Christmas cakes, Christmas chocolates, and
Christmas biscuits, in eye-catching packaging. Surrounded by bottles of festive
champagne and other drinks, I see the Christmas tag again. Only this time it's
on a packet of tea-bags - M&amp;S tea-bags to be exact.
Christmas tea-bags? On the shelf below, there is Christmas coffee! In the
interests of research I buy the tea-bags, described as the Connoisseur's
Choice. And a very ordinary cup of breakfast tea they turn out to make.
Of course, fads feed emotions in a way that has nothing to do with supplying
the essentials of life, yet they have become exceptionally powerful and,
depending on whether you get hooked or not, extremely expensive. Top of the
queer ideas which the food and drink industry manufacture, year in year out,
are those which feed the good-for-you factor.
A whole range of foods have been promoted on the strength of the idea that a
Mediterranean diet is good for you - while ignoring the fact that our climate
is a tad colder than the South of France. It started with extra virgin
olive-oil and balsamic vinegar which led to the pasta boom. Italian was in.
French, rich, buttery sauces were out. The sun-dried tomato was the signature
of a healthy Italian diet. At treble the price, ready-cooked char-grilled
peppers in olive-oil were hailed as the good-for-you alternative to native
baked potatoes and              butter.
This year has also seen a boom in jars of pasta sauces, not just based on
tomatoes, but also on a variety of other ingredients such as cheese. As far as
I understand it Italians usually grate cheese on their pasta and sometimes stir
an egg in to make                                  a sauce. As good-for-you
fads come and go, there has now been the discovery that the trans-fatty acids
in polyunsaturated margarines are not good for you at all, according to
American research revealed recently. So un-messed-about butter is back in.
Then there was the case this year of SmithKline Beecham, who make Ribena and
who thought they would jump on the good-for-you bandwagon with Ribena Juice and
Fibre. Their motivation, however, was a little less noble than the desire to
improve the nation's bowel movements.
In order to avoid paying VAT on a beverage, they tried to pass it off as a
``functional'' food which got them involved in a test case with Customs and
Excise. They tried to convince the officers that the characteristic Ribena
flavour was something they had added to the fibre. Of course, it was a health
food, they said, supermarkets should put it on the cereal shelves. No, said
Customs and Excise.
But this has been a year when drinks in general have had more than their fair
share of tampering by the fad-merchants, from alcoholic lemonades to the
good-for-you boom in sports drinks.
Some have claimed to be a replica of your blood, to prevent you feeling
exhausted (needing a spoonful of sugar?) and dehydrated (needing a drink of
water?)  The sophistications of this fad-market have been extended to producing
powders to mix into water or fruit juice. One, Glycosport, costing #14.95 for
25 servings, was described by a sports dietician as being ``of less use than
the water or  fruit juice it's mixed into''.
Clear,  flavoured-waters were another drink fad, developed to appeal to those
who had sussed out the disadvantages of artificial, brightly coloured
additive-loaded drinks. So while the offending colour was removed the unnatural
flavour was left in, producing a crystal-clear, looking good-for-you drink,
tasting artificially of fruit.
Supermarket fad of the year must be their appeal to our emotions to stay loyal.
``Loyalty cards'' have taken a number of subtly different forms, though not all
supermarkets have invested in the necessary large set-up costs. The cards have
been the supermarkets' reaction to our promiscuity, when they discovered from
market research this year that we were shopping-around too much for their
liking. I wonder why.
SEASONWATCH
IN A last minute fill-up of the fruit bowl, there are Cox's Pippins to go with
cheese, a pile of citrus fruits to eat after rich foods, a mango or papaya to
go with salty, smoky, cured meats. This is the time of year when fruits with
character can work as trouble-free accompaniments.
``The fashion in foreign fruits,'' says Garth Gulland of Roots and Fruits in
Glasgow, ``has moved away from strange, difficult to eat fruits, and back
towards less exotic tastes.''

n FROM selected stores around the UK, a seasonal gift. The diamante snowman
hails (s'cuse the pun) from the Attwood Collection of hand-crafted costume
jewellery.
It is made of Austrian crystals and an emerald enamelled scarf, set in triple
plated 22 carat gold.
It comes with a lifetime guarantee. Order from Attwood at Kingston-Upon-Thames
on 0181 547 3331. Price #69.25.
n Holding Back the Years: make-up worn at 25 will almost certainly be redundant
at 55. Serums help to create an immediate plumping and tightening effect which
lasts several hours. Concealer is a vital weapon. To make it undetectable,
apply it with the tip of the middle finger and repeatedly tap under the eyes,
over blemishes and broken capillaries. The lighter and creamier the product the
better. Dust with powder.
Choose moisturising or light-reflecting foundations, stay away from matt
formations. Most light-reflecting foundations contain silicone which creates a
smooth surface and does not clump into wrinkles or dry patches.
A heavy foundation will make you look older, so be soft and subtle as possible.
Stick to pale colours of eye shadow and blusher and avoid harsh lines. Pink on
the face is the softest.
They say that three things must go up as you age: your hair, your eyes and your
bosom. Steer clear of a hairstyle which surrounds the face. Hair pulled back is
flattering and takes years off you.
When, also, hair goes grey, its natural colour may no longer suit you. If you
dye it, stick to softer tones that will not harden the face.

Richard Jarman, director of Scottish Opera, who this year announced drastic
measures to save money, putting the organisation on a ``part-time'' footing:
n ``I'm a total Scrooge. I hate absolutely everything to do with Christmas, so
my best Christmas present would be to be put into a deep trance from December
1st to the 27th so I never, ever have to see a Christmas tree, Santa Claus,
decorations or anything. Having woken from the deep trance I would like my
present to be proper funding for Scottish Opera.''

n MEMBER of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Hari Krishna)
whose Scottish temple is in Lesmahagow:
We have three major festivals in the year, but Christmas isn't one of them - so
December 25 is just another day for us.
We'll get up at around 4am as usual, then get on with our work of taking the
message of Krishna out to the  people, most of whom will be staying at home.
That means knocking on doors, but on Christmas Day you're never sure what kind
of reception you'll get. Some people invite us in, others shout `Don't you know
what day this is?' and slam the door.

Lesley Duncan visits a Georgian extravagance where, at the
festive season, geese are well
and truly cooked
IF you can't stand the heat keep out of the kitchen, goes the transatlantic
admonition. The Georgian kitchen at Callendar House, Falkirk, is certainly hot
this particular morning. A cavernous, high-ceilinged hall, it has a giant coal
fire burning at one end, sending out sparks and cheer in defiance of the most
dreich of December days.
The early nineteenth century is much in vogue these days after the success of
the televised version of Pride and Prejudice. All those sprigged muslins and
heaving bosoms! Jane Austen's heroines may be too preoccupied with affairs of
the heart and the search for husbands to notice the servant classes, but modern
fascination with Regency/Georgian ways of doing things extends below stairs.
As it happens, this kitchen is on the ground floor of the mansion, which is
owned by Falkirk District Council and sits in acres of wooded parkland, its
turreted Scots-baronial exterior concealing earlier buildings. It boasts the
only working Georgian kitchen in Britain. It's the centrepiece of Callendar
House's celebrations of the spirit of Christmas.
The fire is being stoked for the cooking of a goose later in the day, explains
Kate Erskine, who with her team of five ``interpreters'' demonstrates the
workings of the place. Mrs Erskine is in period costume - gingham dress with
chaste neckline, white bonnet tied firmly under the chin.
She indicates the big wooden table where the trussed bird is awaiting its turn
on the spit. There are more instantly edible things laid out, too. The
temptation to nibble need not be resisted. Visitors are encouraged to sample
this nineteenth-century Christmas fare. Of course, historical accuracy
indicates that Christmas wasn't generally celebrated in Scotland in these days.
However, William Forbes, then owner of Callendar House, did entertain friends
from the South in the 1820s, so a little licence with the comestibles seems in
order.
First stop - the mincemeat pies. They look like M&amp;S specials but they contain,
authentically for the time, real mincemeat (``brisket,'' volunteers Mrs
Erskine) in addition to fruit and spices. The Scotch Christmas bun is very like
granny's black bun - dark and rich with fruit, spices, and brandy. The
Pitcaithly bannock is delicious - a shortcake mixture with the addition of
almonds and fresh orange and lemon peel.
Then there is the yule bread, made simply of oatmeal and water on Christmas
morning. It was cut in four as a sign of the cross, explains Mrs Erskine, and
each member of the family was given a quarter to keep till after the festive
meal. Good luck was meant to ensue in the coming year. A harmless fancy -
though quite how it fits in with the Presbyterian ethos of old Scotland isn't
clear. The same applies to the 12 ingredients of the plum pudding, symbolising
as they do the 12 Apostles, and the stirring of the pud mixture three times for
the Three Wise Men.
No doubt such colourful detail charms the many school children who have visited
the kitchen since it was opened to the public two-and-a-half years ago. The
recipes change every three months to suit the seasons.
The great iron range is authentic (was it made in the Carron Ironworks
nearby?). It's ideal, says Mrs Erskine, for making chocolate puffs - a kind of
meringue. ``But things that require a very hot oven can be a problem,'' she
adds. A copper pot reveals its bubbling contents. This is plum porridge, made
with beef stock and breadcrumbs, to which are added mustard, mace, plums (of
course), currants, and raisins.
Which meal was it served with? Apparently there's not an easy answer, for in
the Georgian period all sorts of dishes could be on the table simultaneously,
with the main ones - dubbed ``the removes'' - at the corners. There's a
splendid array of working utensils on the scrubbed wooden worktops. Most of the
pots are copper and surprisingly heavy. They are lined with tin - ``to stop
verdigris poisoning,'' says Mrs Erskine nonchalantly. There are also some
pewter pots.
Among the unusual kitchen utensils is a chocolate cutter. Georgians apparently
loved a drink of chocolate, sugar, and claret. The sugar didn't come in Tate
and Lyle packaging in these days but was stored in the form of a great cone.
Other drinks which visitors (over 18) may sample are mulled wine and Old Man's
Milk. The latter turns out to be more appetising than its name suggests, made
as it is from a pint of single cream, a quarter-of-a-pint of brandy, sugar, and
egg yolk. It sounds very much like American egg nog. Td.
A party of disabled young people enter the kitchen and Mrs Erskine starts her
living history interpretation again, immediately catching everyone up in her
enthusiasm.
The festive theme is pursued elsewhere in this imposing building, which is
gradually being returned to life after many years of standing empty. There's a
beribboned Christmas tree at the fork of the great oak staircase and various
Christmassy goods in the shop. The Jane Austen Cookbook echoes the period
flavour with its recipes for ``Ragoo of Celery'' and ``Harrico of Mutton''.
For the more scholarly there's the barrel-vaulted library with its bookcases
protected by trellisworks of brass. A professional archivist is in charge of
this history research centre. Visitors with a sense of the past will also enjoy
the exhibition charting the story of Callendar House from its origins as a
medieval keep 600 years ago. Mary Queen of Scots, Bonnie Prince Charlie, and
Oliver Cromwell put in a mandatory appearance. In deference to the 250th
anniversary of the '45, another room has a temporary exhibition devoted to the
Battle of Falkirk - complete with a specially commissioned picture of the fight
(which went the prince's way) by Chris Collingwood.
Jack Sanderson, the curator, points to a staircase where a reproduction of an
original early eighteenth-century ceiling painting is about to be put in place.
Its theme? ``It's as though you're at the bottom of a well, looking up at
little putti,'' he explains. It could be by the same artist who worked in
Hopetoun House at that period.
More mundane - but every bit as fascinating - are ``Presents from the Past''.
This annual exhibition is ``a way of saying thank you'' for donations to the
locld-fashioned washing machine, a garden plough, and lots of evocative old
photographs of local industries vie for attention.
A much more ambitious exhibition, due for completion in two years, will plot
the transformation of Falkirk during the Industrial Revolution from 1750 to
1850. Callendar House's owner William Forbes, himself a copper merchant, was
involved with leading innovators of the time such as Matthew Boulton, Dr John
Roebuck of Carron, and steamboat pioneer William Symington.
Beyond the pleasant seasonal celebrations at Callendar House, such long-term
initiatives to bring the mansion into imaginative public use must be admired.
n Despite its grandeur, Callendar House can be elusive to find for people
unfamiliar with Falkirk. It's off the A803 on the east side of the town.
Parking is some distance from the house, though the walk through tree-lined
avenues is most pleasant. There are also outdoor attractions for the family.
The house will be open next week from Wednesday to Saturday, 10am to 5pm, and
on the same days and at the same times in New Year week. In the winter season
it's open normally from Monday to Saturday.

THERE'S nothing quite like the scents of Christmas, especially the aromatic
smells of pine or spruce needles. However, if your tree is not of a natural
type and you're looking for something a little more subtle than the
pine-scented plug-in room freshener, why not try a simmering pot-pourri?
Most people associate pot-pourris with dried leaves, petals and spices, but a
pungent, spicy mix can be simmered at the back of the stove or even in a foil
container in a cool oven with the door left slightly open.
The basic mix I use consists of four ounces each of whole allspice, star anise,
cardamon, chopped root ginger and broken cinnamon sticks mixed with eight
ounces each of orange peel, lemon peel, rose petals and lemon verbena leaves.
To this add 30 drops of juniper or rosemary oil and mix well. Make a simmering
mix with the ratio of one cup of pot-pourri, to two to three cups of water. The
ingredients can be found at most natural beauty shops, health food stores and
delicatessens specialising in unusual spices.
``. . . They presented him with gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.''
These, the most quintessential of nativity gifts, were fitting offerings for
the infant Jesus with gold representing wealth and the herbs being of precious
value for their healing, aromatic and cosmetic properties.
The frankincense tree, also called olibanum, produces ``tears'' or beads of
white sap from the bark when incisions are made. They gradually turn yellow and
harden; and after four months are harvested and distributed worldwide,
particularly for use as incense.
Myrrh was no less valued and sought-after as far back as the Egyptians, for it
possessed properties ideal for use in embalming, as well as cosmetic
applications. It is used now in folk medicine for the treatment of mouth
infections, ulcers, and for bodily stimulation against septicaemia.
The very names of frankincense and myrrh are evocative of the Christmas story,
but there is also a range of plants which, over the centuries, have become
known as the advent or manger herbs.
Costmary, also known as Our Lady's balsam, was said to have been used as a
healing ointment by Mary Magdalene, and horehound, a token of good health,
which was taken from its native North Africa, Asia and southern Europe by
emigrants and distributed throughout the world, is still a constituent in many
preparations in the treatment of respiratory infections including bronchitis,
colds and sore throats.
Our Lady's bedstraw belongs to the group of plants popular for growing in
``Mary Gardens'' which includes Our Lady's mantle, smock, garters and thimble
among others. This is said to have lined the crib.
Juniper was included for protection, sage represented life and immortality and
thyme symbolised courage, particularly in relation to the Holy Family's flight
from Egypt.
If you are looking for a festive decoration with a difference, what could be
better than several of the manger herbs fashioned into posies or wreaths which
really are appropriate to the season?

AS you read this, the loudspeakers at the Burnside Pet Hotel in Denny are
playing the Christmas tape - Jingle Bells, Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas and, possibly, Santa Paws is coming to town.
Because Santa won't forget even those poor pooches and moggies who spend the
holiday in kennels while their owners are off enjoying themselves.
``We once had someone who got a Chinese meal delivered to their dog at
Christmas,'' says owner Neil Murray. ``It was a Basset hound. And it really
liked Chinese food.''
In the true spirit of being kinder to your animals than to your children,
Britain's pets are due to receive a bumper crop of presents this year.
The big presentation stack of Special Friends Christmas stockings which
dominates the front of Alex Mair's Pet and Garden Shop in West George Street,
Glasgow, sold out in the early days of December. ``It's just been frantic this
year,'' said manager William Jenkins.
But the 99p net bags of Pedigree Chum Schmacko snacks and chocolate drop
treats, the #1.25 cardboard crackers of Crunchy Kitbits (beef and chicken) and
Tender Kibits (rabbit and turkey), not forgetting the Funball toy, are merely
the stocking fillers of the animal Christmas.
Harrods knows how to do it in style; the Knightsbridge department store
produces a Christmas list of ``Gifts for Pets'' for puzzled owners which
includes the #65 cat bed - ``cotton with fur lining in the style of the Harrods
building'' and the Harrods indoor kennel for #140. There are also jewelled dog
bowls (name your price) and, for the owner who wants to say it all, and has #9
to say it with, T-shirts (100%) with two designs: ``Wreck the Hall and Eat the
Holly'' and ``Oh Come Sit Stay All Ye Faithful''.
Visit a pet shop nowadays, and you could be forgiven for thinking you'd ended
up in a health food store. Some truly extraordinary dog treats from Hagen are
selling themselves to responsible owners this Christmas on their nutritional
content, with the ingredients for the five lurid red and yellow Doggie Gourmet
kebabs on a plate listed as protein, oil, fibre, moisture and ash. Keeping you
dog's teeth healthy, Nylabone brings you the Dental Dinosaur, ``irresistible to
dogs'' in caramel-coloured Tyrannosaurus Rex shape, ``naturally
flavour-enhanced'' and shelf-mate to the Gummabone Plaque Attacker,
Stegosaurus-shaped this time in clear yellow plastic.
A #2.99 bird stocking presents Chit Chat snacks and honey seeds in
scientific-looking foil packets, together with a tasty ``budgie sandwich'' of
honey, seeds, and wafer biscuit. Birds do well at Christmas, apparently; from
the Pet Love ``see-saw on perch with balls'' (#1.79) to the mini Hagen plastic
steam engine with space for budgie passenger (#2.39) there is a toy for every
pretty boy.
And there is, at the very least, a stocking for everyone. Altons Christmas
selection for horses (#1.99) offers Apple Horse Bix, Mint Horse Bix and
Equimints, while the #1.50 Pip net bag for rabbits and guinea pigs gives them
yoghurt and milk treat buttons, along with three different flavours of
delicious nibble sticks.
But it is the hamsters who really clean up at Christmas. Habitrail is a
remarkably popular line of low-rise hamster housing starter units which have
cornered the market in gifts for the rodent in your life. Reading the sides of
the boxes, however, induces much of the same thoughtful guilt as a browse
through an Early Learning Centre.
The #8.39 Sky Spinner, for example, a green plastic attachment which allows
your hamster to whiz round to his heart's content, is described thus:
``Delights hamsters with its orbiting motion as they scamper back and forth.
This quiet external extension offers another avenue for exploration and a
challenge to the hamster's natural agility.''
The Villa, with wheel and solarium, is ``the ideal mini home which satisfies
hamsters' needs for exercise, recreation, and exploration''.
Also in the range are the Sky Restaurant (a splendid pink revolving affair),
the Snack Bar (could be misused by malevolent young ones hoping to be
laboratory scientists, relying as it does on well-trained hamsters pressing on
the yellow dispensing bars to get their treats from the purple box) and, glory
of glories, the hamster Drag Racer, which places the beastie in a giant plastic
ball contained in a streamlined, car-shaped frame.
But don't worry, said Mair's manager William, you can set the wheel so it goes
round in a circle rather than straight out the door.
Meanwhile, back at the Burnside Pet Hotel, the tapes that keep the dogs happy
have moved on to White Christmas - ``Although I think that's more for the staff
than for the dogs,'' said owner Neil Murray.
All the dogs get diced-up turkey on Christmas Day, along with their normal
diet, and in the true spirit of Christmas, all the animals share. ``If
someone's got a wee Chihuahua and have given it a big Christmas stocking, we
ask them if they'd mind splitting it - a lot of the old age pensioners who have
to leave their animals here can't afford presents. We put all the treats into a
pool. And every dog gets a present.''

Sir Fitzroy Maclean, diplomat and historian tells LEILA FARRAH about his eating
habits
n.BREAKFAST rather depends on where I am. At home I'm apt to have a continental
breakfast of China/Indian blended tea and toast with honey or marmalade, or
sometimes an attractive roll such as a croissant. If I'm away, or about to have
a long day, it will be porridge, eggs, and bacon.
One of my principles is that I never eat between meals. At lunch, I'm quite
happy with a sandwich but if I'm at home I'll have meat and two veg - we have
our own lamb - and I do like potatoes.
I own the local hotel here, the Creggans Inn, and my wife and I take a lot of
interest in the food there. We have a lot of malt whiskies and a good cellar. I
spent two years at our embassy in Paris where I learned a lot about food, and
also in Russia where I grew very fond of Boeuf Stroganoff, blinis (pancakes)
and borscht, and smoked fish with vodka. I like zakuski (hors d'oeuvre) and
shashlik (kebabs) of all kinds. And I like to have a glass of sour cream -
smetana - with a little sugar.
When we're in Russia, my wife and I always have caviar and blinis for a first
course, then Chicken Kiev or Boeuf Stroganoff. I still think that the best food
is French although they don't have such a monopoly as they had before the war.
People here are more interested in food and that produces better results: the
intake of foreigners into the United Kingdom has also made a big difference.
I drink tea in the afternoon but rarely eat anything although I love egg
sandwiches, Christmas cake, and scones with jam - but I resist these out of
greed because I don't want to spoil my appetite for dinner.
I'm very fond of fish, particularly salmon and black (Dover) sole. If you've
got really good sole, meunire is as good a way as any of preparing it.
We're on the shores of Loch Fyne and are lucky enough to have wonderful oysters
that come straight out of the sea which is simply marvellous. The langoustines
are particularly good although we have to compete with Spanish lorries that
sweep them away with the lobster and prawns.
Favourite dishes owe much to nostalgia which is why I like nursery food,
particularly chicken and bread sauce.
I like really good, simple cooking and am very much in favour of getting what's
best locally.

n SPOKESPERSON, the Scottish Prison Service
Prisoners get up at eight instead of seven on Christmas Day and can have a
cooked breakfast. There are services in the chapel followed by recreational
activities. Lunch is standard Christmas fare with all the trimmings, then a
light tea and lock-up fairly early, 5pm instead of 7.30 or 8.o`clock so that
prison officers can get home and be with their families. There is no prison
visiting on the 25th because so many people rely on public transport but there
is extra visiting over the rest of the holiday.

What do you give the woman who has
everything? More, says John Davidson
What do you give to the woman who has everything? The absolutely fabulous
answer is quite simple. More. And here to advise you on the top ten or so
wonders of the present world this Christmas are leading fashion guru, Patsy
Stone and PR supremo, Edina Monsoon. Or a close approximation.
Their advice? As ever, "Names, names, names. . . all big designers like
Givenchy, Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent". They are the basis of an absolutely
fabulous Christmas, darling. For, when you rummage under the tree in eager
anticipation of that token of glamour and extravagance, which - let's face it,
sweetie - you've earned, nothing is quite so instantly gratifying as the glint
of a gilded logo on a really smart giftbox.
Don't those intertwined letters - Y, S, and L - send a shiver down your spine
which no amount of hollistic massage or rebirthing can match? And that double-C
monogram? Well, doesn't the word `Chanel' mean anything to you?
You could be joining the fashion pack's front-row elite. All it takes is a
little bag, shoe, belt, frock . . . anything, in fact, from Prada. But perhaps,
sweetie, you are the sort of absolutely fabulous person who would prefer the
appalling but loveable kitsch of Moschino's festive red and green felt flower
jewellery.
You might swoon over Valentino's most intimate secrets (just a black lacey bra
and matching briefs, actually). And from Chanel - well, it has to be No. 5, the
only thing which Marilyn Monroe ever wore in bed.
Just one name stands head and shoulder-pads above all others in terms of
absolute fabulousness. ``Lacroix'', Edina screams, ``Christian Lacroix!'' And
if Edina could die for his dainty knitted suit in multi-coloured boucle yarn,
one of his printed silk scarves might bring on a jolly serious throat
infection. At the very least. But, of course darling, you knew already that
Christmas shopping can seriously damage your health.

Anvar Khan looks at the colourful book which examines the history and lure of
the sari
BEAUTY Box is in receipt of a beautifully illustrated book all about the Indian
sari. I could hazard a guess as to why I alone got this tome through the post.
There's a lot to be said for combing through Press Agency cuttings, and asking
the researcher to look out for Asian surnames. But let us not be churlish.
While it is a lengthy book, if you are desperately keen on Indian culture and
history, it's worth having a wee flick through it.
India's saris evolved out of a complex environment. India is intense with human
beings, and its tens of millions of uneducated, poor, and often ignorant
inhabitants pollute the already furious soup they call life. The country's
pastures and plains have always been prone to heavy flooding with the
temperamentality of the weather. A bad storm can wreak havoc on the heart, when
lives are dependent on crops.
India acquired a common knowledge of life and art, by a continual trample of
people leaving one place to pick up skills in another, as if all the genetic
and cultural information needed to be reborn in another place was transported
via the mud on their feet.
The subcontinent's regions have deep roots. By 2000 BC, the people of the Indus
Valley were making bread from wheat, and wearing dyed cotton clothes, while a
thousand miles away, Neolithic inhabitants of present-day Bihar were growing
and eating rice, but cotton had not appeared there as a crop. The Indus valley
left one of the most significant legacies, the domestication of cotton and the
technology to dye it.
Early Islamic invasions resulted in various Muslim dynasties ruling Northern
India, culminating in the Mughal Empire (1526-1765) whose court textiles
influenced the fabrics worn by most northern and central aristocrats until the
early twentieth century. Only the poor wore saris, the upper classes created
suits from patterns, as there was the superstition among the lower castes, that
anything created using a needle could not be good. In the late eighteenth
century, Mughal political and military power was superseded by the British, who
got their paws on tribal designs. Parlour curtains all over Europe unwittingly
displayed Indian fertility symbols.
The sari is a length of cloth from about four to eight metres, and how you wear
it, how you cross it around the body, depends on which region you are from. We
won't bore you with technical details, suffice to say, that every Indian woman
toiling under a religion which equates purity with chastity, has managed to
devise a modest way of wearing the yards of see-through cotton - doubling it is
a must.
Saris are often woven by hand - there are more than three million handlooms in
India employing six million people - or by powerlooms in textile mills. Sari
production accounts for an estimated 25.5% of all textile production in India.
Handwoven saris are highly prized and most Indian women, apart from the
poorest, wear both kinds.
A woman's ethnicity and caste background influence her choice of fabric and
colour. In Northern India a widow is expected to wear white, the colour of
mourning, as bright colours are regarded as the prerogative of young, married
women, with bridal red being seen as the colour of joy, energy, and marital
bliss. Older married women are expected to wear dark blues and other jaded
tones. They do that here, too.
Women in the Indian south are less likely to cover their head with a veil, and
add garlands of fresh flowers for modesty instead, which allude rather
uncomfortably to the practice of ``de-flowering'' a woman on her wedding night.
Among tribal cultures, naivety in a woman is desirable, and virginity is best
expressed with untouched pink orchids in full bloom in the hair.

Clare Henry hears the story behind the Hutton gems
WHAT to give the lady who has everything? Take a tip from the Woolworth
heiress, millionairess Barbara Hutton. Her idea of a trinket for her secretary
was to say the least, unique. No mere box of chocolates here, but a row of
rocks, knuckleduster ring, necklace or something like the beautiful diamond and
pearl ear-clips by Van Cleef et Arpels which Edinburgh jeweller Joseph Bonnar
is currently offering for the perfect Christmas present, a snip at #15,000.
It's one of several antique pieces which come with an exciting - and true -
story attached. Barbara Hutton's secretary was Scottish and like all
conscientious, transatlantic Celts, often worked late. If Hutton was
entertaining, sometimes she would ask her to stay on, with the instructions
that she was to ``dress up''. When her secretary returned wearing small,
tasteful pearl earstuds, Hutton would reach for her massive jewel box, fling it
open and clunk on some sparkling diamonds, exclaiming, ``they look much
prettier on you, dear, so just keep them''. This was during the 1940s when
Hutton, then in her thirties, threw memorable parties at her house near Tangier
together with Cary Grant, then Prince Igor of Lithuania, just two of her seven
husbands.
When Hutton's secretary died her sister, still living in Scotland, inherited
the jewellery with no idea that these glitzy 1940s pieces were very valuable -
until she tried to insure them. Bonner also has a French flower spray brooch
and a 2.5 carat diamond and cultured pearl ring (#3950) from Hutton's
collection - together with many other special antique pieces: a Georgian seed
pearl bracelet with a miniature-set clasp, Regency cut steel earrings,
Victorian diamond tiara (which conveniently converts to a necklace and brooch),
art deco brooch by Lacloche of Paris - and much more.
So how to display such lavish opulence? Bonner hit on the bright idea of
draping young ballerinas, complete with tutus - white for diamonds; blue with
sapphires and pearls - garlanding them with rows, loops and chains of gems and
holding a special Christmas party for his clients in the luxurious Secret
Garden of the Witchery restaurant. ``It's such a beautiful, romantic setting -
but it was hard for the dancers to be on points on the stone floor.'' So why?
``Being displayed on catwalk models doesn't work for this kind of jewellery,''
explains Bonnar. ``Using the Edinburgh Theatre School's teenage students solved
the problem because they didn't conflict with the jewels.''
I had assumed that antique jewellery was timeless, but Bonnar, who has been in
business in Edinburgh's Thistle Street for nearly 25 years, tells me that the
market is not immune to fashion. ``When Lady Di appeared, before her
engagement, always wearing a classic string of graduated pearls, they instantly
revived and became the ideal gift for every 18 or 21-year-old - and still are.
Previously they were impossible to sell. Jurassic Park made for a comeback in
amber and the Australian soaps also have had an effect. All the women on them
seem to wear their grand-father's gold Albert watch chain around their neck, so
now they are fashionable too!''
Bonner has an eye for the unusual and stylish, (``I had things from the Elton
John collection -though not the Duchess of Windsor!'') and also makes
commissioned pieces. ``Jewellery is such a personal thing. It's to do with
emotions and sentiment. You have to get it right.''
Having always had a keen eye for the most expensive thing in the shop, I
immediately lusted after the art deco sapphire and diamond necklace which
converts to a brooch and                 earrings (#12,850) and a
nineteenth-century           Etruscan revival necklace designed by the
leading Italian goldsmith, Palotti.
Hutton's gems are merely some of Bonner's lavish display, a delight to the eye
if not for the cheque-book! If I win the lottery it's certainly one shop where
I could easily go wild.

CHAPTER ONE
MARK was moaning. Nobody cared about him and his tooth was agony. He simply
wished it would hurry up and fall out. Then he'd get money from the Tooth Fairy
and the pain would be over. Plus he'd be able to show off his gap to Paul. He
could really show him that he wasn't the only one with missing teeth!
Mark sighed and slumped over his toy police car. He'd had enough of the bitter
orange juice and was growing sleepy.
``Mummy, can we go home now?'' he whined, tugging silently at her skirt. Mark's
mother put down her coffee cup and stared down at the little unhappy face. She
looked sympathetic but simply smiled and murmured: ``Not now darling. Hang on a
minute and we'll go soon. You're being very patient.''
Mark stared open-mouthed. He couldn't tolerate any more of this drag. His mum
was obviously enjoying herself, however. She'd had an enjoyable Christmas shop
with her friend Helen, and now she was stopping off for a coffee. Everything
was very busy. It seemed to Mark as if the whole wide world was out last-minute
shopping for Christmas Day tomorrow and the little cafe seemed very popular,
although he simply couldn't understand how they could bear the overpowering
smell of black coffee wafting in from the kitchen.
Mark stared bleary-eyed into the dark High Street but turned away quickly when
he caught sight of the bright Christmas lights which made his eyes sore.
Absent-mindedly he reached his hand into his mother's handbag, pulled out a
toffee, unwrapped it, popped it into his mouth and CRACK! that's when it
happened - his first-ever tooth fell out of his mouth and on to the napkin laid
out at his place. Mark simply couldn't believe it! The tooth that had given him
so much pain had finally fallen out!
``Yesss!'' he gasped aloud, brushing his police car out of the way to examine
the precious tooth lying so still in a tiny pool of blood. This made him
somewhat worried but, after consulting his mum, he found out it was perfectly
natural and held back his approaching tears. For the first time in this long,
boring day he began to smile and he thought about the next day that was going
to be so exciting!
Christmas was coming!
CHAPTER TWO
``We're back,'' shouted Mark's mum as she shut the heavy wooden door leading
into the Howards' house.
Mark's dad, who was preparing some presents of his own upstairs, murmured
something before thumping down the stairs to say hello properly. Mark wandered
in to the kitchen and sat by the fire. He was very happy. He just loved the
atmosphere of the farmhouse-type kitchen with the simple wooden table and the
roaring fire. Of course he was too young to know exactly what it was he liked
about the kitchen, but he knew he liked the feeling when he sat near the fire.
He loved the warmth and the comfort of it and now that his tooth was out, he
enjoyed it even more!
As he whizzed his beloved police car up and down the rug, he heard his mum
telling his dad about how their son's tooth fell out in the cafe. Mark grinned
to himself. It was Christmas tomorrow (and he couldn't wait for that!) and as
well as everything else, the Tooth Fairy was coming tonight as well as Santa! .
. . The Tooth Fairy was coming as well as Santa?! That's when the thought
struck him. They'd both be in his room for different reasons, but they could
well be there at the same time. What if Santa and the Tooth Fairy met up?
CHAPTER THREE
Mark just could not sleep that night. His heart was pumping hard in his chest.
He was even more nervous and excited than he normally was on Christmas Eve and
his eyes simply refused to close. He decided to try a trick that his mum had
taught him two years ago when he was four - counting sheep.
Yes, he tried that but it didn't work and he stayed wide awake until after
midnight, much to his mum's disgust.
MEANWHILE, in a land far away, Santa was setting off for a long night's work in
his colourful sleigh. His elves were tired, but had to keep working, loading
all the many toys on to the sleigh - computers, books, bikes, hi-fi systems,
teddies, rollerblades and tons and tons of knick-knacks, so popular with the
children.
Pixpax, one of the less-intelligent elves, was joking around. ``Hey, Leps!
Careful with that bike!'' he yelled, taking it easy on a stool. ``That was the
end result of a hard shop at John Lewis, heh heh!''
Santa, big, fat, chubby, jolly Santa walked on to the scene, for once looking
rather annoyed.
``Pixpax,'' he began, ``I'd like to remind you that my name is Mr Santa Claus
and you must try and take orders from me. I know all this is hard work, but I'm
sure you'll agree that it's most definitely worth it to see a smile on every
child's face. And Pixpax, I don't care if that bike was the result of a lazy
shop at John Lewis or, as it should be, a week of hard constructive work, Leps
was handling it perfectly and it's simply not up to you to order him around
when you're slacking off yourself! Now get back to work!''
``Oooh, Santa, who's getting angry now?'' Pixpax murmured scornfully to
himself, but old Santa, with perfect hearing, turned around and shot Pixpax an
ice cold glare, leaving him feeling rather humbled and obliged to try his
hardest once more.
Fifteen minutes later, all the hundreds of presents were loaded on the giant
red sleigh and the reindeer perfectly positioned in order - Rudolf, of course,
at the front.
Now, just between you and me, Rudolf got his name because he is in fact
incredibly rude! This is, of course, why he's at the front - because he's so
amazingly pushy and won't let anyone else in! He just has to be the leader,
although, of course, if Santa was given any say in it - he could go!
Anyway, as I was saying, when everything was ready, it was time to go! Santa
was back to his old jolly self, having quickly recovered from the Pixpax
incident, and he was positively raring to go. Another thing that night, which
added to his jolliness, was his new super jet-powered engine in the sleigh to
give his reindeer a hand. After the successful test drive a week ago, Santa
loved it and couldn't wait to try it out properly. And now was the time! As
Santa gave a shout, the reindeer gave a huge leap and after starting the
jet-powered engine, there was no stopping them! They were off at exactly 225mph
on the speedometer
The pack of 20 elves watched as the sleigh pulled away and Santa shouted with
pleasure as they pulled off into the cold and drizzly - but, in a way,
refreshing - night.
CHAPTER FOUR
Although all this was happening there was, of course, space and time for more
action. In another land far away called Dentagumtoothland, where the Tooth
Fairy lives, there was plenty happening!
Sally Rose Ishbel Daphne Serendipity Betty Dentagum - otherwise known as the
Tooth Fairy - was rushing around like a mad thing. ``Lizzie dear, have you seen
my golden sequinned evening gloves? I've had an unexpected call from a little
boy called Mark and it's essential that I look my best.''
Lizzie Toothbrush, Sally Dentagum's official maid, looked up startled.
``A call? On Christmas Eve? How unusual . . . Remember in that survey we
conducted last year, December 24 was the most uncommon day for calls . . . ?''
``Yes, my dear, but as I'm sure you'll agree, we can't let this poor boy, Mark,
down. It would be a disgrace on our part. I must get myself up and about but I
just can't find these gloves . . . ''
``Let me assist you, Miss Dentagum,'' smiled Lizzie, beginning to look around
Sally Dentagum's General Purposes Chamber where most of her numerous belongings
ended up. She wandered over to a wooden treasure chest where mostly jewellery
was stored, heaved the heavy lid open and there they were! Sally Dentagum's
gold sequinned evening gloves!
``Why, here they are!'' cried Lizzie, taking Miss Dentagum's arm and leading
her to the chest.
``Oh thank you, thank you!'' came the cry from inside the chest as Miss
Dentagum brought her gloves out holding them daintily by the smooth white
buttons made from teeth.
``Do you know, Lizzie,'' Miss Dentagum announced, bringing her small blonde
head out of the chest and adjusting the pearly white tooth tiara, ``I'd really
be a lost cause without your assistance!''
Lizzie simply smiled for she knew only too well that that was perfectly true!
TWENTY minutes later, Miss Dentagum had finally achieved the flashy look she
was after and was ready to go. But there was one last thing to do - insert the
megajets into her shoe heels so that flying became easier and then once that
chore had been completed, it was action time! Off she flew into the dark night,
leaving Lizzie and the other servants, maids and helpers far behind.
CHAPTER FIVE
It had started to snow in Mark's home town of Bemburgh and as Santa's sleigh
pulled up on the roof, Santa felt thankful that there was a cover over the
hundreds of interesting gifts.
Santa arrived on the roof and quietly turned off the super jet-powered engine
before anything drastic happened. Rudolf was being his usual rude self and
protesting about having to stop so much but Santa, being jolly old Santa,
refused to take any notice and proceeded to cram his large frame down the
chimney of the white 1930s house.
Conveniently enough, the fireplace he came out of was in Mark's own room. Santa
quickly shook the snow off his large red coat and looked around him. Mark's
room was painted pale yellow and all over the walls were many different
posters: a poster advertising Pingu, Thomas the Tank Engine, a footballer, a
rugby player, a judo team poster, a poster showing the inside of an aeroplane,
a puppy poster and, bang right in the middle, was a large police car poster
torn out of a newspaper article. Santa smiled. He really loved young people and
was curious about their hobbies and interests.
Just as he was about to fill up the stocking hanging empty and limp on Mark's
bedpost with all the goodies little Mark had asked for, he heard a noise! A
kind of grating noise as if someone was hauling a hammer over a stone surface!
It all seemed very near and Santa, usually rather courageous, felt a lump in
his throat! Nervously, he turned round, his black beady eyes searching the
room. And then they fell on the window. A young woman, who seemed about 25 or
30, was climbing in! She had long, wispy blonde hair and a strange white tiara
on her head. Her eyes were deep blue and her lips bright red and pouty. Santa
thought she was very pretty, but was determined to know why she was climbing in
the window! Slowly he approached her and spoke.
``Er . . . yes, hello,'' he began, ``I was really . . . I mean, I really wasn't
expecting company tonight. Don't take it the wrong way, you don't need to go. I
just, well . . . I thought it rather strange for someone dressed in a pearly
white tiara and evening gloves to come climbing in this window!''
The young woman smiled. ``There's no need to worry. I'm the Tooth Fairy, you
see, and this young fellow lost a tooth this evening. And . . . well, you must
be Santa?''
``Yes, that's right. I suppose everybody knows who I am. Obviously I'm here to
fill Mark's stocking with all the goodies he asked for. I like seeing children
happy. It fills me with a kind of joy, I suppose you could say. I love the
sound of a child's laughter.''
``Yes, so do I,'' started Miss Dentagum, ``which is why I do what I'm doing
tonight. Children like money - which is perfectly natural because it gives them
so many opportunities and so I feel that giving it in exchange for teeth is a
great system! It makes me happy because of my obsession for old milk teeth -
and it makes them happy because they receive a little money!''
Santa smiled and stared at Miss Dentagum as if in some trance. Moments after he
realised and quickly shook himself out of it. After excusing himself to fill
the stocking, and then chatting (although slightly awkwardly) to Miss Dentagum
for a few more minutes over the mince pies and sherry left by Mark, Santa
realised just how much he enjoyed Miss Dentagum's company and how much he would
like to spend the rest of his days with her! But how could he ask? It's a very
difficult thing to do when you're over twice the woman's age and have a duty
like being Santa!
But, on the other hand, if he didn't ask he would never stand a chance and this
could be the last of Miss Dentagum in his life! So, crazy as it might be - he
asked. (Don't think it was as easy as I have just made out there - no way! On
the contrary, it was by far the most difficult thing Santa's ever had to do!
But it paid off because . . . she said YES!!!).
CHAPTER SIX
It wasn't easy for either of them - as I've just said it was very hard for poor
old Santa to ask and probably even harder for Miss Dentagum to decide on an
answer! But after realising they had so much in common, they both knew it was
the right thing to do and to compromise on where they would live, they decided
to bring both their kingdoms together as one and - guess what? - they called it
Marksland as it was little Mark who brought them together! He was even invited
to the official wedding ceremony in Marksland and to this day he still keeps in
touch with this charming couple - Miss Dentagum, now Mrs Claus, and, of course,
Santa.
Eighteen years later and Mark is a                      professional matchmaker!
THE END
It's a fulfilling life for Father Christmas handing
out largesse to the world's children, but it can be lonely. But when young Mark
conjured up a young blonde . . .

Lady Claire Macdonald prepares for
a hassle-free day of festive celebrations
THE day after tomorrow is Christmas Day. I hope that you feel full of joy, and
are not too fraught with the arrival of family and friends to share this most
wonderful festival with you.
Two weeks ago I told you how I make and freeze the stuffings for turkey, and
also the bread sauce. If you, too, have turkey for your Christmas celebration
meal, whether at lunchtime or in the evening, I do hope that you have your
stuffings out of the freezer and thawing.
Select a volunteer to peel the potatoes and trim the brussels sprouts. The
potatoes will be perfectly fine peeled today and kept in a bowl or saucepan of
cold water, providing that the water is changed tomorrow.
My idea of a good Christmas Day does not include peeling potatoes, besides
which I think that to a great extent potatoes taste of the fat they are roasted
in. The giblet stock for the gravy to accompany the turkey can be made today.
Put the giblets from inside the turkey into a saucepan. Put in as many pints of
cold water as you will need, depending on your guest numbers. Add two or three
onions, cut in half, a couple of stalks of celery, a leek or two, a handful of
peppercorns and two teaspoons of rock salt. Cover the pan with its lid and
bring the water to a rolling boil. Turn the heat down so that the liquid
simmers very gently and cook for 2-3 hours.
If you have an Aga or a Raeburn, cook the giblet stock inside a cool oven.
Strain, and when the stock is quite cold store in the fridge in a covered
container. Providing you do this, there is no need to reboil the stock
tomorrow, Christmas Eve. It will have a good boil when the gravy is made.
I have always felt that a first course is quite unnecessary before a
traditional Christmas lunch or dinner. I could never manage to get a Christmas
lunch ready, and besides that I would feel completely comatose following such a
lunch. Whereas in the evening, with curtains drawn and candles lit, and until
this year a strangely leisurely day to enjoy, with talk around the fire, with
chilly walks, and with, at some point, sticking the bird in the oven to cook
and the pudding on to steam, the dinner is the high point of the day.
I have said until this year because for us here in Skye who are Roman Catholic,
as we are, because our priest lives on the mainland our Christmas Day mass has
always taken place on Christmas Eve - there being no ferries on Christmas Day.
Now with the bridge to Skye open I suppose we will have the opportunity to go
to mass on Christmas Day in Dornie, the church on the mainland. Times change!
Now all that remains is for me to wish you all a very happy, peaceful and
joyous Christmas, and to leave you with a recipe for leftover turkey, a recipe
for a turkey fricassee, a much maligned dish which, when properly made is
utterly delicious.
TURKEY FRICASSEE
n Serves 6-8.
About 3 tablespoons dripping saved from the turkey.
2 onions, skinned and finely chopped
1 clove of garlic, skinned and chopped - optional
2 leeks, washed and trimmed and sliced thinly
4-6 rashers of back bacon, smoked or unsmoked, sliced thinly
2 teaspoons medium curry powder
2 tablespoons flour - fairly level tablespoons
1!s pints milk, or the jelly from under the dripping and milk combined
Salt, freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons raisins - optional, but very good
1!s-2lbs leftover cut-up turkey meat
n Melt dripping in a large saucepan and cook onions till soft and turning
golden. Add garlic and leeks, and bacon and continue to cook till leeks are
soft. Stir in curry powder and flour, continue to cook for a minute before
gradually adding the milk, stirring continuously till the sauce boils. Stir in
the jelly if you are using it. Add raisins, salt and pepper. Not more than 10
minutes before reheating the sauce to serve, add the cut-up turkey and simmer
very gently in the sauce. If you like you can stir a couple of tablespoons of
finely chopped parsley through the fricassee before serving. Serve with either
baked jacket potatoes or boiled basmati nice.

Looking to the heavens, John Linklater is inspired
by the miraculous nature of the host
Ezekiel saw them as frightening beasts but Raphael found it politic to portray
them           as rose-cheeked innocents. What is the inside track on the
heavenly host?
PATIENT cherubs is what it says on the back of the Christmas card I'm brooding
over. This is the caption title. You've seen them before a hundred times, this
pair: on cards, on calendars, soap adverts, labels, baubles, bangles, tattoos,
album sleeves, diaries, key-rings, ties, aprons, oven mitts, on watch dials,
alarm clocks, scrapbooks, jigsaws, CD Roms, underpants, flags, carrier bags,
and all the other rags, tags, and jingling bobtails that threaten to gift-wrap
you out of your senses at this vicious time of the year.
God love them. Two little faces above what looks as if it is the edge of the
paddling-pool, or the sweetie counter, or the chemist's dispensary waiting to
steal something to turn their innocent little minds savage, but you're not
allowed to think that because this image of Patient Cherubs belongs to the
realm of saccharine sanctimony, and the clouds behind them, the three moth
wings they share between them like a vehicle with a lost hubcap, the fact they
are naked in the bath but nobody is going to bring charges, alert you to be on
your best behaviour because they are two sweet little angels.
Except that they look suspiciously like pudgy middle-aged men wearing sandy
wigs. It could be Nigel Lawson and Arthur Scargill at the sauna, plotting their
relaunch as a comedy duo. The one on the left has a fat hand over his face, one
ringless finger sealing petted lips, and his curiously bicepped arm seems to
have shrugged off the missing wing. He has evidently been working for years as
a circus midget, coveting the high-wire girls.
The one on the right has his flabby arms crossed, and although he is also
gazing upwards with appalling smugness, it is with a different focus. They are
not actually looking at the same thing. Which makes them doubly dangerous.
They're covering all the angles, these streetwise angels, waiting for their
chance. I'd watch them if I were you. Loitering With Intent, is the title that
might have been used.
What they are supposed to be looking at, gazing adoringly upwards, is the child
Christ in the arms of his vacant-expressioned mother, attended by a couple of
groupie saints, Sixtus and Barbara. You think our little angels are the full
picture? They are just a detail from Raphael's Sistine Madonna. They are at the
bottom of a nine-foot canvas, the artist's marginalia, a footnote, a supporting
act. This explains the expression of sickened envy on their sagging faces,
sheer glum dejection.
The legend goes that Raphael was working on this commission in 1512 for the
Church of San Sisto in Piacenza when two little boys climbed up to one of the
windows of his studio and gazed at him as he worked. This is unlikely. Children
of that age don't gaze in passive admiration. They want a shot.
I remember seeing this painting for the first time in Dresden, at the
Gemldegalerie earlier this year, and being struck by how malcontented these
two actually appear when you confront them face to face. You meet them at eye
level, though their eyes wander upwards in mock reverence. That they are
studiously ignoring the supernatural babe Christ is evident. He is some
distance behind them in the arms of Mary.
She, like the two precarious saints, each on either side, has found an
improbable foothold among banks of clouds that, if studied closely, reveal
angel faces. They are like forms coming through a big effect of dried ice, an
impression amplified by the theatrical curtains that frame the painting. Either
way, and disconsolately unimpressed, the two cherubs are staring into space.
In which posture they have been unaccountably admired, indulged, and feted for
centuries. It is not that I don't appreciate them. After all, superior art
critics, and tastes more delicately refined than my own, have claimed a
perfection for Raphael's painting unrivalled by any other in the history of
art. No accounting for that claim. My objection to these cherubs, in common
with most Christmassy angels, is that they are a complete commercial fraud.
No doctrine has ever suggested that cherubim, the second-highest order of the
heavenly hierarchy, looked like tubby babies with wings. On the contrary, they
were awesome creatures of the Ever Turning Sword, guardians of the Tree of Life
(according to Genesis). Theodorus speaks of cherubim as ``beasts which might
terrify Adam from the entrance of Paradise''. Ezekiel in 1:4 gives one of the
Bible's most graphic accounts of cherubim. There was a tempestuous wind coming
from the north, Ezekiel says. It made a great cloud mass and a quivering fire,
with brightness all around like electrum. In the middle there were four
creatures. Each had four faces and four wings. They were gleaming like copper
and the soles of their feet were like calves' hooves. Their faces were quarter
human, quarter lion, quarter bull, and quarter eagle. Their appearance was
``like burning coals of fire''.
Paint that, maestro.
Since the Middle Ages popular culture has been swept by angel fever. Their
bright squadrons, choirs, and bands have excited more piety than the
evangelists. By the fourteenth century the kabbalists put their angel count at
precisely 301,655,722 of whom a regrettable 133,306,688 had fallen. Odd, then,
that so few ever got a name. After Archangels Michael and Gabriel most
struggle. Lucifer is probably the third-best-known angel, thanks largely to
Dante and Milton who gave Hell's Angels all the best lines.
The ambiguity of angels has always presented a problem. That a High Renaissance
painter such as Raphael should hesitate over the depiction of Ezekiel's
frightening beasts is not surprising. He found it politic to provide his
patrons with a pair of harmless innocents, two cherub babies to harmonise with
the infant Christ. This is just an early stage in what has been a continuing
and unceasing industry to provide us with packaged angels.
Angels are a fraud, yet we go along with them because they represent brilliant
marketing. Few actually believe in their presence. It is as purely spiritual
beings that they are upheld in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologies.
Calvinists dwell morbidly on bad angels while the Catholic Church has adopted
the position of Thomas Aquinas that angels are pure intellect and therefore
without physical form. This is confirmed by science. The Marxist geneticist J B
S Haldane calculated that in order to propel themselves by means of their
wings, angels would require breast muscles projecting four feet and legs
reduced to the slenderness of stilts. G K Chesterton's article of faith on
angels was as elegant as it was singular. He said angels could fly because they
took themselves lightly.
Certainly, we take them lightly, as well. They give their names to confections
from angel cakes to Angel Delight, or to delicacies such as angels on
horseback, oysters wrapped in bacon. An angel in the fifteenth century was a
coin worth 10 shillings (a mere 10-bob note, a 50-pence piece, for a guardian
of the throne of glory!), and an angel today is any member of the nursing
profession, after the 1976 BBC television soap. Or an angel is an Edinburgh
Festival award made by this newspaper, after Charles Wesley's Hark! The Herald
Angels Sing. The most likely place to find a recording angel today is wherever
they pick up their royalties.
It has been estimated that angels feature in the lyrics of one pop song out of
every 10. Angels want to wear the songwriter's red shoes (Elvis Costello). Or
they are playing with their heart (Eurythmics). They are of the morning (P P
Arnold). They step out of heaven (George Jones). They don't lie (Jim Reeves).
They are grievous (Gram Parsons) or special (Bobby Helms) or blue (J Geils
Band). It is their eyes that identify them as angels (Roxy Music) or their face
(Glitter Band) or their fingers (Wizzard). Sometimes they are just Angel
(Aretha Franklin/Rod Stewart/Carolyn Franklin).
If Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney can play angels on screen, albeit with
dirty faces, then there must be hope for us all. Cary Grant (The Bishop's
Wife), James Mason (Forever Darling), Warren Beatty (Heaven Can Wait), Claude
Rains (Here Comes Mr Jordan), Jack Benny (The Horn Blows at Midnight), Peter
Falk (Wings of Desire), Harry Belafonte (The Angel Levine), and Robert Cummings
(Heaven Only Knows) continue Hollywood's male slant on a species of heavenly
being that was supposed to be considered androgynous.
Jeanette MacDonald (I Married an Angel) provided an exception, but most of
these screen angels are whimsical and fey, culminating in everyone's favourite,
Clarence Oddbody, Angel Second Class, played by Henry Travers in It's a
Wonderful Life.
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings
in that 1946 film directed by Frank Capra, and Clarence's mission is to gain
promotion by saving James Stewart from suicide. It might be what James Agee
called the ``most efficient sentimental piece since A Christmas Carol'', but it
is accurate about at least one aspect of The Ministry Of Angels, its sheer
bureaucracy.
There are more grades of angels than in the Civil Service, and doubtless more
increments in the wages of virtue and sin.
Yet all authorities are agreed that elderly Clarence really was on the very
bottom rung. The retirement age of angels is unclear, though, they are never
depicted as veteran as Clarence, so he has a lot of catching up to do to rescue
his career. Gaining his wings would be a start. He could aim for Archangel
status, and climb up through the ranks to Principalities before trying to get a
transfer into the next triad of Powers, Virtues, and Dominions.
It is tragic that the rising career of a hard-working angel, against a
difficult contraflow of falling brethren, should be confronted at the top by
the realisation that he cannot go any further because he is no longer a baby.
Blame Raphael for the injustice. He might not have invented fat infant cherubs,
but he made sure they went into the repertoire of every painter of religious
scenes from Rubens and Van Dyck, with their beer-belly cherubs sporting thighs
like rugby prop-forwards, to photographer Joyce Tenneson's babyworld angels
viewed through a gauze lens .
Rarely have these excesses of artistic licence met with protest. The
nineteenth-century French realist Gustave Courbet was one of the few. He could
not abide Manet's idealised angels, and commented: ``So you have seen angels,
then, and know that they have backsides?'' Maybe someone should have put that
to Raphael.

THE HOLY LAND
David Campbell
Everyman Guides, #20
IN one way, but one way only, Palestine and the Land of Israel offer the
guidebook editor a relatively simple task. The Holy Land covers less than half
the area of Scotland.
Scenically and architecturally, it is probably rather less interesting. But in
every other way the country is the supreme challenge for the guidebook.
Secular, sacred, and scholarly interests overlap, as holidays and pilgrimages
have always done. Politics intrude, as they always did. And no-one's approach
to the Holy Land and experience of it can be quite the same as anyone else's.
Jerusalem and Galilee are not just marked on the map but in private worlds of
faith and doubt.
The editor of the guidebook, Catherine Foure, describes the country as one
which looks small from outside and yet seems ``so vast from within''. As she
says, writing about dubious holy places of the Land (some so tawdry, some so
touching), it reflects ``an encounter between a God in search of humanity and
pilgrims in search of their God''.
Even if our reflections about revelation were not so often distracted by
politics - and there is a Messianic quality even to secular Zionism - it would
be hard to meet the needs of people who care about the Land in such different
ways. A modern guidebook to the Holy Land cannot avoid the fervour of Zionism
which, more than anything else, has given a sharpness and bitterness distinct
from the wider sense of Arab identity. Such a guide, unless it excludes much of
its potential market, has also to attempt an ecumenical and inter-faith
approach involving tortuous paths and sitting on uncomfortable fences.
No country offers such difficulties in preparing a guide for ``Everyman''. But
the daunting series title may, quite inadvertently, mislead older British
readers, especially as the publishers use the old Everyman's Library quotation:
``Everyman I will go with thee, and be thy guide''. The book's virtues aren't
those of simplicity and clarity.
The ``numerous specialists and academics contributing'', as well as the
editorial team, seem mainly French. The text looks a translation, with British
typesetting (less than perfectly proof-read), some American spelling, and
Italian printing. Some historical emphases and interpretations have a
distinctly French flavour. There is a friendly but slightly patronising
reference to the Scots church in Jerusalem - ``admirably'' sober - and
inadequate mention of the Garden Tomb and the historic Anglican Christ Church
(originally a cathedral) near the Jaffa Gate.
More important, traditional Everyman virtues of simplicity in typography and
book-design are absent in this mini-encyclopaedia of the Holy Land, ancient and
modern.
It is a vast Aladdin's cave of a book, stored with treasures mixed with
bric--brac, that divert attention from each other, and make it hard for the
reader to concentrate, especially in the practical information section where
four columns are squeezed into each page of an elongated pocket format.
There are 2000 illustrations in all shapes, sizes, and permutations of layout -
the result of diligent and ingenious research as well as enthusiasm for
attempting everything made possible by modern colour printing. But is this the
right balance for a book of this quality? As in many high-class modern
guidebooks and even encyclopaedias, pictures usurp the primacy of facts and
text.
The book's considerable achievement doesn't always match its ambition or
potential. The maps hardly stand comparison with those in the best traditional
guidebooks. This weakness applies to most modern guides - compare current
Baedekers with those of 1910 - and usually involves lack of detail and
insufficient clarity. Anyone tracing the decline of cartography should compare
the adequate picture map of Jaffa provided here with the quality of maps in an
earlier French achievement, the ultra-Catholic Holy Land guide of Father
Barnabas Meistermann. And cartographers who omit Jaffa from Holy Land maps
(treating it as incorporated in the sprawl of Tel Aviv) lack a sense of history.
Fortunately this sense of history and continuity is evident in other parts of
the book, both narrative and pictorial. There is a valuable anthology of
extracts from earlier pilgrims and travellers, though the greatest success of
the book is probably in the publisher's claim to provide ``an art book in
miniature'' as well as a guide.
The book also offers, as far as is humanly possible, the practical information
which visitors need for such a complex small country as the Holy Land. There is
much necessary detail here. But this is an ancient country in which many things
noted in guidebooks go out of date very quickly. That will become even more
evident as Palestinian self-government progresses in the West Bank, with
tensions over East Jerusalem and very different attitudes to Western pilgrimage
and tourism among the Arabs of Bethlehem and those of Hebron or Nablus.

IT HAD been a bad year for Britain's movie industry. Twelve Oscar nominations -
including illustrious names like Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, and Daniel
Day-Lewis - and what did we end up with? Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Unless, of
course, you counted Nick Park. ``Nick who?'' we asked as one.
Well, it was 1994 and, at the time, we could all be forgiven for being
blissfully unaware of the name (even though it was, amazingly, his second
Academy Award). No excuses now, mind you. Now he's famous. Almost as famous, in
fact, as the 6-inch plasticine figures he created. Suddenly it seems that
Christmas television isn't Christmas television without his wonderfully odd
couple, Wallace And Gromit.
Right now Hollywood executives, cheque-books in hand, are beating a path to the
door of this supremely talented animator's Bristol studio with lucrative offers
for a full-length feature film. But, under these circumstances, Park's
unassuming nature and self-effacing modesty makes him, not his own worst enemy,
but his own best friend. Figures of #30m have apparently been mentioned, but he
steadfastly refuses to entertain Tinseltown's seductive overtures.
A wise move because Wallace, the quirky inventor who always looks on the bright
side, and his sardonic wuffless dog Gromit, would not travel at all well across
the Atlantic. They're so quintessentially ``oop North'' English. Like Park
himself.
He's Preston born and bred - and therein lies the secret of his characters'
success. The inspiration for his animated films, which owe more to the Ealing
comedies of the forties and fifties than they do to the saccharine and schmaltz
of Disney, is drawn from his own childhood memories. A Lancashire hotpot of
old-fashioned humour, quaint custom, and quirky circumstance.
He has shrewdly touched a nerve in all of us, young and old. Wallace and Gromit
cross the barriers of class, intellect, and generation. They are of universal
appeal. A funny- bone is a funny-bone no matter whose arm it's connected to.
Park's interest in film is inherited from his father, an architectural
photographer. When junior was 11, his old man bought a cine-camera for family
use. The inventive son used it to bring his cartoons to life. After art school
in Sheffield, he enrolled in the National Film and Television School where he
worked on his first professional animation - A Grand Day Out in which a man and
his dog attempted to reach the moon. For the characters he went back to some
scribbled drawings he'd made years before when he was trying to write a
children's book about a cat and a postman. The postie, who bore a striking
resemblance to his father, became Wallace and the cat turned into a dog.
Wallace and Gromit were born.
It cost just #12,000 and it was supposed to be his graduation film but, since
it took six years to make, Park had left the school a long time before it was
finished. The Bristol-based animation production house, Aardrman Films, took
him on to make television ads (and allowed him to finish his film during his
spare time). At the same time, Park started working on a second and slightly
shorter film, Creature Comforts, in which animated plasticine animals lip-sinc
with real-people conversations.
Both films were completed in 1989 and, much to their creator's surprise, both
were nominated for Academy Awards. In the end, it was Creature Comforts which
gained the Oscar while A Grand Day Out earned itself a BAFTA. The success
afforded Park the luxury of being able to
write his own cheque (from the BBC) for Wallace and Gromit's next outing. The
Wrong Trousers was a 30-minute film, made on a budget of #600,000. To date it
has won no less than 30 international awards - including Park's second Oscar.
Indeed, it is arguably the most  successful British animated film of all time.
Park's latest offering, A Close Shave, which will be screened on BBC2 on
Christmas Eve, is his most ambitious to date. It cost #1.3m (sounds a lot but,
in animation terms, it's still peanuts) and has been made at the Bristol
studios by a team of more than 50. Park himself deliberately stood back from
the animation work, preferring instead to direct the project.
He explains: ``Like most animators I'd developed a very individual approach
over the years but that's gradually changed. It's not easy because the Wallace
and Gromit thing has evolved in a very personal style which I have had to
`give' to other people. I give them direction and guidance about what I want,
which I find difficult because I'm not an extrovert.
``Still, I suppose working this way has dragged me out of my shell a bit.''
When it came to editing A Close Shave, the team was forced to make some
difficult decisions. ``About five minutes of animation had to be left out,
which was very painful.
``It's very hard to look at a sequence dispassionately and not think about who
animated, how long it took them, and what difficulties they had. But I hate
making decisions on the studio floor so I'm always asking for things to be shot
a bit longer so there's leeway to edit,'' he said.
The smart money is now on Park developing his gruesome twosome into a
feature-length movie but the man himself is worried that, in doing so, his
quirky vision could get lost along the way. But, despite the interest from
America, he's determined that it won't be made in Hollywood.
``Actually, I think the Americans realise, as much as we do, that there's
something very important about being based here. There's a certain sort of
British humour and way of looking at life that we'd risk losing if we went over
there.
``But there's been a lot of interest from Hollywood and I think what's really
caught their attention is the story aspect of our films. That's always been the
weakness of British animation, but the way we develop our scripts seems to work
very well,'' he added.
n A Close Shave will be shown on BBC2 on Christmas Eve. The Wrong Trousers and
A Grand Day Out can also be seen on BBC2, with Creature Comforts shown on
Channel 4, all later in the festive period.

THE first feeling inspired by the grandly named ``social summit'' organised on
Thursday by French Prime Minister Alain Juppe with nine government ministers,
the representatives of five trade unions, and three employers' organisations,
is one of unreality.
The meeting, which began at the odd time of 3pm and went on for nine hours, was
called by the government as a grand gesture to end the month-long public
transport strike and appease public opinion. The unrest had been caused by
government plans to reform the welfare system, French railways, and public
sector pension schemes.
All that emerged from Thursday's long debates, however, was talk of economics,
not social measures. Welfare reform was not even on the agenda. The leader of
the communist-led CGT union, Lewis Viannet, summed up his disappointment with
the popular saying: ``The mountain has given birth to a mouse.''
During that first long afternoon of talks, the prime minister (whose close
advisers had spent four days agonising over what they could put forward to
appease the unions) promised to create 250,000 jobs for young people by the end
of next year. Juppe stressed the importance of ``relauching the economy''
which, stagnant even before the strikes, has been gravely damaged by a month's
transport stoppages.
The prime minister virtually admitted the failure of his earlier plans to
reduce unemployment by announcing that a major question was the reduction of
the working week, currently 39 hours.
News that emerged on Friday morning was even more curious. The government had
suggested modifying stock exchange related savings schemes in order to free
capital and boost spending. Those who would benefit from such measures are the
more comfortably off among the middle classes - not those who took to the
streets.
Here, it seemed, were two groups of people belonging to the same society,
talking a different language and adopting radically different approaches to a
problem - underlining, in fact, the very rift between the excessively educated
governing elite and those whom it governs, which President Chirac had promised
to heal.
For a month, thousands had gone on strike and up to two million people had
demonstrated, regularly and noisily in the streets of French towns, their anger
sparked by the government's wide-ranging package of reforms, presented without
a word of consultation. Now, instead of listening to those demands, Juppe is
trying to calm them down by changing the topic of conversation.
The chaos of recent weeks has been compared to that caused by the student riots
and general strike of May 1968 which almost forced General de Gaulle from
power. Last week's Social Summit, which is to be followed by more talks over a
period of six months, was redolent of the Estates General called by King Louis
XVI, which effectively got the French Revolution underway.
The lid on any number of social problems is being lifted in a similar and
confusing way today. Highly unpopular, Juppe is struggling to regain control of
the situation and his esteem in the country. Yet the government is putting
problems on the table - relaunching growth, reducing the working week, job
creation for young people - which concerned private industry far more than the
public sector, whose workers have been on strike.
Neither management associations nor the more hardline of the trade unions were
even keen on the agenda of Thursday's meeting, the details of which the prime
minister kept secret until talks began, as if trying to stage manage a
particularly difficult party trick. Only the centre-left union CFDT, whose
leadership agrees with many of Juppe's welfare reforms, is interested in the
reduction of working hours, a measure never mentioned previously as part of
this government's programme.
The CFDT, whose leader Nicole Notat was attacked during the strikes because of
his sympathy with the government's reforms, is now determined to push for the
reduction in the working week. Madame Notat will ask the government to oblige
firms to offer half their jobs to people under the age of 25. Her union also
wants to revise an agreement signed in September by having pre-retirement age
lowered to 57 when it means leaving a job free.
Reactions yesterday to the social summit from opposition parties, who had held
back from comment during the strikes apparently frightened of political
involvement, was negative.
``This summit will not put an end to mobilsiation. If the government thinks the
purpose of this meeting is to bury problems, they're making a big mistake. The
backlash will be painful next year,'' Communist Party leader Robert Hue said.

THEY are the most famous lugs in the universe, if not the world. No, they don't
adorn a Windsor but that enigmatic Vulcan, Mr Spock. Only the most earthbound
readers will be unfamiliar with Spock (not to be confused with the
paediatrician) who boldly went with Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise
where no man, or indeed Vulcan, had been before.
His alter ego is the American actor Leonard Nimoy who in the seventies
alienated fans by publishing a memoir I Am Not Spock. He has now repented and
decided that he is.
Nimoy analyses this symbiotic relationship with the aid of imaginary dialogues
with the Vulcan - whose logical thought processes as well as solemn voice he
mimics exactly. Of much interest to Trekkies will be Nimoy's description of the
beginnings and evolution of the Star Trek TV series and subsequent films. Not
surprisingly, there was a great deal of creative tension behind the scenes -
not to mention rivalry among the actors. William Shatner (Kirk) of the melting
smile and expanding waistline is evidently an irrepressible joker.
Though there's too much talk of agents and backstage negotiations, Nimoy's
intelligence shines through. So does his awareness of the ethical and
humanistic imperatives, which - as well as flights of imagination - have made
Star Trek such an admirable entertainment for the age. (I Am Spock, four
cassettes, Random House, #13.80).
Patrick Moore fires people's curiosity about the real universe through his TV
programme The Sky at Night. Now he offers, in his own inimitable, idiosyncratic
style, an audio introduction to sky-gazing (Patrick Moore's Astronomy, two
tapes, Bespoke Audio, #7.99).
The Naxos Classic Fiction series offers literature to musical accompaniment.
Juliet Stevenson's reading of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen is a winner, though
even this most intelligent of actresses can't make the mouselike Fanny Price a
second Elizabeth Bennett. The author's wisdom, not to mention her D-Parkerish
wit, are to the fore - ``Such a superfluity of children and want of almost
everything else ..... Selfishness must always be forgiven for there's no hope
of a cure ..... I must move; resting fatigues me''.
Austen often seems to espouse worldly standards while mocking them, but here
the worldly folk are chastened and the most douce of lovers end up happily in a
mere vicarage. Beethoven, Weber, and Mendelssohn add their counterpoint. (#7.99
for three cassettes.)
By contrast, Naxos has come unstuck with Alexandre Dumas's The Man in the Iron
Mask. The last in a series of adventures set at the seventeenth-century French
court, the novel relies heavily on background knowledge - not just about the
four Musketeers (patrician Athos, genial giant Portos, intriguer Aramis, and
captain of the King's Guard, d'Artagnan) but such historic personages as the
Chancellor Fouquet, his plebeian supplanter Colbert, and the Sun King and his
mother.
This Naxos abridgement has been so ruthless as to leave little character and no
suspense about the most compelling of plots. The rumour that Louis XIV had a
twin brother confined in the Bastille continues to fascinate but in the Naxos
version poor Prince Philippe has only the most perfunctory taste of freedom
before incarceration in the fearsome headgear of the title. (Two tapes, #6.49.)
Shades of the prison walls, too, about John Mortimer's Rumpole and the Angel of
Death (Penguin Audiobooks, two tapes, #7.99). The battered old advocate of the
underdog is in vintage form via the familiar voice of Leo McKern. Much fun is
had at the expense of the Sisterhood of Radical Lawyers, who mount a vendetta
against Rumpole's dim-witted colleague Claude Erskine-Brown. He has committed
the unforgivable offence of calling his woman pupil a fatty. The fact that she
doesn't mind in the least is neither here nor there.
self as a black cab waiting to lift any client, however hopeless or
disreputable - and makes this statement (presumably mirroring Mortimer's own
philosophy) into a kind of battered idealism.
There's lots of idealism - the brotherhood of man, the dignity of the poor and
lowly, etc - about Robert Burns. John Cairney, the actor who got under the skin
of the poet to an almost uncanny degree, reads some of his best verse in a tape
issued by HarperCollins as the bicentenary year hovers in sight.
Those old staples Tam o' Shanter and the Address to a Haggis get an inevitable
airing. Far more telling is The Cotter's Saturday Night - a testament to the
dignity of family life, however humble. The poem offers moments of great
lyricism (the lovers under the whitethorn) as well as a tirade against the
corruption of innocence (in which Burns reveals that typical Scottish capacity
for hypocrisy).
It's rather a waste to have such lovely songs as Mary Morrison, Sweet Afton, or
Ae Fond Kiss simply read - though the lyrics are strong enough to stand by
themselves. Little musical interludes with guitar and violin offer the briefest
taste of the missing melodies. (The Poems and Songs of Robert Burns, #5.95.)
Gillian Riley tells you How to Stop Smoking and Stay Stopped for Good in a
single cassette (Random House, #5.99). It seems an elaborate alternative to
deciding simply not to light up again.

Benedict Brogan ventures to a land on the edge of America where the descendants
of our emigrants
have carved out a distinct version of an old culture
THE words ``New Glasgow'' jumped out at me from the map stretched out on my
hotel-room floor. I had been searching for a destination for the next day's
expedition from Halifax, and there, clinging to the north shore of Nova Scotia,
was exactly what I wanted: a small town with a likely name and a promise of the
sort of Scottishness this corner of Canada has turned into an industry.
My hire car was booked for 8am, my map showed New Glasgow to be about two
hours' drive away, and a few quick calls gave me a contact in the town hall and
a promise of lunch with the mayor. Even better, the guidebook told me mining,
steel, and shipbuilding were the area's main industries. I could see it
already: a host of ready-made contrasts between old and New Glasgow,
interspersed with happy coincidences and meaningful comparisons.
A closer look at the map showed the whole north coast of Nova Scotia to be ripe
for an exercise in Scots tracking. New Glasgow, north of Glencoe, west of
Knoydart, and east of Scotsburn, is the main town in an area first settled by
Scots in the eighteenth century.
But when I mentioned my brilliant plan to Sandy Ferguson, the man behind the
desk in the hotel lobby, who met his Canadian wife Jennifer at university in
Scotland and followed her to Halifax, he was dubious. ``It's nothing like
Scotland out there, it's the worst sort of teuchterfied Scots sentimentality.
It's a falsified, atrophied Scottish culture that defends its traditions so
much, all Scottishness is being squeezed out of it.''
Eight hours later, undaunted, I was on my way. Despite the farms, the
motorways, and the motels, the drive across Nova Scotia does little to dispel
the sense of a wild place on the edge of a vast continent, where civilisation
is only as permanent as nature and the elements allow. The forest crowds the
road, except where it has been hacked back to make room for a house or a garage
or a billboard advertising motor oil. Shortly after 11 o'clock I pulled into
New Glasgow. It straddles not the New Clyde, as coincidence might have wished,
but the slow-moving East River. The steel bridge says ``Welcome to New
Glasgow''; the parking meters on every street say otherwise. Later I discover
they are made locally and exported all over the place.
Meetings had been arranged for me. Out past the rows of detached clapboard
houses, with their screen doors and mowed lawns, past the mall and Aberdeen
Hospital, I called on the local development office, where three slightly
bemused men with Scottish names offered me coffee and answered my questions
about the local economy.
I picked up some facts: the first steel to be cast in North America was poured
here; the last shipyard in the area has just closed; mining is more or less
gone; the steel industry remains, but only thanks to the demand for boxcars
from the North American rail-freight market.
This sounded familiar. Once-proud industries broken by the modern world;
rampant unemployment; the perfidy of a Conservative government; just like home.
The men now looked puzzled. Then Rob Roy, the youngest, proceeded to demolish
what I had begun to imagine were the makings of transatlantic solidarity.
Decline has been managed so as to hardly be felt, he said. New industries have
replaced the old. New hi-tech jobs are helping to halt the exodus of the young.
Entrepreneurs have sprung up, creating businesses and jobs through hard work
and tenacity. ``We may be Scottish, but we stand on our own,'' he said. Ouch.
On to lunch with Anne MacLean, New Glasgow's formidable mayor. She is only the
second woman councillor, and the first woman mayor, in New Glasgow's 120-year
history. In a town this size, with only six councillors and the mayor to run
the town, government is a small, grassroots concern. When MacLean isn't being
mayor she is an addiction rehabilitation supervisor for the health department.
She is big on the burgeoning connections with the old Glasgow and speaks warmly
of Susan Baird, Robert Innes, and the other Glasgow notables who have visited
and who received her on her visit to Scotland. In between mouthfuls of lobster
roll - lobster is the province's mascot and most noteworthy industry; as a
result it's unavoidable - I quiz her on cultural similarities.
New Glasgow has a population of 10,000, and 90% of its citizens are of Scottish
extraction. Its first settlers - Frasers and McKays - arrived in about 1784,
though there is no record of an obvious connection with Glasgow. The first
Scots in the area had landed a few miles away in 1773 in the Hector, the local
equivalent of the Mayflower, that brought 33 families and 25 bachelors from
Scotland in 1773. Nova Scotia had been ceded by the French to the British in
1707 under the Treaty of Utrecht, and with the new owners came Highlanders
expelled by the Clearances.
Two centuries have not diminished the area's pride in its origins. Distance, if
anything, has intensified it. New Glasgow wants the world to know it is
Scottish, even if its definition of Scottish resembles more a tin of Walker's
shortbread than a Saturday at Ibrox. Its coat of arms is identical to
Glasgow's; its motto is ``Let New Glasgow flourish''. The war memorial is a
Highland piper, the plinth inscribed with the very Scottish names of those who,
on two occasions, crossed the Atlantic to die in wars that had little to do
with this remote corner of North America. Every year the town celebrates the
Festival of the Tartans with children in kilts and massed pipe bands. ``We
haven't got our own tartan yet, but that's the next thing on the list,'' the
mayor says.
And it's the same throughout Scottish Nova Scotia. St Francis Xavier University
up the road in Antigonish boasts a centre for Gaelic studies; St Ann's in Cape
Breton has North America's only Gaelic college, complete with a Great Hall of
the Clans and an annual Mod; in Lismore a cairn commemorates the slaughter of
Bonnie Prince Charlie's Highlanders at Culloden; a replica of the Hector is
under construction in Pictou.
The tourist brochures proclaim it as heritage, euphemism for a tightly defined
nostalgia for something that no longer exists - if ever it did. No surprise,
really, that this celebration of Brigadoon bears no resemblance to the Scotland
of today. There is no New Old Firm in New Glasgow. The area may be
traditionally Protestant - the Catholics settled further along the coast - but
Catholic and Protestant children attend the same schools.
Next stop - the offices of the Evening News, circulation 10,000, the local
paper. An attempted robbery at the credit union has disturbed the town's peace:
the police chase is given prominence on page one; on page three it's business
as usual, with details of the annual draw for 200 moose-hunting licences.
Managing editor Doug MacNeil admits the loss of traditional industries has
caused some pain, but no social dislocation on a Scottish scale.
Still, he claims the area is more Scottish than Scotland itself. The people of
Pictou County - Picts? - identify themselves closely with their origins, with
names and clans and a connection to the Old World. ``It's important that people
in Scotland realise that the people here are proud of their Scottish
heritage.'' MacNeil says.
There is a last visit to be made, on the outskirts of town, to a small house
overlooking a large parking lot. Dr Carrie Best is in her mid-nineties, wears
killer shades, and is black. Her colour matters only in that she is one of
Canada's most celebrated campaigning journalists, who founded Nova Scotia's
first newspaper for black people, the Clarion, in 1947. Her motto should sit
above every reporter's desk: ``Do a mile of research before writing an inch of
copy''. Her living-room walls are crowded with photos, awards, and citations,
the most prominent being the Order of Canada, awarded in 1974.
She reminds me that Nova Scotia, and New Glasgow, are not just about displaced
Scots with a tartan fixation. The black community here, one of the oldest in
North America, was granted a tract of land in 1787 by the then governor. ``We
weren't just dropped here. We were here before the Scots. This land was given
to us,'' she says, jabbing my kneecap for emphasis. This essential historical
detail is all too easily swamped by heritage.
Dr Best remembers the days when New Glasgow was a place where life was
distinctly easier if you were white. Now, with her sharp eye, she spots a town
that has progressed enormously. The New Glasgow she knows has nothing to do
with kilts and pipes. It is a small town in Canada that has overcome its
experiences of racism, prejudice, and narrow-mindedness to elect a woman mayor,
as well as one black and one Asian councillor. ``I'm passionate in my loyalty
now to New Glasgow because I have proved to myself that you can make the town
what you want it to be if you have got the guts to stand up for what is right.''
Late that night, as I drove back to Halifax in the blinding rain, following the
road by the glimmer of the lorry ahead of me, a local station played a
schmaltzy local version of the Skye Boat Song. Nova Scotia's understanding of
Scotland may be sentimental, but it is also clear, and happily oblivious of the
identity crisis that grips the mother country.

Alison Kerr enters the realm of fantasy
with a writer whose imagination ranges
from Middle Earth to Camelot
DAVID Day's multi-faceted career and varied interests have taken him all over
the world with a passport that has described him as both a lumberjack and a
writer - depending on the decade.
Now resident in London, he has written more than 30 books; an expert on
mythology he consequently, counts among his friends at least three of the Monty
Python team.
Day started his working life as a lumberjack in British Columbia - a job which
endeared him no end to his new Python pals after he first met Terry Jones in
1981. ``Terry kept inviting me round to dinner because it gave him and Michael
(Palin) the chance to sing the Lumberjack Song,'' he says in an Irish-sounding
drawl.
The son of a firechief, Day grew up next to an Indian reservation, in an area
steeped in folklore. Spare time was spent reading: his interest in Greek
mythology was, however, a closet activity since it was not in keeping with the
macho lifestyle of a young lumberjack. His other love was writing poetry, which
- along with storytelling - has always been part of Canadian culture,
especially among men in rural areas.
Over the course of the decade from the mid-1960s, Day spent blocks of time
either working in logging camps or studying for his two university degrees.
In 1977, after working for a Canadian publishing company for a year, Day moved
to England and looked for a similar job in London. There wasn't one, so he
helped his friend Alan Thornton set up Greenpeace in Britain. At that stage
Greenpeace's international status was unimaginable: it was a case of ``14
hippies and a dog,'' says the sardonic writer.
Day also began to work on ideas for books. His first was The Tolkien Bestiary -
an guide to the world of the author of The Hobbit series. Its success led to
two more Tolkien tomes, the more recent of which (Tolkien's Ring) has just
appeared in paperback. In between times Day has written everything from books
of poetry to works of natural history, with collections of children's stories
thrown in for good measure.
Another, less self-effacing but more likely, reason for his genre-spanning
tendencies is that all his writings have been outlets for, and have their roots
in, his interest in folklore and mythology. Day's natural history work (The
Doomsday Book of Animals and a series of films for American and Japanese
television on animals which have become extinct this century) stemmed from his
fascination with the Red Indian stories he heard as a youngster; He has also
written children's stories based on legends he has picked up on his travels.
Day's latest publication is an epic one: The Quest for King Arthur is
beautifully illustrated and takes a different approach from every other work on
the legend. ``Usually people write a generic book: they make Arthur all one
story. In fact, it's lots of different stories.''
Day's theory is that Arthur was a different person every century, depending on
who paid the storytellers. ``The Arthur we know - with the court at Camelot,
the magician Merlin, the sword Excalibur and the Knights of the Round Table -
was based on the Tudor version of the legend as written by Malory in his Morte
d'Arthur in 1485.''
This is certainly the version that Hollywood has decided to stick to; most
recently with the movie First Knight, in which Richard Gere hammed up Lancelot
and Sean Connery starred as Arthur - an appropriate choice since Arthur may
well have had some Scots in his accent. Day found First Knight ``painful to
watch. I kept on thinking: `What century is this?'. ''
Before the popular imagination settled on this version, however, the characters
had been through various changes: Henry II's wife, Eleanor, didn't like the
fact that kings got all the attention, so she ordered the storytellers to make
King Arthur's wife Guinevere the real star of the legend.
In the twelfth century, an order of monks rewrote the story to portray Arthur's
half-sister, Morgan le Fay, as a baddie because they wanted to promote the idea
that women had no souls. As Day points out, ``these were complex figures
originally used for propaganda, but people have forgotten that they had been
shaped by propaganda.''
``What my book does is peel back the layers surrounding the legend of Arthur.
He's like a whirlwind: we only know him by what whirls around him - all the
separate myths that have gathered around him.''
The first sighting of Arthur in the pages of history was in 480 AD. At that
time Arthur, or Arthurius, was not a name but a title. The original Arthur was
a Romanised Celt who commanded the British cavalry from Strathclyde - the last
stronghold of the Welsh-speaking Celts. Since his first appearance in history,
stories of the life of ``Arthur'' have, according to Day, been twisted and used
by almost every British monarch in order to prove their right to rule.
It may seem a long way from the logging camps of British Columbia, but David
Day asserts that ``the patterns are the same in both Red Indian and British
mythology''.
So what next, now that Day has grappled with the knights of the Round Table?
He's currently working on a volume of poetry to be entitled Just Say No to
Family Values, as well as juggling three children's books.
He has also been paving the way for his chum Michael Palin to meet some of his
old totem pole-carving friends as Palin is in the middle of another Around the
World-type exercise. And he's also keen to visit Scotland, to begin the next
stage of his Arthurian quest: an investigation into all the fraudulent
documents made through the centuries as part of what he cryptically calls ``The
King Arthur conspiracy''.

Iain White goes in
search of Scotland's
supernatural hotel
guests and has a few
disturbing moments
WHEN I hatched the idea of visiting a number of haunted hotels I was
enthusiastic and confident, almost blase about it all. However, as I was
approaching the Meldrum House Hotel, my early courage for the project was
waning. I had agreed to stay in a bedroom reputedly haunted by the ghost of The
White Lady, and as I entered this dark, old rambling place I had a sense of
foreboding. I half-expected an octogenarian butler to greet me with
ingratiating servility and a knowing smile.
It was, however, the lady proprietor who welcomed me cheerily from within the
sombre entrance hall. ``So you're the ghost-hunter,'' she enthused. I insisted
that I was keen to meet the owners of the ghost rather than the real thing and
further emphasised that curiosity was my only motive for the benefit of any
would-be eavesdropper.
``That's her behind you,'' my host added casually. I froze in horror and
turning slowly I met the piercing gaze of . . . an oil painting. My host led me
up a creaking staircase, through an enormous oak-panelled doorway and along a
gloomy portrait-lined passageway all the way along to the possessed room . . .
Scotland has always had a tradition of ghosts and ghouls and the Scottish
Tourist Board has published a list of 30 hotels which claim to have
supernatural occurrences or unexplained visitors. Many of the tales of these
permanent, non-paying guests centre on the North-east. The city of Aberdeen
boasts a hotel with two ghosts, while at Strathdon a hotel is haunted by a
phantom who plays the bagpipes. In Methlick, the hotel, which was originally
the manse, is troubled by the spirit of a previous Free Kirk pastor who, rather
surprisingly, appears only in the bar.
I had begun my investigation at the Thainstone House Hotel, near Inverurie,
which is reputedly haunted by a Green Lady. Believed to be the daughter of a
previous owner of the house, she was killed in a riding accident while wearing
her favourite green cloak. The hotel has been modernised inside and with the
addition of its well-appointed country club, and carried little initial
atmosphere of the wraithly lady's ethereal exploits. However, there is a
bedroom where things have been known to move around independently and into
which pets will not enter.
The ghost seems often to be irritated by other women and a recent resident
returned to her room after dinner to find the dressing-table glass smashed and
the contents of her make-up bag scattered around the room. I settled down for
the evening awaiting the unexpected.
At one o'clock in the morning I was awakened by the persistent and violent
rattling of the brass handles of the dressing-table. I switched on the light
and watched in disbelief as the activity blatantly continued. A closer
examination of the situation, however, evidenced the truth, for whenever my
next-door, all-too-earthly neighbour moved about his room, the vibrations
spread through some very flimsy floorboards to my room. At breakfast next
morning I was thus able to report that my sleep had passed untroubled.
In the Borders, there are a number of establishments which have reported the
activities of unaccountable apparitions. One hotel near Biggar has a spectre
who appears on the patio and the roof, and who seems to indulge in such pranks
as moving furniture and changing television channels. Another report is a ghost
called Gladys who makes regular appearances to the local patrons of an inn near
Castle Douglas. Angered by anyone who sits in her chair, she makes her presence
felt so vividly that Border Television believe the shadowy figure that they
once captured on film was her.
I next stayed at the Dryburgh Abbey Hotel, near St Boswells, where there have
been a number of separate reports of supernatural occurrences by yet another
colour of damsel, a Grey Lady. She is believed to have had an affair with one
of the monks from the abbey who was subsequently put to death for his
infidelity. On hearing this tragic news, the distraught lover drowned herself
in the nearby River Tweed.
Her ghost has been seen in the grounds and walking across the chain bridge, but
during 1993 she began to make her presence felt more often within the hotel
during major renovations to the building. Workmen reported that tools had been
mysteriously moved and equipment was being tampered with. The manager told me
that he is convinced that he felt the presence of someone behind him one
evening despite the fact that he was alone in the hotel. A complete search of
the building revealed no intruders while the locks on all the windows and doors
remained untampered with.
My own visit, however, was again uneventful and, despite close inspection of
the hotel and grounds during the early hours of the morning, I was unable to
locate any ghostly roommates.
When I arrived at Meldrum House Hotel, any scepticism was rapidly replaced by
an uneasy sense of foreboding. A previous visitor had received an icy kiss
during a violent thunderstorm in my room and in another incident a guest had
found himself compressed to the bed by an unknown force for several minutes.
The husband of the owner admitted with some degree of reluctance that he
believed he had seen the ghost working in the hallway upstairs.
Of course, I had heard similar stories elsewhere, but as I passed beneath the
stern gaze of those eerie portraits, I felt the presence of something extremely
unsettling. This wing of the house was as quiet as the grave, and my room
remained icy cold all night in spite of the central heating. I must admit that
for the first time in over 30 years, I went to bed with the light on, I even
left the radio on, offering a reassuring babble in the corner. I did not sleep
a wink.
When the first light of dawn arrived I immediately packed my bags to leave.
Shivering, I quickly dressed with hat, scarf, gloves and an extra jumper for
the winter weather. As I walked down the long driveway I did not look back. I
was remarkably hot, sweating in fact, Later I discovered from weather reports
that it had been one of the mildest weekends recorded for November.

n SPOKESWOMAN for the Jewish Information and Resource Centre in Glasgow:
The 25th of December will just be a normal day for Orthodox Jews in Scotland
except that we won't be going to work and the television will be better.
Obviously children are affected by all the Christmas activities going on, but
they learn to adjust. In fact, we have our own festival of Chanukah at this
time of year when we light candles every night for eight days and the children
get little presents and small amounts of money.

WITH a bank account number which begins 007, I may have a head start on others
when it comes to daredevil exploits.
But an adventure break in the spectacular surroundings of the Swiss Alps
certainly - though perhaps only temporarily - sated my taste for danger.
Only a couple of miles from genuine James Bond territory in the shape of the
famous revolving restaurant at the top of the Schilthorn peak, used as a
location for the slightly less memorable On Her Majesty's Secret Service, I
found myself in a cable car, 100 metres above the ground, preparing for the
highest bungee jump in Europe.
It seemed a fitting end to a day which had begun with a 15km bike ride through
the Lauterbrunnen Valley, overlooked by two of the world's most famous peaks,
the Eiger and the Jungfrau and their slightly lesser-known friend, the Munch.
After lunch, we hit the water, literally, with a spot of whitewater river
rafting along the crystal-clear rapids of the Lutschine.
Safety is of paramount importance, with rafters kitted out not only with wet
suits, but also lifejackets and protective helmets.
The white water calmed as the river ran into one of the stunning lakes next to
the famous Swiss resort of Interlaken. Envious passengers on steamboats
cruising the lake waved as we drifted into Interlaken.
Wet suit deposited, I headed for a refreshing and relaxing swim in slightly
warmer waters at the action centre pool. But the highlight adventure of the day
still awaited me.
While others refused the option of the jump - even after watching other
daredevils leap safely -- I was still determined to give it a go.
Six of us climbed on board the cable car for the two-minute trip to the jumping
point, only a few metres from the highest waterfall in Europe, a cascade of
tumbling, clear pale blue water.The distant crash of the water echoed gently
around the cable car as the bungeemaster explained the rules and introduced the
jump team.
One by one, we lined up, like lambs to the slaughter, to choose our harness -
jumpers can be strapped in around the waist and chest, or for the more daring
there is the option of diving tied by the ankles.
Being a first-time jumper, I had decided on the chest harness. I might be
brave, but I'm not that brave, I thought.
My moment finally arrived and my cool veneer of confidence evaporated. My knees
turned to jelly. My stomach churned. My palms began sweating uncontrollably.
Final safety checks completed, the bungee team started the countdown. ``Five,
four, three . . . '' I was out, plunging uncontrollably towards the fast water
and green fields I had admired only seconds before.
I suddenly found my stomach in my mouth, but decided it would be inappropriate
to be sick, given my circumstances. I found I had no time to worry. Suddenly, I
was enjoying the insane sense of freedom, the sensation of flying towards the
ground.
Just as my senses began to adjust to the idea of my new-found Peter Pan status,
the bungee rope provided a timely reminder that I was not the fictional
flight-assisted child. Bouncing upwards for what seemed like an eternity, I
found myself somersaulting 360 degrees, a manoeuvre not completed since
schooldays. Several violent bounces later, I really was beginning to quickly go
off the entire idea . . . and it was all over.
As I touched the ground and hit the landing mat, the enormity of what I had
done suddenly hit home. Boosted by a sudden rush of exhilaration, I punched the
air and ran to find the other jumpers, hugging and congratulating themselves.
Trembling, we shared descriptions of the sensations we had experienced, but the
number one question on all lips was: Would you do it all again? The popular
consensus was yes, but please not right away!
Venturing out to dinner later at one of the very excellent hotels in my Alpen
base - the popular winter ski resort of Murren - I was greeted by the dulcet
tones of a Scots accent, who had shared my exploits.
The voice belonged to 27-year-old Alan Ramsay, head waiter at the Hotel Eiger.
Originally from Peebles, he moved to Switzerland in December 1990. The Eiger is
closed for five months every year, but the excellent pay allows him the
opportunity to travel.
``I've bungee-jumped 350 metres from a helicopter in New Zealand. I've offered
to do the one you did in a kilt, if they let me do it for nothing,'' said Alan.
It would be something of a dawdle for him, I imagine.
The three-day adventure break to the Bernese Oberland is organised through the
Swiss Tourist Authority, with flights from Heathrow by Swissair and
accommodation at the four-star Palace Hotel in Murren. Adventure activity can
be arranged through Adventure World of Interlaken.

Jane Scott is taken aback when she starts to tot up the true costs involved in
a medieval romance
THERE is a charming children's book, now sadly out of print, called The
Thirteen Days of Christmas by Jenny Overton. It describes what would happen if
one of history's great love songs were a true story, and the answer, of course,
is total chaos.
One partridge in a pear tree is an enchanting idea, but you may not have taken
the song as literally as the lover in Overton's book, who hoped to win his
lady's hand in marriage and who duly turned up every morning for 12 days with a
new partridge and a new pear tree - and medieval market town houses, where the
novel is set, have little enough room as it is.
Then there were the ever-increasing numbers of turtle doves (two every day for
11 days), calling birds (four for nine days) and French hens (three for 10
days) with the attendant squawking and mess.
Medieval families, however, were quite used to keeping poultry out the back;
even the bad-tempered geese laying eggs everywhere and the swans lording it
over the street were as nothing to eight maids a-milking bringing along eight
cows and delivering eight buckets of fresh milk daily until the end of
Christmas.
By this time the town was turning up en masse every morning to see delivery
boys bringing cages and rings and food and bedding for all the animals, and by
the ninth day there was really something to see; with ladies dancing, lords
a-leaping and pipers piping - 11 of them, for two days, on the last day
accompanied by the 12 drummers giving the loved one, who by then had
accumulated a grand total of 40 gold rings to help sway her mind, the wake-up
call to end them all.
But that was then. How would a lover, minded to give the 12 days of Christmas,
fare today - and how much would                  it cost?
Pear trees are no problem, according to Dobbies of Helensburgh; only that the
branches are bare at this time of year. But you could choose fruiting trees -
Conference, Williams, or Comice - for #16.99 for this year's stock - or pay a
little more and get silver pear trees for #19.99, bearing no fruit but giving a
beautiful silvery weeping foliage come the spring. Let's choose the expensive
option: 12 trees will set the cause of love back #239.88.
Finding the birds, however, is enough to make you weep. After days phoning
round organisations ranging from Edinburgh Zoo to the magazine Poultry World
(``Oh, we get all sorts of strange requests on Poultry World,'' said one
reporter), to the British Chicken Information Service (``I'm afraid you're
going to have to ring France. We only deal with British chickens. Can the egg
information service help?'') a shopping list was drawn up.
You'll have to part with about #7 a bird for the French Red Leg partridge
(``They don't roost in trees. The Red Leg has been seen on gates, however,''
said Michael Roberts of the Domestic Fowl Trust). Turtle doves have been almost
driven out of the country by the imported Ring dove (#10 a bird) and there's a
choice of French hen, rejoicing in names ranging from Salmon Faverolle to La
Flehe. We'll go for the popular Maran, which costs #18 a bird, and lays
beautiful brown eggs.
We'll take calling birds as canaries, #12 each, and geese, if you're lucky, at
around #24 a bird (you would be lucky because the hot summer simply sent the
ganders to sleep and reduced their fertility; geese are in short supply this
year).
Wild swans are protected birds and capturing them could land you in jail over
Christmas, but you could adopt Whooper or Bewick's Swans from the Wildlife and
Wetlands Trust in Slimbridge, Sussex, for #25 a bird for a year. Alternatively,
you could ferry the loved one to a country park like Calderglen, East Kilbride,
to see the black swans in situ.
The total cost of your fowl will be #3286.
Handmade rings, said Tom Wallace, jeweller of Queen Street, Glasgow, could cost
anything from #25 to #25,000 each, if a four-carat diamond were required, that
is. A plain gold band costs around #15 for the finest 2mm strand, and up to
#250 for the chunky 12mm option; we'll plump for 40 rings somewhere between the
two, say for #4800.
Eight maids a-milking, says Roberta Dunbar, west area chairman of the Scottish
Young Farmers, is more likely nowadays to be ``one cow in an Isuzu jeep and a
portable milking can. It's just not the same, is it?'' In her grandfather's day
they'd have eight or 10 milking the cows, doing the job of just one farmer and
his electric milking equipment today. All dairy farmers can still milk by hand,
however, and it shouldn't be too hard to find eight girls to do it - ``but it
would be expensive. Under NFU salary guides it's about #200 a week, and a milk
cow costs #900 to #1000.''
She reckoned, however, that if you could get someone to lend you the cows (you
can't really hire them for the day), paid #30 each a day for haulage (the cost
of getting a cow to market), paid the milkmaids #4 an hour, and bought the milk
at 26.5p a litre (that's with premiums for butterfat, protein, and cell count)
you'd get away with #2052. But you'd then have to work out what to do with 1400
pints of milk.
Now for the dancers.
``I'm not sure we can manage real lords doing it,'' said William Crawford of
Highlander Music near Beauly, Inverness. ``But you can certainly get dancers to
do that.''
William organises dance troupes and tours across the globe. In the repertoire
of his dancers are Scottish Country, Highland (``very competitive, nowadays,''
said William), step dancing - re-imported from Canada, where the immigrants
arrived with dance forms which subsequently died out in Scotland - ballroom and
Latin American.
You could have your nine ladies doing any of the above, although the 10 lords
a-leaping sounds just like Highland dancing, he said - ``A good lord should be
able to manage a quick sword dance before breakfast!''
And the cost? Each dancer receives #70 a day, plus travelling, accommodation,
and food - add another #40 a day. Then there are the costumes; lords and ladies
don't come cheap (all that brocade and lace); better count on #30 each. Grand
total: #7830.
Back to Glasgow for our pipes and drums, where Liz Spy, secretary of the
Kinning Park Pipe Band burst out laughing at our request.
``But it's not so daft,'' she said, wiping her eyes. ``For a start, I would
probably be able to get you 11 pipers, but we would need to filch some drummers
from another band because we've only got eight. I suppose it doesn't matter if
they are in another colour of kilt?''
Kinning Park turns out in the handsome blue-green Ancient Hunting McIntyre
tartan - ``and that doesn't come cheap, believe me,'' said Liz, who is keen to
get sponsorship for the band.
The main problem would be to get the band members, all working men, together on
a weekday; that costs money, and they need proper notice.
``Pipe bands have come to the conclusion that we have been selling ourselves
too cheap, because lots of people want an entire band of 30 people out for two
or three hours, for the whole parade, for #150, and that's not on.''
She thought, however, that with a bit of negotiation she could get the
requisite pipers and drummers together for #900 for the two days, taking us up
to the twelfth day of Christmas.
The lover in Jenny Overton's book won his lady's heart on the thirteenth day,
when she realised she wanted nothing so simple as to marry him. By this time,
of course, he had bought the most expensive Christmas presents anyone in the
town had ever seen, and perhaps a life of simplicity was the one that beckons,
although as a trader he may have had deep pockets. Our modern day lover, on the
thirteenth day, will be #19,107.88 in the red; although if the answer is the
right one it will no doubt be worth it.
n Twelve pear trees will set you back #239.88 and the twelve
partridges #84, making a total of #323.88.
n With Turtle Doves almost driven out of the country, their
replacement Ring Doves will cost in the region of #220.
n Three French hens, with              attendant Gallic squawking, will
all add up to #540 for ten days.
n Hark! Four calling birds, in the form of singing canaries of course, at #12
each, will hit you to the tune of #432.
n Five decent sized gold rings - let's not be stingy about this - for eight
days come to a staggering #4800.
n Six geese a laying will cost #168, but at least you'll have a decent sized
omelette every morning.
n Seven swans a swimming, being a protected species, should be seen only; the
adoption papers will set you back #150.
n If you can manage to organise a deal with the NFU for eight maids a milking,
the exercise would cost #2052. Have a word with the milkman, instead.
n To acquire nine ladies dancing for four days you have to worry about
travelling expenses, accomodation, and the cost of costumes: the total is #4230.
n If you hire the ten lords a           leaping from the same dance school as
your ladies, the cost is the right royal sum of #3600.
n In order to get a good deal on the eleven pipers piping, it is
better to ask them to bring some drummer friends for the whole musical package.
n With their piper chums          chanting, the twelve drummers drumming will
hit you in the            wallet for #900.

PATRIOT IN BERLIN
Piers Paul Read
Weidenfeld and Nicolson, #15.99
I DIDN'T want to finish this book. It has seen me through three disturbed weeks
and four plane journeys - too much of a crutch to swap for a paperback. This is
a thriller, tightly controlled but with an ambitious overview that pits the
narcissistic elements of the fashionable free-world personality against the
impersonal, driven ideology of the former communist East.
Post cold-war Russia and Berlin are the settings. Nicolai Gerasimov, in an
office in the Lubyanka, being briefed on a secret mission to the West, has
career worries - will they abolish the KGB? - and a wife who won't go out and
stand in food queues. That his search for a missing top-rank unreconstructed
intelligence officer will take him to Berlin is as good as a holiday.
American art historian Francesca McDermott, invited to Berlin to organise a
major retrospective exhibition of those twentieth-century Russian paintings
dismissed under communism as ``decadent'', revels in the career boost and the
chance to renew acquaintances with the friends of her postgraduate years in the
city. However, she is too much of a skinny, gym-frequenting power-dresser to
empathise with the mind-set of her colleagues, emerging awkwardly from the
socialist system.
Kessler and Dorn, Berlin detectives investigating the torture and murder of a
pair of Russian icon smugglers in the Dubrowstrasse, have the weary wised-up
outlook of men whose crime-fighting is complicated by Ostpolitik. When they
request help from Moscow they fully expect to be sent a professional lummox, a
man who, behind a screen of lumpen camaraderie, will smoothly block all avenues
of inquiry.
When Gerasimov arrives and mistakes a prostitute for a pick-up their belief is
amply confirmed.
Francesca, meanwhile, early morning jogging in the park, is attacked by three
men of Turkish appearance, and saved from rape only by the timely arrival of
her enigmatic Russian colleague on the exhibition committee, Andrei Serotkin.
These two are cool, competent, and self-sufficient beyond the range of their
fellow committee members. An attraction begins to build that is fuelled as much
by their isolated arrogance, as the attraction of their opposing and mysterious
ideologies.
And then the paintings, Chagalls and Kandinskys from the finest collections of
the free world, vanish from their secure store. And nothing was as simple as it
seemed. As the pieces of the plot begin to fly into place, a contemporary love
story emerges, fashioned with immense restraint out of opposing and unyielding
personalities uncluttered by detail.
The complexities of the plot stem entirely from the complexity of truth,
belief, and identity. There are no ornamental red herrings to deflect its calm
unfolding, nor red-hot bedroom scenes to undermine the central purity of the
characters, and the writing entirely matches the controlled intensity of the
whole. Meryl Streep and Mel Gibson for the film. Read it.

EGON SCHIELE: Eros
and Passsion
Klaus Albrecht Schroder
Prestel, #14.95
THERE are all sorts of ways of hooking an audience. Here Egon Schiele's
startling, superb, and innovative draughtsmanship could be one; his
asymmetrical compositions another. Schroder has chosen the soft option: sex.
Egon Schiele is a superb yet strangely unsung artist, so this book, with its
many excellent illustrations, should be very welcome. Unfortunately the
high-flown text - obviously someone's extended thesis - merely cobbles together
chunks of writing by others with a misleading, muddled appraisal of Schiele's
``allegedly pornographic imagery'', leaving us with a volume which raises more
questions than it answers.
As the short biographical introduction tells us, Schiele was born in Austria in
1890 and died, all too young, in 1918, just months after his famous countryman
Gustave Klimt. Bearing in mind Klimt's huge success (his pictures currently on
millions of birthday cards, postcards, and calendars), I have never been able
to understand Schiele's neglect - especially given his preoccupation with the
nude.
Yet when a major Schiele exhibition was held at London's Royal Academy a few
years ago, the Academy was unable to find any sponsorship till the very last
minute when a minor - but enterprising - spectacle-frame manufacturer stepped
in. The exhibition was memorable for paintings like Self Portait with Chinese
Lantern Plant 1912 and Seated Male Nude, which in the flesh, with their
beautifully textured paint surfaces and nuances of exquisite chalk-drawn line,
are somehow less shocking than on a glossy printed page.
The RA's difficulty with sponsorship is symptomatic of the general fear
surrounding Schiele's so-called soft porn which, as here, clouds the vision of
his genius.
True, Schiele depicted the body with a radical candour that was unheard of in
the early years of the twentieth century. True, a preoccupation with the human
body pervades his work. But this book leans on sex; uses sex as its main hook.
It details ``obscene nakedness and indecency'' with a Victorian relish,
introducing nineteenth-century photographs of mental patients without any
explanation as to their connection - or lack of it - with Schiele. Did Schiele
know of, or use, these photographs? We are not told.
So what is the dividing line between titillation and truth; obscenity and
aesthetics; prurience and painting? ``Schiele was an erotic artist. He was
extremely liberal in sexual matters.'' The analysis is simplistic in the
extreme, a fact underlined by the banal chapter headings. Sex Crime as Artifact
leads into an account of the Neulengbach affair when Schiele was charged with
abduction of a minor, sexual abuse, and ``open outrage of public morals or
decency''. (He was in fact totally innocent and aquitted.)
Other chapters are titled The Iconography of Mangled Flesh; Shamelessness as an
Aesthetic Principle, and even From Art to Pathology. It's all page-three,
penny-dreadful stuff dressed up as academic research. The amateur
psychoanalysis is perhaps the         most objectionable aspect,
where Schroder often gets his           facts wrong.
So leave your Victorian values at home; study the breathtaking images, and
don't take the text too seriously.
Schiele's lean bodies, bony, angular in the extreme, are ideal for structural
exaggeration; perfect for the turn-of-the-century Vienna Secessionist
androgynous aesthetic, creating an art nouveau aspect with bite; a graphic
hard-edged style that makes Charles Rennie Mackintosh look soft.
If not so sad and tormented, they could almost be said to be a caricature of
the artist as sufferer; artist as victim. Schiele is as cruel on himself as on
his women. His models included his beloved sister, his girlfriends, and
latterly his wife Edith. As is obvious from the helpful documentary
photos of Schiele and pals, he                                        was
a handsome, well-fed chap completely unlike his anguished self-portrait.
By the age of 28 Egon Schiele was a rave success, regarded as Austria's leading
artist and exhibiting all over Europe. His death, three days after that of his
pregnant wife, both of the deadly Spanish influenza, ended his life in the sort
of Hollywood-style melodrama of which, one feels, Schiele would have approved.

Parties, far from being the heart of the
season, can be absolutely excruciating for more timid souls. Victoria Freedman
searches for a solution
BY now there will be people worrying themselves silly because they have
received an invitation to a Christmas party. For those who are shy, the season
to be social can be excruciating.
The simple advice to stay at home will not do. First, there are work parties
that have to be attended. Then there are partners to accompany. In any case, if
you are shy there is no choice in the matter, according to Dr Robert Edelmann,
senior lecturer in clinical psychology at Surrey University, who has studied
the problem for 15 years since he began to investigate why social encounters go
wrong.
``Shy people feel they have to go to parties. What will people think if they
don't? Therefore they put themselves into situations that others wouldn't
bother about. Non-shy people are quite happy to pick and choose. They would
just think, `I don't want to go'. But once a shy person is invited to a party,
the immediate thought is that they have to go even if they don't want to, even
if they won't know many people there. So the pressure they build on themselves
starts with the invitation.''
The worries mount - what will they wear, who will they know, what if they don't
know anyone, what will they say, what if they find nothing to say, what if
nobody wants to talk to them, what if people notice them.......?
``It's almost as if they're talking themselves into a state of anxiety,'' says
Edelmann.
``But the one thing that shy people clearly do is keep practising. They want to
be in contact with others, they don't want to be lonely, so they do put
themselves into disturbing contexts. And that is why they suffer. Life is a
constant round of discomfort. You want to be confident, outgoing, sociable, and
you're not.''
It is a scenario that Abigail Thompson recognises very well. ``I think a lot of
people who loathe parties go to them because it's expected, and to a certain
extent I've done that a lot. I've often had to go to parties or dances with my
husband and dreaded them beforehand and hated them while I was there. If I
found people I felt comfortable with, I could talk, but put me with another set
of people and I'd hardly open my mouth. I remember spending so many evenings
going back and forwards to the toilet, not because I needed to, but to pass
time.''
Shyness is not to be confused with social phobia, a condition that affects
around 2% of the population, where anxiety reaches such a level that people
avoid all social encounters. Nor does it mean that those   suffering are
socially unskilled. ``Shyness has an engrained self-consciousness, an
over-awareness of oneself, an over-focusing on oneself. That can feed into
being so concerned that it disrupts your performance and you look unskilled,
but you're not in reality,'' explains Edelmann. However, the more
people stammer and blush in conversation, the more they feel inadequate as they
focus on what others are thinking.
What can be done depends on how shyness is perceived. Edelmann says there are
three explanations of why people are shy - it's a personality trait, a learned
behaviour, and a pattern of thinking. ``There's not much you can do about a
personality trait as it is inherent. Learned behaviour can be changed to a
certain extent, by unlearning a pattern of reacting and learning new practices.
But you can probably do most about the way you think.'' Treatment involves
gradually replacing negative thoughts with positive ones.
``Most shy people tend to be fairly irrational in their thinking, not in
general but in how they think of themselves in social situations. They tend to
think `nobody else is shy, it's only me'. So they learn to think more
realistically and more positively.
``Another pattern of thinking that can be changed is absolutist, that
everything must go right. There are occasions when everybody will suffer in a
social situation and most of the time it's laughed off. But if you're shy, it's
a disaster.''
Self-consciousness can also be worked on by reflecting thoughts away from
oneself - ``this person finds me boring'' - and on to what the other person
looks like in terms of hairstyle and clothes.
Abigail Thompson, now 50, coped better with her shyness after becoming a
counsellor. ``I found that I wasn't shy on a one-to-one basis and it also gave
me confidence. And I don't really worry about what others are thinking any
more. I'm too old.''
Although extremely shy people are often regarded rather unfairly as aloof and
arrogant, those who cope with their shyness will simply be seen as quiet and
reserved. Which is not a bad thing. ``A certain amount of shyness in social
situations is actually seen in a quite positive way, particularly in women,''
says Edelmann. ``Even in this liberated age men still have this notion they
have to be the dominant males.
``But very few people are raving extroverts and they're not really liked that
much anyway. They're too brash, too loud, and they obviously don't understand
others. Whereas if you come across as just slightly demure, slightly reserved,
slightly hesitant, and if it's used appropriately, it's seen as quite empathic.
I can think of one young lady on Panorama recently who did just that.''
n.Abigail Thompson's name has been changed.

Hugh Ouston keeps his fingers crossed for an appearance of waxwings to weigh
down Scotland's berry bushes this winter and cap off a perfect festive season
YEARS may go by with just a handful of waxwings wintering here; then comes an
irruption and reports of parrots on the cotoneasters from all over suburban
Scotland. Even if you've seen them before, waxwings are a really special winter
bird. At first glance they might be starlings, but look closely and a more
exotic picture unfolds: a plump peachy body with a yellow-tipped tail, a mobile
crest, a black bib and eyestrip, secondary feathers give them the appearance of
having been dipped in sealing wax. These beautiful details combine with exotic
manners and photogenic poses, and above all with tameness and a weakness for
the berry bushes outside our windows, to make waxwings a Christmas favourite.
There are very good reasons why waxwings only visit us every few years and
equally good reasons why they are found in suburban gardens when they do. They
breed in the endless forests of the remote taiga, scattered and hard to find.
During the summer they eat insects, of which the northlands provide an
unlimited supply. I have seen them in the early winter flycatching from the
wires over the electrified Edinburgh-London rail line. They whirred up steeply
then planed around and down to the wires again. When a 125 came by, the party
of a dozen or so took refuge in an ash nearby, but only for a couple of
minutes. There aren't many trains - or people - in the boreal woods. However,
to survive right through the winter they depend on berries.
Specifically, they depend on our own familiar rowan. A hot summer in the far
north means more young waxwings grow up and it means - as 1995 has taught all
gardeners - more berries on the trees. This is fine for one winter, but the
increased numbers surviving face a problem if the berry crop fails the
following year, as it is likely to do.
By October, psychological stress, an important tool of evolution, encourages
the flocks to move on south before their food runs out. The prevailing autumn
winds and the shape of Scandinavia send them straight over to us.
In most years the few waxwings which arrive will find enough to eat on the east
coast. However, when the irruption is huge - and in November 1965 there were
11,000 in Britain - they will tour through to the west, down to England and
even on to the Continent, perhaps returning through Germany to their lonely
breeding forests.
But why cotoneasters? When the waxwings arrive, the berries in the countryside
will already have been stripped by the regular migrants, redwings and
fieldfares in particular. Thrushes are not so fond of cotoneasters, so there
may well be full bushes for the waxwings. A single bird can eat 170 berries an
hour, which means it would take two days for a party of seven to clear 100
square feet. In fact they will eat all kinds of berries: pyracantha and
viburnum, bramble, and dog rose, hawthorn and juniper . . .  and of course
mistletoe and holly, as we know from Auntie Morag's annual card.
Since I don't know the meteorological reports from the northern palearctic for
1994, I couldn't hazard a guess whether this will be a ``waxwing winter''.
There have been two fine irruptions in the last decade: 1988-89, and 1991-92.
On a glorious day in the spring of '89 I spent a happy hour photographing 30 or
so as they drank from the gutters of suburban Rosyth and posed in the saplings
along the M90. All the while they kept up a soft trill quite different from any
of our native birds. It ``at once strikes on the ear of the ornithologist as
the cry of a strange bird'', wrote Charles St John in 1847. Such social
sibilant conversations are almost continuous. Their Latin specific name is,
after all, garrulus.
These were the first waxwings I'd seen since I was a teenage postman in St
Andrews. Vanity forbids me from naming that year. However, the earliest
recorded invasion was in 1679-80. From the end of November to late February
that waxwing winter, the future King James II lived in Edinburgh to keep out of
the way of the anti-Catholic mob in London. Were his cold walks in the gardens
at Holyrood, or his golf or his horseracing down at Leith, enlivened by the
antics of the ``Bohemian chatterers'' as they used to be called?
The most reliable place to see waxwings recently has been the city centre of
Aberdeen, notably the trees by the art gallery, though the birds in 1991 used
to fly 20km to the Hill o' Fare to roost in an environment more like home. But
don't get the next train north; if they're in Scotland they could be anywhere.
They do like to stick around for a wee while at least, so it would be worth
ringing Birdline Scotland (0891 700 234) to find out where they are. Or you
could just plant some cotoneasters and wait a decade or two.
In a waxwing year they will be with us till mid-April. A big flock seems out of
place in a warm garden full of tulips but they know there is not much point in
turning up at the Arctic Circle when the conifer branches are still bent with
snow and not an insect has hatched. Enjoy them then, because you may not see
them again until you are a lot older. And enjoy them now, with a final festive
thought: waxwings have a rare ability to metabolise the alcohol in the
fermenting fruit they eat. A good excuse, if one were needed, to reach for the
Speyside malt and toast the compliments of the season of berries to them - and
many happy returns.

Christmas just wouldn0t be the same without an appearance from the animated
duo, Wallace and Gromit ALLAN LAING discovers the secret behind creator Nick
Park's ideas
IT HAD been a bad year for Britain's movie industry. Twelve Oscar nominations -
including names like Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, and Daniel Day-Lewis - and
what did we end up with? Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Unless of course, you counted
Nick Park. "Nick who?" we asked this one.
Well it was in 1994 and, at the same time, we could all be forgiven for being
blissfully unaware of the name (even though it was, amazingly, his second
Academy award). No excuses now, mind you. Now he's famous. Almost as famous, in
fact, as the 6-inch plasticine figures he created. Suddenly it seems that
Christmas television isn't Christmas television without his wonderfully odd
couple, Wallace And Gromit.
Right now Hollywood executive, cheque-books in hand, are beating the path to
the door of this supremely talented animator's Bristol studio with lucrative
offers for a full-length feature film. But under these circumstances, Park's
unassuming nature and self-effacing modesty makes him not his own worst enemy,
but his own best friend. Figures of #30m have apparently been mentioned, but he
steadfastly refuses to entertain Tinseltown's seductive overtures.
A wise move because Wallace, the quirky inventor who always looks on the
bright side, and his sardonic wuffless dog gromit, would not travel at all well
across the Atlantic. They're so quintessentially "oop North" English. Like Park
himself.
He's Preston born and bred - and therein lies the secret of his characters'
success. The inspiration for his animated films, which owe more to the Ealing
comedies of the forties and fifties than they do to the saccharine and scmmalts
of Disney, is drawn from his own childhood memories. A Lancashire hotpot of old
fashioned humour, quaint custom, and quirky circumstance.
He has shrewdly touched a nerve in all of us, young and old. Wallace and
Gromit cross the barriers of class, intellect, and generation. They are of
universal appeal. A funny-bone is a funny-bone no matter whose arm it's
connected to.
Park's interest in film is inherited from his father, an architectural
photographer. When junior was 11, his old man bought a cine-camera for family
use. The inventive son used it to bring his cartoons to life. After art school
in Sheffield, he enrolled in the National Film and Television School where he
worked on his first professional animation - A Grand Day Out in which a man and
his dog attempted to reach the moon. For the characters he went back to some
scribbled drawings he'd made years before when he was trying to write a
children's book about a cat and a postman. The postie, who bore a striking
resemblance to his father, became Wallace and the cat turned into a dog.
Wallace and Gromit were born.
It cost just #12,000 and it was supposed to be his graduation film but since
it took six years to make, Park had left the school a long time before it
finished. The Bristol-based animation production house, Aardrman Films, took
him on to make television ads (and allowed him to finish his film during his
spare time). At the same time Park started working on a second and slightly
shorter film, Creature Comforts, in which animated plasticine animals lip-sinc
with real-people conversations.
Both films were completed in 1989 and, much to their creator's surprise, both
were nominated for Academy awards. In the end it was Creature Comforts which
gained the Oscar while A Grand Day Out earned itself a BAFTA. The success
afforded Park the luxury of being able to write his own cheque (from the BBC)
for Wallace and Gromit's next outing. The Wrong Trousers was a 30-minute film,
made on a budget of #600,000. To date it has won no less than 30 international
awards - including Park's second Oscar. Indeed, it is arguably the most
successful British animated film of all time.
Park's latest offering, A Close Shave, which will be screened on BBC2 on
Christmas Eve, is his most ambitious to date. It cost #1.3m (sounds a lot but,
in animation terms, it's still peanuts) and has been made at the Bristol
studios by a team of more than 50. Park himself deliberately stood back from
the animation work, preferring instead to direct the project.
He explains: "Like most animators I'd developed a very individual approach
over the years but that's gradually changed. It's not easy because the Wallace
and Gromit thing has evolved in a very personal style which I have had to
`give' to other people. I give them direction and guidance, about what I want,
which I find difficult because I'm not an extrovert.
"Still, I suppose working this way has dragged me out of my shell a bit."
When it came to edition A Close shave, the team was forced to make some
difficult decision. "About five minutes of animation had to be left out which
was very painful.
"It's very hard to look at a sequence dispassionately and not think about who
animated, how long it took them, and what difficulties they had. But I hate
making decisions on the studio floor so I'm always asking for things to be shot
a bit longer so there's leeway to edit," he said.
The smart money is now on Park developing his gruesome twosome into a
feature-length movie but the man himself is worried that, in doing so his
quirky vision could get lost along the way. But despite the interest from
America, he's determined that it won't be made in Hollywood.
"Actually, I think the Americans realise, as much as we do that there's
something very important about being based here. There's a certain sort of
British humour and way of looking at life that we'd risk losing if we went over
there.
"But there's been a lot of interest from Hollywood and I think what's really
caught their attention is the story aspect of our films. That's akways been the
weakness of British animation, but the way we develop our scripts seems to work
very well," he added.
A Close Shave will be shown on BBC2 on Christmas Eve. The Wrong Trousers and
A Grand Day Out can also be seen on BBC2, with Creature Comforts shown on
Channel 4, all later in the festive period.
