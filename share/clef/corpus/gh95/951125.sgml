Fever strikes
MONROVIA: Liberia's government has warned against travel to the port town of
Buchanan, where an outbreak of yellow fever has killed 23 people. Some 350
civil war refugees are infected, health officials say.
Fans flock
BAGHDAD: The streets of the Iraqi capital Baghdad were all but deserted
yesterday as 60,000 fans crammed into a stadium for 40,000 to watch the first
big football match between Iraq and Iran for 20 years. Iraq's Talaba beat
Iran's Bahman club 2-1 on aggregate in the Asian Football Club Championship.

JUDGMENT was reserved yesterday in the appeal by two Scottish soldiers serving
life imprisonment for murdering a Belfast teenager.
Scots Guards James Fisher and Mark Wright were convicted at Belfast Crown Court
last February, of murdering Mr Peter McBride, 18, in the New Lodge area in
September 1992.
When the week-long appeal ended yesterday, the Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian
Hutton said it would take some time to deliver judgment because of the detailed
submissions he and the two other judges had to consider.
``We will try to deliver judgment as soon as possible,'' he added.
Fisher, 27, from Glendale Place, Belmont, Ayr, and Wright, 22, from Arbroath,
Tayside, admitted at their trial that they shot Mr McBride as he ran away.
They denied murdering him and said they opened fire because they thought their
lives were in danger as they believed he was carrying a ``coffee jar'' bomb.
Lawyers for the soldiers claimed that vital witnesses had lied in their
evidence because they were hostile to the British Army.
However, the Crown argued that Lord Justice Kelly, who presided at the non-jury
trial, was entitled to convict the soldiers on the basis of all the evidence in
the case.
The soldiers were taken back to Maghaberry Prison, near Lisburn, where they
have been held since they began their life sentences.

AN Orangeman travelled from Scotland to Liverpool for the 12th of July march
and a gun deal, a court was told yesterday.
Mr John Johnston, one of six men on trial on charges involving terrorist
activities, was trying to buy two rifles, it was alleged.
When the deal was done, it was alleged, Mr Johnston said he was going to
contact a flute band to get the guns to Ireland.
Mr Johnston, 49, of Campbell Crescent, Laurieston, Falkirk, a former master of
his local Orange Lodge, is on trial accused of conspiring to further the cause
of the Ulster Volunteer Force by acquiring weapons to endanger life or cause
serious damage to property.
The five other accused are Francis Hives, 45, of Liverpool; William McArthur,
42, of Bonnybridge; David White, 29, of Airdrie; Alexander Davidson, 23, and
Lindsay Robb, 28, both from Lurgan in Northern Ireland.
Mr Johnston's alleged gun dealing activities were revealed to the High Court in
Glasgow by his friend Henry Hardie, 46, of Park Avenue, Laurieston, who is also
a past master of the local Orange Lodge.
Mr Hardie told Mr Ian Bonomy QC, prosecuting, that Mr Johnston organised dances
for the Loyalist Prisoners Welfare Association, at which hooded paramilitaries
urged help from their Scottish comrades to win the ``long and bloody war'' in
Northern Ireland.
Mr Hardie also alleged that Lindsay Robb showed him a handgun when he went to
Ireland to visit him.
Cross-examined by Mr Robb's defence QC, Mr Donald Findlay, Mr Hardie said he
would not be surprised to learn that the RUC had given Mr Robb a gun perfectly
legally for personal protection purposes.
Mr Hardie, who said that he spent much of his time in Liverpool drunk, admitted
that Mr Johnston ``talked a good game'' and liked people to see him as a man in
the know who knew people of influence.
He said people took what he said with a pinch of salt.
The trial continues.

Arms plant
rocked by
fresh blasts
BUENOS AIRES: A series of explosions yesterday rocked an arms factory in
central Argentina where a blast earlier this month killed seven people and
injured 330.
Defence Minister Oscar Camilion told reporters the new explosions were caused
by ``spontaneous combustion'', but added that there was no damage to the plant
or its employees.
Police urged residents of Rio Tercero, in Cordoba province, to evacuate the
area. However citizens, remembering the November 3 blast that pelted the area
with shrapnel and bombs, were reportedly evacuating the town.
``We heard an explosion and then saw a smoke mushroom similar to the one we saw
the day of the tragedy,'' said one resident.-Reuter.

Colombo
SRI LANKA'S state-run National News Agency said today that up to 500 civilians
were killed on Wednesday when a truck being loaded with explosives by Tamil
rebels blew up in a northern guerrilla-held town.
State television reported that about 100 guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were among more than 500 people killed in the blast in
Chavakachcheri, about 10 miles east of the rebel bastion of Jaffna.
However other sources put the death toll much lower. Western aid workers in
Colombo said they had information that four Tiger rebels were killed and 67
people were taken to hospital for treatment.
Sri Lankan Army officials said there had been an explosion in which civilians
might have been killed but a spokesman said: ``Chavakachcheri is under rebel
control. We have no way of getting a first-hand confirmation.''
The National News Agency quoted a Tamil civilian who crossed into the
government-held town of Vavuniya as reporting the 500 deaths.
Other civilians who arrived in Vavuniya from Chavakachcheri said that nine
guerrillas were killed. They said nothing about civilian deaths in
Chavakachcheri, a northern coastal camp for civilians fleeing the fighting in
Jaffna.
The Sri Lankan Army said it planned to recruit 10,000 troops to help tighten
its grip on the Jaffna peninsula and prepare for what it hoped would be a final
onslaught against the rebels.
Military spokesman Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe said the army hoped to complete
the recruiting drive within a month.
The campaign is being matched by LTTE rebels, who have opened centres in areas
under their control and are seeking young fighters.
Eleven soldiers were killed today when rebels attacked an army foot patrol at
Punani in the eastern Batticaloa district, the military said.
The army cut off Jaffna town completely this week, leaving no way of escape for
about 2000 guerrillas holed up there.-Reuter.

Sarajevo
BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said tonight that his people welcomed
peace and had achieved their goals in the Ohio agreement to end the war
``It is good for peace to begin, for our people to live in peace,'' he told
Bosnian Serb television.
``I can say we achieved our goal: we have half of Bosnia, more than 40 cities,
and also good land,'' he said.
Earlier in north-west Bosnia, Bosnian government troops looted a UN base as
Nato stood by to deploy the advance guard of a much tougher international force
to police the peace deal.
There was no hiding Bosnian Serb resentment over elements of the deal
negotiated on their behalf by their Serb paymaster, President Slobodan
Milosevic.
Karadzic warned that the planned handover of Serb suburbs of Sarajevo to the
Muslim-Croat federation would lead to further fighting unless it was
renegotiated.
``We accepted peace but we will search for a solution to Sarajevo,'' he said in
his first public comment on the Dayton agreement.
Senior Bosnian Serb hardliner Momcilo Krajisnik said on the same programme that
Milosevic had left him on the sidelines for 15 days at Dayton. He accused the
Serbian leader of being only interested in the lifting of UN sanctions on his
country.
``We accept the peace,'' Karadzic told this evening's broadcast aimed at
persuading diehard rebels that their leaders did their best and all further
armed resistance would be futile.
Leaders of Serb-held Sarajevo suburbs have vowed to fight to defend them, but
Karadzic said: ``The time has come to use political means to achieve our
goals.''
Looking subdued and sombre Krajisnik said ``Milosevic outvoted us'' on the
issue of deploying Nato troops on Serb-held land, something the rebels were
against.
The Serbian president also agreed to a giveaway of territory in western Bosnia
which the rebels had wanted to hold on to, he said.
Bosnian government troops looted a UN base in north-west Bosnia. A UN spokesman
said 200 soldiers fired machineguns over the heads of Bangladeshi peacekeepers
guarding the base.
There were also reports from UN officials that Croat forces were burning and
looting houses in an area of north-west Bosnia which is scheduled to revert to
Serb control under the peace agreement.
UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon said Bosnian government troops had
entered a Bangladeshi-manned base at Velika Kladusa in the Bihac enclave and
carried off equipment including nine vehicles.
``Bosnian Army personnel entered the camp and effectively went through the camp
taking what they thought fit against the protests of the Bangladeshis,'' Vernon
said.
The 80 Bangladeshi peacekeepers were spending their last night in the camp,
which was due to be handed over to the British.
The incidents of looting and burning came as UN peacekeepers prepared to
withdraw from Bosnia to make way for Nato combat troops, or change helmets and
come under Nato command. The Nato troops are expected to have much more
aggressive rules of engagement than the UN force.
Alliance sources in Brussels said Nato may get a green light soon, possibly
early next week, to send advance units of the 60,000-strong peacekeeping force
to Bosnia and Croatia.
Their job would be to check out roads, bridges, and communications links needed
by I-FOR, the Nato-led Implementation Force which will be the biggest ground
operation ever mounted by the Alliance.
US Defence Secretary William Perry made clear today that the full-scale Nato
force would operate all over Bosnia, including in Bosnian Serb-held areas which
were mainly closed to UN peacekeepers.-Reuter/AP

POLICEWOMAN Julie Kirkpatrick had heard Glasgow's reputation for mean streets
and violent characters.
However, the policewoman didn't expect to be threatened with a loaded gun only
three days after leaving training college.
Despite her inexperience, Ms Kirkpatrick, 26, had no hesitation in giving chase.
Yesterday, Ms Kirkpatrick and Constable Kenneth McCann, 34, received bravery
citations at an awards ceremony at Strathclyde Police Headquarters.
Ms Kirkpatrick and Mr McCann were on patrol in June last year, three days after
Ms Kirkpatrick completed her training, when they saw three men arguing outside
a pub. As the pair approached the group, one of the men pulled out a
semi-automatic pistol.
He ran off, with the two officers chasing him.
``He threw the gun away but we managed to catch him and get him to the
ground,'' said Mr McCann.
At yesterday's ceremony, Constable Peter Wands received a Royal Humane Society
Resuscitation Certificate.
Mr Wands was on patrol in January when he saved the life of a 17-month-old baby
who had stopped breathing.
The officer gave the boy heart massage and almost certainly saved the baby's
life.
Three detectives also received bravery citations for foiling the armed robbery
of a sub post-office in Newarthill.
The only British policeman to have been shot with a machine-gun picked up a top
bravery award yesterday - and said he believed the time had come for routine
arming of officers.
Detective Sergeant Michael Stubbs collected a High Commendation at a ceremony
at New Scotland Yard.He had been hit in the temple by a bullet from an
Czech-made 9mm sub-machine gun during a pursuit of armed robbers in south
London.

MORE than 400 Scottish pupils yesterday made a bid for chart success when they
recorded their own Christmas record, with proceeds going to children's
charities.
The children, from Craigie-barns Primary School, Dundee, have recorded two
festive songs, already a hit with parents who have ordered   hundreds of copies
of the              cassette.
Head teacher Ethel Sharp explained: ``We thought it would be a good idea to get
the children more involved in music and raise some money for children's
charities.''
Nursery Rhymes and Santa I'm all Shiver and Shake, were written by Dundee
record producer Bryce Wilder.

BUS drivers in Scotland have called for an international investigation into the
number of UK holidaymakers who die in Continental coach crashes.
They are urging European politicians to set up a committee to examine issues
such as drivers' work schedules and the age of vehicles.
The call came from the T&amp;G union's Scottish bus workers' annual conference in
Glasgow where delegates representing more than 9000 staff expressed serious
concern.
``Most people who travel to the Continent think that when they arrive at the
airport or ferry terminal, the most dangerous part of their journey has been
completed,'' said Mr Des Divers of the Glasgow passenger district committee.
``But, as we know, in many instances the most dangerous part is just
beginning.''
Between 1989 and 1993, 138 people had been killed and 714 seriously injured in
coach accidents on European roads, he said, and the union was awaiting
publication of the latest figures, which it feared would show a dramatic rise.
It wants prosecution of coach companies who force drivers to work impossible
schedules. By doing so, such operators make drivers risk their own and their
passengers' lives through driver fatigue.

<TEXT>
Two drug dealers were each jailed for 30 years yesterday for an international
#125m cocaine smuggling plot.
George Sansom, 42, the cousin of ex-England football star Kenny Sansom, was in
charge of marketing the drug while ``money man'' Coleman Mulkerrins, 53,
masterminded the operation.
Amid tight security at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, Judge Andrew
Brooks told the pair he had a duty to protect young people who may be tempted
by the ``dreadful drug'' and mentioned the tragic recent case of Leah Betts.
The defendants showed no emotion when they were sentenced.
The court heard that Mulkerrins put up #200,000 in June 1992 to buy a ship to
transport cocaine.
The vessel loaded the drugs off the coast of Venezuela. It docked in Charlton,
London, in November 1992.
The 795-kilo consignment was loaded into a van which was driven to a lock-up in
Deptford, said prosecutor Anthony Glass QC.
Then the cocaine, which had been the subject of a 12-month surveillance
operation, was seized.
At that stage, six men, mainly members of the ship's crew, were arrested.
Mulkerrins was arrested in May last year while Sansom was only recently
extradited from Spain.
Father-of-two Sansom, who called his cousin Kenny Sansom as a character witness
in his trial, had been living with his family in Tenerife.
In June this year, a jury hearing Mulkerrins' and Sansom's trial at Snaresbrook
Crown Court was given round-the-clock police protection.
However, a month into the trial the jury was discharged after complaints of
``unwarranted attention''.
The case was transferred to Norwich Crown Court, where the jury convicted
Mulkerrins and Sansom of being knowingly concerned in the illegal importation
of cocaine.
Mulkerrins, of Twickenham, and Sansom, of West Dulwich, both London, denied the
charge and maintained they had nothing to do with the drugs plot.

A DOUBLE stroke of luck brought the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra to Metz
last night for the concluding concert of their mini-tour of France.
Earlier in the day, it had looked as though the SSO might have been stranded in
Bordeaux because of a 36-hour national transport strike. The orchestra was
supposed to have flown to Metz on a charter flight that wasn't there.
The SSO had gone to Bordeaux airport early yesterday morning without any real
hope of getting a flight north.
Provisional arrangements had been made to abandon the last concert in Metz and
keep the orchestra in Bordeaux for another night. The courier representing the
Paris-based IMG Group - the promoters of the tour - spent yesterday morning on
the telephone and found a single flight operating towards midday from Bordeaux
to Orly airport in Paris. It contained enough vacant seats for the 87 people in
the orchestra party.
Then the courier hired three coaches to pick them up in Paris in the early
afternoon for a four-hour motorway journey to Metz.
``We had some luck with finding a plane and then we had some more luck with
getting coaches,'' said the courier. She said she had no idea how the
replacement flight and the coaches would be paid for. The bills, she said,
would be sent to IMG in Paris who presumably would have contingency insurance
arrangements.
The SSO arrived at their hotel in Metz only an hour and a half before the start
of the concert, where they were performing James MacMillan's percussion
concerto with Evelyn Glennie.
The SSO is due to fly home this morning, though it was not clear yesterday
afternoon if the backlog of air traffic would cause a delay, or if the
orchestra's charter plane would arrive in Metz.
Michael Tumelty reports on the BBC SSO tour in Monday's arts page.

A MALE nurse, called to give help at the scene of a school bus accident
yesterday, found his daughter dead at the side of the road.
Emma Seaton, 11, died as she crossed the road from the bus with sister Ruth,
nine, who saw Emma being struck by a passing van and thrown into the air.
Emma and Ruth would normally have cycled the mile-and-a-half from the family
home in the Loch Ness village of Dores to 17-pupil Aldourie primary. However,
because of a planned school outing to ballet later in the day at Eden Court
Theatre, in Inverness, the girls left their bikes at home and had gone by bus
instead.
They lived with their father Tim, 32, mother Heidi, 30, and year-old baby
brother, Duncan.
Mr Seaton, a staff nurse at Craig Phadrig Hospital, Inverness, said: ``I got a
phone call from a lady living in the house opposite the school to come quickly
because there had been a bad accident.
``I thought this was probably an exaggeration but when I got there, I found
Emma lying on the verge where she had landed.
``I checked her over and found her to be dead, killed instantly I would think.
I then carried her into the school to lay her down in privacy.''
Mr Seaton, son of an Inverness United Reformed Baptist minister, the Rev
William Seaton, added: ``The whole family is devastated.''
Mrs Janice MacBeth, the head teacher, immediately closed the school for the day
and the children, shocked by the tragedy on their doorstep, were sent home.
Some older children who were being taken farther on to Inverness Royal Academy
in the town also had to return home.
The Seatons are neighbours of Mrs Audrey Gillies, whose daughter, Michelle, 24,
was killed three weeks ago along with her boyfriend in a car crash on the
Dundee-Perth road.
The postmistress, Mrs Lily Donald, said: ``One of the neighbours had to sit
with Mrs Gillies. This just brought back her own very recent family tragedy.
``Emma was a lovely, cheery wee girl just full of life. She was a keen fiddler
and a member of the harriers in Inverness.''
The van was driven by car mechanic Neil Ellis, from the nearby village of
Foyers. Police said later that a report was being prepared for the
procurator-fiscal.

<HEADLINE>Judge allows child to live in free-love religious sect with history of abuse Boy to stay with cult mother</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975208462</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A 28-YEAR-OLD mother was yesterday given permission by a senior judge to bring
up her three-year-old son in a notorious free-love religious sect with a
history of child abuse.
In a controversial judgment, Lord Justice Ward said he accepted that the
Children of God - now known as The Family - had changed and had ``come in from
the cold''.
He accepted assurances from the mother and sect leaders that they had turned
their backs on the past and on the evil teachings of their late founder, who
was condemned by the judge as a sex-obsessed child molester and pornographer.
The Family had been told by the judge that its only hope of salvation in law
was to denounce its beloved ``father'', David ``Moses'' Berg, and admit he was
wrong to promote child sex as part of his ``Law of Love''.
Berg, regarded by followers as a prophet, died at the age of 75 last November.
The sect's worldwide membership at that time included 100 adults and 194
children in the UK.
The judge said the worst excesses of Berg's corrupt teachings had been purged
many years before. ``They have come in from the cold. They carry some mud from
the past on their coat but, if they choose, they can wash it off.
``Then they can sit at society's supper table, eccentric guests perhaps, but
welcome for all that. We must all be ready to welcome the return of the
prodigal son,'' he said.
The ruling came after a bitter and costly lawsuit brought by the child's
58-year-old grandmother, who had the boy, referred to only as S, made a ward of
court eight days after his birth.
During a 75-day private court hearing last year - a record for a wardship case
- the judge heard from disaffected former members of the 12,000-strong
worldwide sect.
In the damning 135,000-word judgment handed down earlier this year and made
public yesterday, Lord Justice Ward said The Family had to come to terms with
its past before the High Court would allow the boy to remain with his mother.
Its leaders must recognise that, in the past, children had been harmed by
``sexually inappropriate behaviour'' amounting to widespread abuse.
Granting the mother care and control of S, the judge said he would remain a
ward of court and must live within the court's jurisdiction so his progress
could be monitored.
The Family, which describes itself as a fellowship of independent Christian
missionary communities, currently has nearly 300 members in the UK, two-thirds
of whom are children. The sect rents six properties in Scotland, England, and
Ireland, in which family groups live together.
Spokeswoman Rachel Scott said most of the events referred to had happened a
long time ago in other countries and many allegations had been discounted or
disproved in criminal cases.
However, Family Action Information and Resource, which monitors cults, called
on members of The Family to denounce Berg and warned it would prove virtually
impossible to ensure undertakings given to the judge would be upheld.

A teacher whose dangerous driving left one man dead and four seriously injured,
will have to wait three weeks to find out his fate.
Car passenger John Hannah, 56, of Sycamore Avenue, Beith, Ayrshire, died after
the head-on smash with a car driven by physical education teacher Donald
Henderson.
A jury heard that the vehicle in which Mr Hannah was travelling was momentarily
hidden from view in a dip in the road as Henderson's car pulled out over double
white lines to overtake on wrong side of the road.
Henderson, 41, an assistant principal guidance teacher at Renfrew High School,
was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving after trial at Paisley
Sheriff Court.
Henderson himself was in a coma for two days in Southern General Hospital and
spent a further two months in hospital recovering from head injuries.
Four of the injured had to be freed from the wreckage by firefighters.
Sheriff David Pender deferred sentence for three weeks and called for social
inquiry reports and a community service assessment. Henderson was released on
bail.

penalty,'' said Tokyo Sexwale, leader of the Gauteng province, as he comforted
the family of British-born businessman Jeremy Bennett, who was shot dead by car
hijackers on Tuesday.
``This thing must go to a referendum. It hurts nobody, it's part of
democracy,'' said Mr Sexwale.
Former president F.W de Klerk ordered a moratorium on executions in February
1990. This year judges ruled that the death penalty violated South Africa's new
democratic constitution and its Bill of Rights.
Mr Sexwale echoed calls by Justice Minister Dullah Omar for merciless
prosecution of car hijackers, who struck 28 times in two days in Gauteng this
week alone.
Mr Bennett, who moved to South Africa in the 1970s, was shot dead in front of
his 10-year-old daughter Samantha as he stopped his car outside the family's
Johannesburg home.
One of three men who approached the car shot Mr Bennett in the head through the
front window. The men fled in another vehicle but police said their intention
had been to steal Mr Bennett's car.-Reuter.

SCOTLAND'S eight police forces began breath-testing drivers yesterday at the
start of their 10th annual crackdown on festive drink driving.
The 41-day campaign, which will be launched officially on Monday in Paisley,
got under way at 7am and will run until 7am on Wednesday, January 3.
Police chiefs are hopeful of improving on last year's drink-driving figures,
which saw a total of 1101 drivers proving positive or refusing to take a test -
2.3% of the total of 47,566 drivers stopped during the campaign.
Last year's figure was higher than the 2% of the previous year, although the
number of drivers testing positive or refusing to take a test in 1993/94 was
1121 - 20 more than in 1994/95.
The theme of this year's campaign will again be ``Drinking and driving wrecks
lives'' but it will include the message ``Don't drive - dial'' - a reference to
a campaign featured on 20,000 posters and seven million cards urging motorists
to use other means of transport if they want to drink alcohol.

Strasbourg
THE controversial rave-scene stimulant Ecstasy has become the favourite
recreation drug after cannabis for West European young people, according to a
report to the Council of Europe.
Two researchers from Amsterdam, Dirk Korf and Barend Werth, noted that while
occasional users of the synthetic drug tend to be well-educated, many on the
margins of society now take bigger and more frequent doses.
``Ecstasy has been reported most frequently as the new drug trend in Europe
although this is largely confined to Western Europe where ecstasy has become
the second most popular drug next to cannabis among young people,'' the report
said.
A panel of the 38-nation Council was also told by criminal experts today that
the consumption of Ecstasy at raves was creating new public order problems.
Belgian police lieutenant Michel Ost said a report showed that about 20% of
road accident victims were under the influence of Ecstasy.
Earlier this year, US researchers found new evidence that consumption of the
drug could cause permanent brain damage leading to mood disturbances.
``We mustn't sow panic,'' said Ernst Buning, a drug specialist from Amsterdam.
``The number of deaths directly linked to Ecstasy in Europe is below the 100
level. It is negligible compared with alcohol and nicotine.''-Reuter.

SCOTTISH higher education is a big business in its own right, generating
millions of pounds of income and many thousands of jobs, according to a major
report published yesterday.
The findings will be used by university and college principals to bolster their
campaign against further cuts in Government funding, planned over the next
three years.
Professor John Arbuthnott, convener of the body which commissioned the report -
the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals - warned that a further
squeeze on resources would be damaging for a sector which had shown itself to
be highly successful, and impressive in the way it gave value for money.
The report on the impact of Scottish higher education on Scotland's economy, by
Strathclyde University economist Professor Iain McNicoll, proved once and for
all that universities and colleges were not ivory towers, Professor Arbuthnott
said.
The report, based on the latest figures for income and expenditure in
higher-education institutions, shows they had an income of #1100m, with #793m
from the public purse, and the remainder from the private sector and overseas.

EVERTON and Scotland footballer Duncan Ferguson was released from Glasgow's
Barlinnie Prison yesterday after serving exactly half of a three-month prison
sentence.
The former Rangers striker was one of 35 prisoners released before dawn from
the Victorian-built jail but was the only one to be picked up by a
chauffeur-driven limousine.
The hired burgundy Daimler, sent up to collect him by his club, is understood
to have ferried the 23-year-old footballer straight back to Merseyside, where
he remained in hiding last night.
Everton manager Joe Royle refused to comment on the player's whereabouts at an
informal players' lunch at Goodison Park yesterday. He would only say: ``We are
talking football today. Nothing about Duncan at the moment.''
The club is still discussing whether to lodge a petition for a judicial review
of Ferguson's 12-match suspension by the Scottish Football Association, arguing
that he is being forced to serve his punishment twice over. That move would
effectively suspend his ban until the review is completed and would free him to
play.
It had been suggested that the player would put in an appearance before
Everton's home match against Sheffield Wednesday at Goodison today. However, a
club spokeswoman said yesterday he would not attend the match and that he would
resume training on Monday.
A media posse had pursued Ferguson's limousine as far as the M6 motorway after
it left Barlinnie yesterday but lost contact with the vehicle near Penrith,
Cumbria.
The Daimler had swept out of the prison at 6.35am, whisking Ferguson past 30
journalists and four diehard Everton supporters who had earlier driven north
from Liverpool to see him being released.
The limousine, which had tinted windows and black curtains to thwart
photographers, had been parked inside the prison overnight with the driver
returning to Barlinnie early yesterday to pick up the player.
Scottish Prison Service spokesman John Gerrie defended Ferguson's release
procedure as a ``perfectly normal arrangement'' for any high-profile or
celebrity prisoner.
The four Everton supporters set out on the 200-mile trip north at 2am yesterday.
Ferguson made football history by becoming the first professional footballer to
be jailed for an on-the-field assault on a fellow player. He was sent to
Barlinnie on October 11 when three appeal judges ruled the three-month sentence
he received for headbutting John McStay was not excessive.

Operators Caledonian MacBrayne, who run the service jointly with Manx company
Steam Packet, disclosed the reprieve at a travel exhibition in London.
The weekly crossing had faced being scrapped in September after both companies

JUNIOR doctors on night duty at Glasgow Royal Infirmary face a return to
vending machine cuisine because an extension to canteen hours was a financial
flop.
The overnight service, which ran from 10pm to 1am, is likely to be withdrawn
because of what the management say is a poor uptake by staff.
However, junior doctors' representative Nizam Mamode, a vascular surgery
registrar, said yesterday: ``We are extremely angry about this. The trust does
not seem to understand that junior doctors are often on their feet all day and
most of the night. They require the basic right of a hot meal.
``If the service is withdrawn, doctors' only access to food overnight in the
entire hospital will be a poorly stocked vending machine.''
A hospital spokesman said: ``This service didn't exist until it was introduced
as a three-month experiment. We are the only hospital in Scotland providing
this service.
``The three months is up and we have extended it but we are looking at whether
it is possible to continue. We have about 250 people working here overnight but
we were finding that 32 nurses and eight doctors were turning up.''

A TWO-YEAR-OLD girl suffering from severe scalding wasnot taken for hospital
treatment by her foster carer for two days, a court heard yesterday.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was eventually taken to the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, where it was found she had
suffered scalding to more than 23% of her body.
Haddington Sheriff Court heard it alleged that the accident happened when carer
Lana Hillhouse, 34, went to answer a telephone call.
The court also heard that parts of the child's legs, which had to be skin
grafted, may be scarred for life.
Mrs Hillhouse denies having, on August 12, caused the girl unnecessary
suffering by leaving her neglected and unattended in a bath of running hot
water and failing to seek medical attention when the accident happened.
Mrs Hillhouse, of Grange Crescent East, Prestonpans, East Lothian, also denies
an alternative charge of recklessly placing the child in a bath, turning on
mixer taps, allowing the bath to fill with water, then walking out of the
bathroom leaving the infant unattended, whereby the child was scalded by hot,
running water.
Burns specialist Dalvi Humzah, the plastic surgeon called to treat the girl,
said the injuries were consistent with sitting in a bath of hot water.
Mr Humzah said the child had suffered superficial second degree burns.
The court heard that the specialist had allegedly been told by Mrs Hillhouse
that she had got engaged in a telephone call while the child was in the bath.
It was claimed the foster carer heard screams and ran to the bathroom.
Mr Humzah, 31, alleged that Mrs Hillhouse informed him she had patted the child
dry and applied a cream to the skin. Two days later, it was claimed, after the
child took ill and had been vomiting, Mrs Hillhouse had taken the infant to
hospital.
The trial  was adjourned.

Paris
UP TO 100,000 people marched in protest along the boulevards on the right bank
of Paris yesterday, releasing balloons, carrying dummies stuffed with tubes to
represent the sick state of France's welfare system, and singing ``Juppe Bye
Bye'' to the tune of ``Johnny Be Good''.
Nicole Notat, leader of the socialist-leaning CFDT union, had angered many of
her members by approving the recent government scheme of welfare reform and had
to be protected by bodyguards.
They were not numerous or big enough, and when the boos turned to blows, Notat
had to be taken to safety: for yesterday's strike and marches by public sector
and some private sector workers were not only the biggest nationwide protest in
many years, they were also by far the angriest.
When France goes on strike, Paris usually does most of the protesting, but
yesterday the whole country was out. Not only the big provincial cities, but
towns of middling size, from Cherbourg in Normandy to Mulhouse in the east,
staged demonstrations. There were even 20,000 marchers in Bordeaux, the
eminently respectable city of which Prime Minister Alain Juppe is mayor. And
15,000 people took to the streets of quiet, conservative Tours.
Communications throughout the country seized up. There were virtually no
Metros, buses, or suburban trains in Paris, and people struggling into work
transformed the city's streets into a gigantic growling traffic jam. The rail
network and the domestic airline Air Inter were all but idle and Air France
only flew long-distance. The Channel Tunnel Eurostar train was blocked
yesterday morning and there were no ferries between Calais and Dover or Corsica
and Marseille.
Schools stayed open, but only to house children who turned up, not to teach
them. Hospitals ensured only emergency services, electricity and gas workers
were off, there was no post, and, because of the stoppage by print workers, no
newspapers either.
This was far, far more than the thought of grumbling that Prime Minister Juppe
had steeled himself for 10 days ago in the National Assembly, when he announced
a wide-ranging plan to reform France's chronically-overdrawn welfare system. He
introduced across-the-board tax increases and changes to civil service
retirement schemes which allow employees to contribute for shorter periods than
people in the private sector.
Mr Juppe's right-wing parliamentary colleagues, joined in the event by a fringe
of the small socialist opposition in the National Assembly, were unanimous in
applauding his courage. Demoralised that the lowest popularity of any Prime
Minister since 1958, Mr Juppe had even been seen to smile. Yesterday, he was
called into the Elysee Palace for an unscheduled meeting with President Chirac
to discuss the extent of the damage.
The protest could have been even worse, had the trades union Force Ouvriere,
the most influential in the country's civil service, not preferred to call a
separate day of protest later. As it happened, many FO workers joined
yesterday's strike anyway.
All that upheaval is more than a sticky patch of protest against the
belt-tightening exercise whose benefits will soon show. Latest economic
provisions, published last week, are dire and show that the government's recent
measures could be little use in the long term after all.
Economic growth from April to September this year was under 1% and the outlook
for 1996 it even worse - worse in fact than anyone had expected. The
government's painfully worked out autumn budget, a report in Le Monde newspaper
suggested, could even become obsolete on account of the unexpected slowdown in
the economy, while the billions of pounds of extra taxes which Mr Juppe
announced in his recent welfare scheme could slow down consumer spending even
more.
The slightest drop in unemployment, meanwhile, still over the dangerous three
million mark, and which President Chirac promised so often and so loudly to
make his priority of priorities, looks now like an elusive hope indeed. By
sticking to that policy of maintaining the franc, cutting public spending, and
getting the economy into the appropriate shape to comply with the conditions
for a single European currency by 1999, Mr Juppe and President Chirac have
worked themselves into a corner. And with such deep and widespread anger in the
country, something, as those many thousands of people proved yesterday, has got
to give.

The father of Scotland's so-called Family from Hell is today starting another
stretch behind bars.
Gordon Graham was jailed for a total of 10 months after admitting two charges
of failing to provide a breath test, driving without proper insurance, and
driving while banned.
Graham, 40, was also given another life driving ban when he appeared from
custody at Peterhead Sheriff Court yesterday.
The court had heard earlier that Graham had a criminal record stretching back
15 years, including a ``substantial'' number of driving offences since 1988.
His solicitor, Mr Larry Flynn, claimed Graham was suffering from paranoia and
had threatened to take his own life.
Mr Flynn said Graham had set fire to one of his socks in a cell at the court
after the last hearing as he waited to be sent back to Craiginches Prison, in
Aberdeen.
Graham had burns to his lower leg requiring skin graft treatment and spent two
weeks under police guard at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, he added.
Earlier, Mr Flynn told the court: ``My client has made various remarks of a
suicidal nature to me. Since August, he has become a completely different
character.''
He said Graham had been heavily affected by his family's highly publicised
eviction from a council house in Glenrothes, Fife, earlier this year, following
complaints of anti-social behaviour.
After their eviction, Graham and his wife Anne and several of their children,
moved to the quiet Moray Firth village of Rosehearty, near Fraserburgh.
Mr Flynn asked Sheriff Kieran McLernan to consider a long period of probation
as an alternative to prison.
Handing down the sentence, Sheriff McLernan said Graham had had a number of
last chances to avoid prison and had not taken them.
``It took a conscious decision to move your family to the North-east and it
took a similar decision to drive while you knew you were banned for life.''

AN 18-year-old Scots university student is critically ill with meningitis.
Mr Christopher Scott, a first-year student at Stirling University, is in
Stirling Royal Infirmary intensive care unit. Mr Scott, said to be from
Falkirk, became ill on Thursday and was taken to hospital, where his condition
worsened overnight.
In Lincoln, five people have died and two are still seriously ill after
contracting the disease. Health officials in the city yesterday announced that
they were to start a major immunisation programme to halt the outbreak, which
started last month.
Friends who had come into contact with Mr Scott in the last 10 days have been
traced and given treatment. Last night, an appeal went out for those who may
have slipped through the net.
After consultation with public health officials, the principal of Stirling
University, Professor Andrew Miller, sent a statement to all 2000 students
resident in campus accommodation.
He said: ``Christopher was admitted to hospital on Thursday with meningitis.
Only a small group of people could be at risk of contracting the infection from
Christopher.
``To the best of our knowledge, these people have been traced and given the
appropriate treatment. Students sharing lecture theatres, dining halls, and
general accommodation are not at risk and do not require treatment.
``However, if they have had close personal contact with Christopher, for
example kissing, in the last 10 days, they should ring a special number or
contact their GP. Normally, such close contact does not give increased risk.''
Mr Miller said the symptoms to look out for were flu-like with severe headaches.
Stirling students who think they may be at risk have been told to contact their
GP or the porter or security at the university on 01786 467000.

ITALIAN media magnate Silvio Berlusconi said today that he would probably
refuse to appear before magistrates probing alleged illegal party financing by
his Fininvest company.
Berlusconi, due to stand trial in January on corruption charges related to the
Fininvest media empire, has repeatedly accused Milan anti-graft investigators
of waging a political campaign against him.
He told reporters at a news conference at his home outside Milan today that he
had been ordered by magistrates to appear for questioning on November 30, but
would refuse to turn up.
``I do not think I will present myself because I do not see the need to meet
people who are only trying to harm me,'' he said.
Berlusconi's running battle with Milan's ``Clean Hands'' team of anti-graft
magistrates broke new ground yesterday when Judge Maurizio Grigo ordered the
arrest of Giorgio Vanoni, finance director of foreign subsidiaries of Fininvest.
Vannoni is suspected of making a 10bn lire (#4.6m) payment to former socialist
premier Bettino Craxi in 1991 through a Panama-based company All Iberian, which
has links to Fininvest.
It is the first time investigators have alleged that money flowed directly from
Berlusconi's company into Craxi's coffers.
Berlusconi, Prime Minister for seven months last year and leader of the
centre-right Freedom Alliance, has denied any wrongdoing by Fininvest and
called the investigation an attempt to destroy him politically.
Berlusconi is due to stand trial in January with 11 other men on corruption
charges in a separate case.
Arrest warrants were also issued yesterday for Craxi, currently a fugitive in
Tunisia, and two close associates.
``The news we heard yesterday is false,'' Berlusconi said, adding that he had
no inten-tion of standing down as leader of the Freedom Alliance. ``Only 10
million citizens could      make me take a step backwards.''
He said All Iberian did not belong to Fininvest. The payment was not directed
at Craxi but was part of a contractual relationship with a Tunisian film
producer.
Judicial sources in Milan said investigators had a duty to question Berlusconi
because he was Fininvest's chairman at the time the alleged payment was made.
The claims of payments passing from the company to Craxi, the most despised
politician in Italy, could cause severe damage to Berlusconi's public image in
the build-up to an early General Election widely expected for early next year.
Berlusconi said earlier his friendship with Craxi was no secret.
``Everybody knows that I was a friend of Bettino Craxi,'' he said today. ``They
also know that Fininvest quite legally financed the Socialists and other
parties through publicity spots and discounted advertising.''-Reuter.

MAIL-order firms are reporting tens of thousands of pounds worth of business
being lost and the possibility of staff being laid off next week because of the
mail strike.
One firm, Scotland Direct, of Lanarkshire, is considering taking court action
against the leaders of the dispute.
Mr Arthur Bell, whose mail-order companies supply a range of goods including
gourmet foods, whiskies, and collectibles, said the situation was very serious,
with trade down by more than #20,000 a day.
Not only are his 65 staff dependent on a smooth flow of orders but hundreds of
other workers, who supply them with goods, will suffer financially.
``It is a very damaging and an immensely stupid dispute. It's putting at risk
the jobs of innocent people and the jobs of the postmen themselves,'' he said.
Mr Bell is to contact Trade Secretary Ian Lang to suggest that the Royal Mail's
monopoly on letter delivery should be ended.
``But I will have to fax it to him, as I can't post it to him,'' he added.
Ms Pollyanna Stokoe, Edinburgh manager of the Direct Marketing Association,
said it would not be long before firms were seriously affected by the strike.
She feared that clients from the south of England would think twice about
dealing with Scottish companies in the future, because of the additional risk
of disruption.
Mr Jim Torrance of cosmetic mail order firm, the Body Centre, in Fife, said:
``People in England don't know there is a strike up here and so their orders
are being caught up in the post and getting lost.''
He also is having to consider laying off staff.
In the general business field, ScottishPower is considering contingency plans
for putting out bills if the strike goes on. The power company mails out 20,000
a day.
Mr Bill Anderson, Scottish secretary of the Federation of Small Businesses,
said banks should take a lenient position with firms unable to pay in cheques
because they are caught up in the dispute.
However, some firms are bypassing some of the strike's effects by taking mail
directly to England for posting, and life assurance and pensions company
Scottish Widows has asked staff to volunteer to deliver mail personally to
local addresses.
q Students waiting for their loans to be processed by the Student Loans Company
are asked to contact the loans administrator at their university or college.

<HEADLINE>Court told of Ian Maxwell's `gamble' with pension fund</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975208480</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Old Bailey was told yesterday that Mr Ian Maxwell played a ``vital role''
in pledging shares to secure a loan for the ailing Maxwell empire, even though
he knew they belonged to the pension funds.
On the third day of his closing speech to the jury, prosecutor Alan Suckling
QC, said the Crown was not suggesting Mr Maxwell was the ``prime mover'' in
pledging shares worth #22m in the Israeli company Teva. However, he ``played a
vital role in securing the loan in an emergency''.
He said Mr Maxwell, 39, who has not given evidence, was ``plainly no fool''. He
was a director of most of the important companies in the group.
Mr Suckling said the evidence had been that Mr Maxwell normally took great care
to check what he was signing and frequently sought advice from the pension
funds' administrator on documents delivered for his signature.
Mr Suckling said, however, that he had not sought advice from the administrator
over the pledging of the Teva shares and like the other two defendants ``had
kept quiet about it''.
Mr Suckling claimed it was ``inconceivable'' that he had not been aware that
the shares belonged to the pensioners and not to the Robert Maxwell Group.
Mr Suckling said that, like the other defendants, he had been dishonest and
taken a gamble with the pension funds which he knew was not in the interests of
the pension funds ``in a last desperate effort to prop up the group which meant
so much to them''.
The third defendant, former Maxwell financial advisor Larry Trachtenberg, was a
director of BIM (Bishopsgate Investment Management) which administered the
pension fund, said Mr Suckling, and knew his duty was to manage shares for the
benefit of the pensioners - ``not to prop up a failing group with a risk the
shares might never be returned''.
Mr Maxwell, his brother Kevin, 36, and Mr Trachtenberg, 42, deny conspiracy to
defraud the pension funds. The trial continues.

Doctor
found no
mental
disorder
A DOCTOR called to examine a troubled teenager just a fortnight before she
hanged herself in jail dismissed her as an attention seeker, an inquiry heard
yesterday.
The joint inquiry into the deaths at Cornton Vale prison in June of Kelly
Holland and fellow inmate Arlene Elliot, both 17, heard that the un-named
doctor was called by a worried deputy prosecutor in Miss Holland's home town of
Hamilton.
Police had reported Miss Hamilton for breach of the peace after she twice tried
to throw herself out of a second-storey window.
Procurator-fiscal depute Stuart Cassidy told the inquiry he received a police
report on June 7 that Miss Holland had been found drinking in an empty flat in
Hamilton by two nearby residents.
They called police and tried to talk to her, but Miss Holland ran at the window
and tried to throw herself out.
She got the top half of her body out of the window before the men hauled her
back in.
Mr Cassidy said he remembered her from a previous case in which she had
vandalised teachers' cars at a local school and was found wandering around the
playground ``striking or stroking'' at her wrist with a piece of broken glass.
He said, as a lay person, he thought she might be mentally ill so he called a
doctor to examine her.
``The doctor told me that he didn't consider her to be suffering from any
mental disorder.......He used the phrase that she was an attention seeker,''
said Mr Cassidy.
``He said that he had dealt with her in the past and when he saw her on this
occasion she appeared to be in a better frame of mind than before.''
Mr Cassidy said he informed the social work department he was worried about
Miss Holland and released her after making sure there was a member of her
family at the court to see her home.
Two weeks later, she was re-arrested on a charge of breach of the peace and
remanded in custody to Cornton Vale. On June 23, she was found dead in her
cell, hanging from a noose torn from a bedsheet.
Sheriff Principal John Maguire, who is conducting the inquiry, asked Mr
Cassidy: ``You released her on the basis that prosecuting somebody for
attempting suicide is a somewhat bizarre predicament for the State?'' Mr
Cassidy replied: ``I just didn't think it would be appropriate.''
Earlier, the inquiry heard from consultant pathologist Dr Hosie Tavadia that it
would have taken Miss Holland a maximum of two minutes to die after putting the
noose round her neck.
The inquiry, at Stirling Sheriff Court, continues on Monday.

Moscow
THE Russian capital's emergency radiation detection system was on alert today
after a container of radioactive material allegedly planted by Chechen rebels
was found in Moscow park.
At the same time, officials scrambled to reassure the public there was nothing
to fear and Tass news agency said the monitoring system had not detected any
more hot spots.
``The container found in Moscow is not dangerous in any way,'' said Interior
Minister Anatoly Kulikov.
Independent NTV television, which unearthed the radioactive container in a
Moscow park yesterday, said Chechen rebel commander Shamil Basayev had revealed
the location earlier this month.
The Federal Security Service, a successor to the KGB, recovered the material
last night and was investigating. The container did not pose a danger to the
environment or to people, FSS spokesman Alexander Mikhailov told a news
conference.
He thanked NTV for turning it over, but chastised reporters for uncovering it
on their own. He said it could have been booby-trapped.
NTV has been highly critical of the Kremlin's 11-month war against separatist
Chechnya.
Federal officials identified the contents of the container as caesium 137, a
radioactive isotope used in cancer research and radiation therapy. It was not
clear if or how the Chechens intended to use it.
``This radiation level is not dangerous for passers-by, but if you keep it in
your pocket for two weeks, you will get cancer,'' said Vladimir Asmolov, head
of the Nuclear Safety Institute.
The Emergency Situations Ministry activated its a radiation detection system,
which consists of 46 mobile sensors throughout Moscow. Police were ordered to
step up checks on roads into Moscow and at railway stations.-AP.

PROBLEMS of serious breakdowns of discipline and management have affected a
child-care unit in Fife, an MP has claimed.
Mr Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Central Fife, has accused Fife's director of
social work, Mr Allan Bowman, and senior management of allowing the situation
to deteriorate. He is seeking an immediate inquiry into Rimbleton House in
Glenrothes. It houses and educates youngsters with a range of difficulties.
He claimed: ``Staff morale is at rock bottom and kids are going as they please
through the facility. There is a lack of discipline being exercised at
Rimbleton House and, as a result, young people are getting out.
``Rimbleton House is simply not functioning properly. I want to know why this
is the case and why the director of social work and senior management have
allowed the situation to deteriorate to such an extent.''
He believed the unit had been earmarked for closure but no closure time-scale
had been issued.
``There has been a serious breakdown in communications, management, and
discipline and it's now spilling over into the local community. I'm fed up with
all the complaints and I have written to Fife region's chief executive asking
for a full report,'' said Mr McLeish.
The council's social work chairman, Councillor Charles Laing, admitted that
Rimbleton House needed to close. He added that it was the only residential-care
provision managed and run by the social work department, so it was expected to
cater for the needs of a range of children and young people with an extremely
diverse variety of problems.
The plan was to replace Rimbleton with smaller, more homely, units aimed at
meeting the needs of small numbers of youngsters.
Crisis care units for emergency admissions were also possible but because of
the reform of local government, the plans had been held up.
New admissions have been restricted and social work staff are working to move a
number of children on to foster care or other accommodation.

<RECORDNO>975208484</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAN who stabbed his pregnant girlfriend ultimately causing the death of their
baby daughter could have been tried for murder, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord
Taylor, ruled yesterday.
Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell had asked judges in the Court of Appeal to
rule in a test case that the man had committed either murder or manslaughter.
However, Lord Taylor immediately allowed yesterday's ruling to go to the House
of Lords.
He stressed that his decision would not have any implications for doctors
carrying out abortions.
Mr Simon Hawksworth QC had argued that no offence could be committed against a
child who was as yet unborn and therefore not legally recognised as ``a person
in being''.
The victim gave birth three months prematurely. Her baby, which bore a stab
wound in her abdomen, died four months later.
Two years ago, her boyfriend was acquitted of murdering the child.
Now a new point of law has been formulated which will mean anyone causing
unlawful injury to a foetus or a pregnant woman which eventually causes the
death of the child may face manslaughter or murder charges.

RAIL privatisation was thrust into turmoil yesterday when the courts allowed a
crucial legal challenge to cuts in services.
The High Court ruling was won by the pressure group Save Our Railways, which
includes 19 local authorities, the rail unions, the Railway Development
Society, and Transport 2000.
Leave was granted to seek a full judicial review of what SOR claims are
unlawful decisions by franchising director Roger Salmon to reduce services by
up to 50% in some cases.
Labour immediately hailed the court ruling as a triumph for the
anti-privatisation campaign. Shadow Transport Secretary Clare Short said the
Government ``should order an immediate halt to privatisation''.
SOR had argued that, under the terms of the Railways Act, service levels in the
franchises should have been based on the existing timetable.
Mr Justice Brooke agreed to a full hearing, which will open on December 7, a
few days before the first three passenger-franchise contracts are due to be
signed in readiness for Great Western Trains, the London, Tilbury, and Southend
service, and South West Trains to become the first privatised passenger
services by April 1.
Labour transport spokesman Brian Wilson described the events as ``absolutely
wonderful news for our railway industry and everyone who has been fighting
against the Tory's dogmatic obsession with breaking it up''.
He added: ``We have known from the start that the policy was politically
bankrupt. Now we are on our way to demonstrating that it is also legally flawed.
``Many Tory MPs, if they have an iota of sense, will welcome this decision as a
blessed relief which gives them the opportunity to tell Ministers that rail
privatisation must be abandoned.''
Mr Wilson said it was ``a day many of us have been working towards''.
He went on: ``It is an interim stage but I believe it spells the beginning of
the end for rail privatisation.''
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of rail union RMT, saw it as ``a tremendous
victory for rail users all around the country''. The court had exposed the
mythology called the franchise of passenger services as a dupe to secure severe
cuts.If SOR wins the case, the whole franchising programme would be set back
considerably. Mr Salmon would have to decide on fresh Passenger Service
Requirements but only after laying down criteria.
It was the lack of such criteria and suggestions that he had not acted in
accordance with Government undertakings that appeared to win over Mr Justice
Brooke.
The initial undertakings were that franchised services would be based on
existing BR timetables with no significant reductions and only ``tinkering at
the margins''. Mr Justice Brooke seemed particularly put out that under Mr
Salmon's PSR for the East Coast Inter City line, Doncaster faced losing 50% of
its services to and from London.
Save Our Railways said that many services were in fact being cut by one third
or more under the minimum service requirements laid down for future private
users by Mr Salmon.
Mr Nigel Pleming QC, for SOR, said an instruction from former Transport
Secretary John MacGregor aimed at safeguarding services based on existing
timetables and protecting the travelling public had not been obeyed. He said:
``In these circumstances, passenger service requirements have not been lawfully
set and it would be a wrong exercise of power to let franchises on that basis.''
Mr Justice Brooke said the SOR case was ``properly arguable'' in relation to
one tranche of services due to be privatised and gave leave for a full hearing
to take place on December 7. These involve the sell-off of InterCity East
Coast, Gatwick Express, Midland Main Line, and Network South Central.
However, he said it would not be appropriate to give leave with regard to
another tranche involving Great Western Trains, South West Trains, and London
Tilbury and Southend Trains as the court still had to be convinced that the
applicants had not delayed too long in launching their challenge.
He directed that the application with regard to those services should be
adjourned until the December hearing after Mr Salmon offered an undertaking not
to agree any of those franchises pending the challenge without first giving SOR
48 hours' notice so that it could lodge an objection.
Mr Salmon said last night that he was satisfied that the PSR he had set were in
accordance with the objectives, instructions, and guidance issued to him by the
Transport Secretary.
He added: ``Today's hearing merely ascertained that there is a point to be
argued and not the merits of the argument. The Office of Passenger Rail
Franchising will strenuously defend its position at the judicial review.'

By BRUCE McKAINPOLICE were called to angry demonstrations on the postal
workers' picket lines yesterday as more staff joined the strike.
However, the Royal Mail's top executive in Scotland personally took charge of
the negotiations and said he was optimistic that a solution could be found.
Mr John Mackay, director and general manager for Royal Mail Scotland and
Northern Ireland, and Mr John Keggie, divisional officer for the Communication
Workers Union, broke off from talks in Edinburgh to say progress had been made.
``We are currently involved in very fruitful discussions and we are both
optimistic. It is looking hopeful,'' Mr Mackay said.
``For the first time this week, both parties are in a positive frame of mind,''
said Mr Keggie.
They later resumed negotiations which are due to continue today but the strike
still goes on as attitudes on the picket lines harden.
Police had to escort workers past pickets in Edinburgh as they were jeered at
by the strikers. Other working staff have been wearing balaclavas to try to
obscure their identities while driving mail vans past striking colleagues.
In scenes described by one observer as reminiscent of the miners' strike in
1984-85, a crowd of 200 workers chanted, shouted, and waved fists outside West
Port House, the Royal Mail headquarters in Edinburgh, as a line of police
officers kept watch and sometimes restrained them.
Demonstrators surged forward to the main entrance and beat with their fists on
the glass doors, which are secured by an entry system, as a figure thought to
be from management was spotted in the foyer. Police ushered the demonstrators
away from the steps.
At the building's goods delivery entrance in Lauriston Place, demonstrators
booed and shouted insults at employees leaving or entering and at people seen
at the windows. Taxis arriving were surrounded, and there were shouts of
``scab''.
Although management appeared more conciliatory, the strikers saw it
differently. They were incensed that management had stopped paying wages due to
them directly into their bank accounts. Instead they were told to collect giros
at their places of work.
Angry strikers say they were given no notice of the change and that it meant
there were no funds in accounts to make mortgage and other standing payments.
Management say it was simpler to issue giro cheques rather than attempt to key
all the changes in to the payments computer.
Pay slips were waved by strikers which purported to show that workers had
received small sums, such as #12 and #20, for items such as tax rebate, instead
of the week's wages of about #150 expected.
Further offices in the Central Belt of Scotland joined the dispute, swelling
the number of postal workers on strike to 5500. About 12 million items of mail
are now languishing in piles in the sorting offices.
Mail-order businesses are warning of possible job losses if the dispute
continues much longer and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce has offered itself
as mediator to try to end the dispute.
Mr Mackay has not said whether he is willing to move on management's insistence
that workers must return to normal duties and staff at the Portobello office,
where the dispute began, must work the new duties that management want before
further negotiations can take place.
As he talked to union officials, the Post Office went back to court to seek
legal backing to force the Communication Workers Union to hand over its
disciplinary rules. It wants to know whether the union's repudiation of the
strike is genuine.
A judge granted the request.
The Post Office had complained to the union but the union maintained that it
was doing everything in its power to prevent local officials behaving in this
way.
The strike spread yesterday to Helensburgh, Dumbarton, Milngavie, Uddingston,
Kirkintilloch, Grangemouth, Auchterarder, and Dunblane. Management denied union
claims that Aberdeen was also affected.
Around 80 staff in Hamilton made their dispute official by following Government
procedures to have a properly constituted ballot.
Mr Keggie again emphasised the union's advice that it was an unofficial strike
and said the union was prepared to use the whole week-end to try to resolve it
and restore the service by Monday.
Mr Mackay said it was the worst postal strike yet to affect Scotland.

t
THE SNP plans to gatecrash the St Andrew's Day devolution celebrations next
week, joining Conservatives in the party-pooping by launching a document
outlining how an independent Scotland would take its place in the world.
Of the inevitable suggestion that, like Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's
intervention next Thursday using a lecture to suggest possible constitutional
changes within the Union, the SNP are simply engaging in a spoiling exercise,
party chief executive Michael Russell was dismissive.
He said: ``I don't think the convention has any right to assume that Scotland's
national day should be its alone, given that its plans do so little for
Scotland. After all, what amounts to a third launch of the same set of timid
proposals is hardly calculated to set the heather on fire.''
The SNP dipped in The Herald poll last month after a summer of mounting
success, and they are clearly concerned that the celebratory launch of home
rule proposals next Thursday, coupled with a robust Unionist counter-attack,
could freeze them out of the picture.
On St Andrew's Day SNP leader Alex Salmond will launch a new document spelling
out in detail what an independence parliament would consist of - its
membership, voting method, powers, and relationship with the England, Europe,
and the wider world.
The document launched at Edinburgh City Chambers, with SNP Lord Provost Norman
Irons in attendance along with Nationalist councillors from across the country
and members of the party hierarchy present, has been brought forward several
weeks to ensure the party's voice is not missing on the day.
``Our clear blueprint for a genuine Scottish parliament - its operation and
powers, particularly the rights and duties of our citizens, is something we
have been working on for some time,'' said Mr Russell.
``It seems appropriate to ensure that this confident vision is outlined at the
same time as the convention's powerless scheme and the tinkering at the margins
of the Union that is the Tories' alternative to real change.
``We are therefore going to put that vision up front on St Andrew's Day to
ensure that from that day on the complete range of choices available to the
Scottish people in the run-up to the next General Election is articulated.''
He said it was in Labour and Tory interest next Thursday to pretend that only
devolution and the Union were on offer, adding: ``John Major's admission that
Scotland is a perfectly viable independent unit was an indication that the
Tories want to polarise the debate between themselves and Labour.
``The real debate is between what type of change happens  and that is between
Labour and the SNP. It is only right that people have all the options before
them next Thursday.''
The document will pull together previous policies and conference decisions to
outline a 200-seat parliament with two-thirds of members elected directly by
constituencies by proportional representation, and the remaining third drawn
from lists to ensure party, gender, and geographical fairness.
The first measure passed in the initial four-year term will be a Bill of
Rights. The age of majority will be 16, the Queen will remain head of state,
and Scotland would become the sixteenth member of the European Union and 186th
member of the United Nations, a non-nuclear state with strong, conventional
forces.
After Thursday's launch Mr Salmond will head for Brussels where he will deliver
a toast at the St Andrew's Day dinner of the Scottish European Association.
``By combining our new report with an indication of our European vision, we can
give a complete outline of the benefits of independence,'' said Mr Russell.

A LABOUR council is having talks with the Scottish Office about using the
Government's controversial private finance initiative for a new #10m state
secondary school in the Stirling constituency of Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth.
The main teachers' union, the Educational Institute of Scotland, last night
expressed concern about an ``insidious move towards privatisation'', with the
emergence of the profit element in the public education service.
Stirling Council said yesterday that replacing Balfron High, an overcrowded,
magnet secondary, with a new school was a priority.
However, the unitary council, which will assume control for education next
year, has concluded that its borrowing consent from Government will be no more
than #3m a year, an unrealistic option for Balfron's urgent needs.
The new councils, which will be short of cash because of tough Government
settlements and the disaggregation of the regions, are coming under increasing
pressure to use the initiative for school capital projects.
It involves the private sector building, owning, and operating projects for
profit. Stirling Council is seeking clarification from the Scottish Office
about the operating - or managing part of the initiative in relation to schools.
It wants to ensure that the education authority, which employs teachers and
other staff, continues to manage the new school.
Councillor Ann Strang, vice-chairwoman of the authority's children's committee,
said: ``The Scottish Office accepts that there are some obstacles to this type
of arrangement but suggests they are not insurmountable.''
The head teacher of Balfron High, Mr Jim Fleming, said: ``I am delighted to
know that the needs of the school are being taken very seriously. The present
state of affairs is unacceptable.''
However, he emphasised that there was no interest among school board members in
opting the school out of local authority control.
The school has to operate a one-way system in corridors at break times because
of the pressure of pupil numbers. The board is so concerned about overcrowding
that it has asked for health and safety officials to be called in.
Mrs Helen Liddell, who speaks for Labour on Scottish education, said management
of any PFI-built school was the critical issue.
``Local authority control must predominate. We would not tolerate any
circumstances in which the private sector was involved in the provision of
education.''
However, Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the EIS, said: ``This is a
development which is wholly driven by the dogma of injecting the private sector
into public-service provision.''
He called for openness in the bidding process to establish if PFIs were cheaper
and more efficient.
If the talks came to fruition, the new Balfron High would be the first state
school to be built under the initiative.

ABERDEEN Royal Hospitals Trust has had its revised financial plans rejected by
the Scottish NHS executive and has been given until Christmas Eve to come up
with more savings.
The trust has been asked for a more detailed plan. The new deadline is to
ensure ``that every reasonable step is taken to reduce costs to match income''.
A first revised plan was submitted last month when it was revealed that the
trust was heading for a #2m deficit this financial year.
Yesterday, the board's statement to staff said it intended to submit a staged
plan by December 24 which would show that it would achieve its financial
targets by March 31, 1997.
``We shall also, of course, seek to increase our income through detailed
discussion with our purchasers and by offering additional activity,
particularly to reduce lengthy waiting times,'' the board said.
``We will be examining all areas of expenditure with particular emphasis on
administrative costs, and costs not directly related to patient care with a
view to making savings. We shall also seek to ensure that the organisation of
our services and use of supplies is as efficient and effective as we can make
them.''
The statement continued: ``This will require close involvement of all our staff
and we seek your co-operation in identifying areas where there may be potential
for savings or for more efficient operation.''
A trust spokesman said the NHS executive was simply seeking more details of how
the trust proposed to achieve the cuts ``and we will be seeking the help of the
staff for this''.
He added: ``We have to be more specific about where we expect the income to
come from and where we expect to make savings. The first deadline was
reasonably short. We would not want patient care to suffer because we have a
high standard in Aberdeen.''
The trust had met staff and they had said they would work with the management
towards providing the detail required.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ``It is the trust's responsibility
to ensure that its costs match its income. Its pledge to tackle organisation of
its services and administration costs is very much in line with the requirement
of Ministers to reduce these and transfer the savings to patient care.
``Further work is being carried out by the trust on its financial plans. We are
pleased to see the trust's commitment to make progress in this area.''
The one-time flagship NHS Trust - the first in Scotland - had been ordered to
prepare a survival package when the extent of its financial problems emerged
three months ago.
Fears were expressed that wards would close, operations would be delayed, and
nurses axed as it tried to cut its budget at short notice. Eventually, Grampian
Health Board came up with a #1m rescue package to ease the #1.75m deficit.
The problems came to light in the summer when a senior consultant claimed that
the trust was ``technically bankrupt'' and described its financial affairs as
``an absolute mess''.
Trust management initially denied a cash crisis but were later forced to admit
that there had been an exchange of letters with the Scottish Office. Despite
the backing of the trust, in September, finance director Douglas Lindsay
announced his resignation from next March.

OPEN sexual relationships still lie at the heart of The Family religious cult,
a member admitted yesterday.
The Family, formerly known as The Children of God, has nearly 300 members in
the UK, two-thirds of whom are children. The sect rents around six properties
in Scotland, England, and Ireland in which family groups live together.
Children are schooled at home and have little contact with the outside world.
All adults work within the community and share their income and possessions.
The sect said yesterday it had renounced the teachings of its late founder
David Berg, who promoted child sex as a principle of his Law of Love.
The cult opened the doors of one of its homes, a three-storey manor house in
rural Leicestershire.
Mr Gideon Scott, 44, one of the 20 adults in the house, said the group now
accepted David Berg was wrong.
``He himself said he was wrong to have written in that way. We do renounce his
teachings.''
Mr Scott said there were now rules to prevent child abuse within the sect.
However, he admitted adults within The Family had open sexual relationships.
Mr Scott has 12 children, ranging in age from seven months to 23 years, all by
his wife Rachel, 43.
He said: ``Sexual relationships between adults are their own personal affair.
It is up to the individual concerned.''
Four families, including the Scotts, live at the Leicestershire home. Each
couple has their own bedroom and the children share dormitories.
The sect has two similar homes in Leicester.
The children have lessons together and take part in scheduled activities every
evening.
One of the Leicestershire children, eight-year-old Mariangela, said she was
reluctant to see life outside the home.
``I don't think I would like to be a child living outside here. I think it is a
very nice home. It is fun because I have lots of friends.''
Another girl, Victoria, six, said she had never seen a normal school.
``My mum and dad told me it wasn't very nice. I like it here because I have got
lots of people to talk to. A lot of people say it is not very nice outside.''
Mariangela's parents, Andrew and Phoebe Barker, share a bedroom on the same
floor as their children's dormitory.
Mr Barker said he joined the sect 18 years ago when he was in Afghanistan
looking for ``enlightenment''.
Mr Barker, 42, said: ``People take the sensational and salacious lines about
our lives. It is not all about sex. It affects our lives the same as it does
anybody else. A very small percentage of our time is spent on sex.''

RESISTANCE to Care in the Community projects aimed at integrating the mentally
ill into the local community stem from ignorance and a lack of understanding of
the problems associated with mental illness, according to the chief executive
of the national housing agency, Scottish Homes.
In a hard-hitting address to a conference hosted by the Scottish Council on
Mental Health, Mr Peter McKinlay yesterday called for a better understanding of
the problems if Care in the Community projects throughout Scotland were to be
implemented successfully.
Stressing that a closer partnership between housing agencies, health care and
social work professionals, and community care was essential to this success, Mr
McKinlay said housing managers ``must be sensitive of, but not pander to, the
Not in my Back Yard (Nimby) Syndrome'' and urged other agencies to work with
Scottish Homes to promote a better understanding of mental health problems.
He said: ``In the context of mental illness, ignorance inspires fear while
knowledge inspires understanding. We all must therefore work together to help
promote a better appreciation of the difficulties and an acceptance of the
solutions. What we must all strive to achieve is integration, not isolation.''
Mr McKinlay, whose agency has invested almost #400m in the provision of more
than 2000 homes in support of Care in the Community since 1989, also stressed
that, because the experience of mental illness is not the same for everyone,
housing and care packages must be flexible and effective.
He told conference delegates that, crucially, the agencies involved in Care in
the Community ``must never forget we are concerned with individuals who,
whatever their disabilities, have the same claims to civil rights and respect
as citizens as you and me. They must be treated as we would wish others to
treat us.''
Outlining Scottish Homes' role in community care planning, Mr McKinlay said
earlier that the agency had developed grant mechanisms which were designed to
encourage more organisations to develop and manage community-care housing
projects.
The agency had also undertaken valuable research and information-gathering
exercises, the results of which were available for use by all other agencies
involved in Care in the Community.
Mr McKinlay said four principles, which apply across a range of community care
client groups including those suffering from mental illnesses, underpinned
Scottish Homes' approach to Care in the Community.
``Firstly, we believe people with mental health problems should be part of the
community where they live. They should be able to live in homely settings, with
flexible care and support which enables them to live as independently as
possible within their own communities.
``Secondly, we believe housing should be small scale and integrated into local
communities. This is essential to overcome the isolation experienced by many
people with mental health problems and ensure their successful integration into
the local community.''
He added that Scottish Homes also believed in working in partnership with the
public, private, and voluntary sectors involved in Care in the Community, and
that the role of the individual lies at the heart of successful Care in the
Community.
``We believe this is best achieved when health care, social work, and housing
professionals involved the individual and their carers in the decision making
process as early as possible. I particularly welcome hospital discharge
programmes which take into account individual preferences.''

<HEADLINE>`Bad faith' claim over discipline makes judgment necessary, says QC Postal union told to hand over rule book</HEADLINE>

AS the unofficial postal strike in central Scotland intensified, a judge last
night ordered the Communication Workers' Union to hand over its disciplinary
rules.
The Post Office wants to look at the rules so that it can decide whether the
union's disavowal of the unofficial industrial action is genuine.
The union has formally repudiated the strike as it is required to do under the
1992 Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. But Mr Neil Brailsford QC, counsel
for the the Post Office, alleged at the Court of Session yesterday that local
officials were still inciting members to carry on the dispute.
The Post Office had complained to the union but the union maintained that it
was doing everything in its power to prevent local officials behaving in this
way.
Mr Brailsford said the Post Office view was that the steps being taken by the
union were ineffective and it might be that it should be doing more to
discourage the actions of local officials.
However, without a sight of the disciplinary rules which would reveal the
powers of the union, the Post Office could not come back to court and say what
the union ought to be doing.
A request for a copy of the rules had been refused, making it necessary to come
to court.
Mr Mungo Bovey, for the union, argued that the disciplinary rules were none of
the Post Officer's business.
Before any order for production of the rule book could be made, there had to be
a claim that the union was acting in bad faith in failing to discipline local
officials. Such a claim could not be made in this case.
Mr Bovey argued that a failure by the union to take disciplinary action might
be a responsible step. If trade unions were to be suspended or disciplined this
could make an already heated situation much worse.
He stressed that there was nothing ambiguous about the union's denouncement of
the strike. Officials had been abused at meetings for urging colleagues to go
back to work.
Lord Dawson decided that the arguments of the Post Office were well-founded.
For reasons best known to themselves, the union had declined to hand over the
rules, but Lord Dawson ruled that the Post Office was entitled to see them so
it could determine whether or not the union had genuinely disowned the strike
action.
q Police in Hamilton are investigating a complaint from two striking postmen
that a senior Royal Mail employee drove a van through the banner they were
holding on a picket line.
The incident was alleged to have happened yesterday at Leechlee Road.
Chief Inspector Malcolm Mackie said: ``We are investigating a complaint from
two male pickets that their banner was damaged when a vehicle drove through
it.''
He added that the pickets had behaved well and he thanked them for
co-opertating with police during their demonstration.

TWO grieving friends of teenagers who drowned when a bridge collapsed into a
rain-swollen river ran from court in tears yesterday.
One woman began sobbing during police evidence and then hurried out shouting:
``You are lying.''''
Another weeping relative who went with her turned to Sheriff Bruce Kerr QC and
said: ``I'm sorry.''
Minutes later, during the fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court, Mr
James Gibson, l8, who escaped when the car plunged into the River Kelvin, on
December ll last year, also ran from the court and could be heard sobbing
loudly outside.
The emotions came to a head during the evidence of Constable Ian Smeall, 37,
who was one of the first officers at Gavell Bridge, Twechar, on the Sunday
afternoon when the accident happened.
The inquiry is into the deaths of John Furay, l7, of The Strone, St John's Way,
and James McClement, l7, of Kelvin Way, both Twechar.
James Gibson, of Differ Avenue, Twechar, kicked open the door of the VW Polo
and escaped.
Mr Smeall told Mrs Margaret Porter, leading the evidence, that he and a
colleague were checking the roads for flooding.
They met firemen who told them the bridge on Gavell Road had collapsed.
He said they drove through flood water and stopped just short of the bridge on
the Queenzieburn side.
Mr Smeall said he got out of the police Land Rover to inspect the damage and
told his colleague, Constable Wilkie to contact their division control.
As he returned to the vehicle, more bits of the bridge were collapsing. This,
he said, happened shortly after 3pm.
He told Mrs Porter there was a gap in the road surface of the bridge.
``It was approximately eight feet. It may have been more. It was quite a
substantial gap,'' he said.
Mr Smeall said he also saw cracks appearing on the sides of the bridge as more
and more of it gave way.
He went on: ``As I came back off the bridge, a large section fell into the
water. The gap was now approximately double the size.''
The officer said he told his control that the flood water was rising and he was
instructed to move back from the bridge.
Mr Smeall said he had no road cones in the vehicle.
He told Mrs Porter he requested that cones be delivered to the area and also
asked that neighbouring ``D'' Division be informed of the bridge collapse.
The officer said he requested that ``D'' Division attend at the Twechar side of
the bridge to close off the road.
He looked over the river and could see traffic turning back on the Twechar side.
The constable said he was informed that ``D'' Division was having difficulty
getting a car to the Twechar side.
He later heard that a four-wheel-drive police car was on its way.
Mr Smeall said he could not see any other vehicles approaching the Twechar side
and assumed police had sealed it off.
He told Mrs Porter he later heard a vehicle had gone into the river with people
in it and he went back to the Queenzieburn side of the bridge.
He saw people on the other side and they were shouting: ``There's a car in the
water and there are two boys in it.''
Shortly afterwards, he was instructed to take another vehicle and attempt to
get to the Twechar side of the river via Kilsyth.
When he arrived he saw ``a line of cones'' at the junction blocking the road to
the bridge.
It was at this point that woman began shouting and hurried from court in tears,
followed shortly afterwards by James Gibson.
Mr Smeall said a man told him there were voices coming from the river but he
and others searched the river but saw and heard nothing.
Questioned by solicitor James Carmichael, for the McClement family, he agreed
his memory of times that day was hazy and that he had taken no notes.
He said the weather was too bad to take notes and he knew everything was being
recorded by force control.
The inquiry was continued until January.

<HEADLINE>Court told of road rage horror attack</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975208494</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DISABLED former Ministry of Defence executive was brutally beaten up in a
horrific ``road rage'' attack, a court was told.
The alleged victim was attacked because he was ``going too slow''.
Mr Ian Lothian, 48, of Carronshore, Falkirk, told Falkirk Sheriff Court he was
driving his wife's Volvo 340 at 20/25 mph in a 30mph area in King St,
Stenhousemuir, on July 1.
He said he was approaching a zebra crossing.
Mr Lothian, who was invalided out of the MoD in 1988 because of crippling
arthritis, said he had an orange disabled sticker on the windscreen.
He claimed that Derek Godfrey, 22, of Beaufort Drive, Falkirk, drove his
Volkswagen Golf right on his tail.
He said: ``The driver flashed his lights. When I got to the pedestrian
crossing, he pulled out and overtook me then cut in sharply in front of me
causing me to brake sharply.
``A car coming the other way had to swerve to avoid running into the white
Golf.''
Mr Lothian said that, further along the road, Mr Godfrey stopped and got out
his car: ``He approached the front of my Volvo and started to kick it.''
Mr Lothian, who walks with the aid of a stick, said: ``I asked him to stop
kicking my car and told him to see reason.''
He claimed Mr Godfrey then came at him ``like a boxer leaving his corner for a
fight''.
Mr Lothian, who was allowed to give evidence sitting down, told the court Mr
Godfrey kicked him in the arms, legs, groin, and stomach.
He said he fought to stay on his feet. ``I knew that if I was down on the
ground, I was going to be very vulnerable.''
Mr Lothian said he suffered lacerations to his arms, stomach, and legs.
He said his doctor suspected his ribs had been cracked or broken. The casualty
department at Falkirk Royal Infirmary put his arm in a sling.
He said he suffered nightmares after the alleged assault: ``I would wake up in
the night and I had been dreaming that I was lying on the ground and that he
was going to kick me.''
He said he noted Mr Godfrey's car registration number as he sped off and
reported the incident to police.
Mr Lothian told the court: ``The only thing I did to annoy him was to drive
within the speed limit. It was a completely unprovoked attack.''
Constable Brian Tennant said Mr Lothian was ``distressed'' when he interviewed
him and his arms and face were grazed. One arm was in a sling and there was
damage to the offside wing of the Volvo.
The policeman said that when he went to Mr Godfery's home, he told him: ``It is
me that you are looking for.''
He alleged that Mr Godfrey said in a statement: ``As he went down, he gave a
wee squeal, so I gave him a boot.''
Mr Godfrey told the court he acted in self defence. He claimed Mr Lothian
attacked him with his stick.
Depute fiscal Petra Collins told him: ``You were the one with the road rage.
``You were driving in an appalling manner that day.
``He was going too slowly for you. You took out your anger on him.''
Mr Godfrey replied: ``I did nothing other than in self defence.''
He denies driving dangerously, or carelessly, and assaulting Mr Lothian by
pulling his sunglasses off, seizing him by the body, knocking him to the
ground, and repeatedly kicking him on his legs and body to his injury.
The trial before Sheriff Ian Donaldson was adjourned till next month.

Chief Reporter
AN MP yesterday urged Railtrack not to be ``bullied'' by the Government into
selling land for a road widely regarded as vital to a plan to transform
Stirling town centre.
Scottish Liberal Democrat Ray Michie insisted Railtrack should not sell unless
the Scottish Office agreed to fund a #75,000 feasibility study into reopening a
Stirling-Alloa rail link. She also described the refusal to sell as principled
and commercially appropriate.
But it emerged later that Railtrack has repeatedly been offered contributions
towards the study from Forth Valley Enterprise.
Mrs Michie's comments coincided with the Scottish Office and Railtrack opening
talks on the disputed land at Stirling station.
If the ground is not released, access will be curbed to a mainly derelict
15-acre site with potential to boost the town's economic fortunes.
The Government-backed Stirling Initiative's #20m plans for the site, Forthside,
include offices, housing, and a visitor centre.
Approval for the #5m acccess road, which would also relieve traffic congestion
in the area, was made possible by special additional borrowing consent from the
Scottish Office.
However, Railtrack believes there should be ``a level playing field'' between
road and rail investments - a view supported by Mrs Michie, who argued that
road schemes, unlike the railways, never have to justify their costs.
Railtrack said the Scottish Office talks follow a failure to agree terms for a
sale. Nothing was resolved yesterday. The Scottish Office said talks will
continue at a later date.

PRIVATE-sector money is not evil and should not be seen as coming from the
devil, Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson told delegates at a
conference in Edinburgh yesterday.
Mr Robertson was pushing the Government's current agenda of trying to persuade
local authorities to transfer housing stock to alternative landlords with
access to private-sector investment.
The new landlord, he stressed, would be required to continue to provide rented
housing, and any profits would be ploughed back into the housing stock.
The conference, organised by Waverley Housing Management - which took over
homes previously owned by Scottish Homes in the Borders - was warned that
councils which remained as major providers of housing faced a future where
there would be very tough limits on public expenditure.
At present, the process of transfer for councils or for Scottish Homes was
lengthy, the Minister said, and the Scottish Office would soon publish
guidelines to help speed it up.

THE sacking of a lawyer by one of Scotland's best-known legal firms, after she
refused to work nights, was a case of ``victimisation dressed up as
management'', her solicitor claimed yesterday.
Mr Jack Quar, who is representing Ms Eileen Paterson in her unfair sacking and
sex discrimination claim against Ross Harper, said the new policy which led to
her sacking was a ``complete sham''.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow was told earlier that the firm, based in the
city's Ingram Street, drew up a policy document requiring all solicitors to
take part in a night-duty rota, to offer clients in custody continuity of
representation.
There was concern the firm was losing clients because so many different
solicitors were dealing with them at various stages in criminal proceedings.
A policy document was drawn up with the aim of achieving continuity of
representation but it meant Ms Paterson, 36, of Pollokshields, Glasgow, who is
married to advocate Robert Skinner and has two young children, would have to
take her turn on night duty, being called out to see clients in police custody.
The tribunal was told that Ms Paterson had been excluded from the rota when her
first child was born nine years ago.
In his final submissions, Mr Quar said the policy was a ``complete sham'' and
continued: ``Nobody else's terms and conditions were to change, only Mrs
Skinner's. This is a situation where an employee, for a long number of years,
has not done call outs and it has been recognised by the firm that she has
good, sound reasons for not doing so, and then there is a change in her terms
and conditions.
``This is victimisation dressed up as management,'' he submitted.
Mr Quar added that the policy change was not implemented after Ms Paterson's
dismissal.
Solicitor Stephen Miller, for Ross Harper, said the policy document did not
just affect one employee, it included changes to the bonus structure and
removed the fixed annual salary increases.
Ms Paterson is seeking compensation. The tribunal will issue its decision at a
later date.
Solicitor Liam O'Donnell, who was named in evidence the previous day, handed in
a letter to the regional chairman of the industrial tribunals, pointing out
that he had not complained about Ms Paterson's exclusion from the call-out rota.
Mr John Carruthers, a partner with the firm who had given evidence, issued a
statement confirming that Mr O'Donnell had never made such a complaint and that
he had not intended such an interpretation to be placed on his evidence.

A LABOUR council is having talks with the Scottish Office about using the
Government's controversial private finance initiative for a new #10m state
secondary school in the Stirling constituency of Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth.
The main teachers' union, the Educational Institute of Scotland, last night
expressed concern about an ``insidious move towards privatisation'', with the
emergence of the profit element in the public education service.
Stirling Council said yesterday that replacing Balfron High, an overcrowded,
magnet secondary, with a new school was a priority.
However, the unitary council, which will assume control for education next
year, has concluded that its borrowing consent from Government will be no more
than #3m a year, an unrealistic option for Balfron's urgent needs.
The new councils, which will be short of cash because of tough Government
settlements and the disaggregation of the regions, are coming under increasing
pressure to use the initiative for school capital projects.
It involves the private sector building, owning, and operating projects for
profit. Stirling Council is seeking clarification from the Scottish Office
about the operating - or managing - part of the initiative in relation to
schools.
It wants to ensure that the education authority, which employs teachers and
other staff, continues to manage the new school.
Councillor Ann Strang, vice-chairwoman of the authority's children's committee,
said: ``The Scottish Office accepts that there are some obstacles to this type
of arrangement but suggests they are not insurmountable.''
The head teacher of Balfron High, Mr Jim Fleming, said: ``I am delighted to
know that the needs of the school are being taken very seriously.''
However, he emphasised that there was no interest among school board members in
opting the school out of local authority control.
Mrs Helen Liddell, who speaks for Labour on Scottish education, said management
of any PFI-built school was the critical issue.
``Local authority control must predominate. We would not tolerate any
circumstances in which the private sector was involved in the provision of
education.''
However, Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the EIS, said: ``This is a
development which is wholly driven by the dogma of injecting the private sector
into public-service provision.''

Scout Christmas
service launched
AS tonnes of mail continued to pile up in Edinburgh yesterday, local Scouts
were gearing up for the launch of their annual Christmas card service.
The Scouts, who have made deliveries within the city for the last three years,
begin collecting cards from outlets throughout the capital next week.
However, Mr Alan Willoughby, area secretary of the Edinburgh Scouts, stressed
that the 15p festive service could not be used as an alternative to postal
deliveries.
``We are not able to carry anything other than Christmas cards. If the public
decided to post other mail, we would not be able to post it for them,'' he
explained.
The Scouts' secretary explained cards posted via the festive Scout service took
a little longer to reach their destination than the conventional postal route.
``It can take anything up to three weeks for the cards to be delivered, the way
our system operates,'' he said.

A SCOTS councillor yesterday called for thousands of seals to be culled and for
the meat to be sent to starving children in Africa.
Furious animal rights activists criticised the idea as ``insulting'' and
``absolutely ridiculous''.
The call came as police inquiries continued into the illegal slaughter of 23
baby seals on an Orkney beach just a few miles from Councillor Norman Smith's
home.
Councillor Smith, who represents the St Margaret's Hope ward on the Orkney
Islands Council, said: ``A harvest of adult seals could be authorised and the
carcasses used profitably for pet food.
``In a week or two, Save the Children will be to the fore. Starving children
might relish some cans of seal meat. After all, Orcadians were eating seals
within living memory.''
However, Ms Alero Harrison, of Save the Children, was horrified at the
suggestion.
``This is a totally inappropriate suggestion. We would refuse seal meat if it
was offered to us,'' she said.
Yesterday, John Robins of Animal Concern accused Councillor Smith of using any
excuse to justify a cull.
``It is an insult to the people of Africa to suggest that they be fed on the
carcasses of dead seals.''

A SCOTS council is threatening to boycott Shell as a protest over what it
claims are horrendous conservation problems in Nigeria.
Dumbarton district blames the oil company's drilling operations for the
pollution in Ogoniland - the part of Nigeria which executed protester Ken
Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni people have been fighting to protect for more than 30
years.
The council is to write to Shell chairman John Jennings demanding the immediate
clean-up of the area, restoration of lands and lakes, and compensation for the
Ogoni people.
If Shell does not comply, the council will immediately ban the use of Shell
petrol and all other products.
The decision was reached after housing boss Doreen Phillips criticised Shell
and Nigeria's military regime for the devastation in Ogoniland.
``Sanctions are slow but it is the only way we can react,'' she said. ``We will
not use their petrol and will take Shell off our tender list if they do not do
this.
``It is the only weapon we have as ordinary people but we can use it and we can
do this.''
The move follows an appeal by green lobbyists Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace,
and The Body Shop to take action against the multi-national.
They claim that the activities of the Nigerian Government, Shell, and other
multi-national oil companies have led to the widespread degradation and
pollution of the region.
The Ogoni are mostly farmers and fishermen whose land and water is essential
for their existence.
Tory councillor Bill Morrison urged the council to wait for a reply from Mr
Jennings before taking any action.

A BRITISH soldier accused of killing a young Danish woman told a court in
Cyprus today that he could not remember giving damning evidence against one of
his two co-defendants, as alleged by police.
Rifleman Jeff Pernell, 23, from Oldbury, Midlands, also told the court that
some bloodstains on his shirt were his own from a wound inflicted by police,
while other bloodstains were ``from inside the car''. He did not elaborate.
Pernell and fellow soldiers Alan Ford, 27, from Birmingham, and Justin Fowler,
26 from Falmouth, stationed at the British base of Dhekelia, have denied
charges of abduction, conspiracy to rape and the manslaughter of 23-year-old
tour guide Louise Jensen last year.
Pernell took the witness box and under persistent questioning by prosecutors,
denied any memory of a conversation he had with a police officer that
incriminated Ford.
``The police officer was asking me questions and I was talking back to
him.......I can't remember,'' said Pernell, who added that he was tired at the
time and had been drinking.
Yesterday Inspector Democritos Georgiou told the court that shortly after the
three soldiers were detained at a roadblock close to base Pernell told him:
``Alan did it.......he got out of the car with her.......he returned alone.''
The three soldiers are accused of bundling Jensen into their yellow Mini Moke
after knocking her off her boyfriend's motorcycle on the outskirts of the
resort. Her battered body was found in a shallow roadside grave two days later.
All three soldiers were found with what prosecution alleges were bloodstained
clothes.
Pernell said some of the stains on his shirt were from a forehead wound
inflicted by police officers.
When quizzed about other blood stains, he replied: ``(They were) from inside
the car.''
``You are a liar,'' said prosecutor Petros Clerides.
``You can say what you like,'' Pernell shot back. ``You weren't there.''
The three-judge court then stopped this line of questioning as the first issue
to be settled was whether the court should rule Pernell's alleged comments on
Ford admissible evidence.
Defence lawyer Antonis Andreou urged the court to rule the alleged conversation
inadmissible because Pernell was in no state at that time to give police a
voluntary statement.
The hearing continues.-Reuter.

THE trustees of one of the most picturesque harbours in the North East, at
Cruden Bay near Peterhead, have warned that it is in such a poor state of
repair that it may collapse and become unuseable unless remedial work costing
up to #250,000 is carried out.
Members of Cruden Bay Harbour Committee plan to meet representatives of Banff
and Buchan District Council and Grampian Enterprise at the harbour on Monday to
discuss the problem of funding repair work on its external wall.
They say that despite improvements costing #120,000 two years ago, mainly on
the internal part of the harbour and funded equally by the council and the
enterprise company, the outer part of the structure is in a dilapidated state
and has developed several cracks of more than 12ft in length which are wider
than a man's fist.
Mr Bob Quinn, chairman of the committee, said yesterday that failure to repair
the outside of the harbour could result in it being breached and becoming
unuseable, which would have a detrimental affect on two important local
industries, fishing and tourism.
The tiny tidal harbour, which was built before the turn of the century by the
Earl of Erroll, is used as a salmon fishing station and by local inshore
fishermen and leisure craft.
Mr Quinn said: ``About two years ago, the district council and Grampian
Enterprise poured more than #100,000 into bringing the internal part of the
harbour up to its present state, which is wonderful. We said why not do the
outside wall first but they said no and it has been completely neglected since
then.''
He added that, although Banff and Buchan District Council has already allocated
#100,000 in its 1996-97 budget for work on the outside of the harbour, the
trustees fear that the finance will not be forthcoming because of local
government reform next April when the new Aberdeenshire Council assumes control.
``We are concerned that the money they have put by will not be used for that
purpose but for something else in Aberdeen,'' he said.
Grampian Enterprise pointed out yesterday that the total expenditure on
environmental improvements two years ago - which were designed to ``increase
the attraction of the harbour to tourists'' - included #16,000 allocated for
work on the harbour wall.
Mr David Halliday, director of property at Grampian Enterprise, said it was
sympathetic to the situation and was ``seeking to explore potential
assistance.''

HIGHLAND Council yesterday voted unanimously to campaign for the abolition of
the present toll structure on the Skye Bridge and will press the Scottish
Office for a change in policy.
A high-powered working group was set up and authority given for the deployment
of staff and resources for the campaign, which will go to Europe if no
satisfaction can be won.
The campaign motion was signed by all six members of the council's Skye and
Lochalsh area committee and moved by its chairman, Dunvegan Councillor Allan
Beaton, who said afterwards: ``The fact that all the councillors from all over
the Highlands have given us their support is enormously encouraging.''
Earlier, he had told the council: ``The motion sets out quite clearly the aims
of the people of Skye and Lochalsh and that is to rid ourselves as soon as
possible of the iniquitous toll system imposed on the Skye Bridge. We live in a
fragile economic situation in a scattered rural environment.
``What encouragement is it for tourists to have to pay #4.30 over a mile of
road, or for a tour coach to pay #37.50 to drive over the same distance? We are
a captive audience in that we have no alternative viable means of getting off
the island.''
A Scottish Office spokesman responded: ``Highland Regional Council, Skye and
Lochalsh District Council, and Highlands and Islands Enterprise accepted that a
privately funded toll bridge would secure the fixed crossing much sooner than a
publicly funded one.
``A public local inquiry was held in January 1992 to look at all issues related
to the bridge and the toll regime and no objections were raised at that time by
any of the local authorities. However, if the Highland Council has new evidence
to present, we shall look at it on its merits.''

Plan to raise U-boat fleet for
salvage sale back to Germany
A GROUP of ex-Royal Navy senior officers plan to raise 100 U-boats scuttled in
British waters after World War II, break them up on a remote Scottish island,
and ship the ``expensive'' metal back to Germany.
They have already been given permission by the Ministry of Defence to bring up
the submarines, currently lying in at least 300ft of water off the coast of
Northern Ireland.
Now a consultant for the group, a salvage consortium, has written to Shetland
Islands Council suggesting a disused mine near Sullom Voe oil terminal be used
for the salvage work.
The bizarre proposal is being treated with thinly-veiled scepticism in most
council departments and a planning application is almost certain to be refused.
Mr Charles Osbond, of Derbyshire-based Charterwood Consultancy Services, said
in the confidential letter that he was seeking a site for the consortium, which
includes ``several ex-Royal Navy personnel of significant rank and service''.
He claimed that the old Sullom Mine, in Northmavine, would be ideal for
dismantling the U-boats for their expensive metals because it has a mooring
jetty nearby.
Mr Osbond is understood to have links with the mine's owners - Jeniva Landfill
Ltd, of Radcliffe on Trent, Nottingham, recently took over the mine from local
owners.
``Some 20 vessels a year would be brought in, with all explosives and diesel
expertly removed at the lifting site in the Irish Sea,'' he writes.
``The vessels range in weight from 790 to 2200 tonnes and in total would
provide some 150,000 tonnes of saleable material.
``Broadly speaking, the proposal would be to use Gaza Jetty as the mooring
point and transport the vessels to Sullom Mine, where dismantling would take
place.
``The consortium would need an export jetty for the metals in cargoes of around
20,000 tonnes and I would propose the use of 90m by 40m stone barges, which
could be moored to the head of the jetty, loaded, and then towed to the final
destination in Germany.''
Mr Osbond says the project would last for five years and create 100 full-time,
locally-recruited jobs.
He admits that the plan is ``environmentally sensitive'' but says a firm of
experts, Pell Frischman of Wakefield, would carry out anti-pollution control.
Shetland Island Council's chief executive, Mr Malcolm Green, said the council
received many unusual proposals and requests for help and considered them all
seriously.
However, the council's director of planning, Mr Jimmy Anderson, said the area
around the mine, two miles from the Sullom Voe terminal, was totally unsuited
for such a proposal.
``There are houses at the head of the jetty and if it was to be turned into a
breaker's yard for submarines, the disruption caused to people living there
would be unacceptable,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said officials believed there were
between 104 and 120 U-boats lying on the seabed over a wide area roughly 30
miles off the northern coast of Ireland.

A Highland primary school janitor, who feared for the safety of 250 pupils,
smashed two dozen windows he thought were dangerous at his school, a court was
told yesterday.
A six-year-old girl had already been injured at Hilton primary school in
Inverness after falling through a pane of glass in a fire door.
The authorities had been warned about the ``accident waiting to happen'' at the
school by janitor John Angus McDonald.
The school refused to replace the windows with reinforced safety glass because
of insufficient funds, Inverness District Court heard yesterday.
McDonald, of Castle Heather Drive, Inverness, admitted vandalising 24 window
panes on March 12 this year. They were all single-glazed panes on doors and
fire exits.
Depute fiscal John Bamber said police were called when McDonald, a first
offender, was seen approaching the school with a hammer.
Defence agent Craig Wood said McDonald, who has since left his post, had
continually complained about the lack of reinforced windows in the school since
beginning the job last August.
Legislation introduced in 1992 requires all schools to replace ordinary glass
at low levels with toughened glass or safety panels by 1996.
In November last year, Theresa O'Donnell was rushed to hospital with serious
cuts. She required stitches to her face after a fire door smashed when she fell
against it.
Mr Wood said McDonald had approached headmaster Iain Telford before and after
the accident but was told there was not enough money to do anything about it.
``In a state of desperation, he just cracked and, as the good Samaritan, he
took the matter into his own hands and broke the windows.
``He thought this would bring the matter to the authorities immediate
attention. ''
Mr Wood said: ``McDonald did this for the best of reasons.''
Highland Regional Council yesterday confirmed that all windows had since been
replaced with toughened glass.They added: ``He is no longer employed by us. Mr
Alistair Mathieson JP admitted the case was ``an unusual one'' and deferred
sentence on McDonald for 12 months for good behaviour.
Mr McDonald refused to comment after the case, but Theresa's mother, Elizabeth
of 17 Kildonan Crescent, Inverness said: ``John did what hundreds of mothers
wanted to do. His action has probably prevented another child being hurt.
Unfortunately, it came too late to stop my daughter being injured.''
Mrs O'Donnel was angered to learn that the authorities knew of McDonald's
complaints before Theresa's accident.
``It is so infuriating. It just makes me even more determined to win
compensation from the council for Theresa's injuries.''

<TEXT>
GLOUCESTERSHIRE social services used private detectives to check up on
Frederick and Rosemary West while their children were in care, it emerged
yesterday.
The detectives were used in 1993 by the council, which was concerned that the
couple were breaching a court order preventing unsupervised contact with the
chidren.
A detective agency provided information which helped social services return to
court to enforce the order, said a spokesman.
He said it was not unusual to employ private detectives in certain cases.
``This is an example of the many steps taken by the county council to protect
the children,'' he added.
The Wests' five younger children were taken into care in August 1992 by social
services, following allegations of abuse.
In July 1993, the Wests walked free from court - their trial on abuse
allegations abandoned when two witnesses declined to give evidence.
However, the younger children remained in care and the police investigation
began that led to the discovery of the Cromwell Street killings.
Gloucestershire County Council said yesterday the West children were put on the
At Risk Register in 1992. They were not on it previously.

A FORTHCOMING referendum on reprocessing foreign nuclear waste at Dounreay was
yesterday described by Caithness and Sutherland MP Robert Maclennan as an
attempted fraud, largely orchestrated by outside groups.
The poll will be conducted by the independent Electoral Reform Ballot Services
and a result is expected in the middle of next month. It will be paid for
through a public appeal organised by Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping.
Mr Maclennan said: ``This so-called referendum is nothing of the sort. It is a
device mounted in Caithness, backed, if not suggested, by Greenpeace, as one
shot in a long campaign to close Dounreay.
``Unlike a proper referendum this poll can decide nothing as its outside
backers know perfectly well. What the poll could do, however, is damage the
prospects of Dounreay maintaining a role as a scientific centre employing
directly over 1000 people.
``If they were honest about it, the poll promoters would say that they want to
see Dounreay mothballed. Instead, they claim to be targeting only the proposal
to use Dounreay's expertise in research reactor fuel reprocessing to win new
international contracts. They know Dounreay has safely developed these
world-leading skills over 30 years. They know every step in the process has to
be approved by independent scientific regulators.''
Mr Maclennan said that the referendum's organisers knew that Dounreay would
send the waste back to the country of origin; that the movements of such
materials had been safely handled under strict regulation for decades.
``But they also know that the way finally to close down Dounreay is to chip
away at the remaining work which can support the Dounreay site; first imported
fuel reprocessing then all nuclear reprocessing.
``This poll is supported by cynical, manipulating lobbyists who have made their
own careers out of trying to inflate fear of science. These lobbyists did not
seek the backing of any locally elected representatives for their action.
``I hope their so-called referendum is seen for what it is, an attempted fraud
on the public.''
Cand's secretary, Mrs Marjory MacKenzie, said last night: ``Does Robert
Maclennan really think that the people of Caithness are so intellectually
wanting that they could be led by the nose by an outside group?.
``We got a donation of #3000 from Greenpeace and it was very welcome, and we
said thank you. That was the sum total of our contact with the group. The idea
grew out of a public meeting on October 16 which was attended by four
councillors and Dounreay representatives. Mr Maclennan didn't manage to attend.
``If the people of Caithness think we are stupid, they will tell us so when
they answer a question that has been agreed as balanced by the Electoral Reform
Ballot Services. They wouldn't have accepted it, had it not been balanced.''

PRESIDENT of the Board of Trade Ian Lang last night launched one of the
strongest attacks so far on Labour's constitutional plans for Scotland.
The former Scottish Secretary said they would be immensely damaging and added:
``From my new Cabinet position, it now is clearer to me than ever that the
Scottish economy is inextricably linked with the wider British economy.''
Mr Lang, speaking in Penrith, said that was why it was vital that businesses
had a level playing field, not one sloped against them because of a separate
parliament imposing rules and regulations that would consign them to a
different division.
Mr Lang argued that would be the consequence of Labour's proposals for a
tax-raising parliament in Edinburgh, adding that Labour's plans would ``totally
neglect the needs of the Scottish economy, Scottish business, and Scottish
jobs''.
Mr Lang added: ``The way forward must be to continue to build on the strengths
of our constitution, not to undermine them by creating a separate parliament in
Edinburgh.''

THE cost of a Scottish Affairs Committee mission to New Zealand as part of a
study of Scottish agriculture has been exaggerated, it was claimed yesterday by
one of the MPs who was unable to join nine colleagues for the 12-day trip.
Liberal Democrat MP Ray Michie said estimates that it could cost the taxpayer
#50,000 were inaccurate. Her remarks were backed up by a Scottish Affairs
Committee spokeswoman who said the total cost could be calculated only at its
conclusion.
The trip, whose participants include three English MPs, has been widely
criticised in Westminster coming just weeks after the Commons agreed to tighter
controls on MPs' behaviour.
Although committee staff were reluctant to give details for ``security
reasons'', it emerged that the group, led by Kilmarnock and Louden MP Willie
McKelvey, will spend five days visiting beef, dairy, and sheep farms in the
Wellington area. They will also tour a vineyard and visit fruit producers.
On Monday, the MPs will spend the day with the High Commission being briefed by
agriculture officials on animal welfare and other farming issues. The MPs will
spend their first two days at the four-star James Cooke Centra Hotel in
Wellington which charges $235 (#100) a night for a single room.
Ms Michie and Mr Allan Stewart, Tory MP for Eastwood, both turned down the
opportunity to join the fact-finding mission. Ms Michie said she had been
unable to go because of prior constituency commitments.
On the cost of the trip, Ms Michie said: ``I really don't know, I'm afraid. I
understand what is printed in the papers is incorrect.''

THE bitter battle for Labour's Govan parliamentary nomination has intensified
following a victory for Mr Mohammed Sarwar, over Mr Mike Watson MP, in the
Pollokshields/Kingston branch.
Mr Sarwar took the branch nomination by 62-11, having earlier failed to win
at Govan/Drumoyne and Langside/Shawlands.
Across the three branches, Mr Sarwar polled more votes.
However, Mr Watson has 50 nominations from union branches and affiliate
organisations while Mr Sarwar has just four.
Mr Watson has also won the Govan Constituency executive nomination.
The final membership vote takes place on December 14.

ALL statements to the effect that Transport Secretary Sir George Young is not
interested in the West Coast main line are, from here on, inoperative.
We can reveal that he travels on it regularly. Only two weeks ago, he was in
the cab of a train from Birmingham to Coventry and visited a signal box where,
we are informed, the technology was extremely modern.
Sir George was allowed to make a station announcement at the signal box which,
he said, was widely commended for its clarity. He blew things rather, however,
by adding that ``the absence of a Birmingham accent may have confused some
passengers''.
MPs' sleaze bonus
THE Grim Reaper is moving in. A recent survey shows increased levels of
emotional stress being experienced by MPs. Among the main symptoms were a
tendency to eat, drink, or smoke too much (45%), tiredeness or exhaustion
(44%), a declined interest in sex (38%), lack of sleep (37%), and indigestion/
sickness (21%).
Followers of the Nolan Committee and its recommendations may be interested in
the following: ``MPs who spent more than 10, and in some cases 30 hours, in a
work role outside of parliamentary life, experienced significantly lower
physical stress levels than colleagues similarly engaged for less.''
Root of the question
TREMENDOUS concern at the number of English MPs tabling Scottish Questions. Ten
of the first 20 questions put down for Scottish Question Time in the House on
Wednesday, came from such well-known Scots as Anthony Steen (South Hams), Harry
Greenway (Ealing North), and Lady Olga Maitland (Sutton and Cheam).
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth insists that as we have a UK Parliament,
there is every reason for English MPs to take an interest in Scottish affairs.
Others, such as the Liberal Democrats' Ray Michie, reckon this is a classic
example of why a Scottish parliament is required to ensure that Scottish issues
are properly discussed by the representatives of Scottish constituencies. Even
more, perhaps, for Mr Forsyth to sort it out on St Andrew's Day.
Convenient legacy
SCOTLAND'S heritage is being heavily debated these days, with Mr Gordon
Prentice, Labour MP for Pendle, anxious to know what measures the Secretary of
State will take to ensure the structure and fabric of historic buildings in
Scotland is properly preserved.
He wants traditional slate and stone quarries reopened so the materials can be
used once again.
Even that may not be enough for Labour colleague Brian Wilson, MP for
Cunninghame North, who suggested in the House that a physical memorial should
be erected to the poll tax and argued, for some reason, that a derelict public
toilet in Stirling could be adapted for the purpose.
Home-brew fears
OVER to their lordships, where we learn terrible things about what the imports
from Europe of alcoholic drinks are doing to our domestic trade. According to
Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, Customs estimates that beer imports are equivalent
to about #130m, though the industry puts the figure at nearer #367m. Beer
drinkers will be interested to note that during questions on the subject,
Labour peer Lord Peston said it was a matter of the ``utmost gravity......''
Treasury views crash
GENUINE commiserations to Treasury Chief Secretary William Waldegrave, whose
brand new ministerial car was written off in a collision in Whitehall. Never

OUNCILLOR Anderson is quite correct in what she notes about the status of
Scottish banknotes (November 22).
The Clydesdale Bank cash dispenser at Glasgow Airport has for some considerable
time been supplying Bank of England notes to its customers rather than their
own notes. I can well imagine their explanation as regards the needs and
experiences of travellers using the service as they pass through the airport to
far-flung places.
I cannot, however, imagine any logical explanation, that might satisfy me at
least, that the Bank of Scotland might care to offer about a sign which I
witnessed in their East Kilbride branch. The notice intimated that the business
tellers could supply Bank of England notes only to customers. Why?

THE 50th World Congress of Junior Chamber International was held in Glasgow
between 4 and 11 November 1995. The event, held in a different location
throughout the world each year is the annual meeting of Junior Chamber
International and attracts young business people to a week of business,
training, and social events.
On behalf of the congress organising committee I would like to thank everyone
in Glasgow and surrounding areas for their support and encouragement which
enabled the event to be hosted by our city. Not only did Glasgow Junior Chamber
of Commerce receive considerable support from the public sector but we also
received support from both large and small companies in the private sector.
This is not only appreciated but was essential for the event to be staged.
More than 4200 delegates from over 100 countries throughout the world attended
the congress making it the largest world congress ever held in Europe.
Glasgow can be proud of the feedback from the delegates. The city demonstrated
its true culture with many delegates commenting on the friendliness of the
people in the city and the feeling of personal safety both during the day and
evenings. Delegates were also amazed at the architectural beauty of the city
and the spectacular surrounding scenery.
The city, its business, businesses in the surrounding area, and Glasgow
citizens can be proud of the achievement in representing Glasgow and Scotland
to an international audience in a way which delegates will positively remember.
Duncan Tannahill,
Chairman,
Congress Organising
Committee,

LONG-WINDED, a notorious killjoy with an aversion to alcohol and a definite
down on motorists, given to using highly technical language, with few friends
at the outset of its annual public appearance, and even fewer by the end, the
Budget has had a long and chequered life. It is subjected each year to violent
verbal abuse from whoever is in Opposition at the time, is invariably the cause
of a financial crisis in the City, not to mention fiscal despair in the living
rooms of the land, and considered by all to be more political pie in the sky
than pounds in the pocket when it comes to tax cuts.
It is also afflicted, from time to time, with what one could call fiscal
incontinence. The Budget leaks. The recent change from being a springtime, hey
nonny, nonny non-event, to a product of the season of mists and mellow
fruitfulness has done it little good. Nor has the fact that its current
begetter, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Hush Puppy one, released
from the Trappist vows which bound his successors, never seemed to stop talking
in the run-up to its delivery this week. The hush of yesteryear, which started
immediately after Christmas, has never seemed so desirable.
The Budget as we know it was born in 1733, its name being derived from
bougette, the French for a little bag. A satirical pamphlet about William Pitt
the Elder, then Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, contained a
cartoon showing the great man as a quack doctor opening his bag - or budget -
containing pills and potions, and the joke stuck.
The Budget had, of course, existed long before that because throughout history
the books of state have always had to be balanced - or cooked. The first known
attempt to draw up a proper balance sheet was made in 1362 under Edward III
and, as is always the case, once the accountants had their foot in the door
there was no stopping them. They took over.
The financial statement was originally delivered on Lady Day, March 25, but in
1754, when the calendar was changed, the date was moved to April 6. Thereafter,
give or take a week or two, the Budget was delivered some time in March or
April until two years ago when its birthday was moved to the autumn. The Budget
speech usually consists of two parts: a resume of the economic situation, which
the Commons listens to as best it can, since hardly anybody, including, on
occasion, the Chancellor, knows what the man is talking about, followed by a
detailed list of the measures to be introduced to raise the money needed to
keep the Government going.
This is the bit which everyone awaits with bated breath. Will the price of
wines, spirits, and beer go up? Will the cost of petrol rise? Will there be tax
cuts? Will the mega-rich end up being swinged, or will it be the poor who get
the pain? Will it be a Budget for All Seasons, a Drinkers' Budget, a Bash the
Motorist Budget, a House Owners' Budget, a Whack the Scroungers Budget, a Soak
the Rich Budget Until Their Pips Squeak as Denis Healey once threatened, or a
Bribe the Electorate Budget? Infinite is its variety.
Sometimes the process of delivery takes ages. Gladstone spoke for five hours in
1853, while in the present century the longest-winded Chancellor was Lloyd
George, who spoke for four hours 51 minutes in 1909, minus a 30-minute comfort
break, allegedly to rest his voice. Today the tendency is to keep it short,
probably little more than an hour in length, although sometimes it seems longer
than that because Chancellors are seldom among the great political orators. One
man's hour can seem a lifetime.
The Budget, a bit like Moses in the basket, is brought to the Commons in the
red despatch box first used by Gladstone in 1860, along with whatever tipple
the Chancellor of the day requires to help him get through the ordeal, because
delivering it requires fortitude. To steady their nerves, Chancellors are
allowed to take a drink of their choice to the Commons despatch box at which
the speech is delivered. Disraeli favoured brandy and water, the ascetic Sir
Stafford Cripps, who delivered Labour's austerity measures in 1948, 49, and 50,
pure water, although Hugh Gaitskell, who followed him, proved not all
socialists are killjoys, and delivered his 1951 Budget on a mixture of rum and
orange.
Derick Heathcoat-Amory, the Tory Chancellor in 1958, 59, and 60 sustained his
strength with a mixture of cold milk, honey, and rum, while Selwyn Lloyd, Tory
Chancellor in 1961 and 62, drank whisky. Denis Healey, Labour's long-serving
Chancellor, delivered his Budgets in 1974 (twice), 75, 76, 77, and 78 on
brandy, while James Callaghan, another Labour killjoy Chancellor, delivered his
in 1965, 66, and 67 on tonic water.
The Conservative water drinkers included John Major, 1990, Anthony Barber, 1972
and 73, Peter Thorneycroft, 1957, Rab Butler, 1952, 53, 54, and 55, and Harold
Macmillan, 1956. Nigel Lawson, 1985, 86, 87, 88, and 89, proved a man for all
seasons, starting off on Scotch and soda, but ending up on spritzers.
Although much remarked upon, the tipple seldom bears any resemblance to the
content of the Budget, teetotal Chancellors often letting alcohol off
scot-free, drinkers penalising it.
The delay in announcing tax changes - the speech normally starts at 3.30pm -
was to allow the Stock Exchange to close so that nobody made a killing. Budget
leaks are common, although ones with financial implications rare, the last of
any note coming when Hugh Dalton in 1947 inadvertently let slip something to an
evening paper journalist while making his way to the Chamber and had to resign.
Those were the days. Now politicians cling on like grim death whatever the
crime.
The Budget is sometimes genuinely controversial. The Opposition always pretends
it is for party political reasons, although they may be lying in their teeth
because sometimes it is exactly what they would do were they in power. Lloyd
George's 1909 Budget, which introduced the Land Tax, had the roughest ride in
living memory. During the ensuing debate the closure, that is a motion to
suspend the sitting of the House, was moved 106 times, and 549 divisions were
held. On that occasion the MPs spent 90 hours trudging through the division
lobbies. The Budget can be a hard task master.
It was a historic Budget for another reason. The Commons having done its worst,
the Lords went even further and threw it out by 350 votes to 75. This led to a
General Election and the passing in 1911 of the Parliament Act which destroyed
their lordships' power to veto legislation.
One of the wisest things said about the Budget was uttered by Iain Macleod, who
remarked he had rarely known one acclaimed in April that did not show signs of
coming apart by July. Winston Churchill, who delivered his Budgets in 1925, 26,
27, 28, and 29, said that whenever a Chancellor did something which was popular
he had probably done something unwise, and Nigel Lawson, whose Budgets are
listed above, said that anybody who became Chancellor to be popular had chosen
the wrong job, but then he was never popular in any job.
Norman Lamont called being Chancellor a humdrum activity, which could explain
his humdrum Budgets.
There have been many Chancellors, 19 since the end of the last war for
starters, of whom only Roy Jenkins is generally considered to have made a
success of the job, although, being an honest Chancellor, his refusal to buy
votes with golden promises may have cost Labour the 1970 General Election. He
was certainly the most literate, both in the literary and economic sense, made
the best speeches, and balanced the best books. His Budgets not only worked,
they were entertaining.
Sir Geoffrey Howe was considered the dullest - he got called a dead sheep by
his opposite number, Healey - although formidably competent. His Budgets also
worked. It was he who set up the Thatcherite state, not that she thanked him
for it. By common consent, the worst of all was Barber, not that it stopped him
getting a peerage or doing well thereafter in the City. It is not what you do
that counts, but who you know, and being a Budget-maker means you know lots of
people.
Next week's Budget has great expectations to live up to. Will it be a
tax-cutting Budget? As the poet said, if winter comes can spring be far behind?
For winter read tax cuts, for spring a General Election.

SUGGESTIONS about altering the hours of daytime are apt to put Scots in a
tizzy, especially the further north we find ourselves. In some ways nothing
much changes - any darkness lopped off one end of the day is simply re-attached
at the other. As it happens, however, Scots opinion prefers to find what light
there is in the morning rather than the evening, which explains the present
situation. Proposals to change this in Britain in the interest of European
business efficiency will make little headway, though the possibility that there
might be fewer accidents could be more compelling.
Actually the proponent of the change is ready to make an exception for Scotland
(and his readiness need not elicit any hostile response), but the fact is that
we hardly need European uniformity in this matter. The world's business
community is now active round the clock. Much of its activity is electronically
generated and is entirely independent of light or dark. The best-known example
is world stockmarkets which act continuously, responding when on stream (in
their local time, that is) to what has been happening elsewhere in their
darkness. Are other businesses much different in this age of computers?
Such questions can be tested in a living laboratory that is the United States,
which has managed a successful integrated economy across a continent of immense
geographic diversity, characterised by several distinct time zones. Nothing in
the American experience suggests that economic development has been inhibited
or adversely affected by this phenomenon which is considerably more significant
there than it would be here, simply because of the differences in scale.
Indeed, the main Scottish objections to the proposed change derive from what
are perceived as the unattractive social consequences of long, dark mornings,
especially in the far north and the far west. This view should prevail: it can
hardly be to its disadvantage that it is the popular one.

In fact, the John Wheatley Centre is not aligned to any political party, and
the reports represented the personal views of the two authors, Bernard Crick

LIKE undoubtedly vast numbers of people across the nation and worldwide, I had
the opportunity to witness the Princess of Wales present one of the most candid
and I believe honest interviews I have ever had the occasion to experience.
I had been led to speculate in the course of media reports prior to the
interview that her standing and credibility in the eyes of the public might be
seriously and irrecoverably damaged.
In fact, I discovered a very articulate and sensitive lady who was utterly
convincing in her sincerity and remarkably honest concerning her personal life.
To discuss openly the most sensitive aspects of her personal feelings and
private life requires a courage which few of us possess and which we can admire
only from a distance.
I was left with the impression that far from being damaged, her reputation
could only be enhanced.
It is disgraceful that we, the public, in order to satisfy our curiosity,
should subject any human being, however popular or involved in public service,
to the extent of exposure given to the Prince and Princess of Wales. The result
of the pressure of constant and unrelenting media pressure is now clear for all
to see.
More remarkable still is the fact that despite her difficulties she remains
loyal to the Prince of Wales and very fair in her appraisal of the characters
involved.
The nation should be proud of this remarkable woman who I feel certain will
continue to receive public support.
She commented that she envisaged her future role as an ambassador for this
country. I would consider, given the extent of public interest and affection
openly shown to her, both abroad and at home, that this is a goal to which she
has already aspired and in which she has overwhelmingly succeeded.
Was she simply being characteristically modest? Could we hope for a better
ambassador? Perhaps the public will answer these questions for her in the
fullness of time.

THE latest section of the A74 to be upgraded to motorway standard was opened
yesterday by Scottish Roads Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
Speaking at the ceremony on the stretch between Ecclefechan and Eaglesfield,
Lord James stressed the Government's commitment to upgrading the M6 and A74
economic artery in and out of Scotland.
He claimed the introduction of private finance into the trunk road programme
allowed projects to be completed earlier.
He pointed to the Skye bridge as an example of how private finance could
accelerate the roads programme.
``This introduction of private finance into the trunk-road programme has
allowed projects to come forward sooner than would otherwise be the case and
has brought with it the benefits of private-sector initiatives,'' he said.
The opening of the new motorway completes the southern section of the A74
upgrading programme, giving motorists more than 25 miles of continuous motorway
between Cleuchbrae and the Border.
He described the new section of motorway as ``a shining example'' of the
success of the design and build contract.
``As a result of the greater degree of design and construction innovation which
this form of contract affords, together with the contractors' increased
responsibility for project management, this project has been completed six
weeks ahead of schedule at the tendered price and with no claims,'' said Lord
James, who revealed that a dedicated cycleway was to be developed over the
length of the A74 as part of a #5m initiative.
The Roads Minister also said tenders would be sought next summer to upgrade the
Baillieston to Newhouse ``missing link'' of the M8 between Glasgow and
Edinburgh to motorway standard.
Lord James also said that congestion at one of Scotland's greatest bottlenecks
would be eased when the M8 extension project between Newbridge and the
Edinburgh city bypass was opened in two weeks' time.

DON'T hold your breath for cutting-edge television this Christmas. There will
be more turkeys on the box than there will be on the table. Bah humbug would
appear to be the order of the day. The week. Maybe even the month. Indeed,
there is good reason to believe that Britain may finally have seen the end of
the once-familiar TV excellence over the festive season.
Though the complete schedules have yet to be announced, early indications
suggest that the terrestrial channels have had not only a humour bypass but a
lobotomy to that part of the brain which controls the imagination. There is a
deep and depressing sense of deja vu.
Once upon a time Christmas wasn't Christmas until you had the family squabble
over what to watch. Clearly times have changed. In the interests of happy
families, perhaps, they've made television so anodyne this year that no-one
will argue over choice. That's because there is none.
The truth is that the good old days, when TV channels saved their big guns for
the Christmas and New Year period, are well and truly over. There was a time
when the schedulers would store a special Minder or a Morse or a Spender in a
bid to win the seasonal ratings battle. Not any more. Now it makes sound
financial sense to show them on a wet winter Wednesday night - that way they
get higher viewing figures and a bigger return on their advertising profits as
a consequence.
Behind this change in strategy is the realisation that people, particularly
young people, have better things to do with their time on Christmas Day than
sit glued to the box.
Think about it. Not so long ago, you could look forward to a decent first-run
movie to keep you occupied as you picked the turkey bones. But thanks to the
video rental boom, we've all seen every film we ever wanted to. There is no
longer such a thing as a Big Movie premiere on television.
Believe it or not, people have become more sophisticated, less slavishly
devoted to the four main terrestrial channels. They have a far greater choice
of home entertainment. In addition to video, there's satellite and cable. Then
there's computer games, CD-Roms, and even the more traditional board games
vying for our attention on Christmas Day. Some folk have even discovered that
it's good to talk.
So this year television appears to have thrown in the towel. We cannot yet pass
judgment on BBC1's choice of Christmas Day movies (not Mary Poppins again,
surely) because they've yet to be announced, but ITV has hardly pushed the boat
out with Ghostbusters II in the afternoon and Sister Act in the evening.
Elsewhere, it's round up the usual subjects. How's this for an inspiring list
of programmes on BBC1? Top of the Pops, Last of the Summer Wine, Eastenders,
and - at the prime time of 6.40pm, mark you - a programme of favourite clips,
chosen by Mike Yarwood (who's he, dad?), of ``classic highlights'' from
Christmas past. Haud me back. You have to wait until almost 10pm before you
find a programme worth watching (a one-off special episode of One Foot in the
Grave).
ITV is equally predictable. Coronation Street and, well, Coronation Street.
Surely some mistake? Sadly not. There's a half-hour episode at lunchtime and
then an hour-long ``bonus'' edition at 7pm. Clearly, the imagination factory's
assembly line has been working overtime at Granada. Ah, but there's always
Robson and Jerome. Who they? They're the two actors from Soldier, Soldier
who've been given their own 30-minute murderalongasong show on Christmas night.
Still, there's BBC2 and Channel Four for intellectual stimulation and fearless
programming. Then again, perhaps not. Both stations appear to have lost their
bottle. They have their moments (a two-hour recording of La Boheme, a screening
of Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing, and ageing pop star Phil Collins
performing Unplugged on BBC2; Blur in Concert and almost three hours of John
Osborne's last work, England, My England, on C4 but the rest is pretty boring
and predictable.
Boxing Day television is little better (Eastenders, Generation Game, Christmas
in Emmerdale and Michael Barrymore). Maybe it's worse, when you come to think
about it.
Highlights? Difficult one. There are a couple of promising dramas later in the
week on ITV (Circles of Deceit, a two-hour thriller starring Dennis Waterman as
an ex-SAS man working for a secret government department, and McCallum, a
one-off pilot from STV featuring John Hannah as a forensic pathologist). After
that, you're struggling. There's always the New Year, but that's another sad
story. Anyone got a Trivial Pursuits game I can borrow?

WE deplore the attack of the Scottish Landowners Federation on local
authorities which fail to negotiate access agreements when Forestry Commission
woods are sold (November 18).
The blame lies with the Government not local authorities for continuing with a
forestry disposals policy in the absence of any effective arrangements to
safeguard public access.
The Government's model access agreement allows the new private landowner the
right to close the former FC wood for up to six months of the year, every year,
for pest control, management, and conservation reasons.
The agreement even allows the new owner to open the wood for one day and then
reimpose another six-month ban. Why should local authorities spend their scarce
resources on such a silly system?
Why should Scottish Natural Heritage or local enterprise companies risk grant
assistance on access facilities in such woods when access security is so weak?
The SLF is also wrong in claiming there is no loss of access after sale. In
1993 the Ramblers' Association undertook a consultation exercise with over 100
owners of former FC woods in Britain, asking if they still supported the
freedom to roam policy that operated under FC ownership.
Fewer than one in five of the new owners replied to confirm that this was still
their access policy.
In Sweden privatisation of the state forest service has been proceeding without
controversy. This is because in Sweden, and many other European countries, the
public has a right of access to all state and private forests. Transfer of
ownership does not lead to loss of access.
If the Secretary of State for Scotland wants to continue selling our forests he
needs new access legislation, not more bureaucratic and ineffective access
agreements.

THERE is a curious and paradoxical thing happening in our country with regard
to free speech. In many respects there has never been so much of it about. Gone
are the days when the press barons would conspire with the Establishment to
hide uncomfortable facts about the monarchy.
We can hardly hold that view in a week in which the treasonable conduct of the
former King Edward VIII was exposed once and for all, and the peekaboo Princess
flung open the doors of the royal bedchamber.
Free speech has become so established that not only may the cat look at the
king, she may claim the right to scratch his eyes out in public.
This principle has been adopted by a number of radio and television
interviewers who seem to believe that politeness towards those who stumble into
their studios in the early morning or late evening is as anathema to them as it
would be for the cat to shake hands with a mouse which has invaded his
territory. These supercilious people do not so much think themselves equal with
the public figures they are questioning - they seem to think they have a right
to be rude.
The tide of free speech has brought many gains but it contains much effluent.
Trash TV, the dramas which rely on four-letter words as a symbol of
``realism'', the frantic pursuit of values which invert the cosy middle-class
world which the newsreels used to pretend was Britain. Mrs Whitehouse has
turned into Dame Edna, and Mr Pastry into Sir Les Patterson.
It is easy to lament this situation, and easier still to appear rather foostie
and puritanical in doing so. What worries me is not the extension of freedom of
speech but the unwillingness to extend it far enough.
At present we have a situation in which public figures are criticised,
miscalled, investigated, scrutinised, ridiculed. This is usually justified on
the grounds of either: free speech; the public has a right to know; nobody
should enjoy rights denied to the general public.
I have no quarrel with any of these but my point is that we have now reached a
situation in which free speech is being denied to public figures; and in which
``the right to know'' is being extended to matters which the general public
would vehemently dispute if applied to themselves instead of the easy target of
public figures.
Some recent examples. Claire Short MP tried to answer honestly a question about
the use of cannabis and she found that there are limits to free speech for
politicians. Ditto Nicholas Soames MP, and friend of Prince Charles, who gave a
candid response to the Dianarama programme within minutes of transmission. His
comments were immediately used as grounds for his resignation. If ever there
were cases of failure to address the real issues, it is the pillorying of these
two people.
Paint was recently thrown over the Tory party chairman as he entered
Parliament. The issue immediately became the response time of the police, not
the yobbish behaviour of the assailant.
In the coming days we will be treated to the sight of postal workers picketing
in their industrial dispute. How will they use their free speech? Will it be to
persuade, to demonstrate the strength of their case - or will it be to
intimidate and frustrate the rights of others? We shall see, but I suspect that
we will see many examples of the ``ordinary man'' acting in ways he would be
the first to condemn in politicians.
My sympathy is for politicians of all parties. Most media persons who write and
broadcast about them derive income from a variety of sources, yet are never
asked to disclose their private finances.
It is perfectly proper that the parliamentary question system should not be
able to be bought, nor that MPs should be in hawk to business or trade union
interests, but there are provisions to prevent this and the idea that MPs
should make total disclosure of their financial affairs is only fair if it is
made universal.
It is then we see how absurd it is. TV interviewers made to disclose their
share portfolio before interviewing industrialists? Lawyers made to open their
driving licence before representing clients on motoring offences? Teachers made
to state their religion before applying for certain posts? (Come to think of it
. . .)
The ordinary citizen would not tolerate for a moment the kind of intrusion into
his private life which is the everyday stuff of politics. If there are
fundamental rights of free speech and freedom of information then they must
apply across the board.
If I have a right to know how much the Tory Party chairman pays for
dry-cleaning his suits, or George Galloway for buying his, should I not have
the right to know how much Jimmy McSwachle is getting in social security for
his bidie-in and their brood of illegitimate children? The money in both cases
comes from the state - so why should we not all be told? This whole issue is
not about free speech at all. It is about a seachange in our society, a swing
of the pendulum from elitism to egalitarianism. It is about snobbery being
supplanted by inverted snobbery, and a lowest common denominator in values.
The only way to achieve a proper balance is by the Golden Rule - by treating
others as we would wish to be treated by them. It won't reclaim a lot of the
ground that has been lost, but it would be kindlier to politicians and royalty.

AS there has been no denial published since Mr Andrew T Bell's letter in The
Herald (November 11), is it fair to assume the accuracy of his claim of
Kwik-Fit Insurance Services being given a grant of #2.5m? Mr Bell is astounded.
Many of your readers will share his astonishment.
The insurance market is finite and there are already too many chasing business,
some employing aggressive indiscriminate selling methods and ensnaring the
unwary, so why a grant to a parent company not content with what it was created
to do, viz, the fitting of exhausts and tyres?
A newcomer to insurance will inevitably result in enticing both insured and
staff from established companies. How can this possibly justify a grant and of
such magnitude?
Let the shoemaker stick to his last and if there are indeed resources available
for grants then such should be given to the deserving, of which there are
indeed many. Swan Hunter was a supreme example of need and yet its cry for less
than #1m went unheeded, with the consequence of the loss of a skilled workforce
and, nearer home, the shameful disregard shown to Rosyth Naval Dockyard.
The creation of largely part-time clerical jobs is not what is needed in
Lanarkshire in particular, it is creative work by its skilled artisans employed
full time.

THE housing market has been so dismal these past five years that the very
notion of its recovery must invite scepticism. Yet, although its plight this
time down has been unusually severe, housing has long had a cyclical nature
with several marked booms since 1945 followed by periods of relative decline or
stagnation, whose real nature has previously been disguised by inflation. This
time the inflationary mask has slipped - and the damage is seen to have been
done, and suffered, with re-possessions and negative equity, not to mention the
assaults on mortgage tax relief. Given the importance of this experience for
Tory electoral chances, it is no wonder that the Chancellor is under immense
pressure to try to make modest amends next week.
He will not want to do so. His Treasury advisers have long been anxious to
reduce, even to end if possible, the whole business of mortgage tax relief.
They will not want to relent now, though back bench Tory MPs have very
different views given their exposure to irate constituents. In fact, it may be
possible for Ken Clarke to do nothing next week yet still preside over a
recovery in the housing market. Anything he does do may simply speed up
developments already underway, according to one reputable specialist forecaster
with a City bank, who believes that the market will recover from the middle of
next year to end up 2%, and be 6% better in 1997, and another 9% better the
following year.
That would be great news for mortgage payers; the drawback for the Tories is
evident in the dates. The recovery will certainly precede the next General
Election, yet its main effect will be felt in the two following years when Tony
Blair could be ensconced in Downing Street. But possibly anticipation could be
enough to encourage some resurgence in Tory fortunes. Lower interest rates
would help but the only other ammunition in the Chancellor's locker is the
abolition of stamp duty on house purchase. There is a good case for its
retention - private housing attracts no taxation since the abolition of
Schedule E, but if Mr Clarke has to make a gesture, Stamp Duty, or its loss,
could provide it.

Do not stand at my grave and weep;
I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the gentle autumn's rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night.
Do not stand at my grave and cry;
I am not there. I did not die.
IT HAS become the most popular poem in Britain, although it has probably been
around for the best part of a century and its author is unknown. An 11-line
verse, almost certainly originally 12 with the fifth or sixth now missing, has
been requested by more than 10,000 people after it was broadcast on BBC
television's Bookworm programme on Remembrance Sunday.
What should we make of this, hot on the tail of equally sudden popularity for
Auden's Funeral Blues following Four Weddings and a Funeral?
The professor cautions us not to jeer, notes the five and a half couplets
instead of six, and points to the sincerity of the emotion. The poet says: ``In
a funeral context, the voice of the dead person is what people want to hear.
The poetry promoter says: ``It hits the spot.'' The literary theologian
dismisses it as Disneyland Wordsworth. Usually-cynical colleagues pronounce it
``good'' even ``beautiful'', but please don't read it at my funeral.
Its new status is directly attributable to a young soldier with a fondness for
poetry. In 1989, 24-year-old Lance Bombardier Stephen Cummins was killed by an
IRA landmine in Londonderry. Shortly before that he had sent his parents a
sealed envelope to be opened in the event of his death. It contained a copy of
the poem, which was read at his funeral.
It was also read three years ago at the funeral of Rachel Nickell, the young
mother murdered on Wimbledon Common and at the memorial service on the 25th
anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death in 1987.
Such enormous enthusiasm for reading a poem at funerals which was not only not
Christian but specifically at odds with Christian doctrine refuted any claim
that we might live in a vestigially Christian society, according to the Rev Dr
David Jasper of the Centre for the Study of Literature and Theology at Glasgow
University. Admitting that his honest opinion gave him a bad conscience because
so many people were apparently drawing comfort from it, he nevertheless said:
``I personally see it as a sad comment on an inability to contemplate the
reality of the world we live in. This pastiche of Romantic pantheism offers
such fragile comfort that it may leave them with greater pain.''
His colleague in the Department of English Literature, Professor Philip
Hobsbaum, recognised that the sentiment had immediate popular appeal. ``What
this poem does is trigger an emotion that is already there. When reading it
this morning, I was reminded irresistibly of a very dear friend of mine who
committed suicide three years ago. At such times if we can find something
written by someone else expressing these emotions it is a great consolation.
``I do not jeer at these things. They are very sincere and people reach out
through them. There are a lot of reasons why people want to be propped up and
edified when things are going against you. This does not create anything new or
open up new territory. Once people do start reading poetry, they will go on. I
do not mind where people start as long as they go on to read new things,'' he
said.
At St Andrews, one of the few professors to produce as well as study poetry,
Douglas Dunn, said: ``It has a gentle, but positive voice, is very direct, full
of imperatives. It is interesting that it took a television broadcast to bring
this to people's attention. A lot of people no longer read poetry, it is not
taught in schools in the way it used to be, but they do associate metaphor with
poetry and that is what they want; they do not want poetry to be written in
everyday language.''
Tessa Ransford, director of the Scottish Poetry Library, confirmed that many
people sought comfort from poetry at a time of bereavement and often went on to
become regular readers of poetry.
``People want something which speaks to them directly and simply,'' said
Christopher Meade, director of the Poetry Society, who believes that the
British public is hungry for poetry.

THE striking postal workers should sort themselves out lest they join the

Any important correspondence has reached me by fax - and perhaps the stimulus
of this strike will further develop the fax ethos which took root in the last
major postal strike.
I am missing a few cheques and my recent income tax payment is languishing in a

IN her article on the media coverage of the West case, Margaret Vaughan asks
the question: ``Should we expect the real world to be sealed off from the world
of imagination?'' (November 23).
What I observe in today's materialistic culture are scores of examples of an
``unreal world'' being presented (or sold) to people's senses.
The world of sexual abuse, murder, violence, rape, etc, would be received by
the general public more readily if our modern culture were not so riddled with
ugly, unreal, unwholesome things such as junk food, bad housing conditions,
passive entertainment industries, and obscene uses of the written and spoken
word.
The modern human being's soul is already contracted and hurt by all that goes
on in the world - we just can't stand any more evil or injustice.
Is it any wonder that the West case is the straw that breaks the camel's back?
I'm suggesting that what we need more of in our daily lives are encounters with
people and the world which fill our imaginations with pictures of beauty,
truth, and morality.
Individuals, parents, communities, the media, and society as a whole would
serve the world well by taking up my suggestion.

A POLITICAL row has followed disclosures that an option to deal with South
Ayrshire's sewage problems by pumping effluent up the coast to Irvine may now
be taken up despite having never been put before councillors.
Ayr MP Phil Gallie, who raised the matter at Westminster earlier this week, is
calling for a Scottish Office inquiry into the affair and Strathclyde
councillors have expressed their disappointment that they were not given the
chance to consider sewage pumping as an option. Last night, senior Irvine
councillor Jack Carson attacked the plan to pump sewage to an existing
treatment plant at Meadowhead near Irvine.
``We have just passed the European standards for bathing water for the first
time in eight years. This proposal for additional sewage treatement is the last
thing we want. We have planning powers and we will fight it all the way,'' he
said.
COSLA yesterday disputed the ``unrealistic'' #86m central support savings which
the Scottish Secretary claims will be made from local government reorganisation.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said there was scope for savings
in central support services but not the extent of #96m in a full year and #86m
next year as claimed by Mr Michael Forsyth.
Cosla claimed existing employees had the right to transfer to the new councils
and said it would take some time for them to decide staffing requirements after
April 1 next year.
Even when the exercise was completed, Cosla said it expected savings of #40m to
#50m, but emphasised these would be matched or exceeded by the extra costs of
delivering regional services over 29 mainland authorities, rather than the nine
as at present.

THE Nigerian generals are attracting even more opprobrium than the Greek
colonels in their day. It is thoroughly deserved. Reaction has to be considered
and controlled all the same and the proper objects of contempt identified and
targeted. The aim must always be to help Nigeria in the future and not, by
excess of zeal, do it unintentional damage. That might seem to be obvious but
there are signs that damage to the country's economic development could easily
come from the identification of Shell, and its hopes to build up a natural gas
industry in the Niger Delta, as in effect enemies of the country.
That is an entirely misplaced judgment which can itself do only harm. Shell is
a huge international business with a soundly based reputation for environmental
awareness. It would hardly operate in a single country in a manner entirely
distinct from its normal mode. Shell in Nigeria is the largest foreign
participant in the hydro-carbon industry but there are others (not exactly
minnows themselves) and that diversity need not be forgotten. The physical
suffering imposed on Ogoniland derives from the inadequacy of state provision
and control. The responsibility lies with the government, albeit not an elected
government. A great part of the case against previous Nigerian administrations
and certainly against the present military regime is the way in which they have
ignored their duties in order to extract as much money as possible from the
region. The generals are the proper target for foreign disapproval and where
sanctions are involved these ought to be on the sort of weaponry from which
some at least of the generals' power derives. More sweeping sanctions affecting
the whole country should be avoided. They will hurt the mass of Nigerian people
but not the brass hats who repress them. The parallel wih Iraq might usefully
be remembered: sanctions hurt the wrong targets.
If the attempt is made to stifle the development of the Delta oil and now
natural gas deposits tomorrow's Nigeria will be the poorer and its people will
not thank their would-be benefactors. Of course some Western opinion hates
multi-national companies, but that should hardly determine its strategy against
Nigeria's dictators.

I WAS amused but not surprised at your correspondents' reaction to my letter
defending young Scots people (November 20 and 22).
I stick to my guns in defence of teenagers; middle-aged people always look back
on their teenage years with rose-tinted spectacles and forget that if they
looked at the newspapers and magazines of that period they would find
middle-aged people pouring out their poisonous words about teenagers.
As for Mr Martin's letter, I would point out that if we take the raising of the
Scots Guards in 1642 as the earliest Scots regiment raised on British soil to
the retreat of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders from the barren rocks of
Aden we have about 300 years of Scots soldiers dealing out death and
destruction to people with black, brown, and yellow skins.
Within the ranks of these regiments and others we had children as young as 11
and 13 often standing in the ranks of the famous British square.
Who will be our possible enemies that we in Scotland have to have a standing
Army of teenagers ready to die on behalf of comfortable middle-aged,
middle-class, armchair strategists.

FURTHER to Keith Bruce's welcome and informative article on the centenary of
Glasgow's Theatre Royal, could I add one vital strand to the theatre's rich
history, as the cradle of the Repertory Theatre in Scotland as it existed and
flourished in the thirties and forties (November 13).
Usually in conjunction with Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum this period provided a
social centre to Glasgow's playgoing, with its permanent booking facilities; it
also gave regular patrons an invaluable education in theatre of all kinds and
eras, with Scottish work by no means ignored.
The centre of activity was the Brandon-Thomas company, but notable achievements
were those of the earlier Masque Theatre, and later on Ronald Adam's Howard and
Wyndham Players and the starry (in 1940 and usually historically overlooked) H
M Tennent Players, which even presented a rare Bridie, Susannah and the Elders,
and which had Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray as junior company members.

Clock Bill
fails to
chime with
Forsyth
IF Michael Forsyth were to fall on his knees and shake a frustrated fist, it
would not have to be at some unseen spirit in the sky. Unlike Basil Fawlty, he
has a target for his wrath.
It is the form of John Butterfill, a benign political cove from the twilit
resort of Bournemouth. From out of the dark recesses of the Tory backbenches he
blundered into view this week with his plan for a time zone at Hadrian's Wall.
Mr Butterfill, who emerged top of the poll for a Private Members' Bill, is to
introduce a Bill to turn England's clocks forward an hour, harmonising with
Europe, and leaving Scotland in a timewarp.
He indicated he would not oppose any move for different time bands north and
south of the Border. The Scots may stay in the dark ages if they so choose, he
said, questioning whether ``the whole of British time and the whole of how we
run should be dictated by crofters in the West of Scotland.'' Different time,
different country, different planet?
Like poor old uncomprehending Manuel, at his bumbling best, he unwittingly left
Mr Forsyth striking a discordant chime with his own party colleagues. For the
plan to extend daylight hours is reported to have found sympathy in several
ministries where Ministers believe there would be economic advantages to a
switch to Central European Time.
But it undermines somewhat the 16-year struggle to convince Scots that the
Conservative Party truly, madly, deeply, believes, honest, in the union.
In an incandescent performance, reminiscent of Basil's preferred method for
dealing with dumb waiters, Mr Forsyth issued his political colleague with a
swift poke in the eye: ``We are one United Kingdom and we do not want to be
divided by a time zone,'' Mr Forsyth fizzled. ``It is the sort of thing I would
expect to hear from a Scottish nationalist, not a Conservative and Unionist,''
he fumed. Ouch!
Downing Streert, however, was noncommittal over the Government's attitude
towards the proposed Bill: ``There are a range of views on this subject. It is
not one, historically, that the Government has taken a formal view on,'' a
spokesman mused.
On Thursday night Mr Forsyth intends to steal the thunder from the
devolutionist lobby's proposals by using a memorial lecture for former Labour
stalwart Dick Stewart to announce his new plans for the governance of Scotland,
to safeguard the union and, hopefully, his Stirling seat. Mr Butterfill's
somewhat divisive proposals may have blunted the sharp edge of his unionist
argument.
But then, as has been so wearily often remarked, Mr Forsyth has shown new
colours since his return to Scotland. Following the banishment to Social
Security that followed his unfortunate falling out with most of his Scottish
ministerial colleagues, and virtually the entire ranks of the Conservative and
Unionist Association membership, his uncompromising Thatcherite stance vanished
like the morning star when he came homeward to think again.
The descriptions of him in Mrs Thatcher's memoirs as ``the real powerhouse for
Thatcherism at the Scottish Office'' and the only political foe to be feared by
opponents hardly match up to his new image as ``Braveheart'' Forsyth, the
doughty champion of all things Scottish in Cabinet.
He would, he promised, be Scotland's man in the Cabinet, not the Cabinet's man
in Scotland. But, as he was reminded by the former political adviser to his
predecessor as Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang, just a few days ago, that is a
risky role to play.
A newspaper article by Alan Young warned that by setting himself up as
Scotland's champion against his Cabinet colleagues he implicitly portrayed the
Cabinet - and therefore, presumably, the Tory party - as Scotland's enemy.
What this suggests, says Young, is that Forsyth, or a source close to him, is
willing to distance himself from the Government of which he is a member by
acting as Scotland's stout defender in a running battle. But by doing so, Young
acutely argues, he undermines the Union the government is pledged to preserve.
Perhaps, after all then, Mr Butterfill has done the Scottish Secretary a
favour. He has allowed Michael Forsyth to be seen to fight Scotland's dark
corner against the dying of the Tory light. Then, come the next General
Election, a small star may still shine over Stirling.

Now that she has been convicted of 10 murders and considering the evidence of

particularly now that MI5 are to become involved in criminal investigations, to

LIKE Anne McKay who is saddened at Mr Blackshaw's letter over Archbishop
O'Brien's forced retraction of his Imprimatur from the pack, HIV - A Christian
Response, I too find myself saddened.
Saddened that such wilful intransigence to the findings of the Magisterium of
her own church can be evinced by a teacher of a Catholic school (November 22).
For despite Vatican II the Catholic Church remains an eternal autocracy. The
archbishop, by his humility and compliance, evidently sees this. Why not Mrs
McKay?
She informs us that the packs now lie on her shelf with nothing within. An
infallible way to prevent the spread of the Aids virus via sexual contact.
Of course this calls for self control; as does the entire economy of salvation.
Her council, like the pack itself, is one of despair.
The real sadness lies in that parental expectations are being betrayed daily by
people in positions of trust.

Women may have closed the credibility gap, but the reality gap is still wide
open. Cherie Lunghi makes a glossy, astute company head in the coffee ads, but
the real head of its parent company is a man. Women directors are still rare.
Ann Shaw looks at a new scheme to encourage more women to reach for the top
WOMEN who believe hard work will get them to the top are sadly mistaken. And
they are making an even bigger mistake if they mix and socialise only with
other women or, even worse, join all-women organisations.
For the main obstacle keeping women out of the boardroom, according to an
Edinburgh-based research project, is . . . other women.
Women, it seems, spend too much time with others of the same sex rather than
networking with influential men, the ``movers and shakers''. And among other
reasons given as to why so few make it to the top are:
n A lack of a personal public profile;
n Their shortage of experience at senior company level;
n The Old Boys' Network.
While levels of prejudice are breaking down, and companies are often keen to be
seen to be promoting equal opportunity, firms are often unable to find suitable
women for the boardroom because they never come across them in the circles in
which they move.
``The reason so few women achieve boardroom appointments tends not to be lack
of knowledge or skills but a lack of confidence in their ability to be
successful in this environment and often a lack of access to the right
networks,'' says Louise Ewart, of Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited, the
company which commissioned the study to find why, in spite of equal pay and
opportunities, there are so many blocks to women's progress up the executive
ladder.
However, all that is set to change with the launch on Tuesday of Boardroom
Mentors, a programme devised by Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd, designed
to help women into the fast track It brings together top business people and
senior women who want to become non-executive directors.
Initially, 25 women will be selected for the programme. They will be linked
with mentors of the calibre of Bob Maiden, former managing director of the
Royal Bank of Scotland, and David Nicholson, managing partner of KPMG in
Scotland and president of the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce &amp; Enterprise.
They will provide advice and support as well as introducing senior women to
influential networks. They will meet at least once a month, and take part in a
series of networking events which will introduce them to corporate financiers,
venture capitalists, bankers and others in the financial world.
If this smacks of old boy networking then so be it, because it is essential for
those women with their eyes set on the boardroom, says Ewart, who is
responsible for the launch of the project.
``Boardroom Mentors cannot guarantee any individual a board appointment, but it
can increase your access to any opportunities that emerge,'' she says.
``Women mix too much with other women. They join all-women organisations,
which, while worthwhile because they provide a refuge and support, do not offer
a fast track to the top. If women want to get on then they must mix socially
with men, not women. They must be seen at all the right social events.''
In Scotland, fewer than three per cent of women are on the board of directors.
``But the reason given over and over again during our research was that men
would like to appoint women if only they knew a few names,'' says Ewart.
For those determined to reach the top Boardroom Mentors may be the answer. You
send in a CV and a letter explaining what you could contribute as a
non-executive director and what benefits you could bring in return to your
mentor. If selected you will join the scheme for a year.

COLD FACTS BEHIND THE ILLUSION
Cherie Lunghi may appear to be in control, but her character in the television
advert is very much the exception to the rule:
20% of managers in Scotland are women.
Four per cent are in middle management.
Three per cent are non-executive directors in PLCs.

THE NHS Management Executive in Scotland is planning urgent talks with the
country's 25 consultant neurologists, on whether the new drug Beta Interferon
should be prescribed routinely for Multiple Sclerosis patients.
The Multiple Sclerosis Society last night expressed deep concern at the
possibility of patients in Scotland having to enrol in clinical trials to
receive the drug - with half receiving it and the other half receiving a
placebo - while in England, patients thought likely to benefit were given it
outright.
A memorandum sent by the executive to health board and trust managers last
week, advises purchasers and providers what steps they should take to prepare
for the anticipated licensing of the drug, which was shown in an Amercian trial
to reduce relapse in the disease.
The chief medical officer, Dr Robert Kendell, said he had received a letter
signed by all 25 consultants stating that, in their view, there was not enough
evidence to recommend the drug to MS patients in routine clinical practice.
Instead, they wanted all their patients to participate in placebo-controlled
trials examining the drug's effect on disability, measured in a valid way.
Mr Peter Cardy, chief executive of the MS Society, said it was disturbed by the
move, which is contrary to the stated opinion of the Association of British
Neurologists.

THE ENTREPRENEUR
ALL entrepreneurs share the ability to see windows of opportunity, a
risk-taking mentality, and supreme self-confidence - and Glasgow millionaire
Vera Weisfeld, co-founder of What Everyone Wants, is no exception.
This is typified by, believe it or not, a cookbook. She has persuaded the Great
and the Good to write it for her, with Liz Taylor, Nick Faldo, the Aga Khan,
Jeffrey Archer, the Duchess of York, and the Pope all contributing their
favourite recipes.
Even Versace was persuaded to design the cover - for free. And it's all for
charity. The book, Recipe for Life, reflects the kind of entrepreneurship that
sets women like Weisfeld apart.
She has made the colossal leap from a council house in Coatbridge and her first
job as a 15-year-old shop assistant to a multi-millionaire with luxury homes in
Scotland and the South of France. But speaking from the boardroom of the former
Goldberg store in Glasgow's Argyle Street, the latest joint business venture
with her husband Gerald, she says: ``I did not set out to become a millionaire.
It just happened.''
A former pupil of St Patrick's School, Coatbridge, she recalls attending one of
their speech days and her dismay at the downbeat message that there were 5000
unemployed in Lanarkshire and jobs only for 500. ``I put myself in the shoes of
those youngsters listening to that and my heart sank. So I wrote to the school
and told them so. Next year I was invited to do the speech. I told them I was
born only 50 yards from the school and if I had sat there and waited for work
in Coatbridge I would still be waiting.
``I said `hands up those of you who want to go and work down the mines'. Not
one hand went up. I pointed out to them that while some jobs go others open up.
Coatbridge has now got the Time Capsule, restaurants, and hotels.
``Get into the workforce. That's the most important thing. It doesn't matter
what you do. Then you can start working your way up. My father gave me the best
advice ever: `The #1 you earn is your best friend. Don't rely on anyone else'.
''
Her speech received a standing ovation, and this gung-ho optimism has served
her well over the years. But she's also a pragmatist. ``I'm not against
education. But there's a myth that started about 10 years ago that if you got
yourself a university education you automatically got yourself a good job.
That's absolute nonsense.
``What they don't teach you in school, and what is desperately needed, is a
degree in Life. We can't all be doctors, lawyers, and accountants.''
One of the founder-members of the newly established Scottish branch of the
British Association for Women Entrepreneurs, Weisfeld's story is well known:
she left school at 15 to work as a shop assistant with C &amp; A. Marriage, two
children and a divorce led her as a single parent back into the workforce,
again starting at the bottom. She worked her way up and applied for a job as
manager of a small dress shop in the wrong end of Argyle Street selling
discount frocks. Her aim was simple: to give value for money. ``You had to, or
your customers wouldn't bother to trail to that end of town again.''
Her early pragamatism paid off: ``Who would leave a good job with Marks &amp;
Spencer, C &amp; A or British Home Stores to come and work in a small dress shop in
the wrong end of Argyle Street? So I had to train my own staff. I sold them a
dream and the dream came true. They ended up earning large salaries and driving
expensive cars.''
After selling their business, the Weisfelds chose to remain in Scotland instead
of retreating to a tax exile. For the past five years they have devoted much
energy to fund-raising for charities. More than 50 charities have been major
beneficiaries of the Weisfeld Foundation, including the setting up of a Teenage
Cancer Trust. Meanwhile, Vera's two sons from her first marriage, Michael and
John, are in the family business and she has six grandchildren of whom she is
extremely proud.
But now the Weisfelds are back in the retail business, unable, one suspects, to
resist a challenge. Why start again? Why, when you have made a million, or as
in the case of the Weisfelds, #50m, do you want the hassle of starting all over
again, especially when you have reached comfortable middle-age, a time when
most people are thinking of winding down, not winding up again?
``Scotland is my home,'' says Weisfeld. She says she wants to do ``her bit'' to
help the Glasgow renaissance. The truth is that Weisfeld can't resist a
challenge. ``I have built up so much expertise and knowledge it's a pity not to
use it.''

Major-General Eric MacLachlan Mackay, CBE, Chief Engineer of the British Army
on the Rhine, 1973-76; born December 26, 1921, died November 16, 1995
ERIC MACKAY, whose family came from the village of Camlup, near Kingussie in
the Grampians, made his name with his epic four-day defence of the school
building overlooking the famous bridge at Arnhem over the Lower Rhine - ``The
Bridge Too Far''.
He had led his Sapper paratroopers throughout 1st Parachute Division's
operations in the Mediterranean - Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy. By the time they
landed at Arnhem in September, 1944, they were an experienced body of 60
battle-hardened men, most of whom were marksmen.
During the first day, Sunday, Mackay and his men fought their way through
Arnhem to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion at the northern end of the bridge.
2nd Para occupied the buildings on the western side of the approach ramp to the
bridge, and Mackay fortified the dominating three-storey school building on the
eastern side, from the upper windows of which he could bring fire down upon any
vehicles trying to cross the bridge.
As Monday dawned, a force of Panzer Grenadiers in armoured half-tracks, led by
armoured cars, came across the bridge from the south.
Having no anti-tank weapons, Mackay had to let the cars go by, but his Bren
gunners and riflemen dealt with the unroofed half-tracks. The first was stopped
by a well-thrown grenade. The driver of the second was killed by rifle fire,
and its crew shot down as they scrambled out. The third vehicle's driver was
wounded and, in trying to reverse, hit the fourth, which burst into flames,
partially blocking the bridge.
The fifth half-track crashed down the embankment, ending up under the window of
the school, from which Mackay was directing fire.
He wrote later: ``It was about five feet away and I looked into its commander's
face. His reaction was quicker than mine; for with a big dirty grin he loosed
off three shots with his Luger. The only shot that hit me smashed my
binoculars, which were hanging round my neck.''
The Sapper marksmen quickly dispatched him and the rest of the crew. Another
two half-tracks met a similar fate, finally blocking the bridge completely.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, Mackay's marksmen inflicted heavy losses on the
German infantry trying to drive them out of the school. Tank guns gradually
made more and more of the school untenable. Nevertheless, morale remained high
because gunfire of 30th Corps could be heard coming closer.
The situation changed dramatically on Thursday. Two large Tiger tanks began to
reduce the school to rubble; and the Germans tried to force both 2nd Paras and
Mackay's men out by burning the buildings around them. Neither could sacrifice
their wounded in the cellars by further resistance. Mackay ordered his
second-in-command, who was among the wounded, to surrender while he and his
last six unwounded men tried to break out.
Unfortunately, he ran into a force of infantry and tanks. He dispersed his men
and played dead himself, but a bayonet thrust into his thigh forced him to
surrender.
His first attempt to escape failed, but he slipped away with three of his men
from a prison camp on the Rhine. Luckily, they found an unguarded rowing boat,
and the strong current carried them down the river to the Allied front line at
Nijmegen.
Eric MacLachlan Mackay was the son of Ian MacLachlan Mackay, an advocate who
practised initially in Edinburgh, and later in Lahore, India. His father died
young and Eric was brought up by Sir Harry Scott-Smith. He was educated at
Fettes, enlisted in the Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1940, and was commissioned
into the Royal Engineers in October, 1941. He served from 1941 to 1945
continuously with the 1st Parachute Squadron, RE.
He was a smallish, dynamic Scot who loved life and always enjoyed a party. He
excelled at high-speed sports.
In 1954, he had married a Swiss rally driver, Ruth Therese Roth. They had only
one son who was born handicapped. She died in 1985. His second wife is Margaret
(Hadders) Hadcock, nee Shepherd, whom he married last year.

Junior Walker, Motown's leading saxophonist during the label's heyday and
leader of the All Stars, died on Thursday of cancer in Battle Creek, Michigan
BORN Autry DeWalt Jr. in Blytheville, Arkansas, in 1942, Junior Walker was
famous for the incandescent tones of his alto sax and the gravelly breathiness
of his vocals, crafting such r &amp; b-flavoured hits as Shotgun, How Sweet It Is,
Shake And Fingerpop, Road Runner, and These Eyes with the All Stars.
He had recently toured with the Four Tops, the Temptations, and other Motown
stars, according to Willie Woods, the All Stars' co-founding guitarist.
Walker had been ill for the past two years, said Wood. ``When he got back from
the Motown tour he had lost the strength in his legs. He never really came back
to where he could walk again.''
Walker and Woods started playing together in the mid-1950s. Their first band
was called the Jumping Jacks. They moved to Battle Creek in the late 1950s. It
was there they found a regular gig at El Grotto, a lounge credited with helping
to get the band noticed.
The band signed with a small label owned by Harvey Fuqua which was later taken
over by Motown.

Louis Malle, film director; born October 30, 1932, died November 23, 1995
LOUIS Malle, the French film-maker who died on Thursday in California at the
age of 63, was one of the most enduring and varied directors of postwar cinema.
He won audiences - and stirred controversy - on both sides of the Atlantic.
Malle brought freshness and sensitivity to subjects that ranged from the
frivolous to the grim, showing himself unafraid to explore such taboo themes as
incest, child prostitution, and French collaboration with the Nazis during the
Second World War.
Very much an actors' director, he launched the screen career of Jeanne Moreau
in the late 1950s and won wide acclaim for his work with children in such films
as Zazie dans le Metro (1960) and Au Revoir les Enfants (1987).
Malle's films covered virtually all genres, from thriller and spoof Western to
absurdist comedy. Equally at home in French or English, he was one of the few
French directors to win acclaim in the United States with a series of films
including Pretty Baby (1977) and Atlantic City (1980).
Malle himself felt his best films were the ones that attracted most
controversy, either for their explicit sexual themes or their unflinching
examination of the past. ``My ambition is not strictly to entertain,'' he said
in an interview shortly after the 1992 release of Damage, the story of an
upper-middle class British family destroyed by the insidious power of sexual
passion.
Louis Malle was born into a wealthy sugar-producing family in the northern town
of Thumeries on October 30, 1932. He quickly turned his back on his bourgeois
background and strict Catholic education - the butt of much social criticism in
his films - enrolling first as a political science student at the Sorbonne and
then in film school.
Unlike many of his New Wave contemporaries who entered film-making via the
radical critical magazine Cahiers du Cinema, Malle started off spectacularly
when he was picked to help the explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau make an
underwater documentary. The result, Le Monde du Silence (The Silent World),
remains a classic of its kind and won a clutch of prizes on its release in 1956.
His first feature, the atmospheric thriller Ascenseur pour l'Echafaud (Frantic)
starring Moreau and featuring music by Miles Davis, followed two years later
and won the Prix Delluc. The big breakthrough came, however, with Les Amants
(The Lovers), starring Moreau as a middle-class woman who discovers the
emptiness of her life through a passionate sexual encounter.
Along with fellow New Wave luminaries Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut,
Malle delighted in an iconoclastic rejection of classical film-making in favour
of a radical new style. His most audacious experiment was Zazie dans le Metro,
the absurdist story of a foul-mouthed eight-year-old let loose on Paris.
Throughout the 1960s Malle turned out films of a stunning variety from Le Feu
Follet (The Fire Within), the grim story of an alcoholic driving himself into
the grave, to the spoof Western Viva Maria, starring Moreau and Brigitte
Bardot, and the period crime drama Le Voleur (The Thief of Paris). In 1973 his
film Lacombe Lucien, about a peasant boy who sides with the fascist authorities
in Nazi-occupied France, sparked an anxious debate about extent of wartime
collaboration.
Malle had blown apart a national myth that ordinary people all worked for the
Resistance, a theme he was to explore again in the much-lauded Au Revoir les
Enfants - about the betrayal of a Jewish schoolboy - a decade later.
He did not reserve his social criticism for France, however. Following his
first successes in America, he made Alamo Bay (1984), a highly political tale
of Texas fishermen and their harsh treatment of Vietnamese boat people. It was
flop, persuading Malle to return home in the mid-1980s despite being married to
American actress Candice Bergen with whom he had a young daughter.
His taste for unusual or difficult subjects never wavered, however, and the
explosive sexual content of Damage, starring Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche,
brought him new controversy. ``I think predictability has become the rule and
I'm completely the opposite,'' he said. ``I like spectators to be disturbed.''

Peter Grant, rock group manager; born April 5, 1935, died November 21, 1995
IT is ironic that Peter Grant's death, on Tuesday at the age of 60, occurred in
the same week another member of his much-maligned breed - the rock manager -
stands accused of having grossly undersold the peak earning-capacity of his
most successful act.
This weekend's TV documentary about the Beatles will re-state the facts about
Brian Epstein's financial naivety in committing the band to pitifully-low
record-royalty rates of one pre-decimal penny per disc sold.
In contrast, Peter Grant's principal clients, Led Zeppelin, profited lastingly
from the forceful certainty of Grant's approach to the rock business. Indeed,
while Grant's ultra-low public profile never came close to matching that of
such managers as Epstein, Andrew Loog Oldham, Malcolm McLaren, or Colonel Tom
Parker, his no-nonsense negotiating techniques revolutionised the financial
reality of top-level concert tours, tipping the scales in favour of artists
rather than promoters.
A gruff and physically intimidating figure, 6 ft 5 in tall and weighing 18!s
st, Grant won most of his battles thanks to the ferocity of his verbal attacks.
His greatest triumph lay in securing Led Zeppelin 90% of concert
ticket-receipts, instead of the then-customary 50-60%.
He evidently never forgot the lessons learned during his first involvement in
the rock'n'roll business, as a UK tour manager with embittered, underpaid
pioneers like Gene Vincent, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry.
However, Grant understood the value of rock's intangibles, too. Led Zeppelin's
rise to prominence was speeded by their aura of underground credibility, a
direct consequence of Grant's decision the group would not appear on TV, nor
sully their art by releasing anything as unhip as a single.
Born into poverty-stricken illegitimacy in London's east end, Grant compensated
with combativeness. For a spell, he was a semi-professional wrestler - Count
Bruno Alessio - and also worked as a bouncer at Soho's famous 2I's coffee bar,
his introduction to the music business.
To his young band, Grant always displayed a brusque, fatherly consideration -
as well as an impeccable honesty. With others, he could be fearlessly
aggressive.
He routinely made record-company lackeys run for cover and music-paper critics
tremble. Entering the crowd at one live Led Zep show, he snatched the tape out
of a bootlegger's recorder. Spotting Robert Plant and Jimmy Page  being
harassed by American sailors in New Orleans airport for the crime of sporting
long hair, Grant lifted one of the sailors off his feet before posing the
immortal question: ``What's your problem, Popeye?''
Peter Grant effectively retired from the music business at the end of Led Zep's
prime era, the seventies, when the band opted not to continue in the wake of
drummer John Bonham's death in 1980. Yet his contribution to the worldwide
cause of musicians was not forgotten, Grant being inducted on to the Roll of
Honour by the International Managers' Forum during the summer.
In addition, Grant was honoured more recently by Phil Everly at an after-show
party following an Everly Brothers' concert in London's Royal Albert Hall.
Presenting Grant with a silver cane, Everly paid him a heart-felt tribute which
refuted the common notion all rock managers are rip-off merchants and shysters
who prey upon the music-making innocents in their charge.
``This man made it all possible,'' said Everly. ``Without his efforts,
musicians had no careers. He was the first to make sure the artist came first,
and that we got paid properly.''

THE RISING STAR
DEBORAH Findlay is a super-cool 29-year-old, one of the new wave of young women
fast making their way in the financial world. As manager of retail marketing
with Dunedin, an Edinburgh-based investment company, she has a staff of seven
and is responsible for an annual budget of #500,000.
So, how did Findlay come to be fast-tracking it to the top while still some way
short of her 30th birthday? ``I skipped university for a start,'' she says. ``I
had a place to read English at Edinburgh but decided to take a secretarial
course and a year out.''
She liked the working environment so much she decided to stay, reckoning it
would give her a head start, a hunch that has turned out to be correct. She
reckons she is doing the kind of job now that she would have had to wait until
her early thirties to get if she had gone to university.
But it was a calculated risk, a decision that called for a certain maturity and
self-confidence. Where did she get if from? What schools did she go to?
``St Leonard's and Gordonstoun,'' replies Findlay. Say no more. She has the
kind of confidence which public schools are so good at instilling into young
people; and you've got to admire it. Meeting challenges, team-building and
getting on with people are qualities drilled in from an early age. She doubts,
and probably quite rightly, that university would have developed this further.
Findlay is typical of many young women now making their presence felt in
today's fast-changing business world. They are confident, self-assured and tend
to work for young innovative companies which thrive on new ideas, and young
people. For women like Findlay, feminism is something an older generation
fought for. They simply take equal opportunities for granted.
She says there is no such thing as a typical day with Dunedin, a company she
has been with for the past four years, and that is part of the reason she finds
her job so challenging and interesting.
``We have a range of retail investment products and the overall aim of my job
is to market these products, control the retail budget, run two departments
involving a staff of seven, and take care of advertising and PR for the
company.''
Surprisingly for such a high-flier she is not a workaholic; she does not belong
to that new breed of youngsters who so alarm older employees because they are
prepared to work excessively long hours in order to reach their goals.
``There's more to life than work. A balance between home, social life and work
is essential.''
The future, it has been said, is female. In tomorrow's world women will play a
major role in decision-making. And it's women like Deborah Findlay who are
making it.

Allan Laing previews the best in next week's small screen entertainment, and
welcomes the return of Inspector Morse, a cop show for grown-ups
TODAY
n.SCREEN TWO: STREETLIFE (BBC2) - Welsh film-maker Karl Francis wrote and
directed this tough tale (highly commended when it was premiered at Edinburgh
Film festival this year) about a single mother's struggle to survive against
the odds in a South Wales housing scheme. His inspiration for the story was a
newspaper report of the discovery of a baby's body in Swansea Marina. Rather
than damn as a monster the mother who had abandoned the child, Francis
considered the possible events which had led her to such a desperate act. The
result is a powerful and harrowing film, etched with black humour and cynicism.
Helen McCrory delivers a truly great performance as Jo, a character of our sad
and depressing times, who descends into a spiral of despair when her spirit is
finally broken. Quite brilliant.
n.TX: THE FINAL KICK (BBC2) - On July 17 last year, around two billion people
tuned in to watch the World Cup Final between Brazil and Italy live on
television. German documentary producer Andreas Rogenhagen dispatched camera
crews to 40 different locations, their remit to capture simultaneously the
reaction of viewers around the world to the game and its nail-biting penalty
shoot-out. The result is a funny and often tense portrait of the emotional
extremes generated by the Beautiful Game. From a cafe in Japan to a car factory
in Iran; from a monastery in Prague to a harem in Cameroon...... all human life
is captured.
n.THE BIG SNOG (C4) - A genuinely impressive list of comic turns (including Lee
Evans, Eddie Izzard, Julian Clary, Steve Coogan, Lenny Henry, Harry Enfield,
and Jenny Eclair) line up to raise a laugh on behalf of a very serious subject.
Recorded live at London's Astoria, it's a benefit gig to raise money for Aids
research. On the downside, the show also features Mariella Frostrup and Dale
Winton.
n.ROYAL VARIETY PERFORMANCE (ITV) - A genuinely unimpressive list of comic
turns (including Sir Cliff Richard, Elaine Paige, Brian Conley, Des O'Connor,
and Robson and Jerome) line up in a (presumably vain) attempt to raise a smile
for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Royal Couple, who could do with a
laugh these days, would be better off staying at home and switching the telly
on for C4. Frightening to think that 10 years from now Oasis and Blur will be
in the line-up.
TOMORROW
n.THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY (ITV) - One can only hope that this long-awaited but
much-hyped series is better than the ``new'' single, Free As A Bird. A quarter
of a century after they called it a day, the Fab Four minus one re-unite to
deliver the authorised Beatles biography through this six-hour documentary
series. So what do we get? Well, tonight's opener traces the group's origin
from their respective childhoods in Liverpool through to 1963 and their first
No.1. Interviews with all four (some new, others from the archives) recall how
they were united by a common love for rock'n'roll and how they went to Hamburg
and played in red-light dives, discovering sex along the way.
n.THE FINAL CUT (BBC1) - And so sadly we reach the end of the line for Francis
Urquhart, a politician so slimey he could crawl under a snake's belly with a
top hat upon his head. The devious Prime Minister from Hell succeeds in
manufacturing his own Falklands-style war when civil unrest breaks out in
Cyprus. Things are going swimmingly when the British High Commissioner is taken
hostage by rebels. Now F.U has the perfect excuse to send in the troops - and
salvage his political career in the process. Meanwhile, Makepeace (Paul
Freeman) asks Claire Carlsen (Isla Blair) to acquire the MoD documents which
will prove Urquhart murdered the Evanghelos brothers. Is this the end for
Francis?
n.THE LAST EUROPEANS (C4) - Heavy-duty journalist Hugo Young presents this
three-part series which charts the UK's abject failure over the past 50 years
to endorse and join the process of European integration. The first programme,
Crossed Channels, examines our often difficult relationship with our
Continental neighbours from the end of the Second World War, through the
establishment (without us) of the Treaty of Rome, to the catastrophe of the
Suez Crisis. It was only after De Gaulle's demise in 1969 that the way was
finally clear for Edward Heath to champion Britain's entry into the Common
Market.
n.CRACKING STORIES: FOR RICHER FOR POORER (BBC1) - The third in BBC Scotland's
nifty wee documentary series follows the fortunes of Bliss, a glossy magazine
for Scots brides which (like a lot of marriages I know) folded after 18 months
with massive debts. Owner/publishers Samantha and Colin Belton's dream was to
produce a magazine which would be ``better than Vogue''. But it was a nightmare
for the staff as the venture struggled to survive. Bouncing pay cheques, long
hours, resignation and sackings (three editors in the space of a year), and
unpaid suppliers. The company collapsed owing #300,000. Today the Beltons have
set up another company (to produce Bliss North in the north of England) while
many of their former employees are still searching for work.
MONDAY
n.CRACKER (ITV) - Sadly, the final episode of the final series of Cracker
(though there'll be a one-off ``Christmas special'' next year, set in Hong
Kong). And maybe it's just as well for, brilliant though this last batch has
been, there have been slightly worrying signs of story fatigue creeping in.
Still, even on an off-day, this cop series is better than anything since
Between The Lines.
n.ALL YOU NEED IS CASH (C4) - Ah, the Born-again Beatles bandwagon continues to
continue. C4's contribution to the Great Hype of '95 is basically a spoiler
series of interviews with what you might call the Significant Others (ie the
people who were involved in the Fab Four's history but were not interviewed for
the Beatles Anthology). Unfortunately, since the ITV documentary series is so
comprehensive, the others are not particularly significant. What we have here
is the unauthorised version which claims to investigate how clashes over money
and managers contributed to the break-up. The film looks at how The Beatles
failed to make all the money they should have done and how Apple is now making
up for lost time (and profits) this year with the aforementioned Hype.
n.IN YOUR FACE: IRVINE WELSH (BBC2) - The next big controversial movie looks
set to be Trainspotting, an adaptation by the Shallow Grave team of Irvine
Welsh's Edinburgh-set, drug-culture novel. There is so much swearing involved
there is now some dubiety over whether or not the film will get a certificate.
This hard-hitting BBC Scotland documentary (the second of three about Scottish
writers) has more than its fair share of uncompromising language itself. It
will not be to everyone's taste. Sub-titled Condemn More, Understand Less, it
explores Welsh's writing through Britain's sub-cultures and the people who
inhabit them, and takes a journey through the author's killing grounds of
housing scheme poverty, drug addiction, football violence, and raves. The film
also includes dramatisations from Welsh's books.
n.WISH YOU WERE HERE? (ITV) - Not particularly. Wish I was somewhere else, to
be honest.
TUESDAY
n.GUNS N' ROSES - THE PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY (BBC1) - When you consider that lead
singer Axel Rose is an anagram for oral sex, it might give you some idea of
where this awful American stadium band is coming from, so to speak. Still, Guns
'n' Roses have sold a staggering 50 million albums so far and, in their last
tour, played to a total of 6,000,000 fans. Clearly, there is no accounting for
taste. This documentary is a record of the band's two-year ``Use Your
Illusions'' world tour, including interviews with the members and live
performance footage.
n.BUDGET '95 (BBC2) - A tragi-comedy drama based on actual events starring
Kenneth Clarke as a beleagured Chancellor of the Exchequer and David Dimbleby
as an ageing television presenter. Look out for cameo appearances from Peter
Jay as the BBC's Economics Editor, who's only problem is the fact that no-one
can understand a word of what he says, and Peter Snow as an insane computer
wizard. Taxing, very taxing.
n.PICTURE THIS: NO ORDINARY PEOPLE (BBC2) - This excellent documentary strand
reaches the end of its current series with Mike Fox's fascinating and intimate
study of the Resistance Movement in South-East France during WW2. The film,
narrated by Zoe Wanamaker, includes interviews with those who survived,
including Englishman Francis Cammaerts, an SOE agent who worked with the Maquis
in Provencal. The result is both a celebration of the perilous life these
extraordinary people led and a tribute to their bravery.
WEDNESDAY
n.INSPECTOR MORSE: THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS (ITV) - Goodbye Cracker and
welcome back Morse after a three-year absence. The great thing about Carlton's
adaptations of Colin Dexter's terrific crime novels (with John Thaw as the
cantankerous Oxford detective and Kevin Whately as his sidekick) is the
wonderful way that they are allowed to evolve at an almost leisurely pace over
two hours. This is a cop show for grown-ups. Based on Dexter's last-but-one
novel (which, in turn, was inspired by a real case), The Way Through The Woods
centres on the apparent murder of Karen Anderson, a single woman who
disappeared while on a day trip to Oxford and whose body has never been found.
Steve Parnell, a man accused of killing five people including Karen, dies in a
prison fight before he goes to trial. The police decide to close the case but
Morse is not convinced that Parnell was responsible for Karen's death.
n.MODERN TIMES: CHERYL'S TRIAL (BBC2) - Earlier this year Cheryl Tooze's
boyfriend, Jonathan Jones, was convicted of the brutal murder of her parents.
Relatives and local people were convinced that justice had been done and that
the guilty party had been jailed. However, Cheryl remains convinced Jones was
innocent and is now campaigning on his behalf. In this documentary she talks
about her profound loss, her attempts to have her boyfriend released, and how
her efforts have thrust her into the public eye and made her own life a trial.
THURSDAY
n.ENNIO MORRICONE (BBC2) - Anyone with even a passing knowledge of film scores
will be familiar with the name of Ennio Morricone. His wonderful haunting music
has graced the soundtracks of some of the greatest movies of the past 30 years
- The Battle of Algiers, The Mission, Once Upon a Time In America, The
Untouchables, and Cinema Paradiso to name but a few. This documentary, which
includes a rare interview with the man himself, charts his rise from the early
days when he penned the music for his old school chum Sergio Leone's spaghetti
Westerns. There are also contributions from, among others, John Boorman, Brian
de Palma, and Bernardo Bertolucci, and Sir David Puttnam. Above all else, there
is the magical music.
n.SECRET LIVES: MARIE STOPES (C4) - Having done up Edward VIII like a kipper,
C4's documentary-series-with-attitude (very much the SAS of the genre) turns
its evil eye upon Britain's original agony aunt. Dr Stopes, of course, was the
author in 1918 of Married Love, the first ever sex manual. What you didn't know
is that, though married, she was still a virgin when she wrote it at the age of
37. Best known today as the pioneer of birth control, Dr Stopes is widely
regarded as having been a kind, caring, humanitarian. According to Secret
Lives, however, her achievements were not motivated by a compassionate instinct
but by a combination of relentless self-promotion and (more sinister) a desire
to create a master race.
FRIDAY
n.FILM: RAN (BBC2) - Kurosawa's contribution to the Beeb's ``100 Best Movies of
all Time'' season is an epic and lavish masterpiece. A loose adaptation of King
Lear, it is the story of an ageing ruler who rashly cedes his lands to the
eldest of his three sons. When his youngest criticises his decision, he
banishes the boy. Before long, the heirs to the throne are at each other's
throats and war and chaos (``ran'' is Japanese for ``chaos'') ensue.
n.WOMAN ON THE RUN (ITV) - One of those exploitative American TV-movies,
allegedly based on a true story. Tatum O'Neil stars as Lawrencia Bebenek, a
woman who served 10 years in prison for the murder of her police officer
husband's ex-wife. The cops claimed she killed the woman to free her hubby from
crippling alimony payments. She claimed she was set up by the police and her
husband.

An appreciation
by Lord Hunter
Stanley Bowen, former Crown Agent for Scotland; born August 4, 1910, died
November 19, 1995
STANLEY BOWEN was a very distinguished public servant, a great figure for many
years in our unique system of criminal prosecution, and a humorous and amusing
friend and colleague. In the course of a long and busy life he had many friends
of different generations who touched his long career at various points.
He was born in Carnoustie more than 85 years ago and was educated at Barry and
Dundee. He studied at University College Dundee, as it then was. In 1932 he
qualified as an enrolled solicitor in Scotland and by entered the
procurator-fiscal service a year later. He chose well because his abilities lay
strongly in that direction.
After a hard training under fiscals of the old school he served relatively
briefly as a fiscal at Hamilton and later Airdrie. In 1941 he went to the Crown
Office as a legal assistant. He was promoted in 1945 to be principal assistant,
Deputy Crown Agent as the post would later be called.
In that capacity he spent the next 22 years of his working life under steadily
increasing pressure and the truth is that he became indispensable.
In 1967 he was appointed Crown Agent for Scotland, a post which he held until
retirement in 1974. After no fewer than 41 years in the fiscal service never
were a CBE and honourable retirement better earned. His retiral dinner in
Parliament Hall was an unusual tribute to the standing in which he was held.
Stanley Bowen had a quite remarkable knowledge and experience of Scottish
criminal law and of the content and intricacies of our system of criminal
justice and procedure. He was an expert at Indictments and was by nature a
traditionalist.
He also had a nose for things going wrong, as inevitably they do from time to
time in the fields in which he operated. He may even himself have made a very
occasional mistake during his long years in the fiscal service but if he did
they were the product of his humanity which never became calloused by the
nature of his work.
Many people will have different memories of Stanley Bowen, each in their own
way. He had a wide knowledge of the fiscal service of his day and a remarkable
grasp of the personalities, strengths and weaknesses of individuals serving in
it. His first instinct was loyalty.
He was impatient of delay and sought to provide from the Crown Office what he
used to call a 24-hour service. This he did even during the period when the
part of the office from which he worked consisted of a few small rooms in the
old premises at Parliament House.
To advocates depute and also to law officers, his attitude was in their early
months in office polite, positive, and helpfully critical but never in the
slightest deferential. Later on when they started making the mistakes of
over-confidence he brought this home in a variety of ways depending on the
individual.
In the early years of his retirement Stanley Bowen did duty as a honorary
sheriff and also undertook a considerable weight of other voluntary public work
on official committees and working groups. These dealt with a variety of
subjects within fields familiar to him, which included forensic pathology
services, police discipline, and identification evidence in criminal cases.
He also gave of his time to a number of voluntary bodies, among them the
Scottish Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders.
A great interest was the Corstorphine Trust which he served as chairman for
nearly a decade. He lived out his life in that ``village'', as its inhabitants
know Corstorphine, and not without success helped to do what could be done to
preserve it entire and undamaged. He found time also to tend his own garden
there at Dovecot Road.

FORMER BBC Radio 1 and Radio Luxembourg disc jockey Stuart Henry, who battled
against multiple sclerosis for more than 20 years, died yesterday at the age of
53.
Mr Henry, who was wheelchair-bound, was one of Radio 1's first recruits when it
launched in 1967. He died at his home in Luxembourg where he had lived for the
past two decades. He is survived by his wife, Ollie, a former model. They
married in 1976. The couple had no children.

SHE CAME, we saw, she conquered. Purely as a television contest, Princess
Diana's Panorama appearance (BBC1, Monday) so far outstripped her husband's
Dimbleby confessional of last year as to make you wonder what all those decades
of royal ``training'' were ever supposed to achieve. If this was her first solo
television interview, God alone knows what she might manage with a bit more
practice.
True, the fact that Martin Bashir kept it straight and simple can only have
helped. Imagine only what Frost or any other member of the paid-up simpering
classes would have made of this delicately wrought exchange.
Having helped to spin the web of myth, could any of them have sustained this
pitiless assault on the central fiction of British life? One begs leave to
doubt it.
But what really separated this performance from that of the Prince of Wales -
Bashir's resolute refusal to fawn aside - was its lack of self-pity. Where
Charles appeared both spoiled, arrogant, and sorry for himself, his wife merely
said what she had to say. And if her lines seemed polished and well-rehearsed,
that is doubtless because she has had many bitter months in which to learn
them. It all left this reviewer with one thought: if the House of Windsor can't
live with her, can it really expect to survive without her?
To which the sane reaction might be, who cares? But as the concluding part of
Channel Four's excellent Secret Lives: Edward VIII -The Traitor King (Thursday)
demonstrated, we have squandered so much social and emotional capital on the
Windsors (and never mind the hard cash) as to bankrupt the political process.
Like children reduced to awe by a bit of simple conjuring, we forget to ask how
the trick is done. The royals only matter because we believe they matter. If
one of them turns out to be a fascist eager to sell out his country, whose
fault is that?
Still, best leave politics to our betters. The horrifying conclusion left by
Monday's disgraceful The Beatles - All Together Now (ITV), meanwhile, is that
if this was a taste of the six-hour documentary series ahead we are all being
taken to the cleaners for the full service wash with added starch.
Little better than a 30-minute plug for a pop video (which turned out,
unsurprisingly, to be the only watchable moment in the piece), this shameless
little exercise offered experts of the calibre of Cilla Black and Lulu to
repeat at intervals that the boys were just fab, y'know, while younger
nonentities wondered aloud just what the quartet had that they so conspicuously
lack. It was grim, depressing, and insulting.
Almost as bad, in fact, as the obligatory matching high-brow discussion of
Apple's product relaunch on Late Review (BBC2, Thursday) in which Mark Lawson
and three other full-paid chatterers gave a word-perfect demonstration of
absolute ignorance. Paul Gambacini aside - a man who understands pop the way a
Kwik-Fit fitter understands Formula One - it was clear, first, that the team
didn't know what they were talking about; second, that such a hindrance wasn't
going to stop them.
The Late Review's survival after the assassination of The Late Show was always
something of a mystery. Where the parent programme at least offered some
semblance of expert opinion, its offspring gets by with capsule reviews,
Lawson's faintly childish determination to have the last word, and the kind of
parochialism that London has made its own. Without Tom Paulin, who managed to
be both acerbic and intelligent, it is as nothing.
Meanwhile Coogan's Run (BBC2, Friday) is better than nothing, but only just.
Steve Coogan is a man of many talents but his determination to show them all
off at once hardly justifies the praise heaped on this series before it had
even begun. His comedy lacks focus, his interlinked narrative seems too much
like a series of sketches, and his versatility appears, even at this early
stage, like a vice.
Peter Sellers, to whom Coogan is often compared, had the same weakness: just
because you can ``do'' a dozen different characters doesn't mean you have to;
just because you can invent an amusing character it doesn't mean you can forget
about an amusing script. Think only of the many cinematic disasters Sellers
inflicted on himself, despite his gifts, and you are left with the hope that
Coogan will shortly get a grip.
There is no chance, one assumes, of such a fate ever befalling Eurotrash
(Channel Four, Friday), which returned last week with its ``world tour'' and
the reassurance from Antoine de Caunes that there would be plenty of tasteless
rubbish ``in a desperate a'ttemp to improve the ra'tings' an' kip you sad
Brrritish bastards interested''. Given that Jean Paul Gaultier immediately
cracked a joke involving Mexican fowl that does not bear repeating, this
promise was a mite superfluous.
Eurotrash is no more than its title: tasteless, sexist, camp, leering, cheap,
nasty - and infused with more genuinely wicked comedy, not least at the expense
of ``you Brrritish tubes'', than you'll find this side of the Panorama
cutting-room floor. The central joke is that the British are repressed yet
lecherous hypocrites who exist only to be insulted. The film clips are
incidental; the hosts a reproof to the sort of country that can make stars of
Reeves and Mortimer.
Or, for that matter, the sort of country that can become obsessed with a sad
character like Brian McKinnon. Public Eye: The Lives of Brian (BBC2, Thursday)
saw Jackie Bird doing her best to unravel the inner workings of this strange
and faintly disturbing star of tabloids everywhere.
A 32-year-old pretending to be a teenager is strange enough; a 32-year-old who
seriously wants to repeat his schooldays is authentically bizarre. But ask
yourself: is ``Brandon Lee'' any weirder than the adults in the media who give
him this sort of attention? This column is still none the wiser.
Sane, impeccable, entertaining, and educational: Jancis Robinson's Wine Course
(BBC2, Friday) drew to a close last night with a flourish entitled ``Grapes in
Ferment''. The series has been a revelation, even for those of us who thought
they had been applying themselves to the subject for years, and I shall miss
it. What Robinson has proved, time and again, is that knowing your stuff is not
enough; knowing how to say it is everything.
The Prince of Wales should take note.

ONE of the aims behind this Assembly Alive! season is to make the public aware
of the venue and the various activities that go on there beyond the yearly
eruption of the Fringe. A key part of that profile just has to be Dance Base,
with its increasingly popular roster of classes for all and its valuable
support structures for dancemakers working in Scotland.
This weekend sees Assembly Alive! teaming up with Dance Base to present a
cluster of events that reflect the different ways in which this Edinburgh
agency is servicing the dance community at all levels. This afternoon, for
instance, (between 12 and 4pm) there's a free ``taster'' session where you can
sample the range of dance styles offered in the schedule of classes before
making your personal choice - sadly tango is now off the list, Dance Base's
teacher has been head-hunted to coach Madonna for her role in Evita . . . Now
that's an incentive to sign on, surely!
Last night, however, was by way of a platform for new work. Four short pieces -
well, two fragments really, an extract and a short piece - by Scottish
dancers/choreographers. It was nice to see dance aimed specifically at children
- the excerpts from Escapades and Adventures, devised and performed by
Ethelinda Lashley-Johnstone and Winifred Jamieson.
Voice-overs conjured memories of their own childhood which the movement
extended with bright, clear-cut gestures - nicely pitched and unstuffy. The
complete work may well tour in Scotland next spring. Paul Joseph took the term
``mixed race'' as the starting point for Kultyer Dance Theatre's short piece
Arcadia ``2 And 'Fro''.
Using an Afro wig as a central, symbolic prop, Joseph and his two dance mates
went through some terse statements of racial conflict, harassment and
confusion. Joseph himself is a compelling stage presence - one longed for him
really to explode into dance.
As it was, this seemed a work in need of further development, not simply so as
to show off the dancers' abilities but also to explore the issues so sketchily
evoked.

IT is not good to see a hulk lying in bed, and as Damian Cronin dwarfed the
standard issue metal frame in Level 8 of Glasgow's Western Infirmary, it was
hard not to feel a twinge of pity for the big man with the shoulder tattoo.
And another thought struck me. Here's the perfect guy to try to attract to
Glasgow rugby. He's big, he's got quality, he's maybe nearing the end of his
top-level career at 32, but he ain't going to play for the rest of his life in
France, is he?
``I want to come back to Britain to play,'' said Cronin. ``It all depends on
what is around, and it might be London Scottish.''
Cronin has his own reclamation business - he has been fitting a new floor to
Sting's house - and all he needs is to rent a yard and off he goes. He actually
played in France last Sunday, you know, the day after the Western Samoan game,
but phoned Jim Telfer earlier in the week to tell him the knee was not right.
Jimmy Graham, the surgeon, pulled out a bit of cartilage.
Visiting time over, I got on the phone to a few hoods in the city. Cronin, I
thought, had played a reasonable game against the Western Samoans.
He is not everyone's cup of tea, he was not that fit, but there were not too
many Scots taking the ball to the opposition, whereas Cronin did. Instead, the
old frailties of Scottish rugby were exposed once again, and some new ones came
to light as well.
Maybe the boys in blue were not taken by the sword, and slain, but it was
patently obvious that this was a side that did not gel.
First up - tackling. We have long been a nation of brave defenders. But, for
just as long, we have also been hopeless in our tackling technique. Not one of
our team can tackle the way the All Blacks, South Africans and, yes, the
Samoans do.
I'd like to see what drills we do for tackling, because the rugby league boys
at Leeds that I watched the other week spent much of the session lifting up
heavy tackle bags and dumping them for a whole length of a pitch.
It was a race for them. In school here, we are told as kids to tackle low, and
then slide down the legs to pin them. These lads tackle much higher, above the
centre of gravity, and wham you back. Not pretty, but effective.
We have a mentality that has been drummed into us since school that a tackle is
quite a gentle art, but I rather fancy that in the brave new world of higher
level rugby, the attacking tackle where the ball is dislodged as the tackler
parts an opponent's ribs will be the one that wins.
When was the last Scottish player cautioned for a high tackle?
Next - awareness on the ball and passing ability. Our players are hamstrung by
the fact that they train in the mud of a winter's evening. That will never
change. But what about this: I have just been watching some of Scotland's top
swimmers, all of them amateur and young, training at five in the morning and
then at night after school. In the same pool is a bunch of veteran chappies and
chappesses who get started at 6.15.
Rob Wainwright says that when he was in Natal during our summer, there were
many players who would visit the gym at five in the morning to get themselves
ready for rugby.
Nick Broughton, the Melrose and Otago forward, says his club back home trains
for 80 minutes, and that's all. Yes, the length of a game. If we can't pay our
players enough to make them become full-time rugby players - and it is entirely
possible that the SRU cannot raise enough cash for that - then the players have
to realise that in taking the 20 grand they need to put some amount of effort
in for that.
I think the SRU can get the high ground here. If they were to negotiate with
some of the prime health clubs and sports centres in Scotland that their
players could use the facilities for free very early in the morning, then it
puts the players in some position, doesn't it? That would be a good one.
And another thing in this rant. In this country, we have a work ethic that
goes: work, work, nose to the desk, don't take all your holidays - then die.
Come on employers, give your top rugby players some time to practise. Become
part of the action. Don't you want the boys to win?
We're all a long time dead.

MELROSE captain Bryan Redpath is in no doubt whatsoever. For the men from the
Greenyards today's premiership clash with Stirling County is the biggest game
of the season, bar none.
Victory at Bridgehaugh will almost certainly mean that Melrose will be
champions for the fifth time in seven seasons - a record which serves only to
underline the Borderers as the most consistent performers of recent times.
Yesterday he declared: ``Oh, yes. This is the biggest game of the season
without a doubt. We've both probably been let off the hook to a certain extent
by other sides being beaten but, for us, it's all to play for and we're really
up for it.''
Holders Stirling will not make it easy for Melrose, and they must fancy their
chances given that a win today would represent their fourth successive victory
against the Borderers.
However, Redpath says that his side are really ``up for it'' and his only fear
is that, with so much at stake, the game might be spoiled as a spectator
spectacle.
The scrum half, who won his fifteenth cap against Western Samoa last Saturday
and was one of a handful who emerged from the game with plus points, has been
enjoying his rugby this season and has been particularly enthused by the
cut-throat nature of the eight-team divisions.
However, like many, he considers that if the eight-team format is to be
preserved then just the one side should be considered for relegation. ``There
is so much at stake this season. If clubs, and not districts, are to represent
Scotland in Europe next season then the outcome of the championship will be
crucial.
``I'm not sure which format I favour. If it is to be clubs then the positive
thing is that European money would come to the clubs and not the districts, but
if the clubs do get the go-ahead then we would probably have to recruit five
new players for the first-team pool.
``Either way, I just want to be involved. If it's to be district sides in
Europe then I want to be involved with the South,'' he said.
Already, Redpath can feel the rejuvenated Gary Armstrong breathing down his
neck. The Melrose man has seen off the challenge of Derrick Patterson and that
of the equally restored-to-fitness Andy Nicol to make the Scotland No.9 shirt
his own.
Armstrong was on the bench at Murrayfield on Saturday and on Monday night, in
an Edinburgh Borderers versus Peebles Select game to hansel Peebles ground
improvements, the Border duo will be involved in a head-to-head contest which
will be of immense interest to the international and South of Scotland
selectors.
``Let's take it one game at a time and first-up it's Stirling County. At the
start of the season Gary was just delighted to have got back from injury and to
be part of the Scotland set-up again. But I know that won't be enough and he'll
want to get back into the South and Scotland sides.
``The competition is good for all of us. All that I can do is play my own game
and hope that it's good enough. Before I even start thinking about that,
though, we've got a big game against Stirling tomorrow and that's what I'm
focusing on right now,'' he said.
Elsewhere today, Boroughmuir who trod on a banana skin at Myreside last
weekend, need a win over Heriot's FP and a Stirling victory over Melrose if
they are to maintain their cham-pionship challenge with a finishing line clash
against the Bridgehaugh men; Edinburgh Academicals are looking for a Division 1
lifeline against Watsonians and Hawick, minus leg-break victim Derek Turnbull
who will be sidelined for 12 weeks but has not considered retirement, are at
Netherdale for the latest instalment of their century-old rivalry with the Auld
Enemy, Gala.
q THE SRU fixtures working party met on Thursday night against a backdrop of a
growing clamour for league reconstruction, with many clubs now favouring a
10-team premiership. Apparently, the meeting was unable to reach any definite
conclusions as dates are still awaited for the European Championship which
Scottish clubs or districts will enter for the first time next season.
q INTERNATIONAL squad agent Ian McLauchlan has dismissed reports that
representatives of Kerry Packer are attempting to resurrect the Australian TV
mogul's rebel circus plans, with a global club championship and that Scottish
internationalists have been involved in talks. However, this latest initiative
comes as the top 12 Welsh clubs are discussing the possibility of a global club
championship bankrolled by a major brewery.

WHAT you saw on screen is what you got in real life. John Wayne, all-American
hero, worked hard, played hard and lived the life of a film star to the full.
He had all the trappings - the private jet, a yacht, helicopters, three wives,
seven children and the status of an icon.
His eldest son, Michael, who now runs his father's film company, Batjack, makes
clear his father did not confuse his screen personality with his real life.
``He was an actor, not a cowboy,'' he says. ``But he came to represent American
men to people throughout the world and he did possess values and qualities
people look up to - honesty, courage, independence and self reliance. He had
them inside him and he was able to project them onto the screen.''
Michael Wayne, who looks like his father, although not so tall, has just
restored Hondo, the first film Wayne made as an independent producer. It has
clearly affinities with Shane - lone woman living on a lonelty ranch with her
small son falls in love with handsome drifter - although none the worse for
that, it is being released on video.
Made in 1953 in a normal and a 3D version, as some of the shots show, Hondo has
not been seen for 16 years. Wayne was not at the peak of his career, because
his career was remarkably consistent in its success, but in his prime at the
time. When it was released on video last year in the United States it sold
550,000 copies, an amazing sale for a film starring a man who died 16 years
ago. But Wayne's appeal has never waned with the public.
``We have Harris polls in the United States and in the last two he was second
only to Clint Eastwood as America's favourite actor,'' Michael says. ``He beat
Cruise, Schwarzenegger, Stallone and whoever else there is. I find that
amazing.''
In Hondo, Wayne's co-stars are Geraldine Page, making her Hollywood debut and
gaining the first of her eight Academy Award nominations, and as his sidekick,
the wonder-dog, Lassie. It is a classic Western in which Wayne, as Hondo Lane,
utters one of those lines everyone remembers and everyone gets wrong, a line
which sums up the character he played so often on the screen: ``A man ought to
do what he thinks best.''
It was one of his favourite films, although the fact it was his first as
producer at a time when actors were thought unfit to tackle such roles, might
have had something to do with that. Hondo, which Hollywood had hoped might
fail, also proved one of the fastest in cinema history to pay out, recovering
its costs in the first eight weeks.
Michael says his father had told him the film he was proudest of was The Quiet
Man, not because of his own performance, but because everyone in it was so
good. He had also liked The Searchers, although he had always felt John Ford's
film did not receive the recognition it merited from the Academy, and was proud
of the Pacific war film, The Sands of Iwo Jima.
As for Hondo, that was the film in which he felt he had looked his best. But in
a career that started in silent films and during which he made over 150 films
it was hard for him to pick out favourites.
Michael preferred his father playing bad guys, and cites The Searchers, The
Sands of Iwo Jima and Red River. ``He played those roles with such
conviction,'' he says.
In fact, the roles are not so much those of bad guys, as of men with flawed
characters who are redeemed. He insists his father's screen persona was not all
that different from his real life one, unlike some Hollywood stars revealed as
having been anything but the kind, honest, generous, loving men they played to
public acclaim.
The film has been out of circulation for various reasons, chief among which was
that the original negative had been damaged by flood water in the vault where
it was kept.
``Restoration took a year,'' Michael says. ``It now looks like a brand new
film. It has only been shown on television twice in the last 35 years and if
you are under 25 you will never have had an opportunity to see it, so, to all
intents, it is a new film. The views it expresses about women and native
Americans are also amazingly contemporary even although it is now forty years
old.''
He says Wayne, although he ``drank hard, played hard and never did anything
half way,'' was a family man who took his children on the set with him and made
them work.
``We got to visit him during the summer on location, which is why a lot of us
gravitated into the film business, and we would get little jobs to do,'' he
says. ``On Hondo I was a gofer and had to look after the horses and the extras.
I ended up walking round with an attache case full of money to pay the Indians,
who had to be paid daily.''
As for Wayne the family man, guess who decorated the Christmas tree? Big John.
What about his father's reputation for holding extreme right-wing views?
HE replies: "John said if you were not liberal when you were young you had no
heart, and if you were not conservative when you were old you had no brain,''
Michael replies. ``He said it was the world around which had changed and he
felt he was a liberal. But he did have very strong views. He would, however,
listen to what people said. He once told me: `I cannot get any liberals to
listen to me.' He felt he was a liberal in the classical sense of the word and
he did not always vote the same way. You could not peg him exactly. He was
conservative in economic matters and very liberal in social matters.''
Big John really was big. He was 6ft 4in tall which, Michael says, presented
problems for some of his co-stars, film actors being notorious for being
vertically challenged.
``He also had the constitution of a bull,'' Michael says. ``Some people said he
drank enough to float a battle ship. On Hondo we had three days out when we
could not work because of some Mexican public holidays, so the cast and crew
ran on tequila and played poker for the three days. John won all the money, and
ended up winning Lassie and the other eight stand-in Lassies, as well as his
station wagon, from Rudd Wertzheimer, who trained the dogs. It was hot and he
made Rudd suffer for three or four days before he gave them back.''
n Hondo, released by VCI, is available in video stores now.

BADMINTON
SCOTTISH champion Anne Gibson moved into the semi-finals of the Scottish Open
yesterday, when she led Tanya Grove 11-3, 5-0 before the English girl retired,
suffering from a migraine, after just 15 minutes.
Gibson was scheduled to have a dress-fitting for her September wedding today,
so sure was she that a semi-final place was outwith her reach.
But she surpassed expectations to outstrip her best performance in the event
and do her Olympic cause a power of good.
``I'm normally at home watching Grandstand on the Saturday of the Scottish
Open,'' said Gibson, who will meet No.1 seed Catrine Bengtsson next.
Bruce Flockhart was not so lucky. He came up against English champion Anders
Nielsen, antagonised by a recent run-in with the Badminton Association of
England, and with a point to prove.
Nielsen destroyed the Scottish champion 15-2, 15-1 in just 20 minutes, wound up
by his dismissal from the England team and the withdrawal of his funding.

THE carnival is permanently stationed at Blackpool. Residents shop at
Woolworth's and Food Giant alongside the persistent noise of puggies, the sight
of Kiss-Me-Quick hats, and the smell of burger and onions. The only indication
of spiritual wealth is a school for probation officers and a Methodist Church
in the middle of the shopping precinct.
There is a consistent level of child-like immaturity here, borne out by the
names of amenities such as the Tache Niteclub, the Bellyfull Cafe, the Red
Peaches Chinese Restaurant, and the Honeycombe Sizzler Grill, which sounds like
an Elvis haunt in one of his sunny Hawaiian movies.
Blackpool is not unpretentious, it's tacky. It wants your money. But we're not
talking about casual spending. A week in Blackpool, after all, could get you a
fortnight in the Costa del Sol. No, this is where sad people go, where the
miserable go to get depressed. Enjoyment is gauged by how much you can drink,
eat, and lavish on trinkets only those who are used to being ripped off could
muster up enough enthusiasm to buy.
Harry Ramsden's fish and chip parlour on the promenade is always busy, the
waiters show you to a salted tablecloth and a bottle of brown sauce with all
the hush and verve of a French Maitre D'. I don't even want to think that this
could be the case, that Harry's is the Malmaison of the North. Most pubs have a
video karaoke and bingo, and there's always a talent contest in Linekar's Bar,
although you can't imagine anything more glamorous taking place than the
National Gurning Championships, when old men and women take their teeth out and
suck their faces.
Blackpool is an all-purpose venue, not a resort, hosting everything from
ballroom-dancing finals to Tory party conferences. Its most recently-opened
exhibition is The World of Coronation Street. I don't think a town can thrive
when it cannot rear its head above the restraints of working-class, popular
culture.
Here, you have to live with the promise but not the fruition of a good time. It
stultifies the soul. Every time you want to buy chops for tea you have to walk
past a gaping hypermarket selling popcorn and candyfloss, and pubs with
out-of-work brickies as bouncers, with pop songs pumping from the basement into
the street.
Blackpool's on hold. The beach isn't clean because from December to April,
there aren't any visitors to impress. The sea returns everything dumped in it,
secrets wash up on the shore and in Blackpool it's dummy tits and lager cans.
For five months during the off-peak season, the town limps along in a
half-life. On the promenade everyone is anoraked and cold, stopping in the
shut-up doorways of seasonal tourist traps to eat disposable cardboard trays of
chips. And magnificent Blackpool Tower, with its crazy nugget of electric
silver which zips repeatedly around its crown, puts up a ominous hum, like a
combustible generator in Gotham City.
Under Blackpool's umbrella of pleasure, there are people lurking, trying to
scratch a living, by providing more of it. These are independent businessmen
and women with no connection to Sea World or McDonald's. Their trade is housing
passing strangers who stop off for a week or weekend of fun. The Blackpool
landlord and landlady, while the rest of the town is in a constant state of
expectation, are embroiled in overhaul. Theirs is the sharpest perspective on
the town's crowd-pulling habit.
Some guest houses close during the winter, others stay open, a move which
immediately transmits the message that they didn't have a good summer season.
And there is always work going on, as owners of hotels try to improve their
facilities; new carpets, new wardrobes, shinier taps, brighter curtains. Behind
potted, leafy plants and the calm exterior of Reception, there is a back room
or kitchen being taken apart.
The Scots landlord lives in a place where being one step ahead of the game
means being able to lock a toilet to provide standard room accommodation, and
open it again for en suite. The Trentham Hotel is one of many on the prime site
of Albert Road, parallel to a multi-storey car park and walking distance from
the aforementioned burger giants.
McDonald's spend millions researching every spot in every street of every
country they want to sell in. They will only install a fast food joint where
there is enough human traffic and surrounding business to sustain it. Their
logo signifies untapped gold, like an oil rig in the middle of a desert. In
this way, by his proximity to the global octopus, Matt Allan, owner of the
Trentham Hotel, is assured that he has the best number of potential customers
in the town.
Matt Allan, 53, was born in Fife. When he left school he went to work for Rank
Cinemas in Glasgow and Ayr. He ran the Partick Tivoli. He ran a hotel in
Aviemore, complete with bingo and disco. He left for London and Mecca Leisure.
He's been living in England for 28 years and has run the Trentham for eight. To
the companies he worked for, he was a troubleshooter, a man who could implement
enough ideas to get the punters in and paying.
``I've moved 32 times. If you're willing to move and take on a place that's run
down, you get a cut of the profits you make, and I've made a lot of money in my
time.'' Matt's married to Sue, 37, but their relationship looked dodgy for a
while.
``The first year in Blackpool, we nearly went bankrupt. We had to take anything
with two legs and two arms. I nearly threw myself off the pier with the bloody
dog. We just didn't have enough money to get by. Sue went and sat on the wall
one night, during the evening meal, contemplating the same, because we'd had an
argument while cooking together. That's how bad it was.
``People were booking in at eight o' clock at night and I was walking up the
road to get bacon and eggs because we didn't have enough money to carry any
stock. We had beer crates, bricks, and tins of beans holding up the beds. It
was horrific. We survived by opening during the winter; now everybody's doing
it.''
Some Blackpool hoteliers are two years in arrears with their mortgage. One
place tripled in size during the boom in the seventies, but didn't triple in
business. There is a gentleman's agreement on the prices of a stay at each
hotel on the Albert Road, a sort of voluntary monopoly. Matt is one of four who
charge the same amount in the higher bracket.
``There are 3200 establishments like this in Blackpool, there are more beds
here than in Portugal. Twenty years ago people were trapped by train and car.
Now there are planes to take them all over the world. Some landlords forget
that.''
Most guests come twice a year. Eighty-two per cent of business is repeat and
referrals. Matt is the only landlord he knows who's on-line. The others think a
good butty and a warm room are enough for a hotel to stick in the imagination.
He uses the computer to send out material to past residents and therefore
advertises effectively, targeting business. He's managed to unearth guests who
stayed as far back as 1990. And then some.
During their opening year, Sue and Matt advertised the hotel in the Sunday
Post, and an old couple responded by turning up on their doorstep and asking
for a specific two weeks. They couldn't do it. The old lady burst into tears.
Turns out they'd got married in Blackpool 50 years before. ``They'd stayed here
in a certain room,'' says Sue. ``We eventually managed to get them in and they
come here every year. They brought us one of the original bills,'' she says
proudly, ``from Trentham Boarding Establishment 1944.''
In season, from Saturday to Saturday, the Trentham Hotel is full. And people
steal kettles, duvets, curtains, curtain hooks and tie-backs, and TVs. ``You've
got to be trusting,'' says Matt, but last year he caught a boy and a girl
nicking two plants from the main entrance, and his Christmas lights ``don't
last two minutes''.
He now has the hotel entrance on close circuit camera. But the Allans aren't
cynical. Last year, two guys from Clydebank spent so much at the hotel boozing
they ran out of money, so he and Sue decided to lend them #100, thinking they'd
never get it back, but they did, first thing on the Monday.
``I get to know everyone on a first-name basis. You do get attached to
people,'' says Matt. ``A lot of our guests are friendly, they tell us all about
their varicose-vein operations. I've sat in the bar until 3am with blokes going
through a divorce. Bartenders are taking the place of ministers and doctors,
you hear the same story again and again but from a different angle.''
When the season's over, the phone is mobbed by salesman selling double-glazing,
tiles, bed linen, and timeshare. They presume the Blackpool landlord is rich
and they want a slice. ``The past five years we've been the poorest we've ever
been in our life,'' says Matt. ``We've spent the value of the property on the
property again. The next five years is ours.''
Sue begins a typical day by doing the breakfasts, cleaning the kitchen, setting
the dining-room up, changing sheets and tidying the lounge. ``I can't sit down
for more than 15 minutes. Matt says to me, `Why do you eat so fast?' For the
simple reason that I can't sit down for being disturbed.''
While the obvious question forms in my head, Matt volunteers an answer. ``As a
couple it is very difficult to have any kind of relationship, especially on the
sexual side - you have to make an appointment.'' Not so, however, for some
guests. ``You get `the bonkers', as we call them,'' he says, ``booking in and
staying an hour during the afternoon.'' They pay for a night but deposit the
keys when they're finished. Sue changes the sheets and the room is up for grabs
again.
This is completely out of context, and shouldn't be mentioned in the same
breath, but they get a lot of MPs during the Tory conference too. Indeed, the
MPs' wives play bingo with Sue while their husbands get drunk. One lady guest
harangued Phil Gallie, insisting that she had seen him before. She decided that
he was a bus driver on her regular route, and chinned him for trying to argue
otherwise.
``The quality of life, running a hotel, is not particularly good,'' says Matt.
``You get used to working late nights, but I couldn't work nine to five. What
would I do with myself?'' The Allans are due to go on holiday to Lanzarote, but
they don't yet know how to relax.
They survive on the job. When they work, they have a reserve of energy and
aggression which allows them to fool around and have a laugh. Sue's speciality
is a plastic fried egg on a breakfast plate, especially for the man with the
hangover, usually placed with his wife's encouragement. This is pure Blackpool,
where fun is equal to companionship and a practical joke. And people come here
for a giggle, after all.

IT is not only courier companies for whom Christmas has come early as a result
of the postal strike. Firms such as Edinburgh computer specialist CGC have been
inundated with enquiries and orders for modems (and computers) over the last
few days. It seems everyone now wants to be on the Internet.
Companies have discovered it is a great way to communicate, and it's proving
good business for CGC. It's just a pity it won't be able to take full advantage
of the situation, having just sent out 12,000 catalogues to customers - by post!
Budget breakfast
is just the ticket
HERE'S an opportunity for anyone who wants to quickly get a grasp of what
Tuesday's Budget means. KPMG Tax Advisers will be up at the crack of dawn on
Wednesday, November 29, for a Big Budget Breakfast at Glasgow's Moat House
Hotel.
Guests will enjoy a full Scottish breakfast, light entertainment and expert
comment on what could be the last Budget before the election.
The editor of CA Magazine, Neil Fitzgerald, will give his own individual, and
we are told entertaining, interpretation of Kenneth Clarke's pronouncements.
And, to bring us all down to earth, KPMG tax partners Joy Travers, Donald
Adamson and Campbell Denholm will assess Tuesday's highs and lows as well as
their impact on business.
Attendance is by invitation only, but Business Diary in an exclusive scoop (I
can't remember when I last had one of those) has arranged with KPMG for 10 free
tickets to the Big Budget Breakfast to be made available to our readers. To win
one all you have to do is answer this simple question: who was the last
Scots-born Chancellor? The tickets will go to the first 10 people who give
Fiona Campbell at KPMG the correct answer either by telephoning her on 0141 226
5511, extension 3416, or by fax on 0141 204 3092.
KPMG has also kindly agreed to donate the value of the tickets to the Princess
Royal Trust for Carers, and John Paterson, fundraising director of the charity,
will attend the breakfast to accept the cheque.
Praise for Scots
business skills
SCOTLAND, it seems, was coming in for a lot of praise for its efforts to
increase the level of entrepreneurship in its economy at the Europe 500
conference in Ghent recently.
Present were entrepreneurs and academics not only from Western Europe but also
the former Eastern Bloc countries and the US.
The four-day conference heard how Scotland was leading the way in improving the
business birthrate. Jimmy Gordon and Vera Weisfeld were among those attending
but I am assured it was not a case of self-praise.
Russel Griggs, director of business development at Scottish Enterprise, gave an
address having arrived from Madrid where he had been speaking to European
businesses, and he was pleased with the way Scotland was being viewed by the
European business community.
I was sorry to hear, however, that Ron Lander, chair of the Scottish
Entrepreneur Exchange, became unwell while attending Europe 500, but I am glad
to say he is recovering well and will be returning to Scotland early next week.
Gift of the garb
for the President
HANDS up those readers who said who is that guy with Ross Harper? It is, of
course, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa whom Professor Harper met
while on a visit to Johannesburg in his capacity as president of the
International Bar Association.
Harper led a delegation of 16 African bar leaders on a visit to President
Mandela's private residence in Pretoria.
He presented the President with an International Bar Association tie and a pair
of cufflinks. It was only after making the presentation that he spotted that
President Mandela was dressed in his favoured garb, a traditional African-style
shirt not normally accompanied by a tie or cufflinks!
Old east-west
divide still exists
EUROPE might think we are doing well in the entrepreneur field but George
Hammersley, chief executive of Business Ventures Ltd, is not so sure.
At BVL's annual dinner during the week he told his audience at the Stakis
Grosvenor Hotel in Glasgow: ``What we are finding is that there is no shortage
of quality entrepreneurs in Scotland but there is a marked lack of ideas.
``As a nation, we tend to focus too much on our own backyard, and not take in
what is happening not only in the UK but globally. This parochialism is not
just on a national level either. many would-be businessmen limit their view of
the horizon to what the competition next door is doing.''
I can understand what Hammersley was talking about. I recently had reason to
talk to an Aberdeen firm which had opened an office in Falkirk. When I asked
why Falkirk, I was told it had been advised that if it opened in Edinburgh,
Glasgow companies would not deal with it and vice versa.
Good business for Falkirk.
Return to sender
address unknown
PATRICIA McGhee of PMG Events is wondering if she is a victim of a pre-emptive
strike by postal workers in Edinburgh.
She had attended the opening of the the Edinburgh International Conference
Centre and enjoyed it so much she decided to drop Trevor McCartney, the sales
and marketing director of the EICC, a little letter thanking him.
This she did, carefully addressing it to Mr T McCartney, Sales and Marketing
Director, EICC, Morrison Street, Edinburgh EH3 8EE. You can imagine her
surprise when the letter was returned to her office in Coatbridge by the Royal
Mail marked ``address incomplete''.
Business Diary checked the address with the EICC and it confirmed the postcode
and everything else was correct. The only thing missing was The Exchange, which
should be inserted before Morrison Street. However, I was assured mail arrives
every day (when there isn't a strike on) without this particular addition, as
originally it was not part of the address.
Perhaps the postie couldn't see the EICC for looking at it.

``HEGGIE'S gone soft,'' I wrote in my notebook during Iain Heggie's first
full-length play in five years. I suppose I was thinking back to Clyde Nouveau
and the performance of a pre-Lipstick On Your Collar Douglas Henshall, eyes
staring manically, veins pulsing across his forehead, as the playwright's
unforgiving dialogue took brutal control.
By contrast, this play even brings to mind Alan Ayckbourn, an idea not
discouraged by Laurie Dennett's restrictively dominating back-garden set.
Though tougher, more plausible and less bourgeois than much of Ayckbourn's
stuff, An Experienced Woman treads similar territory - love, lust, truth, lies,
and the way relationships are governed as much by self-deception as by the
deception of others.
Heggie plays a fascinating game, because he knows the line between revealing
sex comedy and complacent sitcom is easily crossed. He deliberately goes into
the grey area where cliche meets truth, picking apart the entanglement of
trivia and profound feeling, deliberately confusing the facts - Is she a
virgin? Did he two-time? - to show us that deeper motivations matter more.
If the play doesn't hit the great comic highs and tragic lows it portends, the
scatter-gun language is still a joy. At its best it bounces like a basketball
between a brilliant league-topping cast - Siobhan Redmond, David Tennant, Jenny
McCrindle, Alastair Galbraith and Alexander Morton - with loads of great
one-liners fuelled by the comic release of characters saying exactly what they
think.
Matthew Lloyd's production is bright, vivid and sharply-timed, even if the
inclusion of an exploding garden shed suggests he thinks he's directing a naff
West End farce. The only shame is you have to travel upwards of 200 miles to
see it.

BERWICK Rangers manager Tom Hendrie might not agree with the description that
his team are ``in the middle'' of a slump. He probably would prefer to think
that they are towards the far end of it.
Unhappily, Tuesday night's goalless draw against Queen of the South did nothing
to help the cause, with Mark Wilson being carried off in the first half with a
recurrence of a knee injury. However, granted the severity of the crisis -
Hendrie has had to put himself on the bench - things could be much worse.
Today, Berwick make the long trip to Forfar, whose morale cannot be great after
having just become the first team to lose to their neighbours, Montrose. The
Albion are home to Stranraer.
Stenhousemuir last week became the first visitors to win at Methil, and are at
home today to Clyde. The bottom two, Ayr and Montrose, clash at Somerset Park.
Like East Fife upstairs, third-division leaders Livingston also lost at home
last week and have seen their advantage cut to four points. Jim Leishman's men
should find it easier away to Albion Rovers and it will be interesting to see
how many of their new-found support travel to follow the team.
Cowdenbeath hope to upset the second-placed team, Ross County, when the
Dingwall men visit Fife. High-scoring Caledonian Thistle, shut out last week by
their Highland rivals, should have too much power again for Alloa, while
Brechin City should confirm that Queen's Park are poor travellers.

BEING neither 13, female, nor febrile, I spent most of last night trying to
hear myself think above 8000 hormone-addled shriekers. I pondered many topics.
The deliberate mis-spelling inherent to Ultimate Kaos's very name. For more
truly they are Ultimately Kack. And oh, the cruel aptness of a common
abbreviation of Smash Hits' title: the teeny-bop magazine shall forever be
called S. Hits.
More relevantly, I considered the links between Britpop and Britpap. Someone
played All Or Nothing by the god-like Small Faces during last night's interval,
see. Small Faces, 1965; conceived as prefabricated pretty-boy Britpap to make
girlies scream.
And it is with the long-lost Mr Marriott and Co that contemporary Britpop, as
practised by Blur and Supergrass and generally perceived to be A Good Thing,
has its roots.
So who among last night's mammoth bill will spark a critically-acclaimed
movement 30 years hence? Eeh. Um. Ah. Who will still be remembered next week?
Er, well . . . there is a certain lumpy charm to Clock, a boy-girl duo who
plainly care not that their on-stage musical virtuosity makes Milli Vanilli
resemble the Grateful Dead. And one of ASAP's vocalists resembled Firhill
legend Chic Charnley. Only Chic can probably sing better.
And deuce are almost as good as the terminally-clueless Brotherhood of Man.
Some feat, you'll agree.
Ach, I can't kid you, though. Today's Britpap. It's ...it's ... there's a word
I'm looking for. It rhymes with "Brit".

HUNTLY assistant manager Willie Lawson yesterday defended player-manager Doug
Rougvie amid claims the former Aberdeen and Chelsea star lacks finesse in
man-management.
Lawson scorned suggestions Huntly are on the slide under Rougvie's leadership,
and stressed this week's walk-out by Brian Thomson, who has scored 149 goals in
five seasons at Christie Park, was an isolated incident. The champions face
title-challengers Keith today in a derby match.
Lawson said: ``Doug has taken us to the top of the league, we've won the
Highland League Cup, and under his leadership, we can win the treble.''
Rougvie misses today's tie because of flu, while Huntly are also without
suspended Eddie Copland and Alan Selbie. Steve Gray is back after serving a
two-match ban, but Arthur Murphy is out with cartilage trouble.

RANGERS remain undaunted in their search for success despite gloomy results in
the Champions' League, and they are already being given huge backing from their
support as they attempt to build a side which can add European success to their
many triumphs at domestic level.
The signing of Brazilian striker Jardel from the South American champions,
Gremio, has been agreed, and he will be at Ibrox early in the New Year to begin
his premier division career.
More than that, the champions will add further to their squad because of the
immense increase in turnover they are experiencing this season.
While they have failed on the field in the Champions' League, they have been
able to draw in more than #5m from their three home games, television receipts,
and the payout from the European Union.
I understand that gives Rangers a profit of #4m and allied to their new Nike
deal and increased gates for their domestic games, their annual turnover could
reach an astonishing #30m over the financial year. Much of that money will be
ploughed into buying new players.
Jardel, who scored 41 goals in 49 games for the Brazilian champions in their
league programme, is, unusually for a Brazilian, in the British mould. That is
what has attracted Rangers.
The 6ft 2in, 22-year-old is powerful in the air and aggressive. The only
problems Rangers have still to clear are those of a work permit, which will not
be a stumbling block for a player of this calibre.
But the worrying thing for the remaining sides in Scottish football is that
chairman David Murray and his manager, Walter Smith, are not ready, this time
round, to wait for the close season and then attempt to fashion a side which
can do well in Europe within a few months.
They want to spend now. And they will do so. Jardel at #2.5m is just a
beginning. At least one more major player will come in to boost Rangers in
their title bid and then be allowed to settle into the squad before Europe
looms once more.
The money is there. And the money will be spent. Scottish football will be left
looking on in envy at just what the Champions' League can produce even when you
are less than successful. It is, quite simply, a passport to riches.
For today's trip to Easter Road, the champions have a number of their
first-team squad suffering from injuries, some serious, others not, but all of
them enough to stop Smith naming a pool of players for the match against Hibs.
Yesterday, Smith ruled out Ian Ferguson and indicated that Stuart McCall was
very doubtful, then limited himself to talking in general terms about the game
itself.
``Hibs are still sitting third in the table,'' he said, ``and they are a team
we always thought would be in there challenging at the top. Nothing so far has
changed that view for me, but we want to go there and get a result. It still
rankles that they beat us at Ibrox and we would like to turn that result round.
``However, it will not be easy. It is always a difficult place to win points
for us. But I doubt if the midweek result will affect the players. If there was
going to be any way their confidence was to be affected, then it would have
happened before this. As it stands, our premier division form has been very
good and we want that to continue.
``We have had a couple of home games, now we face two tough away games and we
want to win them.''
Hibs will have Michael O'Neill back after suspension, although the Northern
Ireland man will begin another three-game ban soon. Still, he is a big occasion
player and nothing comes much bigger for Hibs than a visit from the Ibrox club.
Manager Alex Miller said: ``If we are to get a result then we will have to make
Rangers work. And we have to make them work hard. They know they can never just
come here and get a result, and we will have to prove that to them again.''
If they can do that, then Hibs may open up the race for the title. If they fail
to repeat their early season result at Ibrox, the title could become a dogfight
between Rangers and their Old Firm rivals, Celtic.
What is essential for Miller and his men today, however, is making sure that
they can keep themselves involved in that battle at the top. Not only for
themselves, but for all of Scottish football.

THE race to succeed John Ross as president of the National Farmers Union of
Scotland is hotting up with the young pretender, George Lyon, of Bute, setting
the pace.
Mr Lyon, who announced his candidacy at the November council meeting, is
challenging the two vice-presidents, Sandy Mole and Stewart Whiteford, with a
radical manifesto designed to take the union and its 17,000 members into the
next century.
Mr Lyon is part-way through a series of at least 14 speaking arrangements aimed
at getting his message across to the grass roots of the union whose views he
believes are too often ignored. Speaking in the Borders, Mr Lyon said:
``Frequently we have been both backward and inward looking. I want to change
that and put the union on a more pro-active footing.''
Mr Lyon reckoned that the CAP will change after 2000 as the Gatt package on
world trade begins to bite, and that Scottish agriculture must be ready for big
changes and a more competitive era.
Mr Lyon also said he wished to see the NFU become more involved in marketing
the industry.
Environmental and welfare issues, claimed Mr Lyon, were likely to be even more
important. He said: ``I see this as more of an opportunity, but we have to
build bridges with the mainstream organiations and make them our allies. We
have to get out there and talk to them and let them know what Scottish farming
is all about.''
The lobbying between the three candidates will continue until the union's
annual meeting in Ayr next March, but of more immediate concern to Mr Lyon is
the Government's consultative paper on animal transport and welfare.

<HEADLINE>Research head predicts phasing out by 2000 EU warning over milk quota system</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>26</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975208563</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE system of milk quotas is beginning to look increasingly inconsistent with
European Commission thinking on how the Common Agricultural Policy should
evolve, according to Jim Ward, head of agricultural research with land agents
Savills.
Cuts in milk support prices, together with the phasing out of quotas after the
year 2000, is an increasingly likely prospect, he suggests in his firm's latest
monthly CAP briefing.
``The combination of quotas and high milk prices does not sit comfortably with
farm commissioner Franz Fischler's new emphasis on participation in the growth
of world trade and the importance of competitiveness and the need to export
without subsidies,'' he said.
``The quota system could be retained but the Gatt constraint is likely to force
reductions in quota and thus higher prices. Loosening the quota system via
cross-border trading is a political non-starter and two-tier quota on the sugar
beet model appears to be too difficult to administer and too open to fraud for
it to gain widespread political support.''
The remaining option, he suggests, is to cut intervention prices, probably with
compensation, and to phase out quotas over a period of about five years from
the year 2000.
``Remembering that Franz Fischler has a preference for supporting small farming
units, and that previous reforms have either introduced or attempted to
introduce capping of compensation, there is a good case for maintaining as many
separate dairy businesses as possible.''
Mr Ward reports persistent speculation that there will an effective 1% milk
quota increase this year - via a technical adjustment to butterfat
calculations. ``The official Commission line is that only the Dutch are in
favour and little support is expected from other members states or the
Commission,'' he added.
Any threat to the quota system will be taken seriously by the dairy industry
where quotas have become a valuable asset capable of being traded in their own
right. They have become the means whereby farmers have been able to consider
early retiral either through selling quota or leasing it out to produce a
regular income without the seven-days-a-week hassle of dairy farming.
Out of the quota system has grown a quota market, providing an additional
source of business for brokers.
The concept of quotas has not been without its critics. One regular complaint
is that quotas, and the values attached to them, make it difficult for new
entrants to get a start in farming, especially in the dairy and sheep sectors.
The CAP briefing points out that Commissioner Fischler's views on the need for
reform are in marked contrast to what was the official Commission line earlier
in the year - that what was required was a fine tuning of a successfully
reformed CAP.
The new emphasis could mean less price support, separate and transparent income
support, and a goal of integrated rural development. There is an implication
that environmental and income support should become a member state
responsibility.

REPRESENTATIVES of meat companies and livestock auctioneers are to meet in
Edinburgh today for talks on how the disposal of specified bovine offal (SBO)
should be financed.
Special measures for disposal - as part of the BSE eradication process - have
been costing abattoirs an average of #7 per animal. The meat companies'
proposal that #3.50 per animal should be deducted by auctioneers from the
selling price caused a rift between meat companies, auctioneers, and farmers.
One attempt at negotiation failed earlier this week when a meeting in
Birmingham was cancelled. Auctioneers and meat companies agree the problem
affects all the industry and that an all-industry solution would be best.

TEN years ago there was scarcely a plastics industry in Scotland. Then, with
the massive expansion of foreign investment in plastics-using industries in the
Central Belt, great opportunities opened up for specialist manufacturers.
Blazing a trail as Scotland's number one supplier of plastic injection moulding
in a full range of engineering thermoplastics is Inchinnan-based Silleck
Mouldings (Scotland), November's TrailBlazer of the month.
John Adams, Silleck's managing director, has presided over a number of
trailblazing achievements, which are all the more creditable given that, as
part of a group which included three operations bought by its management in
1983, their holding company went into receivership in 1992.
The engineering company EIS bought the two profitable Silleck companies, one in
Stockton-on-Tees, the other at Inchinnan. A third operation, in East Kilbride,
was acquired by another group but closed down within six months.
Since then one of the keys to Silleck's success has been capital investment by
EIS. Close to #4m has been put in since January 1993. This has helped it more
than double its annual turnover of #5m to an estimated #11.5m for 1995 and to
double its factory production size.
It has also allowed the company to buy state-of-the-art machinery: top of the
range robotics equipment, milling machines linked with auto CAD, and material
handling systems which are second to none. In two years, it has gone from
having 24 moulding machines to 48.
The holding company's investment in capital intensive equipment has been
accompanied by a well-justified hands-off approach to local management. Silleck
Inchinnan has driven all its own achievements, says John Adams - it operates
entirely independently.
EIS's investment in automation has not only increased the company's capacity,
but has also enabled it to produce a wide range of plastic components in a
variety of materials.
One new investment with which Adams is particularly pleased is a 20-tonne,
40-foot storage container. It has improved cost effectiveness of the company's
bulk material handling enormously. Silleck is the first plastics company in
Europe to use this in preference to the more traditional silos.
Around 90% of Silleck's business is within 50 miles of Inchinnan, so it can
easily supply quantities at the required quality with speed and flexibility to
customers who are themselves mostly expanding exporters to a world market. The
machinery operates round the clock, seven days a week, so orders can be
processed and delivered, when necessary, within 24 hours.
Because plastics moulding is such a new industry there is a skills shortage.
Adams is justifiably proud of Silleck's training record. It is the first
Scottish plastics firm to have an organised training scheme recognised by the
British Plastics Training Board. Each year it takes on a number of apprentice
moulding technicians and toolroom engineers. Among the 260 staff, it has the
most highly qualified moulding technologists in Scotland.
``Silleck Moulding impressed the judges by its spectacular growth, its
commitment to training, the investment in state-of-the-art technology and the
way it has re-organised and developed its facilities using best practice from
all over the world,'' comments John Ker, head of entrepreneurial services at
Ernst &amp; Young's Glasgow office. ``It is a worthy winner for November.''

INJURIES have hit the headlines as far as the first-division leaders,
Dunfermline, and a few others, are concerned. But bruised egos after last
week's results probably have required psychology rather than physiotherapy, as
preparation for today's matches.
Dundee United, for example, might be expected to be on a downer after last
week's derby defeat. No chance, according to coach Maurice Malpas.
The fact that their neighbours are involved in a cup final at Hampden which may
see European football arrive just down the road from Tannadice, will add steel
to their visit to Broadwood to face an equally thrawn Airdrie side whose lack
of goals have given them their major problems so far.
Take your pick for a result from that one, although Malpas admitted yesterday:
``We have got last week out of our system, but we know Airdrie will be
difficult.''
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton has good news for a change. Back come skipper
Norrie McCathie, Allan Moore, Hamish French, and Ivo den Biemen. Marc Millar
also looks a starter, but striker Stewart Petrie is trying to recover from flu.
Ryan Hegarty, who made such an impression against St Johnstone last week, has
been signed after having scored in Dunfermline reserves' 6-1 hammering of
Cowdenbeath. Still better news is that Andy Smith and Brian Rice also soon will
be available, Smith being the long-term broken-leg victim who could turn round
the Fifers' fortunes if he can find again the form that made him such a
favourite with the fans at Airdrie.
The visitors to East End Park today are Morton, who have had to be treated for
bruised egos from last week's home derby defeat by St Mirren.
Peter Cormack is suspended, defender Steve McCahill faces a fitness test, and
manager Allan McGraw puts his trust in Craig McPherson in midfield for his full
first-team debut. Filling the Derek McInnes gap is a big task for anyone.
St Johnstone are at Clydebank, and trying for their fourth straight victory -
dare manager Paul Sturrock hope for such a feat - while the resurgence of St
Mirren should, on paper, take care of Hamilton at Love Street.

GREG Norman came under fire from course superintendent Graeme Grant yesterday
on the second day of the Heineken Australian Open at Kingston Heath.
Following criticism by Norman over the pace of the greens, Grant said there was
a lack of understanding of what he and his team were trying to do, and added:
``He's made it very difficult for me and my staff. They were upset, concerned
and demotivated - and very hurt.''
Norman had reckoned the greens were faster than Augusta National. ``Some of
them must have been 15 on the stimpmeter,'' he claimed.
``They were under 12,'' Grant fumed, ``and if there were any nightmarish putts,
as he claimed, there are places you shouldn't be on these greens. It's down to
him to hit the ball in the right place.''
Norman, who had a better day yesterday with a 69 that included 31 putts, said
the course was in great shape and he was pleased to be back in contention ``on
a course I enjoy.'' His total of 141, three under par, left him alongside John
Daly, three behind the leader, fellow Australian Peter McWhinney.
Daly led on seven under par after eight birdies in the first 14 holes including
six in a row from the fourth. ``I don't know how the hell I did that,'' he
said. Then he bombed with four bogeys. ``I don't know where they came from
either,'' he smiled. Leading scores (Australians unless stated):
138 - P McWhinney 68, 70.
140 - W Grady 69, 71; R Whitlock 68, 72.
141 - T Gale 71, 70; J Daly (USA) 73, 68; G Norman 72, 69.
Others: 144 - M Hallberg (Sweden) 72, 72; B Jackson (England) 73, 71. 145 - R
Allenby 71, 74; C van der Velde (Holland) 73, 72. 146 - B Faxon (USA) 70, 76; S
Elkington 71, 75. 147 - M Campbell (New Zealand) 69, 78. 148 - G Evans
(England) 74, 74.
q OVERNIGHT leader Kiyoshi Maita shot the day's low of 68 yesterday for a
four-stroke lead midway through the $1.5m Casio World Open over the 7014-yard,
par-72 Ibusuki course in western Japan. Ryder Cup player Costantino Rocca was
top European, seven off the pace. Leading scores (Japanese unless stated):
133 - K Maita 65, 68.
137 - H Meshiai 66, 71.
139 - M Ozaki 70, 69; K Tomori 69, 70; Y Kaneko 68, 71.
140 - C Franco (Paraguay) 70, 70; C Rocca (Italy) 70, 70; R Backwell
(Australia) 69, 71; K Takami 68, 72.
Others: 141 - V Singh (Fiji) 70, 71. 142 - P Walton (Ireland) 70, 72; J
Haeggman (Sweden) 70, 72. 143 - L Janzen (USA) 70, 73. 144 - M A Jimenez
(Spain) 73, 71.
q HOLDER and overnight leader Isao Aoki shot a 67 yesterday for an aggregate of
12-under-par 132 and a one-shot lead after two rounds in the $500,000 Japan
Senior Open. One behind was Masaru Amano, who had a 66 over the 6753-yard,
par-72 Kitaura Golf Club course, north-east of Tokyo. South Africa's Gary
Player shot a 69 and was tied for sixth at 138.
q NICK Price moved within one shot of the lead in the Zimbabwe Open at Royal
Harare yesterday with a seven-under-par 65 for a 36-hole total of 135. He
shares third place with countryman Mark McNulty (66). Co-leaders are South
Africans Bobby Lincoln and Brenden Pappas (both 67).

Scotland's World Cup hopes, but the need for a miracle tae rekinnle oor
cultural identity an belief in oorsels as a nation. Is a miracle indeed oor ane
an only hope?
As we pey tribute tae auld Saunt Aundra at this time o year, it's shairly time
tae reflect on the state o Scotland the day, an tae ask whit dae we really feel
aboot oor wee country an whit does it really mean tae caw oorsels Scots? Dae we
no hae enough confidence on oorsels tae dae withoot miracles, or are we still
wannerin roun in circles, lik the lost tribes o Israel, wi the pessimists
wailin ``this is oor fate, we maun dree oor weird?'' An a gey weird lot we are
tae!
Thinkin aboot the need for miracles shoud remind us St Aundra widnae blate at
workin a miracle or twa, an mibbie we coud dae wi some o his divine
intervention the day. For a stert he is the maist symbolic patron saint o the
state o Scotland an Scottish identity in aw its contradictions. Efter awe,
we've aye had oor crosses to bear throughoot history, wi steyin next tae the
English, never mind haein tae pit up wi ane anither.
But oor flag reminds us tae o a crossroads; mibbie the crossroads o oor
history? An tae tell the truith, we're no aw that shair whaur we go fe here,
sae in the meantime we'll just byde whaur we are, an argue aboot whit wid be
the best road tae tak, or blame ithers that we're nae further furrit. Lik the
tribes o Israel we've been here afore, an in fact legend has it we are the
loast tribe!
Yet mibbie Aundra's auld cross can be seen as an intersection? But is that no a
kinna ambiguous symbol: as lines gaun oot in opposite directions fae the
centre, a symbol o a nation pouin in different directions at the same time an
gaun nawwhaur, or is it actually possible tae see the intersection as fower
lines meetin in the centre an thus a symbol o unity?
We are nae dout a puzzle tae ither nations: a nation withoot a state that
cannae, or mibbie disnae want tae, agree about whit kinna political expression
oor sense o nationhood shoud hae. While we're often fanatical supporters o oor
national teams, especially agin the English, are we really as Jim Sillars says,
90 meenit patriots? Or is it jist we cannae get the gither tae agree aboot
onythin ither than supportin a daurk blue jersey?
Is it at aw possible tae reconcile at least some o oor differences, an fin
somethin we can aw agree aboot, or is that somethin that wid need no just wan
miracle, but a hail bagfu, mair than een a Michael Scott or Merlin coud've
managed? As Willie    McIlvanney says, there's nuthin mair divisive in Scottish
politics than a call for unity!
If we really are doomed aye tae disagree, mibbie we are in sair need o
miracles. But jist haud on a meenit! Think o the wey oor tartan tribes o fitba
supporters hae brocht aboot a miraculous transformation in oor image: nae
langer are we seen as hordes o alcoholic Huns, but as the best behaved
frienliest fans in Europe, an that's official! Even if some o oor scaffie tykes
cannae afford tae support the team, nae maitter; it's nearly enough tae mak us
believe in miracles efter aw, an it's definitely wan up on the English!
Yet, a suppose we hae tae gie the English their due. Whaur wid we be withoot
thaim? For a stert, wha else wid we hae tae blame? For if it's no easy tae
define oor identity in a positive sense, it's aye easy enough in a negative
wey: we arenae English! Furthermair, is it no pairtly thanks tae thaim that we
hae twa o oor greatest claims tae fame in world history?
Naw, I'm no referrin tae the invention o fitba an gowf, but furstly tae the
fact Edward I, ``hammer o the Scots'', hammered us, in mair weys than ane,
intae a nation, though it taen a Bruce tae hammer oot aw oor differences an mak
us fecht tegither tae become the furst nation in history tae assert oor richt
tae exist as a fre an independent nation.
An the secont claim? We wir without a dout, the furst nation tae vote itself
oot o existence as an independent nation, even if it wis wi a wee bit o help
fae English gowd tae persuade mony o oor guid Scots Lords (``sic a parcel o
rogues'') o the economic advantages o the Union. Twa fursts in world history!
We arra peepul, eh?
Whither this entitles us tae be seen as unique or uniquely daft, an whether the
Union has brocht us mair advantages than disadvantages, we can argue aboot till
we're tartan in the face, but if we jist leuk at the history o Nor sea ile an
gas owre the last twenty year, or leuk furrit intae the twenty furst century,
it's nou as obvious as clabber on a coo's erse that we hae buin asked tae
swalla lees that Goebbels wid hae been prood of: eg, that there wisnae aw that
much ile there onywey, an it wid suin run oot, especially if we voted for
independence, an that we get faur mair than oor share o Government spendin etc.
Only a numptie coud believe whids o this size, but then mibbie we are a nation
o numpties, for a helluva lot o us hinnae yet waukent up tae the fact that they
are lees at aw! Sae mibbie that diagonal cross is ment tae be vertical, an jist
got cowped on its side, a bit lik the state o Scotland the day? For whit ither
country has discovert ile an edit up worse aff?
Whiteer we think aboot the economics o the Union, it's gey hard tae avoid the
fact the cultural legacy wis near fatal. Insteid o benefittin fae the positive
influences o a kizzen language an culture, we suffered the humiliation an
repression o cultural imperialism an bein brainwasht intae thinkin aw oor
native languages, Gaelic an Scots, wir only fit for barbarians an sheuch
howkers, no for educatit folk at aw. Nae wunner we still hae teachers an
parents, an ``odd'' judges whaw shoud ken better, a perpetuatin ignorance an
prejudice aboot ony form a Lowland Scots, rural or urban. Withoot a doubt, the
``dinnae say ay'' mentality is deeply implanted intae maist Scots' heids lik a
genetic tumour.
Yet mibbie language is in fact the key, for in some weys it's oor language that
maks us whit we are, or at least tries tae say whit we are; say mibbie language
hauds the key tae oor identity? While plenty o folk hae pruived Edwin Muir
wrang aboot only bein able tae think in English but feel in Scots, mibbie this
is still at the root o mony o oor problems, baith individually an as a nation.
An if we are leukin for miracles, shairly it's nuthin short o miraculous, that
in spite o aw the forces tryin tae kill aff the Scots tongue for the past two
thrie hunner year, it is faur fae deid, for its ruits are gey deep, an its
words spread lik thistle seeds on every braith o win.
An whit further pruif o the resilience o Scotland's tongues dae we need than
the fact we hae seen a great flooerin o Scottish Literature an culture in this
century, expressin itsel in aw oor leids, Gaelic, Scots, an English, or a
mixture o twa or even sometimes thrie o them, an a lot mair o this is nou bein
taught in oor schuils. Even in the Scottish Education Depairtment things are
chyngin, for we noo hae a glisk o ane or twa sma miracles at work there, for
believe or no it is in fact S.E.D. policy tae encourage the uise o Scots in oor
schuils.
Whit we really need though is tae stert seein oor linguistic diversity an
flexibility as a great cultural asset, no as a problem, an tae equip oor
students an teachers tae cope we genuine bilingual education, sae that aw Scots
weans learn tae read an write in Gaelic or Scots as weel as English. Thus we
coud hae a genuinely independent Scottish educational system tae be prood o,
ane that celebrates the rich linguistic heritage o a Scotland o mony different
tongues, includin the new anes brocht here bi       mair recent incomers, a
genuine multi-   cultural Scotland. If ither wee countries or minority cultures
can manage this, why no Scotland?
At the same time it micht offer us a model o hou we shoud see oorsels an hou we
shoud relate tae ithers: in ither words a culture that values its ain diversity
an appreciates that diversity is whit maks us interestin as individuals an as a
species, a country that values its ain culture an identity, withoot thinkin
itsel inferior or superior tae ithers; for it's only fae a genuine love o ye
ain culture an whit maks ye byordinair, that yet can develop a love an respect
o whit maks ither folk unique, an sae value their differences as important an
complementary tae yer ain culture; for if ye dinnae love yer ain folk, wi aw
their imperfections, ye cannie love the rest o the world.
Yet accordin tae the heid boy o the Labour pairty, Tony Blair, ``Nationalism,
no matter how it is dressed up, always leads to narrow chauvinism.'' If this is
representative o the deal depth o his thinkin then he clearly needs tae think a
lot less in sounbites an cliches. Chauvinism is a legacy o Imperialism, a
pervertit form o Nationalism that leuks doon on ithers as inferior, a twin o
racialism, often a legacy o imperialism, somethin that Britain still hasnae
managed tae shake aff.
An ironically there wis nae shortage o chauvinistic Union Jack wavin at baith
Labour an Tory Conferences in October, makkin it gey hard tae distinguish ane
fae the ither.
Genuine nationalism is ruitit in a love o yer ain freedom but equally values
ither folk's freedom, an kens richt weel, fae yer ain experience, that
respectin the freedom o wee nations, an minority cultures, is the best wey tae
bring aboot freedom an human richts for the haill world, somethin that
chauvinists, racist, religious or political fanatics, or Empire builders o ony
form, cannae thole or jist dinnae unnerstaun.
Haein the richt tae be oorsels disnae mean turnin inwards an only carin aboot
oorsels, but in learnin tae respect, tolerate an byde in peace wi oor fella
Scots an ither folk, stertin wi oor neebours, especially fae sooth o the
Border. In fact if we stertit blamin thaims a lot less an oorsels a lot mair,
that wid be a furst step in the richt direction, for oor future lies in oor ain
hauns, if we hae the smeddum tae wrastle wi it, no in blamin ithers for oor ain
failins, or in waitin for miracles fae Westminster or God.
A cultural seachynge, even a wee earthquake or twa is whit we'll need tae bring
aw this aboot though, but the signs are there that at least it micht need
somethin short o a miracle. Comin tae terms wi oor language an identity micht
no solve oor political an economic ills, bit it micht at least gie us the
confidence tae stert believin in oorsels as a nation an tae show the rest o the
world, but furstly tae oorsels, that we are stertin tae grew up, or wauken up,
that we hae staggered oot o the mists o Brigadoon, an dinnae need fairytales or
miracles tae survive as a nation. As MacDiarmid's drunk man says: ``Pu Scotland
up an wha can say it winnae bud an blossom tae.''
If it isnae aw clear whit St Aundra's auld cross stauns for as a national flag,
mibbie a thistle plantit in the middle o it wid gie us a faur clearer symbolic
statement aboot the nature o Scotland an a bein a Scot.
Nae dout oor critics coud say that wid jist show whit a prickly lot we are, but
folk that ken mair aboot thistles ken that as weel as jaggy leafs an thorns,
they hae deep ruits, an bonnie wee purple flooers that scatter a hairst o
thristly seeds driftin tae aw the fower airts, an will suin tak ruit again, nae
maitter how puir the syle is, or that when it is cut don, it suin lowps back up
again: a teuch, yirdy, an bonnie symbol for the survival o oor languages and
identity, as weel as the contradictions in oorsels that we sairly need tae
grapple wi, if we are ever tae ``rise an be a nation again'', an no jist sing
aboot it.
Sae jyne me in a toast tae the saltire an the thistle, but whether or no ye
think this has buin jist anither drunk man leukin at the thistle, I'll lea up
tae yersels.

Music
THE Scottish Chamber Orchestra's trip to Japan left a gap in its Scottish
programmes successfully filled this week by the SCO Chorus with a group of
young brass players from the RSAMD. The resultant concert of psalms, motets,
part-songs, and brass pieces, built around a beautifully pure account of
Poulenc's G major Mass, may have lacked audience appeal, to judge by the number
of empty seats in Glasgow last night, but it provided
elcome chance to hear some good music outside the SCO's normal scope.
With the focus firmly on the 40 choristers on an otherwise bare platform, the
Poulenc made a serene impression as it floated and soared towards its ecstatic
Agnus Dei, in which Margaret Stockwell was the admirable solo soprano. The air
of mock lightness with which Poulenc characterised his most serious
compositions was here perfectly judged by the conductor, Timothy
Byram-Wigfield, in a performance of silvery tenderness.
But the solemnity of the Schutz psalms that framed the programme was no less
telling, and the splendour of Ecce Sacerdos, last of a group of Bruckner
motets, resounded grandly in so reverberant a hall.
Unaccompanied choral music by Mendelssohn (sweetly euphonious) and Brahms (more
severe) provided other pleasures. But it was a pity the brass players deleted
their promised performance of Matthew Locke's Musick for His Majestie's
Sackbutts and Cornetts rather than Leonard Salzedo's Divertimento, which in the
context of this programme sounded disappointingly trivial.

THIS remarkable production comes from the Welsh National Opera, where it
originated in 1994, and English National Opera deserve applause for taking it
on. Visually we are back to the wows of the Coliseum's recent glorious past.
Musically, ditto. But this extraordinary effort fails vocally, and in a way
that can do the company no favours in its present circumstances. A potentially
strong cast falls far short through diction so appalling it made a mockery of
ENO's claim to be opera in English.
Director Christopher Alden, designer Paul Steinberg, and conductor David
Atherton deserved the rave applause they received on opening night, if only for
the excitement. They were booed, even! With primary colours, cool lighting, and
a refreshing simplicity of design, Puccini's tale of the Chinese princess
Turandot and the three riddles she poses to her potential lovers is presented
in clear, delightfully emotional images.
A banner declares ``3 enigmas = death'', the cast are in bright 30s fashions,
and the madness of the Chinese court is relayed in the deliciously
camp-dramatic gesturing of the chorus. The mug-shots of Turandot's 100-plus
previous victims are on display against the curved corrugated-iron backdrop to
remind us of the odds. The ENO orchestra, its horn section spilling over into
the balconies to add a wondrous punch, is on fine form.
Janice Watson stands out as the slave girl Liu, but the rest of the principals
are a disappointment. Edmund Barham as the hero Calaf is weak in voice, and
often indistinct. With Sophia Larson as Turandot they make a wooden pair, arms
akimbo, boring us rigid. And if she's singing in English, then I'm a Chinaman.

IT does not happen very often in Scotland, in my experience. The young managing
director of a three-year-old start-up, sitting across the boardroom table, is
talking big. Very big.
``Where are all those new Apples and Microsofts of the 21st century going to
come from?'' he presses. ``Well, we plan to be one of them. We are going to run
hell for leather for dominance in our global marketplace,'' adds David Sibbald,
just to underline that his ambitions for Atlantech Technologies are boundless.
Cumbernauld-based Atlan-tech is in the business of developing network
management software systems for the global telecommunications industry. Its
first major product, AccessVision, is already being supplied to the likes of BT
and Telecom Italia. It hasn't a single customer in Scotland. Even so, from a
standing start in April 1992, Atlantech already employs 35 highly skilled staff
and is heading for sales of #7.5m this financial year.
But Sibbald, a graduate in the late seventies of what is now Glasgow Caledonian
University and an expatriate for most of the following decade, is not content
to become a niche supplier to the telecoms leviathans. He argues that the
revolution in the personal computer industry of the eighties, which saw
Microsoft emerge, within 14 years, as a global corporation with net assets
greater than its Seattle planemaker neighbour Boeing, is about to sweep through
the telecommunications industry in the rest of the nineties and beyond.
``The big players in computers, like IBM and DEC, became fat, dumb and happy in
the eighties. Then along came new aggressive young companies who knocked them
off their perch. Exactly the same thing that happened in computers in the
eighties is happening in telecoms now.
``If ever there was a time and an industry in which to start a company, this is
definitely it. If you get the best people marching to the same drum, you've got
a hell of a chance of succeeding. And we've got some of the best people in the
world working in Atlantech right now.''
This is refreshing, intoxicating stuff even from an entrepreneurial Scot. But
is it just braggadocio? ``You may come back in a few years and find we've
failed,'' Sibbald concedes. ``But we are going to make our mark on this
landscape.''
That's the kind of determined ambition which seldom leaps out of the pages of
business plans or corporate strategies. ``A lot of big companies have
traditional ways of looking at markets,'' he says. ``They analyse market
shares, pricing points, how long before they'll get a return, factors like
that. But that's totally inappropriate for markets that don't even exist right
now. For entrepreneurial companies wrestling with what these markets might look
like, you can't do the analysis. In the end you have to go for the leap of
faith.''
Parts of Atlantech's leap of faith are already bearing fruit. Fibre-optic cable
and digital technology are ensuring that what can happen on a phone line is
much, much more than two people talking to each other. We are well used to
document exchange by fax and buying insurance and other financial services by
phone. And some of us are now exploring the internet.
There is talk of interactive television, video-on-demand, home shopping and
countless other wonders, accessible through the telecoms networks of the
future. Multimedia is the catch-all term. But is David Sibbald convinced that
wired-up existence is what people will want in the first decades of the next
millennium?
``No, I'm not,'' he answers. ``But all the developments that are going to sweep
telecommunications are not held hostage to the public's acceptance of
interactive TV. We know that telecoms in the future will be able to deliver to
larger and larger numbers of people a mass of multimedia data and allow them to
interact with it. We are looking at the common denominators in a lot of these
applications that the software architecture we are developing can address.''
After college Sibbald went to work in South Africa for three years, came back
to London for four more, then headed for San Jose, in the heart of Silicon
Valley, for another two. It's a typical career pattern, he believes, driven by
the dearth of companies in Scotland doing work of a sufficiently challenging
technical nature for the graduates we produce.
And yet, having returned home to start Atlantech with two colleagues, he finds
that one of the biggest constraints on growth is finding more people of the
calibre it needs to pursue its leap of faith. ``There is not a pool of
available talent in Scotland,'' he reports. In the short term Atlantech is
casting its recruitment net around the world. Longer term, he says, the
Scottish education system has got to get its act together.
He has even harsher words for the venture capital community and the UK banks.
``Initially we boot-strapped, using our savings to get off the ground, working
in my bedroom. I was used to meeting venture capitalists in California. But
here the picture is very different. There's an aversion to risk, an aversion to
start-ups and an incredible aversion to anything hi-tech.''
The trio thought of going back to the US and starting there. Instead, they put
their software development work on the back burner and began making some money
by providing American telecoms companies with a technical entre to the European
marketplace.
``That generated some cash, allowed us to employ some people and spin off some
guys to work on our core architecture product.'' By selling skills to Americans
interested in a telecoms foothold in Europe, Atlantech pushed sales to #1.5m.
That gave it the credibility to revisit the venture capitalists. In 1993,
Scottish Enterprise came up with #250,000 of seed capital. More recently, SE
and 3i provided additional backing of #2.2m. Atlantech has just moved into a
modern office block in Cumbernauld's new Broadwood Business Park.
It may, as David Sibbald concedes, all end in tears. But it's great to hear a
young Scot with belief in the technical skills of his team and just enough of a
track record to convince you he's on to something saying: ``The sky's the
limit.''

MELROSE are to press for an investigation into the eye injury suffered by
loose-head prop Mark Ross during their premiership match against Edinburgh
Academicals two weeks ago, writes Derek Douglas.
Ross, who was allegedly punched during the game, had to undergo emergency
surgery on the left eye after a build-up of internal pressure and there were
fears that the eye might have been permanently damaged. He goes to see a
specialist again early next week. The Raeburn place game, which Academicals
lost in the last minute after a series of penalties was also the setting for
coach David Sole's post-match comments when he described the performance of
referee Colin Henderson as having been ``tantamount to cheating''.
Melrose secretary Stuart Henderson said that the club president had contacted
Academicals but as the Edinburgh club appeared to want a formal approach, it
had been decided to write requesting that they investigate the circumstances of
Ross's injury.
q FORMER All Black John Gallagher has given up hope of playing for Harlequins.
Gallagher, who turned professional five years ago when he joined Leeds and last

has been told he must serve a 120-day qualification period before he could turn

ONE MAN put in the race of his life to win the Hennessy last year and comes to
the start this year after an identical preparation with an impressive run at
the same Ayr meeting.
I tipped him to win last year, but cannot recommend a bet at the outrageously
short odds on offer today.
No horse has won the Hennessy for a decade carrying more than 11 stones, and
favourites have a dire record in this event.
Couldnt Be Better could be the better value at these weights.
He ran well in the early part of his campaign last season and opened his
account for this one with an impressive win over Chatam.
Clifton Beat won over course and distance in October (Stompin Held) and can
score again in the Gerry Feilden Hurdle.
Kissair beat him soundly in the Triumph Hurdle, but Martin Pipe's star appeared
to need his first run last year and prefers a cut in the ground.
Conquering Leader lived up to her name last season, storming home 14 lengths
clear on this course, and her only defeat was a close third at the Festival.
She is weighted to win the Akzo Nobel Hurdle with a big pull on Jibber The
Kibber for a two-length defeat on her reappearance (Silver Wedge well held).
At Newcastle, Absalom's Lady can profit from Mysilv's defection to land the
Fighting Fifth's Hurdle.
David Elsworth's classy mare may be a veteran but last season's campaign was
her most successful, including two wins at Kempton over Large Action and Atours.
With a decent reappearance run behind her, she can outspeed Chief Minister.
Emerald Storm looks like going off at an attractive price in The Ladbroke Chase.
He showed much promise for Nicky Henderson last year and has continued to
progress for Peter Monteith, winning comfortably at Kelso and chasing home
Whaat Fettle last time.
He looks the best of a strong field, though Pims Gunner and Brave Buccaneer
have their chances.

<HEADLINE>Amec's #132m McAlpine bid</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION group Alfred McAlpine confirmed yesterday that it has received a
#132m offer from Amec which, in turn, is under threat from engineering giant
Kvaerner of Norway.
In a brief statement, McAlpine said that it would respond to the two for one
offer which values each McAlpine share at 192p when the outcome of the talks
between Amec and Kvaerner were known. On Thursday, Kvaerner raised its long
standing 2% stake in Amec to 12% through a dawn raid at 100p costing #20m.
Amec closed 3p easier at 99p, while McAlpine ended 18p stronger at 159p.
Kvaerner, Europe's largest shipbuilder and owner of the Govan yard in Glasgow
said it would not pay more than the dawn raid price.
The approach has puzzled some on the grounds that, if Kvaerner is interested
primarily in Amec's UK North Sea exposure it would be entering into a
highly-competitive market.
If a deal can be reached, there could be co-operation between the two using
Kvaerner's fire-power and ability to win large contracts to provide comlete
plant installations for rigs where the Amec Matthew Hall subsidiary's expertise
in topside installation would be invaluable as it would also be in power
stations. It has been a leading sub-contractor in the Sizewell B nuclear
station, while the Amec parent's long experience in civil engineering would be
a valuable marketing tool in winning international contracts.
Chief executive Erik Tonseth said that he was surprised that Amec had made its
approach to McAlpine, but he conceded that the picture is now more complicated
than expected. He added that nothing was ruled out.
The Amec move on McAlpine comes after the two companies had been in talks for
some time about co-operation. They have already won a #145m joint consortium
bid to improve the sub-standard A1 between Peterborough and Alconbury where it
branches off towards the M11 and a smaller #35m contract to widen the A417
between Swindon and Gloucester.
McAlpine warned in September that it was contemplating the possibility of
withdrawal from general contracting, with total UK orders down one third.
Interim pre-tax profits amounted to a mere #56,00 on turnover of #361m.
Chief executive Oliver Whitehead, who came into the group after leaving
Babcock, has been squeezed between the family interests and the leading
shareholders - the latter wanting him to find a bidder in a sector which has
far too much capacity.

VIVACIOUS is not the first adjective that springs to mind when searching for
the right word to describe today's stars of the snooker table. Without
disrespect, there is a seriousness about the champions of the green baize which
would make vivacious about as appropriate as skint.
Perhaps, one day, the lack of ebullience, of the bubbly nature that can be such
a marvellous promoter for any sport, will emerge if the women players can reach
the standard required to break into the higher echelons of the game.
If Julie Gillespie, Scotland's best woman player, were part of the TV circuit
she would fit the bill admirably. Only 5ft 1in, this 20-year-old student at
Strathclyde University has a personality twice that height and, bearing in mind
the stage of evolution which women's snooker has reached, a game to go with it.
Julie would be the first to admit that she is a fair way behind the best in the
women's game, rated 25, let alone the Stephen Hendrys and Ronnie O'Sullivans of
the business, but if there had been a real opportunity to make a living at the
game she might well have had a go at chasing after a place on the highest plane.
That is the problem that faces the women who find they have made fair progress
at the cue-ball game. If they are ever to progress to the top level as a group
they have to face the competition that breeds hardness, skill and concentration
of a type that requires full-time application. There is not enough money around
for the girls to forsake their day jobs.
Yet it could be the game's loss in the long run. Snooker is one of the few
sports where there is no physical advantage, no bonus in muscles, that can
affect the hand and eye skills of the snooker player. Julie Gillespie agrees
that theoretically women could be just as expert under the lights but
acknowledges that it could be a long way off, maybe unattainable.
``There is still a very big gap and even our best players have not been able to
qualify for the later stages of the TV tournaments,'' says this petite young
woman from Doune who is studying maths, statistics and accountancy, ``and I
don't know if it will ever be the case. There are only a couple of
professionals in the real sense among the women, because there is not enough
money around.''
That explains why there will be a good representation of the best women in the
sport today and tomorrow at Spencer's Snooker Club in Stirling, where the Regal
Masters first prize is #1000. Julie is desperately keen to do well at her own
club, the place where she is given immense encouragement and the best of
facilities to try to improve her snooker.
Most of the world ranking players will be there and although her listing at 25
would suggest she will not get very far, the fact that she has managed to take
part in only two of the ranking tournaments is an indication that she might be
a fair bit better than the bare statistics hint.
She would be delighted if she could get to the last 16 . . . ``anything after
that would be a bonus.'' Maybe she could make a few extra bob taking on macho
men who reckon this slim, curly-haired girl would be easy snooker fodder. They
would be making a mistake.
Taking away the professionals at Spencer's, which include the best player in
the world, Stephen Hendry, she reckons there are about five men who are either
better or on a par with her when she is on form. This is confirmed by the fact
that she is in the Spencer's league team, the only woman. ``That fact doesn't
even cross my mind any more. They don't treat me any different.''
Julie hopes to be a chartered accountant when her studies are over, but has not
entirely given up the prospect of taking up the game full-time. ``If women's
snooker should take off in a big way, like golf or tennis, for example, I would
definitely have a go, especially if I had my qualifications behind me.''
Neither of her two sisters has any interest in snooker, nor her mum, and so it
is dad who has to hold up his hand. That is appropriate, as he asked others to
do so often enough when he was a maths teacher, a profession from which he has
taken early retirement. From the beginning Julie's dad has been her chaperon,
coach, opponent and supporter, maybe as much in surprised fascination as
anything else.
Her interest in the game began when the family visited Aberdeen friends where
the wee boy of the house had a small table. Julie tried it, liked it, and
pestered dad and mum to get her a junior 6ft x 3ft table. That, as they all
say, was that.
She and dad were off and running, first playing each other in the house, then
it was down to the local snooker hall, and eventually to Spencer's.
She began to take part in competitions, junior league matches, and soon was
having a go at the world ranking and Scottish ranking tournaments. ``Spencer's
gave me free practice time which helped a lot and that made the difference.''
It was while at school she was able to find time to practise enough to climb
the rankings until she had reached No.13. By then she had to make a choice,
having got the grades she needed at school to go on to university.
``I decided it was not really possible to go full-time, although I was tempted.
If I had thought I could have made it my living I might have not gone to
university. But there just was not enough prize-money around. Since then I have
slipped in the rankings, because I can't find the time to take part in the
ranking competitions. Most of them are down south. Before, when I was at
school, dad used to take me down there.''
Even so, she can remember when there was more cash about than nowadays, and can
recall winning something like #1500 at the Sky World Masters after reaching the
quarter-finals of the mixed doubles.
Julie has the advantage, when she finds time, to practise with top class
players like Billy Snaddon. She can be found at Spencer's three times a week,
sometimes helping out behind the bar between spells, and in the last month as a
result of putting in hard practice feels her standards have recovered a little.
She can't see women catching up with the men in the next 10 years but would
like to be around if it happens. Meanwhile she continues to share her time
between studies and practising. Her boyfriend, a keen footballer, can bank on
only one night a week in her company, but ``is very understanding.''
The fact that she is a class act on the snooker table will come as a surprise
to many of her student pals, although her other friends are well aware of her
night job.
Julie, whose best effort yet in the Regal Masters was to reach the
quarter-finals, has been working hard to get set for this weekend, accompanied
as ever by dad. ``Mum finds it hard to watch. She gets too nervous.''
The Gillespie girl is in good form, winning the Scottish Ladies' Anniversary
tournament at Spencer's last Sunday, but points out that no snooker player can
ever be sure exactly how he or she will play.
Maybe she will surprise herself as well as a few higher rated challengers.

BOXING
NIGEL Benn will be an invited VIP ringside guest at The Point in Dublin tonight
- and that should be a pointer to a two-title world super-middleweight showdown
against Steve Collins taking place next spring.
This is certainly no time for the 31-year-old Collins - the ``Celtic Warrior''
- to be outfought by Middlesbrough's unsung Cornelius Carr in the second
defence of the WBO title he wrenched from Chris Eubank in March, and retained
in a return in September.
``I'm not going to insult Cornelius Carr by talking about an upcoming fight
with Nigel Benn. But yes, of course, I have my eye on one,'' said Collins.
``Benn is on record as saying that, now his clash with Roy Jones looks
increasingly unlikely to come about, a fight with me is the one he wants to go
out on. Fine, but he won't be going out on a winning note.''
Carr, 26, has campaigned without attracting any high-profile attention since
turning professional in 1987. He won the British super-middle title by
outscoring James Cook, but gave it up to campaign at middleweight. Now Carr has
gone back to the 12st division for this big chance.
Said Collins: ``Carr may not have fought the kind of guys I've been in with,
but he's still a guy getting his chance at the big time, and that alone is
going to lift him.
``Eubank made the mistake of taking me lightly in our first fight. He thought I
was a stop-off on his world tour. I have no intention of making the same
mistake against Carr.''
q COMMONWEALTH lightweight champion Billy Schwer defends his title against
David Oodhi Tetteh, of Ghana, at Dagenham tonight and should be good enough to
win shortly after the halfway mark.

q I have inherited #25,000, #15,000 of which I would like to invest in the
medium to long term for capital growth. The remaining #10,000 will be kept
accessible for current use.
It appears to be a minefield out there. I have seen financial advisers from
banks and building societies. Each adviser recommends his own firm's PEP
(#6000) and bond (#9000). Where can I find independent financial advice from
someone who does not benefit from selling his own company products?
I have also visited my lawyer. As I do not want to invest directly in the Stock
Exchange and put all my eggs in one basket, he recommended I invest the #15,000
in a small portfolio of investment trusts.
My current investments are a Tessa, SAYE and paying into my company's AVCs. I
am a taxpayer in full-time work. I may give up work within the next 18 months
to start a family and may not return, or may only do so part-time. A PEP
interests me, but if I give up work soon and become a non-taxpayer, is it worth
starting one, or would I be better with the investment trusts? Or do you have
another suggestion?
n For the most part you seem to have been shopping in the wrong places. Your
advice has not been independent since you have been talking to advisers tied to
their own products. They should have told you that they were not in a position
to recommend the products of other companies, even if they were better suited
to your needs.
There are independent financial advisers who are not tied to the products of
one company, but for the most part they are not High Street names. Fortunately,
you have already obtained some excellent advice from your solicitor.
Given the sum of money you have at your disposal and the fact that you are a
basic rate taxpayer, any benefits you obtained from a PEP might be largely
offset by the management charges. In any event a PEP is only as good as its
underlying investments. Many have disappointing track records.
By contrast, most investment trusts sport superior performances over the medium
to long term and provide an ideal way for the small investor to build up
capital. Dividends are generally small, so the tax paid is small. You would be
able to reclaim the dividend tax credits if you became a non-taxpayer.
Similarly, you would not need to pay tax on the interest earned on your #10,000
to be kept accessible for current use.
However, it is only fair to point out that investment trust shares are quoted
on the Stock Exchange. They differ from the shares of commercial and industrial
companies in that the capital is invested in a wide spread of other shares,
often overseas as well as in the UK. In that sense they are less risky than
other types of equity investment.
You make no mention of a mortgage, but if you have one you might want to use
some of your inheritance to reduce it, especially if at some stage there would
only be one income to service it. In any event, you are wise to allocate some
of your funds to long-term capital growth.
q I have recently subscribed to Commercial Union's Monthly Income Plus PEP on
advice from my financial adviser. It is my intention that any income be
reinvested for the foreseeable future. I have subsequently read that corporate
bond PEPs are designed principally for income seekers and are not the best use
of funds seeking growth. Should I be concerned about this or, in general terms,
does reinvesting income amount to the same thing as investing for growth?
n If you do not intend to take the income for some years then your adviser's
choice of fund is rather odd, unless you specifically wanted a lower risk
investment. Corporate bonds have a lower risk profile than shares, though they
are not risk-free and are certainly riskier than gilts.
So letting the fund roll-up within a PEP would be a legitimate strategy for the
risk-averse, though monthly income, the extra costs of which often mean a lower
yield, would certainly not be necessary. However, if you would not need the
capital for, say, five years you could afford to invest in funds targeting
capital growth. Outside of a PEP, tax factors mean the difference between
income roll-up and capital growth is more marked.
q I am about to sell some shares I received last year as a gift from my father
and I am confused about the calculation of indexation allowances for capital
gains purposes. I think it used to be the case that the allowance was
calculated from the date the shares were originally purchased by my father, but
this may have changed. Can you say what the current position is?
n Prior to March 14, 1989, where a gift of assets was made, the donor and donee
were able to elect that any gain arising at the date of gift was held over. The
donee acquired the asset at its market value less the gain that would otherwise
be chargeable and indexation in respect of any future disposal was calculated
on that reduced value from the date of the gift.
Hold-over relief in respect of general gifts was withdrawn on March 14, 1989,
and from that date applies only to the gift of business assets, shares in an
unquoted or family company, agricultural property and certain transfers to
trusts.
The gift of shares by your father is, therefore, chargeable for capital gains
tax purposes and his original cost plus indexation from date of purchase are
used in the calculation of any gain arising at date of gift. Your cost is the
market value of shares at that date plus indexation from the date of gift to
date of sale.
q Must a company employing a temporary employee deduct tax or can the latter
hold him or herself to be self-employed?
n An employer must apply PAYE to wages paid to all employees including those
who are casual or temporary. Usually it is easy to decide whether a person is
an employee or not, but in cases of doubt it is best to refer to the Inland
Revenue leaflet IR56 Employed or Self-Employed or to seek a written decision on
the position from either the Inland Revenue or DSS.
A person cannot hold him or herself to be self-employed if that is not
supported by the facts, and an employer who fails to account for PAYE when he
or she should, could have to pay the tax and national insurance due plus
interest and penalties with no recourse to the employee.
q I write hoping that you can give me some advice about Scottish National
shares which I hold as follows: income 1160, capital 464, zero dividend
Preference 464, stepped Preference 232, warrants 92. I do not understand all
the implications of the various units and wonder if I should be taking action
about all or some of them.
n Scottish National is a split-level investment trust in which the income and
capital growth elements are split between various classes of shares. When the
trust is wound up in September 1998 the shares are ranked according to their
entitlement to the assets.
Priority lies with the stepped Preference which will be entitled under a
formula fixed at the outset of the trust to about 171p. Once this requirement
has been met the remaining assets are applied to repaying the zero dividend
Preference at 325p a share. The income shares come next with 100p and finally
any remaining assets go to the capital shares.
With under three years to go it is likely the assets in the trust will be
sufficient to meet all the prior charges, leaving something for the capital
shares. However, the warrants are and will probably remain worthless.
Leaving aside the capital shares, your other holdings, presently worth some
#2700, will reach #3060 on maturity. The capital shares are now worth only #93.
The total assets of the trust have to grow by only 3.8% compound for the
capital shares to have the same value on maturity. Should the assets grow by 5%
the capital shares will rise by 30% compound so they are highly geared. Should
asset growth be 10% your holding would be worth nearly #800.
If the stock market sees only marginal growth over the next three years, it is
not worth retaining your investment in Scottish National. If, however, the
market grows by, say, 10% a year you would have a gain of a third on your
present total investment.
The way your investment is divided between the various classes means you have a
low-risk stake in the stock market. If it falls modestly over the next three
years you are unlikely to face a capital loss. If it grows strongly you will do
quite well.

RON Dixon walked through the front door of Dens Park yesterday for the first
time in a year and declared: ``The reason I stayed away was Jim Duffy.''
The Canadian millionaire chairman of Dundee finally answered the riddle of
whether or not he would turn up to attend their Coca-Cola Cup final with
Aberdeen at Hampden tomorrow by arriving in Scotland on Thursday.
He immediately made it clear he saw no big deal in the fact that he had
remained out of sight for so long. ``I have been accused by some people of not
being a football man. I would argue against that by pointing to the fact that
it was myself who appointed Jim Duffy as coach at this club.
``The truth is there has been no reason for me to be here, because I know that
Dundee Football Club has been in the best of hands with Jim at the helm.
``Sure, I had other business commitments and these contributed to my long
absence. But once I am sure any sector of my business interests is running
smoothly then I believe it is time for me to move on and concentrate on
something else.
``I predicted within a month of appointing Jim that we had a cracker of a coach
and I don't think anyone will ever argue with that.''
Dixon's return to Scotland came just one month short of the five-year
commitment he gave when he first bought the club, but he insisted: ``That was a
minimum commitment on my part. A couple of pieces of the puzzle have still to
fall into place and I want to see them taken care of.
``It has taken Jim Duffy one year to find out the culture of the club and
another year to turn things round. Now he is ready to take us further down the
road.''
Despite his lenghty absence from the Scottish football scene, Dixon made it
plain he believes what road Dundee should be taking in the near future. That
includes sticking to his vow to plough no more money into the club.
``The way ahead for Dundee is the way Jim has already begun to develop. That is
by giving young players the chance to come here and get a chance to play early
in their careers.
``People like Tommy Burns, Jimmy Nicholl and Jim Duffy give youngsters in a
hurry and with ambition the chance to make something of their careers far
earlier.
``Jim gets them playing out of their skin because he treats them exactly right.
He has not made a single mistake, in my view, since he came here. Look at young
Jim Hamilton for instance. Jim bought him for #15,000 and snatched him out of
Aberdeen's camp.''
But Dixon could not supply a guarantee that young stars like Hamilton will be
retained indefinitely at the club. ``Sometimes there is nothing we can do to
stop sales. Kids do well and feel they can move on to a higher level, like
playing for Manchester United. You can't hold on in these circumstances. And
for the board of any football club the first order has to be survival.''

A SPORTS injury more than two years ago is directly responsible for the journey
to Atlanta which Sarah Baillie will make next summer to compete in the Olympics.
Sarah was a student at Jordanhill, studying for a BA sports degree. Always
exercise-oriented, she had participated in a wide range of activities,
representing Lanarkshire at ski-ing, and winning trophies and medals in
show-jumping. But it was neither of these relatively high-risk activities which
transformed her life - it was a freak football injury.
``I was playing as part of my course, went into a tackle, and just landed
badly,'' says Sarah. ``I suffered serious nerve damage to one leg and have a
lot of problems with my back. I can walk only a very short distance with the
aid of crutches. For all practical purposes, I am confined to a wheelchair.
``They wanted to throw me off the course - I was in my first year - because I
could not do the practicals. I convinced them you don't need to be able to do a
sport to coach it.''
She completed her BA, took up wheelchair basketball, and now, after two years
in the sport, has also graduated to a place in Atlanta. Last weekend, at the
European championships in Holland, Sarah and fellow Scot Laura Bleakley helped
the British women's wheelchair team to success over Israel, booking the UK's
place in the Paralympics next year.
In one of sport's more bizarre results, guaranteed to baffle quiz freaks until
Judgment Day's final whistle, the British girls had to lose to qualify.
Sarah and Laura, both of whom play for Inverclyde Colts, were the only Scots in
the UK team at the European championships. With the first three guaranteed an
Olympic place, Britain were involved in a double-header against Israel for the
bronze medal.
The Britons won the first match by seven points, but at full-time in the second
game, the scores were tied at 31-all. Nearing the end of the five-minute period
of extra time, the scores were still level.
Knowing that in further overtime the girls could lose by more than seven
points, the coach instructed them to concede one basket. At the last moment,
the Israelis were allowed to score - game lost, Olympic place won.
``Perhaps that doesn't sound terribly sporting,'' concedes a shame-faced Joe
Fletcher, chairman of the British Wheelchair Basketball Association. He points
out, however, that during the early part of the final match an electronic fault
led to a failure to record a British score. ``We think justice was done.''
Now the girls will fly into the British Olympic holding camp in Tallahassee
next summer the day after the last of the able-bodied Olympians move out and
head home. Costs will be borne by the British Paralympic Association, but that
falls way short of the #2000 cost of titanium chairs, spare wheel at #140, or
even tyres, four of which (#15 a time) can go in one match.
Perhaps even more problematic than funds is arranging practice time. ``It's
difficult to get courts for wheelchairs, with five-a-side football
everywhere,'' says Laura, from Barrhead.
Now 22, but having had no use of her legs since she was four, she has a
qualification from Caledonian University and is employed full-time as a
canoeing coach at Castle Semple.
In that, Laura is more fortunate than 27-year old Sarah. Despite her degree,
and having taken separate qualifications to coach basketball, volleyball,
badminton, fencing, table tennis, short tennis, swimming, gymnastics,
trampolining and boccia, Sarah cannot find employment, other than temporary
work with the Glasgow Council for Voluntary Services, at a school for children
with physical disability, and with Glasgow City Council.
Sarah, from Lesmahagow, says: ``I would like a post as a sports development
officer, for which I am well qualified. But I have to say that my disability
seems to count against me.''

ROUGH Quest can see off the challenge of three previous winners and engrave a
new name on the roll of honour for the Grade 3 Hennessy Gold Cup today at
Newbury.
One Man, Chatam, and Cogent all lock horns in an attempt to become the first
horse since Arkle to lift the brandy twice.
None can be dismissed, with One Man's claims to follow up his victory of last
year particularly strong.
But Rough Quest, whose career really got going at the end of last season,
represents the value to give Terry Casey the biggest success of his training
life so far.
Jenny Pitman's Jibber The Kibber, shock winner of the Tote Silver Trophy at

BT is Britain's second largest company and one of the most competitive
telecommunications companies in the world. The man who has presided over this
transformation from a moribund state monopoly into a world class efficient
company is Sir Iain Vallance.
Sir Iain has been chairman of the group for nine years and chief executive for
ten years. Last year he was knighted for services to the telecommunications
industry.
Sir Iain was born in 1943 and was educated at both Glasgow and Edinburgh
Academies. His parents still live in Edinburgh and he often returns to Scotland
where he can indulge his passion for hill walking.
He is a graduate of Brasenose College Oxford and the London Business School. He
began his working life in the Post Office in 1966, when he worked in the
chairman's office. In 1967, he married Elizabeth McGonnigill who has a
successful professional career of her own in academe. They have one son and one
daughter.
In addition to his role at BT, last year Sir Iain was appointed vice-chairman
of the Royal Bank of Scotland. He has been touted as a possible successor to
Lord Younger, Royal Bank's chairman, who is due to retire in the next few
years. Sir Iain also serves on a number of other bodies including the CBI,
British-American Chamber of Commerce, the Police Foundation and the Princess
Royal Trust for Carers.
He is not the most diplomatic of people. He prompted outrage earlier this year
when in justifying his #663,000 salary he said it might be quite ``relaxing''
to be a junior hospital doctor. What is not in question is that Sir Iain puts
in the hours. He is said to be usually at his desk by 7.30am and regularly
works a 12 hour day in the week and one day at the weekend. Added to which the
global nature of the business is such that he is often abroad.
Sir Iain has been vocal in his views on the challenges and opportunities facing
BT in the telecommunications revolution. BT attracted publicity during the
Party conference season when it announced a ``superhighways'' agreement with
the Labour Party.
He has a personal goal to see BT become the largest telecommunications company
in the world. Having brought the company this far, he may well succeed in his
ambition.
The view in the City is that it is more than time for clarity at the top of the
company regarding who does what, and therefore his decision to give up the
chief executive role will be warmly welcomed.

HE MAY not be having much success in his attempts to sign another striker, but
Celtic manager Tommy Burns seems pretty happy at the moment, especially with
the front players who would be complemented by the new man, whoever he turns
out to be.
The news that Bolton need John McGinlay too badly to allow him to leave in the
near future has ended that possibility, but Burns insisted yesterday that the
man he did buy, Pierre van Hooydonk, is not at the top of the premier-division
scoring list on a temporary basis.
``I have no doubt Pierre will be in that place at the end of the season, too,''
said Burns. ``He is a prolific scorer.''
The manager went on to extol the other virtues of the Dutchman, who cost #1.2m
last January, among them his willingness to learn. If Pierre had been used to
the typical Dutch style of forward play, where the idea is to leave the
defending to the defenders, he has had to discard it, especially after Burns
pointed out the need in Scotland to defend from the front. ``To be fair, he has
accepted that and now he is as liable to be clearing out of his own penalty
area as he is scoring in the other one.''
As he named an unchanged squad, which came as a pleasant surprise after a few
key players had looked a bit doubtful earlier in the week, to take on Hearts at
Parkhead, Burns admitted that he is feeling pleased with the entire pool at
this point in the season.
``Last year our biggest problem was inconsistency, when we would go three or
four games in a row in mediocre form. This season we have kept a continuity of
performance and I believe the reason for that has been the way the quality
players have shown how they are willing to work both in games and at training.
That kind of thing rubs off on the others.''
Burns is especially satisfied at the midfield play. ``For a long time Paul
McStay, John Collins, and Peter Grant were supposed to be the best midfield
line-up here. Now they're playing like our best. They are showing a real desire
to work for each other and that has made a big difference.''
The Celtic manager readily acknowledges the improvement in Hearts since they
brought in their foreign division. ``It is amazing what a few new faces can do,
but our thoughts must be on how we go about things.''
Hearts have a doubt about John Robertson, whose absence would be a real blow.
The striker has a hamstring injury which is getting constant treatment, but the
three new men, Hans Eskilsson, Pasquale Bruno, and Gilles Rousset, will play.
Their win over Hibs last Sunday confirmed the Tynecastle revival under Jim
Jefferies, who is hopeful of another win and another hop up the table.
Paul Smith, bought from Dunfermline, is fit again and Jefferies will decide
whether he replaces Gary Mackay, who returned to the side in the derby and did
well. Said Mackay: ``That was my first game for six weeks and I hope I can keep
my place now.''
Two player-managers may be seen out this afternoon, Murdo MacLeod for Partick
Thistle and Alex McLeish for Motherwell, both because a catalogue of injury
problems is making life difficult. MacLeod, who played against Aberdeen
recently -``I thought I was the best player on the park,'' was his crack - will
decide this morning if he needs to put on the boots again.
``It all depends on who is fit when we check them out. At the moment, Wayne
Foster, Alan Dinnie, Steve Pittman, Steve Welsh, and Ian Cameron are doubtful
after taking injuries at Easter Road, and Tom Smith is suspended. I think we
will be lucky to get two of the doubtful ones playing.''
MacLeod, none the less, is optimistic that his side can recover from that
depressing 3-0 defeat by Hibs and beat Raith Rovers at Firhill, helping
themselves to what he calls a bit of ``breathing space.''
McLeish also will make up his mind this morning whether to have his second game
in succession. Miodrag Krivokapic is available again and youngster Greg Denham
may be left in the team alongside the experienced man against Falkirk. John
Philliben, Eddie May, and Jamie Dollan all are doubtful and may join long-term
absentees Shaun McSkimming and Tommy Coyne in the stand.
Falkirk, still without Derek Ferguson, will check on Jamie McGowan this morning.
q FERENCVAROS have asked their fans not to travel to Amsterdam for their
Champions' League match against Ajax in response to a row over alleged racist
chants. Ajax said last week they would not sell tickets to supporters of the
Hungarian champions for the December 6 match, claiming that Ajax's black
players were jeered when the sides met in Budapest in September.
q BLACKBURN have disciplined punch-up stars Graeme Le Saux and David Batty,
probably with heavy fines, for their astonishing on-field fisticuffs in the 3-0
Champions' League defeat in Moscow.
But while full back Le Saux has already accepted it and made an apology, Batty
still feels aggrieved and intends to speak to his advisers over the weekend.
However, he is available for Rovers' match against Arsenal at Highbury tomorrow.

JOE Tauiwi, skipper of the Kiwi Nomads, lifted the Emirates Airline
International Trophy after two hard days of competition in the Dubai Exiles
International Sevens. Tauiwi, a member of the winning All Blacks team in the
1994 and 1995 Hong Kong Sevens, was one of six Bay of Plenty players in the
winning team, who defeated Bahrain-based invitation side Warblers 47-19.
The fitness and training schedules achieved by All Blacks sevens coach Gordon
Tietjens and his men meant the Warblers could not live with them, despite
leading 19-7 at the break, as the winners ran in five second-half tries.
Earlier, Bath stars Adedayo Adebayo and Steve Ojomoh were in top form as
Warblers beat Hawke's Bay 24-19 in the semis.
Anglo-Scottish Invitation side Thistles took the Plate with a 21-12 win over
UBC Old Boys from Canada as Richard Moon skippered his side cleverly from scrum
half. Mark Appleson notched two of the three Thistles tries and converted both
as well as improving a try from Martin Gregory. The Canadian side had earlier
beaten Leicester 15-12 in sudden-death extra-time in the semi-finals. Results:
Plate: Quarter-finals - Leicester 31, Crawshay's Welsh 17; Romania 12, UBC Old
Boys (Canada) 28; Roma 0, Thistles (Scotland) 38; Irish Wolfhounds 21, Atlantis
(USA) 24. Semi-finals - Leicester 12, UBC Old Boys 15 (aet); Thistles 29,
Atlantis 17. Final - UBC Old Boys 12, Thistles 21.
Gulf Championship: Quarter-finals - Hawke's Bay 33, Froggies 12; Warblers 19,
Queensland 15; Kiwi Nomads 43, Suntory (Japan) 19; Natal 15, Korea 17.
Semi-finals - Hawke's Bay 19, Warblers 24; Kiwi Nomads 48, Korea 0. Final -
Dubai Exiles 36, Bahrain 14.

TO Stradey Park, Llanelli, on Tuesday night for Ieuan Evans' testimonial match.
It was a British Isles XV against an International Select and we won 68-57,
Ieuan grossed - it is said - #100,000 and the 12,000 spectators all went home
happy. After events at Murrayfield on Saturday, three days certainly is a long
time in rugby.
The fact that Llanelli were permitted to stage a testimonial to mark Ieuan's
service to rugby shows just how far the game has come in last few months.
It was a star-studded occasion with players from all over the world on parade.
Sean Fitzpatrick, Jason Little, Thierry Lacroix, Olivier Roumat, John Gallagher
from rugby league, and Rudy Straueli were all there. There were five Scots -
the Hastings brothers, Rob Wainwright, Craig Chalmers, and me.
But the biggest draw was Jonah Lomu. The guy is a superstar and was mobbed
everywhere he went and that included a couple of pitch invasions by young
autograph hunters. Before the kick-off Ieuan and I held a strategy meeting, the
main item on the agenda being who was going to mark the monster. Ieuan said he
wanted to do it - and it was his game after all - so bang went my tackling
practice plans.
The game itself was intended very much as a crowd-pleaser but you can't put all
of those international players on the park without there being a bit of an edge
and neither side wanted to lose. Lomu had a couple of tries which took the
International Select to a 38-33 lead at half-time.
In the second half Ieuan kicked the conversion which took us from 57-54 behind
to a 61-57 lead (whether it actually went over or not is a private matter
between Ieuan and the touch judges) and I got a second try near the end to
bring down the curtain on a 19-try bonanza and a superb evening's
entertainment. It might only have been a bit of fun, but I needed a game like
that after Saturday's shocking performance against Western Samoa.
Today it is back to serious premiership business and our game against Melrose
at Bridgehaugh must be the crunch game of the season. If Melrose win then they
are almost certain to win the championship and if we win then the championship
race is going to go right down to the wire.
When you consider that just six weeks ago we were battling to avoid relegation
then you get some indication of just how desperate this league has been. It's
certainly not been for the faint-hearted.
Craig Joiner is recovered from his foot injury and back on the right wing for
Melrose today which means that we will be in direct opposition. It's good to
see ``Jackie'' back and I wish him well, but he knows that after last weekend
I've got a point or two to prove.
I'm not the only one. Craig Chalmers will also want to put on a bit of a show
today after the Samoan Test. He reckons that he doesn't deserve all the
personal criticism that came his way and the duel between the two fly-halves
will be especially interesting, because our Mark McKenzie is still on a high
after having such a good game for North and Midlands against the Samoans.
We've beaten Melrose thrice in a row and when we went down to the Greenyards at
the beginning of October we beat them by the odd point in 53. Neutral observers
reckoned that it was one of the best games of the season and, hopefully, it
will be more of the same - with the same outcome - today.

AS the poet Gerard Manly Hopkins wrote: ``The mind, the mind has mountains,
cliffs of fall, sheer, no man fathomed.'' The line kept coming to me as I
listened to Michael Ignatieff's Secret Theatres of the Mind (Radio 3).
How ultimately ignorant we are about the causes of manic depression or
dyslexia, Alzheimer's or autism, and although the tentatively preferred
theories with their careful trail of qualifications, made one think on
questions of genetics, environment and heredity, the painful power of this
series lay with the experiential reality of the sufferers.
In the case of dyslexia ``sufferer'' was clearly as ignorant labelling. It
became clear how much suffering and insult was caused to dyslexics by the
assumption that the ability to be literate is simplistically linked to
intelligence.
English lessons were hell. Constantly being spoken to as if she were stupid,
one woman tried to make us understand by saying that the awful driving-test day
feeling, was her feeling every single day. The dyslexic's visual and spacial
awareness takes precedent over the story and word dominance of the world. But
the point was made that our word-based civilisation is not eternal -
``technology creates a freedom not available when you pick up a pen''.
It is difficult for me to imagine what is meant when someone says that he does
not think in words. I can understand when it explained that ``segments'' as a
word holds difficulties but the imagined shape of an orange is the
word-equivalent in the dyslexic imagination, but I find it hard to move beyond
that. What about remembered conversations? An experience that needs to be
related? It's a good programme that makes you not just think, but makes you
think about thinking.
The metaphor Ingatieff used was that of a forest; where the non-dyslexic sees a
path through, the dyslexic sees nothing but inchoate branchings and darkness.
The pun becomes nonsense and the joke, while others exclusively guffaw, becomes
far from ``brillig'' (as in ``slithey tove'').
Everybody knows the emotional zig zag of high to low, but the mood swings of
the manic depressive's shift from exaltation to the bleakest of terror is often
unbearable.
One woman's depression lasted 18 months - then one morning she woke up and the
demons had gone. For no reason accessible to her clever, questioning mind, her
anguish had - temporarily - absented itself.
Without romanticising things, Ignatieff points to the number of artists stuck
with this particular torment; Beethoven, Van Gogh, Schumann, Plath, Byron.
Going out too far, burning the lamp too brightly is dangerous, and can end in
the bitterest of tears.
But one woman spoke of the special privilege of her state. She said that it led
to a generosity, an understanding and acceptance of the pain of others, and
indeed she exemplified the questioning stance she associated with her
condition. It was humbling to hear her talk of herself with such unassuming
clarity, as if she were her own child, fascinated, helpless and dignified.
Ignatieff himself was the child and grandchild of women with Alzheimer's
disease. It was almost unbearably moving to hear him describe his feelings as
he watched two women he loved slowly disappear from sight, for all his attempts
of connection, for all his articulate love.
He interviewed a woman called Kate, in her fifties, her voice young and vibrant
as her words chilled the soul. She was acutely aware that her memory was being
eaten away. She said she could remember when she began to forget, her mind like
a sieve with all the information that made herself herself, dribbling away.
The resilience and plain goodness of people assisting scientists in their
research for the disease that will not be cured in their lifetime - helping out
as they consciously experienced their own disintegration - astounded me. The
cruelty of nature is truly a thing beyond man to fathom.

MOST people I have spoken to about the postal strike are deliriously happy. No
longer, they say, do they have to suffer the shiver of fearful anticipation
slithering up their spine when they hear the plop of their morning mail through
the letterbox.
They can live quite happily, thank you, without the final reminders, whose
siren message, invariably in bright red, stares out from the corner of the
envelope window just     sufficiently to cause breakfast apoplexy.
None seems to regret the absence of those missives from the bank which, with
impeccable logic, inform you they are adding #15 to the overdraft you should
not have had in the first place.
Nor do they despair at not receiving notification from Readers Digest, or some
similar outfit, informing us, for the third time that month, that we are
virtually guaranteed a gold Rolls Royce/expenses paid trip to the
Bahamas/#100,000.
It is a fantasy, of course. A day of reckoning beckons. And they will be left a
lot less chirpier when the cheques don't turn up, the invitations are missed
and letters from loved ones arrive too late.
It would be so simple to blame it all on the wildcat strikers who instigated
the dispute at the Portobello office in Edinburgh.
After all, trade unionists are Luddite. It is not just a British trait. Even in
America when the mail was being transferred to rail from the Pony Express there
was friction from stagecoach operators and those who had the concession on
horse shoes. It was simply resolved, however. No need for interdicts or
expensive lawyers just a couple of gentlemen with inexpressive eyes and
eloquent trigger fingers to act as adjudicators.
Or we could blame the union of communication workers, a misnomer in itself. It
seems the last thing this body of brothers can do is communicate, either with
their own members, whom they claim to have discouraged from going on strike -
and have palpably been ignored - or with the management.
However, this would be a cop-out. It is like blaming workers' pay rises for
causing inflation. They cannot be held responsible; only governments can by
putting the printing presses on overtime.
The fault lies squarely with the monopoly which the Royal Mail has in shifting
our letters. It is one of the last ghettos of socialism. We have privatised
gas, telecommunications, electricity and changed the status of water in
Scotland - all the public utilities which we were once told were inviolable.
Only the Post Office remains, a memorial to absolute power and its corruption
absolutely.
A handful of Tory backbenchers     - those supposed One-Nation Conservatives,
easily identifiable with the yellow streak down their backs, colluded with
not-so-New Labour to force the Prime Minister into abandoning privatisation.
The original plan was to sell 51% of Royal Mail (which used to collect and
deliver letters) and Parcelforce, the Post Office's loss-making parcels service.
Post Office Counters, the retail arm which runs a network of 800 town-centre
post offices and 19,000 privately owned sub-post offices, were to stay under
the aegis of the state.
Of course, this all developed into a bogus battle about little grey-haired
grannies, eeking out an existence in sub-post offices in Highland villages,
being threatened with eviction by the rampant forces of capitalism. There were
gut-wrenching stories about whole communities which would disappear if these
outposts were axed; which says much about the viability of these communities if
this is all that keeps them together.
This was a much needed privatisation but it fell because the Government had
such a small majority in the Commons. So, the forces of darkness prevailed with
their claim that, because the Post Office had fat profits and falling costs,
there was no need for change.
It is true the Post Office is more efficient and profitable than it has ever
been but it is not, and should not be, an arm of the social services. This is
the way to create fewer jobs overall, not more. The service carries too much
fat - which at the end of the day means we all pay more than we have to - and
needs private-        sector disciplines.
National post offices face competition whether they like it or not, from one
another, from courier firms and from electronic communications. Just think of
the use of faxes, E-mail and interactive developments in fibre optics.    The
time is not far away when sending a letter in the traditional way    will be as
unusual as writing with a quill pen.
What the post office desperately needs is for the chains to come off and for
them to be allowed to make their own investment decisions, raise their own
capital - under existing rules, nationalised industry debts count as additions
to the public sector borrowing requirement - and create offshoots of their
business.
It works, even in former nanny-states like Sweden whose postal service lost its
monopoly two years ago yet remains profitable and efficient. The Germans, next
year, intend to revive theirs.
What would be helpful is for the European Commission to take steps to genuinely
create a single market in postal services. Its directive last July steers away
from competition in the industry. It was supposed to liberalise the laws so it
came up with the scheme that countries would be able to ``reserve'' letters
lighter than 350g (12oz) for delivery by the national post office. As the
normal letter weighs about 15g not much change there. As for incoming mail that
will remain a preserve of the monopolists until the next millenium. Only
express-mail - costing five times as much - is open to competition.
Its argument that there has to be a monopoly to ensure delivery to rural areas
is specious. The cost of a universal service is offset by economies of scale
and any company which offers to deliver anywhere, everyday would have an
irresistable selling point. Who do you think delivers to the far north of
Sweden? Santa Claus?
We should not waste energy targeting the rednecks who have initiated the strike
nor the eunuch of a union which cannot do anything about it. Competition will
mean better paid jobs for postal workers and a cheaper, more efficient service
for the rest of us. It's a pity you can't write to your MP about it.

A NEWLY commissioned string quartet by Martin Dalby which the Yggdrasil Quartet
were to have premiered on Thursday will now have to wait until February. Second
violinist Per Oman was struck down by a virus which confined him to bed,
however the remaining three players seemed positively to relish the opportunity
to rummage in their repertoire and they came up with a performance every bit as
polished as anything else to date.
Haydn's Divertimento No.8 in B major and Beethoven's String Trio in C minor
were the ultimate in intimate rapport between chamber players. Clearly
everything had to have been thoroughly planned yet the playing sounded so
spontaneous, with every change in pace or tone shining through a pellucid
string texture.
Lead violinist Fredrik Paulsson emerged from the Sonata No.3 in D minor for
violin and piano by Brahms, his face bathed in perspiration. Pianist Robert
Howie, brought in for the occasion, emerged cool and collected. This mirrored a
performance in which the passion flowed from sensuous glossy violin playing
which the piano never attempted to edge into second place.
The real fun though came from a little-known surprise item. Johan Halvorsen was
a Norwegian violinist and composer born in 1864 who apparently spent part of
his career in Aberdeen. His variations for violin and cello on a Passacaglia by
Handel demand startling virtuosity. Fredrik Paulsson and cellist Per Nystrom
went at it with relish. They even managed a suggestion of self parody just to
hint that they do not take themselves too seriously.

ABERDEEN and Dundee will contest the fiftieth League Cup final at Hampden
tomorrow afternoon and, fittingly, it will be a sell-out occasion for the
country's youngest major tournament. Whatever happens, it would seem from the
pre-match promises emanating from both camps that this will be a golden
anniversary to remember.
At Aberdeen, the captain, Stewart McKimmie, has already declared: ``This can be
a high scoring game, a match which will see a lot of attacking play.'' And the
Dundee manager, Jim Duffy, stressed: ``We have attack-minded players in
midfield and so do they. So, while as a manager, I would worry about losing
goals, I have to admit that the two teams are filled with players who want to
go forward.''
The news from Pittodrie yesterday that Eoin Jess will play is just another
factor which will improve Aberdeen's status as favourites to take the trophy.
They will be without Dutch goalkeeper Theo Snelders, but manager Roy Aitken
already has given Michael Watt, who will now move to centre stage at Hampden,
his vote of confidence.
Aitken also has added MS victim Brian Irvine to the group of players who will
travel south though it looks unlikely that the man who is fighting illness so
powerfully will take part in this important final.
Duffy has had no injury problems to concern him and the team he plays will
reflect the positive attitude he wants to take into every game.
``We are at our worst,'' he claims, ``when we are up against a team who are
trying to shut us down.
``We are looked on as a team who might be winning promotion and so the lesser
teams simply want to stop us playing and the lads get frustrated. But Aberdeen
won't do that.
``Like ourselves, they have midfield players who just want to get into forward
positions.
``We go in as underdogs and that suits me fine. It is not a problem for us and
we won't feel any pressure at all. At least, not until Sunday afternoon.''
That possible pressure point is confirmed by one of the main threats to the
premier division side, winger Neil McCann.
The Scotland Under-21 player maintains: ``Right now, I feel totally relaxed and
that is what the manager has been preaching. ``I don't think it's going to hit
me until just before the game. There is no danger of any of us freezing. We are
ready for the game and none of us have been able to believe the level of
support we are going to be getting. It's incredible that the club has sold
17,000 tickets.
``We all think that we can do it. We have proved what we are capable of doing
against premier division teams by beating Kilmarnock and Hearts.
They have the example of Raith Rovers last season to sustain them and the sure
knowledge that no matter what happens in the game, the cash-strapped club will
have made enough money to secure the future of the players.
As for Aberdeen, the cash will not mean so much. What will count most is the
glory, especially after their dismal time last season.
Now Aitken has managed to bring back the form of such as Jess and Scott Booth,
and encourage the burgeoning skills of Stephen Glass. And while the team still
lack consistency in the premier division, they have rediscovered the appetite
for the big occasion.
No-one need look further than the semi-final against Rangers for confirmation
of that.
Less than a year ago that type of result would have been beyond them, and now
Europe beckons. Just one match lies between them and that place among the
Continental giants their fans believe is their destiny.
It will not arrive easily. The gritty resolve of Duffy and his players will
make sure of that.
The bookmakers have decided that Aberdeen will take the Coca Cola Cup back
north, and they will probably be right. But their odds reflect their memories
of Raith Rovers defeating Celtic last season and, perhaps also, a growing
knowledge that Dundee have the opportunity to prove yet again that the gap
between the two leagues is narrowing.
ABERDEEN - Second round: v St Mirren (Pittodrie) 3-1. Scorers: Dodds, Booth
(two).
Third round: v Falkirk (Brockville) 3-1. Scorers: Clark (og), Booth, Woodthorpe.
Fourth round: v Motherwell (Fir Park) 2-1 aet. Scorers: Dodds, Inglis.
Semi-final v Rangers (Hampden) 2-1. Scorer: Dodds (two).
DUNDEE - Second round: v East Stirling (Firs Park) 6-0. Scorers: Wieghorst,
Hamilton, McCann (4).
Third round: v Kilmarnock (Dens Park) 3-1. Scorers: Shaw, Wieghorst, Hamilton.
Fourth round: v Hearts (Dens Park) 4-4 aet, won 5-4 on pens. Scorers: Shaw
(two), Tosh, Wieghorst.
Semi-final: v Airdrie (McDiarmid Park) 2-1. Scorers: Tosh, McCann.

THE Government, it emerged yesterday, is beginning to listen to sports' voices
demanding a review of National Lottery regulations.
The Herald, in concert with most sports agencies, has campaigned for relaxation
of rules confining grants solely to capital items. Only yesterday, former
Sports Minister Sir Hector Monro, in our personal column, Arena, admitted that
the awards system needs greater flexibility.
The argument goes that funding the building of swimming pools and sports
centres without helping to finance running costs, or assisting the elite who
perform in them, is a flawed policy.
Heritage secretary Virginia Bottomley has ordered a lottery review next month,
and the Central Council of Physical Recreation conference in Warwickshire heard
yesterday that this could pave the way for change.
David Carpenter, head of the Sports Council's National Lottery Unit, told
leading sports administrators that finance may become available by the middle
of next year, for coaching, sports medicine, and sports science. Cities hosting
major championships are also likely to qualify for help.
This drew an immediate response from Glasgow, which earlier this week was
designated Scotland's first National City of Sport. ``Obviously this could help
both with the provision of facilities, and our bid to bring more interntional
events to the city,'' said Brian Porteous, depute director of Parks and
Recreation.
Relaxation of the 50% guideline for lottery funds vis-a-vis local authority
finance will, however, help every part of the UK.
Allan Alstead, chief executive of the Scottish Sports Council, welcomed the
prospect, but voiced a note of caution: ``We would remind the Treasury that any
money is additional, not a replacement for existing funds.''
Despite Carpenter's fear that elite funding may remain restricted, his
political masters have hinted otherwise. Sports Minister Iain Sproat recently
referred in the House of Commons to Prime Minister John Major's #100m
aspirations for a British Academy of Sport: ``It will have the world's highest
standards of coaches, training facilities, sports science, and sports medicine
. . . We need to make sure that in an increasingly competitive world, our
athletes are properly supported financially, and we are determined to do that.''
Mr Sproat spoke of 500 full-time residential competitors on scholarships.
Where, you might ask, would funding come from? Sproat's reply to the House,
reported in Hansard, is the clearest indication yet of new lottery rules to
embrace revenue funding: ``There will almost certainly be endowment funding and
revenue funding for the academy.''

CONTINUING losses at Scot FM have failed to dent soaring profits at Grampian
Television, where advertising revenue has risen sharply.
The Aberdeen-based television station boosted its pre-tax profits by 62% to
#2.9m during the six months to August 31.
The company pushed its turnover ahead by 25% to #12.6m.
But City analysts briefed by Grampian officials said there had been a sharp
downturn in advertising in the second half, which was likely to dampen growth
in the second half.
Reflecting this discreet warning, Grampian share price remaineded unchanged at
204p yesterday, despite an effective 39% increase in the dividend.
Grampian chairman Calum MacLeod attributed the dramatic rise in first-half
profits to a 10.4% increase in advertising revenue and good income from the
sale of successful programmes such as ``Highlanders'' and ``Selina Scott meets
Donald Trump''.
But he gave little away about the continuing losses at Scot FM, the Leith-based
radio station covering central Scotland which began broadcasting in September
1994.
Mr MacLeod said Scot FM continued to run up trading losses, but he said that
revenue was improving, boosted by radio station's acquisition of exclusive
rights to live coverage of football matches in Scotland.
``I expect to see trading results continue to improve as the station enters its
second year of broadcasting,'' Mr MacLeod stated, without saying when it would
break even.
Scot FM has been bedevilled by cost overuns and staff problems from the start.
Former managing director Tom Hunter, who sacked many of the station's early
broadcasters, was himself shown the door earlier this month.
Grampian's former director of television, Bob Christie, was then rushed down
from Aberdeen to take charge of the situation.
Anthony de la Renaga, a media analyst with Panmure Gordon in London, reckoned
it would lose about #250,000 in this financial year after #400,000 last year.
Grampian Television's 10.4% increase in advertising revenue during the first
half outshone a 7.7% improvement for the ITV network.
This was down to a dynamic performance by TSMS, the advertising sales house
which it switched to in late last year.
Despite slower advertising growth in the second half of the year, full-year
profits still look set to increase for the eighth year in a row.
City analysts are pencilling a pre-tax figure of #5.3m to #5.6m, up from #4.4m
in 1994/95.

<HEADLINE>The arrival of Bonfield is unlikely lead to any alteration of company strategy BT to split roles of chairman and chief executive</HEADLINE>

BT is to split the roles of chairman and chief executive with Sir Iain Vallance
continuing as chairman. This in keeping with the Cadbury recommendations of
best practice in corporate governance.
Peter Bonfield, currently chairman and chief executive of the computer group
ICL, is to be the new chief executive from January 2.
Michael Hepher, currently managing director of BT, is to leave the group after
four years and is expected to return to the financial services industry. Before
joining BT, he was chief executive of Abbey Life. He has ruled out taking the
chief executive slot at rival Cable &amp; Wireless, a position which became
available earlier this week following a boardroom coup.
Mr Hepher will continue to be paid by BT until the end of his annual contract
on August 7, 1997. Mr Hepher's basic salary is #430,000. Sir Iain said that, as
there has been a change in circumstance, the board felt it was right to
continue the payments.
The appointment of Mr Bonfield is viewed in the group as particularly apt given
the convergence of the telecommunications, computer, amd media industries. Mr
Bonfield is a widely respected figure both within and outside the information
technology industry.
He is a non-executive director of Zeneca and of BICC and is deputy chairman of
the British Quality Foundation. He is to remain on the board of ICL as deputy
chairman after a short period as non-executive chairman. Keith Todd, director
of finance and business strategy, will take over as chief executive of ICL.
The arrival of Mr Bonfield is not expected to lead to any change in strategy.
The company's aim remains to become the world's largest telecommunications
company through overseas expansion. It is currently in discussions on possible
acquisitions and joint ventures, although it is not interested in acquiring
rival Cable &amp; Wireless. However, this does not rule out the possibility of it
purchasing Cable &amp; Wireless's valuable 57.5% stake in Hong Kong Telecom.
Recent signs of a deterioration in BT's relationship with the regulator, Don
Cruickshank of Oftel, sent the shares to a 17-month low earlier in the week.
Mr Cruickshank accused BT of failing to implement fair trading throughout its
business and suggested that BT felt there was no harm carrying out
anti-competitive practices ``unless and until the regulator intervenes''.
Although the UK is the most liberalised telecomunications market in terms of
ease of entry for new participants, it has one of the toughest regulatory
environments. BT cites the terms of its operating licence, and price cap as
evidence of this.
While the current regulatory environment was seen as appropriate at the time of
privatisation, BT now feels that 10 years on, the time is right to have a fresh
look at the regulatory system. It believes that given the rapid pace of change
in the industry, in terms of technologies and the globalisation of the
industry, it is too much to expect one person alone to supervise the industry.
It favours lighter regulation via a supervisory committee or the right of
appeal on decisions.
The City welcomed the unexpected board changes at BT and the shares gained 2!sp
to 357!sp. Robert Fleming Securities raised the stock from a sell to a hold.
Analyst Laurence Heyworth said BT's management changes ``could act as a
positive catalyst'' for the shares. In any case, BT's current yield of 6.5%
will underpin the shares.

DEVON Malcolm was given a glimmer of hope last night after another day of deep
depression. The Derbyshire fast-bowler's prospects of playing in next week's
second Test looked as dead as the Springbok Park pitch on which 15 overs had
brought him only one wicket - and plenty of punishment.
But manager Ray Illingworth - a lapsed member of Malcolm's fan club for much of
this tour - refused to add to the misery. ``It's a slow pitch and all I can ask
is that Devon rolls up his sleeves and runs in,'' he said. ``I think he tried
to do that.''
Malcolm attempted to bowl quickly but, all too often, the ball went even faster
off the bat as Orange Free State recovered from early afternoon trouble to
reach 245 for nine declared. His figures never looked encouraging, but an
18-year-old student, who never had played first class cricket before, put the
finishing touches to them.
Hendrik Dippenaar, star of last summer's South Africa Under-19 tour to England,
hooked Malcolm for an effortless 6, added two more 4s and was mobbed by his
Bloemfontein College mates after making 46.
Illingworth wisely declined to discount England's fastest bowler, just in case
next week's Test pitch at The Wanderers proves to be right up Malcolm's street.
Johannesburg traditionally provides the quickest surface in South Africa, and
it now holds the one sliver of hope for Malcolm.
John Crawley fully deserves to step out at The Wanderers, but will not do so
unless one of his batting rivals suffers an injury before Thursday.
The Lancashire player stroked an undefeated 69 - packed with 10 boundaries and
brimful of confidence - as England reached 121 for one second time around,
while extending their overall lead to 192.
Crawley, given a chance to open after having been denied by Thursday's
declaration, lost skipper Mike Atherton (13) to a firm clip to mid-wicket but
then shared an unbroken partnership of 77 with Mark Ramprakash.

STODDARD Sekers International, the Scottish manufacturer of quality carpets,
has suffered its first loss in 10 years.
The company, based at Elderslie, near Paisley, incurred a #625,000 loss during
the six months to September 30 as turnover slipped 11.4% to #25.9m. That
compared with a pre-tax profit of #565,000 in the first half of 1994.
``It is the first time we have registered a loss for 10 years,'' said chief
executive Ralph Ellis, noting that sales between July and September were 15%
down on the same period of 1994. But he was cautiously optimistic about an
improvement in the second half. Stoddard halved the interim dividend to 0.375p,
triggering a 3!sp plunge in the share price to 23p.
WEIR Group has secured an order for #2m of equipment to distill drinking water
from sea water at a Libyan oil refinery. Its Weir Westgarth factory in Glasgow
will deliver two desalinisation units to the Arabian Gulf Oil Company's Tobruk
refinery.
TOM Steele, who was head of news when Radio Forth started broadcasting in 1975,
will become managing director of the Edinburgh station in May. He replaces
Richard Findlay, who becomes chief executive of the parent company, Scottish
Radio Holdings.
Mr Steele started his career as a journalist in Dumfries and worked as a
political correspondent of the Scottish Daily Mail before moving to Radio Forth.
WELSH Water's profit surged in the first six months of the year, rising 63% to
#80.6m. Turnover inched up to #269.5m. There is an interim dividend of 12.6p
compared with a previous payment of a restated 6.9p.

WITH Glasgow-based tea trader James Finlay in the final stages of selling its
financial subsidiaries, Richard Capper has stepped down as an executive
director.
Mr Capper served as managing director of James Finlay Bank, the holding company
for the group's financial subsidiaries which are being sold to allow the group
to focus on its core activity of tea trading.
Two financial subsidiaries - Gaelic Invoice Factors and James Finlay Insurance
Brokers - were sold to management buy-out teams for #1.22m.
Finance director Pat Lockett said these disposals would be completed in March,
three months later than planned.
But he added: ``I think everything is in place and we're really sort of down to
the wind-up.''
Those still to go are Warne Investment and Finance Services, James Finlay Bank,
James Finlay Asset Finance, and James Finlay Investment Management.

This is man's work: Jimmy Logan looks forward to another Glasgow panto run in
the kind of wigs that even Bet Gilroy's collection couldn't shake a stick at.
TIGHTS! Bosoms!! Action!!! Panto-time approaches and already the Dame is
slipping into something suitably uncomfortable. Feet that arrived in sensible
black lace-ups are being edged into pointy-toed peerie heels. Bits that follow
the natural inclinations of gravity are suddenly wheeched and chivvied in
untoward directions, all in the interests of comedy. Something which looks like
a nine-day-wonder-bra appears and in the twinkling of a hook and eye, the Paps
of Jura have relocated themselves under the Dame's chin.
In slightly more than an hour, from stepping through the stage door as himself,
Jimmy Logan is giving us a twirl in a glittering glamarama gown that suggests
the evergreen hand-grenade joke: pull out the pin and it's every man for
himself!
Logan is - no question of it - a Grande Dame among great dames. Even back in
his teens, when he was part of the famous family act that kept Scotland and
beyond in happy stitches, he dabbled in damery.
``My father pooh-poohed the whole idea. I was about 17 and I'd been playing
this wee boy. Short trousers, torn shirt, a tyke. And it would go down very
well. Very well. But I knew I couldn't go on doing that. Apart from anything
else, producers were coming to see the show, I was starting to branch out, do
other things. So I told him I'd like to change a few things. Go into long
trousers, smarten up a bit. And do this one routine as a dame. Well as far as
he was concerned, it just wasn't on. Until I did it. And it went down so well
that he wanted me to do everything else as a dame!''
In fact, Logan's first forays into pantomime took him all over Britain and into
the company of some of the leading comics of the time - but not as a dame, to
begin with anyway. ``My first-ever pantomime was at the Empire Theatre in
Greenock, where the whole family was playing in Dick Whittington and his Cat.
I'd be about 15 and I was the cat. And I remember we were all staying with my
aunt Jean, my mother's sister, in Gourock. And she was a very clean woman, my
aunt Jean - an awfu' clean wummin - and she washed the catskin. Hung it up
outside the house to dry...... and it shrunk.
``So there I was, following this principal boy around, to London, on board
ship, all that - and I'm just about bent double inside this skin that's now too
wee. Sore back, sore legs. It was absolute murder. Standing up straight
afterwards...... murder!''
The next step was filling the Giant's shoes in Jack and the Beanstalk at the
Gaiety Theatre in Leith. This was to prove another instance of suffering for
the panto art. He describes how the Giant's feet had to be strapped into these
huge boots with an 18-inch platform and tin sides that went halfway up the
shin...... falling over was a perpetual, painful hazard. Never mind Jack's
swash and buckle - even a stray matchstick underfoot was enough to coggle this
ogre, who was himself baking in his own juices like a human pie.
``In order to bulk myself out properly for the
Continued on page 7
Continued from page 5
part, I wore two heavy overcoats under the costume - and boy, was I roasted!''
Logan laughs at the recollection of past discomforts. Only - what has changed,
exactly? He's just about to spend the next three months harnessed to the
traditional rigmarole of the Dame in Babes in the Wood at the King's in Glasgow.
Watching Logan prepare himself as Dame is to see, and hear, that tradition come
alive in a way that is both a personal and a theatrical history stretching back
to the forties. Wee weans - even their mums and dads, maybe - will roar and
guffaw at Logan's expert antics without ever knowing the half, the nth, of his
achievements within British variety and British theatre.
As he dights foundation over clean-shaven jaws, the anecdotes and panto-lore
issue from the changing face in the mirror. ``Five and nine, that was all you
used to need, Leichner's sticks in five and nine. Things have got a bit more
subtle - it's more a brown base now, not pink with the rouged dots, like a
clown.'' He talks of pantos done with Arthur Askey - Askey hospitalised after
being caught in a stage trap - of topping a bill with the legendary Douglas
Byng when Howard and Wyndham Productions ruled the stages. The Palladium in
Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, the Palladium in London - Logan played them all.
Suddenly the dressing-room is full of jostling dames and comics, their voices
and reminiscences all emanating from this figure now carving out a cupid's bow,
with extra curve on the corners. ``It helps with the smile.'' The lips stretch
into a ``will I eat you now or save you for later?'' grin, guaranteed to raise
laughs and goosebumps in equal measure.
Dames have to have this ambiguity, he says, as - peering over two Everests of
fibrefill - he slips on a pair of tights. Logan's legs are, by the way,
drop-dead, catwalk brilliant. Last year, at Kirkcaldy, I overhead this chap say
to a female colleague - ``He's got better legs than you''. ``I know,'' she said
mournfully, ``it's not fair.'' A size 11 pair of black high heels accentuate
the shapely calves and up he rises for the finishing touches.
``The audience have to know it's a man inside all the gear. That's the joke.
But at the same time, the Dame has to be like - like a granny, or the wummin up
the stairs, someone they'll know. Someone they'll laugh at, but trust. Because
it's all about good winning out over evil you know. And about putting the stars
in a child's eyes. That, most of all.'' And in a swoosh of frou-frou, a last
pat of an Ab Fab blonde hairdo and the teensiest dab of rouge, our dame is
ready to sashay centre stage. For sheer guts - and garters - there is nothin'
like a Dame.

LONDON, November 25 - The Duke of Cumberland is on his way north today, after
his father, King George II, this week gave him supreme command of the forces
deployed to halt the Jacobite invasion of England.
The appointment, the first sign that a darkening situation is being taken in
hand, was greeted with relief at Westminster and in the streets of the capital.
It was met with cheers and celebrations by the soldiers likely to face the
brunt of the clans' onslaught, the 15 regiments of infantry and five of cavalry
immobilised for several days at Lichfield, Staffordshire, through the illness
of their general, Sir John Ligonier.
Cumberland, only 24, is the hero of these veterans rushed home from the war in
Flanders. He commanded there for just one campaign, and was actually beaten at
the Battle of Fontenoy in May. But that did not dent the popularity he had won
by his bravery on the field of Dettingen two years ago. Wounded in the thick of
the fighting, he still helped to snatch victory from potential defeat. Now the
king has placed his hopes on his son again, as alarm spreads in a previously
complacent London.
After taking Carlisle, Prince Charles Edward Stuart has seized the initiative
and is marching rapidly south with little to stop him. Appalling conditions in
the mountains of Cumberland and Westmorland seem not to have hampered the
Jacobites' movements at all. Nor does their lack of equipment. As they have no
tents, they are advancing in two columns, one a day ahead of the other, so that
they can use the same quarters in the towns they pass.
The prince, leading the second column, refuses to ride and marches on foot as
well, wearing Highland dress with a blue sash and bonnet, sporting a white rose
in the band. His pipes and drums play The King shall enjoy his own again. His
clansmen carry banners with slogans - ``Liberty and Property, Church and King''
- meant to reassure onlookers.
Charles arrived at Penrith on November 21, covered 27 miles over snow and ice
to Kendal on November 23, and has now arrived at Lancaster. At Preston, where
the road improves, he will be able to rendezvous with his vanguard under Lord
George Murray.
Preston was the southernmost point reached by an army of English and Scottish
Jacobites in their last rebellion. There they were surrounded and forced to
surrender 30 years ago almost to the day. No such thing is likely to happen
this time.
Just one attempt has so far been made to intercept the invasion. Before
Carlisle fell, General George Wade tried to relieve it by crossing the Pennine
Hills from Newcastle, only to be beaten back by the atrocious weather. The
Government has no other troops closer than Lichfield.
The Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, the Earl of Derby, called out the militia 10
days ago. At the muster he found it so raw and ill-equipped that he decided it
could not even make a token stand. He rejected Wade's advice that it might at
least harass the Highlanders by sniping from behind hedge rows. Instead he has
ordered it off the main road south and sent it to Liverpool. There it will be
disarmed and dismissed, and its equipment stored on ships to prevent capture.
Derby is himself leaving for London, along with many other local landowners.
The flight of the gentry rules out the organisation of any resistance, and is
bound to depress the Lancastrians' morale. It must do the same as refugees
arrive here in the capital. The king, according to sources at court, has
adopted an attitude of ``obstinate, angry, determined practicality''.
But there can be no mistaking the deep worries of the Cabinet, especially of
the Prime Minister, Henry Pelham, and of his brother, the Duke of Newcastle,
the Whigs' parliamentary manager and electoral organiser, who has stated that
George II's crown is in ``the utmost danger''. The Secretary of State for
Scotland, the Marquis of Tweeddale, is under a cloud for abject failure to nip
the rebellion in the bud. The king has instead been taking advice on the
Scottish situation from Lord Marchmont, a Tory though not a Jacobite.
There are even rumours at Westminster that the Pelham brothers might be able to
live with a restoration of the Stuarts so long as they could ward off a French
landing in the South of England - though it is for the very purpose of opening
up two fronts that Prince Charles has invaded the north. The Government's
overriding concern is to avoid giving France a victory that would let her
finish the war in Europe and dictate the terms of peace. This would lose
Britain some of her colonies and other trading advantages.
In sending forces to engage Prince Charles, the Government risks leaving the
English coast unprotected. Since the Jacobite victory at Prestonpans in
September, the French have assembled shipping at Calais, Boulogne, and Dunkirk.
They have concentrated 15,000 troops in the area, mostly regiments for King
Louis XV's Irish Brigade. But the commander appointed for the expedition, the
Duc de Richelieu, has yet to move out of Paris.
Arrival of the first small reinforcement from France was reported, however,
three days ago in Scotland. After evading the Royal Navy in the North Sea, Lord
John Drummond landed at Montrose, Stonehaven, and Peterhead with a Scottish and
an Irish regiment in the French service, 800 soldiers in all. He is a brother
of the Duke of Perth, one of Prince Charles's generals.
He immediately issued a proclamation which, on his own initiative, exceeded the
terms of the Treaty of Fontainbleau signed last month between Louis XV and the
Jacobite ambassador to Versailles, which specified French help only for
Scotland. Drummond promised that his troops would join in the conquest of
England and Ireland as well, and that he would soon have 6000 more of them.

SUCH an elegant city is San Sebastian, a city innocent of slouch sox and zip
tops and the chain stores which sell these things. Along the Avenida de la
Libertad every heel has a little height, every throat and earlobe a little
gold. All skirts are slim, all blouses worn tucked in. Older men wear linen
jackets and the Basque beret, Picasso-style. Older women had their hair done
yesterday. Possibly it is in the by-laws.
But what is elegance without exuberance, or hair up without hair down?
The Donostia Tourist Award for Cultural Balance, then, to the gang of four I
found peeing against a wall in the old quarter on the night of the Basque
Regatta, caught short after a gallon or two of celebratory txakoli. I know it
was celebratory because they were wearing pink; the dusky, slightly faded
Schiaparelli pink of the winning team rather than the
damask-napkin-blotted-with-crevettes-Marie-Rose shade of one of the losers. The
Celtic v Rangers quality of regatta night in San Sebastian is utterly redeemed
by the absence of primary colours.
The teams, from fishing villages along the Spanish Basque coast, wear T-shirts
in shades of bougainvillea, mimosa, and avocado. Their support is numbered in
thousands; whole hillsides heave with pale lilac; monuments, terraces, and
boulevards are a toppling mass of iced pistachio.
We were watching from the sea, on the Lord Mayor's boat, on a blowy day with
brisk little waves rocking open boats like elongated soup tureens which, since
breakfast time, had been ferrying friends, families, and sporting citizens (the
Basques are wild betters) out to the perimeter of the three-mile round-the-bay
course.
The bay of San Sebastian is nothing if not spectacular. From the headland of
Monte Urgull, where a giant statue of Our Lady balances on a slim pinnacle in
modest imitation of Rio de Janeiro, to the heights of Monte Igueldo behind the
town, the city wraps itself around its three beaches and the mouth of its
sparkling river with the jagged shapes of the Pre-Pyrenees for a backdrop, as
befits the home of a film festival, gourmet capital of Spain, and summer
retreat of the pre-Franco royals.
Patrician Madrilenos of last century flocked here in the wake of Queen Maria
Christina, escaping north to the mountain air rather than south to the Sahara
breath that turns on northern Europe.
Much as London society followed Queen Victoria to Deeside, they built their
splendid villas beneath Monte Igueldo and, social revolution coming slow to
Spain, most citizens can remember aproned maids scurrying out on to Ondaretta
Beach each day with linen and fine china and the endless courses of a Basque
lunch. Franco, too, came here each summer, but in this utterly divergent region
that has Guernica in its hinterland, was not much seen outside his walls.
Today the royals go to Majorca and the Basque separatists dangle their banners
equably enough among the regatta team colours along the promenade, albeit their
slogan translates ``Those who wear the blue ribbon are the murderers'' - a
reference to the groundswell of protest against the separatists' tactics of
kidnapping prominent citizens; dissenters wear blue lapel ribbons.
The utter distinctiveness of Basque culture and language is not laboured, as
the cosmetic fiddling with Spanish place names might suggest. Euskadi is the
region comprising the provinces of Gipuzkoa, Bizkaia, and Araba; San Sebastian
in Basque is Donostia, and this form is favoured on direction signs; personal
names are constructed out of discarded Scrabble tiles and torn-out end pages of
dictionaries. Arantxa is not Basque, but her name is. Olazabal scores on both
counts. The Basques are thought to have arrived from the Caucasus around 4000
BC - the language has links with Georgian - and they got here first.
You may still come across a spray-painted ETA sign - Euskadi ta Askatasuna,
Freedom for the Basques - but the present degree of autonomy, which makes the
parliament here the only regional one with tax-raising powers, has brought
about a general reaction to strong-arm methods.
This is, after all, the most ordered society in Spain with, tucked away between
a coastline reminiscent of the French Riviera and an Alpine hinterland out of
The Sound of Music, the peninsula's heaviest industrialisation and 96% of
Spain's Michelin-starred restaurants.
If there is a Basque word for regatta I wish I knew it, to distance this
boiling bayful of people from the Henley model. Erratic oompahs across the
water herald the approach of the band boat which wobbles past, dangerously
overcrowded with plump musicians in sailor suits and Harpo Marx hats, balancing
upright, all brass and elbow, two miles out.
The 12-man racing boats rowing an abbreviated Oxford to Cambridge course in the
open sea commemorate the pre-mechanised local fishing industry when the crews
or rival villages would race the catch back to the quay to get the best prices.
All this, mark you, is a bit distant and theoretical for anyone brought up on
Sportsnight sinew close-ups.
But we certainly know when the race is finished. Engines rev and everything
converges at speed - motor launches, yachts, fishing boats, inflatables, kayaks
- some making serious waves, others bouncing off them, and the winners, the
pretty pink party themselves, rowing against the tide, clamber on to our deck
for the presentation.
San Sebastian's own Alan Partridge, all designer suit and tangled mike flex, is
hoisted across a gap from a motor launch. The human bouillabaisse claps and
cheers. Back on shore everyone settles down to a celebratory four-hour lunch as
a prelude to the evening's tapas bar crawl.
We are staying in the Hotel Maria Christina, San Sebastian's finest. My window
looks down the Paseo de Republica Argentina past giant hoardings of Mel Gibson
in woad. The hero himself arrives in two days time for the film festival.
Whichever way you walk from here you hit water, and, if you're lucky, a
happening.
Strolling early along the River Urumea, admiring the litter-free pavements, the
trees, the benches, the elegance of the joggers, past the art-deco Kursaal
Bridge and the rococo Maria Christina Bridge built by Gustave Eiffel, I hear a
pipe band playing Scotland the Brave.
Across the sparse early traffic stream comes a willowy, olive-skinned cohort of
mock Scots in Black Watch tartan, followed by a detachment of Redcoats playing
The British Grenadiers on fife and drum, a few horsemen in purple with white
berets (Portuguese, someone whispers), Napoleon on foot, and someone who may be
the Duke of Wellington mounted, and a detachment of young terrorists in shades
and black berets.
Those of us about in this late-rising weekend city, follow the band out on to a
headland where they reward us by setting off a number of bombs. Next to me a
stout lady sits down on the sea wall and starts to sob. The cannon fire that
follows is therapeutic by comparison, and when it is returned from the wooded
slopes of Monte Igueldo we are hardly nervous at all.
Throughout the morning I keep running into the procession, good-naturedly
exchanging small arms fire with householders on their balconies, or accepting
the French surrender, for all this is to commemorate the raising of Napoleon's
five-year siege of San Sebastian by the British and Portuguese in 1813 for
which, to this day, people are only moderately and retrospectively grateful.
The fire the British started destroyed most of the city and caused the loss of
more than 2000 lives. The resulting rebuilding, however, with broad avenues,
stunning squares - one has an island housing a duck pond, a Japanese bridge,
and banana plants - and architectural influences from all over Europe is the
source of San Sebastian's present glory.
It is the partevieja, the old quarter, a maze of tiny passages crammed in
beneath Monte Urgull, which houses the city's most atmospheric pinchas bars,
pinchas being the delectable Basque version of tapas, as well as two stunning
churches whose facades are first glimpsed in slices at the end of the little
streets. The sixteenth-century Gothic San Vicente and the eighteenth-century
baroque Santa Maria, are survivors of the great blaze, following which the
townspeople decided to rebuild the city. Today's citizens are every bit as
resourceful, the traders voting successfully to keep all chain stores out of
the city.
After dark during Basque festivals - that is to say, a lot of the time - the
steep-sided Constitution Square in the old quarter, once a bullring, has
musicians playing Trikitrixas, even the most sophisticated cafe-goers drop
their pinchas, raise their arms Highland style, and perform what is surely the
fastest free-form folk dance on earth.
And then there is pelota, a sort of killer squash peculiar to the Basques,
played in a fronton, with heavy gambling right to the last point, the
cigar-smoking spectators tossing their bets to courtside bookies in hollowed
out tennis balls. I spent two hours at a fronton utterly enthralled. There is a
bar, but no-one is drunk. The paired players have the appearance of mutated
lobsters with one giant right claw - the basket strapped to the wrist - to
launch the hard ball at the wall. The sustained and shifting betting pattern
produces such an adrenalin high that the best players are regularly flown to
Macao to provide sport for Asia's gambling capital.
None of this eccentricity prepares you for the classic alpine scenery of the
hinterland. The Regil Valley is a stunning confection of severe perpendicular
mountain dwellings, steep plantings of maize and apples, and pasture that
reaches to the summits and provides contrast for the high, bare peaks in the
distance.
At Loyala, birthplace of Ignatius, founder of the Jesuit order, the paved
courtyard in front of Spain's biggest basilica, where the Pope's helicopter
once landed, has the air of a village square in evening, which indeed it is.
Small boys do wheelies, mothers perch with their babies on the wall, chatting,
against a sweeping avenue of trees donated by the world's Catholic countries.
The great eroded stone lions of the balustrade are silhouetted against steep
hillsides with grazing cows. The church, part baroque, part Renaissance, holds
4000, and built into its overwhelming opulence is the substantial stone house
where Loyola was born in 1491. The museum here is excellent, all the better for
the contrast of its remote setting when you come blinking out into the light.
Up and down the Basque coast there are a host of steep-sided fishing villages,
all with wonderful fish restaurants.
Getaria, south of San Sebastian, was home to Sebastian Elcano, the first man
actually to circumnavigate the globe (Magellan, who gets the credit, died on
the way home). Not to mention Balenciaga, and Placido Domingo's mother.
Nearby Zarautz is a surfers' mecca. Heading north towards the French border,
Hondarribia (Fuenterrabia), the last town in Spain, has wonderful centuries-old
houses and restaurants, a sandy beach, and the most haunting and oldest of all
paradors in the eleventh-century castle of Carlos V, restored just enough to be
habitable, so that you may sit in a glassed-over half-courtyard looking out on
to a massive shattered tenth-century wall, or sleep in a bedroom whose window
recesses alone could shelter a homeless family.
FACTFILE
IBERIA flies Heathrow to Bilbao, a one-and-a-half hour flight from #169 return
with special offers available. San Sebastian is an hour's drive away.
There is a ferry connection from Portsmouth.
Local transport is excellent. Hotels tend to be pricey - the five-star Maria
Christina is 23,800 pesetas for two sharing a double room (CIGA reservations:
0800 353535) - but there are inexpensive pensions and an excellent campsite at
Barrio Igueldo.
Hondarribia's Parador El Emperador (no restaurant) is a bargain at from 16,000
pesetas for a double room.

astards Of Melody, Love Nut (One Fifteen/Interscope)
q Eh up, granddad, we're living in a punked-up, post-post-grunge world of
non-specific guitar grindings and shouty vox. But don't turn your deaf-aid
down. Love Nut, a perky bunch who apparently hail from Baltimore, add nasal
Beatloid vocal melodies to the standard market-led mix, seemingly moved by the
sarky spirit of moptop Johnny Lemondrop rather than the blankness of Burt
Cokain. Thus it is Love Nut's Nirvana-style statements of teenage alienation -
``I'm a loser, I'm nothing, I'm never gonna be what you want'' - come over with
a measure of amused irony. Love Nut music is crisp as well as loud; deft as
well as muscular. And you'd have to be very, very aged not to tap an
appreciative toe to Love Nut's steamroller version of the Lemon Pipers'
splendid chestnut Green Tambourine.
Everyday I Wear A Greasy Black Feather On My Hat, Moondog Jr (Island)
q An assembly of rasping Belgians, one of whom is a temporary refugee from
deUS, seek to be moved by the holy ghost of Troutmask Replica. At their best,
they're like Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band mixed with War and Tom Waits.
At their most ordinary, Moondog Jr resemble the Red Hot Chilli Peppers trying
too hard to be Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band mixed with War and Tom
Waits. Overall, some pleasing moments of atonal funkiness. But for that
full-flavour Beefheart Martian-delta blues experience, you're best advisd to
dig out your copy of Lick My Decals Off, Baby.
A Recipe For Disaster, DJ Food (Ninja Tune)
q DJ Food isn't so much the name of the act as part of this album's philosophy.
It was assembled by Ninja Tune's ruling duo, Jonathan More and Matt Black,
better known as Coldcut, and is intended to demonstrate the sonic happeningness
of blokes who, instead of employing cumbersome and outmoded musical
instruments, wield turntables and programme beat-boxes and samplers. So how
good is it? Well, its sleeve provides an inadvertent summing-up. It features a
photograph of a take-away pizza. Next time round Coldcut should enlist the help
of more live musos to cook up something fresher.

WHEN four teenagers drowned in the sea after a canoe paddle along the Dorset
coast went tragically wrong, the shock waves reverberated through outdoor
centres the length and breadth of Britain - and forced government action to
improve safety regulations.
The Activity Centres (Young Persons' Safety) Act became law in June this year
and a consultation document is now being considered concerning its practical
implementation in the form of regulations covering commercial providers of
adventure activities.
But while the welfare of young people attending activity centres is widely
recognised as important, there are fears that if adventurous pursuits are
hedged about with too many regulations, youngsters will be deprived of
enjoyment and may be excluded from taking part in ``risk'' sports.
The Activity Centres Act was the direct result of what has become known as the
Lyme Bay tragedy. On March 22, 1993, a party of eight sixth-formers from a
school in Plymouth set off on what was intended to be a two-hour return trip
from Lyme Regis to Charmouth. With them were their teacher and two
outdoor-centre instructors.
What should have been a straightforward exercise turned to disaster when the
youngsters were swept out to sea and their canoes capsized. The group was
eventually rescued by helicopter, but it was too late for four of the teenagers
- two boys and two girls - who had been in the cold and increasingly rough sea
for three hours or more.
Their deaths caused a public outcry after a 16-day trial at Winchester Crown
Court revealed that the trip had been a catalogue of errors - not least of
which was that neither of the instructors in the party had even the most basic
supervisory qualification in canoeing.
The trial led to the managing director of the company running the activity
centre which organised the outing being jailed for three years for
manslaughter. A powerful call was issued by the judge, Mr Justice Ognall, for a
Government inquiry into the running of activity centres, and improved safety
controls.
Where parents and teachers entrusted their children to those who ran activity
holidays, the potential for injury or death was too obvious for safety
procedures to be left to the inadequate vagaries of self-regulation, he said.
The stinging comments could not be ignored by the Government, particularly when
backed up by parental pressure for action, and the Activity Centres Act was the
almost inevitable result. The Health and Safety Commission has circulated a
consultation document to interested parties on the detailed specifications of
the Act and the deadline for responses was yesterday. After they have been
examined, the commission will draw up proposals for a series of regulations
designed to tighten up on safety at commercial outdoor centres.
But Peter Hitt, a former adviser on outdoor education for Lothian Region, who
now runs a consultancy specialising in risk assessment and management, believes
the whole exercise is something of a knee-jerk reaction, and that health and
safety legislation already in place offers a sufficient degree of control.
``The Lyme Bay tragedy was one tiny incident in terms of the overall numbers of
children taking part in outdoor activities,'' he said. ``If we applied the same
rules to travelling on the road we just wouldn't go.''
That was not to say that people should not be qualified to supervise
youngsters, simply that the whole thing should be kept in perspective. The
Health and Safety Commission document itself acknowledges: ``There is
widespread recognition that some degree of risk is unavoidable if these
activities are to accomplish their essential purpose. The activities allow
young people to develop by meeting challenges they do not necessarily face
every day, and to experience a sense of achievement in overcoming them.'' It
also says that ``there have been few accidents and the numbers involved have,
in statistical terms, been low''.
The criteria laid down for deciding which adventure activities should be
subject to statutory licensing are those involving a significant risk of death;
where the activity is vulnerable to changes in weather or the natural
environment; and where there is a significant risk to the safety of the group
if things go wrong. The competence of instructors and leaders is also regarded
as crucial.
``It was the failure of management to make proper provision for these factors
which led to the tragedy at Lyme Bay in 1993 where four young people lost their
lives. The few similar tragedies point to the same conclusions about the main
sources of risk,'' states the document.
Activities to which the criteria apply are listed as caving, climbing, mountain
walking, paddle sports (including canoeing), sailing, and skiing. The document
indicates that: ``When instruction or leadership in any of the activities
within the scope of the statutory scheme is offered on a commercial basis to
young persons under 18, the provider would need to obtain a licence.''
The commission makes it clear that ``it does not wish to cut across the freedom
of voluntary and national youth organisations to offer the opportunity to
members to participate in adventure activities on a non-commercial basis. It is
therefore proposed that voluntary associations should not be subject to
statutory licensing except when they choose to act in a commercial manner.''
One such voluntary organisation is the Scout Association. David Shelmerdine,
chief executive of its Scottish Council, has been examining the proposal
document and its potential impact.
``Parents are looking for some reassurance that their sons and daughters will
be under the supervision of competent people if they are going to outdoor
centres,'' he said. ``What it's leading to really is a reassurance to people
that there aren't cowboys operating in the sector.
``I think everybody acknowledges that where there is adventurous activity there
is an element of risk; but obviously there needs to be risk assessment and
that's where you come on to needing competent and approved staff.''
One problem the association is grappling with before responding to the
consultation document is that it will be forced to obtain statutory licences
for its two activity centres in Scotland - one at Lochgoilhead in Argyll and
the other at its Fordell Firs headquarters near Dunfermline in Fife - if it
wishes to continue letting them out on a commercial basis.
The costs involved in setting up and running the licensing authority, plus the
costs to providers of making improvements to their safety management have been
estimated at between #2.7m and #5.3m over a period of 10 years, depending on
the number of centres covered by the scheme, thought to be between 1000 and
3000.
Once the regulations are in place, any provider who should have a licence and
does not, or any holder of a licence who contravenes its conditions, could be
liable to a fine or up to two years' imprisonment. A licensing authority for
the whole of Britain will oversee the scheme and centres will be subject to
inspection. All licences will have to be renewed annually, and a fee paid. The
consultation document acknowledges that ``it is unlikely that the benefits of
the regulations will ever exceed the costs'', and that ``if the licensing
scheme was extended to schools and voluntary organisations, it is estimated
that the costs would exceed the quantifiable benefits by a ratio of 20 to one''.
In this area though, where children's lives are at stake, cost-benefit analysis
and cold calculation come a poor second to emotion.
Parents must have the confidence that their children are properly cared for
when they attend outdoor centres. It is equally important, though, that the
regulations are not so stringent and complex that they lose out on the
opportunity to take risks and test themselves in the outdoors.

MUNCHING through tart lemony leaves, I cried triumphantly ``wood sorrel!'' as
alarmed ladies strode their dogs through the beautiful, ancient Birks of
Aberfeldy.
``Wild carrot, wall lettuce, wild garlic!'' Fired with enthusiasm, I realised
how few friends would now risk calling at my house for a salad.
Thousands of outdoor people, I suspect, have shared my hang ups and
frustrations on the whole topic of wild flowers and plants. Trudging through
heather, meadows, glens and bogs, ever more intrigued by splashes of colour or
delicate waving rock beauties, we long to know what they are, or how much rare
saxifrage we've passed blindly in a day.
But birds (when they keep still) look satisfyingly like the books: the yellow
flower we hold before baffling, jargony texts could be one of 30.
Armed with my formidable knowledge of dandelions, sinister spotted orchids, old
lupins and killer foxglove leaves (from Agatha Christie) I finally seized
courage and enrolled on a wild flower identification course with Scottish
Conservation Projects: first in the Birks' woodland habitat, then in the
mysterious peatlands of Scottish Wildlife Trust's nature reserve on Flanders
Moss. Dr Veronica Howard, SCP's training services manager, was our excellent,
knowledgeable and infectiously enthusiastic tutor.
The charity runs dozens of training courses each year (mainly at weekends) on
many topics related to conservation and environment, along with numerous other
activities.
We met British and foreign students, retired lecturers, a ranger who wished his
bosses came on such courses ``because they're the ones who need to'', and a
former health visitor who'd changed tack to study for a rural resources degree.
Some people belonged to one of SCP's 75 active affiliated local groups and
midweek groups, which attract an even greater variety of volunteer members
including unemployed and retired people, and school leavers.
Howard's courses were particularly valuable to novices in keeping groups small,
and in combining straightforward, relaxed and jargon-free exploration with
useful lecturers and written material which included glossaries of baffling
terms.
You learn to think about basic clues before peering at flower illustrations:
what's the habitat, altitude, season, climate, tree or shrub layer?
You learn to be observant about which similar plants have hairy or smooth
leaves; to sniff carefully, discovering many new aromas of pineapple or fetid
unpleasantness: and if you're a writer, you marvel at the richness of language
and description. Solomons Seal, Yellow Archangel, Wood Sanicle, Marsh
Woundwort, Doves-Foot and Cranesbill.
There are only two problems. First, this is a complex absorption which must be
followed up. Compared with birdwatching, you forget this amazing new knowledge
quickly unless you keep pursuing it. That could be dangerous, especially if you
acquire a zest for herbs and edible plants: I've already forgotten what hemlock
looks like.
The second warning is that still more than birdwatching, it encourages bizarre
obsessive behaviour - in my case, sniffing through weeds on hands and knees at
Crieff Hydro, then being driven from allotments on suspicion of loitering with
intent.

SOPRANO saxophone star Bob Wilber has startled the jazz world by announcing
that he is to retire from playing in May next year.
If Wilber follows through on this intention then he will be the first jazz
musician of note to give up playing while still physically able to lift his
horn to his lips.
In present times when longevity is being celebrated with records from still
active veterans still being made and issued, it is an astonishing decision and
one I hope Wilber will reconsider.
There are personal reasons behind my wish that Wilber continues to play, not
just an admiration for his skills on soprano saxophone, clarinet and, to a
lesser extent tenor as well.
Wilber, the one-time protege of Sidney Bechet, has been a seminal figure in my
own jazz experiences. He was a member of the Eddie Condon All Stars who toured
Britain in l957 and while I was a young reporter on the Dundee Courier Wilber
was one of the first American musicians I heard in the flesh and was able to
interview.
He was still under 30 himself then. I can still recall his clarinet feature in
the Caird Hall that night - he played Love Me Or Leave Me without a hint of the
rhapsodic Bechet in his tone because by that time he had moved away from his
first major influence to embrace the styles of Benny Goodman and others.
By the time I next caught up with him it was New York in l968 and Wilber had
returned to playing soprano and was a charter member of The World's Greatest
Jazz Band, a stellar group which helped revitalise Wilber's playing and
resurrect his career.
By now the Bechet legacy was only a faint echo with Wilber using a curved
soprano and he admits: ``From the very first notes I played on it, I heard a
definite difference from the straight soprano sound I was used to. My first
influence was Johnny Hodges and then I added Louis Armstrong and I began to
feel that this was the distinctive musical identity I had been looking for.''
His feature when I heard him in the Rainbow Grill, high above Manhattan that
night, was One Morning In May and it was the hint of Hodges that captivated me
and which did give Wilber the individual voice he had been seeking.
That voice continued to be heard when he left the WGJB and formed one of the
most exciting small groups of the seventies, Soprano Summit, with fellow reed
man Kenny Davern.
The group remained together for three years and has been revived on occasions
in recent years as Summit Reunion with Wilber playing soprano, clarinet, alto
and tenor while Davern limits himself solely to clarinet. The music has again
been memorable and it is hard to believe that Wilber will walk away from all of
this in a few months' time.
In his autobiography Music Was Not Enough he wrote tellingly: ``Things outside
music have become important to me. I no longer need to be a success; I don't
need to make it. I already am and I already have!''
I hope he thinks again because he is one of the keepers of the flame, a link
going back to the giants of the music and a player who respects the jazz
tradition and understands it.

BBut Beautiful, Brian Lemon (Zephyr)
q Zephyr is a new label owned by one John Bune, a retired businessman who
decided - very wisely - that the best way to invest money he made on the Stock
Market was by recording his favourite jazz pianist - the superb Brian Lemon.
Earlier this year, he gave Lemon carte blanche to make a series of recordings
with his preferred sidemen, and he opted for some of the British jazz scene's
most distinguished players. On these thoughtfully selected 13 tracks, the
ever-classy Lemon is in the suitably distinguished company of guitarist Dave
Cliff, bassist Dave Green, and drummer Allan Ganley.
A Beautiful Friendship, Roy Williams-Brian Lemon Quintet with Warren Vache
(Zephyr)
q Luckily for us, American cornettist Warren Vache (playing at Glasgow's Moir
Hall on Tuesday 28) was in London while the Bune recordings were getting under
way, and he needed little persuasion to guest on this album with old pals
Williams (trombone), Lemon, Cliff, Ganley, and Green. The choice of tunes may
be safe, but the playing - especially Vache's - is hot. Witness in particular
the groovy intro to Comes Love - a foot-stompingly funky cornet fanfare over
jungly-sounding drums - and the fiery duets featuring both Vache and trombonist
Williams on Moten Swing and Just Friends.

I AM continually fascinated by the lengths to which some anglers will go in
their passionate pursuit of one particular species of fish. The general
perception of a Scottish angler is, perhaps, of a happy chappy who enjoys the
odd winter day fishing for grayling, a cast or two for spring salmon, a holiday
outing sea-fishing with the family, and maybe a more focused couple of days for
trout on, say, Loch Leven or salmon on a reasonably priced beat of one of our
Scottish rivers.
That may be true, but there are also the addicts; those with a partiality for
pike, a sympathy with salmon, and a tantalising taste for trout or tope. Fine
chaps all, but it seems to me that those who choose the most difficult option
are the ferox fanatics.
Those who number this so-called cannibal trout as their own personal addiction
are destined to have a difficult time. They will spend many fruitless hours in
its pursuit on the large and sometimes featureless ferox lochs of Scotland, but
those with a smidgeon of knowledge of its habits and habitats will, as ever in
fishing, have an advantage over the chap who turns up at the waterside with a
vague idea of how to go about it.
One man who I suspect has never had a vague idea in his life, is Ron Greer. As
far as I can tell, all his ideas have been definite and well thought-out, and
his new book, Ferox Trout and Arctic Charr . . . A Predator, its Pursuit and
its Prey is proof of his dedication to and interest in this fish.
Greer comes at his subject from several directions. Having worked at the
Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory at Faskally, gives him scientific credence. His
work with the Loch Garry Tree Group marks his care and concern for the country.
And his cheerful guidance of that happy band of fanatics, the Ferox-85 Group,
shows a deep-seated sense of humour and patience while pursuing this often
difficult quarry.
Starting with the premise that the ferox, and its prey, the charr, are a legacy
of the climatic changes during successive Ice Ages of the Pleistocene era, the
ferox being the aquatic equivalent of the wolf, perhaps, Greer suggests that
land-based plants and animals can be touched, picked, watched, and photographed.
People identify with the conservation of this wildlife, especially if it has a
nice smell or a ``kittenish'' face, whereas fish live in an alien aquatic
environment, and their lives are largely unknown. When wolves brought down
Irish elk for food in the Shannon basin and bull reindeer battled for mates on
the shores of what is now Loch Shin, ferox and charr were even then engaged in
the same roles that they play today. Underwater, we are transported back to the
Ice Age.
Ferox are to be found in many lochs and lakes in northern Europe. They are not
to be confused with the American lake trout, which is actually a species of
charr. We are talking about a member of the salmon family, a true trout, Salmo
trutta. ``Ferox trout'' covers virtually every aspect of the fish and its life.
There is a wealth of information on how to go about catching this fascinating
fish. Details of fishable lochs, baits, and terminal tackle, and most important
of all, protective clothing for those long wet days, are given with great good
humour.
It is suggested that ferox fishing can be bum-numbing and brain-numbing, but I
reckon that anyone reading Greer's book will find the subject fascinating. And
he and the Ferox-85 Group know what they are talking about. In April 1993,
their experience and relentlessness (an important word in ferox fishing)
brought them a new British record brown trout . . . 19lb, 103/8oz, to be
precise. Greer reckons there are bigger ferox to be caught in Scotland, and
this well-researched, passionate, and humorous book will certainly put you in
the mood to out-ferox the Ferox-85 Group. But remember, you'll have to be
especially relentless!

n THE Big Interview No.6 - Elspeth Hopringle (tenants' leader) Edinburgh,
November 1591.
Myths: For decades Edinburgh has lagged behind other parts of Scotland in
providing a local leper sanctuary. However, the city's decision today to back a
plan for the construction of a small house for lepers north of Calton Hill has
not met with universal approval. Elspeth Hopringle is secretary of Greenside
Tenants' Association. You say, Mistress Hopringle, that you're infuriated by
this decision but are you not leaving yourself open to charges of overriding
self-interest?
Hopringle: Have you ever shaken hands wi' a leper? I mean, given his hand a
right good shake. Of course, you haven't. Everyone is nervous about having
lepers around. It's only natural. We realise the need for a sanctuary. It's a
damned disgrace that Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Ayr have had sanctuaries long since
and the capital is only now getting round to facing the problem. But we
sincerely believe the wrong place has been chosen. Let's face it - would the
cooncillors have a leper colony at their front door?
Myths: Am I right in thinking that your association represents only the
occupiers of a few dilapidated shacks on the road to Leith?
Hopringle: They might just be shacks to you, son, but they're home sweet home
to us. Wi' property values already having slipped thanks to those years o'
feuding between King Jamie and his mammy this latest brainwave is bound to send
prices into the basement. Mind you, that's just a side issue, it's the
principle we're concerned wi'.
Myths: Are you not reassured by the arrangements for the operation of the
hostel which the council announced today? The leper house is to be run to a
very strict set of rules with only five residents, two with their wives. The
lepers are, under no circumstances, to stir from the house, to go about looking
for alms, no visitors will be permitted. From sunrise to sunset the door is to
be kept locked fast and the only concession to contact with the outside world
is that wives will be allowed to go to market and each patient will take in
turns to sit at the door with a clapper and beg on behalf of the house from
passers-by.
Hopringle: Oh aye, that's all very fine but oor bairns play on that hill. Can
the council assure us that the air thereaboots will be fit to breathe. This is
the thin end o' the wedge. Our fear is that Greenside will become the dumping
ground for folk wi' all sorts of anti-social problems, Spaniards, plague
victims and the like. Look, my brother was a leper and a nicer bloke you
couldna meet. But did we invite him to dinner? Did we hell. They must be kept
apart from the community. Has anyone thought o' the Bass Rock?
Myths: Is there any further action your association can take to prevent this
proposal becoming reality?
Hopringle: We thought about delivering a barrow load of pig-shit to the front
door of the council offices but we reckoned that would be a waste of good
manure. I don't want to give too much away but there's talk of lying down in
front of the builder's cairt when construction begins.

Highlights from the Plugged Nickel, Miles Davis (Colombia)
q Taken from the exhaustive and exhausting eight-CD set, these six Davis
standards present a fascinating, warts and all, fly on the wall view of his
second great quintet (Wayne Shorter on saxophone; Herbie Hancock, piano; Ron
Carter, bass; and Tony Williams, drums) working in the intimacy of a club at a
time when colder concerts were taking over. The band is by turns expansive,
accommodating, and collectively goading, and the leader's trumpet wavers edgily
between hurt defiance and devil-may-care belligerence as only he could.
Swingin' Spirits, Ian Cruickshank with Pearl Django (Fret)
q Guitarist and Django Reinhardt disciple Cruickshank flew from his Berkshire
home to Tacoma, Washington, to play with a local string trio who, although you
might not know from this recording, embraced Reinhardt's music all of two years
previously. The tunes are substantially Cruickshank's in-the-style-of originals
with a few lesser-played Reinhardt items, crisply played and with a mixture of
reverence and freshness which puts this above the ``just another Django tribute
album'' allegations.

CALLUM INNES has had a hectic year. And more hullaballoo is certain to break
next week when he appears on Channel 4, as part of the controversial London
Tate Turner Prize.
Nominated for both Britain's top art awards: the Tate Turner to be announced on
Tuesday, plus the Jerwood Painting Prize seen at London's Royal Academy and
Edinburgh's Royal Scottish Academy during this summer's Edinburgh Festival,
it's the kind of situation that only arises in books or films. It gave him the
possibility of winning a total of #50,000. I wonder what the bookmakers' odds
were?
Certainly Scottish art aficionados have all been keeping fingers and toes
crossed for this Edinburgh-born, Aberdeen-trained, Glasgow School of Art tutor
who is both an international shooting star and, for my money, the nice guy of
the art world.
Within his now ever-spinning, international circuit (shows this year include
Zurich, Paris, Stuttgart, Amsterdam, Nottingham and Dusseldorf, with Florence
in December), Innes's studio must seem a haven of peace with its white-walled
calm and inner courtyard. The studio complex was created in contemplative,
oriental style by artists Bob Callender and Liz Ogilvie and subsequently bought
for a lot of money by veteran American abstractionist Sam Francis. Soon
afterwards, it was rented to Innes.
Innes's original studio was in the old 369 Cowgate building, where his
distinctive abstracts that brought him to national notice in the 1990 British
Art Show, spilled out on to the corridor. Renting Frances's place has not
really solved his space problem, for Innes's large pristine canvases need lots
of room: room to be painted, studied and stored. However, its bright, top-lit
rooms; ``it has such beautiful light - though it was like a hothouse this
summer!'' did bring colour into his work. That, and perhaps the arrival of his
first child. ``I like the way colour can motivate; make you feel happy or sad.''
Saturated red and yellow canvases light up the space. ``Yellow is an extreme
colour. I wanted to push my painting to another extremity.'' He's aware of the
dangers of becoming decorative: ``I'm always walking a tightrope - but it's
nice when you surprise yourself.''
The new abstracts are bigger. ``I'm already looking for a larger studio,'' he
told me. ``I want to get back to what I had been expecting to do this year,
that is keep things quiet and slow, push the work forward, experiment, return
to large watercolours and paper works. My wife, Hyjdla, is a photographer as
well as looking after our son, so a studio is vital. I must find someone
interested in art with a big, cheap space to let! It's not easy.''
Ironically Francis pioneered rumbustious American abstract expressionism, only
to take a splashy oriental, minimalist swing to simplicity after a long tour of
Japan in 1957. Innes's own work relied heavily on chance at the start, as he
dripped turpentine vertically down white, cream, grey, olive or brown
monochromatic canvases, so marks bled or imploded against each other. These
vertical dribbles and rivulets soon became ``subtracted zips'' or
pinstripe-lines as the marks on canvas were controlled, structured, ``almost
completely planned,'' via subtraction.
``Callum wants to give the impression the marks left on the canvas look natural
and impersonal, the product of natural forces such as gravity and surface
tension. But he coaxes turps into channels and certain widths with great
precision. The end result is anything but chance,'' says the National Gallery's
Keith Hartley. Innes calls these landscapes: ``It's not landscape painting.
It's about walking in the hills or along Scotland's East Coast where the light
filters through in an incredible way.'' Ironically his work is rarely seen in
the UK. Zurich, Germany and Antwerp are more sympathetic.
By 1994/95 he had moved on to ``exposed'' paintings, where part is thickly
painted; another part stripped back, washed of its original oil to leave a
shadow of stain, a hint of hue. Atmospheric yet geometric; minimal yet complex,
these are above all elegant pictures. The paint can be luscious and thick, or
thin and ethereal. It can shimmer like shot silk or shantung, or drift mistily.
A methodical craftsman and perfectionist, his immaculate studio with its top
light, clean floor, precisely remade walls, ``nothing was flat or straight''
and plastic-wrapped canvases, ``it costs #90 to get them stretched - and I use
a lot'' bear witness to his care. He has an assistant, Alan, and many rows of
brushes and piles of Schmincke paints. ``I've always spent money on quality
pigment.''
This summer Innes had the unique problem of deciding how to present two very
different major London shows. He chose to ``keep the Jerwood cool'' with
characteristically restrained canvases, (white on white; black with grey) while
his current major space at the Tate has newer work done in the last two months.
``I'm very happy with the Tate show. The comments have been very favourable. So
far it's gone really well. I'm enjoying it.''
BBC2's Late Show discussion of the four finalists for the #30,000 Turner prize:
notorious dead sheep 'n' shark man Damien Hirst, racehorse fanatic Mark
Wallinger and sole woman, Mona Hatoum, had several round table pundits voting
for Innes to win.
New oils include red dots dancing on a pale shellac surface. Again it looks
like a random scatter gun pattern. In fact it's all put on with a small brush.
``A bit like manoeuvring mercury - but you only get one hour's grace before it
dries!'' He continues: ``I wanted to roughen things up again. People find it
difficult because there are several languages going on in my work.'' A solitary
square Cadmium Red canvas has an audacious single dot - not quite dead centre -
``to bring a tension,'' while a small, orange rectangle hangs near a purple and
violet residue painting which has, he says, ``a nice weight''.
The paintings may look geometric, pretend to be hard-edged, but all the edges
are drawn by hand, never by ruler. ``They are slightly squint; off the square.
There's still human frailty here!'' Pavel Buchler, who appointed Innes as
Creative Fellow at Glasgow School of Art to teach one day a week, told me:
``Innes shows there is no bottom line to painting; no end to what can be done
with paint. He's proved you can go beyond the monochrome.''
``I've tried to make the Turner pictures quite pacy,'' Innes explains. ``I want
a spatial feel. All the work is from 1995.'' He edits ruthlessly, leaving the
studio stacked with ``not-quite-good-enough'' paintings. ``Sometimes it takes
two months to realise it hasn't got the tension I want. If I'm not happy with
it, I scrap it.'' A pile of rejects bear witness to that.
One favourite olive ``rivulet'' oil hangs in his own house. ``They are so hard
to do. I don't want to part with it. It sounds ludicrous but I can only do the
olive ones in winter because crunchy beetles settle on them. The beetles won't
touch the orange and red canvases though! That's what comes of having a sort of
garden shed as a studio!''

TIM BURTON'S NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, retail, #14.99; also available to
rent; cert PG.
n.DO not do unto others as you would have them do unto you: they may not have
the same tastes. George Bernard Shaw sums up the moral of this rich and strange
fairy-tale, the best Christmas film since the 1947 Miracle On 34th Street and
the best animated film since Snow White.
Directed by Henry Selick but produced and scripted (and probably dreamed too,
Couch Potato reckons) by Tim Burton, Nightmare Before Christmas is a story of
good intentions gone wrong.
Jack Skellington, Pumpkin King of Hallowe'en Town, tires of the annual
Walpurgis revels and makes a takeover bid for Christmas, reasoning that Santa
Claus, whom he benignly kidnaps, will appreciate the holiday. But when the
children of the world are far less delighted than Jack expects to open their
presents and have snakes or disembodied heads pop out, Santa must be rescued
from Jack's crew of walking nightmares and sent off on his sleigh before
Christmas Night is over.
The visual style of the stop-motion animation reflects perfectly Jack's (and
Tim Burton's) ambivalent blend of mischief and goodwill. Both figures and
background have a garish funfair gaiety about them - especially Skellington's
henchmen Lock, Shock, and Barrel and the genuinely frightening bogeyman Oogie
Boogie. Even the sweetness provided by Jack's rag-doll girlfriend Sally is of
rather an eerie kind, and the single tune that composer Danny Elfman repeats
with variations has a menacing jauntiness.
In the (happy) end, though, the overall effect is of a playfully spooky kind of
innocence, and, although Couch Potato wouldn't show Nightmare to an easily
scared eight-year-old, most children will enjoy on a simple and harmless level.
It's us grown-ups who'll have nightmares.
A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (#10.99)/ HELP! (#10.99)/ THE MAKING OF A HARD DAY'S NIGHT,
all retail, #10.99/ #10.99/ #9.99
all cert PG.
n.A Hard Day's Night (1964, b&amp;w) can still make Beatles fans of a certain age
break down and cry. It's the boyish, soon-to-be-curdled energy and enthusiasm
of the Fabs themselves; the dazzling songs, composed at the peak of Lennon and
McCartney's high pop style; and perhaps most of all it's the girl in the
audience whom you can lip-read shouting George through tears and mascara.
Help! (1965) - marred by colour, a plot, and too much self-conscious wackiness
- has some wonderful moments too, but the bloom was already off the rose.
These re-issues acquire extra nostalgia value by including cinema trailers,
contemporary newsreel clips, and behind-the-scenes studio footage. Most of the
thirtieth-anniversary documentary The Making Of A Hard Day's Night, however,
was filmed too long after the fact to possess much Beatle glamour. Only the
inclusion of the You Can't Do That sequence, dumped on the cutting-room floor,
gives it any interest for anyone but Beatles obsessives (eg Couch Potato).

MY best climb came after the war when I was working for Ordnance Survey. A
party of four of us attempted six peaks in the Himalayas and climbed four. One
of the things I'll never forget is the sight of so many trade routes about
20,000ft up that were used by the Tibetans on their way to India.
The worst took place on a May night in 1970 when I went out with an outstanding
rock climber, Len Lovett, to a place near Glencoe. I was leading the climb and
all of a sudden I shot into space, skyrocketed over his head and fell 160ft. He
managed to get a rescue party and by 5am I was in Stirling Royal with a cracked
hip, squashed spine and broken ribs.

THE tourist buses for Iona twist along the Ross of Mull like boats on a short
Atlantic swell, rocking back and leaning forward over the switchbacks and blind
corners, yawing through narrow defiles and humpback bridges. The high rainy
grasslands of the hills are left behind; the sky grows flatter and lightens.
The eyes of the passengers are drawn to the west, following their thoughts,
looking for the first glimpse of grey rock beyond red, of white sand beyond
black seaweed, of Iona beyond the Mull.
Fifty years ago there was grass growing down the road's spine. The first time
George Macleod, who would have been 100 this year, came to Iona he birled down
the Ross in a pony and trap. In the nineteenth century, as for a millennium and
a half before, you straddled a Highland horse or you walked. After passing
along the Ross of Mull in 1799, Sarah Murray wrote: ``I am astonished how the
inhabitants of that quarter escape breaking their bones and necks, in
scrambling over that distance . . .''. No wonder that almost everyone who
travelled to Iona, or indeed on the west coast at all, travelled by sea. The
Ross then was effectively another island, settled on its sandy bays and grassy
glens but for the most part forbidding cliffs fronting unforgiving moor.
On the north coast of the peninsula, Loch Scridain offered shelter and fishing
to the iron age clans, the ancestors of the Macleans. They built their little
forts on the volcanic platforms that sit above the shore line and grazed their
stock in the rushy valleys. Every generation since then had walked as I did on
an early April morning through the cattle tracks of a slope of willow carr,
letting the warmth on the back of their hand link that spring with all the
springs before.
In the oxters of boulders and between the toes of trees the primroses were
growing. The woods had hardly a burr of green; the grass was sere and the
ditches full. But the bright acid yellow of the primroses gladdened the land.
What cultural baggage did the iron age farmers carry to the sight of the
flowers of spring? I could not begin to reach it, only its echo in poetry and
story. But I do not believe it was so different from my own: the cruel joy of
mere survival, the tingle of recognition reaching back into the arms of
childhood, the deep-breathed pause between work and work.
The difference? I was a visitor to the landscape which was life or death to
them. They had mixed their labour with it; I, only my thoughts. Well, the land
was big enough for both, I told the yowes on the heather knoll above the wood.
For in truth the pre-Columban Celts and I were alike, recent specks on a huge
and ancient land. Nearby, the fossil garden of Ardtun is folded under the
volcanic rock. There you can read that 60 million years ago Mull was as hot as
Florida and lotus and magnolia grew in clearings of redwoods. The great
outpourings of lava which reach their highest point on Ben More to the north
took place somewhere near the equator.
It seemed far enough away that evening when I walked round the rim of the
basalt platform that made the little peninsula of Rubha Dubh. A thrush flew
from the broken dyke of another holiday house and vanished in a fold of
gloaming. The sea was gently filling the empty slipway excavated from the loose
rocks at the head of a creek. I made my way round the sheep paths at the edge
of the cliffs and lay leaning over a geometric column where the water shifted
and broke directly below.
Looking back at me were a scatter of reptilian faces, glossy and dark with a
bright green eye and a forward curving crest. Others peered round the columns
further along, silhouetted against the westering light. As I watched, the last
two or three flew in from the sea, rising at the last to settled webbed feet on
an empty column cap. For these shags, it was still winter and their evening
roost not their nesting caves was where they went at dusk. They flew in from
their fishing grounds on the sealochs and headlands of west Mull, to gather for
safety where the lava had flowed and hardened and the sea had chipped and mined
a 60-foot cliff with flat ledges for sleeping and no access for predators from
below or above. These fishermen had been here for longer than men.
So had the grey seal which swam 100 yards off shore. It bottled from the water,
sitting at ease in the narrowing track of yellow light as if it was swinging on
the surface. A silver cow, she lazed and looked, on the other side of the year
from the hurly-burly of birth and mating. She would be pregnant with next
September's pup, though there are plenty who would wish it otherwise.
Grey seals are among Scotland's special fauna, one of the world's rarer seals
yet commonest in our waters, their numbers still rising since the last cull in
1978. She hung there alone on the skin of the ocean as I rose up from the damp
grassy skin of the land and we each took our histories away in the spring
evening.
In order to engage with the landscape of Scotland you must try to understand
its history and its natural history. There on the black headland, Rubha Dubh,
the history seemed too big to understand. The forts and fields of the iron age,
like the skerries of the grey seals and the roosting ledges of the shags, were
created by the slow and continuing ripping apart of Europe and America. The
evanescence of primroses is closer in scale to your own life. Think too much
about it and the Ross of Mull seems to buck beneath you as it does beneath the
tourists in their buses. And so it should.

n.Mixed emotions: despite the admiration and passion which clearly prompted the
book in the first place, Inglis appears to have ended up not really liking, or
even admiring, his subject, pictured above.
RAYMOND Williams brought class struggle into English classrooms. Not just by
talking socialism, but by acting out with his life a deep contradiction in the
heart of 1960s Cambridge. The son of a Welsh railwayman, he sought and found
the intellectual language through which he could express the culture of his own
class within the conditions of the dominant class, without being diminished or
absorbed by it.
In fact the term ``culture'' as we understand it today was largely clarified
and passed down to us by Williams. Culture not as artistic production, but as a
way of life held, lived and renewed in common; he brandished the idea of social
resistance as an act of creativity and union as great cultural forms. His books
Culture and Society and The Long Revolution set him at the centre of the
post-war British left making him, in Edward Thompson's words, ``our best man''.
His work on the media was instrumental in formulating the notion of
communications studies, and his analysis of the power of the press still stands
as the bottom level in timely reminders: ``Idealism you are allowed ..... but
truth about capitalism is forbidden ..... Once you know who owns the press, you
know what to expect of it.''
However, it is not only his thinking, but his presence and integrity as a
figure which make him important in the history of British socialist thought. In
1989, the year after his death, Terry Eagleton described the liberating impact,
and dignity, of Williams's Cambridge lectures: ``Through the medium of his
authority I felt somehow authorised to speak myself, and through me all those
relatives and friends who could never speak properly, who had never been given
the means to say what they meant, whom nobody ever bothered to ask what they
meant.''
His solitary strength was a mark not of individuality, but of the sustaining
power which emanated from a formative experience of Welsh working-class
solidarity and mutual support. So it is fitting that the best parts of Fred
Inglis's biography should not be about Williams himself but the family, class
and geographical background which formed him. And Inglis is excellent with
historical digression and sensuously alive detail.
But when it comes to the adult Williams, and his writing, it seems as if Inglis
has woken up to a biographer's nightmare. Despite all the admiration and
passion which clearly prompted the book in the first place, he appears to have
ended up not really liking, or even admiring, his subject. The book is lavished
with eulogies for Williams's achievements, but in an exaggerated or barbed way
which is sometimes sickening and suggests lack of conviction. The criticisms,
by contrast, ring consistently true.
In what seems like a laborious attempt at even-handedness there is a constant,
to-fro motion of praise and criticism which usually favours the latter.
For example, take Inglis's comment on Williams's novel, Border Country: ``I am
deeply attached to the book, but it has awful weaknesses.''
Or this truly weird form of damning with great praise: ``I love Manod; it's his
best book for me; I can't see its many faults.''
Or the straight annihilation of Williams's ``thick, at times downright dreary
prose'' in which Inglis interjects with an astonishing little exclamation of
his own in brackets: ``blah, drone.''
It should be admirable that a biographer be explicit about his opinions; the
illusion of neutrality usually disguises a whole range of covert ideological
operations. But Inglis splatters opinion about as if honesty were a nervous
tick.
And the ultimate irony is that he's not honest. This book claims to be an act
of reverence, but it strangely twists itself about to become a personal and
intellectual attack. The withdrawn character it residually leaves us with is an
isolated, rather dull egoist - bad with students, women and foreign countries.
It does Raymond Williams, and post-war socialism, no favours at all.

DENNIS Potter accomplished three genuinely remarkable things in his life. Two
of them were television serials - Pennies From Heaven and The Singing
Detective, dramas quite beyond compare. The third was a wonderful rage against
the television establishment. For a time, he alone was the creative conscience
of the industry.
These achievements are sufficient to establish a legendary place for Potter in
the hearts and minds of those (and there are many) who care about the craft of
screen writing, a talent which is too often given scant regard in the scheme of
things. But beyond them, you are struggling to identify anything else in his
career which, when compared to these immaculate standards, emerge as truly
great.
A substantial portion of this absolutely enthralling biography is set aside for
an appendix of Potter's creative output, a detailed description of his
journalism, his literary work, and his television and film scripts. He was most
certainly a prolific writer. The aforementioned television dramas, for which he
is probably best known, were nothing short of brilliant. Other work - like his
1965 BBC play, Stand Up, Nigel Barton; his controversial stage play Brimstone
And Treacle in 1977 (deemed too strong for television adaptation but eventually
turned into an unspectacular movie); and his peculiar, evocative, wartime TV
drama, Blue Remembered Hills, in 1979 - were quite outstanding.
Then we come to a body of work which was, in Potter terms, merely good. His
six-part BBC2 drama serial, Casanova, and his seven-part adaptation of The
Mayor of Casterbridge, again for BBC2. And finally, there is the average. His
screenplays for Nicolas Roeg's Track 29 and Michael Apted's Gorky Park; his
latter-day television dramas Lipstick On Your Collar, Christabel, and
Blackeyes. Of course, ``average'' for Mr Potter would amount to ``great'' for
most other writers.
W Stephen Gilbert, a novelist, critic, and journalist, has written an engaging
profile which is not only a frank and profound biography of Dennis Potter but
also a revealing history of television drama from the sixties to the present
day (so important was Potter to the medium that you really cannot do one
without the other). The author's achievement is all the more remarkable when
you consider that his subject's family gave little or no assistance to the
project.
It is something which, we learn early on in the book, Potter could never have
done himself. We are reminded that he once wrote: ``Autobiography is by far the
most boot-lickingly brutish of all the literary arts, especially when it
purports to wrestle with personal motive ..... I do not believe what writers
say about themselves, except when they think they are not saying it about
themselves.''
Nevertheless, Gilbert asks: ``What writer has laid himself quite so bare, quite
so unsparingly, quite so often as Dennis Potter? His work bursts with the
circumstances of his own life. He has confronted the most intimate of human
concerns to a degree that simply could not be contemplated unless they were
deeply felt, entirely personal. In his work he stands before us naked .....
more than naked; bleeding, his flesh flayed, his guts spilled.''
Potter's was not an easy life. Born to a working class family in a mining
community in the Forest of Dean, he was educated at Oxford and started out as a
journalist. Early on he discovered that he was suffering from psoriatic
arthropathy, a rare and progressive disease which was to perpetually haunt, not
only his personal life, but also his creative process.
He eventually found his metier in television drama. It was ``the true national
theatre.'' To him it was the only medium that really counted. ``It is the
biggest platform and you should fight and kick and bite your way on to it,'' he
said. The great thing about Potter was the fact that, once there, he continued
to fight and kick and bite.
Dennis Potter's torturous and premature demise reads like one of his scripts.
The writer, physically twisted by the effects of a lifelong ailment and wracked
with the pain of a terrible cancer, works frantically to complete two scripts
before he dies. A classic case of a man who suffered for his art. Whether this
final game was worth the candle has yet to be decided. The works, Cold Lazarus
and Karaoke have yet to be seen.
This book is a tribute to Potter, to his talent, his tenacity, and his glorious
failure to compromise. It should stand as an inspiration to any writer of any
medium.

PROPERTY values and, therefore, the discounts at which property company shares
trade in relation to their assets are nothing like as precise as the discounts
for investment trust shares. But a discount of around 25% for Scotland's
largest property company, Scottish Metropolitan, at a current share price of
around 70p, has attracted the interest of stockbroker Charles Stanley.
It notes that the company had a difficult time after moving into the South of
England four years ago, but says: ``The damage has been repaired and some 70%
of its portfolio is now in Scotland.'' And it believes that property
development in Scotland is now showing signs of recovery which, with the
discount, makes the shares ``look cheap''.
In its latest Stockmarket Independent newsletter, the firm comments that the
property sector of the market has under-performed by nearly 20% so far this
year and ``yields on average portfolios are now above bond yields. The gap, of
course, will be widened if the expected cut in interest rates materialises
after the Budget. A cut would also make a further downgrading of property
values less likely.''
That makes it feel there should be at least stability in the share prices of
major property companies and, although this is not a risk-free situation, ``a
bounce in property shares in the first quarter of 1996 is possible''.
It likes British Land, presently at 372p, saying it expects its net asset value
to rise from 421p to 465p a share, giving a prospective discount of around 20%.
Since the newsletter went to press, British Land has announced a #120m deal to
give it full ownership of the prestige Broadgate development in the City of
London. It also announced a one-for-six rights issue at 370p to bring in some
#225m to fund other purchases including seven Tesco superstores and three
retail parks.
Stockmarket Independent editor Alan Watson comments: ``This is not the cheapest
property share on the market but it is the most innovative and the Broadgate
deal looks brilliant. It is difficult to tell at the moment, but I would guess
that the discount will emerge at around the current level.''
MEPC, which reports full-year results on December 1, is predicted to see
earnings per share of 19.7p against 18.2p and the broker thinks the company
will maintain its dividend at 20p net to give a yield of 6.5%. Net asset value
``should emerge at 480p compared with 473p, a discount of 21%''.
Giving MEPC a buy rating, it says next year's earnings should provide ``modest
cover'' for the dividend.
Land Securities, as the biggest company in its field and the only one currently
in the FTSE-100 share index, ``will participate in any recovery in the sector''.
The November survey of fund managers carried out for stockbroker Merrill Lynch
indicates, however, that UK fund managers are still selling property assets.
The broker reported that the money men and women were also ``still wary'' of UK
shares generally and continuing to sell US shares. But it was optimistic about
gilt-edged securities.
The Merrill Lynch strategy team's November look at the FTSE-100 companies
comments that the world economy is weakening and leading indicators suggest
this trend is ``unlikely to reverse'' soon. But with inflation under control,
it says: ``We are probably seeing a growth pause rather than recession.'' On
that assumption, the team is ``reluctant to take big negative bets on
industrial companies that offer good value and are producing good news flow''.
It has added British Aerospace to its bull list, commenting that while the
company is unlikely to be helped by the weak world economy, it is seeing good
profit growth. Others it likes are TI and GKN.
While the world economy is weak and forecasts of dividend increases for the
market generally are slipping, the team sees more appeal in BAT Industries, the
tobacco and financial services giant, which is ``safe and cheap'' and where
analysts are upgrading their profit and dividend forecasts.
It considers financial companies as still attractive on high yield and rising
dividend considerations, and adds Royal Insurance to a bull list which already
includes Abbey National and Standard Chartered.
ICI is being taken off the buy list as the prices of basic materials slip. The
broker comments that the correlation of chemical prices with the price of ICI
shares seems loose, but it does not see anything to drive the price up at the
moment. This view on basic materials also leads it to put British Steel and
Arjo Wiggins Appleton on the            sell list.
Taking the stance that inflation is not only low but likely to remain so, the
broker says it is keeping low growth companies such as Unilever and Sainsbury
on the sell list. It notes that a lot of firms regarded as defensive have
performed well over the past few months because they are felt to have safe
profits.
But it adds: ``Many of them are low growth companies that are seeing pricing
pressure. Our belief is that inflation will remain low so there does not seem
to be much reason to suppose that they are about to be baled out of their
current position. Food producers and retailers, such as Unilever and Sainsbury,
fit the bill and although their share prices have been weak we still regard
them as strong strategy sells.''
Similar logic brings the broker to add Guinness to its sell list. The
specialist analyst following the company also rates it as a sell, although
Unilever and Sainsbury are given a hold rating by their analysts. Guinness
shares have a price-earnings rating above the general market level at the same
time as analysts are lowering their profit estimates for the company. Its price
is seen as too high in relation to Allied Domeq and Grand Metropolitan.
In contrast, the strategists keep Tate &amp; Lyle on their buy list as they feel
the company's price earnings rating is too low.

ON dark wintry mornings the thought of working from home can seem attractive.
And if the tax inspector can be persuaded to offer some incentives the idea
becomes even more appealing. This is no flight of fancy. More and more people
find themselves, whether through necessity or convenience, working from home.
Advances in computer technology have brought the reality of the self-contained
office within the reach of most of us. As a result many individuals are finding
they can work just as effectively from the comfort of their own home.
When it comes to claiming tax relief for home expenses, the self-employed
person is generally in a stronger position than an employee who works for
someone else. The self-employed need only show that their domestic expenses
have been incurred ``wholly and exclusively'' for the purpose of their
business. Employees, on the other hand, must also show that the expense is
``necessary'' for the performance of their duties.
Thus an employee who normally works at his or her employer's premises cannot
claim tax relief for maintaining an office at home. The same principle prevents
employees from claiming tax relief on their travelling expenses from home to
work, because their duties are deemed not to begin until they get to their
office or workplace. The home has to be the base of operations before tax
relief can be claimed.
However, this rule does not prevent employees such as sales representatives
claiming a deduction for expenses where they operate from home but continually
travel about in the performance of their duties.
Broadly, home workers fall into three categories:
q Those who work wholly or mainly at home.
q Those whose business is itinerant in nature with some administrative work
performed at home at the beginning and end of the day.
q Those who have their main base away from home but also work there for part of
the time.
Individuals in the first two categories should generally be able to claim their
travelling expenses in full from home on business journeys. They can also claim
a proportion of domestic costs - such as heating, lighting, insurance, repairs
and maintenace - relating to the accommodation used as an office or workshop.
Those in the third category may find their tax claim restricted to heat and
light used for the hours actually worked at home, and then only if they are
self-employed rather than employees.
A proportion of council tax can also be claimed as this is a property-based tax
similar to the old-style rates, whereas the community charge or poll tax was a
personal tax.
Establishing the precise amount of expenditure which can be claimed against tax
will involve negotiation with the tax inspector, but any fair and reasonable
method will normally be acceptable. For example, in a house which has five
rooms plus kitchen and bathroom, with one room used as an office, it would be
sensible to claim for a sixth of the relevant expenses (kitchen and bathroom
counting as one).
A word of warning: if a room is used exclusively for business purposes, the
capital gains tax exemption which applies on the sale of the family home could
be put at risk. Strictly, the tax inspector could assess that part of the gain
which relates to the business use - one sixth in the example given above. To
avoid this, it may be prudent to claim only 95% of the relevant costs. The
other 5% will represent the occasional use of the room for private purposes.
The self-employed should have no difficulty claiming tax relief for business
telephone calls made from home. It is also usual to claim part of the rental
charge proportionate to the business use, although this might be challenged by
the tax inspector on the basis that the rental is not incurred wholly and
exclusively for business use, since private calls are also made.
As anyone with a mortgage knows, the tax relief on mortgage interest has been
drastically cut, and is now restricted to 15% of the interest paid on a loan up
to #30,000. This represents a fairly paltry tax saving of #7 per week on a loan
of #30,000 where interest is payable at 8% a year.
Following a recent Inland Revenue concession, it is now possible for
self-employed people using part of their home exclusively for business to claim
mortgage interest relief on the part of the loan attributable to this use. This
will enable them to get tax relief at 25%, or even 40%, on part of the interest.
Thus someone with a loan of #50,000, using one-fifth of his or her house for
business purposes, could claim interest relief on #10,000 against business
income, in addition to MIRAS tax relief on #30,000.
Everyone agrees that simplification of our tax system is long overdue. Kenneth
Clarke could take a small but significant step in this direction if he
introduced a realistic scale of tax allowances for those who require to work at
home on a regular basis.
To prevent abuse, the allowance would only be given against income actually
derived from the home-based source. It is unlikely the loss of revenue to the
Exchequer would be significant and it would be offset by time saved at the tax
office examining expense claims and discussing them with taxpayers.
With the advent of self-assessment in just over a year this would make sense.
It could also encourage skilled workers who are tied to the home to find ways
of generating income from this base with added benefits for the community.

INVESTMENT managers spend their lives trying to out-pace each other in their
choice of shares, and while some have proved they can consistently out-perform,
for many others the struggle hardly seems worthwhile.
So, why bother to try and beat the market when you can achieve perfectly
respectable returns for investors simply by picking the same shares as the
stock market indices? Why indeed, particularly when, thanks to lower management
costs, the charges you have pay on these ``tracking funds'' are falling fast.
Legal &amp; General has abolished initial charges on its range of personal equity
plans. It reckons its Index Trust, which shadows the FT All-Share index, now
represents the cheapest tracking fund on the market.
L&amp;G's move follows the lead set by Virgin Direct with its Index Tracking Fund
and Gartmore which has also dropped the initial charge on its tracking funds.
HSBC, the biggest player in the tracker market, dropped the 4% charge on its
FTSE-100 index fund last year and now plans to scrap the 5.25% initial charge
on all its other index funds.
While cuts in initial charges help this type of fund get off to a better start,
the managers still make a yearly charge. At L&amp;G, for instance, it's 0.5% plus a
flat fee of #25. Annual charges and dealing costs mean the growth of tracker
funds typically lags about 1% a year behind the index they're shadowing.
Another point to bear in mind for risk-averse investors tempted by the idea of
their money going up (or down) in line with general movements in a particular
market is that not all funds slavishly follow the index they're tracking.
Some do, buying all the shares which make up the index - that's 900 in the case
of the FT All-Share - and in the same proportion. Others buy the same major
stocks, but then choose only a few of the smaller companies, taking the view
that there is more scope for making money out of actively dealing in smaller
company shares than the giant household names.
Another variation is to track the FTSE-100 index - affectionately known as the
Footsie - so concentrating on the 100 biggest companies which account for
around 75% of the stock market by value. But you don't have to confine your
attention to the UK market. HSBC has a wide range of funds tracking indicies in
continental Europe, Japan and the Far East for example.
Many tracker funds can also be wrapped in a personal equity plan or PEP so both
income and growth will be tax free.
It is only right that investors should benefit from lower charges on this type
of fund - after all, managers don't need very much skill simply to follow an
index. But there is also scope for cost cutting for those who prefer much more
active management of their investments.
Research by Edinburgh stockbroker Bell Lawrie White suggests thousands of
investors are now holding investments in PEPs with several different managers -
and paying too much in charges as a result. Consolidating your PEPs with just
one manager could well cut down on costs - and paperwork - as well as giving
you the chance to revise your holdings so they complement rather than duplicate
each other.
``Take the case of someone transferring #40,000 of PEP holdings to us,'' says
director Brian Johnstone. ``On our sliding scale of management fees investors
would pay 1% on the first #20,000 and 0.35% on the rest. That means a yearly
charge of #270 before VAT. That's a saving of #230 on the typical yearly PEP
management charge of 1.25%.''
It is important to check other costs before making a transfer. Many plan
managers slap on exit charges if you move your holdings out - or even insist
that you sell before transferring.
While unit trust and PEP charges have always been disclosed in percentage
terms, most investors probably have no idea what they amount to in hard cash -
but that is set to change. The unit trust regulatory watchdog, the Personal
Investment Authority, has proposed new rules which will force all unit trusts,
unit trust PEPs and investment trust savings schemes to set out their charges
in cash terms as well as percentages.
But, unlike the rules which came into force for life insurance companies at the
beginning of this year, unit trusts won't have to show how charges could affect
investments at different assumed growth rates.
``Unit trusts are very different from life insurance policies and can be much
more volatile,'' says Emma Weiss at the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds. ``Projections based on a particular growth rate give the
wrong impression that there will be a steady increase over time.''
Instead, investors will see an example of how charges will affect their
investment if there is no growth at all and if it doubles in value. The new
rules are expected to be finalised by January and come into force next summer.

FOR a second I felt a hint of the sense of achievement that working around the
home is supposed to inspire. When the bathroom cabinet fell, however, it all
dissolved in a flood of temper.
In our house last week the irresistible force (my reluctance to do any sort of
work outwith office hours) was fated to meet the immovable object (a pile of
cruddy jobs needing done). When these two collide, the first casualty is
usually my good humour.
Before the sixties swung along, people had working days and they had rest days.
On work days they worked, and on rest days they went to some form of religious
service, read The Sunday Post, ate a fried breakfast, and went on a day-trip to
justify a few beers in some hotel or other.
Maybe it was a side effect of mass unemployment, maybe it was the widespread
availability and affordability of electrically powered workmen's hardware, but
for whatever reason, it's become de rigeur to know one end of a jig-saw from
the other.
Guys whose idea of manual labour was filing a letter suddenly had to spend all
day Sunday insulating the loft before they could hold their head high in the
office on Monday. And worse, these people will waste an entire weekend
footering around, producing workmanship of which even the most cynical cowboy
would be ashamed.
``It's cheaper when you do it yourself,'' say the apologists. This is true, as
long as you consider your free time to be worthless (an hour's overtime would
pay for someone competent to produce the same result as your eight hours of
fumbling), and as long as you don't count the money spent on repairing the
cables you drill through.
There can be only one thing worse than actually wasting time performing DIY,
and that's having to listen to some boring git blabbing on about doing odd-jobs
round the house. I think there's more chance of a Rangers player getting a
European win bonus than there is of me engaging anyone in chat about Rawlplugs,
but my brother gets honorary membership of the DIY Bore's Club by virtue of the
fact he owns a drill.
I can't believe some guys actually get a sort of pleasure out of using noisy
electrical gadgets made by Black and Decker. Mostly this is the same type who
finds the inner workings of the Ford Escort interesting; the kind of bloke (the
word ``guy'' is never entirely appropriate) who can say ``twin cam'' with the
assured tone of one who knows what it actually means. Not so much a man's man
as a bore's bore.
IN the nineties, although it's definitely not on for a woman to be given a
piece of household equipment for birthdays or Christmas (and rightly so!), it's
still quite acceptable to give the average anorak-clad saddite a power drill
for his festive cheer. Sad Man is then as happy as a pig in a patrol car, and
while, come Christmas morning, Real Man is reading his copy of Playing for East
Fife - Number 93 (The Glory Years), Sad Man sits vacantly, dreaming of his
progression from boring other people to boring holes.
Why is there such a middle-class obsession about performing manual tasks around
the house? Maybe it works the other way too. I wonder if, for instance, joiners
get up on a Sunday morning desperate to get stuck into a bit of DIY Quantity
Surveying?
DIY should be banned for social and economic reasons (ie all the skilled
tradesmen should be saying ``Bloody estate agents! Going home, doing our
jobs!''), but there are other good reasons. I get in such a bad mood when faced
with any sort of household tool (Quiet up the back there!) that it tends to
provoke all sorts of profanities.
That's the thing about women - they want men to express themselves more, then
go in the huff when you tell the flatpack wardrobe exactly what you think of it
when it falls down. There should be particular bans on DIY in homes with
children, however. Surveys have shown (flannel alert!) that children learn more
swear words following an episode of paternal thumb-hammer interface than they
would get from a hundred viewings of American videos.
The break-up of the family unit is almost certainly due to the increasing
popularity of DIY. Sociologists will soon cotton on to the fact the divorce
rate is rising at exactly the same rate as the number of DIY superstores.
Habitual DIY is definitely a sign of an abnormal mind. You can almost hear the
neighbours now: ``Look, there's that nice Mr West working away in the garden
again. That Rosemary doesn't know how lucky she is.''

n.``THE punt gunner's bread and butter'' is how Peter Scott described the poor
wigeon between the wars. Despite being the quarry of wildfowlers for half a
century since, they are still bread and butter to birdwatchers and walkers on
the estuaries of Scotland in winter. In dense packs wigeon ride out the high
tide on the open sea, graze the cold wide mudflats or waddle through the grass
of seaside fields.
Every mudflat that can grow eelgrass will have its pack of wigeon by now,
though many move south as winter hardens. Each year too they are becoming more
common on inland fields and floods.
The other reason is that familiar birds can be seen with fresh eyes in
different contexts. Wigeon are exciting when they flight to feeding fields at
night, whistling from the dark side of the moonlit sky. Or in summer, a pair on
the rushy fringes of Loch Morlich allow time to study their delicate
proportions and the yellow pate, chestnut head and neck, grey lined flanks and
white splash on the forewings which make the drakes so handsome.
A few hundred breed in forest-edged upland lochs in Scotland, but the 40-50,000
which winter here are from more northern forests. In either place they are
susceptible to acidification of the water. It would be a great misfortune if
the numbers of wigeon did ever decrease - not least because the main food of
adults and chick on their breeding lochs is the ubiquitous midge.

SHE was eight years old when the comforts and stability of her little world
were shattered. By the time she had lived - or, more realistically, survived -
another eight years she had experienced being hounded as a Jew across her
native Poland, then rounded up and deported.
She had lived a life of utter deprivation in Siberia and Kazachstan, seen death
and despair, and at the end of the war had been shipped back to Krakow to
discover the meaning of the Holocaust. When she was 15 her parents sent her,
their only child, alone to start a new life in Britain.
They sent her away, their little sunshine, although it broke their hearts,
because there was no future for her in Poland and they felt it would be selfish
of them to keep her. ``Life is not fair, but we must try to be fair,'' they had
told her, and when she asked why, as she always did, they replied, as they
always did: ``Because we have to live with ourselves.''
It is a fearsome story that Janka Goldberger has told in an autobiography of
her amazing childhood. It is a story of those times which seems impossibly
remote 50 years on, but it carries a message for today's generation about the
meaning of hardship, about what it takes to survive. And it brings to life in
personal terms the experiences of the generation that we are now recalling with
the anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
In many ways the story is almost unbelievable. Reading the book, you can
understand why, at first, when she used to talk about the things that had
happened to her, she would find that people would give her an odd look and say:
``Oh, how interesting'' because, quite simply, they would think she was making
it up.
And yet her story: the ghastly transportations, the endless cold, the hunger,
the deaths - all this she describes as ``a picnic'' compared to the other story
she has told. This is the biographical account of her husband's wartime in
Warsaw, alone as a child of 13 after the capture of his parents and his brother
by the Germans. Having escaped because of his blonde hair, he found an uncle
and together with him, in the ghetto and the sewers, cheated death at every
turn.
It has taken her a long time to write these books, although she has rehearsed
them over and again in her head these past 50 years. Although she had always
wanted to write, she did not know if she wished to record these histories. It
was a famous publisher, Frederick Ullstein, who had been responsible for
publishing Kafka, who saw a draft of what she had written and told her that she
must persevere. ``You're a writer,'' he told her. ``You should write.'' She was
very excited.
But even so, her own story was one thing; that of her late husband, Egon
Weiner, who she had met on the boat to Britain, was truly terrible. Just as
others had not believed her account of her own experiences, she once had her
doubts about his. Was he not boasting? Could it really all be true? Could a Jew
dare to hide inside the Nazi headquarters?
Following his death in 1975 she pieced together the fragments and found it all
true and because he and the uncle were such remarkable and exceptional men she
felt she owed it to them to tell their story, too.
And there was another reason: she felt that by writing these books, retelling
the grim history of these horrors, she could show how even in the most hideous
circumstances, a child who is taught humane values at an early age can survive
hardship and become equipped to shape his or her own life.
Now here is the middle-aged lady; calm, dignified and still very handsome,
drinking coffee in one of London's smarter hotels and making light of much that
she went through, as, indeed, she manages to do in the books. She does not
diminish the stories but they are told, extraordinarily, through the eyes of
the young girl rather than through the refracted vision of a woman of wisdom
and knowledge. She is very matter-of-fact, but concedes that her approach was
shaped entirely by her parents.
``There have been other books written about the same subject - but quite
different because most of them tell a tale of woe. My story was partly funny:
it was not undiluted tragedy and there was even a glimmer of humour in what my
husband went through.
``If you are going to live through life and just cry, and say: `Poor little me!
How dreadful!' it isn't going to be worth it. We only have one life and might
as well make the best of it.''
She was taught by her parents always to consider herself lucky - even when they
sent her away to Britain, speaking not a word of English - and to be
optimistic. ``I can never think that anything bad is going to happen to me.''
The consequence is that when anything awful does happen, it comes as a
tremendous surprise, she explains, managing even to laugh as she does so.
As a mother and grandmother she knows that ``the package comes ready-made'',
but believes profoundly that it is still of huge importance for parents to
guide their children as she was guided by hers.
At the time of her earlier exile in the former Soviet Union, she felt then, as
she does now in her memory, that it was all an enormous adventure and greatly
exciting by comparison with the formality and organised routine of a wealthy
middle-class Jewish childhood in pre-war KraKow. Never could she have guessed
the adventures that were to lie ahead.
If her life had taken a more ordered path she had hoped to become a scientist.
She nearly fulfilled this ambition, even despite the upheavals of her youth,
after she arrived in London. She passed her matriculation within a year, having
quickly mastered the language, and to her delight was offered a place on a
psychology course at the University of London.
``All my life, since the time I was a little girl people have stopped me and
told me their problems, their life stories. I have the most extraordinary
experiences of people on trains asking me if they should get divorced or have
an affair.'' When she was offered this place, as an exceptional favour, she
cannot recall ever being happier. Her guardian did not see it like that.
``Perhaps you would like me to be a secretary!'' she remembers saying to him,
and him replying: ``Now, that's a good idea.'' She went to her room and decided
to jump from the window. The optimist and the humourist could not be quelled,
however. She looked before she leapt and the little courtyard below was full of
dustbins. After what she had already experienced she could not bear to die in
such circumstances, she decided.
Since then she has married, borne three children, lost her husband and had to
fight to raise and educate her family alone, and had several successful
business careers. Like everything else about Janka Goldberger it is a story of
survival. She remarried in 1980 and has now embarked, in her sixties, on
writing as her new career; another book is almost written and several more are
planned. ``I have always been reasonably capable,'' she says. It is a
considerable understatement.

SHE'S the Lady Godiva of the screen and glossy magazines and the most highly
paid leading lady in the world. However good an actress you want to argue Demi
Moore is or isn't, the cash register, for the moment, is The Body.
She's displayed it naked, pregnant, and painted on magazine covers, and
advertised it by squeezing into gowns splashing a cascade of cleavage which
must have the Wonderbra people in a tizz about their patent. If you want
someone to heave a bosom on screen there's no-one better.
In her film The Scarlet Letter which opens in Britain this month, she is coyly
dressed Hester Prynne with a demure lace cap, just about keeping the lid on her
passions in the disjointed and dismaying ``freely adapted'' version of
Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic tale of Puritan pride and prejudice. Of course,
the cap gets lost during her roll in the hay with Gary Oldman's Rev Arthur
Dimmesdale.
With Moore the star we could have anticipated an exceptionally horny Hester.
But, in one of the few links between the novel and flopmaster British director
Roland Joffe's movie, ``sin'' has a price. Pregnant, she is forced to wear a
scarlet ``A'' for adultery - yes, that ``A'' heaves on her chest - having upset
the strict social conventions of seventeenth-century New England.
Even Moore couldn't save the $50m pillage of Hawthorne which is a giggling mix
of piety and hysteria. But The Body still prospers. Although it is hard work.
Today Moore is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, filming her lead role in the movie
version of the great comic novel Striptease. Miami-based journalist Carl
Hiaasen's book is a wonder of words and set among the low life of the Atlantic
coastal communities. Moore's Erin is in a child custody battle with her
deranged husband (he steals hospital wheelchairs for profit in the geriatric
homes of the Americas) and needs cash. She strips. Rather wonderfully. Her best
friend in the film is played by Pandora Peaks who boasts or possibly regrets a
figure of 72HHH- 24-36.
The marvellous craziness of the novel and, hopefully the film, revolves around
the strip club so it's all tangles and tassles and, well, you know.
Moore's are impressive beneath a black satin blouse as she talks in the suite
of a rather nice hotel about her impressive, almost workaholic regime. As well
as The Scarlet Letter we will see her in the next months in Now and Then (which
she also produced), in The Juror with Alec Baldwin, as well as in the
much-anticipated Striptease.
But she's also been seen in a rather unflattering photograph - ``a bad snap''
according to her agents - of her jogging along a beach in her bikini. There are
stories that Striptease scenes had to be delayed until The Body was in perfect
shape for the camera. But cameras know more tricks than car salesmen and it is
difficult to imagine Demi Moore having trouble with her image.
``I certainly don't say `shoot my worst parts' when I'm filming,'' she says
with a flash of Beverly Hills hypnotising teeth. After you blink she goes on
about the bathtub sequence - Hawthorne didn't write it - in The Scarlet Letter
which is already on the Internet.
``We really needed to find a way of showing the body that reflected an
innocence and excitement and a sense of courage to go beyond the rules, to
break the rules and embrace oneself. So it needed to be shot in a way that you
could feel that kind of excitement and sweetness and thrill.
``Even though I was literally naked it was much more figurative about how naked
one feels to be looking at themselves for the first time.
``In the days of The Scarlet Letter you took a bath with a sheet over you. A
modesty sheet that they would actually place over the entire tub because it was
considered indiscreet to even look at yourself naked, let alone somebody else.
Today? I don't know. It goes on. It depends on the percentage of fear that
exists in our community because that's what it is really about.''
When she found international fame in the out-of-this-world fantasy romance
Ghost her image was white-T-shirt girl-next-door, with cropped hair, neat
smile, and big eyes on a fresh face, and not much evidence of hips or waist.
She was demure. And unthreatening. Without doubt she's now Wonderbra woman. And
intimidating.
Since she had fun playing with clay in the supernaturally successful Ghost,
she's flashed a sculpted and daily - three hours every day after the birth of
her children - exercised body on and off screen and in some sensational
photographs.
In today's Hollywood she's not just The Body but The Boss. And photographs of
her not looking in perfect shape have dismayed her quite extensive group of
advisers. ``Rotten picture,'' is the word and, for once, you feel obliged to
accept the Hollywood word. For this is an actress who has supervised the system
to be the success she is. She's the manipulator. Few stars have worked so hard
- and successfully - to present the image they want.
For Striptease she is being paid $12.5m and also has a share of the profits of
the movie which is going to be the one to beat at the box office in 1996. This
is a millennium moll.
This is not a surprise. As well as making public appearances snuggled into
outfits which emphasise all the right bits she has the look and attitude which
could set off fire alarms and certainly encourage loin alerts. This one-time
wide-eyed, innocent-looking Brat Packer is totally in control. She's also the
screen's queen predator.
She has an off-camera reputation for being ``assertive'' and going after
everything she wants with a passion. She admits she does not hold back. It won
her showy roles in A Few Good Men (as a tough Navy legal officer opposite Tom
Cruise and Jack Nicholson) and Indecent Proposal (as the wife Robert Redford
offers $1m to spend the night with).
It also helped her become Michael Douglas's tormentor in Disclosure, which was
the film adaptation of Michael Jurassic Park Crichton's controversial study of
sexual harassment in the workplace. She is Douglas's boss and wants him in the
office and in bed. In fact, she wants him anywhere. Her determination to get
her prey made T-Rex seem like a cuddly toy.
If you thought Michael Douglas had problems with Glenn Close in Fatal
Attraction that was before he became lust object of harridan harasser Moore.
The Royal Mounted Police should have appointed her their new mascot. This is a
lady who will always get her man.
``Don't you think I was perfect casting?'' she laughingly asks about her
Disclosure role.
In real life she did get her man but rather more romantically. Bruce Willis was
so overcome by her that he flew her to Las Vegas for a ``surprise'' wedding.
Half a dozen years and three children later they are one of Hollywood's few
stable power couples. They share the chores and the kids but have separate
film-production companies. In Hollywood, love is having his and her hit movies.
Moore can cope with fame and family but still wants more. ``I just want the end
result of things to be the highest quality they can be. I want good work. I
want things to be the best they can be. I want greatness.''
Well, you can't knock ambition. So far, she's had a good run of movies. Her
children, Rumer Glen, six, Scout La Rue, four, and Tallulah Belle, 20 months,
are given every consideration. She's proved it's possible to juggle motherhood,
a high-profile celebrity marriage, and superstardom.
Her daughter Rumer (after British novelist Rumer Godden, author of Black
Narcissus) was born, not in some trendy Hollywood hospital, but in the tiny
town of Paducah, Kentucky. Bruce Willis was on location there. He had arranged
with the movie's producers to have his pregnant wife with him on location and
the best facilities available for the birth - which he videotaped.
But even his superstar clout and negotiating talents pale against his wife's.
She has a reputation as relentless in getting what she wants. When she produced
the movie thriller Mortal Thoughts she cast Willis as the abusive
husband of a friend of her character's.
``I don't think we'll work together often but if something like that comes up
it's silly not to do it. Bruce really responded to the character - and it made
it easier for the family to be together,'' she said. And then in a remarkably
candid moment she talked a little about their set-up which, in Malibu, has been
blitzed by paparazzi, mud slides, and earthquakes:
``You know, I think we support each other. We always come and share our
experiences once the films are done. We come to each other's sets. One of the
more positive qualities and elements of our relationship is that we actually
keep our work very separate.
``Our time together is not about work. It's about having our family, and if
he's happy doing what he's doing I'm happy.
``I don't need to read his scripts. I don't need to tell him what to do and
vice versa. At the same time if he wants me to read something, if he cares for
my opinion, then I'd love to give it to him and I really think that has been a
saving grace. There's a lot of pressure to have a film succeed.
``I certainly don't need people criticising if we have chemistry on screen, so
I'd rather just keep Bruce and me separate from that for now. I assure you
there's enough chemistry at home. I'm very embracing, very maternal, and I
think I'm a grounding force, a centre that I provide for Bruce. But we have
created a tremendous foundation of a family. I have been through a lot of
things and come out of that as an example, a light of sorts - a light of
possibilities. Almost in the same way, there was an embracing and reassuring of
values that Bruce gave me that no-one had ever given me before.''
In California-speak she went on: ``Bruce made me feel important. That filled me
with strength to step forward with courage that, if I stepped a bit further, I
knew I wasn't going to fall. And if I fell it wasn't going to be quite as hard.
``It's very easy for me to see what I've got and where I've come from, but you
don't know. You don't know. I can be OK and know that I've got today but what's
going to happen next year, what's going to happen in the future? I don't like
to think too far in advance. Maybe I'm superstitious, afraid that what I've got
may go away.
``But I'm not cautious about what I'm doing. I plough ahead like there's no
tomorrow.''
Unhappily, tomorrow brings The Scarlet Letter but when you are a multi-million
dollar lady that's just a hiccup. For the unfortunate director Roland Joffe who
bombed with Fat Man and Little Boy and City of Joy there is a much larger
question mark over a career which is in expectation but not delivery.
Moore sees The Scarlet Letter and Striptease as linked: ``It's an interesting
point of view. We live in a puritanical society that fears the fact that you
might expose your body. And I wonder why this is. Why are we so afraid?
``Why do we judge the way you use your body? And why do we have a stereotypical
concept of what a woman is because she chooses to strip as a profession? I
might not want to do it but at the same time I feel it's providing me with an
opportunity to be more in touch with my own body.
``To understand how it makes me feel to move and to be free and not to be
repressed and shut down.''
But, remember, she does heave rather well.

THAT greatest of luxury liners, the Queen Mary, built at John Brown's of
Clydebank in the 1930s, still dominates the skyline of Long Beach, California,
where she has lain for more than quarter of a century as a major hotel and
tourist attraction.
Periodically there have been threats that, because of high operating costs,
this great monument to Clydeside workmanship might be sold off or scrapped
altogether, consigned to the oblivion which befell her sister-ship, the Queen
Elizabeth, mysteriously burned to death in Hong Kong harbour in 1972.
But the good news about the Queen Mary, as she approaches the diamond jubilee
of her maiden voyage in 1936, is that her operators have just been given a new
20-year lease, raising hopes that the ship is safe for the foreseeable future.
And to crown this major development, Prince Michael of Kent has given his royal
patronage to that operating body, the RMS Foundation.
At a private dinner in London, Prince Michael told me of his pleasure in
accepting the role of patron, which confirms the interest he has been taking in
the Queen Mary in recent times. His visits to the ship have included the
celebration to mark the 60th anniversary of that day in 1934 when the Mary was
launched at Clydebank.
``I was delighted to see that she is still maintained to the high standards
which greeted my grandparents on that launching day,'' he said.
The occasion of Prince Michael's London dinner was to launch the 1996
celebrations that will mark the diamond jubilee of the maiden voyage. That
voyage began at Southampton on May 27, 1936, when the greatest luxury liner the
world had ever seen set sail for New York.
As the rich and famous clamoured to secure first-class suites, the lucky ones
included President Kennedy's mother, Rose, actress Frances Day, and designer
and photographer Cecil Beaton.
As Henry Hall's orchestra played for dancers, the music could be heard in both
Britain and the United States, one of the early broadcasts which linked the two
countries.
Well, the Queen Mary doesn't sail any more but, in her diamond jubilee year,
her non-profit-making operators are offering 1996 packages which include
accommodation in first-class staterooms, big-band dancing, elegant meals in the
Sir Winston and Chelsea restaurants, and the champagne Sunday brunch which is a
regular feature of the Queen Mary's existence as a hotel.
There are events throughout the jubilee year, including a Scottish festival,
Fourth of July celebrations, fireworks every Saturday night, a festival of
light, and a Hogmanay finale to round off 1996.
Back in Britain, Clydebank will have its own celebration while Southampton,
where many of the Queen Mary's former crew members still gather, will have
exhibitions and a gala dinner.
A feature of the diamond jubilee will be the showing of a cine-film only
recently unearthed from the archives, in which a bank manager from Rotherham in
Yorkshire, Charles Chislett, took some intriguing pictures of the maiden voyage.
The Queen Mary was on her sixth round trip in August 1936 when she captured the
Blue Riband for the fastest-ever crossing of the North Atlantic. In 1937 the
honour was regained by the French liner Normandie. But a year later the Mary
won it again - and held the record for the next 14 years.
With the arrival of transatlantic jets in the 1950s and 1960s, luxury liners
were running out of fashion as the fastest way to America. The Queen Elizabeth
was sold off to Hong Kong owners and the Queen Mary was bought by the city of
Long Beach for the purpose it still fulfils.
It stood adjacent to the distinctive dome which was built to house the
much-publicised Spruce Goose flying-boat, belonging to the legendary Howard
Hughes. The Goose moved away but the dome has been used by Hollywood for films
like Batman Forever (1995) and is now to become an entertainment venue.
The new-found confidence in the future of the Queen Mary is fortified by the
fact that Long Beach has a $650m seafront project which includes a $100m
aquarium of the Pacific.
This renewed activity in Long Beach, a city the size of Edinburgh, has revived
memories of another age, when it was a centre of film-making before Hollywood
became the favoured location. People like W C Fields, Buster Keaton, and Fatty
Arbuckle lived there and visitors could watch those early movies being shot
around the city.
The great W C Fields could regularly be seen driving along Ocean Boulevard to
and from his home, now known as Weathering Heights and still visible from the
palm-lined boulevard.
Back at the Queen Mary, the boss of RMS Foundation, Joseph Prevratil, has
promised further restoration of the ship, which still looks remarkably like the
great lady which left Clydebank in the 1930s.
That brings the welcome news that the famous Verandah Grill, which had gone
down market as a fast-food area for the million people who visit her annually,
is to be restored as an elegant venue for banquets and receptions.
The ship is now on America's Register of Historic Places and her prospects for
an extended life are enhanced by the interest being shown by the British royal
family.
By coincidence, the new patron was born on American Independence Day of 1942,
just a few weeks before his father, the Duke of Kent, was killed while flying
on war service. President Roosevelt became one of his godfathers, which
explains his name of Michael George Charles Franklin.
As the patron of the Queen Mary's future, Prince Michael is showing the same
kind of enthusiasm for Scotland's greatest ship as was shown by his grandmother
when she came to Clydebank in 1934 and revealed the secret which had been
remarkably well kept: that Ship No 534 would, in fact, take the name of the
lady herself - Queen Mary.

EVERY dog must have its day. Even Heathcliffe my wife Ann's Yorkshire terrier.
Heathcliff and I enjoy a relationship based entirely upon mutual distrust. I
know that the moment my back is turned he will be up to no good. He knows that
the moment Ann's bank is turned that I will give him a less than
dog-user-friendly pat in payment. We exist together in an uneasy state of armed
neutrality, constantly on the alert for angst.
Heathcliff goes everywhere with his mistress; up mountains, dinner parties,
shopping, over soggy moors, bed, concerts, beach walks, holiday, the library,
fishing expeditions, business meetings and, on one unforgettable occasion, a
wild, uncontrolled terrier race at a game fair. In the car, the brute travels
in style, draped muffler-like round Ann's neck, his beady black eyes scanning
the horizon in search of trouble.
Ann's strict rule, when Heathcliff was a lad, was that he must always be kept
on the lead out of doors, even although we lived in a remote area of the north
of Scotland. The need to do so became apparent after his first, and only,
encounter with a sheep on the shores of Loch Treigh near Fort William. I had
spent an hour, screaming over the hill, yelling Cathy-like, ``Heathcliff,
Heathcliff!'' before I found him.
A tup had trapped the dog in a tiny cove. Heathcliff, who detests water, was
soaking wet and yapping plaintively; perched on a bare, wave-lashed rock, a
yard from the bank, faced by a hissing, angry, monster which would not go away.
I recovered the poor beast and, after a ``pat'', bore him back to his
distressed owner. Ever since, when sheep appear Heathcliff disappears, whether
he is on the lead                or not.
However, and grudgingly, I have to admit that Heathcliff is one of the most
competent hill walkers I know, and one of the fittest. His sense of direction
is unerring, his stamina endless. Fifteen miles round Beinn an Eoin (855m),
Poca Buidhe, Loch nan Cabar and Baosbheinn (875m) in the Flowerdale Forest,
south from Loch Maree, is, to him, just a warm up stroll.
Even at the age of 11 the prospect of a scamper up Ben More Assynt (998m)
brought a sparkle to his eye. His brown, hairy face, slashed by tightly
gritted, white teeth, twisted into a hideous grin of anticipation. At the end
of the day, in the glen of the Traligill Burn, he caught the scent of a rabbit
and was off like a shot in hot pursuit; bursting for action, fresh as new-baked
bread.
Which is why there is never any problem about birthday presents. Ann insists
her little darling's birthday should include a decent walk. Before the
statutory, candled, cake. A once-a-year treat, properly served, with
Heathcliff, feet on the table, napkin round his neck, munching happily. The
damn brute knows, too, almost to the minute, when the event is to take place;
and, at least on that day, that he is pretty safe from my tender love and care.
This year, on his birthday, we took Heathcliff on one of our favourite walks,
between Bettyhill and the mouth of the River Borgie in North Sutherland. The
walk combines the best of both worlds, including a mile or so along a
wonderful, deserted beach, as well as a happy scramble over heather-topped
Lewisian gneiss. Something for everyone: wild flowers and geological formations
for Ann, a wide variety of bird life and prehistoric monuments for me, rabbits,
hares and the chance of a roll in a dead seagull for Heathcliff.

JACQUI BURKE - fashion designer
I ACTUALLY bought two brilliant pieces of clothing from this antique and period
costume shop in the Kings Road, London. The first was a padded black biker's
jacket with PVC sleeves - one yellow and the other red. The jacket itself is
really well made with the original mod lining of black and white circles. The
other thing that I bought there and I like to wear with the jacket is an
original black 1950s basque. It's made of real whalebone and is better than
anything that I've ever worn before. It's definitely more comfortable than the
plastic boned basques you get that dig into your skin. This fifties model
actually holds me in and gives me an hourglass figure.

THE day will probably start with a plate of cornflakes or honey nut loops and
that's me. A cup of tea at the office and that's it until lunchtime when I eat
with the players. Lunch is soup and pasta with a bolognese or a cream sauce,
cooked in the Walfrid Restaurant up the stairs at Celtic Park. There's fruit
afterwards and that's it until half past six when I'll have something at home,
perhaps, fish, potatoes and peas, or more pasta, or steak. I don't linger over
food but I might have tea and a wee biscuit if I'm hungry between meals.
I've always been fortunate enough not to put on a great deal of weight - and I
still train with the players. I don't overeat except perhaps sometimes on a
Sunday when we go out for lunch.
I can cook, not a big fancy meal, but a nice cheese and ham omelette, beans on
toast, or whatever's from Marks and Spencer. If that's cooking, I can heat it
up. I could end up being taken to a lot of restaurants through my work - but I
don't do it.
As a kid I liked mince and potatoes, and still do. And I love home-made soup -
my wife makes a fabulous minestrone. There's nothing I like more than a nice
cup of tea. My favourite dish is lasagne, although if I'm hungry I can eat
almost anything, including a McDonald's. There are very few things I would turn
my nose up at.

THE PENGUIN BOOK OF SCOTTISH FOLKTALES
Edited by Neil Philip
Penguin, #8.99
SCOTTISH fiction springs from a tradition where stories were told to entertain.
This oral tradition is based on a familiarity, which, when transferred to the
page, allows the writer to take the reader into strange and exciting worlds
which would otherwise be inaccessible.
It is the tradition whose influence is often overlooked but which becomes
obvious when we consider the importance, power and role of the first person
narrator in Scottish writing. It appears in many guises and there are few
Scottish fictions from any period where the reader is not aware of being told
the story.
The engine that drives it all is the voice. This is one of Scottish fiction's
most appealing and mystifying aspects, something which has obviously helped its
survival, which inspires much of its uniqueness and which is a direct and
irrefutable statement of national identity.
It has been a necessary component of Scottish fiction from the beginning and
has to do with rhythm, speech, class, dialect and position. It is one of the
few devices open to a writer which fulfils more than one function
simultaneously and is often the first decision a writer makes. It is missing
from many stories in this collection.
The folktale is one of Scotland's richest literary legacies. In his
introduction, Neil Philip remarks that there are two distinct story-telling
traditions, Gaelic and Lowland Scots. The Gaelic tradition has many affinities
with Irish story-telling, where the narrator has an honoured place in the
community and convoluted plots are related in heightened language. Lowland
tales are sparser and the language is more direct: and while there has been a
conscious effort to preserve the Gaelic stories, the Lowland tales appear to
have been saved almost at random.
In an essay on Jeannie Robertson as a story-teller, Hamish Henderson remarks
that prior to the School of Scottish Studies being founded at Edinburgh
University, remarkably few Scots tales had been recorded. Robert Chambers'
Popular Rhymes of Scotland were practically the only specimens. Peter Buchan's
Ancient Scottish Tales are somewhat wooden Anglicised recensions he says.
It is the most obvious feature of this new collection. Many texts have been
weeded of the voice, therefore lack distinction and sound the same. The Gaelic
stories have obviously been translated, and it is only when we come upon
transcriptions of spoken Lowland tales that we find recognisable voices
fulfilling their distinctive function. Our appreciation of Lowland Storytelling
has recently been transformed, says Neil Philip, ``by the revelation of a
vigorous living narrative tradition among Scottish travellers''. These voices
give the stories distinction.
There are more than 100 tales gathered here; many, like Red Etin and The Well
at the World's End, are very familiar, others not so well known. Philip has
searched widely and selected well, gathering the stories in headings such as
Wonder Tales of the Lowlands, Tales of the Supernatural and so on.
Betsy Whyte's wonderful story The Man in the Boat is not published here for the
first time. A version recorded by Alan Bruford is in The Devil and the Giro, an
even a cursory comparison shows what a wonderful story-teller she was,
obviously altering the dynamics and pace of the narrative to suit her audience.
By implication, it also shows what we have lost in the stories whose collectors
were blinded by narrative and considered the tellers art unimportant, or maybe
like folksong, thought it ``as natural as birdsong''.

Catherine Brown wends her way through a maze
of dried fruits
A QUICK recce round a large wholefood shop, an oriental deli, the local
supermarket, and our up-market neighbourhood grocer, and I have a haul of dried
and candied fruit, and nuts, which is taking some sorting out -
value-for-money-wise.
Why pay over the odds now for Australian Muscatel raisins (with pips) when
there are jumbo South African ones (without) which are just as good at almost a
quarter of the price? Or Lexia raisins, which are scarce this year, so the
price has shot up.
Was there any point in paying extra for organic? And what about bulk buying?
There is a risk, of course, but also a huge saving at the oriental grocers.
Whole almonds: unit price per kilo #5.99 v #11.50 in the supermarket.
But first, to sort out the eating from the cooking; the nuts and dried fruits
with the best flavours which need nothing added and nothing taken away.
I am advised, in large lettering, on this 100g supermarket packet of (Sundora)
dried apricots that they are ``ready to eat''. Spectacles go on to investigate
the smaller - and almost unreadable - lettering, which reveals that one of the
ingredients is water. But I thought they were dried. Apparently not. The
manufacturer has very kindly soaked them in water for me.
Besides water, I also have the benefit of citric acid, malic acid, sugar, and
preservative E220. At a unit price of #7.80 a kilo, these ``dried'' apricots
have cost more than a kilo of lamb chops!
I need a calculator now to work out the extra cost of these organic whole
almonds from Italy, compared with the kilo I've bought in the oriental deli,
and discover the organic cost is almost double (#5.99 v #10). The cheapo
oriental deli and the expensive Italian organic are blind-tasted by some
nut-fanciers who come back with the verdict that the organic nuts are the best
they've ever tasted.
This packet of dried fruit for eating from a large wholefood shop is described
as ``sun-dried African pineapple''. Ingredients: pineapple. It is dried fruit
at its simplest and least processed which is most commonly found in wholefood
and specialist food shops.
During the drying process, fruit loses its natural colour and turns varying
degrees of dark brown. To preserve the natural colour, and to lengthen the
shelf life, many are treated before drying with sulphur dioxide to prevent
browning. Also with a dressing of vegetable oil or glucose syrup to prevent
them ``sugaring'' (developing sugar crystals) and sticking together. Both
processes change the natural flavour of the fruit. Some children may also be
allergic to sulphur.
While wholefood and specialist food shops are the places to find the widest
range of dried fruits, candied peels, and nuts. Some also have a policy of
packaging themselves, and passing on the savings to their customers which
should mean cheaper prices generally.
At Real Foods in Edinburgh, they also have a policy of reducing the price of
Christmas dried fruits and nuts by about 15% because of increased turnover at
this time of the year. They also claim to have a sleuthing service which will
track down any request from a customer.
Stuart Jackson, buyer for the shop, has just discovered a source of excellent
South African dried pears and peaches which had been requested by a customer.
Thanks to other requests, and their own searching out of new lines, they now
have Italian candied citron caps, undyed black and gold cherries, dried
blueberries and cranberries, Californian desert dates and Black Mission figs,
in addition to a large range of organic dried fruits and nuts.
What they do not have, however, is Arabic dried fruit ``leathers'' which have
been made with pureed dried fruit and pressed out into thin-as-leather sheets
and folded into neat, colourful parcels with cellophane between the layers to
prevent them sticking.
At Reza, the Iranian food emporium in London's Kensington High Street, there is
a deeply orange-coloured apricot leather (known as amardine), another is a dark
burgundy-coloured plum leather, and there are others made with crimson
barberries and dark red mixed fruits.
Soft enough to chew like fudge, fruit leathers can be cut into diamond or
square shapes and eaten as a delicacy with seeds, nuts, cheese, or apples. Cut
into strips, they can be added to stewed fruit to make a rich tangy sauce;
shaped with fancy cutters, they make a decoration on cakes and puddings; warmed
slightly in a pan, they can be used as a sticky glue on rich fruit cakes to
help ``fix'' the marzipan.
Jackson has never heard of fruit leathers, but he will investigate. Watch these
shelves.

n IN FOOD shopping terms, the next four weeks are the resplendent climax of the
year. Imports of figs, dates and nuts from the Near East have started arriving
in large quantities, while the citrus season is already in full swing.
This is also the time of year to consider buying a half or whole cheese for the
centre of the festive table and as a useful standby.
``A half Colston Basset Stilton,'' says cheesemonger Iain Mellis, ``is around
#35 for 8 -9 lb, (normally #5.12 a lb). ``A goats' milk half Harbourn Blue from
Devon is #25 for 3 lbs, while a half Dunsyre Blue from Lanarkshire is #21 for 3
lbs.''
Mellis also stocks a range of minature territorial cheeses which are smaller (2
1/2 lb) including Keen's cheddar, award-winning Mrs Kirkham's Lancashire, and
Mrs Appleby's Cheshire.

Lesley Duncan weaves the tale
of a family firm
which is still
clothing the gentry
THREE life-size marble goats disport themselves in the restaurant courtyard at
Johnstons of Elgin. They are cashmere goats, given to the woollen firm in 1993
by a Chinese supplier ``as recognition of more than 140 years' experience of
Chinese cashmere at Newmill''. The animals come with a Chinese proverb: ``Lucky
goats with events as wished.''
The goats themselves bear this out, for though badly damaged in transit they
have been seamlessly repaired. However, they could also serve as the wider
motto for this flourishing company which has been manufacturing top-quality
cloths at its Elgin base for almost two centuries. The firm, Elgin's biggest
and oldest employer, will celebrate its bicentenary in 1997.
The story of Johnstons represents in many ways the story of Scottish
manufacturing processes in the industry over the same period - of the constant
need to adapt to new machinery, processes, raw materials, and changing consumer
demands and expectations. That Johnstons has survived when so many firms have
not is testimony to shrewd management by succeeding generations of owners,
first the original Johnstons family and then the Harrison family since 1920.
Now Johnstons have produced something quite unwoolly. It's a book called
Scottish Estate Tweeds. Its author E P Harrison is a former chairman and
managing director of the company.
Scotland and tartan may be synonymous but another form of patterned cloth, less
spectacular and showy, is also native to Scotland. Estate tweeds are defined as
checks or designs ``which must belong to a particular estate and must have been
used to clothe the owners and their staff''.  Their origins can be traced to
the aftermath of the '45 Uprising, the Clearances, and the introduction of
Cheviot sheep to the Highlands. Because of economic change and fecklessness of
many of the chiefs, estates were sold in the early nineteenth century or rented
out for grouse shooting, deer stalking, and fishing. Sir Walter Scott - by
making the Highlands a focus of romance - and Queen Victoria - by taking up
summer residence on Deeside - influenced the new sporting focus.
The Sobieski Stuarts added their Jacobite imprimatur to clan costumes and deer
stalking. Landseer immortalised the stag at bay. Roads and railways also helped
popularise field sports in the north. The dispossessed clansmen of an earlier
generation were transmogrified into ghillies. And they needed clad.
When the foundation stone of Balmoral Castle was laid in 1853, Prince Albert
promptly designed the Balmoral tweed for use by all stalkers and ghillies on
the estate.
One of the first true estate tweeds, it is today a very dark blue design with
white sprinkled with crimson. The overall appearance is grey, imitating the
granite of the Aberdeenshire hills round Balmoral. Thus it provides ideal
camouflage for sporting activities. Johnstons' records show that ``Super
Balmoral Tweed'' was woven on July 13, 1853, though there is no note of the
original colouring. Prince Albert also designed a Balmoral tartan, but which
came first is not known.
Balmoral Tweed and 184 other patterns are beautifully reproduced in E P
Harrison's book. Each has a little history attached, the result of painstaking
research, either by  Harrison or by his late father E S Harrison, who in 1968
wrote an earlier study of Scottish district checks.
The Lovat Mixture - a soft green - has a longer entry. It was one of the
earliest instances of protective colouring and was first woven in Johnstons'
mills in 1845. Apparently the wartime hero Lord Lovat told how, when he was a
small boy, he heard that the idea of the colour came to his grandfather as he
looked across from the south side of Loch Morar.
His grandfather pointed out to his grandmother how the contrasting colours of
the primroses and bluebells - then in full bloom on the far side of the loch -
blended in with the hill, the white sands of the loch shore, the bracken, and
the birch trees. From that idea came the celebrated tweed with its invisibility
on the hill.
The entries also represent a history of the ever-changing land ownership in the
Highlands. Take Glenample, for example. The estate on Loch Earn was bought in
1992 by Senor Raphael Cruz Conde from Mr D Abbot, who in turn bought it from
the Stirlings of Keir in 1988. The tweed, a diagonal-effect cloth of yellowy
grey with bright lines of blue and orange through it on warp and weft, was
designed by Senor Conde with Haggarts of Aberfeldy and introduced as recently
as last year.
Though its earliest examples go back 150 years, Johnstons of Elgin had no
monopoly of estate tweed manufacturing and this book acknowledges other makers
such as Haggarts of Aberfeldy, Hunters of Brora, the Islay Woollen Mill, and
Campbells of Beauly. Estate tweeds are still manufactured for local clients at
Elgin, but Johnstons now largely concentrates on finer fibres. The estate
tweeds remain, however, the basis of inspiration for lighter-weight tweed
jackets for the general public.
High quality scarves, plain and patterned, cashmere accessories, clothing, and
tartans are major products. The raw material for Johnstons' Borders knitwear
factory is also prepared in Elgin.
The transformation of great bales of unwashed cashmere, merino, and lambswool
through a variety of ingenious processes and dyeing, to the fine material of
cloth or knitwear is in its way as impressive as the final products.
Much of Johnstons' output is exported to the Continent (Italy and Germany in
particular), Japan and the Far East, and America. The company won the Queen's
Award for Exports last year.

MARILYN MONROE: Her Life in
Her Own Words
George Barris
Headline, #17.99
n HERE is Marilyn Monroe's own, never before published account of her life,
accompanied by the photographs of photojournalist George Barris who spent six
weeks in the summer of 1962 photographing Marilyn at a beach house in Santa
Monica.
During the days and nights of these weeks Barris captured her every mood and
almost every move, as she unfolded her life story to him.
The book contains more than a hundred pictures in colour and black and white,
taken on the beach and in the seclusion of the timber house. They show Marilyn
at work, making-up, at play, dressing, eating, drinking, and cavorting in the
sand - some are obviously posed, others are quite candid.
Many of the images included have never previously appeared in print, and allied
to Monroe's own words they become a touching and revealing, if not always
flattering, insight into the private world of this movie legend.
The book also contains a list of people who featured in the star's life and the
categories into which they fell, ranging from ``close friend and confidante''
referring to a movie director/photographer, to ``heartbreaker and user''
reserved for one politician and one Attorney General.
Marilyn telephoned Barris only 24 hours before her death. He believes she did
not die by her own hand, but was in fact murdered.

THE THOUGHT GANG, Tibor Fischer, Minerva, #6.99.
NOT since J P Donleavy's The Ginger Man and Derek Raymond's The Crust on its
Uppers - both of early-1960s vintage - has a funnier, racier, or more
intelligent lowlife novel of the monologue kind been written then Tibor
Fischer's second. Starring Eddie Coffin, a hard-drinking former philosophy
lecturer driven by tough luck and embezzlement into a career of crashing French
banks with a one-armed robber called Hubert, this exhilarating philosophical
thriller is simultaneously realistic and fantastical, accessible and arcane,
simple and profound.
Imagine the younger Martin Amis in collaboration with Quentin Tarantino and
you'll have some idea of the flavour of this crackerjack book.
A HARD DAY'S WRITE: The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song, Steve Turner,
Carlton, #12.99.
THE Beatles have inspired many more books (most of them very bad) than they
ever recorded songs (most of them very good). Steve Turner's diligent collation
of folklore and gossip, though often trite - what can the Higher Criticism say
about Hold Me Tight or Baby's In Black? - contains enough nuggets of insight
and background information to put it on the right side of the Beatle-book
divide.
From Love Me Do to Let It Be, it's all here, handsomely printed and lavishly
illustrated (if not all that well written).
WOODY ALLEN ON WOODY ALLEN, Stig Bjrkman (interviewer), Faber, #8.99)
STRUCTURED as 24 separate interviews focusing on all Woody Allen's films as
director from Take The Money And Run (1969) to Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993),
plus Herbert Ross's Play It Again, Sam (1972) - which makes 24 films - this is
a great book for committed Allen fans, but might be a little too fond for more
selective movie buffs.
Although Allen proves a great interviewee (funny, self-critical, always willing
to talk about detail, technique, and ideas), too many of Bjrkman's questions
can be reduced to Woody, tell me how and why you're so brilliant.
UNSENT LETTERS, Malcolm Bradbury, Penguin, #6.99.
AS a major-league academic (Professor of English Literature at East Anglia)
and as a successful novelist, Malcolm Bradbury gets many letters. Broadly
speaking, they fall into the categories of Can you get me a job?, Can you get
my novel published?, and Would you like to write my thesis for me?
The conceit of this genially acerbic collection of essays and disguised
autobiography is that it is couched as replies to suchlike inquirers, and the
result is a treat of literary drollery.
THE JIM THOMPSON OMNIBUS, Picador, #7.99.
IF Jim Thompson didn't invent the roman noir (as with the works of
Shakespeare, there are many claimants), this collection of four of his most
genre-perfect lowlife novels, all of them filmed, proves that he perfected it.
The Getaway, The Killer Inside Me, and The Grifters, boil the post-war American
malaise down to the hard brass tacks of money, sex, and power, while never
rejecting (Thompson was a solid socialist and a victim of the McCarthy
insanity) the possibility of redemption. Call him the Camus of crime.

Looking for ways to beat the winter blast?
John Davidson tells how to really chill out
LET'S get practical. Want to beat the icy blasts and rainy downpours of the
Christmas shopping season? Just p-p-p-pick up a Puffa. You can choose the
authentic thing of course: a brand-name Puffa jacket. And very good value it is
too. But perhaps you'll opt for one of the many lookalike (and act-alike)
versions available this winter from fashion names both great and lowly.
Like an invasion from outer space, the Puffa has landed. Here is a light-weight
and weatherproof garment which fuses fashion and practicality. It's sporty,
it's serviceable, and it looks pretty good too. Of course anything quilted or
padded inevitably adds a great deal of bulk. But would you not happily trade a
temporary loss of figure for guaranteed warmth and dryness?
Designers are in on this act. Designers, that is, like Donna Karan, whose DKNY
collection includes the perfect warm, weather-proof jacket to cheat the
sub-zero temperatures of a New York winter. Thanks to Moschino, others can
dismiss winter's chill with a good-hearted shrug of a shoulder clad in dayglo
green quilted nylon.
Fashion, quite literally from the laboratory? Yes; by using high technology
performance fabrics, that's what Issey Miyake, the iconoclastic Japanese
designer, offers in his Windcoat collection. The finished garments cover just
about all that you could ever ask of a weather-coat or jacket. All, that is,
except a bargain price.
But familiar High Street names are equally keen to insulate their customers
against the bitterest elements. And every store has an area devoted to
variations on the quilt theme, with jackets and gilets usually well under #100
- sometimes under #50. So why not join this winter's invasion of the
body-snatchers? Better to be a quilted roly-poly than a shivering skeleton.
Just chill out, girl.

TREVOR SORBIE, the man responsible for creating catwalk hairdo ``The Frizz'', a
pompadour of enraged and artificial static, has supplied us with tips for
looking after tresses this cold season. He says: ``Use a mild shampoo so as not
to strip the hair of essential oils. (That's natural oils, not Neroli or
Eucalyptus.) Massage the scalp to encourage blood circulation and hair growth.
(Your man can do this for you). Gently pat hair to remove moisture, apply
conditioner and comb through hair ensuring that the whole shaft is covered,
from roots to ends.'' (Yawn.)
He continues: ``Blow dry hair using a nozzle and a round, large, bristle
brush.'' (Snore). Hold the dryer, so hot air is blowing down the hair shaft,
and dry hair from roots down. (Big Z's). Pointing nozzle up the hair shaft
forces the cuticles open, leaving hair dull-looking.'' Gosh, is that the time?

Anvar Khan sniffs around the latest oils and unguents designed to help you rub
along more smoothly
SMELLING is for dogs, but humans rely on the power of scent too. Take Proust.
He would travel 100km to Normandy each spring just to inhale the scent of apple
blossom because he believed it inspired him. Detractors might argue it didn't.
The German poet and dramatist Schiller, kept rotten apples in the drawer of his
desk, and would inhale them at moments where he found it difficult to find the
right phrase.
If I knew what the sweet smell of success was, I'd have that in my desk tidy
too. Writers and philosophers have such a tenuous relationship with the muse,
they are reduced, literally, to sniffing her out. I know she's female, that's
why she's temperamental.
Not so at Beauty Box, however, where copy flows effortlessly and eerily from a
distant part of the brain. The longer the road my thoughts have to travel, the
less responsible I feel, which provides me with that prerequisite of being a
scribe, a sense of moral detachment. A consistent selection of wiggy books,
dumping on the doormat, certainly helps, such as Create Your Own Perfumes
(using essential oils) by Chrissie Wildwood.
We learn that Napoleon used about 60 bottles of Rosemary cologne a month, but
objected to lover Josephine wearing a lesser quantity of musk. ``Je reviens en
trois jours, ne te laves pas!'' he said, asking her to refrain from washing for
three days, because he liked her to smell natural. The perfume Je Reviens was
inspired by his famous command, a fact which may or may not boost sales this
Christmas.
Wildwood does not skimp on the full story. After a brief introduction about the
hallucinogenic powers of drugs such as LSD, on which she sounds a little too
enthusiastic, she goes on to talk about provocative body scent. People who like
spicy food also plump for strong, penetrating fragrances such as patchouli,
sandalwood                   and ginger.
High dairy food consumers prefer light florals such as lavender and orange
blossom. Emotions, illness, the pill and other drugs as well as the hormonal
changes during puberty, pregnancy, menstruation and the menopause all influence
body odour and aroma preference.
This allegedly explains why the same perfume smells differently on each person
and why you can go off certain perfumes and flavours, only to return to them
later.
Interestingly, the perfume maker of ancient Egypt, was a priest or priestess
whose alchemical knowledge was employed to create sacred incense. Healing and
religion were interrelated, and sick people were ``smoked'' to exorcise evil
spirits. Indeed, the word perfume comes from the Latin per fumum, through the
smoke.
Frankincense resin was extracted from trees grown in South-west Arabia, and was
regarded as the mood-altering substance supreme. Yes, the infant Christ was
given a hallucinogenic drug as a gift from a King, but it was very expensive.
Frankincense is still burned today in Catholic churches.
In 1981 scientists in Germany investigated reports that altar boys were getting
``high'', and it was discovered that when frankincense is burned, it produces
trahydrocannabinole, a psycho-active substance which produces strange effects
on the imagination.
Apart from having a psychological effect on the brain, essential oils can
produce a physiological reaction. Perfumiers in France were often immune to the
plague, which led to the development of the Four Thieves' vinegar, a mixture of
garlic and aromatic plant essences, so-called after four thieves during the
Great Plague in Marseilles in 1722, sprinkled themselves liberally with it
before plundering the bodies of the plague victims. All four lived to plunder
again. The point of the book, however, by Wildwood, who sounds like a plant, is
to supply recipes for
Most interesting is the ``Love Potions'' section, which I have photocopied and
distributed to desperate girlfriends. You never know. ``I knew you were for me
the moment I smelled you,'' could soon be the one of the nicest things you hear
a guy say.

Into every life a little yin (or yang) must fall says Fay Young,
as she listens to Tibetan wind
chimes in Glenfarg
IN ancient Chinese philosophy, yin-yang indicates the active and passive
principles of the universe. Yin is female, dark and restful; yang is male,
light, and positive.
In the Lascelles' garden, on a windy autumn morning alternating between sun and
showers, there is a brief male and female dispute over who thought of creating
the yin-yang flower bed at the top of the lawn. Brian says, quite positively,
he thought of it one morning at work. Maggie says, not altogether passively,
``Oh Brian'', but compensates by taking undisputed credit for finding the flow
stones which direct a stream of water down the centre of the steps at the
garden entrance. Into each life a little yin (or yang) must fall.
Whoever thought of it first, the circular bed was chosen to fit the space, as
well as a shared interest in Eastern religions which echoes like the Tibetan
wind chimes round different parts of the garden - the charity they support
through Scotland's Garden Scheme is the Phoenix Prison Trust which introduces
prisoners to the benefits of yoga and meditation. The cell is an opportunity
for inner growth.
In the yin-yang bed, contrasting plants of dark and gold foliage outline the
interlocking ``commas'' representing the forces of light and dark. At the head
of each comma stands an erect yew; dark green growing out the light side, gold
from the dark. In May purple tulips oppose white and yellow varieties. ``It
only half works for the rest of the year,'' says Maggie, ``but the shape of the
bed is right, I love to watch children come running down the path and round the
border.''
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the Lascelles' gardening passion is
that they share so much of it with the public. People come from all over the
country and the other side of the world to visit Bank House Gardens in the
centre of the Perthshire village of Glenfarg, either on Open Days or by
arrangement. But the bigger part of their ground is permanently open to the
village.
In ancient Chinese terms it may be yang (``active and aggressive'') that a few
kids occasionally heave a wooden seat into the pond or snap branches off young
trees. It could be yin (``wisdom and repose'') or yang (``creative'') that the
Lascelles commissioned a chain-saw sculptor to make a bench too hefty to heave
for the benefit of those who prefer to reflect by the water-lilies. It is
probably both yin and yang that village children asked if they could have
somewhere to dip jam-jars when they are looking for sticklebacks. Hence the
stone pier.
All in all it must be good for Glenfarg. During the past three years the
Lascelles have transformed a field and adjoining coalyard into two acres of
open landscape with a pond, a wild-flower meadow across a stream reached by a
blue ``Monet'' bridge and a growing plantation of species and ornamental trees
which members of the public are encouraged to adopt.
Glenfarg Girl Guides were first to pay the #10 which covers the cost of an
engraved plaque and shows commitment to their weeping Camperdown Elm. Since
then another 44 friends, neighbours and relatives have dedicated trees, some as
memorials. The Lascelles plant the trees they want to plant anyway and local
people take personal pride in watching them grow.
The view would have been a housing scheme if Perth and Kinross planning
committee had passed the developer's planning application. The site owner
eventually accepted the Lascelles offer instead and they believe their garden
is a greater asset to the community. The trees are a gift to future
generations. ``It is unusual to have such an open space in the centre of a
Scottish village,'' says Brian.
Since public ``amenity gardens'' are entitled to financial support, the
Lascelles received Scottish Natural Heritage grants towards the considerable
cost (they would rather not say how much) of creating the pond, which required
a consultant and two mechanical diggers, and sowing the wild-flowers. Perth and
Kinross District Council mow the grass twice a year.
``That's a terrific help,'' says Maggie. ``It saves us the expense of buying a
machine big enough to cope with such a large area and the problem of building a
shed to put the ruddy thing in.''
You might wonder why they go to such effort with the new stretch of land when
there is plenty of work in the acre at the back of the house where Brian
created the underlying structure of today's garden, adding a neighbouring field
to the small yard of cabbage stalks and tin sheds left by the former bank
manager. Three separate vegetable plots have been created by Maggie since she
married Brian nine years ago. But there still wasn't enough for them to do.
``No water gardening,'' says Maggie. ``Not enough room for real trees,'' says
Brian.
Each partner has a distinctive style. Brian is the organised one, as befits the
deputy chairman of John Menzies. He plans on the ground, moving lengths of hose
pipe around until he sees the shape he wants. He cut the original borders out
of newly sown grass and built the tunnel of apple trees and clematis which now
leads to a pond and fountain cascading over a piece of sculpture called Green
Fingers.
``Structure is most important. If you get that right it is much easier to find
the right plants for the right places,'' says Brian. When he visits gardens, he
takes a dictaphone and polaroid camera with him to ensure accurate records. He
fills and sends catalogues on time and has not only planted thousands of tulips
but remembers where he put them.
Maggie fills in catalogues and may forget to send them but pays careful
attention to crop rotation in her vegetable beds. As a painter, she prefers to
plan on paper and as a long-time member of the Henry Doubleday Research Unit,
hers is the organic influence. The secret of success, in a garden which
required no watering during the long drought, is the highly productive compost
corner where the combined forces of a shredder, heavy revolving drums and
writhing red worms, turn garden and kitchen waste into a rich, steamy
nourishing store to feed the soil next spring. ``You can do the same with a
bucket at the back door,'' says Maggie, ``it just takes longer.''
But if she introduced Brian (already a firm believer in the value of manure) to
the added virtues of compost, he persuaded her that a little selective
weedkiller to prevent germination works wonders - ``I told her she could weed
the stone paving by hand,'' says Brian.
The result is a garden of extraordinary variety and each area is a speciality
in its own right. Flowers grow among vegetables. Stone sculpture stands out
among the plants, ``giving the eye something else to rest on''.
Leading the way round their landscape, Maggie stops to tease honeysuckle into
place on the Monet Bridge because she has given up with wisteria, Brian throws
seeds of wild Himalayan Balsam across the stream to encourage their growth on
the opposite bank. Ancient Chinese philosophy says: ``From the eternal
interaction of complementary dualities all things come into existence.''

Yeats's World: Ireland, England and the Poetic Imagination
David Pierce
Yale, #30
THIS spring I was privileged to do some research in the archives of the Irish
Folklore Commission in University College, Dublin. I saw shelves of collections
of folktales in Irish stretching back to last century, including some written
up in school jotters. I recalled W.B Yeats's famous poem Among School Children,
beginning: ``I walk through the long schoolroom questioning .....'' It occurred
to me that Yeats, hailed as the greatest Irish poet of this century, could not
have read one line of what was written in these Irish jotters.
This fundamental paradox of Yeats, the English speaker as the voice of Ireland
is explored in Yeats's Worlds: Ireland, England and the Poetic Imagination, by
David Pierce, principal lecturer in English at the University College of Ripon
and York St John.
Though born in Ireland, Yeats went to school in Hammersmith, and lived for more
than half his life in London. The illustrations of substantial houses in
Pierce's study show a prosperous ancestry with English roots. The poet's
grandfather William Pollexfen, who came from a landed Devon family, ran away to
sea and found himself in Sligo, from where he controlled a shipping company.
It was while staying with his Pollexfen grandfather that Yeats developed an
obsessive interest in the Irish tradition which he tried to access through
English in ``Celtic twilight'' fashion. ``Because he never learnt Irish, Yeats
perhaps never thought deeply about the loss of language,'' Pierce argues.
``When he constructs his tradition of Irish literature, the Gaelic culture is
there, but his stress falls on continuity.
For someone who made so much of sincerity as a benchmark, he crossed certain
fault lines with consummate ease. It is extraordinary - but in keeping - that
in his Hanrahan stories in The Secret Rose (1897) he sought to identify himself
with Eogan Rua O'Sullivan, the red-haired Gaelic poet of the eighteenth
century, and no less extraordinary that he should imagine himself as the Gaelic
folk-poet Raftery and Maud Gonne as his Mary Hynes, ``a peasant girl commended
by a song''.
J.M Synge was much better equipped than Yeats to be an authentic Irish voice.
As Pierce points out, the author of The Playboy of the Western World had
studied Irish and Celtic civilisation at the Sorbonne, going to the west of
Ireland and the Aran Islands each year to improve his spoken Irish and
assimilate the lifestyle of the ordinary people. He spoke for them: ``..... it
is part of the misfortune of Ireland that nearly all the characteristics which
give colour and attractiveness to Irish life are bound up with a social
condition that is near to penury .....''
In Yeats's world, there was a romantic polarity between the peasantry and
``hard riding country gentlemen''. He hob-nobbed with the Anglo-Irish
Protestant ascendancy, most notably Lady Gregory at Coole, where he was seen
``stalking across the lawn ..... with fishing rod, basket and net, looking like
one of the gentry''. He became in effect an Ascendancy bard.
Pierce is instructive on Yeats's occult interests. My own belief is that he
dabbled in the paranormal because he believed that it was a way of
circumventing his lack of Irish to access the Irish psyche, a form of
``speaking in tongues''.
The questions raised by Pierce's study - the most honest I have read on the
venerated Yeats - are profound and sometimes disturbing ones which have
relevance to the status of Scottish as well as Irish Gaelic in our time, and to
the claim of writers in one language to speak for a culture that evolved
through an earlier language.
Sorley MacLean and Derick Thomson write in Scottish Gaelic, the language of
their tradition. Will they, and Irish poets such as Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill who
remain faithful to their native language, ever be recognised as the authentic
voices, or is this impossible because they are judged in translation in a
language in which much is lost and too much assumed, sometimes for political
reasons?

STONE GARDEN and Other
Stories
Alan Spence
Phoenix House, #15.99
INTEGRITY is not rare in Scottish writing. At times the Scots seem to have a
monopoly of it, a refusal to strike attractive attitudes merely to be
entertaining. Alan Spence has something beyond integrity, a sort of spiritual
purity that inhibits gut reaction before a drop of adrenalin has been shed. Now
that is rare.
If you equate harmony with blandness his stories ought to sag gracefully to a
limp conclusion. In fact Spence's great achievement, particularly in the
concluding three stories of this collection, is to make his attentive
non-judgmental way of looking at things - ``the music of what happens'' - as
triumphantly powerful as aggro-and-appetite stories and often more memorable.
His feeling for childhood recall - not at all the same thing as nostalgia - is
at its most direct in the brief Rupert Bear and The San Izal. The sick child is
off school, engaged in the eternal mysteries of Rupert and The Conjuror and
Tiger Lily, his mother delayed at the shops. Impossibly delayed at the shops.
He is jolted out of the luxury of fantasy to the overwhelming realisation of
dependence, from the book to the possibilities of the Poison label on the
disinfectant bottle by the sink.
Bland Umbrellas is the Aids story, an episodic tale intercut with flashbacks to
a Glasgow adolescence when two friends, fresh out of school, hitch to sixties
London, ``the end of the Yellow Brick road'', react psychedelically to a shop
sign, ``Bland Umbrellas'' and separate, the friend to stay in London.
The narrator now in mid-life, flying with briefcase to the capital, begins a
crossword puzzle which he concludes on the return journey, a journey where the
stewardess wears a perfume called Eternity and he is haunted by a meeting with
his sick friend. The crossword clue finally yields Totality. The story
concludes, ``The smell of eternity. The blandness of umbrellas. The shortness
of a life. Totality. The whole jing-bang. All of it''.
Spence does a lot of that, working towards an ordained conclusion with the use
of key words, as befits a writer whose engagement with Eastern philosophies has
been a major thread in his life.
In the less well-worked stories the device comes across as a mite too obtrusive
and committed for the seamless fabric he is aiming to weave. But the concrete
basis of all his fiction is the working-class Glasgow of the fifties and
sixties, a safeguard against pretension and, for Spence, an affirmation of
humanity and moral values in the midst of deprivation.
Sailmaker, about a grief-stricken widowed father and young son staunching their
wounds, one with drink and one with home work, is the finest of these childhood
stories, full of love and resilience, the son trying to find the father's
salvation in the practice of his forgotten skills. Anger has no place in these
stories but anxiety is always present.
Bird of Paradise and Milan Cathedral at the Bottom of the Sea move out to the
Caribbean and to Italy for more sophisticated and metaphysical adult tales,
I'll be Han-Shan. You Ne Shif-Te, returns to Loch Lomondside for a self-mocking
tale of an effortful Zen camping trip.
But easily the most accomplished is the concluding trinity of the title story,
Stone Garden, the McVitie Prize-winning Nessum Dorma, and Beyond the Wall, some
remarkable ruminations on running the Glasgow Marathon.
Stone Garden is set in Japan where a businessman seeking an order for his
Scottish firm encounters the Japanese life of the mind, a collage of restraint,
courtesy and aspiration, of rock gardens, Haikus and maple-viewing. Jogging up
out of the city and into the mountains he discovers a solitary Buddhist monk
living in a hut who draws him into a ritual in his ramshackle shrine and gives
him a T-shirt printed How would you like to keep 3 cats! Look you?
``How could growing up in Glasgow have led him there, to this? And yet. That
recurring sense of something familiar.'' The Spence alter ego, shorn of
limiting stylistic adhesions and open to the daily miracles of living, is never
truly surprised. The businessman who keeps a paperweight on his desk made from
the melted windows of his childhood home in Hiroshima and the interpreter who
draws from him memories of his former self are infinitely understandable,
echoes of a common past.
Nessum Dorma moves to Edinburgh and uses the Zen approach to astonishing effect
in a tenement setting. Pavarotti's voice blares from an open window in a ground
floor room where a woman sits, oblivious to everything, re-winding the World
Cup video tape.
Over the space of 24 hours the tape continues to play while the narrator's
memory of his father's Jussi Bjorling version and the story of the opera
Turandot blend with street scenes, sporadic thought trains, neighbour reactions
and a police visit building to an intentional anti-climax. ``The music of what
happens . . . Vincero.''
Beyond the Wall is perhaps the most impressive of all for its stealthy
conversion of a fun run through the streets of Glasgow with routine time
checks, medical bulletins, sightings of key addresses - single-end, school,
university - into a shining and integrated whole, the uncompetitive race a
metaphor for life lived to the best of one's ability.
A local story made translucently universal by application of the philosophy of
respect for all people and all things.

ENGLISH grandmaster Mark Hebden took the Glasgow Open by storm earlier this
month, winning the #500 first prize with a 5/5 perfect score. The event, part
of the 34th Glasgow Congress, was sponsored by Luddon Construction and Glasgow
District Council. Some 350 players took part in the Congress, which took place
in Glasgow North College (November 3-5).
Hebden, a frequent visitor to Scottish Congresses, played superbly. Two of his
five victims were joint 1995 Scottish champions, Stephen Mannion and Colin
McNab. No-one came near him. Scottish international Andrew Muir, who managed to
avoid being paired against him, finished outright second on 4/5.
Much was expected of the only other grandmaster in the field, Colin McNab. He
took the #500 first prize in the General Accident Perth Open (October 6-8),
Scotland's strongest event last month. In Glasgow, however, McNab was ground
down in an endgame by Hebden and became just one more of the Englishman's
victims in his awesome, unstoppable run.
When Hebden is on form like this, he provides excellent value for the gallery.
A very practical player, he rarely runs short of time and is always prepared to
take calculated risks in pursuit of a win. His speed of play, aggression and
apparent nervelessness at the board, added to a well thought out, slightly
off-beat opening repertoire, are his prime assets.
