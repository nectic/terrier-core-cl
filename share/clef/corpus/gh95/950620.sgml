THE Faculty of Advocates turned to one of Scotland's most respected
legal minds, Professor Robert Black, to head the Monklands inquiry.
Professor Black, who holds the chair of Scots Law at Edinburgh
University, has spent the past seven months investigating the
allegations against the council since being appointed by the Dean of the
Faculty of Advocates.
More than 100 individual complaints have been investigated during the
inquiry, which included three days of public hearings at the end of
February.
As the inquiry ended, Professor Black said that he had received a lot
of co-operation from the public and promised that his report would not
be a ''whitewash''.
He confirmed yesterday that the cost of the process, including his
undisclosed fee and the salary of his assistant Shona Lamont, had not
exceeded the #50,000 budget set by the council, even though the report's
release is about four months behind schedule.
It was due to have been released in mid-February but was delayed
because of the volume of allegations brought to Professor Black's
attention, especially after the public hearings when many more
complainants came forward.
The inquiry was based at the council's headquarters in Kildonan
Street, Coatbridge, but Professor Black, who interviewed members of the
public and other interested parties in private, said he was willing to
meet complainants anywhere for reasons of confidentiality.
A QC who practised at the Scottish Bar for three years until 1981,
when he moved into academia, the professor's highest profile work until
now was after the Lockerbie bombing, when businessmen seeking to reopen
trade links with Libya asked him to help find a way to break the
deadlock in the criminal investigation.
Professor Black was the author of a plan to try the two Lockerbie
suspects at the seat of the International Court of Justice in The Hague
under Scots law but this proposal was rejected.
He was in the media spotlight before when he spoke out against the
poll tax at the Scottish Labour Party conference in 1988, describing it
as ''iniquitous'' legislation.
He was born in Lockerbie and educated there and at Dumfries Academy
and Edinburgh University.

As Devonport struggles to meet its submarine refitting commitments
Rosyth is plugging the gap, as Alan Hunterreports.
EXACTLY two years ago, the man charged with running Rosyth Royal
Dockyard for the Ministry of Defence was an angry man. He never made his
thoughts known publicly, amid the political morass surrounding the
battle to refit nuclear submarines which would have safeguarded jobs in
Fife well into the next century.
Today, Allan Smith, the managing director of Babcock Rosyth Defence
Ltd, still guards his feelings on the decision to give Trident refitting
to Devonport at Plymouth instead of the Scottish yard, which is
Scotland's biggest single industrial site.
The man who, however, described the decision to grant the work to
Devonport as ''an upside-down solution'', and only when pressed admitted
that he thought it politically motivated, without going into detail,
emerges as the eternal optimist.
The former engineer who went to school at Mackie Academy in
Stonehaven, and honed his skills with the former Babcock and Wilcox
company in the West of Scotland, sees a future for Rosyth despite its
setbacks of the past two years.
Troubles facing Rosyth go back much longer, having been twice placed
on a care-and-maintenance basis between the wars, with huge lay-offs,
despite the fact that it was once described by Admiral Earl Beatty as
the most up-to-date and efficient yard of the time.
Rosyth sustained the Grand Fleet war effort, made a major input into
the Second World War victory, and in more recent years contributed to
the refitting of ships for the Falklands war, the Gulf war, and, between
times, the Icelandic fishing wars when the Royal Navy's thin-hulled
frigates were regularly rammed by the Icelanders' trawlers
Allan Smith says he is determined to see the yard, which now employs
3500, back on an even keel.
He declined to be drawn, but there seemed to be some satisfaction in
the fact that Devonport dockyard, is facing problems in keeping up with
its nuclear submarine refitting programme, and providing vessels on
time.
Work has been given to Rosyth because of timescale problems at
Plymouth, and he estimates that work will continue in Scotland beyond
the year 2000.
That is a bonus for the workforce, which, after the decision on
nuclear submarine work, was awarded surface ship refitting work by the
MoD.
This week bidding by Babcock International, the parent company, will
start in earnest, with the possibility of an important industrial
development on the horizon.
It could see the consortium Rosyth 2000, in which Babcock, the Bank of
Scotland, and Forth Ports Authority are involved, setting up new
industries within the yard, in the aftermath of reduced defence
contracts as a result of the ending of the Cold War.
Allan Smith's senior colleagues have been well used to his hastily
called management meetings over the past few years.He simply telephones
his department heads to advise them: ''Be here. We have a council of
war.''
Yesterday, he admitted that busy times are once more looming.
Recalling that two years ago he was despondent over the submarine
refitting decision, Mr Smith said it was clearly laid down that the
future for Rosyth was in surface ships.
By 1997 nuclear submarine refitting was to end, and the yard had to
re-set its stall. Significant changes in personnel had inevitably
resulted, he said, with work continuing on the Navy's small ships, like
minehunters and sweepers.
The yard had also to accept the fact that there would be competition
in the refitting of the Navy's larger ships.
The managing director said he was proud that Rosyth had recently
smartened up its act, and improved performance on small ship refitting
had been noted by the MoD.
''I am very happy that this has been noted at the highest level within
the ministry,'' he said.
Double-stream refitting has now been introduced at Rosyth on larger
ships, handling two type 42 ships at the same time.
Mr Smith said a major disruption loomed in the industry because of the
difficulties in submarine refitting, due to the imposition of stringent
new nuclear safety requirements. He said Rosyth could meet such
requirements, hence the awarding of the additional submarine work.
Currently berthed at Rosyth is HMS Edinburgh, and the nuclear
submarines HMS Sovereign and Superb. Along with small ships, the yard
hopes to take HMS Newcastle in the near future, another destroyer.
It is also working on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Sir Bedivere,
which has been basically cut in half and extended.
Other diversification work has included rail carriage refitting, and
Babcock has taken over two rail workshops at Springburn, with the
setting up of a new company, RailCare Ltd.
Is there a future for Rosyth?
Mr Smith said: ''I think there is a big future here. As far as the
dockyard is concerned, this extension of life in nuclear submarine
refitting is interesting. How long it will last I am not certain, but we
could be refitting nuclear submarines beyond the year 2000.''
Referring to industrial relations at Rosyth, Mr Smith admitted that
the implications of privatisation had put a degree of strain on
relations between unions and management.
''That is something we will work at, and I have no reason to believe
we cannot overcome that,'' he said.
Away from the machinations of politics and high finance, the managing
director, who lives only a few miles from the dockyard, is never far
from engineering, even when relaxing. His hobby is repairing farm carts.

THE phasing out of the mature students' allowance may mean many people
not being able to afford a second chance at higher education. For
students aged 29 or over, the allowance was worth #1070 a year,
increasing the maximum grant from #1820 to #2890.
Lin McLean, chief student adviser of Strathclyde University in
Glasgow, believes that progressively cutting the allowance will prevent
a large percentage of mature students from coming to university.
''These are the students we'll never see. I have spoken to a number of
prospective students who have been deterred by the abolition of the
mature student allowance. They realise that they would not be able to
live on the grant that they would now get.''
One of the major complaints about abolition of the allowance was the
way it was announced.
Lin McLean said: ''It wasn't until four weeks ago, in the new guide to
student allowances, that this was made official to students, and when
students accepted places at university for next session it definitely
would not have been made known to them that they were not going to get
the mature student allowance.''
Philip Lardner is 28, and has just completed his first year of a law
degree at Glasgow University. Had he waited another year before starting
his studies he would have missed out on the allowance.
Philip, who worked in hazardous waste disposal before going to
university, said: ''If that had been the position last year this would
probably have made the difference as to whether or not to go to
university.''
What angers Philip most is the idea that he contributed to this
allowance in tax during his working years. ''Before qualifying for it
you need to have worked for three years prior to going to university and
paid tax on wages amounting to over #12,000, so it is not exactly a
hand-out. Now mature students will get nothing back for their tax
contributions, and they will find it more difficult to support
themselves at university.
For those fortunate enough to have qualified for the allowance before
its abolition, students aged 26 receive #310 a year, 27 -- #550, 28 --
#820, 29 and over -- #1070.
The Scottish Office says that, in the present financial climate, the
Government can no longer pay the allowance as it was not targeted at any
particular requirement. It rejects the idea that mature students have
higher living costs, and points out that times have changed since the
allowance was introduced 20 years ago.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''Years ago people tended to leave
school and go directly into a job, and so an incentive was needed to get
them into higher education. That is not the case today.''
But Philip Lardner believes that mature students do find it more
difficult to get by on the basic grant. ''They are more likely to live
on their own with no financial assistance from their parents, and may
even have children to support. It is easier for a younger person to take
on part-time work or live at home with their parents.''
Students aged over 50 are not eligible for a student loan. Sheila
Smith, 51, decided to study fashion design at Cardonald College,
Glasgow, after being made redundant by ScottishPower.
Sheila would like to have gone to art college but family circumstances
dictated that she went to work at 16. ''I considered this a chance to
catch what I lost years ago, and combine the skills I already have with
my desire to study.
''It makes me very angry when I hear that the allowance is to be
abolished. I have worked since I was 16 and believe that I, too, should
be given a chance to study, and an allowance which I have paid for in
tax contributions.
''For a while I thought, wrongly, that I was going to be deprived of
my mature student allowance, and as I am too old to take out a student
loan, I would have needed to give up the course.''
Ken Lloyd Jones, of NUS Scotland, said: ''This is a great injustice to
those hoping to receive the mature student allowance this year.
''Applications to universities closed in December, with many thousands
now committed to higher education who could not have foreseen this
latest cut in student maintenance.''

A FRESH political row broke out at Westminster last night over the
arms-to-Iran affair.
The Government succeeded in kicking the matter into touch by securing
Commons backing for its call for the latest revelations to be referred
to the all-party select committee for trade and industry.
Labour's demand for an independent inquiry was defeated by 267 votes
to 291, but it was clear that President of the Board of Trade Michael
Heseltine had been forced on to the back foot, and the debate was
overshadowed by new disclosures about documents relating to the BMARC
affair.
Embattled Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken, who has been
linked to the story through his involvement as a non-executive director
of BMARC, made no contribution to the debate.
Defence Minister Nicholas Soames said in a Commons written reply that
the additional papers discovered by the MoD police had come to light in
a ''re-sorting of all the property stores'' at their HQ in Essex.
They had been obtained during an investigation into corruption in MoD
procurement contracts. ''Some of these items were documents which
previously belonged to Astra/BMARC,'' Mr Soames said. ''They were
returned to the liquidators of Astra Holdings, to whom they belong, on
June 15.
''Additional documents belonging to the liquidators were discovered on
June 16 and will be sent to the liquidators. Other documents found,
which were obtained during the initial investigation, belong to
companies other than Astra/BMARC.
''The latter are being examined to verify their rightful ownership. HM
Customs and Excise and the Scott Inquiry have been informed.''
Mr Soames also said that the deputy chief constable of the MoD police
had made it clear that he had initiated a further inquiry to ensure that
no further documents relating to the corruption investigation remain in
their custody, and to establish how the documents came to be wrongly
located and why their ''retention'' was not recognised.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson said that the case
for an independent inquiry was ''unanswerable''.

MONKLANDS District Council did operate a ''jobs for the boys'' policy
and might still be giving preferential treatment to councillors'
relatives who apply for jobs, according to the independent inquiry into
allegations of corruption and impropriety in the Labour-controlled
authority.
The long-awaited inquiry report, which was released last night by
inquiry chairman Professor Robert Black, also found that there was an
imbalance of spending in favour of Coatbridge and against Airdrie for
''political'' reasons but says the conclusion must be that there has
been nothing illegal.
However, the report, which is the culmination of seven months' work by
Professor Black, was inconclusive on the matter of a sectarian bias in
favour of mainly Roman Catholic Coatbridge and against Airdrie, which is
predominantly Protestant.
It found that there were very few allegations of religious
discrimination regarding staff appointments and the awarding of
contracts and said religious discrimination could be seen as a
consequence of nepotism, given that most councillors were Catholics.
Significantly, the 32-page report does not name individual councillors
or officials when highlighting allegations made and its findings.
There has been speculation that such a report might not be covered by
full legal privilege, meaning that named individuals might have legal
redress against him.
The report found that the employment of councillors' relatives in
Monklands -- one of the main complaints of the four so-called rebel
Labour councillors whose allegations started the affair in 1992 -- is
''prevalent'' and that the treatment of job applicants was unequal.
It also indicated that, despite a revision of the council's
recruitment procedures following a review by consultants, the council is
still not treating all job applicants equally.
It states that, of 21 councillors who held office while the inquiry
was sitting, 16 have relations by blood or marriage employed by the
council and that a total of 68 relatives of councillors are known by the
inquiry to be council employees.
The inquiry was not able to investigate the circumstances in which
individual relatives of councillors came to be employed, but the report
states that the figures demonstrate ''just how prevalent'' the
employment of relatives is.
It says: ''Relationship to a councillor should clearly not be a bar to
gaining employment with the council; equally clearly it should not
accord any advantage. What is vital is that there should be (and that
there should be seen to be) equality of treatment amongst applicants.
''Prior to the council's implementation of the recommendations of the
Ashdown Millan Review of Personnel Procedures (1993), it was, at the
very least, not manifest that such equality existed.''
Professor Black's report points out that the council's revised
recruitment procedure -- which implemented the consultants'
recommendation that elected members participate only in the selection of
those of chief official rank and above -- was designed to remedy this.
''However, despite this revision there are some indications that the
need for manifest equality of treatment is still not being taken
sufficiently seriously.''
It cites as an example of this, the case of the daughter of a
councillor and her colleague in her previous employment, who were
appointed as employees as recently as last December without the
positions being advertised.
The report found that there was an imbalance of general services
capital expenditure in favour of Coatbridge, because of strategic
projects such as the Time Capsule leisure centre, and said the reasons
for them were ''necessarily political, and the decisions must be seen as
politically based''.
It said it was outwith the remit of the inquiry to comment on whether
the decisions were politically wise but added: ''All figures submitted
to the inquiry by the council have been subjected to an audit report
and, this being so, the conclusion must be that there has been nothing
legally improper.''
The council leader, Councillor Jim Brooks and Provost, Councillor Eric
Burns, had -- during the public sessions of the inquiry in February --
admitted an imbalance of expenditure on such projects but cited in
justification that the nature of the land and the projects meant they
had to be sited in the Coatbridge area.
The report said the inquiry had received budget figures for housing
capital projects for the past five years which showed a 12% higher
expenditure in Coatbridge.
It said there were allegations that the wards of certain councillors
were treated more favourably than others and pointed out that, if
councillors try to secure expenditure for the benefit of their
constituents at council meetings and through rational argument and the
submission of relevant evidence, it is a ''proper and commendable
conduct''.
It added: ''If methods other than the above have been resorted to by
elected members to achieve priority of treatment, officials and
employees should be instructed and encouraged to draw this to the
attention of the relevant head of department and the chief executive.''
The report also highlighted the ''very high number'' of allegations
made of employees being recruited directly from within the Labour Party
or even having been advised to join the Labour Party in order to improve
their prospects of employent or prospects once in employment.
It cites a number of examples of this and also says claims have been
made of victimisation of employees, with complainers thinking that
certain decisions might have been taken because of hostility towards a
particular trade union.
It says these cases are referred to to indicate what is ''clearly a
widespread view but the inquiry is in no position to say what the true
position of management was''.
There were also many allegations that some applicants would never
receive permission for the planning objectives while certain applicants
always would.
The inquiry, which studied four years of planning committee agendas,
concluded that the planning department justified its recommendations in
respect of each planning application by reference to appropriate
planning criteria, ''and are thereby fulfilling their function''.
The report states that there were very few allegations of direct
religious discrimination in the appointment of employees, awarding of
contracts, and granting of licences but said that, if there was any
justification for allegations of nepotism in relation to these matters,
''indirect religious discrimination could be seen as a consequence given
the high prevalence of councillors who are of the Roman Catholic
faith.''
Regarding allegations of malpractice in the allocation of council
housing, the report said there were particular concerns about cases
which involve houses allocated to tenants by decision of the housing
services committee where circumstances are deemed to be outwith the
standard allocation policy.
A section of the report was devoted to aspects of the National Code of
Local Government Conduct issued to elected members which contains
guidelines on how they should conduct themselves in the performance of
their duties.
It said there was clearly ''much confusion'' as to the interpretation
of the conduct rules and later referred to part of the code which is
headed: ''Disclosure of pecuniary and other interests.''
It had been repeatedly suggested to the inquiry that a number of
elected members who serve on important committees are members of the
Knights of St Columba.
The report said that, although there is no suggestion that there is
anything improper in such membership, it must be stressed that a
declaration of interest should be made by any council member when the
council is making decisions affecting any member of the public who is
known by the councillor to be a member of the organisation.
''This duty is specifically mentioned in the code with regard to
Freemasons, and the same duty must exist in relation to the Knights of
St Columba.''
The report draws attention to part of the code which states that a
councillor should never use his position to seek preferential treatment
for himself, friends, or relatives, and adds: ''It cannot be emphasised
strongly enough that councillors must be seen to err on the side of
openness and transparency in deciding when any disclosures or
declarations of interest ought to be made, in order to allay public
suspicions.''
It continues: ''In the course of the inquiry it was thought necessary
to investigate claims made of preferential treatment being accorded to
councillors as tenants. After much scrutiny of relevant documents and
statements made, it is concluded that a number of councillors have in
the past been the beneficiaries of preferential treatment in respect of
house repairs and improvements.''
Analysis of job cards and documents indicated that repair requests
relating to the houses of those councillors were treated more
expeditiously than comparable requests relating to other tenants.
It added that further allegations were made that council employees, in
council time, carried out on houses occupied by councillors work which
was not a legitimate council responsibility.
''This is deemed outwith the remit of the inquiry and the allegations
have been passed to the appropriate authorities.''
Reaction to the report's findings was swift.
Labour promised last night that there would be no hiding place for
those found guilty of misconduct, with Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson conceding that the report painted a ''serious and very
disturbing picture''.
He said: ''Anyone in Monklands who has brought the party, and with it
the local community, into disrepute will have to be brought to account.
We will also expect early and firm action from the procurator-fiscal on
those matters referred to him.''
In a tacit admission that his party has not always lived up to proper
standards in public life, Mr Robertson said: ''Labour has already
learned the lessons of Monklands and of those others who have lost touch
with the people and their worries. New Labour in Scotland's new councils
has new procedures and a new commitment to openness, consultation and
fairness of approach.''
But he added that it was wrong for the local taxpayers of Monklands to
be forced pay for an inquiry which should by right have been conducted
by the Scottish Secretary. ''It is indefensible that he allowed
allegations to go uninvestigated and to allow Ministers to encourage and
repeat them without lifting a hand.''
Mr Robertson claimed a future Labour government would never allow that
to happen. He was supported in this by Monklands East MP Helen Liddell,
who criticised the local council. She said she was ''angry and
appalled'' at the conduct of the authority and she would be seeking a
meeting with party chiefs in Scotland to discuss action to be taken
against the Labour group.
Mrs Liddell added: ''The Black report shows my constituents have been
discriminated against.''
She complained that she had faced a determined refusal by the
Government to conduct a statutory inquiry despite the fact that the
erstwhile Scottish Office Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, is on record as
challenging the recruitment practices of the council.
''This exploitation of the concerns of my constituents for narrow
political advantage is shameful,'' she said.
''The Labour Party cannot escape criticism. Labour has sweeping power
in Scottish local government. In the vast majority of cases that power
is exercised with integrity and zeal but where there are failings the
party must show that it will take no nonsense and that it listens to the
fears of the electors.
''The Labour Party must never hesitate to take as its first point of
reference the needs of the people, not the political aspirations of
party members.
''I want to hear from the general scretary of the party what action he
proposes. The people of Monklands had been angered and exasperated at
the behaviour of the council. Some of the tales in current circulation
have proved to be hearsay but Professor Black makes it clear not all the
allegations are without substance. This situation must never be
repeated, not at Monklands or elsewhere. I expect my party to act and
act quickly.''
Mr Tom Clarke, Labour MP for Monklands West and former Shadow Scottish
Secretary, was unavailable for comment.
The chairman of Monklands West Conservatives was more forthcoming.
''This is the Labour Party's mess,'' said Mr Gordon Lind. ''Let George
Robertson, and if necessary Tony Blair, try to clear it up. John Smith
maintained a monastic silence for month after month when he should have
spoken out. Now Labour has the nerve to accuse Ian Lang of failing to
act.''
This was a feeling picked up by Scottish Tory chairman Michael Hirst,
who said: ''The report raises serious questions about the scale, scope
and effectiveness of the Scottish Labour Party's so-called inquiry under
Jack McConnell (Scottish general secretary), questions that he must now
answer. Did Labour's inquiry find no evidence of impropriety, or was
their inquiry a whitewash all along?''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''Right through this sorry saga, Labour
at central level has denied any responsibility whatsoever for the mess,
from the time that SNP councillors first raised concerns about the
council's practices in January 1989, and it was the SNP who first called
for an independent inquiry into the council, which the Labour leadership
then opposed.
''The Labour Party stuck to the myth that everything in the Monklands
garden was rosy, until they were forced to admit -- under SNP pressure
during last year's by-election -- to the midden which they had created.
''Professor Black finds clear evidence of nepotism, favouritism and
incompetence in Monklands. The SNP has consistently refused to argue
that religious bias was the cause of the council's behaviour.''
In his official report Professor Black clearly identified:
* A startling spending imbalance between the two towns in Coatbridge's
favour.
* A surprising number of incidences where councillors' relatives have
received jobs on Monklands. Sixty eight employees were related to
councillors.
* Very large number of allegations which were made of employees being
recruited directly from within the Labour Party or advised to join the
party to improve their prospects of employment.
* Calls for changes to the methods used by Monklands to allocate
houses.
* Calls for councillors to declare membership of outside
organisations; specifically the Knights of St Columba.

BRUCE Rioch is set to drive a coach and horses through the tight pay
structure former Arsenal manager George Graham protected so assiduously
when he today announces the #7m signing of Dennis Bergkamp.
The Dutch player is expected to be on #25,000 a week, and two
officials of Bergkamp's present club, Inter-Milan, are expected at
Highbury this morning to complete new Arsenal manager Rioch's first
coup, beating off Chelsea and Aston Villa.However, Bergkamp may not be
the only multi-million pound new face around north London, because Chris
Armstrong will announce today whether Tottenham or Everton have won the
#4.5m battle to sign him.
The Crystal Palace striker has been mulling over the choice between
following Jurgen Klinsmann at White Hart Lane or compensating the
Goodison side for their failure to sign Stan Collymore.

TONY Higgins, leader of the Scottish Players' Union, will today await
the outcome of a European test case on transfers with mixed feelings.
The eventual verdict on the case, which Belgian player Jean-Marc
Bosman has raised in the European Court of Justice, may not be handed
down until September. But whatever, Higgins is worried about the
possible effects on the game if transfer deals are declared illegal.
Bosman, denied a move by his club, RFC Liege, has been pursuing this
matter for four years, looking for complete freedom of contract and
declaring the Belgian FA, his former club, and UEFA as being in
restraint of trade according to the dictates of the Treaty of Rome.
But in Glasgow yesterday, Higgins insisted: ''I do not think that a
complete abolition of the transfer system would be correct -- but we do
need a uniform agreement which would cover every country in Europe. It
could be that this would work.
''But the problem we have now is that if Bosman wins this case, there
are major problems for the game. Essentially it would mean that whenever
a player's contract with a club ends, he is a free agent. He can go
anywhere and the club is not compensated. I don't believe that is right.
''There is a system in France which allows players to move without a
transfer fee after they have reached the age of 23 -- but the move must
be within their own country.
''That has some merit. But, personally, I think that clubs have to be
compensated for the development of young players and the time and money
spent on doing that.
''The present system used by UEFA, where a transfer fee is worked out
according to a player's age and salary, is something which would be
acceptable to most people. But the Bosman business might not allow for
that.''
Under an umbrella claim -- for #300,000 in damages -- Bosman's lawyers
also have asked that the limit on three foreign players being allowed in
European competition should be scrapped in regard to anyone with EC
citizenship.
That is something Rangers have desired -- but whether they will want
the other facets of the Bosman case is a different matter.
And it is ironic that on D-Day for the Bosman case, Dutch
internationalist striker Dennis Bergkamp looks set to complete a #7m
move to Arsenal, a transfer which could be overshadowed by goings-on in
elsewhere in Europe.
''It is potentially a very explosive case,'' said English players'
union leader Gordon Taylor. ''If the judge finds in Bosman's favour, it
could sound the death knell of the transfer system everywhere.''
Taylor is overly concerned that the assets of clubs like Manchester
United and Blackburn could be wiped out by football's version of the
Wall Street crash, rendering worthless their investments in players like
Bergkamp, Inter's #8m replacement, Paul Ince, and Liverpool's #8.5m Stan
Collymore.
''There is sympathy for Bosman's case,'' claimed Taylor, ''which is
the fault of the Belgian FA's outdated system and reflects on the
inflexibility of FIFA. But if he wins it could be explosive.''
No transfer fees may seem, on the surface, to suit clubs, but not
receiving transfer monies has a counter-balance.
Still, if this all came to pass then it would mean yet again that the
rich in football simply would get richer and richer, while the poor
would be left scrambling for the leavings and without even the thought
that discovering a rare nugget of youthful talent would be able to
guarantee the cash from a sale which would keep a small club alive.
I doubt if Bosman has thought of that -- but Tonny Higgins has and I
don't believe that is a future he wants to contemplate.

FORMER Spurs and England internationalist Gary Lineker spoke in
Glasgow yesterday about his countryman, Paul Gascoigne, and predicted
that his talents would carry Rangers into the Champions' League next
season, writes Ken Gallacher.
''You have to accept Paul for what he is. Basically, he is a naughty
schoolboy, full of mischief, who is always behind any dressing-room
japes, but he's a tremendously gifted player,'' Lineker said.
''Obviously, that is why Rangers have bought him.
0 ''I believe he will help Rangers into the Champions' League. His
talent is unquestionable and when you put him in a team alongside
someone such as Brian Laudrup then you would expect to see results.
''The qualifying round in the European Cup comes early but he will be
ready for that.''He can be the difference between Rangers' failure over
the past two seasons and qualifying this time.
Lineker reckons there will be a new maturity about Gascoigne and an
awareness that he must make up lost time after the injuries which
interrupted his career in Italy.
His knowledge of thefootballing enigma who will grace the Ibrox
midfield is not limited to their time together at Spurs, nor to their
shared experiences with England.
He spoke to him during the recent Umbro tournament and said: ''He is
bursting with enthusiasm, he cannot wait to get back playing and also
back to full match fitness but he will need a good pre-season with
Rangers to put the edge back on his game.
Indeed, the Scottish champions will base themselves in Denmark for
three games there before playing in their own Ibrox tournament. All of
this has been arranged with a view to having the team ready for the
first European Cup-tie which comes on August 9.
''Because of the injuries he has had, and the time he has been forced
to spend out of the game, there is a risk involved,'' added Lineker.
''But there is an element of that in every major transfer.
''But, if Gazza can come back to his best, or even close, then Rangers
will have a player who is respected all over the football world. Also, I
don't foresee any problems for him in Glasgow or in the premier
division.
Lineker was in Glasgow to present the Fair Play Award from Walkers
Crisps to Dumbarton, who had just one player sent off and collected only
47 cautions in 40 matches.
* CHRISTIAN Dailly was last night handed the task of leading Dundee
United back into the premier division in just one season.
The Tannadice player -- fresh from creating a world record for
international under-21 appearances -- has been named club captain,
taking over from Maurice Malpas, who is now assistant manager at the
club.
Dailly made his first-team debut for United as a 16-year-old and now
totals 139 appearances for the Taysiders. He won his twenty-fifth
under-21 cap in France earlier this month to create the world best.
Manager Billy Kirkwood said: ''Christian has collected a vast amount
of experience for such a young player. He has just returned from another
outstanding tournament with Scotland in Toulon where he broke the record
for under-21 appearances. We want to put that to good use and I'm sure
he is the player to lead the club in the future.''

SOUTH African coach Kitch Christie paid tribute to All Black
phenomenon Jonah Lomu yesterday but said the Springboks had plans to
deal with him in the World Cup final.
''The guy's a great athlete and we must respect that,'' Christie said
of the 18st winger who scored four tries in the semi-final against
England on Sunday.
''He is a guy that you've got to think seriously about, how to
counteract him. There's a few things we'll put into practice . . . we'll
put some plans in. I don't think the man's unstoppable,'' the coach
said, adding that his Springbok marker, James Small, would not be
intimidated.
''I don't think James is scared of him. I don't think James is scared
of anyone. We'll just see how James handles him. James is working
himself up already.''
England's Ed Morrison, who sent off the sometimes tempestuous Small
for backchat during a test in Australia, was named yesterday as referee
for the final.
Christie noted that in the following test Small had shaken hands with
Morrison before kick-off and the incident was forgotten.
''I think James could be the match-winner on Saturday,'' Christie
said.
''Don't forget, if Lomu beats him, he's still got to tackle James when
he gets the ball. James will psyche himself up. I don't think he's going
to go in there thinking Lomu is better than he is. He'll probably go in
there thinking he's better than Lomu.''
Lomu, who runs the 100 metres in under 11sec, brushed off England's
defenders with contemptuous ease on Sunday on his way to the tryline.
Christie said England, 12-0 down in less than 10 minutes, had been
unrecognisable in the first half of the semi-final at Newlands. ''That
game was all over in the first seven, eight minutes.''
South African manager Morne du Plessis said full back Andre Joubert,
who played with a broken hand in the semi-final against France, was
spending more time in a decompression chamber this week to speed his
recovery.
Mark Andrews, who normally plays at lock but was picked at No.8
against France, had bruised ribs but took part in training yesterday, du
Plessis said.
Meanwhile, New Zealand rugby union chiefs look likely to win the
battle to secure Lomu's future.
Feverish planning behind the scenes is already happening with members
of the New Zealand Rugby Union determined to keep rugby's superman under
their jurisdiction.
The NZRU is expected to present Lomu with a significantly attractive
incentive to stay in the union code and reject offers to play rugby
league or even American football.
Dallas Cowboys have already dangled a million dollar contract in front
of Lomu, but for now the 6ft 5ins tall 20-year-old is determined to
concentrate on helping New Zealand win the World Cup.
The giant wing has decided not to speak to the media until after the
final. Even then, he is expected merely to confirm that he plans talks
about his future with all interested parties.
* ENGLAND spent yesterday morning licking their wounds in a
Johannesburg health club.
Will Carling's men, beaten 45-29 by New Zealand in Sunday's semi-final
in Cape Town, flew back north late that night, and yesterday, before
transferring in early afternoon to a new base in Pretoria -- where
Thursday's third and fourth place play-off against France will be held
-- the squad had a gentle workout.
Colin Herridge, England's spokesman, said: ''They are not exactly
ecstatic in mood.''
The winners of the Pretoria play-off will qualify for the 1999 World
Cup. The losers may have to qualify.
* FRANCE claim Welsh referee Derek Bevan was wrong to disallow a
crucial try in the dying moments of their 19-15 semi-final defeat
against South Africa on Saturday.
Bevan ruled that flanker Abdelatif Benazzi, caught in a maul on the
waterlogged tryline, had grounded the ball just short of the line.
But French manager Guy Laporte said a video shot by French team
cameraman Marc Metairon during the match in Durban showed the try was
good.
The video was shown to journalists, most of whom thought the evidence
was inconclusive. Benazzi said on Sunday the ball was short of the line.

THE new kids on the RWC block have sounded their arrival like
boisterous youngsters eager to put one over on their elders and betters.
The final at Ellis Park, Johannesburg, on Saturday will see the
precocious youngsters of South Africa and New Zealand square up to one
another with the William Webb Ellis trophy on offer to the victors.
It may sound like a contradiction in terms to label such
old-established rugby nations like the Springboks and the All Blacks as
freshmen on the world scene.
But, in both sides, the emphasis has been on youth. South Africa's
semi-final victory over France and the All Blacks' awesome display
against England in Cape Town on Sunday signalled the end of the old
order.
By the end of 80 minutes at Newlands, the youthful All Black side had
transformed a powerful England combination into a collection of old
crocks. The Grand Slam champions, who had powered their way to success
on the domestic circuit, were made to look like men old before their
time.
The likelihood is that, for instance, Dean Richards and Brian Moore
will have played their last game for England.
Richards, in particular, a sound and solid performer for almost a
decade, was made to look ordinary against the Kiwis. He need not feel
too bad about it, though, because all of the Englishmen were.
After the washout at Durban on Saturday, the RWC desperately needed a
game like that provided by the All Blacks and the English cannon-fodder
at Newlands.
The emphasis is on adventure, flair, and youth. Andrew Mehrtens, at
21, is the lynchpin fly-half who has made a tremendous mark in his first
season of international rugby.
Josh Kronfeld, 23, is an open-side flank forward of incredible power
and audacity. He is not a big man, as Richards, Rodber, and Clarke are
big men, but he packs a mighty punch and made the mighty England trio
look pedestrian in comparison.
Glen Osborne, only 23, is a full back in the grand attacking
tradition. Jeff Wilson, still just 21, is the golden boy on the wing. He
was just 19 when he made his spectacular try-scoring debut on the tour
to Scotland a couple of years ago.
Maybe success came too easily and too soon for him. But he, too, is a
thoroughbred and, sadly for the All Blacks' opponents in the years to
come, looks set to be around for a long time yet.
And then there's Jonah Lomu. The 20-year-old Tongan has been the
sensation of the tournament. He is, of course, a freak. Will Carling was
right. But every rugby-playing nation in the world would offer their eye
teeth to have such a freak on the books.
But Lomu, more than any of the others, may not be too long with the
Union code. He has, or so it is said, already been offered #3m to sign
up with the Auckland Warriors rugby league side. His devastating
performance over these past four weeks in South Africa has sent his
market value shooting through the stratosphere.
At Ellis Park on Saturday, the All Blacks will be competing against a
Springbok side which also has more than a fair sprinkling of youth.
Joost van der Westhuizen, 24, is the most precocious of the baby Boks.
The scrum-half has been a playing sensation, just as he was when the
South Africans were in Scotland last year.
Chester Williams, at 24, is the winger with the rapier thrust compared
to Lomu's bludgeoning sabre and he has also done something which just
three years ago would have been impossible. He is a black man in an
otherwise lilywhite team and he has won the hearts of the Afrikaaner
support in a manner which often belies belief.
Mark Andrews, 23, Os du Randt, 22, and Ruben Kruger, 24, are the other
baby Boks who have proclaimed their noisy arrival on the world stage and
who will make Saturday's final the showcase for a new order of world
rugby.
Historically, South Africa and New Zealand have been the arch-rivals
of Southern Hemisphere rugby.
On Sunday, after the All Blacks had demolished England and booked
their place for this epic confrontation, the Kiwi manager, Colin Meads
-- no new kid he -- was asked how he viewed the battle ahead.
Meads, who lost here with the All Blacks in 1970, replied with one
word: ''Revenge.''
The stage is set for one of the truly great rugby confrontations of
the modern age.

SEAN Fitzpatrick, the New Zealand captain, may become the first big
signing for Edinburgh's Watsonian Club this coming season.
It is understood that Stirling Fabrics millionaire, John Connor, will
make a public announcement as to whether he is to invest in Watsonians
or fellow Edinburgh club Boroughmuir in July.
When asked about the proposed move all Fitzpatrick would say was:
''You will need to ask Gavin Hastings about that.''
Hastings, who is in Cape Town, confirmed that he has invited the All
Black captain to join his club.
''I had a quiet word with Sean after a game against the All Blacks and
I asked him if he fancied a few months in Edinburgh,'' said Hastings.
''He said he would have to speak to his work about it. I have put the
idea to him and it's now up to him whether he joins or not. I would love
to have Sean at Watsonians.''
Fitzpatrick was happy with his side's performance against the English,
partly because his young XV had avenged a bitter defeat at Twickenham in
1993, but also because his troop more than lived up to the expectations
they bear each time they take the field as New Zealand All Blacks.
''We are a very motivated side and I am proud of them,'' he said,
stretching his weary muscles. ''All of the team members know what it
means to play for this country.
''They understand the tradition of the side. What drives us is a
hunger to live up to the great names of the past. We are as motivated as
you Scots when you play against us, and I remember some highly committed
Scottish performances.''
New Zealand not only out-muscled their stodgier English opponents,
they out-thought them as well and intimidated them on the pitch.
''We know that we would do most things to win, I have to admit that,''
said Fitzpatrick. ''We were treated badly by the English after we were
beaten by them in 1993, and that had something to do with the way that
we played the game at Newlands and the ferocity of it, but, mostly, the
reason that we were so aggressive is that all of the boys in the team I
captain want to be All Blacks. Our motivation is knowing that the people
back home are watching, too.''
And, yet, after the intimidation, the ritual abuse of the opposition,
and the complete adherence on the pitch to what it means to be an All
Black, when the game was over the New Zealanders went across to shake
hands with their utterly dejected English opposition. There was humility
in victory.
''I always say that you have to be a good loser to be a good winner,
and when the game was finished that was the end of it. We had won and we
had enjoyed it,'' said Fitzpatrick. ''I like my team's main talking to
be done on the pitch, and I think we communicated pretty well.''
Fitzpatrick said that motivation over the next week for their final
clash with South Africa will not be a problem.
Especially as they have to defend themselves daily from a barrage of
abuse after Murray Mexted, the former All Black forward, said that South
Africa would now attempt to bribe the match referee.
Having gone from rank outsiders to favourites, few would now bet
against the All Blacks taking the final. And if they do, they most
certainly have tradition, and the effect on ordinary young men of
donning a black jersey with a silver fern to thank for that.

WORLD champion Jansher Khan has been banned from playing in the
British league for the rest of the year after having been accused of not
trying in a club match.
Jansher was beaten 10-8, 9-0, 9-0 by Scotland's Peter Nicol in the
third and last match of a semi-final play-off in Bristol in April which
his club, Welshback Wizards, had already lost to Cannons Club after
Jansher's two team-mates were defeated.
John Milton, chairman of the league disciplinary committee, said
Jansher carried a responsibility as world champion always to display the
highest level of professional behaviour.

BRUCE Patterson has been overlooked this season by Scotland's cricket
selectors.
But even they found it impossible not to notice the Ayr opener's
weekend average of 204.
Left out for all four Benson and Hedges Cup ties, and last week's
one-day international against the West Indies, 'Bod' has been recalled
to the Scotland squad for next Tuesday's NatWest Trophy first-round tie
against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.
Patterson belted successive unbeaten hundreds, against Uddingston on
club duty on Saturday, followed by another on Sunday for Strathclyde
West.
And those, coupled with his general form and a dearth of runs from
Scottish openers this season against top opposition, has earned him
another chance.
Aberdeenshire's Mike Smith, who batted well against the Windies, is
unavailable through work commitments, while an ankle injury has
sidelined David Cowan, the Freuchie paceman.
''Hired hand'' Malcolm Marshall returns, while Jim Love, the SCU
director of cricket, who captained the side through the B&amp;H campaign,
has stepped down, leaving Alastair Storie to skipper the team again.
With David Haggo making slow progress after dislocating his thumb at
Northants, Iain Philip -- top scorer against the West Indies -- will
keep wicket in addition to his opening duties.The side reads:
A C Storie (West of Scotland) captain, I L Philip (Stenhousemuir), B M
W Patterson (Ayr), G Salmond (Arbroath), M J D Allingham (Heriot's), J W
Govan (Carlton), G B J McGurk (Grange), K L P Sheridan (Poloc), I M
Stanger, J D Williamson (both Clydesdale), K Thomson (Strathmore) M D
Marshall.

SOBA UP, a 20-1 outsider, shocked the punters yesterday when she won
the Wimpey Homes Edinburgh Gold Cup, leaving more fancied horses in her
wake.
It was the second consecutive year that an outsider had won
Edinburgh's most valuable race, 33-1 shot Philgun taking the trophy in
1994.
The five-year-old filly is the daughter of Soba, the sprint
handicapper who won everything in sight in 1982 as a three-year-old
including the Stewards Cup. Since going to stud Soba, now 16, has
produced six winners.
Until yesterday she had won only once from 22 starts and was
completely unfancied in the betting ring going out from 14s to 20s. All
the money was for Jim Goldie's Keep Battling and Gaye Kelleway's Daily
Starlight, who started 3-1 joint favourites.
Keep Battling took the lead more than a furlong out but made his move
too early. Soba Up, partnered by Tony Culhane, had been making steady
headway and she swept past the leaders in the final furlong to beat Keep
Battling by 3[1/2] lengths with Killick third.
Four of Spades, a 4-1 winner on Saturday evening at Lingfield Park,
turned out again in the Holygate Claiming Stakes and the 6-4 favourite
had no difficulty in chalking up his second success.
Neil Varley, a 3lb claiming apprentice, rode the first double of his
career on two Newmarket-based winners. He won the opening apprentice
handicap stakes on Acquittal, the 5-4 favourite, and completed a 46-1
double with John Berry's Mighty Kingdom (20-1) in the Westholme Handicap
Stakes.

THE paradox of Greg Norman's career is that when major titles are at
stake, he is less frequently victorious than a golfer with his undoubted
skills could rightfully demand. Cory Pavin benefited from this irony
when taking the ninety-fifth US Open Golf Championship at Shinnecock
Hills.
No sooner had Norman birdied the fifteenth in the final round (his
first such gain in 33 holes) to come within a stroke of Pavin, than the
Australian bogeyed the seventeenth to give the eventually winner the
breathing space he needed.
The No.3 wood of 228 yards Pavin hit to within five feet of the
flagstick at the eighteenth, ranked as the course's most difficult hole
for those who made the cut, was followed by ''my worst struck putt of
the round.'' But the birdie was not, in fact, needed.
But Norman was not faced with utter dejection. What was of consolation
to the 40-year-old Australian was that he had replaced Nick Price at the
top of the world rankings, and having finished second in a major for the
seventh time in a career during which he has earned a world record #9m
-- you can probably treble that with off-course earnings -- Norman has
reason for a degree of satisfaction.
Norman still taken the Open title twice so far but in the United
States he continues to draw a blank.
''I never cry over spilt milk and my record does not haunt me,'' he
insisted. ''I gave it my best shot and my best was a lot better than
many other players. Corey has always been rated very highly and to do
what he did he deserves to be the champion.''
Among the first people to congratulate Pavin was President Bill
Clinton, and he was claiming some of the credit. ''I played 15 holes
with the President last week, and when he rang he said he was spreading
the word that he had helped me,'' said Pavin, who then explained how
their game had come about.
''I rang the White House to see if I could take my family for a look
around. I'd been there, but they hadn't. I played with the President at
the Army and Navy course and the kids played in the Oval office. It was
quite a sight.''
Pavin, winner of $6m on the American Tour and leader of their Ryder
Cup points table, knew a major was all that he had left to achieve, yet
he was hardly mentioned at Shinnecock until the final nine holes.
The basis of his first major success lay in his opening round. He
battled for a 72, which contained only 26 putts, similar to the score of
75 including 25 putts with which, nine years before and in much more
severe weather, Raymond Floyd lost his victory attempt.
Pavin, ranked fiftieth of the 73 who made the cut, in greens reached
in regulation but, as a consequence, was easily first among the
principal contenders with only 106 putts in the championship. He
acknowledged that a change of putter, suggested by his wife after he had
missed three cuts in four recent tournaments, had helped.
The loss to Lee Janzen in a play-off for the Kemper Open seven days
earlier was made a footnote in history. And of the tag: ''the best
American professional still to win a major title,'' Pavin said: ''I'm
very excited to have taken that monkey off my back'' -- a burden made
heavier by the victories of Tom Kite, in the 1992 US Open, and of Paul
Azinger in the US PGA Championship the following year.
''I'm looking forward to the British Open at St Andrews next month,''
said Pavin, ''and to the US PGA championship at the Riviera Club in Los
Angeles, which was my home course before I moved to Florida.'' Little
wonder where the latter is concerned, for he also has won the US Tour
event there for the last two years.
Although 16 players bettered the 6944-yard course's par of 70,
compared with only three in the third round, Pavin alone did so of the
14 leading challengers grouped within five strokes when the final round
began.
More than half of them started almost three hours or more ahead of
Pavin, who bore the brunt of the strong wind blowing over the
fast-running course and firm greens.
Pavin, 35, and an unprepossessing 5ft 9in and weighing less than 11st,
has, because of his build in an age of strapping professionals, always
had to be one of the best manipulators of the ball. He has become a
durable competitor through the proving grounds of the Walker and Ryder
Cup matches and the world matchplay championship in which two years ago
he defeated Nick Faldo in the final.
The distances he has to concede to his contemporaries from the tee can
be measured from the statistic that he was sixty-fifth in the
championship's driving rankings with an average of 257 yards. Compare
that with the 303 yards achieved by the leader in the department, the
6ft 2in, 13st Fijian, Vijay Singh.
To be sure Pavin, who failed to gain his US Tour card at the first
attempt and then won tournaments in South Africa, Germany, and France,
did once go over the top, wearing that Desert Storm camouflage cap in
the 1991 Ryder Cup match.
But, as if in an act of contrition, Pavin has won the major
championship in which he was previously least successful.
As for Norman, in the majors so far this year, has finished third in
the Masters and now second in the US Open. The next stop is the Old
Course, where in the 1990 Open he was beaten by Faldo, the eventual
winner, in the third round. Might this be the championship in which the
fates and that fierce swing converge sympathetically?
''Third and second in the two majors so far this year is exceptionally
good golf,'' he the Australian. ''I like St Andrews and I'll be trying
to make it 3-2-1.''
* ALAN Reid has replaced David Downie in the Scotland team who will
play in the European Team Championships at Royal Antwerp from July 5-9.
The other members of the six-man team remain the same from the side
who lost to Sweden in an international at Loch Lomond.
However, the success of Stephen Gallacher and Gordon Sherry in recent
major tournaments have boosted Scotland's hopes.
On the last occasion the event was played, in the Czech Republic in
1993, Reid and Gallacher were members of the side who finished a poor
sixth. Team:
Stephen Gallacher (Bathgate), Barclay Howard (Cochrane Castle), Hugh
McKibbin (Troon Welbeck), Graham Rankin (Palacerigg), Alan Reid
(Kilmarnock Barassie), Gordon Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie). Reserve:
Craig Watson (East Renfrewshire). Captain: Colin Dalgleish.

CLIVE Brittain can make a winning start to Royal Ascot for the third
time in four years courtesy of Sayyedati in the Queen Anne Stakes this
afternoon.
The trainer landed the opening race at the Royal meeting with Sikeston
in 1991 and Alflora in '93. ''It's nice to start with a winner and it
has been a lucky race for me,'' Brittain said. ''Sayyedati is in good
form and I hope it can be a lucky race for her, too.''
The mare has struck lucky with the race conditions, which give extra
weight only to those successful in pattern races since January, 1994.
The 1993 1000 Guineas winner gets in on minimum weight as she failed to
win a race during a disappointing season for her stable last year.
But she showed she retains ability when runner-up in the Prix Jacques
le Marois at Deauville in August.
Alan Bailey can outpoint some more fashionable trainers by landing the
Coventry Stakes with Dovebrace. His 6200-guinea yearling has proved a
bargain buy in his two outings to date.
He belied his position as outsider of the seven runners to land a
maiden at Haydock last month. And he earned a trip to Ascot when he
showed a good turn of speed to pip Newmarket winner Lucayan Prince in a
#10,000 race at York.
There is better to come from Dovebrace, described as ''absolutely
bouncing'' by his trainer.
Last year's Oaks and Irish Derby winner Balanchine is the clear choice
on form in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. And given the tremendous recent
run of the Godolphin horses, it would be no surprise to see her defying
nearly a year's absence from the track.

FRASER Walker's season of disappointment continued yesterday when he
was left out of the Scotland team for the Canadian Championships in
Winnipeg from July 27 to 30.
The Commonwealth Games medallist won the two medley titles at last
week's Scottish championships, but his times were not good enough to
secure a place in the line-up.
Walker, who failed to retain his place in the British side for this
summer's European championships, had indicated during the championships
that he would turn down selection for the warm-up training camp in Lyon,
France -- preferring to put in some extra training with his club,
Warrington Warriors.
But he did want to go to Canada as part of the build-up to next year's
Olympics. Now, he faces a summer minus major competition.
Cameron Black, from Arbroath St Thomas, has been rewarded for his
title double at the Scottish Championships with a first international
selection.
''The selections send out a warning that the swimmers have to come up
to scratch,'' said team manager, Danny McGowan. ''We are setting higher
standards, and will no longer settle for taking second best.''
''There has been a downward trend in the sport in Scotland for many
years. Hopefully, this will give people like Fraser a jolt.'' Team:
Cameron Black (Arbroath St Thomas), Alison Sheppard (Milngavie and
Bearsden), Pauline McLean (Stirling University), Forbes Dunlop
(Milngavie and Bearsden), Tom Griffith (Milngavie and Bearsden), Richard
Hope (Warrender), Kirsty Hope (City of Dundee).
* Kerry Martin (Stirling University) also was selected, but has had to
withdraw due to injury, and will not be replaced.

YVONNE Murray was nominated yesterday to take over the captaincy of
the British women's team for this weekend's Europa Cup final in Lille,
following the absence, through injury, of Sally Gunnell.
Murray, who runs the 5000 metres, which replaces the 3000m in the cup
for the first time, made her UK international debut in 1983 and has
competed more than 40 times for Britain since. She has won the European
3000m title indoors and out, and the 1993 world indoor 3000m crown.
Linford Christie may yet assume the captaincy, despite doubts that he
may not run following the death last week of his mother.
Birchfield's Katharine Merry, troubled by a knee injury, has declined
to join the relay squad, but weekend victories in Lille by triple jumper
Jonathan Edwards (17.44m) and 1500m runner Kelly Holmes (4-10.98), plus
confirmation that 10,000m runner Liz McColgan is ready for her first
track race since the Barcelona Olympics, were a big boost for the team.

GREG Rusedski, the Canadian import who has controversially claimed the
British No.1 spot, suffered another first-round defeat at the Nottingham
Open yesterday.
Dismissed by Essex's Mark Petchey in his opening test in the Stella
Artois championship at Queen's Club a week ago, Rusedski lost to
Argentina's Javier Frana, ranked 10 places above him on the ATP Tour
list at No.48.
Frana broke Rudeski's big serve twice in the first set and then easily
won a tie-break in the second to wrap up a 6-3, 7-6 victory. Petchey
also was a first-round casualty, losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 to Monte
Carlo-based Czech Martin Damm.
American Jonathan Stark lost to Italian Gianluca Pozzi 6-7, 7-6, 6-4
and American Malivai Washington, the fifth seed, beat Frenchman Lionel
Roux, 6-4, 6-2.
* BORIS Becker has been fined $20,000 by the ATP Tour for comments
about Thomas Muster following the German's defeat by Muster in the Monte
Carlo Open final last month.
''The remarks made by Boris Becker raised inappropriate questions
about the reputation of Thomas Muster and the tournament physician Dr
Patrick Coudert,'' Tour official David Cooper said.
Becker, who plans to appeal, made comments that were interpreted as
suggesting Muster took a banned substance in order to recover from an
exhausting semi-final the day before.
* FORMER British No.1 Jo Durie has vowed to remain in tennis after
officially retiring next week at Wimbledon. The one-time world No.5, who
is 35 next month, will assist her coach Alan Jones with his squad of
promising British talent and may compete at the National Championships
later this year ''just for the devil of it.''
* THE seeded players at the All England championships at Wimbledon
from June 26 to July 9 are:
Men's singles -- 1, A Agassi (USA); 2, P Sampras (USA); 3, B Becker
(Germany); 4, G Ivanisevic (Croatia); 5, M Chang (USA); 6, Y Kafelnikov

A CHAMPAGNE reception for all staff at James Watt College, will be the
fitting climax today, to two years of intensive work towards achieving
Investors in People (IIP) recognition. At a lunchtime award ceremony,
Tom Farmer, chairman of Investors in People Scotland, will present two
plaques to principal Terry Davies, whose college is the fifth in
Scotland to achieve the standard.
Every member of staff from the principal to academic, to support
staff, has been involved in working towards the standard which is
rigorous but flexible to suit the individual ethos and culture of each
organisation and is focused on its own unique strategic objectives.
Investors in People was launched in Scotland two years ago, and the
Government has a set itself a target of committing 50% of all
organisations by the year 2000. Tom Farmer, in congratulating James Watt
College on achieving IIP recognition said: ''The panel agreed that the
college meets the requirements of the IIP national standard, and
recognised the strong human resource development processes supporting
the achievement of business goals.''
Sandra Middleton, director of staff development who came to James Watt
College in early 1993, took over as IIP project manager in December of
that year, having been a member of the Action Planning Working Group,
which had the assistance of a consultant appointed by Renfrewshire
Enterprise.
Mrs Middleton says: ''We had to carry out certain key initiatives:
integrating support and academic staff, implementing career review
interviews, setting up a line management system and a sophisticated
system of evaluation for all training.
''Investors in People is a systematic approach to training which is
seen as an investment rather than a cost, therefore it is planned,
managed, and evaluated and is right at the heart of the operation. It
has improved staff morale, improves communication within an
organisation, and it focuses on training and development.
''As a result, we have supported more than 40 staff to achieve
degrees, paying their fees, and in the case of support staff many have
been undertaking HNC and HND programmes funded by the college. This has
been done under the umberella of Investors in People.
''It is on-going, so now that we have achieved accreditation it's all
got to be maintained. We are assessed again in three years time --
there's constant improvement, and no resting on laurels.''
Terry Davies comments: ''We are a large community college, and very
much a people organisation. IIP has enabled us to focus and maximise the
talents of our staff by the continual and on-going identification of the
training and development needs.''
In commenting on the award to James Watt College, Tony Cassidy, chief
executive of Renfrewshire Enterprise said: ''If our companies and
institutions are to compete with the best, then they must be seen to be
the best.
''This award recognises the hallmark of quality and, as an important
player in the delivery of our various training and skills programmes, we
are delighted to see the college in the vanguard of this new
initiative.''
Sandra Middleton -- who leaves James Watt this summer to take up a
part-time post as an associate assessor with IIP Scotland -- explains
that in addition to staff on campus, the college's area of
responsibility is geographically diverse.
''We have a lot of outreach provision in Oban, Campbeltown,
Lochgilphead, Dunoon, and they have had to be involved -- with the
support of other staff who have assisted me in networking, it has been
achieved but it was difficult. We also have a prison unit. Greenock
Prison has an educational section with staff from this college -- as
part of us, they had had to be involved too.''
Of the college's group of Skillseekers (which replaced the Youth
Training Scheme), two young people have been given full-time jobs at the
college. One of them, 18-year-old Diane Williams, has been Mrs
Middleton's ''girl Friday'' and is currently being supported by the
college in undertaking an HNC in office administration. ''Diane started
out as a Skillseeker who was assigned to help me, and was so good and so
valuable that we invested in her,'' explains Sandra Middleton. ''She has
become a full-time permanent staff development assistant to me -- that's
a clear example of investing in people.''

THE West Indies were reduced to four fit pacemen and robbed of the
chance of an exciting victory chase against Durham at Chester-le-Street
yesterday.
The target was 162 in 21 overs but eight overs were lost to rain and
stumps were drawn at 5.30 with the tourists on 16 for one.
However, missing out on the #2500 they receive for each victory in the
Tetley Challenge matches was of less concern than the hamstring and knee
injuries which prevented Winston Benjamin from taking the field.
With Kenny Benjamin already doubtful for the second Test because of a
side strain, Ottis Gibson has a good chance of making his Test debut at
Lord's on Thursday.

<HEADLINE>Cherished by Scots as a distinctive species Highland cattle enjoying renaissance in homeland</HEADLINE>

HIGHLAND cattle may be about to enjoy a renaissance in their homeland
as part of a growing desire among Scots to cherish all of Scotland's
distinctive or endemic wildlife species, Magnus Magnusson, chairman of
Scottish Natural Heritage, said yesterday.
In a keynote address to the Highland Cattle Society's international
gathering at Ingliston, near Edinburgh, he told nearly 300 delegates
from 15 different countries: ''I recognise, of course, that market
forces control most things in our lives -- that's the realist in me.
''The idealist in me hopes that sufficient people like you will
continue to regard Scottish Highland cattle as more than just an entry
in the profit-and-loss ledger -- important as I know that has to be.
The growing fondness for Highland cattle went along with increasing
concern for the likes of the red squirrel, the otter, the Scots primrose
and the Scottish Crossbill, he said.
One researcher was convinced that today's Highlanders were close
descendants of the wild oxen which roamed Scotland before the first
human settlers arrived, more than 50,000 years ago. They had been, until
recently, the mainstay of Scotland's crofting culture and of the
commercial hill cattle industry.
''As we all know the Highlander has a remarkable ability to survive on
poor herbage and is therefore ideally suited to certain kinds of West
Coast farming areas. Over the centuries it has evolved a mechanism for
digesting vegetation which would be unpalatable to today's modern
cattle.
''They have learned to exploit that kind of roughage. They have
learned how to forage and utilise those areas on which other stock can
barely exist. So their value to the natural heritage is that they can be
used to manage some of the more intractable parts of the natural
heritage.''
Experiments conducted on the island of Rum by Scottish natural
Heritage had demonstrated that putting Highland cattle into certain
areas had helped to keep down large tussocks of purple moor grass which
were swamping other vegetation -- thereby encouraging a much greater
richness and diversity of flora like wild thyme and kidney vetch and red
fescue.
''Our contention is that there are many plants which would disappear
from sight, on the surface at least, if we did not use Highland cattle
as a component to maintain and increase floristic diversity.''
On the Continent, he said, Scottish Highland cattle were frequently
bred and kept for the management of large expanses of former
agricultural land which was now classified as a nature reserve and
managed for wildlife.
Mr Magnusson welcomed the news of the establishment of a marketing
committee to promote the sale of quality meat from Highlanders.
''I am sure that Highland cattle beef could find a really significant
niche in the quality market of Scots cuisine products, especially in the
tourist areas,'' he said.

* This week's tip comes from BILLY YULE, professional at Deer Park
Golf Club, Livingston.
ONE of the biggest problems in golf is a slice. The place to find a
cure is on the practice ground, and the following drill should help.
Stick an umbrella in the ground two to three feet behind the ball, and
leaning slightly inwards. Now make a swing. The biggest cause of a slice
is coming out and across the ball on the downswing. But, if this
happens, the club will hit the umbrella.
Only if the club follows the proper track -- back on the inside, and
then down on the same line -- will a collision with the brolly be
avoided.
The umbrella's presence will encourage -- or force -- you to make the
proper swing. Keep practising, and the swing's correct pathway will
become grooved and natural.
For any standard of golfer, this is a good practice tip to help keep
the swing in check.

IAN Pettigrew, of Troon Welbeck, has taken the lead in the men's
handicap section at the halfway stage with a net 60 over the Lochgreen
course in the club's pro-am qualifier which converts to a Parbusters
score of minus 13, well worthy of our bandit-of-the-week title, writes
Douglas Lowe.
''It was one of those exceptional rounds for me,'' said the one-time
22-handicapper who is now down to 17. ''The 82 is a personal best for
the course.''
There was nothing higher than a 6 on his card, and one birdie. Sadly,
the offshore production technician will miss the club pro-am but our
final on October 4, for which he is likely to qualify, looks promising.
Congratulations to Fiona Scott, whose 70 over Bothwell Castle is this
year's first minus score in women's scratch. Leading scores:

<TEXT>
THE present feel-good factor in Scottish farming is ushering in an era
of stability which could last for some years to come, Mr Jimmy McLean,
head of agricultural services at the Royal Bank of Scotland, claimed
yesterday.
''People are recognising that things are a bit more stable, and likely
to be so,'' he said.
Mr McLean said that talk of the need for further reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy seemed to be more prevalent here than on the
Continent.
Our European partners were happy with what they had achieved and did
not want to upset the balance by bringing in new reform proposals, he
said. There was a fear that if proposals for change were put to the
council that could precipitate much further-ranging changes than were
considered desirable.
At the end of the day, he said, decisions were made at European level.
''We are only one voice in 15 and we are going to be swept along with
what the majority feel. I do not think there is a great pressure for
change, so things are likely to be fairly stable for the next five to
eight years.''
He was confident, however, that farmers would adapt to any changes in
the future. ''They are playing according to the rules just now and I am
sure that if the rules are changed our farmers will respond. If you wrap
any industry in cotton wool the competitive edge could disappear -- but
I do not believe that is happening just now.'' Any changes in the
subsidy regime would, in the short term, be minor, he suggested.
The feel-good factor should also rub off on ancillary trades, said Mr
McLean. The indications were that farmers were ready to re-invest in
their businesses.
The Royal Bank's economics office is forecasting that further interest
rate rises will be required in the coming months. They have, however,
revised their calculations downwards in the light of indications that
the Chancellor is loosening his inflation criteria. Short rates were now
expected to peak at 8.25% next year, said Mr Jeremy Peat, chief
economist.

LAST week, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Education Minister,
visited the Waterfront Campus, the new business and management centre
for James Watt College, which comprises a block of 40 teaching rooms and
two conference rooms. In addition, there are two halls of residence on
the site, each capable of accommodating 84 students. The new campus will
also have a bistro bar, the Water's Edge. ''I hope it will act as a
catalyst for further industrial and commercial regeneration,'' he said,
praising James Watt for leading the way among colleges attracting
private finance, and hoped that others would follow.
''This is a highly momentous occasion in the history of the college,
showing faith and courage,'' Mr Gerry Quigley, chairman of the college
said.
The waterfront is an important and key element in the expansion and
development of the college,'' comments Terry Davies. ''We are on target
for it opening on time for the academic year beginning in August, with
the residences due to be ready later in the autumn.
''The entire business and management faculty is going down there with
35 staff. In addition to that, a new college company will be set up
there with two Business Development officers, and there will be also, a
centre for the training of trainers. The new complex allows us to
re-focus and relocate within the main building, so that the faculties
are more rationalised which is quite important, particularly for their
organisation and administration.''
Further overseas links are planned, and the college's overseas
co-ordinator, accompanied by a member of the computing staff, has
recently returned from a visit to Hong Kong.
''We will be having another group of Yakutian students next year,''
explains Mr Davies. ''The minister of education is coming over at the
end of this month. The submission has gone in and has been accepted.
''We have also the European dimension. I was out in Prague with the
European co-ordinator and the head of our Business and Management
faculty looking to set up links with universities in eastern Europe. So
we have a combination of things, we never have less than about 30
European projects going at the one time, and people do come over on a
regular basis -- we have student exchanges, staff exchanges and other
projects.''
For June Kelly, the new halls of residence are a key element in
marketing James Watt College overseas. ''People feel that they'll be
looked after in a strange country, especially because of all the
language support on offer. It could be that they don't speak much
English, and English as a Foreign Language is clearly useful. Either
it's preparing people to do our courses, or help them access degree
courses, by getting their English up to speed here, and their necessary
qualifications. It does give us a big marketing edge to have the
halls.''
In addition to the bistro facilities in the evening, the halls of
residence will have self-catering facilities and other elements
typically found in a university residence.
''The key overseas market we're going for initially is Hong Kong,''
explains Ms Kelly, ''because they are used to coming to the UK for
education, and have a special warmth for Scortland, so it's starting
with an already familiar overseas market, then moving into other areas
in the Far East.
''Although it's early days, the response to our overseas marketing
activities has been very exciting with enquiries coming from South
Africa and Singapore as well as Hong Kong.''
The Waterfront Campus represents an investment by the college of #7m.

TEMPERAMENT is a key part of the Dean Robertson armoury as he
demonstrated last night on the first tee at Milngavie, having arrived
with little more than 10 minutes to spare before crossing swords with
Tartan Tour stalwarts Colin Gillies, Kevin Stables, and Russell Weir in
the club's centenary skins match.
The 24-year-old Robertson had missed his flight back to Glasgow on
Sunday night because of his late start in the Jersey Open in which he
finished second to Dalmahoy's Andrew Oldcorn, picking up a career-best
cheque for #33,330. Yesterday he had to take a flight to London and a
shuttle north, giving him time only for a quick visit home and a change
of clothes before heading out again.
Still, he managed to squeeze in a few words with The Herald prior to
his call to the tee.
What significance did he attach to his pre-shot routine, which he said
in Jersey had played a big part in this latest success, his fifth top-10
finish in his rookie year?
''It is very important to do the same thing before each shot,
especially when you are under pressure,'' explained the former Scottish
Amateur champion and Walker Cup player. ''It helps confidence and
ensures you are thinking about the shot and not the significance of it.
I take two practice swings before each shot and the same on the putting
green.''
In fact, he took four practice swings on the first tee last night, and
two waggles, the extra swings presumably constituting a warm-up, before
splitting the fairway with a shot of power and grace which was the best
of the quartet.
If young Robertson was looking more laid back than usual, he had every
reason. His cheque from Jersey had lifted him to No.31 in the Volvo Tour
Order of Merit with winnings of #67,218 to ensure that he will not only
retain his European Tour card for next year but move up a category.
''That was the main objective this season and I am delighted to have
achieved it so early,'' said the recruit to Ian Doyle's Team Sweater
Shop. ''It means that next year I will be able to play in everything
unlike this year when my tournament starts have been restricted.''
This will be his second promotion. He claimed card No.39 out of 40 by
chipping in for a birdie in a play-off at the Montpellier tour school,
and made the most of his break by good early showings which merited a
rise of 37 places to No.2 among the graduates at the first re-ranking.
The Gleddoch-based player, whose golfing alma mater is Cochrane
Castle, is leading the race for the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year
Award. If he succeeds there will be no coach to claim credit. He looks
after his own swing, checking out flaws -- of which there are none at
the moment -- by video.
He will, however, be taking a rest this week and has pulled out of the
French Open with a busy schedule coming up.''
That will feature in consecutive weeks the BMW International Open in
Munich, the Murphy's Irish Open, the Scottish Open, and the Open
Championship, for which he must first pre-qualify.
What, then, is his target for the rest of the season?
''To win as much money as possible,'' he replied, adding as he hurried
to the tee: ''Starting now.''
He did indeed. Robertson went home with #950 including a #750 skin at
the fifteenth. Gillies won the same amount, Stables #750, and Weir #350.

Wendy Jack reports from a Greenock College whose growth and
development has been against the national trend
JAMES Watt College of Further and Higher Education at Greenock -- the
first Scottish college to be given the designation -- has been going
through a period of unprecedented growth and development over the past
four years.
The next academic year will see the opening of a new #7m waterfront
campus -- to which the business and management faculty will move --
which promises further expansion and opportunity, not only for the
benefit of UK students, but also for those from overseas.
This most dynamic of colleges is a centre of excellence for the
provision of advanced degree equivalent programmes such as HNCs and
HNDs. The principal of James Watt College for almost five years has been
Terry Davies, previously depute principal at Telford College, Edinburgh.
He explains: ''We have expanded more rapidly than any other college in
Scotland over the past three or four years. We now have more than 160
full-time courses available.
''From September, more than 90 HNC and HND full-time courses will be
on offer, compared with around six some four years ago, there has been
an enormous leap. Over the same period, non-advanced courses have risen
from about 30 to around 85. We are probably the third largest college in
Scotland after Aberdeen and Telford, with some 8500 students, about
two-thirds of whom are part-time.
Altogether we have well over 230 courses available through a mixture
of full-time, part-time, day release and open learning, giving a wide
range of subjects and levels to meet all needs and abilities.
''When we were first designated a college of further and higher
education,'' Mr Davies continues, ''35% of our programme was at
degree-equivalent level; it is now at 55% and we are developing quite
formal links with Glasgow Caledonian University. It is likely that we
will become an affiliate college in the late autumn.''
With almost 500 staff, James Watt College is a major employer in
Greenock. Its programmes reflect the nature of local community, and its
needs and aspirations. For the populations of Inverclyde, Cowal, Bute,
and North Ayrshire, the college offers a comprehensive selection of
vocationally based courses which provide good job opportunities. There
is extensive involvement with Local Enterprise Companies (LECs), in
particular Renfrewshire Enterprise and Argyll and the Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, with programmes predominantly relating to unemployed
personnel. Currently, the college has 12 Skillseekers within it.
In addition, the college works in close conjunction with major
international companies such as IBM, Compaq and National Semi-Conductor,
responding with speed and efficiency to the employee training needs of
incoming and existing employers in the area.
Director of marketing, June Kelly says: ''Our marketing has been
effective in the West of Scotland, and not just locally. There are two
aspects when people come to James Watt College: either they can come
here for a vocational qualification and the necessary skills to go
directly into employment, or they can come to help them progress into
university.
''It wasn't so simple before, but now it is an alternative route and
increasingly popular. Those not confident enough to go straight to
university come to us, we can give them more support than they'd get in
a university environment.''
During this current academic year, a group of Yakutian students from
Siberia have been attending James Watt College. Half of their course
this year is English as a Foreign Language, and the other half SE
Highers, while last year's group studied English and the Higher National
Certificate in Computing.
Because of the pace at which the college has developed, Terry Davies
believes: ''Our staff have tended to have to work harder and respond
quicker than most people from other colleges. I think as a direct result
we've promoted quite a large number of people from within. Many
part-time staff have become full-time at lecturer level, and others have
moved to become senior lecturers or taken promoted posts. Of the 100 or
so vacant positions in the past three years, I would estimate that 60%
have been filled internally.
''Some six weeks ago,'' Mr Davies says, ''we advertised 35 new posts,
and we are now in the process of interviewing. That is totally against
the trend of further education colleges, particularly with formula
funding and market forces and so on coming in. Two or three colleges are
making quite heavy redundancies at present, others are having to look
hard at balancing the books. I don't think there will have been 35 posts
available in the total 42 colleges.''
Having undergone an activity expansion of more than 150% in the past
four years, James Watt College anticipate further expansion of 10% per
annum in each of the next three years. The college budget is currently
#12.5m, of which #4m is income earned by the college.

THE current optimistic mood in agriculture has been reflected in the
demand for trade stands at this year's Royal Highland Show, which opens
on Thursday.
Officials estimate that about 73% of the stands this year will fall
into the ''agricultural'' category . A waiting list had to be
established when bookings were being taken.
Attendances are difficult to forecast, being highly dependent on the
weather, but if there is a dip it will be against the trend of recent
years. The 1994 total attendance was 152,919.
The show, which costs about #2m to stage, is expected to generate
business worth about #50m including machinery deals struck in the
showground, retail sales and spin-pff business for hotels and guest
houses in the Edinburgh area.
Major sponsors, the Royal Bank of Scotland, have the only bank cash
machine outlet in the showground and last year, over four days, it
dispensed #100,000. The average spend per visitor to the show is more
than #50.
Among the latest technology items displayed at the show will be a
packaged refrigeration unit.

WHETHER by accident or design, the programme chosen by the great
Norwegian cellist Truls Mork for his celebrity recital at the St Magnus
Festival -- big, meaty works by Prokofiev, Sibelius, and Grieg -- set
unusual demands for the pianist-accompanist.
With the best will in the world, the finest accompanists are not
concerto soloists -- as at least one has found out to the cost of his
reputation not so long ago at this very festival. And a pianist of
concerto standards is exactly what this programme -- especially the
Sibelius and Grieg works -- required.
Even more than that, Truls Mork, a giant of a man, is a fabulous,
all-round player who happens also to have an immense sound. The sheer
power and volume he draws from his cello are mind-boggling. No surprise,
then, before the recital, when the piano lid was raised from its
customary half-mast to full height: it was like a raising of the flag.
And if all of this sounds as much of a build up for pianist Jean-Yves
Thibaudet as for the big Norwegian himself, then that is exactly what it
is. What followed was one of the finest recitals ever staged at the St
Magnus Festival.
Prokofiev's Sonata, delivered by the two players with the utmost
sensitivity and spell-binding concentration, was like a journey from
darkness to light. In Sibelius's bizarre masterpiece, Malinconia, the
tension between the outpouring of soulful cello melody and the volcanic
waves of virtuosity on piano was shattering.
And in Grieg's Sonata, Mork and Thibaudet, completely unbuttoned --
yet absolutely in control -- threw themselves into the torrential
lyricism of the music with an almost buccaneering abandon. Two
exceptional players, one memorable recital.

* Ayr-based auctioneers James Craig denied yesterday that it had
sought to put undue pressure on shareholders of Wallets' Marts as part
of their #1.5m takeover bid.
A statement issued by Craig, in the wake of an interim-iterdict
granted at the Court of Session, said that at all times it had gone to
extreme lengths to ensure that all contact with shareholders, in writing
or in person, was strictly within the provisions of the Takeover Code
and the Financial Services Act.
The interdict granted to Wallets' followed a telephone campaign by
Craig targeting Wallets' shareholders.
A spokesman for Craig said that the Takeover Panel had confirmed that
it had not attempted to prevent the continuance of the telephone
campaign employed by Craig's advisers last week.
''At all stages of our communications with Wallets' shareholders we
have consulted the Takeover Panel, seeking their guidance and advice,''
he said.
Today is the closing date for acceptance of the Craig offer of #12 a
share.

TIME was that for that many young Scots the first step towards a
career in dance was the move South. Whether their preferred style was
ballet, jazz, contemporary, or showbiz strutting it seemed that -- after
gaining an initial grounding at home -- the really serious contenders
headed off to finishing schools (and stages) in England. And chances
were that if they trained there, they remained there.
There had to be a way of stopping this outflow of talent in its
tracks. There was, and is. It's called the Dance School of Scotland,
it's based in Glasgow at Knightswood secondary school and since 1983 it
has been in the business of giving youngsters from all across the
country, a vocational dance training within the existing education
system.
This week its students are on show at the Mitchell Theatre from
tomorrow until Saturday. It's the end of term performance, an
opportunity for members of the public to see for themselves the range of
work encompassed by the school.
When I popped in, earlier this month, rehearsals were already well
under way. In one studio David Long, (artistic director of the dance
school) was working out the choreography for a balletic interlude using
the youngest pupils.
Upstairs, in another rehearsal space, Sheridan Nicol was briskly
adding edge to an up-tempo jazz number that had the joints fairly
jumping in her group of middle-school students.
Out of the main building, in a special extension used solely by the
dance school, Pauline Laverty -- ex-Scottish Ballet dancer -- was going
through the moves of a contemporary piece she had made for the seniors.
Walking round, looking in -- even briefly -- you soon sensed the
eagerness, the hunger, and commitment of the youngsters who are enrolled
in this school-within-a school.
Just how vital -- and in some cases undreamt-of -- this training is,
emerges afterwards, in conversation with Rosemary Denny (head of the
dance school), Sybil Simpson (head of Knightswood Secondary) and Graham
Dickie (musical associate at the dance school).
All three are clear and specific about one thing. There are pupils,
past and present, who would never, ever, have fetched on dance as a
career had it not been for the Dance School of Scotland.
Once such is Robert Doherty. In 1990 the dance school undertook an
outreach exercise in Easterhouse and Drumchapel. As a result of this
programme Robert Doherty -- from Summerhill Primary School, Drumchapel
-- was seen as a likely candidate for further training. He successfully
auditioned, joined the dance school in 1991, and has, this spring,
achieved a scholarship to the prestigious Ilkley Ballet Seminars in
Yorkshire.
It is, says Sybil Simpson, essentially a matter of equal opportunity.
She speaks passionately about every child being able to have access to
the educational system in order to fulfil their aspirations in whatever
field they choose.
It's a mere six months since she took over that headship of
Knightswood Secondary but it's clear that, for her, the dance school
which she inherited as part of her remit, represents a valuable way of
offering these opportunities.
Rosemary Denny has long cherished an ambition to extend the dance
school's provision by introducing a sixth year of full-time dance
training. She floated the scheme -- Sybil Simpson gives it her full
support. This means that now older pupils need not necessarily leave
Scotland for that crucial top up training.
The Dance School of Scotland has more than proved its worth already.
Scan the biogs in various programmes -- cast lists of musicals, pantos,
as well as company lists for ballet troupes -- and you will find,
increasingly, the names of those who have passed through the school's
portals.
This week when the next generation of talent takes to the stage at the
Mitchell there will be a clear indication of some who will make their
career in public performance. But others may well swell the ranks of
teachers who in their turn will help encourage future recruits.
It's all part of a long-haul process aimed at building up an
infrastructure capable of supporting a strong dance scene within
Scotland. More and more we need to convince those who have the talent
that it is worth their while staying here, working here, returning some
of their ability into the resource pool of their native land.

GLASGOW-based residential property letting companies Norcity II and
Norhomes are the first in Scotland to join the Alternative Investment
Market, which yesterday opened for trading.
Although many companies, such as Rangers Football Club, and
institutional investors are adopting a wait-and-see attitude in relation
to the London Stock Exchange's new market for smaller and growing
companies, the mood at AIM's Glasgow launch was generally positive.
Rangers' Old Firm rival, Celtic, has already declared it will sign up.
Bernard Solomons, chairman of the London Stock Exchange in Scotland,
said: ''I honestly believe we have got the right balance between
flexibility and ease of entry and regulation.''
With AIM including smaller and newer companies than have so far been
traded under the Stock Exchange's umbrella, investors will have to
decide whether they are satisfied with the safeguards contained in the
market's entry requirements.
Mr Solomons emphasised that regulation had been a very important
consideration in the establishment of AIM.
Justin Urquhart Stewart, a member of the Scottish advisory team tasked
with keeping the new market on track, believes AIM could facilitate
between 50 and 70 new fund-raisings during the next year.
He believes, given the strength of Scotland's financial services
sector, that one-third of these could be transacted north of the Border.
It is envisaged that about 200 companies could be traded on AIM by the
end of next year.
Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Financial Enterprise, the private
sector body which promotes the interests of the financial services
community, will continue to be closely involved with AIM.
Mr Urquhart Stewart, a director of Barclays Stockbrokers, believes AIM
will boost Scottish industry, by making it easier for companies to raise
funds for growth, and further strengthen the financial services sector.
Companies currently traded under ''Rule 4.2'' on a ''matched-bargain''
basis, such as Rangers and Celtic, have been given until September to
decide whether to sign up for AIM.
Rangers' financial controller Douglas Odam said yesterday that his
company would consider over the next few months whether to join.
Although most companies currently traded on the Unlisted Securities
Market will be in a position to graduate to a full listing by the time
USM closes at the end of next year, about one-third could move to AIM.
However, 10 companies are already being traded on the new market, all
with market-makers.
Norcity II and Norhomes were keen to create a market in their shares,
to provide investors who put in capital under the Business Expansion
Scheme five years ago with an exit route. The move will also provide a
get-out for shareholders with a pressing need to sell.
Brian Fitzgerald, a director of both companies, said: ''It is a much
more economic prospect to join AIM than to seek a full listing. This
particular unquoted market has a lot of advantages for us.''
One estimate is that the investigations and reports necessary for a
launch on AIM can cost as little as #50,000, although this would not
provide for the raising of capital. This compares with an entry cost of
about #800,000 for the official list.
Meanwhile, Perth-based livestock market company United Auctions hopes
to be listed on AIM before September.
The Rule 4.2 company is looking to give its 900-plus investors a
market for their shares, although it may also raise funds on AIM in the
longer-term.
Glasgow-based multimedia firm Inner Workings, which is seeking
capital, is due to join AIM next week.
Kent-based Dawson Holdings, a journal subscription agent and book
supplier with substantial US interests, is the largest of the 10
debutants. With a market capitalisation of #22m, Dawson, which is
expected to achieve turnover of more than #325m in its current financial
year, made pre-tax profits of #4.3m in the year to end-September 1994.

BRITISH Steel is probably the world's most profitable steel company
yet chairman Brian Moffat is ''looking forward to a considerably better
year.'' That is after a sharp recovery in profits last year from #80m to
#578m with the second half alone contributing #419m. This is a solid
base for predicting current year progress well beyond the #1100m level.
But while British Steel is moving ahead like a tank, UK customers are
suffering from damage to their invoices as prices are pushed ahead well
above the rate of inflation. The company posted rises last year of 5%
but there are much heftier ones and well over double that level coming
through. However, they are still below the peak seen in 1990 when
profits reached #733m.
Steel users have avoided the worst of these imposts through
alternative sourcing. That has given Mr Moffat a new enemy to fight.
He seems to be winning the battle over EU hand-outs with the
proportion of subsidised European steel-controlled production falling
from 45% to 20%. Certainly he was much milder than usual in his comments
on the subsidy issue involving Brussels but he is still unhappy about
the Middlesborough Football Club affair.
Sponsorship of the club in the North-east English steelmaking town was
withdrawn after Taylor Woodrow, which is building a new stand, employed
an Irish sub-contractor who bought materials from Irish Steel in Cork.
The Irish firm is receiving a #50m state subsidy equivalent to #175,000
per employee.
Instead, some of his guns are being trained on producers in Central
and Eastern Europe whose products have managed to restrict British
Steel's market share in UK to 54%. This raises the question of possible
dumping of cheap steel. However, while there are some signs of
over-stocking to avoid price increases coming at the beginning of next
month, the outlook for demand is good thanks to export-led industries
such as car manufacture.
Although prices in the US appear to be softening a little, those in
the UK are still the lowest in the company's main markets with Asian
steel for once at a premium although BS has yet to decide where to joint
venture in that area.
European prices rose 7% in the year to match and BS is expecting
another 5% this time round.
Overall turnover rose 14% to #4784m which equates to a 19% rise in
productivity to #120,000 of annual sales per employee. The plant at
Dalzell, which employs 450 people, is profitable and finance director
Philip Hampton said there are no plans to do anything there although
money is being spent on systems and controls. The site is working at
half of its full potential.
The acquisition of the GKN shareholding in United Engineering Steels
brought in a profit of #45m and give considerable scope for long
reorganisation including scrap. The 49.9% owned Avesta Sheffield
stainless steel producer has proved a major success with a #107m
contribution.
Expansion in the US is costing #225m. This includes the #110m
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, steel plant which is due to come on-stream in early
1997, a #65m charge for transporting some never used and mothballed
plants from the UK to Alabama and #50m for a 25% stake in a coil
mini-mill in association with LTV and Sumitomo.
The shares responded by rising 4[1/4]p to 170[1/4]p as the results and
the total dividend payout which has been raised from 2p to 7.5p with a
5.5p final for a 5.5% yield were above most forecasts.
The question is how well BS will ride the next downturn in European
demand. But with its having spent aggressively on cost reduction in
recent years, it will ride any coming recession better than most
companies.

STERLING fell against both the dollar and the Deutschmark yesterday as
dissension over John Major's leadership upset sentiment on foreign
exchange markets.
There was nervous selling of the pound in Asian trading, and by the
close of business in London sterling had lost 0.71 cents to $1.60 and
1.17 pfennigs to DM2.2420.
The trade-weighted index fell 0.5 to 84.3. At this level it has lost
4.75% of its international value so far this year.
Most of the pound's losses can be attributed to the weakness of the
dollar, but from time to time the Government's political woes have upset
the sterling applecart.
Bickering within the Conservative Party over Europe has seldom been
below the political surface this year.
Financial markets hate nothing more than uncertainty. A prolonged
power struggle over the Prime Minister's future is the last thing the
pound needs.
There was also some nervousness ahead of the publication tomorrow of
the minutes of the controversial meeting on May 5 between the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England.
The two men are thought to have been at loggerheads over interest
rates.

EDINBURGH-based Pittencrieff Resources, which is considering merging
its Canadian interests with another company, yesterday announced it had
appointed Houston-based Madison Energy Advisors to assess the realisable
value of its oil and gas assets in North America, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The group, which announced it was seeking share buy-back authority
when it announced results in April, believes the value of its reserves
may not be fully reflected in its share price.
Chief executive Terry Heneaghan said: ''I would think, within the next
two months, we will have a pretty good idea what this company is
worth.''
He cited the fact that oil and gas assets had recently been changing
hands at between $4 and $5 per barrel of oil equivalent, believing that
Pittencrieff's share price reflects a lower number. Shares yesterday put
on 2p to 83p.
The advice from Madison will provide Pittencrieff with information
upon which to base decisions relating to its strategy of achieving a
better balance between Canadian interests, which account for about
one-fifth of assets, and US operations, which account for the remaining
four-fifths.

BANK of Scotland Governor Sir Bruce Pattullo has some convincing
reasons why proprietors should vote against a fellow shareholder's
boardroom pay resolution at today's annual general meeting, general
manager and secretary Hugh Young said.
Mr Young hoped the tercentenary agm, in Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel,
would pass with very few controversies.
The details of Sir Bruce's response to the controversial resolution,
put forward by small shareholder John Mann, are not known.
Meanwhile, London-based corporate governance consultancy Pirc, which
represents UK pension funds, is supporting a move by Bank of Scotland
which would end the right of individual proprietors to put forward
resolutions.
However, expressing a personal view, Nigel Dewar Gibb, Scottish
chairman of the United Kingdom Shareholders' Association, said anything
which tended to restrict individual freedom to question was a mistake.
UKSA, which only recently launched a recruitment drive in Scotland, is
aiming to increase the power of private shareholders.
The bank proposes that any future agm resolution should have the
support of at least 100 proprietors collectively holding shares with a
nominal value of #10,000, equivalent to a market value of #88,800.
Alternatively, a proprietor or proprietors holding 5% or more of the
total voting rights may put forward a resolution.
Mr Mann acknowledges that the bank is not generally guilty of making
excessive awards.
He is proposing that future increases in total directors' emoluments,
including share options, should not exceed the sum of half the increase
payable to Bank of Scotland's ordinary shareholders plus half the
average increase in employees' pay.
Mr Mann admits his motion has a ''nil'' chance of success.

INVESTORS, including a clutch of Scottish institutions who backed the
new management team at Hicking Pentecost in 1990 at 68p, should be
feeling reasonably content, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The shares are at 235p and the dividend yield after the 20%
improvement last year to 5.5p at 10% and is set to rise perhaps by a
similar amount for 1995-96.
Pre-tax profits last year rose 31% to #4.52m with almost half the
operating profits coming from the textiles division. Despite the warm
autumn and winter, margins were held at 10.9% with the up-market Alan
Paine men's sweaters performing well in stark contrast to the problems
of Dawson International's Pringle.
Divisional profits in the current year will continue to be affected by
the general depression in the High Street although Paine does benefit
from half its sales going overseas.
Industrial threads saw a 10-month contribution from the acquisition of
Barbour Campbell.
Chairman Hamish Grossart is confident for the current year. Profits
should reach about #6.2m to leave the shares trading at 11.8 times
likely earnings with an historic 2.9% yield.
This is a nice, solid stock to tuck away.

THE Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow, launches its Strathclyde Summer Season
this week amid speculation that it could be the last. Now in its eighth
year, the 10-week season is specially funded by Strathclyde Regional
Council which is soon to be replaced by several new unitary authorities.
It is not yet known whether those authorities will continue where
Strathclyde left off.
The season runs from July 18-September 23, presenting six plays in
either the main theatre or the circle studio. Strathclyde's funding has
enabled free matinee performances of all the productions, as well as
creche facilities, workshops, discussions and both audio-described and
signed performances for the visually impaired and the hard of hearing.
''This year we are working closely with the Education Department,''
said general manager Sharman Weir, explaining that twelve pupils from
Strathclyde secondary schools will be taking part in a four-week project
to develop stagecraft skills culminating in three performances in the
studio theatre.
''None of this would be possible without the financial support of
Strathclyde Regional Council,'' she said. ''We very much hope that the
new authorities will support us to allow these initiatives to
continue.''
The first of two opening productions is Fever Pitch, an adaptation of
Nick Hornby's best-selling book about football addiction which, since
playing Mayfest last year, has had a stint in the West End and has been
lined up for the Edinburgh Fringe. See it in Glasgow between July 18-22.
Opening on the same night and running until August 12 is a production
of Liz Lochhead's oil-widow two-hander Quelques Fleurs starring Carolyn
Bonnyman and Lewis Howden.
The Arches Theatre Company has become a regular fixture in the season,
having enjoyed sell-out successes with Accidental Death of an Anarchist
and The Hostage in previous years. This time Andy Arnold's company will
be playing up the black comedy in Joseph Kesselrig's Arsenic and Old
Lace from July 25-August 5.
Musical fun follows from August 15-19 when Take Two Productions
presents Growing up in the Super Seventies the show that originally went
out under the name of A is for Abba until the Swedish pop group's
lawyers complained.
Resident director Robert David MacDonald turns his hand to an
adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Ebb Tide, a tale of smuggling and
murder in the South Sea Islands, from August 31-September 23.
And completing the season is a home run for the Citizens' Edinburgh
International Festival production, a new translation of Schiller's Don
Carlos directed and designed by Philip Prowse from September 1-23.

<HEADLINE>Airtours posts a larger loss and warns of tight margins</HEADLINE>

ALTHOUGH the weather has been poor in June it has not sparked a
stampede to travel agents by people seeking the sun. This is bad news
for companies like Airtours, Britain's second largest tour operator, as
it is likely to spark a price war as tour operators try to boost
business.
Indeed, Airtours yesterday warned of a threat to its margins as it
reported an interim loss of #34.9m. The company's chairman, David
Crossland, said that industry margins could come under some pressure
despite a degree of capacity reduction, given that the overall market is
showing little if any increase in demand.
Airtours' interim loss was larger than the #17.6m reported at the same
time last year reflecting the inclusion of losses from Scandinavian
Leisure, which was acquired in June of last year. Turnover in the half
year was 81.3% ahead of the comparable period last year at #426.5m.
Traditionally, holiday companies report losses in the first half of the
year.
Airtours Holidays continues to perform well in a sluggish market. Its
share of the winter holiday market increased to 22.2%. Long haul
holidays proved to be popular.
Summer bookings are said to be 4% up on last year. Airtours is
benefiting from the above average growth in the cruise market with
younger people being attracted to this type of holiday. Its fly-cruise
operation is virtually sold out for this summer. Although it is early
days yet the launch of the 1995/96 Airtours winter programme is said to
have started well with bookings up 15%.
Going Places market share rose to 15% helped by the opening of new
branches. The EuroSites self-drive business is expected to have another
satisfactory year with a further increase in higher margin mobile home
capacity and bookings 14% ahead of the previous year.
The Scandinavian Leisure Group occupies the leading position in its
market and enjoys a high level of repeat bookings. Bookings for summer
1995 are up 8% and margins are expected to be better than last year's as
a result of various management initiatives.
There is an interim dividend of 3.0p per share, up from the previous
1.1p, which represents a proportional split adjustment between the
interim and final payouts.
The Airtours group has a wide spread of businesses serving the tourism
market. Mr Crossland said this spread meant that the group was no longer
dependent upon any single source of profits. Given that Going Places and
Airtours Holidays continue to outperform the market and the group's
balance sheet is strong, Mr Crossland said he looked forward to the
future with confidence.
Despite his optimistic tone, the City chose to focus on the warning of
possible margin pressure and Airtours shares slipped back. Although they
recovered some of their earlier losses by the close of London trading,
they were still 2p cheaper at 418p.

YUPPIES may be no more but one of their identity tags, namely the
Filofax, lives on. Indeed strong demand from young people and housewives
enabled Filofax group to increase its profits last year by 51% to #4.9m.
Earnings per share grew by 34% to 13.5p and the dividend was raised by
50% to 2.625p after a final shareholders' payment of 1.575p.
Good volume growth has more than offset the higher costs of raw
materials such as paper. Filofaxes have become much more accessible to
the general public as cheaper products have entered the market. Back in
the late 1980s consumer boom, a Filofax cost #55.
Nowadays the cheapest leather product is #20, although it is possible
to spend up to #133, and polyurethane filofaxes are available for #15.
In addition, there is a greater range of sizes with the latest leather
models one quarter the size of some of their larger counterparts.
The most popular inserts for Filofaxes remain dairies, ruled paper and
maps. Although it is possible to get a variety of inserts including
shopping guides and calorie counters.
The UK market for filofaxes is one of the most mature although chief
executive Robin Field is confident about the business prospects in the
UK. Last year sales of filled and empty binders again exceeded those of
refills.
There are thought to sizeable growth opportunities in Continental
Europe where Filofax is buying up its third party distributors. Mr Field
said there was ''no suggestion of market saturation'' in any of the
geographic areas where the company operated. The company is looking to
enter the emerging markets of Latin American and South Africa.
Filofax is also experimenting with some electronic databases which
could be stored within an existing filofax. This may include a facility
to electronically scroll a list of names and addresses.
Although Filofax organisers account for about three quarters of the
group's sales and profits, it does have other interests. One business
which it is very optimistic about is its recently acquired Henry Ling
greetings card business.
It contributed #5m to sales and #800,000 to Filofax's group profits.
Henry Ling specialises in reproduction fine art cards aimed at older
customers. It has a share of just under 1% of the UK's #1000m greetings
card market. The UK leads Europe in the number of greetings cards it
sends at 43 per head of population per year. This compares with just
under five in France.
Elsewhere in the group, the Drakes telephone message pad business
continues to make a useful contribution but does not have the growth
potential of Henry Ling.
The Yard-O-Led writing instrument business traded well in both the UK
and overseas. Filofax hopes that its pens will occupy the #100-#200
niche that used to be filled by Mont Blanc.
Yesterday, Filofax shares were quoted at 232p, down a penny.

THE moment we sit down, Hilary Strong, director of the Edinburgh
Festival Fringe, asks: ''What do you think about the programme
changes?'' It's not idle small-talk either. She really wants to know.
Not because she is short on confidence -- she'd hardly have lasted to
her second festival if that were the case -- just because she has an
instinct for open discussion and constructive feedback.
Which is just as well. Hers is, after all, an unusually sensitive job
-- one that requires her to tread the fine line between diplomacy and
leadership, between catering to the North West Leicestershire Youth
Theatre and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Clyde Unity Theatre and Greg
Proops; between representing an ad hoc body of unrelated performers on
the one hand and trying to put her own stamp on the organisation on the
other.
She is a director who doesn't direct, a programmer who doesn't
programme, an individual responsible for the biggest arts festival in
the world who has no say in what gets performed.
And even something as innocent as tampering with the presentation of
the Fringe programme requires a tremendous amount of tact. Few people
head to Edinburgh with the real expectation of making money, but
anything that might jeopardise the small financial returns made will
naturally be treated with suspicion -- particularly by the big operators
like the Assembly Rooms, the Pleasance and the Gilded Balloon.
Strong is in the delicate position of having to explain that her
changes aren't so much against the supervenues as they are in favour of
the smaller outfits.
What she's done is to subdivide the programme into genre categories.
Rather than working your way through all the 1237 shows listed, you can
now head straight to your favourite artform -- music, comedy, dance,
theatre and so on -- and work in from there. There's still a lot of
choice, of course, but it does make the programme slightly more
digestible.
On the surface it's a restructuring that benefits the ordinary
Fringe-goer, but there's a potentially more significant effect on the
companies themselves. Where previously the supervenues took up
monolithic chunks of paper, now their wares are spread throughout the
programme, which is also placing a greater emphasis on companies than it
is on venues.
The result is a kind of democratisation of the Fringe, proportional
representation if you like, that gives the church halls and Masonic
lodges as much a chance of grabbing your attention as the established
centres.
''I think it's got to benefit the smaller companies,'' says Strong.
''If you, as a punter, are able to find your way into things more
easily, then that's going to help you be more selective and more
brave.''
This achievement shouldn't be underestimated. There's been grumbling
about the direction of the Fringe for years (''Who is to cut the
Fringe?'' asked The Scotsman in 1959, outraged that the event could have
reached the unkempt proportions of 23 shows, and the pundits have been
sounding off ever since).
But the laissez-faire nature of the event -- no one is invited, no one
is refused -- has always made its administrators wary of interfering too
much. Their caution was well justified, which is why it is all the more
to Strong's credit that she is starting to resolve many of the problems
that face the organisation without undermining the things that make it
special in the first place.
''It seems to me that I am here to champion the cause of the little
groups,'' she says. ''The big names will do well regardless. The people
I'm concerned about are the young student companies, the struggling ones
who really have to try, and these changes have to be undertaken with
them in mind.
''They are in the majority anyway. It's not my place to say what's
good or bad. It's not my place to say certain things should be
encouraged or discouraged. What I'm interested in is doing things that
will enhance the experience for everyone.''
A first move to making things easier for the smaller companies has
been a reduction of the basic participation fee by 10% (and a further 5%
for early booking) and next on Strong's agenda is her intention to
address the issue of exorbitant venue rental and accommodation fees.
''The venue managers are not making any money,'' she explains. ''Most
of them lose money. The people who make money are the landlords, and we
have to address that. If it gets too expensive people won't come.''
Strong knows what she's talking about. Back in 1990 she formed her own
Fringe company, Western Union, to perform Dennis Potter's Blue
Remembered Hills. They raised #1500 to get to Edinburgh and thought they
were doing quite well to attract 25 people a night and to pick up a
handful of reviews.
They returned the following year with a new play, and Strong made
further visits on a professional footing with Bath's Natural Theatre
Company, where she worked as administrator.
''I know how it can be done,'' she says. ''But it's got to be that
it's achievable for anyone, not just for people with money. If it gets
to be the domain of rich kids then I think we should lock the doors and
go home.''
Strong arrived in Edinburgh only a matter of weeks before the 1994
Fringe, so this is the first event she's been able to get her teeth
into. It is, she says, exactly the job she's been trained to do. Having
left school at 16 and skipped the conventional university-arts route,
she has a track record that embraces virtually everything in the
business -- directing, choreography, acting, stage-management and PR.
''This job's perfect because I know a little bit about an awful lot,''
she says. ''If people ring up and say what should I do about the fact
that my venue's too small, or that I'm being sued for libel, I know
enough to be able to help them. Also I'm very keen on amateur arts,
people doing it for the love of it not for money, and I believe in that
very strongly. It informs so much of what happens in British culture and
that spirit is so crucial to the Fringe.''

JEBSENS, the Norwegian shipping group, said yesterday it would launch
a friendly takeover bid for Altnacraig Shipping, the troubled Scottish
company whose ageing ships it already operates on time charter.
But Jebsens and Altnacraig directors made clear that 720 small
investors who put #5m into Altnacraig five years ago under a Business
Expansion Scheme (BES) would not get all their money back through an
early cash exit.
Jebsens announced its intention to buy Altnacraig, which already
operates as an arms-length subsidiary of the Norwegian company, at
Altnacraig's annual meeting in Glasgow yesterday.
Jebsens' chairman and chief executive Atle Jebsen said negotiations
with the Altnacraig board on a deal to swap Altnacraig for Jebsens
shares with a limited cash option were already advanced.
Jebsens, whose directors presently own 17.9% of Altnacraig, would put
forward a final offer within a month, he added.
The approach from Jebsens follows Altnacraig's decision to drop a bid
for cash-rich Ferguson Shipbuilders in April.
Altnacraig withdrew its shares-plus-cash bid in the face of a rival
#4.9m all-cash bid by Glasgow electrical wholesaler Holland House, the
result of which should be known today.
Had Altnacraig's bid for Ferguson been successful, the shipping
company would have been able to raid several million pounds of cash
balances at the Port Glasgow shipyard to pay off any of its own BES
shareholders who wanted out.
The five-year period during which the mainly Scottish BES shareholders
were required to hold Altnacraig shares in order to qualify for a tax
benefits of up to 40% on their initial investment expired last month.
BES shareholders own about 70% of Altnacraig and the cash-strapped
company is under pressure to provide a way out for any who wish to quit.
Altnacraig chairman Sir Ross Belch told the AGM: ''Jebsens might be
able to offer a cash payment up to a certain limit to those shareholders
who wish to have a total exit now.''
Mr Jebsen said there would not be a full cash option for all
Altnacraig shareholders, but his company might offer some convertible
preference shares to give them a second exit opportunity further down
the line.
Sir Ross said that since Jebsens is planning a Stock Exchange
flotation this year or next, Altnacraig shareholders accepting Jebsens
shares should be able to sell them easily.
But one shareholder pointed out that Jebsen was planning to list its
shares on Nasdaq, a US exchange where any small UK shareholder selling
out would have to pay high transaction fees.
Altnacraig has has made persistent losses since it was founded in 1988
at a time of excess capacity in the world shipping business and has
never paid a dividend.
It suffered another loss of #287,854 last year on turnover of #3.8m,
which reduced its net assets to less than half of shareholders' funds.
More than #1m of refinanced loans fall due this year, but Altnacraig
directors said repayment would not be a problem, even without a Jebsens
buyout.
No suggestions were voiced at the AGM that Altnacraig should cease
trading.
On the contrary Sir Ross forecast a breakthrough to profitability this
year following an upturn in the world shipping market.
''The prospects for this current year look pretty good . . . we should
hopefully make a reasonable profit in 1995,'' the 75-year-old chairman
said.
Mr Jebsen also painted a rosy picture of the world shipping market,
especially for smaller older ships of the sort operated by Altnacraig.
''The market for bulk carriers is at this moment very good, certainly
relative to what it has been for the last 20 years,'' he told the AGM.
''We think that until 1997 there will not be any large-scale building
of larger bulk carriers and therefore no pressure on smaller vessels,''
he added.
Mr Jebsen noted that smaller craft were particularly well-suited for
operation to shallow ports in Russia and the Ukraine, where he predicted
a boom in trade.
Throughout its seven-year life, Altnacraig has worked closely with
Jebsens.
The Oslo-based company controls about 120 ships worldwide, most of
which are employed on long-term contracts to carry tonnage on fixed
routes for large industrial companies.
Altnacraig leases four small dry bulk carriers from organisations
controlled by Jebsens which in turn are operated by Jebsens on time
charter.
These vessels of 6000 to 7000 tonnes deadweight have an average age of
19 years, pretty near the present acceptable limit.
However Mr Jebsen said the profitable working life of such ships could
probably be extended to about 25 years.
All four Altnacraig ships are operated on time charter to Jebsens in
the Jebsens Wilson EuroCarriers Pool.
Small wonder then that Altnacraig only requires one part-time employee
in addition to its executive directors.
Sir Ross has had a long working relationship with Jebsens and once
built ships for the Norwegian firm when he was managing director of the
Scott Lithgow shipyards before their nationalisation.
In addition to Altnacraig he also chairs Altnamara Shipping, another
company with BES funding that has a ship on time-charter to Jebsens.
Altnamara, which was founded in December 1993, has #920,000 of
shareholder funds raised under the auspices of the BES and its less
generous successor, the Enterprise Investment Scheme.

ENERGY, enthusiasm and innovation abound in this Degree Show, with the
Sculpture Court a natural focal point, where for the first time, there
is a group exhibition of different artists and disciplines, with the De
Witt Godfrey's mesmeric metal sculptures dominating.
The sculpture exhibits are particularly breathtaking, ranging from the
eerie reconstruction of a hotel corridor by Patricia Wale to the
perfection of Naoko Takematsu's bronze snake, lying in contorted
soldered sections leading to a shining burnished head.
Here is originality and talent -- Nicola Ramage's perspex bubble
jewellery, filled with sago or tissue paper leaves, sparkle in their
metals, while Thomas Jenner's temple-like installation M, a memorial to
the River Kwai, with rows of poppy postcards echoing those soldiers'
letter home.
Perceptions and the subconscious are challenged -- Alice Jean Shaw's
dark tapestry In The Garden Of A Dying God is full of lurking
malevolence; Jane Watt's 3-Mile Staircase makes steps from fishing line
that oscillates in the light, and Oliver Marsden's stunning paintings,
examining the balance of form and space, spatter paints into images like
the surface of the moon.
If I had to single out one section it would be Glass. All is
outstanding, but in particular Colin Rennie's writhing, slithering but
ultimately beautiful pieces -- Hydras and Cethalopods -- glow out of the
darkness; Philip Atrill's cascading walls of glass and pliant vases make
shimmering patterns, and the strong use of colour in vase and dish of
Gerhard Trautwein.
This is an uplifting show, mature, creative and very welcome.

Anne Johnstone examines today's Oxfam Poverty Report which heralds a
campaign, to be launched soon in Glasgow
DOROTHY Chiredze farms just over a hectare of land in southern
Zimbabwe while her husband tries to find labouring work in the city. In
1992 there was a drought which destroyed Dorothy's maize crop. Her
husband came home because there was no work to be had in Harare.
Their three children became weak for lack of food and were unable to
walk to school. But at least this saved Dorothy the shame of admitting
she could not in any case afford the school fees which had just been
raised as part of a ''structural adjustment programme''. This year,
unable to hire oxen, Dorothy ploughed her land by hand and is hoping for
a small harvest. ''If the rains are bad again, I don't know if we will
survive,'' says Dorothy.
After the Second World War, the United Nations Charter and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, both signed in 1945, attempted to
present a vision for a new world order. The charter provided for a new
social compact. Governments were charged with upholding certain
inalienable human rights. These included the right to live in peace and
the right to a reasonable standard of living. This was backed up by an
economic framework based on the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, and GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).
Half a century on, the rights of the UN Charter are being violated on
a massive scale. Dorothy Chiredze typifies the kind of life now led by
one in four of the human population. Insecurity and vulnerability are
its hallmarks.
Meanwhile the World Bank -- founded to help developing countries give
their poorest people a leg up out of poverty -- in this and too many
other cases actually grinds the poor.
The Oxfam Poverty Report is published today to coincide with the 50th
anniversary of the UN Charter and Declaration of Human Rights. At the
same time the charity will launch a new global anti-poverty campaign in
nine centres across the world, including Glasgow, Ottawa, Johannesburg
and Harare.
''At no stage in post-war history have the challenges facing humanity
been so immense and the horizons of world leaders so limited,'' says
Oxfam, which calls for an international drive to end what it dubs ''the
silent Holocaust''.
In some ways the eradication of poverty is a more attainable goal now
than in 1945. Average incomes have tripled and global economic wealth
has grown sevenfold. Averages may go up but only because the rich are
getting much richer.
* Today the richest fifth of the world's population have average
incomes 30-times higher than the poorest fifth.
* The poorest 50 countries have 20% of the world's population but less
than 2% of global income and the figure is falling.
* A quarter of the world's population cannot meet basic needs.
* Around 35,000 children die every day from poverty-related disease.
* An estimated 13 billion people have no clean water or sanitation.
The report does offer a few chinks of light, such as the return of a
fragile peace to countries like Angola and El Salvador after years of
war. Like poor community groups organising and campaigning for basic
rights. And, of course, there is the heartening impact a charity like
Oxfam can achieve in individual communities. An example is its work in
Northern Ethiopia terracing land and planting trees to halt soil
erosion.
The report is a gloomy read. Most depressing of all perhaps is the way
it illustrates how the rich industrialised countries, far from offering
their poor neighbours a helping hand, often take actions which damage
them.
For instance one of the biggest causes of poverty in the Third World
is the international arms trade. The purchase of arms diverts huge sums
from the budgets of developing countries. Pakistan spends six times as
much on the military as health, education and agriculture combined. And
according to Oxfam, members of the UN Security Council account for 80%
of arms transfers.
The gigantic trade in anti-personnel mines must represent a
particularly unpalatable evil. Around 110 million of these are scattered
across the countryside of developing countries, waiting for some peasant
farmer or child to stumble on them. ''It's like being dead. Without legs
what can I do?'' whispers one such farmer in an Angolan hospital after
he had stepped on a mine. But while Oxfam is demanding a ban on the
production, stock-piling and use of anti-personnel mines, the British
Government, mindful of the balance of payments, prefers to talk about
the development of ''smart mines'' which will self-destruct after a set
time -- however inefficient.
For many years Oxfam has campaigned about the social and economic
damage inflicted on the world's poorest countries by the debt crisis.
Last year Uganda, for instance, spent #102m on debt service payments but
only #750,000 on health and education despite one of the worst infant
mortality rates in the world.
The G7 summit last week set as its main objective the reform of world
economic institutions, including the World Bank and the IMF. It's a big
job. These two bodies, intended to relieve world poverty and promote
development, have responded to the debt crisis by imposing schedules
which have inflicted huge cuts in health, education and social welfare
on the world's poor.
Recently both agencies have talked about poverty reduction in the
adjustment process and there have been reforms. But according to Oxfam,
these have not been radical enough to make a big difference.
For example, it didn't stop Zimbabwe being forced to cut spending on
primary health care and basic education by a third between 1990 and
1993. Remember Dorothy's kids and the school fees. Charges for using
ante-natal clinics were introduced at the same time.
Oxfam documented how maternal mortality in childbirth shot up as a
result and the World Bank eventually recommended the withdrawal of user
fees. But it is still advocating ''market principles'' in health and
educational programmes.
Among other measures, Oxfam is calling for the conversion of many of
the World Bank's hard debts to soft loans and the sale of 10% of the
IMF's gold stocks to finance a debt-reduction facility.
The report also says: ''It is the poor who are most immediately
threatened by global environmental degradation . . . Yet it is the rich
. . . who bear prime responsibility for causing it.'' So, for example,
Bangladeshi peasant farmers in the Ganges delta struggling to protect
land by building embankments could have their efforts overwhelmed by
rising sea levels caused by global warming as a result of carbon dioxide
emissions from industrialised countries.
The rich leave bigger ecological footprints than the poor. So an
American has an environmental impact 250-times greater than an African.
Oxfam says the industrialised world has a responsibility to adopt
lifestyles and energy conservation measures more compatible with a
sustainable future for the planet. It wants them to set time-bound
targets for minimising the negative impact of their footprints.
Moreover, though in theory the rich Northern governments adhere to the
principles of free trade Oxfam says: ''In practice developing countries
face a bewildering array of arbitrary and protectionist measures, which
skew the benefits of international trade towards the industrial world.''
For example, the Multi-Fibre Arrangement sets limits on exports of
textiles and clothing from the developing world and costs them #31bn a
year in lost exports. The Uruguay GATT talks left the vestiges of the
MFA intact until 2005.
After 20 years of unspectacular growth, bilateral aid from OECD
countries fell by 6% last year. More cuts are in prospect, particularly
from the US. This seems crazy at a time when the gap between rich and
poor countries is widening. Oxfam is also worried about the quality of
aid.
''Much of what passes for development assistance has more to do with
the pursuit of self interest,'' it says. For instance, three-quarters of
UK aid is tied to the development of commercial markets. (Remember
Pergau?). Meanwhile, just 7% of OECD aid goes on primary health and
basic education.
The tone of much of this report is exasperation. ''Poverty is created
by people and people can defeat it,'' says Oxfam's director, David
Bryer. But one detects little optimism that world leaders will listen,
let alone act. Perhaps the saddest quote in the entire report is from
President Roosevelt who wrote after signing the UN Charter in 1945:
''This is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for
a world attainable in our time and generation.''
Leaflets on the anti-poverty campaign are available at Oxfam shops or

Kennedy Wilson thumbs through the rack of designer clothes for
children
IT could only happen in Paris . . . or LA, or Milan, or Tokyo:
indulgent parents dressing up their progeny in expensive top-name
designer togs. Of course it is nothing new. Specific forms of dress for
children first appeared in the late eighteenth century. Before then,
children wore cut-down versions of adult clothes.
The Victorians took the good Queen's lead when she dressed her sons in
sailor suits, but today's wealthy parents go for children's labels with
names like Armani Junior, Versace Young, Moschino Bambino or even Dir
Baby. There's also miniature blue jeans from Levi and Guess.
For several years High Street stores -- Next, Benetton, The Gap --
have had successful children's ranges that offer a more trendy variation
on the tots' togs of Mothercare and M&amp;S. Last year the UK market for
children's clothes was worth a staggering #2500m, up 11% in real terms
in six years, according to Mintel International, a market research firm,
which has just produced a report on childrenswear.
A growing number of children's boutiques up and down the country sell
cut-down outfits from the likes of Giorgio of Beverly Hills, French
Connection, Paul Smith and Burberry. Fashionably dressed mums and dads
want fashionably dressed children and, it seems, are prepared to pay as
much as #30 for a shirt or #20 for a pair of run-of-the-mill Bermuda
shorts that will be outgrown in six months.
Kiddie couture is, naturally, very much more expensive than the
equivalent in High Street chainstores. A big name designer label outfit
for your toddler could cost as much as #250.
Theories as to who's buying and why vary. With more women having fewer
children later on, spending on each individual child increases.
Moreover, there is also a growing number of well-off grandparents to
help keep kiddies in the sartorial manner to which they are growing
accustomed.
Catherine O'Dolan, features editor of Practical Parenting magazine
says: ''I suppose it's not so ridiculous that mums who are used to
wearing designer gear would want to dress their babies in designer stuff
as well.''
One boutique assistant told me: ''It's mostly younger mothers who buy
the most expensive lines. They're not especially well off, just average
people who want something different.''
It's not just designer party outfits but everyday wear that sport chic
labels. Sue Tait started Sprogs, a small shop in Edinburgh's West End
which specialises in discounted one-offs from samples from designer
labels, because she felt that the cost of some of the designer outfits
for younger children were so exorbitant. Although kiddie couture is big
in Europe, Sue doubts that the trend will be big in the UK'' -- not
unless there's another boom like the eighties,'' she says.

Ros Davidson considers conflicting attitudes about how to solve the
high rate of teenage pregnancy in America
The overhaul of welfare policy is punitive towards teenage mothers
TEENAGERS still account for one-third of America's out-of-wedlock
births, despite programmes to combat the trend. Indeed, most unwed
mothers are in their teens or early twenties, poor and uneducated, says
a US government report.
Another sobering new study also reports that teen pregnancy and risky
behaviour are often prompted by sexual abuse of adolescents. The
account, by two paediatricians in the prestigious Journal of the
American Medical Association in early June, cites new studies showing
abused teenagers are far more likely to be become pregnant or cause
pregnancy, to be promiscuous, use illegal drugs and attempt suicide.
Especially pressing for teen advocates is that all versions of the
overhaul of welfare and family policy under consideration on Capitol
Hill are punitive towards teenage mothers, or reduce their options for
education, contraception or abortion.
Republicans in the House of Representatives, taking a highly
conservative course under Newt Gingrich, want to prohibit all federal
welfare to mothers under 18 years old.
Individual states would instead revive block grants for orphanages to
encourage adoptions, prevent out-of-wedlock births and care for teens'
children.
Even a proposal by Democratic Senator Patrick Moynihan, father of the
last major welfare overhaul in the late 1980s, would force mothers under
18 to live with parents. And those under 20 would have to attend school
or state-approved job programmes.
Demetrius Garrett, 18, was just 15 years old when she gave birth to
Dominique. The outspoken African-American says that not getting welfare,
as proposed in the Republicans' bill, would not have changed her
behaviour -- she was not even aware she might be eligible when she had
unprotected sex with a boy seven years her senior.
At the time she was living in a foster home because her mother was
alcoholic. Now Demetrius and her daughter live at St Elizabeth
Adolescent Parenting Programme in San Francisco. She says she would not
dream of giving her baby to an orphanage or for adoption.
She also says forcing teens to live with their parents would not
always work: ''What if you have a drug addict mother?''
The US has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in the
Western world. Every year about 500,000 girls give birth while the same
number have abortions or miscarriages.
.
The ''Contract with the American Family,'' unveiled in mid-May with
the backing of right-wing religious groups, would also cut funds for
preventative health care -- including family planning -- and attempt to
limit abortion.
Dr Margaret Pruitt Clark of Advocates for Youth, testifying before
Congress, blasted the proposals for erroneously assuming teenagers are
more likely to get pregnant if welfare is available.
Teenagers' self-esteem, poverty, an abusive home background, and the
irresponsibility of males involved are fundamental, say the experts.
Teen advocates also say that blaming the girls is especially cruel given
that about three-quarters who had intercourse before age 14 and 60% of
those who had it before age 15, say they were raped.
Education in America's schools is severely lacking, says Planned
Parenthood. Only seven of the 50 states have curricula acknowledging
that exploration of sexuality is natural. And six states actually
prohibit talk of contraception for unmarried minors.
When Kathleen Sylvester began researching welfare reform for the
Progressive Policy Institute, she asked a headmistress how she would
reduce teen pregnancies. The principal's immediate answer: ''Shoot
Madonna.'' Sylvester sees the response as a gauge of the frustration in
a culture of consumerism that sells sex to kids as successfully as it
does Reeboks.
St Elizabeth's, one of two charitable centres for troubled teens in
San Francisco, receives both government and private funds. Accommodating
14 teens and 10 babies, it offers parenting classes, supervised play for
the mothers and kids, and attempts to build self-esteem. Child care,
pre-natal care, social workers and vocational counselling are available.
Bob Eichinger, development director at Mount St Joseph-St Elizabeth,
which runs the programme, says troubled teen mothers usually come from
backgrounds of sexual, physical or emotional abuse. .
Sex education is part of the solution, he believes. ''The reality is
not abstinence,'' he says. ''That seemingly puritanical ethic does not
play out with the kids.''
But ''just saying no'' is exactly what is preached by the burgeoning
''Christian abstinence movement'', which began two years ago in
Tennessee among Southern Baptists and -- with much media attention --
was brought to the White House last summer.
More realistic, say many teen advocates, is the programme founded by
the Surgeon General Dr Henry Foster at Meharry Medical College in
Nashville, which teaches teenagers to delay pregnancy by building
self-esteem, learning responsibility and how to deal with conflicts in
relationships, and developing job skills.

THE first time I encountered Andy Warhol, we were both arriving late
at the golden eyrie of a fashion designer called Halston, perched on the
21st floor of Olympic Tower, with its theatrical view of New York. There
was a glacial sleeplessness about him. His small hands, the colour of
bleached bone, were cold and prematurely old.
As we reached the salon, Warhol fumbled with his ever-present camera
no larger than a pocket calculator, and I offered to hold the duffle bag
sliding from his arm. He handed it to me weakly, and inside I saw a wig
identical to the ill-fitting peroxide mop balanced precariously on his
head.
And now, just the other day, there it was again, that wig, walking the
streets of New York -- but this time roofing David Bowie, who is
appearing as Warhol in the movie Build A Fort and Set it on Fire, now on
location in the city.
If thrift had been Warhol's concern, then cheapness was that wig's
over-riding merit, but with a personal fortune estimated around $28m,
the artist could surely have afforded the best hairpiece in the world.
Somehow, though, the grotesque falseness of that thatch, hardly
disguising the ruff of real dark hair at the nape of his neck,
symbolised Warhol's curious detachment from life itself.
Warhol's art, fastidious in every detail, had developed towards such
photographic precision it seemed to eliminate the unstable hand of the
painter altogether. In the elevator, that day, his own appearance -- the
death mask expression and the anorexic frame -- suggested a studied
portrait of mortality, the artist as cadaver.
Against perfume and the plushness of the fashion crowd, Warhol seemed
ferociously inappropriate. Yet in one sense he was perfectly at home,
for here, after all, was the enfant terrible turned blue-chip
investment, the pop radical commanding at least five figures for a piece
of work.
He was at Halston's party mainly because Halston, the intermittent
Givenchy of New York, was a friend, and Warhol enjoyed tripping through
any shallow firmament of stars when he could be assured he was celebrity
among celebrities.
Despite his decrepitude, he was wearing young men's clothes:
talismanic denims, a navy cord jacket, tartan scarf, cowboy boots, and
he was also present as a photographer, taking pictures of the melee for
Interview, his fab-and-fashion magazine. But instead of jostling along
with the rest of the camera corps, Warhol remained in one corner,
stricken with furtive agitation like a person unused to daylight.
The next time we met was at a party in a New York loft, hung with
redundant sanctuary lamps. Monochrome from head to toe, Warhol was
surrounded by young, radiant-faced artists, his obligatory satellite
pitching hard for fame. The talk was of poverty; or rather the talk was
of how rich New Yorkers were being squeezed by the greedy grasp of
property speculation and champagne fizzed in plastic cups, a nouveau
pauvre motif.
By then, Warhol had remained on top of a precarious commercial pyramid
for 20 years, reliably producing scandalous novelty on canvas, on film,
and through his patronage of rock bands, but along the way he had
surrendered his original talent to opulent devastation.
Initially he played the art game with such off-hand flair, the game
itself became the subject of his art. Yet by the time of his death in
the late eighties, the founding father of pop art, the guru of
publicity, seemed nothing other than a burnt-out improvisor, no longer
in control of that hustler-ridden celebrity machine.
Then, a few years ago, he came back to haunt us when his collection of
flea market memorabilia went under the hammer, fetching nonsensically
record-breaking prices from people unsure of their own taste but daffy
enough to fork out a fortune for his.
So Warhol's ''15 minutes of fame'' go on and on, and this movie,
directed by the painter Julian Schnabel, might yet be his real
masterpiece; his final stroke of genius, coaxing someone else to play
the fool by being him, that arbiter of trash in messed-up vinyl hair.
That night, at the loft party, someone asked the painter to respond to
one expert's claim that in the light of ages his art was not first-rate.
Dead-eyed and as vocally expressionless as ever, Warhol replied that
yes, the expert was probably quite right.

When pupils visited Glasgow Caledonian University they learned more
about undergraduate life than academic matters, reports Dick Louden.
GLASGOW Caledonian University recently welcomed 130 fourth-year pupils
from seven schools for a ''taster day'' in which they sampled
mini-lectures, tutorial groups and practical work in finance and
accounting, energy and environmental technology (EET), biological
sciences and social sciences.
The link with the pupils from Braidfield High in Clydebank, Taylor
High in Motherwell, Auchenharvie Academy in Stevenston, Dunoon Grammar,
and three Glasgow schools, Whitehill, Woodside and North Kelvinside
secondaries, was funded by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council
to assist youngsters from under-represented social classes to enter
higher education.
Fifteen link students from Glasgow Caledonian, nearly all in the
second or third years of their courses, visited the schools over a
six-week period. Each taking a group of six pupils outwith normal school
hours, they used material from BP's Aiming for a College Education
programme to make the pupils familiar with various facets of higher
education, covering such questions as: Why go to university? What can
you do there? How do you get in? What kind of student will you be? They
also acted as role models, trying to raise pupil aspirations.
The link students were given a full day's training, and they provided
regular feedback and received further training during the school
visiting process. ''The students became very involved,'' said Ann
Leitch,''finding things out for pupils and stimulating their interest.
''At first many pupils were quiet, but once they opened out a really
good relationship developed. Over the period they exhibited a marked
attitudinal change towards higher education.
''Now we are building on that by running a two-day summer school in
August, during which pupils will work in teams to produce a piece of
equipment for monitoring the temperature of intensive care patients.
Whatever their subjects, they will be involved. Some, for instance, will
examine the financial aspects of the project.''
For the link students, the experience has taught them much, and they
have also built up their self-confidence. Ena Healy, senior lecturer in
EET, was enthusiastic about the potential for such links. ''In my own
department second-year engineering students are trained to help
first-year students for three hours a week. It is beneficial to both
groups, and it helps the older students with their revision.''
The only fourth-year student involved is Joanne Buchanan, who is
taking biology and is a former pupil of Dunoon Grammar. ''When I came
here nobody told me what to expect, or how to go about finding a flat. I
was glad to go back and communicate with the pupils. Some of them had
never seen a university prospectus.''
Eleanor Miller, in her second year in applied biosciences, attended
Kilwinning Academy, Ayrshire, and was acting as a link student in the
nearby Auchenharvie Academy. ''I knew very little about university
myself till I came here. I gave them as much information as I could.
Some of them came from families where nobody ever went to university. If
I was asked, I would do it again next year.''
Though the sheer size of Glasgow Caledonian might have been
off-putting to some, these 130 pupils did not find their taster day
awesome. ''We had been well prepared,'' said Louis McNamee, from Taylor
High. ''The activities we did with the link student helped put us at our
ease about university. I'm now thinking of doing a course in maths or
computing.''
''It's not as intimidating as it would have been otherwise,'' admitted
Claire Stirrat from Braidfield High. ''I had been thinking about doing
pharmacy or biology and that's still what I'll probably do.''
Alexander McLeod, from Whitehill Secondary, had also been thinking
about higher education. His interest is in surveying, and he would be
''happy if it turned out to be Glasgow Caledonian. The link student told
us things of personal interest about what it is like to be a student --
that made me more seriously interested.''
For Barry Evans, from North Kelvinside Secondary, the whole process
had been enlightening: ''The size of these labs, the quality of the
facilities generally have opened my eyes. I had been thinking about
computer science. Now my mind is clearer and more firmly set on it.''

Beneath the chatter and froth Geraldine Abrahams finds the rich taste
of success at the bottom of a coffee cup.
LAST year, a group of French tourists walked from George Square to
Albion Street in Glasgow's Merchant City in search of a restaurant.
''They couldn't find any sign of life,'' said Iain MacKenzie, proprietor
of Cafe Gandolfi.
Not that he was particularly surprised. ''If you don't know this city,
where do you eat? There is something wrong with its structure. In any
other European city, all the prestigious corner sites in the city centre
would be restaurants or cafes. In Glasgow it is more likely to be a
building society.''
He believes that despite the celebrations surrounding the 1990 City of
Culture, the city lacks culture with a small ''c'', with a shortage of
good eating places and street life. He puts much of the blame at the
door of central and local government which have priced small, individual
enterprises out of business in the city centre through what he considers
an unfair rating system.
Iain opened Cafe Gandolfi on 26 December 1979, with very little money
but a great deal of faith. It had once been a very grand cheese market
office belonging to Andrew Clement &amp; Son and had been lying derelict for
six years.
Seventeen years on, the siting of the cafe is still causing him some
worry.
''I am currently the only tenant of this building,'' he says. ''It has
always had a very dodgy future. If I had known the way things would be,
I would not have been so keen to come to the Merchant City.''
He started at a time when people were opening cafes in Paris and
London, in places where the markets were moving out, leaving a vacuum.
The lease was very cheap, so he gave up his job at Glasgow School of
Art and pulled his project together ''on a wing and a prayer''. It took
him a full two years from then until he finally opened the doors of what
was -- and remains -- a totally revolutionary concept in Glasgow.
''Cafe Gandolfi has worked because it has a basic honesty,'' he says,
''at a time when all British cities are the same. You have the same
shops in the same malls and you begin to wonder what the point is in
going from one city to another. So when you come across something that
seems to be organically from Glasgow, then that must be good.''
He had always intended that it should be more than merely a place to
eat, and used Miss Cranston as his inspiration because of her broader
vision.
''With her cafe there was a sense of culture and I wanted to do
something similar,'' he explains. ''I saw it as a real opportunity and
was very lucky with people I knew like Tim Stead and John Clark who were
full of enthusiasm.''
The unique decor and furniture at Cafe Gandolfi was Tim Stead's first
major public commission and as such, an important step forward for him.
Iain has never changed anything in the cafe, feeling that Tim Stead's
furniture (which did not have to be paid for until the cafe started
making money) and John Clark's stained glass windows, make dominant
statements. He deliberately created something that would stand the test
of time.
Another reason for opening the cafe was a basic love of the city. ''I
care very much for Glasgow and I opened the cafe because I wanted to do
something here,'' he says. ''It wasn't that I wanted to have a cafe or a
restaurant. I wanted to be self-employed, and I wanted to do something
in Glasgow that would make a mark.''
The whole project was done for #10,000. When he ran out of money he
went into partnership with Mirek Sykita, who ran a sandwich bar, and
before that had opened Glasgow's first hamburger restaurant. Through
him, the banks suddenly developed interest. Prior to the partnership
Iain had been refused funding everywhere.
If the decor is the same 17 years on, so is the menu, and again it was
carefully designed. ''I wanted to come up with a menu that people could
look at and choose how they wanted to use it. I think that is the true
essence of a cafe -- there are no rules. In the best French cafes you
can go in and, for the price of a cup of coffee, you can have some of
the most famous interiors in Europe.''
Iain is adamant that ordinary people should be able to run a small
business without being business gurus, and feels that one of the major
tragedies in Glasgow today is that so many restaurants are run by
businessmen who could just as easily be selling ball bearings for cars.
He thinks that so many fail because they lack soul.
''The first advice I would give someone thinking of opening a cafe is
to look at Glasgow and see what it is,'' he says. ''Forget all the hype
about regeneration and resurgence. Glasgow is a city that was once the
main industrial city of Britain and one of the main cities of the world
at one time, with a population then of 1.2 million.
''Today, it is about half that -- it is a city that is contracting, so
if you are going to do something, you are going to have to do it in the
city centre. Opening a cafe or resturant in the city centre ties in with
people going to the cinema and the theatre.''
Unfortunately, because of the cost of starting up in the city centre,
there are very few small, individual restaurants or cafes being opened
in Glasgow. Yet with some encouragement the possibilities are endless,
especially in the Merchant City which has the potential to be the
entertainment and cultural centre of Glasgow.
In Europe, there are small corner bars run by one or two people whose
aim is to provide a service and make a living wage. With so much
unemployment and redundancy, such small-scale, low-risk enterprises
could be one feasible answer.
Cafe Galdolfi has set a good example. Iain MacKenzie has never been
motivated by profit but has been content to make a living and enjoy what
he has been doing for the past 17 years, although not without some
hiccups.
''I have put 17 years of my life into this business, and I am very
proud that I have managed to do something, to make a mark in Glasgow,''
he smiled.

TORONTO: An American couple yesterday went to jail after becoming the
first man-woman pair to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel -- a 9ft
fibreglass capsule. Steve Trotter and Lori Martin were treated for minor
injuries then turned over to police, who were expected to charge them
with trespassing, criminal mischief, and violations of parks law.

HAMISH L TOD in his predictably apologetic letter in support of his
chief constable's claim to ''the highest possible accolade'' fails to
address adequately the seminal question of the inability of his service
to contain crime in its several varieties by maintaining an identifiable
police presence upon a manageable beat (June 14).
In delineating the undoubted ills which beset the modern service, he
destroys the concept of a durable police tradition to which Mr Casely
proudly made appeal (June 2).
Whereas this present generation of police leadership may well have its
head in the sand in its attempts to reconcile with an increasingly
liberal society, the discerning public clearly do not.
They, indeed, are perfectly aware of the personal traumas experienced
as a result of housebreaking, theft, rape, and general vandalism and
have clearly responded to the challenge in their own fashion.
Least of all do they need the publicised whitewash of ''high-profile
enforcement phases'' and dubious statistics contrived to blind the real
issues. For the acclaimed success of these short-term, stop-gap
exercises would appear to be furnished solely from police sources and
must be regarded in that light.
The strength of the traditional beat constable rested in knowing his
beat and the people resident in or on passage through it. It was a
protracted, patient, and steady process not compatible with the
quick-fix gimmick.
By watching the usual was to be able to recognise the unusual used to
the the catchphrase voiced, I am sure, very often by Mr Casely.
As such the beat constable was the fount of knowledge and the
recipient of much useful information from the public around him.
From the beat constable all else was assumed to flow. Departments
existed essentially to support the constable, not vice versa. The
reassuring image of the traditional British ''bobby'' was built on that
pattern and set the standard world-wide.
Yet this tradition has been lost irrevocably with Mr Tod's short
32-year period of service due to a cancer which is directly linked to
the creation of departments and units and the need to fill these
non-operational appendages with varying grades of senior officer.
This unnecessary fecundity of supervisory ranks has also been
replicated in the operational side and justified by a Parkinson's Law
which in reality conceals a sop to police recruitment.
These were some of the problems which Sir Patrick Sheehy addressed in
a practical manner in his attempt to return the ''bobby'' to his
traditional role upon the street and to ensure that his efficiency as
the linchpin of the system would be recognised in monetary terms.
Mr Tod credits his chief constable with bringing his force up to
strength. Yet I do not know my beat constable or even see a beat
constable. On the other hand I do know and see my postman who gives
years of regular and dependable service, this despite the fact that the
postal service shares the same equal opportunities policy in its staff
recruitment as the police and must surely be fraught with similar
domestic problems.
The police rejection of the full Sir Patrick Sheehy proposals means
that the public can only expect more of the same again. That same should
not be accepted as palatable through the agency of intensive media hype,
self-publication and the demeaning of police commendations by blanket
awards.
Let the public be jury upon the merit of the more prestigious state
awards, not policemen or former policemen themselves who seem more
concerned that we feel the width rather than the quality.

SCIENTIFIC history, it seems, can come on like a bad episode of The
Flintstones. For example, according to this week's New Scientist
magazine, the first barbecue dates back more than 400,000 years, and the
Palaeolithic humans who used it cooked rhino meat and employed heavy
pebbles as choppers.
But we concern ourselves with a menagerie of ''graceful animals''
which were discovered late last year on the walls of a cave in
south-east France. Apparently they are the world's oldest rock
paintings.
Carbon dating of minute samples of pigment reveal that Stone Age
artists in the Ardeche were creating their masterpieces between 30,000
and 33,000 years ago. The French, of course, are making much of this
fact, which seems to corroborate and indeed be encouraging nascent,
primeval feelings of cultural superiority.
However, the 300 paintings and engravings in the Chauvet cave at
Vallon-Pont-d'Arc allegedly depict a dozen species of animal (most of
which look like piebald cows with the tusks of a mammoth) which have
''never before been seen in rock paintings''.
This is raising all sort of questions within the scientific community,
who have subsequently decided that these new species were kicking and
snorting their way around the planet all that time ago, which brings me
to my point.
If men or women at that time were as sophisticated as to draw fine
works of art, why wouldn't they be just as capable of making them up?
Maybe it was the done thing at prehistoric parties to gamble tools to
see who could come up with the weirdest-looking mammal.
This is, of course, discounting the possibility of the abundance of
natural drugs or the BC equivalent of Merrydown. Whatever. But the plain
fact remains. It is the flimsiest of evidence we leave behind, and it
just seems like a really bad idea to go around changing the evolution of
animals on the strength of the work of an artist who can no longer be
held accountable.
Out of the bag
RECEIVED in the post, a snippet cut from the notepaper used by The
City of Edinburgh District Council as recently as March 29 this year,
which reads, and I quote: ''Edinburgh -- Capital of Architecture and
Design''. Would it not be kinder to let them know?
In the firing line
POLITICAL Correctness is a net into which larger prey are falling. The
Daily Telegraph newspaper is sponsoring a feminist rally which includes
lesbian rock artists, who could not otherwise get funding, to perform at
this week's Greenwich Festival.
If any doubt as to the calibre of the various artists taking part, the
line-up includes such notables as Amy Raphael, author of a rock book
about women called Never Mind The Bollocks, and a member of Fem 2 Fem,
the ''first openly-gay, all-female lipstick lesbian band'' explains the
programme.
The Daily Telegraph, I'm sure you will agree, should be congratulated
for its open-minded stance. A stance, it has to be said, which is all
too rare in the world of newspapers, and is best illustrated by the
response of the defence correspondent of the unbiased Independent, who
was recently asked what the role of homosexuals should be in the
military.
''Target practice'' he replied.
Cinderella story
THE country that murdered its own royals went ga-ga over Di when the
Princess recently visited Moscow. Its leading newspaper, Izvestia, was
probably to blame. It revamped Her Highness's CV for the consumption of
the hoi polloi, the final contents of which made her sound like
Cinderella.
''I heard that she's from a very poor family,'' said a 55-year-old man
waiting in a crowd for her visit, ''and so she had to work in a
children's kindergarten. That's the kind of job that people only do in
Russia when they can't get any other sort of work.'' The British class
system, it seems, is still something of an enigma to the average
Moscovite.
What is most interesting, probably, to royal-watchers, is the claim by
the Russian newspaper that Lady Di is a ''great master'' at making
borscht (beetroot soup) and is a wonderful ironer of shirts and scrubber
of floors. When Her Royal Highness was just plain Diana Spencer, the
article went on, not only did she ''work as a housemaid at her sister
Sarah's home for a pound an hour,'' but that she took in washing from
her friends, a state of affairs which continued ''even after she met the
Prince''.
We can only hope that self-proclaimed pauper, Fergie, takes heed. If
Diana took in washing, then she can do it too.
Turning the tables
FOR absolutely no other reason than for fun, we relay the following
exchange between the agony aunt of the Spectator magazine (a woman
called Mary, a specialist in social etiquette, who regally dispenses
advice on what to wear, cook, and clean with, how to keep your bottom
drawer dust-free, that sort of thing) and an irritated reader.
''Recently, when staying with people, after-dinner games were proposed
and I found our hosts expected us to play the game in Latin or Greek, as
ordinary English was deemed too simple.
''It was clear that a certain degree of one-upmanship was at play as
those of us who couldn't possibly follow the proceedings were scolded by
the others and told that the clues were 'obvious'. How would you suggest
I might have punished my hosts for making some of their guests feel
inadequate?''
Mary responds: ''You could have made them feel inadequate themselves
by insisting on playing the Kama Sutra Game. 'What, surely you know it?'
you could have cried in surprise before pretending that this game was a
well-established feature in after-dinner game repertoires.
''Players, you could explain, are required to simulate (while
fully-clothed of course) sex positions from the Kama Sutra with an
imaginary partner while the rest of the room tries to identify the
position by name. In this way you could have undermined your classicist
friends and made them feel humbled in their turn by shouting out things
like, 'Come on, it's obvious, everyone knows this position'!''
We think that more advice columns should follow Mary's example of
no-nonsense problem-solving.

WHAT are we to make of the ''Mosquing of the Council''? Glasgow
councillors, for the first time are to make their annual show of piety
not in the Kirk, as stage-managed by Rev Bill Morris at Glasgow
Cathedral, but in the city's mosque, civic bottoms up for Allah.
Mr Morris, naturally, is not a happy camper; at the same time he
dreads sounding short on political correctness, and bleats more
puzzlement than outrage. Still, it isn't good enough for Councillor Jean
McFadden, whose brilliant wheeze the ''mosquing'' would appear to be.
Why fuss, she says sharply; do not Bill Morris and the city's Muslims
worship the same god anyway? The council, she said, would be happy to
''kirk'' themselves each year with any faith.
Leaders in Glasgow's large, Asian community made the usual happy
noises: tolerance, blah, better community relations, blah. And Cardinal
Thomas Winning, in that easy-going tone kept for reporters sound on
denominational schools, heartily endorsed the move. Cardinal Winning is
not the nicest senior Scottish churchman, but he is certainly the
cleverest.
Oh, boy. Normally one cares little for the farce of public acts of
token religion. It is only a few weeks since the appalling smorsgasbord
of VE-Day, with its pantomime multi-faith services; ecumania on speed.
There are few sights more pathetic than a large gathering of
non-churchgoers in sulky attendance before God. They don't know the
hymns. They keep their eyes open during the prayer. They look as unhappy
as schoolboys kept in detention.
Glasgow Cathedral (how can a Presbyterian Kirk have a cathedral?) has
long ceased to echo to the glorious Reformed faith. Nor is Bill Morris a
preacher to be ranked with Knox, Rutherford, Erskine, Chalmers, or
Whyte. He is the archetypal Moderate: worse, a pet Moderate, as poor
James Currie before him. Morris is token sky-pilot for the
rubber-chicken circuit of Scotland's beautiful people, kept to waste his
talent in after-dinner funnies and jolly rhyming graces. (I once had to
hear one of Bill Morris's graces, and feared the sky might fall on our
heads.)
Nevertheless, the Rev Bill Morris he has every right to be deeply
upset. To ''mosque'' the council is a proposal absurd and wrong, and
will do very great harm.
Here are some thoughts, this morning, for Councillor McFadden to munch
over the breakfast cereal.
First: Scotland is, officially, a Christian country. The Christian
faith is our national faith and that is enshrined in statute. Has Jean
McFadden never heard of the Bill of Rights or the Act of Settlement? Nor
even the Churches (Scotland) Act? Does she not know that our Head of
State, on her crowning in 1953, had to swear allegiance to the Reformed
faith by the persons of the Trinity? And received the Scriptures, with
the injunction that these were ''the lively oracles of God''?
Witnesses in court swear upon the Bible. Winners of elections to
public office take oaths before God. The very law of the land, the
common law, is founded on the Christian faith. To this day something of
the Christian faith must be taught in publicly funded schools. And
public institutions -- be they Bogside Comprehensive or the Faculty of
Advocates -- have at least an annual act of Christian worship. What
warrants a sudden lurch from established custom by Glasgow District
Council?
Second: it is pure pig-ignorance to identify the Christian God with
Islam's Allah. As five minutes with an elementary textbook would have
taught Councillor McFadden, these are deities of very different
character, disposition, and ethics. God is triune. Allah is one. God is
engaged, concerned with humanity world. Allah is remote, impersonal. God
permits his redeemed people to approach him in reverent intimacy.
Third: Islam, as practised and lived throughout the world, is scarcely
one of the nicest faiths on the planet. Can any Glasgow councillors be
so stupid as to pay it homage? Think of Islam, and you think of the
repression of women; the suicide-bombers of Lebanon; the cynical
hijacking of civilian airliners; bestial cruelty to animals; massacres
in the Balkans; and a general vista of repression. Why is Glasgow to be
identified with this?
Fourth: Councillor McFadden speaks of ''tolerance'', something
notoriously lacking in Islamic nations. In our land thousands of muslims
are free to live and worship and, for the main part, they are assets to
our society. In the Muslim lands of the East, the Christian faith -- all
minority faiths -- are repressed at best and persecuted at worst. Only
last year a Christian teenager in Pakistan faced execution for
''blasphemy''. He had dared to talk about his faith.
Does Councillor McFadden remember the Gulf war, when thousands of
young men from the West were borne to the sands of Araby to defend the
sheikhs? Forces Radio was permitted to play only the tunes of Christmas
carols, that tense December in the desert, lest the words outrage Muslim
sensibility. United Nations troops were not even allowed Christian
chaplains, only ''morale officers''. In Iraq, oddly enough, Christians
are free to worship and Saddam Hussein even had a Christian in his
Cabinet. In Saudi Arabia, which we were defending, Christianity is
literally illegal.
There is another point here, a practical point. The Church of Scotland
is the national church here, recognised by the state, endorsed by the
Queen. Thus, while not universally loved by Scots, it is universally
acceptable for any kind of public religion. As long as Glasgow District
Council adheres to the Kirk for its annual service, it offends no-one.
Now, set to tramp annually about the shrines of Glasgow, the council
stands to offend a great many people.
Why? Councillor McFadden has already let it slip; the council will
only consider ''kirking'' with religions practised by a ''significant
minority'' of Glasgow people. The criteria, of course, will prove highly
subjective. But the safety net will keep McFadden and her cohorts from
consort with anyone considered embarrassing. They will worship in the
safe, non-controversial, religious mainstream; the Kirk, other liberal
Protestants, the Catholics, the Episcopalians, the Muslims, the Jews.
They will certainly avoid the Satanists and the Spiritualists. And you
can bet your little buttons they will shun any church which is seriously
Biblical, seriously Protestant or seriously Christian.
My good friend, the Rev Donald MacLean of St Jude's Free Presbyterian
Church on Woodlands Road, is 80 this month. Why not mark the occasion,
ye people, by joining him in inviting Glasgow District Council to
''kirk'' in the F P pews at its convenient season? If Donnie does, I
think we will rapidly ascertain just how tolerant Jean McFadden is, just
how highly she esteems Glasgow's considerable West Highland population,
and just how she rates Wee Free elders alongside the mullahs of the
East. How far can you jump from posture to integrity? How far is Kyles
Scalpay from Karachi?

FARMERS took it in the neck at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall yesterday
at what was billed as Scotland's business conference of the year.
Before the massed ranks of the NFU circle the tractors and reach for
the pitchforks in self defence, I should explain the context of the
first prong of that attack. Farmers, thanks to keynote speaker Wilson
Harrell, rapidly became the day's scapegoats for all the dark forces
suspected of stifling individual enterprise in Scotland.
''What is an entrepreneur?'' came 75-year-old Harrell's core
rhetorical question to his 500-strong audience. As the author of For
Entrepreneurs Only, this former fighter pilot and business millionaire
ought to have had the answer off pat. And he did. Entrepreneurs, he went
on to explain, are the 5% to 10% of the population who retain, in their
genetic make-up, some of the attributes of the prehistoric hunter
gatherer. They have short attention spans, good peripheral vision, and
are creative, aggressive, night people, who find sleep boring.
''They don't do well at school,'' continued the man styled as
America's leading entrepreneurial guru, suggesting that many of
tomorrow's entrepreneurs are to be found among the millions of American
school kids, diagnosed as suffering from attention deficit disorder, who
are doped daily ''by the farmers'' to make them conform. Thus it was
that Joe Grundy quaked in his shoes and farmers became bogey men for the
day in Glasgow yesterday.
In Harrell's analysis, the agricultural revolution brought in new
organised ways of producing food and marginalised the hunter gatherers.
''But those genes did not die,'' he told his audience. ''If you have
that instinct in you, reach out for it. Entrepreneurs are born, not
made.''
By this time I was becoming a little confused. I was at the concert
hall to chair one of the breakout sessions. The Herald had co-sponsored
the event. I was also there because I do happen to believe that we have
an attitude problem in Scotland where business creation and commercial
success are concerned, pithily summed up in the Sauchiehall Street
definition of an entrepreneur as a chancer.
But only last Friday I attended the launch of new centres for
entrepreneurship at four Scottish universities, based on the Babson
College model in Massachusetts. At that event I heard the Scottish
Industry Minister George Kynoch insist: ''It is a popular misconception
that entrepreneurs are born rather than made, a misconception, I
suspect, which has been fostered by the cult of personality through
which the media perceive the industrial and commercial superstars of the
national economy.''
Harrell and Kynoch can't both be right. And the right answer matters.
After all if, as Harrell claims, entrepreneurs are born, not made, what
is the point of Scottish Enterprise, or any other public agency,
spending our money trying to sow the seeds of enterprise more widely in
the population? An investment in genetic engineering might seem more
appropriate.
I should add that our guru is also a little confused. In his book
Harrell admits that he once thought entrepreneurs were made. But he
worried about ''the undisputed fact that entrepreneurs breed
entrepreneurs'' and about ''the unexplained reality that most
entrepreneurs have inherently different instincts, personalities, and
characteristics than their fellow man or woman.''
In the Harrell household in Atlanta, it seems, the nature/ nurture
debate is still stuck in the time warp of 30 years back, a climate which
demands either or, one or t'other answers. Real life, I'm afraid, is
rather more complex than that.
The other keynote speaker at yesterday's celebration of
entrepreneurship, Jack Black of Mindstore, also has a stated preference
for simple ideas to explain deeply complex behaviour. He cited two
American pieces of research yesterday which changed his own life, and
set him off on the journey from Easterhouse social worker to the creator
of what now claims to be the UK's leading personal development company.
The first was the 1981 Nobel Prize for medicine work on the
functioning of the left (logical) and right (creative) segments of the
human brain. Scottish culture, Black claims, is increasingly stuck in
left brain activity. ''If we keep listening to left brain number
crunchers we're finished as a country,'' is typical of Black's
powerfully delivered invective.
The second research influence on Mindstore's founder was work at Yale
which showed that, when the 4% of a sample of students who had taken the
trouble to write down their life goals were followed up 20 years later,
all were fulfilled and financially independent. The other 96% were all
over the place.
Where Harrell is about genes, Black is about vision. The bigger the
vision the better. ''No dream, no vision, no results'' is his analysis
of our current condition. Don't worry about the how. Don't listen to
those who tell you to make your goals realistic and achievable. At least
Black's vision is, potentially, inclusive. If Harrell is right, the gene
pool will decide.
The Japanese, Black told us, don't have a word in their language for
impossible. That's why they've been able to dream big dreams. Attention
deficit disorder, Harrell tells us in his book, is rare in Japan. So, he
adds, are entrepreneurs. ''Could that be because Japan has historically
been an agricultural society, with little need to fight for freedom?''
The people who each paid #49.95 for yesterday's conference certainly
mark a fresh phenomenon in Scotland. The turnout was astonishing. Among
the audience were some old lags and some of the usual suspects. But many
-- and there was a healthy minority of women among them -- have turned
their backs on traditional corporate culture and are enthusiastically
pursuing their diverse business dreams and trying enthusiastically to
seize new opportunities to run their own lives.
I was struck, as I talked, watched, and listened to them, how
marginalised, under-valued, and misunderstood some of them feel. If some
of the cod psychology they were fed to explain the roots of
entrepreneurship encourages them to rationalise that sense of isolation
in even more excluding ways, the cause of helping Scotland rediscover
its enterprising roots will have suffered a setback.

THE Government yesterday outlined plans for events to commemorate the
50th anniversary of VJ day -- the end of the war against Japan. There
were also impassioned clashes by war veterans in the Lords over the
dropping of atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Lords Leader Viscount
Cranborne, who heads the parliamentary committee organising VJ
celebrations, said that on Saturday August 19 there would be an open air
service outside Buckingham Palace, a parade of veterans and servicemen
and an evening entertainment on the Thames. Events would involve the UK
and Commonwealth countries, including representatives of the Far East
fleets of the Royal Navy and the Merchant Marine.  ''On the Sunday, we
hope that there will be events throughout the nation, with church
services and Beating Retreats in the four capital cities -- London,
Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.''

SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley yesterday in the Commons
defended moves to limit income support help for mortgage payments by the
unemployed.He denied it would lead to more people losing homes and said
owners should be encouraged to take out private insurance against job
loss. ''It is right we should try to move from a system which at present
leaves 70% of people with mortgages, who may find themselves unemployed
or without an income, uncovered by the existing state system.''

IT was Talleyrand who first said that diplomacy was the art of the
possible. Like all arts it involves sensitivity as well as imaginative
creativity, and these qualities are in demand with the negotiations to
bring the Provisional IRA into everyday democratic politics in Ulster.
It will seem strange to outsiders that the IRA want to come into normal
political life and yet retain their considerable armoury intact. In
fact, however, there is a long tradition (now well over a century old)
in Irish nationalist politics of talking but keeping the guns against
the possibility that they might be needed again. What will seem an
affront to people on the mainland will be commonplace in Irish
nationalist circles. The weapons are a test of something all the same:
if the decision of the IRA to enter the political process is indeed firm
and irrevocable then weapons should not be allowed to be a hindrance to
it. Indeed, it might even be wondered whether there should be any need
of negotiation at all when it has always been open to the IRA simply to
declare a switch from the gun to the ballot box and accept the outcome
of votes rather than bullets.
The threat that the present negotiations might simply peter out is not
hollow. It would be tragic were that to happen, though in its process
the IRA would lose so much more than its original declaration of a
ceasefire won it. The loss would be political, but ultimately it is the
political stage on which the nationalists want to play. In that respect
it would be close to the theatre of the absurd were the internal agonies
of the Conservative Party thought to be so distracting the minds of
Ministers that the negotiations were put at risk. It is a disturbing
thought but surely close to a ploy: we are long past the stage when the
Prime Minister and his Cabinet had to be involved in the actual conduct
of negotiation. Their role was to accept negotiation and lay down the
conditions which would provide a framework for them to go forward from a
British point of view. Once these were sufficient to bring the whole
process into play, the day-to-day responsibility was sure to be
transferred to less senior politicians and civil servants.
The IRA's violent campaign to change the political status of Ulster
has lasted for more than 25 years. Its suspension has already brought
many benefits and its complete ending would be wonderful. Yet the
inescapable fact remains that both the decision to begin the violence
and to end it were unilateral decisions of the IRA -- in the latter case
much helped by official UK feelers and reassurances as well as the
political efforts of John Hume and others whose identities are more
obscure. It was the British Government's duty to respond to intimations
of a return to normal political life; and so far it has done so with due
regard to the sensitivities of the IRA, avoiding talk of surrender and
even allowing the impression, to the propaganda advantage of the IRA,
that somehow their decision to initiate the so-called peace process was
a sign of strength and not an admission that violence had failed. No
government in the Western world (and probably none anywhere) would allow
a political party (Sinn Fein) to maintain a private Army (the
Provisional IRA). That is what the IRA seem to want. Perhaps a formal,
and agreed, moratorium on the possession of arms would do the trick but
at some stage, and surely the sooner the better, the guns have to be
relegated.

THE Government will not change its demand that the IRA start to get
rid of its weapons before Sinn Fein can be admitted to substantive talks
on the future of Northern Ireland, a senior Minister said yesterday.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland Political Development Minister
-- who has had exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist political
representatives -- said Sinn Fein was being illogical in expecting talks
before arms decommissioning had started.
Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have launched a
new hardline approach, warning that if the Government did not move
quickly towards all-party talks there could be a return to violence.
They said calling for arms decommissioning was tantamount to calling
for an IRA surrender. They also announced they would not take part in
more exploratory discussions.
Mr McGuinness warned yesterday there was not the ''remotest
possibility'' of decommissioning being resolved at this stage in the
talks.
He claimed the Government had never mentioned decommissioning in
contacts with Sinn Fein leading up to the ceasefire.
''I can only conclude that it is a lame excuse used by the British
Government to prevent Sinn Fein involvement in all-party talks,'' he
said on BBC Radio 4.
However, Mr Ancram emphasised in a direct message to Sinn Fein: ''You
can't on the one hand say that you are permanently and exclusively
committed to peaceful and democratic methods as at the same time
retaining contacts with a fully armed organisation capable of terrorist
activity again''.
He said there was an ''illogicallity there which can only be met --
not by surrender, we all understand the fear of the term surrender --
but by showing that they are sincere in their commitment to peace by
beginning the process of decommissioning''.
Earlier SDLP leader John Hume, MP, backed the demand for early talks.
What was important was that the IRA had stopped using their weapons.
Mr Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist Party leader, accused Sinn Fein of
issuing a blatant threat which proved the IRA had no intention of giving
up terrorism.
* Sinn Fein president Mr Adams last night repeated his allegation that
the British Government was failing to move forward the Northern Ireland
peace process.
Speaking from South Africa -- where he earlier met President Nelson
Mandela -- Mr Adams was asked in a radio interview whether he and Mr
McGuinness were now under pressure from within the republican movement
from people who doubted the wisdom of the ceasefire because of what it
had produced in the last 10 months.
Mr Adams replied: ''No, not at all. I think the only pressure is upon
the peace process and the only pressure is coming from the London
Government's failure to move the entire situation forward into those
types of inclusive all-party talks which sensible people know can lead
to a negotiated peace settlement.''

Air traffic controllers need a cool head and a warm manner, Eric
Kennedy found out.
WE'VE all seen those movies where planeloads of terrified passengers
are being guided into stormswept airports amid scenes of
barely-disguised panic in the control tower.
Well, real life is not like that at all, says the man in charge of air
traffic control at Glasgow Airport. ''Qualifications are important,''
says Paul Louden, who is in charge of 95,000 flights a year. ''But
personality counts for a great deal.
''You have to have confidence in your own ability and judgment, and be
a fairly outgoing character. Air traffic control is a hugely enjoyable
job, and as far as I am concerned, I landed on my feet when I entered
this profession.''
He did so 27 years ago as an air traffic assistant, helping prepare
data and taking responsibility for the filing and retention of flight
plans.
All aircraft have to file a plan, detailing proposed time of take-off,
height, speed, destination, and type of aircraft.
These days there is minimal recruitment of air traffic assistants, but
applicants need at least five 0-Grades.
Paul was promoted to air traffic control student, followed by a
training period which in his time lasted three years. Technology has cut
this to 18 months and students can concentrate on aerodrome control,
approach radar control, and area control.
Paul trained in all three positions and became an air traffic
controller in 1971 at Heathrow.
He had taken part in training courses to achieve the necessary
qualifications, sitting a number of examinations to get a series of
ratings. These were aerodrome control rating and approach radar rating,
and led to an air traffic control licence. Rather like a driving
licence, it sets out the types of skills the controller is allowed to
practise.
But it doesn't end there. Should a controller be appointed to, say,
Glasgow Airport, he or she would have to undergo six months' training,
then sit local exams under a Validation Board. This is because different
airports have varying terrain.
Paul spent 19 years at Heathrow before being promoted to Edinburgh as
its general manager air traffic services in 1990. In the middle of last
year he moved on to the equivalent post at Glasgow, and spends his
working day in the control tower there.
He is no longer a practising air traffic controller as such, but is
responsible for all the services provided in this area, right down to
budgeting.
New techniques and systems, new radars and secondary radars, have
enhanced and changed the job, and air traffic has increased
dramatically.
Those wishing to go into this career require a minimum of five good
Standard Grades, and evidence of further study resulting in three
Highers or equivalent, as the starting point. They also have to pass a
medical.
Most of all, they need that outgoing personality, and a confidence in
one's judgment and ability that can be crucial in such a vital job.
We all know that. We've seen the movie.

Tourism is proving a good source of income for young people with a
Scotvec guide qualification, reports Dick Louden
THE Scottish Tourist Guides Association (STGA) takes training very
seriously. Thirty-five students from all over Scotland, including
Orkney, have just completed a one-year part-time training course and
received their awards at a ceremony in Edinburgh.
The association has come a long way since it was set up in 1959.
Originally it consisted mainly of retired people doing guiding as a
hobby. Now, with the steady increase in tourism in Scotland, it has many
younger members for whom guiding is their principal source of income.
STGA has drawn up its training syllabus in conjunction with
universities and the Scottish Tourist Board. The syllabus consists of
lectures by university staff plus instruction in guiding techniques,
such as group management and microphone control. Supervised by STGA
members with experience of training, the course offers a Scotvec SVQ
qualification at level IV (management level).
In addition, STGA's foreign language guides are tested to a very high
standard and a wide range of languages is on offer, including Japanese,
Russian, Chinese, and Gaelic.
Andrena Scott Elliot, public relations officer for STGA and a trained
guide herself, emphasised the strict vetting of linguistic fluency.
''When I trained six years ago,'' she said, ''I was having problems with
my Italian. Now we use a university expert and a guide fluent in the
language to carry out the testing procedures.'' A native of Mull, she
will spend four days in July guiding tourist groups to and around the
island free of charge.
In total, the association has contact with almost 300,000 visitors
every year. The new crop of 35 graduates takes membership beyond 300.
Through its high standards and the strict self-regulation which ensures
the maintenance of these standards, its members are the only fully
qualified professional tourist guides in the country and acknowledged as
such by the Scottish Tourist Board.
Guides are expected to share their knowledge and enthusiasm in just
the right way with different groups of tourists, and supplementary
training is available to keep them abreast of development and research,
and to offer guiding services outwith Scotland.
It can be a fascinating experience. Catherine Clark from Bearsden, a
teacher and lecturer in French and German, has acted as guide to
numerous East German groups.
''Now that the wall is down,'' she said, ''they want to tour abroad
and absorb everything they can. They think nothing of travelling up to
Inverness and back via Glencoe in a day. They are as intrigued by Nessie
as everybody else.
''I took eight of them by boat over from Balmaha, through the narrows
to the island of Inchcailloch. A woman in her seventies asked if bathing
was permitted, then she and another woman stripped naked and marched
into the freezing waters of Loch Lomond.''
According to Catherine Clark, the East Germans display ''a thirst for
knowledge, not just whisky''. They are keen to find out about our
unemployment rates, benefit system and house rental and purchase prices.
Guiding with them is not quite ''the cream of the trade'' (cruises
aboard the Hebridean Princess and trips on the Royal Scotsman) but
rewarding all the same.
STGA is structured in such a way that guides are based in five centres
-- Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth. They can offer these
services:
* Walking tours in the four major cities plus St Andrews
* Half-day, full-day and extended tours anywhere in Scotland
* Extended tours in Britain and Europe
* Special study tours
* Lectures on Scotland
It is up to the client to negotiate fees and conditions with the
guides but, in general terms, fees at present are around #45 per
half-day and #75 per full day, plus a foreign language supplement where
appropriate (#15 a half-day, #25 a day).
This year's output of guides includes some whose native language is
not English. Kayoko Hardwick met her English husband in Japan, where he
worked for 18 years. She now sees her mission as informing Japanese
tourists that ''England and Scotland are not the same country. Japanese
groups usually visit England first. After London, Edinburgh makes them
feel they have found the real Europe.''
Tanya Connelly, a qualified teacher of English in Russia, used to work
as a guide in the remote Lake Baikal region of Siberia. She came here
three years ago to perfect her English, married, and settled down in
Edinburgh. Her parents-in-law are trained guides, specialising in Dutch.
''I have my own agency, offering translating and interpreting
services,'' she said. ''Not many Russian tourists come to Scotland yet
but I hope that English tour operators will bring visiting Russian
groups up here.'' As the first native Russian speaker on STGA's books,
Tanya will be in demand.

Mary Docherty explains why she thinks local authority policies on
placing requests are wrong and divisive
BENJAMIN, my third son, is not looking forward to starting school in
August. He's not worried about leaving home, because he's been at
nursery for the last 18 months, nor is he worried about schoolwork, for
he's more than anxious to learn to read and write, and to meet new
friends.
His problem is that because our placing request for him has been
turned down, he'll be going to a different school from his two brothers,
Kenneth, six, and Matthew, five, who are both at Notre Dame Primary in
the West End of Glasgow.
Although we live 20 yards outwith the catchment area, there were no
problems with recent placing requests for Kenneth and Matthew, and we
were sure that Benjamin would also get in.
But a Strathclyde region education officer, George Gardiner, explained
that Notre Dame had room for only one primary one class, and its 33
places had been filled according to council policy -- which is to give
priority to pupils from the catchment area. The school is very popular
because it is a feeder for Notre Dame High School, an all-girls
secondary, and St Thomas Aquinas Secondary.
The parents of 35 children from outside the catchment area had
applications for places turned down, including 13 families with one or
more children in the school.
This means that Benjamin, his two older brothers, plus baby
Christopher will face a long journey to and from school. Hyndland
Primary, where Benjamin will go, is 30 minutes' walk from Notre Dame.
Because of our domestic arrangements our boys, who have to be taken to
school together, will be unable to arrive at, or leave, their respective
schools on time.
****************************
We are not alone in this predicament. As well as the 12 other families
which were refused entry to Notre Dame, parents elsewhere already face,
or will have to cope with, a similar predicament. I believe this
disruption could be avoided if Strathclyde region adopted a different
policy for allocating placing requests and gave priority to families
with children already in the school.
Under the legislation, each local authority decides the basis on which
placing requests are granted. Living in the catchment area is
Strathclyde's main requirement for ''passing go''. This is also the case
in other authorities, but I believe priority should be given to children
with siblings already at the school. Strathclyde and other authorities
have chosen not to do so.
We had, of course, an opportunity to appeal against the decision. A
committee of three, consisting of a councillor and two volunteer members
of school boards, was arranged to hear the region's case and then listen
to pleas from individual parents. There were 20 appeals, and the
committee has the right in law to overturn the region's decision.
Sixteen cases were heard at the hearing, and another four are pending.
The rather unusual aspect of this appeal was that there were no places
to allocate. Normally appeals deal with situations where there are more
applications than spare places, so it is the committee's job to allocate
the places on the basis of need -- determined by number of siblings at
the school, and whether the child comes from a single-parent family.
After the region had presented its case a heated discussion
established that there was indeed enough room in the school to
accommodate another primary one class, and there would be at least 20
children to go into it, but it would have meant the region employing
another teacher.
The more bizarre aspects of the hearing were that the councillor who
was scheduled to chair it did not turn up, and we had to wait for an
hour until another councillor, who gave the impression of knowing little
of local issues let alone this particular case or any of the appellants,
was drafted in to replace him. The two school board members said nothing
and took no active part in the proceedings. The appeal was refused.
Our only recourse now is to apply to the sheriff court to have the
decision overturned, a long and expensive process with relatively little
hope of success as the region's decision is perfectly valid in law.
With the increasing numbers of placing requests each year, the
question must arise as to whether local authorities are storing up grief
for families, and whether it is time to take a fresh look at placing
request policy.

Scourie Primary School, Sutherland (1902-04): Pupil teacher (X) Mary
Morrison. Mr Kerr's had strong feelings about pupil teachers saying: ''a
badly trained pupil teacher is not only no benefit but a positive injury
to a school.''
DOCTOR John Kerr belongs to The Skallie's era. He was a school
inspector from 1860 to 1896 -- one of only seven at first. Now the place
is infested with them and education has been flushed down the stank.
Primary advisers are nearly as bad. Who wants advice? Teachers are
reasonable folk -- they just want things done for them. Anyhow, this
adviser John Muir, a resident of Dornoch -- famous for opting out of
common sense -- has compiled some of Dr Kerr's memoirs under the title
An Inspector Recalls. It's out on Thursday.
The good doctor's ideas put him way ahead of his time, i.e. off his
chump. ''The number of passes,'' quoth he, ''is a comparatively
valueless statistic, unless it is conjoined with the average attendance,
the age of the pupils and . . . the general intelligence of the
school''. Would you credit it, dear reader? Does that not remind you of
the value-added garbage that's being peddled around today?
Dr Kerr even had dangerous modern notions about room layout. ''The
desks were often double, the pupils often facing each other, which in my
opinion was not conducive to good discipline as they talked together and
were generally restless.'' That's not the fault of the desks, doctor
dear. That's because the Lochgelly and the brats' paws made contact too
rarely.
Today's trendies will approve the doctor's views on discipline. ''It
is beyond doubt that the teacher who punishes the least is the best
disciplinarian.'' Bunkum. Spare the rod and spoil the child and that's
that. The tawse ''should not be much needed in roomy, well-ventilated
schools where the pupils are physically comfortable''. Aye, comfortable
enough to get up to all manner of skulduggery. To be fair, the doc is
not for scrapping the tawse. ''That it can be entirely dispensed with
is, I think, impossible.'' Which just goes to show how wrong an
inspector can be.
Class sizes in 1860 were around 80 -- just right for the whole-class
teaching The Skallie has long advocated -- but Dr Kerr criticises the
''Englishing'' of Scottish education under which ''the clever child was
allowed to dawdle and mark time because he was sure to pass while the
less able was drilled beyond his power of reception and to his injury''.
Poor old English! If a brat's sure to pass, why waste good time on him?
And if a thickie doesn't have the powers of reception, he deserves to be
injured.
Dr Kerr was clearly not a linguist. ''Instruction in French and German
was entirely confined to translation and grammatical drill; attention to
pronunciation was in most of the colleges nil and in none sufficient . .
. The majority of students left the colleges nominally qualified to
teach a language, their pronunciation of which was absolutely
unrecognisable.'' Maybe so, but the same students would have been the
target of foreign ribaldry if they failed to master the subjunctive or
missed the agreement of the past participle with the preceding direct
object.
However, it is Dr Kerr's support for the female of the species which
takes him beyond credibility. ''The teaching of the elementary subjects
to a school of forty or fifty children is a task much more congenial to
a woman than to a brawny, able-bodied man . . . Young children are more
'in rapport' with a female than a male teacher, and the sympathy
necessary to success is either ready to hand or more easily created.''
You will have spotted the sexist assumptions, dear reader. Why is a man
brawny and a woman sympathetic? The Skallie has met no end of
sympathetic men and brawny women.
Yet the good doctor churns out a fair amount of amusing tittle-tattle.
There's the disintegrating school in Shetland with no pupils. ''The sole
occupant was a hen, perched comfortably on a joist, over which remained

PROFESSOR Robert Black has been most assiduous in looking under flat
stones and weaving his way through the thickest undergrowth in
Monklands. What he has found is not exactly pleasant, but it is
difficult to characterise it as a dreadful scandal in the same sense as
many of the concerns currently slithering their way through Westminster.
It is a tawdry, small-town affair, musty at the edges and malodorous in
other parts, but accentuated more by the fury of the participants than
by any deeply woven sins of commission and omission. Despite this, or
perhaps because of the intensity of its local framework, the affair has
dominated Labour politics in Lanarkshire for the past three years.
Because of the late John Smith's position as the local MP the row
acquired a wider currency, enticing the attention of Tory MPs from such
distant parts as Dover. It was, and may still be, a gift for those who
wish to attack the way in which Labour councils carry out their
business. It is equally clear that the Labour Party in Scotland failed
to deal with the issues involved in anything approaching a satisfactory
manner.
The perfect illustration of this is the ridiculous row which erupted
over the canny Mrs Liddell's recognition of an imbalance in the way
capital projects were funded and divided between Coatbridge and Airdrie.
In her election campaign Mrs Liddell began by insisting that allegations
against the council were trivial. A glance at the relevant details soon
convinced her that there was evidence of imbalance in spending, although
her conversion owed a good deal to doorstep reports of voter outrage.
This involved her in dispute with the neighbouring MP Tom Clarke and
with the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party leadership.
All of this was avoidable, as was Labour's constant whine that the
Scottish Secretary was allowing the affair to fester for political
reasons when he should have launched a Government inquiry. Mr Lang took
the position that his powers to hold an inquiry were not needed as there
was no evidence that Monklands council was in breach of its statutory
duties. The Accounts Commission took a similar stance. The Scottish
Secretary was correct. Professor Black has trawled through the documents
and has identified an imbalance in capital expenditure which appears to
favour Coatbridge. He stresses that the reasons are political and that
the relevant decisions were politically based, but that an audit report
had discovered nothing illegal or improper. The inference is that
Monklands council spent money where it thought it would gather support.
As a policy this may not smell of roses, but it is not illegal.
Far from rose-like, the rank weed of nepotism appears to have
flourished in Monklands. Professor Black's language at this point in his
report is almost comically obscure, but then he does not enjoy legal
privilege. It is abundantly clear that nepotism was present on a
significant scale and that despite professional advice the need for
manifest fairness in employment was absent. This is a more serious
charge than the imbalance in capital spending. The fact that 68
relatives of councillors were in council employment is a clear
indication that political cosiness had become downright incestuous.
Fortunately, it seems to follow from this that the charges of religious
bias in employment are unsustainable. If you are employing your
grannies, cousins, nephews, and brothers it is only too likely that they
will have the same nominal religious affiliation. In the light of all
this Labour would be ill-advised to counter by complaining of Government
inaction. As dignified a silence as possible will suffice, together with
heartfelt relief that Monklands Council, though not all who sailed in
her, will disappear forever next April.

A FIFE mother-of-two yesterday was crowned Scotland's first Marie
Curie Cancer Care Nurse of the Year.
Mrs Jane Thomson, 32, from Elie, will now be the ambassador for the
1243 specialist Marie Curie nurses who care for more than 2000 patients
around Scotland.
To mark the fourth anniversary of the Nurse of the Year initiative,
four Marie Curie nurses will be elected to carry the banner individually
in Scotland, England, Wales, and Ireland.
Mrs Christine McGilvray, Marie Curie's deputy director of nursing in
Scotland, said the charity was now one of the top 20 in Britain and
cares for nearly 40% of all cancer patients who die at home. Mrs Thomson
had been the unanimous choice for the award, she added.
Mrs Thomson, who is employed by Fife Health Board, also works at the
Randolph Wemyss Hospital in Buckhaven.
A Marie Curie nurse for the past four years, she said she was ''very
honoured'' to have been chosen.
She added: ''I get great satisfaction from helping the patient cope
with the final stages of their illness and supporting the family.''

THE logic of reality surely supports the views expressed by Andrew
Anderson and Stanley Workman. Money spent trying to prevent drugs
reaching the streets could be better spent helping to reclaim addicts.
Licensed outlets, as with wines and spirits, would eliminate the
criminal market and remove a cancer from modern activity.
But it is important that if drugs are to be sold legally those who buy
them must be made fully aware of their personal responsibility for how
drugs are used, even to the extent of registering purchasers and
limiting their rights to unemployability or social security benefits if
their subsequent incapacity should result from deliberate drug abuse.
There is nothing Britain needs more today than a firm re-establishment
of the link between freedom and responsibility.

RULES of happy holidays have changed. While to travel hopefully used
to be held a better thing than to arrive, it is not now the best thing.
Tops for hols is to get back with your bags filled with words.
Travel writing has come to receive the serious space once given to
religious tracts. There is a new rule of the road. If there is not an
improving book at the end of it, don't go. Holidays get the oceans of
worthy ink that used to go on holy pilgrimages.
How Scotland once nearly missed having such summer drenchings of
tourist prose is the subject of today's sermon. For, verily, there was a
book that might have ended all subsequent outpourings.
It was a long sad narrative about how everything that could go wrong
on a tartan holiday did so. Space was not stinted. More than a
quarter-million words went into the dark tale. No dire detail was
omitted. Efficiently handled, it could have killed the travel trade at
birth.
Author of this black opus was one James Plumptre, a strange-looking
name that appears to be missing a final letter. But when it came to
knocking Scotland this Plumptre did not miss a thing. He was the worst
tourist of all time.
If often he quite liked the scenery, little else pleased him. He found
the natives greedy, the hotels grotty, and the food gross. Whisky he
would not allow to pass his lips. Even sunshine, although occasional,
was upsetting. He complained that its reflection from the road
distressed his eyes.
Consider his diary entry for today's date when he found himself
unhappily at Blair Atholl.
June 20 -- I had another proof of Highland extortion before I left my
Inn. For tea and breakfast, with only oatcake to eat, salt butter and no
milk or cream I was charged a shillling each and a shilling for my bed,
for which, at the same style of house in England, I should not have been
charged at all, or a most but sixpence.
Plumptre had left Essex with the noble object of a five-month walking
tour to meet the poor people and share how they lived. But by today's
stage of his summer exploration his vocabulary for the natives had
changed to calling them peasants and sometimes seeing them as savages.
When he wrote scotch in his logbook he could not bring himself to give
it a capital letter.
It had been two days earlier that his holiday mood broke. When he
returned to his inn, he found his bedroom had been used for a party.
Tables and chairs were slopped with whisky. Worse, an intruder had used
his chamber pot and left it.
James Plumptre told his diary: ''It is a strong characteristic of
scotch manners, and was one of the circumstances which greatly tended to
give me a disgust in travelling in the country.'' He decided he just
wanted home.
Although his wasted holiday happened away back in l799, packaged tours
of the Highlands had begun. It was a testing time for them. Plumptre
could have given them the kind of start from which they might never have
recovered.
Yet he was not your average Essex man. He was a scholar and a
clergyman. He loved the theatre and wrote plays. He enjoyed meeting
strangers.
Perhaps, though, it is significant that he had failed to find a
companion to share his odyssey. Only a dog, called Rover, was prepared
to go with him. In his own book Plumptre appears a snobbish,
loud-voiced, humourless, long-nosed Sassenach twit.
Highland landladies may recognise the type. But some of them are also
only lightly disguised in the book.
At an inn in Glen Falloch Plumptre could not be sure whether the
receptionist was a man or a woman. Deciding she was female from the
quality of her beard, he asked for something to eat and was offered some
eggs.
''Then get me some eggs and ham &amp; mutton broth as soon as you can. And
shew me a room,'' the traveller demanded of the Hag, as he described her
in his diary.
Later, when he had squeezed a dish of tea from her, he felt refreshed
enough to make really serious demands. ''Mind that my sheets are well
aired,'' he bellowed.
''You'll have no sheets here tonight.''
''Why not?''
''They are all at the bleech: but I've got as good blankets as between
here and Glasgow,'' the Hag insisted.
When safely home, James Plumptre mused on what may be an enduring
truth that Scotch enthusiasm for visitors blows both hot and cold. How
he put it in his book was that a traveller is exposed to the alternate
and distressing extremes of generosity and extortion.
He wrote: ''When you are upon a Scotchman's hospitality, he thinks he
cannot do too much for you; but where it is his business to make money,
he thinks he can never have sufficient, however unreasonable his
charge.''
Fortunately (or perhaps not) his Journals of a Tourist blast of a book
failed to dam the flow of paying visitors. For publishers delayed
putting it out -- for nearly two centuries. By the time his harsh words
appeared only three years ago his abuse had mellowed. Time had given his
harsh enthusiasm a come-hither charm. Perhaps, a similar patient
quarantine might do most modern travel books no harm.

Use lottery cash in Paisley
STEPHEN McGINTY'S article on the sad plight of the victims of the
flooding which occurred in Paisley last December made disturbing reading
(June 14).
It almost beggars belief that after the passing of so many months
these poor souls are still in such dire financial straits that they have
to rely on a fund-raising celebrity concert for support, entirely
laudable though that initiative may be.
Surely a percentage of the income derived from the National Lottery
could be channelled into a special contingency fund, earmarked to deal
speedily with the effects of emergencies of this kind. This would go a
long way to alleviate some of the misery and hardship currently being
witnessed in Paisley.
Considering the enormous profits that the lottery has accrued for its
organisers, Camelot, in its first six months of operation, I would be
surprised if the public would quibble with the notion of directing some
of the monies to meet humanitarian needs when disaster strikes.

MY son has recently turned 16 and has an account with a High Street
bank. He told me that he now could get a chequebook and a free overdraft
of up to #500. I think I said he should get me one as well.
A little later he mentioned he had received leaflets from the bank
offering attractions and offers to take up these facilities.
Recently the telephone rang at about 8.30pm, and the caller, a young
woman, asked for my son. When I told her he was out she said she would
phone back later.
When pressed she identified herself as ''the bank'' but would not
discuss the purpose of the call.
When I spoke to my son I learned that some of his friends have been
contacted by the bank outwith their parents' knowledge to promote extra
banking facilities and the #500 overdraft. This was carried out by a new
phone-banking system.
I later contacted the bank about my concerns and was told that this
was indeed a new phone-banking system, but as my son was under 18 he
should not have been offered the free #500 overdraft.
I won't specifically name the bank but it seems they like to say
''Yes''.

A FRIEND of mine answered a ''lonely hearts'' advert from a woman who
turned out to be his ex-wife (June 19). No, they didn't get together
again.
I once wrote a brilliantly witty reply to an ad by a lonely widow who
phoned me to say that she found it hard to believe from my letter that I
was the fellow she had gone out with a couple of times.
Another time a lady phoned because she just wanted to know if I
sounded as good as I wrote. Her first question was, ''How old are you?''
and when I told her I was in my young 60s the phone went dead.
I wonder if it would do any good if I revealed I am a lottery winner.

PERMIT me to make a response, on behalf of Wigtown District Council,
to the article, Tenants' advisers criticise housing transfer.
The article was selective in quoting the tenants' advisers' report.
Underneath a heading titled Key Issues the advisers stated: ''The
majority of inquiries from tenants have concerned matters relating to
tenancy and personal rights. We can confirm that the information
provided, combined with the performance standards set down by Scottish
Homes, is sufficient to enable us to respond to inquiries and we have
generally been able to give positive reassurances to tenants.''
The independent advisers' criticism centres on financial information
which they had expected to receive. However, their expectation is based
on their experience of New Town and Scottish Homes transfers which, by
their very nature, are different from large-scale voluntary transfers.
With the New Town disposals, tenants have no choice but to transfer.
Their vote can only be used to decide which of the landlords they wish
to transfer to. This means that the transfer is a fait accompli and the
recipient landlords must therefore have the financial detail confirmed
prior to ballot.
Our ballot in Wigtown is to determine whether tenants wish to transfer
to Wigtown Housing Association or remain with the council. Only if there
is a positive ballot will the financial details be finalised since they
have no impact on the guarantees given to our tenants. Any impact will
be on the capital receipt received by the council.
All the advice we have sought confirms that this has been the route
followed by previous large-scale voluntary transfers in England and
Scotland. Our tenants would have justifiable cause for complaint if we
had spent money on finalising the financial details without knowing
whether or not the transfer was to proceed.
Finally, a financial check, which has demonstrated that the offer we
have made to our tenants is real and achievable has, of course, been
made. We are perfectly satisfied, as are our very experienced advisers,
that, should tenants vote in favour, Wigtown Housing Association will
deliver the promises made.
If we were not, we would have not made the offer.
Councillor W Service,
Chairman,
Wigtown District Council.

THREE separate alcohol issues have been reported recently in the
press.
First, a report by the Institute of Alcohol Studies is a timely
reminder that alcohol is a dangerous drug and causes massive personal
and social problems in our society.
Secondly, the announcement that Bass, the brewers, and Merrydown, the
cider makers, are to launch alcoholic lemonade illustrates that even
well-established alcohol producers will be seduced into highly
irresponsible targeting of young people if they see a profit to be made
and they can get away with it.
Thirdly, the complaint by the Scotch Whisky Association that tax
increases have led to a fall in sales demonstrates quite clearly that
government policies can have an effect in controlling consumption.
It is not a simple issue to find an appropriate balance between the
economic and social costs of alcohol consumption, on the one hand and
the benefits on the other. Indeed, probably this balance will be forever
changing.
Prohibition is certainly not a viable proposition, but nor is an
unfettered free market. Controls are needed in order to curb the
excesses of the alcohol producers and suppliers and to set the context
for responsible and careful use of the product.
A fourth report confirms that the balance is currently being shifted
in favour of the producers. The Government is to allow the advertising
of spirits on TV, a decision which will inevitably increase sales, and
eventually problems.
In the light of the Institute of Alcohol Studies' report and the
irresponsible behaviour of Bass and Merrydown now is the time for more,
not fewer controls.

THE article on drug prices came too late for my purchase of soluble
paracetamol for my teenage daughter.
I asked the assistant at a local chemist for the cheapest tablets and
was quoted #5.85 for 60 Solpadeine which works out at 9.75p each. I did
not want as many as this and asked for 12 tablets. I was astonished when
I was told the price was #2.07, ie 17.25p per tablet, not the #1.17 I
was expecting.
I was told this was the drug company's price which the chemist is
obliged to charge for that quantity.
After reading the article I did a bit more research and found that
another local chemist was selling own-brand soluble paracetamol at 24
for #1.59, ie 6.63p per tablet. These were presumably repackaged generic
tablets.
Why is it 77% more expensive to buy 12 Solpadeine instead of 60? It is
quite clear that it pays to shop around and to insist on generic
products by asking the chemist rather than an assistant.
Perhaps a large-scale campaign to use generic products could force
down drug company prices.

ABOUT Ann Shaw's article on generic v branded medicines (June 16), may
I point out that the current prescription charge is #5.25, not #5.45 as
stated, and that zyloric/allopurinol is not an anti-arthritic drug but
one used to treat gout?
Also in relation to what seems to be free advertising for Boots
products, considerably greater savings could be made for generic
paracetamol (99p v #1.35) and co-codamol (#2.05 v #3.25) if purchased
from independent pharmacies.

AS a resident and present chairman of Easdale Island Association I
feel that certain points should be put right with regard to your article
about the Easdale ferry (June 16).
A meeting was held on Easdale Island on April 23, 1994, concerning the
building of a low-water slipway proposed by Strathclyde Regional
Council.
This meeting was attended by their representative, Mr Tolmie, who gave
the undertaking, and has continued to do so up to the present day, that
the harbour channel would continue to be dredged after the building of
the slipway.
It was made very clear at the meeting that the ferry boat could not be
kept outside the harbour, hence the dredging having to be continued. The
latest dredging took place in April of this year.
Mr Feigenbaum had asked for a vote to be taken to ascertain the views
of the islanders on this matter. A ballot was taken at the meeting,
resulting in a 34-4 vote in favour of the said slipway.
Letters from the islanders to those in authority, including Mr Gordon,
were not cheeky but a genuine concern over the condition of the island's
present landing stage plus the time it was taking for negotiations on
the low-water slipway.
I feel your reporter should have obtained the overall view on this
matter from the islanders and of the negotiations which have gone on
over the last 18 months.
The report would have been more factual had Mr B Baker, chairman of
the Community Council been consulted as well as the Easdale Island
Association, both having correspondence on these matters.

MR McBain of Jordanbooks may find he is a little hasty in claiming his
company is the only independent publishing house in the West of Scotland
(June 3).
As another West of Scotland based independent publisher, my firm also
recognises the threats posed by the abolition of the Net Book Agreement
but we prefer to focus on the opportunities being created by this period
of radical change.
The NBA has in the past helped guarantee a wide choice but at what
cost? We believe a vast amount of published work today would be of

ARMED Forces Minister Nicholas Soames last night said the additional
papers on BMARC discovered by Ministry of Defence Police came to light
in a ''re-sorting of all the property stores'' at the force's
headquarters at Wethersfield, Essex.
He said in a Commons written reply that they had been obtained during
an investigation into corruption in MoD procurement contracts.
''Some of these items were documents which previously belonged to
Astra/BMARC. These were returned to the liquidators for Astra Holdings,
to whom they belong, on June 15.
''Additional documents belonging to the liquidators were discovered on
June 16 and will be sent to the liquidators .
''Other documents found, which were obtained during the original
investigation, belong to the MoD and to companies other than
Astra/BMARC.''
These were being examined to verify their rightful ownership.
Mr Soames said: ''This was an operational matter for the Ministry of
Defence Police.''
He told Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark the MDP inquiry would
ensure no further documents relating to the corruption investigation
remained in MDP hands and investigate how they came to be wrongly
located.
It would also establish what action was needed to ensure similar
''mistakes'' did not occur again.

Stephen McGinty examines the work of the criminal personality
profilers who search for clues in the psyche of killers.
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
. . . such men are dangerous.
IT WAS not the man who coined the term ''serial killer'', Robert K
Ressler, who first attempted criminal personality profiling. William
Shakespeare beat the former FBI agent into print when Julius Caesar
profiled his assassin. Yet despite the length of time man has been
tracking murderers, the art of finding clues in the psyche of the killer
has remained in its infancy.
However, the man who has pioneered the detective work of the future is
Ressler. For two decades at the Behavioural Science Unit at the FBI
Academy in Quantico, Virginia, he interviewed serial killers, inspected
crime scenes and began to find a bloody pattern to the most brutal of
murders, such as those perpetrated by Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy and
more recently, Jeffrey Dahmer.
Popular culture has mythologised the modern-day demons in novels such
as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, written by Thomas Harris, who
was tutored in the subject of serial slaughter by Robert Ressler. In
Britain over the past two years Cracker has gripped television audiences
and courted controversy as Robbie Coltrane's psychologist, Fitz, delves
into the criminal mind to find more than motive.
Yet only last year the entire art form of offender profiling was
blackened when Mr Justice Ognall branded a psychological profiler as a
''puppet-master'' when dismissing the case brought by the director of
public prosecutions against Colin Stagg. Stagg had been charged with the
murder of 22-year-old Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common in 1992.
Later this month Robert Ressler will conduct his annual lectures at
Dundee University on criminal personality profiling and crime-scene
assessment. The five-day seminar will be attended by police, prison
officers and psychiatrists from Japan, South Africa, Holland, Sweden and
Britain.
No police officer from Scotland will be attending in an official
capacity. Over the past four years almost every Scottish force has put
an officer through the course. Although our police have officers trained
in investigative psychology, they do not have any professional
profilers.
Scottish forces have in the past contacted profilers through the
Association of Chief Police Officers' committee on offender profiling.
Tayside Police are currently enlisting the services of a profiler in a
murder case.
However, across Britain the art of offender profiling has been under
scrutiny. In July reports will be announced by the committee on offender
profiling; the committee includes John Fleming, chief superintendent of
Strathclyde Police, a veteran of murder investigations such as the Bible
John killings.
The announcement will focus on the findings of a working group which
has examined the practicalities of training psychological profilers and
setting up a nationwide centre. The target is to achieve a system where
investigating officers faced with a murder or rape can contact a
profiler with the necessary experience.
The committee's secretary, Detective Superintendent Ian Lynch, of
Northumbria Police, said: ''Profiling and the work of a profiler is a
tool to aid the investigating officer in making decisions; it's not a
crystal ball and it's not Cracker.''
It is a sentiment repeated by Robert Ressler, speaking from Japan
where he has been working with Tokyo police into the psychology behind
the recent subway gas attack.
''Criminal profiling is different from detective work because instead
of just looking at the physical evidence at the scene it also looks at
the psychological evidence. You are piecing together information that
enables you to construct a behavioural composite of an unknown person.
''Usually there are enough behavioural characteristics present which
will give you some idea as to age, race, sex and also whether that
person was organised or disorganised.''
Evidence of an organised offender includes a hidden body, missing
murder weapon, rape kits which might include mask, rope and a knife.
Ressler said that about two-thirds of the crimes he has investigated
have fitted into this distinctive pattern.
Disorganised crimes are often characterised by violent mutilation. He
explained that the killer will often obliterate the victim's personality
by disfiguring the face.
''It's all mental disorders. What you do is look at the patterns of
the schizophrenic and what type of crimes he may commit. You look at the
person suffering from depression and a paranoid condition and that
produces another type. A host of crimes is committed by sexual
psychopaths. Really, you have to look at the disorders and how they
apply to different crimes.''
The Dundee seminar has been organised during the past five years by
Professor of Forensic Medicine Derrick Pounder. Pounder encountered the
work of Ressler while he was employed as a medical examiner in Edmonton,
Canada, and the pair became firm friends.
The conference was first held in 1990, after Ressler retired from the
FBI, and remains the only one of its type in the world. ''Profiling is
stepping into the mind of the killer in order to understand the crimes
from the killer's perspective,'' said Professor Pounder.
The programme will focus on serial, mass and spree homicides together
with an examination of other violent assaults including rape, child
offences, auto-erotic fatalities and sadistic crimes.
Case studies backed by the actual crime scenes on slide and video
formats will be accompanied by recorded interviews with incarcerated
serial killers, such as Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy, who together
murdered 50 young men.
Joining Ressler is Robert Hazelwood, who until 1993 was supervisory
special agent of the FBI Academy's Behavioural Science Unit. Also the
British forensic biologist Anne Davis will provide details on the Sexual
Assault Index she has organised since 1987. The index uses forensic
science and elements of the offenders' behaviour to reveal serial sexual
assaults.
Davis said: ''The main difference between profiling murder and rape is
that you have a live victim. Police at the moment are using cognitive
interview techniques to get as much information as possible from the
victim. It relaxes them so that we can go step-by-step back through the
assault.''
Required reading by the conference attendees, such as Sweden's
National Police Board and members of the psychology department at
Whitemore Prison, includes Ressler's co-authored Crime Classification
Manual and Hazelwood's Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation, for
which he conducted interviews with 41 men who raped a total of 837
victims.
As Robert Ressler and his British counterparts are at pains to
emphasise, profiling is not a science but an art. And profilers do not
catch the criminals; policemen do. This point did not seem to be
believed by a public addicted to Cracker but it had shocking
implications during the case of Rachel Nickell.
On July 15, 1992, Rachel Nickell was walking with her two-year-old son
across Wimbledon Common in broad daylight when she was stabbed 49 times
and sexually abused. More than a year later Colin Stagg was arrested
then charged. There were no witness statements or forensic evidence. He
was arrested because he allegedly matched a psychological profile drawn
up by Paul Britton.
Mr Justice Ognall threw the prosecution's case out of court. It had
been the first time that an inquiry had been controlled and interpreted
at each stage by a psychologist, not by the police. Paul Britton drew up
his specific profile before Stagg was interviewed.
The killer was a sadist, the use of the knife was for power, and this
would be reflected in his sexual fantasy. The long controversial
correspondence with the female undercover officer Lizzie James attempted
to place him in that profile with offers of sex.
Robert Ressler, who visited the murder scene and aided police shortly
after the attack, said the profile was not to blame. ''The public's
perception of that case is wrong. The perception was that the profile
was improper or that it caused the case to be thrown out. What was wrong
was that the court criticised the technique of entrapment.''
Britain's profiling pioneer Professor David Canter was so disturbed by
the line which Britton had taken that he became an expert witness for
the defence. The author of Criminal Shadows, about Britain's serial
murders, warned at the end of his book against profilers who do not
maintain a distance from the police; a warning which if ignored could
result in conviction of innocent people.
In the global arena where he works, Robert Ressler says murder rates
are rising. He believes the cause to be the disintegration of society
and pop culture's obsession with the obscene. ''Society is growing more
attuned to bizarre and repetitive homicides. What you are seeing is the
influence of the entertainment medium on violence.
''In Japan there are many comic books written with violent sexual and
rape themes. It seems like youth is susceptible to suggestion and
violence in the media is very, very profound.''
Curiously such an obsession has driven Ressler to the best-seller
charts. In Japan his autobiography, Whoever Fights Monsters sold just
over a million copies. His forensic text-book Sexual Homicides: Patterns
and Motives has sold 500,000 copies to an obsessed general public.
Ressler says he continues to sleep soundly. ''I have seen the worst .
. . In other words, man knows no limits to the violence and strange
things he can effect. It just becomes a matter of understanding that and
dealing with it.''
Profiling and the work of a profiler is a tool to aid the
investigating officer in making decisions; it's not a crystal ball and
it's not Cracker.

As Devonport struggles to meet its submarine refitting commitments
Rosyth is plugging the gap, as Alan Hunterreports.
EXACTLY two years ago, the man charged with running Rosyth Royal
Dockyard for the Ministry of Defence was an angry man. He never made his
thoughts known publicly, amid the political morass surrounding the
battle to refit nuclear submarines which would have safeguarded jobs in
Fife well into the next century.
Today, Allan Smith, the managing director of Babcock Rosyth Defence
Ltd, still guards his feelings on the decision to give Trident refitting
to Devonport at Plymouth instead of the Scottish yard, which is
Scotland's biggest single industrial site.
The man who, however, described the decision to grant the work to
Devonport as ''an upside-down solution'', and only when pressed admitted
that he thought it politically motivated, without going into detail,
emerges as the eternal optimist.
The former engineer who went to school at Mackie Academy in
Stonehaven, and honed his skills with the former Babcock and Wilcox
company in the West of Scotland, sees a future for Rosyth despite its
setbacks of the past two years.
Troubles facing Rosyth go back much longer, having been twice placed
on a care-and-maintenance basis between the wars, with huge lay-offs,
despite the fact that it was once described by Admiral Earl Beatty as
the most up-to-date and efficient yard of the time.
Rosyth sustained the Grand Fleet war effort, made a major input into
the Second World War victory, and in more recent years contributed to
the refitting of ships for the Falklands war, the Gulf war, and, between
times, the Icelandic fishing wars when the Royal Navy's thin-hulled
frigates were regularly rammed by the Icelanders' trawlers
Allan Smith says he is determined to see the yard, which now employs
3500, back on an even keel.
He declined to be drawn, but there seemed to be some satisfaction in
the fact that Devonport dockyard, is facing problems in keeping up with
its nuclear submarine refitting programme, and providing vessels on
time.
Work has been given to Rosyth because of timescale problems at
Plymouth, and he estimates that work will continue in Scotland beyond
the year 2000.
That is a bonus for the workforce, which, after the decision on
nuclear submarine work, was awarded surface ship refitting work by the
MoD.
This week bidding by Babcock International, the parent company, will
start in earnest, with the possibility of an important industrial
development on the horizon.
It could see the consortium Rosyth 2000, in which Babcock, the Bank of
Scotland, and Forth Ports Authority are involved, setting up new
industries within the yard, in the aftermath of reduced defence
contracts as a result of the ending of the Cold War.
Allan Smith's senior colleagues have been well used to his hastily
called management meetings over the past few years.He simply telephones
his department heads to advise them: ''Be here. We have a council of
war.''
Yesterday, he admitted that busy times are once more looming.
Recalling that two years ago he was despondent over the submarine
refitting decision, Mr Smith said it was clearly laid down that the
future for Rosyth was in surface ships.
By 1997 nuclear submarine refitting was to end, and the yard had to
re-set its stall. Significant changes in personnel had inevitably
resulted, he said, with work continuing on the Navy's small ships, like
minehunters and sweepers.
The yard had also to accept the fact that there would be competition
in the refitting of the Navy's larger ships.
The managing director said he was proud that Rosyth had recently
smartened up its act, and improved performance on small ship refitting
had been noted by the MoD.
''I am very happy that this has been noted at the highest level within
the ministry,'' he said.
Double-stream refitting has now been introduced at Rosyth on larger
ships, handling two type 42 ships at the same time.
Mr Smith said a major disruption loomed in the industry because of the
difficulties in submarine refitting, due to the imposition of stringent
new nuclear safety requirements. He said Rosyth could meet such
requirements, hence the awarding of the additional submarine work.
Currently berthed at Rosyth is HMS Edinburgh, and the nuclear
submarines HMS Sovereign and Superb. Along with small ships, the yard
hopes to take HMS Newcastle in the near future, another destroyer.
It is also working on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Sir Bedivere,
which has been basically cut in half and extended.
Other diversification work has included rail carriage refitting, and
Babcock has taken over two rail workshops at Springburn, with the
setting up of a new company, RailCare Ltd.
Is there a future for Rosyth?
Mr Smith said: ''I think there is a big future here. As far as the
dockyard is concerned, this extension of life in nuclear submarine
refitting is interesting. How long it will last I am not certain, but we
could be refitting nuclear submarines beyond the year 2000.''
Referring to industrial relations at Rosyth, Mr Smith admitted that
the implications of privatisation had put a degree of strain on
relations between unions and management.
''That is something we will work at, and I have no reason to believe
we cannot overcome that,'' he said.
Away from the machinations of politics and high finance, the managing
director, who lives only a few miles from the dockyard, is never far
from engineering, even when relaxing. His hobby is repairing farm carts.

other countries, the UN and Red Cross warned. They launched an appeal
for #22m to help check the disease, which was believed to have been
almost eliminated in Europe. They said the outbreak could bring 150,000

yesterday from Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to
Mr Gordon McMaster, Labour MP for Paisley South.
The figures show that of all 4233 JPs, 1219 are Conservative
supporters according to voluntary declarations made at the time of their
appointment; 1074 are Labour, 604 Independent, 380 Liberal Democrat, 163
SNP, two (in Dunfermline) Communist, and the affiliation of 791 is not

MADRID: A policeman was killed and five other people, two of them
police officers, were injured yesterday when a terrorist car bomb
exploded in the centre of Madrid.
Police had sealed off the area after a telephoned warning by the
Basque separatist organisation Eta, but the officer killed was hit by
shrapnel from a metal bin placed against the car. The blast seriously
damaged one of Madrid's biggest department stores which was about to
open its doors for sales. If the blast had occurred a short time later,
it could have caused a massacre.

''THIS matter is not going to be solved on the battlefield in any
remotely satisfactory way,'' Mr Major said yesterday, not setting out
his position on a Conservative leadership challenge but on the prospects
of a negotiated peace in Bosnia. This looks less likely to be settled
than the Tory leadership which, one way or the other, should be resolved
in November.
The Major words were pretty well what the Chancellor of the Exchequer
had been telling party rebels earlier in the day. It is hard to believe
that the Clarke currency impresses the Euro-sceptic market forces much
but, for whatever reason , several of the men thought most likely to
plunge a dagger into the Prime Ministerial back were all politeness when
Mr Major reported back on the G7 summit.
Mr Roger Knapman (Stroud) contrasted our interest rates and
unemployment with those of ''socialist Spain''. Mr Bernard Jenkin
(Colchester North) said he assumed the summit had shown absolutely no
interest in Labour's idea of a national minimum wage -- it hadn't -- and
Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (Chingford) praised Britain's three lows --
unemployment, interest rates and inflation.
Mr Major had gone out of his way to commend the warm and friendly
welcome of the people of Nova Scotia, which must have been nice after
his get-together with 50 Euro-sceptics just before he left.
The summit communique sounded something like the last one or even the
ones before that -- a bit grey in fact which, rather unfortunately in
the light of current obsessions, blended nicely with the Prime
Minister's style.
One reflected that Margaret Thatcher, whether she actually did any
more good or not, had more exciting summits as usually everybody else
there was disagreeing with her and her reports were more exciting, too,
as she described to whom she had taken her handbag and why.
Mr Blair, the Sketch was glad to note, was not quite perfect enough to
restrict himself to sensible questions about the summit, though he did
those.
He slipped in a line about the ''ill-disciplined shennanigans'' on the
Conservative benches overshadowing Mr Major's efforts at Halifax. They
were bad not just for the Conservative Party but for Britain, he said,
piously omitting the thought that they were rather good for the Labour
Party.
Mr Major refused to bite. While Mr Blair was baiting his trap, the
Sketch tried to think of what Mr Major could usefully say and could
think of nothing. That appeared to Mr Major's conclusion as well.
Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover -- Lab.), a man who regularly tries to
crack nuts with a sledgehammer, said it was incredible to him to believe
that Mr Major could contribute to the solution of world problems when he
couldn't control the conflicting groups within his own party.
Conflicting groups getting up to shennanigans in their party has often
driven Prime Ministers to a close study of world problems as a welcome
respite from those curdling at Westminster.
Mr Major, smiling -- and he rates some kind of award for being able to
produce genuine-looking smiles at times when he should by rights be
feeling extremely depressed -- replied that Mr Skinner's incredulity,
like his relevancy, knew no bounds.
He was able to relieve his feelings by getting shirty with a couple of
Scots who ticked him off for supporting Shell UK's deep-water disposal
plan for the Brent Spar platform. The right way, he insisted, was to
drop it into 6000ft of water in the Atlantic. ''That's what they're
going to do to you,'' shouted the inimitable Mr Tony Banks (Newham
North- West -- Lab). Mr Major ignored that one, too.

The company anticipates a court hearing to be held within the next
eight weeks.
Mr Mercer's company and Mr Robinson and Mr Deans have clashed over
cash put into the club. Mr Robinson and Mr Deans have already announced
their intention to sue Mr Mercer, the former chairman of Hearts, for

FAMILY doctors moved closer towards a ballot on sanctions after talks
aimed at settling a dispute on out-of-hours pay broke down last night.
There is said to be ''bitter disappointment'' among GP leaders over
the meeting with Health Minister Gerald Malone at the Department of
Health in London.
There had been hopes of a breakthrough in the deadlock over the GPs'
rejection of a Government package of an extra #45m this year to help pay
for round-the-clock patient care.
Mr Malone told chairman of the General Medical Services Committee Dr
Ian Bogle that there was no possibility of more cash and that the
demands made by doctors raised real difficulties for the Government.
GPs overwhelmingly rejected the offer by 83% earlier this month and
warned of a long-awaited ballot on industrial action if no progress was
made.
Doctors nationwide will debate the issue at a meeting of the Local
Medical Committees in London tomorrow. However, doctors leaders fear the
stalemate and the Minister's intransigence have pushed GPs closer to
agreeing to sanctions.
SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley yesterday in the Commons
defended moves to limit income support help for mortgage payments by the
unemployed.He denied it would lead to more people losing homes and said
owners should be encouraged to take out private insurance against job
loss. ''It is right we should try to move from a system which at present
leaves 70% of people with mortgages, who may find themselves unemployed
or without an income, uncovered by the existing state system.''
THE Government yesterday outlined plans for events to commemorate the
50th anniversary of VJ day -- the end of the war against Japan. There
were also impassioned clashes by war veterans in the Lords over the
dropping of atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Lords Leader Viscount
Cranborne, who heads the parliamentary committee organising VJ
celebrations, said that on Saturday August 19 there would be an open air
service outside Buckingham Palace, a parade of veterans and servicemen
and an evening entertainment on the Thames. Events would involve the UK
and Commonwealth countries, including representatives of the Far East
fleets of the Royal Navy and the Merchant Marine.  ''On the Sunday, we
hope that there will be events throughout the nation, with church
services and Beating Retreats in the four capital cities -- London,
Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.''

Los Angeles, Monday
FILM star Elizabeth Taylor has been admitted to hospital to undergo
right hip replacement surgery, only 15 months after having a similar
operation to replace her left hip.
Miss Taylor, 63, was expected to have surgery today at an undisclosed
hospital in Los Angeles.
She injured her right hip while doing aerobics in the pool of her
Bel-Air home, according to her publicist, Chen Sam.
Miss Taylor was unhappy about being in hospital again, but doctors
said the hip had to be replaced, Sam said.
The Oscar-winning actress is expected to remain in hospital for five
to seven days. She has suffered a series of health setbacks in recent
years, including three months in hospital in 1990 with respiratory
problems that nearly took her life.--AP.

A PILOT and engineer working for Greenpeace were arrested yesterday at
Prestwick Airport in connection with a helicopter raid last Friday to
drop two activists on board the Brent Spar oil installation.
It is understood the men, both German, had been flying the helicopter
from Stornoway and were detained when they landed to refuel at
Prestwick.
Meanwhile, the two activists, who have been aboard the Spar since
Friday, were preparing to chain themselves to the defunct oil
installation last night in a desperate attempt to stop it being dumped
at sea, the environmental group claimed last night. The pair were still
being hosed by high-pressure jets from Shell's supply boats.
The unnamed pilot and engineer were arrested at Prestwick by Grampian
Police in their capacity as the police force with jurisdiction for the
North Sea oil industry.
Chief Superintendent Ron Coutts of Grampian Police said: ''We can
confirm that in connection with an incident last week on the Brent Spar
installation, two men have been arrested. Inquiries about the matter are
continuing.''
It is understood the men were being taken to Aberdeen for questioning.
Last Friday, a helicopter dropped two men on board the Brent Spar,
which is due to be sunk in the North Atlantic today. The helicopter was
seen skimming the surface of the sea to dodge a 100ft curtain of water
from water cannons on standby vessels surrounding the Spar.
On Sunday, the Civil Aviation Authority launched an inquiry into
allegations that the helicopter had breached the Air Navigation Order by
failing to display registration markings.
Last night, a CAA spokesman refused to comment on the two arrests,
other than to say: ''We cannot comment other than to say that flying
without showing the aircraft's proper markings is a serious offence.''
A spokeswoman for Greenpeace said she understood the pilots were on
their way back to Germany at the time of the arrest.
Meanwhile, in the Commons, the Prime Minister clashed angrily with
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald over Mr Major's defence of Shell UK's
decision to dispose of the Spar in deep water.
Mr Macdonald said the Government's position confirmed the reputation
of the UK as ''the dirty man of Europe''.
''It is technically possible to recycle the Brent Spar on land and
that would actually create more jobs, and the only obstacle is that it
would be more expensive for Shell,'' he said.
However, Mr Major, clearly annoyed, told Mr Macdonald he ''should be
ashamed of himself'' for calling Britain the ''dirty man of Europe''.
He said: ''It is another illustration of the way in which Opposition
Members will always speak as ill as they can of this country and as well
as they can of other countries.''
The Prime Minister, who was reporting back to the Commons on the G7
Summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said the deep-sea disposal was
consistent with Britain's international commitments, had been endorsed
by the overwhelming majority of expert opinion consulted by the
Government, had received all the necessary approvals of consent, and was
''the best practicable environmental option that is available to us''.
He also responded sharply to SNP Parliamentary leader Mrs Margaret
Ewing, who asked if there was not a financial interest for the
Government as the cost of disposal at sea could be offset against
petroleum revenue tax.
Mr Major admitted that Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl had taken a
different view to his about the disposal but he said to Mrs Ewing: ''I
think if you thought it should be taken ashore in Scotland you would
think differently.''
Mrs Ewing said later: ''How can anyone trust the Prime Minister's
environmental assessment when it is obvious that both the Government and
Shell have a vested financial interest in sea water dumping? The SNP is
demanding that the Brent Spar be towed to shore and anchored pending a
proper independent environmental assessment.''
Last night, Mr Simon Reddy, on board the Greenpeace vessel Altair
which is shadowing the Brent Spar, said: ''At lunchtime today, the two
people on board the Spar went on to the helideck to put out a banner and
were hosed down again by two Shell supply boats.
''The high-pressure jets have smashed windows in the accommodation
deck and demolished partitions inside. They are behaving with no regard
to the people on board.''
A Shell spokesman said its supply boats had been sending a fine spray
of water over the Spar to make it as uncomfortable as possible for the
protesters on board.
However, he pointed out that Greenpeace was illegally occupying
Shell's installation.
Greenpeace is expected to mount a last-ditch attempt today to thwart
the dumping of the Brent Spar in the North Atlantic by calling up the
largest vessel of its fleet, the Solo, which has another helicopter on
board. The Spar is expected to reach its proposed sinking site either
tonight or early tomorrow.
The vessel, a converted North Sea tug and ironically the former sister
ship of the Smit Singapore, one of the tugs towing the Spar, left
Stornoway yesterday with a crew of 17, a party of journalists, and
Councillor Iain MacSween from the Western Isles Islands Council, acting
as an observer, aboard.
Greenpeace spokeswoman Rose Young said the Solo would support the
Altair which has shadowed the disused floating oil storage buoy on its
journey to the dump site, 150 miles northwest of the Butt of Lewis.
The two activists who re-occupied the installation last week would be
difficult to move, she said.
''It is one thing landing them. It's another thing getting them off,''
she said.
Ms Young also claimed that the two men managed to stay on board the
Spar only by grabbing hold of a wire surrounding the deck when Shell
employees on a support ship aimed water-cannon at them.

TRADE President Michael Heseltine yesterday rejected Labour demands
for an independent judicial inquiry into the BMARC arms-to-Iran affair.
He said such an investigation would inevitably have to cover ground
already exhaustively examined by Sir Richard Scott's arms-to-Iraq
inquiry.
Last night, Labour's call to force an independent judicial inquiry
into the affair was defeated in the Commons by 291 votes to 267, a
Government majority of 24.
Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham had argued that Mr
Jonathan Aitken, a former non-executive director of the firm, should
have known naval guns it was exporting to Singapore were really destined
for Iran.
The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who did not vote after the
debate, sat impassively as Dr Cunningham accused him along with other
Ministers -- including John Major, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley -- of giving untrue answers to
MPs about the affair.
He said the disclosure that the firm had been granted export licences,
despite intelligence reports suggesting the guns were being illegally
shipped to the Tehran regime, indicated ''incompetent negligence and
perhaps worse'' on the part of the Government.
Mr Heseltine, in his response, made no reference to his beleaguered
Cabinet colleague and it was left to backbench Tory Edward Leigh to
insist Mr Aitken could not have known the guns' true destination.
The Trade President said that as a result of the fresh information --
he announced details to the House last week -- some ministerial
statements would have to be ''revisited''.
He also appeared to suggest he had initiated inquiries into BMARC's
activities before receiving the questions tabled by Labour Trade and
Industry spokesman Brian Wilson which prompted his statement last week.
''The precise question that was put by Mr Wilson happened to focus
upon the particular inquiry that I had made within a matter of weeks or
days probably of the question he put down,'' he said.
''He asked for information which I myself had just commissioned.''
Mr Heseltine, while dismissing Labour's demand for a judicial inquiry,
said he believed the best way forward would be an inquiry by the Trade
and Industry select committee.
Mr Leigh, whose Gainsborough and Horncastle constituency included the
BMARC factory, told the House he had documentary proof that Mr Aitken
could not have known that the weapons were going to Iran.
He said he had obtained a licensing agreement showing that it was only
entitled to sell the weapons to its former parent company, the Swiss
firm Oerlikon, which then sold them on.''As far as anyone in the company
(BMARC) was concerned, Singapore was the end user for these goods,'' he
said.
The Commons debate came after the weekend disclosure that lost BMARC
papers had been rediscovered by the MoD.
Defence Select Committee chairman Sir Nicholas Bonsor (Upminster --
Con.) said: ''Quite clearly we do not wish to have another long inquiry.
We need to dispose of this matter briskly.''
He agreed it would be best dealt with by the Trade and Industry Select
Committee.
Winding up for Labour, Mr an Wilson said he was astonished how limited
Tory MPs thought the role of non-executive directors was.
He said: ''This debate is not about Mr Aitken, it is about the firm
BMARC and the inquiry into it.
''If, as a by-product of that, any information emerges which either
worsens or secures the position of Mr Aitken, then that is a side-effect
of it.''
He said Mr Aitken was a Minister whose Cabinet colleague, Mr
Heseltine, had ordered two inquiries into the company of which he was a
director.
''Is there no level of conflicting interest at which he will step
aside, at least until the inquiry is completed, or will he continue to
brass-neck it out for as long as he can get away with it?''
Junior Trade and Industry minister Ian Taylor said Labour did not want
an inquiry.
''They want to prejudge everything and have used the debate entirely
to make accusations based on flimsy evidence, make allegations against
ministers past and present.''
Insisting that the Trade and Industry Select Committee could carry out
an inquiry into the issue, Mr Taylor declared: ''There should be no
automatic assumption that, simply because things had been found to have
happened in a way that people had thought they had not happened, that
you reach for the nearest judge.''

Eynatten, Monday
TWO British lorry drivers today received the personal thanks of King
Albert of Belgium for rescuing victims of a gas blast which wrecked a
motorway restaurant and petrol station complex.
Former Para Alan Sharpe, 47, from Nottingham, snatched three seriously
injured people to safety in the disaster in Belgium which claimed 16
lives -- including an unnamed British lorry driver.
There was also royal congratulations from the king -- who visited the
tragedy scene -- for John Piff, 52, of Swindon, Wiltshire.
Mr Piff helped Mr Sharpe with one of the rescues before they were
beaten back by a wall of flames.
The two men, due to continue their journeys overnight, instead stayed
at a local hotel at the insistence of King Albert, who said the Belgian
people would pay.
Mr Sharpe was reading in the cab of his truck last night when the
explosion ripped through the Wally-Stop Cafeteria and petrol station in
Eynatten, a mile from the Belgian-German border.
Witnesses said the restaurant collapsed like a pack of cards after the
blast, which was followed by a fierce fire.
Mr Sharpe was the first person to reach the wrecked building, where he
knew many fellow lorry drivers and other customers had been eating and
drinking.
''I could see a young girl lying in the wreckage,'' he said.
''She seemed to be terribly injured but she was screaming and I told
her 'keep screaming that way and you'll stay alive'.
''I pulled her out and called for help and my mate came and we both
went in to lift out a really big German truck driver who'd gone in to
help but the roof collapsed in on him.
''We pulled the rubble off him and got him clear and then went back
for the other woman.''
Mr Piff, 52, said he had helped Mr Sharpe to rescue the German, but
''after he got the third person out I noticed a wall of flame and the
whole place went up like a tent''.
Weeping, he said they could hear people screaming but could not reach
them through the flames.One was a fellow lorry driver he had known for
years, who minutes before had asked him to join him in the restaurant.
''I can't believe how lucky I am,'' Mr Piff said. ''If I'd stayed to
have a drink with my mate I wouldn't be here now.''
The dead included the unnamed British lorry driver, 10 Belgians, a
family of four Germans, and a Croatian, police said.
The cause of the blast was still being investigated today. A gas leak
below the restaurant kitchen was at first thought to be a likely cause,
but later reports suggested petrol vapour may have leaked from forecourt
tanks.

Sydney, Monday
THE trial of an Australian roadworker charged with killing seven
backpackers, including two young British women, was postponed after he
said he could not afford his legal fees.
Ivan Milat, 49, was to stand trial on June 26, but the Supreme Court
of New South Wales postponed the trial pending an appeal by Milat to
delay proceedings.
Supreme Court Judge David Hunt said that if Milat showed he could not
afford to contribute to his legal fees, he would be entitled to have his
trial delayed until he received adequate legal representation.
Milat is charged with murdering the backpackers between 1989 and 1992
in a remote forest south-west of Sydney.
Milat is accused of killing Australians James Gibson and Deborah
Everist, both 19; Germans Simone Schmidl, 20, Garbor Neugebauer, 21, and
Anja Habschied, 20, and Britons Caroline Clarke, 22, and Joanne Walters,
22.--Reuter.

Bucharest, Monday
ROMANIAN police said two Chinese businessmen had been killed, boiled,
and flushed down the toilet in the most ''horrible, bloodiest, and
unthinkable'' crime ever committed in Bucharest.
''We have some experience of crime but never have we been confronted
with such bestial treatment,'' said police spokesman Dan Secrieru of the
gruesome find in a rented flat.
A 31-year-old Chinese student had been arrested over the killings and
two other men were being sought, he said. Police had
yet to establish a motive.
Secrieru said Xu Ifei and Yin Zong Bo were killed in an as yet
undetermined way, cut into small pieces, and boiled. Body parts were
flushed away -- police found only 24lb of flesh and bone in the toilet
bowl.
The killings, some time last week, came to light over the weekend when
the toilet overflowed into neighbouring flats.
Eight other Chinese people have been killed in Romania since 1992,
most by what police called ''oriental'' techniques -- all strangled,
some cut into pieces, and some left in suitcases or bags in a river.
* Five years after the end of communism, most Romanians earn barely
enough to live and do not believe life will improve soon, according to a
survey conducted for financier George Soros's charity foundation. It
found only 41% of Romanians earned enough to cover basic
necessities.--Reuter.

GREENPEACE activists and members of the public took part in protests
outside Shell petrol stations throughout the country yesterday.
The Liberal Democrat MP for Ross and Cromarty, Mr Charles Kennedy,
joined demonstrators who tried to block off the entrance to the Shell
filling station at The Inshes retail estate in Inverness with a car and
trailer.
Mr Kennedy called upon Shell to take notice of the growing wave of
public disgust at its decision to sink the Brent Spar at sea.
Highland postmistress, Mrs Mandy MacLeman, 39, who organised the
demonstration, said: ''I have never done anything like this before and I
am not a member of any environmental group. I just wanted to show the
Government and Shell that ordinary people on the street like me care
just as much about vandalism to the environment.''
Aberdeen District Council yesterday passed an emergency motion
deploring the decision to allow Shell to sink the Spar.

Baroness Thatcher yesterday became only the second woman outside the
Royal Family to be made a member of the Order of the Garter.
The eighth and longest-serving Prime Minister of the Queen's reign was
installed amid pomp and ceremony at Windsor along with New Zealander Sir
Edmund Hillary, who in 1953 was the first person to conquer Mount
Everest.
The Queen Mother, who was due to attend the Garter Service in St
George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, was not present.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ''The Queen Mother is well and
earlier attended the Garter lunch and investiture.
''But she decided to pace herself and not to go to the service.''
Lady Thatcher and Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk, who was installed in
1990, are the only non-Royal women to be made members of an order which
is the highest decoration in the Queen's gift.
The announcement of Lady Thatcher's elevation to the Garter caused
some surprise in the light of reportedly frosty relations between her
and the Queen during the Thatcher years in office from 1979 to 1990.
To attend yesterday's ceremonies, the former Prime Minister had to
take time off from promoting her latest book of memoirs, which has
sparked new political controversy.
Lady Thatcher, wearing the blue velvet mantle of the order, with a
badge on the left shoulder and red velvet hood over the right shoulder
together with a black velvet hat flourishing white feathers, smiled to a
large crowd in the precincts of Windsor Castle as she walked alongside
Sir Edmund, 73, in procession to St George's Chapel.
Other members of the order in the procession, headed by Lady Thatcher
and Sir Edmund, included former Prime Ministers Sir Edward Heath and
Lord Callaghan, who walked with the Duke of Kent, Princess Royal, Prince
of Wales, Duke of Edinburgh, and the Queen.
Before the procession and service, Lady Thatcher and Sir Edmund were
invested in the Queen's Ballroom at Windsor Castle. Lunch followed in
the Waterloo Chamber.
Lady Thatcher's banner and coat of arms will now be placed in St
George's Chapel, although this is unlikely to happen until next year.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
BOSNIAN Serb troops today regained control of a key supply route which
was believed cut by Bosnian government forces in heavy fighting.
''The road between Sarajevo and Pale is under Serb control,'' a UN
official said. ''There are no craters and there's no damage to the
road.''
Meanwhile Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin had a surprise meeting with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade before leaving for
Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale and a bid to restart the peace
process.
At the same time UN officials in Sarajevo said they would try to begin
a new relationship with the Bosnian Serbs now that the last of the
hostages seized in retaliation for Nato air strikes had been freed.
France said the end of the hostage crisis paved the way for fresh
peace talks.
In Canada, President Boris Yeltsin said Russia, a traditional ally of
the Bosnian Serbs, would not allow any more Nato air strikes against
them.
He said before leaving the G7 summit: ''Russia has a common stand with
France and other members of the UN Security Council on this issue, and
we intend not to allow further air strikes.''
The Bosnian government army launched an offensive around Sarajevo last
week in a desperate bid to break relentless Serb pressure on the city,
which has been under siege for 38 months.
Today they fought a fierce uphill battle against Serbs and were at one
point thought to have won control of the road linking Pale to a major
barracks south of Sarajevo. Government sources said on Saturday that
their men had blown it up and pulled back to secure positions from where
they could fire on Serb traffic attempting to pass.
However the Bosnian Serbs denied having lost the road and today a UN
vehicle passed Serb soldiers walking along stretches of the mountain
route.
A UN official said: ''It seems Serbs control the road but the Bosnian
army can still shoot down on it.''
The apparent setback suggests the Bosnian army offensive has stalled,
although Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said his men would halt
their operation only if Serbs relaxed their stranglehold on his capital.
Sarajevo has been largely quiet since Friday with UN officials
surprised there have been no further attacks.
However obituary notices for 19 Muslim soldiers in Sarajevo's main
paper are a sign of the high price the Bosnian army is paying for its
offensive. Casualty figures are not released by either side.
The government has tried to put pressure on Bosnian Serb leaders by
shelling Pale for three days running. Serb sources said there were no
casualties in the sporadic attacks, the first to strike their mountain
village ''capital'' since 1992.
As the last 26 UN hostages freed by the Bosnian Serbs arrived at UN
headquarters in Zagreb, officials said their release could mark the
start of the UN mission's recovery from paralysis.
Spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward admitted: ''I'm not sure
whether we've been at a lower ebb than we are now.''
He added however: ''There's an opportunity now where we can take some
profit from the situation.''
The return of the hostages and the withdrawal of UN guards from
weapons depots on Serb-held land meant there were fewer potential
hostages to prevent future vigorous action to open routes for supply
convoys.
In Belgrade, Russian envoy Churkin said: ''The situation in Bosnia
indicates an obvious slide towards military methods of resolving
conflicts.
''Moscow is extremely concerned about such a development of events and
is taking steps to return the crisis to a course of political
resolution.''
The diplomatic effort collapsed last year when the Bosnian Serbs
rejected a peace plan drawn up the Contact Group of major powers --
Britain, the United States, Russia, France and Germany.
Churkin was Moscow's special envoy to former Yugoslavia until he
became ambassador to Belgium last year. He described Bosnian Serb
leaders as being ''sick with the madness of war''.--Reuter/AP.

Stepnoye, Monday
HEAVILY-ARMED Chechen gunmen, who had been holding hundreds of
hostages in a hospital for five days, took a column of buses with
civilian ''human shields'' on a wild journey across southern Russia
today.
Russian military helicopters following the convoy wheeled high
overhead. Flares dropped by Russian aircraft occasionally illuminated
the area around the convoy, which was near the Russian town of Stepnoye
by 11.30pm.
Earlier, hundreds of hostages were released after the convoy of six
buses, with a refrigerated van containing the bodies of Chechen fighters
killed in fighting, left the town of Budennovsk.
Tonight, however, it was not clear where the convoy was heading. After
moving 50 miles south to Russia's North Ossetia region, it stopped and
turned back.
Tass news agency said Russia's military commander in Chechnya,
Lieutenant-General Anatoly Kulikov, had ordered his forces to block the
road to North Ossetia with armoured cars.
The motive behind the order was not clear. The original route would
have taken the convoy through Mozdok, the Russian military headquarters
for the Chechnya campaign.
Tass quoted Chechen law enforcement officials as saying that in the
convoy were at least 73 gunmen and about 130 volunteers, including MPs
and journalists.The agency said the column appeared to be heading for
Chechnya via the town of Neftekumsk and the Dagestan border town of
Kizlyar -- a much longer journey of some 125 miles.
In Budennovsk, hostages and their relatives wept as they were
re-united after a five-day ordeal.
''It was five days of horror,'' one man said as he staggered out into
the sunshine, supporting another man on his shoulder.
The deal to end the drama was hammered out in a weekend of tortuous
telephone negotiations in which Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin bowed
to most demands of Chechen guerrilla commander Shamil Basayev.
As the crisis reached its climax, Russian and Chechen officials held a
new round of talks in the Chechen capital Grozny in an effort to bring
peace to the North Caucasus region.
Russian authorities hastily arranged the Grozny talks -- the first
since May 25 -- in line with Chechen demands.
However Chernomyrdin told reporters in Moscow there would be no
concessions to Chechen demands for independence. ''We will not do
anything that contradicts the constitution,'' he said.
Basayev and his small guerrilla army had been holding more than 1000
hostages since storming Budennovsk last Wednesday. More than 50 people
were killed in the immediate aftermath of the raid and the death toll
has since risen to at least 100.--Reuter.

A NEW analysis of drug deaths figures dispels the myth that Glasgow's
record drug-user mortality last year was the tip of a larger iceberg,
according to Scottish Office sources.
The figures, which encompass all of Scotland, also illustrate
dramatically just how widespread the phenomenon of drug abuse has
become, with no area of the country left untouched.
The same Scottish Office sources also emphasised that considerable
faith was now being invested in the programmes of methadone
substitution, started in Edinburgh and adopted last year in Glasgow, to
reduce injecting of heroin and Temazepam and, consequently, to bring
down the mortality rate among abusers.
The total number who died from all drug causes, excluding known
suicides, was 247. Of these 139 -- all under 45 -- were known or
suspected to be drug-dependent. Greater Glasgow had by far the highest
toll, 97 deaths, of which 88 were known or suspected poly-drug users.
Announcing the enhanced data in Parliament yesterday, Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang said it would help inform development of policy and
services. A Scottish Office source told The Herald that, contrary to the
widely held belief among those who work in drug-related services as well
as the abusing community itself, the 1994 figure for Greater Glasgow, of
97 deaths, was most probably accurate.
The idea that many deaths were recorded as something else because
parents wished to avoid the stigma of having a drugs-related death in
the family held no water.
After the Scottish Affairs Select Committee expressed concern in 1993
about the unavailability of reliable figures for drug deaths, forensic
pathologists were asked to follow up cases of deaths of young people
where the death certificate was vague or there were suggestions that the
death might be drug related.
The new arrangements, last year, gave confidence that most deaths
involving drugs had been included in the statistics.
Although there was doubt over comparisons with previous years because
of the improved collection of statistics, the 1994 figure of 274
compared with 153 and 209 in 1992 and 1993 respectively. The increase
between 1992 and 1993 was assumed to be a real one, and it would appear
there had been a real increase in 1994.
The huge increase in deaths known or suspected to be drug dependent --
a rise from 14% in 1992/93, to 56% last year -- was due to the improved
collection methods. The Scottish Office believes that the 1994 figure of
139 drug-dependent deaths should be taken as a base for the future.
The majority of the deaths occur in the Greater Glasgow Health Board
area and in Lothian, the rate for Greater Glasgow being between two and
three times as high as that in Lothian and Tayside.
Meanwhile, a community programme to tackle drug abuse in one of
Strathclyde's most infamous problem areas has been refused funding
because of a series of Scottish Office ''blunders'', a Labour MP claimed
yesterday.
Mrs Maria Fyfe, MP for Glasgow Maryhill, said a communications
breakdown between two departments had denied the Maryhill Drugs
Initiative #300,000 in Urban Aid, after project leaders had received
private indications that the application would be successful.
The initiative, which aimed to provided community education and user
support networks in Glasgow's ''north west corridor'', an area of
250,000 people including Ruchill, Maryhill, and Yoker, was refused
funding in May for the fourth consecutive year.
Although the Scottish Office Industry Department, which administers
Urban Aid, rejected the scheme as having ''insufficient priority to
receive funding'', Mrs Fyfe said its details had previously been worked
out and approved in close consulation with another department, Home and
Health.
However, a Scottish Office spokesperson said: ''Applications are
assessed to identify those which best meet the aims and objectives of
the Urban Programme and offer best value for money.''

SOUTH Pacific countries took their anger over the resumption of French
nuclear weapons tests to Paris today but their protest fell on deaf
ears.
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, head of the 15-nation South
Pacific forum, tried to make Paris reconsider its decision to carry out
eight underground blasts at its South Pacific testing site at Mururoa
from September to May next year.
However French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told the Forum, also
represented by officials from New Zealand, Nauru, Western Samoa, and
Papua New Guinea, that the decision was final.
''The outcome is one that does continue to disappoint us,'' Evans told
reporters after a long meeting. ''There are a myriad problems which
still exist as long as these tests continue.''
In a separate meeting, French President Jacques Chirac rejected a
similar plea from Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and said he
would not reverse his decision.
Evans said Forum members would be asked to express their protest
further by considering a suspension of France's dialogue with the Forum
and by boycotting the South Pacific Games to be staged in Papeete,
French Polynesia, in August.
The games are due to bring together some 4000 athletes from around the
region.
Evans told a news conference later that if Paris really believed its
tests posed no risk of accidents or leakage it should hold them on its
mainland, most suitably in its sparsely populated Massif Central
mountain range.
''If they were risk-free, the question must always be asked as to why
they can't be held in Metropolitan France -- on a farm in Provence or
down a mineshaft in Picardie,'' he said.
He also said Paris should use computers to simulate nuclear weapons
tests. If it was not able to do, it should take up an offer he said had
been made by the United States to use its technology.
De Charette reassured the Forum during their 90 minutes of talks that
France would carry out only a limited final series of underground blasts
before signing a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing next year. He said
France would invite scientists to the test site to check there would be
no damage to the environment.
Evans said Australia was worried by the implications of the tests on
the recently renewed nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and said it would
''poison'' negotiations now under way on the planned test ban treaty.
The United States has said it is considering resuming underground
nuclear testing.
However, the Forum did gather some crumbs of comfort from its meeting
with de Charette. These included assurances that France will not be
testing new generation weapons technology.
France carried out 190 nuclear tests in its South Pacific territory
between 1966 and 1991 before former Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand declared a moratorium in 1992.
Chirac said last week that France needed to carry out a final series
of tests to modernise its nuclear strike force before achieving the
capacity to simulate tests in laboratory.
Australia immediately froze defence ties with Paris and banned
refuelling French aircraft and ships involved in the tests. The
Australian public has reacted with hostility and the French consul's
office in Perth was burnt down at the weekend.
Earlier, the Australian Parliament condemned the decision to resume
nuclear tests and Prime Minister Paul Keating told Parliament:
''France's action might well provide a convenient excuse for others who
might want to join the nuclear club and who well might argue that the
commitment of the nuclear weapons states to the eventual elimination of
these weapons is a sham.''--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Community service 'inappropriate', says judge Advocate's wife jailed over drugs</HEADLINE>

AN advocate's wife who admitted cultivating cannabis in the family
home was jailed for 18 months yesterday, after a judge rejected a plea
that community service was an appropriate sentence.
Temporary Judge Robin McEwan, QC, told Rosalind Henderson: ''The
displeasure of the court at production on this scale must not go
unmarked, else it would give out the wrong signal.''
Her husband, Mr Keith Henderson, was also charged with producing
cannabis at their home at Brae of Monzie, near Crieff in Perthshire, but
earlier this month a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found the
charge against him not proven.
Mrs Henderson, 44, admitted cultivating the cannabis between February
1993 and May 31 last year.
During a raid on the Hendersons' home on May 31, police found in a
locked room 13 mature cannabis plants being grown by a soil-less system
using powerful horticultural lamps. A propagating tray with 77 spaces
for seedlings, most of which contained a cannabis plant seedling, were
found in a greenhouse.
Mrs Henderson told the court her husband had nothing to do with the
cultivation. Mr Henderson, 49, who was in court yesterday for the
sentence, admitted he knew about his wife's cannabis-growing operation
but strongly disapproved of it.
Yesterday, Mr Robert Henderson, QC, representing Mrs Henderson, said
that, in 1971, she had suffered severe injuries, including the loss of
an eye, in a car crash. Since her accident, she had been a heavy smoker
of cannabis.
The Hendersons had been married for 17 years and the family lived on
income support of #470 a month plus #105 child benefit. The children
attended a local private school, the fees being met through the assisted
places scheme.
Mr Henderson said his client was now contrite about the unwanted
publicity and grief she had brought on her family and urged the judge to
allow her to serve her sentence in the community.
However, Mr McEwan said the evidence led before the jury disclosed a
deliberate and carefully-planned scheme of production and, since she was
neither wealthy nor in employment, the capital cost of setting up the
production system must be regarded as significant.
Mrs Henderson has three children aged between 15 and 10, and the judge
told her that they must have been aware of what was happening in the
family home, or at least asking questions.
He added: ''I need pass no comment on that. It speaks for itself.''
The judge added: ''It has been said repeatedly over the years that the
misuse of drugs is a serious danger in this country. It is harmful to
health, it leads to misery, and can be life-threatening.
''It encourages crime in many forms -- violence, dishonesty, and often
a form of evil commerce. Vast resources of the state have to be devoted
to the prevention, detection, and prosecution of offences.''
Parliament has laid down serious penalties for offences of this kind,
and the maximum sentence of 14 years for production had to be contrasted
with the five-year maximum for mere possession.
The judge also imposed an 18-month sentence on Robert Ford, 37, a
friend of Mrs Henderson who admitted cultivating cannabis at his former
home at West Mains Farm, Tullibardine, Auchterarder, between February
1993 and May 1994.
Defence counsel, Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, told the court that his client
had been smoking about 20 ''joints'' a day, partly to relieve severe
pain from arthritis.
The amount of cannabis found at his home amounted to about three
months supply for his own use.

A MEMORIAL service was held yesterday for two senior Aberdeen City
Council officials who drowned while on a civic visit to the former
Soviet Union.
A member of Gomel's city executive travelled to Aberdeen to pass on
his city's sympathies to the families and colleagues of Ms Ann Hughes
and Mr Iain McDonald.
Ms Hughes, the council's deputy chief executive, and Mr McDonald, a
principal environmental health officer, died after being hit by the
propellors of a boat while swimming on an excursion during a twinning
visit to Belarus.
Mr Mikhail Gaponenko, speaking in Russian, addressed a packed St
Nicholas Church, in Aberdeen city centre, where families, councillors,
officials, and representatives of the business community remembered the
pair. In his message, translated by the council's twinning officer, Mr
Gaponenko said the two officials would remain in the hearts of all those
in Gomel who knew them.
In his tribute, Aberdeen Lord Provost James Wyness said the untimely
deaths had been a traumatic experience for people in both Aberdeen and
Belarus. Describing them both as young, popular, and hard-working
colleagues who had attained senior positions at early ages, he said he
had been made aware ''of the enormous and high respect which Ann and
Iain were met with in carrying out their professional duties.''
The Lord Provost said Ms Hughes, 44, who was divorced and leaves a
teenage daughter, was never afraid of making hard and difficult
decisions.
Mr McDonald, 36, from Kingswells, near Aberdeen, leaves a widow,
Louise, and two young children, aged four, and six weeks.
The Lord Provost said Mr McDonald's colleagues in the environmental
health department had been particularly upset by his death.

UP to five elderly Scots become homeless every day, a report by the
Scottish Council for Single Homeless and Age Concern (Scotland) has
revealed.
The charities also found most local authorities and housing providers
had no policies aimed at tackling this ''forgotten'' problem.
According to SCSH director Claire Stevens, who will launch the report
at a conference in Edinburgh later today, many people will be
''surprised and shocked'' to learn that people in their 60s, 70s, and
even 80s are not immune to homelessness.
In England, she said, the Government appeared committed to weakening
homelessness legislation and increasing reliance on the private rented
sector and short-lets.
Ms Stevens will warn delegates that the research shows any similar
moves by the Scottish Office would prove disastrous for elderly people
who rely on the safety net offered by the existing law and want the
security of a long-term tenancy.
The report is the result of a year-long study of local authority and
Scottish Office records and interviews with elderly people who had lost
their homes. Its findings show that:
* Marital breakdown is the major cause of older people becoming
homeless but eviction by private landlords and the loss of a tied house
on retirement are other common reasons.
* Many homeless people turn at first to grown-up children for
accomodation but such arrangements may break down in the long term.
* Homeless older people with no children are particularly vulnerable
and may need follow-up support after they have been rehoused.
* Scottish Office statistics under-represent the numbers of homeless
older people because they do not show elderly couples.
The report calls for action to be taken by local authorities, the
Government, and Scottish Homes.
It says councils should not allow retirement from a job with a tied
house to be used as an occasion for invoking homelessness procedures.
In addition, a blanket policy of refusing to rehouse people who have
rent arrears is inappropriate and should be reviewed by councils.
The DSS should review the procedures and regulations relating to
community care grants to homeless older people and the Scottish Office
should improve its system for recording homelessness applications made
to councils, including age monitoring.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke defied the Tory Euro-sceptics twice
yesterday by launching into a detailed debate on the names for the
proposed European single currency and making clear his opposition to a
referendum on British participation.
His comments came after EU finance Ministers appeared to abandon any
hope of a single European currency in 1997, the earliest date envisaged
in the Maastricht Treaty.
Irish Finance Minister Ruari Quinn said after the talks in Luxembourg,
that Ministers -- including Mr Clarke -- from the 15 EU members had
agreed after a lengthy discussion that the single currency should be
introduced in 1999.
''We have agreed 1999 is the year,'' he said as he left the meeting.
The decision to switch the focus from 1997 does not require any change
to the Maastricht Treaty, which contains both dates.
Mr Clarke, a leading Cabinet Euro-enthusiast, held out the example of
Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes of how a single currency could
work efficiently.
He signalled support in principle for the new money being called after
old British coins -- the shilling, crown and florin, but added for the
benefit of other member states: ''I don't have strong views of this.''
He told Ministers that Britain had enjoyed political union for
centuries with different banknotes and said later that he could see no
reason why Scottish banks should not continue to print their own notes
in a single currency with their own national emblems.
The question of whether Scottish notes would become legal tender under
a single currency could not be decided now, he said.
No support was voiced by Ministers for the new money being called the
Ecu, which is the nominal note used in all EU business.
Mr Clarke -- apparently playing his part in the growing fightback by
Euro-enthusiasts in the Conservative Party -- was meeting fellow finance
Ministers in Luxembourg to review the EU's faltering progress towards a
single currency by the end of the century.
He was in Luxembourg at the same time as the Euro-sceptic Welsh
Secretary John Redwood, who left the building refusing to be drawn on
the Chancellor's latest sign that he is prepared to embrace the single
currency, to the fury of Cabinet and backbench critics.
The Chancellor hinted to reporters that because the next stage in
setting up a single currency looks like being delayed until 1999 it was
possible for the Tories to go into a General Election without a firm
policy on joining.
''If we get a substantial debate, we can describe the pros and cons
and the advantages and disadvantages,'' he said. ''But until you get to
this stage no-one will known how the convergence of the economies is
progressing and how Britain should proceed.
''If everyone else is to wait, I cannot see why the British must be
the ones to make a decision now.''
He told EU Ministers he wanted at least 20% of one side of the new
notes to have the Queen's head on them as a national symbol. Ministers
suggested that all of the reverse side of the new notes should be
exclusively European.
However, the council's conclusions were left deliberately vague. The
whole process of economic and monetary union (EMU) now seems certain to
run late. It was supposed to enter its third stage in 1997 but that now
seems out of the question after last night's long and technical
discussion.
''It is a good thing that we can now formally recognise it is further
away,'' Mr Clarke said.
Despite the strong views of the European Commission that the EMU
timetable in Maastricht should be strictly adhered to, Ministers will
report to the Cannes EU summit next week that the planned move to the
next stage in 1997 is not feasible. Hard decisions are more likely then.
Most Ministers believe a fresh start could be made in 1999 when all
participating currencies would lock exchange rates for a year before
moving to a single structure.
This means the British Government would have to take a formal view on
whether to join before January, 1988. The General Election must be held
by the spring of 1997.
Treasury officials were at pains to point out that Mr Clarke was
taking part in ''realistic, hard-headed and practical'' talks on
''irreversible'' moves to a single currency. Britain negotiated the
right to opt out of EMU when Mr Major signed the Maastricht treaty.
In rejecting the idea of a referendum, the Chancellor said he
preferred parliamentary democracy. ''Having settled the policy, we
should stick to the policy. It's a policy on which we united at the last
election. We can unite on it at the next and actually stop going on
about a subject that won't arise until 1999,'' he said.
THE Prime Minister today risked deepening the Tory split on Europe by
putting his name a new pamphlet that mounted a strong attack on
right-wing sceptics.
Mr Major said in the foreword to a document produced by the Positive
European group of Tory MPs that it was a ''constructive contribution''
to the wider debate on Europe.
However, he came under immediate fire from leading Euro-sceptics for
associating himself with the ''abuse'' of what they believe is a small
minority of the parliamentary party.
Mr Major acknowledged that there were wide shades of opinion on Europe
inside the Tory Party but claimed the ''vast majority'' believed Britain
was right to stay in the EU.

THE pay divide is continuing to grow in Scotland and is now almost as
pronounced as the gap in the London area, according to figures published
today.
Analysis carried out by the Scottish Low Pay Unit points to an
underlying weakness in the economy, which is likely to become worse
because of Scotland's increased dependence on service sector jobs.
The unit, using Employment Department figures for last year, found
that the lowest paid 10% of Scottish workers earned #115 a week,
compared with almost #650 for the top 10%, more than five-and-a-half
times higher.
That ratio puts Scotland second only to the south-east of England,
where the comparative figures are #120 and almost #800, a factor of 6.6.
Unit director Morag Gillespie said yesterday that the polarisation of
Scottish incomes should be seen in conjunction with a growth in the
number of employees falling below the low-pay threshold and the fact
that part-time work provided the only increase in jobs. She said: ''As
if the problem of low pay in Scotland was not bad enough already, our
analysis shows the position got worse in 1994. This may be an early
indication of the effect of the abolition of wages councils in August
1993, although we did not expect the impact this quickly.
''It is particularly depressing that the number and proportion of
low-paid part-time workers increased. This is the only significant area
of employment growth, so it is no surprise that consumer spending is
depressed and the feel-good factor is eluding us.''
Ms Gillespie said that, overall, Scottish full-time wage levels
compared reasonably well with other regions of the UK, despite having
suffered the lowest average pay increase in 1994. The rise of 1.3% took
the average weekly wage to #300.80.
However, she warned that the Scottish norm was being bolstered by high
earnings in areas such as Grampian, where lucrative salaries in the oil
industry might not be spent solely within Scotland.

THE topic of anti-social tenants soared up the political agenda
yesterday when Labour unveiled broad proposals to tackle bad neighbours,
and the Scottish Affairs Select Committee promised a formal inquiry.
Public sector housing managers were quick to welcome the prospect of
new legislation and a wide-ranging debate on the problems caused by
serious offenders.
A number of cases, most notably the Grahams of Glenrothes, have
provoked intense feelings in communities across the UK, and exposed the
limitations of current policies.
Local MP Henry McLeish, who suffered personal threats during the
Glenrothes case, spoke yesterday of ''the misery and heartache when one
or two households terrorise more than 1000 families''.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was considering proposals
which could, ultimately, lead to anti-social neighbours being jailed for
their behaviour. Parents of children beneath the age of criminal
responsibility could also face similar sanctions.
He told a Westminster news conference: ''Every citizen and every
family has the right to a quiet life without being subject to harassment
or criminal behaviour by their neighbours.
''But all too often, the lives of thousands of law-abiding residents
are made a misery by the intolerable actions of a gang of youths, a
criminal family, a group intent on racial harassment, or a lone drug
user.''
Labour's consultation paper, A Quiet Life, proposes:
* A new community safety order -- a special kind of injunction -- to
restrain criminal anti-social behaviour by individuals or a group. An
order could be obtained in court on application by a senior police
officer and/or chief executive of a local authority, and breaching it
would be punishable by imprisonment.
* Better witness protection, including only a sworn written statement
from a complainant, not a court appearance.
* A new composite charge to deal with a series of linked incidents of
anti-social behaviour or harassment, which are currently usually
prosecuted as single charges and thus attract lesser penalties.
Mr Straw said he was looking at the possibility of complementary
parental responsibility orders for children under the minimum criminal
age, which is eight in Scotland. Such children were often used by older
trouble-makers to perpetrate nuisance because they could not be
prosecuted.
He added: ''The proposals are tough and are designed to be. But they
are proportionate to the disruption faced by many communities.''
Meanwhile, the Scottish Affairs Committee has announced its next
inquiry will be into housing and anti-social behaviour, which it
describes as ''a widespread and growing problem'' particularly, but not
exclusively, on public housing estates.
A spokesman said the committee would examine a wide range of related
issues and invited views from all interested parties before October.
The two approaches to the issue were welcomed by Mr Peter Loutit,
director of housing for Inverness District Council, who has been
advocating radical solutions.
He said: ''We must always look at individual cases but it is important
that people take responsibility for their own actions, because society
is sick and tired of disruptive behaviour.
''There must be a punitive remedy available to ensure that good
tenants get relief from these pernicious problems.''
Mr Jackson Greenhorn, Glasgow district's assistant chief housing
officer, said: ''We welcome the debate and any useful ideas that emerge
from it. But they should be looked at carefully, without seeking quick
fixes.''
Scottish Homes, the country's second largest landlord, also hailed the
heightened political interest in the problem.
Mr Richard Burn, director of housing management, said: ''Any measures
that assist housing managers with anti-social tenants are to be
welcomed, as the actions of a very small minority can make life
miserable for the majority.''

TELEVISION presenter Kirsty Young, who yesterday announced that her
Scottish Television chat show was moving to a new late-night slot, is to
join the BBC Holiday programme as a roving reporter.
Ms Young, 26, whose afternoon show Kirsty attracts 300,000 viewers,
said she was looking forward to the new challenge.
She left the staff of Scottish Television yesterday to go freelance,
to allow her to do the Holiday programme and consider other offers. She
said she would be stepping back from her role as one of STV's regular
news presenters.
Scottish Television's broadcasting director, Mr Blair Jenkins, said
that because the Kirsty show was currently going out late in the
afternoon, most people never got the chance to see it. He said her new
show would be going out in the autumn at 11pm. Other projects involving
her were also being discussed, he said.
He added that the change of time would allow Ms Young to be able to
deal frankly with adult issues on the programme.
Details of Ms Young's new job emerged as she announced details of a
top-level conference on Scottish tourism to be held at the new Edinburgh
International Conference Centre on October 30.
Yesterday, Mr Derek Reid, chief executive of the Scottish Tourist
Board, talking of the importance of Scotland's Hospitality Industry
Congress, said tourism must move with the times and was an important
part of the Scottish economy. The tourism industry sustains 185,000
people in employment and generates #2000m annually.

THE latest stage in the grand plan to make Glasgow city centre safer
was launched yesterday when 16 uniformed stewards and a complementary
squad of 12 street cleaners took to the streets.
The ''city centre representatives'' -- to give them their official
title -- will be ''the front line'' in maintaining the ''feel-good
factor'' in an area bounded by High Street, George Square, Hope Street,
and Argyle Street, daily from 8am to 8pm over the next 12 months.
Their tasks will include:
* Monitoring and reporting environmental problems.
* Welcoming and assisting visitors to the area by acting as human
signposts.
* Supporting city-centre initiatives -- such as the Christmas
programme.
The initiative is phase two of City Watch, launched last autumn to
monitor the city centre's business and public spaces to ensure a safer
environment for all.
Last week, Strathclyde Police Chief Constable Leslie Sharp reported a
dramatic fall in crime in the city centre of 20% in the first six months
of the City Watch campaign. It involved businessmen contributing towards
the cost of closed-circuit television security cameras.
Launching the latest stage of the initiative in Glasgow City Chambers
yesterday, Mr Forbes Macpherson, Glasgow Development Agency chairman,
pointed out that Glasgow had the largest retail sales in the UK outside
London and was the third most popular tourist destination in Britain. He
added: ''It is important that Glasgow invests in looking good and
feeling good about itself.''

SCOTTISH Office Industry Minister George Kynoch was ridiculed last
night after describing the demise of Health Care International's
hospital at Clydebank as ''a slight hiccup''.
The project cost taxpayers millions and promised 1800 jobs but
receivers were called in just 110 days after the official opening.
Mr Kynoch, who took over recently from Mr Allan Stewart, chose to
focus on inward investment successes when he presented Locate In
Scotland's annual report.
He highlighted 97 projects involving planned investment of more than
#1100m, creating or safeguarding more than 12,300 jobs.
However, he did warn that that record would be difficult to sustain
and conceded that rationalisation by multi-national companies in Europe
may pose a threat to Scottish plants.
HCI merited only one paragraph in the 32-page review to March 31,
1995, with the Abu Dhabi take-over said to secure the hospital's future,
safeguard jobs already created, and, in due course, provide ''many more
jobs in Clydebank, as originally envisaged''.
When asked specifically about HCI, Mr Kynoch signalled that it was
just one project and he wanted to talk about a vast number of success
stories.
He pointed to the recent announcement that hospital jobs would from
350 to 420 and added it was ''obviously disappointing that there was a
slight hiccup in the project as a whole''.
Asked if a slight hiccup was an accurate reflection of the situation,
he argued that, when seeking inward investment, risks had to be taken to
win the rewards.
All advice had pointed to a successful product but the hospital's
target markets overseas had not picked up as quickly as expected and led
to financial difficulties and the appointment of a receiver.
However, Scotland now had one of western Europe's most modern
hospitals and it was hoped to build on that.
Last night, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson
predicted the Public Accounts Committee would discover this week that
Government support for US-based HCI to open the private hospital was no
less than a huge scandal.
He said: ''If HCI was a slight hiccup, I would love to know how Mr
Kynoch would describe 'real' problems.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said the Tory MP's comments came from the Jim
Callaghan ''what crisis?'' school of understatement, adding that Mr
Kynoch should now consider his position as Minister.
Scottish Liberal Democrats' leader Jim Wallace said: ''If HCI is a
hiccup, heaven help Scotland if a Government mistake ever gives George
Kynoch indigestion.''
''The Government really ought to learn the lessons from the failure
with much greater seriousness than appears to be the case.''
A National Audit Office report into taxpayers' money for the project,
estimated at almost #30m, is expected to be made public today. It will
be examined by the Public Accounts Committee investigation into
Government support for HCI, which opens tomorrow.
The audit report is understood to be scathing of the sums poured into
the hospital, subsequently sold to the Abu Dhabi Investment Company,
with the receivers adamant that the project was practically a hollow
shell almost from the word go.
Mr Kynoch's ''hiccup'' ruined the success story as outlined by the LIS
report.
It had recorded NEC's #530m wafer fabrication plant at Livingston as
Scotland's largest single inward investment; Motorola's #250m East
Kilbride expansion as the firm's biggest in Europe; and forecast 1000
full-time jobs from BSkyB's subscriber centre in Dunfermline.
However, although planned investment had soared from #587.6m in
1993-94 to #1126.6m in 1994-95, the number of created or safeguarded
jobs for the year only rose from 11,072 to 12,239.

What raised it to an issue of national significance was the fact that

'The Labour leaders were big fish in a small pond in Monklands but
they won't be in North Lanarkshire. Their little empire is finished.'
Councillor Tommy Morgan
Corruption claims became political dynamite. Keith Sinclair looks at
how the fuse was lit
THE Monklands affair -- which has made the council's name a byword for
local government scandal -- began less than three years ago when four
so-called rebel Labour councillors accused their ruling administration
of corruption and impropriety.
What raised it to an issue of national significance, though, was the
fact that half of the district -- including Airdrie -- was in the
Monklands East constituency of former Labour leader, the late John
Smith.
That, and Mr Smith's failure to intervene, attracted the attention of
Labour's rivals and in particular the Tory MP for Dover, Mr David Shaw,
who clearly saw it as an opportunity to make political capital by
focusing on Labour's local government record in its leader's own back
yard.
The local newspaper, the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, had begun
investigating the matter but it was only when the rebel councillors from
Airdrie made public allegations of nepotism regarding recruitment,
housing, and contracts from September 1992 that the affair started to
make national headlines.
The rebels had warned their leaders of a storm ahead some weeks
earlier when they resigned as vice-conveners of various committees,
claiming that the convenerships of other committees did not reflect the
geographical spread of Monklands or the ability of individual
councillors.
Many of the allegations that the ruling council cabal operated a
''jobs for the boys system'' stemmed from the use of differently
coloured forms for the same jobs -- used, according to critics, to
favour political friends and relatives.
Councillors, who became known as the Monklands Mafia, were also
accused of a spending bias in favour of mostly Roman Catholic Coatbridge
against neighbouring Airdrie, where most of the population is Protestant
-- although the rebels stressed that the religious aspect was introduced
by the media and not them.
The claims ranged from unfair siting of the #14m Time Capsule leisure
complex and Summerlee Heritage Park in Coatbridge to the charge that
waste bins in Airdrie were washed less frequently than those in the
adjacent town.
The councillors consistently have denied the allegations.
The rebels' opposition to the Labour group resulted in the four --
Councillors Peter Sullivan, Tommy Morgan, Jim Logue, and Brian Brady --
being suspended at various times by the group for breaches of local
party discipline.
These included publicly attacking the council and voting against the
group at a council meeting in March 1993, when they defied the Labour
whip to oppose plans to spend cash aimed at enticing businesses to
locate at the Quadrant shopping centre in Coatbridge.
Appeals against the suspensions were lodged with the appeals committee
of the Labour Party's Scottish executive and, in most cases, the period
of suspension was reduced.
The most controversial appeal was that by Councillor Morgan who had
been suspended for a fixed term of six months from November 1992 and
then returned to the group briefly before the Quadrant vote resulted in
him being suspended indefinitely.
His appeal was rejected and he was allowed back into the group only
last October after almost a year in the political wilderness.
Following the appeals, and pressure from Labour Party wards in both
Airdrie and Coatbridge, an internal inquiry into procedures within the
council was carried out by the Scottish Labour Party executive in
October 1992.
The inquiry report, issued in March 1993, said all claims regarding
irregularities should be passed to the Government, the Accounts
Commission, and the police.
Despite repeated requests for a Government inquiry from Mr Smith, the
Scottish Office took no action. Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said that,
although he had power to hold an inquiry under the Local Government
(Scotland) Act, no evidence had been presented that Monklands had been
in breach of its statutory duties.
The Accounts Commission also decided that no action was necessary
while an investigation by Strathclyde Police concerning complaints of a
range of alleged corrupt practices involving councillors is still
continuing.
The Labour inquiry report did recommend a number of changes intended
to modernise and improve procedures in Monklands, including the
appointment of a recruitment consultant.
These were later accepted and implemented by the council, although the
rebels claimed there were no significant changes in the committee
structure.
The inquiry also dismissed comments from political opponents and some
of the media coverage of the affair as a politically-inspired campaign
designed to discredit the two local MPs, Mr Smith and former Shadow
Scottish Secretary Tom Clarke.
However, the council's credibility was further undermined in May 1993,
when councillors were told by independent consultants that they were
guilty of interfering in staff recruitment and selection.
In a critical report, the consultants, Ashdown Millan, added that
councillors' involvement in recruitment must cease in all but the most
senior positions.
However, the consultants, who were called in by the council, found no
evidence of religious bias in selecting employees.
Lawyers finally became involved in the affair in June 1993, when the
council leader, Mr Jim Brooks, instructed his solicitors to send letters
to a series of critics, warning of possible claims for damages over
alleged defamatory statements.
Mr Smith's earlier backing of Councillor Brooks by nominating him as a
non-executive director of Monklands and Bellshill Hospital Trust was
also an important factor.
Despite tremendous pressure to intervene, Mr Smith refused to take
sides in the controversy, laying himself open to allegations of weak
leadership. At one point, the rebel councillors picketed his surgery, to
his considerable embarrassment.
Mr Smith did, however, challenge Mr Lang to authorise an inquiry into
the affair and told him that, if he had no grounds for establishing an
inquiry, he should ensure that the allegations against the council were
withdrawn.
The bruising by-election campaign which followed Mr Smith's death in
May 1994 was dominated by the affair.
Early in the contest, the subsequent victor, Labour's Helen Liddell,
stuck faithfully to the party line that the allegations had been
investigated and were mere ''tittle-tattle''.
However, access to details of council spending, which indicated a
concentration of capital expenditure in Coatbridge, together with
canvass returns after a few days on the doorsteps, led her to admit
there was an ''unacceptable'' spending bias.
Votes had been haemorrhaging to the Scottish National Party but her
decision to take on the council on the issue stemmed the flow and was
widely regarded as the turning point in her campaign.
However, according to the rebel councillors, there was a consensus in
the Labour Party at the time that Mrs Liddell would struggle to win the
seat without their endorsement.
They claimed they were allowed back into the group in return for their
endorsement on the instructions of the Labour Party executive, adding
that they had sought, as a pre-condition, an assurance that they would
be eligible as future Labour candidates at local elections.
Mrs Liddell's U-turn led directly to her view being contradicted by Mr
Clarke in neighbouring Monklands West, and later (to be retracted) by Mr
Jimmy Wray, chairman of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party.
Mr Clarke, a former provost of the council, dismissed the allegations
as ''McCarthyite smears''.
The split in Labour ranks provided ammunition for the SNP, which said
a surge in support for its candidate, Ms Kay Ullrich, had provoked a
panicked response from Labour and slashed the late Mr Smith's 16,000
majority to a mere 1640.
Mrs Liddell vowed to fight to restore the balance of financial
investment in the district but Councillor Brooks made repeated
assertions that there had been no inequality.
She demanded a public inquiry ''to get at the truth'' and, in November
last year, the council gave the go-ahead for the independent inquiry
chaired by Professor Black, despite receiving no assurances from the
Scottish Office that they would not be surcharged over its cost.
During that same month, Monklands Provost Robert Gilson's death
brought a melancholy end to a chapter in the long-running affair. To the
end, he had denied the charges against the council and, shortly before
his death, he spoke of his anger at ''groundless allegations'' costing
Monklands dear in terms of inward investment and jobs.
Councillor Brooks and Mr Eric Burns, the new provost and the only
Airdrie-born councillor on the Labour group, swept to victory in the
local elections last April -- with voters delivering what many regarded
as an overwhelming vote of confidence in the Labour leaders. Two of
their chief critics, rebel Councillor Brady and Airdrie SNP Councillor
Neil Douglas, lost their seats.
However, the notorious name of Monklands is to be wiped off the
political map when local government re-organisation takes the area into
the new North Lanarkshire unitary authority, which combines Motherwell,
Monklands, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, and part of Strathkelvin from next
April.
That will come as a considerable relief to the Labour Party
nationally, whose image has been badly dented by the affair.
There was another clear sign that the Scottish party hierarchy hopes
to consign the whole affair to the history books when Councillor Brooks
failed in his bid for deputy leadership of the new authority, despite
having hailed his election success as a total vindication of his tenure
as Monklands leader. This was reinforced when his allies also failed to
gain any senior posts in the council's ruling Labour group.
From the new appointments there appeared to be a resolve that the
Monklands factor should not taint the new authority in its formative
days.
As Councillor Morgan put it last week: ''The Labour leaders were big
fish in a small pond in Monklands but they won't be in North
Lanarkshire. Their little empire is finished.''

THE Prime Minister gained some relief yesterday from a subtle change
in mood of his party at Westminster after a weekend when Tory factions
reassessed the situation. Both Mr Major and Mr Michael Heseltine rode
the punches easily during two hours of Commons questioning.
A maverick bid by former Cabinet Minister Kenneth Baker to promote
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo for Tory leader looked like
foundering after Major and Heseltine had handled questions on the
arms-to-Iran affair affecting Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken.
A pre-emptive strike by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke on Breakfast Radio
yesterday, warning Tory dissidents that Mr Portillo as leader might
bring the Government down, seemed to have arrested the slide towards
defeat.
Last night, leading Euro-sceptics were taking a cool Monday look at
the trouble they had inadvertently created last week through their
meeting with the Prime Minister. One of them told me: ''My forecast
today is that there will be a leadership challenge to Mr Major in
November and that he will wipe the floor with the challenger.''
Last night, Mr Baker, a party chairman dropped by Margaret Thatcher,
went on BBC Panorama to claim that Conservatives were looking for a
reaffirmation of their belief and would support Mr Portillo. The
Chancellor, forewarned, set out yesterday morning to kill off any
prospect of a Portillo bid for the leadership.
European policy had been settled by the manifesto in the 1992 General
Election. ''We can unite on it at the next election and actually stop
going on about a subject that won't arise until 1999.''
He went on: ''I think the Conservative Party should support the leader
it has got. He's a decent, good Prime Minister. He's pursuing the
policies on which he was elected. There is no section of the party that
should turn around and start demanding a price for unity.''
It was emerging that the Tory Europeans were hardening their attitude
as their party plunges further into chaos. The Chancellor yesterday was
endorsing their weekend message that, should Portillo oust Major as Tory
leader, they would not support him in a vote of confidence in the
Commons that would surely follow. Mr Clarke told the plotters: ''If
there's a change in the autumn, if the people who went along to this
meeting last week (the 'Fresh Start' anti-European fanatics) were by any
mischance to succeed, the party is still set up on its policy clearly
set out in the manifesto.''
Last night at the Commons, several senior Tories who attended the
Fresh Start meeting were complaining in private that it had been invaded
by some irresponsible ''new'' members. However, they now reflect that
the way the media reported the meeting was highly damaging to Mr Major
in a way they had not intended.
In the Commons, Labour leader Tony Blair attempted to exploit what he
called ''indisciplined shennanigans'' within the Conservative Party when
the Prime Minister reported on his attendance of the G7 economic summit
in Halifax, Canada. Mr Blair claimed that the Prime Minister's authority
at the summit had been undermined, along with that of the nation,
because of Tory dissent. The Prime Minister was able to parry this
allegation.
Mr Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, was able to do the same
when attacked by Labour spokesman Jack Cunningham, launching a debate
demanding an independent judicial inquiry into BMARC and its activities
in providing arms to Iran in the 1980s. Labour's target was Mr Jonathan
Aitken, a former non-executive director of the company but the attack
was not quite driven home.
Afterwards, Tory morale was slightly lifted both by the Commons
performances of the Prime Minister and Mr Heseltine.

GRAVE doubts emerged yesterday over the Government's controversial
decision to award the #5500m Trident submarine refit contract to
Devonport dockyard at the expense of Rosyth, following reports that the
Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into spiralling costs
at the Plymouth yard.
Doubts centre on its ability to meet new nuclear safety requirements
within the costs of the bid it tabled in 1993.
Opposition MPs yesterday called for the decision to award Devonport
the submarine refitting contract to be reversed after it was suggested
that preparatory work to convert the dry docks at the south of England
dockyard had risen to an estimated #500m -- compared to the #120m
promised.
The latest salvo comes after The Herald revealed exclusively in April
that problems were being encountered at the South of England yard. These
were denied strenuously at the time but less than a month later the
Government admitted that Rosyth Dockyard could still continue repairing
nuclear submarines.
Devonport was promised the Trident refits after undercutting the
Rosyth yard in Fife by #10m.
Last month, Mr Roger Freeman, who is expected to fill the Defence
Procurement Minister role, acknowledged concern over the cost of basing
Trident work at Devonport and concentrating surface ship refits at
Rosyth.
Although defence chiefs are said to be confident that the review would
confirm the Government's decision, there is understood to be deep
disquiet about the emerging costs of constructing the new nuclear
facilities at the yard.
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said any
re-evaluation would show the Government's original decision to have been
''short-sighted and wholly inadequate''. He called for the entire future
of Rosyth to be re-examined.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, the Labour MP for Dunfermline East,
called on the MoD to ''come clean'' on the behind-the-scenes activity
affecting the Devonport contract.
A Scottish National Party spokesman said: ''The Ministry of Defence
does not need to waste money on a top-secret review. The people of
Scotland already know that when Rosyth was passed over the Tories
ignored the safety, strategic, and financial arguments and based their
decision solely on short-term political gain.''
An MoD spokesman said negotiations were continuing with DML, the
company that runs the Plymouth yard. The yard is expected to submit new
estimates by early next month.
Although costs are expected to be significantly higher than
Devonport's original bid, the MoD said it believed the problems could be
overcome. The spokesman added, however: ''Any contract awarded would
need to be based on offers made at the time of the original 1993
decision and would have to be justifiable on that basis.''

A STORE manager who sold stolen tractor parts to pay his mortage was
told by a sheriff yesterday to repay #5000 to the company he defrauded.
This would mean the sale of his house, the court in Stirling heard.
John Hammond stole spares from the stores he managed at Agricar Ltd in
Springkerse, Stirling. He entering codes into a computer to make it look
as if the stock never existed and sold the stolen spares under the
counter between March and December 1993.
Hammond, 34, was confronted by company officials at his home at
Dickies Well, Alva, and admitted taking #5000 worth of parts.
Sheriff Robert Younger gave Hammond six months to pay back his
employers. He also sentenced him to 160 hours of community service.
Defence agent Virgil Crawford said Hammond and his wife were now
living on benefit and had put their house on the market to clear mortage
arrears.
The court heard that Hammond had arrears of #3000 and other debts of
some #2000, with a mortgage of #34,000.
Mr Crawford confirmed that Hammond should just be able to meet the
compensation order if the home sold for #50,000.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang was considering Government intervention
last night after claims of nepotism and spending bias in Monklands were
upheld by an independent investigator.
Professor Robert Black delivered his critical report to a
highly-charged district council meeting in Coatbridge last night -- then
revealed that criminal allegations had been brought to him which he had
passed on to the Crown Office.
Mr Lang has the power to order a formal inquiry into a local authority
if he believes it has failed to carry out its statutory duty.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''Ministers have made it quite clear
on a number of occasions in response to the allegations about Monklands
District Council, that the Government is prepared to set up a formal
inquiry . . .if there is any evidence that the council has breached its
statutory duties. To date, no such evidence has been received.
''The file, however, remains open and the Secretary of State has
instructed officials to urgently consider Professor Black's independent
assessment, to see whether such evidence now exists.''
The report, however, disappointed critics who had hoped that names
would be named and individual blame apportioned.
Professor Black found:
* Allegations of illegal conduct which he had passed on to the Crown
Office.
* A spending rift on major projects between Catholic Coatbridge and
Protestant Airdrie for ''political'' reasons.
* Nepotism in the recruitment policies of Monklands -- 16 out of 21
councillors had relations working for the council, some with several
close relatives on the payroll.
* Religious favouritism, but only in the context of nepotism, rather
than for sectarian reasons as such.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson conceded last night that
the report painted a ''serious and very disturbing picture'' which
Labour would act on firmly and decisively.
He added, however, that it was indefensible that the Government had
not taken on the investigation and had instead allowed Ministers to
repeat uninvestigated allegations ''without lifting a hand''. A Labour
Secretary of State would act instead of making political capital, he
said.
Monklands East MP Helen Liddell said: ''The existence of nepotism is
glaring and wholly unacceptable. Such conduct is deplorable and
indefensible. Much of the anger of my constituents follows from local
knowledge of what has been going on.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''There should now be a rash of
by-elections in the new authority, in order to allow the people the
final judgment.''
Scottish Tory Chairman Sir Michael Hirst said the Black report
amounted to a ''day of shame for Labour''.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the report proved
that the abuse of power by one party in power for too long was not a
phenomenon confined to the Tories at Westminster.
Professor Black said numerous allegations of criminal activity had
been made to him during the course of his investigation -- but he had
been barred from personally investigating them because of the remit of
his report.
Speaking on the front steps of Monklands District Council municipal
buildings Professor Black said: ''If any allegation was made of criminal
conduct then I was not to proceed to investigate that matter but bring
it to the attention of the Crown Office and the Lord Advocate.
''Allegations have been made and have been transmitted to the Crown
Office or Lord Advocate.''
Asked if allegations had been made against serving councillors he
replied: ''In some cases, yes.''
Earlier, in the council chamber, after a short meeting to present the
inquiry report the press were asked to leave the building and conduct
interviews outside. Councillor Jim Brooks, the council's leader, refused
to comment on the inquiry findings. He said: ''I'm not saying anything
at all tonight. I'm going to read the documents, it is very important
that you read the documents.''
The catalogue of actual and potential misconduct was not defended by
the Scottish Labour Party, which has been embarrassed by Monklands, nor
did political opponents miss their chance to hit the mark.
Councillor Brian Brady, widely regarded as the spokesman for the
Airdrie rebel Labour councillors, said his group's position had been
vindicated by Professor Black's report.
''Airdrie was discriminated against,'' he said. ''This inquiry
vindicates the position we have previously taken. We hope to see other
bodies now taking up these matters.''
And on the criminal allegations highlighted in Professor Black's
report he added: ''I think it's time that action was taken.''
He said the inquiry had also picked out the abuse of jobs which had
taken place within the council. ''The professor has highlighted that,
even during the time of his investigation, people were being appointed
without jobs being advertised.''
He added that the claims of religious bigotry were not the main issue
in Monklands and that had been backed up by Professor Black's report.
''I never raised the sectarianism matter and I don't think that ever was
in the front line.''
The SNP's group press spokesman, Councillor Neil Douglas, said that a
full and wide ranging inquiry into the operations of Monklands District
Council, since its inception, must now be carried out.
''These councillors were stretching the bounds of the democratic
process. A number of councillors quite freely and quite deliberately
abandoned the trust of the people of Monklands.
''However, this whole sorry affair in my opinion had nothing to do
with religion discrimination.''

ANOTHER Scott inquiry leak bombshell exploded under the Government
last night. In his draft report of the arms-to-Iraq inquiry Sir Richard
Scott concludes that Ministers deliberately misled Parliament and the
public, concealing a change in policy which lead to a wider range of
weapons being exported to President Saddam Hussein's regime.
He condemns two other Ministers as well as Mr William Waldegrave, the
Agriculture Minister, then at the Foreign Office, already named in a
previous leak. Mr Alan Clark, who was at Defence, and Lord Trefgarne,
who served at Trade and Industry and Defence during the late 1980s are,
with him, accused of ''turning a Nelsonian blind eye'' to changes in
arms sales.
The further leak will infuriate those who have appeared before the
inquiry and one witness who has received a draft criticising his
behaviour is considering going public with his rebuttal.
There are now likely to be even stronger attacks both on the way the
inquiry was handled by Sir Richard when sitting, and also complaints
that he simply does not understand the need for Government departments
to observe confidentiality in sensitive matters such as arms sales.
The charge of misleading Parliament and public is one of the most
serious which can be levelled against a government and the signs are
that, far from accepting Sir Richard's conclusions, the Government are
likely to take the strongest issue with many of them.
The three named Ministers agreed in December 1988 that guidelines on
defence sales to Iraq should be relaxed.
Mr Waldegrave, in his evidence to the inquiry, strenuously argued that
because the policy had not changed -- only the way it was implemented --
there was no need to tell MPs.
However, in his draft extract Sir Richard said that position was
''incapable of being sustained by serious argument''.
He said: ''Parliament and the public were designedly led to believe a
different policy was being applied than in fact was the case.
''The answers to parliamentary questions in both Houses of Parliament
failed to inform Parliament of the state of Government policy.
''This failure was deliberate and was the inevitable result of the
agreement between the three junior Ministers that publicity should not
be given to the decision.''
Sir Richard said in the leaked draft extract that he believed the
decision not to publicise the change in policy -- shortly after the
gassing of the Kurds by Saddam Hussein -- had been taken because of fear
of upsetting public opinion.
''I have come to the conclusion that the overriding and determinant
reason was the fear of strong public opposition to the loosening of the
restrictions and the consequential fear that the pressure of opposition
might be deterimental to British trading interests,'' he said.
Sir Richard also criticised Ministers over their decision to allow
firms such as Matrix Churchill to sell machine tools to Iraq despite
intelligence warnings that they were being used to make weapons.
''The reliance on the possibility of civilian use and the lack of
certainty of the intended military use had become, in my opinion, the
equivalent of the Nelsonian use of the blind eye,'' he said in the
draft, leaked to ITN.

<HEADLINE>Censor defends his decision to pass video on executions</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S official film censor last night defended his decision to
grant a certificate to a film featuring real-life executions after high
street retailer W H Smith withdrew the video from sale.
Mr James Ferman, director of the British Board of Film Classification,
said Executions was a serious film and ''not a video nasty''.
The film's makers also sprang to its defence, claiming it was a
genuine attempt to show the reality of capital punishment.
However, one Tory MP alleged it was ''little more than dramatised
sensationalism'' and there were calls for an inquiry into how it came to
be given an 18 certificate.
The film features footage of 21 executions from around the world,
including the gassing of a convicted murderer in the US, beheadings in
Saudi Arabia, and the bodies of torture victims in former Yugoslavia.
W H Smith executives decided to withdraw the 55-minute video from sale
''with immediate effect'' after watching it yesterday.
The controversy appeared to have boosted sales, with distributors NTV
claiming to have sold more than 100,000 copies and doubled the
production run to meet demand after just a day in the shops.
The John Menzies group, which bought several hundred copies, said its
shops had sold out, although it was reviewing whether to order new stock
in the wake of the row.
Other major chains, including HMV and the Virgin Megastores/Our Price
group, said they would not act as censors and withdraw the video after
it was passed by the BBFC.
One of the film's researchers, Mr James Hunt, angrily dismissed claims
of sensationalism and said the production team was ''very disappointed''
with W H Smith's decision.
''We've arranged for the producers to meet the (W H Smith) board next
week to discuss the video. We very much hope that, once the media hype
has died down, we will be able to persuade them to change their minds,''
he said.
Mr Hunt said researchers on the film had received menacing telephone
calls from people acting for some of the countries whose capital
punishment policies were being featured.
''People are speaking from a position of ignorance. We wanted to
highlight what death is really about,'' he added.
Human rights charity Amnesty International said it had pulled out of
the project because of the video's ''sensationalist'' approach.
Mr Roger Gale, MP for Thanet North and chairman of the Conservative
media committee, urged other retailers to ban the video.
''It would appear to be little more than dramatised sensationalism of
a particularly unpleasant kind, highlighted with 'theme' music and sound
effects more likely to appeal to the ghoul than anyone interested in the
serious arguments relating to the death penalty,'' he said.

THE death of a senior Strathclyde Regional Council offical, who fell
from a 12th floor office window, has been described by police as ''a
tragic accident''.
Mr Michael Fitzhenry, 51, of Milngavie, was found dead at the rear of
finance department offices in Queen Street early on Friday evening. A
spokesman for Strathclyde Police said yesterday: ''There is nothing to
suggest that it was anything other than a tragic accident. A report has
been sent to the procurator-fiscal.''

QUEEN'S Counsel William Nimmo Smith, one of the authors of the report
into the so-called Magic Circle case, has been appointed as a temporary
judge, one of nine in Scotland.
Mr Nimmo Smith's appointment could be a stepping stone to a permanent
job on the Bench. Mr Donald Macfadyen QC, his immediate predecessor as a
''temp'', has now become a permanent judge with the judicial title of
Lord Macfadyen.
Along with Mr James Friel, regional procurator-fiscal for North
Strathclyde, Mr Nimmo Smith was asked by the Lord Advocate in 1992 to
investigate persistent claims that there was a homosexual conspiracy to
pervert the course of justice in a number of criminal cases.
In general terms, the report gave the legal profession a clean bill of
health and supported the findings of an investigation by the Herald,
which found that the gay conspiracy theory was based largely on rumour,
gossip, and innuendo.
Mr Nimmo Smith, 52, was educated at Eton, Balliol College, and
Edinburgh University. He was called to the Bar in 1969, took silk in
1982, and, one year later, began a spell as a highly effective
prosecutor in the High Court.
He has been involved in a number of important civil actions, notably
the case in which he successfully argued all the way to the House of
Lords that the Government should not be allowed to prevent newspaper
publication of extracts from the memoirs of former M16 officer Anthony
Cavendish.

AN INJURED survivor of the weekend Turkish holiday coach crash was
under intensive care in an Austrian hospital last night after being
taken off a flight to Glasgow.
The plane, an air ambulance operated by a Swiss company, had made a
refuelling stop at Graz airport when the condition of the patient, one
of two on the flight, worsened.
The medical escorts decided the patient, who has not been identified,
was not fit to fly any further.
The second patient, a middle-aged man with chest injuries, carried on
to Glasgow and was ''serious but stable'' last night in the Royal
Infirmary.
About 20 survivors and their relatives are expected to fly to Glasgow
today. They will be met by a team from the Royal, led by accident and
emergency consultant Rudy Crawford.
The Royal expects to admit five, and eight have been assigned to the
Southern General, including three with spinal injuries. However, chief
executive Bob Calderwood said last night: ''Apparently there is no
neurological damage and they can be expected to recover after
treatment.''
Mrs Mhairi Telford, 23, from Dundee; Miss Catriona Currie, 48, from
Lenzie; and Mr Raymond Hassey, 41, from Edinburgh, were killed on
Saturday when a coach taking them from Dalaman Airport to the resort of
Marmaris collided with a lorry and plunged into a gully.
Mr Sean Telford was among those expected to arrive home today, still
shocked by the horrific crash which left him trapped for more than two
hours beside the body of his wife.
The 24-year-old bank teller, who is said to be ''very distressed'',
wants to fly home with the body of Mhairi, 23, his wife of 13 months.
It is understood that Mr Telford, who has two broken legs and a broken
collar-bone, might have to be encased in plaster for the journey.
His life was saved by two nurses from Hamilton who were in a following
coach. They administered first-aid and took him to hospital in a taxi,
strapped to a scaffolding board. Mr Telford, of East Balgillo, Dundee,
was seated with his wife behind the driver's seat when the head-on
collision occurred.
His father, Edward, and mother, Linda, flew to Turkey within hours of
the news, along with Mhairi's sister, Kirsty. Mr Telford Sr has been in
touch with the nurses to thank them for their help.

<HEADLINE>Hospital electrician accused of Stobhill stabbing Man charged with murder of nurse</HEADLINE>

A HOSPITAL electrician faced a charge of murder yesterday, as staff
and patients mourned a ''devoted'' nursing sister they saw fatally
wounded before their eyes.
Mr Steven McGowan, 30, of Meadowburn, Bishopbriggs, made a brief
appearance in private at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
He was charged with murdering 32-year-old Irene Duffy, of Glenacre
Road, Carbrain, Cumbernauld, in Ward 2A of Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow,
on Sunday night.
Mr McGowan, who worked at the same hospital, is alleged to have
stabbed her repeatedly about the head, body, and limbs with a knife.
His lawyer, Mr Desmond Finnieston, made no plea or declaration and
Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell remanded the accused in custody for further
inquiries.
Sister Duffy, who had worked at Stobhill since leaving school at the
age of 17 to train as a nurse, lived with parents John Duffy, 57, a
retired book-binder, and Irene, 56, who is an auxiliary at Stobhill. She
also had a brother and sister.
She had a son Christopher, who will be three tomorrow, and had
previously lived in Bishopbriggs. Yesterday Christopher, unaware of the
tragedy, was being cared for by his mother's family.
Mr and Mrs Duffy described their daughter as ''a professional,
dedicated to her work''. Most of her time off she spent with her son,
they said.
The 15 patients in the ward, mostly elderly women convalescing from
fractured bones, were moved to another ward as police moved in to begin
an investigation.
After the incident, Sister Duffy was rushed to the hospital's
intensive care unit, where colleagues tried for more than two hours to
save her. A consultant surgeon, Mr John Smith, was among staff called in
from home to help. He performed on-the-spot surgery in the intensive
care unit but to no avail.
Yesterday, the chairman of Stobhill NHS Trust, also named John Smith,
expressed his deepest sympathy to Sister Duffy's family on behalf of
everyone at Stobhill. She had been a long-serving, loyal, and devoted
member of staff since joining Stobhill from school 15 years ago.
''This is a very close-knit hospital community,'' he said. ''She was
known to many and will be missed by many. The staff in general are
shocked by the happenings of last night, and management will obviously
be doing all it can to minimise the effects of this, both in the short
and long term.''
''Obviously they and the patients were very distressed and are in need
of continuing support, which we are providing,'' said Mr Smith.
Three nurses, all female, were on duty on the ward along with Sister
Duffy, who began her shift at 1.30pm and was due to have finished at
9.30.
''The staff who were in the ward at the time are obviously shocked and
they have been offered counselling through our occupational health
service,'' said Mr Smith.
Although a review has been ordered into security measures at the
hospital, he said that, on the basis of the evidence available,
management believed the incident was unforeseeable and incapable of
being planned against.
Stobhill has night guards patrolling the hospital grounds, security
lighting, and cameras monitoring the corridors, but no cameras trained
on the wards.
Acting chief executive, Dr Leslie Honeyman, said: ''Our security is
geared towards preventing intruders from getting in and removing items
of value. It is not targeted towards people going about their normal
business.
''I don't think any measures, over and above what we have, could
reasonably have been expected to prevent this attack.''
He added: ''On the evidence available at the moment, we believe that
this incident was unforeseeable and incapable of being planned against.
We will be conducting a full review in the light of all the facts as
they become available to us.''
Sister Duffy had qualified as a Registered General Nurse and also had
an Orthopaedic Nursing Certificate. She had been a sister for five years
and was at F Grade, second in line of management in the ward.
Stobhill's director of nursing Lesley Summerhill, said: ''I knew
Sister Duffy as a very charming person and a very good nurse. She was
very popular with the patients in the ward.''
The chief executive of the NHS in Scotland, Mr Geoff Scaife, told a
meeting of Highland Health Board in Inverness, that it was too early to
say what security implications arose for other hospitals following
Sister Duffy's death.
He said: ''We have had a number of concerns in the past, not only
about security of members of staff, but also in relation to the security
of babies.
''But hospitals are huge places and literally millions of people pass
through their doors every year. It is a 24-hour service with people on
shift work coming in and out in the middle of the night.
''They have to be open 24 hours a day and it is increasingly difficult
to maintain the kind of security to avoid the unpredictable one-off
event.''
