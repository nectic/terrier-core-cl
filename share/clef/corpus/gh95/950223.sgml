* Catering at Polmont Young Offenders Institution at Brightons, near
Falkirk, has come in for severe criticism by the independent prisons
inspectorate.
In his report on standards at the prison, which houses 400 under-21s,
Mr Clive Fairweather, new Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, says
his team found vegetables insipid and unappetising, and poor food
handling practices including staff scooping up items with their hands,
dirty plates, and old and battered food containers.
The Scottish Office said yesterday that improvements had taken place.

THE PGA European Challenge Tour is neither as rewarding nor as visible
as the US Senior Tour, a phenomenon which has dramatically extended the
shelf-life of many American professionals. Its significance is as an
apprenticeship to a golfing career.
This year's programme will comprise a minimum of 34 events spread
over15 countries, as far apart as Kenya and the Czech Republic. The
prize funds will be worth not less than #30,000 each, although the 1995
average will be #20,000 more than that.
The 360 players eligible to compete are sure to have taken
encouragement from recent performances by some graduates to the main
European tour who gained membership of it by finishing in the first 10
on the 1994 Challenge order of merit -- Jarmo Sandelin, Michael
Campbell, and Raymond Burns.
Sandelin, Finnish-born but a naturalised Swede, outlasted Severiano
Ballesteros to win the Canary Islands Open; Campbell, the talented New
Zealander, was equal third in the Dubai Classic and equal fourth in the
Johnnie Walker Classic; and Burns, the Irish former Walker Cup player,
was equal eighth in Dubai.
Alain de Soultrait, the Challenge tour's director, has noted that half
of the 40 places at last November's qualifying school were taken by his
members -- proof of the value not only of giving newcomers experience of
the pressures and demands of four-round competition but also of the
problems involved in travelling across Europe.
The Challenge Tour, formed after the introduction in 1985 of the
all-exempt regular tour, is steadily building an impressive record as a
proving ground. Its graduates gained 18 top-10 finishes in 1993 and 21
last year, when Paul Eales achieved his first victory and several others
earned six-figure incomes.
Altogether more than 50 players have progressed to the main tour in
the six years since the subsidiary's inauguration -- most notably
Costantino Rocca, a late developer, who in 1993 was the first Italian
for 13 years to win a tournament and was also the first from his country
to become a Ryder Cup team member.
* JIM McAlister shot a par 72 to trail American Deray Simon by one
shot after the opening round of the PGA European Seniors Tour Qualifying
School at La Manga in Spain.
The Scot, who was diagnosed a diabetic last year, is attempting to
secure a top-eight placing, and the chance to play on the 1995 Seniors
Tour.
Spain's Manuel Alvarez and England's Michael Hoyle shared third place
on 73, one ahead of Ireland's Bobby Browne, Spain's Francisco Abreu, and
American Walter Sauer. Former Ryder Cup Scot George Will shot 75.

DUMFRIESSHIRE rider Andrew Parker has taken an early lead in the
Northern Area point-to-point championship with three winners from the
first two meetings.
Before a record crowd of 3500 for the Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire
meeting at Lanark racecourse, he rode a 60-1 double on Farrier's
Favourite (5-2) and Killeshandra Lass (16-1).
Parker, who was runner-up last season to five-times champion Kevin
Anderson -- still without a winner -- has an excellent chance of
consolidating his position this weekend at the Berwickshire meeting when
he partners Royal Stream in the Antartex confined race.
Royal Stream won for him three times in 1994 and gave Parker his first
success of this season at Alnwick three weeks ago. The result is by no
means a foregone conclusion, especially with Ruber, a winner four times
last season, likely to line up, partnered by area ladies' champion
Pauline Robson.
Press For Action, a winner of the 1994 Horse and Hound Maiden Hunter
Chase at Kelso, also could pose a threat if he opts for the confined
rather than the open. He unseated David Mactaggart at Lanark when tiring
on the heavy ground, but, with better conditions expected at Friars
Haugh, could go well.
Mactaggart had a 55-1 double with Royella (4-1) in the restricted and
Irish import Orange Ragusa (10-1) in the confined.
Jimmy River missed Lanark due to corns, but Anderson expects he will
be fit to run in Saturday's Land-Rover Men's Open which is also for the
Border Hunt's Challenge Cup and a cash prize of #150.
Royal Jester, who went down to Jimmy River by eight lengths at
Corbridge a year ago, went on to win three hunter chases at Kelso and is
likely to start favourite to get his revenge on the Dumfriesshire horse.
Gunmetal Boy, the mount of Michael Dun, having won an open at Friars
Haugh on good to soft ground, also is in with a chance.
Officials of the L &amp; R were delighted with the response of both public
and owners for their first meeting at Lanark.
The ground took a hammering from the 111 runners and will need a lot
of work to get it ready for the Eglinton meeting on March 18.

SCOTT Hastings, after a period in the international wilderness,
returns to the Scotland side to play Wales in place of the injured Ian
Jardine with a point to prove.
Hastings, who will equal Jim Renwick's Scottish cap record for a
centre when he appears in Scotland colours for the fifty-second time at
Murrayfield on Saturday week, was one of the 10 casualties from the
34-10 defeat by South Africa last November.
He has returned to the full Scotland side after an impressive
performance -- significantly at inside centre, which is the berth he
will occupy at Murrayfield -- in the Scotland A side which beat Ireland
A three weeks ago.
The other injury-induced change to the side which performed so
heroically at the Parc des Princes on Saturday sees Doddie Weir, who
played the second half of the Paris match in place of the injured Damian
Cronin, retain his place at lock.
The game against Wales is a crucial component in Scotland's
rejuvenated Five Nations' campaign. Victory over the Welsh would allow
the Scots to travel to Twickenham on March 18 for a Grand Slam showdown
with England.
However, the Scottish camp is playing down the prospect of the Grand
Slam shoot-out. Scotland manager Duncan Paterson said: ''We're at the
semi-final stage. This game against Wales is going to be very hard.''
A delighted Hastings declared: ''I'm under no illusions that if Ian
had not been injured then I would still have been on the outside looking
in.
''I have a point to prove and it is up to me to do just that. Never
mind that it will be my fifty-secondcap. I will feel like the new boy,''
he said.
Jardine, until he suffered the depressed cheek fracture against France
on Saturday, had become an integral component of the new model Scotland
side. Hastings said: ''There is a fair amount of pressure on me to fit
in with how the side is now playing. I have not been at the squad
sessions and I'll have to get into the way of how this team is playing.
''The selectors have a lot of permutations in the centre and for the
first time in a long while that is an area where there is a lot of
competition for places. And that is good for Scotland,'' he said.
Weir, winning his twenty-sixth cap against Wales, will appear in the
second row for the sixteenth time. His preferred position is No.8, but
yesterday he said: ''I would play at scrum half, on the wing, in fact
anywhere to play for Scotland. I would even kick the goals. I really
enjoyed coming on in Paris and, although I'm sorry for Damian, I'm
really chuffed to be back.''
Scotland manager Duncan Paterson said that Hastings was being provided
with the opportunity to kick-start his Scotland career. ''The selection
meeting lasted approximately two hours. We spoke for about an hour about
the centre position.
''Rather than make the two changes which would have been necessary to
accommodate Tony Stanger at inside centre, it came down to a choice
between Scott Hastings and Graham Shiel. There was a lot of discussion
about the different strengths that they would bring to the squad, and
eventually it was very close, but Scott got the nod.''
Jardine is recuperating at home after surgery on his damaged right
cheek and Cronin underwent hospital tests on his damaged elbow in
Glasgow yesterday.
Cronin last night underwent an operation to assess the damage to
tendons in his right arm. Yesterday, the French-based lock returned to
Scotland to have a scan at the Glasgow's Western Infirmary.
However, while initial indications were that the injury was not a
serious as first thought, the consultant dealing with the case decided
to operate to assess the full extent of the problem.
Cronin also looks unlikely to feature in the match with England at
Twickenham on March 4, a blow to the Bourges forward. ''I've damaged a
tendon connected to one of the small muscles on the biceps,'' he said.
''Had it been really serious, I could have been out for four months
and in plaster for six weeks. I've missed the game against Wales, and
maybe now England as well.
''That's disappointing, but I now have to aim to get fit and ready for
the World Cup this summer.''
Shiel remains on the bench as he was in Paris. The thinking is that,
in relation to a replacement berth for Stanger, he provides cover for
the pivotal positions of fly-half and inside centre. Jeremy Richardson
gets the call for a place on the bench in place of the promoted Weir.
Shiel said yesterday: ''It would have been nice to have got a run. The
difficult part is getting on to show what you can do. Maybe I'll get a
chance later in the season.''
Stanger, trying to rebuild his Scotland career at centre instead of on
the wing, said: ''I'm disappointed but I've been asked to go along to
the session at Murrayfield on Sunday to help out. If they had chosen me
at outside centre then they would have had to make two changes so I an
understand the selectors' reasoning. I just keep trying.''
Meanwhile, Wales have gambled on a young and untested debutant for the
crucial position of tight-head prop. Llanelli's Spencer John will become
Wales's youngest front row forward since David Young made his debut in
the 1987 World Cup quarter-final against England in the March 4 clash.
He takes over from the suspended John Davies, who is currently
appealing against a 60-day ban for alleged use of the boot at a ruck in
last weekend's 23-9 defeat by England at Cardiff.
John, a product of Neath College who has earned caps at Wales Schools,
Under-18, Under-19 and Under-21 level, forced his way into the Llanelli
first-team this season and played against the Springboks on October 29
-- just 10 days after his 21st birthday.
The teams:
Scotland -- A G Hastings (Watsonians), capt.; C A Joiner (Melrose), G
P J Townsend (Gala), S Hastings (Watsonians), K M Logan (Stirling
County); C M Chalmers, B W Redpath (both Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath),

HUTCHESONS' Grammar School first XV achieved their eighteenth victory
in 20 games this season last Saturday with a 24-12 win over St Gerard's
at Bray, in the first of two tour matches in Ireland for the 25-strong
party. Winger Adam Gordon claimed two of the Hutchesons' tries, as did
the Scottish Schools centre, Alan Bulloch.
The later also played and contributed to the scoring in the second
tour match, against Presentation College. The tourists, fielding a
number of second and third XV players, could not match the stronger
Irish side, who went on to win 31-19.
Hutchesons' coach, Magnus Brown, the former Watsonian back-row player,
described the tour as a great success. ''The team spirit was
fantastic,'' said Brown, whose side have still to play Robert Gordon's
College, Earlston High School, Glasgow High School, and Dundee High
School before their season ends.
Having lost two games this season, Hutchesons' will not be able to
match the record of last year's side, who won 17 out of 18 games, but
even so the current first XV's achievement ranks among the top four
Scottish schools this season.
That record by Hutchesons' has to be seen against a backcloth of
constant improvement in schools rugby. ''The standard of first XV rugby
is very high this season; higher, in fact, than for a number of years.
And that is reflected in the performances of the Scottish Schools team
this season. And it is not only in the independent sector,'' says Brown.
''State schools are coming back into the game and there is probably no
better example than Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh, which has
benefited from the input of the former Scotland B player, George
Watson.''
In fact, Lothian Region, in a joint initiative with the Scottish Rugby
Union, has set up a programme to give pupils in the state sector better
opportunities to play rugby. The project is being run by Scotland's
assistant coach, Richie Dixon, who is on a 23-month secondment from his
teaching post at Currie High School.
Essentially, the programme seeks to identify and cultivate talent and
thereafter to form development squads so that where schools cannot
support independently viable teams, this can be achieved by pooling
resources.
Last Friday in Paris the scheme had its first practical examination
when an under-16 team containing one representative from each of
Lothian's state schools played against the Lycee Lakanal, described by
David Allan, the team manager, as ''a school of excellence.''
The match, arranged as part of the celebrations to mark the 700th
anniversary of the Auld Alliance and played at the Stade de la Croix de
Berny, resulted in a 36-10 win for the French boys. ''The Lothians boys
were well down at half-time but showed great character by scoring more
points than the French in the second half,'' commented David Allan, who
summed up the visit as ''a positive experience for the Lothian boys.''

ENGLAND'S rugby manager Jack Rowell wasted little time in asking the
team that has already beaten Ireland, France, and Wales to complete the
Grand Slam against Scotland at Twickenham on March 18.
Rowell named unchanged sides for England's second and third matches
''on the nod'' and the formality of endorsing the XV that were
victorious in Cardiff was made equally briskly yesterday -- almost two
weeks ahead of schedule.
One reason for the early announcement was that England have added an
unplanned squad session at their new training ground at Marlow next
Wednesday -- the venue for a series of sessions in the autumn that
England rate as one reason for their dominance of the Five Nations
competition.
Captain Will Carling said: ''We became much more like a club side
through those Marlow workouts and when Jack Rowell suggested we go back
there at the start of our preparation for Twickenham, I readily agreed.
There is plenty of work still to be done, despite our three wins, and we
also felt that to leave a three-week gap before we linked up again would
take some of the sharpness away.''
France (in 1977), Scotland (1990) and England (1991) were all
unchanged winners of the Grand Slam. Team for March 18:
M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling (Harlequins,
capt), J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R Andrew (Wasps),
K P P Bracken (Bristol); J Leonard (Harlequins), B C Moore (Harlequins),
V E Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield (Northampton), T
A K Rodber (Northampton), D Richards (Leicester), B B Clarke (Bath).
Replacements: J E B Callard (Bath), P R de Glanville (Bath), C D
Morris (Orrell), G C Rowntree (Leicester), R G R Dawe (Bath), S O Ojomoh

RANGERS goalkeeper Andy Goram will go through an operation on Monday
for a calf muscle injury and has been told he will not play again this
season.
Goram was x-rayed in London yesterday and the result was received at
Ibrox last night. He was one of two Ibrox men who had gone south for
specialist opinions.
The other, striker Mark Hateley, was given slightly better news when
he was told that no operation was required on his groin injury.
However, Hateley was told to rest for six weeks and that comes close
enough to the season's end to make little difference to the effect on
Rangers.
Said manager Walter Smith: ''Obviously, it is a blow to lose players
of their quality for lengthy spells at an important stage of the season.
But we have had to get on without key players for most of the year.
There is nothing we can do but get on with things.''
Goram has been a major loss to the Ibrox club who crashed out of the
Scottish Cup against Hearts on Monday after errors from Ally Maxwell.
His operation is also a blow to Scotland coach Craig Brown, who
admitted yesterday how serious the international goalkeeping situation
had suddenly become.
Goram was injured playing for Scotland against Greece in Athens on
December 18 then was carried off in his comeback game against Partick
Thistle on January 7. Now, the operation he, and the club, had feared
has been ordered.
Brown may be forced to look towards a partial Dad's Army for the match
in Moscow next month in the European Championship match against Russia
with Manchester United's 31-year-old striker Brian McClair and Hibs'
36-year-old goalkeeper Jim Leighton stepping into the breach.
Brown will go south, before he names his squad, to look at McClair in
action.
He said: ''I have seen a lot of Brian on television recently and I've
been impressed. I have spoken to Alex Ferguson about him and I know that
what he tells me will be the truth. He will be absolutely up front and
forthright.
''There was a time when Brian -- or rather Ferguson -- spoke to Andy
Roxburgh about his situation with the Scotland team. It was felt, then,
that he should not be chosen for a squad at that stage of his career if
he was not to be involved either in the team or on the bench.
''I can understand that but, in this case, if I decide to include him,
he will be handed a special role. This is a game where you need workers,
players who will fight for you and, if they are forwards, check back to
help the team defend.
''Brian does that. In fact, he has suffered in the past because we
have used him in difficult away games when he has had that kind of job
to do.
''He always has done it well and it would be that type of game we
would ask him to play in Russia, if we take him. I know he can do it but
I want to get down to see him and then make up my mind.''
As for the other veteran, Leighton, Brown wants to see him wrapped in
cotton wool for the next month as he worries over the goalkeeping crisis
the Scottish side faces.
He mused: ''It's only a few months since I was looking at a trio of
keepers who were possibly the best available in Europe. We had Andy
Goram, Bryan Gunn, and Jim Leighton. Now, we are left with Jim.
''We don't know when Andy will be back and Bryan has a broken ankle
and is also ruled out.
''But we have Jim and know how professional, determined, and reliable
he is.
''After that there is a gap. Nicky Walker played the other night but
was injured, too. There is no-one in England and we have a few foreign
keepers in the premier division now which limits the choice again.
''We just have to hope and pray that nothing happens to Jim between
now and the end of next month.''
In the meantime, Darren Jackson will be given the call and could be
teamed with Duncan Ferguson in attack for Scotland.
There will be no massive changes, however, because Brown insists that
the defeat in Greece was no disaster.
''We will make adjustments to the squad, but there is no need to make
wholesale changes,'' he said.
''It will be a different game from the one in Athens and we will look
for different qualities from the players.
''We will make what we hope will be improvements and will worry over
Leighton's fitness until that game is over.''

RECORD Aberdeen buy Billy Dodds is hoping his Scotland call-up will
cure his relegation jinx.
The striker has taken the drop with his two previous clubs, Dundee and
St Johnstone, and is desperate to avoid a hat trick of heartbreaks.
Delighted at taking the first step on the international ladder as a
sub in the 3-0 win over Northern Ireland in the B game at Easter Road,
Dodds said yesterday: ''I have had to endure a lot of flak since I came
to Pittodrie because of what has happened in the past.
''Some of that stick about events at Dundee and St Johnstone was fun,
but a lot of it has been downright nasty.
''Last week's defeat by Stenhousemuir was the lowest point of my
career, but relegation with Aberdeen would be much worse.
''Playing for Scotland has eased the pain a little but the memory of
that loss will never leave me.
''We have 11 games left to avoid the drop and I will be up for every
one of them.''
* ABERDEEN'S Paul Kane is selling the jerseys -- but only to help a
charity for deprived children.
Despite the club's crisis, the players have still time to help the
under-privileged.
Kane, who once played for Oldham, used his contacts in England to land
a quartet of the most sought-after strips to help the cause.
''I was able to get autographed jerseys from Alan Shearer, of
Blackburn Rovers, and Ryan Giggs, Andy Cole, and Eric Cantona, of
Manchester United,'' he said.
''Hopefully, the auction of their strips at a charity bash this Sunday
will help us well down the road to achieving our initial target of
#120,000 for kids in need.''
Scottish stars past and present will be in Aberdeen for the dinner,
which will be hosted by former Pittodrie winger Jimmy Wilson.
* PARTICK goalkeeper Nicky Walker is struggling to befit for
Saturday's Scottish premier division relegation battle with Dundee
United.
Walker injured his calf after 30 minutes while playing for Scotland B
against Northern Ireland B at Easter Road last night.
Partick manager John Lambie said: ''At the moment Nicky is rated
doubtful for Saturday. It's a blow for us. He is the form keeper right
now.''
If 32-year-old Walker fails to make it, Lambie will need to use deputy
Mark Cairns at Tannadice.

DEFENDING champion Jason Barnett heads the 44-strong men's entry for
the Marshalls Scottish indoor championships to be held at the Gannochy
Centre in Stirling this weekend.
The Aberdonian, ranked No.5 in Scotland, has been given top seeding
ahead of triple national champion Ken Wood and Scottish No.4 Malcolm
Watt.
Euan McGinn makes his first competitive appearance north of the Border
since joining Barnett on the SLTA's Stirling-based full-time squad six
months ago.
Provided he survives a quarter of the draw which includes fifth seed
Jonathan Pankhurst, McGinn is expected to take on second seed Wood in
Sunday's semi-final while Barnett should meet Watt.
St Andrews left-hander Eilidh Smith assumes the mantle of top seed in
the women's singles following the withdrawal of the favourite, Julia
Taylor,and second seed Nicola Burns.
* ROSS Matheson made a promising start to the third leg of the UK
Satellite Circuit in Eastbourne when he beat Australian qualifier Ashley
Neumann 6-3, 7-5 in yesterday's first round.
Michele Mair and her Irish partner, Karen Nugent, were beaten 6-3,6-2
by Czechs Sandra Kleinova and Ludmila Varmuzova in yesterday's first
round of the women's doubles at the Challenger event in Newcastle.

Golac's men play their way out of trouble but Jefferies is made to pay
his way
THERE has been nothing dramatic about Dundee United's form since the
turn of the year, certainly nothing as exciting as their manager's
observations, but the fact is that they have lost only one match in the
nine they have played in 1995.
They remain too close to the demotion zone of the premier division to
accept pats on the back yet and their performance against Falkirk on
Tuesday was mediocre by their standards, but when they compare recent
efforts with their record in the last nine matches of 1994 they can
reasonably claim to have sorted out some of their problems.
In that spell United won only twice and ended up at the tail end of
the league, with mutterings of relegation being heard in the vicinity of
Tannadice.
None of those murmurings came from manager Ivan Golac who, typically,
was not even prepared to allow the word ''relegation' to be used in his
presence, but there were more pragmatic folk around who feared the
worst.
The talk of the manager's departure, the queue of players either
asking for transfers or protesting about contracts, and the general loss
of big-team credibility seemed to be undermining the club's prospects
for the rest of the season.
However, all had not yet been lost, as Golac, irrepressible as ever,
shrugged off the gossip, put behind him the transfer of two players,
Alex Cleland and Gary Bollan, to Rangers, and began to talk about
celebrating the successful defence of the Tennents Scottish Cup in May.
Since then his side have made their way into the quarter-finals and,
by dint of their win over Falkirk, have cleared a path out of the
league's nether regions.
''I kept saying to people that only Rangers are safe. Everybody else
is playing for everything else in the league,'' said Golac yesterday.
''We are now ready to go for a Europe place, like I said we would all
along.''
The Croatian with the outrageous style added: ''Second place is what
we are shooting for,'' but then added, with that throaty laugh that
characterises pearls of wisdom that please him, ''but the league itself
is not over, you know.''
That may be literally true but he does make a more valid point about
his side's claims for second place being still feasible.
If United beat Partick Thistle at Tannadice on Saturday and, at the
same time, Celtic lose to Hearts at Tynecastle, the Tayside lot would be
only a point behind the Parkhead team and very much back in the race.
One of the main contributors to the Tannadice revival, predictably, is
Maurice Malpas, the captain who scored the winning goal against Falkirk.
''He is playing like a tiger,'' said Golac. ''He was the best man on
the park on Tuesday.''
One United fan, who wrote to Golac last week complaining that Malpas
is the ''worst scorer at the club'' will be receiving a gleeful reply,
pointing out that the captain has scored in the past two games. One more
man who has discovered Ivan's Law.
Maurice would be one man the manager would single out in his 18-month
spell as United's leader. In fact, Golac yesterday listed a quartet of
players who have played consistently well for him in his tenure at
Tannadice, all of them Scottish.
''Maurice has been amazingly consistent but, you know, Brian Welsh has
been the most consistent player here. His performances have been kept at
a high standard.
''Jim McInally has had a lot of problems with injury but when he has
been fit he has played really well, and David Bowman always gives you
everything.''
Tuesday's win, albeit unimpressive, was United's third in a row, the
first time that had been achieved this season.
''Now, I look forward to the fourth on Saturday,'' said the manager.
He might be right again.

Mogadishu, Wednesday
BRITISH security officer Bill Lindsay of the UN development programme
was injured in the hand when gunmen ambushed United Nations staff in the
Somali capital Mogadishu today.
One Somali guard was killed and two Somali guards were seriously
wounded in the ambush, UN officials said.
Another Somali working for the UN refugee agency was kidnapped but
later freed unharmed.
Officials said gunmen aboard a ''technical'' -- a battlewagon mounted
with a heavy weapon -- and two other vehicles intercepted the UN staff
in a convoy near the airport.
Mr Lindsay was taken to the Pakistani hospital at the airport and was
expected to be evacuated later today to Nairobi. The two guards were
admitted to Mogadishu's Digfer hospital.
The convoy was taking the UN staff to work at the UN development
programme compound near the entrance to the airport, to which all UN
troops have pulled back before completing their withdrawal from Somalia.
The #2000m mission is scheduled to close down by March 6 after nearly
three years of struggle that has resulted in the deaths of more than 130
servicemen and untold numbers of Somalis.
The United Nations is withdrawing from Somalia with considerable
anguish, its only peace-keeping venture to end without achieving
military or political goals.
A final rearguard of Pakistani UN soldiers is due within days to be
plucked from the beaches of Somalia's anarchic capital in the US-led
operation ''United Shield'' to safeguard the withdrawal.--Reuter.

Cherbourg, Wednesday
GREENPEACE said today that it would sue British, French, and Japanese
companies for allegedly endangering the public by transporting highly
radioactive waste through the French port city of Cherbourg.
The British ship Pacific Pintail is to embark tomorrow for Japan
loaded with the deadly cargo of 14 tons of residue from French
reprocessing of spent Japanese nuclear fuel.
The companies say the shipment, the first of its kind, complies with
international norms. Environmentalists contend that the vessel and
container are not immune to collision or fire.
Some 20 nations along potential shipping routes have protested or
banned the vessel from their waters. Fiji joined their number today.
''Though non-governmental organisations and governments around the
world have asked for environmental impact assessments, information on
liability, route planning, and safety issues, we remain in a state of
almost complete secrecy,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Damon Moglen.
The shipment is ''the tip of the iceberg of what's going to happen'',
said Jean-Luc Thierry of Greenpeace, referring to plans to ship hundreds
of tons of the waste for the next 15 years.
The nuclear companies, citing security concerns, have declined to say
which route the ship will take through the Caribbean, around South
America, or around the southern tip of Africa.
The cargo, comprising 28 vitrified glass blocks of the waste loaded in
a huge consignment totalling 112 tons, was driven by lorry to Cherbourg
before dawn yesterday from the La Hague reprocessing plant 30 miles
north-west of the port.
Hundreds of police guarded the shipment, dragging away a handful of
protesters trying to block it.
Thierry said Greenpeace would file lawsuits within the next few days
against state-owned French nuclear processing company Cogema, British
Nuclear Fuels Ltd, and its subsidiary Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd, as
well as a consortium of Japanese power companies.
Greenpeace would charge the companies with endangering the public by
transporting the cargo through Cherbourg, said Thierry, noting that one
of the lorries broke down, stopping the convoy for 45
minutes.--AP/Reuter.

Algiers, Wednesday
SECURITY forces in Algeria crushed a prison revolt by Islamic
militants today, killing at least 95 inmates after four guards were
taken hostage and had their throats slit.
Officials said inmates armed with home-made knives and other weapons
took seven guards hostage yesterday, then began organising an escape of
up to 1000 jailed Islamic militants and other prisoners.
Four of the guards were murdered and more than a dozen other prison
employees and security forces members were injured during the rebellion,
said Justice Minister Mohamed Teguia.
Security officials said that at least 95 inmates were killed by the
security forces, including two jailed leaders of the Armed Islamic
Group, the most hard-line of the guerrilla organisations fighting to
topple the government.
Also killed, the officials said, was Lembarek Boumaarafi, charged with
the 1992 assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf.
Unofficial news reports said the revolt involved about 40 or 50 of the
hundreds of Islamic extremists at the prison.
The Justice Ministry said all the mutineers had been jailed for
involvement in the three-year insurgency waged by Muslim militants
against the army-backed government. An estimated 30,000 people have been
killed in the conflict.
The prison is near the Defence Ministry and the headquarters of the
gendarmes, Algeria's paramilitary police force.
It was the second serious prison mutiny during the insurgency. Several
inmates who refused to join a rebellion at Algiers' Berrouaghia prison
in November were killed.
Last March Islamic guerrillas raided the Tazult-Lambese prison in
southern Algeria and freed hundreds of their detained colleagues.
Among the militants held at Serkadji are several leaders of the banned
Islamic Salvation Front, the fundamentalist party that was on the verge
of winning control of Parliament when the military cancelled
second-round elections in January 1992.
It led to a declaration of a state of emergency and a massive
crackdown on fundamentalists and prompted militants to respond with a
campaign of sabotage, bombings, and assassinations that have intensified
in recent weeks.--AP.

POLICE in Bangkok yesterday joined the hunt for a Briton wanted in
connection with the murder of his girlfriend in Tenerife.
Police in the Canaries holiday island confirmed that Nicholas Barratt,
35, from Birkenhead, had used her credit cards to obtain money in the
Thai capital.
Two days ago the body of Madeleine Olislager, 31, from Belgium, was
found in the boot of her Alfa Romeo car at the island's airport. She had
been repeatedly stabbed.
The car had been left at the airport about eight days earlier.
A police spokesman in Tenerife said: ''Mr Barratt has been using this
murdered women's credit cards in Bangkok since her death. We believe he
is still in Thailand and Interpol has been informed.
''The couple lived together and it is obvious that Mr Barratt knew her
credit card code numbers.''
Mr Barratt, a divorced father of two, arrived in the Canary Islands a
few months ago after living for a time in the Manchester area.
Mr Barrat was said by police in Tenerife to be a drifter who had
earned a living as a timeshare salesman.

Grozny, Wednesday
RUSSIAN forces shelled rebel fighters and villages near the Chechen
capital Grozny today and said they had foiled a push to break through
their lines into the shattered city.
Chechens in Goity, just south of Grozny, said they had come under fire
overnight for the first time. Shelling of Alkhanyurt, west of the
capital, was also clearly audible.
Itar-Tass news agency said the rebels simultaneously attacked Russian
positions from the north and south of Grozny during the night but were
repulsed with heavy artillery fire.
Top Russian commanders ruled out talks with the rebels yesterday.
Tass, however, quoted sources close to the Mozdok military command today
as saying that negotiations were still possible if the Chechens met a
series of conditions.
The conditions, most of which were set out at the time of the Russian
intervention and have been rejected by the Chechens, included surrender
of heavy weapons, demilitarisation of Grozny, and release of all Russian
prisoners.
The outside world reacted with indifference to the resumption of
Russian shelling, after a brief ceasefire last week. It had begun just
before President Boris Yeltsin's annual address to the nation and ended
almost immediately afterwards.
Russia moved troops into the rebel southern region on December 11 to
crush its three-year independence bid. Since then, Russian human rights
workers under commissioner Sergei Kovalyov say 24,350 civilians from
Grozny have been killed in a devastating Russian bombardment of
residential districts.
Western governments, initially cautious about what various countries
dubbed Russian overkill, have now by and large chosen to continue
dealing with Yeltsin as Russia's best hope for a democratic future.
Despite the costly war, which sent Russian inflation soaring to a
monthly 17.8% last month, Moscow is close to clinching a long-awaited
$6.25 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, Russian Deputy
Finance Minister Sergei Aleksashenko said today.
Six IMF officials are due in Moscow tomorrow for talks expected to
last a week. IMF chief Michel Camdessus will arrive by March 8 to sign
the deal, Aleksashenko said.--Reuter.

Washington, Wednesday
REVOLUTIONARY upheaval such as Russia's Chechnya rebellion is far from
over in the lands of the former Soviet Union and threatens the security
of vast nuclear arsenals, a senior US official said today.
Moves in Congress to end US military aid to help reduce and protect
thousands of warheads and tons of chemical arms left from the Cold War
were attacked by Assistant Defence Secretary Ashton Carter.
''If there is one lesson that I draw from Chechnya, it is that
revolutionary change in the former Soviet Union is far from over,'' he
said.
Carter said he was worried about nuclear weapons being fired ''by
accident or by an unauthorised terrorist party of some kind'', rather
than in anger by young democracies such as Ukraine.
''For years and years and years there is going to be economic and
political change of a very rapid sort throughout the former Soviet Union
. . . And all the while, those 30,000 nuclear weapons and hundreds of
tons of fissile materials and tens of thousands of tons of chemical
weapons are still there amidst all that,'' he said.
Republicans, who won a sweeping victory in elections last year, oppose
using US military funds for what they see as ''non-defence'' projects,
saying the money could be better spent on US military training and
readiness.--Reuter.

A WARNING to farmers not to get carried away in the present euphoria
over high profit levels came yesterday from the Royal Bank of Scotland's
new head of agricultural services, Jimmy McLean.
''We have to be a little bit cautious because so much of the
improvement has come about from the de-valuation of the green pound,''
he said. ''As we approach the year 2000 there will be further pressures
from Gatt mark two and the whole question of how we integrate the former
Eastern Bloc countries into the European Union.
''These kinds of things are going to impinge on where we are going in
the next five years plus. However, I am very optimistic for the next two
to three years.''
Beyond that period, he suggested, things would begin to get more
''realistic''.
''If we get inflation at 2% to 3% a year, and we do not get any
increased value in prices, that will nibble away at a fair chunk of the
value in prices.''
Mr McLean said his message to farmers would be to use the present good
times to sort out existing problems and to re-invest wisely. ''Look
critically at how you are spending money and make sure you are spending
it on the right things.''
Archie Blyth, who is retiring as the bank's agricultural adviser, said
there was now a lot of competition on the banking scene for farmers'
business. ''Many more farming businesses are now re-bankable,'' he said.
''There are some who would have found it difficult to move banks in the
past even if they had wanted to.''
The indications were that in Scotland farmers' borrowings were on the
increase -- a sign of re-investment which was also backed up by higher
sales of tractors, combines and other equipment, he said.

* FURTHER expansion of the European Union could make or break the
Common Agricultural Policy, speakers at a European Outlook conference in
London claimed yesterday, writes VICTOR ROBERTSON.
Lord Howe, junior Agriculture Minister, put the cost of integration
with the six former Soviet Union states at about 15 billion Ecu, or
#11bn, a year. He questioned whether current member states would be
willing to pay such sums to support Central and Eastern European
agriculture. If they were not prepared to meet that cost, there would
have to be a reform of the Cap because a two-tier policy was out of the
question.
Former EU farm commissioner Rene Steichen said he feared some people
were trying to undermine the principles of the Cap. It was essential for
farmers in both European sectors that its principles and mechanisms
should be retained, but that did not rule out the need for some
adjustments.

AN Ayrshire-based egg producer has become the first in Scotland to win
accreditation under the RSPCA's Freedom Food scheme. Scotlay Farm Eggs
of Riverside Farm near Alloway specialises in free-range eggs, which
command a premium price.
Former Scottish rugby internationalist Quintin Dunlop heads the
Scotlay operation which, in the wake of the Edwina Currie salmonella
scare, had to undergo a virtual re-launch as its traditional market
evaporated.
Aware of growing concerns about animal welfare, the company has
concentrated its efforts on a free-range system which, to retain the
RSPCA recognition, has to guarantee the hens freedom from fear,
distress, pain, injury and disease. They must be kept well fed and
watered, comfortable and given freedom to behave normally.
Scotlay used to be a supplier to Homestead Eggs. It was a simple
business, Mr Dunlop recalled. He produced the eggs and a lorry made
regular calls to collect them. The rest was up to Homestead, which was a
major distributor.
After the Edwina Currie scare Homestead became part of a distribution
set-up based in Fife, leaving Scotlay, on the other side of the country,
feeling somewhat vulnerable.
It was at this point that Mr Dunlop decided he to go after his own
local market. Today he has 6000 birds in production with their eggs
destined for a wide variety of local outlets including corner shops,
butchers, guest houses, nursing homes and hotels. The prestigious
Turnberry Hotel is also among his customers.
One of the main outlets for Scotlay is a home delivery service which
brings day-old free-range eggs straight to the doorstep through a
network of 50 teenage agents covering households in Ayr, Prestwick and
Troon. That service -- which comes at a discount compared to supermarket
prices -- is about to be extended to Kilmarnock and East Kilbride.
The best of these young agents earned #1000 last year including
bonuses and tips. The whole operation is carefully planned with a
leaflet drop, followed up by a house call. Training evenings are held in
a local hotel so that the agents are groomed for their task before they
hit the streets.
''We have worked very hard to get to this position,'' said Mr Dunlop.
''It has been very exciting. We knew there was a market out there, the
question was how to get to it.''
With the help of an assistant, Tracy Hardy, who graduated last year
from Glasgow's Caledonian University in consumer and management studies,
he has adopted a professional approach to marketing. The polystyrene
packs come in a colourful sleeve featuring the cross of St Andrew. At
the recent Kyle and Carrick trade fair the Scotlay stand, which they
devised themselves, was judged to be the best on show.

Chicago, Wednesday
HE FLOATED further than any other balloon pilot, enduring temperatures
so cold that he had to hold his drinking water next to his body to thaw
it.
When he finally landed in Canada last night after a gruelling four-day
flight that covered at least 5400 miles, stockbroker Steve Fossett had
become the first person to fly a balloon solo across the Pacific Ocean.
Cold and tired, Fossett celebrated as softly as his 150ft helium
balloon touched down on a farmer's muddy field in Saskatchewan. He took
off from Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday.
In addition to being the first person to make the trip solo, Fossett
and his crew say he broke the distance record, cited in the Guinness
Book of Records as 5208.68 miles. Fossett estimated that he travelled
5429 miles. His flight director Alan Noble, in Bristol, claimed he had
covered at least 5430 miles.
''He's very laid back about it,'' said Alan Noble. ''When he crossed
the coast, he said, 'I've flown the Pacific. I'm over Canada.' No
'Whoopee!' or anything like that.''
He had planned to land in California, but the balloon -- decorated
with the words ''Seoul to San Francisco'' -- was at the mercy of the
winds.
''I'm very satisfied with it,'' said Fossett, 50, from Chicago. ''This
was the objective that I set out to do a year ago, and it really was
quite satisfying to reach that objective.''
The last solo attempt to cross the world's largest ocean ended in
disaster: Japanese balloonist Fumio Niwa was killed when he was forced
to ditch his craft in the sea in 1991.
Fossett's journey began disastrously, too. As soon as he left Korea,
the two propane heaters in his cramped gondola failed. He pressed on,
enduring temperatures down to -20C (-4F) with only a sleeping bag to
keep him warm.

SCOTLAND'S Graeme Obree, who was sacked last month by Robert Millar's
French club, Le Groupement, has fixed up a deal with a German team.
Obree, who set the racing world alight with his achievements on his
now famous bike, has come to an understanding with Die Continentale of
Dortmund, whose top rider is the Dane, Jens Veggerby.
The talented track man with the flair for the unusual, said: ''I was
invited over to Germany last week by manager Ernst Clausmeyer. He had
seen me ride at the Dortmund six-day event last year, and was
impressed.''
Graeme's plan is to gradually build up his fitness. ''I am back in
training and have a more positive approach than I had in December when I
was ill. I will work out my own training schedule with no interference
from the team and I could be riding a track meeting at Herne Hill,
London at Easter.
''My long term aim is the world championships in October. I still hold
the world pursuit record, although I was disqualified last year because
of my riding position.''
Obree has been at war with the world ruling body, UCI, since last May
when they outlawed his riding position with his body over the bars.
''I will be riding a different position and using tri-bars,'' he went
on. This may prove to be more efficient than the old Obree method.''
His manager, Frank Quinn, speaking from Dublin, is more cautious about
the comeback. ''He is much more positive and we will see how he goes in
the next few months. But he has got his spirit back again.''
Obree believed the French outfit, Le Groupement, a new club on the
racing scene, had cooled off on him after Miguel Indurain and Tony
Rominger had destroyed Obree's April record of 52.713 kilometres in the
one hour event.
Indurain improved this by 327 metres in September, then the Swiss
Rominger set 53.832 in October and 55.291 in December.

Paris, Wednesday
FRANCE has accused four American diplomats and a fifth US citizen of
political, military, and economic spying and asked them to leave the
country.
The White House later said the claims were unwarranted, but declined
to state what action Washington might take.
After the spying allegations were first reported by the newspaper Le
Monde, US Ambassador Pamela Harriman went to the offices of Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur.
Mrs Harriman declined to comment after her 30-minute meeting but
Balladur's office said the affair ''should be handled with the greatest
possible discretion'' by the two nations' spy agencies.
The Ministries said the request had been made confidentially and was
not meant to be made public.
French media described the affair as the worst diplomatic rift between
the two allies since a Paris newspaper published the names of purported
CIA agents in France in 1976.
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua informed President Francois
Mitterrand four days ago that the five Americans worked for the CIA and
were guilty of ''acts of interference'', including attempts to recruit
the aides of Cabinet Ministers.
Pasqua said the five, allegedly including the CIA station chief for
France, were uncovered in a ''long, detailed investigation'' by the
Direction for Territorial Surveillance (DST), France's
counter-intelligence service.
''The French Government stresses that this matter should not put into
question the solid and long-standing friendship between France and the
United States,'' the French statement said.
Balladur said: ''These things happen all the time on one side of the
Atlantic or the other.''
He declined to comment explicitly on the report but added: ''The
French people are friends of the American people, and the French
Government is the friend of the American Government.''
French officials, requesting anonymity, said France stopped short of
ordering the five to be expelled and had asked the United States to
withdraw them rapidly. They said the five, over a two- to three-year
period, had been gathering information of hi-tech military products and
other economic activities.
Officials said two other US embassy employees had been recalled
quietly by Washington some time ago because of French spying
allegations.
In Washington, the White House the allegations were unwarranted.
''The handling of this matter in France is inconsistent with the
approach that allies have taken to resolve sensitive matters in the
past. There is no reason for expelling any Americans, nor is the French
Government calling for it. We are reviewing the implications of this
incident.''
Le Monde quoted an internal DST report as saying that the five
Americans concentrated their ''clandestine research'' on economic and
commercial activities, particularly the audio-visual and
telecommunications sectors.
Quoting unidentified French officials it said there were 80 US agents,
30 of them clandestine, in France. The US had now supplanted the former
Soviet Union as the main source of spying on France.
In the late 1980s, US intelligence agencies accused French agents of
spying on American banks and computer firms, searching US businessmen's
rubbish and hotel rooms, and recruiting Air France employees to provide
information about Americans.
Le Monde's disclosure comes at a time when Balladur, the front-runner
in the presidential race, and Pasqua, perhaps his most powerful Cabinet
Minister, are defending themselves against allegations that they
approved an illegal, politically motivated wire-tapping operation.
Le Monde's story was accompanied by a cartoon suggesting that Pasqua
hoped the spy case would divert attention from the wire-tapping
scandal.--AP/Reuter.

THE scale of the financial disaster which has overtaken Scottish
athletics was confirmed yesterday when their accounts were distributed
in advance of the annual meeting, to be held a fortnight on Saturday.
They reveal losses of #51,762 in the past year, which, following a
deficit in the previous 12 months of #42,040, explains why a radical
overhaul of the sport is being undertaken. A management review, by
experts appointed by the Scottish Sports Council (SSC) is, under the
circumstances, likely to draw uncomfortable conclusions and propose
painful remedies.
Funds totalling #85,000 at the start of the financial year were down
to #33,000 by the end. Without action, at that rate of haemorrhage,
bankruptcy by November of this year was inevitable.
''That action has now been taken,'' confirmed Jim Scott, the Scottish
Athletic Federation president, who became interim treasurer last
September when illness overtook the previous incumbent, John Innes.
''We have simply been living beyond our means, putting on events
without the finance to support it,'' added Scott, who is standing
unopposed for the unenviable post of treasurer.
New accounting and budgeting procedures are already in place, but
Scott confirmed: ''The biggest drain on resources was track and field.
They have not tried hard enough in the past to obtain
meeting-sponsorship, though they are working hard now.
''It is no use looking for grandiose global packages. We have to find
small sponsorships in the absence of one source -- packages which,
brought together, will make an enormous difference.''
Track athletics is a victim of its own success. Since the opening of
the Kelvin Hall, and the advent of the great indoors, competition has
boomed. ''Costs, and pressure on volunteers, have doubled,'' said track
and field convener George Duncan. ''We must be much more cost-conscious.
Our budget last year was #67,000 -- now it is #24,000.''
Economies will mean fewer competitions for leading athletes (40
instead of 90 at the inter-county championships, for example). Under-20
and under-23 matches in Exeter and Bristol have been axed, though Wales
has rescued the senior match against Turkey, Israel, and Northern
Ireland.
''Representative athletes will have to pay the first #10 of assembly
costs in future,'' revealed Duncan. ''We may have to raise championship
entry fees, and will have to consider the consequences of selecting
Anglos. The assembly costs of a few from all over England often are as
great as bringing the bulk of the team from Scotland.
''If losses are going to be too great, some championships next season
may have to go.''
These agonising dilemmas illustrate the pressures on volunteers like
Duncan. A successful businessman, he spends four hours of his working
day, 10 months of the year, on SAF business. He employs a daughter in
the company, paying her to work 10 hours each week on SAF typing.
''Often we have more athletic mail than for the grain company,'' he
says.
Duncan spends a further 10 hours weekly in committee, and like most
officials, a further 16-20 hours each weekend ensuring the smoooth
running of competitions. Added to that workload, he now faces becoming a
marketing executive.
The appointment of a full-time marketing/sponsorship professional is a
priority, allied to signing athletes on contracts -- officials are
moving towards that with leading British competitors.
Appearances by Liz McColgan, Yvonne Murray, and Tom McKean in Scottish
vests outside Commonwealth Games are rare. Injury notwithstanding, their
national championship attendance record in recent years has also been
thin. Their competitive needs are now above this level, but without
their presence at such events, sponsorship and TV coverage is unlikely.
''We have been asked by the SSC to move towards contracts for
athletes,'' confirmed SAF secretay Bob Greenoak yesterday. ''We would
provide a range of support services: financial, medical, sports science.
In return we'll expect them to appear in championships and
internationals, and to do promotional work.''
The SSC has been asked for #30,000 in elite support. But that money,
and the first contracts, will be with youngsters like the eight under-20
AAA medal-winning Scots who compete for Britain against Germany in
Erfurt this weekend, rather than well-healed celebrity seniors.
* FOR the second time in a fortnight, an influential UK sports post
has been won by a Scot. Derek Casey, former director of operations at
the Scottish Sports Council, is to take over as chief executive of the
Sports Council, and will assume the same responsibilities for the
English Sports Council when it comes into being.
His appointment follows that of another former Scottish Sports Council
member, Aberdeenshire's Mike Barron, who has just been named director of
the English Lottery Sports Fund, controlling the destiny of #2000m by
the Millennium.
Casey, 45, educated at St Aloysius' College and Glasgow University,
moved from Scotland to the Sports Council six years ago as director of
national services, and has been acting director-general since 1993. His
main duties have been developing facilities, participation, and
excellence, and overseeing anti-doping initiatives.
He is co-chairman of the international working group on anti-doping in
sport, dealing with the International Olympic Committee, international
sports federations, and other anti-doping agencies.
His new role is to oversee Sports Council reorganisation, which
involves setting up a separate UK body. It is crucially advantageous to
interests north of the Border that someone with a Scottish perspective
should have such a powerful role in shaping the future direction of UK
sport.
* LINFORD Christie, who broke the world indoor 200 metres record in
France last Sunday, has withdrawn from that distance at the KP
Invitation meeting in Birmingham on Saturday, after having been treated
for a back problem. He will, however, run the 60m, leaving John Regis
and world outdoor champion Frankie Fredericks, whom he beat in Lievin,
to dispute the 200.
* THE organisers of the Vienna marathon plan to attach computer chips
to runners' shoes to stop a repeat of last year's cheating, when
competitors rode the Metro and took short cuts.
A micro-chip tied to shoelaces will enable organisers to check they
stick to the route. Last year an Italian, who clocked the same time as
the women's winner, rode part of the way on the underground.
The chip will also allow precise measuring of start and finish times.
Many runners in mass starts lose several minutes before reaching the
start line.

STEWART Houston's task as Arsenal manager will be to restore the
integrity once as synoymous with the club as marble halls and red
shirts.
He has three months to repair the north London club's tarnished image,
defend the European Cup-winners' Cup, and prove himself a worthy
successor to George Graham, sacked yesterday under the shadow of
damaging findings by the Premier League's ''bung'' inquiry.
Houston accepted the job of managing Arsenal until the end of the
season after talks with chairman Peter Hill-Wood, who decided to appoint
from within rather than go for the fans' choice, Martin O'Neill of
Wycombe.
And Houston said: ''I'm happy, delighted, and can't wait to get on
with the job.''
He will take charge officially for the game at Crystal Palace on
Saturday and can expect to use the Highbury chequebook as Graham was
only part way through a spending spree encouraged by the board.
In his programme notes for Tuesday night's match against Nottingham
Forest Graham wrote: ''I haven't finished spending. I'm still rebuilding
and have cash available for more signings.''
Within hours of taking charge Houston led Arsenal to their first home
league win in four months with Chris Kiwomya scoring the only goal of
the game against Forest.
Now he must repair the reputation of a club shattered not only by the
Graham allegations but also Paul Merson's alcohol, gambling, and drug
confessions.
Highbury players have also made newspaper headlines and this week
David Seaman and Lee Dixon were named as ticket sources for unruly
England fans at the abandoned Dublin international in Ireland.
Houston, born in Dunoon, plied his trade at left-back for Chelsea,
Brentford, Manchester United, and Sheffield United before finishing his
playing career as player-coach at Colchester.
It was at Old Trafford that his relationship with Graham began.
Graham eventually brought him to Highbury as reserve team coach and he
was promoted to No.2 after his team won The Football Combination for the
first time in six years.
* PARTICK Thistle keeper Nicky Walker is struggling to be fit for
Saturday's Scottish premier division relegation battle with Dundee
United.
Walker injured a calf muscle while playing for Scotland B against
Northern Ireland B at Easter Road on Tuesday night.
* STIRLING Albion's promotion bid was held up last night when their
game at Meadowbank was washed out by the winter weather. The clubs will
try again next Wednesday after the Scottish League arranged the
following midweek programme.

FALKIRK, second-bottom of the table, were last night trying to sign
five new players in an unprecedented bid to stay in the premier
division.
If their market-place negotiations succeed, they will be able to
introduce a handful of fresh players in the side for the game with Hibs
on Saturday.
Two Motherwell forwards, Steve Kirk and Paul McGrillen, are already
set for Brockville in a #300,000 deal that also involved Eddie May going
to Fir Park, while three other players are in serious negotiations to
move to Falkirk.
Gary Mackay, of Hearts, is believed to be one of them. He has been
wanted by the Brockville side for some time and I understand a swop deal
which would take David Elliot of St Mirren to Falkirk, with Brian Rice
going to Paisley, is also on the cards.
However, Falkirk chairman George Fulston would say only: ''I will be
seeing the club chairman of one of the players in the morning and I hope
we will settle that deal then.''
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies has been determined to strengthen his
team as it became clear that they were sinking closer and closer to
demotion to the first division, but his attempts to alter his squad were
not expected to be as radical as yesterday's moves indicated.
The transactions will probably cost Falkirk around #500,000 -- a major
sum for a club of their resources.
But, whatever the price of the machinations, the cost of relegation
would be a great deal more over the next season and Fulston is in
complete support of his manager in the attempt to find a way of securing
premier division status.
Motherwell fans might be disappointed to see the departure of
McGrillen and particularly Kirk, who has been an effective and popular
scorer with the Fir Park side.
But manager Alex McLeish explained: ''Despite McGrillen's obvious
potential, I have agreed to let him go. He has been a fringe first-team
player without making the breakthrough. Now, he will get the chance to
do so with another club.
''Kirk has done a marvellous job with this club but again has not been
a first-team regular, and he will also benefit from a move.''
McLeish was enthusiastic about the arrival of May. ''He is a
multi-purpose player who will certainly strengthen our squad. I have
been trying for some time to bring in a positive type of player and I
believe this is the one. He has been outstanding in defence or attack
any time we have seen him.''
Five new players are plenty to be going on with, but Falkirk are also
trying hard to bring Port Vale's Joe Allon to Scotland.

HAMILTON has a message for the plethora of shopping centres and retail
parks which have sprung up in the central belt: Watch out. We are going
to be Number One.
The #50m Hamilton Ahead initiative, established with the district
council as a prime mover, promises a revitalisation and regeneration of
the town centre, coupled with a brand-new retail and leisure park on the
adjoining Palace Grounds.
This will feature a top-quality food superstore extending to 60,000 sq
ft, a 10-screen cinema, an arts centre, and a variety of high-amenity
shopping facilities. The retail park will ultimately extend to 160,000
sq ft and the whole scheme will be served by dramatically improved
transport links, ample new parking provision, a hotel, and the complete
eradication of that part of Motherwell Road which at present separates
the town centre from Palace Grounds.
That road will be re-routed to serve the new retail park.
Pedestrianisation will be the order of the day and the existing Regent
Way is targeted for upgrading, improvement, and a roofing over the mall.
''There is some fine architecture in the town centre,'' says project
director Stephen Hulance. ''The plan is to capitalise on this to bring
out the quality in these rather than fight against them. So we have the
advantage of this tradition in Hamilton, while being able to build a
retail park on a greenfield site right next to the central area.
''It is a unique project: other towns have had to content themselves
with either a town-centre upgrading, or an out-of-town retail park. We
shall have both, side by side.''
Hulance, who had been in charge of a variety of major projects down
south, was brought in by the partnership last October to head a
full-time team and put the carefully planned scheme into action. In the
same month the project was publicly launched and a large-scale
consultation process began with the public and with the business and
retail world.
Reaction from both has been favourable and 2500 people visited a
public exhibition about a month ago at which the project was outlined
and illustrated in detail.
Stephen Hulance emphasises the high design standards that are to be
incorporated in the master planning process which is about to start,
particularly with regard to the new-build retail park. Hamilton is
getting its chance to catch up with the best, but it wants to overtake,
not equal, its rival shopping and leisure centres.
The district council leader, Councillor Tom McCabe, estimates that
2000 jobs might be created once the project is complete, not counting
the significant number of construction jobs generated by the building
work. ''We knew what we wanted for Hamilton,'' he says, ''and Hamilton
Ahead is another example of partnership in action for the good of the
district.''
The Hamilton Enterprise Partnership set up to develop the initiative
is made up of the council, Strathclyde Regional Council, Lanarkshire
Development Agency, and Hamilton Enterprise Development Company.
At the Palace Grounds, the new development will displace some sports
facilities including tennis courts, soccer pitches, bowling green and a
mini-golf. These are to be re-located to the north of the park, with
some of them being upgraded in the process.

LEICESTER City seem to have little chance of avoiding the drop from
the FA Carling Premiership, but they moved off the bottom of the table
after a remarkable fightback at Villa Park last night.
They were heading for their seventeenth league defeat of the season
when they trailed Aston Villa 4-1 late in the game. But substitute David
Lowe scored twice, with Iwan Roberts also on target, as they hit back
with three goals in the last 13 minutes,
Aston Villa had gone in front after eight minutes with Dean Saunders'
seventeenth goal of the season. Steve Staunton hit a second late in the
first half, and Dwight Yorke made it 3-0 on the hour.
Mark Robins pulled one back a minute later, but Tommy Johnson restored
Villa's three-goal advantage with a lob.
Then came the fightback, with Roberts reducing the arrears before Lowe
struck in after 80 minutes, and right on time. The point was enough to
lift Leicester above Ipswich on goal difference.
Alan Shearer grabbed his twenty-ninth goal of the season as Blackburn
maintained their two-point lead at the top of the table with a 2-1 win
over Wimbledon. He struck after just two minutes 45 seconds at Ewood
Park and helped to set up the second for Mark Atkins after 25 minutes.
Efan Ekoku pulled a goal back six minutes before half-time to complete
the scoring.
Manchester United remain hot on the heels of the leaders following
their 2-0 win over a disappointing Norwich side.
Paul Ince gave United the perfect start with a goal after two minutes
and, after Ashley Ward had headed against the top of the crossbar for
Norwich, Andrei Kanchelskis made it 2-0.
Kanchelskis went closest to extending United's lead when he struck a
post in the second half.
Irish international Niall Quinn gave beleaguered Manchester City
manager Brian Horton a boost with the first goal in their 2-0 win over
Ipswich.
Ghanaian Anthony Yeboah made his debut for Leeds against Everton at
Elland Road. And he proved to be the difference between the sides,
scoring the only goal of the game nine minutes from the end.
Earlier, Anders Limpar had fired a shot against the foot of the post
for Everton.
Both Coca-Cola Cup semi-final second legs -- Crystal Palace v
Liverpool and Bolton v Swindon -- were victims of waterlogged pitches,
as were the Premiership matches at Chelsea, Newcastle and West Ham.

THE arrival of two men at the seat of power three years ago coincided
with Hamilton District Council's realisation of the need to restructure.
The appointments of Michael Docherty as chief executive and of
Councillor Tom McCabe as group leader came at the right time. Both
appreciated that change was in the air and that a modern local authority
could not afford for members and officers to think and work as separate
units.
''There was a certain amount of disenchantment,'' says Docherty.
''Some of us felt there was an inability to concentrate on key issues
and services. Also, departments were working too independently of each
other.''
Councillor McCabe believes the council was too paternalistic. ''The
structures that had been set up dated back to 1975 when two-tier local
government was introduced,'' he says. ''Maybe the council had become too
fixed in its ways. Maybe there was a take-what-you-get attitude to
service.''
Both men thought that latent talent in the council was being
suppressed and that a restructuring was needed to allow people to have a
meaningful input. As a result, a new divisional structure was
introduced, with five divisional directors reporting directly to the
chief executive and drawing all the council's work together.
Committee structures were changed to allow members to concentrate more
on policy issues and less on details. Working parties were also
introduced to allow members and officers to exchange ideas freely. Team
briefings ensured that all staff were kept informed, and the council's
financial performance and overall efficiency quickly improved.
Hamilton District Council now feels it has set a pattern which might
profitably be followed when the unitary authority of South Lanarkshire
comes into being, taking over from Hamilton, East Kilbride and
Clydesdale Districts and the Rutherglen and Cambuslang parts of Glasgow
District.
Meanwhile it continues its work to improve leisure facilities and make
the district attractive to tourists and other visitors. The museum at
Chatelherault, a beautiful building long regarded as Hamilton District's
jewel in the crown, is being equipped with improved visitor and
educational facilities which will make it an even more interesting
source of material for those exploring the district's rich historical
heritage.
New conference facilities are also being installed, making greater use
of the available floorspace without affecting the overall appearance of
the building, and a new cafeteria will be available to conference
participants and to the public.
At the Muir Street Museums in the town itself, an amalgamation is to
take place with the Regimental Museum of the Cameronians (Scottish
Rifles) to produce a major attraction for local people and visitors.

INCLEMENT weather again threatens to disrupt shinty's fixture card,
with snow and sleet across the country liable to jeopardise several
fixtures on the opening day of the sport's premier competition.
This is the last time clubs will be setting out to qualify for the
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup final, as the whisky distillers' 18-year-long
sponsorship comes to an end at this year's final in Oban.
Last year's shock winners, Kyles Athletic, face a trip to
Glenurquhart. The Glen's form has fluctuated wildly this season, but if
they can produce their best form on the tight Drumnadrochit pitch, then
the holders could be in for a torrid time.
The tie also is a return match for last year's semi-final at Oban,
where Kyles performed one of their legendary Houdini tricks to win in
extra time and qualify for the final.
Cup favourites Kingussie open their campaign at home to Lovat, and the
Badenoch giants have considerable injury problems, with at least four
players struggling to be fit after last Saturday's 9-2 win over
Glenurquhart.
Lovat gave Kingussie a run for their money in the league match at the
Dell earlier in the season and were unlucky to go down as heavily as
6-3. Given Kingussie's injury problems, Lovat will not have a better
chance of progressing.
Oban Camanachd's bid to have their tie against Skye re-scheduled away
from the lesser of Oban's two venues has been rejected, to the annoyance
of the town side, and they are due to face Skye at Ganavan. This will
require a formidable performance by Skye if they are to negotiate the
first round of the competition they last won five years ago. Oban must
be anticipating a good run this year, with the cup final due on Oban's
premier ground.
Oban Celtic, who have first shout on Mossfiel this weekend, face
Glasgow Mid Argyll. Celtic's Alastair Campbell, the south fixtures'
secretary, will be taking more than a passing interest in this one. He
said: ''Any postponements will be disastrous at this stage in the
season, and they will be immediately re-scheduled for next week. That is
going to start putting pressure on clubs immediately.''
If four ties survive on Saturday, the draw for the quarter-finals of
the competition is due to be made on BBC Radio Scotland in the evening.
An error in transmission in the shinty report in Monday's Herald led
to the suggestion that Lovat's Allan MacRae, an officer with Northern
Constabulary, had missed the recent North Qualifying Cup final at
Inverness owing to suspension for having accumulated three bookings. The
player who missed the match due to suspension was, in fact, Roddy Munro.

CONFIDENT world champion Herbie Hide yesterday hammered out a
heavyweight warning to Riddick Bowe as the countdown began to their WBO
title showdown in Las Vegas a week on Saturday.
''I'm not a pussycat. I'll beat the living daylights out of him,''
declared the 23-year-old before flying out to the United States.
Hide will have some extra space in which to carry out his threat, as
the Nevada State Athletic Commission have ordered a 24-foot ring to be
erected in the 15,000-seater MGM Grand Arena. That will suit Hide's
speed and style against the bigger but slower Bowe.
''Every time I heard people talking about Bowe I thought 'Jesus!', but
when I watched him on tape I thought there was nothing to get excited
about,'' added Hide.
''There's nothing I see in Bowe which worries me. It seems as if
people think it's going to be easy for Bowe.
''That makes me angry, and I shall go into the ring trying to knock
him out. This fight is all about control, knowing what I've got to beat
him. I know what Bowe can do.''
''I saw Bowe's recent fight with Larry Donald and it looked as if
Donald hurt him on one occasion -- and Donald couldn't break an egg with
a baseball bat. Bowe didn't seem to have confidence in his power.''
Hide will be receiving a handsome #2.3m for a fight in which American
critics predict he will come off second-best against the heavyweight
rated the best in the world in a recent poll of US journalists.
Richie Woodhall fought with fire and fierce determination to win the
vacant European middleweight title in his home town of Telford last
night. He stopped Italy's Silvio Branco after one minute 36 seconds of
the ninth round and, as an additional reward, now qualifies for a shot
at the WBC version of the world crown.
Branco had a bad cut and swelling on his left eye before Woodhall
rained in a series of big rights to persuade French referee Andre
Ducrocq to step in.

SINGAPORE: Six families in a Singapore housing estate have been
alarmed by a snake popping up in toilet bowls, the Straits Times
reported. Some residents think there may be more than one snake living
in the sewers, but efforts by the estate managers, Singapore Zoo, and
police have failed to catch them. ''I used to visit the toilet in the
dark at night,'' said Jenny Bose, ''but now I switch on the light and
watch for bubbles before I do anything.''

WITH a couple of weeks in Florida last month having eased the pain of
training, City of Glasgow's trio, Fraser Walker, Alison Sheppard, and
Euan Stewart, begin the competitive countdown to the European
Championship trials in the British Grand Prix Meet in Leeds this
weekend.
Walker, the Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, will face Simon
Handley (City of Bristol) and the local internationalist, David Warren,
in the 200m medley, while Stewart will be aiming to make an early mark
in the butterfly in the build-up to the trials in Sheffield in April.
Sheppard, a veteran of two Olympics, needs to hold off the English
teenage threat of Alex Bennett and Sue Rolph if she is to make a third
European championship in Vienna in August.
The London-based Angela Pendrich is another of Scotland's European
championship hopefuls, and she is determined to end her run of bad luck
with a first British cap in Austria.
Having just missed out on selection for the Barcelona Olympics, she
broke an arm in a riding accident 18 months ago, then suffered wisdom
teeth problems at last summer's Commonwealth Games.
However, after having switched clubs last summer, she said: ''The
training has being going well, and I'm certainly due a change in
fortune.''
England's Susan Colling, a Stirling University bursar, will be among
Pendrich's rivals for the distance free-style selection, and she is also
launching her long-course season in Leeds this weekend.
Fellow Stirling students Kerry Martin and Pauline McLean, Milngavie
and Bearsden's Scottish Club championship winning line-up of Forbes
Dunlop, Jamie McNeil, Iain Teaz, Tom Griffith, and Andrew Hamilton, and
Warrender's Richard Hope are among the other leading Scots travelling to
Leeds.
City of Glasgow's Craig Miller, a contender for this summer's European
Junior championships in Geneva, also will be in Leeds, and he had cause
for celebration yesterday with selection for the Scottish Schools' team
for the Speedo Home Internationals in Cork on March 25. The team is:
BOYS: Senior -- G Henderson (Old Machar Academy), M Snape (Robert
Gordon's College), M McIntosh (Moray College), C Miller (Thomas Muir
HS), J Donn (St Luke's HS), S Bonner (Perth HS), S Young (Kilmarnock
Academy).
Intermediate -- B Harkin (Alloa Academy), B Morgan (Dunfermline HS), C
Bain (Aberdeen GS), D Leith (James Gillespie's HS).
Junior -- S Kidd (Bo'ness Academy), F Bisley (Bearsden Academy), J
Galloway (Inverkeithing HS), D Rose (Abronhill HS), S Olsson (Banchory
HS), S McEwan (Glenwood HS), E Rafferty (St John Ogilvie HS).
GIRLS: Senior -- K McCrone (Claremont HS), K Hope (Dundee HS), J
Warner (Bell Baxter HS), T Porter (Mackie Academy), M Livingston
(Craigmount HS), C Runge (Arbroath HS), F Campbell (Lochgelly HS), J
Gray (Harlaw Academy), G Anderson (Eastwood HS).
Intermediate -- L Paterson (Greenock Academy), K-M Lewis (Our Lady's
HS), L McCluckie (Alloa Academy), L Kent (Falkirk HS).
Junior -- L McLaren (Beath HS), J Rees (Inverkeithing HS), D Borland
(Craigholme), R Leaver (Bishopbriggs HS).

KILMARNOCK rally driver Robbie Head has spent much of the past year in
neutral, but now he has been given the chance to respark his career this
season, having landed a drive with the Renault Dealer Rallying Team in
the 1995 Mobil 1/Top Gear British Rally Championship.
Like his French team-mate, former world group N champion Alain
Oreille, the Scot will contest the five-round series over Britain's
forest and tarmac roads in a Auto-Meca prepared, Renault Clio Williams,
the 220bhp machine which already is a proven force at world-championship
level.
Head, whose last regular works drive came in 1993 as a member of the
Ford team, sees this as an opportunity to kick-start his ambitions.
''Renault has a tremendous record in motorsport and I realise how
lucky I am to be joining one of the top teams.''
Head, who started testing the distinctive yellow-and-blue pocket
rocket in Wales yesterday, added: ''It's a big step for any manufacturer
to come straight in and contest a series against several established
teams, especially on gravel. But the British series is the leading
Formula 2 championship, and driving for Renault has made me excited for
the coming season.''
Head will be co-driven by Ulsterman Terry Harryman, a winner of
world-championship events with Finn Ari Vatanen, who sat beside Robbie
when he finished third overall on the 1989 Tour of Britain.
* DAMON Hill has reacted to Formula One rival Nigel Mansell's
revolutionary new car by commenting: ''I thought it was a joke.''
Mansell launched his striking McLaren-Mercedes MP4/10 -- which has a
secondary aerofoil mounted on the tail of the engine cover -- last week.
Hill was backed by team-mate David Coulthard. ''If it has performance
advantages then surely they would have kept it hidden away,'' said the
Scot.

SANDY Lyle, once one of the ''big six'' of European golf, is hoping
that after a break of more than three months, he can recapture his old
magic and be in contention for major honours again.
Lyle returns to competition at the Open Mediterrania in Valencia today
for the first time since the Mexican Open in November and said: ''My
first goal is to do well at the US Masters.''
The Scot won the Masters title in 1988, three years after having won
the Open championship at Sandwich. Yet, since his second major success,
his form has been in and out, while Nick Faldo, Jose-Maria Olazabal,
Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, and Ian Woosnam, once his greatest
rivals, have continued to be successful.
His place among the ''big six'' has now been taken by Colin
Montgomerie, but Lyle, laid back as ever, refuses to be worried. ''I've
never had such a long rest before,'' he said. ''I would have begun a
little earlier, but my wife gave birth to our son five weeks ago and
that delayed my return.''
Lyle intends to play the Valencia tournament and another in Spain next
week and then go to the USA for three or four tournaments before the
Masters.
He is reticient when it comes to discussing the Ryder Cup. Lyle, an
automatic choice from 1979 to 1987, asked to be left out of the 1989
team because of lack of form and did not qualify for either the 1991 or
1993 team.
This year's match is at Oak Hill in Rochester, New York in September,
but Lyle said: ''These are early days to talk about the Cup. I shall
definitely play if I can win my place.
''It seems an uphill climb to get back to the sort of limelight I had
in the past, but golf is an unpredictable game. Take Peter Jacobsen. He
could not get his card in the States last year and now he's just won two
tournaments in a row.''
Lyle, who used a broomstick putter at times last year, has gone back
to a short putter and said: ''I don't know yet what sort of year I'm
going to have, but I intend to enjoy it.''
As for this week's tournament, Lyle added: ''Most of the field have
had a head start on me this year, but who knows what might happen.''
Valencia has not attracted any of the biggest names, but the
147-strong field includes 20 former or present Ryder Cup players, with
six of the 1993 team, Mark James, Sam Torrance, Peter Baker, Barry Lane,
Italian Costantino Rocca, and Sweden's Joakim Haeggman, in contention.
* FRED Couples, who astonished Europe by winning the first two events
of their tour in Dubai and Morocco, and John Daly, who has just returned
from a reasonably success trip to Australia, are two of the favourites
in the Los Angeles Open, now called the Nissan Open, which starts on the
par-71 6946-yard Riviera course today.
With Corey Pavin, who held off Couples narrowly to win last year, not
having the best of starts to his season, this tournament is in the
market to be won by any of the outstanding professionals here who
include Ben Crenshaw, Paul Azinger, Phil Mickelson, and Craig Stadler.
But Couples is now in his prime at 35 and although he has won only one
major title -- the US Masters of 1992 -- he could well be favourite for
the US PGA championship which will be held on this same course from
August 10 to 13.
In addition, Couples is sure to be one of America's strong men in the
defence of the Ryder Cup at Rochester, New York, from September 21 to 24
but, first, he has to show if he can maintain his form.

HERIOT-WATT'S opening match in the defence of their British
Universities women's hockey championship was delayed for three-quarters
of an hour yesterday at Cramond. The team-bus driver for their
opponents, Northumbria, had difficulty finding the pitch but his
passengers will now be disappointed that he ever located it.
They were sent crashing out of the championship 8-0 by a Heriot-Watt
side which took a long time to settle into the game, but once star
striker Gillian Soutar found the way to goal in 25 minutes, the English
side were swept aside in an avalanche of goals.
Soutar, the Scottish under-21 centre forward, scored five of Heriot
Watt's goals after having laid the foundation for their triumph with two
strikes just before half-time and another immediately after the break.
By that point Northumbria had thrown in the towel. Susan Gilmour added
to their misery by scoring another double while Dorileen Forbes
completed the scoring when her shot, which was meant as a cross to
Gilmour, found its way into the Northumbria goal.
This score was the least Forbes deserved. She had had an outstanding
match and, along with Val Neill in midfield, helped keep the industrious
strikers well supplied with ammunition, which enabled them to destroy
the opposition and book their place in the last eight of the
championship.
In the men's event, Edinburgh fell at the first hurdle, losing 2-0 at
Durham, but their seconds scored a 1-0 victory over Newcastle with a
goal from Alistair McEwan in the reserve cup. Heriot-Watt's second
string made it a club double in their event, beating Durham 3-0.

RICHARD Corsie's hopes of a record fourth win in the #132,000
Churchill Insurance World Indoor Singles Championship was put to the
test in Preston yesterday when he lined up against another former
champion, Ian Shuback, in the quarter-finals.
Corsie, who had won his opening two matches in straight sets, trailed
the Australian 2-1, but hit back to take the last two sets and secure a
semi-final spot.
Corsie finally won 2-7, 7-0, 4-7, 7-2, 7-0 to set up a match tomorrow
with Norfolk's Mervyn King, who had earlier beaten Hong Kong's
Scots-born Mark McMahonalso in five sets.
Shuback took the opening set 7-2 but three ends later the match was
all-square after a Corsie whitewash.
Corsie then forged 4-3 ahead in the next but Shuback hit back with two
singles and a double to wrap up the set 7-4.
The Commonwealth gold medallist then produced a whirlwind finish to
take him to victory. Leading 3-2 after four ends of the fourth set,
Corsie picked up a three and a single to win it 7-2. Four ends later it
was all over.
Earlier, McMahon had thrown away a good lead before going down to
King. McMahon won the opening set 7-2, the second 7-5, and led 4-0 in
the third before King's revival.
The Norfolk man recovered to take the third set 7-5, sailed through
the fourth 7-1 in just four ends, then recovered from 4-2 down to take
the decider 7-4.

<HEADLINE>Twisting border that marks out Europe's final frontier</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
All people living in the island of Ireland are united as citizens of
the EU. European Editor MURRAY RITCHIE in Brussels considers how the
breaking down of national barriers may make the old divisions
meaningless.
IN the normal world the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic should be long gone.
As an internal European Union frontier it should also have been among
those to be removed in the next few weeks under the terms of the Single
European Act. Instead it still stands, tortuously twisting and turning
through farmyards, homes, and meadows, as a symbol of the bitter divide
which has lasted most of this century.
Political reality has dictated that this is no ordinary internal
frontier. The Irish Border area, and the communities at odds in the
troubles which have bedevilled economic and social progress in both
Northern Ireland and the Republic for most of this century, will now be
given extra EU assistance towards the day when peoples voluntarily
dispense with frontiers as an act of reconciliation.
The European Commission, anxious to show that the EU can actually be
relevant in the lives of ordinary folk, put up #240m to support peace
and reconciliation immediately after the ceasefire was announced.
It wanted to show solidarity with both peoples on the island on the
basis that they were Europeans all.
The aid programme was organised on the personal initiative of Mr
Jacques Delors, predecessor of the present commission president, Mr
Jacques Santer, who warmly endorsed the Delors strategy yesterday.
Mr Santer welcomed the framework document and promised that the EU
would stand by to help the peace process ''any way it can''.
He described the document was a further important step towards peace
and reconciliation. Mr Santer also backed the launch of the consultative
process which, he said, should strengthen the ''democratic foundations
for the promotion and establishment of agreement among the people of the
island of Ireland on the basis of full respect for the rights of both
traditions''.
However, the #240m is just a drop in the EU bucket for the border
area. Most of Ireland's EU money comes from the structural funds of the
EU which are designed to assist the neediest areas of the community.
Northern Ireland as a whole is due to receive about #1000m in EU
funding between now and end of the century.
The Irish Republic is in line for more than #7000m over the same
period, because it is a so-called ''cohesion'' country entitled to
special aid in order to encourage its economy to be strong enough in the
next few years for economic and monetary union and the envisaged single
European currency.
Additional funding is also expected from other EU initiatives.
Brussels has long agonised over the Irish question, which is one of its
most stubborn internal conflicts.
The EU was anxious to exploit the new peace in any way possible, so
that it could gain some credit for being seen to help social and
economic progress in the area.
As a first response after the ceasefire, the Council of Ministers of
the EU, at the commission's prompting, increased the EU's annual
contribution to the International Fund for Ireland from #12m to #16m.
Political backing for the peace process was also expressed in the
European Parliament.
The commission next created a task force to look into more ways of
giving practical help to Northern Ireland and the border counties of the
Republic. These included Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo, and
Donegal.
The force's primary task was to consider ways of developing and
refocusing the policies of the EU, to help those most affected by the
conflict and to find a way of encouraging them to live in mutual respect
and higher prosperity.
This rather airy-fairy notion was give some practical clout at the
Essen summit in December when the new aid package was formally agreed.
Earlier this month, Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, Commissioner for Regional
Policy in succession to Scotland's Mr Bruce Millan, approved the
guidelines for a community initiative which made the money available.
The #240m will cover only the first three years of the peace process.
Overall, the support programme will last five years. This money will be
additional to all other existing aid packages for community and regional
affairs.
Yet more money will probably be set aside for the 1998-99 period, but
will be subject to the commission's approval. The political and economic
situation by that time will be the guiding principle.
The new aid package is, in effect, a concerted effort by the
commission and the EU's member states to create jobs, cut unemployment,
and promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border counties
of Ireland by encouraging grassroots cross-border co-operation.
There are five priority areas where the EU believes it can contribute
to the peace process and reinforce reconciliation:
* Employment opportunities.
* Urban and rural regeneration measures.
* Cross-border development.
* Social inclusion (Euro-jargon for social protection or assistance).
* Investment and industrial development.
One of the unspoken and very long-term visions of Ireland held by some
European politicians is of the island as a part of a federal Europe
where borders are meaningless.
This might eventually remove the border which symbolizes the Irish
divide, but this vision would not apply just to Ireland and its
constituent parts. It would affect the entire EU.
That day is, however, a long way off. There are some in the EU who
believe that the border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the
island will be the last internal frontier to fall, but will not do so
until some time comfortably into the next millennium. The best that can
be hoped for in the meantime is a sustained peace on both of its sides.

Hamilton District is facing up to a new era with the reorganisation of
local government in April of next year, it seems determined to do so
with some style. Eric Kennedy reports
LIKE a bride preparing for a new groom, the district council has
achieved a streamlining which has brought about a significant
improvement in its way of doing things. The town itself is on the verge
of a totally new look, the district's housing stock is going through a
honeymoon period (in terms of double glazing and central heating at
least), and should anyone be thinking of a dowry, then the people of
Hamilton District should surely be raising their glasses to the #21 cut
in council tax for next year, announced only a fortnight ago.
Hamilton will join its new partners in the South Lanarkshire Council
in 1996 as a local authority which has shown the benefits of partnership
particularly between elected members and council officers in identifying
the ''slack'' in council services and doing something about them.
Informal yet efficient new management structures were introduced two
years ago, with the council tax cut only one of the partial results.
Another is the #5.5m budget now available for capital projects in
respect of economic development and improved leisure and other
facilities in the current financial year, twice as high as in any
previous 12-month period.
And the partnership theme does not end there. The private sector is an
enthusiastic component of the Hamilton Ahead Initiative which will see
the town centre transformed and a whole new retail-park and leisure
initiative take shape in the adjoining palace grounds. This #50m
six-year project is being funded largely by private money.
The indications are that things are happening in a town which has
allowed some of its neighbours to steal the retail limelight in recent
years. The ''leakage'' to these other towns, in terms of both retail
initiatives and the people who patronise them, is to be halted and
Hamilton knows it has the best of both worlds. Its own tradition and
fine architecture are clear plus points in its existing town-centre
infrastructure, and the palace grounds project amounts literally to a
greenfield site right on its doorstep.
Transport and leisure plans also promise to take Hamilton right into
the twenty-first century premier league as a quality place in which to
live and work, and to visit.
The achievements of Hamilton District Council are the results, says
chief executive Michael Docherty, of a commitment to making things
happen. The restructuring was born of a desire to identify the areas in
need of priority action, and to banish the them-and-us attitudes so
often found in any organisation.
It also sought to remove the departmentalised approach that was
prevalent and substitute it with a corporate one. Special training
programmes, some of them still continuing, are aimed at improving an
all-round awareness and competence in officers, rather than what
Docherty describes as a ''narrow professionalism''.
The council, in other words, had to learn to pull together staff and
managers, officers and members. With this in mind, five divisional
directors were appointed to co-ordinate the work of all divisions, with
chief executive Docherty supervising the whole effort.
This divisional structure has helped the council provide better and
more cost-effective services through improved committee structures,
upgraded training and information systems, team building, and improved
communications channels both inside and outside the town house
headquarters.
An enhanced quality of life for everyone living and working in
Hamilton District is the target, and the corporate plan has also helped
the preparations for local-government reorganisation. As Council Leader
Tom McCabe puts it: ''We might have reservations about the way the
Government went about the introduction of single-tier local government,
but there is no doubt that the South Lanarkshire Council represents a
time of opportunity and choice for the people it will serve. Hamilton is
ready to play its full part in making it a success.''
Hamilton's rentpayers have been kept in touch right down the line, via
bulletins and forums at which the council's policies on housing
allocation, refurbishment, repairs, and rent collection have been
thoroughly explained and examined.
Already, the council has double-glazed more than 6000 houses, with the
1998 target of doing this to every house well within grasp. Nearly 2000
homes have had new central-heating systems installed and all council
houses, apart from a few whose tenants refused, have had smoke alarms
fitted.
All of this is part of an ambitious four-year project, embarked upon
two years ago, to improve the housing stock. About #20m has been spent
so far and a further #11.5m will be spent in the coming year.
Special-needs housing has been established in partnership with various
housing associations in Blantyre, Uddingston, Burnbank, and Stonehouse,
and 12 new flats for homeless people were opened in Old Town, Hamilton
late last month.
And there are plans to improve the lot of the elderly, with extra-care
housing being provided at High Blantyre, and at Hollandbush in Hamilton
itself.
Leisure facilities have been another key area for action. The #6m
Water Palace being opened this summer will meet the needs of serious
swimmers with a 25-metre pool while providing a state-of-the-art leisure
pool with flumes, a ''lazy river'', and an adventure area for the
youngsters.
The council also takes pride in the #1m waste transfer loading station
to be opened later this year on the outskirts of the district, which
will use the latest and most environmentally friendly methods of rubbish
disposal, with emphasis on the recycling of industrial and domestic
waste.
The unit, situated in comparatively open country between the edge of
Hamilton and Strathaven, will allow the demolition of the present
unsightly building at Hillhouse which is, apart from anything else,
situated in the middle of a built-up area.
''We don't consider that an incinerator, as it was when built in the
sixties, or any other garbage-disposal facility sits easily in a
built-up or residential area,'' says Council Leader McCabe. ''We have
grounds for optimism that this old facility will not only be demolished
but that it will give way to an extension of existing industrial units,
thus providing new job opportunities for people.''
There is already an industrial estate on another part of Hillhouse,
comprising a series of managed units which have been so successful with
a 100% take-up rate that the council has determined to repeat the
experiment in other parts of the district.
There are other council initiatives by way of attracting industry and
supporting the companies already there. A new Enterprise Zone site at
Brandon Street/Leechlee Road is to be developed for prestige office
space.
In the past three years about 1700 sq metres of industrial floorspace
has been constructed, five hectares of industrial land has been acquired
in Larkhall, and more than 10 hectares of industrial land has been
serviced in Blantyre, Burnbank, and Larkhall, attracting nearly #1m of
European funding in the process.
Hamilton's new-look town centre will also see an investment of nearly
#1m in improving the bus-rail interchange which is going to enhance
access to a shopping and leisure area likely to prove one of the most
attractive, accessible, and exciting in the country.

IT SHOULD be drawn to the attention of Mr Gerry Malone, MP, that the
determinants of health are many and embrace the living and working
conditions of people and there is no way that ill health can be divorced
from the social economic circumstances which unfortunately afflict
people in areas of deprivation.
Glasgow City Council has recognised that fact by becoming a member of
the Healthy Cities Project in conjunction with the World Health
Organisation, Strathclyde region, and the health board and are actively
looking at ways of developing policies which will impact significantly
on the production of health within this city.
I would remind Mr Malone that health is not an activity, it is not
jogging, or eating well, or not smoking, or living in a good
environment, or being employed; rather it is the outcome of all those
activities as well. Glaswegians are more or less healthy according to
the resources which they have in their everyday lives. Health is the
outcome of those factors combined in the lives of individuals and
communities.
Personal behaviour, access to services, warm homes, affordable fuel,
reasonable employment, and good social physical environments -- that is
what determines the health of the citizens of this city and other
British cities and it is the failure of successive Conservative
Governments to address the social and economic issues of this country
that has resulted in the terrible plight of people in various parts of
our country who live in areas of deprivation.
Shame on Mr Malone that, with a West of Scotland background, he should
prevaricate in such a way over an issue of such major importance.
There is clearly a direct link between poverty and ill health. There
is no link between Tory policy and compassion and understanding. The
problems of the poor in our deprived areas will unfortunately not be
resolved as long as the this Government remains in office because it
does not even recognise that the problem exists.
Hopefully this Government will soon be removed form office and then
the resources of the nation should be put to proper use in tackling the
major problems which afflict so many of our unfortunate fellow citizens
in areas of acute deprivation.

WHEN my grandfather's uncle, Sir William Arrol, built the Forth
railway bridge it was the first large structure to be built of steel;
those were the days of riveting and the last rivet was driven in 105
years ago in 1890.
Steel, however, must be maintained with primary and top coats of
suitable paint. The bridge has always been maintained in this way until
now, when Railtrack in its wisdom has decided that such treatment is not
necessary.
I can only say, with a considerable knowledge of the structural
industry, that one cannot reduce maintenance on a steel structure
without a grave risk of corrosion leading eventually to failure of
structural members.
I sincerely hope that, before there is a serious collapse, Railtrack
reconsiders its policy and, once more, restores the bridge to a sound
state of preservation.
It is, after all, one of Scotland's historic landmarks and carries a
very considerable amount of passenger traffic in an exposed situation.

HOW much I appreciated John Macleod's article (February 14). As a
full-time mother I find it encouraging to see someone supporting us.
I was stopped in the street by two young women doing market research.
When I answered their question on occupation they were going to write
down ''unemployed''.
I explained that our children are home educated and, besides
housework, I take them to activities and probably work longer hours than
office workers, so they had better not list me as unemployed.
It is an insult to full-time mothers that because we do not receive a
salary our work is considered non-essential.
I doubt if any employer would believe an employee who said their work
would improve on a part ''quality'' time basis rather than full-time.
As the mother of eight children I willingly count myself with those
who consider mothering a proud profession.
God bless John Macleod.

IS THE loss of the sleeper service on the West Highland Line the
beginning of a further chapter of decline of our railway system? It has
been alleged that users of this service are being subsidised by #450 per
trip, leading to losses of millions of pounds each year. How do
accountants arrive at such figures when, at least for the time being,
the line remains in place and only one locomotive, half a dozen sleeping
cars, and a few personnel are displaced? Where in this situation do the
savings of millions of pounds arise?
The answer is that there are no savings of this magnitude. Almost all
the fixed costs of providing the track and signalling will be
re-allocated to those services which remain on the line. Some people
will lose their jobs and draw benefits. The revenue from the passengers
will be lost and the local economy will be poorer. Neither the balance
sheet of the West Highlands nor that of the railways nationally will be
significantly improved.
Accountants and economists have struggled for years and have been paid
millions of pounds in consultancy fees to find ways of sharing out the
costs of railway track between individual trains. They have failed
because by far the greatest cost is incurred by the decision to provide
a railway service in the first place. Once there, the wear and tear
associated with running trains accounts for only about 3% of the
day-to-day costs of maintenance of the track. Thus withdrawing a train
like the sleeper service on the West Highland Line saves almost nothing.
The danger of allowing accountants to share track costs between
individual trains, by dividing the annual maintenance bill by the number
of trains, is that it gives the false impression that money can be saved
by withdrawing individual services. Of course you only save the money
when the last service is withdrawn. Herein lies the real danger. As each
successive train is withdrawn, it appears that greater savings will be
made by withdrawing the next weakest service and so on.
The railways are to be organised in future with Railtrack owning the
line, the rolling stock leased out by separate companies, and the trains
run by a number of different passenger and freight enterprises, so that
what was formerly British Rail is now nearly 100 separate companies.
Each company has legal contracts with the others and each must pay a
price for the services it enjoys. In this highly complex relationship,
which will keep masses of lawyers and accountants busy, there have to be
transactions between the parties, often at allocated or average prices
which bear little relationship to the actual costs of running an
efficient service which is well tuned to the market it is supposed to
serve.
How do we break out of this nightmare which will pick off the weaker
railway services until we discover too late that, as in the day of Dr
Beeching, we have closed a lot of lines but saved relatively little
money? The clue is in the latest publication of the Rail Regulator.
Although it relates to access charges for freight train operators it
could apply equally to passenger trains like the West Highland sleeper.
The Regulator says, ''No user who is able to pay at least the direct
costs imposed on the network should be denied the opportunity of moving
traffic by rail rather than road.''
This could be interpreted to indicate that the charge for taking the
West Highland sleeping car train to Edinburgh to connect to and from the
main train between Inverness and London should not, as a minimum, exceed
the direct wear and tear costs on the track. These will be very low.
So what is needed now is a stay of execution for the West Highland
Line until October, by which time new, enthusiastic, Scottish-based
management, supported by the local tourist industry, should market the
service, improve in every way the efficiency of operation, bargain hard
for a realistic track user charge, and go back to the Franchise Director
with an offer he cannot refuse.
The West Highland Line must be made into a test case for the new
railway and establish a principle that the Regulator should refuse to
allow the closure or withdrawal of any railway service until the
opportunity of running this has been offered to anyone willing to take
it on and that any ''savings'' proposed are those which would genuinely
arise from any closure decision.

IN the manner he wished, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn was yesterday laid to
rest in the underground crypt in the grounds of Fordell Castle in Fife
-- in a service of celebration he scripted himself.
The 61-year-old Perth and Kinross MP, who died earlier this week, had
stipulated that his funeral service should be spectacular and
celebratory.
''Since I'm not coming back, I would like the event to be a
celebration. I want no nonsense about 'Death, where is thy sting?','' he
had told friends.
His wishes were duly granted, but in a master stroke which even Sir
Nicholas could not have orchestrated, the family's Irish wolfhounds set
up a mournful howl in kennels outside, first as the crypt bell tolled
and later as the piper played.
The coffin had laid in the castle's private chapel overnight resting
on the Saltire. Placed on its top were Sir Nicholas's spectacles, his
pocket diary, his military medals, a sporran and the feathered Glengarry
which was his hallmark.
There were few famous names or faces among the mourners for a service
restricted to family and close friends, which included Home Office
Minister Michael Forsyth and Tory MP Sir Nicholas Bonsor.
The mourners arrived to find the baron's flag flying at half mast, and
a lone piper playing My Ain Folk.
The piper later played Cock O' The North, the regimental march of the
Gordon Highlanders -- his former regiment -- as his coffin was carried
into the crypt of the seventeenth century chapel, with its bell pealing.
Mourners included his first wife, Elizabeth, and their three
daughters, and his second wife, Lady Sam, and her son from a previous
marriage.
The Rev David Ogston, minister of St John's Church in Perth, where a
memorial event will be held on March 3, conducted the service.
The Church of Scotland is plainly not an organisation to bear grudges:
when a Moderator of the General Assembly some years ago dared to
question the merits of Margaret Thatcher's policies he was denounced as
a ''Satanist'' by a furious Sir Nicholas.
The minister included readings from poets, including a verse from
Robert Burns, which fitted the bill perfectly:
''Tho' oft the prey of care and sorrow,
''When blest today, and mindful of tomorrow;
''A being formed to amuse his graver friends;
''Admired and praised -- and there the wages ends.''
Long-standing friend of the family Sir Ilay Campbell paid tribute,
stating that much of the controversy surrounding Sir Nicholas arose from
other people's conceptions of him.
He admitted that he was a man of ''complete directness, unfettered by
conventional platitudes''. He went on: ''Nicky was direct, often almost
brutally so. He saw clearly what he thought should be done or said, did
it and said it -- usually flamboyantly, and quite often in colourful
language.''
Throughout the service candles shone in the gloom of a wet morning and
the crypt, which Sir Nicholas restored and which contains memorial
plaques to two of his children who died in infancy, was decked with
flowers.
The death of Sir Nicholas has presented the Government with an
unwelcome by-election in his marginal constituency, now likely to be
held on April 6.

THERE are thrills and spills galore in Curtis Hanson's The River Wild
(12), a tale of whitewater rafting lent much-needed weight by the
presence of Meryl Streep as a young mother on a weekend trip down the
rapids with her young son, Joseph Mazzello.
They are abducted by a couple of villains on the run from the police
and are joined by her wimpish husband, David Strathairn, who turns up
unexpectedly.
Strathairn plays a workaholic, whose marriage is in difficulties, and
had originally chickened out on the ''let's get-a-way-from-it-all''
weekend -- a last-ditch attempt to repair the relationship.
Denis O'Neill's script is banal and the trip down this river of
no-return proceeds relentlessly along the tramlines of the thriller
genre.
But Streep and Strathairn make the couple credible, not just scream
and scream again figures, although the villains, Kevin Bacon and John C
Reilly, are stock figures. The nicer the smile, the nastier the man, in
Bacon's case, while Reilly gets to be the fat slob with a hint of heart.
But Hanson, who directed The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, has
redeployed the conventions of the old-dark-house thriller into the open
air.
The stunt work as the rubber rafts hurtle down the imaginary River
Wild -- a composite of several stretches of white-water -- is amazing.
One cannot tell where the stunt woman begins and Streep leaves off as
the rubber boat hurtles through some of the most spectacular scenery
Montana has to offer.
Streep and the subtle Strathairn give performances well beyond what
one usually gets in this kind of film.
But the film's real claim as entertainment rests on that breathtaking,
death-defying roller-coaster ride down the river.

AS YOUR editorial made clear (February 18) Chris Green's departure as
director of ScotRail throws into sharp focus the many unresolved
questions arising from the Government's mismanaged privatisation of
Scottish railways.
It is clear that Chris Green was driven to resign by the policies of a
Government which pays lip service to the notion of an improved railway
while slashing funding and introducing a management structure contrived
to inflate cost and cripple the industry.
It is to Chris Green's credit that he openly challenged these
policies; it is to the shame of the faceless executives at the British
Railways Board that they apparently sided with the Government rather
than with Mr Green.
The universal regret at Chris Green's departure illustrates the huge
reservoir of public support that can be tapped by a rail management
willing to stand up and fight its corner. What other head of a public
utility commands such goodwill?
If Chris Green's successor, John Ellis, is prepared to come out
fighting for ScotRail, he too will win widespread admiration. If, on the
other hand, he chooses simply to toe the Government's line, then his
return to Scotland will be a wasted journey.

A RADIO Scotland team is to provide Radio 1 with a weekly programme
for the first time, spearheading Scotland's record-breaking input to the
UK-wide BBC radio network in 1995-96.
Beginning in April, John Cavanagh will present a two-hour Sunday-night
rock show, produced by Stewart Cruickshank, from Glasgow's Queen
Margaret Drive.
BBC Radio Scotland will be providing 600 hours -- an increase of 150
hours -- of nationally networked programming across all five of the
BBC's stations.
Jimmie Macgregor, John Carmichael, and Fiona Ritchie head the list of
broadcasters presenting Scottish-made shows for Radio 2, which will also
be broadcasting a Bonnie Prince Charlie special, six ceilidhs, and a
series on the music hall in Scotland.
Radio 3 has taken 188 hours of programmes from Scotland in the form of
music, documentaries, and features, plus 15 hours for the station's
composer-of-the-week strand. There will also be a live broadcast of an
opera from Scottish Opera.
Radio 4 has bought a large range of prime-time drama, as well as
having commissioned The Herald's Ruth Wishart to present six Scottish
editions of Woman's Hour. Radio 5 Live has taken two Scottish series,
one on drugs and the other on science in sport.

TWO YOUTHS who walked free from the High Court in Glasgow last week
after a jury foreman allegedly read out the wrong verdicts could go on
trial again.
Moves have been made to bring a private prosecution against Derek
McDowall and Gerald Gilmartin, both 17, by a lawyer representing the two
men they were originally accused of attacking.
In the first step for a Bill for Criminal Letters Cameron Fyfe, of
Ross, Harper and Murphy, has written to the Crown Office asking if the
Lord Advocate is prepared to concur in the application.
Although Scots Law says that no-one can be tried twice for the same
offence if acquitted Mr Fyfe said he taken counsel's advice and because
of the circumstances of this case he believed it was possible.
He said his clients were extremely unhappy about what had happened:
''It appears that if the clerk of the court makes an error it can be
rectified but if the foreman makes an error it can not.
''I have discussed the matter with counsel and we feel that the most
appropriate way to proceed is by way of private prosecution.''
Mr Fyfe is representing Christopher Nugent, 23, and John Docherty 26.
Mr Nugent said: ''What happened is a great injustice, but the law is the
law. We do not hold out much hope of this succeeding unless we get
public opinion behind us. It is a short-term move rather than go to the
European Court, which we will do if necessary.''
The prospects of someone being tried twice for the same offence are
unlikely according to legal experts. David Sheldon, lecturer in private
law at Edinburgh University, said he would be ''surprised'' to see it
happen.
In a mistake, which it is claimed is unprecedented in Scots legal
history, not proven verdicts were returned by the jury foreman in the
trial of Derek McDowall and Gerald Gilmartin -- after the jury had
decided to find them guilty.
It was only after the jury foreman had repeated the verdict, it had
been recorded by the clerk of court, and the two teenagers had left the
court that it emerged that the wrong verdict had been given.
Startled jury members complained to court officials. However, the
judge Lord Cameron ruled the verdict had to stand as no dissent was
voiced by any members of the jury when asked by the clerk if the
decision was a true and accurate reflection.
Mr Gilmartin said last night that he had been acquitted by a jury and
did not see why he should go through the ordeal again.
''I didn't do it. So I wasn't surprised when the jury gave their
verdict. I felt terrible and I don't want to go through that again.''
Mr McDowall could not be contacted for comment.

Edward Heath had high hopes for the agreement signed in 1973, but they
were dashed six months later by a general strike in the province
HISTORY may not repeat itself but newspaper headlines have a habit of
doing so. Yesterday's billboards announcing peace in our time and
historical decisions echoed December 10, 1973, when The Herald led with
''Ireland deal a triumph for Heath''.
The ''historic step'', as it was described, was, of course, the
Sunningdale agreement brokered at the Civil Service College in Berkshire
during 55 hours of talks spread over four days between the British
Government, the government of the Republic, and a delegation from
Northern Ireland led by the Ulster Unionist leader Mr Brian Faulkner.
The agreement was that the north and south would co-operate on
economic and security matters through a new All-Ireland Council. The
executive functions to be devolved to this new council included farming,
tourism, electricity generation, roads, sport, and the arts. For its
part, the British Government was to restore to the new Northern Ireland
Executive, of which Mr Faulkner was chief executive, the powers taken
away when Stormont was suspended and direct rule from Westminster
imposed on Northern Ireland in 1972.
The Sunningdale agreement did not resolve two issues -- extradition by
Eire of IRA refugees hiding there and Dublin's desire for a common
police authority. But progress was made on both issues. The communique
said a joint commission would be set up by the two governments to study
proposals for changing the extradition law and, while joint policing was
being looked at, there would be co-operation between the two forces.
Mr Faulkner described the agreement as heralding a new dawn, not just
for Northern Ireland but the whole of Ireland. Anyone who tried to break
it would ''earn the disrespect of the whole world community'', he said
Mr Liam Cosgrave, the Irish Prime Minister, said the agreement had
been reached because the parties had not allowed themselves to be
intimidated by past prejudices. ''The proposals on which we have agreed
will work only if we all commit ourselves wholeheartedly to them as a
way of easing fears and resolving conflict in Ireland,'' he said. ''We
do so commit ourselves.''
Prime Minister Edward Heath, whose determination had kept the talks
going, said it was the first time the Irish government had recognised
Northern Ireland and it would have international status. The step was
historic and he believed it could ''mean a better future not only for
Northern Ireland, but for Ireland, north and south.'' Mr Francis Pym,
the new Northern Ireland Secretary, looked forward, in vain as it turned
out, to ''better and calmer days''.
The following year everything collapsed. It had been a false sunrise
in Sunningdale. What went wrong? Much the same as may go wrong this
time. The Ulster Unionists were outraged. The language then is the
language now.
The leader of the dissenting Unionists, Mr Harry West, said he would
start immediate moves to have Mr Faulkner dismissed as leader of the
Unionist Party. ''I think he is in big trouble,'' he said. ''His triumph
will be short lived.''
Professor Kennedy Lindsay, of the Vanguard Unionists, said the deal
was ''the most shocking betrayal since the Nazi massacre of the
surrendered Jews in Warsaw''. It could not, and would not, be accepted.
Following the agreement, Mr Faulkner secured endorsement on December
15 in the Northern Ireland Assembly by 43 votes to 27 when it rejected
an opposition attempt to have it overthrown. The debate lasted 18 hours
and the Rev Ian Paisley, dubbed ''the demon doctor'' by Mr Faulkner,
took up three hours and 18 minutes of the time. It seemed as if he was
safe.
The new power sharing executive took office in January 1974 and on
January 4 Mr Faulkner got a rude awakening. He found himself in trouble
with his own party which rejected the agreement by 454 votes to 374, a
majority of 80 for rejection. Three days later, he resigned as party
leader although he carried on as chief executive of the assembly. Dublin
pledged its support for the agreement. Mr Faulkner soldiered on with the
support of 18 Unionists in the assembly and the 19 members from the
Social Democratic and Labour Party.
In Dublin, a constitutional court cast doubt on the agreement, which
was interpreted as casting doubt on the Irish government's commitment to
it, and in Britain the political scene changed.
There was a General Election and Labour won. Mr Pym, who had taken
over just at the time of Sunningdale from Mr William Whitelaw as
Northern Ireland Secretary, was replaced by Labour's Mr Merlyn Rees. The
Northern Ireland policy was bi-partisan but the change did not improve
matters.
The election in Ulster was fought largely on Sunningdale and largely
on the fictitious version of the agreement put about by the Unionist
politicians. They claimed it was a covert means of creating a united
Ireland and they were believed. Meanwhile, the IRA was indulging its
terrorist tactics to the full, creating a massive sectarian backlash
against any moves to a settlement
On March 13, Labour reaffirmed the Sunningdale agreement but the
situation in Ulster simply got worse and Mr Faulkner's control of the
situation got weaker and weaker. On May 14, he secured the endorsement
of his partners in the executive for Sunningdale and his opponents
unleashed the weapon which was to destroy it. Mr James Patterson, of the
Ulster Workers Council, said electricity workers would cut power
supplies in protest at the agreement and that led on May 21 to a general
strike. It lasted for two weeks.
The UWC, led by Mr William Craig, of Vanguard, wanted a federal link
between Britain and Northern Ireland. He was backed by Mr Paisley,
Democratic Unionist, and Mr West, Official Unionist, and the 21 UWC
council, proceeded to lead a strike which devastated Ulster life.
On May 22, the executive decided to postpone implementation of any
executive powers to the new All Ireland Council proposed in Sunningdale
until after the next assembly elections in 1977-78. It was a concession
which did no good. Six days later, Mr Faulkner resigned as chief
executive, the rest of the executive resigned, and Sunningdale was dead.
It had actually been dead for some time. The fatal day was in February
when Mr Heath called his ''Who Runs Britain?'' General Election. The day
the campaign began he was seen in a Southport bar surrounded by a group
of happy Young Conservatives while at the other end of the room Mr
William Whitelaw, who had created the Sunningdale deal, stood looking
disconslate. He apparently told someone who joined him: ''This is going
to ruin things in Nothern Ireland.''
It gave the Ulster Protestants a platform from which to voice their
fears about and opposition to the agreement before it had been given a
chance to operate. The All Ireland Council was, in truth, a body of no
politial substance at all with powers hamstrung by the veto powers held
in Dublin and Belfast.
But the appearance was what counted, not the reality, and it was
presented as the work of the devil. Mr Faulkner's failure to keep
control of the Unionists also contributed to the disaster, as did the
intransigence of Mr Craig and Mr Paisley. Mr Faulkner quit after Mr Rees
refused to negotiate with the strikers. His Unionist supports in the
assembly had decided they could no longer support the all-party
executive if it did not negotiate. It was a request Mr Rees could not
agree to.
But if the politicians played their part in destroying Sunningdale, it
was the workers' strike, which had brought Ulster to a standstill, that
provided the coup de grace.
Mr West expressed satisfaction at its collapse and called for a period
of direct rule, while Mr Paisley claimed victory at this very good news.
Direct rule was reimposed and Northern Ireland went on to face two
decades in which the IRA terrorist activities and those of the Unionist
militants wreaked havoc on everyday life while the politicians laboured
in the search for a solution.
It was not until the December 1993 Downing Street Declaration that
they appeared to have found one.

As the frameworks for peace are unveiled, former Northern Ireland
Minister MICHAEL MATES, MP, applauds the bravery of the leaders who were
determined to see their work bear fruit,
WE can all feel relieved about one thing: the ''phoney war'' is over.
After all the leaks, lies, protestations, and threats of the last weeks,
the frameworks are out of the closet for all to see.
Naturally, everyone has been nervous. The record of successive
Governments has not been good. From Sunningdale in 1972, through the
Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, to the Downing Street Declaration 15
months ago, the prophets of doom have forecast failure -- and have
mostly been right.
Well-intentioned efforts to reconcile the irresistible force of Irish
nationalism with the immovable object of resolute unionism had little
chance of success in the turmoil of a Northern Ireland in the grip of
sectarian terrorism . . . until last year.
Now it can be seen that 1994 really was a watershed. The courage of
the two Prime Ministers, Major and Reynolds, in taking the huge leap of
offering Sinn Fein a seat at the table if it and the IRA permanently
eschewed violence as a political tool, left the terrorists no possible
further excuse for their killing.
It took these groups a further eight months to declare a ceasefire but
peace was an inevitable consequence of the boldness of that declaration.
Most importantly, Jim Molyneaux, leader of the majority of Unionists
and a much underrated political operator, gave the nod to the hitherto
unthinkable -- namely that he would sit and discuss Ulster's future with
any party who could prove they had renounced terror for good.
Paisley thundered that it would not bring peace -- and he was wrong
again. Meanwhile, the Official Unionists started to come to terms with
the consequence of all this: a much closer relationship with the dreaded
Republic.
Only when the publication of the framework was imminent did some lose
their nerve and revert to their time-honoured sabre rattling.
But if this was a great challenge to the tolerance of the Unionists,
the challenge to the two governments has been even greater.
Theirs has been the task to produce proposals that will meet some of
the aspirations of all of the parties, without going so far -- in either
direction -- as to bring the process to a halt or, worse still, give one
side the excuse to resume killing.
Their trump card has been peace. By this time last year more than 30
were dead in Ulster: more than 30 funerals in the two communities,
fuelling bitterness, hardening attitudes, and increasing desire for
blind revenge. This year no-one is dead.
It is against this background that both governments have taken risks
and, let it be said, the Irish have taken the greater risk. In promising
to repeal not only Article Three but, more importantly, Article Two of
their constitution, they have agreed to set aside the whole basis for
the birth of their nation -- that the whole of the Island of Ireland was
theirs as of right.
To set aside the assertion for which so many of their countrymen have
fought and died is brave indeed as a political act. It is also a smart
move, for that has been the running sore into which Unionists have
rubbed salt for the past 70 years.
There has been a price for this: North-South institutions in which the
Republic can share responsibility for some matters which can benefit
both countries. It was just such a concept (though with executive power)
upon which Sunningdale foundered: the All Ireland Forum.
The crucial tests of the entire initiative lies here. When all the
posturing has died down, are there sufficient safeguards against the
fears -- some real, some imagined, and some deliberately fermented --
that this is an inevitable step to a united Ireland? Such a concept is
still anathema to all the citizens of Northern Ireland and to most MPs.
I believe the safeguards are there.
John Major's declaration of unionism (shades of Ichbin ein Berliner)
and his rigorous insistence upon the 'triple lock' against any measures
which do not command consent should allay all reasonable fears.
There is a further important factor. Since the last attempt to
construct a formal cross-border body the European Union has come to
dominate much of the commercial and industrial life of both countries.
Ireland, as a small state, is a net beneficiary of the EU's largesse
and, for reasons of economic decline and geographical remoteness, so is
Northern Ireland. Both can benefit much more by cooperation, to say
nothing of the generous offers from the European Union and the USA of
many millions of pounds to reinforce the peace process and revive the
economies of both if peace can be sustained.
Much wrangling and horse trading lies ahead and there will be plenty
of set-backs. The only unforgivable reaction would be boycott, which
simply reverts to the sterility of the past 25 years.
Politicians owe it to their dead not to walk away from this challenge.
It is the ultimate sanction which gives them the obligation to try.
At the end of it all, in a referendum, Ulster can still say no.

As a new dance season begins, funding uncertainty shakes the Tramway,
Mary Brennan speaks to the man in charge
EARLIER this month Mr Tramway -- as some folk used to call Neil
Wallace -- left town. His new career directions are in independent
production, his new base is in Amsterdam.
Meanwhile, the venue he bonded with so fiercely -- the venue which for
many remains synonymous with Glasgow's 1990 year as European City of
Culture -- gazes out on Albert Drive through a recently glazed frontage.
The lights are on, but is anyone there?
At the recent press launch for New Moves Across Europe -- the
independent dance season coming into the Tramway during March -- awkward
questions were asked about the cost of the space, given that the
festival itself is this year working on a reduced budget. Nikki Milican
and Jill Scott (who are New Moves Ltd) had to admit that they were still
waiting for final figures to come their way . . . suddenly the awkward
questions were not about their cash flow but about the Tramway's
management.
None the less, Bob Palmer looks smiling and relaxed when we meet to
talk about the Tramway's future. Is it whither or whether? He has heard
all the rumours and he has an upbeat package of positive answers and
bushy-tailed maybes. He also has a distinctly unsentimental approach to
the ebb and flow of buildings. Sometimes, he reckons, a building can
outlive its usefulness. Maybe one day the Tramway's doors will close but
not, so he assures me, just yet.
As Glasgow's Director of Performing Arts, Bob Palmer heads a
department that combines responsibility for the city's artistic policies
alongside the janitorial care of its many council-owned venues.
When he talks of new developments at the Tramway, he's as likely to
discuss the state of the ancient heating system as he is the possibility
of the Maly Theatre's Lev Dodin coming in as guest producer of a future
season. But then, as he will point out, it is difficult to divorce the
fabric of the Tramway as a building from its role as a creative space
for artists.
It was, after all, the special rawness of the place that caught Peter
Brooks's imagination back in the late eighties when Neil Wallace snared
The Mahabharata's only British showing for Glasgow. By the end of 1990,
the Tramway had acquired the same talismanic quality as the Assembly
Hall in relation to the Edinburgh Festival. The Tramway was equated with
high profile international work and was seen as the call-sign for a city
that had re-energised its image through arts and culture.
But it's five years on from 1990, and Bob Palmer is briskly
identifying areas where change is needed, and indeed inevitable. ''The
Tramway . . . was only being utilised on 100 or so nights in a year and
so we saw it as important to diversify its uses. And yes, it was a
mini-dilemma -- would we compromise the identity of Tramway by extending
its programme?''
Market research into the Tramway audiences resolved that issue, though
it surprised Palmer and his team. ''We had assumed there was a Tramway
audience who moved from event to event, regardless of the art form.
There wasn't. There was a hard core who go to everything. But by and
large, attendance was driven by the art form, or by it being an
international or a local event, or by a specific company.''
This encouraged him to go forward with a plan completely reorganising
the city-wide management and programming structure within venues.''
Instead of having specific people rooted to one theatre or hall, with
overall responsibility for everything, the system would be restructured
''on functional grounds''.
A programming team will match product to venue in a bid to maximise
resources and audiences.
Two of the team are already in place: Billy Differ, who was manager at
the King's, and Charles Esche, formerly visual arts officer at the
Tramway.
The others should be appointed in the course of this month, says
Palmer, and his department will also recruit people ''who can get
excited about property management, sponsorship, front of house. People
who want to concentrate on that and not hanker to programme events as
well.''
What can be said is that Tramway's future includes forging ''cogent
links with the local community, the large Asian community in the area.
There's a possibility of Sunday afternoon showings of Asian films. Maybe
even looking at the food offered in the cafe -- doing something to
reflect that local culture.''
International links will be maintained. ''We are talking with Peter
Brooks about his new show, Purcarete's Tempest is happening in the
autumn. But we also want it as a local resource, offered to local
companies to rehearse at length, developing work that needs that kind of
space.''
An autumn season exploring sexuality also seems certain to cause
controversy.
Monies are being chased from the National Lottery to upgrade those
parts of the building that audiences so far have not been allowed to
reach. There is much talk about the Tramway becoming artist-centred, and
of some exploration the virtual possibilities of new technology.
Palmer and his team are obviously excited by these future dreams --
the Tramway as the Southside Cyber Cafe? or maybe a community arts
centre? Or a focus for circus events during Mayfest? -- but after a
while it becomes obvious that the Tramway has a plethora of futures but
not necessarily a destiny.

IN Flesh and Bone (15), written and directed by Steve Kloves, whose
last film was The Fabulous Baker Boys, Meg Ryan makes a valiant attempt
to play against type as a down and out bar room floozie on the run in
Texas from a disastrous marriage. She flunks it in the end, allowing her
natural tweetie-pie cuteness to surface, but it is good to see her
trying something beyond her normal range.
The film is about three losers, Arlis Sweeney (Dennis Quaid), who, as
a child used to help his father Roy (James Caan) rob lonely Prairie
farmhouses.
The film opens with a robbery which ends in murder, and then moves on
to what has become of the adult Arlis after he picks up
Kay (Ryan) in a bar where she has erupted from a cake and vomited all
over the celebratory party.
The relationship between these two damaged people gradually flowers
until Roy comes back into their lives, as does the past. Caan is
splendidly creepy as the murderous patriarch, Quaid comes with with a
nicely etched performance as a man trying to forget the evil of his past
and Ryan is touching as the broad with a history.
The Middle West farmlands, finely photographed by Philippe Rousselot,
provide the right sense of decay.
The coincidence which ends the tale is a bit hard to swallow, perhaps,
and Kloves treatment is a shade slow, but the result is well worth
seeing.

The already notorious Natural Born Killers is out on general release,
despite claims that its gratuitous violence has spawned copy-cat
killings, and glorifies the very behaviour the film seeks to lampoon.
William Russell endured the carnage to consider the merits of film-maker
Oliver Stone's latest critique of Motel America
OLIVER Stone makes fashionable films. Whether they will endure only
time can tell. There is something faded already about the likes of
Platoon, Talk Radio, Born on the Fourth of July, The Doors or Wall
Street. But they were all topical, and made, at the very least, most
efficiently.
Stone, who has been all over the place this week promoting his latest
film, Natural Born Killers (18), believes it will be seen, come 2030, as
having caught the mood of the 1990s. He claims it is a portrait of a
homicidal society bound for hell.
Maybe it will endure. Maybe it will be seen for what it is, a
brilliantly made piece of trash, exploiting an astonishing range of
cinematic techniques to create a highly-effective psychedelic
experience. The film has a message to deliver about the way the news
media's insatiable desire for better ratings and increased circulation
corrupts journalists and, in the end, corrupts society.
The film was due to be released here last November, but fell foul of
the censor. Parliament was debating violence at the time and because it
had been wrongly linked with alleged copy-cat killings in the United
States, the censor played safe, and the media and politicians attacked
something they had not seen. As a result Stone must sell the film all
over again.
He proves a master of double-think. He excoriates the television media
in the film, yet never admits that as a film-maker he is also part of
the media, that he too has responsibilties to the society in which he
lives and to which this sort of film could be as damaging as the media
he attacks. One American reviewer summed the film up in these terms. It
was like those old Biblical epics in which one got 20 minutes of orgy
followed by 30 seconds of moralising about the wickedness of it all.
It is too much to condemn the film as evil, but for all the brilliance
shown in telling his story of two young mass murderers, Mickey and
Mallory, played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, as they rampage
through the barren wastes of Motel America, Stone cannot conceal that
the sound and fury is self-indulgent and his message about the news
media's abuse of its power is a very small mouse for such elephantine
labourings to produce.
The film, a visceral, not a cerebral experience, is not the most
violent ever made. There are 52 slayings, at a rough count, there are
more in the average Stallone/Schwarzenegger thriller, and nobody
complains about those. Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the original script,
has disowned the result rewritten by Stone.
Tarantino said Stone had shifted the balance from the character of the
television reporter (Robert Downey Jr, in splendidly stomach-churning
form as a sleaze-bag of the first order), who fronts a TV schlock-horror
programme on violent crime, to Mickey and Malory. But Stone proves
unable to decide whether they are ''natural born killers'' because it is
in their genes, or killers because they are both products of horrendous
family backgrounds -- a crucial flaw in the film's argument.
The parodies of television sitcoms in which canned laughter greets the
most horrific disclosures, the use of cartoons to illustrate the
violence, and the switching between colour and black and white
photography to show the romantic and the realistic view of life as lived
by the couple -- a highly effective way of conveying the real and the
skewwhiff worlds -- are technically accomplished.
Stone is a natural born film-maker, but not a natural born
intellectual; as this lurid, audacious, powerful and hysterical film
demonstrates, Stone is a natural born comic-book reader.

*CONGRATULATIONS to Tom Courtney who yesterday emulated Paul Weller's
Brits awards non-appearance when he won the London Evening Standard's
best actor accolade for his performance in Moscow Stations. Courtney's
rivetting one-man show began at the Traverse in 1993 and was revived to
huge acclaim at last year's Edinburgh Fringe.
Another Scot, actor John Gordon Sinclair, was also on the award list
for his role in the musical She Loves Me.
Diceman passeth away
* IRELAND has been mourning the death at 42 of one of Dublin's most
colourful characters, Glasgow-born Thom McGinty. Known as Diceman after
the Grafton Street shop where he first performed his street mime act, he
became an all-island celebrity after revealing that he was HIV positive
on Gaye Byrne's Late Late Show on television in November.
Thom McGinty had studied accountancy at Strathclyde University before
becoming a stalwart of Strathclyde Theatre Group and working as a model
at Glasgow School of Art. He left for Ireland in 1976 and developed his
''stillness'' act in Dublin in response to the city's vagrancy laws,
moving the minimum required distance in the maximum possible time.
His manager Aidan Murphy said: ''He had a flamboyant ability to go out
on the street and engage people by doing very little.''His popularity
led to legitimate stage roles, including a part in Steven Berkoff's
production of Salome for the Gate Theatre in Dublin.
When his illness was made known, a benefit was organised for him and
his appearance on television and interviews in the Irish press focussed
public debate on Aids in condom-free Ireland. Mr Ian McKellen -- who
will be addressing such issues when his A Knight Out show plays the Citz
on Sunday -- please note.
Moot point for 1999
* ONE WAY or another, the focus of Glasgow's year as City of
Architecture and Design in 1999 and its Millenium celebrations are
likely to focus on the construction of a tower as a new landmark.
Glasgow Development Agency held a competition for a design for just such
a thing, before 1999 was even thought out. The sail-like winner by
Richard Horden was planned for St Enoch's Square before migrating
conceptually south of the river.
Then council leader Pat Lally got behind the idea of a reconstruction
of Tait's Tower from the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Bellahouston Park.
Architect Ian Ritchie is working on the plan. The council and the agency
(partners in the 1999 bid) at loggerheads? Seems not. The weekly
Building Design -- which sponsored the 1992 competition -- reports that
the GDA now says it will back Tait's tower over its own scheme if it has
to choose. Building Design seems to be taking this very well, but Horden
is reportedly not at chuffed.

THE name is a tease, and a large audience queued up to be teased by
it. This was not in the normal sense an octet of violins, nor even an
octet of new violins. It did not play Orcadian fiddle music. It looked
from the distance like any other mixed string ensemble, but when you
moved closer you realised that all was not what it seemed.
The instruments were of eccentric size. The viola, even by viola
standards, looked unusually cumbersome. The cello was a bit on the small
side. The double bass seemed not quite a double bass. This was, indeed,
the New Violin Octet, an example of Anglo-American (and now also
Scottish) enterprise, each instrument a different size, from a treble
and a soprano violin down to a small bass violin and a contrabass
violin.
What the group lacks, so far, is a repertoire. A performance of
Mendelssohn's octet would not be feasible.
Jacob's Aphorisms, nine pieces with funny titles, represented what
could be called the English eccentric side of the programme, with
squeaks from the treble violin and deep, rich resonances from the
contrabass.
Cresswell's inventions -- seven more aphorisms -- seemed more in touch
with reality, in that they showed how an alert modern composer, with all
the latest techniques at his fingertips, could strike his own sort of
sparks from such an odd assembly of instruments. Finally, Harper's
Chanson Minimale mixed humour with nostalgia in the Brittenish tributed
to Elgar's Schanson de Matin.

The close relationship between two very different politicians has been
a major factor in the success of the peace talks. Sir Patrick Mayhew and
Dick Spring make an interesting combination.
AWAY from the glare of the television lights which dominate the
landmark moments of the Irish peace process, the close relationship
forged between two men has ensured the smooth progress of the day-to-day
negotiations behind the scenes.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring are unlikely soul-mates. Sir Patrick is the sort of
bluff, plummy gentleman now rare in the Tory party. Mr Spring is a
former Ireland rugby international who has transformed the Irish Labour
party.
But the peace process has brought them together. It is they who have
produced the results announced yesterday by their respective Prime
Ministers. They have supervised the detailed talks and provided the
encouragement which has driven the teams of civil servants negotiating
the framework document.
The personal relationship that has evolved between them is close
enough for them to be able to lunch together in a private room at the
Garrick Club in London. Each has been known to accuse the other, in
jest, of behaving like an Irishman.
For Sir Patrick, the label refers to his Anglo-Irish ancestry. His
mother's family settled in Ireland in the thirteenth century and
remained at the family seat in County Cork until Sir Patrick's
great-grandfather lost everything betting on a greyhound.
The house has since been levelled, but Sir Patrick, 64, has remained
close to Ireland. He had been lobbying for the unpopular Northern
Ireland job for years before Mr Major sent him there after the General
Election in 1992.
Educated at Tonbridge and Balliol, with a stint in the Royal Dragoon
Guards, Sir Patrick entered Parliament in 1974. His first Government
post came in 1979 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher foisted him on Employment
Secretary Jim Prior with the words ''I'm determined to have someone with
backbone in your department''. At 6ft 4in, Sir Patrick has a long
backbone.
He was Attorney General before Mr Major made him Northern Ireland
Secretary. His appointment caused worries in Dublin because of his known
Unionist sympathies. But his commitment to the peace process and, in
particular, his recent declaration that he does not oppose the idea of a
united Ireland if it turns out to be the will of the majority has
reassured the nationalist side.
Throughout the negotiations, he has also benefited from his close
relationship with the Prime Minister. It has strengthened his hand in
dealing with both unionist and nationalist politicians, who have
expressed admiration for his determination to seek solutions acceptable
to both sides.
His understanding of the province, however, has occasionally been
questioned. When his civil servants once urged him to recognise the
growing sense of alienation among Protestants, Sir Patrick dismissed
this as nonsense. He had gone walkabout in east Belfast, he said, and
asked about 40 people he met if they felt alienated. All but one had
replied: ''No, Sir Patrick''.
Mr Spring, 44, is the only member of the Irish Government who was in
power at the time of the Anglo-Irish agreement in 1985. His meteoric
rise to the leadership of the Labour party has left him as one of the
key figures in Irish politics.
In the 1970s, he played at scrum-half for Ireland. Tall, with
moustache and round spectacles, his sometimes vague manner has been
described as reminiscent of the languid pose of James Joyce. He was
educated at Trinity and worked as a barman in New York where he met his
wife.
He inherited his republican North Kerry constituency from his father.
Mr Spring is renowned for his ambition and his desire to be the man who
reconciles Ireland's unionist and nationalist traditions.
He became Labour leader in 1982. He was central to the election of his
fellow Labour politician, Mrs Mary Robinson, as President of Ireland in
1990. She has actively sought out contacts in Northern Ireland and is
credited with easing some of the mistrust between Dublin and the
Unionists.
Mr Spring's tenure as Irish Foreign Minister began in the coalition
government of Mr Albert Reynolds, formed following the 1992 election.
When that collapsed last year after Mr Spring and his party withdrew
their support, he turned to Fine Gael leader Mr John Bruton.

DAVID Glass announces: ''Ah, you're early!'' as I stand on the
doorstep of his Highbury studio, thrusting forth a bunch of red tulips
as an apology for being late.
Immersed in rehearsals for his forthcoming solo show Lucky, which
explores the inner world of an autistic boy, he hadn't noticed the
passing time.
Even in repose Glass's movements are fluent; the twitching nose, the
windmilling hands, the animated facial expressions, perhaps a testimony
to his years of training in physical theatre.
Glass is one of the principal exponents of this form in the UK and has
received the kind of international acclaim which means that his plays
frequently tour abroad.
Since 1978 he has created 12 solo shows as well as writing, directing
and devising over 30 original works for theatre, dance and opera
companies.
In 1988 he launched the David Glass Ensemble which has produced Popeye
in Exile, Bozo's Dead, Les Enfants du Paradis and Gormenghast, for which
Glass won the Martini/TMA Director of the Year award last year. Lucky
tours nationally in the spring, with extensive Scottish dates in late
April and the ensemble are currently touring another show, of
contrasting tone, The Mosquito Coast.
The Mosquito Coast is a narrative-driven tale adapted by John
Churchill from Paul Theroux's novel about Allie Fox, the inventor and
visionary who takes his family from America's consumer society to the
supposed idyll of a Honduran jungle.
Glass, who directed the piece and continues to drop in on it as it
tours, is mindful of the proliferation of adaptations but is eloquent
defensive. ''The problem is that people don't want to see new plays and
they're staying away. It's a great shame but you have to do something
about it.
''We want to do innovative new works and one solution is to take a
well-known book and do something exciting with the form. Why not?
Anything can be a source of theatre.''
''The Mosquito Coast is just a wonderful story, with a great twist.
Normally the enemy is from without but with Allie the enemy is within.
The first half is all action, with amazing images and a huge waterfall
on stage but the second half is very dark and violent.''
Glass suspects that the eighties' preoccupation with political plays
turned young people off the theatre and he wants to inject excitment
back into the experience. While The Mosquito Coast is full of ''worthy''
themes such as ecological destruction, they are couched in entertaining
ways, in the action and adventure genre.
''It think it is a shame when theatre becomes too intellectually
based, although I do think that the theatre of ideas is important but
theatre should be about spectacle,'' he says. The attention to nuance in
The Mosquito Coast is such that the eight strong cast all trained in
Capoeira, a Brazilian martial art which Glass encountered on various
tours of the country, and which informs the performances.
''It gives them enormous physicality and also a sense of the way
someone from another part of the world actually moves, such as a low
centre of gravity and watching each other's eyes all the time,'' he
explains.
Next up for the David Glass Ensemble is a big project, a musical
theatre piece based on Fellini's movie La Dolce Vita, which  various
Scottish theatres, including the Citizens', are interested in
co-producing. ''It would be perfect at the Citizens','' smiles Glass;
''something sexy and fun, with lots of shouting and dancing and cool
clothes.''

AFTER almost 25 years of killings and hatred, the last 15 months have
provided a series of more hopeful landmarks which culminated in
yesterday's agreement writes CALUM MACDONALD.
With hindsight, it is now clear that secret discussions were going on
for some years. But given the history of failed peace initiatives in
Northern Ireland, it is no surprise that the talking was done well away
from the limelight.
The time came, though, when the progress of the delicate negotiations
had to be made public:
December 15, 1993: The Downing Street Declaration is unveiled by Mr
John Major and Irish premier Albert Reynolds. It includes a commitment
that the future of Northern Ireland will depend on the wishes of its
people, and an insistence that the IRA shall give a permanent
renunciation of violence before any talks. Sinn Fein president Gerry
Adams responds with a plea for clarification.
May 19, 1994: Six months later, the Government's ''clarification''
offers a referendum in Northern Ireland, if a united Ireland is proposed
during the peace process, and Sinn Fein is promised a place at the peace
talks after three months of permanent ceasefire.
August 31: Sinn Fein had rejected the declaration in July, but within
five weeks the IRA announces a ''complete cessation'' of violence.
September 6: Mr Adams becomes the first Sinn Fein leader to meet an
Irish Prime Minister. Together with Mr Reynolds in Dublin, he pledges
commitment to a ''democratic and peaceful'' solution. In London on the
same day, Mr Major walks out on the Rev Ian Paisley, the leader of the
Democratic Unionist Party, after he refuses to accept the Prime
Minister's assurance that there has been no secret deal with the IRA.
September 16: With the pace of peace quickening, Mr Major lifts the
broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern
Ireland Secretary, announces the reopening of 10 border crossings.
October 13: The Combined Loyalist Military Command, including the
Ulster Freedom Fighters, the Ulster Volunteer Force, and the Red Hand
Commandos, announces a universal ceasefire.
October 21: Mr Major proposes exploratory talks with Sinn Fein before
the end of the year, and lifts the exclusion orders on Mr Adams and his
deputy, Mr Martin McGuinness, which had prevented them entering the
British mainland.
November 1: In a gesture which has enormous symbolic force, the
security gates are opened on the Belfast peace line which separates the
Protestant Shankill area from the Catholic Springfield district.
November 13: Mr Reynolds is forced to resign after a political
controversy over his appointment of a senior member of the Irish
judiciary. But Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Foreign Minister and a key
figure in the negotiations, remains and the peace process continues,
with Mr John Bruton elected as the new Irish premier.
January 15 1995: Another sign of development as British troops stop
daytime patrols in Belfast.
February 22: Amid continued criticism from the Ulster Unionists, Mr
Major and Mr Bruton unveil the framework document in Belfast.

NICKY Fairbairn remained politically incorrect to the end. We hear of
his recent refusal to let the local council instal a reed bed on his
land in an experimental effort to clean up unsightly and toxic red water
bubbling up from old mine workings.
This was a major ecological hazard blighting Fife's rivers and a
growing threat to local aquatic beasties and plant life, according to
the Forth River Purification Board. But Sir Nicky was not for it. The
reed bed might affect his ornamental fountains. And what's more, he
thought the rusty red spume was really quite pretty, in an
environmentally unfriendly sort of way.
* Graham Whyte of Cumbernauld has been on the fax to say that an ideal
way to honour Sir Nicky would be to have his surname introduced into the
language. He suggests a fairbairn could be another word for a devil's
advocate or even a synonym for Auld Nick himself.
A fairbairn could be a frank, blunt, and amusing but ultimately
irrelevant intervention in a parliamentary debate. A fairbairn might be
a leader of fashion with all the colour co-ordination of a tube of
Smarties.
We welcome your suggestion for appropriate definitions of a fairbairn.
We were going to offer a bottle of malt whisky as a prize for the best
entry but, having read Sir Nicky's death certificate, have had second
thoughts.
The winner will receive the magnificent cash sum of #25 which should
go towards buying shoes for the weans.
Struck dumb
THE BBC has invaded Brussels for a week of Euro-style programmes. BBC
Scotland's contribution is a debate on the Gaelic programme Eorpa
presented by John Morrison.
This involved earnest discussion by non-British Europeans who had
learned Gaelic. One of the talking heads was a German, Christian
Stroemstoerfer who turned out to be a real whizz on such Euro-esoterics
as the Committee of the Regions, variable geometry, and the Maastricht
convergence criteria.
All went terribly well until conversation had to be made with
technicians employing that other European Union official language,
English. Mr Stroemstoerfer couldn't speak a word of it. Now that's
Euro-regionalism.
Danger signs
THE view of The Diary is that there are too many bloody festivals
about these days. And too much folk singing.
Thus we welcome and recommend to you, the Ancient Kingdom of Dalriada
Festival, which is a new event entirely devoted to folk music. Dalriada,
as you probably already know, was an ancient land which stretched from
Argyll across to what we now call Northern Ireland.
''In the thousand or so years since Dalriada disappeared, the peoples
of South-west Scotland and North-east Ireland have shared in each
other's fortunes through war and peace and in all that time the music
and culture of both countries have intermingled, merged, and fused,'' it
says here in the PR stuff for the festival.
What caught The Diary's eye, actually, was the reference to the
floating festival club. For four days during the Dalriadafest in May, a
chartered CalMac ferry will be on a permanent voyage between Wemyss Bay,
Campbeltown, Ballycastle, and back again, and back again, and again.
The usual suspects in hairy jerseys will be doing the music, although
there will be an appearance by John Gator and the Bourtreehillbillies,
Cajun musicians frae Irvine. In addition to the music, there will be
re-enactments of sundry battles by the Clan Wallace and some Vikings
from Shetland. Efforts are being made to find a set of Irish historical
fighters but this seems unlikely as the country is more into peace these
days.
A word of warning, the festival is being organised by a company called
Danger Inc.
Heading for confusion
FURTHER to the intriguing messages to be found on till receipts at
John Menzies shops. A customer purchasing a lottery ticket in the
Paisley John Menzies was given a receipt with the words ''Mills and
Boon'' beside his #1 investment. Did they think his chances of winning
the National Lottery were in the Mills and Boon category, he asked. No.
Rather than create a new heading to signify the sale of lottery tickets
on till receipts, they simply put them under Mills and Boon.
Last resort
FIFE Life: For one of their fun nights, Caesar's night club in
Kirkcaldy have adapted the format of the popular TV show Don't Forget
Your Toothbrush. The Kirkcaldy version is called Don't Forget Your
Toilet Brush and offers holidays in ''Corfu or Cardenden, Majorca or
Methil, Kinghorn or Kos''.
Odd man in
WE hear of a news conference at which the manager of Albion Rovers FC
announced that the club had broken the bank to sign three new players
for a total of #5000. ''The players are Klinsman, Laudrup, and McStay,''
the manager announced. What, Jurgen Klinsman from Spurs, he was asked.
No, Bert Klinsman from Dusseldorf Amateurs, he replies. Brian Laudrup of
Rangers? No Jimmy Laudrup of Copenhagen Harp. ''Paul McStay of Celtic?''
is the final question. ''Of course,'' he answers.
* You will not be surprised to learn that the above eating
establishment is to be found in deepest Ayrshire, Crosshill to be exact.
Thursday's speciality leaves only one question to be asked: ''How would
you like your pensioner done, sir?''

SPACE tight tonight; and for the biggest instrumental recital of the
year. Hey ho. So let's be brief. In the six years since his sensational
debut at the Edinburgh Festival, I have heard nothing played by Leif Ove
Andsnes, the young Norwegian pianist, that has changed my original
impression: here is one of tomorrow's great pianists.
And tomorrow draws ever closer. In a complex and varied recital last
night, every note Andsnes played was marked by conviction; and some of
them were stamped with mastery. His control of subtle variations in
light and shade characterised his Haydn and Neilsen. His command of the
telling phrase in Janacek's In the Mists was heartbreaking.
His absolute strength -- and, I feel, one of the hallmarks of his
coming greatness -- is the pristine pianism he demonstrated in the
romantic masterworks by Liszt and Rachmaninov in the second half of this
memorable recital. Such is Andsnes's consummate command of the different
registers of the keyboard, and their sonorities, that he can produce
levels of articulation that are astonishing. No less.
In Liszt, especially in a world-class performance of the Second
Ballade, it represented the antithesis of splashy pianism. In
Rachmaninov's Etudes Tableaux, the usual clouds of sound were swept
away.
Bring him back. Soon. And will somebody book him for a concerto
performance: he does a stunning Brahms One.

WHAT was unsayable yesterday can be said today. The only difference
between Scotland and the north of Ireland that matters to a Westminster
government is spilled blood.
We are not supposed to talk this way. It sounds parochial, obscene,
even an incitement to terrorism. That isn't the point. Whatever Ulster's
Unionists believe, the joint framework document is an offer of
devolution, a sworn guarantee of self-determination, the promise of a
referendum, and a pledge by London to amend constitutional legislation
to accommodate, in perpetuity, the will of the majority. Placid Scotland
is offered none of these things.
John Major is, in this, shameless. In Belfast he is the very model of
a devolutionist, nothing less, for that is the price of peace. He will
let the people decide, for that is the price of peace. He promises to
protect ''specified civil, political, social, and cultural rights'', for
that is the price of peace. He will even amend a constitution that he
has elsewhere declared beyond improvement because any price is worth
paying for peace.
He offers the north of Ireland everything Scotland wants in order to
secure the one thing Scotland doesn't need. There is no violence in
Scottish politics and, beyond the theological disputations of the
political priesthood, a unanimity striking in the modern world,
unthinkable in Ireland. It counts for nothing.
After 25 years and 3200 corpses, no-one with half a wit should blame
the Prime Minister. If he can turn the Irish framework document into a
lasting settlement he will deserve all the honours the Swedish Academy
can contrive.
Yet where is the framework document for Scotland? Where is the
high-flown prose, the Prime Minister who says ''these are our ideas but
the future is up to you'', the enormous effort to arrive at political
justice, the willingness to listen?
Labour, meanwhile, picks its patient way through the minefield,
determined to go far enough, terrified of going too far. The SNP, too,
slogs on, fighting civilised argument with civilised argument,
persuading and debating, playing the constitutional game because the
Scottish people would have it no other way. Does anyone really think we
are getting anywhere? We should be under no illusions. For the best of
motives, the Six Counties are being offered full-blown devolution with
what amounts to a guarantee of entrenchment.
Cynically, you could derive from that fact the suspicion there is, for
Westminster, nothing to choose between Scotland and the north of Ireland
save that the Irish kill and the Scots don't. This is, needless to say,
a lethal perception to let loose in the world.
Politically, however, the real point is to confront Major with the
contradictions of his position. By his account devolution for Scotland
is the single most dangerous proposition set before the British people.
Yet devolution for the north of Ireland is simultaneously judged
necessary and desirable.
Major will say Ireland is different. Given that they have few things
better to do, Scottish politicians must now find the nerve to ask him
just what he means. Is democracy not worth achieving without the threat
of violence? Does it take a bloodbath to make the case for a referendum?
He cannot, given everything he has said and done, believe such things.
Therefore, inescapably, Scotland's claim stands on its own merits, the
equal, as a democratic issue, of Ireland's. Major cannot plausibly
assert otherwise. The British Government, he said yesterday, intends to
''enshrine its willingness to accept the will of a majority of the
people of Northern Ireland in British constitutional legislation''.These
are fine words, and we may take them as binding.
Major has thus set the precedent long sought by the movement for
Scottish home rule. He has done so because of the unique circumstances
of Northern Ireland, yet even if his initiative fails its relevance for
Scotland remains.
If, on the other hand, the framework document succeeds, if Ireland
finds peace through devolution, the Labour Party will be vindicated.
Come that day we should hear no more of West Lothian questions, extra
layers of government, or the economic cost of reform. No-one, talking of
Northern Ireland, is mentioning them now.
The SNP, meanwhile, may take note of the single most important
concession Major has made. The framework document asserts that British
law will be changed to recognise the right of the people to decide their
future. Popular sovereignty, the cornerstone of the Scottish
constitutional tradition, is at last being recognised by London.
Having answered Ireland's question, can Major now evade Scotland's
claim?

IT'S not just my imagination, there are more young men than women out
of work, particularly among graduates, despite the fact that many have
qualifications in supposedly scarce subjects such as mathematics,
engineering, and computing. Women appear to be much more successful in
finding work even if it is well below the level for which they are
qualified. This is not a new phenomenon. For some time the rate of
growth of female employment has outstripped that of men.
According to the Labour Force Survey, published each quarter by the
Department of Employment, the number of women in work has increased by
1.3 million over the past 10 years. This contrasts with a broadly
constant number of men in work during the same period. In Scotland the
number of women in employment now exceeds the number of men by around
one third and most forecasters expect this to be true nationwide by the
end of the century.
So why are women faring so much better than men in the jobs market of
the 90s? To begin with this is not a new development. Over the past 15
years the economic activity rate for women of working age -- the
proportion of women aged 16-59 in work or looking for work -- has risen
from 63% in spring 1979 to 71% in spring 1994. During this period the
activity rate for men has fallen from 91% to 85%. However there remains
a substantial, although narrowing, gap in earnings between males and
females.
Some might argue that the data provides evidence of women stealing
men's jobs but this is incorrect. At the heart of these trends are
profound changes in the nature and type of work. A major reason for this
change has been the decline since the 1970s in the number of jobs
requiring physical strength.
Many of the long-term growth areas, both in the private and public
sectors, rely on caring skills and the ability to cope well in
face-to-face situations. Employers believe these attributes to be more
prevalent in women. Figures for 1993 show that more than two-thirds of
women of working age were engaged in non-manual occupations, compared
with just over one half of men of working age. The great majority of
women, 83%, work in service industries compared with 56% of men.
In addition, traditional forms of working which are declining in the
UK are being replaced with part-time and temporary work and self
employment. Women's self employment is now growing steadily. There are
now about 750,000 self-employed women in the UK, and rising numbers
starting their own businesses, mirroring US trends.
The occupations in which most women work, including
clerical/secretarial, personal services such as nursing/care assistants,
childcare, catering, and sales occupations, are also those containing
the greatest numbers of part-time workers. Many women employed in these
fields hold down more than one job.
Working-time flexibility has also grown and with it the number of
people doing job shares and working from home aided by information
technology such as modems, faxes, and personal computers. The numbers
involved are surprisingly high and reflect the attractions to many
women, particularly those with young children, of this form of work.
The Labour Force Survey shows that about 9.7 million people, roughly
38% of all UK workers, were either part-time, temporary, self-employed,
on a Government training scheme, or unpaid family workers in spring 1993
-- an increase of 1.25 million since 1986.
A survey of long-term employment strategies by the Institute of
Mangagement and Manpower in 1993 showed that around 80% of large
companies already employ temporary or part-time workers, 65% contract
out work and 60% use flexible working patterns. By 1997 over
three-quarters of large companies expect the use of flexible working
among permanent staff to increase.
In addition, three-quarters predict an increase in the contracting out
of work and two-thirds say they will use more temporary workers to
supplement the existing workforce. However in this environment there is
a danger that unscrupulous employers will take advantage of labour
market flexibility to erode employee terms and conditions.
The workplace of the 90s is an increasingly hostile environment for
those with inflexible attitudes. Hierarchies are dissolving as
organisations de-layer management structures to become leaner and
meaner. Charles Handy, visiting professor at London Business School, who
has chronicled many of these corporate changes, believes they represent
a major opportunity for women.
The qualities needed to prosper in today's jobs market, such as
flexibility and ability to work as a team, are different to those of the
past. Women have always had to adopt a flexible attitude to work given
that in the main they have had to balance the competing demands of
running a home, raising a family, and employment. Unless and until there
is a marked change in the attitude of many men, they will increasingly
lose out to female counterparts in the jobs market.
Psychologically it is difficult for many, particularly male middle
managers fearful of their eroding power base, to come to terms with
these changes. While there is no alternative, the future is not all
gloomy for men. Although it will take time, and a change in family
organisation, these developments should be welcomed.
For some men, it provides an opportunity to get out of the rat race
and to get to know their kids better. For many women it offers them the
chance to achieve financial independence for the first time. Attitudes
may be slow to change but ultimately the quality of life for everyone in
employment should improve as a better balance is struck among the sexes
between work and family life.

PONDER how fate treats the exiles restored to political life and
wonder at the unfairness of it all. Mr Michael Ancram, Mr Gerry Malone,
and Mr Iain Sproat were all doing nicely, thank you, when the electorate
said enough was enough.
Mr Ancram, a former chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party and a
junior Minister at the Scottish Office for five years, lost his
Edinburgh seat to Labour in 1987. Mr Malone, also a junior Minister
there, who had succeeded Mr Sproat in the allegedly unsafe Aberdeen
South seat in 1983, also lost then.
Mr Sproat, who had switched from Aberdeen to Roxburgh and
Berwickshire, thinking the former unsafe, only to find in 1983 that it
was his chosen haven which would have none of him, spent longer in the
political wilderness than the other two. He was also a high flier when
dispatched, being an under-secretary at the Department of Trade in
charge of aviation and shipping when the voters ended his career,
temporarily as it turned out,
All three found succour in safe English seats. Mr Sproat was returned
for Harwich, Mr Ancram for Devizes, and Mr Malone for Winchester at the
1992 General Election. All three got jobs in the present Government. Mr
Sproat became under-secretary at National Heritage, Mr Malone went to a
similar post at Health, as Mr Ancram did at Northern Ireland.
The poisoned chalice by parliamentary standards went to Mr Ancram, or
so it seemed. In fact, Mr Sproat's time at National Heritage has been
less than glorious, and Mr Malone, lumbered with defending the record of
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, has been given one of the most thankless tasks
around, something of a no-win situation.
Ulster politics have proved a graveyard for countless Westminster
politicians, but if the agreement reached yesterday between Mr John
Major and Mr John Bruton proves, as the headlines claimed, a case of
''Now a peace everlasting'' then Mr Ancram will be able to claim his
reward.
The Prime Minister will, of course, claim the greater glory, and much
of what is left over will go to the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, but there should be enough left over for the man who did
the political groundwork. His reward, if all goes well, should be a
mainland posting.
Junior jobs in Ulster are not much fun. They attract few newspaper
headlines here, and the job provides few opportunities for making a name
for oneself.
In September 1993 Mr Ancram was given the job of starting talks with
the various political parties in a bid to find a political solution, and
received his reward for a job being well done when in January last year
he was promoted to Minister of State.
Aged 49, he was MP for Edinburgh South from 1979-1987.
He became an under-secretary at the Scottish Office in 1983, and was
chairman of the Scottish Tory Party from 1980 until 1983.
A pro-devolution man then and a wet, he belonged, like his Secretary
of State, Mr George Younger, to the old-fashioned wing of the Tory
Party, the caring toffs. He is heir to the Marquis of Lothian, married
to the daughter of the Duke of Norfolk.
He was not on record as having expressed any particular interest in
Northern Ireland when he got the job, succeeding Mr Jeremy Hanley, but
he had two qualifications. His Scottish Office experience, and the fact
that he is a Roman Catholic. The Government usually wants one of the
Ministers to be a Catholic. He was given responsibility for the key post
of political development, and played his part in assisting Sir Patrick
to kick-start the stalled inter-party talks.
It was his misfortune during the eighties that the times were
unfavourable to his sort of Tory. It was the age of the brutish radical.
But times change, and the administrative skills he learned as a Scottish
Office Minister -- he was Scottish Housing Minister -- have served him
well in Ulster.

IN Boston, Mass., there is a very imposing statue of the Civil War
soldier General George Hooker. Sadly for him he is not now remembered
for any military exploits but simply because of the ladies who
camp-followed his army, gave their all to maintain morale, and became
known as ''hookers''.
Perhaps his likeness should be moved to Edinburgh. For our own capital
city, once known as the Athens of the North, and later as the Aids
Centre of the Kingdom, has a new nickname, the City of Sauna Sinners.
The big picture is (and has been for some time) that you get more than a
massage in many of our parlours.
Indeed I recall some years ago being in an Edinburgh taxi, surrounded
by advertisements urging me to call in at Carlo's or Scorpio's or the
Executive Sauna where I would be assured of a ''glowing tan'', and I
enquired of the driver: ''Are any of these places legit?'' He laughed so
much we nearly ran into a stationary dust-cart.
For a considerable period the authorities -- the constabulary, the
licensing board and the upright citizenry themselves, if you will
forgive the expression -- have had a Three Wise Monkeys policy. They
have seen no evil, heard no evil, and spoken of no evil. As long as the
premises were clean, met the fire regulations, and did not have punters
banging on the door at midnight they were generally left alone. In
Edinburgh, you could expect to find a better class of brothel.
A recent applicant to set up this variety of small business has run
into a bit of local opposition, however. Some parents of young sprogs
object to them playing outside a house of sin, other residents have
taken exception to the person applying for an ''entertainment'' licence.
Politicians -- many of my own persuasion -- want, belatedly, to know if
the law is being flouted.
Well, of course it is. And there is nothing new in that either.
Edinburgh has had many madams, the most famous of whom was Mrs Dora
Noyce whose house of wide repute operated from the heart of the New
Town. She was in fact a paid-up member of the Tory Party and once took
considerable pleasure in putting a poster in her window which proudly
proclaimed: ''Life is better under the Conservatives.''
Policemen of her era, including former Chief Constable Sir John Inch,
always insisted to me that they were much happier when Dora was in
charge rather than behind bars as her establishment was then properly
controlled. She sent her girls for regular health checks, she threw out
the drunks, she even brought a bottle down on the head of one client who
dared to raise a hand to a lady.
I expect, privately, the modern copper would take the same line. They
know, and only the ignorant and the hypocritical would disagree, that
there is no chance of stamping out the oldest profession completely.
Better to keep it off the streets.
When you see some of the pathetic specimens who do inhabit the
corners, in Leith or at the Glasgow bus station, you have to concede
they have a point. Behind these girls, persuaded to perform in the backs
of cars or up some close, there stands the shadow of the pimp, ready to
take his cut, even more eager to keep his worker in line by a supply of
drugs. The risk of Aids is shoved aside by the needs of the moment.
Yet I must confess I find the Edinburgh situation less than
satisfactory as well. If we are going to accept that we will not stop
prostitution it is not enough to shove the problem into the saunas. How
do we know what standards apply behind their brightly-painted doors? Who
are the people making the profits? Why should they be allowed to do so
in secret?
So, doubtless incurring the wrath of my party's moral wing, not to
mention Tom Winning, I have to tell you I am in favour of changing the
law and decriminalising the whole business. If we can't cure the patient
at least we can limit the spread of the disease.
I believe all brothels/saunas should be strictly licensed, that all
operators should be vetted by the police, that all girls should be
medically examined, at their expense, on a regular basis. And I think
they should be forced to display their charges in their windows.
No, I do not believe they would be best run by the local authorities,
that would only mean they would make a loss. Nor does allowing them to
function mean a seal of public approval, it is just cutting through the
cant.
I am told by some that even with licensed houses there will be girls
who wish to ply the trade on the street. Perhaps, but there will be a
lot fewer of them.
Prohibition has never worked, either for drink or prostitution. No-one
will be forced along to licensed establishments; those who wander in by
mistake can still make an excuse and leave; in fact if any youngsters
are found there, as clients or providers, the place should be
immediately shut down and the owners fined punitively.
I would like to see the pimps and the drug dealers dealt a blow. I
would like to reduce the risk of violence to the girls who, for whatever
reason and let us not be too judgemental, wish to pursue this kind of
trade. I would like society to stop pretending.
Which national politician will be brave enough to run with such a
banner? Not Townee Blur, that's for sure.  Pity we lost old Sir Nicky,
he would not have given a damn what anybody thought.

<TEXT>
THE Government's student loans system was in ''chaos'', forcing
thousands to live in deprivation, Labour claimed last night.
Mr Bryan Davies, for the Opposition, called for a full inquiry into
what he said was a worsening problem.
He was speaking during a debate on a Labour bid -- which was defeated
-- to revoke regulations governing the system laid before Parliament in
November.
He warned that, unless something was done, thousands more students
would be hit by what he said was the increasing tendency to give loans
rather than grants.
Mr Davies said: ''There is chaos in the processing of loans, and
35,000 students complained last term they had not received their loans
by Christmas.''
For the Government, junior Education Minister Tim Boswell acknowledged
there had been problems with student loans this year, but insisted: ''We
continue to believe the system is fundamentally well designed.''
Ms Jacqui Lait (Hastings and Rye -- Con.) claimed students were better
off than before.
She recalled that in the 1960s she had managed as a student on #2 a
week -- #25 in today's money. ''I managed it. I am here and so would
they be. With the student loans system, they are in fact broadly better
off than they were.''
However, Mr Don Foster, for the Liberal Democrats, said many students
were left with around #15 to #20 a week for food, heating and books.

SUN-drenched beaches with blushing but bronzed brides are making a
difference to the bridal gowns available for the altogether more dreich
domestic market this spring. Dresses which were once designed purely
with Barbados nuptials in mind are about to enliven Scottish churchyards
in the next few months as more brides take the plunge into lighter and
frothier little numbers to say: ''I do''.
Scottish brides are widely recogised as being more experimental than
their southern counterparts, which may account for their willingness to
try out gowns outwith the strict confines of their label designation;
the design house may say it caters for overseas brides but who's to say
that a gown cannot be worn in Kirkcaldy. However the biggest indicator
of a change in attitude to ''beach bridal gowns'' is the emergence of a
certain ethereal quality in a good few of the little numbers being
showcased by mainstream bridal houses.
Opaque chiffon skirts have long been accepted as suitable for
second-time around weddings, but wispy layers of chiffon -- which keep a
bride cool in the heat of Tobago and stylishly posed for the camera in
the trade winds of Trinidad -- are gaining ground for first-time around
extravaganzas in Glasgow or Galashiels, where they have their own
''trade winds'' for photogenic draping.
Apart from the allure imparted from myriad shiny photographs of
weddings in the West Indies, these gowns offer an attractive option for
brides who want to look modern but would feel restrained by the severity
of the current vogue for simple, straight dresses. Not everyone has the
gamine touch required to carry off the Audrey Hepburn look.
Obviously chiffon skirts are a starting point, but to take away from
the formalised mid calf level usually asked for by older brides, design
houses have been playing with the hems and playing pretty fast and loose
at that. Hems can be casually dropped hankerchief fashion to drape at
irregular intervals or a more sophisticated style can be achieved by
raising the hemline towards the front, letting it softly sweep down to
the back to provide a lingering glimpse of well-turned ankles in an
essentially long dress.
Chiffon also offers the intriguing possibility of the revelation of
depth with a top layer just cut short of an underskirt to suggest a
fuller skirt style. Brides who want a suggestion of the old fairytale
styles for bridal gowns can go down the aisle unencumbered by swathes of
silk by the clever use of tulle, chiffon and lace skirts to create an
opaque suggestion of ballerina grace with an overtly feminine outline.
But imaginative design houses do not stop with chiffon skirts. Fluid
chiffon tops over straight dresses can soften up the rigid curves of the
present fifties silhouette, while a swatch of chiffon secured across the
shoulders can add a touch of old romance to straitened straight dresses.
A looser feel is also evident in the use of lace tops for bridal
gowns. Fluid lace, which does not stand to attention but goes with the
flow like muslin, can take the starch right out of a straight silk
underdress with embroidiery around the edges bringing both underdress
and overtop together in bridal harmony. A detachable top over a straight
underskirt does of course offer the very sensible option of a ready-made
elegant gown suitable for other occasions.
Andrea Wilkin, a widely acknowledged -- and stocked -- designer in
Scotland is this year showcasing a lot of floral touches in her largely
traditionally romantic collection but a few wispier selections are
making their debut. Under this design label, brides can be swathed in
layers of decorated chiffon and lace for an altogether fairytale
alliance of a full skirt and floaty trails or head for the tropics in a
straightish style softened with a light embroidered lace overtop and
given its own sundeck with a strategically placed back view.
Then of course there are the specialists such as the Brides of
Paradise label -- sister of the well known Sallie Bee label, both of
which are produced by Sposa Bella. As is obvious by the name, the Brides
of Paradise label was originally conceived to cater more for weddings
abroad but their marketing material now puts the onus on less formal
weddings at home.
As befits a specialist in this sector, it has a good range of choice
of floaty option from skirts to tops of varying degress of fluidity.
Chiffon layers of skirts with variable hemlines are offered alongside --
though generally not in tandem with -- floaty tops.
Aside from foreign beaches, the next best habitat for these dresses is
obviously the less formal wedding which does not entail 1000 people at
the local cathedral. These are dresses for brides who know that it may
be their big day but they are not necessarily going to stand to
attention throughout but will enjoy themselves to the full; brides who
know only to well that come the reception they will bubble, but it won't
be with tears.
In these gowns, brides can swish about giving full rein to their
exuberance or flit about their guests unhindered by the rigidity of more
conventional fuller and stiffer styles.

* HAVE you ever wanted to put questions on the menopause to women's
health guru Dr Miriam Stoppard? Well, you will have your chance later
this month when she attends a fund-raising evening dinner in Falkirk.
Patron of WellBeing (Glasgow branch), this is her third visit during the
past year to Scotland.
Maria Dorrian, chair of Glasgow WellBeing, says the level of interest
in the menopause is phenomenal. ''It is evident that women want to be
better informed on problems relating to their health and wellbeing.''
During her visit to Glasgow, Dr Stoppard will also lead a special
seminar on HRT and the Menopause for GPs and practice nurses. Tickets
for the evening on Monday, which will include a three-course dinner at
the Inchyra Grange hotel, Polmont, are priced #16. Further information
from Maria Dorrian on 0360 620758 or 0324 623191.
* WOMEN are more likely to keep to a hormone replacement therapy
regime if they are seen regularly at a special HRT clinic rather than on
a one-to-one basis with their GP, says a report in the British Journal
of General Practice.
A study found that the key to boosting compliance was attendance at an
HRT clinic. With clinics women feel adequately counselled and that
correlates with compliance. Also they are likely to have spent about an
hour in the clinic compared to 10 minutes with the GP.
* HAVING regular health checks if you are over 75 is a waste of
resources, says Dr Iain McIntosh, a Stirling doctor who, along with a
group of other researchers at Stirling Royal Infirmary and Forth Valley
Health Board monitored over 1200 patients between 75 and 101.
Only 15% of check-ups reveal medical conditions requiring further
action, concludes their study reported in the current issue of GP.
Says Dr McIntosh: ''After the first assessment, there's little value
in annual check-ups for most of the people we contacted. In general
terms, it is just not worth it.''
* WOMEN who wish to claim against the manufacturers of silicone breast
implants are urged to contact the Law Society of Scotland to obtain the
necessary forms. Around 500 women who had such operations before June 1
1993 could be eligible. Forms are available from The Law Society, 26
Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh. Phone: 031 226 7411.
* CONCERN about the increase in asthma is growing. Now the National
Asthma Campaign has organised a series of one-day educational meetings
throughout the country for doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers.
Specialist speakers will discuss asthma in childhood and in the
workplace and how to improve care.  There is one Scottish venue:
Edinburgh, May 9. If you are interested phone the NAC conference
manager: (0171) 226 2260.
* DOCTORS in Aberdeen have found it's less stressful to test women
first for the cystic fibrosis gene than to test the couple together.
Obstetricians at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital offered couples the
choice of both methods of testing then surveyed them on their levels of
stress, says a report in the current issue of GP magazine. They found
that women who opted to be tested first to see if they were a carrier
had less anxiety.
* WHAT do you do in an emergency? how do you stop a child choking,
deal with an elderly person who has fallen  or give mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation?
Ideally, we should all have some First Aid training but failing that
every home should at least have a First Aid manual. An excellent one is
the latest edition of the First Aid manual produced in conjunction with
St John Ambulance, St Andrew's Ambulance Association and the British Red
Cross.  Published in paperback by Dorling Kindersley, price #8.99p,
available from leading bookshops.

John Major's persistence in attempting to reach a deal in Ulster has
been admired by even his harshest critics, but the Prime Minister will
also be hoping that it will rejuvenate his political career
THE Northern Ireland ceasefire was five months and 22 days old
yesterday when Mr Major spoke of his determination to press forward with
the peace process he has shepherded for more than two years.
Nearly six months of normal life for the people of Northern Ireland,
after 25 years of violence and the deaths of more than 3000 people,
stand as testimony to what has been achieved by the Prime Minister's
dogged pursuit of a settlement. In his remarks in Belfast he
acknowledged, the ceasefire's importance: ''The prize has been very
great. So great as to be worth the effort.''
It has been an enormous effort, beset at every twist and turn by those
who have accused Mr Major of going too far or of going too slowly. But
Mr Major's attempts to find a way through the obstacles of history that
have blocked a solution in Northern Ireland are being acclaimed as the
greatest success of his otherwise troubled tenure as Prime Minister.
''To reach our destination, all concerned must be ready to look to the
future rather than to the past. We must put aside old shibboleths. We
must show fair-mindedness and imagination. The destination I seek is a
lasting and peaceful settlement. It is obtainable and I believe we have
taken a very important step towards it,'' he said yesterday.
In a political environment where obstinacy is valued more than
flexibility, Mr Major has managed to maintain his fair-mindedness,
despite the constant sniping he has faced both from both Unionist and
Republican sides. As a result he can claim to have produced more
progress than any of his modern predecessors.
In Belfast yesterday, Mr Major was modest but unequivocal: it is ''my
responsibility, my duty and also as my wish to see if I can find a way
forward, and I propose to continue to do that,'' he declared.
But even his harshest critics on other matters are frank in their
admiration for his dedication to the task of reconciling the two sides
in Northern Ireland.
He has impressed those close to him with his single-mindedness of
purpose. Presenting the framework document to his colleagues, he told
them: ''My job is to stop the killing''. A Labour source said yesterday:
''He has been persistent and he deserves the credit for it.''
Yet at Westminster, and within his own party, Mr Major is beleaguered,
locked in a seemingly perpetual struggle with back benchers over Europe,
VAT, and a variety of other issues.
Just as he has slowly been writing himself into the history books over
Northern Ireland, rebels in the ranks have been doing their best to
drive him out as leader of the party.
It is one of the great ironies of politics that, while Mr Major may
not see out this Parliament as leader of the Conservative Party, he can
claim a large share of the credit for a ceasefire that only one year ago
was considered an near-impossible goal.
It has been a remarkable year. The Army no longer patrols the streets
of Belfast, while Sinn Fein, only six months ago banned from being heard
on Britain's airwaves, has entered into talks with the Government it
considers an occupying power. And even the Unionists, despite regular
outbursts of protest and ''no surrender'', have so far failed to derail
the peace process.
All this thanks to a Prime Minister who has seen his Parliamentary
majority eroded into technical non-existence, by the ejection of nine
Tory rebels over Europe, and who now relies on the support of nine
Ulster Unionists MPs for the life of his Government.
The Unionists' hatred of what Mr Major is attempting in Northern
Ireland -- they accuse him of misreading the province and of failing to
understand that they speak with the full support of their Protestant
electorate -- is tempered by the knowledge that to bring down the
Government could bring in Labour and a distinctly more pro-nationalist
line.
The latest round of peace talks was set off by Mr Major and the then
Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, when they met in London in
1991 and agreed to seek a lasting political settlement for Northern
Ireland.
But what became known as the Round Table talks, guided at first by the
then Northern Ireland Secretary, Mr Peter Brooke, collapsed without
agreement in November 1992.
The process was revived the following year, after it emerged that Mr
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein President, and Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader,
had held a series of meetings during which it became clear that Sinn
Fein and the IRA were keen to abandon the armed struggle and pursue a
political settlement. In September 1993 the two men presented the
British and Irish governments with their framework for peace document.
It led to the signing, in December 1993, of the Downing Street
Declaration, in which Mr Major and Mr Reynolds offered Sinn Fein a seat
at the negotiating table in exchange for giving up violence.
Unionist opposition was immediate, but Mr Major succeeded in defusing
much of it through his repeated assurances that any change in the status
of Northern Ireland would only come about with the agreement of its
people.
The Republicans have also been reluctant to accord Mr Major any
credit. Mr Adams argues that the peace process is the natural result of
the Irish people's desire for peace and of the series of secret meetings
that took place in 1993 between himslef and Mr Hume.
At the time of the Downing Street Declaration, Mr Adams said Mr Major
had been ''devious and mischievous'' in his approach to the peace
initiative, and said that British politicians were more interested in
gesture politics.
But Mr Major's motivations stem from his recognition that, on both
sides of the Irish Sea, the public is frustrated by the inability of
politicians to agree on anything.
Without conceding ground to the men of violence, Mr Major has
succeeded in acknowledging, albeit hidden in labyrinthine language, some
of the nationalist aspirations of the Northern Ireland minority.
On several occasions attempts to sabotage the peace talks have
threatened to destroy months of steady, often secret progress behind the
scenes. In 1993, the revelation that British Government officials had
met secretly with Sinn Fein angered the Irish Government.
The latest crisis came earlier this month when a copy of the Framework
Document was leaked to the Times. Mr Major was forced into late-night
meetings with back benchers, to head off any fears that he had given in
to Dublin.
The next day, with Unionists MPs screaming betrayal, Mr Major went
over the heads of the politicians and appealed on television to the
people of Northern Ireland to support the peace process.
Throughout, in his public pronouncements and his back-room
negotiations, Mr Major has returned again and again to what has come to
be known as the British guarantee of a ''triple-lock''.
This promises the Unionists that the Framework Document will first be
put up for consultation. Whatever the parties in Northern Ireland
decide, will then have to be approved by a referendum, which in turn
will be subject to approval by Parliament.
Although no-one doubts his motives, it will not have escaped Mr
Major's notice that there is political and electoral capital to be made
from peace in Northern Ireland.
He must be hoping that, both within his party and in the country at
large, the success he has achieved so far in Northern Ireland will
continue long enough to keep him in No 10 Downing Street until the
General Election and beyond.

AT least three Government Ministers are expected to support a Bill
presented by Labour MP John McFall to ban cruelty in field sports when
it goes before the Commons next week.
Supporters believe the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill will receive its
second reading -- the first time such a measure has progressed so far in
Parliament -- on the back of mounting public concern for the rights of
animals.
Mr McFall, MP for Dumbarton, said MPs had been deluged with calls from
their constituents.
At Westminster yesterday, animal rights campaigners showed to MPs the
latest video evidence of hunt cruelty.
The half-hour film, produced by the League Against Cruel Sports, was
made at a number of hunt and coursing meets across England. It shows a
succession of incidents, most involving men dragging foxes out of holes
and throwing them to packs of baying dogs.
Mr McFall's Bill will be debated in the House next Friday. Mr McFall
said yesterday he was optimistic that it would receive widespread
support from all parties.
He said: ''Every MP I have spoken to has been contacted by at least
100 constituents on this matter, illustrating that it is an issue of
tremendous concern to the public.''
Mr McFall said his Bill has the support of Transport Minister Steven
Norris, Employment Minister Philip Oppenheim and Citizen's Charter
Minister Robert Hughes, as well as Tory MPs Sir Teddy Taylor and Roger
Gale, and Scottish Nationalist MP Margaret Ewing.

JENNY Whelan starts work today in Glasgow and she feels she has come
home. ''Glaswegians are my kind of people,'' says 43-year-old Jenny,
born in Yorkshire, brought up on Speyside, and having spent the past 20
years nursing in Edinburgh, writes Ann Shaw.
Her new post is a special one, heading a team of counsellors whose
task is to take the emotional and pyschological pain out of dealing with
cancer.
Jenny is the newly appointed manager for BACUP (British Association of
Cancer United Patients), the cancer charity which has just opened its
first office in Scotland with premises in Bell Street, Glasgow.
''The emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis can have a dramatic and
destructive effect. To restore the ability to cope often required the
skilled input of someone who has been professionally trained,'' explains
Jenny. ''One reason for this is that those nearest can be strongly
affected and at time have difficulty removing themselves from the
situation.''
While considerable progress has been made in the treatment of the
disease during the past 20 years little has been done to remove the
stigma, fear, and ignorance surrounding cancer.
What does it mean to be told you have prostate or breast cancer? The
truth of the matter is that there is a dearth of emotional support and
pyschological counselling not to mention information and practical
advice.
Vicky Clements Jones, a doctor who has since died of ovarian cancer,
founded BACUP in 1985. While in hospital being treated for the disease
she was appalled at the lack of information and emotional support for
cancer sufferers. BACUP, which provides a free information and
counselling service, was her practical response.
As former cancer nurse, Jenny Whelan understands the stresses both
patients and medical staff are under. She worked in the Western General
hospital, Edinburgh, first as a ward sister and then for seven years as
a clinical nurse specialist in the Medical Oncology Department.
But in 1990 she took time out, working for five months with the
Romanian Orphanage Trust. She arrived shortly after the revolution and
today the memory is still vivid of those babies dying of HIV, the result
of contaminated blood supplies.
Her new job holds different challenges: ''Middle-class women know how
to access information. What we aim to do is to get through to all those
women living on housing estates on the outskirts of Glasgow. We want to
let them know that there is somewhere they can go to for counselling,
information, and advice if they or a member of their family has
cancer.''

A NEW national quarterly newspaper for Scotland's 10,000-strong Polish
community was launched yesterday in Edinburgh.
The circulation of Gazeta, a tabloid, is expected to extend to more
than 10,000 people who are friends of Poland and to an increasing number
of companies in Scotland doing business with the country.
The paper will be written mainly in English, to reflect the usage of
the language by most second-generation Poles. Other articles will be in
Polish for older Poles in Scotland.
The paper will be edited by Maria Rayska, the daughter of a Polish
cavalry officer, who was born in Edinburgh.
Ms Rayska's husband, Mr Tony Keniston, is handling the paper's public
relations. He said Gazeta had already acquired subscribers from Orkney
and Shetland and throughout mainland Scotland.
Gazeta's first issue will be published on April 6. It will be sold on
an annual subscription of #5, including postage.
The launch was conducted by Dr Pawel Dobrowolski, Polish Consul
General in Edinburgh.

<HEADLINE>Safety pledge as Government denies bridge being left to rust</HEADLINE>

THE Government yesterday rejected claims that the Forth Bridge was
being left to rust and warp through lack of maintenance.
Junior Transport Minister Steven Norris told the Commons the
105-year-old railway bridge had been assessed by independent safety
experts.
Rejecting calls for an inquiry, he said: ''It is not a bridge that is
in any sense threatened.
''I have no reason to doubt Railtrack's view that the bridge is
structurally sound. I am quite happy we can look forward to another
century of trains crossing it.''
His comments came at the end of a short debate initiated by Labour MP
Eric Clarke (Midlothian), who protested that the bridge was in a
''deplorable'' state.
He was backed by Transport Select Committee member Mr Brian Donohoe
(Cunninghame South -- Lab.), who demanded an independent inquiry into
the state of the bridge.
Mr Clarke held up a newspaper photograph of the bridge which he said
showed a ''rusting hulk''.
He insisted: ''That is actual rusting of the structure. It is a
deplorable state, a scandal.''
He said one member of the public had seen a girder falling off but
when he tried to take up the issue was given ''the run-around'' and
ended up spending around #200 on telephone calls.
The Government should be responsible for funding the bridge, he said.
Mr Donohoe said he had visited the bridge and inspected parts of it
with other members of the Transport Select Committee.
It was clear that corrosion was at an ''extreme stage'' in some parts.
He warned: ''Close to the water at the bottom of the bridge there is
absolutely no evidence of paint.
''There is bulging steel. There is warped steel and there are areas
that are completely void of any structure at all.
''I cannot see under any circumstances that this is something that
should be left to Railtrack itself.''
Calling for an independent inquiry, he told Mr Norris: ''We need a
commitment today that you will now look at this more seriously than the
Scottish Office, than Railtrack has and more seriously than British Rail
has over the years.''
However, Mr Norris insisted: ''There has been a lot of publicity about
the Forth Bridge recently although much of it, I have to say, has been
exaggerated.''
Independent inspections, including one by the Health and Safety
Executive, had been been satisfied ''with the structural integrity of
the bridge''.
Mr Norris said Railtrack accepted that from a cosmetic point of view
the bridge could look better, but it would cost tens of millions of
pounds to make it look like a ''gleaming'' tourist attraction. It would
not be reasonable to expect Railtrack to do this.
He added: ''Reports of flaking or large pieces falling off are, as far
as we are aware, not substantiated.''

REAFFIRM the guiding principles of self-determination, the consent of
the governed, exclusively democratic and peaceful means, and full
respect and protection for the rights and identities of both traditions.
PROVIDE for an agreed new approach to traditional constitutional
doctrines on both sides.
THE British Government will propose changes to its constitutional
legislation, so as to incorporate a commitment to continuing willingness
to accept the will of a majority of the people living in Northern
Ireland, and a commitment to exercise their jurisdiction with rigorous
impartiality on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland, in a way
which does not prejudice their freedom to determine Northern Ireland's
constitutional status, whether in remaining a part of the United Kingdom
or in forming part of a united Ireland.
THE Irish Government will introduce and support proposals for changes
in the Irish Constitution, so that no territorial claim of right to
jurisdiction over Northern Ireland, contrary to the will of a majority
of its people is asserted, and so that the Irish Government recognises
the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of
the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional status.
COMMEND direct dialogue with the relevant political parties in
Northern Ireland in developing new internal structures.
PROPOSE a North/South body, comprising elected representatives from,
and accountable to, a Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish
Parliament, to deal with matters designated by the two Governments in
the first instance in agreement with the parties.
DESCRIBE ways in which such a body could work with executive,
harmonising, or consultative functions, by way of authority delegated to
its members by the Assembly.
ENVISAGE that all decisions within the North/South body would be by
agreement between the two sides.
SET out criteria for the designation of functions, and suggest a range

with the parties.
ENVISAGE that the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish Parliament
being able, by agreement, to designate further functions or to move
functions already designated between the three categories.
ENVISAGE that the body will have an important role, in consultation
with the two governments, in developing an agreed approach for the whole
island in respect of the challenges and opportunties of the European
Union.
ENVISAGE a Parliamentary forum, with representatives from the new
Northern Ireland institutions and the Irish Parliament, to consider
matters of mutual interest.
ENVISAGE a new and more broadly based agreement between the British
and Irish governments to develop and extend co-operation.

matters of mutual interest, but not those transferred to new political
institutions in Northern Ireland.
ENVISAGE that represenatives of agreed political institutions in
Northern Ireland may be formally associated with the work of the
conference.
PROVIDE for a complementary undertaking by both governments to ensure
protection for specified civil, political, social and cultural rights.
THESE proposals do not provide for joint authority by the British and
Irish governments over Northern Ireland. They do not predetermine any
outcome to the talks process. Agreement by the parties, and then by the
people, is the key.

THE ROW over threatened Motorail and sleeper services to Scotland
deepened last night when rail regulator John Swift told MPs at
Westminster that he is looking into the closure plans.
He accepted that the cutting of some trains was a ''political hot
potato'' as he gave evidence to the Commons Transport Select Committee,
which is inquiring into the impact of railway privatisation.
Franchise director Roger Salmon has made clear that some trains may
not be included in the mimimum level of service, and those under threat
include the sleeper service from London to Fort William and the Motorail
services to Scotland.
Mr Swift told the MPs: ''I have so far written to Mr Salmon seeking
clarification on certain matters.'' He said he had received letters from
a number of Scottish MPs urging him to intervene and exercise his powers
but, asked if he could assure MPs that services would remain as they are
until the formal consultation process was over, he replied: ''I cannot
give that assuranced to the committee.''
Earlier, there were furious exchanges in the Commons as Scottish
Office Ministers sought to defend their line on the future of Motorail
and sleeper services under rail privatisation.
At the heart of the problem was the statement made at the Scottish
Grand Committee on February 8 by Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector
Monro that a ''full, formal consultation'' would take place.
Formal consultation has different connotations for the Government and
the Opposition parties.
The Government's line is that it means that after publication of the
proposed passenger service requirement in May, there will be a formal
process of consultation with the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for
Scotland and local authorities, before final decisions are taken.
In the meantime, any decision to withdraw sleeper or Motorail services
in advance of the consultation process would be a commercial decision
for British Rail.
However, the Opposition takes the view that a formal consultation
process means there must be a much lengthier procedure gone through, and
that all existing services must remain in place until that is completed.
Last night Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs signed a Commons
motion accused the Government of reneging on its commitment.
There were allegations -- denied by Government Ministers -- that the
Official Report (Hansard) had been ''tampered with'' over Sir Hector's
remarks, and the motion said that the MPs believed ''the Secretary of
State and the Honourable Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector) cannot both
continue to serve in government office.''
At Scottish Questions, Eastwood Tory MP Allan Stewart asked his
successor as Scottish Office Minister, Mr George Kynoch, for a yes or no
answer on whether there would be formal consultations.
Mr Kynoch urged him to wait for a later question when the subject
would be raised again, prompting Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson to accuse the Minister of ''dodging and weaving round a
straight question.''
He said: ''Unemployment in the Highlands is going to be dramatically
affected if railway privatisation leads, as it will, to a reduction in
services throughout that area.
''A Minister of the Crown (Sir Hector) in a committee of this House,
gave a categorical assurance that there would be formal consultation on
the issue of Motorail and the sleeper services to the north of Scotland.
It is up to you not to pass the buck to some other Minister or even your
boss, but to answer the question that was asked. Is there going to be a
formal consultation before these services are withdrawn -- yes or no?''
Mr Kynoch said he already had answered the question in relation to the
consultations with the users' committees that would take place after
publication of the PSR.
The situation came to a head when Scottish Secretary Ian Lang accepted
there were ''indications of a diminution'' in the sleeper services
between Carlisle and Fort William and the Motorail services to Aberdeen.
He insisted that all closures would be subject to formal consultation
under the 1993 Railways Act, but a clearly angry Mr Charles Kennedy
(Ross, Cromarty and Skye -- Lib. Dem.) said that what had been promised
by the Scottish Office -- full and formal consultation -- was not the
same as the consultation to which Mr Kynoch had referred earlier.
Rounding on the Secretary of State, Labour's Brian Wilson (Cunninghame
North) said: ''You are shaming and making Sir Hector look a fool. He
gave an assurance in good faith. This is a disgusting performance from
you.'' Mr Lang replied coldly: ''I am just confirming what he said.''

THE Joint Declaration issued yesterday acknowledges that ''the most
urgent and important issue facing the people of Ireland, North and
South, and the British and Irish Governments together, is to remove the
causes of conflict, to overcome the legacy of history and to heal the
divisions which have resulted.''
Both Governments ''recognise that there is much for deep regret on all
sides in the long and often tragic history of Anglo-Irish relations, and
of relations in Ireland. They believe it is now time to lay aside, with
dignity and forbearance, the mistakes of the past.''
The announcements by the IRA and Loyalist military commands were ''a
welcome response to the profound desire of people throughout these
islands for a permanent end to the violence which caused such immense
suffering and waste and served only to reinforce the barriers of fear
and hatred, impeding the search for agreement.''
The approach in the document ''presents challenges to strongly-held
positions on both sides. However, a new beginning in relationships means
addressing fundamental issues in a new way and inevitably, means
addressing fundamental issues in a new way and inevitably requires
significant movement from all sides.'' The document was not a blueprint
to be imposed but a ''realistic and balanced framework for agreement''
which could be achieved in negotiations with the Northern Ireland
parties.
The proposals reaffirm the guiding principles of self determination,
the consent of the Government, exclusively democratic and peaceful
means, and full respect and protection for the rights and identities of
both traditions.
CONSTITUTIONAL
THE British Government will propose changes to its constitutional
legislation so as to incorporate a commitment to continuing willingness
to accept the will of a majority of the people living in Northern
Ireland and a commitment to exercise their jurisdiction with rigorous
impartiality on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland in a way
that does not prejudice Northern Ireland's constitutional status whether
in remaining a part of the United Kingdom or in forming part of a united
Ireland. This will be achieved either by amendments to the Government of
Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by new legislation.
The Irish Government will introduce and support proposals for changes
in the Irish Constitution so that no territorial claim of right to
jurisdiction over Northern Ireland contrary to the will of a majority of
its people is asserted, and so that the Irish Government recognise the
legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the
people of Northern Ireland with regard to its constitutional status. It
recognises the ''legitimacy of whatever choice is made'' by a majorty in
the province whether to remain in the Union or join a sovereign united
Ireland.
NORTHERN IRELAND STRUCTURES
BOTH Governments recognise that the new political structures in the
province must depend on the co-operation of elected representatives
there. ''While the principles and overall context for such new
structures are a reognised concern of both Governments in the exercise
of their respective responsibilities, they consider that the structures
themselves would be most effectively negotiated, as part of a
comprehensive three stranded process, in direct dialogue involving the
relevant political parties in Northern Ireland who would be called upon
to operate them.
NORTH-SOUTH INSTITUTIONS
A North-South body should be established comprising elected
representatives from and accountable to a Northern Ireland Assembly and
the Irish Parliament to deal with matters designated by the two
Governments in the first instance in agreement with the parties.
It would bring together heads of departments from the Irish Government
and the Northern Ireland Assembly ''to discharge or oversee delegated
executive, harmonising or consultative functions'' over a range of
matters which the Irish and Assembly administrations agree to devolve.
It would be a ''duty of service'' for heads of departmnt of both the
Republic and Assembly to serve on it. Both Governments believe that
legislation should provide for ''a clear institutional identity and
purpose for the North-South body'' which ''could operate through or
oversee a range of functionally related subsidiary bodies or other
entities established to administer designated functions on an all-island
or cross-border basis.''
The body could operate in several ways:
Consultative -- a forum where the two sides could consult on any
aspect of designated matters on which either side wished to consult.
They would have a duty to consult and exchange information but there
would be no formal requirement that agreement be reached or that policy
would be implemented or harmonised jointly ''but the development of
mutual understanding or common or agreed positions would be the general
goal.''
Harmonisation -- there would be ''an obligation on both sides to use
their best endeavours to reach agreement on a common policy and to make
determined efforts to overcome any obstacles in the way of that
objective, even though its implementation might be undertaken by the two
administrations separately.''
Executive -- in the case of designated responsibilities the body
''would be directly responsible for the establishment of an agreed
policy and for its implementation on a joint basis. It would, however,
be open to the body, where approriate, to agree that the implementation
of the agreed policy would be undertaken either by existing bodies,
acting in an agency capacity, whether jointly or separately, North and
South, or by new bodies specifically created and mandated for this
purpose.''
Both Governments are continuing to consider what functions might be
designated to the body with the agreement of the Northern Ireland
parties.
At the executive level they might include sectors ''involving a
natural or physical all-Ireland and framework; EC programmes and
initiatives; marketing and promotion activities abroad; culture and
heritage.
At harmonisation level might be included aspects of agriculture and
fisheries, industrial development, consumer affairs, transport, energy,
trade, health, social welfare, education, economic policy.
As an example, education harmonisation might include mutual
recognition of teacher qualifications, co-operative ventures in higher
education, teacher training and in education for mutual understanding
and specialised needs.
Both Governments envisage that all decisions within the North-South
body would be by agreement between the two sides. The heads of
departments involved would operate within the overall terms of reference
mandated by legislation in the two sovereign Parliaments.
The operation of the North-South body would be the subject of regular
scrutiny in ''agreed political institutions'' in Northern Ireland and
the Irish Parliament.
Both Governments expect there would be a Parliamentary Forum with
representatives from agreed political institutions in Northern Ireland
and members of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) to consider a wide
range of matters of mutual interest.
The new framework should provide ''a forum for acknowledging the
respective identities and requirements of the two major traditions,
express and enlarge the mutual acceptance of the validity of those
traditions; and promote understanding and agreement among the people and
institutions in both parts of the island. The remit of the body should
be dynamic, enabling progressive extension by agreement of its functions
to new areas. Its role should develop to keep pace with the growth of
harmonisation and with greater integration between the two economies.
This could be done by the Assembly and Irish Parliament agreeing to
designate further functions or moving functions already designated
within the three categories.
Specific arrangements would need to be developed to enable European
Union matters to be considered in the North-South body which the
Governments agree would have an important role in developing an agreed
approach for the whole island in respect of the challenges and
opportunities of the EU.
EAST-WEST STRUCTURES
THE Governments envisage a new and more broadly based agreement to
replace their previous Joint Declartion ''developing and extending their
co-operation reflecting the totality of relationships between the two
islands and dedicated to fostering co-operation, reconciliation and
agreement in Ireland at all levels.''
Under such a new agreement a standing Inter-governmental Conference
would be maintained chaired by a designated Irish Minister and the
Northern Ireland Secretary supported by a permanent secretariat of civil
servants from both Governments.
It will be a forum through which the Governments will work together to
secure agreement and reconciliation amongst the people of the island of
Ireland and laying the foundations for a peaceful and harmonious future
based on mutual understanding and trust between them.
The conference ''will provide a continuing institutional expression
for the Irish Government's recognised concern and role in relation to
Northern Ireland. The Irish government will put forward views and
proposals on issues falling within the ambit of the new Conference or
involving both Governments and determined efforts will be made to
resolve any differences between the two governments.
The conference will ''facilitate the promotion of lasting peace,
stability, justice and reconciliation among the people of the island of
Ireland and maintenance of effective security co-operation between the
two Governments.
''Both Governments accept that issues of law and order in Northern
Ireland are closely intertwined with the issues of political concensus.
For so long as these matters are not devolved, it will be for the
Governments to consider ways in which a climate of peace, new
institutions and the growth of political agreement may offer new
possibilities and opportunities for enhancing community identification
with policing in Northern Ireland while maintaining the most effective
possible deployment of the resources of each Government in their common
determination to combat crime and prevent any possible recourse to the
use or threat of violence for political ends from any source
whatsoever.''
Matters for which responsibilty is transferred to new political
institutions in Northern Ireland will be excluded from consideration in
the conference except to the extent to which the responsibilities of the
Northern Ireland Secretary are relevant or where cross border aspects of
transferred issues are not otherwise provided for.
''Where either Government considers that any institution, established
as part of the overall accommodation,is not properly functioning within
the Agreement or that a breach of the Agreement has otherwise occurred,
the conference shall consider the matter on the basis of a shared
commitment to arrive at a common position or, where that is not
possible, to agree a procedure to resolve the difference between them.
''If the two Governments consider a breach has occurred in any of the
above circumstances, either Government may make proposlas for a remedy
and adequate measures to redress the situation shall be taken. However,
each Government will be responsible for the implementation of such
measures of redress within its own jurisdiction.
''In the event that devolved institutions within Northern Ireland
ceased to operate and direct rule from Westminster was reintroduced, the
British Government agree that other arrangements would be made to
implement the commitment to promote co-operation at all levels between
the people North and South, representing both traditions in Ireland as
agreed by the two Governments in the Joint Declaration, and to ensure
that the co-operation that has been developed through the North-South
body be maintained.''
Representives of agreed political institutions in Northern Ireland may
be formally associated with the work of the conference by advance notice
of discussions, inviting their views or inviting them to participate in
aspects of the conference's work. There could be a co-ordinated approach
to EU issues by the conference and the North-South body.
PROTECTION OF RIGHTS
BOTH Governments will undertake to ensure in their jurisdictions ''the
systematic and effectively protection of common specified civil,
political, social and cultural rights.'' They will discuss with the
Northern Ireland parties what rights should be specified and how they
might best be protected.
The Governments will encourage the adoption by democratic
representives in both jurisdictions to adopt a Charter or Covenant
reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of
fundamental rights of everyone living in Ireland. It could also pledge a
commitment to mutal respect and to the civil rights and religious
liberties of both communities.
These could include: the right to freedom and expression of religion,
to pursue democratically national and political aspirations, to seek
constitutional change by peaceful and legitimate means, to live wherever
one chooses without hindrance and to equal opportunity in all social and
economic activity regardless of class, creed, gender or colour.
The Charter could also incorporate an ''enduring commitment on behalf
of all the people of the island to guarantee and protect the rights,
interests, ethos and dignity of the unionist community in any
all-Ireland framework that might be developed with consent in the
futiure, to at least the same extent as provided for the nationalist
community in the context of Northern Ireland under the structures and
provisions of the new Agreement.''
It might also contain a solemn repudiation on behalf of all traditions
in Ireland ''of all recourse to violence between them for any political
end or purpose.''
CONCLUSION
BOTH Governments intend that the outcome of these negotiations on the
framework document will be submitted for democratic ratification through
referendums North and South.
A new political accommodation ''in which divisions of the past would
be laid aside for ever'' would be ''an inestimable prize for all and
especially for people living in Northern Ireland.''
The Governments believe that such an agreement based on their document
would create ''a new political dispensation'' would transform former
relationships within Northern Ireland, Ireland as a whole and between
both islands.
The new arrangements could return power, authority and responsibility
to locally elected representatives in Northern Ireland on a basis
acceptable to both sides of the community. ''The divisive issue of
sovereignty might cease to be symbolic of the domination of one
community over another.
''Accordingly the British and Irish Governments offer for
consideration and strongly commend these proposals trusting that, with
generosity and goodwill, the peoples of these islands will build on them
a new and lasting agreement.''

Scottish researchers are testing naltrexone -- the first new drug in
decades in the fight against alcoholism -- but, as Ann Shaw reports,
experts say it cannot yet offer a cure
SIXTY people in Edinburgh are taking part in a major British drug
trial of naltrexone, the drug recently approved by the American Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of alcoholics.
But be warned -- this is no magic bullet. Even if it gets the
all-clear in Britain you will not be able to pop along to your GP and
ask for the so-called Sobriety Pill to stop you drinking. For alcohol
abuse is a complex issue with many social and psychological factors
involved.
On the other hand the news is welcomed by experts in the field as
''exciting and positive'' though they add the caveat that we must wait
and see. They see it as another tool in the armoury to combat
alcoholism, albeit an extremely useful one.
Certainly naltrexone looks promising. Sold under the trade name Revia
it has been widely used for a number of years inthe treatment of heroin
addiction.
Dr Jonathon Chick of the Alcohol Problems Clinic at the Royal
Edinburgh Hospital is conducting the only trials in Scotland for the
drug -- which is yet to be licensed in Britain and Europe. The trials
started last April and its likely to be another year before they have
run their course.
Dr Chick is optimistic: ''Yes, it is one of the most exciting of the
new drugs in this area,'' he says, '' US studies suggest it is a useful
aid in conjunction with advice, counselling and support.
He explained: ''This is a double blind placebo study so we have no
idea who is being helped yet. But we are impressed by the evidence from
the two American studies. Therefore we are hopeful that naltrexone may
have a role to play.''
The key to the successful treatment of alcoholism is the realisation
that there is no one single course of treatment for everyone, Dr Chick
emphasises. ''Different people need different kinds of help.''
The drug works by affecting the pleasure centres in the brain, so the
patient no longer gets a kick from drinking. It was first developed by
Du Pont in 1984 to help fight heroin addiction. It works by targeting
the same receptors in the brain as the drug heroin, robbing alcohol of
its uninhibiting effects.
Side effects are limited: nausea in only 10% of cases though there is
a risk of liver toxicity if it is used excessively. It's likely to be of
particular use to those who want to give up alcohol but are chemically
addicted. For them it will be a useful short-term aid, an adjuct to a
counselling programme.
The research so far suggests it's more likely to be successful when
used on those with a long history of alcohol abuse rather than binge
drinkers.
Caveats abound but addiction specialists are optimistic.
Already the Americans regard the drug as the turning point in the
treatment of addiction. ''This is the beginning of a new era in
alcoholism treatment,'' says Enoch Gordis, director of the National
Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
British reaction is as yet less enthusiastic. Sarah Berger, director
of Drinkline, the government-funded helpline service, says: ''Naltrexone
looks like an exciting and important new development but it is not a
wonder drug.
''It is unlikely that any one drug is going to be provide a solution
to an alcohol problem. Naltrexone may be another tool in the armoury we
have to combat alcohol abuse. But its no more than that. It is certainly
not a wonder drug.''
This is a view shared by the Scottish Council on Alcohol who say they
are ''very interested and delighted to hear about the Edinburgh trials
but let's wait and see''. Dr Bob Hughes of the Castle Craig Clinic for
Alcohol Dependency in Peebles says the drug is not used at the clinic.
''A lot more trials will have to be done before it will be widely used.
''It is certainly not a panacea for alcoholics. I believe the drug is
quite promising and is useful adjunct therapy for certain patients. It
is not a case that people will be able to waltz into their GP surgery
and get naltrexone and be cured.''
''You can't force an alcoholic to give up if he or she shows not the
slightest bit of motivation,'' pointed out Dr Hughes.'' If they want to
but can't then naltrexone may and the operative word is may, be able to
help them.''
Despite all the excitment surrounding the drug in America, doctors
warn that patients do have to stay motivated to take it. ''If this drug
isn't used with a comprehensive treatment programme the failure rates
are very high,'' says Kurt Landgraf, president of manufacturers Du Pont
Merck.
''This drug improves our ability to treat people with alcohol
problems,'' says Charles O'Brien, professor and vice chairman of
psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania school of medicine in
Philadelphia. ''But in the absence of a good alcohol-treatment programme
this won't make much difference.''
Du Pont underline this is not a wonder drug: ''It's another tool to be
used in part of a rehabilitation programme.'' Joseph Volpicelli,
assistant professor of psychiatry and director of the Treatment Research
Center at the University of Pennslyvania says: ''Doctors now have a
novel medical approach available that significantly increases abstinence
rate and seems to reduce alcohol craving when used as part of a
comprehensive treatment programme.''
A 12 week double-blind study of 70 male alcoholics conducted by Dr
Volpicelli showed that only 23% of all patients treated with naltrexone
relapsed compared to 54% in the placebo group.
Another study of 104 men carried out at Yale University confirmed the
earlier findings. They went further and noted that patients who took
naltrexone were approximately twice as successful in their clinical
outcomes, including abstinence and relapse, as patients who received a
placebo.
''Naltrexone has been shown to be a valuable adjunct to counselling,
not a replacement for traditional psycho-social treatment,'' says
Stephanie O'Malley, associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University
School of Medicine. ''By combining these two interventions, we can be
more effective in helping many patients address their alcohol
problems.''
Other studies continue to give it a reasonable clean bill of health:
it's non-habit forming and the most common side effect was mild nausea
reported in 10% of patients. Certainly the introduction of naltrexone
marks a new era in the pharmacologic treatment of alcoholism.
Until now, the only drug on offer has been Antabuse which makes the
user nauseous after tasting a few drops of the hard stuff. If someone
wants to give up drinking, they've got to review their life, the experts
agree. They have to identify the stresses and strains in their life
which lead them to reach for the bottle, and plan how they propose to
cope with these once they ''dry out''.
Should naltrexone get a licence for the use in alcohol abuse in this
country it will not be able to solve these problems. But it could be a
very useful short-term tool to help you through the withdrawal symptoms
of the chemical addiction.

Nation of binge drinkers affecting one family in 10
BEFORE you take another drink, here are some statistics to digest: the
Scots' reputation for heavy drinking is a myth.
But we are a nation of binge drinkers triggered off by social problems
such as unemployment, poverty, and urban deprivation.
One family in 10 suffers from the serious effects of alcohol.
Or, put another way, 4% of adults between 20-65 years are drinking at
levels likely to damage their health.
Translated into Scottish statistics that works out at 9600 Glaswegians
drinking at a level likely to damage their health.
Or a mind-boggling 66,000 men in Scotland are drinking to excess.
It's hardly surprising therefore that one third of all hospital beds
are taken up with drink-related diseases.
Some studies show heart attack rates are reduced with moderate
drinking. So how do you define moderate?
A safe maximum for drinking is 21 units a week for men or 14 for
women. A unit is one pint of beer, two of spirits, or two glasses of
wine.
If you think you have a drink problem ask yourself the following
questions:
* Have you ever felt you should cut down your drinking?
* Do you get ratty when people say you are drinking too much?
* Do you wake up thinking you shouldn't have drunk so much?
* Do you need the ''hair of the dog'' that bit you to get going the
next morning?
If you answered yes to any two of these then you need some help. Go
along to your doctor for advice or contact any of the organisations
listed below.

<HEADLINE>Blood test 'can predict rheumatic condition'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979714255</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A RESEARCH team has developed a simple blood test as a predictor of a
crippling rheumatic condition which affects more than five million
people in Britain.
The discovery is seen as a breakthrough in the identification and
treatment of osteoarthritis.
In the world's largest study of its kind, researchers at Bristol Royal
Infirmary found higher than normal levels of protein material in the
blood of osteoarthritis patients.
They believe the material not only identifies the groups at risk but
may point to a research pathway leading to drug and treatment regimes.
The findings are shortly to be published in medical journals in
Britain and America.
However, the test was revealed yesterday by Professor Paul Dieppe, of
the Department of Rheumatology at the infirmary.
He was outlining results from the 10-year study of 500 patients with
arthritis.
In addition to the blood test discovery, researchers also found that
arthritis was not just one disease as previously thought, but a number
of different disorders.
They also revealed that the condition of osteoarthritis sufferers does
not always worsen. It can improve.
Osteoarthritis is the most widespread type of rheumatic disorder,
affecting more than one in 10 people in Britain.
It is responsible for 50% of all joint replacement operations.
Professor Dieppe said: ''If you can predict from the blood test then
you can give a prognosis. We believe we are getting pretty close to the
process that reflects why joint damage is occurring. The process that is
generating the blood factors must be the process that is causing the
damage.
''That can lead us to understanding the mechanisms and providing a
strategy for prevention.''

TWENTY-SEVEN Crown Post Offices in Scotland are to be closed and sold
off within the next financial year, according to a senior source within
PO Counters, the Communications Workers Union said yesterday.
The leak comes as PO Counters employees in Glasgow and district
prepare to stage their second 24-hour strike on Monday week in protest
at the closure and sell-off programme which has seen 130 Crown offices
close in Scotland since 1988.
The CWU predicts that at the current rate of closures Scotland will
have no Crown Post Offices at all by the end of 1997. However, PO
Counters last night sought to dismiss the claims as ''scare-mongering
nonsense'' that would only cause alarm to staff and customers alike.
Scottish general manager Wendy Goldstraw declared: ''We are totally
committed to preserving the network of 2135 Post Offices in Scotland''
although, she added, this might mean changing the status of some wholly
owned POs and providing locations more in tune with shopping preferences
through partnership with retailers.
The union, created last month from the merger of the Union of
Communications Workers and the National Communications Union,
immediately seized upon the fact that Mrs Goldstraw never once mentioned
Crown POs in her statement. It claimed that it was verification that the
leak, from a previously reliable source, was accurate.
Mr Liam Murphy, CWU counters secretary for Scotland and Northern
Ireland, stressed that the union had never accused the PO of seeking to
dismantle the network, but of privatising Crown Offices by the back
door.
The union says it already has identified 10 of the offices to be
closed and is demanding that PO Counters ''come clean'' by publishing
its secret hit-list.
Those identified as being earmarked for closure are Glasgow George
Square, Saltcoats, Wishaw, Bellshill, Aberdeen Torry, Edinburgh Wester
Hailes, Possilpark, Greenock Cathcart Street, Greenock Nicholson Street,
and Wick.
Mr Murphy descibed the closure of dedicated, publicly owned Crown Post
Offices as a national disgrace and said that PO managers should have the
decency to reveal their plans to the public rather than doing deals to
sell off post offices behind closed doors.
''Despite the victory over PO privatisation last year, the industry is
being privatised by stealth as our post offices are being taken over by
supermarkets and other retail chains,'' he said, adding that the whole
closure programme was shoddy, sordid, and dishonest.
Mrs Goldstraw replied that management had been totally frank about
what it was doing and why it was being done. She added that some 95% of
all post offices were now run on an agency basis in partnership with PO
Counters. The threatened industrial action in Glasgow and Strathclyde
would gain nothing and would only inconvenience customers.
The almost total lack of communication between management and union
was demonstrated by conflicting accounts of last December's 24-hour
stoppage.
Mrs Goldstraw claimed it was a flop, with only 20 POs out of 700 not
opening, and Mr Murphy was adamant that some 36 of the targeted Crown
Offices were closed with only nine kept open by managers shipped in from
as far as Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness, Edinburgh and even Northern
Ireland.
The union and the Post Office did agree, however, that the
introduction of new technology was resulting in almost all first class
and much of the second class post being handled in first deliveries in a
growing number of areas.

A FERRY design which a Glasgow University research team believes could
have prevented the Estonia and Herald of Free Enterprise disasters was
demonstrated in public last night for the first time.
The ''perforated deck'' system allows water on a roll-on, roll-off
ferry deck to run directly to the lowest part of the hull and prevent
the vessel from capsizing.
A team at Glasgow University, led by Mr Ian Winkle, senior lecturer at
the department of naval architecture and ocean engineering, has been
working on this type of design for several years.
Now it is hoping that maritime authorities and ship owners can be
persuaded to adopt their system and, it claims, prevent repeats of
disasters like the Herald of Free Enterprise, which capsized with the
loss of more than 190 lives as she sailed from the Belgian port of
Zeebrugge in 1987, and the Estonia, which sank in the Baltic Sea last
year, drowning more than 900 people.
''My own view is that if such a vessel was carefully designed to this
concept, then neither accident would have happened,'' said Mr Winkle
yesterday.
''With this design, it is possible to absorb very large quantities of
water and just gradually sink to a point where the incoming and outgoing
water should be in balance. The upper decks would not sink below the
water.''
Earlier versions of the team's design posed some fire safety problems
because the space left for water could in other circumstances spread
flames and smoke. This was apparently one reason why the Department of
Transport shelved earlier proposals.
However, the team believes those problems have been overcome by
incorporating one-way valves. It has kept the Department of Transport
and the International Maritime Organisation informed of its work. The
IMO holds its annual meeting in London in the spring and Mr Winkle is
hoping its technical committees will consider his team's new proposals.
He said: ''The problem is persuading any owners to take this
seriously. Safety costs money. If you want a safe ship, you have to pay
more money for it and that implies higher fares and other things. It is
more expensive because you have two hulls instead of one -- you have an
inner shell and an outer one.''
The new design was demonstrated at a public lecture at the university.
The audience saw two ferry models sunk in a water tank. One represented
a conventional design with wide sealed decks on which the water built up
to one side. The team showed how it could capsize even in calm
conditions.
The slow and level sinking of the other model demonstrated the greater
safety of the new design.

<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke yesterday plunged the Government back into
controversy over Europe by insisting that John Major was not a
Euro-sceptic.
Mr Clarke -- in an interview with Euro Briefing, a magazine published
by Tory Euro MPs -- said the Prime Minister's views on Europe were
''indistinguishable'' from his own.
The Chancellor's comments will enrage Tory Euro-sceptics who have been
gunning for him since he said a single European currency need not lead
to a federal superstate.
He also came out strongly against a referendum on Europe, a claim
which is unlikely to have been welcomed by Mr Major who has consistently
refused to rule one out.
The Prime Minister, who has been moving increasingly towards the
Euro-sceptics, is also unlikely to be pleased by Mr Clarke's attempt to
associate him with his own views on the issue.
Mr Clarke said both he and the Prime Minister wanted to see Britain
working at the heart of Europe while at the same time standing up for
British interests.
The Chancellor went on to stress the potential benefits of a single
currency saying that Britain should keep its options open while playing
a full part in discussions about how it would work.
''A single currency could lead to stronger trade and investment links
to the benefit of all. We could benefit from being part of a Europe-wide
low inflation zone,'' he said.
''We should also have a sensible and informed debate on the subject so
that Parliament can make a careful choice on whether it would be in
Britain's interests to join any proposed scheme.''

THE introduction of a 50% rate on vacant buildings will undoubtedly
create as many problems as it solves, as Stewart McIntosh's article
suggests (February 9), through deliberate damage by landlords seeking
exemption.
It is, however, an acknowledgement of the crass irrationality of our
rating system which penalises efficient use of premises while rewarding
dilapidation and dereliction.
Just when will our legislators see the futility of endless tinkering
with a system that is fundamentally flawed because it fails to recognise
land as a separate element of what we loosely describe as ''property''?
The solution is surely to levy rates on site values alone. With
assessment based on development potential within prevailing planning
constraints, there would be no exemptions for under-used or idle land
but no charge at all on buildings.
Optimum permitted use of land would be stimulated and speculative
values would be destroyed as land held out of use would be a financial
burden on its owner -- the more valuable the land the greater the
burden.
In an earlier article Stewart McIntosh reported on the fierce
competition among builders for available sites, with 9% of land within
Glasgow held derelict.
This is unacceptable, with the resulting inflated land prices
reflected in higher housing costs while windfall gains are eventually
enjoyed by landowners whose calculated inactivity has caused the
artificial shortage.
The result in the meantime is increased development pressure on
greenbelt land and increased cost to the taxpayer of new infrastructure
to serve expanding urban areas.
As one loophole in the present system is closed, another opens. And so
it will go on until politicians are prepared to admit that the system
itself is chronically defective.

BRIAN WILSON writes at length on the marked proven difference of life
expectancy of the lowest social class as opposed to the upper (February
17).
He assumes that lack of income is the whole and only cause. He
produces no evidence that the relationship is so. He may well be right,
in which case only a significant rise in incomes will solve the problem.
If he is wrong there will be no benefit. In fact the position may be
worsened by increasing the already high incidence of drinking and
smoking.
I do not believe that income is the cause and, unlike Brian Wilson, I
shall give reasons for my beliefs. From 1949 to 1979 I was the medical
officer of Polmont Borstal Institution. In that time I took the medical
history of, and examined, at least 25,000 of Scotland's teenage
delinquent youth.
Nearly all came from the social class in question. I was struck by the
numbers suffering from significant disabilities for which they had never
sought treatment. These conditions included vision defects, squints,
nasal polyps, long-standing discharging ears, unhealthy tonsils, bad
dental state, hernia, undescended testis, varicose veins, body lice, and
scabies.
By the efforts of the institution dentist and Falkirk Royal Infirmary
they willingly accepted treatment for their disabilities. Remember,
treatment at home was free.
I have no statistics to prove it, but I am confident that it was
exceptional for me to obtain a history of the treatment of any of these
conditions from the other inmates.
I think they have a different attitude to health matters from most
people -- almost, one might say, an inborn inherited one which will only
slowly and with difficulty be altered for the better.
I have two ideas to deal with the problem. First, that there is a
large increase in the number of health visitors in the affected areas
and that they are based in the schools and not in the health centres.
They are instructed to visit all families under their responsibility
at a stated interval and that they take especial note of those reluctant
to be seen.
Secondly, that in the final school year there is a compulsory subject
on health matters and the rearing of children (from birth). To ensure
universal high standards of instruction, it should be done through the
medium of TV and supervised by the health visitors and not school
teachers.

THE current governor of Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow, Mr Peter Withers,
has been appointed director of custody for the Scottish Prison Service
based at the agency's headquarters in Edinburgh.
This leaves his deputy, Mrs Kate Donegan, as one of a select band of
front runners for the governor's post.
0 The prison is constantly overcrowded, possibly the busiest in
Britain and, as a result, suffers more than most from its Victorian
structure.
The fact that Mrs Donegan, 41, is instantly placed in the frame by
prison sources is a measure of the cultural changes which have taken
place in Scottish penal affairs during this decade.
At the same time, the Scottish prison population remains close to
record levels, pushing towards the 6000 mark. It is currently enjoying a
period of stability and progress towards which many other criminal
justice systems are casting envious eyes.
The Scottish Prison Service, formerly the largest single component of
the Scottish Office and now an executive agency, has gone outside its
own ranks to fill another of its top jobs. The post of director of
prisons for the north and east, and with it a seat on the prisons board,
has gone to civil servant Peter Russell, current head of the police
division of the Scottish Home and Health Department.
Mr Withers will also be on the prisons board, as will be Mr John
Pearce, the existing director for jails in the south and west of
Scotland.
The changes at the top follow the retiral from the SPS of Mr Alan
Walker, deputy director and himself formerly governor of Barlinnie. Mr
Walker is going to an advisory job with the European Union next month.
The new structure cuts out the deputy job and spreads decision-making
down the line.
Mr Withers beat off a number of other leading prison governors for the
custody directorship, including Mr Bill McKinlay, currently governor of
Polmont Young Offenders' Institution but with a prisons HQ background,
Mr Mike Duffy, current governor of the high-security, long-term Perth
Prison, and Mr Alec Spencer, governor of Peterhead Prison.
All three would be contenders for the Barlinnie job, along with Mrs
Donegan.

<TEXT>
CHANGES to the style of entertaining by senior defence staff and the
use of their official homes were signalled by Armed Forces Minister
Nicholas Soames in the Commons yesterday.
Mr Soames also paid tribute to Air Chief Marshal Sir Sandy Wilson,
whose early retirement was announced this month after a report on
#387,000 renovation work at his official residence -- Haymes Garth in
Gloucestershire.
The Minister told the House that a report into entertaining and the
use of residences is expected to be with the Government by the end of
the month.
''It may well be that there are aspects of the current arrangements
which we shall want to change in the future,'' he said.
His comments come after disclosures of thousands of pounds spent on
renovating senior officers' official residences where they carry out
entertaining duties.
The report is being prepared by leading businessman and former
chairman of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body Sir Peter Cazalet.
Mr Soames said burdens placed on senior officers who had to carry out
representational and social duties were ''very considerable''.
They represented ''an often unwelcome intrusion into their lives and
the lives of their families'', he added.
However, he emphasised: ''Our existing arrangements are intended to
enable senior officers to fulfil their official responsibilities which
are of great importance to the interests of this country.''

I AM sitting in a train and have just read Ian Dixon's letter
(February 15). I can only assume he wrote it tongue in cheek. I hope so,
for I should be incomparably disadvantaged if his thoughts were
translated into action.
I am travelling from Thurso, my home, to London, my place of business,
and this remote railway is in truth a lifeline.
I need it; I use it; I rely on it. And so do many others; just over
0.1% of the population of Caithness is on this one train on this one
day; average over a month and some 10-20% of the whole county will have
used the line. Certainly a significant proportion.
Mr Dixon further asserts that closure would have little impact on
tourism. This just is not true. About one-quarter of my fellow
travellers are tourists; in summer numbers swell 10 or 20 fold.
It is the very remoteness of the line which alike draws the tourist
and renders it an essential lifeline, far more precious, certainly more
important, than Mr Dixon believes.
Savings by closure? Certainly, but the sums if examined in a different
manner produce very changed consequences. Is it, for instance,
reasonable to claim that the cost of access to a mile of track in
Scotland should be many times as much as that for the South-east?
Yet this is exactly what is being done by Railtrack; necessarily so if
it is to be split into franchise areas.
At the Grouping of 1922/23 it was recognised that no Scottish railway
could be financially sound and Scottish lines were merged with English
partners to spread costs. Reversing this process can only lead to
extravagant apparent cost increases.
Mr Dixon pays the same track access charges (road tax) in St Fillans
as does his counterpart in St Albans, and why not, for the road system
is a national resource open to all. But why then should the rail-road be
treated in such a very different fashion?
The figures quoted for the ''subsidy'' for every West Highland sleeper
passenger take on a very changed complexion if the accounting is
performed on a different basis.
I plead with Mr Dixon to recognise that the lines he dismisses so
lightly have a very real part to play in the lives of many people in
these parts and that very serious hardship to very many people would be
the inevitable consequence of closure.

I WRITE to alert your readers to the implementation of the
Construction (Design and Management) regulations, 1994, on March 31.
This will have potentially serious consequences for all building owners
outwith the residential owner-occupied sector.
These regulations, which will apply to virtually all construction,
maintenance -- including window cleaning -- and demolition work, require
clients to appoint a planning supervisor to co-ordinate the health and
safety plan for the project and to ensure the appointment of competent
and adequately resourced designer(s) and principal contractor.
The limited exemptions are for very short projects and, generally, the
residential owner-occupied sector; although demolition (yet to be
defined) is always covered.
The planning supervisor role is a new one, and the Royal Incorporation
of Architects in Scotland has recently sponsored the establishment of
the Association of Planning Supervisors to act as a forum and centre of
excellence for those throughout the UK intending to specialise in this
function.
Criminal and civil liability flow from breaches of the regulations,
which the health and safety executive sees as a major tool in tackling
the poor safety record in the construction industry. All building owners
should therefore be considering this new set of regulations,
particularly if they are contemplating any construction work in the next
year.
The RIAS would be happy to advise further.

EMPLOYMENT discrimination and barriers between men's and women's jobs
continue despite 20 years of equality legislation, according to a report
published yesterday by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The study found segregation in workplaces ''striking''. In particular,
jobs in retail, clothing, and service industries were done mostly by
women while skilled staff and senior professional, technical, and
managerial employees tended to be male.
The survey said women working with other women tended to be paid less
while men working with other men got higher salaries and that employers
often were unaware of the problem.
Over two-thirds of the workplaces surveyed did not collect information
about the gender and ethnicity of their workforce and of those that did
only one in 10 shared the information with their employees.
The EOC's chairwoman, Ms Kamlesh Bahl, said that despite 20 years of
equality legislation, discrimination in employment continued and the
barrier between men's and women's jobs remained entrenched.
She warned that businesses were exposing themselves to financial
liabilities in the form of sex discrimination and equal pay claims
which, given the compensation awards for unlawful discrimination, were
risks that businesses needed to address.
The commission urged firms to monitor their workforces by gender and
ethnicity, introduce an equal opportunities policy which would be
monitored with information shared with the workforce, examine pay
structures to see whether sex discrimination was operating, and use
positive action training to redress past discrimination against women as
a means of breaking down job segregation.

THE people of Northern Ireland, who have suffered much, deserve a
lasting peace. They deserve stability, prosperity, normality, and most
of all an end to the debilitating ache of fear. One way to achieve these
things has been laid before them by Mr Major and the Prime Minister of
Ireland. It is a complex way and only a fool would suggest it will be
easy. It is a way which will require courage and persistence, but the
prospect of a return to the mayhem of recent years must summon up those
qualities. Above all, it is a way which is open to every citizen of
Northern Ireland, and each and every one must honour his or her own
humanity by examining it seriously. A further step must be asked of the
people, and it is perhaps the hardest thing which could be demanded of
them. Somehow they must divorce their consideration of this new
framework for agreement from the bitter disagreements of the past. One
thing, above all, will help them; it is the new context in which this
document has been produced.
That context is peace. It has been manifest for the past six months
and it has been accompanied by a cautious flowering of spirit in
Northern Ireland. This alone makes the new framework different from
every flawed and failed effort which has preceded it. Mention has been
made of Sunningdale, but that attempt took place at a time of turbulence
and civil disobedience. Nor were relations between the British and Irish
Governments then at anything near the level of sense and creativity
achieved in recent months. Yet if we have new hope, and a context in
which hope is both realistic and constructive, those beginnings must be
bolstered and built around with solid proposals. The first must be
constitutional. The Irish Government will give up its claim to the North
which is held in its constitution; the British Government will alter the
Government of Ireland Act 1920 to accept the will of the majority of the
people of Northern Ireland as to whether they wish to remain as part of
Britain or to opt to be part of a united Ireland. This much was expected
and is proper for it leaves Northern Ireland effectively free to
determine its own future.
From this, other things flow naturally, such as a new Northern Ireland
Assembly with decent powers but, curiously, no tax-raising capability.
Few institutions have been regarded with more suspicion than Northern
Ireland assemblies of the past, and rightly so. They enshrined the
inequalities of life which led to unrest and violence. That is why
proportional representation as the system of election for the new
assembly is so vital. Largely scorned and disregarded in the rest of
Britain, PR will give the assembly a proper spread of representation.
Never again will there be permanent minorities and exultant majorities
and the result will be a democracy which Northern Ireland as a whole
will relish. Less certain in its benefits is the possible panel of three
representatives elected by PR to monitor the assembly and ensure fair
play. On this, we note that the person who achieved the most votes under
PR for the European Assembly from Northern Ireland was Mr Ian Paisley.
The panel should not be necessary if there are sufficient checks and
balances built into the proposals for the assembly.
More controversial by far is the proposal for a cross-border
institution, for this is the stuff of unionist nightmares. The proposals
are unclear and would be consolidated by negotiation and agreement if at
all. Basically, the body appears to be designed to deal with European
Union matters and perhaps with a range of issues including agriculture
and tourism. In the past, unionists have refused even to contemplate
such a body but they should note that the proposals envisage that all
decisions reached by the body would be by agreement between the two
sides. That is surely a guarantee that nothing could be decided without
the agreement of the Northern Ireland representatives.
As expected, a good deal of heat and fury has already been poured over
the proposals. Those who habitually rant and speak in capital letters
have done so, and continued in wilder vein last night. Nevertheless it
is difficult to understand some of the public pronouncements, at least,
of the unionists. Mr Robinson of the DUP describes the proposals as an
eviction notice to leave the UK. The normally admirable Mr Maginnis of
the Ulster Unionists speaks of being taken back 10 years. These cannot
be taken seriously. Nevertheless, there had been a sense of willingness
by many unionists to continue talking, and this was exemplified by Mr
Molyneaux, who is a good deal more supple than he would like us to
think, and by the production by unionists of their alternative
proposals. All of this gave hope, and was further strengthened by Mr
Molyneaux's curious hints of a good deal of co-operation recently
between the unionists and nationalist SDLP leader John Hume. Whether
this will survive the united unionist fury last night is a different
question.
In a real sense Mr John Major shone yesterday. His strength is in the
detail, and in Northern Ireland he shows a mastery of his brief and a
dogged commitment to make it work. Nor is he lacking in subtlety. He has
promised, time and again, that his aim is to encourage discussion and
that nothing will be forced. The banner of triple consent, that of the
representative parties, of the people, and of Parliament, is waved at
every opportunity, and rightly so. Now he must continue to talk with all
legitimate representatives of Northern Ireland life for as long as is
necessary. Every unionist proposal should be examined seriously and the
momentum of events must be maintained. Yet, in the end, it is the people
of Northern Ireland who will decide on a new dispensation. The future of
the proposals rests with them this morning and in their hands lies the
future of their land. It is a heavy burden, but it is worth while for it
is what makes any decent, peaceful democracy worth while.

A WOMAN whose husband suffers from Tourette's Syndrome, an illness
which compels him to shout and swear, ended up living in a car with five
young children, the Court of Session heard yesterday.
Mr Desmond McAulay and his wife Elizabeth claimed that they had been
forced to leave their council house because neighbours tormented and
abused them. The couple petitioned for a judicial review of their case.
They asked the court to order Dumbarton District Council to rehouse
them because they were forced to leave their home at Redburn, Bonhill,
Dumbarton, last November because of neighbourhood harassment.
Last night, council officials pledged to rehouse the family.
The couple claimed they were homeless through no fault of their own.
They said that a council official, Mr Rolando Tamborini, who interviewed
them last October, had dismissed a written record of neighbourhood
harassment which they had submitted to him.
The couple said neighbours had smashed their windows and youths
threatened them with wooden batons. Their walls also were daubed with
graffiti and red paint was poured on their car, and the car locks and
house doors stuck with superglue.
They claimed that on November 24 last year Mrs McAulay telephoned the
housing department pleading to be rehoused. She said she was told: ''The
only way you could be rehoused is if someone puts a shotgun through your
door.''
The court heard that the family moved out of their home in November
and rented a caravan in Dumbarton at #132 a week.
Mr Mungo Bovey, advocate for the family, said: ''It is unfortunate
that Mr McAulay suffers from the scourge, the illness Tourette's
Syndrome.''
He added that Mr McAulay was jailed yesterday for three months for
breach of the peace.
Mrs McAulay and the children had moved out of the caravan and had been
sleeping in a car. She had managed to get some money for bed and
breakfast accommodation.
Mr Robert Sutherland, counsel for Dumbarton District Council, said the
family had been in five other houses and had to move because of trouble
with neighbours.
The council said the McAulays were not homeless and should remain in
their home in Bonhill.
After an adjournment, Mr Sutherland said lawyers had had further
discussions with Dumbarton Housing Department on the telephone and it
had agreed to rehouse Mrs McAulay and the children on a temporary basis
while her husband was in prison.
Lord Milligan said he was satisfied the case should be continued if
the housing department had given an assurance it would find temporary
accommodation for the family.

The widow of Labour leader John Smith yesterday took her seat in the
Lords. Margaret Vaughan reports
IT is not the life she would have chosen. The price Elizabeth Smith
paid to take her talents into the public realm was a personal tragedy so
profound, so terrible, that there can be no compensations.
Yesterday the Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill began the new life that
came with the loss of the old. Together with her role as a peer came the
news that she is to join the Press Complaints Commission. It seems the
healing has begun.
Some months after the loss of her husband, she spoke movingly of the
life they shared and said, simply, that given another chance, she would
do it all the same again. To be able to look back after such a loss and
say there are no regrets is a sign that the first shock of grief has
given way to some acceptance that, while the deep pain remains, the
wound is less raw.
Moving out of the shadows of grief is not easy for anyone. Moving into
the spotlight is testing enough when inner resolve is strong. For
someone who, though gregarious with her own, holds on to a determination
to remain an intensely private public person, it must involve risks, and
a delicate juggling trick, to cling to the intense conviction that she
can screen her inner self from the outer demands of public life.
When she took her seat in the House of Lords yesterday, the new
Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill did so knowing that the honour was given
in recognition of the respect in which her late husband was held. Her
chosen title is a memorial to their student years at Glasgow University,
to the place where they came together. Wider acknowledgment of the
talents she brings to public life will come when she begins to make her
own contribution. She has to graft a new identity on to the image of the
widow of the lost Labour leader.
Lady Smith wore the traditional ermine-trimmed scarlet parliamentary
robes for the short ceremony, watched from the Bar of the House by her
daughters Sarah, Jane, and Catherine.
Also lending support were the close friends who have surrounded her
since last May: Donald Dewar and Helen Liddell watched from the wings,
along with Hilary Armstrong, John Smith's former Parliamentary Private
Secretary who went to the Barbican flat to be with Elizabeth the morning
he died.
The new baroness was congratulated by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay
of Clashfern, to a resounding ''Hear, hear!'' from peers. As she passed
Labour former Prime Minister Lord Callaghan, he grasped her hand and
smiled reassuringly.
She has avowed disinterest, in her role in the Lords, in making pure
party politics her cause although she remains intent, as she made clear
in a statement after receiving the peerage in the New Year honours, that
she wanted to work for the Labour government her husband strived for.
''In the House of Lords I hope to make my own contribution through
taking an active interest in policy for the arts and working for the
Labour government that John wanted to see,'' she said then.
It was her husband who championed social justice. She wants to use her
peerage as a platform to support national creativity and help people,
like young film-makers and fashion designers find backing for their
ideas.
She is likely to be a doughty champion. For, her friends insist,
beneath the calm, detached picture she presents is a passionate
determination to succeed. It would be wrong to imagine she was simply
her husband's prop. Those who know her say she was a parallel intellect
in the partnership, always an individual in her own right.
It is that deep intelligence and some insight she will bring to her
other new role -- still to be publicly confirmed -- as one of eight lay
members and seven press representatives on the Press Complaints
Commission, under the new chairmanship of former Thatcher fixer Lord
Wakeham.
When he served as Tory Chief Whip, one of Lord Wakeham's prime
functions was to keep stories out of the papers. As she cheerfully
admits, when he was minister for banana skins in Mrs Thatcher's
Government, the only stories which got into print were the slip ups.
His unflappability is seen as more likely to preserve self-regulation
than the impassioned approach of his predecessor, Lord McGregor of
Durris who dropped his own banana skins.
The increase in lay members of the calibre of Elizabeth Smith are seen
as a further bulwark against intense pressure for privacy laws. The
sober figure of Lord Wakeham and the cool detachment of Lady Smith would
be unlikely to be found on the steps of the Salisbury Square offices
condemning journalists for ''dabbling their fingers in the stuff of
other people's souls''.
The commission role will involve Lady Smith in sifting through sheafs
of papers, every week, containing the decisions made by the commission
staff. She will be able to make objections, to put forward her own views
on adjudications and discuss the major issues in press coverage as they
arise.
Coverage of the royal family has been the bane, and last year almost
the downfall, of the PCC. Lord Wakeham does not ooze sympathy for the
royal family, reasoning that while they are entitled to personal privacy
to go about their private business, they are a public institution to
which the press are entitled to turn their attentions. That may well be
a view shared by his new lay member.
Her combined new roles will inevitably mean even more time spent in
London, in the new flat in the Barbican she moved into after her
husband's death. Her schedule is likely to be hectic. For on top of the
new jobs is her commitment to establish a prestigious lecture series in
memory of her husband. She also visits Russia up to four times a year,
retaining her contact with a culture and a social history which has
fascinated her throughout her adult life.
After university, where she read French and Russian, she had spent
some time working for the Great Britain/USSR Association. In the early
1980s the organisation was looking for a part-time worker based in
Scotland. Fluent in Russian, she fitted the bill. She was the moving
spirit behind the St Andrews Foundation, set up to revive the historic
links between Scotland and Russia. The foundation has developed a wider
base than its original cultural links and now helps train young Russian
entrepreneurs and managers. She is keen to help transfer British
expertise into the fledgling market economy.
For her part, speaking of life with her husband of 26 years,
Elizabeth once said: ''Everything I've ever done was with him, beside
him, behind him.'' Now she walks alone into a new life.

A PASSENGER and a stewardess were slightly injured last night after an
aircraft slid off the runway at Aberdeen airport during a landing.
The incident happened after the British Airways Advanced Turbo Prop en
route from Manchester to Aberdeen with 32 passengers and four crew burst
a tyre and left the runway.
During an emergency evacuation one passenger and a stewardess suffered
minor injuries and were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary as a
precaution.
A British Airways spokeswoman said a full investigation would be
carried out into the incident.
* THE pilot of a Cessna light aircraft made an emergency forced
landing yesterday in the Borders.
He came down on a 1700ft hillside five miles south of Peebles after
failing to clear the summit. The pilot was shaken but not believed to be
injured.
An RAF Sea King helicopter from Boulmer in Northumberland located the
pilot and flew him to Melrose Hospital for a check-up.

THE scramble for the top posts in local government after council
reorganisation is officially under way.
It started yesterday when a letter was sent from the Local Government
Staff Commission to all Scottish councils and new town development
corporations inviting applications for the posts of chief executive in
the 29 new single-tier councils.
Excluding the three unchanged islands authorities, whose officials can
nevertheless apply for one of the new posts if they wish, the present 62
chief executives on the mainland will be reduced to 29 after April 1996
when the new councils assume full control.
The salaries for the new jobs range from #96,000 for Glasgow District
Council to #58,000 in the smallest authorities.
There is to be no public advertising of the jobs as Government
Ministers and the commission decided that only serving officers in local
government or the new towns would be eligible to apply at this stage.
It was thought the new councils should make the maximum use of the
experience of staff from the previous authorities.
The new shadow councils to be elected on April 6 can, however, decide
to throw the employment net wider and advertise on their own account.
The top council posts in England, where the reorganisation is less
extensive, are being filled by open competition.
The public services union, Unison, said yesterday it approved of the
way matters were being handled in Scotland.
Mr Mark Irvine, its head of local government in Scotland, said: ''Our
view is that the restricted competition at this stage recognises the
wholesale changes which are about to occur in Scottish local government
and the need to protect the interests of existing staff.''

THE world's oldest surviving railway viaduct, which was built over the
River Irvine in Ayrshire in 1811, yesterday was saved from collapse by
the completion of a #1m funding package.
Work to refurbish the Laigh Milton viaduct near Kilmarnock, regarded
as an outstanding example of early British civil engineering, is
expected to begin next month and finish within a year.
The A-listed sandstone structure is in a fragile state, but full
restoration is thought possible, allowing it to become an important
landmark for tourists and students of engineering.
Professor Roland Paxton, secretary of the viaduct conservation project
trust, and professor of civil engineering at Heriot-Watt University in
Edinburgh, said yesterday that it had taken three years to secure the
necessary funds.
The latest, and largest, donation is a grant of up to #400,000 from
the Heritage Memorial Fund. Historic Scotland has pledged almost
#300,000, and a further #200,000 has been obtained from the European
Commission.
Other contributions have come from Strathclyde region, which is to
adopt the viaduct, and from Kyle and Carrick District Council,
Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Council, and Enterprise Ayrshire.
Barr Ltd of Ayr has been awarded the design and build contract, worth
almost #1m, for the work.

<HEADLINE>Inquest finds drip feeds killed two children</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979714272</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE parents of two children who died of a blood infection contracted
from hospital drip feeds were last night considering legal action after
an inquest jury returned accidental death verdicts.
Leukemia sufferers Timothy Davies, nine, and five-year-old Belinda
Coffey became infected through intravenous feeds at the Royal Manchester
Children's Hospital.
They died in April 1994 after earlier undergoing chemotherapy
treatment.
The inquest at Salford, Greater Manchester, heard that they were
infected by the enterobacter cloacae micro-organism. Investigators found
that the bacteria colonised a sink trap where drip feeds were prepared.
An expert believed that when the mixer taps were turned on there was
an aerosol effect which carried the organism from the ''foul smelling
sink'' to nearby shelves where the feeds were stored.
Coroner John Rhodes told the jury of four men and four women that they
could either return verdicts of accidental death or natural causes. They
took 15 minutes to reach accident verdicts.
The jury was earlier told that staff disinfected bottles of fluids
used to drip feed patients, but it was found that the bug had infected
two lines of tubing.
The germs entered the feed and killed the children. Two other patients
who were also infected survived.
The inquest heard the hospital had now changed its methods for
preparing drip feeds.
After the inquest, solicitor John Dewhurst, representing Timothy
Davies' parents, said: ''They are relieved that the inquest has been
concluded. They wish to express their agreement with the jury that Tim's
death was not caused by natural causes.''
Stephanie Forman, representing Belinda Coffey's family, said they were
''extremely distressed by the evidence which they have heard at today's
inquest''.
They believed that Belinda's death could and should have been avoided
with higher standards of cleanliness and sterility.

Today we believe in the magical power of antibiotics. But new strains
of bacteria are challenging that view
BACTERIA are going to win the arms race with the pharmaceutical
companies. That is the stark news from the American Association for the
Advancement of Science this week. It comes from Bruce Levin, a respected
bacteriologist at Emory University in Georgia, who told delegates that
antibiotics are starting to lose their fight against new strains of
bacteria.
That is a view shared by Glasgow University bacteriologist, Dr David
Platt. He admitted yesterday that the city's hospitals are already
encountering bacterial infections which don't respond to most powerful
antibiotics. ''Up until now the drug companies have managed to keep up
with the rate at which the microbes evolve. But in the longer term, I
think the microbes are going to win. They are the dominant life form on
the planet.
''They outnumber us by many millions to one. They have an amazing
capacity to keep ahead of the game,'' says Platt, from his lab at
Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
It is too easy to forget what life was like before antibiotics: the
wards full of little children with infections, fighting for their lives;
the periodic scourges of tuberculosis, scarlet fever, meningitis, and
diphtheria, capable of devastating communities and felling whole
families in a few days. But while our grandparents grew up with a deep
fear of illness, we belong to that arrogant generation which believes
medical research has an answer for everything.
In particular, we believe in the magical power of antibiotics. As
Roger Odd, head of practice at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society puts it:
''A lot of people don't feel happy unless they come out of a surgery
with a prescription for antibiotics.'' It began with Alexander Fleming's
observation in 1928 that a fungus -- Penicillium notatum -- growing in a
laboratory dish could keep colonies of bacteria at bay. Penicillin and
its successors have bred in us an astonishing complacency about our
power to conquer infections.
In 1986 America's chief medical officer, the Surgeon General, blithely
told Congress: ''The time has come to close the book on infectious
diseases.''
He was wrong. The World Health Organisation is now warning that the
major bacterial infections of the past are on their way back. TB is
expected to kill 30 million people over the next 10 years. Why are bugs
on the warpath again?
Paradoxically, one reason appears to be the widespread overuse and
misuse of antibiotics, the very drugs once hailed as the cure for all
conceivable bacterial disease. In parts of the Far East and Latin
America antibiotics are still freely available over the counter. And in
the West, many doctors still pander to patients' expectations by
prescribing them, even when they are clearly inappropriate.
The most obvious example is their use for viral infections.
(Antibiotics can tackle bacteria which are single-celled organisms
dwelling in the fluid-filled cavities between human cells but are
powerless against viruses, which are fragments of genetic material
living inside human cells.)
Between 1980 and 1991 antibiotic prescriptions in England increased
from 43 million a year to nearly 70 million. Roger Odd of the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society says doctors are still too ready to prescribe
antibiotics, despite warnings about the dangers: ''Even with bacterial
organisms, other remedies can often be used to stem the infection and
allow the body's own mechanisms to fight it. Too often doctors are using
antibiotics as the first line of attack.''
Last year a report from the Parliamentary Office of Science and
Technology (Post) concluded that the overuse of antibiotics was
contributing to the spread of drug-resistant strains of bacteria. It
laid part of the blame for this on the marketing tactics of the
pharmaceutical companies, who have invested heavily in developing new
forms of antibiotic and then grown rich on selling them.
The report claims one reason for GPs prescribing more and dearer
antibiotics is the aggressive way they are sold. A family doctor
receives an average of more than one call a week from a drug company
rep. In the US there is evidence that doctors are prescribing
antibiotics regardless of whether they are needed, out of fear of being
sued. And yet the more courses of antibiotic an individual takes, the
more likely they are to show resistance to such drugs in the future.
According to David Platt, misuse is as big a problem as overuse:
''Many patients stop taking their tablets before completing the course,
or miss tablets in the middle. This means the organisms are being
exposed to less than enough to kill them all. And that means the
organisms with better ability to resist the antibiotic are the ones that
survive and start to multiply.'' This can lead to the emergence of a
more resistant strain of the infection, one that can't be treated with
the same antibiotic.
''In the past 20 years, we have seen progressive increases in
resistance,'' says Platt. And, though they have yet to reach Scotland,
in some parts of the world there are disease-causing bacteria which are
resistant to all known antibiotics.
Part of the problem is what can be described loosely as ''the sex life
of bacteria''. This is the free exchange of genetic material between
organisms and with it the information for developing antibiotic
resistance. Scientists have been amazed at how easily bacteria form
liaisons and pass on characteristics. These discoveries raise some truly
awful spectres for the future, particularly in the care of hospital
patients.
Whatever the standards of hygiene, a hospital is a breeding ground for
so-called ''superbugs'' -- organisms which can't be destroyed by most
antibiotics. According to Dr Platt there are three reasons for this:
first, hospital patients, because they are by definition sick, are more
vulnerable to infection. Second, more antibiotics are used in hospitals
than outside, providing the perfect environment for the development of
organisms which are resistant to them. Third, invasive modern medical
techniques, using instruments, catheters, and the like, can easily
transfer an organism lying on the skin into body tissue.
The organism doctors fear most is Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus),
which makes wounds go septic and causes blood poisoning. It is one of
the main causes of infection during treatment because it thrives on the
surfaces of medical devices such a pacemakers.
It has also proved to be frighteningly adept at changing its make-up
to outflank antibiotics. Around 30 years ago a new antibiotic,
methicillin, was introduced to tackle strains of S. aureus and other
bacteria which had become resistant to penicillin. Within 10 years S.
aureus had hit back with new strains and now methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus A (MRSA or Super Staph) is a serious problem in many
hospitals around the world, including Scottish hospitals.
At the moment the drug companies are one step ahead but only one.
Vancomycin is the antibiotic of last resort. So far. No patient has
presented with a Super Staph that can't be attacked by vancomycin but
doctors believe it is bound to happen sooner or later. In fact,
researchers at St Thomas's Hospital in London produced just such
bacteria in a lab experiment in 1991. It is held in a deep freeze under
lock and key.
''It's only a matter of time before vancomycin-resistant Staph A
starts occuring naturally. That's the nightmare,'' said Platt. Roger Odd
agrees: ''All we can do is pray for a new antibiotic.'' But he's not
optimistic.
In New York, with its high HIV positive and drug-using population, new
strains of tuberculosis are emerging, strains which are resistant to
even the most powerful antibiotics. One theory about this is that
drug-users aren't good at remembering to take their antibiotics. Many
stop and start again or forget to take tablets from time to time. This
gives new virulent strains of the infection a chance to take hold.
Why should we worry about an Aids patient in New York forgetting to
take his tablets? Two good reasons. First, new organisms multiply at an
astonishing speed in the human body, often doubling their number every
20 minutes. Second, they travel around the world at great speed because
of the ease of international travel. So New York's problem today is
Glasgow's problem next year or the year after.
It is hard to imagine a world without antibiotics or where they have
lost their power to keep us safe. Yet many bacteriologists believe we
are on the brink of a post-antimicrobial era. Antibiotics have bred in
us something far more sinister than complacency; something our children
and their children won't thank us for.
It may be too late for morals but if this story has one it is this: if
you are taking antibiotics don't stop before the course is finished. If
you aren't, think twice before asking for them the next time you get a
sore throat.

RECEIVERS have been called in to investigate the affairs of the
company which runs Powderhall Greyhound Stadium in Edinburgh, less than
a week after it was announced that a dispute over its future had been
resolved.
Speculation remains, however, on whether dog racing and speedway will
continue, despite a statement from the receivers that it was hoped to
resume the sports in the near future.
Edinburgh-based chartered accountants Kidsons Impey announced
yesterday that two of their officials had been appointed joint receivers
of the Scottish Greyhound Racing Company, which is headed by Mr Eddie
Ramsay.
Corporate recovery partner Matt Henderson said he still had to examine
the financial position of the company -- which was forced to stop
trading in January -- in detail but would be looking at the situation of
creditors.
The company's debts are estimated at #3.6m, he said.
Mr Ramsay had been locked in negotiations with brewers Bass Leisure
over #1.8m the company claimed he owed it, although it was said last
weekend the debt had been repaid.
At the height of the cash crisis, owners and trainers withdrew their
dogs, claiming that they had no confidence in Mr Ramsay and stating that
they hoped another buyer would take over the 70-year-old stadium.
They also said they feared it could close and be redeveloped as a
housing and office complex.
Mr Henderson added: ''The opening of late-night betting shops and more
television coverage of football have no doubt contributed to the
company's problems.''

SCOTTISH Homes has agreed to pay tenants in Fort William's Plantation
estate a heating allowance because the agency stripped houses of their
insulation and has not yet replaced it.
This follows a Herald report in December which highlighted the plight
of around 150 families in the Plantation who had lost their insulation
and were now facing serious dampness, associated health problems and
greatly increased fuel bills.
Scottish Homes had emabarked on a programme of upgrading of the houses
but had removed the insulation from 148, without replacing it in any. It
had refused to make any allowance for extra heating costs, insisting
that the insulation had been of little use in most houses.
This was contrary to the tenants' experience.
Following a series of meetings at the turn of the year Scottish Homes
conceded that account should be taken of the extra heating costs which
some tenants feared could be 50% higher than normal.

fined #350 at Perth Sheriff Court yesterday. James Mitchell, 36, of
Wester Tullybannocher, Comrie, was also disqualified from keeping horses
for three years. He admitted causing the pony unnecessary suffering by
failing to provide it with adequate veterinary treatment. Mrs Therese
Oswald, depute fiscal, said that a vet, called to the farm by an SSPCA
inspector, was forced to destroy the pony after finding that it was
severely emaciated. Grossly overgrown teeth had prevented it eating
properly and in the vet's opinion the condition was long-standing and a
blatant case of neglect.

ROBERT Bolt, twice an Oscar winner and perhaps the finest screen
writer Britain ever produced, has died at the age of 70.
Though he had been in poor health for several years, he continued to
write with a passion. Shortly before his death he completed work on a
film about Richard Nixon for a US television network and he was in the
process of adapting Jung Chang's prize-winning novel, Wild Swans, for
the BBC.
He died at his home near Petersfield, Hampshire. His wife, the actress
Sarah Miles, was at his side.
In a distinguished writing career spanning almost 40 years, Robert
Bolt will be remembered as an epic storyteller. Through his long and
fruitful collaboration with director David Lean he made a series of
grand-scale films which, when looked at historically, represent what was
once great about British cinema. He won Academy Awards for Dr Zhivago
and A Man For All Seasons. He was also Oscar-nominated for Lawrence of
Arabia.
Born in Sale and educated at Manchester Grammar School and Manchester
University, he became a history teacher, working in a village school for
eight years. His love of writing, however, drew him to the stage and he
had his first play, Flowering Cherry, produced in a London theatre in
1958.
Two years later he become a full-time playwright, establishing his
reputation with A Man For All Seasons, the story of Sir Thomas More
which captured brilliantly the torment of a man torn between conscience
and power. It went on to win the New York Drama Critics' Award in 1962.
The Broadway production became the first stage play to make more than
$1m in its first 25 weeks.
In 1966 Bolt's own screenplay adaptation was made into a film by Fred
Zinnemann. It won five Oscars, among them best film, best screenplay,
and best director. It was Bolt's second Academy Award. His partnership
with Lean had already earned him a nomination for Lawrence of Arabia
(1962) and an Oscar for Dr Zhivago (1965).
Among the other films he wrote were Ryan's Daughter (again with Lean
directing in 1970), and Lady Caroline Lamb (which he directed himself in
1972). He scripted The Bounty in 1984 and in 1986 he adapted his own
novel, The Mission, for the screen. It won him a Golden Globe Award.
But while his fame was at its height, his private life became
increasingly turbulent. The passion which shone through in his writing
was also present in his political views. In 1961, he was jailed along
with Bertrand Russell for refusing to keep the peace at a CND rally.
He divorced his first wife -- the mother of two daughters and a son --
in 1967, marrying the actress Sarah Miles in the same year. He had met
her on the set of Ryan's Daughter. Their often stormy marriage produced
one son and lasted until 1976. Three years later Bolt suffered a massive
stroke.
''I really did everything possible to ensure that I had the stroke,''
he said later, describing his appetite for whisky, wine, and cigarettes.
But, with a determination one might expect to find only in one of his
stage characters, he fought back against the stroke's debilitating
effects, which included a severe speech impediment.
He was married again in 1980, to the actress Anne Zane, but they were
divorced in 1985. Bolt remarried Ms Miles secretly, after she moved back
to live with and help care for him.

A 34-YEAR-OLD man has been arrested in connection with the deaths of
seven-year-old Jonathan Copley and his teenage babysitter Rachel Rooney.
Police in Bradford, West Yorkshire, said the man would be interviewed
at Bradford Central police station.
Jonathan and Rachel, 15, were found with their throats slit in a house
at Little Horton, Bradford, early on Sunday. Rachel, of Queensbury, was
left alone for the first time on Saturday to babysit for Jonathan at his
terraced home.
His mother, Denise, and the rest of the family -- including Mrs
Copley's boyfriend, Mr Brian McDonagh, and her daughter Elizabeth, 15 --
went to a private party. The two youngsters were found stabbed to death
in an upstairs bedroom after the family returned home.
Police said there was no sign of a break-in.
Rachel lived with her mother, Christina, teenage brother and sister,
and her mother's partner, Mr Tariq Rehman.

A HOSPITAL was last night condemned for its ''outrageous'' decision to
allow burger chain McDonald's to open an outlet there.
As exclusively revealed in The Herald earlier this month, the Southern
General Hospital NHS Trust had been holding talks with the company about
taking over a unit in its shopping mall which is currently occupied by a
cafeteria run by the Red Cross.
The trust confirmed yesterday McDonald's would take over the unit,
''subject to satisfactory contractual negotiations'' with the trust's
board.
The chain has been running a unit in Guy's Hospital in London for more
than a year, and has others at American hospitals.
The move was attacked last night by Mr Ian Davidson, the Labour MP for
Govan. ''This is outrageous. This is part of the commercialisation of
the health service that is proceeding apace.'' He said it ''is
completely the wrong message to be giving out to people''.
He said he would be calling for the trust to reconsider the decision.
The burger outlet plan follows the trust's decision to review the lets
on the units in the shopping mall, opened five years ago. The Red Cross
tendered for renewal but failed to retain the let.
According to the trust, the bid from McDonald's was ''the most
advantageous from all points of view''.
Trust chief executive Mr Robert Calderwood has said that the
introduction of McDonald's would give the hospital a full range of
catering facilities, including a staff restaurant and a coffee room in
the Institute of Neurosciences, both run by the in-house catering team,
and WRVS snack bars in the maternity unit and rehabilitation facility.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas is set to announce profits amounting to #44 a second --
while ''slashing'' services to its 18 million customers, Labour claimed
today.
The company was expected to announce pre-tax profits of #1400m, said
Mr Nigel Griffiths, the Shadow Consumer Affairs Minister.
''This means British Gas is making #27m a week, #3.8m a day, #159,800
an hour, #2663 a minute, and #44 a second.
''Yet services have been slashed and further savage cuts are
planned.''
Mr Griffiths added: ''You cannot cut tens of thousands of jobs without
harming the service.''
He claimed that Ministers had neglected their duty by ''failing to
speak out on these cuts''. But Labour would keep the spotlight on
''boardroom excesses'' and strive to ensure customer services were
safeguarded.
Labour's criticism is the latest in a barrage against British Gas.
Last week the Gas Consumers Council reported that complaints about the
company had nearly doubled over the past year and were now at record
levels.
British Gas has also attracted criticism over the #475,000 salary of
its chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown.
It has also been attacked for cutting showroom services, reducing
spending on safety checks, shedding around 25,000 jobs and allegedly
''pandering to rich customers'' by offering discounts to people who paid
by direct debit.

MEMBERS of the public laughed yesterday when Monklands District
Council officials told an inquiry that council employees had not
received preferential treatment in its housing allocation.
The outburst came during the second public session in a series of
three being held this week as part of an independent inquiry into
allegations of corruption and impropriety against the local authority.
Initiated by the council, the inquiry is being chaired by Professor
Robert Black, who holds the chair of Scots Law at Edinburgh University.
He has been taking statements in private from members of the public and
other interested parties over the past three months.
The inquiry's terms of reference include alleged religious
discrimination and nepotism in recruitment and housing.
The subject on the agenda yesterday was housing and Professor Black
questioned housing committee convener Councillor Betty Leitch and Mr Tom
McKenzie, director of housing services, on policies and procedures.
At one stage, Professor Black asked whether the fact that somebody had
a job with the council might influence the way in which the local
authority's housing service dealt with that person.
Mr McKenzie replied: ''Yes and no.'' He explained that, if someone was
coming into the district, the council might make arrangements for
temporary accommodation. ''But if you are someone living in Monklands
and you are working for the council, then you are treated like everybody
else.''
This remark was greeted by laughter and denials from some members of
the public. However, Professor Black warned: ''If we have interventions,
I will order the place to be cleared.''
The inquiry heard the council's normal allocation procedure was based
on factors such as how long someone had been on the waiting list, the
category of need they were in, the size of home required, and the area
chosen. Outside the normal procedure, miscellaneous cases with
extenuating circumstances, which were not readily covered by the
council's usual policy, could be put before the housing committee.
But the only occasions on which any member of the committee would know
the identity of the person concerned would be if that member had taken
up the case in the first place. No-one else on the committee would know
the identity. In such instances, the member concerned was allowed to
speak to the case but not to vote.
The inquiry heard the average number of miscellaneous cases was about
26 a year, only 0.5% of the total number of allocations. Most involved
some special medical circumstances.
Defending the council's housing record, Councillor Leitch said: ''The
council are there to provide the best service we possibly can and that
is what we are attempting to do. In my opinion, the council are making a
good job of it. We are way above most other authorities with our
modernisation of houses and the type of repairs we do. I feel we do
provide a good service to council tenants.''
The inquiry heard the council's housing stock had dropped from 28,000
homes in 1980 to 21,500 now, because of the Right to Buy scheme enabling
tenants to purchase their homes. Most of the properties which had gone
were the popular cottage-type.
At the start of yesterday's session, Professor Black faced complaints
from members of the public who protested that the room in which the
session was taking place was too small and that not enough seats had
been laid out. About 22 people were seated but a similar number had to
stand.
At today's concluding public session, Professor Black will question
councillors and officials about recruitment policy and procedures.

<TEXT>
ACTOR Stephen Fry shocked the theatre world last night by suddenly
pulling out of his new West End play Cell Mates ''for personal reasons''
-- just six days after its opening.
Playwright Simon Gray said Fry, 37, was obviously ''a man in emotional
turmoil''.
He added: ''Three days after the successful opening of Cell Mates,
Stephen Fry expressed in a letter to me his great distress at what he
considered to be his failure as an actor.
''His sudden departure is the culmination of years of pressure,
overwork and unrelenting, self-sacrificing generosity. Our main concern
is for his safety and wellbeing.''
The star's agent, Mr Christian Hodell, said: ''We are concerned about
him.''
But he was unable to give details of his medical condition.
Cell Mates is a comedy drama in which Fry played Russian spy George
Blake, who was sprung from Wormwood Scrubs.
Fry appeared for only three nights, on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
Understudy Mark Anderson has filled in all this week but Simon Ward will
replace him as soon as possible.
The Albery Theatre play co-stars Rik Mayall, whom Gray praised for
coping ''so courageously with a crisis that is both personal and
professional''.
He said the cast members were grateful to Fry for ''the warmth, the
talent and the dedication he brought to our rehearsals and to his
performances''.
Fry, an outspoken advocate of celibacy, is best known as the
unflappable butler opposite his partner Hugh Laurie's upper class twit
in the TV series Jeeves and Wooster.
He has also published novels and appeared in films including Peter's
Friends, starring Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson.
He stars as an uptight professor opposite Meg Ryan, Walter Matthau,
and Tim Robbins in the new comedy IQ, about Albert Einstein and his
niece, opening next month.

ANIMAL rights protesters from the campaign against veal exports in
England are expected to join forces with protesters against the M77
motorway extension in Glasgow at a rally and march against the Criminal
Justice Act (1994) in the city on Saturday.
More than 2000 people, including environmental protesters from
throughout Britain, are expected to attend the rally, in George Square.
They will then march to the so-called Pollok Free State -- the main
battleground in the dispute between contractors Wimpey Construction and
the anti-M77 protesters.
Speakers at the rally, organised by Scottish Defiance Alliance, are to
condemn what protesters regard as ''draconian'' trespassing laws and
clauses against illegal assemblies contained in the Act.
Meanwhile three men were arrested after two separate incidents
involving protesters against the M77 extension yesterday.
Two 29-year-old men were arrested after an incident at Patterton Wood,
near Malletsheugh, and a 36-year-old man was arrested at the same place.
The three are likely to appear at Paisley Sheriff Court today.
More than 150 children yesterday joined protesters fighting to ban
live animal exports from the port of Brightlingsea, in Essex.
The youngsters held an open-air service before walking in front of
more than 100 adults ahead of five lorries loaded with sheep bound for
Belgium.
With the agreement of police, the protesters staged a 10-minute
sit-down in the road before allowing the lorries to proceed to the ship.

GLASGOW'S George Square is to get a new office development behind the
retained facade at number 11, on the south side of the civic square. The
building will be demolished behind the B-listed frontage to provide
28,000 square feet of lettable space.
Some 13,000 sq ft on three floors have been pre-let to Greater Glasgow
Tourist Board and Convention Centre on a full 25-year lease at a rental
of #18.50 per sq ft.
Campbell Hart of agents J Trevor &amp; Webster says that incentives in the
deal were ''very small''. The development is to be carried out by
Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society Ltd. ''Intensive and detailed
discussions between the architects and the City of Glasgow Planning
Department enabled my clients to get planning consent within three
months, which must be a record,'' said Campbell Hart.
Architects for the scheme are MacPherson &amp; Bell. The city's estates
department acted for the tourist board and convention centre. Campbell
Hart says that discussions with another tenant for three of the four
remaining floors are well advanced, the asking rent for the remaining
space is #18.50 per sq ft.

A PRESTIGIOUS Edinburgh retail property has changed hands in a #14m
deal. The Crown Estate Office has purchased the 22,000 sq ft shop at
127-128 Princes Street from Confederation Life Insurance Co (UK) Ltd.
Agents involved in the deal are predicting rental growth on Edinburgh's
premier shopping pitch.
The property is let under two leases to W H Smith Ltd, trading as
Waterstones, until 2017. The property produces a total rent of #600,000,
due for review in 1997. The purchaser paid #13.75m, reflecting a net
initial yield of 4.25%.
The property was developed by Confederation Life behind a retained
period facade during 1991/92 to provide modern retail space on five
floors.
Matthew Cheyne, investment partner at Gooch &amp; Wagstaff who handled the
sale for Confederation Life, said: ''The sale proves that there remains
a strong demand for first class property where all the fundamentals are
right.''
Karen Queen, investment partner at Richard Ellis who acted on behalf
of the Crown Estate Office, said: ''We believe that rents in Princes
Street are set for growth in the medium term and that this property will
produce good investment performance.''

KILMARNOCK town centre is poised for a major retail development which
will create 30 new shop units.
BICC Developments and Vico/Skandia Properties have set up a joint
venture to carry out the 120,000 sq ft retail scheme which will be known
as Portland Mall.
Work is scheduled to start later this year, with completion scheduled
for the summer of 1997.
The project adjoins the prime shopping area of the town which houses
retailers including M &amp; S, BHS and Woolworths. The town centre is
currently undergoing an #8m face-lift.
Colin Taylor, group property director at Vico Properties plc, said:
''We have recently been involved in other successful developments in
Kilmarnock, and it is widely recognised that the town lacks a major,
enclosed shopping centre. This is confirmed by the estimated catchment
population of over a quarter of a million people within a 30-minute
drive time.''
Vico/Skandia is an established joint venture between Vico Properties
plc, the Glasgow-based developer and Skandia Life, one of Sweden's
largest insurance groups. BICC has been involved in a number of major
retail schemes throughout the UK including Falkirk, Hull, Preston and
Cardiff.
In an entirely separate deal, Vico has acquired a prominent three-acre
site at Townhead from GEC. Colin Taylor of Vico said: ''This is a rare
opportunity to acquire a strategic site inside the line of the M8.
''We have not finalised out development plans but, given the
prominence of the site to Kyle Street and the motorway, we consider the
location has significant commercial development potential. We are
looking at a range of options.''
James Barr &amp; Son and DTZ Debenham Thorpe represented Vico in the
acquisition. Bell Ingram acted for the vendor.

Harry Conroy turns his attentions seaward in this report on Scotland's
indigenous industries
SCOTLAND'S fishing industry no longer centres solely around the
catching of wild stocks in the Atlantic or the North Sea. Another,
equally important side of the industry has developed -- fish farming.
Lithgow Ltd, the private company owned by Sir William Lithgow and his
family, has a foot in both camps, the traditional fishing industry in
the waters around Scotland's coast, and the newer, but 25-year-old,
fish-farming industry.
Both industries are rooted in Scotland's natural resources, its long
coastline facing on to the once rich fish breeding grounds, and to the
salmon drawn to Scotland's many rivers.
However, our traditional inshore and deep sea grounds are facing
continual problems from overfishing and the threatened invasion by other
EU fishing fleets, most notably the Spanish.
At the same time our salmon fish farming is troubled by stock dumping
from countries such as Norway.
In both cases there appears to be little assistance, understanding or
sympathy from the Government.
Despite these problems Hugh Currie, managing director of Lithgows, is
confident of the future.
Lithgows, often described as a mini conglomerate, owns the Campbeltown
Shipyard which has built more than 90 fishing boats since the family
took over the yard in the early 70s.
The company also owns Landcatch, the largest independent supplier of
salmon eggs and smolts to the Scottish fish farming industry.
Lithgows have used their interest in both industries to compliment
both companies.
Sitting in his office, a converted farm building at Netherton,
Langbank, overlooking the Firth of Clyde, Hugh Currie exuded the
confidence of a chief executive who knows where his company is going.
Lithgows employs over 1000, but although the companies we discussed
accounted collectively for only 10% of this total, there was no doubt
Hugh Currie intends them to be among the foremost in their fields.
Campbeltown Shipyard has been building fishing boats for generations
but recognising the difficulties that the industry is at present facing,
Lithgows have diversified into building offshore fish farms named
Cruives which can operate in open waters. This has not only provided
welcome work for the shipyard but has also offered a solution to the
salmon fish-farming industry faced with increased environmental pressure
to site farms further offshore.
The company commissioned the first offshore fish farm which qualifies
as a vessel, thus attracting finance at shipbuilding rates in April
1993, and is about to start building the third Cruive.
All three will be used by their own fish farming concern Landcatch but
Hugh Currie is confident that Campbeltown Shipyard will receive orders
from other fish farming concerns in Ireland, Norway, and Spain.
The 130-tonne vessels cost between #300,000 and #600,000 and can hold
up to 160,000 smolts.
''The fish farming industry is being directed further offshore, and
the Cruive is designed for the more aggresive open waters. It is also
more attractive environmentally,'' says Hugh Currie. ''It is the way
forward and can be use for other species such as sea bass and sea bream.
We would hope that it would be built under licence in countries such as
Chile.''
Lithgow entered the fish farming industry in 1980 when they formed
Landcatch to supply salmon eggs and smolts to the Scottish industry from
Sir William's estate at Ormsary in Argyll.
Landcatch now has an annual turnover of #8m and produces between 20
and 25 million eggs each year.
It takes between three and four years for a salmon to reach the point
where it can be harvested, and in that time the producers have to watch
for any disease appearing in the stock.
At present to test for disease a company has to take the fish from the
water and kill it. This could mean the company killing a large brood
fish with many eggs valued at up to #2000.
Another Lithgow company Aqua Culture Diagnostics is at present
tackling this problem with the help of Strathclyde University.
''We hope to be able to take a water sample which gives a bug or virus
count in the water, and if they are above a certain level then you know
that there is disease present.''
Hugh Currie believes that the new equipment will be able to be adapted
to be used for testing other breeds of fish, and that eventually it
could be used to test for water born disease among humans.

In Scotland, we do not feel part of Europe so see
no need to speak anything other than English
AT A children's sermon I attended recently in an Edinburgh parish
church, the theme was language. Children were invited to shout out any
foreign words they knew, and among the ensuing babble one yelled ''zwei
schnitzels mit Ketchup, bitte.'' Very practical!
I then recalled a similar children's sermon I had heard in St Andrew's
Church in Brussels. There, children were invited to calculate sums in
different languages and a multi-lingual calculator gave the answers in a
rasping electronic voice.
The facility with which those youngsters were able to slip from
English to French to German and Flemish was astonishing.
Both experiences served to show how important it is to expose young
people to different languages and cultures at an early age, when they
are malleable and have no inhibitions.
The Brussels ex-pat children had a head start, surrounded as they were
by people speaking many languages and being able to visit several
countries on a weekend car run.
The problem in the UK, and particularly in Scotland, is that we are
sufficiently removed from mainland Europe that we do not feel part of it
and see no need to speak anything other than English.
The strip of sea separating us encourages the psychological barrier
that makes for the them and us syndrome.
However, the ''Little Britisher'' attitude will not do in today's
international environment and is inconsistent with the traditions of
Scotland, always an exporter of people with skills and expertise.
''But everyone else speaks English,'' is the common excuse. Even if
this were true, the answer would be: ''So what?''
It is arrogant and short-sighted to rely on English and, if you are in
business or a profession, you will not be doing your company, your
employers, or your country and favours.
While the person on the other side of a transaction may speak English,
it is unfair to make him or her speak and negotiate in a foreign
language throughout.
Business opportunities can be enhanced by language skills. The
Japanese company faced with a choice of a Scottish supplier will go for
the one with Japanese speakers.
If you are involved in negotiations or talks with officials from any
of the EU Institutions, you may find the language will switch from one
to another.
If you cannot at least understand the commonly used tongues such as
French and German, you may well lose the thread of the argument as
interpreters are not always available.
People should do their homework in advance and find out the
nationality of the person they plan to meet. Both parties will feel more
at ease and will be able to move between languages when particular
expressions are difficult to translate.
I am not suggesting that it is necessary to speak another language
fluently, but showing willing is no more than good sense and good
manners.
This, to me, is so obvious and elementary that I find it incredible
that so few Scottish firms have grasped the need for language training
for staff at all levels, including the all-important
receptionist/telephonist who is the first point of contact.
How many orders or opportunities are lost because the telephonist
cannot understand what is being asked?
Lawyers are as ostrich-like as others in this respect. The view that
Scottish solicitors will never have to deal with any foreign country is
outdated and erroneous.
Clients and their business and leisure interests are more mobile than
ever, and most Scottish law firms will have to deal with cases of
accidents abroad, divorce and custody actions, succession problems,
timeshares, bad debt actions, contracts or litigation.
The Glasgow lawyer who never leaves the office may still be involved
in instructing foreign counterparts and monitoring progress, or
receiving instructions from foreign lawyers.
It will often be essential to gen-up on technical legal terms and the
procedure to be adopted in other countries, if only to be able to ask
the right questions and give correct instructions.
Interpretation of documents, judgments, and pieces of legislation --
including EU Directives -- are often crucial, and it can be necessary to
compare texts in different languages to arrive at the true meaning of a
word or phrase.
If you don't think this happens very often, let me assure you there
are cases currently going through the Scottish courts where this is
precisely what is taking place.
The trouble is that many lawyers are lazy or apathetic about language
learning; yet there is plenty of help available.
Many Law Faculties have combined law and language courses, language
laboratories, post-graduate and extra-mural courses.
There are also tailor-made courses for lawyers as there are for other
professions and businesses via commercial firms or institutes such as
The French Institute; distance learning tapes and videos abound.
New areas of business are opening up for Scottish industries and
professional advisers in Central and Eastern Europe.
Expertise is being sought on matters as diverse as oil and
telecommunications. I was recently in Moldova and Latvia, and was
surprised by the number of people from America, Germany, and other
countries, all of whom were there to help but also to pick up business.
Language skills are essential in that part of the world.
One can't learn everything, so the trick is to match your skills to
the needs of clients, actual and potential.
Between us, my husband and I have had the good fortune to work in such
far-flung places as the Seychelles, Belgium, Kenya, Tonga, and Tuvalu
and would not have enjoyed ourselves so much had we not made the effort
to acquire a smattering of the local lingo.
It is much more fun if you can understand that your official
interpreter is trying to say something more politely than the original
version.
Quaint English is also fun. ''Your Worship, he says she had a face
like a stagecoach departing,'' was easily understood to mean ''She had a
face like the back end of a bus.''
So, my Soapbox message is that language learning is fun and useful.
Give up being a couch potato for one night a week and get learning.

Director General of the Council of Bars and Law Societies of the
European Union, was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

THE Scottish economy will trail behind the rest of the UK this year
but its growth rate will pick up from next year, according to
independent forecaster Business Strategies.
At an expected 2%, the 1994 increase in Scotland's gross domestic
product lagged behind the 3.8% reported yesterday for the UK as a whole.
This is predicted to remain the case in 1995, with 2% growth north of
the Border comparing with 3.2% for the country. But it is expected to
accelerate in 1996 to 3.2% and to continue increasing in 1997.
Business Strategies sees unemployment falling at a slightly slower
pace than in the rest of the country, with numbers actually in
employment continuing to fall until later in the decade when they will
start rising modestly, mainly in the service sectors.
The weaker recovery in Scotland reflects the shallower recession
suffered here and growth in manufacturing output will be low this year.
The forecasters expect the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce tax
cuts in November's Budget, predicting the equivalent of 3p off the basic
rate in order to boost the economy by 1997 -- election year if the
Tories manage to reach the finishing post.
The benefits of tax cuts should feed through faster in Scotland
because of the healthier state of the housing market, with negative
equity not a problem. People will consider themselves freer to spend the
extra take-home pay.
Also boosting consumer spending above the national trend rate will be
a continuing fall in the savings rate in Scotland. This has
traditionally been higher compared to the rest of the country.
''As personal incomes continue to rise and house prices recover
consumer spending will leap ahead of the UK,'' the forecasters predict.
Business Strategies sees growth in engineering slowing in the short
term but recovering beyond that as North Sea investment rises.
Construction is considered capable of recovery over a shorter period
while non-manufacturing sectors will see steady output growth of some
2.5%.

ARTSCOPE International, one of the UK's leading fine art insurance
brokers, has just opened an office in Edinburgh, headed by manager David
Henderson, to help cater for its growing business in Scotland.
At present it has some 800 clients, around 30 in Scotland. Most of the
individuals are rich almost by definition as many of the items covered
are high works of art, valuable antiques, jewellery and even classic or
historic vehicles.
A subsidiary of the Rollins Hudig Hall Group, a great deal of interest
in Artscope, which was formed in the late 1970s, centres on its new
unique photographic and computer imaging system called ''ARTIST'' which
was launched to assist the police identify and recover stolen valuables.
Clients can now get electronic picture of their valuables stored,
enabling them to be easily identified if stolen and also, in turn, if
recovered helping the police return them to their rightful owners.
The photographs are transferred on to an extensive computer-imaging
database. In the event of theft, the image of the stolen items can be
quickly found on the database and, through police channels, distributed
to police forces, art dealers and auction houses worldwide.
In the unfortunate situation where the stolen items are not recovered,
both the client and the insurance company has all the necessary
photographic detail to assist in evaluating the insurance claim. This
''ARTIST'' photographic service is offered free of charge to many
Artscope clients and, in many cases, can qualify the insured for premium
discounts.
Obviously, a major feature of the system is speed. If a picture of a
stolen item can be quickly circulated then the chance of recovery must
be enhanced.

THE dollar moved lower following comments from Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan which appeared to rule out any more hikes in US
interest rates in the near future.
In a report to Congress, Mr Greenspan said that the Fed may hold rates
or even cut them despite adverse price data. This softer line unsettled
the currency market and the dollar suffered.
Elsewhere, the German mark proved unable to hold on to its recent
gains although it remains firmly underpinned by the prospect of the next
move in German interest rates being up rather than down.
Domestic political worries continued to take their toll on the Italian
lira, Spanish peseta and French franc.
Fourth-quarter GDP data for the UK failed to excite the market.
Sterling had a mixed tone, dropping almost a quarter-of-a-pfennig on the
mark to DM2.3338 but adding over a third-of-a-cent against the weak
dollar at $1.5857.

THE net asset value of Edinburgh-based Pacific Horizon Investment
Trust tumbled 16% to 41.6p in the six months to January 31, as emerging
markets in the region crumbled.
The #17m fund, managed by Baillie Gifford, marginally outperformed the
FT Actuaries Pacific (ex-Japan) index, which lost 17.1% in sterling
terms during the period.
Hong Kong equities account for 35% of the fund, with the next largest
holdings in Singapore and Malaysia. The trust is also invested in
Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and China.
Pacific Horizon believes long-term prospects remain excellent, saying
that export-driven economic growth in the region is buoyant.
It believes that markets offer better value than they did a year ago
but said short-term concerns about the likely upward trend of US
interest rates remained.

THE Government is urged to stick resolutely to the economic advantages
of one policy rule over another by the independent National Institute of
Economic and Social Research in its latest quarterly review, writes
CHRIS STONE.
It says that the choice between rules should be unaffected by the
timing of the election and, indeed, unaffected by its result.
The NIESR points to the considerable uncertainty about the outlook for
inflation this year and next, partly reflecting uncertainty as to the
margin of spare capacity still left in the economy. In these
circumstances too much faith should not be placed in forecasts, says the
Institute, including its own.
While it is right to look ahead as best one can, the main emphasis
must be on interpreting indicators of the current situation, including
especially the rate of inflation as it actually is now.
The Institute says that if, for example, the rate of inflation were to
slow down during the next 12 months, that would be strong evidence that
the margin of spare capacity is still large and hence a good reason for
believing that interest rates are high enough already, and might even be
able to fall. If on the other hand actual inflation accelerates, as the
Institute thinks more likely, then interest rates would have to rise
further during the next year.
What is needed is the consistent application of a clearly-defined
rule. If the rule refers to forecasts, they should not be forecasts made
by the authorities themselves. ''In particular, the authorities cannot
afford to take an optimistic view of the inflation prospect,'' says the
Institute, adding: ''Last year, as it happens, the optimists were right,
but the authorities cannot assume that they will be right again. They
cannot risk undermining the credibility of the policy rule by appearing
to be willing to accommodate inflation when it is seen to rise.''

THE British economy slowed down from the hectic pace of activity
attained in the first half of last year, it was confirmed yesterday by
the Central Statistical Office.
Investment made a positive contribution to growth in the fourth
quarter, but expectations that consumer spending had slowed down were
dashed.
The picture presented by the output, income and employment data for
the final quarter of last year was mixed, and left analysts in two minds
about the future direction of the economy and the outlook for interest
rates.
The quarterly growth rate was 0.8%, the same as the initial estimate,
and equal to the third-quarter figure. But the year-on-year rate was
revised down to 3.9% and the full-year rate to 3.8%, both from earlier
estimates of 4%. This resulted from revisions to figures for previous
quarters.
The data broke the trend of upward revisions to gross domestic
product, a factor which influenced Bank of England decisions to raise
interest rates.
The economy advanced at 0.9% in the third and fourth quarters of 1993
and then took off to grow at 1% and 1.3% respectively in the first and
second quarters of last year.
Since then there has been a slowdown, but it has been no more than
modest, and without a further retreat the Bank of England is bound to
tighten monetary policy again.
The big surprise in yesterday's figures came in the detail, especially
on consumer spending, which was weak throughout much of last year but
picked up again in the fourth quarter. The National Lottery could be a
source of distortions.
Retail sales had slowed down in the final quarter and spending on
domestic power was depressed by mild weather. Most independent analysts
had read these portents as a sign that consumer spending would retreat.
In the event it rose by 0.6% in the quarter, against growth of 0.5% in
the second and third quarters and just 0.4% in the first quarter.
Last month retail sales fell away sharply after a good Christmas in
the High Street, but the buoyancy of consumer spending towards the end
of last year suggests this could have been an aberration.
Investment rose by 1.4% in the fourth quarter, the first positive
contribution to growth since the first quarter when it increased by
2.3%.
James Capel's Adam Cole was disappointed that the bounce-back had not
been stronger. It did not even offset the falls of 0.6% and 1.6%
respectively in the second and third quarters.
Investment has been the poor relation of the current economic
recovery, though there are signs from recent bank lending figures that
it could be on the point of picking up. CBI surveys have suggested that
manufacturers' investment intentions are strongest where capacity
utilisation is highest.
The Bank of England has pointed out that investment figures have been
distorted by declines in the key areas of North Sea oil and housing, and
that if these are taken out of the equation the growth rate would be
around 5%.
Net exports made a negative contribution of 0.5% to GDP in the fourth
quarter, reversing the trend in the middle two quarters of the year when
exports boomed and imports stalled.
Manufacturing slowed down in the final quarter. The industrial sector,
dragged down by reduced demand for electricity and gas, played second
fiddle to services, where the quarterly growth rate was 0.9%. The
strongest element was transport and communications with a gain of 1.7%
on the third quarter and 6.6% on the fourth quarter of 1993.
The GDP figures made little impact on financial markets, where the big
surprise of the day was the strength of demand for the Bank of England's
auction of #2000m Treasury 8[1/2]% 2005.
This was covered 2.08 times, the highest level since June, and
confounded expectations that overseas investors would be discouraged by
the weakness of sterling and the Government's political difficulties.
Gilts took heart from the news and by the end of the day were sporting
gains of around five-eighths. Bond markets were encouraged by the latest
testimony to Congress of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
in which he left open the question of future rate rises. Meanwhile,
sterling is clearly not friendless.

BUCHANAN Bus Station in Glasgow, Scotland's biggest,is officially
relaunched today after a #5m refurbishment which took almost a year-long
programme of work.
Passenger throughput at Buchanan Bus Station now exceeds 10 million a
year. Whether arriving or departing, for some time past the travellers
had to accept the problems of reconstruction work all around them. The
programme continued without ceasing, even during the station's peak
travel times.
''But we believe the final result as seen today makes it all
worthwhile,'' said Mr Hamish Taylor, Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive's director of technical services and development. ''When we
took over operational control of the bus station in May 1993 it had
sadly declined in use, reputation, environment, and image. Improving and
refurbishing was an immediate priority.
''We believe that what has been created is a quality product which
will enhance bus travel in Strathclyde and far beyond. In the process,
we consulted bus travellers, bus operators, and other groups in surveys
to find out what they saw as priorities in change.''
The new style bus station gives travellers such fresh features as
shelter from weather, airport style information screens, an enclosed
heated concourse area with shops and a restaurant, a security patrol
system backed by monitored closed circuit TV and even a new,
experimental porter service.
Mobility impaired travellers also get a new deal with level access
throughout the station and wheelchairs available on request.
''The long term retention of Buchanan bus station is seen as a major
contribution to the regional council's integrated transport plans,''
said Hamish Taylor. ''Figures tell their own story, 41 operators now use
this bus station and its 57 stances.
''Next to Glasgow Central railway station, this is the busiest
passenger facility in Strathclyde.'' Current traffic statistics for the
region list a situation in which almost four out of every five
travellers are carried by bus. In the central area, the totals are
broken down to one third by bus, one third by rail, and one third by
private car. The enhancement of the image of bus travel fits into
Strathclyde's endeavours to encourage more use of public transport.
Guests at today's ceremony, including many bus operators, will be
shown over a facility which will hardly be recognised by those who can
remember the shabby location which had previously existed.
An attractive design to withstand much day to day hard usage has high
quality materials specified throughout. It has an overall colour scheme
of slate blue, orange and silver and the new deal for operators, bus
crews and passengers even extends to landscaped areas in parts of the
bus station.
Buchanan Bus Station in its previous form was opened in 1976 and was
heavily used from the start. It soon showed clear signs of that use.
Finally in March 1993, the regional council authorised the Passenger
Transport Executive to acquire the head lease of the station from the
leaseholders Citylink. The main bus station in the whole of Scotland was
acquired for #4m. The problems which had to be tackled -- close to a
rebuilding schedule -- included everything from security to its
after-dark reputation.
The team brought together to create the new Buchanan Bus Station, had
the Jenkins Group of London as designers. They had already received a
design award for the refurbishment of London's Victoria Coach Station.
They were joined by Ove Arup &amp; Partners, project management, civil and
structural engineering consultants. Doig &amp; Smith joined as chartered
surveyors and Hully &amp; Kirkwood as mechanical and electrical consultants.
Work began in April 1994.
''Considerable importance was placed on the extensive customer surveys
which were carried out, said Hamish Taylor. ''We also studied the latest
design standards arising from the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory
Committee infrastructure guidelines and the Scottish Consumer Council's
report on travel by public transport. Bus operators were also consulted.
''One agreed priority was that the bus station had to be made as
accessible as possible to all users, including the disabled, people with
mobility difficulties, mothers with prams or young children, and other
groups. To meet suggestions we incorporated doors which automatically
opened and closed. A mother and baby changing room was included as were
toilets for the mobility impaired.
''Then, as it can be a long way from one end of Buchanan bus station
to the other it was decided that two wheelchairs should be available,
airline style, when requested from station staff.''
Passenger surveys also produced complaints about the poor state of
toilets, and the concern for better security in some areas, particularly
after dark.
These were met by action including new attendant-supervised toilets,
enhanced lighting to a very high level, the bus station's own CCTV
cameras at key locations monitored by their own security staff, and
other steps aimed at giving increased assurance to people travelling
alone at night.
Car parking is immediately adjacent at Buchanan Street car park, new
taxi rank facilities are incorporated within the bus station area, and
the unique porter service is operated by staff porters wearing specially
badged blouson.
''In many ways, passengers will find that the new facilities are
shaped towards those of an airport terminal, passenger waiting areas and
seating areas are sheltered behind screens. The enclosed and heated
concourse area has public telephones, left luggage and lost property
facilities, a 100-seat restaurant, vending machines, cash withdrawal
facilities, and space for four shops.
''The bus station includes a major travel centre, and ticket sales
facility for local, long distance and leisure travel,'' said Mr Taylor
''Meeting the views of bus operators, facilities include crew rest
areas. There is overnight supervised parking for buses covered by CCTV
recording for enhanced vehicle security and there are also fuel sales
and a vehicle recovery service. Check-in facilities are provided for
tour and holiday operators and there is a full system of tannoy
announcements. In addition to the updated information on departures on
monitor screens in the concourse area there will be displays of
departure information at each bus stance.''
Buchanan Bus Station is used by bus operators serving the whole of
Scotland. Other services cover the south of England and tour
destinations including Europe.
To meet these a new departure lounge for coach passengers is available
24 hours a day. There is a further side to the importance of continuing
and enhancing the role of Buchanan bus station in its overall benefits
for the community. These already include a recorded improvement in the
air quality under the ''Heilanman's Umbrella'' in Argyle Street
following some bus services being diverted away from there in a
re-organisation of routes. Another is the way in which easier access to
bus and coach services and the wide choice of these services backed by
the new, environmentally friendly and secure atmosphere is set to
encourage more people to travel by bus.
Buchanan Bus Station, in its key location covering more than 4.1 acres
is designed and built to be the heart of most of Scotland's bus
operations well into the twentyfirst century
A message from Councillor Charlie Gordon, chair of Strathclyde
Regional Council's Roads and Transportation Committee.
THE inauguration of the modernisation of Buchanan Bus Station is a
major step forward towards Strathclyde Regional Council's 'Integrated
Transport Strategy for Strathclyde.' When the regional council
authorised the Passenger Transport Executive to bid for and secure the
head lease, the bus station had deteriorated to the extent that it was a
decaying down at heel facility and underused by passengers and operators
alike. In preparing the plans for its enhancement the needs of
passengers, operators, staff, and other groups had to be taken into
account. The need for sustained development and enhancement of the city
centre environment were also major considerations. As a consequence of
the revised management strategy and improvements, daily bus movements
have increased from 600 to 1400 and passengers from 13,000 to 30,000.
We now take pride in having a bus station which ranks with the best in
Europe and is worthy of the City of Architecture and Design. I would
like to express my appreciation to all who have contributed to this
major transformation, designers, contractors, operators and staff, all
of whom worked miracles in keeping the bus station operating throughout.
I acknowledge with much appreciation the financial assistance which
the regional council has received from the European Union, Strathclyde
Integrated Development Fund and thanks also go to the district council
and the regional council roads and estates department and Strathclyde
Police.

EXPORTS by electrical and electronic engineering companies in
Lanarkshire almost doubled during 1993/94, as the county's economy
recovered from dependency on its ravaged steel industry.
New figures show that the sector exported #268m worth of goods, an
increase of #127m, producing a 21% year-on-year rise in the county's
export total to more than #583m.
Lanarkshire's sales of goods abroad increased for the fourth
consecutive year, according to the Scottish Council Development and
Industry's latest survey of manufacturing exports.
The county has enjoyed a boom in exports to the Far East. From a lowly
#39m in 1991, companies now ship #102m worth of orders to South Korea,
Singapore, and Hong Kong.
Behind the county's electronics industry, which features giants such
as JVC and Motorola and accounts for 46% of exports, comes mechanical
engineering, with #132.8m of overseas sales.
The county has borne the brunt of the demise of heavy industry, with
the closure of Ravenscraig steelworks having dealt a particularly
devastating blow.
However, Lanarkshire Development Agency chief executive Archie Bethel
put the county's export success down to the hard work of companies,
which had successfully diversified and adapted to changing markets.
He said: ''The challenge for us was that much of local industry was
dependent on steel. Many companies had not made any attempts to export.
''We now think this type of increase in exports is sustainable from
Lanarkshire companies for the next three or four years.''
Firms performed well in the German, Dutch and US markets, with
respective exports of more than #122m, #55m and #51m. In total, exports
from Lanarkshire accounted for 6.2% of Scotland's overseas sales.

* THREE Scots business overseas ventures in the coming weeks emphasise
the global nature of the country's current export boom, writes BILL
MAGEE.
Several companies are planning trips to Central America, Germany, and
Thailand through Scottish Trade International.
They add up to what STI's David Taylor yesterday described as an
encouraging exhibition of Scottish export levels which during the past
24 months have surpassed the previous six years.
''Scottish manufactured exports have risen by 19.2% at current prices
to reach #11.5bn, representing a 14% increase in real terms,'' he said.
The Latin America trip on March 8 to 13 will focus on the fast-moving
industrial and consumer goods market in Central America.
Dortmund is the venue for a Europartenariat joint venture on March
20-21. The city is located in the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, the most
densely populated region of Germany, with 17.8 million people.
Finally, the Scottish Council Development &amp; Industry has organised a
trade mission to Thailand on March 27-30.

creation and growth will, according to Scottish Enterprise, refresh the
parts of the economy other initiatives do not reach.
Renfrewshire Enterprise yesterday linked up with local authorities in
Renfrew, Inverclyde, and Eastwood in a #250,000 deal.
This will see the arrival later this year of shops providing a
one-door approach to people seeking business guidance, giving them
direct access to the sometimes baffling network of organisations
providing development services.
Entrepreneurial customers will be able to glean information about
financial assistance, property, training and franchise opportunities.
Commenting on the scheme, which is part of a wider Scottish Enterprise
initiative, Renfrewshire Enterprise chairman John Ashworth said: ''This
agreement between ourselves and the local authorities is testament to
the commitment to make local partnerships work.''

IT may seem a contradiction in terms, but demolition contractor David
Sinclair has dedicated much of his life to the preservation of historic
buildings throughout the United Kingdom.
W J &amp; D (Contracting) Limited is the UK's foremost practitioner in the
highly specialised field of facade retention, whereby the front of a
building is supported during demolition of the internal shell.
Primarily used as a means of preserving buildings of architectural
interest or historical value, facade retention has been practised for
generations.
But it is only in recent years that one Glasgow company has moved
ahead of its competitors to establish itself as an international leader
in the field.
Based in Glasgow's East End, former mechanical and services engineer
Sinclair is managing director of an organisation holding the world
licence for marketing and manufacture of the Atlas Prop.
This revolution in the industry has enabled the firm to take on some
of the most demanding facade retention projects, not only in the UK but
in Europe and the US.
The firm is very much a family concern, David taking over the reins
from his father in 1972. Today, there are 30 staff including his son
William and long time associates Les Reilly, Jim Ridley, and Russell
McGowan.
All are dedicated to, as Sinclair puts it, the manufacture of an
''elaborate meccano set''. This particular set, however, has now
resulted in the firm's confident claim to have supported and retained
more facades than any other company in the UK.
''We secured the licence for the prop three years ago, and there is no
doubt it has given us the edge over competitors,'' explains Sinclair.
''The widely used RMD (Rapid Metal Development) system has been around
for some time, but its 10-tonne range does not offer the same
opportunities as the Atlas 30 and 50-tonne ranges.''
For an example of the increased capability of the system, look no
further than Bothwell Street in Glasgow's city centre, where the company
undertook Europe's largest facade retention a few years ago.
Sinclair said: ''The demolition was undertaken through a floor by
floor piecemeal process, but because of the height and length of the
facade we had to monitor the work very carefully.
''Safety is of paramount importance on all our jobs, regardless of
size, and we undertake extensive monitoring through the duration of each
contract.
''In supporting facades, certain safety standards have to be allowed,
resulting in a retention system that is even stronger than the structure
being removed.''
With the revolutionary Atlas Prop, W J &amp; D has gained international
recognition for facade retention, but Sinclair is quick to point out
that the company is involved in all aspects of demolition and
dismantling.
Indeed, it has just landed the task of demolishing the Centre One tax
office in East Kilbride, one of the biggest jobs in the UK, and has
recently acted as a sub-contractor on demolition and site clearance at
Celtic Park.
''We provide a one-stop shop for clients,'' says Sinclair. ''Unlike
some firms, who specialise in either facade retention or demolition, W J
&amp; D offer both services.
''We can design, supply, erect, and maintain a facade retention system
and then carry out a piecemeal demolition behind the facade.
Now, with more than 20 contracts in Scotland and England, the firm has
set its set beyond Britain's shores. ''Europe and the US are very
important to us,'' explains Sinclair.
''As immediate past president of the European Demolition Association
and as International Affairs Director for the National Association of
Demolition Contractors for the US, I am keen to forge links with
contractors in other countries and expand the company into the overseas
market.''
To date, W J &amp; D has undertaken work in Spain, Holland, and France,
and recently carried out a contract in Washington where it provided the
expertise and equipment to shore up the roof of a major shopping
complex.
Sinclair has also looked to recent events in Japan to identify another
overseas market.
''In an earthquake situation, not every building needs to be
demolished. Although a building may suffer structural damage, in many
instances the structure can be retained using temporary works.
''Our equipment would be ideal for this type of work, and through my
contacts overseas I aim to push ahead in this particular area.''
So what does the future hold for Glasgow's demolition man. Where does
he see the company going from here?
''We have a concept for a prop on the drawing board at the moment that
we are sure will provide a major breakthrough in the industry. Without
giving anything away, I think I can safely say that we will be applying
for the patent on this one ourselves.''

ROYAL Bank of Scotland has launched a #50m subsidised loan scheme --
part of a #776m European fund targeted primarily at small and
medium-sized businesses.
The initiative, which is backed by the European Investment Bank and
European Union, aims to support job creation, capital investment and
certain large infrastructure projects.
Small and medium-sized enterprises engaging in capital investment
which creates jobs could receive a 10% subsidy payment, of as much as
#2300, on loans of up to #23,000 per job created. This is equivalent to
a 2% interest subsidy over five years.
SMEs undertaking other investment projects will be eligible for a
cash-back payment on their expenditure, with the amount dependent on the
individual loan's terms and conditions.
Loans are also available for infrastructure projects with an
environmental or energy conservation element, in line with calls for
such a facility by the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992.
Much interest has already been expressed in the Royal Bank scheme.
Donald Workman, director of commercial banking services, said: ''It is
important UK enterprises take advantage of the benefits these subsidies
can provide.''

IN McSonachan's last night, I found The Braces glumly reading the
Edinburgh Science Festival programme, given away with a newspaper near
you NOW! He tutted and sighed and shook his head. ''Same again?'' I
asked, to try and break his depression. He tutted and sighed and shook
his head and nodded. I nodded to McSonachan and McSonachan nodded back.
It's a private communications superhighway.
''These damned scientists,'' said The Braces, ''have it all sussed.
Look at these events they're staging for children! Interactive
exhibitions and workshops for thinking kids. A Science Playcentre for
three to six-year-olds. You can see what they're up to.''
I couldn't, actually.
''They're trying to make science glamorous,'' said The Braces. ''They
want to entice the most promising sprogs of the upcoming generation and
turn them into people with white coats and rimless glasses. We of the
financial services industry, should be alarmed. If the finest young
brains end up squirting unspeakable liquids into dishes and peering at
them through microscopes, who'll be working in the dealing rooms and
creating real wealth? The second raters.''
I bit back the obvious comment. I asked what was to be done. ''Our own
professional association should establish a rival festival,'' said The
Braces. ''Just think of the hands-on, finance-fun experiences we could
create. The kids would love it.''
Helped by another round, our creative faculties went into hyper-drive.
The first annual Finance Fun Festival took shape, its stalls and
workshops a seething mass of kids who wanted to wear suits and make
money . . .
* Sell in May and Go Away: An exciting game-show environment for 6-10
year-olds. Buy low, sell high, as the calendar ticks away. How to
identify a sucker by telephone voice alone.
* The Futures are Ours: How to sell something you don't actually own.
The excitement of wondering whether you will have it in time, or whether
someone else will get it first. What is a pork belly? Come and make
friends with one. Stroke a pork belly, prod a pork belly, grope a pork
belly. It could be the friend that gets you a bungalow in Bearsden.
* Quadruple-entry Book-keeping: Find out how to manipulate figures to
your own advantage, aided by the simulated on-screen voice of a former
Chancellor of the Exchequer. Devise new ways of expressing company
balance sheets in four columns headed Credit, Debit, Hope and Charity --
or Credit, Debit, Scam and Cream-off? A creative workshop for three to

The lack of an integrated transport system is frustrating Scotland's
attempts to recover from recession, and radical action is now being
called for
THIS month, Finger on The Pulse puts the wheels in motion and turns to
transport. It's the topic of the moment in business circles and looks
set to be one of the major topics of debate this spring -- but why?
A study last month claimed that a lack of investment is threatening
Scotland's economic future and that a history of neglect in transport
infrastructure leaves us at a disadvantage compared to our European
trading partners.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce has recognised that the entire issue of
transport in Scotland is a suitable case for radical treatment and,
taking the lead, has been instrumental in setting up Scotland's first
national Transport Conference under the banner of the Scottish Chamber
of Commerce.
With its fingers well and truly on the pulse, the Chamber claims that
the lack of any balanced or integrated transport policy is frustrating
Scotland's recovery from recession. Enough is enough -- the Chamber
feels it is time for action.
''Getting Scotland Moving'', supported by The Herald will be of
interest to everyone who uses road, rail sea or air to despatch or
receive goods. Sir Alastair Morton of Eurotunnel will make the keynote
speech, and the Chamber's target is ambitious: to drive Government
policy and bring ''gridlock'' to an end in Scotland.
Glasgow Chamber Chief Executive Geoff Runcie is forthright: ''Untie
the red tape and for goodness sake let us compete.''
Past President Geoffrey Johnstone is equally robust and makes no
pretence about balance. ''In global terms Scotland is a tiny wee place.
So forget creating a level playing field -- skew it in Scotland's favour
and give business an advantage!''
Specifically, anyone who uses the M8, or the A80, or parts of the A74,
will know what is meant by gridlock. Tailbacks have become a way of life
for the Friends of the Kingston Bridge. We have to solve severe road
congestion problems in Scotland, and critics of Government policy have
pointed out that building even more roads just isn't the answer. By the
year 2020, it's predicted there will be twice the number of cars on
Scotland's roads then at present.
What's the solution? One radical idea is that, in the next century,
personal mobility will have to be curtailed to allow industry and
tourism -- the engines of economic growth -- to move.
So how do you stop people buying cars and contributing to traffic
congestion? The unpalatable answer is to make it financially
unattractive by pushing petrol prices sky-high -- and this could mean
the advent of the #10 gallon, over four times the current rate.
Is it acceptable, Finger on the Pulse asked Glasgow Chamber members?
Shall we all willingly forsake our cars to allow juggernauts and
overseas tourists ''doing Scotland'' in luxury coaches to have
unhindered access to our roads while we, presumably, either happily get
on our bikes or cheerfully queue for the 7.31 from Dunblane to Queen
Street? The response was varied but unanimous in condemnation of such a
measure.
Our first stop was The Greater Glasgow Tourist Board. We had a word
with Douglas Ritchie, Director of Leisure Tourism Marketing.
''Access and ease of transport is crucial to the success of tourism.
Most tourists won't visit places that are difficult to get to but, at
the same time, they will not come back to a destination which is
gridlocked and choking on car exhaust fumes. It is essential to develop
a balance between private and public transport. However, increasing the
price of petrol to #10 a gallon is not the way to encourage more locals
and tourists to use public transport.''
Frank Binni, Chief Executive of Scottish Design believes that the root
of the majority of Scotland's transport problems lie in poor planning
and design.
''The evidence of poor planning is all around us -- the narrow
car-clogged streets of Drumchapel designed without a recognition of the
growth of private car ownership -- or the crippling paralysis in the
Scottish Borders, the only region in mainland UK without a single
railway station. People on the move are like a leaking roof, the flow
will follow the least course of resistance. If it is easier to use
public transport, then it will be used. The #10 gallon is an attempt to
''triple felt'' the roof, perhaps we need to redesign the gutters. We
need to establish ways of managing the design of transport policy that
takes account of the fast changing horizons, goals and environment.''
Jim Hunter, director of KallKwik, believes that simply increasing the
cost of petrol will not solve our traffic problems.
''I believe that over the next few years, the alternatives to the car
will need to be examined in a big way. Improvements are needed in public
transport. We need to examine why people use their cars. Advances in new
technology should reduce the need for many journeys -- shopping from
home for example. Similarly, companies are already using video
conferencing to reduce travel needs. Here at KallKwik we will shortly be
part of a National Digital Network which will connect clients and
suppliers throughout the UK -- perhaps this is one of the ways
forward.''
David McCutcheon, director of Bullet Express, suggests looking to
Europe for some answers.
''For me, the #10 gallon is the wrong way forward,'' he said. ''This
cost would end up being added to the price of goods in the High Street.
Once fuel goes up, everything goes up -- it has to. We deliver daily to
Italy and France where a toll system is in operation on the motorways.
This tends to open-up the main routes, leaving them less congested for
road freight. This works in Europe and perhaps it would work here.''
As we all know, if you want to know anything about transport, call the
AA -- so we did! We had a word with Neil Greig, Roads and Environment
Officer for Scotland. He believes that the #10 gallon would bring no
environmental benefits and would be political suicide for any party that
promoted it.
''AA surveys show that 82% of motorists would not be put off by higher
petrol prices. The car is just too essential to their everyday life.
Unfortunately, the Government sees motorists as a soft touch for
ever-increasing taxes. Tax hikes don't work but incentives do -- the
switch to unleaded fuel proves this. The AA want to see tax reductions
for Scots motorists to switch to more fuel efficient and cleaner cars,
but we also want improved public transport to cut down car trips in our
cities. Politically, the #10 gallon is a dead duck -- our surveys show
that 55% of motorists would vote against politicians who try to price
them off the road. We also surveyed a cross section of MPs and 72%
agreed that increasing fuel costs would be a vote loser.''
So, over to Geoff Runcie, Chief Executive of The Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce and the driving force behind ''Getting Scotland Moving''.
''I do not believe that the big stick approach is the way to get
people to use public transport or to give a second thought to jumping
into their car. The #10 gallon is, for me, a big stick and at the end of
the day the additional cost will cascade down to the business
community's doorstep, further disadvantaging the cost structure from
which we have to compete in an ever-increasing international market. If
we are to achieve a balance between public and private transport for our
people, together with more efficient use of the road systems for our
goods and freight, then we need to help everybody understand how they
can play a part. We certainly need more reliable, consistently
high-quality services to encourage people to use the public transport
system but, equally, we need to give the service providers a commitment
that we will use the service. So a partnership must emerge between
service providers a commitment that we will use the service. So a
partnership must emerge between service providers and the consumers and
that must surely be the way forward. So, let's put away the big stick
and sit round the metaphoric table, understand the problem better and
decide how we, the business community, can play a part in releasing the
grid lock at a personal and corporate level.''
Getting Scotland Moving takes place at Glasgow's SECC on Thursday
March 30. Information from Conferenece Organisers Alan Clark Associates,

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi was dealt another body blow yesterday when Mars, the
American foods giant, which is one of the group's longest standing
customers, said it was withdrawing its worldwide account.
The shares tumbled 10[1/2]p to 94[1/2]p as analysts scaled back their
profit forecasts. Mars had made no secret of its dismay over the sacking
of Maurice Saatchi and its defection after a lengthy review of its
account does not come as a great surprise.
Nevertheless its loss is another major setback for Saatchi. The
account is worth some #30m in revenues, only 4% of the 1994 total but
analysts reckon it could knock up to #5m off profits, taking the
projected 1995 figure down to #32m.
The Mars account was handled mainly by Saatchi's US-based agency Bates
Worldwide. Around 300 people are believed to work on the account and
their jobs must now be at risk, though some may transfer to the new
holder of the account, which is not the new agency set by the Saatchi
brothers but Omnicom Group. Mars also has two other agencies which
remain in place.
The timing of the transfer has still to be fixed and in view of its
size it could take some time to complete.
The defection follows the loss of Mirror Group and Gallaher but the
most vital account is British Airways, said to be worth #60m. It is
currently reviewing its position after 11 years with the group.
BA is considering whether to stay with Saatchi or move elsewhere. It
is looking at three alternatives, the New Saatchi Agency, J Walter
Thompson, part of WPP, and Bartle Bogle &amp; Hegarty.

THE STOCK MARKET was placed firmly back on bid alert yesterday
following news of Hanson's plans to demerge 34 non-core US businesses
resulting in a reduction of #855m in Hanson's borrowings. Hanson's
gearing will drop by 20% to 38%.
The businesses, together with certain investments in associate
companies and property assets, have annual revenues of about $3000m
(#1890m) and are to form a new US company, US Industries, (USI).
Businesses within USI include Jacuzzi Whirlpool Baths, Tommy Armour
Golf, and Ertl Toys. Application is being made for USI to be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange.
The demerger will be effected by a special dividend to all holders of
Hanson ordinary shares and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), on the
basis of one new share in USI for every 100 Hanson ordinary shares. The
proposed demerger requires Hanson shareholder approval at an EGM. This
is expected to take place in May with the distribution of USI shares
being made in June.
Hanson emphasised that its non-core UK businesses such as Seven Seas
health and the Crabtree/Scholes electrical companies were unlikely to be
demerged. Hanson's chief executive, Derek Bonham, noted that about 11 UK
businesses had already been sold and that Scholes and Crabtree are in
the middle of being merged.
Scholes was bought for #100m last September. ''We want the benefit of
that coming through for our shareholders before we start talking about
other demergers'' he said.
The strengthening of Hanson's balance sheet had the City immediately
casting about for possible uses for this money, particularly given the
already healthy nature of Hanson's finances. Several companies have been
suggested as potential bid targets in the past including Yorkshire
Electricity, the Argyll group, owners of the Safeway supermarket chain,
and food manufacturer United Biscuits.
Hanson has expressed its interest in the electricity industry in the
past. In 1990, ahead of privatisation, it discussed a bid for PowerGen,
the smaller of the two electricity generating companies in England and
Wales. However, with a likely price tag of more than #4000m, PowerGen
seems an unlikely target. Hanson is thought unlikely to be interested in
the 40% stake being sold by the Government.
Shares in Yorkshire Electricity have been buoyed up in recent weeks by
the prospect of a Hanson bid and so yesterday's demerger news initially
saw the shares drop 14p to 839p before closing at 829p.
Philip Green, analyst at stockbrokers Nomura, said the demerger
signalled ''a strengthening of Hanson's coffers'', with Yorkshire or
another regional electricity company as a possible target.
The electricity sector has been the subject of intense bid speculation
following Trafalgar House's hostile bid for Northern Electric. If Hanson
decides to go shopping elsewhere then the whole sector might fall in
value.
Hanson's strategy is to develop its seven major businesses by capital
investment and bolt-on acquisitions although a move into an entirely
different business activity has not been ruled out. Other potential
items on the Hanson shopping list may include food companies.
Hanson's past interest in this sector was shown in its failed bid for
Rank Hovis McDougall. It was eventually outbid by the conglomerate
Tomkins. However, the competitive pressures facing commodity food
manufacturing and food retailing might deter Hanson from a purchase in
this sector.
In the past, there has been a view among some Hanson watchers that the
company ought to make a UK acquisition for ACT reasons. Christopher
Collins, director of corporate development at Hanson, said any possible
takeover will be judged on whether it will fit into the group rather
than for tax considerations.
Following the demerger, less than half the group's profits will come
from the US with the bulk derived from the UK. There is thought to be
considerable existing growth potential in the US particularly in the
Peabody mining business and Quantum chemicals, which was shown to be a
star performer in recently published first-quarter results.
Hanson is not known for resting on its laurels and so it seems likely
to be only a matter of time before a sizeable acquisition is made. In
the meantime,  news of the demerger coupled with the recent strong
trading statement saw Hanson shares add 6[3/4]p to 242[1/2]p.

NEW planning guidelines designed to protect Scotland's town centres
from out-of-town retail schemes will face ferocious opposition from
property consultants and retail chains.
The move is part of a bid to bring Scotland into line with England,
where major peripheral shopping schemes are now being severely
restricted.
For the first time, Scottish planners will have an exact measure as to
whether a proposed shopping scheme has a ''significant' impact on nearby
town centres or other outlets.
The draft National Planning Policy Guidance Note just issued by the
Scottish Office proposes that local authorities should not grant consent
for any new proposals which would have an impact of 10% to 15%. But
these figures are seen as inflexible by many in the property industry,
who claim each out-of-town scheme should be judged on its merits.
Richard Slipper, head of planning for property consultant Hillier
Parker Scotland, said: ''These figures are so arbitrary that the market
will have to give a resounding, negative response to the Scottish
Office. What if the centre which is losing trade to a new development is
of little status, or has been losing custom anyway because it has fallen
behind the times?''
He warned that the future of retail innovation in Scotland could be
under threat in the wake of the new guidelines. Recent research by his
firm shows that most retailers still have severe difficulty in finding
the outlets they want in town centres and there is an increasing demand
for out-of-town space.
''The planning system must respond to these requirements in the retail
market with a pro-active framework, rather than one which is re-active
and likely to lead to further constraint,'' he said.
Fraser Smith of property consultant Smith Newiss said that while he
was keen to see town centres thrive, the new rules would be ineffective.
''Rigid controls won't work. No amount of government protection can save
a town centre that is dying on its feet -- artificial protection only
prolongs the agony.''
He suggested that each town centre could protect itself against the
competition from out-of-town centres by improving its own retail
facilities.
If turned into law, the new regulations would hit the retail
development sector, affecting major schemes already proposed. ''I've got
retail clients who are very excited about big schemes like Braehead in
Renfrew or Glasgow's Buchanan Centre, anything that knocks those on the
head would be very disappointing,'' he said.

Mexico, Wednesday -- Mexican Treasury bill rates soared to nearly 60%
today as the government battled to meet the conditions of a $20bn rescue
loan from the United States.
The widely-watched rate on 28-day Mexican Treasury bills, known as
Cetes, leapt to 59% from last week's 40% in the central bank's weekly
auction of government securities.
It was the highest rate seen since May 4, 1988, when Mexico was still
struggling to emerge from the 1980s debt crisis it thought it had put
behind it for good.
Analysts said rates on everything from car loans to credit card
accounts and business loans will rise sharply as a result, adding an
intolerable burden on some individuals and companies. One analyst said
credit card rates could rise as high as 80%.
The rate increase -- aimed at throttling inflation and enticing
badly-needed foreign capital back to Mexico -- had an immediate effect.
On the secondary money market, where investors constantly jostle for
the best returns on their money by trading second-hand securities such
as Cetes, the benchmark T-bill rate rocketed a full 10 percentage points
higher from yesterday's close to 64%.
The peso fell sharply against the dollar today but the stock market
rose nearly 2% after suffering early losses. -- Reuter

A PAINTING by controversial war artist Peter Howson depicting an
apparent rape scene in Bosnia has been bought by Aberdeen Art Gallery,
and went on show to the public yesterday.
However, Dr Lindsay Errington, Keeper of Fine Art, does not expect the
same controversy to surround Howson's Serb and Muslim as did his
painting, Croatian and Muslim, which was rejected by the Imperial War
Museum.
The museum, which commissioned the Glasgow Art School graduate to go
to Bosnia, decided the explicit rape scene was too brutal for its
permanent collection. It was later bought by singer David Bowie.
The painting which Aberdeen Art Gallery has purchased cost #16,200
with the aid of a 40% grant. ''I think we got a masterpiece very
cheap,'' said Dr Errington.
The purchase was approved by Aberdeen district councillors.
She said Croatian and Muslim was a very explicit rape ''and it was in
my mind that sort of picture was not something I could acquire for
Aberdeen and which I could hang in a place where people might be
bringing their children''.
Shw went on: ''One had to find a picture that was truthful but wasn't
going to cause upset to people who come in with young children.
''It is a piece of living history. It is not yet a rape but a struggle
between a man and a woman.
''Their interlocked struggle has become a symbol of the Bosnian
tragedy as a whole and of the violence perpetrated by one race upon
another.''
The painting did not shock 71-year-old grandmother Dorothy Paterson,
of Aberdeen, who was one of the first to see it. A regular visitor,
sometimes with her grandchildren, she said: ''Nothing much shocks me
nowadays. It is a shocking world we live in.''

VOLUNTARY housing groups are to receive grants totalling #1m for the
rest of this year and for 1995-96, the Scottish Office announced
yesterday.
Funding of #112,000 is being provided for for 20 students taking post
graduate diplomas in housing and #136,000 is going to assist tenants to
exchange houses.
Those getting the largest sums also include the Scottish Council for
the Single Homeless, Shelter's law advice service, and the Chartered
Institute of Housing, which is getting an award for training about
compulsory tendering and how to tackle anti-social behaviour.
A total of #920,000 is being made available for grants in 1995-96 with
an additional #55,000 for this year.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Housing Minister, said that,
in a year when tight control over public spending was necessary, it was
vitally important to support the excellent initiatives by the voluntary
sector which continued to give good value for money for the taxpayer.
The awards were welcomed by Mr Gavin Corbett, Shelter's research and
information officer. But he said the Scottish Office showed ''huge
cheek'' by claiming the grants were a triumph, as they came just two
months after cuts of #175m, over the next three years, had been
announced in Scottish housing funding.

A GULF WAR tank commander told a murder trial yesterday how he was
recruited for a #185,000 bank raid.
Lance Corporal Robert Smith, 33, said the plan was that the raid, in
which Mr David Dunn, 63, was shot with a pistol brought back from the
Gulf, would be over in a flash and no-one would get hurt.
Mr Smith added that, strange as it might seem now, the attitude of his
two co-accused, Mr Gerald McQuade and Mr Paul Bootland, had persuaded
him that they were going into a safe venture.
''They just seemed not to be the type to go round blasting
willy-nilly.''
Mr Smith, who is in the Life Guards, was giving evidence at the High
Court in Edinburgh where the three men deny murdering Mr Dunn in
Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year. They also deny
attempting to murder an off duty policeman and two members of the
public.
All three are also charged with stealing #185,000 from the Bank of
Scotland on the same day.
Mr Smith said he had been in the Army since he was 18. He had seen
service in Northern Ireland and the Gulf, where he was a tank commander.
During his Army career he had received weapons training and was a
small arms coach. Of all pistols he was most familiar with the Browning
9mm, his normal Army sidearm. He also told the court he had trained with
the SAS in Belize.
In the Gulf he had been at the spearhead of the British advance under
the command of his squadron leader, Major James Hewitt.
He had swopped his gas mask with an American soldier in exchange for
the American's Glock 19 pistol.
Shown a gun in court, Mr Smith said: ''That is the exact weapon I
obtained in the Gulf.'' He agreed with a description of the weapon as
the best designed handgun in the world.
A firearms expert has previously told the court the Glock was the gun
used to shoot Mr Dunn.
Mr Smith said he had an unblemished record in the Army but got into
trouble on his return from the Gulf for bringing back ''contraband'',
including shotgun cartridges and distress flares.
Because of that he went on the run and at some point he was given Mr
McQuade's name as someone who might offer him work. ''I suspected it had
the potential of not being totally legal,'' he admitted.
He first met Mr McQuade, 40, in an Edinburgh pub about August last
year. Nothing specific was discussed but they met again in a pub about
10 days before the Bonnyrigg raid and specifically discussed the bank
robbery.
''It was put to me that it would be easy, nobody would get hurt and it
would be over in a flash and that's it.'' He wasn't given a location but
Mr McQuade said the amount of money would be substantial.
He was under the impression he had to give an instant answer and
because of that said he was interested.
Mr Smith said there was never any question of him being the armourer
for the raid. He had the Glock and understood that everyone else would
bring their own weapons. Mr McQuade had a revolver and Mr Bootland, 25,
the getaway driver, had a Browning.
''We all knew that we were going into the bank armed with weapons,''
added Mr Smith, but explained that Mr Bootland was to stay in the car.
Once inside the bank Mr McQuade would get the cash from the safe and
Mr Smith would stay on the customer side to act as ''crowd controller''.
Asked about the need for a gun, Mr Smith replied: ''The way I saw it,
it was a tool required for the job. If you give an order and you can
back it up with a gun people are more likely to do it. If you didn't
have a gun somebody would have a go at you.''
Mr Smith told the court that the raid itself went exactly to plan.
They had estimated it would take about a minute and they were in and out
of the bank in 55 seconds.
The trial continues.

A LEADING Scottish industrialist has warned that ''jobless growth'' is
here to stay -- and to make matters worse, the country has still to feel
the full impact on jobs of the liberalisation of Eastern Europe.
Jobless growth is the phenomenon whereby the economy improves, but the
subsequent increase in jobs is no longer automatic.
Dr Ian Preston, outgoing chief executive of Scottish Power, is
chairing the Scottish Council Forum in Gleneagles where business, local
government, and trade union leaders are debating how Scotland can cope
with the changing employment patterns brought about by the global
economy.
Speaking last night on the eve of the conference, Dr Preston said that
Western Europe still had to feel the full impact of a cheaper labour
market opening up in Eastern Europe. However, he argued that the answer
was for Scotland to identify new sources of comparitive advantage, claim
them for its own, and exploit them for all they were worth.
''We must try to see technological advance as an opportunity for
development rather than the road to redundancy. Flexible employment is
not just an euphemism for poor pay and conditions. It can also be a
potent force to liberate a wider range of talents to enrich our economy
and enhance our society.
''Global markets may indeed tempt some of our industry away in pursuit
of low cost but the converse of these forces can send us new ventures
seeking skill and ingenuity,'' he said.
He insisted there were good reasons to believe that Scotland could
succeed in the competitive intensity of the global market-place.
''Knowledge will be the key to much that happens in the future, and
all over the world Scots are believed to have an excellent education
system.''
One area being dicussed is whether Scotland's relative smallness can
be considered an advantage. Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the
Scottish Council Development and Industry, says that while the European
Union struggles to cope with the changes in employment, the economy of a
small country like Scotland is more manageable and should be able to
adapt quicker.
The 230 delegates will be producing specific proposals on how Scotland
can improve its job creating potential. There has been criticism of
previous forums that they were merely talking shops which achieved
little.
As business executives find it increasingly difficult to justify being
away from their work to attend a three day conference, more emphasis is
being placed on producing concrete proposals which can be enacted upon.
Dr Preston denied, however, that the non-political Scottish Council
was straying too far into the political field.

GUIDELINES to help Kirk members discuss sex outside marriage and
homosexual practices have been drawn up for consideration by this year's
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
The Kirk's panel on doctrine passed the guidelines in Edinburgh
yesterday and will ask the assembly to approve them for discussion by
kirk sessions and congregations. This represents a cautious step by the
Kirk into an area which has caused considerable controversy.
The assembly will not be asked this year to consider altering the
Kirk's traditional view that sex should take place within marriage and
that homosexual acts are wrong. Any decision to change the Kirk's
attitude in this area is not likely to be taken until a future assembly.
The 1994 assembly decided by 432 votes to 378 to have the guidelines
prepared after fierce opposition arose over a working party report on
the theology of marriage.
The report was passed by the panel last year by only eight votes to
six and led to the six opponents recording their dissent. They accused
the report of deregulating sexual activity and implicitly endorsing
premarital sex, cohabitation, and homosexuality.
It is understood the guidelines are being presented in the form of
dialogues which represent several points of view. The guidelines will be
made known when the panel on doctrine's report to the assembly is
published, probably next month.
Panel members agreed yesterday not to comment on the guidelines until
they are published as it was felt there should be an effort to avoid a
controversy like last year.

<HEADLINE>Strathclyde sets a budget #37m above Lang's limit</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND's largest local authority was braced for confrontation
yesterday with the Government after setting a budget #37m above the
Scottish Office capping limit.
Forced to consider cuts of #107m because of reductions in Government
grant, Strathclyde's ruling Labour group came up with savings of just
over #70m, including the loss of around 260 full-time posts and 800
temporary contracts.
The Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, gave an assurance that
there would be no compulsory redundancies at this stage.
He and his colleagues hope their high-risk strategy can be
underwritten by transferring #45m of revenue expenditure into capital,
which would cover the capping excess and keep the council tax increase
down to 15%.
Unfortunately, this will have an adverse effect on the capital budget
and present a further threat to jobs in both the public and private
sectors.
To run all the current services without cuts and meet new statutory
responsibilities, the region would have to put up council tax by 65%.
Should the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Ian Lang, block the
transfer from revenue to capital, then the council intends to challenge
him in court by judicial review.
The proposed 15% increase in council tax would mean another #56 a year
for a taxpayer on Band D, although the final figure will not be set
until the council's budget meeting on March 7.
Councillor Gould complained that Strathclyde was being targeted by the
Government because of its strong opposition to local government
reorganisation and the fact that Strathclyde's highly successful water
referendum had given the Government ''a bloody nose''.
The #70m package of cuts is comprised of a top slicing of council
services right across the board. It includes a 7.5% increase in rail,
bus and ferry fares (to be implemented on May 28), concessionary fares
increased from 25p to 30p, a 5% increase in school meals above the rate
of inflation (93p to 98/99p), and a #3.5m cut in the police budget.
Meanwhile, councillors in Central region have agreed to find savings
of more than #11m in the coming year.
Heads of department, including Chief Constable William Wilson, will
meet councillors in private on Monday to debate where the axe should
fall.
Savings of about #5m will come from what was described as good
financial housekeeping, but that still leaves more than #6m to cut from
spending departments.
Hardest hit will be education, expected to find savings of nearly #3m,
but council leader Corrie McChord pledged that services on the front
line, in the region's schools, would be protected.
Councillor McChord said the authority would stick to its policy of no
compulsory redundancies.
Details of how the cuts will affect individual services will be
revealed on February 28. The level of council tax for the coming year
will be revealed on March 7.
Aberdeen District Council's ruling Labour administration yesterday
fixed the council tax for 1995-96 at #190 for band D properties -- an
increase of #11.
They also decided the city's 32,000 council house tenants face a rents
increase of 70p per week, taking the average to #25.30.
Grampian Regional Council will fix its element of the tax on March 6.

Dublin
ON his return to Dublin, John Bruton, the Irish Prime Minister,
vigorously denied that the Framework Document which he launched earlier
in Belfast with John Major was a prescription for an unpalatable dose of
medicine for Ulster Unionists.
Despite the negative response from the Unionists, Mr Bruton received
all-party support for the document, especially its proposals for a
cross-border authority and a political commitment to remove the
Republic's territorial claim over Northern Ireland.
For years Unionists have complained that the Republic has imperialist
designs on their territory. This is the first time an Irish Government
has given a formal commitment to remove this perceived offence.
Ironically, the one criticism of this came from Fianna Fail, the main
Opposition party which regards itself as the guardian of republicanism.
Its leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, was critical that Mr Bruton had not tied
down a form of wording to replace the existing articles two and three of
the constitution.
With articles two and three no longer sancrosanct, times are obviously
changing in Ireland. Mr Major was warmly praised by Mr Bruton and
Opposition leaders for earning an important place in Irish history.
There was even praise for the founding father of Ulster Unionism, Sir
Edward Carson, with Mr Ahern quoting his plan for an All-Ireland
Consultative Assembly.
A more realistic note was struck by Mary Harney, the leader of the
Progressive Democrats, when she admitted that she was depressed by the
knee-jerk opposition of Unionists to the document.
This generally positive response by the Dail was encouraging for Mr
Bruton. Since replacing Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach in mid-December, he
has been under enormous pressure to consolidate the peace process and to
avoid blame for any loss of momentum.
Only two months in office, the 47-year-old Meath farmer has grown in
stature. Originally regarded with great suspicion by Sinn Fein, he
appears to have won their trust. He has worked well with Dick Spring,
the Deputy Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose central role
in the negotiations with Britain he generously acknowledged.
Like Mr Major, Mr Bruton is staking his political reputation on
selling their joint vision of the best way to achieve a historic
settlement in Northern Ireland.
To do so, the two premiers must convince both the Unionist and
Nationalist communities that their New Framework for Agreement is a
balanced shade of Orange and Green, worthy of negotiation at all-party
talks.
But Mr Bruton displayed some exasperation at this time-honoured
attitude of counting up the respective gains and concessions of
Unionists and Nationalists which he dismissed as utterly sterile.
Though a newcomer to the complex diplomacy of British-Irish relations,
Mr Bruton was both eloquent and impassioned in presenting the unrivalled
possibilities which could arise from a landmark change in relations
between the two political traditions in Ireland.
Mr Bruton's basic thesis is that ''a completely new dispensation'' is
required in the form of shared institutions to which both Unionists and
Nationalists can give allegiance, while retaining their identities and
traditions.
This would be based on a change in the Irish constitution by removing
its territorial claim to the North. The counterpart undertaking by
Britain will be to change the 1920 Ireland Act, which formalised the
partition of the island.
This will either be amended or replaced to affirm that the British
Government has no selfish, strategic, or economic interest in Northern
Ireland.
A further assurance to Unionists is contained in a little publicised
passage which suggests the drawing up of a charter or covenant
guaranteeing to protect the rights, interest, ethos, and dignity of the
Unionist community in any all-Ireland framework.
This is meant to address Unionist fears of absorption in a Roman
Catholic state. Since 1920 the Protestant population in the Republic has
shrunk from roughly 10% to 3%.
This section should strengthen Mr Bruton's Government when it holds a
referendum this summer to allow divorce in the Republic.
In an appeal to the Unionists to show open-mindedness, Mr Bruton
acknowledged that paper declarations could only go so far in providing a
solution to the Irish problem. ''As long as a significant section of
people feel systematically alienated from the structures of government,
no-one can feel secure,'' he said.
''Security does not come from constitutions or statutes. It comes from
knowing that your neighbour, of a different tradition, can feel that
same loyalty to the state, and can identify with it on the same terms of
equality and esteem, as you do. That's what we want for Northern
Ireland.''
No doubt, Sinn Fein will balk at Mr Bruton's enthusiastic talk about
loyalty to the Northern Ireland state.
If a package deal is negotiated by all the parties, and approved by
the people of Northern Ireland, Mr Bruton would hold a referendum to
alter the Republic's claim to jurisdiction over the whole island of
Ireland.

Belfast,
POLITICIANS filled with foreboding versus people desperate for a
continuing peace -- that is the gamble which the British and Irish
Premiers think is worth a wager.
On a day which was treated by the world's media as a watershed in the
troubled history of Irish politics, the two leaders stood shoulder to
shoulder in Belfast and pleaded with Irish men and women to give peace a
chance.
The tit-for-tat of the bullet and bomb was replaced by the trade-off
between North and South -- the Republic saying it was prepared to
rewrite its constitution to relinquish the territorial claim on the
North, while Unionists were invited to thole an all-Ireland council
comprising members of the Dublin and Belfast parliaments.
In direct questioning afterwards, Mr Major told The Herald the
Unionists were actually being offered an effective veto on decisions by
the proposed new North-South body.
''You put it in terms of a veto -- that's a harsh way to put it but
yes, it would have to be by agreement, that is unanimous,'' he said.
By this analogy, the North-South body would be similar to the European
Council of Ministers, where an effective veto operates for anyone
dissatisfied with a decision.
The Government clearly hopes that once the recognition of this veto
power sinks in, the Unionist communities' initial knee-jerk hostility
may fade and they might come to terms with the anathema of a
cross-border institution of this kind.
Indeed, Mr John Bruton, the Irish Premier, employed a gambling
metaphor to say that he considered it ''5-1 on'' that Unionists would
end up sitting around a table with the likes of Sinn Fein.
He called for a ''calm and measured consideration'' of what he
described as balanced and fair proposals which threatened no-one and
need cause no fear to any party.
''To the Unionist and loyalist people, I would point out that this
document commits the Irish Government to ask the electorate to change
the Irish constitution,'' he said.
He said it was also important to Unionists that the document contained
a recognition by both Governments of the legitimacy of whatever
constitutional choice is freely exercised by the majority in Northern
Ireland.
''The proposals will challenge the two traditions on this island but
will do so in an even-handed way,'' he said. ''Its purpose is to
facilitate, not pre-empt dialogue. At the end of the day, the people of
North and South respectively will have their say.''
Mr Bruton said the ending of paramilitary violence last autumn had
created an unrivalled opportunity for dialogue, a point taken up by Mr
Major who said: ''I know that many people will be worried, perhaps some
even pessimistic, about the future.
''But as we look at the hurdles ahead it is worth also considering
where we have come from. The dialogue of the deaf has ended. For four
years, we have been engaged in talks.
''We have had six months of peace. Prosperity and a normal life are
returning to Northern Ireland. The principle of consent, once accepted
only by Unionists and the British Government, is today accepted almost
everywhere.

THE people of Northern Ireland yesterday were offered an incentive to
encourage them to accept a new all-Ireland forum -- the return of their
own parliament in Belfast, writes Robbie Dinwoodie.
The details sound strikingly familiar to those campaigning for a
Scottish parliament -- a point made by the Scottish Opposition parties
at Westminster yesterday.
The Prime Minister said: ''Our proposals seek to restore democratic
accountability and the responsiveness to local needs in a way which
meets the unique traditions and circumstances of Northern Ireland.''
Substitute Scotland for Northern Ireland and it could have been a speech
from the floor of the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
Indeed, in an annex to the document, A Framework for Accountable
Government in Northern Ireland, a Government statement espoused clear
democratic principles of self-determination.
Although the proposed revival of Stormont does not envisage
tax-raising powers, the rest of the justification could scarcely be a
more impressive statement of devolutionist ideals.
However, the irony was not apparent for Mr Major as he set out the
benefits of a new assembly in the six counties of Northern Ireland, and
argued that the aim was to reinvigorate local democracy.
The framework proposals envisage a revived Stormont of about 90
members elected by proportional representation and discharging
legislative and executive responsibilities across Northern Ireland. A
committee system would reflect the relative strengths of parties and
those chairing these committees would become heads of existing Northern
Ireland Office departments, taking over responsibilities of existing
Ministers.
Those looking at the scheme from a Scottish point of view will look in
vain for any suggestion that the number of Northern Ireland MPs at
Westminster need be reduced, that the proposals are anything other than
a bulwark to the Union, or that there is any anomaly that could be
described as the West Lothian question or, as it has been dubbed, a West
Antrim question.
Mr Major said: ''The effect of our proposals would be to distribute
responsibilities fairly between the parties, according to their
electoral strengths, and to give their senior representatives
significant roles.''
For example, responsibility for the local management of health,
education, housing and agriculture would be put back in the hands of
Northern Ireland representatives.
In the Commons yesterday the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George
Robertson, said Ministers were guilty of ''double standards'' in
opposing Labour's demands, while proposing an assembly in Northern
Ireland.
However, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang dismissed this, saying: ''I am
surprised that you should be so keen to fall so far below the level of
events.
''If you cannot understand the difference between the circumstances in
Northern Ireland -- the history and traditions of that place, and the
great issues that are at stake in the Prime Minister's initiative
announced today -- you really do have a lot of homework still to do.''

PEACE and prosperity in Ulster were made an issue of trust yesterday
between the people of Northern Ireland and the governments in London and
Dublin.
Plans for a constitutional settlement and cross border fraternity were
applauded after the two Prime Ministers launched their peace initiative.
Only the Ulster Unionists seemed to be in disarray last night as
accolades came in from all over the world about the result of two years
of negotiations to keep the peace momentum thriving.
Mr Major received overwhelming cross party support in the Commons for
his work with the Dublin government to produce a scheme which might
bring Unionists and Sinn Fein to the negotiating table. Mr Major's
further plans for a devolved assembly in Belfast were also greeted in
both the London and Dublin parliaments.
Sinn Fein was giving the peace initiative a fair wind before its
crucial annual conference in Dublin this weekend. The CBI, reflecting
the mood of Ulster business, welcomed the momentum to continue the
ceasefire, now nearing its sixth month, and demanding that all the Irish
parties should get together to resolve a long term constitutional
settlement.
Last night, real leadership was being demanded both in Westminster and
the Irish parliament from the Ulster Unionists, who could still wreck
what is a historic occasion in the long history of UK-Irish dispute.
Unionist leaders James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley were left in no
doubt the general will is that they must respond in a way to keep the
hopes for peace alive.
On offer to the Unionists is the renunciation of the Republic's claim
under articles 2 and 3 of its constitution to the six counties of the
province of Ulster. On offer in a separate British Government document
is a Belfast assembly, without tax raising powers, but extensive
devolution of power to an Ulster parliament elected by proportional
representation with safeguards for minorities.
Mr Paisley and Mr Molyneaux are still trying to work out how to
respond to this new position, which will carry great weight in America
because of the alliance of the London and Dublin governments.
In the Commons yesterday the Prime Minister won great respect for his
passionate and commanding advocacy of this classic potential for solving
the Irish problem. The Ulster leaders were absent in Belfast but in a
rivetting response to two of Mr Molyneaux's colleagues Mr Major stated:
''I do beg you to examine more carefully what is in the document and the
way the document intends to proceed.
''I cannot accept that it drives Northern Ireland back 10 years to try
and seek a peace that may be permanently entrenched in Northern Ireland
after generations of mistrust and hatred. That is the purpose that
underlies all the actions that are here.''
Mr Major went on in a direct response to the Official Unionists: ''I
am prepared to say to you at this moment that for so long as I am here I
will keep troops on the streets of Northern Ireland for so long as it is
necessary to protect the people of Northern Ireland against terrorism
from whatever source that terrorism may come.
''If you want my message to the IRA it is that while they bomb, while
they kill they have an implaccable opponent in Downing Street and in
me.''
Earlier, Mr Major and Mr John Bruton had established for the world and
in particular the United States that a permanent peace is possible in
Ireland, along with prosperity if the political parties can accept the
prospect of a new era for North and South.
Mr Major told a Belfast news conference: ''I'm old fashioned, but I
think it is wrong for people to kill each other.''
Mr Bruton, who later in the Dublin parliament praised the vision and
courage of his predecessor, Mr Albert Reynolds, delivered the key factor
of Dublin's consent that Northern Ireland would remain British as long
as the population there desires to be so.
Nothing will happen unless the political parties in Ulster agree --
and then a proportional representation referendum would establish the
cement of a new future in British-Irish relations.
The two leaders highlighted in 17 words in their joint framework
document that their aim is to ''remove the causes of conflict, to
overcome the legacy of history and to heal the divisions.'' A solemn
mood in both the Commons and the Irish parliament afterwards -- across
party -- endorsed this sentiment and target.
Last night the Ulster Unionists were re-examining the position they
have adopted over the last three weeks. At first sight it appeared that
the one issue that fundamentally unites Mr Molyneaux and Mr Paisley is
that they resent the idea that security powers will be withheld from an
Ulster assembly and maintained by the British Government.
Mr Molyneaux issued a statement backing the move for peace but playing
for time. He said: ''It is clear that consultations will extend beyond
the lifetime of the present Parliament.''
He wants specifically a new group to be established chaired by the
Northern Ireland Security Minister Sir John Wheeler consisting of the
RUC chief constable, the general commanding the Army and the security
spokesman of the constitutional parties.
Mr Molyneaux is fully aware that the Labour Party led by Mr Tony Blair
fully supports the London-Dublin initiative and would not ally with them
to bring the Government down on this issue.
From Mr Paisley there was the characteristic bluster. His message to
Mr Major was: ''You have sold out Northern Ireland. You have sold out
the Union, but Northern Ireland people will keep their chins up and they
will finally win out.''
The Prime Minister, his Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew
and Minister Michael Ancram are agreed with their Dublin counterparts
that the momentum for a settlement will be sustained. Mr Ancram, who has
been the negotiating Minister throughout said last night: ''All the
balls are now in the air and they will have to fall to the ground.
''When that happens there will be progress. We have to let these
documents simmer for a while on the stove and let everybody consider it.
The immediate reaction is good.''

Belfast
A CRISIS summit was being staged in East Belfast last night by a
pan-Unionist coalition on the publication of the historic UK-Irish
Framework document.
The initial reaction to the release of the plans by Premiers John
Major and John Bruton was rage from Unionists, who saw red at the idea
of an all-Ireland institution described as the ''North-South body,'' to
comprise members of both the Dail in Dublin and a reconstituted Stormont
in Belfast.
However, with the mood on the ground markedly less hostile --
prosperity and freedom from fear during the six-month ceasefire having
their effect on hearts and minds -- there were signs last night that
Unionists are rethinking their stance to ensure that at the very least
their opposition is less strident and more considered.
A meeting was convened at the Democratic Unionist Party headquarters
involving representatives from the Rev Ian Paisley's party as well as
the official Unionists and members of Orange organisations. This was
scheduled for tonight but brought forward to last night because of the
morning's events at the Balmoral conference centre. There, Mr Major had
announced not only the joint governmental plan but details of a revived
Northern Ireland Assembly.
Pointedly not invited to last night's Unionist summit were members of
the Progressive Unionist Party and Ulster Democratic Party, the two
organisations which represent the paramilitary groups the UVF and UDA.
However, the PUP last night responded to the Framework document in a
more conciliatory way than the mainstream Unionist parties.
Although it condemned the document as not one for a settlement and
criticised its ''blatant bias towards Irish nationalism'' it added:
''However, the opportunity to inject a balance from the British Unionist
perspective should not be lost. Moreover, the Framework document is one
more position paper alongside a plethora of other political documents to
be thrown into the melting-pot for discussion.''
SDLP leader John Hume said that two years ago it would have been
unthinkable that violence could have ended in the Province. Welcoming
the document, he said: ''Dialogue has brought us to where we are, and
dialogue is the only way to bring us to agreement that will satisfy all
sections of our people, so let's keep very cool.''
There was some surprise that Sinn Fein also welcomed the publication
as ushering in a new phase of the peace process.
Party president Gerry Adams said: ''Publication of the document
following so soon after the Downing Street Declaration shows the
recognition of the need for change. As John Hume and I outlined in our
discussions, it is a matter for negotiation and discussion on how that
agreement is achieved.''
He said the document amounted to an acknowledgement of the failure of
partition and of British rule in Ireland. He poured scorn on the
supposed special relationship between Unionist leader James Molyneaux
and the British Government. ''Even the guarantees the British gave them
were useless at the end of the day,'' he said.

THE House of Commons yesterday cheered a historic and brave attempt to
bring permanent peace to ravaged Northern Ireland. A successful attempt?
Members knew the answer was hope, wait, and see.
Mr Major occasionally while making his statement achieved the
eloquence of blazing commitment and sincerity as he argued that what the
British and Irish Governments propose threatens no-one and holds out the
prize of permanent peace in the Province.
Labour leader Tony Blair, more naturally, produced some Kennedy-esque
phrase making as he stood metaphorically shoulder to shoulder with the
Prime Minister and made clear that a Labour government would do just
what this Tory one was doing.
There was little doubt that Mr Major would carry almost all the House
with him. The 13 he could not be sure of were, however, the crucial 13
-- the Unionists: nine Official, three Democratic, and one Popular. He
and Mr Blair bent their persuasive efforts to keeping them in the peace
process. On the other side of the Irish Sea Sinn Fein and the IRA
leadership were playing their cards close to their chests,
Manoeuvring their way through the quicksands of this centuries-old
debate, Ministers know that a word of encouragement too much to the
Unionists could be the last straw for the nationalists and vice versa.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Tory MP for Macclesfield, pointedly but
unhelpfully inquired how the Unionist objective of keeping Northern
Ireland in the UK and the IRA objective of getting Britain out of
Ireland were to be reconciled. Although there can be no logical answer,
Mr Major produced the only reasonable one: by persuading all the people
of the Province that each of its two traditions must yield something of
its historic aspiration in the interests of ridding their society of the
scourge of daily violence.
The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists boycotted the statement.
Only two of the Official Unionists were in their places although
another, Mr David Trimble, hovered by the Serjeant at Arms's chair.
Mr Ken Maginnis, generally regarded as one of the less hardline
Unionists, told Mr Major his Government had distanced itself from the
90% of the Province's people who eschewed violence.
The gulf between the different conceptions of the Irish problem opened
up as he angrily asked how Mr Major could endorse a document which said
that one of its primary objectives was to promote and establish
agreement among the people of the island of Ireland. He shouted: ''What
has that to do with Northern Ireland,'' which was part of the United
Kingdom.
''What's wrong with it?'' shouted Labour back benchers, some of whom
think a united Ireland is a good idea, some of whom are less than
sensitive to the Unionist fear of being lumped in with the other part of
Ireland where they will be a minority.
It is this fear the two governments have sought to overcome. A
Northern Ireland assembly, where the Unionists can expect to have a
majority, will have to agree the topics which the new joint North-South
body will consider, harmonise or execute and all that body's decision
making will have to be unanimous so the Unionist representatives cannot
be voted down.
Like wary jungle animals, the Unionists are poring over the document
looking for the trap. Why should Northern Ireland harmonise its policies
with the Republic when it is part of another country, complained Mr
Maginnis.
More ecumenical than most of his fellows, he was annoyed and worried
enough to describe the framework document as ''this dishonourable
blueprint for an all-Ireland,'' and suggested Mr Major would come to
regret driving Northern Ireland back 10 years, just as Lady Thatcher
came to regret signing the UK-Irish Agreement which gave the Republican
Government its first toehold on Northern Ireland affairs.
Mr Major, driven close to eloquence by his determination to convince,
said it was permanent peace he sought after ''generations of mistrust
and hatred''. His message to the IRA was that while they bombed and
killed they had an ''implacable enemy'' in Downing Street. If they were
prepared to give peace a chance they would find ''a ready ear''.
Earlier, he had told the House he was ''a unionist who wants peace for
all the people of the Union,'' and he cherished Northern Ireland's role
within the Union. One wondered how this line would play with Sinn Fein
and the IRA, but Ministers clearly calculated that their immediate
effort must be to keep the Unionists on side, leaving the nationalist
extremes for the moment to the Irish Government to reason with.
Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, said the problem could not be solved
without the agreement of the Unionist people, a proposition still lost
after many years on Mr Dennis Canavan, who demanded that no single party
should be allowed to jeopardise this historic opportunity.
Mr Major reminded him that it is the nature of this case that everyone
has to agree if anything is to be achieved. Most Great Britain Members
concentrated on reinforcing the Prime Minister's plea to all the
Province's parties to continue talking.
The most positive Unionist response came from Sir James Kilfedder, the
Popular Unionist who was Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly that
sat from 1982 to 1986. He urged that the Province be given a new
assembly as quickly as possible.
Mr John Taylor, the saturnine Unionist from Strangford, produced a
Delphic question which avoided his having to express an opinion himself.
Did Mr Major think the Union was more secure today than it had been the
day before?
Mr Major again replied well. ''The guarantee of the Union for the
people of Northern Ireland lies within their own will.'' They would
remain in the Union as long as they wanted to.
But there are enough references in the framework document to a United
Ireland to reinforce the permanent Unionist fear since 1985 that the
British and Irish Governments are conspiring to create mechanisms that
will gradually merge the Province with the Republic.
Such, one would take a substantial bet, is not Mr Major's intention
but, of course, without being his intention it could be the result of
his proposals.
In the end the Unionists are going to have to weigh this fear against
the prospect of permanent peace.
In the end the IRA is going to have to weigh the realisation that, at
best, a united Ireland is going to be a long time coming against what
they know of the desire for peace among the war weary community it
claims to represent.
It is perhaps in the people of the Province and their ability to
influence their leaders that Mr Major has most faith. Yet he has to try
to keep the politicians from pulling out of the peace process while the
public opinion he believes is mostly on his side has a chance to work.
The Unionists are angry and suspicious but no-one actually said: ''No.
This is the end.'' At the moment neither they nor the IRA seem to fancy
the responsibility. Mr Blair eloquently claimed that the agreement
between the two governments represents the key to the door of the house
of the peace that had stayed shut and locked for too many years.
''No doubt,'' he said ''entering in will pose its own risks and
challenges. But how much better that will be than to stay forever
outside, battered by the elements of hatred and mistrust.''
On this rare occasion a leader of the Opposition found a phrase to
praise and encapsulate the policy for which a Prime Minister had worked
so valiantly -- ''Let hope shape history.''

<HEADLINE>Prescriptions to cost #5.25</HEADLINE>

PRESCRIPTION charges are to rise by 50p to #5.25 from April 1, the
Government announced yesterday. The increase was condemned last night by
doctors and pharmacists, and by Labour MPs, who also attacked the way in
which the House of Commons had been told about it in a written reply.
Fees for prescription prepayment certificates will rise to #27.20 for
a four-month certificate and #74.80 for an annual certificate, Health
Minister Gerald Malone said in the written reply. The maximum charge for
a single course of dental treatment begun on or after April 1 will go up
from #275 to #300.
The BMA in Scotland were quick to criticise the Government's decision
and called for an immediate review of anomalies in the system.
A spokeswoman said: ''Once again, it is people on low incomes, just
above the level that would allow them to qualify for exemptions, who are
the hardest hit.'' She added that the BMA feared people would be scared
to consult their doctor as a result of the rises.
The Shadow Health Secretary, Mrs Margaret Beckett, immediately
condemned the increases, pointing out that, if the 1979 prescription
charge of 20p had kept pace with inflation, it would now be 52p.
Instead, it had gone up 10 times that amount, she said.
Mr Malone said the new charge ''is still significantly less than the
average total cost of a single prescription item to the NHS''. He added:
''In 1993-94, the drugs bill for the Family Health Services was over
#2900m. The new charge will raise over #310m for the NHS in 1995-96.''
Free medicines continue for children under 16, pensioners, and anyone
receiving income support, family credit, or disability working allowance
and their partners.
Mr Malone also pointed to an Audit Commission report from last year
which highlighted fraud amongst some GPs and pharmacists, which he
claimed cost the NHS around #30m, which could be spent treating
patients.
Mr Jim Devine, health officer of the public sector union Unison, said:
''This Government has increased the cost of going to the doctor well in
advance of the rate of inflation.''
Doctors will end up assessing the patient's ability to pay as well as
his or her medical condition, claimed Dr Stewart Holms, senior partner
in an Ayrshire practice.
He said: ''Increasingly, the doctor will allow cost to influence
treatment. Instead of prescribing two preparations that will clear up
the problem totally at a cost of #11, the doctor will prescribe one
medicine which will deal with the most pressing aspect because he thinks
the patient can only afford to pay one charge.''
Dr Holms's claim that patients given multi-item prescriptions would
increasingly ask which medicine they could do without was backed by Mr
Andrew Taylor, chairman of the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council.
He said people ''caught in the poverty trap'' already asked his
members for their advice on which medicines to ignore and predicted that
the situation would get worse as a result of this ''unwarranted
increase''.
The announcement in a written reply was attacked by Mrs Beckett who
protested in a point of order that Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley
had not said anything about the rise when she had spoken in a debate in
the House on Tuesday.
Deputy Speaker Dame Janet Fookes replied that the way the announcement
had been made was in order ''even if members do not like that particular
method of handling the providing of the information''.
Labour MP Ian McCartney (Makerfield) recalled a ruling by Speaker
Betty Boothroyd in March 1993 about the release of such information in
written replies. He quoted her from Hansard as saying: ''I wish to make
it clear that I deprecate the use of the pursuant device by Ministers to
make written statements such as this without giving proper notice to the
House.''

JOHN Major stood like a geography teacher waiting for the class to
give its full attention. His benign awkwardness spread to John Bruton,
as it were the visitor to the school, and both hovered at their lecterns
in front of a battery of cameras on collective auto-drive and a world's
press unmoved to silence.
It was an inauspicious delivery for the framework document, but that
might have set a well-judged tone for a calm response in Belfast
yesterday. Six months of ceasefire have confirmed the value of
unexplosive moments.
Even so, the British Prime Minister's indulgence was suspended a few
seconds too long to pull the plug on an intrusive commentary from
broadcaster Eamonn McCann, who has a habit of upstaging important news
conferences in this part of the world by getting in the first words.
''Typical,'' he snorted, making fully audible his irritation as Mr Major
appeared to seek permission to commence. ''Organised chaos.'' It was
more like disorganised placation.
It was true that the photographers had won their favoured positions in
the front two rows after hard negotiations with the Northern Ireland
Office on Tuesday night. They had also reduced the space between the
lecterns of Mr Major and Mr Bruton from eight to three feet in order to
embrace the pair in a single photo frame. This was another kind of
framework. These concessions suggested that the word might be secondary
to the image, the text secondary to the gesture, in the launching of a
peace document that had been heavily leaked and debated in advance.
Everything seemed to conspire towards an incongruity that managed to
reduce the presentation of threat in a joint communique that the Rev Ian
Paisley had been previewing as a declaration of war on the Union.
The polished dance floor of the Octagon Suite in the Balmoral
Conference Centre even managed to imply that the British Premier and the
Irish Taoiseach might be prepared to fandango for peace. Indeed, Major
and Bruton was just the latest in a string of attractions promoted at
the venue and the adjoining King's Hall in recent times. Torvill and
Dean skated over thinner ice here. Gary Glitter, Take That, and Chris De
Burgh sang with no less open hearts.
The surrounding 40 acres is the site of Belfast's annual agricultural
show, scene of no less careful schemes of cross-breeding. Barry McGuigan
fought here, but yesterday was no time for discussing ring-craft.
Hillsborough Castle, the Queen's residence in Northern Ireland, might
be suitable for summit breakfasts, the joint diplomatic corps must have
decided, but the launch of the framework document had found neutral
ground. Chosen for reasons of pure space, claimed the Northern Ireland
Office yesterday, pointing to the 380-seating plan for journalists and
three rostra for television cameras and their crews.
Despite the glare of attention, seasoned political observers remarked
that the biggest surprise was how low-key an affair it had turned out to
be. It was a strangely accurate assessment of what nevertheless remained
an important historic moment.
Outside in the drizzle there was a feeble protest by a handful of
Unionists. What they lacked in numbers and vocal strength, they salvaged
only in the display of Union Flag umbrellas. Rather jolly they were,
colourful red, white and blues against an implacably grey Belfast sky.
Only a mile away the Republican flag hung damply outside the deserted
frontage of Sinn Fein headquarters on the Falls Road in the late
morning. Up in the Turf Lodge estate there was little sense of
momentousness as only a few folk braved the elements to shop. Hailstones
cannoned down Lanark Way and the deserted peace line control, now
unmanned, gave access to a busier Shankill Road.
The impression in what the document calls, with respectful euphemism,
''the two traditions'', was of a thoughtful silence. It was of
communities prepared to absorb and evaluate the peace initiative.
If so, the people of Belfast would have to wait a few hours more as
the first reactions were televised. No copies of the document were
available at either the Falls Road or Shankill Road post offices. None
were expected.
In these areas of West Belfast where unemployment approaches 85%, the
urgency in post office queues is to cash giro cheques and pensions
before obtaining documents.
From both I was directed to the main GPO at Castle Place in the city
centre. By midday the first editions of the Belfast Telegraph were on
the streets with a special four-page supplement containing the full
text.
''Is it that document they're all talking about?'' I was asked in a
fruit shop, in what has always been seen as a loyalist stronghold and
scene of IRA bombing attacks right up to the ceasefire six months ago.
''I'll need to read that tonight,'' she said.
Everywhere, people declined to comment until they had read for
themselves. That made an obvious point about being prepared at least to
consider the opportunity.
In the Berlin Arms, regularly targeted before the ceasefire as an
ultra-hard line pub associated with planning loyalist paramilitary
operations, the mood was surprisingly upbeat. ''Compromise is necessary
to end any war,'' I was told, and even if names were withheld for
quotation, just as the entrance door remained locked, with a security
buzzer in operation, the message was as surprisingly open as the mood
was relaxed.
Unionists are portrayed as villains of the peace because someone else
has to fit that bill now that negotiations with the IRA have gained
ground, was the line offered.
''It's time our politicians stopped saying 'No' and started talking,''
said Mr Eric Geddes, up the road at the 1st Shankill branch of the
Northern Ireland Football Supporters Club. The talk there was of Ulster
Unionist MP David Trimble's performance on live television, storming out
of an interview when a picture of Mr Martin McGuinness was flashed on
screen to accompany his telephone contribution.
Opinion was divided. No debate with terrorists, said some. ''With
politicians like that, no wonder we get nowhere,'' said another voice,
critical of Mr Trimble. Mr Major's ''dialogue of the deaf'' may not have
ended entirely, but it is hearing more shades of moderate opinion in
previously staunch quarters.
The six-month peace has played its big part in changing attitudes.
Everyone is desperate for its continuation. A resumption on the British
mainland is regarded as more likely than a return to violence in
Northern Ireland if the peace initiative breaks down.
The most healthy product of the ceasefire is that folk have discovered
the luxury of moaning about other things. The perennial complaint now is
over police crackdowns on relatively trivial offences: unrenewed tax
discs, TV licences, seat belts, parking offences and bald tyres. ''The
cops have lost that much overtime, they've got to do something else
these days,'' was a typical remark. ''They've been on the gravy train
for too long.''
Elsewhere in the city they might point to new investments encouraged
by stability or to house prices rising 7%. They might notice the sudden
emergence of new restaurants and the increase in nightlife activity, at
least until the credit card bills started to come in. But on Falls Road
the big advance is reflected in the woman who says she can now leave her
hall door open, or the man who says he can walk down the street without
glancing apprehensively over his shoulder.
The most ominous part of this latest development in the peace process
is that it puts words to a freedom that people have been learning to
experience, but didn't dare to acknowledge in case it was endangered.
That is the real human investment, and when people whisper of hope, of
the personal hope they dare to entertain, it is the bravest word of all.
On Falls Road they tell you they are praying for it to work.
''Peace is the fruit of justice,'' I was warned in the Divine Mercy
Centre on Falls Road, a privately run shop selling religious
iconography. ''But in the absence of justice there can't be any
sustained peace. And a cessation of violence doesn't yet mean peace.
Everyone wants it. But not at any price.'' The last phrase is identical
to that used continuously by Unionists. It is the reverberating echo in
Belfast, but no-one has yet calculated what is meant by the price.
That is what the waiting and the scrutiny is devoted towards.
''In the final analysis it's the paramilitaries that are now speaking
sense,'' said Mr Ray McAleavey, a teacher at St Paul's School for
travelling children. ''They have seen enough of their people dead.
Anyone who breaks the peace now would not be forgiven. There would be
absolutely no nationalist support.''

GLENCOE mountain rescue team will resume a search this morning for
three climbers who were reported overdue last night near Coire na
Tulaich, Buachaille Etive Mhor, Glencoe.
The mountain rescue team had to call off the search because of
blizzard conditions. It will resume at first light.
Earlier, two skiers and two climbers had been reported missing in
separate incidents.
The Cairngorm mountain rescue team was called out after the two
cross-country skiers were reported overdue in blizzard conditions near
Loch Avon on the south side of the mountain.
However, early this morning, police said the skiers had turned up safe
and well.
The Cairngorm Chairlift Company used loud-hailers in the afternoon to
mount a ''controlled evacuation'' of 1500 skiers from the slopes, as
severe gales threatened to whip up snow-drifts and block the ski-access
road.
Meanwhile, another rescue mission found two climbers who were reported
to have fallen through a snow cornice on 4241ft Cairn Toul in the
Cairngorms.
The search was conducted by members of the Braemar mountain rescue
team. Many of the men in the team had been recovering from exhaustion
after the gruelling four-day search for cross-country skier Andrew
Wilson at nearby Glenshee.
The two climbers were with a companion when they disappeared through
the snow overhang near the top of Cairn Toul, two miles southwest of Ben
Macdui.
The third climber carried out a search but failed to locate them. He
then made his way off the mountain, one of the highest in Britain, to
raise the alarm some three hours later.
Just before 10pm, the two missing climbers were found safe and well
and flown to the search headquarters at Braemar.
The climbers were named as Mr Thomas Burke, 29, of McColl Avene,
Tullichewen, Alexandria, and Mr John Angus, 53, of Pappart, Bonhill,
Alexandria. Their colleague who raised the alarm was Mr Michael Goldie,
24, of Meadowbank Street, Dumbarton.
Meanwhile, Mr Wilson, the cross-country skier who survived four days
in Arctic conditions in the mountains near Glenshee, was making a good
recovery in hospital. He may be allowed to return home tomorrow.
Doctors at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, who are amazed at how well Mr
Wilson stood up to the sub-zero temperatures, will assess his medical
condition today before deciding whether he can return to his home in
Glasgow.
His ordeal is thought to be the longest time, outside military
exercises, that a skier has survived in such conditions in Scotland.
Mr Wilson, 44, of Crofton Avenue, Croftfoot, was flown to Ninewells
Hospital on Tuesday after being spotted by a helicopter. He is being
treated for hypothermia, exhaustion, and mild frostbite in his toes.
