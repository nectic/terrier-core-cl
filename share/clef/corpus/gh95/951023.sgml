Norman Crawford faces the sands of time in a country where the ancient
civilization sits easily with twentieth-century life.
ASK a wide selection of people what Egypt means to them and the
replies will no doubt conjur up the splendour of the Nile, the pyramids,
the Sphinx, and the story of Tutenkhamun.
The first-time visitor to Egypt today can start with a series of
panoramic views. Turning south near Cyprus, it is not long before the
north coast of Africa comes into sight, in the form of the long golden
sandy beaches of Alexandria.
Even from a great height it is possible to discern well-travelled
trade routes and very rare glimpses of what look like village dwellings
and possibly trading posts.
Continuing the journey south of the same altitude, it is quite
remarkable to see and recognise the Nile -- the blue Nile flowing north
in almost a straight line, bounded on each side by a relatively narrow
strip of greenery -- the fertile area fed for centuries by soil washed
down from the African mountainous regions -- thus enabling it to have
two or even three crops in a single year. Beyond this green strip is
desert -- the Sahara desert does come this close to the Nile.
Luxor airport, small by international standards, exudes a friendly
atmosphere. On arrival ''welcome to Egypt'' was repeated many times --
even at passport control. In the public areas there is almost
overwhelming help dictated by their phenomenon of ''baksheesh''. It is
ever-present throughout Egypt, openly and obviously making clear that
''baksheesh'' is expected for even the smallest assistance. Their signal
for payment is automatic -- rubbing the inside of their fingers with
their thumb. Be prepared and there is no problem.
To leave Luxor airport for the town centre is strange. There are
virtually no cars, taxis of course, and roads devoid of traffic lights
and congestion. The local population in their dignified garb use donkeys
a great deal -- riding backwards and sometimes carrying sacks of goods.
Immediately there is an impression of a different country, a different
culture, a people conscious of their marvellous heritage who dress
appropriately for a warmer climate.
It is with proper pride that the development of the tourist industry
in Luxor is recognised. The excellent hotels, tourist gift shops, and
banking facilities with arrangements for tourists are concentrated in
one area -- but the real thriving market areas are very convenient. It
is probably worth stating that with proper wisdom prices are quite
reasonable and good value for money.
The Luxor Museum is not large but can point briefly to special items
in the history of the area. The Luxor Temple, built around 1400 BC, is
small when compared to the Karnak Temple to which it is linked with the
complexes of temples, sacred lakes and a grand avenue of sphinxes. These
represent greatness of building works standing over 2000 years --
excavations as recent as 1989 revealed 25 statues in perfect condition.
Leaving the East Bank, a short ferry ride takes you to the West Bank
-- and the Valley of the Kings. This whole area, not served by a road
system until recently, is breathtaking in its enormity, the tombs hewn
out of solid rock. It was noted that these excavated tombs replaced
pyramids as the burial place of the pharaohs about 1500 BC.
It is remarkable when excavation details are examined that it was as
late as the 1920s before the tomb of Tutenkhamun was discovered. The
robbers of the past had missed it too so all the treaures which it
contained are preserved for posterity in the Egyptian Museum of
Antiquities in Cairo -- a visit to the site is the only way to
appreciate its magnificence.
The one-hour flight from Luxor takes you to Cairo, the largest city in
Africa. This is a city getting on with its business: friendly as you
walk with every confidence and feeling of safety. Traffic in Cairo is
another matter -- it makes Glasgow, London, or even Paris, seem orderly
and problem free.
The Egyptian Museum is a must for any visitor to the city with the
enormous and fabulous collection from Tutenkhamun's tomb deserving
priority. The museum's vast collection could take years to study.
Modern Cairo has developed with the times and now has a modern
stadium, a National Culture Centre (Opera House) and is recognised as an
architectural masterpiece of Islamic Design. If time permits visit the
fascinating Mosques and other Islamic buildings and Christian monuments
which date back to the third or fourth century with origins in the old
city of Babylon.
Cairo more than anything suggests the Pyramids -- on the very edge of
this densely populated city which is the neighbour to the Sahara desert,
travel down a major thoroughfare, Avenue Pyramids, and there they are.
At first the tops peep out above adjacent buildings but going a little
further gives you the view amazingly like photographs we have all seen.
The pyramids on this site are up to 450ft and once again the setting and
the enormity of the area has to be experienced to be fully understood.
There are camels, dressed-up tourist rides, and photographs (all in
return for a little baksheesh). Equally interesting are the horses
ridden bareback by young Egyptians showing skill, speed and
fearlessness. Exploring the site on foot between the valleys you
suddenly realise that there she is, the Sphinx. A large and impressive
monument, with Egyptians hoping that some day the British Museum may
return her nose and chin.
Before visiting Egypt read a little of the long, fascinating history,
be prepared for the ''baksheesh'' habit which is perfectly normal, and
be prepared to bargain with traders (even the taxi drivers).
Egypt with its history, a mythology stretching back at least 10,000
years and monuments built with great ingenuity in 4000 BC has so much to
offer.

THE Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow is the venue
on October 25 and 26 for two important dedicated exhibitions -- the
Scottish Handling and Storage Exhibition, and the Scottish Solids
Handling Show. Together, the two events present a marketplace for
everyone involved in the movement, storage and control of unit loads and
bulk loose solids.
The Scottish Materials Handling Exhibition presents the ideal
opportunity for suppliers from all over Britain to contact new customers
and build business in this expanding marketplace. For buyers, these
exhibitions offer industry a means of sourcing new equipment, new ideas,
and new products to help in the cost-effective management of all forms
of product -- from raw materials to finished goods.
With so much production overhead consumed by materials' handling and
storage, any saving or increased efficiency in this vital area will make
a meaningful impact on the profit and loss account.
Around 120 exhibiting companies are taking part in this combined
event, and will be displaying the latest solutions and the most
up-to-date equipment for warehousing and distribution, food and other
processing, chemical and pharmaceutical production, order picking and
sortation, transit packaging, storage of all kinds of materials, bulk
and unit load conveying.
Scottish companies are well represented at the exhibition and one of
those taking part is Valmar Handling Systems. Based in East Kilbride,
the company is a leading specialist in sideloader equipment and is
Scottish distributor for Kalmar Irion and LMV products as well as
attending to the demand for refurbished vehicles and contract hires. It
is currently organising new premises in Aberdeen and has satellite
depots in Grangemouth and Ayrshire.
On the Axis Scotland stand will be featured the Redirack pallet
racking systems, a new production benching which has been jointly
developed with Kaymar and Buko shelving systems for the catering,
refrigeration and healthcare applications. Belt-drive conveyors
exclusive to Axis and NC Brown lockers will also be exhibited.
Also in the palletising market is the Argonaut palletising robot which
will be one of the attractions at the Rynex stand. The addition to the
product range follows a recent agreement between conveyor systems
specialist Gramac and Bankside Industrial Engineering.
Another Scottish company present at the exhibition will be Fairway
Forklift Trucks, a Hillington-based business that was formed three years
ago by Frank Brown and Robert Bruce. They have seen their market share
increase from 4% to a significant 22% for new equipment sales in central
Scotland.
At the Solids Handling Exhibition, Glen Creston Ltd a specialist in
providing machinery for laboratory and production-scale applications,
will have on display its classic de-lumping roll crusher and a number of
laboratory-scale machines for sample preparation and sample division.
The company has been in business for 40 years and specialises in
finding the right machine for the job. Peter Jackson, Glen Creston's
project engineer said: ''Most industrial operations have their research
and development laboratories and anyone coming to see heavy industrial
plant at this show will be delighted to see that we can cater for their
laboratories as well.''
Dust Control (Scotland), an independent British company will also be
exhibiting at the show. It specialises in the design, manufacture and
installation of environmental engineering equipment, modulised packages
and complete process systems.
The company is organised into three main divisions and offers services
in the fields of environmental systems, materials handling systems and
design/process equipment.
Glasgow Caledonian University's Centre for Bulk Solids Handling has a
stand at the exhibition which explains its work in the field of
pneumatic conveying instrumentation, hopper design and material
characterisation. The Centre also provides independent research and
consultancy and educational services to industry at home and overseas.
Admission to both exhibitions is free of charge, and visitors may pass
freely from one exhibition to the other. Further information may be
obtained by contacting David Tinsley or John Garnett at DMG Trinity,
telephone 01895 677677.

INTEREST RATES
THE debate about the next move in interest rates and also possible tax
cuts is likely to be fanned today with publication of provisional third
quarter GDP which will be carefully studied for what it reveals about
the slowdown in the UK economy in the run-up to the Budget.
The authorities are still arguing that it is merely a pause and that
next year will see growth resumed at a more sustainable rate.
Market projections are for 0.5% growth in the third quarter over the
second which would mean annual growth of 2.3%, down from 2.8%
previously.
Probably the majority market analysts still take the view that
decelarating growth is temporary but some business groups such as the
Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors are
considerably less confident than they were.
The IOD's director-general Tim Melville-Ross has even openly indicated
that he believed it could be serious and that the recovery could be
faltering, while the CBI said that the next move in interest rates
should be down, although only when it can be shown to be sustainable.
Neither believes there should be personal tax cuts, without a
commensurate reduction in public expenditure.
The CBI's Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey, another key economic
pointer for the Chancellor when he does his sums, is out tommorrow.
In August, the CBI was suggesting that base rates would have to rise
by a further [1/2]-point at the end of the year to dampen down any
residual inflation threat. But since then it has changed its mind as
fresh evidence has accumulated about the performance of the economy.
Tommorow's industrial trends survey is likely to confirm that rates
should not be raised and will probably left on hold until the end of the
year.
The housing and construction market remains in a bad way, prompting
continuing calls for the Chancellor to provide a boost in his budget. It
is by no means certain that he will oblige on this score though there
could be some sort of token gesture.
The abolishment of stamp duty on housing deals is one suggestion but
this may have only a short-term impact. According to CBI
Director-General Adair Turner, the best way to help construction is to
create a climate where interest rates can lowered.
There are still those who are worried about inflation, especially
after the the rise in underlying rate in September to a two year high.
And while the Governor of the Bank of England is no longer calling for
an immediate rise in base rates, in the minutes of his early September
monetary meeting with the Chancellor he is still warning about the
dangers of delay to the Government's target of reducing the underlying
rate to 2.5% or less over the next two years.
Financial data continues to send out conflicting signals but certinly
high street spending remains subdued with consumer confidence still
muted.
No transformation looks in prospect unless the Chancellor does pull
something special out of the hat on November 28.

DOES the mobile phone sound the deathknell for the payphone? For the
first time the portable is starting to impact on the number of calls
made over public payphones.
The impact is patchy but overall in the past six months this call
volume has fallen by up to 5% which is a major change from the 10%-15%
annual growth seen in recent years.
It reflects the move of the mobile phone from businessman's toy to
consumer accessory. Yet millions more people use payphones than have a
mobile phone and this will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
An independent vote of confidence in payphones has recently come from
the acquisition of former Mercury sites by an Italian phone
manufacturer, IPM. Mercury failed to make a go of its payphones largely
because they were card-only. Now IPM is carrying out trials of its
phones in Scotland.
In the longer term, mobiles have a problem with privacy.
Communications psychologist Guy Fielding explained: ''Mobile phones have
a fragile and ironically 'public' quality which you don't find in a pay
booth, which is stable, solid and semi-private. These things can effect
the way you speak and the things you choose to talk about.''
Bob Warner, who heads BT Payphones, likes to tell the story of the
senior executive in Cellnet, BT's mobile phone network, who frequently
dived into phone booths not to use the payphone but have some privacy
when using his portable.
So there is no danger of the corner call box disappearing as a result
of ''progress''.
Indeed, BT is still installing new ones at the rate of 1000 a year.
The overall number has increased dramatically from 77,000 in 1989 to
130,000 at present. Mr Warner said hs company will still look
sympathetically on requests for new installations even in isolated
places. It does not take many calls to justify a new payphone as running
costs are low.
Nevertheless BT is looking to its laurels and BT Payphones, which is a
separate division within the group, is going down that fashionable route
of ''adding value'' to its service.
Currently in hand is the replacement of ordinary phonecard or cash
only machines with multi-payment units which take cash, BT phonecards,
and chargecards as well as ordinary credit cards.
There are currently 700 such units in Scotland, with 250 in Glasgow.
Then there is a credit card phone incorporating a computer port enabling
a personal computer or fax machine to be plugged straight into the phone
network.
There are about 44 of these in Scotland, located in travel centres
like airports, stations and motorway service areas. Also coming in at
similar locations are payfax machines. Some 200 at #10,000 a time are
expected to be operating by the end of the year.
Currently being tried out in the Isle of Wight is a ''smart'' phone
card incorporating a microchip. They will facilitate the introduction of
other services and will gradually replace conventional cards. More
ambitious still is the Mondex cash card being developed with Midland and
National Westminster Banks.
Currently being tried out in Swindon, these act as an electronic
purse. Using the appropriate code and numerical password, money can be
downloaded using a ''smart'' phone from the holder's bank account into
the card's memory. When used in a participating shop the money is
deducted from the card and credited to the shopkeeper. Around 5000 cards
have been issued.
The installation of 55,000 ''smart'' phones will provide the platform
for any new initiatives such as motorway tolls, cards like Mondex and
electronic yellow pages.
However, BT Payphones is not about to move wholesale away from cash
phones to card phones, though the trend is firmly in that direction
across the Channel, with for example virtually no cash phones left in
France. But according to Mr Warner it is not what custoemrs want. Up to
85% of payphone usage is still with coins.
BT Payphones has taken steps to reduce theft, the main problem with
cash phones, and there were 5000 fewer attacks on payphones last year
and losses were halved to #5m, though they stil numbered 17,500, 13% of
the total number of phones.
At the same time as the numbers of payphones has risen their image has
greatly improved from the bad old days. Five years ago 30% were out of
action at any one time and they were generally dirty and unwelcoming. It
was all blamed on vandalism but in fact was simply a failure of
management.
It was obvious that BT had turned its back on them. They were an
expensive backwater when the future was a heady mixture of fibre optics,
data communications and mobile phones.
Only when it was realised that the poor image reflected badly on the
whole company was something done and the improvement has been dramatic.
Now 19 out of 20 are working at any one time.
BT received a lot of bad publicity when it began scrapping the old red
phone boxes, which dated from a 1936 design. It was widely condemned as
an act of vandalism, particularly given the charmless units which
replaced them.
Despite the economic arguments for scrapping the boxes, BT eventually
realised it was bad for its image and the policy stopped. Those that
have disappeared have gone for good but the 17,000 which remain are said
to be safe.

MANUFACTURING
MANUFACTURING pay awards averaged 3.5% provisionally in the three
months ending September 1995, according to the lates CBI Pay Databank.
This compares with 3.4% for the three months ending June and 3% for
the three months ending September 1994. Difficulties in passing on price
increases in the face of consumer resistance are a restraining factor.
Pay awards in service firms averaged 3.4% provisionally over the same
period compared with 3.5% in the three months ending June 1995 and 3.9%
for the third quarter of 1994.
Like the recent official average earnings figures, the the CBI
findings indicate that at present wages do not pose a serious
inflationary threat. Manufacturers continue to report that their
inability to raise prices is the most influential downward pressure on
their pay awards (cited by 40%, down from from 47% a year ago). Low
levels of profits were cited by 24% and the cost of living by 18%.
Manufacturers also report productivity gains which average 4.7%
provisionally over the year to the third quarter of 1995, which compares
with one in five manufacturers and one in nine service firms a year ago.
There have been very few changes in working time in the last year,
with just 1% of firms having reduced their basic working week.

LESSONS on the field of play have been the main thrust of most comment
during the past week following further failures in the European
challenges mounted by Scottish clubs.
However, there are always lessons to be learned about the game away
from the action itself, and one which should be examined in depth by the
men who run our game is the manner in which France is currently going
about the business of launching the next World Cup.
The European Championship finalists have not yet been decided, and
that tournament reaches its climax in England next summer, but two years
further on France will host the l998 World Cup finals, and they are
promising to do so in some style.
This, of course, is what you learn to expect from the French in all
walks of life.
But where they are demonstrating something new in the organisational
build-up is in the choice of co-president of the World Cup Organising
Committee. For the first time, a former player has been handed the
responsibility for planning football's greatest show when it takes place
in two-and-a-half years' time.
Not just any former player, of course, because the French do like
their little bit of glamour, but, arguably, one of the finest
footballers that country has produced.
Michel Platini, that infinitely gifted midfield genius who starred in
the most glorious era of French international football 10 years ago, has
returned to centre stage.
He was the man who pulled the strings in the French side which reached
the World Cup semi-finals in Spain in 1982, when they won the European
Championship two years later, and when they again reached the last four
of the Jules Rimet Cup in Mexico, 1986.
Now Platini will attempt to give France the greatest World Cup ever
staged.
Last week in Paris at the offices of the organising committee, a
spokesman told me: ''We know that this is the first time that a former
footballer has been put into this kind of position, but we felt it
important to have someone in charge who could mobilise the entire nation
behind the tournament, and Michel Platini was that man.
''He still has an enormous following among the people. No-one is
bigger than he when Frenchmen talk about football. He is the symbol of
the game and we realised how important that could be to our whole
strategy.''
Platini, now 41, was capped on 72 occasions for his country and spent
a short but less successful spell as international team manager. Now he
takes on a role which may yet turn out to be the most important of his
glittering career.
He has admitted: ''I know the huge responsibility which this role
carries but I have a group of very able and talented administrators with
me on the committee, and I know that I can add insights which only a
player could provide. That will be part of the role.
''It will be important to me that I can make serious contributions and
prove that players, or former players, should always have a voice at
this level. I am aware that many people will be watching and that I am
representing the players in this position.''
His fellow president is his close friend Fernand Sastre, who was
president of the French Football Federation while Platini was captaining
the national side.
Sastre, a skilful administrator, pushed for Platini to be his partner
and now the two men head an organising committee which has six other
members, most of whom have spent their lives steeped in the sport.
France, of course, was where the World Cup was founded and the second
time the tournament was played in Europe it was held there in l938.
Fittingly, the last competition of this century also will be staged
across the Channel.
Thirty-two teams will take part, the highest number, and the
television audience is predicted to swell to an astonishing 35 billion .
. . four billion more than watched the last finals in the USA, and more
than double the 16-billion audience captured by the Barcelona Olympics.
The matches will be played at 10 centres, with a magnificent new
stadium now being constructed in the Parisian suburb of St Denis. Called
simply Le Grand Stadion, at the moment, it will be completed by the end
of l997 and will hold 80,000, all seated.
All other stadiums are being improved in the various centres and all
will eventually be all-seated, as FIFA requirements insist.
The draw for the qualifying rounds will be made in Paris on December
12, and the organisers have chosen the Louvre as the venue for the draw.
Platini will be heavily involved at all levels, and should that not
suggest to the SFA that some of our own players should be utilised more
often to add the knowledge that only they can provide?
I realise that the late Tommy Younger and Willie Harkness played at
top level as professionals and reached the presidency of the
association. However, they reached these heights because they were club
directors and were voted in.
Platini has been appointed to this role by a group of football
bureaucrats who recognise just how much he has to offer.
The people at Park Gardens should take note.

JAPAN
Tokyo
JAPANESE property prices are still dropping and analysts expect the
downward spiral will prod construction and real estate companies to sell
land holdings in an effort to tidy up their books.
If correct, investors can expect to see some big losses as a result of
the sales but most observers do not think they will be as bad as losses
detailed on Thursday by Haseko Corp, a major condominium constructor.
Land prices have fallen by about 60% from the peak they hit in the
early 1990s and many firms in the industry are still carrying their
holdings at full book value.
Haseko illustrated the effect land sales at current values can have on
real estate-heavy firms. It sold about half its holdings and said the
resulting losses meant it was likely to post a 185bn yen parent net loss
this business year.
Before the announcement its official forecast was for a 500m yen
parent net profit.
''We were surprised to hear the size of the losses,'' said an analyst
at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics.
''It's possible some other condominium construction firms may move to
post losses, but the amount is unlikely to be that much,'' he said.
Keiko Otsuki, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd, said the
construction ministry, worried about the slump, earlier this year
encouraged builders to improve their financial health.
That prodding might have encouraged Haseko to realise its book losses
and might now also give a spur to others in the industry to improve
their balance sheets, she said.
An analyst at Nikko Research Center welcomed Haseko's move but said
the slump in Japan's condominium market is expected to continue, putting
pressure on the firm's core business.
There has been no sign of commercial land prices hitting bottom in
Japan, analysts said.
Residential land prices, which have fallen about 40% from their peak,
are also expected to stay weak because the supply of condominiums has
been increasing since last year and is expected to stay high over the
coming years, they said.
* Japanese Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura emerged last night as
strong favourite to head a new liberal party planned through a merger of
his party with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's Socialists.
The daily Mainichi Shimbun reported that Murayama had told Takemura,
at a secret meeting a week ago, that he did not want to lead the new
party -- to be formed as early as next month.

TAXATION
BRITISH workers pay more in taxes from their earnings than fellow
workers in other European countries and American and Japanese workers in
the same wage brackets.
Workers in salary bands ranging from #8500 to #51,000 a year come out
third top of the high tax league-beaten in the high stakes by workers in
France, Italy, and Germany
Top of the league of workers taking home more cash in the wage packets
are American workers.
The survey, carried out by world-wide accountancy firm Arthur
Andersen, looked at the wages of workers in European countries and
America.
The European countries involved in the survey are Spain, Switzerland,
Italy, the UK and France.
Based on income tax and other deductions for someone earning a salary
of #17,000 the take home pay works out at:
America 88%; Japan 85%; Switzerland 84%; Spain 82%; France 77%; UK
74%; Italy 73%; and Germany 70%.
The figures are based on a the earnings of a 35-year-old married man
with two children aged six and ten.
Mr John Macintosh, tax partner at Arthur Andersen, who was involved in
carrying out the survey, called for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget.
''If the intention is to improve the position of the lower paid, one
way of doing this is to increase personal allowances. If the Chancellor
wants to help middle income families he should consider cuts in the
basic rate or raise the level at which the 40% income tax rate is
incurred,'' he said.

IN London on manoeuvres, the Diary had an opportunity to take in some
sporting excellence. Would it be Cantona and company at Stamford Bridge
or Bergkamp doing his stuff for Arsenal?
Eventually we plumbed for watching Scotland's best club rugby side in
action. Although London Scottish play in the English leagues, they are
Scottish to a man. Even Doug Signorini, the prop, is Aberdonian.
The bit about London Scottish being Scotland's best came from club
member Tony Matthews, who might be biased but argues that LS are holding
their own with the top teams in English rugby -- a feat which would be
beyond all but a handful of home-based clubs.
London Scottish are keeping pace in the English Division 2 with Ian
McGeechan's Northampton rugby machine. Both unbeaten, LS just one point
behind after Saturday's draw with Blackheath.
The London Scottish v Blackheath match is not just a league fixture
but the continuation of a tradition that goes back to 1881, when the
clubs first met. Blackheath Football Club is the epitome of Old English
rugger, even though it doesn't have rugby in its name. It was founded in
1858 and was one of the original members of the Football Association
before the distinction between the football and rugby codes was
formalised.
Blackheath refer to themselves simply as The Club. We are not saying
they are a snobbish lot but some, perhaps the chaps in the red-and-black
stripey blazers and the bloke with the yellow bow-tie, could fairly be
described as un poco pretencioso.
What can you expect from a place whose main street is called Tranquil
Vale and where there were complaints when, after a local pub was turned
into an upmarket Irish bar, as is the current fashion, some real Irish
people of the lower orders from nearby townships started to frequent it?
But we are not here to criticise the mores of Blackheath. We are here
to praise London Scottish. They appear to be a thriving club, putting
out 10 sides every week. Their under-16s are planning an ambitious tour
of South Africa.
If some of the accents are on the English side, there is no doubting
the Scottish pride on the field and in the clubhouse. Only players born
in Scotland or whose parents or grandparents are Scottish are allowed to
play in the first XV.
To keep up the standards requires a thorough process of ethnically
cleansing promising young players with the required tartan
qualifications away from their English clubs and back to their Scottish
rugby heritage.
Fulton Paterson, an Aberdonian stockbroker, is London Scottish vice
president and secretary of the Scottish Rugby Union's Exiles division.
He heads an organisation which continually trawls the lists of potential
star players to find Scottish blood, even twice removed.
A youngster called McCluskie, playing for Instonians in Northern
Ireland, was trailed only to be ruled out when it was discovered he
missed being sufficiently Scottish by one generation. Jack Charlton's
old test for Irish nationality -- that the football player in question
had once passed through Dublin airport -- does not apply.
London Scottish club thrive socially with some 1500 members. The first
three we met on the touchline at Blackheath's Rectory Field were puffing
away contentedly at Havana cigars, giving rise to suspicions that the
club might be a redoubt of the wealthy.
But it is a mixed club, with adherents from all walks of life, like
Jim Claridge, a retired Fleet Street print worker. He is not Scottish by
birth but more than qualifies by his service as a Lovat Scout in Greece
in the last war.
Jim has many London Scottish campaign medals, including a recent
international in Paris when a bunch of chaps in kilts were mischievously
taken to a gay bar. Jim and his colleagues fought a brave rear-guard
action despite many requests for a look at what was underneath the kilt.
But what about the rugby match? It was fast, furious, entertaining,
and just a bit bloody, as apparently the fixture often is. John Steele,
the London Scottish and England A international fly-half, suffered a
suspected broken jaw in an off-the-ball exchange of greetings.
For most of the match it was a try by London Scottish left wing Toby
Watson which separated the clubs. Blackheath equalised with a try and
conversion with two minutes to go.
It was a stiff test for London Scottish's resolve in the promotion
battle -- but nothing like the upcoming meeting with Northampton who
have played seven, won seven, and scored 351 points.

SYNCHRONISED swimming in Greenock? Dear God, in Greenock, in normal
circumstances, you could do that in the street. Bud Neill once portrayed
the town at the edge of the Firth of Clyde as being in a constant
downpour.
But if Greenock is wet through and so are swimmers, well, the
synchronised ones aren't. For a start they oil themselves and don
make-up and costumes and hairstyles which repel the wetness of water.
Frankly, swimming leaves me frozen: all that going up and down. But
oddly synchronised water babies give me a buzz.
For a start it is more of a sport than just thrashing your arms
quicker than some Aussie bint or bloke. It requires careful athleticism,
an astonishing discipline of limbs, and a craft and grace which would
pass for ice-dancing. There was a time when speed-skating was an Olympic
sport and ice-dancing wasn't.
That was a time when art was ill-considered for sport and a great
mistake it was. The demands made upon an ice dancer are immense. So,
too, in synchronised swimming. The physical demands on what are mostly
youngsters defy description.
Of course, the reason why this sport is so often decried is that the
girls -- and they are almost all girls -- get sort of glammed up, like
baton-twirlers (another demanding athletic activity), and sport smashing
hair-styles and water-proof make-up. Well so did Esther Williams, the
legendary water-sports film star of many a musical. But don't forget
that Esther was practically the Jesse Owens of Olympic water sport in
the 30s.
Talking of the Olympics, it was in 1984 that the sport found
recognition, though it had been a demonstration sport since the 1952
Games. (Ornamental swimming, however, dates from the 1800s).
Elizabeth Bowman, Scottish synchro convener, told me of how weel the
sport has been advancing in the past few years. In Edinburgh and in
Canada, the Scots did well in the Commonwealth Games. The last Olympics
were good, too. Next year Atlanta sees a strong team. Elizabeth, a
professional swimming teacher, says it should show how good the Scots
are.
There are definite talents in this demanding pastime. Bearing in mind
that the routines last only three-and-a-half minutes, also bear in mind
the astounding training for this. At the weekend there were five
countries taking part in this Scottish Open -- Scotland, England,
Belgium, Canada, and the United States.
From the large Trafford Club from Manchester, the two Howard girls,
Anne Marie and Joanne, showed well on Saturday, and I met once again
young Emma Inge, from the same club, whom I met two years back at
Drumchapel swimming baths, one of the few arenas for this sport because
of the depth of the pool.
If Emma was looking grown-up -- she is now 17 -- and just as charming
as she was these two years back, in some ways synchronised swimming has
not, and this is the fault of the swimming and indeed sports bodies.
The sport needs a depth which few pools have. Scotstoun, for instance,
recently opened, is splendid, but the depth is insufficient for synchro.
You need more than 12ft depth for the business of this. Sheffield has
it, and Drumchapel is close, but sadly the trend is for swimming pools
to develop into ''leisure'' pools, complete with bouncy castles and with
less facilities than they had even 20 years ago.
There is a lot of money to be made in ''leisure'' and not much in
minority sport. In fact, the likelihood is that Greenock's pool is
closing down some time next year, to be turned into ''leisure,'' a bit
like closing down the book section of a library and opening up a video
emporium.
I spoke to the Canadian squad of eight girls from Burlington, Toronto,
a well-known spot for Scottish exiles. Judge Mary Black, who we have met
before in almost every aqua sport but the wummin who introduced me some
years back to this sport, introduced me to splendid lasses.
Kim Beveridge, 15, said that the depth of the pool wasn't really
adequate but Scotland was. ''We've met really great people here, even
journalists like you.'' I am not sure how to take that.
Kate Ahrons, at 12 the youngest Canadian competitor, said even more.
''I'd really like to stay here awhile: the weather's been great and we
were told you were always wet.'' That was Saturday. Do you know what
yesterday was like in Greenock? Kate found out. It was the team events
then, with eight girls doing practically Busby Berkeley stuff.
On a wet Sunday in Greenock you are as well sticking together and
synchronising yersels.

A COUPLE have launched an appeal to raise #50,000 so that a Scots
surgeon can operate on their son.
Four-year-old Michael Moore -- the son of Ken and Judith Moore from
South Shields, Tyne-and-Wear -- suffers from cystic hygroma, a rare
condition which causes a facial tumour.
The couple have arranged a consultation with plastic surgeon Professor
Ian Jackson at London's Wellington Hospital next month. Prof Jackson --
who was based in Glasgow but now works in America -- is famed for his
work rebuilding the face of his adopted son David Lopez -- rescued from
a South American jungle suffering from a severe facial deformity.
Michael has already had four operations at Newcastle Royal Victoria
but could have to wait several years for surgery with the NHS.

ALFRED Kotey lost his WBO bantamweight title on Saturday night -- but
boxing was a winner at London's York Hall.
The sport badly needed to restore some self-respect after the death of
James Murray and spectator violence in Glasgow.
It did so with a cracking fight -- witnessed by an impeccably behaved
East End crowd -- in which underdog Daniel Jimenez survived a
third-round knock-down to take a unanimous points decision.
''A good night for boxing,'' said promoter Frank Warren at the end of
a week in which he shouldered much of the responsibility for arguing
against the abolitionists.
Warren, who on Wednesday will supplement new British Board of Control
safety measures with action of his own, was not so happy with the
performance of Kotey.
The Ghanaian, having his first fight for Warren, blew his claim for a
match with Britain's new WBO featherweight champion, Naseem Hamed.
When a wicked left hook to the body put Jimenez down for a count of
eight, Kotey looked a good bet to win convincingly. But the Puerto Rican
challenger weathered the storm impressively, counter-punching
effectively.
''Kotey did not do enough,'' said Warren. ''After the knock-down he
thought he could take the man out with one shot. It's back to the
drawing board. I know he is a far better fighter than he showed here.''

FRANCHISING is big business and in the UK annual sales have topped
#5bn. Almost 200,000 persons are employed in franchising and more than
400 franchisors support 26,000 outlets. Many have grown to become huge
concerns with franchises such as McDonald's having 525 restaurants in
the UK, Holiday Inn controlling 1700 hotels and the Body Shop with 1000
stores world-wide.
But not all franchises are in this league and the important thing to
remember before you contemplate becoming a franchisee is that it isn't a
short cut to riches, however, it can be a safer way of establishing your
own business. And with a well-constructed and sound franchise operation,
the chance of failure can be much less than it would be for someone
setting up in business on their own.
A franchise is the granting of a licence by a franchisor, who is the
creator or owner of the business format, to the investor who can then
sell the franchise's product or service. The franchisee gets a total
package with all the necessary elements to establish a business and run
it profitably.
Before buying into the franchise you must check the package offered to
ensure that it meets your requirements and once you are committed to the
partnership you will have to work hard for success.
Franchising's main attraction is that it uses a business expertise
that has proven success and is supported by a tried and tested trading
performance. In most cases the name under which you trade will be well
established throughout the country and will be extensively advertised by
the franchisor.
Training will be provided by the franchisor and you will be allotted
an area in which to trade. Generally there is no overlap between you and
other franchisees, however, there is a growing tendency to adopt the
''American system'' where franchisees are not held within a boundary.
The effect of this it is claimed increases competition and more
important, profits.
It has been estimated that of the many thousand businesses started in
Britain every year one-third will have ceased trading within three
years. Starting a business always presents an element of risk, and
factors such as rising interest rates or escalating raw material costs
may be outside your control but in turn are likely to considerably
affect your profit margins.
To get a head start in business the franchise concept may be the
answer for you. As a franchisee you will operate in a business area with
a proven track record which is likely to give you a reasonable return on
your investment.
It is understandable that because of the notoriously high failure rate
among new businesses that financial support from the banks might be
difficult to obtain.
However, banks view franchise situations differently. There is in
place a proven track record, start-up costs tend to be lower and
projections of how well you are expected to do are based on reality and
experience. Nevertheless it is still important to have a clear picture
of exactly what costs will have to be met by you to get your business
off the ground and up and running.
Capital outlays will vary but may be as little as #10,000 or as much
as #500,000, an average figure is probably between #50,000 and #75,000
but there are other costs that must be taken into account.
The initial franchise fee is a one-off fee to ''buy-in'' to the
business. It helps reimburse the franchisor's costs in developing the
operation and in some instances helping you find premises. The fee may
amount to between 5% and 10% of the total investment cost although where
the franchise investment is low this percentage may be higher.
Training fees are often included in the franchise fee but they seldom
include the cost of hotel accommodation or meals. It is not unusual for
a training course to run for four weeks.
There may be an advance rent to pay on the premises if the franchisor
has taken the head lease and grants you a sub-lease. Premises will have
to be fitted out to a standard format and often by a contractor who has
an agreement with the franchisor. You will be expected to bear the cost
of this.
If a vehicle is required in the business it may be a choice of the
franchisee to purchase this vehicle outright but it may also be leased
or bought through a hire-purchase agreement.
Initial and following supplies of stock are generally expected to be
purchased from the franchisor although necessary equipment is often
hired or leased. You will also have to take into account cash required
to cover initial costs such as wages and expenses, and the costs
connected with promoting your company in the local press and advertising
mail shots.
Entering into a franchise agreement may well be one of the most
important decisions you take in your life and it is vitally important
that you do your homework on the company that appeals to you.
If you take up a franchise you will be going into a business
relationship with a partner -- the franchisor. All businesses, including
franchising, involve risk and statistics show that going into business
as a franchisee of a well-established franchise will give you an
excellent start.
Do you have what it takes?
Look closely at yourself and consider whether you have the attributes
necessary to run your own business.
Are you a self-starter?
Can you lead and motivate others?
How do you get on with other people?
How good an organiser are you?
Are you a conscientious worker?
Can you take responsibility?
Can you make decisions?
Are you determined to succeed?
Do you enjoy good health?
Do you have the support of your family?
As a franchisee you will operate in a business area with a proven
track record which is likely to give you a reasonable return on your
investment

BRIAN WILSON gives a personal view regarding the Scottish Secretary's
crofting
land proposals -- and issues a challenge
THE caption to the front-page picture in Saturday's Herald, of Michael
Forsyth meeting the Assynt Crofters Trust, described that admirable
venture as the ''role model'' for his proposals involving crofting land.
That would indeed be something to celebrate. The two distinguishing
features of Assynt were that it took land out of private, and into
common, ownership and that it included all the estate assets, including
sporting and mineral rights.
If Forsyth intends to promote these ends, he need not delay since the
necessary legislation would go through Parliament by acclaim, as far as
the Opposition is concerned. But don't hold your breath.
This looks more like another case of Forsyth making populist noises on
an emotive, but complex, subject. Throw in words like ''new . . . bold .
. . challenging'' and the outcome is a froth of over-excited approval.
There is absolutely nothing ''new'' about his only specific proposal
-- the sale of the Scottish Office's crofting estates. This has been
tried twice since 1979 and was beaten back by resistance from those most
affected -- the crofting tenants.
The first principle must again be that any change can only go ahead
with their consent. If, as part of a wider initiative, there is majority
support in any part of the Scottish Office's estates for community
ownership, then of course that is the outcome which should prevail. But
that is a big ''if''.
In the early eighties, the Scottish Office planned to sell all its
agricultural holdings including the crofting ones. They succeeded in the
rest of Scotland but ran into public opinion in the Highlands where it
is well remembered that the state only became landlords after heroic
struggles to wrest crofting lands from private ownership.
A decade later, another bid to sell these lands was specifically
linked to the alternative of community trusts. Again the response was
hostile with one veteran crofters' champion, Margaret MacPherson of
Skye, summing up: ''Not one acre or half-acre is being given back to the
people -- only the administration.''
It is absurd to pretend that transferring the best-managed crofting
estates is, to any degree, addressing the historic wrongs of Highland
land ownership. Anyone with half a wit should challenge Forsyth on the
difficult questions before granting him credit for recycling a
twice-rejected idea.
The true measure lies in whether he will lift a finger to transfer
crofting land out of the vagaries of private (and usually absentee)
hands and into community ownership, where such a demand exists.
Fortunately, there is a modest test available for him to sit. A Court
of Session judgment, which surprised many and delighted some, upheld the
right of crofters to acquire ownership on an individual basis under the
1976 Crofters Act and then transfer it to a third party (like a
community trust) in order to achieve the outcome of community ownership.
The Scottish Landowners Federation threatened to take this Kinlochewe
Judgment to the House of Lords. They then decided not to risk that
strategy in case the ruling was confirmed and reinforced. Instead, they
let sleeping dogs lie, hoping that the precedent will not be adopted
until the law can be ''clarified'' in their favour.
If Forsyth aspires to anything more than the dubious aim of getting
rid of the publicly-owned crofting estates at the third attempt, he
should come out clearly behind the Kinlochewe Judgment and commit
backing to any community which takes advantage of it. I challenge him to
do so.
This would create only a limited advance since sporting and mineral
rights -- often the most valuable assets of crofting estates -- would
still reside with the former landlords. If Forsyth believes that private
owners will give these up voluntarily, then he may also believe in Santa
Claus.
So is Assynt a role model -- an estate which was formerly under
neglectful, absentee ownership and has now, under very particular
circumstances, been transferred lock, stock, mineral, and sporting
rights to the people who live on it? Or is this just the third attempt
to flog off the Scottish Office's crofting estates?
There is a vast gulf between these two concepts and I doubt if
Forsyth's much-vaunted, but little-substantiated, ''flexibility'' will
begin to bridge it. It is, however, entirely within his power to prove
me wrong.

A FAIRLY quiet week for company results nevertheless still sees two
major companies reporting, SmithKline Beecham on Wednesday and ICI on
Thursday.
Analysts are looking for third quarter profits of around #313m from
SmithKline, up from #285m last year, though earnings per share are
likely to be static.
It will be the final quarter bearing the full impact of the ending of
the Tagamet ulcer drug patent and analysts will be more interested to
know how sales of the non-prescription version for excess stomach acid
are going in the US. It is competing head-to-head with a similar
product, Pepcid.
It is reckoned it has taken about a fifth of the market but only after
heavy advertising spending.
There will also be interest in SmithKline's acquisition plans given
the takeover action sweeping the pharmaceuticals industry and on how the
recent purchases, Sterling Health, and Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services, are bedding down. It is also hoped the group will give more
information on how it will reduce its gearing, which rose to 120% after
the acquisitions.
Another strong seller in SmithKline's portfolio is Seroxat, an
anti-depressant which some believe could become the group's biggest
seller in coming years. Its use is being extended to treat panic and
obsessive compulsive disorders, a market expected to be worth #500m in a
few years.
ICI reports its third quarter figures on Thursday and a strong rise in
profits is expected, from #143m to around #240m, even though prices are
falling again on the bulk chemicals side. Analysts will be hoping for
reassurance that this weakness will soon come to an end.
The group will be spared lower prices in PVC and polypropylene as it
sold off these businesses. On the other hand prices are still firming
for other products such as titanium dioxide and cost savings will still
be coming through.
Another blue chip with results on Wednesday is Smiths Industries which
is set to perform well in its full year, with analysts looking for #136m
against #117m and a 10% dividend hike. Broker Panmure Gordon reckons the
group is the best managed in the engineering sector and the shares have
been good performers since the interims.
Wolseley is at the sharp end of the construction recession in the UK
but overseas interests and cost savings are likely to spur a further
improvement in profits, possibly to #245m against #202m for the year to
July.
A good dividend rise is anticipated. Full year profits will be helped
by acquisitions and margin improvement though its markets in the US as
well as the UK are looking soft, with a slowdown in US new housing
starts.
Among Scottish companies, Scottish Metropolitan's full year figures
come out on Tuesday and profits should be comfortably ahead, supporting
an increased final dividend. Analysts will be interested to know how it
sees the property market progressing and how the group's developments
are going.

HOLDERS Prestwick strengthened their grip on the CIS Insurance
National Indoor Bowls League when they travelled to Bainfield on
Saturday and returned with an 81-66 win over last year's runners-up.
Prestwick finished ahead on three of the four rinks with the decisive
result being Edric Vorsterman's 33-15 victory over Alan Brown. Garry
Hood and David Gourlay added single-shot wins over the Marshall
brothers, Robert and Alex, with Bainfield's consolation win coming from
Alex Ross, who beat international skip Robert McCulloch 20-15.
That win gave Prestwick a two-point lead at the top of Section B ahead
of Auchinleck, who crushed Stirling 128-64. Lanarkshire retained third
place thanks to a comprehensive 95-48 win over Edinburgh in which they
finished ahead on all four rinks.
In Section A, West Lothian went top of the table after their 90-63
home win over Nithsdale. Previous leaders Cumbernauld went down 73-61 at
Aberdeen, with the Granite City side moving into second place, a point
behind West Lothian with a game in hand.
In Division Two, Elgin remain top of Section A after a 101-75 home win
over Dyce. East Fife stayed out in front in Section B following their
111-57 victory over Forfar, while in Section C, the two principals, East
Kilbride and Blantyre, fought out a 78-78 draw to leave East Kilbride in
front on shots aggregate.
Allander took over top spot in Section D after a 97-53 win over
Fintry, and Paisley went two points clear in Section E when they
returned from Lochwinnoch with an 83-63 win. Details:
Division One, Section A -- Dundee 90, Ayr 66 (I Hunter 28, R Hall 21;
R Biondi 21, D Irvine 14; J Brodie 19, T Campbell 19; L Topen 22, M
Baillie 12); West Lothian 90, Nithsdale 63 (G Sneddon 17, B Haining 18;
R Sutherland 25, D Adamson 15; G Knox 19, B Conchar 16; I Brown 29, M
Motroni 14); Turriff 99, Irvine 64 (A Campbell 31, H Foster 11; W Beaton
25, P Foster 19; M Stephen 24, A Adrain 18; M Thurston 19, G Thomas 16);

RONNIE Black in his call (October 14) for a Celtic revival in Scotland
suggested that Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh is named after the legendary
King Arthur.
My understanding, however, is that Arthur's Seat is merely a
corruption of the Gaelic Ard-na-said, meaning ''height of the arrows''.

AS expected, Kingussie lead the new national premier league at the
halfway stage. The Badenoch club's three-point advantage over second
place Fort William was confirmed with a comfortable 6-2 away win at
Glenurquhart.
The Glen had rallied briefly in the first half in the face of an early
onslaught and Peter MacDonald netted from the spot before Jamie
MacPherson scored a second.
Ronald Ross, last season's top scorer, was again the difference
between the teams. He netted four more to bring his tally to 24 in seven
league matches and the international against Ireland.
Glasgow Mid Argyll have strung three wins together and are now in
third place. They should have buried Oban Camanachd's challenge after
half-time at Govan when they were leading 3-0.
But Camanachd, who had Ally MacInnes sent off, fought back and almost
stole a point before going under 3-2. The two goals Mid Argyll's Kevin
Thain scored were, however, crucial at the end of a game which featured
five bookings.
Fort William celebrated their 2-1 win against Newtonmore with a new
sponsorship deal with the Crannog sea-food restaurant chain. The
three-year deal is worth up to #15,000 to the team, who appeared in
their new strips for the first time at the weekend.
Inveraray's faltering form continued with a 1-1 draw at Oban, where
Celtic picked up their second point of the season. Garry MacPherson put
Inveraray ahead, but Gregor McCormick pulled one back before half-time.

KERRY Martin, who had to withdraw from the Scottish team this summer
because of injury, returned to form to set the only district record at
the weekend's West Open Swimming Championships at Cumbernauld.
The former Scottish junior gymnastics internationalist, who is now on
a swimming scholarship at Stirling University, lowered her own mark to
29.28sec in the heat, and then went to 29.26 in the final of the 50m
butterfly.
Alison Sheppard produced the perfect send-off before leaving for six
weeks' training in Calgary on Saturday by collecting four gold medals.
The 22-year-old from Milngavie and Bearsden, who will be bidding for a
third successive Olympic Games in Atlanta next summer, struck gold in
the 50m and 200m free-style, the 50m back-stroke, and the 100m
free-style, in which her time of 56.96sec secured the Swim of the Meet
award.
Richard Hope (Warrender) also picked up a quartet of titles, winning
both back-stroke events and the 200m and 400m free-style.
Forbes Dunlop (Milngavie and Bearsden) and Ben Harkin (Clackmannan)
both completed title hat tricks, while Tom Griffiths, who heads for the
Australian Institute of Sport at the start of next month, won two golds.
Two juniors to make their mark were Cumbernauld's Susan Kent, who won
the 100m breast-stroke in 1-16.42, and Carnegie's Lynn McLaren- who
completed a double in the 200m medley and 50m breast-stroke.

When Gore Vidal holds court his loyal readers flock to pay homage --
but private audiences remain anathema
A PEN in one hand, the world in the other, Gore Vidal pads on cat's
feet towards his authorial throne. Once seated he crosses his legs
neatly at the ankles. His black suede shoes, delicately medallioned in
pewter across the uppers, are so like the slippers of a doge they must
surely be Italian. He is larger, chunkier than we imagine, the broad
shoulders and bulky torso an indication of his Oklahoma stock.
The face, too, is fuller now, still with the patina of that all-year
tan acquired in California and kept in good fettle by Italy's Amalfi
Coast. Except for a cluster of vertical creases below each cheekbone,
the skin is almost cosmetically smooth. There is nothing of the writer's
distracted air about him. In impeccable grey worsted, Gore Vidal appears
successful in the way that international financiers appear successful --
big, poised, languid, distant, ruthless as a razor when it counts.
At 70 America's rogue sage has happily been intimating that he is
nearing the road's end of his literary career. We take such disclosures
to be a whim, a playful aside, for retiring is the last thing he will
do. Despite his declared paganism, Vidal cleaves to the puritan ethic
where work is concerned, researching his subjects with the pernickety
detail of a scholar. And anyway, across two continents he remains our
only show-biz intellectual, a sort of one-man Greek chorus attending
global events to forecast our careless self-destruction.
But this role of universal elder has taken a new twist in recent
years, giving him a late vocation as a movie actor. So, to novelist,
essayist, critic and screenwriter, Vidal can now add character player,
and it may be that this has been the job he's secretly cultivated all
his life.
In the past half-dozen years, however, a curious thing has happened.
The more familiar he has become on screen, TV and radio, the less
inclined he has been to give print interviews. This shunning has now
turned into an all-out ban and it is a strange response for someone who
has lived so richly from caustically writing about others; the peevish
censorship of a much-celebrated liberal.
Yet is it such a surprise? One part of Vidal has always banked up
great contempt for journalism. This is the man who has repeatedly
declared that the press exists -- wherever it throws its hat -- to
''exploit and anticipate the worst prejudices in its readers''. Today,
if we are to be critical we might say that Gore Vidal is too clever in
the long run for his own lasting satisfaction; too articulate to create
effective screenplays; too intelligent to be a successful politician;
too wordy for an accomplished novelist. But not too articulate for
essays. This, and book reviewing, are where his own particular of
scalpel journalism excels.
He is supremely skilled in predicting fashionable causes, revelling in
narcissism and witty unrepentant malice. As a result he has always
gathered enemies and friends with equal relish and not infrequently they
are one and the same. But then Vidal has always believed that other
people's opinions of him are really other people's problems. At this
moment, however, his amiable and enduring companion, Howard Austen,
insists that the ironic invigilator is in benign and sparkling form.
Indeed, why should he be otherwise for here he is, writer in
lunch-hour residence at Hatchard's, London booksellers since 1797, and
his loyalists are streaming in, full-spate, from Piccadilly, then taking
up a waiting position on the staircase. Each carries at least one copy
of Palimpsest, the memoir he promised never to write.
Directly above his chair there is a portrait of Her Majesty in the
tiara-ed and gartered rig of state occasions. As Vidal makes himself
comfortable in the authorial seat two security men adjust the table
around him. With that overhead royal icon and respectful subjects at his
elbow, he could be the governor-general in some forgotten corner of
empire, applying a skidding signature to edicts. A peculiar little
vignette to star in for an avowed Democratic republican.
Even more unexpected is the vision of Denis Thatcher doing a round of
messages. In his brown trilby he is returning one of two identical books
given as seventieth-birthday presents to his wife the other day. Lord
Thatcher hands back the biography of Julius Caesar, not the most tactful
of gifts considering that emperor's messy end. He moseys round the
bookshelves, oblivious of the dignified procession to Palimpsest's
shrine.
The queue now seems endless, composed of dog-eared literary types,
Drabble and Amis lookalikes, City gents and aristos, American ex-pats,
students and a strong quota of the multi-racial faces which make up any
London rush-hour. Howard hangs around on the periphery, keeping an old,
attentive eye on his old, irreverent companion. We make Howard our pal.
Will Gore Vidal, just for a few minutes, break this pattern of his
latter days and talk to a print journalist? ''Well, I dunno,'' says
Howard. ''He's pretty tired; can't wait to get to our place in Ravello
because it's coming up to the olive harvest. On our farm we major in
olives, lemons and chestnuts. Gore loves all that . . . carting the
olives to town where they're still hand-pressed in the ancient way.''
Howard says it's nice to know that people can remember how to do these
things according to tradition. ''Gore calls it his Ravello fix.''
Decades of Los Angeles living have done nothing to tenderise the chewy
Bronx drawl of Howard's childhood in New York. Over the same decades he
has been Vidal's most steadfast significant other, yet not his one true
love.
There have been many men and women in the intimate life of Gore Vidal
and Palimpsest seethes with sexual indiscretions eloquently expressed.
But love has always been a tricky matter for Vidal. ''Since I don't
really know what other people mean by love, I avoid the word,'' he
writes.
Yet through the memoir one name appears as the threnody to love:
Jimmie Trimble, the outgoing athletic blond Apollo whom Vidal first met
when they were teenagers and whom the introspective, solitary Gore came
to regard as his secret twin. ''What I was not, he was, and the other
way around.'' Trimble was killed, serving at Iwo Jima in 1945. He was
barely 20 years old.
After such long avoidance of the project why did Vidal write the
memoir? To examine, not his conscience, but his accumulation in the
world? His explanation comes early. ''I used to say, proudly, that I
would never write a memoir since 'I am my own subject'. Now I'm not so
sure. After all, one's recollected life is just about all that's left at
the end of the day when the work is done and gone, property now of
others.''
Palimpsest -- the word means a parchment on which the original writing
has been rubbed out -- steps in and out of his first 39 years and more
recent ones to end where, he says, his life really began -- with Jimmie:
''I have just bought two small plots for Howard and me in Rock Creek
Cemetery; we will be buried midway between Jimmie Trimble and Henry
Adams (the great American historian) -- midway between heart and mind to
put it grandly.''
So, what he has written, in fact, is not the ghost story he feared but
a cranky, self-regarding love tale, in some astonishment at itself,
''with us whole at last in the shade of a copper beech''.
And Howard? Patient Howard would not have it otherwise, we feel, for
among his strongest principles must be: Never bother a writer at work.
''It's a funny thing how Gore's movie career has taken off so late in
life,'' he muses. ''The kids making films today adore him, and that's
what keeps him much of the time in LA. He loves the team effort of
movies. When the phone rings with a screen role -- nothing very big,
sometimes nothing very good -- all the aches and pains of old age fall
away and Gore becomes rejuvenated. It's like an escape from the
loneliness of writing.''
As for him, Howard has always been philosophical about ''just tagging
along''. He and Vidal met in the fifties when he was still Howard
Auster, working in a drug store to put himself through New York
University. Later, when he tried to get a job in advertising, the door
of anti-semitism slammed against him. Take the r off the end of your
surname and add an n, Vidal advised him. Howard did, and immediately he
was hired by a copy-writing agency. He has valued the worth of Vidal's
cynicism ever since.
By now the Hatchard's queue has thinned to a few chatty stragglers.
One woman is anxious to know what he really thought of the libidinous
diarist, Anais Nin: ''You must read the book,'' he gracefully directs.
She will not be disappointed, for here is vintage venom from a
litterateur born of the governing classes, gazing down on Nin's lost and
preening world with pitying hilarity.
But Vidal, author of 22 novels, Burr, Myra Breckinridge, Duluth and
Lincoln among them, has never lacked an audience despite his refusal to
pump gas into the American ego, and, interestingly, his candid stand on
bisexuality has never done him any public harm. Detecting the whiff of
formaldehyde is his speciality. That, and a certain reflective
meglomania: ''I would have loved to have been President of the United
States,'' he once told me, and when asked which he would have preferred
to have done -- write War and Peace or rule America -- he thought for a
minute and with a wicked curl of the lip replied: ''In my case I don't
think one rules out the other. I see myself having done both.''
Howard says that deep down Vidal is shy. ''Oh, he can talk well and be
the centre of every party -- I mean who is there who is wittier? But
he's not really a social animal.'' In Ravello, where the writing room in
his pale, enchanting house looks across the Gulf of Salerno, the man who
seems to have made a point of knowing everyone with clout may exist amid
the cliff top's diaphanous peace, not seeing any visitors for months.
''We enjoy that,'' says Howard.
''Pottering around, obeying the old rhythms of the place . . . Italy
may be a mess right now but, yeah, Ravello is home.'' And Los Angeles,
that toytown of cosmetic lifts? After all these years and monstrous
disasters, its surreal hedonism still appeals.
In the bookshop the Palimpsest pilgrims have returned to base. Howard
slips into the street for a cigarette; I edge forward to pitch for luck.
Vidal knows what's coming, and the muscle in his right cheek quivers
ever so slightly. ''You know my rule now,'' he says courteously, but he
will at least listen to a couple of questions. Intellect, he had said in
our last conversation, was an unfavourable commodity today. Feeling was
the thing, and he abhorred that, much preferring an atmosphere of chill
mental clarity. ''A pretty good answer,'' he says now. ''I have nothing
to add to it.''
Well, what about next year's fight for the White House, the moralists'
great battle between right and centre right? Surely he cannot wait to
get back into the fray? His reply signals either despair or irritation:
''I really have nothing more to say about the American political
scene.'' Yet that no sooner said, he allows himself a thread of hope,
adding: ''I shall enjoy stirring things up, certainly. But then I always
do.''
At which point Gore Vidal rises from the authorial throne, to take a
droll stroll into the big, enigmatic ending. He is still the best pop
Socrates the New World has produced. And as he turns, he winks.

PACIFIC GRAND PRIX
FOUR years after his stunning entry into Formula One racing Michael
Schumacher, in winning his second world drivers' championship yesterday
in Japan, joined the elite of his sport.
By winning the Pacific Grand Prix the 26-year-old German secured his
second successive title, but for Schumacher the biggest challenge is not
to overhaul the drivers who have won the title more often but to surpass
Alain Prost's all-time record of 51 grand-prix victories.
Schumacher said: ''I like to win races, and the championships will
come with them. To be honest, I am more interested in Prost's record
than in the number of championships.''
For Schumacher, whose simple approach to life has been one of his
greatest strengths, the next race is always the most important. ''I
never set targets or make too many plans,'' he said. ''I like to race
and to live by my instincts. It has worked for me so far.''
Asked recently which country and century he would belong to by choice,
he offered an unexpected reply when he said: ''Scotland in the
fourteenth century. I adore movies like Highlander and Braveheart.
''The landscape looks beautiful -- so bleak and stark. Scotland must
have been at its best 'way back in history before there were any cars
around to ruin the tranquility.''
For a man who has just won his second world title as the world's
fastest driver, it was the most unlikely answer. Yet it was evidence of
the new, maturing Schumacher.
In his career he has moved from one success to another through the
German and world karting championships, Formula Konig, Formula Ford,
Formula Three, and the world sportscar championship with Mercedes-Benz
on his way to the top. As he progressed, he developed extraordinary
mental and physical fitness levels.
Heinz-Harald Frentzen, a team-mate in the Mercedes junior team in
1990, recalled one illuminating incident. ''Michael and I went for a
fitness test together in Austria and he was driving on snow-covered
roads. He drove very fast and when we arrived at the clinic and had our
pulses taken, mine was about 120 or something and they asked me if I was
all right. I said I was just a little over-excited . . . but Michael's
was only normal, about 60 or 70 or something. It was absolutely
unbelievable.''
Schumacher was a close friend of Frentzen at that time, but the pair
fell out after Frentzen's then girlfriend, Corinna Besch, left him and,
after a short period, switched allegiance to Schumacher. She is now his
wife.
It was not until the fiftieth of the 83 laps yesterday that Schumacher
took the lead for the first and only time. He rightly thanked the
superior team-work of his Benetton camp, never more evident than when he
went into the pits just behind Hill and Jean Alesi in fourth place, but
exited ahead of them.
Those several lost seconds cost Hill any chance of victory as he
emerged into traffic. While Hill floundered, Schumacher chased David
Coulthard, patiently waiting for the Scot to pit for the second time to
inherit the lead and quickly open up an advantage that lasted despite
another stop for fresh fuel and rubber.
Coulthard said: ''After opening up a big gap I decided to go for two
stops rather than three. I thought that would be enough to win the race.
But after his last stop Michael was able to come out just in front of me
and by then, on old tyres, there was no chance to catch him.''
The Scot tried but got stuck in traffic and was nearly 15 seconds
adrift at the finish, with Hill another 33 seconds away, and now only 10
points ahead of his team-mate with two races left. The battle for second
spot will be close.
Later, Hill was incensed after Schumacher complained about his
driving, particularly an incident on lap 11, when he got alongside Hill,
who then held his racing line going into the corner. ''I do not see how
he can possibly object to anything I did considering what has passed
between us this season,'' fumed Hill.
His outburst will be seen as sour grapes by some, especially after it
came just a day after he was accused of being ''the biggest whinger in
Formula One'' by the sport's medical adviser, Professor Syd Watkins.
Eddie Irvine, bound for Ferrari as Schumacher's new partner, was also
none too happy with Hill's driving. ''Damon tried a bad overtaking
manoeuvre and punted me in the air. Thankfully, he did not do any
damage.'' How they finished:
1, M Schumacher (Germany), Benetton, 1hr 48min 49.972sec (average
speed 105.291mph); 2, D Coulthard (GB), Williams, at 14.920sec; 3, D

COLIN McRae will take no chances in Spain this week as he continues in
his quest to land the World Rally Championship in front of home fans.
The Scot is in second place -- seven points behind Juha Kankkunen --
going into the Catalunya Rally, the penultimate race of the series.
McRae and co-driver Derek Ringer will be making their debut in
Catalunya, but McRae is confident of being in contention come the
championship's final round, Britain's Network Q RAC Rally, which he won
last year.
''I drove the course opening car on last year's rally and did a lot of
testing out in Spain earlier this month,'' said McRae. ''My plan is to
drive steadily, keep Juha in my sights, and make sure that when we get
to the RAC Rally, I'm in with a real chance of taking the world
championship for Britain.''
The three-day Catalunya Rally, which begins in Lloret del Mar today,
covers 1039 miles entirely on asphalt roads, and incorporates 23
high-speed special stages, spanning 297 miles.
* ALISTER McRae looks set to drive a Ford Escort Cosworth in next
month's RAC Rally. The British champion had been expected to drive a
Formula 2 Nissan Sunny after having won the Mobil 1/Top Gear British
championship for the Nissan team.
''The Escort will be works-specification and run by a UK-based
independent Ford team and we are 90% towards finalising sponsorship,''
said McRae.
His father, Jimmy, also was confirmed as a leading contender in the
RAC event, driving a Porsche 911.

DAMON Hill continued to persevere but Michael Schumacher finally
secured his second successive Formula 1 world championship with another
superb drive, this time in the Pacific Grand Prix, and then promised
that with the prize his he would be able to relax and show the world
more of his astonishing powers in the remaining two races, at Suzuka and
Adelaide.
The German should make the most of the last two rides in his Benetton
Renault, because the future might not be so slick. His mercurial
progress could be slowed by his decision to change into the bright red
livery of Ferrari.
There is no need to see Schumacher collect the championship to know he
is the best driver in the world right now, but the change of machine
will reduce the gap between him those who would be champion. His
defection to the Italian stable for a pay packet which will be larger
than the cumulative salaries of the rest of the drivers should make for
a more interesting championship series next time and also present him
with a greater test of his driving abilities.
Schumacher won his second world crown in a car which was superior to
everything else apart, perhaps, from the Williams Renault, and his
exceptional abilities, which include a strength of mind and body
unmatched in any other racing suit and helmet, drove him to his eighth
win of the season and the eighteenth of his career. Thus, only four
years after his stunning entry into the high octane world of Formula 1
the 26-year-old has stepped into the pantheon of double world champions.
His name can now be listed along with those of Italy's Alberto Ascari
and Graham Hill, father of Schumacher's closest and bitter rival, Damon,
Scot Jim Clark, and Brazil's Emerson Fittipaldi. Ahead of Schumacher are
the marks of Argentina's Juan-Manuel Fangio, who won five world titles,
Alain Prost, the Frenchman who won four times, and five other drivers
who each took the championship three times.
That gathering of greats includes the Australian, Jack Brabham,
another Scot, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, of Austria, and the
Brazilians, Nelson Piquet and the wonderfully gifted Ayrton Senna.
However, Schumacher has as his target Prost's record of 51 race wins,
believing that if he gets close then further world titles will come
also. He has time on his side to threaten Prost's mark, but if he had
been staying with Benetton perhaps his chances would have been stronger,
because Flavio Briatore's team appear to have no equals on the curcuits.
Schumacher won the title last season in a Benetton, but one powered by
a Ford engine, and this time he has been successful in a car with a
Renault engine, which suggests the design and strategists within his
current team are the best. However, Ferrari do not commit themselves to
anything unless they are sure of success and with the champion in one of
their cars, they believe the combination will be the become the best.
They are paying the best driver more than #25m to lead their assault
on the constructors' championship as well as the drivers' one, but they
will have to provide him with everything Benetton were able to give and
it remains to be seen whether or not they will be able to deliver. Next
season will be the one in which Hill, who believes himself to be a
champion in waiting, must make his move. If he has championship-winning
talent, then he must show it.
Hill is staying with Williams, where he will be backed by the
newcomer, Jacques Villeneuve, and the Englishman must feel it is in his
favour that Schumacher has gone from Benetton. Williams, however, might
not be quite so sure about the driver they decided to keep while
allowing David Coulthard to go.
The 24-year-old Scot has been the faster of the two Williams drivers
ever since news of the team changes was announced, and again yesterday
Coulthard was easily the better driver. He knows he could have
threatened Schumacher's supremacy had he stayed with Williams, but poor
form midway through the season and politics eased him out of the
Didcot-based concern.
Often it is the machinations of the main movers behind the scenes who
make or break careers in Formula 1 and it has been rumoured that, with
Renault putting so much into the sport with their backing of Benetton
and Williams, a French-speaking driver had to be delivered. Enter
Villeneuve from the world of IndyCar racing in America. His presence
also will help keep the Canadians happy, because they often feel
detached from the scene.
It is thought that Williams believe they may have removed the wrong
driver from their team, but Coulthard is committed now to McLaren,
although he could have gone to Ferrari. Indeed, he was the choice of
Schumacher, but as Coulthard said in these columns last week, that would
have been his ''quickest route out of Formula 1.''
By going to McLaren the Scottish driver will be given joint No.1
status along with Mika Hakkinen, but there is no doubt the McLaren
leaders consider Coulthard to be their best hope. Ferrari have won the
constructors' championship eight times and Williams and McLaren have
each taken that coveted award seven times, while Benetton seem certain
to collect what will be their first title at the end of this season.
Coulthard believes he can help make McLaren the top team again,
because among his abilities is a penchant for test driving cars and then
communicating relevant pieces of information to the back-up team, and
McLaren, backed by the power of Mercedes, believe Coulthard will be the
catalyst which transforms their fortunes of the last four years.
They have been searching for the correct combination since 1991, when
Senna earned the drivers' title and also the constructors' version, and
Coulthard is prepared to sacrifice next season to experimentation with a
view to making a serious move the following season.
It will, then, be an intriguing series of races next season, which is
scheduled to start in Melbourne in March, and while Schumacher will
improve Ferrari's prospects, he knows he will be challenged by one or
two others like never before. The main threat will come from Hill, while
Coulthard and McLaren attempt to find the secret, but if Schumacher wins
the title for a third successive time then his place among the greats
would be assured.

Southampton 1, Liverpool 3
MATTHEW Le Tissier was sent off for only the second time in his league
career yesterday as Steve McManaman plunged Southampton deeper into
trouble with two goals at The Dell.
Le Tissier, who had already collected his fifth booking of the season
for a foul on Ian Rush, slid in clumsily on defender Phil Babb after 68
minutes.
John Barnes led the mercy pleas from Liverpool and home players, but
referee Dermot Gallagher showed none as he flourished the yellow card
again, followed by the red.
The 27-year-old Southampton captain was cheered to the dressing room
by the home fans, but by the time he departed his side were already
beaten, having surrendered the early lead he created as McManaman showed
the kind of skill England tried unsuccessfully to harness in Norway
earlier this month.
Roaming at will, he scored twice and then made the third for partner
Jamie Redknapp after 73 minutes which plunged Southampton, watched by
new #850,000 signing Barry Venison, to their sixth defeat in 10 games
this season and stretched Venison's old club's unbeaten run to 10 games
since September 9.
Southampton could not have had a better start, opening the scoring
after just two minutes. Gordon Watson claimed the goal, but TV replays
suggested Le Tissier's curler from the left might have sailed in
untouched as the little striker stooped low at the near post.
But slowly Redknapp and McManaman took control and the latter
equalised after 22 minutes, then put the visitors ahead in the
fifty-fourth minute when keeper Beasant failed to hold a McAteer shot.

WITH few boats been able to dominate their class consistently, it will
take next week's final races at Largs' Nardini's Series and at
Inverkip's Bombay Gin Autumn Series to decide the outcome of many of the
divisions.
Still in possession of the perfect scorecard -- three wins from three
races -- are Ayrshire's Macleman brothers, Robert and David, in their
big Bolero Highwayman.
Yesterday, they shielded their unbeaten record with a margin of just
23 seconds over local Largs favourite, Pater Carrick, in Pure Magic.
Also unbeaten are Sigma 33 champions Hilary and John Connelly, who,
sailing Phoenix, were well clear of Gavin Watson's Rupert at the top end
of the first leg. However, as the wind died from a north-easterly of 12
knots to a veritable whisper, Watson recovered and was just three
boat-lengths behind at the finish.
Three wins should give Phoenix overall honours.
At Inverkip, John Corson's run of two successive victories in his J35
Salamander XII was brought to a halt by Geoffrey Howison's BHB41, which
joined the series after missing the first two outings.
Showing great pace, Howison's crew were five minutes clear of Corson
on corrected time. After winning a race each, Howard Morrison yesterday
drew clear of second-placed John Kelly. Kelly now needs to win next week
to retain any chance of taking Class 2 overall.

GREENOCK Glenpark Harriers celebrated the start of their centenary
year with their first success of the winter season, winning the senior
title at the Renfrewshire County cross country relay championships over
their home course at the Cove Reservoirs.
Former French Foreign Legionnaire Tom McCallion gave Glenpark a lead
on the first lap that they were never to lose. By the start of the final
lap, Glenpark led from Spango Valley AC, with Kilbarchan AC in third
place, 26 seconds behind.
Robert Quinn turned in an excellent run on the final lap for
Kilbarchan, racing round the hilly, twisting course to record the
fastest lap time of 9min 43sec, and just failed by 50 yards to catch
fellow internationalist, Alan Puckrin.
Aware of his lead dissolving under the finishing charge from Quinn,
Puckrin raised his pace in the final half-mile to record the
second-fastest lap of the day.
Kilbarchan gained consolation for their narrow defeat when scoring an
emphatic win in the women's championship race, defeating Giffnock North
by more than a minute.
Clydesdale Harriers, fresh from their Western District relay win,
scored their expected victory in the Dunbartonshire Relay Championships
at Posties Park, Dumbarton.
British junior 1500m internationalist Des Roache gave Clydesdale a big
lead on the opening lap when scoring the fastest time of the day.
With Clydesdale coach Brian McAusland continuing to rely on
middle-distance track speed rather than long-distance stamina,
Clydesdale romped to victory, more than two minutes clear of Victoria
Park.
Shettleston Harriers, defeated twice by Leslie Deans Racing Club and
also by Clydesdale Harriers in the opening races of the relay season,
scored their first win when retaining the senior title in the
Lanarkshire Championships at Coatbridge.
With John Mackay and David Cameron recording the two fastest laps of
the day, Shettleston were never troubled by a weakened Cambuslang team
and ran out clear winners by a 200-yard margin from Cambuslang, who won
two of the three younger age-group races.
Good runs by Willie and Lee Richardson enabled Irvine AC to win the
Ayrshire relay title at Beach Park, Irvine.
Ayr Seaforth AC surprisingly led for the first two laps but then the
Richardson brothers went into action and removed Irvine's 30-second
deficit with the two fastest laps of the day.
JW Kilmarnock Harriers stopped Irvine achieving a title double when
winning the women's race, thanks to Linsay Cairns recording the fastest
lap on the final stage of the race.
* Former 5000m world record holder David Moorcroft and coach John
Anderson headed the Scottish Endurance Coaching Day at Rosyth organised
by Scottish national event endurance coach John Wands.
After a morning practical coaching session at Pitreavie Stadium
attended by coaches and athletes from all over Scotland and the north of
England, there was a series of lectures in Carnegie Hall, Dunfermline.

Everton 1, Tottenham 1
CHRIS Armstrong chalked up a personal milestone yesterday by scoring
his first Premiership goal in Tottenham's colours.
Manager Gerry Francis, meanwhile, was left to reflect upon a catalogue
of missed chances in the dying minutes that should have secured the
three points for his side.
Substitutes Ronny Rosenthal and Jason Dozzell were guilty of glaring
misses and striker Teddy Sheringham also sent a close-range effort wide
of the post.
Armstrong, a #4.5m summer signing from Crystal Palace, has struggled
to establish himself at White Hart Lane and has been the target for the
critics. He showed yesterday, however, that he is capable of scoring
goals at this level -- and spectacular ones at that.
Armstrong got away from Dave Watson as Clive Wilson sent a marvellous
long ball over the top of the Everton defence in the thirty-seventh
minute. There was still a bit of work to do, but Armstrong carried it
out wonderfully, delivering a superbly executed shot that flew past
keeper Neville Southall.
The Spurs fans raised the roof, yet minutes earlier they had jeered
after he squandered a simple chance. Sheringham and David Howells linked
up to release him in the box, but he only succeeded in finding
Southall's body with his shot.
Sheringham missed a good chance before Graham Stuart opened the
scoring for Everton after 13 minutes. Vinny Samways played a delightful
one-two with Andrei Kanchelskis and the Ukrainian fired in a fine cross
before Stuart raced unguarded into the area to power a perfect header
beyond keeper Ian Walker.

WHAT are Messrs Douglas, Beattie, and Logan trying to do to rugby?
Higher profile, PR men? Whatever for? Rugby is a team game. They are
doing all they can to assist in the exploitation of it.
I was at Melrose last week and cannot believe that the little
gathering amounted to 2000. They were mostly disappointed. It was a game
Melrose should have won had they been able to capitalise on Stirling
County's abuse of the laws and the spirit of the game. Mr Logan touched
the ball less than 10 times, I would surmise. He wants paid for that?
If he wants to make district rugby more interesting, should the
Districts ask to be admitted to the English County Championship? The
Auld Enemy always brings a bit of edge.
Rugby is not part of Scotland's culture -- nor will it ever be. It is
a minority sport and, what's more, a minority interest. It captures the
nation's attention only at international level.
Do we really want more and more games of less and less interest? I
think not. What about a proper league that lasts the season?
We all know that if it were not for external forces, Scottish rugby
would still be amateur. Money isn't going to make a team to compete with
the top five and win.
Players come and go, making friends and enjoying themselves, and the
vast majority will never make any money from the game, nor do they
aspire to.
Come on SRU, don't pay them -- let them, in Mr Logan's words: ''Do
what they would be proud to do for nothing.''

CHAMPIONS Australia set up a Wembley rematch with England in
Saturday's World Cup final with a nail-biting victory against New
Zealand in yesterday's semi-final thriller at Huddersfield.
The Kangaroos, beaten 20-16 by England just over a fortnight ago in
the World Cup opener, looked to have killed off the Kiwi challenge when
they led 20-6 with only a quarter of the game remaining. But the brave
underdogs rocked the tournament favourites with three tries inside the
last 20 minutes to take the game into extra-time -- of 10 minutes each
way -- and set up a grand finale.
First, winger Richard Barnett went over, and then there was a try
apiece for the Iro brothers, Tony and Kevin -- the Leeds centre -- to
level the scores with two minutes left.
Kiwi captain Matthew Ridge actually had the chance to win the game if
he had converted Kevin Iro's try, but his pressure kick fell short and
the Aussies breathed again.
And the relieved holders took advantage of their luck with a try in
each half of extra-time, from centre Terry Hill and skipper Brad
Fittler, to book their place in next weekend's eagerly-awaited final and
keep alive their hopes of a fifth successive world title.
The Aussies, who made 13 handling errors in all, will surely have to
tighten up their game if they are to have a chance of exacting revenge
on England, who beat Wales 25-10 in Saturday's first semi-final at Old
Trafford.

HAVING, like many, criticised the sickening ''media hype'' surrounding
the O J Simpson trial, I took comfort from the fact that this had been a
peculiarly American phenomenon and unlikely to be seen in our own press.
Was I mistaken, or have I recognised recently an equally sickening
''overkill'' in our press in the space allotted to apologists associated
with the convicted footballer Duncan Ferguson?
Ferguson was convicted on acceptable evidence of a ''thuggish''
assault and, on the basis of that event and previous behavioural
aberrations, was duly punished. To Ferguson's credit, we have not so far
been exposed to his opinions on the matter, which may be partly due to
lack of writing paper in his present abode, but the chorus of
condemnation of the sentence emanating from his peers has more than made
up for his silence.
Managers, players, and union officials have publicly stated their
support for Ferguson both by belittling the serious nature of his
actions and by decrying the sentence levied.
What saddens me in this response is that these same apologists fail to
recognise that their utterances are read and slavishly believed by a
large number of young, impressionable supporters who may accept such
values as their own.
If the behaviour of Ferguson is the standard acceptable to football
then why do we not withdraw police cover from football games, thus
allowing the gladiators to engage in their barbaric games unimpeded?

SCOTLAND will tonight stage its first professional boxing show since
the tragic ring death of Jim Murray on October 13 when the St Andrew's
Sporting Club hosts a bout for the vacant Scottish light-welterweight
title in the Forte Crest Hotel, Glasgow.
Alan Peacock, of Cumbernauld, takes on Glasgow's Steve McLevy over a
scheduled 10 rounds, but the bout is unlikely to go the distance because
both men like to go forward and something will surely give.
McLevy, a former Scottish amateur champion, made an impressive start
in the paid ranks by winning his first six fights. But he learned a
harsh lesson back in June when he was stopped in the first round by
Mickey Hall, an opponent Peacock beat three months previously.
But just to confuse those who stick rigidly to the form book, McLevy
easily outscored Hartlepool's Kevin McKenzie in February, 1994, whereas
Peacock has since lost twice to the Englishman, first on points, then on
a sixth-round stoppage at tonight's venue back in March.
There is little doubt that Peacock is the more experienced boxer, but
he loses more than he wins, while McLevy is fresher. The danger to both
men is that they are prone to cut, but I would expect the heavier
punching of McLevy to prove decisive around the sixth round.
In the main supporting bout Glasgow super-featherweight Davie McHale
makes his first ring apperance since losing in a challenge to Floyd
Havard for the British title.
McHale is one of the most determined fighters in the country and is
convinced he can win the British crown within a year. Tonight, he takes
on the tough Chris Aston, from Huddersfield, and I would be surprised if
the Scot, who is a devastating body puncher, did not finish the fight
inside the distance.

DEALING, as it does, with the recent, awful death of the young boxer
James Murray, the inside back page of The Herald's Monday Sports Section
(October 16) is, none the less, an unwitting testament to the ignorance,
cant, dissembling, and spurious sociological reasoning espoused in the
cause of formulating a defence of the ''sport'' of boxing.
Jim Reynolds begins his article by affirming that ''it is difficult .
. . to defend boxing at this time,'' and then proceeds to attempt to do
just that. He cites Jim Watt as a paragon and challenges, ''Would anyone
dare say . . . that boxing has been bad for Jim Watt?'' What kind of
logic is that?
In the same article, Terry Lawless almost beggars belief by asserting
that without boxing, the ''kids who flock to the gyms . . . would be
dangerous hooligans, turning to crime and violence on the streets.''
What about the ''kids'' who flock to badminton clubs or football clubs
or snooker clubs, or the Brownies, for heaven's sake, any other kind of
club, for that matter? Are they also potential ''dangerous hooligans''
saved from their predisposition to ''crime and violence'' by benevolent
and altruistic adults? More nonsense!
Ian Paul, in his article ''Morality is ever harder to defend,'' is
equally disingenuous if not downright hypocritical. Where is the
consistency of reasoning which, within the space of a few lines, can
state that ''there can have been few more degrading spectacles than was
witnessed in the name of sport . . . last Friday,'' and follow that up
by also affirming that ''banning it would encourage underground versions
of the sport'', ergo, ''it has to go on''?
For all the talk of comparative numbers of deaths in other walks of
life, there simply is no justification for our affirmation of an
activity, namely professional boxing, the purpose of which, per se, is
to hurt another human being.
As Ian Paul ended his article, ''God help us all.''

SUPPORTERS of that particular form of brutality called boxing argue
that if it was made illegal, boxing would go ''underground.'' Perhaps
that is precisely where it should be, alongside bear-baiting,
cock-fighting, and dog-fighting.
Some of boxing's advocates, such as Barry McGuigan, have said that it
is an important outlet for aggression. If that is a valid argument, then
we must look at other activities such as the ''martial arts.''
Other advocates tell us that more people die in mountain accidents
than die in boxing, but that simply underlines the fact that a boxer
aims to disable his opponent. The difference between boxing and other
dangerous activities where deaths do occur, such as motor-racing, is
that those competitors are not specifically trying to harm another human
being.

AS Hugh McIlvanney first pointed out years ago, the main argument
against boxing is a moral one and not a statistical one, and maybe it
is. However, the contention that injuries and fatalities in other
high-risk sports are the result of accident rather than design is a
dubious one.
Deaths in motor sport, for example, are an obvious inevitability and
those affected by sporting tragedies will not be too concerned with the
chattering classes' semantics on whether the deaths are moral or
immoral. Boxing does not have a monopoly on the blood lust. The majority
of those watching the grand prix on television are attracted by the
prospect of a gory crash.
Boxing is the essence of competition minus all the sanitising
embroidery like balls, nets, etc, which make competition socially
acceptable; competition in the raw. It has also been called the most
honest form of competition. The martial arts demonstrate this clearly
and the suggestion that they could fill the vacuum created by the
abolition of boxing is extremely ill-considered.
With the exception of judo, the martial arts are a theoretical kind of
''kid-on'' fighting which appeals to a weird mentality, which harbours a
desire to be some kind of TV tough guy, but which doesn't have the guts
or ability to climb into a ring. (Ironically, the best one-on-one
fighting is true wrestling, which is completely unglamourised and
unpublicised).
One only has to look at any school playground and see youngsters
practising their Bruce Lee kicks at one another's genitals to see that,
by comparison, boxing is truly the Noble Art.
To claim that our society is too moral to accommodate boxing is to
bury the head in the sand and deny the all-too-obvious human capacity
for violence. It looks to me that the more immoral our society becomes,
the bigger the abolitionist lobby becomes. The ethics of boxing have
been discussed over the years by many able people, but your
tabloid-style editorial adds nothing whatsoever to the debate and does
your paper a disservice.
We are still left with Hugh McIlvanney's question: ''In the age of the
neutron bomb, who is to define morality?''

NO DOUBT many arguments will be made over the next few days regarding
the rights and wrongs of allowing professional boxing to continue as a
sport actively accepted by society at large. Surely the time has come to
put a stop to these brutal and ugly contests before many more young
lives are curtailed before they have begun to flower.
Now would be an ideal time to take issue with the ''fat cats'' who put
a young man's life on the line.
Perhaps a test case, even if unsuccessful, would make those who cream
off large profits from the endeavours of these misguided young men think
again before putting their fighters in the ring.
No doubt these same ''promoters'' will say that the boxers know the
risks they take, but this can not be used as a defence any longer by
these same people who would never dream of putting on a pair of gloves
and climbing through the ropes.

THE bones of another largely disappointing week for Scotland in
European competition have been picked over and the usual calls have come
forth, ranging from ''sack the managers'' to ''lynch the players.'' Some
of the more zealous of football's disciples would have us all marching
up towards the House on The Hill brandishing pitchforks and torches.
Sack the palace, drag the rulers to the dungeon. It isn't the falling
leaves which tell Scots that autumn has come around again, it is the
scent of revolution in the air.
However, Jim Farry and his team of clerks are unlikely to be cowering
under the stairs. Angry uprisings and self-flagellation within the
football community have become an annual event, although this year the
pain has arrived a little later than normal.
Usually, Scottish clubs are out of Europe by the end of the
preliminary ties, whereas of this season's four representatives,
Rangers, Celtic, Motherwell, and Raith Rovers, only the Fir Park side
were jettisoned before the real action started. Progress? Perhaps, but
greater signs of improvement are required.
Rangers' struggle in the Champions' League -- they were not
particularly convincing in the prelims, either -- and Raith's defeat,
albeit honourable, given that Bayern Munich were their opponents, has
left the country wondering again about our obvious failings at the top
level.
Celtic, trailing only 1-0 from the away leg of their European
Cup-winners' Cup tie against Paris St Germain, are entitled to believe
they can go through, but in terms of style, panache, and technique, all
of our clubs are still way off the pace.
Nothing new in that, so why all the fuss? Belief that success in
Scotland will lead to any kind of significant triumph in Europe is born
of the same logic which would make someone think the fastest donkey on
the beach could win the Derby.
The pitch markings are the same and the laws of the game are
universal, but it is the manner in which some clubs are able to play
within these confines which make all the difference. Scotland simply
does not have the commercial potential, the population and, therefore,
the resources to compete on equal terms with a large number of European
sides, never mind Juventus.
Rangers played badly in the Stadio Delle Alpi last midweek, but even
if they had been able to produce their best it would still not have
measured up to the quality the Italians could muster. If Rangers were
guilty it was of failing to look as though they were giving their all,
but they were victims more than anything else.
They and all of our clubs who play in Europe are victims of our
culture, our mentality, which is too weak to cope at the highest level,
and of geography. We are small and have a climate which is unhelpful in
terms of trying to preach sunshine football, and there is nothing we can
do about that. However, that is not to say we should believe there is
nothing at all to be done.
The SFA's initiatives, which are designed to reach into the hearts of
communities and entice youngsters back into the faith, are laudable and
will be beneficial provided this scheme and its development retains a
high priority status, but the clubs themselves must do more to foster
talent.
Tommy Burns has already convinced his directors that more money should
be diverted towards a blueprint for a coaching system which would enable
Celtic to become the first Scottish club to embrace many of the
principles employed by those foreign clubs who have excellent youth
development schemes in place. Spending large sums of money on children
is alien to Scottish club directors, who still foolishly believe young
footballers will emerge regardless, but Burns has made progress with his
masters.
''Celtic have two grass pitches, and that's about it,'' he said.
''This represents a lack of foresight and if we are to get youth
development right then we must invest significantly in that area.
''I know, of course, that fans want to see success on the pitch. They
want to see the team win on a Saturday, but the strength of a club can
also be measured in its youth systems and the importance which is
attached to bringing through the right kind of players.''
Burns' vision includes a complex with proper training, eating, and
back-up facilities which would include a full-size indoor pitch. Already
Barrowfield is to have floodlights installed, so that the pitches can be
used for coaching youngsters in the evenings.
''This is all very close to my heart and I will make sure that in my
time the club works towards putting in place the correct facilities, so
that we can bring kids here and work with them in the proper
environment. This will be the foundation on which Celtic's future
success can be built and I believe the directors will go along with
me,'' he said.
''At the moment we have a system of boys' clubs and the boys come in
to Barrowfield once a week, but that isn't enough. It will have to be
done in stages, because it will cost a lot. But as far as I am
concerned, I am the person who has to spend the money, and developing
the training facilities to work with youngsters is a priority.
''The ideas have been put to the board forcibly, because we have to be
prepared to forsake the pot of gold today and look ahead to what might
be the benefits 10 years down the line and beyond.''
The more our clubs deal in foreign players the more impressive their
facilities will have to be, because European footballers are the
products of forward-thinking clubs and, if they harbour any doubts about
moving to Scotland, the sight of proper facilities might help.
Also, simple logic tells us that clubs cannot continue to spend vast
amounts on European players and if only they would look ahead they would
see the sense in investing in youth coaching and facilities.
The transfer of one of the best products of a proper development
system could pay for the cost of the entire exercise, and that is the
kind of language which would appeal to any club director. If Burns'
people allow him to set the pace, Celtic could not lose.

ONE suggestion I have not seen is to make safety helmets mandatory.
Cyclists have to wear a safety helmet to protect the head in case of an
accident. How much more sensible to wear one in a situation where blows
are deliberately made to the head?
Throughout the ages the head has always been protected when there is
danger; why not in the boxing ring?

EXCLUSIVE. It's a word that says this is important, has far more
prominence than anything else. A secret revealed, even. Newspapers are
constantly trumpeting an exclusive, whether it be the price of bread in
Papua New Guinea, revelations of forthcoming tax cuts, or even what
colour Gazza's hair is going to be for the Millennium.
Exclusive. It also says you cannot come in here. It's only for those
and such as those. I can exclusively reveal the most exclusive football
ground in the country.
In the shadow of the mighty Rangers (mighty in Scottish terms, at
least) is a junior football club. No two clubs side by side could be
more dissimilar. The huge Ibrox stadium towers over the Moore Park
ground of the second-division club.
At Ibrox, sophistication is the order of the day with Bears' Pakora
and Blue Nose Burgers for the faithful sitting in their Blue Heaven.
Next door a pie and a bovril would be a luxury.
Rangers sit proudly at the top of the premier division and not so
proudly at the bottom of their section in the Champions' League.
Meanwhile, neighbours St Anthony's struggle with much more mundane
matters.
No Petric, Laudrup, or Gascoigne for them. Rangers travel in comfort
to European ties in Italy and Germany, where they stay in top-class
hotels and their every whim is catered for. The high life. Life at the
top.
Not so the Ants. They travel to exotic Irvine or Kirkintilloch. None
is likely to feature in lifestyles of the rich and famous. When they
sell their homes the news will not make a feature in newspapers. But
their club is more exclusive than Rangers.
It may be difficult to get a ticket for a home game at Ibrox, but it's
impossible to get in at St Anthony's. At least it was the day I went
along recently.
Rangers were at home and so I left early and parked so far away I
could almost have got a plane to the ground. The trudge to Helen Street
was like The Great March.
The faithful were still streaming into Ibrox for a 3pm kick-off, but
the ''wee'' team in the green-and-white hoops had already started
playing. I knew that, because I peered through some bars around the park
(a bit like Duncan Ferguson).
A few casual spectators stopped to follow the progress of the game,
too, and then hurried off (to anywhere).
Then began the bid to get in to this most exclusive of clubs. First, I
asked one of the railings spectators. But that someone would want to pay
to go in to watch the game seemed to be somewhat peculiar to him. He
peered at me to check if I had recently arrived from another solar
system.
But then, many look down at the junior game. Wrongly, because although
there's a big difference betweeen the lowly teams and the
Barbour-jacketed fans at Newlandsfield of a Saturday, the camaraderie
and passion in junior football is in a class of its own.
But still I was enjoying life on the outside. A glimpse through the
fencing revealed that the game wasn't a sell-out. Indeed, there were
probably more people on the pitch than there were off it. But where was
the entrance? A walk from one end of the railings to the other did
reveal a gate, but it was firmly closed.
A small table just inside the gate probably meant this had been the
way in for those who had arrived in time for the kick-off. I carried on
staking out the place with occasional glances at the game.
Then what appeared to be a social club hove into view. These are
always a haven at half-time for the spectators to relax, have a pint,
and watch the racing from Wincanton or Newmarket. But the door was
firmly closed, too. A stern notice declared: Players and officials only.
Another passing acquaintance said: ''You'd better knock three times on
that door, but I wouldn't like to suggest who you ask for.''
There were two small hatches in the door. The days of prohibition came
to mind. A timid knock on one and it fell open. Inside was like the
Marie Celeste. This was no social club, but merely changing rooms. An
even more timid ''Hello, Hello . . . Is there anybody there?'' failed to
gain any response.
Defeated, I retired. But one day I will return to swell the crowd at
this most exclusive of clubs. Perhaps to make sure I get in, I'll become
a season ticket-holder.

GREENOCK runner Tommy Murray (IBM Spango Valley) narrowly failed to
win the Northumbrian Water Kielder Dam six-mile road for the third time
in a row from over 1000 competitors yesterday.
Murray, now back to form after his silver medal in the Mountain
Running World Trophy in Edinburgh last month, was beaten by just 13
seconds by Stewart Bell (Chester-le-Street) in a new course record of
28min 24sec. He overtook Kenyan John Muta in the last 100 yards over the
dam.
Edinburgh's Brian Kirkwood (Leslie Deans RC) retained the veteran
title in eighth place overall in 30-26, 20 seconds faster than last
year.
Veteran Trudi Thomson (Babcock Pitreavie AAC), from Dunfermline,
finished second, 50 seconds behind Welsh borderer Amanda Wright
(Bridgnorth), winner of the women's race in 33-03.
Meanwhile, Alan Reid (Peterhead AAC) had a very successful weekend,
winning the second North District cross-country league race of the
season over his home course on Saturday and then the Kirkhill Forest
Eight-Mile Race in Aberdeen yesterday. Results:
Northumbrian Water Kielder Dam 6 Mile Road Race. Men: 1, S Bell
(Chester-le-Street) 28min 24sec (record); 2, T Murray (IBM Spango
Valley) 28-37; 3, J Muta (Kenya) 28-38; 4, K Anderson (Bingley) 28-44;
5, J Lisiewicz (Morpeth) 28-46; 6, G Nagel (Gateshead) 28-54. Veteran --

ALAN McManus fired a title warning to his Skoda Grand Prix rivals in
Sunderland last night with an ominously easy 5-1 victory over Irishman
Ken Doherty.
''People may have written me off because my form hasn't been so good
of late,'' said McManus after booking a quarter-final slot against Joe
Swail. ''But I don't see it that way.
''If I play the way I can, I'm going to give a lot of players plenty
of problems. I am mega-relaxed and really enjoying my snooker.''
McManus has dropped just two frames in reaching the last eight,
including the first of last night's match, which Doherty pinched on the
black with a 33 clearance.
The Scot responded by winning the next three frames before the
interval. Doherty was broken and he managed only 12 points in the final
two frames.
Swail booked his quarter-final place with a 5-3 win over Peter
Ebdon.''Losing my top 16 place at the end of last season was probably
the kick up the backside I needed,'' said Swail. ''I was beating those
players below me but I couldn't produce the goods consistently against
the top ones. So to knock out Peter is a big feather in my cap.''
Ebdon dropped the first three frames but hit back with breaks of 95
and 77 to make it 2-3. Swail won a scrappy sixth frame and though Ebdon
closed to within one again a frame later, the Belfast man's 91 break
closed out the match.

THE Forestry Commission has plans well advanced to introduce new
standards for British forestry in April 1996, with limited independent
verification of the standards achieved a year later.
There has been criticism for some time over the present guidelines
being too qualitative, and without much quantification. The proposed
standards are intended to describe more clearly how the guidelines will
apply in different situations.
''For each part of the country,'' said Mr Bob Selmes, the Forestry
Authority head of Forest Practice, ''there will be leaflets (standards)
describing concisely the types of sites -- there will be only a few
types for each area -- and the considerations which will apply. At the
most we think that there will be around 20 standards.''
They will not be described in terms of different geographical
locations, but rather as forest types, on the basis that Lowland
broadleaves are not going to be found in the Highlands.
The leaflets will spell out what is required to reach the appropriate
standards, and will define the operating range, or the part of the
operating range, which will be appropriate.
For example, the range of coupe sizes will relate to particular
circumstances, and the requirements about layout described, fitting into
the landscape, and into forest management.
The standards will look at environmental considerations. The need is
seen to develop the approach Forest Enterprise has taken in describing
to its managers how far they should go, for example, in terms of
landscaping, or early felling, or re-structuring.
There will be guidance on determining how sensitive certain cases are,
for what the standards require will depend on site sensitivity. Account
will be taken of site limitations, particularly on re-structuring where
the need for compromise is not really addressed in the guidelines at
present.
''We will also have to ensure,'' said Mr Selmes, ''that the standards
we are adopting will achieve what they are intended to achieve. For
example, we are diversifying age classes to encourage biodiversity.
''The Forestry Authority Biodiversity Initiative requires that we need
to look at the success of these measures. This is longer term work
outside the scope of the standards monitoring currently proposed.
''We intend to consult widely. At present we are discussing our
initial drafts with the Timber Growers Association, Forest Enterprise,
and the Environment Committee of the Home Grown Timber Advisory
Committee. After the initial drafts have been agreed we will be going to
much wider consultation, hopefully on the main group of standards by
later this year.
''Following on from this the Forestry Authority will organise
monitoring to ascertain how the standards are actually working. This
will be additional to the work which the Authority already does
regarding compliance of proposals with work carried out and its other
quality control work.
''The introduction of standards will make easier the quality control
of what is being achieved in British forestry.
''We want to put this into a much more organised framework, to be able
to say this is what we are doing as regards monitoring, and this is what
we have found.
''Once the standards have been drafted we will go more into the
protocol for Forestry Authority monitoring. It will be undertaken
internally by FA staff. We recognise that this may not satisfy
everybody.
''We therefore propose,'' added Mr Selmes, ''that there should be some
independent monitoring, largely because if we can produce a good
protocol for the Forestry Authority's own quality control work, this can
be confirmed by independent monitoring.
''A huge new sampling scheme will not be required. The independent
monitoring will be done on the basis of advertising and inviting
tenders, with possibly a separate contract for each country.''

NEWSVIEW: an intriguing battle in a changing constituency.
It looks like musical chairs, says Jimmy Reid, but when the music
stops, who will be sitting in the Govan seat?
OH WHERE is the Govan that I used to know? The bookies, the boozers,
and big Auntie Flo. She was 5ft 11in both upwards and wide. And her man
wi' a short pey, got couped in the Clyde. They don't make big wummin
like that ony mair. An ancient Govan ditty loosely based on the words of
an old sage, Adam McNaughton.
You see it's like this. Govan is the land of my fathers. Govanites
always had more than one, that's why we're called wee bastards, or big
bastards, as terms of affection. Anyone over 5ft 6ins is big in Govan.
Govan is the culture capital of Glasgow wherein resides the soul of
this great city. Govan, the dear green place wherein great men were
born, like Alex Ferguson, Joe McBride, Cut the Lugs Riley, and Einstein.
Not the Einstein who discovered relativity but Mo Einstein who
discovered how to make a bob or two from being a bookie.
Govan has a Guvin Ferr. The words and spelling reflect Govan's Pictish
origins. In Pictese Guvin Ferr means festival by the waters,
colloquially translated as -- bevvies on the banks o' the Clyde.
The ferr goes back donkey's years, as does Govan. God came from Govan,
every Govanite knows that. Wan o' the Christies, so he wis. Son o'
Josie, or wis it Francie? It was either Francie or Josie. I remember my
dad saying, ''See God, I knew his faither.''
The boss of features at The Herald suggested that I do a piece on
Govan, about who will be its next MP. Govan is a safe Labour seat,
except in elections, when the punters have been known to give Labour a
kick up the Kyber to make sure they're listening. I thought, this
assignment is a piece of cake, no bother at all.
But as you know, when you think like this, fate has the habit of
bashing you on the cranium with a piece of rolled up lead that might
have fallen from the voluminous coat of a young man working on the roof
of a nearby church. Well that's what happened to me, in a manner of
speaking.
The parliamentary Boundaries Commission has decreed that
Pollokshields, Dumbreck, and areas with abundant wally closes such as
Langside, are all now part of Govan. Will this endanger Labour's near
monopoly of Govan's parliamentary seat? No.
In times past the punters in Pollokshields would have resented being
called punters but now realise it's a badge of honour. In times past
they voted Tory, but that's now considered a badge of dishonour.
The residents of the tree-lined avenues of Pollokshields, and the Wine
Alley of deepest Govan, are as one. Comrades in arms. Middle Scotland
was scunnered by Thatcherism, and now substantially votes Labour. Real
Labour, not New Labour.
Middle England wallowed in Thatcherism. New Labour tries to woo Middle
England by dressing itself in Thatcher's clothes. But why should those
scunnered by Thatcherite Tories not be scunnered by Thatcherite
Labourites?
A question whose time will come, but in Govan just now confusion
reigns as to whom will represent Labour.
It's like this. The Labour MP for Govan, Ian Davidson, has been
selected to represent Labour in Pollok. The MP for Pollok, Jimmy
Dunnachie, wants to be selected as Labour's candidate in Govan. The
Labour MP for Glasgow Central, Mike Watson, his constituency disappears
at the next election, wants to be Labour's candidate in Govan. Mohammed
Sarwar, who won Pollokshields for Labour in the local elections, wants
to be Labour's candidate in Govan.
It looks like musical chairs, or a political dog's dinner, but it
isn't. All the MPs mentioned represented territory that now comes within
the new Govan constituency. The number of Glasgow constituencies has
been reduced over years, a process made necessary by the move of
population to new towns and suburbia beyond the city's boundaries.
Glasgow now has more Labour MPs than constituencies. The next election
will sort this out and that's for sure. It won't be easy. Contests are
healthy if they are healthy contests but it doesn't look as if the
contest to find a Labour candidate for Govan will do much for the health
of the party.
Career politicians, even nice ones, get to scratching and biting when
careers are endangered. Objective debate about policies and personal
merit tends to get short shrift, and so it is in the Govan Constituency
Labour Party.
Charges and countercharges are skiting about like squibs on Guy
Fawkes's night. Mike Watson's supporters talk of James Dunnachie
standing for selection in Govan only to ensure a ballot that is presumed
to benefit Sarwar.
But the National Executive of the party has already decreed a ballot
on the grounds that no sitting MP has sufficient territorial claim based
on his old constituency to be given an unopposed run in Govan.
I thought one person one vote was all about having ballots and having
the right of selecting, re-selecting, or de-selecting parliamentary
candidates.
Then Sarwar's supporters talk of a dinner party in the Bombay Palace
in Milngavie, where Mike Watson had a nosh-up with Aslam Mohammed who
was the defeated Liberal Democrat candidate in East Pollokshields, which
Sarwar won for Labour; Peter Paton, the defeated Independent Tory
candidate in the same ward; and Jimmy Abassi, a member of the
Pollokshields Conservative and Unionist Association.
''What was he doing there?'' I was rhetorically asked. ''Eating,'' I
timorously suggested. They scoffed, but so presumably did Mike. ''In
Mulguy?'' was the incredulous riposte, as if no-one ever ate in Mulguy.
Mind you, according to this logic Tony Blair, who seems to be talking
to Tories and supping with Rupert Murdoch all the time, should be
sacked, which, when you come to think of it, isn't a bad idea. But then
Mike Watson is no Blair, he's a socialist, a good MP, as his record in
Parliament testifies.
But then Mohammed Sarwar is a socialist. He joined the socialist party
in Pakistan in 1966 when socialism was claimed to be against Islam,
which Sarwar believes is the opposite of the truth. He will rhyme off
his working-class credentials. Son of a poor family, and he means poor
in a Third World context, he is not inclined to take lectures on poverty
from anyone.
He is no longer poor and is, in fact, a millionaire and getting flak
for that. Now millionaire socialists are not exactly thick on the
ground, but they do exist. I've personally known five, four were
self-made and one born to wealth, as they say.
When you have no money your socialism is perceived as envy for those
who have money, and when you have money your socialism is perceived as
being eccentric, for how can anyone with money be a socialist?
So far as I can make out it seems to be a contest between Watson and
Sarwar. The clever money appears to be on Sarwar. Labour makes great
play of being a multi-racial party and is entitled to do so, for here in
Scotland it has consistently set its face against racism.
None the less, if after the next election there is yet again no
Scottish Labour MP from the ethnic minorities, then doubts arise. Is
Scottish Labour only interested in gender balance? Are Scottish Asians
perceived as simply voting fodder? These concerns are surfacing in
Govan. Sarwar is a well-above-average candidate with an appeal beyond
the Asian community.
But if he is to succeed it will be at the expense of a very good MP,
Mike Watson. Scottish Labour's representation in Parliament is not that
great that it can view with equanimity the prospect of losing him.
In fact it's silly that such a choice has to be made. Both should be
standing for Labour in winnable seats. I get the feeling that Jimmy
Allison would have sorted this out long ago without any fuss. But maybe
Labour's current leaders are too busy recruiting Tory MPs to attend to
such low-profile tasks.
In the meantime I wish Labour members in the new Govan constituency
would stop playing games. To mix metaphors just a wee bit, they're
playing with fire.

LEADERS of the Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb Association are confident
that a current four-week European promotion will lead to valuable export
orders.
SGBLA are working with Marks and Spencers in a sales drive in 15
selected stores, including outlets in Brussels, Amsetrdam, Madrid,
Barcelona and Paris.
''We are capitalising on the store's reputation for quality and this
effort is a direct results of the Scotland The Brand promotion in Paris
earlier year which produced a 70% increase in Scotch beef sales,'' said
Brian Simpson, chief executive of SQBLA.
''This is one way of influencing other supermarkets throughout Europe
to consider handling Scotch quality produce.
Jean Claude Leroux, M &amp; S marketing director for foodstuffs in Europe,
said: ''We want to establish niche outlets for high quality, premium
foods in our stores in Europe; Scotch lamb fits that description''.
Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire farmers have done well in the Suffolk Sheep
Society 1995 flock competition. The Keeble cup for flocks of 61-100 ewes
was won by Robert Wilson's Strathislae flock, North Dorlaithers,
Turriff, with George Stuart's Birness flock, Ellon, reserve. In the
large flock section H. Stuart and Davishill, Udney, came second to the
Gold Cup winner, Stan Hulme, Ellesmere, Shropshire.
* The Scottish National Farmers' Union has called a special general
meeting for November to increase the membership subscription by #10 plus
4% for full farming and horticultural members and by #5 for crofting and
associate members. The levy is to help pay for the proposed new
information division.

THE Salmon Inn was the place to be on Sunday if you were looking for a
fight. Like the rest of the farmers in the North-east the discussion
group are absolutely furious.
It isn't that the Government has declined to give us a penny piece of
help with the damage caused by the monsoon in September. None of the
lads expected any so they were quite prepared to get nothing.
But what they were quite unprepared for was the headlines that greeted
them last Saturday. When, like every other farmer in the North-east,
they looked at Saturday's Press &amp; Journal they were hit by a front page
which led with ''Flood hit farmers to get #35m aid package''.
The lads were beside themselves with rage. The truth is that they are
not going to get a penny that was not on its way already. All the
Scottish Office are doing is letting us have our next bite at the
European cherry either one or two months earlier than expected.
''Thousands of North-east farmers were celebrating last night after
Scottish Agriculture Minister, Lord Lindsay, unveiled a #35m package for
the victims of the floods.''
Well, wherever those thousands of farmers were celebrating they
certainly were not having a pint at the Salmon Inn.
''It is a disaaaster!'' cried Mossie in exasperation.
Mains was onto the paper and giving them an earful. And the Red
Rooster was all set to resign from the Union when he remembered he
already had. And he didn't care much for the headline the week before
which said, over a picture of John Ross (the National Farmer's Union
President) looking disconsolately at a flooded field, ''North-east
farmers beg for flood aid.''
''Dinna mak me a beggar for gettin what's due to me a month earlier
than expected.''
I tried to tell the boys that, while it wasn't worth #35m to us, the
early arrival of our area payments was worth a bit. If everybody had an
overdraft it would save the farmers getting on for half a million. I had
also worked it out that that was something less than #200 per farmer.
It was Crookie, usually the mildest of men, who would have none of
that. ''Rubbish! It's jist Harbro and the North-eastern (co-op) that'll
get anything. They're sitting there waiting for the AICS money to come
in. If it comes a month early that jist means the suppliers get paid
earlier. It's worthless to us.''
''Aye boys, I see you're gettin another #35m'', was not the thing to
be saying to farmers in Aberdeenshire last week, but plenty of people
were saying it.
It did not please us.
But we'll get over it, for a week is a long time in farming.
Look at Crookie. There was I saying last week that I wouldn't like to
be him with two hundred acres of tatties marooned in the sodden fields.
It was a toss up whether he would have to sell the new Mega back to the
makers or try to get the builders to take the wife's new kitchen back.
Now, with a great crop of tatties coming in in good order with no
signs of blight or cracking and the price of the tubers not sure whether
it is going to go above #400 a tonne or dip below #300 he is looking for
new ways to spend some more.
And Penny-washers, the white settler who, despite the difficulty he's
had in getting to know how to work one farm, has now bought another two
in Aberdeenshire, has more or less recovered from the floods. But he's
had some difficult times.
No more so than when he saw what looked like a tiny weather-window in
late September. He thought there would be just enough time to bale the
hill field.
The weather was not very reassuring so he decided to work on the
principle that if a baler operated at five miles an hour would finish
the field in three hours a baler operated at fifteen miles an hour would
do the job in a hour.
It was one of those theories which worked better on the computer than
it did in the field.
To cut a long story short the speed was too much for one of the
wheel-barings on the baler. Pennywashers thought it would last out till
the field was finished but he was wrong. The baring heated and set fire
to the baler.
That would have been a small problem for one of those farmers who
carrys fire extinguishers in their tractors but Pennywashers isn't one
of those. He decided to make a dash for the steading with his blazing
inferno. This involved going even faster and heating the baring even
more.
As Pennywashers made it gratefully to the farm he looked back and saw
to his horror that he had set the straw alight right across the field.
The wind was in the east and his neighbour's wood was in the west but he
had no time to worry about that. Just as he turned into the close the
superheated baler broke its axle and the wheel fell off.
Tricky times had clearly arrived at Pennywasher's door.
However, his luck was to change. The straw wasn't nearly dry enough
for baling and was only just dry enough for burning so the fire was
unable to resist the rain that had started by the time Pennywashers had
found the fire-extinguisher.
Amazingly, the baler wasn't even damaged by the fire, though it no
longer looked shiny and new.

LIKE journalistic colleagues who toil to keep up to date with events
that will fill (or baffle) the minds of the readers of the vast acreage
of sports pages I am waiting (not breathlesly) for the latest news in
the transfer market.
Not the multi-million pounds that are paid for a much feted footballer
who will move, after much hyped secret moves, from one team to another
where he will don a new strip for as many weeks as fitness, injury or
red cards will allow him to excite his new followers, cramming the
grandstands to estimate his real worth over 90 minutes.
The idols in farming fantasy are the ones that switch sides (flocks)
for the lesser (or are they) fortunes that are spent on aquiring a
youngster whose only task to prove his worth will be to turn out in on a
cold, rainswept hillside this autumn and try to prove his worth to a few
sheepskin clad females and whose progeny will turn up at market in a
year or two hoping to earn more than their dad did.
Agricultural editors of daily and weekly newspapers who preceded me
and who have followed on never fail to be amazed at the money that can
change hands in the pedigree livestock markets throughout the country.
When a record 60,000 guineas (#63,000) was paid by an American breeder
to aquire a slip of an Aberdeen Angus bull called Lindertis Evulse (who,
incidentally, never sired a calf) even the popular media had to latch on
to what was normally routine farm market reporting.
Now when we see #50,000 being paid for a Blackface ram it merits
little more than a headline on the farming page of your newspaper.
And again the critics of such high price wheeling and dealing ask:
''How can sheep farmers justify coughing up that much when they would
have us believe that the sheep industry is down at the heels, stony
broke even!''
We have heard this week how the Scottish Office and the EU auditors
are amazed at the high proportion of farmers who could could claim
subsidies fail to do so because they have not kept simple records.
Thereby some flock oners have foregone up to #20,000 to help keep them
in business.
I said it's been said before and when the next generation of
agricultural correspondents report on #100,000 rams the same questions
will be raised.
It will certainly be raised by the cynics next week when farming
leaders go back to Westminster to continue pleading the case of extra
cash aid for the hillfarming industry.
The Scottish sheep industry has struggled long and hard to survive and
to gain valuable footholds in the export markets of Europe. It has done
so by staying level headed in the face of the elements and by paying
commercial prices for good working stock.
Farmers who, when they have time and cash, turn up at football grounds
at Perth, Stranraer, Brechin, and Dingwall know the value of hard
working lads who will work for a season rather than an over-rated
upstart who only wants his oats fed to him in a fashionably striped
platter.
Open to transfer fees; but not for hill farm duties!

THERE are growing fears that the Government's review of public sector
research could place the highly regarded integrated Scottish system of
food and farming research, development and education in jeopardy.
This is in spite of last month's announcement by Ian Lang, President
of the Board of Trade, of an end to Government proposals to rationalise
laboratories along market sector or geographical lines, as recommended
by last year's efficiency scrutiny report.
But alarm bells have begun ringing in the Scottish National Farmers'
Union headquarters in Edinburgh and Ian Melrose, the union's legal
adviser, has confirmed that meetings were being sought with directors of
the Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes (SABRIs).
''We are concerned that the overall philosophy of the scrutiny could
lead to a rationalisation of the SABRIs which could mean a loss of some
establishments or a drift of facilities to the south,'' he said.
''We are also particularly concerned there may not be a full
understanding of the integrated system of research, development and
education in Scotland and the links between the SABRIs and the Scottish
Agricultural College.''
Directors of the Scottish institutes were either unavailable or
unwilling to talk about the prospects. A spokesperson said they were
keeping a watchful eye on proceedings but were reserving judgment as
there had been no official communication.
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council also found
itself tongue-tied on the subject. ''We are not willing to comment or
speculate on these reviews,'' said a spokesperson.
But the review has already been sharply criticised by the Institution
of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, which represents some 30,000
scientists and support staff, who called it ''our recipe for renewed
uncertainty and interference by politicians''.
It points out that the new set of prior options reviews which will
carry on until the end of 1996 follows a two-year review of the same
subject. ''We are spending more time reviewing the labs than actually
doing the science,'' says Bill Brett, IPMS General Secretary.
He sees the new round as an excuse to mount another drive for
privatisation, this time under the personal direction of the deputy
Prime Minister.

THE textile industry has been battered in recent years by the slump in
consumer spending but Zig Zag Designer Knitwear came through the tough
years and is now once again in an expansion mode.
Last month the Ayrshire company purchased the design range of Maggie
Hyne, the Edinburgh designer who has gone off to America.
Maggie Hyne will design for Zig Zag from her new home in America, and
the company plan to use the design range to break into the Japanese
market.
''Design, design, design,'' said Zig Zag's managing director Craig
Walker, ''business has not been easy over the past few years but we have
survived by concentrating on quality design.''
Zig Zag was founded eleven years ago by Caroline Keogh, and Craig
Walker joined Caroline, his sister, three years ago.
Until now the company's core business has been in the UK, but Craig
Walker now sees opportunities abroad.
Zig Zag has recently invested in new machinery which will be able to
make lighter garments, and says Craig Walker design motivated the
investment.
He is critical of the Government's reduction in Capital Allowance
which he says makes it much more difficult for small companies such as
themselves to invest in machinery.
''It seems,'' he said, ''the Tory Government are no longer interested
in small businesses.''
However Mr Walker had praise for Ayrshire Enterprise whose Textile
Group proved very helpful, and also for Strathcldye Business
Development.
''The Textile Group brought a group of London buyers to Ayrshire, and
since then a number of individual buyers have returned.''
This renewed interest by London retailers says the knitwear boss leads
him to believe that the future looks more promising than recent years
when UK retailers looked abroad when buying.
At the same time the SBD's Managing Technology Training Grant has
helped the company to focus on their customers' needs, and also to
increase the productivity of Zig Zag's 22 strong workforce by between 10
and 15%.
This week Zig Zag is at the Made in Scotland craft, gift, and textile
trade fair in Aviemore where Mr Walker is confident that the company
will have its best ever year.

FOOTBALL crazy Scots exiles may soon be able to buy the match
programmes of their favourite football team at the same time as home
fans.
Colour Network, the Glasgow-based digital origination company are
poised to offer this service to Scottish football clubs using their
hi-tech equipment.
Formed in January 1994 by four workmates who decided that the future
of colour repro lay in electronics, Colour Network has invested more
than #600,000 in digital scanning equipment.
Managing director Robert Gray, and his colleagues Robert Connell, Alan
Harris, and Bill Woodward believed that this was the road the industry
was going down, but admit to being surprised themselves at the rate at
which the technology moved.
In the space of two years Colour Network's turnover will have gone
from nothing to close on #1m, and the number of employees from seven to
18.
''We tried to anticipate the growth in this business before we
started,'' said Mr Gray, ''but we have been surprised at the rate the
industry has become electronic.''
In the short time Colour Network have been operating they have
established themselves in two niche markets, packaging and labels.
Mr Gray believes the company will continue to expand in these areas,
and expects to be employing another six or eight in the coming months.
He said: ''We are also going to expand into new areas including the
transmitting of electronic data to countries such as New Zealand or
Australia.''
Using the latest technology there is nothing to prevent Colour Network
from sending a complete, newspaper, magazine or programme abroad.
''Whatever the document, we would send it down a telephone line in
digit form, and it would be output at the other end as film,'' Mr Gray
said.
Depending on the amount of material this entire process would take
hours rather than days, and the various titles would be ready for
printing.
Colour Network also believes that the storage of archive material in
electronic form will expand, and intend to offer this service.
It already provides this service in a small way for existing
customers, but believes the demand for such a service will quickly
spread and are gearing themselves up to move into this area.
The digital repro company are also considering establishing satellite
operations in Scotland and England to service local customers.
''We would not need to repeat the investment in the equipment we have
in Glasgow as our satellite offices in other regions or town could be
linked to our equipment here,'' Mr Gray added.

A NEW toysweet is set to hit the counters of multiple stores in the
New Year thanks to the determination of former joiner Joe Dyer.
The simple toy designed to cash in on the natural instinct of children
to collect anything from scraps to football stickers is set to be a
winner for Mr Dyer who has spent the past three years bringing Ploppy --
the Sweetoy to the market.
Two leading multiple stores have now agreed to take the toy/sweet in
January, and Joe Dyer plans to start production next month.
Ploppy came about after Mr Dyer approached Mr William Johnson, a
prolific inventor whose past inventions include Adidas Micropacer shoes
and Microsharp, which will revolutionise future television picture
quality, and asked him to devise a small innovative collectable toy.
Mr Johnson, who is based in Guernsey came up with the Ploppy cube, and
Mr Dyer has spent the past three years developing the sweetoy to a stage
where it could appear on shop shelves.
He formed Cubicom (UK) Ltd which has the world license for Ploppy, and
has spent more than #100,000 developing the sweetoy.
''It is a construction toy which also includes includes sweets, and at
the same time animal and alphabet stickers,'' said Mr Dyer.
Ploppy will be available in a six pack or two pack. It is expected
that that six pack will sell at #1.99 and the two pack at 69p.
''The six pack will include six cubes, three choc bars and 25 animal
alphabet stickers, while the two pack will have two cubes, eight
animal/alphabet stickers and a bar.''
Even before the new sweetoy has hit the UK market a leading Spanish
company has contacted with Mr Dyer about the possibility of the Sweetoy
being adapted for Europe and America.
''The Spanish company want to put their lollipop into the pack, and
they would sell it throughout Europe,'' he said.
The latest concept in sweets and toys combined says Joe Dyer will
teach children to count, spell, and increase their dexterity. The BBC
Eureka programme featured Ploppy earlier this year, and this helped
interest the major multiples, he added.
Within the next few weeks Cubicom hope to reach agreements with other
multiples which could see Ploppy the Sweetoy become the craze of 1996.

A YEAR ago Iain Henderson and Mike McIntosh felt that their jobs were
under threat.
The company they worked for was about to be sold, and their futures
were uncertain.
They put their heads together and decided to use their complimentary
skills to form their own company.
''I am an accountant, and Mike is an electrical and power engineer,''
said Mr Henderson, ''so we decided to decided to look for a niche in the
market place and target it ourselves.''
This led to Laplace Electrical Ltd being formed seven months ago, and
not only do Iain Henderson and Mike McIntosh have employment but they
have also provided employment for two other people, and are looking to
expand their workforce to six by the end of next year.
Laplace is a hi-tech company programming and servicing industrial
computers in a wide range of industries.
''A whisky company recently had a problem with bottles jumping out of
the bottling line before they were full,'' said Iain, ''and we had to
write a programme to stop this happening.''
At the same time as they were helping a whisky company to solve this
problem the company was also dealing with a water company to provide a
programme which allowed them to open valves at a waterworks by
electronic means rather than manually.
Laplace was set up with help from Drumchapel Opportunities who were
keen to bring a hi-tech company with potential for growth into the area.
''Drumchapel Opportunities introduced us to the Glasgow Regeneration
Fund who invested in the company,'' said Mr Henderson, ''and we also
received help from the Clydesdale Bank and Strathclyde Business
Development among others.''
In addition to helping companies make their machinery more efficient
Laplace has also been appointed the technical support centre and
stockist for Groupe Schneider's sy/max range of PLC's and are also the
Scottish distributor for Carlo Gavazzi Electromatic.
''The fact that such companies have shown faith in us,'' said Mr
Henderson, ''proves to others that we know what we are doing.''
Until now Laplace has confined its operations to Scotland, but already
it is looking further afield and talking to companies in other parts of
the United Kingdom.
Both Iain Henderson and Mike McIntosh have often been asked how a
Scottish company based in Drumchapel come to have a French name.
Mr Henderson explained: ''My wife Barbara chose it from a list of ten
because she liked the sound of it.''
Pierre Simon Laplace was a French mathematician and astronomer who
observed the motion of the moon, Jupiter, and Saturn.

DESPITE an age gap of at least 40 years, tenor saxophonist Harry Allen
and trombonist George Masso -- both from Rhode Island -- proved to be an
ideal match at the first concert of the Jazz Co-op's winter season on
Friday night. Both hornmen exude warmth and humour in their playing; as
well as innate elegance and good taste (evident also in their
selections).
The majority of numbers featured on Friday were duets on which the two
men locked horns and, it seemed, tuned into each other telepathically.
Such mutually complementary playing as theirs is usually either a fluke
or the result of a long-standing partnership; in the case of Masso and
Allen -- a non-permanent double-act with only an afternoon's rehearsal
under its belt -- it just came naturally.
Both players are master craftsmen, and when they sculpt a song they do
so with only the overall effect in mind: there is no ego-tripping or
rivalry involved; and the music comes out as a seamless whole rather
than a series of solos patched together. Witness in particular their
exquisite My Romance, a mesmeric interpretation of the standard on which
Masso and Allen took turns to unravel the melody.
A ballad take on Blue Monk was the most serious contender for
highlight of the evening: from the gorgeous harmonies of the opening --
tenor and trombone a third apart -- through to some wildly expressive
solos, it was possibly the best proof that these guys are partners in
perfection.
Virtuosity too in the rhythm section of Ronnie Rae (bass), Dave
Milligan (piano) and Tony MacLennan (drums).
Next Co-op venture: Warren Vache on November 28.

LINK WRAY'S presence on a British stage, albeit a very small stage, is
inevitably preceded by a guitar-case full of cool credentials. Not only
is the 60-something from North Carolina responsible for the seminal
fuzz-tone behemoth that is Rumble but his scabrous string-bending also
shimmered menacingly on the hippest soundtrack to the trendiest movie of
recent times -- Pulp Fiction. By ripping his amplifier speakers and
inventing a distortion-soaked sonic trademark Wray was, less
fashionably, an unwitting precursor of heavy metal.
He may be of pensionable age, but the well-preserved Wray wastes no
time with the more subtle offerings that pepper his newly released
Guitar Preacher retrospective compilation and instead slams headling
into a gale of the frazzled riffing and frenzied soloing for which he is
cultishly famous. Backed by a deftly primitive combo, he sets about his
battered Gibson with premeditated violence unleasing ballistic versions
of Rawhide, Streetbeat, and Bull Dawg and a cantankerous reading of the
aforementioned Rumble.
Primal, visceral but never shy of a tune, Wray's music bridges the
guitar genealogy gap between fifties novelty instrumentals and
latter-day hard rock bluster and tonight it's creator proves himself a
unique and indispensible maverick. The man deserves a bigger stage, then
there really would be no excuse for missing Link.

THIS turned out to be a stimulating three-in-one package: first, a
talk -- with demonstrated movement -- about the evolution of the piece,
then a performance of the piece so far, followed by an informal
discussion with choreographer Rosemary Butcher and the members of Group
N, the Scottish company who commissioned her to make a work on them. It
really was a rare chance for an interested audience to get beneath the
surface of a work, to see how someone like Butcher -- renowned for the
powerful, architectural elements of her choreography -- channelled
strong personal input from the dancers into a movement vocabulary that
held far-reaching images of how we all encompass notions of the past and
the present.
In performance, the floor space resembles an empty picture frame.
Edges are significant in this piece, both in defining limits and
perspectives and in pointing up moments of transition.
And as they journey in and through the different boundaries and
spaces, the sound score (Tom Murray) adds in provocative echoes of other
scenarios -- a playground, a busy street, brisk rain, twittering birds
-- and visual artist Su Grierson colours the central rectangle with a
heartbeat of exploding red, then a red wash which relentlessly sweeps
the space, finally a shower of red splatters that left me thinking of
emotional minefields . . .
There are just so many fascinating layers already present in this
work-in-progress that one longs to see how it further develops, not
least because the dancers -- Vanessa Smith, Brigid McCarthy, Fin Walker
and Lyn Denton, were responding to the challenge with all the stops out.
Simply one of the most exciting Scottish dance projects for a long,
long time -- the completed piece, it is hoped, will be shown early in
the new year.

PERHAPS it's coincidence, but I can't recall seeing a play with such a
strong sense of place since Michel Tremblay's House Among the Stars.
Like that play, Stones and Ashes is written by a French Canadian, Daniel
Danis, and translated, this time by Tom McGrath, into a rich Scots
idiom. And like Tremblay, Danis centres his action on a remote house in
rural Quebec.
The similarities end there, except to say that both writers have an
equally innovative approach to dramatic structure, but the effect is to
create theatre with the same kind of haunting resonance. And it's
fascinating to see how that effect can be built through the power of
language alone -- Caroline Christie's clean, undulating strip of a set
has a beautiful simplicity about it, but it is the descriptive muscle of
the text that conjures up the real visual imagery.
None of that would count for much if it wasn't for the quality of the
performances in Ian Brown's production. And whether it's Tam Dean Burn
as Clermont escaping from the trauma of his wife's savage murder, Molly
Innes as his daughter valiantly coping with him and her own adolescence,
John Kazek as Coco, an impulsive, half-possessed small-town street
philosopher, or Anne Marie Timoney as Shirley, a hard-bitten fellow gang
member driven by great poetic impulses, the performances are tremendous
realisations of the extreme elemental forces in Danis's play.
The dependence on narration demands a lot of an audience, and it
partly accounts for the elusiveness of Danis's themes (about the dead
weight of the past, about male intransigence and female adaptability,
about matching language to emotion), but concentration pays off in a
performance that is as intriguing as it is absorbing.

Alan Woods explores the inspiration behind Joel-Peter Witkin's
photographic masterpieces
JOEL-PETER Witkin once said of his work: ''This was the first time I
crucified a human being . . .''. He is not a sensationalist, and he is
emphatically not a pornographer; but his bizarre tableaux -- portraits,
explicit couplings, allegories and still lifes with human and animal
remains, always mysterious, and always (testing and extending our
definitions of beauty) beautiful -- are certainly easily
sensationalised. ''A lot of people when they see my work and the subject
matter imagine this person must be some sort of a monster or a demon.''
Stories, legends, have certainly arisen around his work and his
working processes; but he is a courteous and friendly man in his
fifties, with a half beard which, together with his emphasis on life as
a spiritual journey in which every moment involves a moral choice,
unexpectedly suggests a nineteenth-century New England preacher.
Hearing him talk about his work one thinks also of Baudelaire. Each
photograph involves both a lengthy and involved process of preparation,
including discussion with his models (often transexuals, dwarves, or
those without arms or legs), the construction of sets, and, after the
photograph has been taken, a considerable creative investment in working
and reworking the negatives and editioned prints, so that, unusually for
a photographer, even a good year's work yields no more than 12 images.
But, as photographs, they carry a peculiar charge; they are, for all
their artifice and symbolic load, nevertheless traces of real bodies,
living or dead, and indeed are plucked out of real time, albeit the real
time of ''a kind of mannerist happening'' which ensures that the
photographs and their subjects ''are of this time and not of this time,
in this reality and in some sort of metaphoric reality'', mingling
''what we conceive and what we perceive''.
We are used to seeing pictures of extreme and bizarre performances and
tortures in art galleries, from Bosch via centuries of crucifixions and
martyrdom to surrealism. We are sadly accustomed to documentary
photography of the horrors of war and famine. We are less accustomed to
art works, to photographs specifically, that are poised exactly midway
between the recording of real suffering and the representation of
suffering -- suffering and death, ''the last taboo''.
Witkin is a Catholic, and he interprets his subjects in the light of
eternity. ''At the end of my life I'll put my work on the altar of God.
We're judged, our life is judged, what we've made is judged. I'll get my
answer from the critic.'' He clearly views a life fully committed to art
to be parallel to the religious life, both in its focus and
single-mindedness and in its exploration, to extreme limits, of the self
(beyond ego) and the human condition (beyond death). ''Make me look
human'', one of his models -- born limbless and flayed -- asked him.
''Saints and artists have to engage with darkness'', in order to
''expel the darkness and see the beauty and wonder of things'' -- a
beauty which is also, indeed is primarily, spiritual; ''there's nothing
worse than just the surface''.
This is the wider context of a body of work which it is easy to
marginalise as a kind of therapy conducted in public. His first
photographs -- taken, interestingly in view of his continuing interest
in art history, as studies for his twin brother who was studying
painting, were of performers -- or exhibits -- in ''what's horribly
called a freak show'' on Coney Island, including an hermaphrodite with
whom he had his first sexual experience. ''I particularly enjoyed
working there because the people were very, very unique and wonderful
and different as opposed to the boring people in power that were outside
the tent,'' Witkin said.
He has written about how as a six-year-old, he witnessed a car crash
while (perhaps significantly) on his way to church. ''Somehow, in the
confusion, I was no longer holding my mother's hand. At the place where
I stood at the kerb, I could see something rolling from one of the
overturned cars. It stopped at the kerb where I stood. It was the head
of a little girl. I bent down to touch the face, to speak to it -- but
before I could touch it -- someone carried me away.'' One could suggest,
glibly, that he has been trying to touch that little girl's face in
every image he has made since; but he is unsure how much of his
description reflects his ability, his gift, to ''imagine possibilities
around any situation''.
''It happened in reality, but part of it was maybe a dream state after
that.'' Certainly, the Catholic culture in particular -- from Europe to
Mexico -- allows parallels even to such private traumas. If Witkin can
talk of his childhood memory of the smell of his grandmother's gangerine
-- ''when I woke up in the morning instead of smelling coffee or
breakfast I smelled her leg'' -- he can also talk of St Francis
overcoming his final feelings of fear and disgust by kissing on the lips
a leper whose presence was announced first by smell, then by his bell,
and only finally by sight. (Much of the emotion which he ''drives into''
his work seems to be related to other senses -- he heard the accident
before he saw it.) At the moment of that kiss, the leper became Christ.
Our world, Witkins says, ''is a kindergarten of violence and
pathology''; whether art -- Witkins or anybody's -- can transcend it
each viewer must decide alone.
* Joel-Peter Witkin's work is on exhibition as part of Fotofeis at the
Stills Gallery, Cockburn St, Edinburgh, until November 18.

PHYLLIDA Lloyd's breathtakingly audacious revival of one of the most
stylish comedies in the whole of English drama is nothing if not
controversial. Has she, for example, destroyed the tender ecological
balance or actually breathed new life into Congreve's eighteenth-century
comedy of manners?
Unusually, Lloyd has actually paid Congreve the compliment of taking
the content of his play seriously, heightening the Faustian knot of
money and commercial gain in matters of the heart and the relationships
between men and women, and turning it into the darkest, most malicious
of moral comedies.
Much of the laughter here is still-born. Richard McCabe's Fainall is
not a man to be trifled with either in matters of love or profit, while
Sian Thomas's Marwood, Fainall's lover, is a fascinating portrait of a
sophisticated ''other woman'' whose motives are as much to do with his
abuse of her as love.
On top of that, Lloyd has pushed recent updating trends to its logical
conclusion so that the central ''contract of marriage'' scene between
Roger Allam's Mirabell and Fiona Shaw's pants-wearing, defiantly ''new
woman'' Millamant becomes the staking out of something strongly
resembling a Bloomsbury ''modern'' marriage.
For all that, it's touch and go in terms of enjoyment. Anthony Ward's
satirically crude costumes -- Westwoodesque short skirts and bustles for
the women -- fall just this side of ugly, while Shaw, for once, seems
ill at ease. The glory of the evening is Geraldine McEwan's outrageous,
gloriously whispy Lady Wishfort. White-faced, dressed in a ridiculous
confection of red roses, she is vanity personified and helplessly
absurd. One of the -- if not the -- greatest comic performances of the
year.

IF only the President of Albania had thought to give us a bell. As New
York groupies of many years standing, we have long since figured out how
to get a bed in this town while the luckless Salmir Rephisti, second
secretary at the Albanian Embassy, had to tell his boss the city was
full. But not to worry, because he'd found a recent copy of the Yellow
Pages, Mr Rephisti got lucky. After his fingers had done the walking he
turned up not a room but a whole suite at an establishment in West 54th
Street.
Admittedly the world has not yet beaten a path to the Rihga Royal, but
at least they know how to treat a head of state: charge him 2000 bucks a
night.
The mother of all birthday parties has been a year and more in the
planning, the results of which efforts have been pretty dramatic. Lesson
one, unless your car is in a motorcade don't leave home or don't travel
overground. The streets which aren't full of police cars are full of
drivers who wished they'd gone to the movies instead. We haven't yet met
a real live President on the subway, but there's certainly a better
class of people riding the 123 line this week.
We could have used it in comfort to dodge the rain and get ourselves
to the World Financial Centre for the Mayor's welcome dinner party on
Saturday night, but inexplicably our invitation seems to have got
snarled up in the mail. Still Messrs Hussein, Rafsanjani, Castro,
Gaddafi, and Milosevic were still waiting for the postie to show with
their much-prized gilt-edged pasteboard too, so we're trying not to take
it too personally.
We had a very nice dinner elsewhere thank you, courtesy of a New York
friend with the good sense to cultivate Maitre D's in all the right
places. And almost certainly a more stress-free couple of hours than
Mary Beth Holler who got the shortest of straws when she found herself
appointed chef for the official bash. Just an intimate little spread for
140-plus leaders of their nations with a few royals sprinkled around and
the other seats taken up by the political great and good from New York
and Washington garnished by those business celebrities the Mayor might
want to shake down when the bill comes in.
Mary Beth knows that there may be 400 ways to stuff a chicken but that
most of her guests have had them all on the regular circuit. Beef was a
no-no on account of Hindu sensibilities, pork could have caused several
international incidents, and shellfish was not just ideologically dodgy
but a high-risk strategy with so many important intestines on parade.
Fortunately, this being the Big Apple, capital of the very universe
according to this week's modest drapings on the lamposts, help was only
a call away. As an etiquette consultant to the stars, Letitia Baldridge
knows about these things. Go for lamb, she advised Mary Beth. These guys
have been slaughtering lambs since the United Nations only had to invite
Abraham and the wife and kids round.
The security services could live with the lamb. They were pretty
relaxed about the vegetable timbale and basil crepe roulades too. But
Ben and Jerry's dessert offering caused a bit of a flurry in the Federal
doocots. Puddings calling themselves Multi Layer Ice Cream Bombe could
be said to be tempting fate.
Not that any little thing was being left to chance. The boss of the
catering company was prevailed upon to have an official tasting at which
no less a palate than that of the Mayor's wife was to be officially
tempted. In the event she sent a colleague from a TV food show who
pronounced the croutons too crunchy. This may be a town full of
high-priced dentists, but nobody wanted to be the guy trying to find one
if the head of the Zairean delegation cracked his wallies at the soup
course.
More of a nightmare than the food was the not-so-small matter of
protocol. Every single UN guest is used to being the biggest shot in
town and treated accordingly.
But protocol and pragmatism are often in conflict. Much head
scratching therefore went on over how to play the official UN birthday
snaps. Standing rows of dignitaries could have left vertically
challenged leaders like King Hussein lost in the crowd. Chairs were more
democratic, they figured. Which left the delicate business of the
seating plan.
At the dinner that had been easier. The guys who got the best seats
for the meal were those who had regularly appeared on a hit list. Prove
that somebody had recently wanted to make you an ex-President and you
would be ushered to the best table. Well, there have to be some perks to
being an assassination target.
But just in case anyone got miffed there were hundreds of waiters on
hand trained to do synchronised serving.
In between the solemn bits of this UN celebration, committees had
beavered away for weeks to ensure that any little tourist whim, however
eccentric, could be instantly catered for.
An arts committee produced four closely typed pages of cultural treats
accompanied by detailed instructions of how the delegation could take
free advantage of them. If the Botanical Gardens was your bag, they even
included a gridlock proof route. Early indications were that the
President of Chile would kill for two good seats at Sunset Boulevard
while Mrs Lichtenstein would settle for a decent crimper.
And while the top hotels had personal trainers and masseurs to hand,
priority was given to making sure the lift repairmen didn't take a
holiday weekend.
In the unlikely event of the French and Algerian delegations sharing
an elevator ride it was thought prudent to ensure they didn't get stuck
together between floors.
Meanwhile, as the strictly unofficial Scottish delegation, we have
managed to take in the Lincoln Centre's musical attractions a whole 48
hours before the glitterati go tonight. And that took some advance
planning and more than a little help from our friends. Just as well we
have our own entertainment programme really. For it seems we won't even
be able to crack security at the UN building to go in and hear the
wall-to-wall speeches from the distinguished delegates.
It'll be hell. But somehow we'll find a way to mask our
disappointment.

THE steady destruction of the English language continues. In the post
the other day came news of a new EU booklet to be published
occasionally. In Eurospeak its appearance was promised ''on the basis of
flexible periodicity''.
You can forgive the regional commissioner, Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies,
for being wordy when she meets reporters. She is, after all, a German
although her English is first class, if a touch orotund. Mrs
Wulf-Mathies told us the other day she had had an idea. Only she didn't
say it that way. Instead she talked of ''laying down a new focus
point''.
No excuses, however, for the social affairs commissioner, Padraig
Flynn, whose Irish way with English is not so much blarney, more
baloney. He meant to say that postal services were expanding in Europe.
Instead he announced that they were ''becoming more globalised in their
orientation''. None of this was caused by problems in simultaneous
translation. These remarks were all made in English (sort of). When the
interpreters get involved it gets worse.
I am grateful to Sandi Toksvig, the comedienne, whose father was once
a Euro-MP, for this beauty. He made a speech in which he quoted the
saying: ''The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak''. Through the
headphones came the interpretation: ''The vodka's fine but the meat's
off''.
Last week the European Commission's main man in London, Geoffrey
Martin, produced a booklet entitled Euromythology in which he tried to
explain why the British have such a talent for misunderstanding the EU.
''To undermine, one must first of all succeed at ridicule,'' he wrote,
and in that spirit he set about exposing the more ridiculous myths and
muddles behind Britain's fractious relationship with Brussels.
He covers much confusion indeed from the EU banning bent bananas and
double-decker buses to ordering the release of murderers and helping
Gerry Adams sue Britain for banning him from mainland England (by which
I think Mr Martin means Britain -- a wee muddle of his very own).
Mr Martin blames the English (I said English) tabloids for most of the
mythology and he is right to do so. But he avoids that awkward fact that
the EU's own abstruse, undemocratic procedures don't exactly help.
In the Brussels process known (sorry, more jargon) as ''comitology''
there are laws passed which never go near the European Parliament. Most
of them serve interest groups, mainly big business, and go unreported
until they are in force or pretty near to it. Hence the scope for scare
stories about straight cucumbers, fishermen having to wear hair nets,
the ban on Scotch whisky transported in traditional barrels, and all the
other half-truths and plain lies peddled by a predominantly
anti-European London press.
The whisky story was, it must be said, almost true. If it had not been
for Scottish Euro-MPs finding out what was going on and protesting at
Scotch being classified as a dangerous substance for delivery purposes,
it would certainly have suffered grievously.
That particular Euromyth was a typical result of a legislative system
which is too often secretive and undemocratic. Yet John Major bows to
the Eurosceptics by bashing Brussels in all such cases while resisting
more authority for the parliament, the only truly democratic institution
in the EU.
In a week when it was reported officially -- if not widely -- by
European employers that national governments produce more business
regulation than Brussels, Mr Martin recalled the example of ''Europe''
allegedly telling the Brits how much water they could flush in their
toilets. That is typical of a multitude of cases.
''Sometimes the EU is blamed for laws which have no connection
whatsoever with the EU but are purely national initiatives,'' he
complained. ''The EU came in for a certain degree of ridicule when it
was blamed for legislating on the maximum amount of water permitted for
the flushing of lavatories. There really is legislation on this subject
-- but it is entirely a UK responsibility.''
I feel for Mr Martin in his indignation at how these tales keep
appearing despite the facts. Over the past two-and-a-half years he has
rebutted more than 130 Euromyths. The Foreign Office has helped by
publishing explanatory booklets on Euromythology on the basis of
flexible periodicity. There is no sign of Mr Martin being permitted to
let up. He should set up a committee and apply for a Euro-grant. Now, is
that not a well-laid-down focus point?

THE HIDDEN WIRING. Unearthing the British Constitution
By Peter Hennessy
Victor Gollancz: #17.99
PERHAPS it is just as well that Pride and Prejudice is currently being
screened on television. It may provide a necessary distraction for those
we select and elect to run our national affairs. But perhaps, even, we
may be better governed as a result. In a private conversation with Rab
Butler in early 1963 we learn now that Harold Macmillan said of the role
of Prime Minister: ''Sometimes the strain is awful, you have to resort
to Jane Austen.''
It is phrases like that which make books like this worth reading. And,
come to that, worth writing. This particular gem is typical, brilliantly
evocative of Macmillan in the first place, and a delight because it is a
previously unnoticed recorded comment. Of course, that is exactly what
Macmillan would have thought and here it is, yes he said it.
This is indicative of the sort of research conducted by Peter
Hennessy. As a contemporary historian he is necessarily meticulous --
and gives generous credit, incidentally, to those who have helped draw
his attention to something, as in this case where he was directed to
Butler's private papers -- but because of his assiduous approach he is
always tripping across the most deliciously revealing detail or anecdote
or illustrative comment.
The book is what he describes as a walk round the constitution,
retracing the path taken by Walter Bagehot 150 years ago. It appears to
be based on what sounds like a series of lectures on the pentangle at
the centre of the British constitution -- Monarchy, Premiership,
Cabinet, Parliament and Civil Service -- sandwiched by a number of other
essays on how the system is working, or not, and accompanied by a rich
and rewarding amount of source material.
In the hands of many historians this could make for dull stuff. Peter
Hennessy is not like that. I wrote deliberately that the book ''sounds''
like lectures. It is partly because the vibrant tones of the author's
infectious enthusiasm ring from every page.
He has that particular gift of writing as he speaks and conveying the
irrepressible sense of interest that he brings to everything he does.
He himself acknowledges in his preface that he is often greeted by
nervous bemusement when he tries to convey his passion for the mysteries
of the way our nation works, but no-one could be bemused by Hennessy at
the end of the book. There are, of course, unanswered or possibly
unanswerable questions about these mysteries, but Hennessy did not
embark upon his walk with any objective other than a health-check for
the millennium.
He looks at everything to see if it is in good working order and he
asks questions endlessly, even if they are not capable of answers. He
uses the recurring image of a small boy who once caught a glimpse of
Queen Victoria and asked what she was for. He asks, for example, what is
the Civil Service for?
The consequence is that one could almost envy today's students with
material such as he produces as a starting point to their work.
It is readable, useful, and informative for anyone with even the
slightest interest in contemporary history and politics. There is a good
mix of biographical anecdote drawn from political memoirs, first-hand
analysis and observation from mandarins and politicians and historical
-- and, occasionally, literary -- parallels.
He describes how he had put the what-for question to an anonymous
public servant who replied: ''To run the country'' and then later, being
a good Trollopian, sent him Lady Laura Standish's declaration from
''Phineas Finn''. She observed: ''Every question so handled by (the
Prime Minister) has been decided rightly according to his own party, and
wrongly according to the party opposite. A political leader is so sure
of support and so sure of attack that it is hardly necessary for him to
be even anxious to be right. For the country's sake, he should have
officials under him who know the routine of business.''
The author also examines contemporary questions like the way in which
the Civil Service has changed from the mandarin approach of the
consensual post-war years to the can-do philosophy adopted necessarily
by officials under Mrs Thatcher. They may not have agreed with or liked
what they were asked to undertake, some of it being revolutionary in
Civil Service terms, but nevertheless recognised the need to get on with
it.
He looks at the politicisation of Whitehall and considers the impact
of a possible future Labour Government on a bureaucracy which has become
accustomed to a generation of one-party Government, but even though
these are big and important questions there are always telling little
tales and sometimes immensely revealing ones.
In the context of examining how close Mrs Thatcher became to her
officials, like Sir Charles Powell and Sir Bernard Ingham, he produces
an example from the 1960s of a memorandum on the timing of the 1964
General Election. It was written by Sir Tim Bligh, principal private
secretary to Sir Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Macmillan before him, and
was declassified this year.
Sir Tim briefs on the ''best time'' to hold the election, advising in
December 1963 that March 1964 would give the Conservatives the greatest
chance of victory as the economy was likely to deteriorate thereafter.
In terms of its significance to the public service the Bligh memorandum
is dynamite. That much was confirmed by a distinguished senior civil
servant who shook his head in horror when I mentioned it to him while
reading the book.
Yet to set against issues of that nature, or other practical current
considerations which will be of interest to Michael Heseltine, like the
problems inherent in creating a super-Minister with power and authority
over others of Cabinet rank, there are also hundreds of little
vignettes.
He reminds us, for example, of an occasion when Mrs Thatcher was
demanding at a meeting (sounding for all the world like any woman in any
household -- can't you just hear her asking Denis to put the milk
bottles out, or empty the garbage can?): ''Why do I have to do
everything in this Government?''
The chapter on the Cabinet is called The Necessary Shambles and I
suspect that this is where the heart of the book lies. Hennessy has a
plan for establishing a new Strategic Policy Committee, served by a
revived national think-tank on the lines of the Central Policy Review
Staff which was disbanded by Thatcher and is still much regretted by
those who care about the proper functioning of things.
There is no particular conclusion to the book, apart from making the
irrational work better, but that is a real concern to Hennessy. He does
us all a service.

WE are rapidly approaching a hard question: can the media and its
accompanying pack of public relations officers or ''spin doctors'' swing
an election one way or the other? I used to think not, but now I wonder.
The electorate should beware.
The plethora of modern media outlets, the impositions of early
deadlines and instant news, immediate reaction and counter-reaction,
split-second formation of opinion and judgment are big-budget pressures
these days. Time for cross-checking is limited.
It is not just a matter of truth or fiction and determining the
difference. We know the validity of the observation that a lie is
halfway round the world before truth has got its boots on. Bad news
travelled even faster than that, long before the electronic highway. It
is more a question of how a political event is presented and by whom.
Journalists invented ''spin'' for a story for various reasons, but
mainly to provide something different. Now we have ''spin doctors''
provided by the political parties (and the Government) to anticipate and
feed that requirement. It sometimes seems that more reflection goes into
the presentation of a political event than the event itself.
Last week in the Press Gallery we were treated to the spectacle of
rival party spin doctors briefing the press on an event that had just
taken place before their very eyes in the Chamber. This was a straight
confrontation in open debate between Home Secretary Michael Howard and
his Labour Shadow Jack Straw. I submit that one did not need
''guidance'' on which side had won, which side had lost, and why, on
this occasion. (It is not always so when debates have taken place behind
the scenes; your rapporteur, cross-examined, is then vital.)
A scan of the reference books shows that this is not a new
development, but it is a development that is threatening to take over
(say, a General Election) because of the pressures and the big stakes.
We are that much closer now to Emily Dickinson (1830-1886), ''Tell the
truth/But tell it slant''.
The ''spin doctors'', who I am coming to deplore except when I need
them, would no doubt prefer to rely on the observation of the nuclear
physicist Niels Bohr: ''The opposite of a correct statement is a false
statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another
profound truth.'' Political parties who employ them see the same things
differently, as we expect them to do.
The term ''spin doctor'' came from America. It defines the task of
putting out ''information'' that casts a person or persons in the best
possible light. The other side of the coin is that those who oppose the
person or persons concerned are cast in the worst possible light.
This process is developing in some quarters in an increasingly
aggressive fashion. The intrepid BBC reporter Nicholas Jones (who has
written a book about this) complains that he has been phoned up by a
''spin doctor'' at home early in the morning to be given a tirade of
abuse about something he had reported.
In the good old days, this used to be done by the politicians
themselves rather than their PROs, but they were rarely abusive and
angry in the main, only when they had been blamed for something that was
somebody else's fault. I have been rebuked by politicians for things I
have got wrong; no harm in that. I have been frogmarched in front of a
Government Chief Whip to reveal sources for questions I had been asking
that night about two elements of scandal (one right, one wrong). Such
pressure is resistable.
What I resent is unsubtle attempts to lead journalists by the nose. I
also resent what spin-doctoring and some elements of the media are doing
to political reporting. The slanted stories about Neil Kinnock were
every bit as bad as, if not worse than, the slanted stories about John
Major. So a certain element of retaliation comes into it; nowadays, the
''spin doctors'' try to get their retaliation in first.
The lamentable, over-packaged and presented party conferences are one
result of the ''spin doctoring''. The dearth of genuine argument out in
the open has come about because the media makes so much of disagreement.
Every difference of opinion is a row and every row a crisis. The tone is
not merely tabloid, it runs through almost the entire media. It produces
paranoia.
Here is an example of how things have changed. Lord Jenkins in his
book A Life at the Centre recounts that in 1970, as Chancellor of the
Exchequer, he personally remonstrated with the BBC for the first and
last time in his political life. He did it reluctantly and with great
anguish. He found it demeaning. This month, Mr Blair's ''spin doctor''
Alastair Campbell had absolutely no compunction in faxing BBC and ITN to
argue that they should favour his leader's conference speech above the
trial result of O J Simpson in their bulletins.
At the Tory conference, the controversial speech of Defence Secretary
Michael Portillo in which he floated the spurious concept that Brussels
wants to take over the British Army, could not be changed after due
consideration. This was because the media already had the text, well
before he uttered his speech.
If that chunk of it had been left out, it would have been interpreted
as having been ''ordered'' out by the Prime Minister. This would have
been interpreted in turn as a row behind the scenes. The irony is that
there was a row behind the scenes (and one in public too) anyway. How
will it play on television? is the benchmark for ''spin doctors''. So
party conferences become party propaganda, with a minimum of dissent
permitted in front of the cameras.
Of course the Labour Party, so long in opposition, takes this
desperately seriously. In better funds than the Tories, they can afford
23 press officers and plan for many more; there's a job going in
Scotland. They are moving out of the Elephant and Castle to glossy
Millbank in January, where they plan to stay until after the election.
The Tories, poor souls, are having to make do with a limited
professional staff and three ''amateur'' MPs.
General Elections are now fought almost entirely on television, so,
dear voter, try hard to discount for ''spin doctors''. But, remember
also, G K Chesterton's definition (which in my case comes too close for
comfort): ''journalist -- a person who works harder than any other lazy
person in the world''.

CANON Kenyon Wright says that the tax powers of the proposed Scottish
parliament could be used ''only if the Scottish people voted
democratically for a party that set out a specific policy either to cut
or to increase tax for specific purposes'' (October 18).
As voting will take place once per four-year term then this statement
means that any such measures will have to be detailed in election
manifestos, otherwise the tax powers could not be exercised,
subsequently, within the lifetime of each term of office.
It means that should the largest party fail to capture in excess of
50% of the parliamentary seats and its manifesto contained such a
specific proposal, then no other members could assist them in passing
the measure, unless, of course, the same specific proposal had been
similiarly contained in their own party's manifesto.
Canon Wright therefore precludes any response to unforeseen
circumstances arising during any parliamentary term, and implies the
need for detailed auditing of parliamentary expenditure to prove to the
electorate that all revenues raised by the tax movement had been
allocated to the specific proposal in question.
We can then look forward to a bright democratic future where
politicians have to detail and cost their proposals for the four-year
term within their manifestos, without revision within that four-year
term, and where the link between expenditure and taxation is exact and,
of course, public.
And if you believe this, you'll believe anything. More likely such tax
powers will be exercised like that of the spendthrift on receipt of a
shiny new credit card, where the line is quickly exhausted and the
future is spent paying interest while seeking an increased credit limit.

THE latest opinion poll findings give Labour a lead of 30 points over
the Tories who have the backing of a mere 26% of the British electorate.
That support actually represents a small improvement on the nadir of
their fortunes before Mr Major fought for his own job last summer, but
the gap is still huge. If it is to narrow, there must be evidence soon
which would identify the beginning of a new trend. The Tory conference,
which might have provided evidence of such a start, failed to do so;
given how successfully Labour's own conference was managed, that is not
surprising. Another opportunity will come with Mr Clarke's Budget next
month. He remains quite firm in saying that personal taxation will be
cut only if it can be justified but, given his jauntiness and insistence
that the economy is doing exceptionally well, the chance of cuts is very
strong. There would seem to be the necessary financial margin to allow
these and it could be widened by the sort of creative action which
provides room for cuts in one area by shifting burdens to another. It is
always a mistake to take expressions of pre-Budget pessimism too
seriously -- the oldest trick in the game is to play down opportunities
in order to deliver a pleasant surprise on the day. The real skill may
prove to be not in making cuts but in making, and justifying, them in
such a way as to leave opinion, informed and popular alike, undisturbed
by the thought that they are, after all, imprudent.
Of course taxation will not be the sole issue once the General
Election campaign is joined for the Tories appear to have accepted head
on the constitutional challenge inherent in devolution. They will
probably try to play again the Unionist card which they believe fell to
their advantage in 1992. It is not only in Scotland itself that that
tactic might gain votes, for the Union has emotional appeal in all of
its constituents -- even Labour is a Unionist party, as the SNP always
insists. Is Labour too much a Scottish party?  Because of the way in
which Labour was forced back into its traditional redoubts during the
Thatcher years, Scots are playing a disproportionately large part in its
present leadership. That this might prove to be a drawback in the south
of England was mentioned in John Smith's day, but has since been
forgotten. The strong representation of able Scots in Tony Blair's front
bench team may yet again be resented by Labour politicians elsewhere,
and particularly in the north of England, but it can hardly be exploited
by the Tories when they are so committed to the Union which allows for
such outcomes without a murmur.

SOME dodgy history has been celebrated on screen lately. First there
was Rob Roy showing the acceptable face of cattle reiving. Then in
Braveheart our national hero William Wallace defied the invader in what
looks like the Highlands (location Ireland) and lost his heart to the
Princess of Wales. Now from across the Atlantic Pocahontas comes to
haunt us in an animated version of the romantic tale of pioneers and
Indians in which brave colonial captive John Smith is saved by the
devotion of a native American girl, Disneyfied in her screen incarnation
as ethnic-Barbie. The tale always owed more to the imagination than
strict truth. For a start, Pocahontas wasn't her name. She was
apparently much younger than tradition suggests -- heaven forfend that
stout Captain John Smith should have had an eye for dusky nymphets. And
corroborative evidence for the episode is sadly lacking.
A concern for historical accuracy has never stopped the film-makers --
or, for that matter, the novelists whose cousins they are. In some works
of fiction, from Tolstoy's War and Peace on the one hand to Love and
Freedom, the recently released Ken Loach film of the Spanish Civil War,
on the other, authenticity of setting and sensibility contribute
materially to their significance. Other lighter works, geared more to
simple entertainment, happily play fast and loose with the constraints
of real life.
Does it matter? Do we worry that Robin Hood, from Errol Flynn onwards,
is a far cry from the original, whoever that shadowy outlaw was? Or that
the slew of identifiable hoodlums who shot to kill as depicted in
countless Westerns were a lot sleazier than the genre will admit? Of
course not. We enjoy the picture show and exit into the real world none
the worse, not often deceived. Sometimes, of course, there may be
advantage to be gained out of milking the mythology, as in the case of
Willie Wallace, aka Mel Gibson, and some SNP propaganda timed to
coincide with the release of the film. Chauvism linked with escapism --
long live the legend! Politics, like truth, may often seem stranger than
fiction.

JOHN Pollock, whose tragic death is reported elsewhere in this paper,
was by far the most charismatic and able Scottish trade union leader of
his generation. He might have been more than that: many observers
thought he was the best Secretary of State Scotland never had. It was a
mystery why, given so many opportunities, he never became a Labour MP.
He said to friends that he was too much of a Scot to be able to put up
with prolonged absences in London. Be that as it may, he was an enormous
loss to the parliamentary Labour Party.
Ironically, in view of his earlier sterling service to Labour in
Scotland, he first made his name as leader of the Educational Institute
of Scotland when he organised the campaign of militancy which preceded
the Houghton settlement early in 1975. During the winter term of 1974,
Scotland was wracked by a series of teachers' strikes the like of which
had never been known before. Pollock had only just arrived at the EIS
headquarters, having been for a number of years the successful and
immensely popular head of Mainholm Academy, Ayr. The institute's general
secretary at that time remained the austere and retiring Gilbert Bryden;
the idea was that John Pollock would be eased into his new job. Instead
he took over the EIS campaign, which started with work-to-rule tactics
but soon developed into a series of national strikes. Pollock's
leadership was remarkable. He had to take on his old Ayrshire friend and
mentor, Willie Ross, who was Secretary of State for Scotland at the
time. He did so, and won hands down. Not only that; he managed, against
the odds, to win the sympathy, and indeed the support, of parents across
Scotland.   The EIS was in those months effectively transformed from
being a rather staid professional teachers' organisation into a proper
trade union. When the protracted and difficult dispute was over, Pollock
set about modernising and streamlining the institute. He did so with
zeal, but he was never less than tactful, never less than kind. He was a
good and stalwart man, and his death diminishes Scotland.

THEY are rolling out the red carpet, beaming up the searchlights by
the esplanade -- and preparing to give Aberdeen the greatest night of
glamour it has seen in years.
For the first time ever, the Granite City becomes the venue (November
4) for the glittering awards ceremony of Bafta Scotland -- the film and
television extravaganza which not only recognises talent but celebrates
with a social occasion which shows that this modest-sized country of
ours can compete with the best.
The director of Bafta Scotland, Linda Pearson, was a driving force
behind those glamorous nights which launched Rob Roy in Edinburgh and
Braveheart in Stirling. And she is there again to mastermind Aberdeen's
big night, which takes place at the Beach Ballroom, that famous northern
venue which lies between Pittodrie football stadium and Harry Gordon's
old Beach Pavilion. But the task of actually staging the city's big
night -- and filming it for the nation to watch on the following evening
-- falls to Grampian Television, which has built an enviable reputation
for rising to the occasion.
It was Grampian's director of programmes, George Mitchell, who not
only went south to suggest a National Television Awards ceremony
reflecting the viewers' choice but proceeded to show that his own modest
company from the North-east of Scotland could actually stage the show in
London. Mitchell becomes executive producer of the Bafta night but
leaves the main weight of detail to two of his lieutenants, Terry Wolsey
and Graham McLeish, who are co-producers of the Scottish spectacular.
Grampian Television is naturally out to show that anything the BBC or
Scottish Television can do, they can do just as well. So it is pulling
out all the stops.
How many of the big names of the film world turn up on the night
depends so much on work schedules. But invitations have gone to a range
of stars from Liam Neeson to Lulu and Angus MacFadyen (he played Bruce
in Braveheart), as well as Scottish household names who are sure to be
there, like Dorothy Paul and Elaine C Smith.
Master of ceremonies for the night is Radio One DJ Nicky Campbell, a
former student of Aberdeen University, who started his career with
Northsound Radio. Hollywood screenwriter Alan Shiach, who is also
chairman of The Macallan whisky, is coming to present the award to the
best writer.    The British Academy of Film and Television Arts
established a Scottish base in the 1980s and looked around for a
director of international experience to run it. Linda Pearson fell into
their laps.
Having worked for Granada Television in Manchester and spent some
years in Canada, she had just moved to live in Scotland where her
husband was coming to work for Scottish Enterprise. She was tailor-made
for the part.    Since then the Bafta Scotland awards have taken over as
the industry's principal prize-giving night, held every two years, with
the intention that it should go the round of major cities.
It may be no coincidence that Bafta's presence in Scotland comes at a
time when things are looking up in the country's film industry. That
Hollywood stars like Mel Gibson and Liam Neeson should choose to portray
national figures like William Wallace and Rob Roy has given a boost to
our image which is currently riding high in the United States, where it
is essential these days to make an impression.
Apart from the glitter of those Hollywood-style premieres in Edinburgh
and Stirling this year, there was a very private but highly significant
dinner at which Mel Gibson sat down beside Scotland's new Secretary of
State, Michael Forsyth, who wanted to know what this country needed to
do to attract a properly established film industry.
At last, it seemed, the frustrated film people of Scotland had gained
the ear of an influential politician, one who is at least noted for his
determination to succeed.
In the circumstances, it is not without significance that Mr Forsyth
has already arranged to be present at Aberdeen's big night. Things could
well be moving.
After the razzmatazz of a right royal night at the Bafta awards in
Glasgow two years ago, it should have been Edinburgh's turn in 1995.
But, for all the facilities of the Festival City, Linda Pearson confirms
that she couldn't find a suitable venue, one that could feed 500 guests
and still leave room for the camera crews who need to move about the
auditorium.
''We looked at places like Murrayfield but it was always the dining
aspect which proved the difficulty,'' she says. ''Now, of course, they
have the new Conference Centre, which will come into the reckoning next
time.''
For the present, however, the focus falls on the Beach Ballroom,
Aberdeen, which nevertheless had to compete for attention with the
city's Music Hall and the large Exhibition Centre at Bridge of Don.
There is always a snag and the main drawback at the Beach Ballroom is
the sprung floor, where many of us, Aberdonians of another generation,
have danced to every visiting big band from Joe Loss to Ted Heath.
Terry Wolsey combines preparing for the big night with bringing up
three children in that seaside haven of St Cyrus, a popular colony for
media people.    ''For the Bafta night, we could have brought in people
who do award ceremonies all the time,'' she says. ''But we felt the job
should be done by Grampian's own personnel. And we are going to show
that we can glitter with the best of them!''

FATHER'S DAY
ALL seemed quiet and happy until we heard a wail from another room.
Then, in comes our son, distraught. Through the tears we learn that his
sister is dressing his Action Man. ''Were you playing with it?'' ''No.''
''So what's the problem?'' ''She's dressing him in her dolly's
clothes.'' So, once again, we find ourselves in one of those situations
which could make a good ''phone in your vote'' participation TV
programme. TV meaning television of course.
Today's question: in this situation would you (a) insist Action Man is
only dressed in men's clothes, condemn crossdressing as contributing to
society's ills and call in a good psychiatrist (for Action Man), or (b)
treat it as a perfectly normal and natural thing to do, thus implying
that you would accept your children swopping togs? By so polarising the
debate, a lively discussion ensues.
I have to confess that after seeing the poor bloke in bloomers
(''real'' men call them boxer shorts) and a summer dress, I christened
him Inaction Man. What a foolish thing to do in front of children. I'm
still avoiding a straight answer to the question: ''Why did you call him
that?''
I mentioned this episode to a group of friends recently. All of a
sudden the bar -- sorry, room -- was full of wistful looks as they
reminisced about their Action Men. Most recalled their mums knitting
costumes for him. What indignity! Some mums had made kilts, one
resourceful dad had made a sporran out of a bottle top. The discussion
regarding how Action Man has become less androgynous over the years is
best left aside. But we all agreed on one thing -- for boys, playing
with Action Man was quite acceptable; any other doll was not.
And most of our Action Men had suffered in similar ways to my son's at
the hands of sisters. Rumour had it that the manufacturers provided a
Helpline.
Undoubtedly, some toys appeal to both boys and girls, whereas others
are definitely genderspecific. My nonspecific research suggests that
boys are quite fixed in what they will and will not play with, whereas
girls have a much more relaxed attitude.
Action Man and his derivatives are targeted, through the militarisic
clothing and trappings, at boys. We tried to minimise the warmongery by
buying the diver, but even he comes with harpoon gun, knife and
''underwater explosives''.
Every boy who has been to our house thinks this is just great. Girls
just see another, interesting, doll, and the implements of death and
destruction are largely ignored. Our son would never contemplate playing
with Polly Pockets, but it is quite a different matter with Mighty Max.
His sister enjoys both, although she perhaps prefers the furry creatures
of the former to the gruesome aliens of the latter.
Me, I just marvel at the successful marketing, and wonder: why didn't
I think of selling a few pence worth of coloured plastic for several
pounds, and get away with it?

The family that knows together: Deedee Cuddihy goes in search of the
perfect source of wisdom
AS a journalist, I've occasionally been tempted to invest in a set of
Encyclopaedia Britannica. But as a parent, the temptation is even
stronger. Think of all that knowledge in your own home. Imagine your
child, streaks ahead of everyone in the class, first past the post with
those projects on Pompeii, the Vikings and Hadrian's Wall.
But even if you could stump up the necessary #1438 (#4000 for a set
with goatskin covers), where on earth would you put those 32 volumes?
So what is there for the parent whose budget, shelf space or
inclination doesn't run to the largest encylopedia in the English
language who, nevertheless, wants a decent work of reference which
could, preferably, be used by the whole family?
The answer is: plenty. In fact, there are so many single-volume
encyclopedias available now that choosing one won't be easy.
And before we go any further, better get the business of the spelling
of encyclopedia out of the way. Britannica which was founded in
Edinburgh more than 200 years ago, sticks with the traditional a between
the p and the e version but most of the one-volume encyclopedias
available in the shops these days go for the Americanised spelling.
In terms of words bought per #1 spent, you'd be hard-pressed to beat
the five-volume Wordsworth paperback encyclopedia which is on sale at
the new publishers' outlet store, Works, at the corner of Sauchiehall
Street and Hope Street. You get 1.7 million words, 2400 pages, 200
photographs and 300 drawings and maps for #9.95.
The Wordsworth claims to be just the job for ''home, school, college
and library'' and boasts of biographical entries for hundreds of famous
people from Leonardo da Vinci to one of the big daddies of American
rock'n'roll, Little Richard.
Well, any old encyclopedia will list Leonardo but Little Richard? That
seemed like the benchmark to aim for.
John Smith &amp; Son on St Vincent Street have such a wide variety of
encylopedias in both the adult and children's sections that choosing one
could be a bit of a nightmare. Perhaps an assistant might be able to
recommend one?
''Picking an encyclopedia is a very personal thing,'' a member of
staff told me kindly but firmly, pointing out that typeface and print
quality also had to be taken into account. ''My advice to you would be
to use that table over there and have a good look at whatever books you
feel might be suitable.''
The selection at Smith's included the rather lack-lustre Collins'
paperback encyclopedia at #9.99 with 988 pages and entries not only for
Little Richard (in the L's) but Cliff Richard (under R) as well.
The Guinness Encyclopedia at #35 looks good but is hard to use because
it's arranged according to themes rather than alphabetically. (Richard
Long, the actor was in but I could find neither Cliff nor Little.) There
was also a compact, less attractive paperback version at #9.99 with 512
pages.
The Hutchinson Encyclopedia, 1996 edition at #39.95 has Tony Blair on
the cover and claims to be ''the best-selling one-volume encyclopedia''.
I can understand why. It has 26,000 entries including both Cliff and
Little Richard and its 2000 illustrations, maps and photographs make it
look very attractive.
Smith's also had the Hutchinson's Concise at #20 (Little Richard but
not Cliff), the Popular at #14.99, the large Pocket at #7.99 and the
smaller Pocket at #5.99 for 565 pages which with its fascinating tables
on cinema, book and other awards, I thought excellent value despite
having no entries for Little Richard or Cliff.
The Macmillan Encyclopedia (1996) at #24.99 for 1336 pages and 1.5
million words comes highly recommended by Magnus Magnusson but is
sparsely illustrated, looks dull and while it was the only volume to
award Cliff his sir-ship, makes no mention of my original benchmark.
Smith's children's department had the Kingfisher Encyclopedia
(recommended for seven to11-year-olds) in both one volume (#25) and 10
volumes (#79.99) including sturdy box, and although one reviewer
describes it as ''a life-changing gift'', I found myself drawn to the
Dorling Kindersley (also at #25) where the topics are arranged in
alphabetical order (cars, castles, circuses) -- with a whole page on the
history of Scotland -- and the layout and illustrations are, in my
opinion, more exciting.
Both publishers do either concise versions or picture book-type
volumes for younger children and Kingfisher also has a pocket
encyclopedia at #4.99 which has lots of illustrations and looks good
value for money.
In a class of its own is the eccentric (eight pages on cricket and a
page on the finger spelling alphabet) Pears Junior Encyclopedia at
#12.99 which looks incredibly dull and old-fashioned but would probably
come into its own on a long train journey.
As if books aren't enough to be getting on with, encyclopedias are
also available these days on CD ROM. The selection at Smith's included
Compton's at #69.35 ''. . . complete contents of a 26-volume
encyclopedia . . . the keys to unlimited knowledge . . . watch the look
of wonder in a child's eyes . . .''
Waterstones as well as having some of the same range as Smith's, also
had the Cambridge Encyclopedia at #29.95 which although not as visually
attractive as the Hutchinson, is written in a slightly zippier style and
has more lines on both Cliff and Little Richard.
There is also a concise edition at #17.95 with lots of interesting
tables on popes, kings etc.
The Penguin Concise at #10.95 is even duller than the Collins'
equivalent at Smith's.
The Dillon's choice included the Collins Gem Encyclopedia at #5.99
which, being broken up into annoying non-alphabetically arranged topics,
has little to recommend it apart from size.
Dillon's had the Cambridge paperback at #9.95; the Macmillan compact
paperback at #9.95; the Macmillan concise at #16.99 with useful, glossy
coloured maps and flags of the world; the incredibly dull Longman
encyclopedia at #27.95 with Buddy Rich but neither Cliff nor Little; a
Wordsworth single-volume paperback which is hopelessly laid out so not
even worth the dirt-cheap #2 asking price and a CD ROM version of the
Kingfisher children's encyclopedia for #88.13.
The Encyclopaedia Britannica is also available in a children's version
and on CD ROM. For further information, call the company's head office
on 0181 669 4355.

Victoria Freedman meets families of victims and discovers how they are
coping with the inconceivable
ANNEMARIE McGLOINE turned on the television and caught a scene from
Cracker. A young man was viciously stabbing a shopkeeper, plunging the
knife in again and again until his victim lay lifeless on the floor.
Horrified, Annemarie closed her eyes. It was too graphically violent,
too true to life.
She quickly changed the programme but although the scene had only
lasted seconds, it was too late. Like a video recording, a vision of her
father being stabbed to death five years ago was already playing in
front of her eyes. It is a picture she has learned to shove away,
although lately, with the trial of Rosemary West in the news, it has
been difficult.
''For any victim of post-traumatic stress, whenever there is a
trigger, like reading about a similar event in the newspaper, it's like
being back at the time when it happened,'' explains Ian Stephen, a
forensic scientist who works in Glasgow. ''It reopens all the anxieties
and stresses, almost as if the actual event was taking place again. It
can be really harrowing.''
Annemarie was 24 at the time of the actual event. She had returned
home from the cinema to find the family home in Tollcross cordoned off
and surrounded by police. It was, is, hard to believe what had happened.
Her brother, then 27, had been to the local pub for a drink after work
and was punched in the face by a man in his forties who was clearly
drunk and intent on picking a fight. Her brother had left the pub,
followed by the man who yelled that he would get help and kill him.
Annemarie's parents and her 20-year-old sister, Angela, were asleep in
their beds when he let himself into the house. Minutes later, like a
scene from a movie, the man, accompanied by two men and two women, were
smashing the glass in the front door, and after kicking it down, were in
the hall, shouting and brandishing knives.
Annemarie's father, James, 58, who had come downstairs to discover the
cause of the commotion, had time to ring the police before being stabbed
to death by the man who had punched his son.
''They even tried to stab my sister,'' says Annemarie, still
incredulous. ''She and my mother had to run for their lives to a
neighbour's house. But they might as well have murdered us all. The
family died along with my father that night.''
Murder. It's the sort of thing that happens to others, she
acknowledges.
''Never for a minute would my father have imagined that three men
would come to his house and murder him. He thought he was in the safest
place he could be. At home. Now I don't feel anywhere or anybody is
safe.''
There have been more than 100 murders in Scotland this year and
Annemarie welcomes the new anti-crime policies put forward by Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth, proposing tougher sentencing and minimal
remission.
''The man got a so-called life sentence. In three years' time he could
be getting prepared to leave prison. It makes me so angry. It's the
families of those who have been murdered who have been given life
sentences.
''They are left feeling so guilty. Maybe the last time they saw their
loved-one they said something they wish they hadn't. Parents of murdered
children just feel guilty that they're alive. There are no happy,
special times any more. Couples separate; they just can't come to terms
with their own grief.
''People confuse murder with normal death but it's more horrific. I
don't think you can ever get over it. I know a woman whose child was
murdered 20 years ago. You'd think it happened only recently.''
Even if the families of murder victims learn to cope with their shock,
anger and grief, many are prevented from trying to get on with their
lives as they are pestered by the families of offenders, resentful that
their relatives have been imprisoned. And there are daily triggers.
''I listen to the radio all day so although I avoid reading about the
West trial I hear the details in the news and it makes me feel sick. I
know people have a right to know but it brings it all back. I don't know
how the victims' families are coping.''
Hopefully they will be receiving professional help. Ian Stephens
points out that after a disaster such as Lockerbie there is an inbuilt
support system for those with post-traumatic stress disorder, but
relatives of murder victims suffer similarly and need the same help.
Annemarie says there is none, at least none that is free, and if left
without treatment, people may never learn to cope with their loss.
It is a fact known only too well by Margaret and Jim Watson. They set
up a support group, Families of Murdered Children, after their
16-year-old daughter, Diane, was knifed to death in the school
playground four years ago by another pupil.
''Every day you think about what you could have done to prevent it,''
says Jim, 45. ''Diane was never involved in fights. When she said a girl
at school was annoying her I just said stay away from her. I didn't
expect the girl would come into school with a big knife in her bag.
''After it happened, four of her pals carried Diane to the house
because we live so close to the school. She was wearing denims, and a
white T-shirt. It was saturated in blood. I tried to resuscitate her but
the damage was too severe. I felt rotten that I'd done a first-aid
course but I couldn't save my daughter's life.
''I went with her in the ambulance while neighbours looked after
Margaret because she was hysterical. A nurse gave me a cup of tea, then
a doctor came in to say Diane was dead. I was like a zombie. Nothing was
clear, nothing was real.''
Like Annemarie, whose sadness washes over her pretty features, there
is no life in Jim's eyes. His voice is leaden, his hurt beyond reach.
''Afterwards we thought our son, Alan, was all right. He was going out
with his pals, he had a girlfriend, he was smiling. But after a while we
could see he wasn't coping. But he didn't want to talk to us because he
didn't want to upset us. We didn't ask for professional counselling for
him. We begged. But there's no help for the victims' families. They're
just forgotten.
''One Saturday morning, 18 months after Diane died, I was at work and
Margaret tried to wake Alan up. She thought he was just being lazy. His
body was still warm. Then she realised he wouldn't wake up.''
After Diane's death, Margaret had been given anti-depressant tablets
by her doctor, her son too. In a fatal cry for help, the 16-year-old had
swallowed them all.
Jim gave up his job at a hospital that day and has not been able to
work since. The couple, now childless, spend their days moping around
their home in Dennistoun.
''There's no point in life,'' says Jim. ''You just wake up in the
morning, realise you're awake and try to get through the day.'' As they
watch the West trial reports on the television news, it does not bring
back their pain. That, says Margaret, is there constantly. It is the
victims' families they think about.
''If Rosemary West is convicted you'll hear she's unstable and needs
help not punishment,'' says Margaret, 46, a shell of a woman, with a
pale, haunted face. ''But who's helping the victims' relatives? I have
no doubt that if Alan had received professional counselling he'd be
alive today.
''We have to feel sorry for prisoners and their conditions. They want
a proper menu. But what about the victims' families sitting at home. We
don't eat properly, maybe a roll and egg twice a day. We seldom sit down
for a cooked meal. We don't do anything we used to do as a family.''
Margaret believes a trained counsellor should be available from the
outset to guide relatives through the ordeal of a trial, often their
first time in a courtroom, and help with subsequent problems from loss
of earnings to coping with grief.
The least of her wishes is that professional counsellors would come
forward and voluntarily offer guidance for running the support group
before a similar tragedy hits one of the other 75 families who meet once
a week to talk through their feelings and keep the memory of their
relative alive.
''People walk about smiling but they're empty inside,'' says Margaret.
''I have suicidal feelings all the time. It's a constant mental battle
with myself. If we didn't have the group we honestly wouldn't be here
because that's the only thing that keeps us going. That's our family
now.''

Red tape, lack of co-operation, and huge debts are strangling the
United Nations. Ian Bruce investigates the survival chances of an
organisation set up 50 years ago amid high hopes, but unrealistic
expectations, of maintaining peace worldwide and now in need of a rescue
operation on its own behalf
THE United Nations will celebrate its 50th anniversary tomorrow facing
a crisis of purpose and credibility which threatens to be terminal. Five
decades after it was formed as protector of world peace, the
organisation is bankrupt, bereft of ideas for effective reform, and
bowed down by the weight of its own bureaucracy.
Behind the three-day bun-fight marking its birthday lies the stark
realisation that some way has to be found to cut through the red tape
and streamline both humanitarian aid and peacekeeping operations. The
alternative is closedown and an inglorious end to commendable purpose.
The UN is a series of bizarre contradictions. On the world stage, its
efforts are hampered by a democratic process involving 185 member states
who seldom reach agreement on any single issue, and never quickly. The
time delay between debate, consensus and action frequently renders that
action useless.
At local level, many of its offshoot agencies providing aid have
become mini-kingdoms, run dictatorially by those in charge and
answerable to no higher authority. It is a recipe for corruption.
Millions of vitally needed aid dollars are squandered or siphoned off to
personal bank accounts every year.
There is little the UN can do to prevent it. The diplomatic necessity
is to keep governments sweet, wheedle cash and manpower from them, and
maintain an ostensibly even-handed and politically correct stance. But
it means that certain appointments, particularly from Third World
nations with a tradition of backhanders and nepotism, are open
invitations to graft and patronage.
Moves are now under way to produce accurate and honest annual
assessments of staff in the various agencies. However, it remains
difficult to dismiss offenders unless their crimes are too blatant to
ignore. Much time is also wasted in juggling accounts to keep the
secretariat's employees paid.
More than $300m has been transferred from this year's peacekeeping
account for that purpose at a time when the budget itself is more than
$3000m in the red. By the end of December, the UN will owe more than
$1200m to countries contributing troops to its peacekeeping missions
worldwide.
Its permanent Security Council, the muscle and supposed intellectual
mainstay of the organisation, is an anachronism dating back to the end
of the Second World War. To the victors go the spoils, and to the
victors went the seats with the power to veto any resolution which might
interfere with their own Cold War agendas.
While the world moved on, the Big Five -- the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, and China -- have become increasingly isolated from the
real issues affecting most of the rest of humanity. Developing nations
are now asking, ever more stridently, why they should be excluded from
real decision-making or left vulnerable to having their own wishes
overturned.
The entire shooting-match is based, rightly and necessarily, on
equality of opinion. The democratic imperative dictates that Equatorial
Guinea has an equal voice to that of America. But it remains equally
true that the UN is dependent on the resources of the major players for
any effective activity against poverty, natural disaster, or military
aggression.
When the big powers are in agreement, something happens. When they are
not, the UN is paralysed. Pik Botha, South Africa's former Foreign
Minister and a keen supporter, compares it to ''a company that can't
market its own products, and whose board members put their own interests
first''.
Israel's respected statesman Abba Eban, whose country came into
existence only because of the UN, goes further. ''Failure was built in
by an extraordinary orgy of exaggerated expectations. The assumption
back then was that the world was one, that nationalism wasn't going to
count, and that world community was going to prevail.
''By 1945, it should have been understood that none of these things
was true. It's marvelous how long it went on before anybody woke up to
the fiasco. But in the end, the idea of world community is going to
succeed. All the UN can do for now is to dig in its heels and bide its
time. There are issues on the boil with which no single government can
deal. The UN's time will come.''
Others are less optimistic. Sir Anthony Parsons, British ambassador to
the organisation from 1979 to 1982, says: ''The UN has been a disastrous
failure in the field of universal human rights. It set the standards and
adopted conventions on everything from women to torture to the
protection of children, and then did nothing to enforce them.''
The avalanche of paper and resolutions which were merely so much sound
and fury is one of the primary reasons for the current dilemma. The UN
issued 82 separate resolutions on Bosnia alone. It took American resolve
and Nato firepower to begin to sort out a problem which had, by then,
cost 250,000 lives. It was a patent and embarrassing failure for UN
diplomacy.
Rwanda was another classic and tragic example. When Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali called last year for international help to halt
the massacres there, he was greeted with stony silence. The tribal
bloodbath which followed killed perhaps 500,000. A handful of nations
threw money at the problem in the aftermath. A brigade of well-armed
troops might have been more effective in the first few weeks.
The ill-considered intervention in Somalia's endless clan wars was a
turning point for the United States. It was arguably Washington's first
truly humanitarian effort this century, free of strategic sub-plots or
economic considerations. But the mighty US Army was given a lesson in
savagery by the local militia. The bodybag factor came into play after
18 US Rangers were ambushed, slain and their bodies mutilated.
The ambush prompted US withdrawal, set the seal on determination to
avoid committing ground forces to Bosnia, and coloured the White House
and Senate's attitudes to shelling out endless cash for UN intervention
overseas.
Yet the UN's very existence has saved countless millions of lives. It
is not entirely a story of frustrated expectations and outright
failures. Its medical programmes have all but eliminated malaria and
smallpox in areas once devastated by the diseases. More than 30 million
refugees of wars and famines from the Adriatic to the Horn of Africa are
alive today because of food aid and self-help agricultural programmes.
The Secretary General has now proposed a dedicated, rapid-reaction
military force capable of being deployed to areas of tension at short
notice. As few as 10,000 well-equipped and well-trained soldiers might
be sufficient to prevent ethnic tension being converted into all-out
conflict.
The Danes have offered a 5000-strong brigade. The Canadians have
volunteered a headquarters staff ready to fly to a trouble spot within
48 hours. Nobody else has shown any interest. It would be too expensive.
It would tie up vital resources which might be needed at national level
elsewhere.
The UN was set up in an era of state-v-state warfare. Its remit and
constitution makes it difficult to intervene in the spate of civil,
religious and ethnic conflicts which have become the true legacy of the
end of the Cold War. Many member states would not permit it. Many
others, like Nigeria, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia
are among the worst offenders in the field of human and civil rights
within their own borders.
It is unlikely, given the lack of unanimity and the even more
distressing lack of willingness or ability to meet their dues, that any
permanent force will be established in the near future. Yet peace
enforcement rather than peacekeeping is the name of the game in an era
of instability.
The answer on a regional basis may be sub-contracting the job to
organisations such as Nato in Europe and the Middle East, and to similar
bodies in the Pacific and Asia. The question of who foots the bill
remains thorny.
The UN should not be allowed to wither. But it needs a drastic
overhaul of its staffing, several of its agencies and its outdated
constitution. Abba Eban's discerning analysis is probably accurate.
Perhaps the international community expected too much, forgetting that
without their active co-operation, it could achieve little.
It may also need to concentrate on new targets which demand
international attention. Drug-smuggling, the rise of organised crime,
effective policing of environmental rules are three basic examples.
Above all, if it survives the next, turbulent few years, it must
continue to pursue basic famine and disaster relief in the Third World.
The number of poor is increasing. Energy resources are becoming fewer.
Future wars may well be triggered by want rather than territorial
imperatives. On a not-so-happy birthday, the UN still has a key role to
play.

Jack McLean, with a foot in both cabs, examines a Glasgow plan for
hackneys-only which has infuriated the private-hire sector
A CONTROVERSIAL proposal to ensure that only black hackney cabs will
be permitted in Glasgow's city centre has angered the 2400 private taxi
drivers who ply their trade in the city. A recently created organisation
looking after the interests of private cabs, the Greater Glasgow Private
Hire Association, has reacted furiously to the idea, from Strathclyde
Regional Council's roads department, that they should be, like other
private cars, excluded from the city centre.
Traffic problems have become increasingly acute in Scotland's largest
city and over the years many solutions have been suggested. A few years
back one of the proposals was to split the city centre into four zones
into which no car, outside of a public-transport vehicle, could
penetrate.
This was regarded as absurd, with crossover traffic causing even more
snarl-ups. But Glasgow District Council, and Strathclyde region too,
have been coming up with what are seen as clearly untenable so-called
solutions to the traffic build-up for many years.
This latest proposal would seem doomed to failure also, even though
the opportunity for ''black cabs'' to win back their former monopoly
will be attractive to hackney owners, many of whom have serious debts
due to the cost of purchasing a cab, and even more for what is
euphemistically known as ''goodwill'', a system stemming from just after
the Second World War by which cab licences could change hands for as
much as #30,000.
Recent years have seen that sum reduced to as low as #12,000. The
introduction of private cabs, with simply the cost of a car rather than
goodwill, heralded a new influx of taxis.
Most of the ''private taxis'' charged a great deal less than the
hackneys. And the recession, with many workers being dealt out thousands
in redundancy payments, allowed many more private taxis into the market.
Today there are some 1400 hackney cabs on Glasgow's streets. And nearly
2400 private-licensed cabs.
Two decades ago a taxi, at least in most parts of the United Kingdom,
was a black hackney cab: squat, rather uncomfortable for both driver and
passengers, recognisable, and, well, black. The growth of the industry
in private taxis, that is to say ordinary cars plying the taxi trade,
has been considerable in the past 20 years and this has led to
considerable resentment among those in the ''black hack'' trade. Partly
their fault as well, the black hacks. They did overcharge, having a
monopoly in the old days.
The hackneys had a point in their objections to what they called ''the
pirates'', many of whom were unlicensed at one time, with drivers often
signing on and working at the same time.
Other objections which they were justified in having included the fact
that many of the privates were insufficiently insured, and that some of
the drivers concerned were out-and-out villains. Some of those who are
called ''mini-cab'' drivers in London, are positively dangerous, and
there have been a number of assaults, and indeed rapes, carried out by
mini-cab cowboys.
And recently there have been allegations that Glasgow drug barons have
been attempting to launder their vast and illegal incomes through taxi
companies which they have been trying to buy up. There have also been
accusations of intimidation.
Yet the private taxi drivers pay the same licence fee as black cabs,
#126, and the same sum of #50 for a badge. The privates are also
subjected to regular inspections, sometimes as often as three times a
year, at #24 per inspection.
Many ''privates'' claim that they don't get passed first time round
(and certainly the inspections seem somewhat severe with cars not being
passed for such faults as a cigarette burn on the back seat and other
trivial concerns). In fact, the privates claim that they actually pay
more for their plates, as they require two small plates as well as the
larger one on the back. And this is where the problem seems to be.
In a confidential letter from Strathclyde roads director Donald
Carruthers to the private-hire companies, it was stated that ''Unlike
taxis, private-hire cars are not easily identified and could be mistaken
for general traffic. Enforcement would not be practical . . .''
Later Carruthers states: ''The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982
clearly states the difference in function between taxis, which are
permitted to be engaged by arrangements made on the public highway, and
by private-hire cars. I do not therefore accept that private-hire cars
carry out the same function as taxis''.
This is more than disputed by the private-cab drivers, and, if one
turns to the dictionaries, with some reason. A taxi is described in
Chambers as: ''A taxi-cab, loosely any motor car on hire. A cab
furnished with a taximeter.''
The difference between a hackney cab and a private-hire taxi is that a
hackney can pick up on the street whereas a private cannot. With the
introduction in many private-hire companies of computerisation this
system can actually be safer for a passenger in that the car and its
driver can be identified at any time, even long after the journey.
But is there a difference between a black cab and a private taxi in
reality? The suggestion that a private cab cannot be identified seems
hardly to hold water. No other country in the world has black hackneys:
elsewhere normal cars are used and indeed in much of Europe top cars
such as Mercedes are most commonly authorised as taxi-cabs.
As David Brown of the private-hire association put it: ''Why not have
a bloody great badge on the front window, or even, as they have in many
places in the world, a large sign on the roof reading 'TAXI'. And what's
going to happen if we ban all private cars from city centres? Doctors
and health visitors?
''We would like to dissuade people from taking their cars, often
pointlessly, into the city centre. Why not have drivers, like doctors
and social workers and the like who need to be mobile everywhere, make
their own justifications.
''Or even charge for those who insist on using their cars in busy town
and city streets. But we are public transport, just as much as trains
and buses and black cabs too.''
''You use both blacks and privates,'' he continued. ''Do you not still
want the choice?'' I admitted it. I do. Just a touch of sympathy for the
hackneys, though. Also a dictionary definition: ''A hackney: a person
hired for drudgery.''

A SCOTTISH local authority today will launch a marketing initiative at
a major international conference in Israel Borders Regional Council's
business crusade to Jerusalem will present its Buyer's Guide to Hi-tech
Industries to around 700 EU delegates and almost 300 Israeli companies.
Councillor Andrew Tulley, leader of the delegation, said yesterday
that the intention was to make contact with EU and Israeli firms to
nurture and encourage business links.
He said the high concentration of electronics and computer-related
companies at Medpartenariat Israel 1995 offered an excellent opportunity
to launch the buyer's guide.
''It's a marketing tool that provides all the necessary information on
the dynamic and innovative companies from our hi-tech sector, so vital
to the Borders economy.''
The drive has been welcomed by businessmen. Mr Sam McEwan, of the
Scottish Electronics Forum, said the initiative in promoting Scotland's
electronics industry in this way was to be commended.
Mr Alistair Brearley, managing director of Galashiels company Ass-Tec,
believed some might find Israel an unusual location for such an event
but there were excellent opportunities in hi-tech fields and the
conference was ideal for raising awareness of what the Borders had to
offer.
The guide gives details of 36 local companies operating in
electronics, computers, and software as well as support and training
facilities available.
It was part financed by the European Regional Development Fund. An
intensive distribution campaign in Europe, Japan, China, and North
America is under way.

THE Liberal Democrats have been put on standby by leader Paddy Ashdown
for a snap General Election.
Yesterday, he agreed a campaign with senior MPs in London to woo back
wavering voters. The campaign will involve Mr Ashdown in a series of
rallies across Britain over the coming months.
The Lib-Dem move follows Labour leader Tony Blair's tour of the
country, which began in the summer. Now the leaders of all three main
parliamentary parties will be touring the country this autumn.
A Liberal Democrat source said: ''Paddy will be telling the party the
General Election could come at any time, with the falling Government
majority. So we have decided to redouble our efforts.
''We are determined to keep the Government on the run on key issues.''
Liberal Democrats also feel the time is right to exploit public
disquiet about lack of accountability among Ministers.
The party's Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce MP added: ''We stand firm
on our pledge to fight tax cuts unless the Government agrees to put more
money into education.''

DRIVERS in Glasgow are being offered some of the lowest priced petrol
in Britain, a national survey has found.
The study, by the Press Association, appears to bear out the fact that
a major price war is under way in Central Scotland, as reported in The
Herald on Saturday.
PA carried out random samples of four filling stations in each of 10
regions in the UK, and found Glasgow to be the cheapest.
Typically, motorists were charged less than 50p for a litre of
unleaded petrol in the city, with most stations selling four-star at 53p
or 54p. That compared with prices in excess of 60p in Northern Ireland.
Among the cheapest prices at the weekend were at a Safeway branch in
Newlands, in Glasgow's South Side, where unleaded was listed at 45.4p
and four-star at 52.9p.
PA said that by shopping around, drivers could save as much as #300 a
year.
Oil companies set a maximum and minimum price at the level the market
can take but it is up to individual filling stations to set the price.
Both the AA and RAC declared the battle could only be good news for
motorists.

SPENDING at tourist attractions in the UK topped #1000m for the first
time last year.
A survey by the UK's four national tourist boards showed that
improvements at well-established attractions and the arrival of new
tourist sites had helped the 1994 spending figure increase by 5% over
1993.
The top UK attraction charging admission last year was Alton Towers
theme park in Staffordshire, which had 3,000,100 visitors and spent #12m
on new facilities. In Scotland, the top attraction charging admission in
1994 was Edinburgh Castle, with 992,000 visitors.
Alton Towers increased its lead over Madame Tussaud's waxworks museum
in London (2,630,000 visitors in 1994) and also over the Tower of London
(2,400,000).
In Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was followed by Edinburgh Zoo, with
526,000 visitors, and Deep Sea World in North Queensferry with 436,000.
While it performed exceedingly well in Scottish terms, Deep Sea World
also came a highly creditable third in the top 20 UK attractions opened
between 1990 and 1994.
The top country park for the UK was Strathclyde Country Park with
4,300,000 visitors.
Mr Graham Birse, PR director of the Scottish Tourist Board, said the
gap between Edinburgh Castle and Alton Towers was explained by the
number of potential visitors on their doorsteps.
He said: ''Scotland will always be disadvantaged with English
attractions such as Alton Towers because they have many millions of
people within a 100-mile radius of them. There is nowhere in Scotland
that can achieve that density.''
Mr Birse said it was very encouraging to see Deep Sea World getting
into ''the premier league''.
''Although we have historic attractions, Scotland has few private
attractions with a contemporary flavour such as Deep Sea World, and we
would like to see more emerging.''
For anyone thinking of setting up a visitor attraction, it was
important to remember that local enterprise companies could offer them
financial help to develop their ideas, he said.
Mr Birse also welcomed the fact that the Rob Roy and Trossachs Centre
in Callander had come 20th in the premier league of newcomers with
176,000 visitors.
The 5% increase in spending at tourist attractions in 1994 helped
offset a total downturn in revenue for the industry in Scotland of 10%,
he said.
However, he added: ''There has been a dramatic recovery in the first
six months of this year, where figures show an increase in revenue in
the order of 15%.''
Elsewhere in the UK, London Zoo, which was saved from closure by
Middle Eastern money, saw a 21% increase in the number of visitors
(1,040,000) while extended opening hours and new galleries helped the
National Portrait Gallery in London to rise 71% to the same total.
There were also big rises in the number of tourists to Stonehenge,
Windsor Castle, Blackpool Tower, and Thorpe Park in Surrey.
People were only too glad to ''go through customs'' as the ''Anything
to Declare'' Customs and Excise National Museum in Liverpool attracted
312,000 visitors in its first year.
The top free admission attraction was once again Blackpool Pleasure
Beach (7,200,000). In Scotland, the leading free admission attraction
was Kelvingrove Art Gallery, with 903,000. In second place came the
Royal Botanical Gardens and third the Royal Museum of Scotland, both
Edinburgh.
There were 387 million visits to tourist attractions in 1994, which
was 2% up on the 1993 figure.
Almost three-quarters of the visits were accounted for by just six
categories -- historic properties (79 million visits), museums (60
million), country parks (57 million), leisure parks (40.5 million),
wildlife attractions (23 million) and art galleries (20.5 million).
Elsewhere the survey shows:
* The average adult admission charge in 1994 was #2.32. Prices ranged
from #1.72 at museums to #5.47 at leisure parks;
* For the fifth year running, farm attractions achieved the fastest
growth rate in visits -- up 6% to 8.3 million;
* Overseas visitors accounted for 19% of all visits to attractions in
1994;
* Children make up 32% of all visits and prefer trips to farms and
leisure parks rather than gardens and workplaces;
* An estimated 89,100 are employed by UK tourist attractions, with the
help of 55,000 volunteers;
* The average number of annual visitors to leisure parks was 533,000
and total visits to these parks were up 3%;

JOURNALIST and playwright Keith
Waterhouse led the tributes yesterday to Sir Kingsley Amis
''He has a very high place in literary history,'' he said. ''I don't
think there will be another Kingsley.
''He was a great storyteller, although he was much more than a
storyteller.
''He will be badly missed at the Garrick Club, where he become an
absolute fixture in the last few years. I will remember him with great
affection.
''He was a curmudgeon but we all knew it was an act. It was very
enjoyable,'' he said.
Novelist and journalist Auberon Waugh, 56, said of Sir Kingsley: ''He
will be much missed and he will be remembered as a curmudgeonly figure.
There is nobody like him left from that generation.
''He did not give a damn what other people thought about him and he
said what he thought.
''He was a big man in a small world of self-regarding people.''
Novelist Malcolm Bradbury, emeritus professor of American studies
attached to the University of East Anglia, had known Sir Kingsley since
the publication of Lucky Jim in 1954.
A few years ago, he adapted Sir Kingsley's novel The Green Man for a
television series starring Albert Finney.
He said: ''He was someone who had an absolutely flying start because
he was such a wonderful writer from the beginning.
''He was a very powerful figure of his generation and preceded the
'angry young men'.
''Lucky Jim was the novel of a new generation and new culture. It was
about the old Bloomsbury group and the new welfare state generation and
the difference between them.
''He was writing in a new and fresh way -- it's a great comedy. He
absolutely captured the tone of the times.''
Melvyn Bragg, controller of arts at London Weekend Television and
presenter of LWT's South Bank Show, said Sir Kingsley's ''funny and
scalding'' writing had dominated most of the last 50 years.
''He revelled in the tradition of English literary comedy and loved
the past as much as he enjoyed lashing out at what he saw as a modern
world gone to seed.
''He was one of the masters of comic fiction and he will be badly
missed.''

ONCE in a televised debate with John Pollock, I made a total cod of
myself. John was furious and I possessed the sort of guilt which takes
you into foetal positions in your bed of a night, moaning.
I sent a letter to the then general secretary of my union, the EIS,
with a line from Burns about the hounds of alcohol and guilt. He sent me
a lovely wee parcel two days later, when his fury had subsided. There
was a miniature of whisky and a note: ''A hair of the dog, Jack'' it
read.
There was fury in John, often enough with me, but more often with
fools which he never quite got round to suffering gladly. When John
retired, I wrote a wee piece about him. I pointed out that you could
never make up your mind if John was a saint for us teachers, or a devil.
Except one thing: nobody else could lead like John. He was the Jock
Stein of Scottish Labour politics: the Big Man.
Even when he retired he had the stature and aura of a statesman.
I fought John tooth and nail; we fell out politically many a time. I
sometimes won an election but I never won an argument with him. He came
from one of the great Ayrshire dynasties of working-class politicians
and I like to think I understand these nobles of democracy. Certainly we
had Burns in common.
I have lost a splendid old enemy. Ach, we never fell out that much
after the drams were passed round. Respect crosses a lot of divides.
There are no divides, at the end of the day and a life, in admiration.

SIR KINGSLEY AMIS, who died yesterday aged 73, was a lion of the
literary establishment and virtually unchallenged as Britain's foremost
man of letters.
His first book, Lucky Jim, written in 1954, has been hailed as the
funniest novel in the English language.
His prolific output of novels, essays, and poems have gained him a
devoted and massive readership. It was widely said of him that he was
incapable of writing a boring or unintelligible sentence.
However, he also had a reputation as an irascible old man with a
weakness for hard drinking and a relish for misogyny.
For his millions of admirers, however, Sir Kingsley was more than just
a fine writer. He represented, as well, something in the national
character: scepticism, honesty, a bitter hatred of pretension, and a
distrust of arty posturing.
His status, towering above all other contemporary writers, earned him
his knighthood in 1990. More than once the quotation from Henry V was
applied to him: ''There is nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness
and humility'' -- although it was sometimes hard to understand why.
Sir Kingsley developed from a clamorous communist undergraduate across
the political spectrum to become a growling Tory diehard, or, as one
commentator put it, from being an angry young soak to an angry old soak.
He was never slow to denounce others as fools and bores and his
resentment of almost anyone in authority remained unchanged throughout
his turbulent adult life.
Behind all that there lay a tremulous neurotic who, in adolescence,
was subject to inexplicable fits of terror. Even as an adult, he could
not bear to be left alone at night, travel alone in a train, or fly in
an aeroplane.
He suffered from hallucinations and uncontrollable twitchings and
undertook psychiatric treatment, seemingly to little avail, but he
possessed a prodigious appetite for work, always fiercely determined to
produce his daily 500 words.
Amis was born in south London on April 16, 1922. His father was a
clerk with Colman's, the mustard company. He was inordinately proud of
his lower middle-class roots and was upset when his City of London
school was evacuated to Marlborough in 1939. He served in the Royal
Signals during the Second World War.
As a junior lecturer at Swansea, he and his wife Hilary, whom he had
married in 1948, were so poor that she got a job as a waitress and
brought home scraps for him to eat under the pretence they were for the
dog.
His fellowship at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1961, improved his feeding
arrangements but he always felt awkward among the highbrow dons and
retaliated with what was described as ''drunken boorishness''.
Once he turned up at a formal reception in drag, an act fuelling
suspicion -- which he fervently denied -- that he was homosexual.
Indeed, in one poem he wrote that ''women and queers and children'' cry
when things go wrong, whereas men just soldier on with ''rueful grins
and curses''.
In 1964, he left his wife and three children -- including Martin Amis,
the novelist -- and eloped to Spain with novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard,
whom he married the following year. That marriage was dissolved in the
early 1980s.
Sir Kingsley became a major figure in the literary world after his
leap to fame with Lucky Jim, published when he was 32.
This was the start of a torrent which provided the blueprint for the
modern comic novel. There were to follow more than 20 novels and six
volumes of verse..
After Lucky Jim, Amis's books tended to get darker and deeper, to the
disappointment of his earlier readers.
In his Memoirs in 1991, Amis, who appeared even to his admirers to be
unequalled as a cantankerous old cynic, surprisingly unbuttoned his
emotions to share with his readers his phobias: fear of the dark, of
being alone, of the London Underground, and of flying.
His line on South Africa was the antithesis of political correctness.
He regarded Nelson Mandela as a Communist terrorist and predicted that
his new regime would be a disaster because ''if you are a stupid black
-- like many of them are -- you won't think you have to work because
you've been promised a car and a house''.

An APPRECIATION
THE last time I saw Kingsley Amis was a few months ago, over lunch at
the Garrick Club, where as usual he was acting the professional
curmudgeon to the delight of his circle of friends. It was hilarious to
watch -- but rather sad.
In recent years, Sir Kingsley's lunchtimes, rarely cordial, had become
more and more baleful. He was a seasoned disapprover -- the only person
he seemed genuinely to admire was Mrs Thatcher, who gave him the
knighthood, and about whom he claimed to have erotic dreams.
Most of his disapproval he reserved for the young, the trendy, and the
left.
As the conversation got round to the subject of his work, I took pains
to convey how much I enjoyed and admired its incendiariness.
Sir Kingsley narrowed his eyes: it was as if he was holding back from
physical assault on a reader supposed to be a trendy and a lefty, which
is indeed what many of his readers have always been.
Raconteur and raisonneur, in his art as in his personal life, Amis was
a concealed author who was evident enough in his hotly opinionated
fiction. He was the first Angry Young Man who was much admired in the
early fifties for writing Lucky Jim and for belonging to The Movement, a
group of writers who appeared to be rebelling against the class-bound
romanticism of wartime literature.
Amis and Philip Larkin and one or two others did constitute a real
movement forward. They were intelligent people writing in a comic way,
without the stuffiness and hideboundness of the previous generation.
Amis delivered the news: life went on outside the upper class.
In the following decade, Amis developed into an important comic
artist. Like Henry Fielding, Amis practised a form of comic stylisation
and farcical exaggeration that was nevertheless true to the nature of
the society it described. His fiction did not distort.
Ironically, the author seemed to think that the Swinging Sixties
contained a readership that would be trouble or shocked by his novels'
candour and scabrousness about sex, while the young would receive it as
an account of what they were up to.
In other words, Amis was solicitous in trying to alleviate the shocks
by explaining that the novelist himself was shocked. In fact, it was
clear, and is clearer still in retrospect, that on a number of occasions
an old decorum had been deferred to, or embraced.
Unlike many of his novel-writing predecessors, Amis was also a very
good poet, and a very good critic. He was a very good drinker, too,
although his taste for alcohol did not obstruct his comic genius. Indeed
his most successful novel -- in commercial terms at any rate -- was The
Old Devils, which won the Booker Prize in 1986 for its matchless
evocation of a writer's separation between his friendships and politics,
his life -- and his art.
Amis's work is art all right. It has the sui generis of art. It has
art's power to translate, to abstract from the circumstances in which it
originates. There is no biographical key with which it can be unlocked,
though it is worth pointing out that the novelist who ended up dreaming
of Mrs Thatcher first impinged on the scene in the 1950s as a democrat.

THE former general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland,
Mr John Pollock, died at the weekend while on holiday in Majorca with
his family. He was 69.
Tributes poured in yesterday for a man who not only transformed the
EIS into one of the country's strongest trade unions and steered it
through a period of unprecedented industrial unrest, but also played a
leading role in the wider union movement and in the Labour Party in
Scotland.
Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish Secretary, described Mr Pollock
as a ''giant'' of the Scottish Labour movement who had made a ''truly
immense'' contribution to the Labour Party, to the trade unions, and to
Scotland.
''He was a pioneer of the devolution cause and as twice-serving
chairman of the Scottish Labour Party kept up a relentless and
consistent pressure for home rule for his beloved Scotland. He
deliberately chose not to follow the often-offered parliamentary route
and also resisted all the other temptations which would have removed him
from his native land.
''He was a brilliant political and trade union strategist and
transformed the EIS into a formidable and modernised trade union force.
John Pollock was a man who selflessly served Scotland and the Labour
movement with a distinction and prominence which will leave a permanent
mark.''
Mr Pollock was born in Kilmarnock in 1926. He was educated at Ayr
Academy, the Royal Technical College in Glasgow, Glasgow University, and
Jordanhill College of Education.
He began his teaching career in 1951 and was rector of Mainholm
Academy in Ayr from 1965 until 1974 when he became general secretary
designate of the EIS, taking up the office the following year.
By then, he had already long established himself as a prominent figure
on the political scene. He twice served as chairman of the Scottish
Labour Party, in 1959 and 1971.
After taking the EIS post, he became a member of the general council
of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and was STUC chairman in 1981-82.
Despite his strong links with the Labour Party, the then Labour
government quickly learned when he took over the helm of the EIS that
his first duty would be to his union members.
Although he was a personal friend of Willie Ross, then Secretary of
State for Scotland, Mr Pollock was soon leading a schools strike to
apply pressure for the early publication of the Houghton Report on pay.
There were to be further disputes under the Conservative government,
most notably a three-year campaign of industrial action in the
mid-1980s.
But throughout all this unrest, the EIS went from strength to
strength. By the time Mr Pollock retired in 1988, the union's membership
had risen from just over 50% of the teaching profession in Scotland to
80%, and it had become the largest purely Scottish affiliate of the
STUC.
His abilities were recognised in the worldwide teaching community and
he held leading offices in several international bodies, including the
World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession. That
body later honoured him with the Russell Award for his service to
education and international understanding.
Mr Pollock served in many other areas of public life, including the
Forestry Commission, the Manpower Services Committee Scotland, the
Employment Appeals Tribunal, and the National Broadcasting Council for
Scotland.
Fred Forrester, formerly organising secretary and now depute general
secretary, worked closely with Mr Pollock.
Mr Forrester said last night: ''John Pollock was first and foremost a
moderniser. During his general secretaryship, the EIS was transformed
from a very traditional, head-teacher dominated, professional
association into probably the most effective trade union in the UK.
''In this process, John was assisted by external events. The 1970s saw
the EIS become affiliated to the STUC and the TUC, with John becoming an
influential member of the general council of the STUC. It was also a
period of great teacher unrest over pay and conditions of service.
''The Houghton and Clegg Reports were influenced by John and
represented the greatest advance in the salary structures of teachers
since the Second World War. As far as conditions of service were
concerned, John and I worked together in the work-to-rule campaign of
1973-76 which led directly to the first Scottish teachers' conditions of
service contract. That contract substantially exists to the present
day.''
Mr Forrester continued: ''However, John's greatest moments came during
the 1984 campaign for an independent pay review. This campaign lasted
for three years and led to the Main Report and a further salaries
improvement for teachers.
''It was a period of quite exceptional activity including strikes and
sanctions against examinations. There was the ever-present danger that
Scottish teachers would lose the support of the parent body and of wider
public opinion. That this never happened was due in large measure to
John Pollock.
''He knew everyone's strengths and weaknesses and used this knowledge
day in day out.''
Mr Pollock, who lived at Longniddry in East Lothian, is survived by
his wife, Joyce, son Gordon, and daughter Carolyn.

spokesman said. The Transal military plane, which had stopped to refuel
on a routine flight from Germany to Canada, exploded after taking off
from the Azores' main airport at Punta Delgada.

DHAKA: A 35-year-old Bangladeshi had his penis chopped off while
trying to rape a neighbour's wife, police said yesterday. The
30-year-old woman gave the severed penis to police near the port of
Mongla and told them the man had slipped into her hut while her husband
was away. ''I first planned to feed it to my ducks but later changed my
mind,'' she said.

ALGIERS: A car bomb killed eight people and wounded 82 in the west
Algerian town of Relizane yesterday, security sources said. The sources,
quoted by Algerian radio, said among the eight dead were three children,
aged six, nine and 12 years.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the army-backed
authorities have blamed Muslim fundamentalists fighting to topple the
government for many earlier attacks.

THE Dean of Rouen University spent the night of Thursday to Friday
locked in his offices by protesting students. The Rouen train service,
too, has been experiencing difficulties on account of hundreds of the
same, protesting students, staging sit-ins on the tracks.
Behind the demonstrations is the fact that the government-funded
budget of Rouen's science faculty -- whose students have been on strike
for a fortnight -- is over #1m short, and no-one know hows it will
muddle through the academic year.
Protests in Rouen have in turn inspired unrest in Toulouse, where 300
mathematic students demonstrated on Thursday, demanding the creation of
100 extra teaching jobs. At Nanterre, near Paris, 200 science students
blocked local trains the previous week to protest against the shortage
of teachers, overcrowding and outdated equipment.
Student protest was a cherished tradition in France even before the
riots of May 1968 nearly unseated General de Gaulle. There have been
many student causes and demonstrations since and each government is wary
of the disorder they can bring.
France's Education Minister Francois Bayrou held the same job with the
former government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who ditched his
own ambitions for university reform when they were still at a white
paper stage in February 1994, after tens of thousands of students
demonstrated throughout the country and paralysed Paris with a
succession of protest marches.
In depth reform of education was nevertheless one of the main election
pledges of President Jacques Chirac.
''We must create a fairer statute for students, one which is more
generous than the current system of allowances, grants and loans,'' he
said.
That promise was reiterated by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who
instructed Bayrou, shortly after his appointment five months ago, to
improve library facilities and living accommodation in universities and
define ''a more complete and fairer statute'' for students.
Sorting out the #3000m spent on grants for the country's 2.2m students
-- more than half the budget of the Ministry of Higher Education -- let
alone embarking on a reform of the country's overpopulated, chronically
underfunded universities, is a nettle which Bayrou and the government in
general are understandably reluctant to grasp.
The government is due to modify a #250 monthly lodging allowance paid
to the families of students, regardless of their income, who live away
from home. Critics of the system had wanted a fairer, means-related
allowance.
But frightened by the possibility of student protest, and with the
demonstrations in Rouen as a glaring reminder of just how volatile
French students can be, the government backed off. For similar reasons,
it also abandoned a major feature of its promised fiscal reform by
deciding not to abolish a number of largely anacronistic income tax
allowances from which a number of professions benefit.
The government would doubtless argue it is taking a step backwards, as
the saying goes, the better to leap forward. Last summer, a 23-member
commission was set up, presided over by a former teacher and former
Socialist Industry Minister Roger Fauroux, to examine every aspect of
educational reform. It is due to produce its findings in a white paper
next summer. Those conclusions, President Chirac promised, could be
followed, in the grandest Gaullist tradition, with a referendum.
Embarrassingly, Bayrou said he was opposed to such a process and the
commission is cautiously sitting on the fence.
Opening a science faculty recently in a new university near Paris
which presumably, unlike Rouen has enough money to survive until June,
Bayrou announced that he, too, would be leading a nationwide
consultation ''to prepare the university of the 21st century''. He
intends, in other words, to interview as many people involved in
education as possible before embarking on any reforms, the first of
which, at best, may be implemented in a year's time.
To bewildered voters, not to mention striking science students in
Rouen, it may sound like much hot air. Yet the government's record is
increasingly one of contradiction and hesitation. President Chirac's
only bold move to date has been to resume nuclear testing and cause
long-term diplomatic damage, if not worse, in the South Pacific.

Singapore
A BRITISH fugitive accused
of three gruesome murders in two countries has one more day to
persuade a court of his innocence.
John Martin, also known as John Martin Scripps, faces the death
penalty in Singapore if convicted of murdering a South African tourist
in their shared hotel room on March 8.
He has also been accused of killing and dismembering two Canadian
tourists on the Thai resort island of Phuket.
Martin, 35, is expected to make his final appearance on the witness
stand when his trial resumes on Tuesday. He was cross-examined for most
of last week after being the only witness called in his defence.
The remaining cross-examination is expected to take about a day.
Martin will then return to a bullet-proof glass box in the back of the
courtroom while both sides make their final submissions. A verdict is
expected in early November.
Since the trial began on October 2, prosecutors have tried to depict
Martin as a cool, methodical predator who murdered tourists to steal
from them.
The hacked remains of South African Gerard George Lowe, 32, were found
in bin bags in Singapore harbour in mid-March. The skulls and other
severed body parts of Canadians Sheila Mae Damude, 49, and her son
Darin, 22, were discovered in shallow graves in Phuket the same month.
Martin was found carrying passports and credit cards of Lowe and the
Damudes --as well as knives, handcuffs and a powerful electrical stun
device -- when arrested at Singapore's Changi airport on March 19.
In his long-awaited testimony last week, Martin portrayed himself as a
struggling entrepreneur who ran into some bad luck while on a business
trip to Asia.
Martin twice absconded from British prisons while serving time for
heroin trafficking. He failed to return to the Mount prison in
Hertfordshire after being granted a three-day weekend home leave in
October 1994. There was a similar incident in 1990 at a different
prison.
Martin has admitted killing Lowe but said it happened in a burst of
fear after a homosexual advance by Lowe. Earlier, Lowe's widow testified
her husband was not a homosexual.
Martin claims a British friend got rid of the body and then demanded
money for his help. He said it was the same friend who gave him the
possessions of Lowe and the Damudes. Martin denies killing the
Canadians.

Hyderabad
INDIA'S cricket team captain Mohammed Azharuddin, facing Muslim wrath,
denied today that he wrote the Prophet's name on unholy footwear while
modelling for Reebok and apologised to Muslims.
''I have signed a contract with the Reebok company, but I haven't
autographed or signed on the shoes,'' he said in a statement faxed to
newspapers from Bangalore, where he was staying after India played New
Zealand.
''If I have hurt the feelings of the Muslim fraternity, I apologise
for the same,'' said the cricket star, who describes himself as a devout
Muslim.
The Urdu language press in Hyderabad, a southern city with a big
Muslim population which is Azharuddin's home town, erupted in anger
after the Rahnuma-e-Deccan newspaper carried a photograph of him
autographing Reebok shoes on October 14.
Reebok launched designer shoes endorsed by Azharuddin in India earlier
this month and plans to open 55 showrooms across the country by 1997 to
sell its products.
Many Muslims felt the cricket star should not have put his name --
which includes the Prophet's name and ''Azhar'', an appellation for
Allah (God) -- on shoes, which in the Islamic religion are considered
lowly and unholy.
The newspaper was flooded with angry letters and telephone calls.
Azharuddin told reporters last week that he had only initialled the
shoe, not signed it, which would tally with his faxed statement today.
But this was not acceptable to some Muslims. ''Even if Azharuddin has
signed it in his initials, it should be condemned,'' said Urdu poet
Aliuddin Naveed.
''Azhar's intentions cannot be doubted. No Muslim can insult his own
religion,'' said Naser Kurnooli, a college teacher.
''It is unfortunate that Azhar, a pious Muslim, has landed himself in
trouble,'' said Humera Parveen, a female fan.
The cricketer was travelling today from Bangalore to Madras, where
India's cricketers are due to play another match against the visiting
New Zealanders.
Azhar, as the 32-year-old player is called by fans, was the darling of
the many Muslim inhabitants of Hyderabad where he was a favourite at
Islamic functions.
The controversy appeared to blunt the impact of his victory over New
Zealand last week. He was declared man of the match as he led India to
triumph for the eleventh time in test, or international, cricket
matches.
''Azhar is no longer a favourite with the Muslims now due to his
changed attitude to life,'' Fazil Hussain Parvez, author of the
Urdu-language biography Cricket ka Shahzada (Prince of Cricket), told
Reuters today.
Azharuddin has said he is ready to review his modelling deal with
Reebok.
''I really feel hurt that such a controversy has arisen,'' Azharuddin
was quoted today by the Asian Age newspaper as saying. ''When I signed
the deal, I did not anticipate that it was bound to raise such feelings.
''I am equally concerned about religion. As a devout Muslim, I have
the highest regard for the Almighty and the Prophet,'' he told the
Deccan Chronicle newspaper in Bangalore.
''I appeal to the people concerned to stop this campaign as the issue
will be settled soon.''
Azharuddin's father, Azizuddin, earlier apologised on behalf of his
son.--Reuter.

Larnaca, Cyprus
A SHIP carrying 271 Palestinians expelled from Libya left Cyprus today
for Syria, ending their 10-day ordeal during which they were stranded
off the Cypriot coast in a car ferry.
A tug towed the Syrian-owned Fayza Express out of Larnaca port, its
fog-horn sounding and its decks packed with men, women and children
chanting and dancing to drums.
Shipping agent George Georgides told Reuters a second Syrian vessel,
the Al Assad, would arrive here later tonight to collect over 341
Palestinians remaining on the Greek-owned Countess M who have Syrian
papers.
The Palestinians were part of the 30,000-strong community that had
lived in Libya for decades until leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered them to
leave in August, ostensibly to punish PLO chief Yasser Arafat for his
peace deals with Israel.
Holding up a large picture of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, the
Palestinians chanted ''Syria is our national pride'' and ''Long live
Assad'' as Fayza Express embarked on its 11-hour voyage to Syria.
They were watched by a subdued crowd on the two-tier deck of the
Countess M. Apart from those with Syrian papers, the 650 passengers
included Palestinians with Jordanian papers as well as Moroccans and
Algerians.
According to Jordanian newspapers, Interior Minister Salamah Hammad
has told Jordan's honorary consul in Cyprus to arrange for the
Jordanians to fly to Amman.
Cyprus Communications and Works Minister Adamos Adamides was confident
that the rest of the Countess M's passengers would be out of Cyprus
soon.
The Countess M had been anchored off the Cypriot coast and when it
came into Larnaca dock police sealed off the area.
First mate Costas Costantopoulos said the crew had signed a petition
today telling the captain they would not put to sea again with the
Palestinians as it was too dangerous.
The Palestinians had stormed the ferry's kitchen last night and
started hurling plates and trays at the staff apparently in protest at
the poor food.
The Syrian ship had taken nearly 30 hours to reach Cyprus after being
dogged by engine problems.--Reuter.

Sarajevo
THE guns finally fell silent in Bosnia today, but the Big Powers were
still at odds over formation of an international force to police a
peace.
Both the UN and the Bosnian Serb Army reported that fighting in
northwest Bosnia, which had threatened to derail a 10-day-old truce, was
halted a result of talks on Friday between rival commanders.
The truce was designed to smooth the way to full peace talks starting
in the United States on October 31.
With hope growing by the day for an end to 42 months of war, a
delegation from world financial institutions visited Bosnia's battered
capital today and assessed the cost of rebuilding it at billions of
dollars.
But while the situation on the ground was improving, the United States
and Russia had not reach agreement on Moscow's role in enforcing any
peace settlement.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, after talks with his Russian
counterpart Andrei Kozyrev, acknowledged the difficulty of finding a
role for Moscow, which is wanted in the deal because of its historic
friendship with the Serbs but refuses to allow its troops to serve under
Nato command.
''I think it's important to find an appropriate dignified role for the
Russians in connection with the implementation,'' he told reporters, but
added he did not expect a decision at a US-Russian summit in New York
tomorrow.
Earlier, Christopher ruled out a proposal for Russian troops to police
the Bosnian Serbs while the US supervised Bosnian Muslim areas, saying
this would create harmful tensions.
US President Bill Clinton told world leaders attending the UN's 50th
anniversary that prospects for peace in Bosnia were brighter than ever
before.
Clinton said that if the warring factions succeeded in achieving peace
at the forthcoming talks, ''the United States will be there with our
friends and allies to help secure it.''
Clinton faces problems however with Congress, where members of both
parties question the wisdom of sending 20,000 US troops to the
multi-national peace force.
Defence Secretary William Perry insisted today that Nato would unravel
if the US balked.
The self-styled vice-president of the Bosnian Serb republic, Nikola
Koljevic, told a local Serbian radio station that Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic was presenting unacceptable demands.
He objected to proposals for stronger central rule, formation of a
Bosnian central bank, and elections in Bosnia as a whole rather than in
separate Serb, Muslim and Croat entities.
In Sarajevo, a delegation from the World Bank, International Monetary
Fund, the European Union and the US Agency for International Development
discussed with leaders the reconstruction task ahead.--Reuter.

United Nations
CLASHES over Bosnia and Cuba marred celebrations of the United
Nations' 50th birthday today as leaders at the world's biggest ever
summit paid tribute, laced with criticism, to the global body.
Russia and the United States clashed over who should control future
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, Cuba's Fidel Castro said the UN had
become a front for a ''new colonialism'', and Japan and New Zealand
attacked France for nuclear testing.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman reminded the world that a recent
ceasefire in former Yugoslavia was fragile, threatening to retake
Serb-held Eastern Slavonia by force if peace talks fail.
Several leaders used their allotted five minutes at the podium of the
General Assembly to condemn the United States and other nations for
failing to pay their share of UN expenses.
''Some dozen parliaments hold this organisation hostage by withholding
their membership fees. How unworthy,'' said Norway's Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland, one of a handful of women leaders at the anniversary
celebrations.
US President Bill Clinton tried to deflect criticism, saying he was
working on a plan with the Republican-controlled Congress to ''fully
meet our obligations''.
Washington owes about 40% of the total UN debt of $3000m, and Congress
so far has refused to pay. Cash-strapped Russia is the second biggest
debtor.
New York came to a standstill as hundreds of policemen blocked off
streets so that the leaders could get to the UN on time for the
speeches.
Clinton kicked off the celebrations with a pledge ''that the United
States will be there with our friends and allies'' to help secure peace
in Bosnia if the combatants reach an accord during peace talks next
week.
But minutes later Yeltsin said Russia would only contribute troops to
a peacekeeping force if they were subject to a strict Security Council
mandate, directly opposing Clinton's move to have it commanded by Nato.
Clinton laid down a challenge to more than 150 presidents, kings,
prime ministers and dignitaries, calling for a global effort to combat
terrorism, organised crime, drug trafficking and the smuggling of
nuclear materials.
Castro, making his first UN speech in 16 years, cast himself as the
spokesman of downtrodden, small nations, demanding a democratisation of
the world body and railing against the big powers' veto right.
Without mentioning the United States by name, he directed many of his
barbs at Washington, its superpower role, military might and trade
embargo against Cuba.
''We lay claim to a world without ruthless blockades that cause the
death of men, women and children, youth and elders, like noiseless atom
bombs,'' Castro said.
Clinton kept well away from Castro during the celebratory photo
opportunities and at lunch, but Yeltsin demonstratively embraced the
Cuban leader.
Cuba was one of seven countries pointedly denied an invitation to a
reception hosted by Clinton tonight, along with Iran, Iraq, Sudan,
Libya, North Korea and Somalia.
''There are a number of nations whose invitations got lost in the
mail. The dog ate them. Woof,'' a senior US official joked.
While Clinton warned the United Nations that it must reform to remain
relevant in the 21st century, many other leaders praised the world
organisation for helping resolve conflicts from Cambodia to Namibia.
General Assembly president Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal said
reform was necessary but ''We must not allow this organisation to die at
the hands of its critics.''
Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasser Arafat summed up the
UN's importance this way:
''I came to you 21 years ago as a fighter for freedom, liberation and
independence, carrying with me the torments of my struggling people.
Today, I come to you with a heart filled with love and peace now that
the olive branch has adorned the peace of the brave . . . Good tidings
have been heralded. Help us to bring it to fruition.''--Reuter.

Berlin
GERMANY'S crippled opposition Social Democrats (SPD), now in the
throes of bitter leadership struggles, took a worse-than-expected
beating in state polls in their one-time stronghold of Berlin.
The SPD, an unstoppable political machine in Berlin when former
chancellor Willy Brandt was mayor in the 1960s, got a stunning postwar
low of only 23.3% of the vote in today's polls for the city-state's
legislature.
Rudolf Scharping, the lacklustre national chairman who failed to hush
his internal critics before the Berlin vote, is up for re-election as
SPD parliamentary leader on Tuesday. He is set to win but a tight result
could embarrass him.
He can now also expect a rough ride at the party's annual congress in
Mannheim next month. If he survives that, he could still be derailed by
three close state elections looming next March.
Scharping's main rival, Lower Saxony premier Gerhard Schroeder,
signalled in a defiant speech last Wednesday he would not heed the
chairman's calls for party unity.
The SPD's losses were especially heavy in east Berlin, where it
nosedived from 32.1% of the vote in the 1990 election to only 19.7%.
Much of this support went to the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS),
which has shed its aura as the successors of East Germany's hardline
communists.
The PDS, which won 36% of the vote to become the strongest party east
of the former Berlin Wall, has established itself as the voice of
opposition for easterners dissatisfied with the western-dominated
Germany in which they now live.
* Social Democrats in the Swiss government made historic gains and
far-rightists in the four-party coalition also won ground in today's
parliamentary election, according to the first national computer
projection.
Commentators said the projection by Swiss Broadcasting Corporation
SRG, based on partial results, meant divisions were deepening among the
Swiss over whether to join the European Union or remain neutral.
Europe was the main issue in a heated election campaign.
SRG said its tally of partial results from the 26 cantons, or federal
states, showed the pro-EU Social Democrats gaining 12 seats to hold 54
in the 200-deputy lower house of parliament.--Reuter.

LABOUR will not buy back
privatised British rail companies at any price if they win power at
the next General Election, Shadow Transport Secretary Clare Short said
yesterday.
In a clear shift of emphasis from her predecessor Michael Meacher, who
was moved by Mr Tony Blair last week, Ms Short said Labour would not buy
back every privatised piece of the rail system at the market price.
She said: ''We will certainly have the railways in public ownership,
no question. The thing we are not saying we will do is that we will buy
back any bit that has been privatised, at the market price, because we
have other priorities for our spending.
''Our overwhelming priority is to cut unemployment and encourage
long-term investment. So we will bring it back into public ownership --
the privatisation is way behind.
''We will regulate enormously tightly so that there won't be any big
profits in the interim while we arrange to bring back the bits that
might have been privatised into public ownership.''
Ms Short did not give details on how Labour intended to buy back
British Rail assets.
However, her remarks will be seen as a clear signal that Mr Blair does
not intend any return to old-style Labour renationalisation.
The options include buying back a controlling stake -- possibly as
little as 2% of shares if only 51% are sold -- or taking a controlling
''golden share'' option.
The main target will be Railtrack, the company which owns the track
and which Transport Secretary Sir George Young told the Tory Party
conference would be sold in the near future.
Ms Short warned there would be no windfall profits for the principals
of the privatised rail companies because the Labour Government would
regulate tightly.
''Part of that warning is the suggestion there is no point in buying
it and in the meantime we want to mobilise public opinion which
absolutely disapproves of this privatisation, which will make it really
difficult for the Government to privatise any part of it.''

THE sell-off of Dundee port for #18m has prompted the city council to
seek assurances from the new owner about its future plans, amid fears
that the port could be run down.
Leith-based Forth Ports beat off a rival offer from Caledonian Ports
Ltd -- a joint venture between the management and employees of Dundee
Port, and Clydeport plc.
Mr Iain Luke -- Dundee District Council's economic development
convener and chairman of the multi-agency Dundee Partnership -- has
written to Transport Secretary Sir George Young over the issue.
Mr Luke wants to know what safeguards were written into the sale
agreement with Forth Ports.
He has also called for an early meeting with Mr Hugh Thomson, the
chief executive of Forth Ports.
Councillor Luke said: ''We want to see the investment plans for the
port over the next 10 years.
''We are looking at the long term. The port is so vital to the
economic future of Dundee. We hope to meet Forth Ports in the next few
weeks.''

A NATIONAL register of parents whose children have been involved in
drug abuse was launched this weekend.
The register, which will form the basis of a network of support for
parents, was set up during the first annual convention of parents'
pressure groups against drugs.
More than 50 delegates attended the convention hosted by pioneering
Wirral group Parents Against Drug Abuse in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
PADA was launched in 1983 by parents whose children were affected by a
heroin crisis in the Wirral. Dozens of similar groups have since sprung
up in many parts of the country.
Chairwoman Joan Keogh, who launched PADA after members of her own
family got involved with heroin, has seen the group's efforts lead to a
series of anti-drugs initiatives on the Wirral.
Her work earned her an MBE in this year's New Year's Honours List.
''We formed PADA as a group of parents when our own children got
hooked on heroin and there was nowhere to go for help. We put pressure
on Wirral Council to do something about it and now Wirral is one of the
best -- if not the best -- authorities for helping drugs users come
off,'' she said.
PADA now has 600 members on the Wirral, where heroin abuse remains a
major problem. Mrs Keogh sees the role of parents as vital in saving
their children and grandchildren from getting involved.
The convention, sponsored by Lions International and Merseyside Drug
Prevention Team, aims to become an annual event held in different parts
of the country each year.
Mrs Keogh said: ''At the convention, we can all find out what is being
done in our own areas and get ideas from each other. Some of the groups
have only just set up and some are thinking of setting up.
''The theme of the convention is the way forward. Parents are the only
ones who are going to change the drugs scene -- the Government had been
trying for years but it wasn't getting any better, and we had to start

<HEADLINE>Egg-poaching bear threatens Solway goose gathering</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
ONE of Britain's great winter wildlife spectacles faces a new threat
-- from a polar bear 2000 miles away in the Arctic.
Nature lovers flock to the Solway Firth in south-west Scotland to
watch the gathering of barnacle geese which, as a result of conservation
measures, has grown from just 400 in the late 1940s to about 13,000.
However, scientists studying the birds' summer nesting colonies on the
Svalbard islands, midway between Norway and the North Pole, estimate
that 20% of breeding pairs have failed to rear any young this year
because a polar bear ate every egg in the 700 nests of one western
colony.
Now there is concern that if the bear makes a habit of returning to
feast at the expense of the geese, the population could decline steadily
-- especially as there are other problems looming.
Another colony's future is in doubt because a Norwegian mining company
wants to build a road through Svalbard's Reindalen valley, a major area
for the geese, to reach the site of a proposed colliery.
The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, which runs a refuge for the black,
white, and grey geese over coastal fields and marshes at Caerlaverock,
near Dumfries, is trying to assess how many have returned this autumn.
''Counts are still in progress but the initial impression is that
numbers are down,'' said Mr John Doherty, of WWT. ''Our hope is that
this summer's bear predation was just a one-off problem and the
population will recover.
''It was very unusual for a bear to be in the west of Svalbard during
the summer. If this became a regular occurrence, however, the colony
would inevitably face a long-term threat.''
Mr Doherty said the scientists discovered bear footprints leading to
the ground nests and evidence that eggs had been taken before hatching.
He added that barnacle geese, with a wing span of almost 5ft, were
able to defend nests and young from predators such as Arctic foxes but
had little hope of success against such a powerful adversary as a polar
bear.
''It underlines how, despite our efforts to conserve their winter
habitat, which has helped the population to increase, they remain very
vulnerable to natural catastrophes in their summer nesting territory.''
* A species of frog which is 10 times as large as the native British
common frog is threatening to alter radically the ecology of the UK, it
is claimed this week.
Many North American bullfrogs have been introduced into the wild
illegally, according to tonight's BBC1 Watchdog programme.
Although the bullfrogs eat a number of native amphibians, some garden
centres are encouraging customers to release the tadpoles into their
ponds as pets, Watchdog claims.
The RSPCA told the programme: ''We would like to see a legal
requirement on the retailer to be properly qualified, properly trained
to handle the species he's dealing with, and to inform the buyer of the
needs of the animals and also the buyer's obligations in terms of
looking after the animal and not releasing it into the wild.''
The bullfrogs, which can survive a British winter unscathed, eat
almost anything and live for up to 12 years.

AN uncompromising ''pay-up'' message to the United Nations -- and the
United States in particular -- concerning the millions of pounds Britain
is owed for the peace-keeping operation in Bosnia has threatened to
overshadow the 50th anniversary of the UN's founding.
Mr Major yesterday flew to New York apparently determined to read the
riot act over the late payment of the money, embarrassing President Bill
Clinton on his home turf.
The UN's 50th anniversary was marked yesterday by services around the
world including one in Scotland attended by Mr Alexander Borg-Olivier,
the UN Secretary General's personal assistant.
Local councillors and politicians were joined by European politicians
and former UN personnel and representatives of the Armed Forces for the
service at St Giles in Edinburgh.
Mrs Helen Liddell MP, the UN 50 Scotland chairperson, later addressed
a reception at the City Chambers given by Edinburgh district and Lothian
region.
At the Scots Kirk in Geneva, a leading Church of Scotland minister
told the congregation that the world could not do without the UN.
The Rev Andrew McLellan, convener of the Church and Nation Committee,
said ''the glorious possibility of the UN'' was the most ambitious
attempt yet to put into practice and structural form the classical
Christian virtue of loving your neighbours.
He said Christian theology made it clear that if nations, just like
individuals, were simply left to protect their own interests they would
always seek to do it in a way that could damage the interests of others.
''Because every nation has sinful tendencies in it we need the United
Nations,'' he said. ''Let the United Nations die and something uniquely
precious about human beings, created by God for each other, dies with
it.''
Meanwhile, British diplomats were hoping for a strong gesture from a
Clinton administration which finds its hands tied by Congress, where
anti-UN feelings are running high.
Total arrears now stand at #2400m, with 39 of the 185 members states
failing to pay their dues last year. The biggest share of debt by far is
the #1000m unpaid by the US -- the equivalent of the entire UN budget
for a year.
Mr Major is expected to use a speech to its General Assembly to press
for tougher penalties for non-payment, including interest charges on
arrears and the threat of the loss of lucrative UN contracts and jobs
and voting rights on decision-making.
Mr Major is also understood to be pressing for a slimming down of the
organisation to cut waste, fraud, and inefficiency.
Diplomats are said to be hoping to win US support for a British plan
to alter the complex way donations are worked out, with the aim of
reducing the burden on the US and the EU.
More than 145 heads of state and governments are descending on New
York in an operation stretching the city's resources to the limit.

<TEXT>
A MAN fell 300ft to his death from Blackpool Tower, at the weekend.
The tragedy at the famous landmark happened at about 5pm on Saturday
but details were not disclosed until yesterday.
A police spokesman said Mr Adrian Gannaway, 33, of Swindon, Wiltshire,
fell from the highest public area of the tower and landed on the roof of
the seven-storey building at its foot.
He was last seen climbing on to safety netting on the tower's
outermost edge, after saying he had lost his wallet.
There have been a number of deaths at the 518ft tower during its
101-year history but with improved safety measures it has been some time
since the last tragedy.
Police said there were ''no suspicious circumstances''.
Mr Roy Page of tower owners First Leisure said Mr Gannaway, who was
accompanied by his wife and children, would have faced great difficulty
climbing out on to the safety netting of the tower's highest public
access point.

DOCTORS are concerned about changes in services for women patients at
a Scottish trust hospital, it was claimed yesterday.
In particular they are angry that patients having miscarriages will be
nursed close to young mothers ''happily having their newborn''.
Dr Alex Clark, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Vale of
Leven Hospital in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, has attacked the Lomond
Healthcare NHS Trust's plan to close his specialist ward and to mix his
female patients with others coming into the hospital for different types
of operations.
He said: ''I maintain that the changes will seriously undermine the
quality of health care provision for women from Dumbarton and Argyll.''
Lomond Trust chief executive Stephen Hayes denies this and claims the
changes are in line with changing gynaecological practices throughout
the UK and designed to provide better care at more competitive costs
with no redundancies.
Dr Clark said: ''In fact, gynaecological colleagues in Scotland have
expressed their considerable horror at the proposed changes,
particularly the proposals that patients having miscarriages will be
nursed in close proximity to the maternity wing, where women are happily
having their babies.''
Dr Clark, who also works at Ross Hall Hospital in Glasgow, says the
changes are designed purely to achieve a higher throughput of patients
and bed occupancy rate at Vale of Leven.
He said: ''This 'rationalising' of the gynaecology service with what
is perceived to be a resulting reduction in the quality of care
available is not the answer.
''Patients having miscarriages require sympathetic counselling by
nursing staff and it is our concern that this facility will no longer be
available to these patients because of the increasing number of patients
going through a decreasing number of beds.
''If we are to move towards production-line care, where patients are
rushed in and out of hospital with almost undue haste, then I feel that
this excellent quality of care will cease to exist.''
Lomond Trust chief executive Stephen Hayes insists, however, that
although the change in admissions procedure for women will save money,
it will not affect the standard of care.

MIKE Biggar, one of Scotland greatest rugby players, was on honeymoon
yesterday with the woman who nursed him back to health after a car
crash.
Vet Alison Mead had cared for Mr Biggar after he had spent six months
in a coma following the accident on the A40 Cheltenham-Oxford road at
Barrington, Gloucestershire, more than three years ago.
The former Scottish rugby skipper suffered serious head injuries and
shattered his legs.
On Saturday, Mr Biggar, 46, walked down the aisle at Malmesbury,
Wiltshire, where the couple will set up home.
Yesterday, the former London Scottish flanker, who has been married
before, was celebrating his new-found happiness.
Mr Biggar, who walks with a stick, was brought back to consciousness
by recordings of his nine-year-old son George's voice.
Fellow rugby players have rallied round. A dinner at Twickenham raised
#32,500 to help Mr Biggar and he will receive part of the proceeds of a
similiar dinner at Murrayfield.
Earlier this month, Mr Biggar, who comes from St Boswell's,
Roxburghshire, said: ''I've found happiness after all the pain.''

A FATHER warned yesterday his disabled baby daughter could die unless
he could find a bigger house for his family.
Two-year-old Chelsey Austin was born with brain damage and is unable
to walk or talk.
Two weeks ago, the family had their benefit cut by #28 a week because
there was more than #4500, raised by members of the public, in a special
account.
Yesterday, the Austins learned the DSS had relented and restored their
cash, with a #143 back payment, after public criticism of the decision.
However, although Chelsey's parents Kevin and Teresa welcome the
decision, they say they believe their overcrowded council home in
Dingwall, Ross-shire, is to blame for their daughter's continuing
deterioration.
There is no room in the house for vital therapy and exercise
equipment, paid for by the Chelsey Austin Trust fundraising appeal.
Yesterday, a private housing agency rejected the Austins'
council-backed bid to take up tenancy in a five-bedroom house.
The Austins have to decide by Thursday whether to accept an offer of a
new home by a private landlord in Bedford-shire.
Bedfordshire Council has said it will contribute to the rent but Mr
Austin says he is angry that his family may be forced out of the
Highlands because Ross and Cromarty District Council cannot rehouse
them.
He is furious that the council has still not found alternative
accommodation for his wife and eight children almost a year after they
were first alerted to his plight.
Mr Austin said: ''I'm praying someone in the Highlands will step in
and offer the property we need for Chelsey.
''The way the council are talking, by the time they find us a house,
Chelsey will be dead. That is the truth. They are talking about six
months and that is just not an option.
''Chelsey has gone downhill without her exercises. She is very
unhappy. She is coughing all the time and being sick and does not look
lively any more. I am worried sick.
''If we do not find somewhere bigger, all of the fundraising, all of
the public's generosity, will have been for nothing.''
Stars like Wet Wet Wet, Rod Stewart, Paul Young, and Def Leppard
helped raise #10,000 for the equipment which could give Chelsey a chance
of leading a normal adult life.
Mr Austin said it had proved impossible to persuade many private
owners to house a family on state benefit.
He added: ''We may be a DSS family but that does not mean we are not
respectable. We are model tenants and, even with eight children, our
house is spotless.
''As far as the local authority is concerned, I find it incredible
that a council way down in England will help us out but our own has done
next to nothing.
''I still have faith that the people of the Highlands have big hearts,
and hopefully our situation will change before Thursday. If not we will
be forced out of the region. It will be a traumatic move for my other
children, who are Highland born and bred.''

A NEW air service between Prestwick and Belfast is to be stepped up
following record passenger figures.
Gill Airways is to introduce a fourth flight each Monday and Friday
and a later Saturday service geared to football fans visiting Scotland
for the day.
The Newcastle-based airline started from the Ayrshire airport to
Belfast City in July and has seen passenger figures soar to 5000 for
October.
Figures released this weekend by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
indicate tourism to Northern Ireland from the Republic has risen by more
than 200% since the IRA ceasefire more than a year ago.
The news is a further boost to Prestwick, which has seen a steady
growth in its scheduled services to Dublin and which this week will
introduce a service to London Stansted in conjunction with Ryanair.
Gill Airways offers flights to Belfast from #29 one way, with free
rail travel to the airport from any station in Scotland and back.
Mr Paul Weir, sales manager for Ireland, said: ''Our new service has
caught the imagination of travellers at both ends who may have
considered using ferries and not aircraft to travel between Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
''We are confident that business will continue to grow and the route
is already outstripping our existing service between Newcastle and
Belfast.''
Tourism chiefs throughout the province are working to boost the
markets throughout the UK and Europe as the peace dividend continues to
show itself.

THE Queen will fly for the first time on a commercial flight next
week.
The decision to share a plane to New Zealand with fare-paying
passengers will save taxpayers an estimated #400,000.
Normally the Queen flies in a Royal Squadron aircraft or charters a
long-range jet.
However, mindful of the high cost of international travel, she has
accepted a recommendation by the New Zealand Government to travel on a
scheduled flight.
Nevertheless, the Air New Zealand service to Auckland, via Los
Angeles, will be no ordinary flight.
A team of 16 engineers will transform the Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet's
first-class section into a cabin fit for a Queen.
The 16 first-class seats will be replaced with a table, four
armchairs, and two beds.
The beds, used by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh when they
charter a British Airways jet, are being loaned to Air New Zealand for
the occasion.
The first-class area is normally taken up by 16 people, each paying
#6352 return.
The Queen is embarking on a Royal tour of New Zealand, culminating in
the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Auckland.
The 24-hour journey includes a 90-minute stopover at Los Angeles,
where the Queen is due to leave the plane and will be entertained in LA
International Airport's VIP lounge.
She will be accompanied by senior members of the Royal household, who
will travel business class in the jumbo's upstairs ''bubble'' section.
The Duke of Edinburgh will arrive in New Zealand ahead of the Queen
from South Africa, where he will attend the World Wide Fund for Nature's
annual meeting.
The only tickets available to members of the public on Flight NZ1 will
be economy class at #982 each.
Food served to the Queen on the marathon journey will be the usual
first-class in-flight catering.
There will be no plastic cups and trays for her. She will eat from
fine china with silver cutlery and drink from crystal glasses.
A typical dinner would include an appetiser such as filo pastry filled
with scampi, mushrooms, and leeks, served with a crayfish sauce, or a
fresh vegetable soup.
Main courses might include medallions of lamb, breast of braised
guinea fowl, or an Indian-inspired vegetarian choice. Dessert could be
apple pancakes or chocolate ice cream.
The estimated #200,000 bill for the return flight -- the duke will fly
back with the Queen -- is being picked up by the New Zealand Government.
It is customary for a host Commonwealth nation to pay for the Queen's
travel when she visits as head of state.
New Zealand taxpayers may be forking out #200,000 but the new Royal
mode of travel represents a saving of around #400,000 on the cost of a
jumbo being chartered for the Queen's exclusive use.

A RARE glimpse of the splendours inside the Royal Family's holiday
retreat at Balmoral was given yesterday to the public and the press.
For the first time, the Prince of Wales invited members of the media
into the castle as part of a private function, where he offered his
praise and support to Scotland's mountain rescue teams.
The public are allowed into the estate grounds to view the majestic
castle and its gardens before the Queen takes up residence for her
annual summer holiday.
Access inside is extremely restricted, with only one door into the
grand ballroom open for the 100,000 visitors who flock to Deeside every
year.
Yesterday, however, nearly 200 guests were allowed in to the ballroom
through a side entrance, revealing some private rooms, including the
Queen's equerry's office.
This pine-decorated room just inside the side entrance is used by
royal staff organising the Queen's public engagements during her stay at
Balmoral. It features maps of the 50,000-acre estate and drawings of
former members of the Royal Family.
The tartan-covered hallway leading to the ballroom is lined with royal
portraits and priceless antiques and furniture. There is also about a
dozen doorways to private rooms.
The ballroom -- where the Royal Family still hold ceilidhs and family
parties during their summer holidays -- is decorated on each wall with
deer antlers and drawings which hang below small balconies at each end.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said Prince Charles had decided to
allow press into the private holiday home as part of his thank-you
reception to rescue teams.
The prince, dressed in jacket and kilt, spent more than an hour
chatting to guests while enjoying one of his favourite tipples -- a
glass of malt whisky. He heard tales of bravery from representatives of
Scotland's 24 mountain rescue teams.
To show his appreciation, the prince presented the Scottish Mountain
Rescue Committee with a new #19,000 Land Rover Defender donated by the
Rover Group.
Prince Charles then chatted to guests on the lawns outside the castle
before retreating to his private quarters.
The prince, who attended nearby Crathie church with the Queen Mother
earlier yesterday, is expected to leave Balmoral in the next few days at
the end of his summer holiday.

* LABOUR'S Scottish health spokesman and union officials have demanded
the sacking of a private firm from a multi-million pound catering and
cleaning contract at a Scots hospital if complaints about them prove to
be true.
Mediguard has been running catering, cleaning, and portering
operations at Royal Dundee Liff Hospital for only three weeks.
Already workers have filed a catalogue of complaints about what they
claim are ''filthy'' kitchens, ''poor quality'' food, and the way that
staff have been treated by management.
Scottish Labour health spokesman John McAllion, MP for Dundee East,
said: ''The numerous complaints I have had from staff at Liff Hospital
about Mediguard justify an immediate suspension of their contract
pending an urgent independent investigation.''
Mr McAllion declared that if the complaints are proved to be true
''then I firmly believe that Mediguard should be sacked and the contract
brought back in-house.''
He added: ''Dedicated staff are utterly appalled at the hygienic
standards of the Mediguard service and by the manner in which they as
staff are being treated.''
A spokesman for Dundee Healthcare NHS Trust said that contracted-out
services were monitored by trust officials. He added that allegations
about dirty kitchens were ''totally inaccurate.''
Mediguard chairman Mr Dennis Stopford refused to comment at the
company's London headquarters.

A HEALTH board was told yesterday to rethink its plans to close a
hospital for the profoundly mentally handicapped.
Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton ordered Grampian
Health Board to reconsider the planned closure of Woodlands Hospital,
Aberdeen, which is managed by Grampian Healthcare NHS Trust.
The board had approved a trust plan to rehouse some of the 70
residents at a special unit at Aberdeen Royal Cornhill Hospital and
release others under the Government's Care in the Community scheme.
The plan sparked a campaign by relatives concerned that the Royal
Cornhill was not a suitable option since it houses mentally ill and
dangerously disturbed patients.
Yesterday, Mrs Josie Burnett, chairwoman of the Friends of Woodlands
campaign group, said: ''The main thing for the parents is that we will
not be going to Cornhill. That is a major obstacle we have overcome.''
Mrs Burnett, who has a son at Woodlands, said she and other parents
would now play a full part in drawing up new plans for the hospital's
future.
She stressed that the 70 residents left at Woodlands were long-stay
patients for whom care in the community would not be possible.
''When the proposed closure was first announced 18 months ago,
Woodlands was just in uproar, the parents were beside themselves.
''We had them coming to see us weeping, and phoning at 10 o'clock at
night but that has all settled down and at least we have now achieved
something.''
Another campaigner said: ''We are not quite rejoicing yet. This is
only a first step but a very significant one.''
Lord James said he had studied all the views put forward before and
after the formal consultation period for the closure plans.
He said: ''I was not convinced that the proposals to re-provide
hospital services for people with learning disabilities in the grounds
of the Royal Cornhill Hospital were the right way forward.
''Grampian Health Board and Grampian Healthcare NHS Trust have agreed
that the board should review planning proposals for this very vulnerable
group of patients.
''Its aims should be to examine all the options for providing modern
community care for the whole of the Grampian area, whilst paying due
regard to any specialist medical needs of this group.''
Grampian Healthcare chief executive Jeremy Taylor said he felt the
original proposal was the best option available at the time to meet the
specialist needs of the Woodlands patients.
He said: ''The new review has a much broader region-wide remit,
looking at the development of all community-based and hospital care for
this vulnerable group.''
Health board chairman Dr Calum MacLeod said he welcomed the review and
understood the concerns of parents.

YOUNG families were warned yesterday they must prepare now to meet the
care costs of their old age.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell said Ministers were looking at ways
of helping but made it clear individuals would be expected to meet at
least some of the costs of residential care.
The Government faces a growing number of complaints about family
homes, which children might have expected to inherit, having to be sold
to meet the care costs of one or both parents.
Mr Dorrell, interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record, pointed out that
the state now picked up ''a dramatic share'' of the elderly care bill
compared with 15 years ago.
Then, he said, there were queues for local authority homes but the
rapid expansion of the private sector meant there were now no waiting
lists and the state paid all or part of the bill for those who could not
afford the cost.
Such costs were ''a burden'' for which many families might need to
prepare now, he said. ''The Government is now looking at how we can
ensure that families will prepare for what is a significant risk that
will come to all of us at the end of our life,'' he said.
''There are many families who are surprised at this obligation which
comes late in life.''
He said he believed individuals should accept responsibility for their
own care.
Ministers have not yet decided how to curb the cost to the public
purse as the percentage of pensioners in the population continues to
grow.
Tax incentives to take out insurance are under consideration, as is
raising the savings limit that pensioners can keep once state aid is
provided.
This might include discounting at least part of the sale value of a
family home so that children could inherit something if not the full
amount.
Mr Dorrell said standards in most private homes were higher than in
many local authority ones and higher than those in NHS geriatric wards
to which many elderly people used to be sent.
He said the Government's priority had to be to ensure the British
economy remained competitive against those of emerging Third World
countries. Otherwise Britain would not be able to sustain the level of
public services people expected.
Claiming that the proportion of national wealth taken by Government
was on a downward trend, he said the immediate task was to take the
share below 40%.

SIR David Frost said yesterday that Hugh Grant had ''expressed an
interest'' in playing the lead role in a film about Nick Leeson, the
trader blamed for the #860m collapse of Barings Bank.
Sir David, as producer of the film, thought Grant would play the part
''supremely well''.
However, he said any plans were still ''very premature'' and that he
had not yet spoken to a scriptwriter. Arrangements for the film were
made only last week.
''It is all very premature. I do have an option for the film which we
arranged last week and Hugh Grant has expressed an interest,'' said Sir
David.
He said he had contacted Grant through his agents about playing the
part of Leeson, 28, currently in a Frankfurt jail fighting extradition
to Singapore.
Sir David said he had chosen Grant because ''I thought it was a part
he would do supremely well and he would relish switching from
upper-class roles to working-class roles because he is very versatile''.
Nevertheless, it was only an option on the film. ''For every one film
that is made, there are 100 options on films.''
Last month, Sir David interviewed Leeson in prison.
The former derivatives trader, who could be paid up to #3m for the
film, is said to be delighted at the possible casting of Grant.
Despite his tarnished image after his involvement with a Los Angeles
prostitute, the actor has made his reputation by playing sympathetic
characters and would be expected to do the same if he played Leeson.
Front runners for the role of Leeson's wife, Lisa, who now works in a
tea room to fund her weekly flights to visit her husband, were reported
to be Miranda Richardson, Jennifer Ehle, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Niamh
Cusack.

THE controversial move by supermarket giant Asda to abolish
double-time payments for Sundays for new workers is to be raised in
Parliament today by Labour.
Shadow employment spokesman Michael Meacher will also urge the company
to withdraw its plans, which have caused an outcry from union officials.
Asda has defended the move as being in line with other chains and said
it could increase the number of hours staff work.
However, Mr Meacher said that axing double-time pay was in breach of a
commitment given by the company at the time of the Sunday Trading Bill.
Mr Meacher will also protest to Asda.
The GMB general union, which represents 30,000 Asda workers claims
workers could lose #11 a day.

SCOTTISH international racing driver Dario Francitti has been told he
cannot use his national flag, the Cross of St Andrew, on his car.
Francitti, 22, from Bathgate, has been told by European race officials
to change it to a Union Flag.
However, this weekend, former world champion Formula 1 racer Jackie
Stewart criticised the ban as over the top. ''It sounds pretty silly and
very petty,'' he said.
Francitti, who races for the Mercedes touring car works team, faced
the first ban two weeks ago in France. Last week, track officials at
Hockenheim in Germany again told him he could not use the St Andrew's
Cross on the side of his Mercedes-C machine but a top official at the
FIA, the sports governing body, admitted he was not sure if there was a
rule which prevented Francitti using the flag.
The problem may have arisen because Scotland does not have an official
racing body represented on the FIA.
Now Jackie Stewart has suggested a way round the problem: ''I always
raced with the St Andrew's Cross and Union Jack. That's what I would
advise Dario to do. But I always put the St Andrew's Cross first. I am a
Scot and proud of it. But I am also British,'' he said.

A SENIOR Barings executive, heavily criticised in the Nick Leeson
affair, has bought a Victorian mansion in the Highlands.
Lawyers for Mr James Bax, one of the Barings executives criticised in
a recent report by Singaporean investigators, concluded the deal on
Friday.
He is believed to have paid more than #400,000 for the 16-room
Druimuan House, a country mansion near Pitlochry.
Its previous owner ran the house as a bed and breakfast. The mansion
is set in two-and-a-half acres bordering a nature reserve.
Sources said that Mr Bax, whose annual earnings potential, including
bonuses, runs into millions, was in the area at the time the house went
on the market in August, and paid two visits with his wife who comes
from Scotland.
The owner was aware that he worked for Barings in Singapore but was
unaware of his alleged connections with the Nick Leeson affair.
Mr Bax, head of operations in Singapore, was held partly to blame for
the Leeson debacle in the Singapore authorities' report published on
Tuesday.
The Singapore investigators accused him and former Barings chief
executive Peter Norris of first trying to cover up, and later playing
down, a #50m discrepancy discovered by auditors in January which would
have given early warning of problems.
''In concealing the problem, Mr Norris was assisted by Mr Bax, who
tried to divert investigations by the internal auditors,'' the report
said.
A Singapore Finance Ministry statement, which accompanied the report,
said inspectors found the fall of Barings Futures Singapore had been
caused by institutional incompetence, a lack of understanding of futures
business among senior executives, and a total failure of internal
controls.
Mr Bax, 42, who earned #300,000-a-year at the height of his career in
Singapore, was questioned for eight hours by the republic's authorities
when news of the Barings disaster broke.
It was reported that soon after the collapse of Britain's oldest
merchant bank, Mr Bax learned he would still receive his #2.3m bonus for
the year leading up to the disaster.
Sources said Mr Bax gave no indication of his plans to the vendor, who
assumed that like many high-flying expatriates, he wanted a home base in
Britain.
However, should he decide to move to Scotland to work, it is within
commuting reach of Edinburgh and Glasgow, both about 80 miles away.

ONE of Scotland's most famous charter boats goes into retirement today
when the 102-year-old Brixham trawler Lorne Leader finishes her final
journey.
The 100ft former fishing vessel was brought to Scotland in 1984 by two
London schoolteachers, Don and Jilly Hind. They had sold their London
home so Mr Hind, originally from Barlanark, could buy the boat to run
week-long trips to the Hebrides.
Their concept of converting a vintage sailing trawler for luxury
cruising was unique in Scotland at that time and the vessel sold out
almost all of her berths during her 10 sailing seasons.
Now the Leader is for sale at #120,000 while the Hinds turn their
attention towards converting a 126ft Dutch canal barge -- Fingal of
Caledonia -- into Scotland's first floating outdoor centre.
The new vessel will act as a 24-berth static youth hostel in Corpach
during the winter and will run week-long cruises to Inverness in the
summer, carrying canoes, sailing dinghies, and mountain bikes for the
use of her 12 passengers.
Speaking from her home near Oban, Mrs Hind said: ''I suppose in some
ways this is a sad day but it's been very exhausting and we are looking
forward to making the barge project every bit as successful as the
Leader was.''

COST-CUTTING may be the real reason behind the Government's health
warning about certain contraceptive pills last week, it was
claimedyesterday.
The move -- which sparked nationwide panic and which doctors and
scientists claim was unnecessary and bungled -- will save the NHS #25m a
year, according to Dr Peter Holden, chairman of the British Medical
Association's GP committee.
The seven pills named in the warning as having a high risk of causing
thrombosis, he said, are among the eight most expensive of the 26
combined oestrogen and progestogen pills available on the NHS.
Three months' supply of the drugs mentioned in the warning would cost,
on average, #6.55, he told the Independent on Sunday, while the other 19
brands would cost less than half this figure, at just #2.45.
If the 1.5 million women on the named brands swop to the cheaper
pills, the saving would be #25m. It would be even higher if some women
are scared off using the pill altogether.
Dr Holden told the paper: ''Given the risks are still very small and
less than those associated with pregnancy, I find the correlation of
price on the discredited drugs compared to their alleged increased risk
a very interesting one.
''I find it very curious, given the department's normally measured
response when giving advice on drugs which are not the subject of an
immediate withdrawal.''
Other unnamed senior figures within the BMA were even more outspoken.
''These are all expensive drugs,'' one said. ''They're all twice the
price of their nearest competitors. The Government grasped this as an
opportunity to cut costs.''
However, the Government's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Kenneth
Calman, denied the claim. ''This is not a cost issue. Cost has not been
mentioned. It is not relevant. The issue is whether women should be told
about the risk and they have been,'' he said.
Shadow Health Secretary Harriet Harman is to demand a Commons
statement today. Labour believes there has been a breakdown of trust
between GPs and the Department of Health.
Findings from three unpublished studies appeared to show that women
taking certain low-dose pills were at risk.
However, the move resulted in special helplines being swamped with
calls from worried women and doctors and drug companies accusing the
Government of acting too hastily.

STABLE girl Jessie Hurlestone, found battered to death in her caravan
home, had been living in fear of a stalker who had an obsession with
her, friends said yesterday.
The 27-year-old with a passion for horses had been ''seriously''
plagued by a man for three weeks at the top National Hunt stables where
she worked near Buckfastleigh, Devon.
She turned down the offer of moving in with her employers on Friday
night to ease her fears -- hours before her bludgeoned body was found on
Saturday morning.
Detective Superintendent Steve Pearce told a news conference yesterday
that Jessie, from Romford, Essex, suffered an ''horrific, terrible
attack''.
He confirmed police were following up the possibility that she was
stalked, and appealed for information about relationships she had.
Hawson Stables, where Jessie worked, have been run by Richard Frost
and his wife Glynne for more than 30 years.
A team of 50 detectives were searching for bloodstained clothing and a
weapon.
Distraught Mrs Frost said yesterday that horses had been Jessie's main
interest and ''she was not into boyfriends''.
''She certainly did not deserve this. It was a complete jealousy
thing, by someone who had an obsession over her,'' she said.
''I think the stalking had been going on seriously for about two or
three weeks.''
Police want to hear from anyone who saw or heard from Jessie between
10pm on Friday, when she left the White Hart pub in Buckfastleigh, and
7am on Saturday, when her body was found by another stable girl.
Jessie had no boyfriend and lived in the caravan near the stable block
with her four cats and a dog.
Mrs Frost recalled how Jessie was worried about being stalked by a man
on Friday night but she turned down an offer to sleep in the main
building. Instead, Mr Frost escorted her to the caravan to make sure she
got there safely.
White Hart landlord Ian Cox said Jessie had been a Friday night
regular for the last few weeks. People in the pub were ''stunned'' at
the death of a ''very ordinary, everyday girl''.
The Frost stable's two intended runners at Wincanton yesterday were
both pulled out of their respective races as a mark of respect to
Jessie.
Police said later that a 38-year-old man arrested at Dartbridge, near
Buckfastleigh, had been charged with murder and would appear before
magistrates in Torquay today.

FIVE people died and 11 were treated in hospital after weekend road
accidents in Scotland.
An elderly couple died yesterday morning after a collision on the A77
at Newton Mearns near Malletsheugh Hotel. They had been passengers in a
car driven by their son.
Mr Matthew Hinde, 69, of Blair Avenue, Hurlford, Kilmarnock, was
killed instantly and his wife Mary, 70, died later in Victoria
Infirmary, Glasgow.
Their son, Mr Alistair Hinde, 42, of Richardson Avenue, Hurlford, was
released from Victoria Infirmary after treatment for chest injuries. His
wife Ann, 42, was detained with back injuries.
The 29-year-old driver of the other car was taken to Hairmyres
Hospital, East Kilbride, and detained with leg injuries. Police have
appealed for witnesses.
A man was taken to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, by air ambulance
after being seriously injured in a road accident in the Highlands
yesterday.
Mr Robert Stewart, 19, of Fyrish Crescent, Evanton, Easter Ross, was a
passenger in a car being driven by his sister Diane, 23, who was also
injured in the one-vehicle crash on the B817 road at Newton, near
Evanton.
Earlier, three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed and
six others, four of them members of the crew of HMS York currently based
at Rosyth, were injured in a spate of road accidents.
Two young men who died after they were struck by a taxi as they
returned from a night out with friends were named as Mr Mark Smith, 24,
of Pleaknowe Crescent, and Mr Thomas Cassidy, 23, of Northcroft Road,
both Moodiesburn, Lanarkshire. The accident happened early yesterday in
Stoneyetts Road.
The two were taken to Monklands District General Hospital, Airdrie,
where they later died. Yesterday, their parents and relatives were too
upset to talk of the tragedy.
Twelve hours earlier, schoolboy Martin McMurrough, of Kirkshaws Road,
Coatbridge, died when the car in which he was a back-seat passenger,
collided with the central reservation barrier on the M74, near the
Millbank Interchange.
The 37-year-old driver and his three other passengers, all naval
personnel -- Mr Paul Jordan, 22, of Oakleigh Way, Carlisle, Ms Rene
Fairhurst, 21, of Bethel Avenue, Bispham, Blackpool, and Mr Neil
Kershaw, of Diccinson Street, Wigan -- were all taken to Law Hospital,
Carluke. Ms Fairhurst and Mr Kershaw were released after treatment. A
report is being sent to the procurator-fiscal.
Pensioner Frances Bradley, 72, of Summerlea Road, Thornliebank,
Glasgow, was seriously ill in the city's Victoria Infirmary yesterday
after being struck by a car in Carnwadric Road. Police are appealing for
witnesses.
On Friday night, four-year-old Danielle Purcell was hit by a car near
her home in Easterhouse Road. She was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary
and later transferred to Yorkhill Sick Children's Hospital, where her
condition is said to be ''stable''.

FORMER local government executives who have lost their posts in the
wake of reorganisation are helping Scottish charities lead the way in
submitting applications for lottery funding.
The National Lottery Charities Board is to announce its first round of
awards totalling #40m today, with Scotland receiving #17m.
Mr Jim Innes, spokesman for the NLCB, yesterday revealed that
redundant council chiefs appear to have put Scotland way ahead of the
field in submitting and processing applications.
''Many of the directors and deputy directors aged in their 50s seem to
have taken their redundancy and used their expertise to help charity and
voluntary groups. They have helped many groups submit applications and
have helped us process a considerable number very quickly,'' he said.
However, as Scotland awaits the lottery largesse, a row has broken out
between National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley and leading
charities.
Mrs Bottomley accused charities of ''whingeing'' over the payouts and
defended the lottery against criticisms made by entrepreneur Richard
Branson who said it was making ''obscene'' profits and was in need of
reform. The Virgin Airlines owner bid unsuccessfully for the lottery
which he wanted to make a non-profit-making operation.
Mrs Bottomley said: ''I am rather bored with whingeing from charities
on this whole subject when surveys that have taken place suggest some
have done very well this year.''
She also said charity executives should take care how much they paid
themselves when many workers work for love.
Cancer Research hit back at the criticism. A spokesman said: ''The
British public was sold the lottery on the basis that charities like
Cancer Research would get money from the lottery. We are 12 months down
the line and we have yet to receive any.''
A spokeswoman for the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said: ''We have
never whinged. We have said medical charities should be in with an equal
chance.''
A large slice of today's #40m payout seems destined for ethnic groups.
The NLCB is ''clearing the decks'' for an education programme,
targeting ethnic groups and youth organisations to teach them how to
apply for lottery funding.
Mr John Rafferty, Scottish director of the board, and Mr Graham Bowie,
chairman, have already addressed 110 of Scotland's 120 ethnic groups on
how they can benefit from the lottery.
Mr Innes said there were plans to train young people and ethnic
minorities as assessors to look at lottery funding for peer groups. Such
posts would require ''a ferociously high level of expertise,'' he said.
He would not be drawn on reports yesterday that many of the big
charities were set to lose out in the funding announcement to smaller,
more controversial groups.
Two groups which reports suggested were among the Scots beneficiaries
of funding were the Strathclyde Poverty Alliance and the Scottish
Council on Alcohol.
Mr Damien Killeen, director of the alliance, confirmed the group had
applied for lottery funding but had yet to hear the outcome.
Mr Douglas Allsop, executive director of the Scottish Council on
Alcohol, confirmed the group had applied for lottery funding for a
three-year project to combat the problems of poverty in Clydebank.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations
welcomed reports that smaller groups were set to benefit.
''The National Lotteries Charities Board made their first theme
poverty and low income. It is perfectly consistent that this round of
grants should be about alleviating poverty,'' she added.

<HEADLINE>Chancellor in cheerful mood over economic recovery as Budget draws near. Clarke puts damper on tax talk</HEADLINE>

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke yesterday tried to damp
down expectations of a ''bonanza budget'' next month.
He said he was feeling cheerful about what he would be announcing but
added that some reports he had read suggesting massive tax cuts were
''barking mad''.
Mr Clarke's message about the economy remained upbeat. The recovery
was developing strongly he claimed.
His second Budget, he said, had been ''a bit more cheerful'' than his
first. ''The third one, the way this recovery is growing, I am looking
forward to, for we are on the way to being a very successful enterprise
economy.''
Like all Chancellors planning a tax-cutting Budget, Mr Clarke has
become alarmed at reports that he is planning to do precisely that.
Suggestions that the tax cuts could range between #4000m to #6000m, if
correct, would rob his Budget speech of impact.
So the Treasury has been pointing out that the battle for spending
cuts has not yet been won and that several meetings have to be held this
week to determine the total resources the Chancellor has at his
disposal.
Forecasts of a cut of 1p in the standard rate of income tax to 24p
have been made as well as suggestions that the Chancellor will raise the
income limit for the higher level of tax at 40p and also the limit at
which inheritance tax begins. He is thought to be preparing a budget
with several measures directed at helping the family.
Labour have no doubts that tax cuts are on the menu. Shadow Chancellor
Gordon Brown pointed out that Government borrowing is overshooting Mr
Clarke's forecasts of last year.
He said: ''What is needed is a budget for investment and not political
tax cuts as sweeteners for the voters.''
Mr Brown said he thought the public realised that the Chancellor would
need to cut income tax by 7p in the # even to begin undoing the tax
rises of the past three years.
With Labour increasing its lead over the Conservatives to 30% in the
latest NOP poll for the Sunday Times -- Labour 56% (plus 3%),
Conservatives 26% (minus 1%), and Liberal Democrats 15% (minus 2%) --
many Tories believe only big tax cuts can save their party from defeat
at the next General Election.
However, some left-wing Tory MPs are deeply concerned that the Budget
tax cuts will be paid for by deep cuts in public spending and public
services.
The Chancellor insisted in an interview on BBC TV's Breakfast with
Frost that he would cut taxes only where it was prudent to do so.
He received with equanimity the news that Sir Alan Walters, Lady
Thatcher's former economic adviser, is to stand against him at the next
election as candidate for the Referendum Party. His intervention is
unlikely to make much impact on Mr Clarke's majority in his Rushcliffe,
Nottinghamshire, seat of nearly 20,000.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce today urged Mr
Clarke to cut whisky duty by half.
Mr Bruce said it was ''time to end the ludicrous situation whereby we
tax home-produced whisky at twice the rate of foreign-produced
champagne.
''I'm calling on the Government to cut the duty on spirits by 50p per
bottle in the Budget,'' he said.
''This specific proposal will be contained and costed into the Liberal
Democrat Alternative Budget for the first time ever. It would reverse
the outrageous increase in spirits duty in last year's Budget and begin
the process of bringing the spirits tax in line with other taxes on
alcohol.''
He told a debate on competitiveness in the Scottish economy at the
Scottish Grand Committee in Aberdeen that he would move a change to the
Finance Bill to win cross-party support for lower spirits duty.
Mr Bruce said it was not just special pleading but was about good
economic sense and fair play.
By boosting demand, a cut in duty might even raise Government
revenues. He estimated the maximum loss of revenue to the Exchequer
would be around #40m in a full year, modest in the context of overall
taxation and spending.

TWO teenagers found a man
dying from head injuries next to a bookmaker's shop in Bellshill,
Lanarkshire.
The man may have lain there for hours, ignored by shoppers and
Saturday night revellers who may have thought he was lying in a drunken
stupor.
The teenagers took a closer look at the man, then ran to a nearby
Chinese takeaway to raise the alarm.
Their quick thinking was praised yesterday by detectives hunting the
killer of former soldier Paul Clemenson, 28.
The bachelor had been severely beaten about the head and was found
slumped in a small garden beside Ladbrokes shop in Hamilton Road.
There appears to be no motive for the murder of Mr Clemenson who was
well-known in the town centre and had no specific address, say police.
Police are trying to trace the last movements of Mr Clemenson who was
seen sober and cheerful earlier on Saturday night.
They want to speak to anyone who was in the Orb public house next to
the landscaped area where the body was found, anyone who was a customer
at the Chinese takeaway, the off-licence next door, or any of the shops
in Hamilton Road.
Detective Inspector John Boyle said last night: ''There were up to 200
people in that pub and we are anxious to speak to them to find out if Mr
Clemenson was in there earlier on Saturday night.
''Mr Clemenson was a well-liked and well-known figure who frequented
the town centre. It is vital we find out where he had been between the
hours of 5.45pm and 10.30pm.''

<TEXT>
ULSTER Unionist leader David Trimble said yesterday Sinn Fein was
''the obstacle to progress'' in the search for a permanent peace in the
province.
His comments follow a week of speculation that the Government may be
softening its line over the precondition that Sinn Fein must address the
subject of decommissioning of weapons before all-party talks on the
future of Northern Ireland can begin.
The outburst coincided with a disclosure by Army sources that the
Parachute Regiment is earmarked to return next year to Northern Ireland.
Mr Trimble, speaking on BBC TV's On the Record programme, said: ''The
onus is on them and I am not going to explore possibilities or
hypothetical situations.
''The onus is on Sinn Fein-IRA to prove their peaceful intent. So far,
they have made no effort to do that . . . I think what they have to do
is to make a start . . . Sinn Fein are the obstacle to progress.''
Last night, counter claims to a peace negotiations break-down were
being made.
Sinn Fein criticised the decision to return the Paras to Northern
Ireland as ''provocative and insensitive'' and said it was a backward
step in the search for peace.
The Parachute Regiment's 2nd Battalion was withdrawn two months ago
but Army sources yesterday revealed that troops are scheduled to go back
to Ulster at the end of 1996 for a six-month tour of duty.
Sinn Fein's northern chairman Gerry O'Hara said the Government had
once again ''shown its contempt for the peace process with this
provocative and insensitive decision''.
He said it seemed Britain was intent on ''exacerbating the situation
by sending this hated regiment back to the north of Ireland''.
Even after 14 months of an IRA ceasefire, the Army has 16,500 troops
in Northern Ireland.
* Two men were being treated in hospital in Belfast yesterday after
being viciously battered in what appeared to be an IRA punishment
attack.
The men, aged 21 and 24, had been found in the republican Markets area
of the city, one with both arms broken and the other with a broken leg.
Both had open wounds.
Meanwhile, a man has been arrested following the petrol bombing of a
house a short distance away. Two men escaped uninjured from the property
in Sunnyside Street which suffered only minor damage.

THE uncle of the Princess of
Wales is seriously ill in hospital after fracturing his neck in a
riding accident.
Mr William Shand Kydd, 58, fell from his horse while riding at
Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, yesterday.
Mr Shand Kydd had been taking part in a competition when he was thrown
from his mount as hundreds of spectators watched.
A police helicopter was at the scene within minutes. It flew Mr Shand
Kydd to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.
On arrival, it was discovered there were no beds available in
intensive care and doctors took the decision to transfer him a further
30 miles by ambulance to Reading.
A spokesman for John Radcliffe Hospital said: ''Very careful
consideration was given to all the aspects of moving this patient and it
was eventually decided that we had no alternative.''
Mr Shand Kydd's brother married the Princess of Wales's mother,
Frances, after her marriage to Earl Spencer ended in divorce.
He is the brother-in-law of the missing Lord Lucan.
Mr Shand Kydd's wife, Christina, and his three grown-up children were
at his bedside last night.

TONY Blair today will signal his determination to project a new,
dynamic image for a prospective Labour Government by announcing a team
of junior Commons spokesmen crammed with new faces.
Among them will be Mrs Helen Liddell who for 14 months has been MP for
Monklands West, which she retained for Labour in a bruising by-election.
Mrs Liddell, 44, was secretary of the Scottish Labour Party from 1977
to 1988 and is already regarded as one of Labour's most able new Members
in the Commons.
She will join Mr John McFall (Dumbarton) and Mr John McAllion (Dundee
East) in Mr George Robertson's Scottish team, replacing Mrs Maria Fyfe
(Maryhill), who resigned last week.
Thwarted by the almost ''no change'' Shadow Cabinet elected by Labour
MPs last week, Mr Blair has made wide-ranging changes to the junior
appointments which he has power to nominate.
At least 13 new faces from the 1992 election intake have won
promotion, four of them women.
A number of those given middle-ranking jobs could find themselves in
the Cabinet if Labour wins the next election.
Among these are three Scots, Mr Alistair Darling, 42, MP for Edinburgh
Central, who has impressed Mr Blair with his performance on City matters
in the Treasury team where he stays.
Mr Brian Wilson (Cunninghame North) returns to transport, a portfolio
he left a year ago for trade and industry, to assist new Shadow Cabinet
member Clare Short in the rail privatisation battle where he is an
acknowledged expert.
Mr Henry McLeish (Central Fife) leaves transport to become number two
in Ms Harriet Harman's health team, an unusual appointment for a Scot
although Mr Robin Cook did a stint as Shadow Health Secretary.
Mr Wilson and Mr McLeish are both effective publicists as well as
performers in the House and will be dealing with issues likely to have a
high profile during the next election campaign.
Another rising star who looks marked out for a top job is Mr Geoff
Hoon, MP for Ashfield, and until last year also Euro MP for Derbyshire.
A barrister and former law professor, he takes responsibility for
developing Labour's policies on one of Mr Blair's ''big ideas'' -- the
information superhighway in Mrs Margaret Beckett's trade and industry
team.
Many of those promoted last year to the Labour Whip's office have been
appointed spokesmen, while up to 10 new faces will be promoted to the
Whip's office, where Mr Donald Dewar (Garscadden) is now in charge.
Among those moving up is Ms Estelle Morris, 43, former leader of
Warwick District Council, a teacher who joins the education team which
Mr Blair is beefing up in part to repel a determined Tory attack on
Labour's policies in this area.
Mr Malcolm Wicks, 45, who is MP for Croydon North-west and a
sociologist who has worked in the Home Office Urban Deprivation Unit,
goes to social security as does Mr John Denham, 42, MP for Southampton
Itchen and a former Friends of the Earth campaigner.
About a dozen former spokesmen, all of them told the bad news by their
leader, have lost their jobs.
Among the women moved is Ms Hilary Armstrong, 49, MP for Durham
North-west, who goes from education to environment, while Mr Gordon
McMaster (Paisley South) moves to the front bench from the Whip's office
as deputy to Mr Tom Clarke in charge of disabled people's issues.
Mr Blair is aiming to give as many talented MPs as much experience as
possible in the short time remaining before the next election.
The parliamentary party could well be asked next year to accept a rule
change allowing Mr Blair to appoint the Shadow Cabinet members as well
as the junior spokesmen.

AN official protest is being lodged with Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth after three Labour councillors on the new South Lanarkshire
unitary authority had their basic councillor's allowance increased by
#12,000 a year to carry out political duties for the Labour group on the
council.
The allowance, on top of the #6000 every councillor is entitled to
collect, will go to Councillors Derek Gibb, Labour group leader; Eddie
McAvoy, Labour deputy whip; and the Rev Stuart MacQuarrie, Labour group
secretary.
All three Labour group officials have been placed on the second
highest level of payment for promoted posts, immediately below the
council chairman and the leader of the administration, who each receive
an allowance payment of #16,000.
The official protest against the payments has been made by the South
Lanarkshire Conservative Forum, a watchdog body set up after May's local
elections, when Tory councillors captured only two out of the 74 wards
on the new authority.
The forum is also seeking the views of Labour's Shadow Secretary of
State, Mr George Robertson, on the ''political'' payments.
Hamilton District Councillor Margaret Mitchell, the forum leader who
failed to win a seat on the new South Lanarkshire council, said
yesterday: ''It is entirely reasonable that councillors are recompensed
for their work as elected members representing their constituents, and
that enhanced payments are made in recognition of additional
responsibilities assumed in order to ensure a smooth provision of
services to the electorate.
''However, it is quite unacceptable that council tax money, rather
than being spent for the whole community, should instead be used to
subsidise the Labour Party machine.''
The #12,000 allowance set for the Labour officials mean that they rank
higher than the councillors who chair the finance, roads, and planning
committees and put them on the same level as the chairs of the social
work and education committee.
In total, 48 of the 62 Labour councillors on South Lanarkshire will
receive special responsibility payments, ranging from #4800 to #16,000 a
year, on top of their basic councillor's allowance, with Councillor Ann
Winning, the leader of the SNP, also getting a #4800 allowance.
Councillor Mitchell, Conservative parliamentary candidate for the
Cunninghame North constituency, added: ''There appears to be a
disproportionate ratio of chiefs to indians in the Labour group.
''The forum is more than a little puzzled as to why Labour, who have
62 elected members out of a total of 74 altogether, should require a
whip, let alone a deputy whip -- unless to quell internal divisions
within the group, in which case the electorate should most definitely
not be expected to foot the bill for settling the Labour Party
squabbles.
''We are determined to keep George Robertson fully aware of what is
going on in his patch to prevent any situation where he could plead
ignorance of the activities of his local councillors.''
Last night Councillor MacQuarrie, South Lanarkshire's Labour group
secretary, said the payment to himself and the two other Labour group
appointees was perfectly proper and fully in line with the guidelines
set out by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
When asked why Labour needed three political officials to keep its 62
councillors under control when they were faced only by eight SNP, two
Tory, and two Liberal councillors, Mr MacQuarrie said: ''What you have
to understand is that we have such a large council and it's very
necessary for us to make sure that the policies on which we were elected
are fully implemented on the council and that they run smoothly.
''These political payments, if you like, are no different to those
made on other unitary authorities in Glasgow, Edinburgh, or elsewhere.
''They were unanimously approved by a full meeting of the council. The
SNP opposition leader is paid a bit less because her role is not as busy
as ours.''

THE spectre of Dounreay becoming Britain's first national nuclear
waste dump reappeared yesterday.
The fears follow a Government report which casts doubt on the
long-term safety of plans to build the repository at Sellafield in
Cumbria.
The report apparently reveals that plutonium from UK Nirex's proposed
underground dump at Sellafield could contaminate drinking water and
expose local residents to radiation doses 10,000 times the legal
maximum.
Opponents who fought several years ago against Nirex building a dump
for low and intermediate level radioactive waste at Dounreay have warned
that the body would be met with another vigorous campaign of protest if
it turned its attention to the Caithness site again.
Nirex chose Sellafield after a desperate search for an acceptable site
for the storage facility. It had considered another 11 sites for the
dump, including Dounreay, which was regarded as a possible alternative
and was the subject of a series of geological tests.
Highland Regional Council, which strongly opposed Nirex's interest in
Dounreay because of the unpredictability of storing nuclear waste
underground, warned yesterday that it would lead a ''vociferous''
campaign of opposition against any reconsideration of Dounreay.
Mr Peter Peacock, vice-convener of Highland Regional Council and
convener of the new Highland Council, said: ''Such nuclear waste is
active for hundreds of thousands of years and we were never satisfied
that the geological evidence was sound. We were concerned about the very
point mentioned in this new report, the contamination of water.
''The reason Nirex abandoned Dounreay was, they claimed, because
geological circumstances were not suitable, so if they turned their
attention back to Dounreay they would have an extremely difficult job
proving that the geology was now safe.''
Mr Ian Shepherd, a spokesman for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority at Dounreay, said: ''The siting of the repository is for Nirex
and the Government's experts to decide. It is not our decision. But we
fully support Nirex in its objectives to establish a national
repository.''
Mrs Lorraine Mann, of the Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping pressure
group, said: ''If the Government, the regulatory authorities, and the
nuclear industry think they can get away with it, they are wrong. It
would be fought tooth and nail every inch of the way, as it was the last
time.''
Some environmental experts, however, believe it is more likely that
the report's findings might force Nirex to abandon the whole nuclear
repository option.
Dr Patrick Green, senior energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth in
England and Wales, said the report, by the Pollution Inspectorate,
indicated that Nirex had several decades of research to undertake before
it could even hope to produce a safety case.
''If Nirex fails to produce a repository at Sellafield, then they are
still going to have the same scientific problems to overcome at Dounreay
so this does not mean that it is more likely that the dump will come to
Dounreay.
''It means that it is not likely that there will be a nuclear waste
dump at all in the foreseeable future.''
Dr Green added that the Government might now look ''very long and
hard'' at what Nirex is trying to do and said the problems in finding a
site for a repository could have serious implications for the proposed
privatisation of the nuclear industry because it underlined the fact
that the industry did not know how to solve the problem of nuclear
waste.

THE former leader of Scot--
land's main teachers' union, Mr John Pollock, has died after becoming
ill while on holiday in Majorca with his family.
Mr Pollock, who was 69, served as general secretary of the Educational
Institute of Scotland from 1975 until 1988. He had twice been chairman
of the Scottish Labour Party and was a former chairman of the Scottish
Trades Union Congress.
He had been nearing the end of a fortnight's holiday in Majorca with
his wife Joyce, son Gordon, and daughter Carolyn, when he complained of
feeling unwell on Friday. He was taken into hospital in Palma and
underwent an operation but died early yesterday morning. Details of his
illness are not yet known.
Leading the many tributes yesterday was Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson, who described Mr Pollock as a ''giant'' who had made a
''truly immense'' contribution to the Labour Party, to trade unions, and
to Scotland.
For the STUC, assistant secretary Grahame Smith said: ''John will be
remembered as a great educator and an outstanding trade unionist. He
brought the EIS to the heart of the trade union movement in Scotland.
Under his leadership, it made a major contribution not only to Scottish
education but to the whole spectrum of Scottish life.''
Scottish Office Education Minister Raymond Robertson also paid
tribute, saying: ''John Pollock always fought hard for the interests of
the EIS membership.''

FOURTH DIVISION ROUND-UP
THE big two of Kilmarnock and Glasgow Southern continued down winners'
way but not before the former had a narrow squeak at much improved
Edinburgh Wanderers.
The Ayrshire men made a strong start, scoring 11 points in the opening
15 minutes. Philip Gordon kicked two penalties. Then he stuck through a
grubber kick, the ball was secured by the forwards and chipped to the
line by Jason Sharp where winger Peter McIntyre touched down.
Wanderers worked their way into the game in what remained of the half
and after the turn Killie found themselves on the back foot. Carl
McWilliam kicked a penalty and then Wanderers stormed through a number
of loose tackles for a try under the posts by lock Dave Boswell, which
McWilliam converted. Gordon kicked a further penalty and Kilmarnock were
left holding on.
Glasgow Southern, however, did run up the expected big win, dismissing
pointless Wigtownshire by 85-14. The visitors opened the scoring with a
try from Brian Paxton, converted by Neil McCulloch but by half-time were
already 32-7 in arrears.
Their cause wasn't helped by having No.8 Alistair Thomson sent off
three minues after the turn and, carrying no replacements, they were
reduced to 13 men when Neil Gregory retired. But they still had the
gumption to score the final try through Darren Jessop. Southern touched
down 14 tries with three hat-tricks in the haul -- by Jeff Kayne, John
Clinkenbeard, and Sandy McDougall.
Gordonians's Australian coach Stewart Coward put the Aberdonians
through an extra training session and introduced a second fellow
countryman in stand-off Kane Barrie, after last week's disappointment at
Kilmarnock. He was rewarded with an 82-3 home win over Haddington which,
ironically, would have been greater if Barrie's place kicking had been
more accurate.
Having missed the first four conversions and with only a single
penalty success, he was replaced by regular Gordonians kicker Bruce
Doney, who goaled the first of seven conversions for his side to turn
30-3 ahead. In a second half of one-way traffic, winger Mark Estachy
took his try haul to four, with Andy Rose and Paul Blake each notching
two.
Ayr joined Langholm on the third rung after winning a dour battle at
Millbrae 10-3. All the points came in the first half with Justin Horne
scoring Ayr's try, converted by Craig Foster who also kicked a penalty.
Mark Grieve kicked Langholm's penalty.

THIRD DIVISION ROUND UP
KIRKCALDY'S hopes of stepping up to Division Two of the Premiership
took a knock when they went under to Glasgow Accies 22-8 at Anniesland.
They now have to look to beat the other member of the leading pair,
Biggar, on November 11, and hope Accies can repeat the dose the
following week.
Both sides displayed nerves in the first period, with Accies' handling
notably sub-standard, and both sides' kickers -- Calum MacGregor and
John Mitchell -- letting decent penalty chances slip away, despite their
exalted records. Mitchell, however, earned top plaudits for his policing
of Torquil Mathewson. For once the top try scorer had a blank day
despite being his usual dangerous self.
Accies broke the deadlock in 24 minutes. Gaining confidence, Kirkcaldy
had stuck together a prolonged piece of handling but when it broke down
on halfway, left winger Jonathan Williams hacked and chased for a try
which MacGregor converted.
Within a minute of the second half's start, Accies had scored their
second try. MacGregor's straightening run produced space in the defence
and the move ended with Steve Begley scoring. Mitchell pulled back a
penalty but Accies got on top, passes stuck and tries within five
minutes from MacGregor and Stuart Simmers settled the match. Kirkcaldy's
late push was rewarded with a try by Hendry Murray.
Biggar won 25-11 at Grangemouth, who remain relegation candidates. The
visitors found themselves on the receiving end for much of the match and
trailed 8-6 at the turn to a Kenny Halliday penalty and a try from Mike
Parsons.
Denis Lavery had put over Biggar's two penalties and he stuck over
four more in the second period as Halliday succeeded with only one from
several. Grangemouth's gloom was further deepened at the last, Lindsay
Steele penetrating their defence for a try which Lavery, of course,
converted!
Still looking for their first point, Corstorphine led Musselburgh 7-6
at the turn thanks to a try from Stewart Pilkington converted by Scott
McLean. A McLean penalty took them further ahead and as time ran out
they still led 10-9. However, the visitors' Cliff Livingstone charged
down a clearing kick and fed Stuart Campbell for the winning try.
Late pressure also decided the points at Preston Lodge where the
locals were trailing Peebles 12-6, Andre Bell having kicked four
penalties. In the final minute Scott McMillan took a tap penalty and
dived over with Rodney Gibb adding the conversion to his earlier penalty
brace for a 13-12 PL victory.

HERE'S a wee scoop for you as you crunch your high fibre, low salt,
and low calorie breakfast. Roy Laidlaw has been having a few meetings
about starting the real elite coaching for the best youngsters in each
region. I know because I tripped over him in Scotstoun the other day.
He'll need some luck, because, my friends, I cast my eye over the
playing talent we have at the moment and what do I see? I see a bunch of
old codgers that have announced their retirements who are still the best
around! Take the gorgeous Sean Lineen. If I was a girl I'd fancy him.
What the heck, I fancy him anyway, honest. Sean Lineen is the best
centre in the country at the moment, he lives rugby, and when he plays
it's like watching poetry. Except poetry is for pommie poofters and our
now retired sheep watching New Zealander has every move under the sun --
as Vicky from Victoria Falls can confirm. It's a funny hobby this sheep
watching, or so I'm told.
Or what about Gavin Hastings himself, your honour? Last week Gavin
banged them over from everywhere -- ahem -- but on Saturday he missed
three good ones, which is part of the beauty of the man.
But if I had my life resting on one man behind me in a team to hold on
to a high ball to save a game, or make three yards to win a game, then
it would be Gavin. No one can lace his boots. There were moments at
Bridgehaugh that he looked to have moved the clock back some
considerable hours before he was due to as the former captain seems to
have so much time on his hands at some phases of the game that's it's
not funny.
Iwan Tukalo. There, that frightened you didn't it? Tuks is still as
slippery as an eel and twice as crafty and he has turned coming off that
left foot of his into an art form. Not poetry, of course, because that's
for poofters. He is an old fashioned winger who was hurt by that
damaging piece of footage when Craig Joiner handed him off and went
round him a year or two ago, but Iwan will tell you that he wasn't fit
that day and shouldn't have played.
Or Kenny Milne? Much as I admire the lads in waiting -- I like
McKenzie's dedication, I think Martin Scott could be a good player -- I
haven't seen any of them blow Kenny Milne off the pitch which is what
young guys are supposed to do to the old guys in their way. Young blokes
are there to frighten the has-beens and hurry them into retirement and
although Kenny is to retire, he says, in a matter of weeks now, that
won't have been due to pressure from those around him.
And the list goes on to extend to real veterans. Like Stewart
Hamilton, 40 soon and who didn't take up rugby until he was in his
twenties. John Jeffrey, who is still going great guns with Kelso. Derek
Turnbull of Hawick, who can ruin more possession in one game than the
whole of the LA Police Department can smoke in a month. And even down to
that well known tap dancer Robbie Brown of Melrose who is pound for
pound as valuable a piece of meat as there is around.
So what's the solution. Well, your honour, I reckon we have to
acknowledge that the likes of Graham Shiel, Rowen Shepherd, Craig
Joiner, Martin Scott, Kevin McKenzie, and even the very powerful Stuart
Reid can all learn from these players. Just because Sean Lineen, Gavin
Hastings, and Kenny Milne have retired shouldn't mean that's the end of
them, and I believe down to my stocking soles that their role in the
game has to be preserved so that these highly talented, and very
knowledgeable, players can pass on as much of their knowledge to the
blokes who will have to take their places.
Each of these blokes, especially Lineen who has knowledge bursting out
of him, should be paid by the system to pass on all that they know.
There's no one playing better than them just now, and they know it.
And do you know? I'd get Gavin Hastings to teach as much as he can to
Kenny Logan about full back play because that's where he should end up.

FLASH of Realm helped Peter Monteith extend his lead in The Herald
Scottish Trainers' Championship following an easy win at Carlisle.
It was the Rosewell trainer's seventh success of the season, three
ahead of Scotland's newest recruit to training, Lucinda Russell.
Last year's winner of The Herald award, Dumfriesshire-based Len Lungo,
is still to score but no-one in Scottish racing has any doubt that he
will get around 30 by the end of May, when the season ends.
Flash of Realm was winning for the first time since December, when
Hearts captain Craig Levein claimed him out of a race at Edinburgh
believing he was a stallion.
When he discovered that the animal was a gelding, Levein sold him back
to Monteith, but the nine-year-old could not run for the yard for six
months.
At Carlisle on Saturday, Flash of Realm, 6-4 favourite, took the
Claire McCarroll Hurdle ahead of Superhoo.
For jockey Tony Dobbin it was the final leg of a 254-1 four-timer,
having already steered home Scilly Cay, Spanish Light, and Ninfa for
trainer Gordon Richards.
Flash of Realm made smooth headway to lead three out and was never in
any trouble.
Before his enforced rest he won three chases, but Monteith will
probably keep him to hurdles while he is reasonably handicapped.
He came out of the race well and will almost certainly turn out again
at Kelso on Saturday.
Monteith still has a glow of satisfaction about Done Well's success at
Newcastle on Wednesday. The three-year-old broke the course record and
Monteith feels he is good enough for one of the valuable juvenile hurdle
races in the late spring.
''He is the best horse I've had since Moment of Truth and Dizzy,''
said the trainer.
Moment of Truth, a top two-mile chaser, and Dizzy, who won the 1994
County Hurdle at Cheltenham, both died in tragic accidents.
Lucinda Russell missed her fifth winner by a very narrow margin when
Fiveleigh Builds, who had led from the eleventh, was beaten on the
run-in by Ninfa, going down by only a head.
Perthshire owner Fiona Whitaker, whose McGregor The Third has won
twice recently, had another success when McGregor's half-sister, Scilly
Cay, beat the favourite, Star Performer, in the Greenbank Carlisle
Hurdle.

Jed-Forest 11,
West of Scotland 7
DONALD Miller smiled unashamedly even as he apologised. ''Sorry about
that,'' he said, ''but that was one we really needed to win. It wasn't
pretty to watch, I know, but it's points we are after these days not
plaudits.''
The Jed coach got both in the end, but if he was right in admitting it
was not an attractive match, it did not lack in excitement. There was no
lack of effort from either side but the Borders broadsword was too much
in the end for the West rapier.
Jed did not have the luxury of a settled back division, with four
wingers being utilised because of injury. Even Gary Armstrong was a late
call-off and that would mean adjustment in any team. Jed filled the
scrum half spot admirably, with Graham Renwick proving a similarly tough
combatant. An Armstrong still starred, for Gary's brother Kevin had
another outstanding match.
Armstrong and his fellow forwards seemed the hungrier lot when it came
to driving and ball retention. And in the line-out West's expected
contenders were no match for Alan Dunnet and Colin Hynd.
In the loose, West's Gordon Bulloch, David McLeish, John Shaw, and
John Lonergan matched the Borderers, but too often in isolation. The Jed
forwards did not rove alone.
Ironically it was a good forward ploy that brought West their score in
15 minutes. Fraser Stott took the ball back into a maul where McLeish
took it on, fed Bulloch and the hooker sent David Jamieson plunging over
the line. Colin Wallace converted and West were to stay ahead for
another 45 minutes. Chris Richards did put over a penalty for Jed in 22
minutes but it was not until the hour mark that Colin Hynd crashed over
after leading-up work by the two Kevins, Munro and Barrie.
There was no conversion so the one point lead seemed precarious. But
Jed were relentless and although West tried similar driving tactics late
on, the line of blue jerseys was not to be breached again.
In the last minute Jed's forwards had a devastating driving maul which
hurlted West back about 40 metres. Not surprisingly, West had to concede
a penalty and Richards with only his third shot at the posts sealed the
win. Such was the Jed discipline in their own half they did not give
West a single penalty attempt at the posts.

Currie 34, GHK 17
'DON'T mess with Megson'' is a message which might useful be passed
around all Scottish clubs. Ray of that ilk, the international referee,
invited Currie's New Zealand lock Chad Eagle and Glasgow prop Gordon
McIlwham to desist from punching great lumps out of one another; when
they didn't he sent them both off after 22 minutes of the second half at
Malleny Park.
It is a decision which could have repercussions in the championship.
League leaders Currie will miss their top jumper for the rest of the
championship and GHK, not out of the relegation zone quite yet, already
have an injury list which would do justice to a small hospital.
Mr Megson also sought an explanation from the Glasgow club as to why
he was told they had no other prop on the replacements bench. When a
front row player is dismissed he must be replaced by someone who has had
experience in his position, otherwise scrums have to be non-contested.
''I asked if they had a prop and was informed they did not,'' the
referee told me. But front-row man Graham Millar was on the bench; he
apparently had injured his back in the warm-up and was not fit to come
on. It is as well, perhaps, that GHK were not taking any points from
this match.
They knew they were up against it before a ball had been kicked. GHK
director of rugby Andy Little pointed out he had 28 players out through
injury.
After 25 minutes at Currie, his own son, Cammy, had suffered a
recurrence of his hamstring injury and Andy Ness also failed to finish
the match. The only ray of light appears to be the imminent return of
international Shade Munro.
Are Currie good enough for the first division? In the opening 40
minutes they most certainly appeared to be as they served up a sparkling
dish of dashing tries. I don't know if the half-time oranges were spiked
but they played thereafter with all the flair of a bunch of crippled
clog dancers.
Indeed, GHK actually scored more points in the second period which,
considering their problems, was a tribute to their spirit.
The match had burst to life, Currie hammering at the visiting line
before Bruce Ward bounced over for the try. Ally Donaldson, as he would
for the rest of the afternoon, kicked a perfect goal.
Harry Bassi had a penalty chance at the other end but, as he would all
afternoon, he squandered it.
Seven minutes were on the clock when Murray Wallace picked up from the
back of a scrum, discovered the Currie cover was on holiday, and
accepted a try. Bassi's conversion was wide.
Two minutes later Donaldson slung out a long pass to Scott Forrester
and the winger scorched away for a touchdown. Ally did the needful.
A flowing handling movement led to Forrester's second with Donaldson
goaling. The other home wing Geoff Keen then got into the act, dodging a
couple of defenders en route to the line. Donaldson missed the
conversion but he was allowed a second shot as GHK had charged early and
goaled.
Bassi, having failed again, was relieved of the goal-kicking duties.
George Breckenridge took over -- and missed a penalty.
Still, it had been a lively half and I had been impressed by Dean
Shepherd, Currie's other Kiwi, at full-back and by the driving play of
the forwards. Ward, Paul Calder, and Fraser Thomson had caught the eye.
The GHK scrummage was stuck in reverse gear and they looked to be in
for a tanking. Far from it. Donaldson did kick a penalty after 59
minutes but the tries were at the other end.
Breckenridge climaxed a thrilling move which started deep in the GHK
22 and owed much to the linkage of Wallace. Glory be, George even
converted as well.
For some reason Currie now refused to play the ball wide, preferring
instead to take it back inside at every opportunity. This was branded by
a home fan with a loud voice as ''boring'' and he was seconded by all
present.
GHK, with Ian Sinclair at hooker in the uncontested scrums, started to
play with more confidence. After a run by Andy Pope -- he's from New
Zealand too -- prop Steven Gay grabbed another try. A Donaldson penalty
rang down the curtain but it had been a most uneven performance by the
home side.
''I think it all went terribly flat after the sendings-off,'' Ally
himself told me. ''We should have made more of our chances but, let's be
fair, they tackled very well in the second half. We have a hard away
game against Dundee High next week. There is no doubt we will miss big
Chad.''
Are there any locks left in New Zealand, one wonders?

Dundee High School FP 13,
Kelso 23
IF rugby was to adopt the methods of scoring used in ice skating, then
there would be few who would deny that Dundee would head the SRU
Tennents Premiership Division Two on the basis of ''artistic
impression''. The Taysiders once again on Saturday played some glorious
rugby at times. Sweeping back moves with flawless handling carried out
at pace followed multiple percussive thrusts and controlled delivery by
the young pack.
So what went wrong? Why did Kelso win? Well, Dundee lost out in the
''technical merit'' stakes -- they just couldn't translate their
pressure and half chances into points.
As Tom Dymock put it: ''We weren't just robbed -- we were mugged. What
we needed out there was someone with nous -- say David Leslie's head on
a pair of those young legs.''
Apart from the young legs bit, Kelso had precisely what Dymock's side
lacked -- the white shark, John Jeffrey. The elder statesman of the
Scottish game isn't quite as fit as he once was, but he knows all the
shortcuts to the action points and when he gets there he has the
know-how and technique that only two decades of top class rugby can
teach.
He keeps the Kelso side going and is always teaching them a thing or
two. ''As long as I can do that and not stop young talent from emerging,
I'll carry on,'' he smiled.
Jeffrey was full of praise for the way Dundee played the game -- and
how they stuck to their running game even when they fell behind. ''Most
days Dundee would have won -- we were fortunate,'' said the great man.
Another fine son of Kelso, coach Eric Paxton, was celebrating his
side's third successive win somewhat gingerly. Four impacted vertebrae
are the cause of Paxton's sciatica, and it speaks volumes for his
commitment to the side that he was there at all. The return from injury
of young scrum half Ian Fairlie -- who poached the first Kelso try, was
cited by Paxton as a big factor in the recent Kelso revival. Jeffrey and
Cameron Mead had the other Kelso touchdowns and Graeme Aitchison a
conversion and two penalties.
Dundee's Kiwi stand-off, Chris Robinson, had a superb all-round game
-- usually releasing his backs with well weighted passes, but clearing
his lines when necessary. He recorded a ''full house''; one each of a
try, conversion, drop goal, and penalty.
Dundee HSFP -- M Lamont; S Pearson, P Rouse, S Longstaff, J Jardine; C
Robinson, G Sandford; S Lithgow, G Scott, N Robertson, S Adam, S
Campbell, J Kidd, P Carnegie, I Hope. Replacement: S Petrie for Lamont
(29mins).

Selkirk 26,
Stewart's-Melville 22
A DRAMATIC try by Selkirk fullback Rodney Pow in the first minute of
injury time earned the Borderers an important victory in their
foot-of-the-table tussle with Stewart's-Melville.
It was the first time that Selkirk had held any lead over a Colleges
side which made them work hard all the way. In truth, Selkirk made life
difficult for themselves.
The pattern appeared to be set right from the first minute, with a
great start by Selkirk seeming likely to reap instant reward, only for
New Zealander Dean Gage to drop Andy Lindores' chip ahead as he crossed
the line.
As Selkirk struggled to find some shape to their game,
Stewart's-Melville capitalised on their disarray. A glimpse of vintage
play by Doug Wyllie brought Colleges their opening try as the former
Scotland player looped his centre Fraser Pollok to jink through and
score. Graham Stirling added the goal points to his opening penalty and
for Selkirk the struggle was on.
With the first half drawing to an end, flanker Scott McKenzie was
stopped inches short of a try and then Pow dropped his own kick ahead as
he crossed the line but at least je had set Selkirk on the scoreboard
with an opening penalty.
When Selkirk drew level early in the second half, following a good try
by Keith Johnston converted by Pow, relief was short-lived as
Stewart's-Melville promptly regained then increased their lead.
Selkirk's winger Mike Jaffrey, who last week celebrated his 200th game
for his club, was having the kind of game he would wish might melt into
the mists of time. Gifting the Colleges' good possession with a loose
kick, his misfield of the returned ball was collected by Wyllie who
slipped the scoring pass to Adrian Huett. Stirling missed the easy
conversion but was on target after flanker Dave Clark scored at the
posts.
The alarm bells were ringing for Selkirk but with Johnston adding a
second try and Pow two more penalties, they found themselves only one
point adrift. A nail-biting final 10 minutes was now set up. First Pow
went wide with a penalty attempt then hit a post with another, Scott
Nichol missed a drop goal and Johnston almost slipped through for his
third try. However, with the clock past the 40-minute mark, Selkirk's
final move conjured the ball for Pow to storm in for the winning score.
Selkirk -- R Pow; D Gage, K Johnston, J Brett, M Jaffrey; S Nichol, A
Lindores; B Johnson, D Graham, I Purves, K McConnell, D Cameron, S
McKenzie, P Minto, W Gentleman.
Stewart's-Melville -- G Stirling; A Huett, F Pollock, J Scott, M

JONATHAN Davies may have played his last game of rugby league -- and
he could even be about to hang up his boots completely after Saturday's
World Cup semi-final defeat by England at Old Trafford.
The former Welsh rugby union skipper, 33 tomorrow, clearly has his
heart set on returning home to South Wales sooner rather than later
after gracing the rugby league scene for nearly seven years.
Cardiff have expressed an interest, but Warrington have said they will
want compensation if Davies goes back to his former code now. He is
contracted to Warrington until June 1997 and they have threatened to sue
for breach of contract if Davies leaves for another club without their
permission.
Davies plans to have talks with Warrington this week, but he has
hinted that if things are not sorted out to his liking, he may walk away
from rugby altogether.
The Welsh RL skipper said after Saturday's game: ''It was my last
international game of rugby league -- that's definite.
''Whether it's my last game of rugby league, we'll have to wait and
see.''
When asked where he thought his future lay, Davies replied: ''Maybe in
retirement.''

Stirling County 17,
Watsonians 13
A WARM glow besets you as you enter Stirling County, and the amber
nectar goes down well with the salt and vinegar crisps.
My kids now think they are on first name terms with ''Kenny'',
''Kirsty'', ''Muff'' and Mrs Logan. And I'd just like to say to my old
friend Brian Edwards that I'm very sorry if I get anything wrong here,
and that's before I've even written the piece.
In fact, the only sour point on a day that saw us all introduced to
Kenny Logan's lucky blue underpants after Kirsty Young had sped away in
a rather fetching blue Ford Probe -- a deliberate match no doubt -- was
the club's reaction to the suspension of Murray Fraser by the SRU. But
more of that elsewhere.
For Stirling, Brian Ireland's work rate is still more than crucial,
Gareth Flockhart makes ground with the ball in hand, Malcolm Norval is
getting better and gets around, and the front row trio of John Gibson,
''Budgie'' Cairney and Brian Robertson must fairly annoy opponents with
a bad boy attitude that does them proud. Cairney got one against the
head too in a very productive game for him in Kevin McKenzie's absence.
Behind the scrum, Kenny Harper looked eager, Mark McKenzie, one of the
best place kickers in the country, took chances and you could argue a
few too many in a creative game, while Ian Jardine is a safe bet to make
some yards. Logan took a knock so it is perhaps unfair to make a
judgement when a storming game was marred by the sight of him being
caught from behind by Fergus Henderson.
Mark Te Whaiti of Watsonians could be one of the most devastating
runners in the Scottish game if he lost some weight and received some
better passes from an off colour Andy Garry -- Scott Hastings was
resting an injury -- and Andy Drought was a composed but skinny runner
in for the injured Duncan Hodge.
Stirling were two kicks to one ahead when Jamie Weston's cruel teaser
was fluffed by Craig Sangster and John Kerr barged over.
McKenzie pulled it to a one point margin before a devastating piece of
continuity that was started by Flockhart's break from a scrum saw
Stewart Hamilton latch on to the pass and dive over.
At nearly 40 too.
Another great match this was, and two more penalties saw the end of
the scoring as both teams battled to cross the line.
Logan waved bye bye after the game. Or at least I think it was a wave.
Funny place Stirling.
Stirling County -- C Sangster; C McRobert, I Jardine, M McGrandles, K
Logan; M McKenzie, K Harper; J Gibson, R Cairney, B Robertson, S

* WALES A were given a comprehensive lesson when Fiji won 25-10, four
tries to one, at Bridgend in the tourist's opening game on Saturday.
Kevin Bowring, Wales' acting coach, Bowring could not hide his
disappointment as the Wales A team, so successful under him in recent
times, were blown away.
Some of the hugely-talented Fijians had not played for five weeks, and
some had not represented their country before -- whereas the Welsh
line-up boasted no less than 12 full internationals and contained many
of the players expected to provide the nucleus of Wales' 1999 World Cup
squad.
Fiji now have five games against Welsh club opposition before the
November 11 international at Cardiff Arms Park.
On the evidence of this contest, however, Wales badly need a return
from rugby league of inspirational players like Scott Gibbs as much as
the bulk which the likes of Derwyn Jones will no doubt provide in three
weeks' time.
The Fijians, anxious to re-establish themselves as an international
force after failing to qualify for last summer's World Cup, clearly have
quick, strong and instinctive runners among their backs and tough,
athletic and constructive performers in the pack.

Heriot's FP 26, Hawick 23
WHATEVER his lasting memories of Scottish rugby, Terry Rahui, the
Heriot's stand-off, will surely retain the memory of his performance
against Hawick on Saturday. Which was a faultless display of place
kicking that resulted in six successes from six attempts, his final
effort being a pressure penalty kick to win the match for the Goldenacre
side when a draw seemed the likely and indeed just outcome.
''This was undoubtedly my best game for Heriots'' said Rahui, whose
return and that of Cameron Glasgow, to the Heriot's side made a
significant difference. Cameron, playing alongside his twin brother Tony
for the first time since the latter moved to Goldenacre, marked his
entry into the Tennent's championship with one of the two Heriot's tries
and also made a telling contribution in defence, notably in fielding the
high ball.
Cameron's try was the result of Hawick being shoved off their own
scrum ball by the powerful Heriot's pack , Tam McVie picking up the
loose ball, Tony Glasgow linking, and brother Cameron finishing.
Hawick are not the only Border club with front row problems -- a
weakness exposed cruelly on that darkest of days at Netherdale two
nearly years ago against New Zealand -- but if they are to remain among
the elite then (as several Hawick officials conceded on Saturday) one or
two players may have to attracted to Mansfield.
Not that the home-grown crop is failing Hawick. Far from it.
Hawick, who finished one ahead in the try count, played some
marvellous rugby but will be annoyed with themselves for not making it
count in terms of points during several sustained periods of pressure.
But the disappointing aspect for Hawick was the place kicking of Scott
Welsh. The stand-off, who in recent games has kicked Hawick to victory,
missed four from seven attempts including a last minute kick to draw the
game.
That was not to detract from Hawick's tries -- three veritable gems.
Welsh, again in sparkling running form, gave his side the best of starts
with an individually created try, the talented stand-off cutting clean
through the Heriot's defence for a classic score.
Hawick's second try, scored by Colin Turnbull, however, was the
choicest. Brian Renwick, whose form suggests he is not far away from an
A cap, ignited a move that was then all about continuity.
David Grant played an important role, Renwick and Hay maintained the
momentum of the attack, and finally it was Derek Turnbull who supplied
the scoring pass for his namesake.
By comparison, Keith Suddon's touchdown from a clever grubber kick by
Cameron Murray was a simpler affair and a suitable riposte to the
earlier try for Heriot's by Hugh Gilmour from a run by Stuart Lang.
Heriot's FP -- S Lang; C Glasgow, A Glasgow, G Lawrie, H Gilmour; T
Rahui, F McMillan; M Livingstone, K Milne, S Paul, J Turnbull, P Young,

AT MEGGETLAND
Boroughmuir 31, Melrose 15
BRING on the shrinks. Boroughmuir have elbowed their way to the front
of the Premiership queue and, on the basis of a clinical demolition of
mighty Melrose, could excused for considering themselves favourites at
this crucial point in the championship race.
But, with five games to go there is no premature poultry counting
going on at Meggetland.
In the weeks ahead they have Gala away, Hawick at home, Stirling
County away, Watsonians away and then, on the final Premiership
Saturday, Heriot's FP will be at Meggetland. Saturday's victory over
Melrose was the crucial one.
There is some justification, then, for suggesting that, if Boroughmuir
can keep to the straight and narrow, then the title will be Meggetland
bound for the first time since 1991.
But Boroughmuir coach Henry Edwards is having none of it. ''The
difficult part begins now. We're going to have to keep the boys
level-headed, and we have to make sure that they are totally focused on
the job in hand,'' he said.
Is there a role here for the sports psychologist which Scotland
drafted into the back-room staff last season? ''Sports psychologist'',
said Edwards. ''We'd need a lot more than one!''
Boroughmuir's performance on Saturday (three tries to none telling its
own tale) was built around better quality possession and backs who took
their chances well.
The lineouts were, generally, a mess but Boroughmuir, with Burns and
George to the fore, made much more of a bad lot than did Weir and Brown.
Big Doddie in particular had the kind of game which he'd like to forget.
One stand-out of note was the Boroughmuir No.8 Stuart Reid. His try
was the least of it. He looks fitter, hungrier, and more abrasive than
he has done in a long while. I'd play him on the blind-side flank for
Scotland against Western Samoa, with Eric Peters at No.8 and Rob
Wainwright at open-side.
That in itself would create problems for 'Muir, with the possible
championship decider against Watsonians taking place on the Sunday
immediately after the Samoan Test. 'Muir skipper Peter Wright is taking
nothing for granted in terms of international selection but hopes for a
postponement should he and Reid and Derek Stark all make the Scotland
side. ''If not, then I'll certainly play two games in two days,'' he
said.
Boroughmuir actually trailed 8-12 at the turn on Saturday, Gary
Parker's four penalty goals shading a fine try by Iwan Tukalo and a
penalty goal by Andy Knight, who was on momentarily while Bryan Easson
underwent running repairs.
Melrose had been disrupted by injuries to Bryan Redpath, who retired
temporarily for attention to a head cut and left permanently at
half-time suffering the effects of a hard blow to the hip. Parker took
over the scrum-half duties and Gus Redburn took up station on Parker's
wing.
Easson kicked Boroughmuir into the lead with a penalty three minutes
into the second half and after Parker steered home his fifth penalty
goal in the 60th minute, Melrose troubled the scorers no further.
Easson cut the lead to one point with a penalty and Boroughmuir went
in front with Reid's try after fine handling by Easson, Lineen, and
Stark, Easson converting.
Another Easson penalty goal stretched the lead before young Graeme
Beveridge made the most of a deft pass from Peter Wright to streak in at
the corner flag for a try which Easson converted.
Boroughmuir -- D Macrae; D A Stark, D L Laird, S R P Lineen, I Tukalo;
B R Easson, G Beveridge; G D Wilson, N R B Dickson, P H Wright, D G
Burns, D L George, A M Cadzow, S J Reid, G Dickson. Replacement (temp) A

IT's been nigh on two months since that momentous Sunday in Paris when
the International Board chairman Bernard Lapasset came to the Ambassador
Hotel in the Boulevard Haussman and told us that the game was a bogey.
The translation is but an approximation of what he actually said but,
in essence, he was telling us that the ba' was on the slates for
amateurism and that from here on in, virtually anything goes.
Pay-for-play? You got it. Win bonuses? Yup, that's OK. Contracts for
players? Mais oui, almost obligatory. A pay ceiling? Absolutely not.
Free gangway for rugby league players? I'll get back to you on that one.
And so on, and so on. The bottom line was that if you can't control
then don't attempt to regulate and the inference was that this was
exactly what the Board had been doing for all those years of
shamateurism and boot money and car-park cash being diverted into the
players' pockets.
They couldn't control, therefore they weren't going to attempt to
regulate any more. The game was open and the amateurism laws had been
replaced by a set of ''non-regs'' referred to as Participation in the
Game regulations.
What progress has been made, then, since those historic events of
August 27? Well, Rob Andrew has got himself a #150,000-a-year job with
Sir John Hall's Newcastle-Gosforth. He got himself sacked by Wasps for
recruiting Dean Ryan, Nick Popplewell, and Steve Bates and, in the
process, sacrificed his England career.
Anything else? Anything stirring in Scotland? Well, actually no, or
nothing much to speak of. The clubs were asked what they thought about
it all and the sound of silence could be heard booming up and down the
land. Admittedly, when the stakes are so high, the game does not wish to
be seen to be rushing to decisions which it might later regret.
Decide in haste and repent at leisure the old saying goes but it would
be nice to think that someone, somewhere had an idea or two to rub
together. Keith Robertson had a decent stab at it in these columns last
week. Keith will be recalled as an arch exponent of those mazy runs from
the dead-ball line when friend and foe alike looked on in trepidation
for just the slightest clue as to what was going to happen next.
His blueprint for the future of Scottish rugby contained an echo of
those mazy, crazy days when, with Melrose and Scotland, he could reduce
the watching Jim Telfer to a quivering mass of jelly. Maybe his thoughts
on the development of the Scottish game have had the same effect
because, essentially, what he was saying was that the director of
rugby's vision of districts in Europe was fundamentally flawed and would
be to the detriment of the clubs which still represent the backbone of
the Scottish game.
Not everyone will agree with Robertson, and as a matter of fact I
don't, but he is to be commended for opening up the debate. In theory,
it would be wonderful if Scottish club sides could do the business in
Europe. In theory time travel is possible but in practice it isn't yet a
big seller with A T Mays. Similarly, there isn't a club side in Scotland
which could compete with the leading clubs in the European Championship
and the competition isn't going to hang around for a couple of years
until there are. For Scotland it begins next season.
The Scottish Rugby Union have set up a series of working parties to
examine all of the issues thrown up by the decision to scrap the
amateurism regulations but, in the absence thus far of a lead being
shown from on high, it would be helpful for all concerned if more folk
contributed, like Robertson, to the debate.
For what it's worth, I'm for Districts in the European Championship. A
moratorium for at least a year on payments at club level. Compensation
for smaller clubs which lose players to Premiership sides -- but no
transfer fees. A flat-rate payment for members of the Scotland and
Scotland 'A' squads with attractive appearance and win-bonus fees for
members of the big side only. And if the Districts are to play a greater
role in the scheme of things then there should be a massive marketing
exercise and appearance fees there, too, funded not by the SRU but by
the District themselves. That's more than enough to be going on with.

Gala 14, Edinburgh Academicals 35
''THERE are still 10 points on the table, but the way we've been
playing we'll be lucky to survive,'' admitted Gala coach Peter Dods
after watching his team slump to their seventh league defeat of the
season.
The game was effectively over by half-time, Edinburgh Accies having
scored four tries and established a 28-9 lead.
Gala did play with more vigour in the second period and dominated
territorially much of the time, but Dods agreed that it was all too
late.
The former Scotland and British Lions' fullback lamented two missed
opportunities early on that could have changed the game.
The first came straight from the kick-off when Mark Moncrieff failed
to hold a pass from Arni Van Rooyen with the line beckoning.
The South African centre himself then wasted an overlap, and while
Gala's attack sorely lacked the ability to finish, their defence made
things a little too easy for their opponents, who extracted full price
for the failing.
Gala did in fact lead through a second minute penalty from Gavin
Dalgleish, only for Accies to reply three minutes later with a try which
was certainly well taken but nonetheless eminently preventable.
Martin Waite, who again showed up well in the loose, managed to escape
down the narrow side from a scrummage just inside the Gala half of the
park.
The No.8 then linked with Aidan Dow, and it was from his inside pass
that Malcolm McVie plunged over the line past the barely existent Gala
cover for the try.
Four minutes later, the home side's difficulties in the pack were
shown up by the award of a penalty try following a scrummage just short
of the line.
Dalgleish managed to land two more penalties to narrow the deficit,
but Accies' next try in 24 minutes was again assisted by defensive
shortcomings from the Netherdale side.
The visitors collected a ricochet at a lineout in Gala's 22, and when
the ball was moved out to Chris Simmers, he brushed off Brian Swan's
tackle in midfield to touch down between the posts.
Waite was next to score from a scrummage pushover five minutes later,
and Michael Duncan added his fourth conversion, the stand-off also
impressing with his kicking from hand throughout the 80 minutes.
Where McVie, Andy Adamson, and Scott Murray had dominated the lineout
in the first half, Matthys Stoltz and Robert Hogg managed to win some
decent ball after the interval for Gala.
However, Accies' tackling was more secure, even if they killed the
ball on the ground too often knowing that Gala would have to run their
penalties.
David McIvor halted many a Gala move, and from the Scotland flanker's
pass, Barry Stewart crossed for Accies' fifth try in 74 minutes, Duncan
maintaining his 100% goal kicking record by slotting yet another
conversion.
Stoltz managed a consolation try for Gala in the last minute, but
Accies faced a happy journey back to the city, having earned their first
victory at Netherdale since 1937.
For the home club, the immediate future at least does not look bright.
Gala -- S Paterson; M Moncrieff, A Van Rooyen, B Swan, C Dalgleish; G
Dalgleish, D Paterson; T Walker, I Corcoran, A Johnston, M Stoltz, R
Hogg, T Weir, D Liddle, J Amos.
Edinburgh Accies -- S Burns; A Dow, C Murray, C Simmers, G McKinlay; M
Duncan, K Troup; J Fayers, P Haslett, B Stewart, A Adamson, M McVie, D
McIvor, M Waite, S Murray. Replacement, E McDonald for Adamson (75mins).
Referee -- J Fleming (Boroughmuir).
SCORERS: Gala -- Dalgleish, 3p; Stoltz, 1t. Accies -- McVie, 1t;

INSIGHTS Inverleith must dread visiting Linwood for league encounters
with CIBA Kelburne. Last season they surrendered a 3-0 lead before going
down 4-3.
On Saturday, they again appeared to be coasting to three points. They
led 2-0 at half-time from goals by Mark Lucas and Martin Pearson but
history repeated itself after Kelburne, encouraged by a goal by Craig
Watkins, went on to win a five-goal thriller with further strikes by
Stuart McAlpine and David McKay.
Western looked as though they might suffer a similar fate to
Inverleith in their tussle with Clydesdale.
Graham Joyce and Roddy Philp gave them a 2-0 advantage after 20
minutes, but they lost much of their efficiency when Colin Moulson cut
the arrears after 25 minutes.
While Western continued to dominate, they should have been brought
back to level terms by Moulson late in the game but Gary Thomson denied
them with a fine save.
Meanwhile, Grange, the leaders, saw off Pender Uddingston 7-0 to
retain their two-point advantage at the top of the table. Touche Ross
Gordonians, after twice nullifying goals by Chris Anderson, managed a
2-2 draw at Menzieshill while MIM continued their revival, beating
Torbrex Wanderers 3-1.

GREAT Britain's build-up towards their Olympic qualifying tournament
in Capetown next month gathered momentum in Madrid on Saturday when they
sealed their victory in the three-match test series with no little help
from the five-strong Scottish contingent.
The Scottish girls were all in the starting team for the final game
and they proceeded to fashion Great Britain's 3-1 victory and so give
them the series 2-1 after losing the opening game last Wednesday.
Susan MacDonald, Western Klick Photopoint's centre forward, was the
team's real star by confirming her position as their top scorer with
three goals on the tour.
She set up their opener for Jane Sixsmith in the final test and then
went on to score another two herself to seal Great Britain's triumph.
Indeed, as far as goal scorers were concerned, it was the Scots who
fashioned Great Britain's success, for in the second test it was Susan
Fraser (two) and Rhona Simpson who made their 3-0 victory possible after
MacDonald had hit the target in their initial 2-1 defeat.
Western, even without MacDonald, still find the net with great
regularity. They extended their winning sequence at the weekend, beating
one of the new emerging powers, Royal High Gymnasts, 6-0.

HAMMY McMillan beat Perth's Warwick Smith 9-3 to win the McCallan
European Playdowns at Hamilton yesterday and now will represent Scotland
at this year's European championships in December.
The Stranraer team of McMillan, Roger McIntyre, Mike Hay, and Norman
Brown scored a 2 in the first end. The team's then swopped singles until
a lengthy raised take-out with his first stone, following by another
take-out on Smith's counting stone with his own second shot gave
McMillan a 5 at the eighth end and overall victory.
He had headed the rankings at the end of round-robin play and moved to
the final with a 9-7 win over Smith yesterday morning. Smith then
recovered to beat Gordon Muirhead 10-6 to face McMillan again in the
final.
While McMillan dominated the men's event, the women's competition was
tighter and produced a three-way tie yesterday morning. Debbie Knox's
team had missed overall victory by inches in their last round-robin game
and then went down by 5-7 to Kirsty Hay in the first knock-out game.
Hay then went on to face Rhona Martin in the final and was behind for
most of a tense game. A single brought Hay level at the seventh and then
a 2 at the ninth end put her in front, and she went on to win 7-5.

Hamilton 0, Dundee United 1
IN AN open letter to Accies fans on Saturday about the problems that
beset the club, chief executive Alistair Duguid called for their support
through ''thick and thin''. He also posed a question . . .
After tremendous results last season, and with only one change in
playing staff, surely Hamilton don't become a bottom-of-the-league side?
The brutal reality at 4.40pm, after a seventh defeat from 10 starts,
was ''Yes''.
Ironically, Accies could have taken a point but for a stunning,
intuitive save by Ally Maxwell three minutes from time.
Duguid's letter said the club intends to be back in Hamilton next
season. Contamination at the chosen site was not as bad as first
thought; Hamilton Enterprise has offered support, and Lanarkshire
Development Agency may provide grants.
To this observer, the new stadium is desperately needed because it is
not Firhill for thrills when Accies play there. With three sides of the
ground closed, even the largest attendance of the season -- thanks to
the visitors from Tayside -- could not lift a barren atmosphere.
But United's skills raised spirits, with Robbie Winters especially in
sparkling and entertaining form.
United could have been three up within 12 minutes but for keeper Allan
Ferguson racing out to clear from recent signings Owen Coyle and Gary
McSwegan, a striking partnership which is beginning to gel.
Then Andy McLaren hit a post after nutmegging Steven Renicks, although
such superiority was not turned into goals until 90 seconds after the
interval.
McSwegan's opener for his new club was a beauty -- from a Winters
cross, he turned Martin McIntosh and netted from 20 yards in one
movement.
Accies' worst break came in 87 minutes when Maxwell blocked a Gary
Clarke drive from point-blank range.
Maxwell, with little to do until then, cited similar experiences while
with Rangers for maintaining his concentration. Manager Billy Kirkwood
said the save was worth three points, but rightly added that United
should have won more convincingly.

Morton 4, St Johnstone 0
AS PART of his long goodbye, Derek McInnes, the Morton captain, waved
his farewell to the Cappielow crowd. There were good wishes and respect
all around. If he was ahead of himself, it was only a little.
The small ceremony of departure suited the occasion. In everything
else which all the Morton players did -- conspicuously a hat trick by
Warren Hawke -- they were a lot ahead of a bemused St Johnstone.
Morton's next game is away from home and Allan McGraw, the manager,
expects the McInnes transfer to have been done by then. He said that
four buyers were trading with firm offers, three of them English clubs.
He accepted that McInnes' personal qualities could not be replaced. If
his boots can't be filled, neither can his position.
No ready successor is available.
And it was in the midfield that Morton based their serene superiority.
In the circumstances, McInnes' contribution was muted. Close marking
allowed him hardly room to breathe.
Taking a corner gave him his first bit of grass. Freedom of time and
space produced an accurate cross for John Anderson to head home.
Morton were on the way to their second foursome of the season and St
Johnstone, after a bright flurry, were right out of it.
Repairing the hole left by McInnes will not be seamless. Probably, it
will be done by redeploying staff and not by recruiting.
With a team so integrated as Morton, even an expected loss can feel a
sudden shock when it at last happens. On the other hand, any outfit so
buoyant and so much enjoying themselves may patch up colourfully even a
big alteration in their fabric.
Two of Hawke's three goals came from classic headers, the first a
quick nod after Lindberg had released Derek Lilley to cross from the
left. Controlled patience was needed later when a soft lob across the
width of the penalty box by Marco Rajamaki must have seemed to Hawke to
take a week to reach him.
St Johnstone shaped up better when reduced to 10 men with the
dismissal of Jim Weir, who left after a foul on the predatory Hawke on
top of early hot words with a linesman.

POLLOK came from behind to beat Maryhill and win a place in the second
round of the OVD Scottish Cup.
Keeper Ronnie Lowrie gifted Maryhill the opening goal when he
misjudged a cross to leave centre forward Keogh with a simple knock-in.
Darren Stewart shot through a ruck of players to put Pollok level
before half-time and within five minutes of the restart striker John
Paisley scored what proved to be the winning goal after a blunder by
defender Neil Watt.
The cup was not so kind to the other Central League teams with
Ashfield, Renfrew, and Bellshill all failing in replayed games.
Meanwhile, Arthurlie extended their lead in the Central Reebok Premier
League with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Kilsyth.
Whitburn will meet Linlithgow Rose in the semi-final of the Skol
League Cup following their 1-0 defeat of Newtongrange. In the other
semi, Ormiston had a 5-1 away win over Livingston.
Ayrshire's match of the day was the Whyte and Mackay Cup tie between
Cumnock and Auchinleck.
Cumnock, on a high following their midweek Scarlett Cup final win over
Ardeer, started the game well but fell behind to a Chris Ellis goal
after 30 minutes. Gary Graham made it two from the penalty spot after
Kenny Paterson had been pulled down. Cumnock struggled to repeat their
cup final performance and had central defender Jamie Murphy sent off
late in the second half.
Glenafton continue to lead Ayrshire's Western Stagecoach first
division following their 2-1 away win over Ardeer Thistle.
Cup-holder's Camelon were given a home tie against Luncarty in
yesterday's second-round draw for the OVD Scottish Cup. Draw:

St Mirren 1, Airdrie 2
JOHN McVeigh, Airdrie's assistant manager, joked at Love Street:
''Hey, I see matches are lasting 98 minutes these days.''
It was a throwaway line, but a couple of corridors away, those
connected with St Mirren were not smiling.
Downright unhappy, even angry, would not be strong enough to describe
their feelings. Two men in black had made three controversial decisions
which probably influenced the final outcome.
The eight minutes extra run by German-born Glasgow referee Gary
Mitchell -- five of which were in the first half -- was one of them.
The second was in the fourth minute of that first half overtime when
he and stand side linesman Eddie Mack allowed Airdrie's Jim McIntyre,
obviously yards offside, to run on and equalise from a Steve Cooper
pass.
Then in 65 minutes, with the score still at 1-1, Airdrie skipper Jimmy
Sandison, just back after suspension and booked in the third minute,
brought down Brian Hetherston. The Saints player had skinned him for
pace as he cut in towards the penalty area, and as he went past,
Sandison's challenge sent him tumbling.
Another booking obviously would have meant a walk to the dressing
room, as well as missing Airdrie's midweek Coca-Cola Cup semi-final
against Dundee at McDiarmid Park. Amazingly, referee Mitchell kept the
yellow card in his pocket, but still gave the foul.
These were only three of the many inconsistencies in a towsy match
which had five bookings overall.
Saints manager Jimmy Bone had to choose his words carefully: ''That
incident just before half-time disrupted the game. Everyone in the
ground saw it, and I think it was the turning point. The referee
actually agreed that I could go in and see him, but I changed my mind.
I'll do it in writing.''
On the game itself, Bone admitted: ''I was happy with the way the lads
battled away. Their greater experience caused us a lot of problems and
they probably were the better team. But we need a wee rub of the
green.''
Saints' injury problems continue to increase. Finnish trialist Janne
Makela lasted 32 minutes before he limped off with knee-ligament damage.
Since the internationalist is only on a month's trial he may return to
Finland and be brought back again when he's fit.
St Mirren had actually taken the lead through Stuart Taylor in 27
minutes. Jim McIntyre's equaliser deflated them and Graham Harvey
clinched the three points to give Airdrie the perfect boost for
Wednesday's Cup clash.
McVeigh said: ''Some day, some team will take a hiding from us. We
have been creating a lot of opportunities without converting them.
You're always sitting on that knife edge towards the end of a game
hoping you won't give anything silly away.''
On the ''offside'' incident, McVeigh said simply: ''We'll take
anything we get. These things have a habit of balancing out over the
season.'' And on Sandison: ''I think the referee called that one right.
There was nothing malicious in the tackle.''
Back to referee Mitchell. One thing he did right was to calm down a
fued between Saints' Rikki Gillies and Airdrie's Sandy Stewart. Gillies
had been booked in the first minute for a reckless challenge on Stewart
which had the defender on the sidelines for a couple of minutes.
But there is still one question to which everyone is desperate to know
the answer. ''Where did you get the extra eight minutes from, Mr
Mitchell?''

Dunfermline 3, Dumbarton 1
THERE are times when Dunfermline appear to be suffering from the same
problems in the first division as those which afflict Rangers in the
premier division.
Before Saturday's game against struggling Dumbarton, the Fifers were a
comfortable five points clear of their nearest challengers, therefore
even a defeat would not have affected their lofty league position.
Is it possible then, that Dumfermline have opened up too big a gap at
the top and that the players are perhaps complacent?
''There can be a bit of complacency,'' admitted manager Bert Paton
after watching his team grind out their eighth league win of the season.
''It's sometimes harder to focus the players for games against teams
from the lower part of the league.
'' Next week we play Dundee United at Tannadice and there will be no
problem getting anyone fired up for that one, but against teams like
Dumbarton we have to work hard to ensure the squad has the right
attitude.''
When asked about his method of doing this, he replied: ''We build up
the opposition, make them out to be world-beaters.''
To cast a dispirited side like Dumbarton as world-beaters would
require a vast injection of psychological overtime by Paton and his men.
The Boghead team are now lodged in the relegation zone and look a
disjointed outfit, with all their attacking efforts emanating via the
ageing legs of midfielder Chic Charnley.
On numerous occasions he released searching, probing balls only to be
seen throwing his hands up in despair and howling with frustration as
his team-mates repeatedly failed to take advantage.
Dunfermline took the lead in 12 minutes when Stewart Petrie outpaced
the Dumbarton defence before slotting the ball past Ian MacFarlane.
Within a minute Charlie Gibson headed an equaliser but Greg Shaw
restored Dunfermline's lead 10 minutes later.
Shaw made sure of victory on the hour when he clipped Petrie's cross
into the net from close range.
Hamish French, absent through injury for several months, made a brief
appearance towards the end but Paton made it clear that French would
face a hard task in finding his way back into the side in view of the
current form being displayed by Shaw and Petrie.

Dundee 1, Clydebank 1
DUNDEE player/manager Jim Duffy spent an uncomfortable Saturday
afternoon discovering the harsh realities of directing a side at both
league and Coca-Cola Cup targets at the same time.
Although promotion remains the aim of Duffy and his side, a semi-final
date against fellow-first division side Airdrie beckons at McDiarmid
Park on Wednesday evening.
And that appointment, while secondary to the Taysiders' prime
objective, nevertheless diverted a noticeable degree of attention away
from the job in hand against Clydebank.
The cost was two valuable points lost, not to Gary Bowman's equaliser
after 86 minutes, but to an all-round home performance without
substance.
Jim Duffy described it thus: ''Ours was a nothing display, with little
or no purpose about it. Creative play was marked absent, apart from the
occasional threat supplied by Neil McCann.''
''Managers, coaches, and even players can deny all they like that
forthcoming big-time games will be allowed to affect the thinking on the
bread and butter occasions, but our display against Clydebank belies
that opinion.''
To make matters worse, the exercise may have cost the Dens Park men a
couple of their most influential players for their midweek task, Dane
Morten Wieghorst and skipper Neil Duffy both limping out of the action
with nasty injuries.
Both joined Gerry Britton on the treatment table yesterday as the race
got under way to get them fit for the cup confrontation with Alex
MacDonald's men.
The latest news from the club last night hinted at concern over one of
the trio, with major question marks being placed against the other two.
While discontent best described Dundee feelings as to Saturday's
events, Clydebank had every reason to feel elated with the display which
earned them a point, and helped extend their unbeaten league sequence to
five matches.
Brian Wright's side grew in self-belief the longer the game
progressed, and they fully deserved a share of the spoils.
Bowman's late strike levelled Dundee's opener after 31 minutes, a
precise header from Neil Duffy off an inch-perfect assist from a McCann
free kick.

Aberdeen 3, Partick Thistle 0
HABITUALLY, it has taken time for new arrivals to find their feet at
Aberdeen and Alex Ferguson once theorised that it was the heavy sea air
which was the problem delaying Gordon Strachan's expected impact at
Pittodrie.
No such difficulty has been experienced by Paul Bernard, the Dons'
latest and most expensive recruit.
Starting his first match since his #1m move from Oldham, he struck up
a potent partnership in central midfield with Eoin Jess and both scored
in the 3-0 win over Partick Thistle.
Their performances, albeit against a side stricken by injuries, were
enough to provide genuine optimism for the task against Rangers in
tomorrow night's Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at Hampden.
Bernard said yesterday: ''We all felt harshly done by when Rangers
beat us a couple of weeks ago. We won't need any motivation in the
semi-final.
''It was great to get a goal in my first start for my new club and
show the fans what I could do. Having to sit on the bench for the last
four games was very frustrating, but the manager had explained that I
would have to wait for my chance.
''I know Eoin from our time together with Scotland's Under-21 side. I
have always worked well with him and been comfortable with his style of
play.
''We already have an understanding and, hopefully, can form an even
better partnership very quickly. If we can build on this it can only be
good for Aberdeen. I'm sure this will come with more games together.
''We needed this sort of performance after our last couple of results.
Now we must maintain this standard against Rangers in the Coca-Cola Cup.
''I'm looking forward to my first competitive game at Hampden and the
atmosphere there, even though it could be very tense with a lot of
passion.
''Hopefully, though, there will be also be a fair amount of football,
which will suit us. We are at our best in this situation.
''We are playing well and this is down to our coaching. Roy Aitken and
Tommy Craig preach my kind of game and it all clicked against Partick.
We really flowed, particularly in the second half, and everyone here is
now in the right frame of mind.''
An own goal in 25 minutes by midfielder Albert Craig put paid to
tenuous hopes Partick had entertained, and Aberdeen ended as convincing
winners.
Their manager, Aitken, insisted it was the perfect confidence-booster
for Hampden, but agreed that Rangers would provide a much more demanding
challenge.
However, his former Scotland and Celtic team-mate Murdo MacLeod,
maintained: ''If they believe in their cause and stand up and be
counted, they have a great opportunity to beat Rangers.
''They could bring in one internationalist in Duncan Shearer, for
another internationalist Scott Booth, whereas I had to come in for my
first game in five months because of injuries. That shows the depth of
their resources.
''We urgently need new faces after three successive defeats.
''Some of the players here don't want to play for Partick. This is
causing problems which must be sorted out very soon. It is up to me to
get rid of them.''

Rangers 4, Hearts 1
EVERYONE, it seemed, had had their say on Rangers' embarrassing
midweek defeat from Juventus in Turin, and at Ibrox on Saturday, the
less-than-silent majority decided it was time to declare their feelings.
The Rangers support gave the team their biggest home audience of the
season, with more than 45,000 making their own declaration of faith in
the club.
It may not make much sense to those who would want to take a more
global view of the game. But it does tell you that the domestic
rivalries which have fuelled Rangers -- and others -- over the years
continue to exist.
The sad thing is that the challenges are less formidable now than they
have been. This game was a case in point. Rangers scored almost
immediately, through the irrepressible Paul Gascoigne, and added two
more goals before half-time.
By then the taunts of ''Juve, Juve'' coming from the area which
contained the Tynecastle support, were becoming more and more pathetic.
Indeed, when you consider those who relish Rangers' European agonies,
you have to wonder if they ever consider the plight of their own clubs.
By the end of the programme on Saturday, the Premier League had
completed its first quarter and Rangers were six points ahead of their
closest challengers Celtic, and with a massive goal difference of 11 to
give them added comfort if they need it.
They won this match with ease and even Hearts' manager Jim Jefferies
was forced to admit: ''Every club who comes here has the same thing in
mind -- try to get over the first 20 minutes or so and then see how the
game may go.
''The first goal was a killer. We stood back and allowed Paul
Gascoigne to pick up the ball, move in on goal, and then pick his spot.
''Honestly, the first half just killed us. Out of maybe five chances
they created, they scored three times and that was us in trouble. All we
could do was to try to get a goal, which we did, and then played better
in the second half. If we had stopped them getting the fourth, we might
have had an interesting last 10 minutes.''
But you sensed that Jefferies was talking without any real conviction.
He must have known, as everyone else in the massive Ibrox crowd knew,
that Rangers had the game won by the interval.
All that was left for Hearts was to keep the score as respectable as
possible. It was to their credit that they did so, even though they were
helped by further Ibrox injuries to David Robertson and Richard Gough,
which necessitated the defence being altered yet again.
Yet, while the champions' defence looked more vulnerable in the second
half it was his own defence which disturbed Jefferies most. ''We have
been punished by poor defensive work all season,'' he complained, ''and
we cannot allow it to go on.
''Obviously we have missed Craig Levein and he is going to be out for
another five or six weeks. We have to tighten up at the back because the
mistakes being made are killing us.''
So much so that the Tynecastle team are hovering far too close to the
relegation area for their manager's comfort.
Predictably, Rangers, as ever, turned their backs on Europe to find
that things had not changed too much at home. They may fail in the
Champions' League, but no-one seems able to mount a consistent and
measured challenge here at home.
Their manager, Walter Smith, said simply: ''We were pleased to get off
to a good start. It was important to do that.
''It was encouraging, too, to see the size of the crowd to and hear
how the support got behind the team. They have been turning out in big
numbers all season and it was the right time to give them a result.''
It was the right time, too, for Russian sriker Oleg Salenko to give
the fans the goals they have been demanding from their summer signing.
He had scored just once before -- in the Brockville win over Falkirk --
and his double against Hearts was the first time he had been able to
score at Ibrox.
Defender John Brown, who stepped in for the injured David Robertson in
the first half and who appears to have temporarily abandoned his
coaching role, pointed out: ''There will be more goals to come from Oleg
once we all get used to him and he gets used to us. It takes time to
settle, but the way he took his goals today suggests he will continue
getting them.''
The other Rangers' goal arrived from Gordon Durie, while Hearts'
spectacular strike came from John Millar.
But the goal everyone will remember was the first from Gascoigne,
where he showed all of his sublime skills and lifted his side's
confidence when that was so vitally important.
Rangers had three players booked, Andy Goram, Paul Gascoigne, and
Gordon Durie, while Hearts defender Neil Pointon was also shown the
yellow card in a game studded by curious decisions from the match
officials.

Hibernian 4, Motherwell 2
MAYBE he has been as angry before in his relatively short career as a
manager, but Motherwell's Alex McLeishhas disguised it in carefully
couched phraseology, no doubt saving the real stuff for inside the
dressing-room. He tried to do it again this time but the controlled
exterior very nearly cracked as he said his piece at Easter Road.
In fact, he concluded by apologising for the brevity of his remarks .
. . ''I am a bit upset'' . . . and headed for the changing-room to sort
out his troops.
The fury clamouring for release from his breast was perfectly
understandable. Two things were made clear in the first half of a
splendid contest, that Hibs can be a very good team indeed, and that
Motherwell can be very poor. The Fir Park side's defence was simply
appalling during the first half-hour, by which time Hibs, full of
invention, speed, and enterprise, were three up, going on six.
Motherwell's defenders were even bumping into each other in best
Keystone Cops tradition as they chased and raced (if that is the right
word) after the sharp Kevin Harper, Keith Wright, Michael O'Neill, and
Kevin McAllister, not to mention the best of the lot, Darren Jackson.
The back four could be described as statuesque, but footballers are more
effective when they move.
In contrast, the smiles were plentiful in the other dressing-room,
even if Hibs managed to slip from their first-half excellence to a
mediocrity that was only partially excused by the fact that they held
such a big lead.
In fact, when Motherwell did get themselves sorted out after the break
and cut the deficit to 3-1, they missed a penalty which might well have
sent the game into a hectic finish.
However, it would be churlish to concentrate on the down-side of what
was generally a sparkling show. The movement, passing, and imagination
of the Hibs players were quite special and thoroughly appreciated by
their supporters in a crowd that looked and sounded more than the
official 9896.
When they play like this, Hibs can be a match for anybody. Jackson,
who has been asked to take on a midfield role because of the spate of
injuries the club has suffered, is taking to it with relish, even if he
confesses he would rather play up front, where he is competing for a
Scotland place.
His manager, Alex Miller, who is also assistant to national manager
Craig Brown, has kept Brown informed of the situation and, as the
national gaffer saw for himself on Saturday, Jackson is doing his cause
no harm in his unfamiliar position.
Wherever he plays, if he can score goals he will be a serious
contender for the international team. His own ambitions, naturally, lie
in getting into the squad for the European Championships. ''There are
eight or nine strikers chasing five places so it won't be easy. I will
need to play well right to the end of the season to have a chance.''
He should be a fair bet to succeed, especially as he already
demonstrates that greedy desire to have his name on the scoresheet which
is second nature to all of his kind. The first goal against Motherwell,
for example, was the result of a well-hit shot by Wright which hit
Jackson and went into the net. Maybe it was Wright's goal? ''No way,''
said Darren. ''I stuck out my chest and diverted the ball away from the
keeper.''
That was in two minutes, giving the Motherwell defenders an early
alarm, but they did little about it. Jackson scored his second from the
penalty spot when Andy Roddie leaned heavily on McAllister. From our
angle the foul was clear and seemed to take place right on the 18-yard
line. Jackson hit the spot-kick hard enough to beat a willing dive by
Scott Howie.
Then, when Miodrag Krivokapic was caught flat-footed by a Pat McGinlay
clearance, Wright sped off, despite attempts to hold his shirt by the
Slav (who would have been sent off if he had succeeded), and smacked the
third goal past the keeper.
''We knew all about Hibs' strengths and their pace,'' said McLeish.
''That is what makes it so annoying. I have played against some of the
fastest players in the world. If you can't match their speed then you
have to be fly.''
In other words, anticipation and organisation are needed in these
circumstances, both of which were absent.
There was a genuine improvement after the interval when Motherwell
took the initiative -- as they had to -- and John Hendry, who replaced
Tommy Coyne, brought a fresh purpose to the attack. His first goal was a
touch bizarre, as Jim Leighton had gone down to collect a header from
Brian Martin, seemed to lose control, but was startled when the striker
hit the ball off his chest and then shot it over the line.
That signalled a period of panic in Hibs' ranks until Michael O'Neill
took advantage of further sloppy defending to put them three clear
again. Hendry's second goal came too late to make any difference.
Motherwell may not have played this badly for years, never mind weeks,
but while Hibs are entitled to be pleased with the show so far, they
still look vulnerable themselves.

Kilmarnock 0, Celtic 0
THE Old Firm returned from the European front, Rangers humbled by a
dreadful experience and Celtic buoyed by a performance in France which
offered encouragement. Tommy Burns' players were the ones who suffered
less in terms of psychological damage, yet it was they who faltered.
While Rangers were doing their best to distance themselves from that
black night in Turin last midweek by giving Hearts a going-over, Celtic
were failing to put Kilmarnock away and by nightfall on Saturday they
had slipped further behind the Ibrox side, who continue to lead the
premier division.
Celtic had an exhausting return trip from Paris which bridged Thursday
night and Friday morning and while some players might justifiably have
felt too fatigued to produce their best, manager Tommy Burns refused to
use the rigours of playing in the European Cup-winners' Cup as a valid
excuse. The determined nature of his side's play in the second half at
Rugby Park demonstrated no-one's energy supply had run dangerously low.
However, while Burns' players were not lacking in spirit they were
without genuine craft and finishing power in front of Kilmarnock's goal
and, after having dominated totally in the second half, they had to
settle for a share of the points. It is a failing which will cast them
too far adrift off the top of the premier division if the problem is not
eradicated soon.
Celtic's attacks broke in front of Dragoje Lekovic's goal with the
monotony of the tide and it was a combination of poor finishing,
shortage of ideas, and the alacrity of the Kilmarnock keeper which
denied them maximum points.
They could have had a penalty also when John Collins was hauled to the
ground by Mark Skilling and Tom Black -- ''I always thought that when
two or three players climbed over one, some kind of foul was given,''
Burns said -- but Celtic had more than a single incident about which to
fret.
The best opportunity of the match, which was at times frantic and
scrappy, fell to Simon Donnelly in 70 minutes when Pierre van Hooydonk
set him up perfectly, but the chance was squandered. Donnelly could only
direct his shot at the keeper, who, to his credit, narrowed the angle
well and seemed to invite the Celtic player to shoot slightly to his
right, which was precisely where Lekovic positioned himself.
Nevertheless, Donnelly should have scored and, given the pressure
Celtic were exerting, there was always the feeling that one goal would
lead to a deluge. Instead, Kilmarnock's defence escaped with another
clean sheet and their stirring recovery from a thoroughly miserable
start to the season continues.
Their slowly strengthening sense of well-being can be put down to two
things: a tightening of a leaky defence and a frank discussion behind
closed doors about problems on and off the pitch.
''There is no doubt we have tightened up,'' said Neil Whitworth, ''and
we have lost only two goals in the last four matches compared with the
number we conceded previously.''
Kilmarnock had lost 14 goals in seven Coca-Cola Cup and
premier-division matches before the manager, Alex Totten, took his squad
away to a hotel for a couple of days during which everyone was allowed
to have his say without fear of retribution.
''That seemed to relieve a lot of the tension,'' Whitworth added and,
since the players' return from their two-day conference, they have
performed with much more confidence and assurance.
Saturday's game was one they would have lost earlier in the season,
but they hung on grimly, sometimes defending erratically, and had smiles
for one another at the end. Celtic, by way of contrast, looked
perplexed. They couldn't quite understand how victory had eluded them.
Again, Kilmarnock's central defender Whitworth was willing to venture
an answer. ''Celtic seem to be lacking a bit of finishing quality,'' he
suggested. ''Andreas Thom and Pierre van Hooydonk are always in a game,
but I don't think they finish enough off for their manager's liking.''
Whitworth was not given an argument and, I suspect, Burns would not
have objected too loudly either had he heard the Kilmarnock defender.
Burns said he would be more alarmed if his players were not creating
opportunities, but he knows Celtic need to finish others off when they
are on top.
''We do need another striker in there,'' he said. ''However, the one
thing we must keep doing is apply the principles relating to how we want
to play the game.''
Burns decided against using Paul McStay from the beginning because
when he played in Paris it was his first game in three weeks, and the
manager felt his captain shouldn't be stretched too much on his return.
McStay, though, appeared seven minutes into the second half, when he
took over from Brian McLaughlin, and his arrival coincided with the
beginning of Celtic's period of dominance.
Still, even he was unable to play enough telling passes through
Kilmarnock's defence, which is drawing strength from the commanding
displays of Lekovic, who had an excellent match. Apart from his save
from Donnelly his finest stop was the one which denied John Collins in
59 minutes when Lekovic saw the midfield player's free kick from 22
yards coming at him late, but still managed to spring to the left and
save.
''It was a hard-earned point,'' said Totten. ''I thought we played
well in the first half but the second belonged to Celtic.''

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
TINY cracks in Huntly's armour have emerged this season, but few could
have imagined fortress Christie Park would come crashing down in such a
decisive fashion as on Saturday.
Peterhead effectively blew the title race wide open by netting six
times in a nine-goal thriller.
It is many years since Huntly suffered such a rout in the league. They
stay two points clear, but both Keith and Peterhead are breathing down
their necks, the former with a game in hand.
The 6-3 result also killed the champions' 27-game unbeaten league run.
Peterhead manager Dave Watson said: ''We are getting better all the
time, and obviously it was pleasing to put six past Huntly, but I'm
convinced this side is capable of more.''
The result overshadowed action in the Scottish Qualifying Cup
semi-finals, where Keith held on for a 2-1 win against Deveronvale after
goals by the half-hour from Kevin Will and Gary Taylor. Vale pulled back
through a Wayne Thornton penalty.
Fraserburgh's Mike Stephen returned from suspension to grab an
equaliser to force a replay next weekend with Lossiemouth, who had led
through Scott Paterson.

GEORGE Graham, disgraced manager turned media pundit, told Radio 5
Live listeners on Saturday that the game between Chelsea and Manchester
United was ''a great advert for English football.''
A few other nationalities surely deserved a mention, for there were
representatives of nine different countries playing, though it was the
solitary Frenchman who commanded most attention.
If fate had been kind in granting Eric Cantona a return to football at
his own adoring Old Trafford earlier this month, volatile Stamford
Bridge was hardly the ideal venue for a first away game in nine months.
Nor was Alan Wilkie -- who sent him off on that infamous night at
Selhurst Park -- the referee he most wanted to see.
But from the moment that Cantona stepped over the ball to allow young
team-mate Paul Scholes an early goal, he must have felt it might be his
day after all. That was confirmed when he laid on a second goal for
Scholes, still within the opening 10 minutes. Mark Hughes briefly
threatened his old colleagues' win bonus, but Ryan Giggs, with an
outstanding individual effort, and substitute Brian McClair, with a
fourth goal, carried United to a handsome victory.
It was just as well that United were on their game, as all their
championship rivals also won, none more emphatically than Newcastle, who
drubbed Wimbledon 6-1 to preserve their four-point lead. Three goals had
gone in before goalkeeper Paul Heald was sent off, and Vinny Jones, who
deputised, made a couple of good saves before Les Ferdinand completed a
hat trick. In scoring for the seventh successive game, Ferdinand
equalled a club record, and he now has 16 in 12 games this season.
Goals from Ian Wright and Paul Merson kept Arsenal on the up at
Highbury, futher undermining Aston Villa's good start to the campaign.
England captain David Platt has been missing for some weeks, but does
need to rush back. Indeed, with Dennis Bergkamp just getting used to the
pattern of play, it might complicate matters when he does.
Middlesbrough, 1-0 victors over QPR, are the surprise packet, holding
down fourth place with only one defeat -- and Juninho still to come.
Nottingham Forest, the only British team to win in Europe last week,
maintained their unbeaten Premiership record with a 3-2 win over Bolton
that was harder work than expected.
It was the last knockings, too, before Alan Shearer -- who else? --
rescued Blackburn from another utterly miserable week with his equaliser
at West Ham.
At the bottom, Manchester City were grateful for the small mercy of a
goalless draw at home to Leeds, which yielded only their second point.
Saturday's other Premiership game brought a 1-0 home defeat for
Coventry at the hands of Sheffield Wednesday.

Raith Rovers 0, Falkirk 1
RAITH Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl, so proud of his side when they
performed courageously against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup last
Tuesday night, could only shake his head in frustration on Saturday
after watching the same men stumble to a home defeat against the bottom
club in the premier division.
Said Nicholl, who watched in horror just before half-time when
defender Ronnie Coyle and goalkeeper Scott Thomson gifted Falkirk the
only goal of the match: ''That was a sore one. It's probably the worst
45 minutes I've seen for a long, long time, including when we were in
the first division.
''Nobody seemed willing to take the responsibility of bringing the
ball down, putting their foot on it, and making passes. It was dreadful
stuff and I was going to read the riot act at half-time.
''Then we lost that crazy goal, and that topped everything that was
bad about the first half.''
The goal, which gave Falkirk their first win of the season, came from
a long, hopeful punt through the middle. Thomson needlessly raced well
out of his goal and Coyle, not realising where the keeper was, aimed a
back-header to where he thought Thomson should have been.
The ball went past the keeper, straight to Paul McGrillen, who had
only to run the ball over the line.
Asked if Thomson had put his hands up and taken the blame, Nicholl
replied: ''Put his hands up? If he had put his hands up he would have
saved it. Scott Thomson has been having an excellent season, but there
is more to goalkeeping than saving shots and he knows that. It was a
ridiculous goal to lose.
''Although we worked harder and played better in the second half, we
simply threw away three points and it's hard for me to take.''
Nicholl, however, is a pragmatist. He refused to blame a reaction to
the Bayern game for such a poor performance and when he looked at the
overall picture of the first quarter of the league season, he said: ''If
someone had told me we would have 12 points at this stage, I would have
been happy.''
He was also convinced that his side should have had two penalties for
fouls on Danny Lennon and Ally Graham. I have to sympathise with him
there.
Falkirk, who had snapped up former Rangers left back Stuart Munro from
Bristol City on a free transfer, gave what was probably their best
defensive performance of the season in the second half. They had much
the better of the first period, but had to withstand some heavy pressure
after the interval and they passed the test.
Said manager John Lambie: ''The win has been a long time coming. The
big difference was that our lads worked hard and helped one another and
the big plus for me was that we didn't concede a goal. Stuart Munro
brought organisation to the defence and Joe McLaughlin was magnificent.
''We haven't been getting any breaks this season, but we got one today
and in football sometimes that is all that's needed to get yourselves
going.''
One bleak spot for Falkirk, however, was a bad injury to Steve Kirk.
The player sustained a deep gash on the back of his thigh which required
several stitches and already Lambie has ruled him out of next Saturday's
match against Hearts at Brockville.

THE value of adding a second goal to a lead was illustrated by the
contrasting fortunes on Saturday of Stenhousemuir and Clyde. 'Muir
obtained the extra cushion against Queen of the South and won 2-1,
whereas Clyde did not, and succumbed by the same score to Ayr United.
The Warriors' Miller Mathieson set up Gareth Hutchison on the
half-hour and Jimmy Fisher soon supplied for Ian Little to shoot a
second. Queens improved after the break -- too late, lamented manager
Billy McLaren -- with Tommy Bryce punishing a rare mistake in the home
defence.
Meanwhile, luckless Eddie Annand did what he has done more than once
at Broadwood already this season -- he gave Clyde an early lead which
they duly squandered. Vinnie Moore and Brian Bilsland hit back for Ayr's
second victory of the season.
East Fife again drew at home, and Berwick moved up to only a point
behind the leaders by crushing Stranraer 4-0 with three goals in the
last quarter, while Montrose hit back from 2-0 down to draw with
Stirling Albion.

HOLLAND, so vociferous in their prosecution of racism, have now become
the accused in a highly embarrassing affair.
Three coaches, dismissed from clubs in Egypt, returned home and were
fiercely critical in the media of their playing staffs.
Comments ranged from ''lazy, stupid, untrustworthy'' to ''the results
of malformed sperm.''
When the attacks from Theo Verlangen, Neol de Ruiten, and Cor Pot were
reproduced back in Egypt, they provoked widespread anger.
The newspaper Al-Aharar-Al-Riyadi raised an action for defamation
against the Egyptian race and it will be heard in court on November 29.
The Egyptian FA have reported the trio to FIFA and called for a
worldwide ban.
A spokesman said yesterday: ''These remarks were hugely insulting. We
are not prepared to accept such racial abuse and there should be no
place within football for the people responsible.''
Altogether it has not been a good week for the Dutch. Arie Haan will
appear before a court in Rotterdam tomorrow to defend an action by his
former employers, PAOK Saloniki, that he broke his contract to accept
the post at Feyenoord.
The Greeks are demanding that Haan should be ordered to return to
Saloniki or pay #220,000 compensation.
Meanwhile, Leo Beenhakker has been forced to admit defeat at
Istanbulspor, where there were towering ambitions to dominate Turkish
football. Seven defeats in eight games changed that perspective.
His departure places in doubt the future of his two countrymen, Peter
van Vossen and John van den Brom, imported at great cost to
Istanbulspor.
0 While Juventus are being hailed in some parts as a team of supermen
after their victory over Rangers, Marco van Basten believes his former
team, AC Milan, will dominate in Italy this season.
''The arrival of George Weah has made the difference,'' van Basten
argued. ''He is the striker Milan have been looking for since I was
injured.
''He is the best attacker in the world and I would have loved to play
alongside such a talent.''
Spartak Vladikavkaz were yesterday confirmed as the new champions of
Russia ahead of Moscow clubs, who filled the next five places in the
league.

ALBION Rovers fans have to be able to take the rough with the rougher.
Hopes of a hat trick of wins had been dashed by East Stirlingshire the
previous week and poor old Rovers found high-scoring Caley Thistle in
merciless mood on Saturday.
The Inverness team led 6-0 at half-time thanks to an Iain Stewart hat
trick, Colin Mitchell's double, and one from David Ross. Rovers' John
Gallagher, just back after suspension, was sent off after only 13
minutes for the hand-ball penalty that let Stewart open the scoring. But
the visitors' 10 men kept the score-sheet blank after the break and
grabbed a consolation through Alex McEwan.
'Shire secured their second win in a row, with a Murray Hunter double
in a 3-1 home victory over Cowdenbeath.
Livingston marched on, Jason Young's early goal -- his tenth of the
campaign -- being enough despite a Queen's Park fightback at Hampden.
Brechin lost ground, edged out 3-2 by Alloa, while Ross County moved up
through a 2-1 win to end Arbroath's seven-game unbeaten run.

A REPORT from referee supervisor Kenny Hope will decide the fate of
Hearts' forward Alan Lawrence after he clashed in an off-the-ball
incident with Rangers' defender Craig Moore, leaving the young
Australian lying on the ground clutching his face.
Referee Mike Pocock from Aberdeen waved on the Ibrox physio when play
had ended following Oleg Salenko's fourth goal but he refused to consult
his linesman as Rangers' players protested furiously. Keeper Andy Goram,
who raced from goal to make his feelings known, was yellow carded for
his trouble.
The Hearts' player, however, escaped although the clear indications
were that he had elbowed Moore in the face as the pair went for a
through ball.
Television cameras missed the incident, too, but it would be
surprising if the experienced supervisor also failed to see what
happened.
This clash occurred in the general area of the Ibrox pitch where the
now-infamous Duncan Ferguson head butt took place. That was spotted by
the supervisor who, on that day, would have had the same vantage point
as Mr Hope.
It may seem wrong to Hearts that, while the referee took no action,
their player -- banned from discussing the clash -- may find himself in
trouble.
But with the Ferguson affair, the Scottish Football Association
released the genies from the bottle by over-ruling the match official
that day. Now they are left to contemplate a future where the referee's
decision is never again going to be final despite what the Laws of the
Game may tell us.
It will be interesting to see the outcome once Hope's report reaches
Park Gardens.

MURRAY Fraser, the 24-year-old Stirling County player sent off for
head-butting, has received a six-week ban but his club are unhappy with
the way the affair has been handled by the Scottish Rugby Union.
Fraser appeared before a disciplinary panel at Murrayfield on Thursday
night but, according to County president Bill Gibson, neither the club
nor the player have yet received official notification of the sentence.
''We were told by an SRU committee man on Saturday what the sentence
was but have heard nothing at all from Murrayfield. As an exercise in
public relations it leaves a lot to be desired.
''The disciplinary system is wrong,'' said Gibson yesterday.
Yesterday, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said that the result of the
hearing had been sent to the player, the referee, and his club on Friday
afternoon.
Fraser, an under-18 and under-19 cap, who returned to Scotland this
season after a spell in New Zealand, maintains that the clash of heads
with Heriot's centre Tony Glasgow was accidental and his dismissal by
referee David Girdwood came after the intervention of a touch-judge.
The six-week ban -- of which Murray has already served three weeks --
is relatively light considering the 16-week ''stamping'' ban handed out
to Kelso prop Darren Howlett earlier this season.
Nevertheless, the affair highlights once again the unsatisfactory
nature of Murrayfield disciplinary proceedings. The issue is one of
public accountability.
SRU policy is that disciplinary adjudications are a matter for the
Union, the player, his club, and the referee, and no public announcement
is necessary. However, in the game's new high-profile era, that policy
is becoming less sustainable.
County coach Brian Edwards said yesterday: ''I don't see any good
reason for keeping these things secret. We're involved in a serious game
here and their decisions should be made public.''

TO his fellow-professionals he is known as ''Jackpot''; this is
because his eyes are inclined to flicker before settling like lemons in
a fruit machine. Well, yesterday, indeed for the whole of the last week,
Andrew Coltart struck gold.
The slim 25-year-old from Dumfries -- ''I have seen more meat on a
butcher's pencil'', growled a defeated foe -- has been the rock of
Scotland in the Dunhill Cup.
And he loved every moment of it. Coltart stood on the edge of the
eighteenth green draped in a St Andrew's Cross as the first-ever
Scottish Dunhill victory was clinched.
''I have had this flag since the Grand Slam rugby game with England
last year,'' he explained. ''We lost that day but I was determined to do
better this time and it was in my bag all week.
''Ever since last year I have been waiting for the Dunhill to come
round. I knew, with Colin and Sam playing so well, we had to have our
best chance for years.''
Yet Coltart almost eclipsed his more senior team-mates, Torrance and
Montgomerie, who were quick to shower him with praise. ''The boy did
good,'' joked Torrance. ''We could not have asked for more from him, he
was quite exceptional,'' commented Montgomerie.
''Being part of a team with these fellows is definitely a learning
process,'' admitted Coltart, ''and the experience of this week will
stand me in good stead for the future.''
He is 6ft 1ins tall, a natural athlete who likes water sports as well.
His deep-voiced, side-of-the-mouth delivery reminds one of Sean Connery
and he puts away opponents like James Bond. His only defeat during the
competition was by the World No.2, Ernie Els of South Africa, on
Saturday. ''I tried to play the man instead of the course in that match
which was a mistake.''
Otherwise, as he was in this competition last year when he won all
three of his matches, Coltart has been invincible.
He was Scottish Boys' champion at 16 and his distinguished amateur
career included Walker Cup and Eisenhower Trophy appearances. After
turning pro in 1991, this stylish swinger, who loves to play quickly,
was twice back at the qualifying school; doubts were raised about his
temperament. Not any more.
Former Open champion Nick Price, of Zimbabwe, paid the young Scot this
compliment: ''I am convinced he has the ability to be one of the top
professionals in the world. The only thing he has not done this week is
to run off with my wife.''

THREE distinct generations of Scottish professionals yesterday
triumphantly trod where none of their predecessors in 10 attempts were
able to go. Sam Torrance, aged 42, Colin Montgomerie, 10 years his
junior, and Andrew Coltart, who is 25, won the Alfred Dunhill Cup at St
Andrews when the team, seeded fourth, beat Zimbabwe, who were third, 2-1
in the final.
Coltart beat Tony Johnstone by four strokes with a 67, five under the
par of the Old Course, and Sam Torrance's 68 bettered Mark McNulty's
score by two strokes in the medal matchplay tournament over 18 holes.
Nick Price's 68, his fifth score in as many rounds below 70, was too
good for Montgomerie by six strokes.
Coltart, who carried a Saltire flag in his golf bag all week, proudly
waved this souvenir from a rugby international on the steps below the
Royal and Ancient's clubhouse as Torrance, who holed the winning putt in
the 1985 Ryder Cup match, made the formal tap-in which earned #100,000
for each of the side.
In the semi-final round Scotland, for the fourth time in four
meetings, beat Ireland, also by the odd game in three, as did Zimbabwe
over Spain. Their eventual consolation was prize-money of #50,000 each,
whereas each of the losing semi-finalists had to be content with #31,666
to take from the scene of battle.
Torrance, who captained the side, said: ''This is the proudest moment
of my life, to win at St Andrews after 11 years. This must be what it's
like to win a major.'' Then he jokingly added: ''It's very similar to
the Ryder Cup experience -- except we got paid this time.''
Remarking that each player had won four out of five games, Montgomerie
said: ''It was a total team performance, just as it was in the Ryder Cup
match. We all played great golf, but especially Andrew.'' Coltart, in
only his third full professional season, had the best aggregate of the
three, nine under par.
Not only that, but the Dumfries-born golfer had the fifth hole in one
of his career, when he made a No.6-iron shot at the 178-yard eighth, the
ball pitching some 15 feet short before it ran in. That single shot
instantly increased Coltart's lead over Johnstone from one stroke to
three.
Out in 32, Coltart was undisturbed when, at the tenth, Johnstone, from
20 feet, followed in his putt for a birdie 3 from 25 feet. In less
dreich but more breezy conditions than in the morning, Coltart moved so
competently to his fifth win in six games in two of these tournaments
that only Johnstone's closing birdie 3 outscored him.
A delighted Coltart said: ''I started the season well but then lost
confidence. However, over the last month I've been playing better and I
started holing some putts. I've been coming to St Andrews for years and
I always love returning.'' His prize compared more than favourably with
his previous best, the #33,500 he earned for having finished second in
the Catalan Open in April.
Torrance improved on his semi-final score by no fewer than six strokes
and did not enjoy the satisfaction of leading at any stage yesterday
until the twelfth hole against McNulty. He then gained three strokes in
succession, first holing from 10 feet for a birdie and then, after
McNulty had driven into trouble at the next, reached the 567-yard
fourteenth with two thunderous blows.
Again McNulty won the last with a birdie 3 to lend more respectability
to the margin, but by then Scotland, who had lost in three semi-finals
and twice in the final in 1987 and 1992, on both occasions to England,
were secure in the objective of having their name engraved on the trophy
for the first time.
Price began to tighten his grip when Montgomerie leaked his second
shot at the long fifth into an unplayable lie, a mistake which cost him
a double bogey 7 to Price's birdie. Price also birdied the next, from 18
feet, but with another of those violent swings commonly associated with
this format Montgomerie retrieved two strokes with a birdie to a bogey
at the seventh. However, that was the extent of Montgomerie's revival.
Montgomerie disclosed that the persistent pain in his left wrist was
''not good''. He will consult a specialist today, but intends to compete
in this week's Volvo Masters, the season's final tournament, which will
decide the winner of the European Order of Merit between himself,
Torrance, and Germany's Bernhard Langer.
Scotland had defeated Ireland in all three of the countries' meetings,
twice by 3-0 and once by the same result this team achieved in mild but
depressingly wet conditions. It was the strength of the finishing
touches applied first by Coltart and then Montgomerie that enabled
Torrance's defeat to be discounted.
Montgomerie, whose match with Darren Clarke had gone through the first
game at the sixth, where Coltart lost a ball, had played better than his
score of two under after 12 holes. However, three putts from long range
at the thirteenth and Clarke's 10-foot birdie putt at the next expunged
Montgomerie's two-stroke advantage.
Crucially at the sixteenth, Montgomerie holed from 20 feet for a
birdie, whereas Clarke missed from 12, and when the Scot had holed from
seven feet for his 4 at the seventeenth, where Clarke's attempt for par
from 10 feet hit the hole, his advantage was restored. Ireland's hopes
finally perished in the Valley of Sin into which first Clarke's and
Philip Walton's pitches fell back.
Long after his midsaventure at the sixth, Coltart found himself two
behind Walton with four to play, but he turned that into a winning
margin by holing from five feet to birdie the fifteenth and taking the
next two as well, both in par, as Walton took three putts from the front
of the sixteenth green and was twice in rough at the next.
A first-time winner was further assured with Zimbabwe's 2-1 win over
Spain, like Ireland unseeded. McNulty was never threatened after he led
by four strokes after only three holes and apparently had won by five
strokes over Ignacio Garrido, although in the event the young Spaniard
was disqualified for having signed an incorrect scorecard.
The two other games took very different routes. Price was two behind
Jose Rivero after six holes but played the remaining 12 in four under,
even saving par at the seventeenth where his Road Bunker recovery was
stunned by the flagstick to prevail by a stroke. By contrast Johnstone,
three ahead of Miguel Angel Jiminez at the same stage, lost by a stroke
when he covered the last 12 in three over.
