THE gnomes in the garden of retired miner Gordon Archibald have been
enjoying the fine summer weather.
Gordon, who makes and paints most of his many gnomes himself, takes
them in for the winter.
He gets a great deal of satisfaction from his hobby and enjoys the
comments from passers-by in Falcon Road West, Edinburgh.
It saddens him when his creations are stolen or damaged, as sometimes
happens.
Theresa encourages him to patch them up and put them out again because
of the many children who would miss their summertime friends.

' FAIRIES at the bottom of your
gardens now that can be difficult. But a few gnomess that's no big
problem. You'll find those friendly figures of fun at you local garden
centre. Or you can make them yourself with moulds from a craft shop and
paint them in the colours of your choice.
'IF you consider little chaps with white beards and funny hats just
too naff, then plant your favourite cartoon characters in that dull,
damp corner where nothing but moss grows.
'YOU might prefer to see some colourful wildlife or domestic pets
patrolling your lawn and flower beds. You could have a whole zoo without
ever being kept awake by barnyard noises or having need of a
pooper-scooper.
'THERE is one problem to watch out for - the nocturnal gnome snatcher.
An open-front garden can prove an irresistible invitation to these
pests. There's not a lot you can do to foil them, but you could try the
Gnome Guards.

As thousands gather to witness the majestic sight of tall ships
sailing into the Firth of Forth this weekend,
Michael Roberts salutes a century-old poetic genius inspired by the
romance and misery of life at sea.
ONE summer's day afloat in the Firth of Clyde, a sail-loving uncle of
mine pointed to a huge four-masted barque in the offing, most likely a
grain-ship, and told me that I was not often going to see such a sight.
That was in the middle of the 1930s.
In my child's mind I assumed that ''not often'' meant ''sometimes''
and that four-masted sailing-ships, deferring slightly to a stiff
breeze, would always be part of life, along with the huge liners, such
as the Queen Mary at that time recently launched.
This weekend, when I stand on the promenade or a local rooftop at
Portobello, binoculars in hand, I shall be joining in the delight of
thousands of other enthusiasts as we all try to get a sight of the Tall
Ships arriving in the Firth of Forth and, later, making their way past
Inchkeith for the start of their race. At the same time I shall be
celebrating, inwardly, an obscure but gloriously important centenary.
It was in 1895 that a boy of 16, not at all in the best of health,
deliberately deserted his ship, the barque Bidston Hill, in New York in
order to become a writer. By so doing he also cut himself off from his
family back in England, especially the kind but philistine
stepmother-aunt who had effectively forced him to train for the sea in
the first place.
That youth was John Masefield, known to the generations who are now of
bus-pass age and far beyond it for two short poems which formed part of
the routine stuff set for learning by heart in schools of all kinds. But
neither Cargoes nor Sea Fever hints at anything of the harsh reality
which Masefield abandoned 100 years ago and to which he had the toughest
of introductions when on a 100-day voyage as an apprentice on board the
full-rigged ship Gilcruix taking briquettes of coal-dust from South
Wales to Chile.
That voyage, which took place during the year before his act of
desertion, certainly included experiences that Masefield found
exhilarating. But he had to endure sea-sickness, sunstroke, bad food,
unpleasant company, and a quite unusually long and dangerous rounding of
Cape Horn. This alone took 30 days, amid gigantic seas, icebergs,
driving snow, and ice on deck and in rigging.
All through that period, Masefield was so cold that he could not undo
the buttons of his oilskins and remained soaked to the skin not only at
his place of duty, 160 feet up in the mizzenmast, but also when sleeping
in his bunk. The bows of the Gilcruix were stove in, and it was a
miracle that she ever reached Iquique,her port of destination.
If the future poet had neither sailed on the Gilcruix nor deserted the
Bidston Hill, we should never have had the magnificent narrative of near
epic size which Masefield published in 1912, Dauber: A Poem.
A budding artist gets a job as the ship's painter on board a
full-rigged ship, in order to study the real as well as the romantic
features of life at sea. The 50 pages of seven-line stanzas tell of the
ugliness as well as the beauty, the sufferings as well as the joys. It
is a thrilling and a moving work, and all the more so since we know that
virtually everything in it is about Masefield himself and his time on
the Gilcruix.
During the 60 years that have passed since my uncle's prediction, he
has proved to have been all too right, because in all that time I have
never seen a barque or a full-rigged ship at sea.
In 1995, I have already begun to re-read Dauber, and that will be my
celebration of the courage of a teenager of a century ago. And I am sure
that there will be the viewing of plenty of ships and barques to
compensate for their absence from my sight for so many years.

Rowing home to haven in sunny Palestine,
With a cargo of ivory,
And apes and peacocks,

Dipping through the Tropics by the palm-green shores,
With a cargo of diamonds,

Butting through the Channel in the mad March days,
With a cargo of Tyne coal,

* ON New Year's Day 1960, Battlefield-born Jim Ford took his
girlfriend Juliet to Hampden Park to watch Queen's Park play Third
Lanark. It was a dismal day. The match was dreadful, the cold rain
poured and, as they missed their bus home, Jim said to Juliet: ''Let's
get out of here.''
Having just graduated from Glasgow University as a chartered
accountant, he was well equipped for jobs he saw advertised in France.
Within weeks of deciding to quit Scotland, he got a post with Price
Waterhouse in Paris. ''It was a superb time there, at the height of
post-war recovery,'' he recalls. ''Paris had a real buzz.''
Jim and Juliet married and, three years later while still at Price
Waterhouse, he was asked to find a financial director for Courvoisier.
''When their man said they were seeking someone with my qualifications
there was a pause, then he said: 'I don't suppose you'd consider it?' I
did more than that -- I accepted.''
The Fords relocated close to the HQ of the ''cognac of Napoleon'' in
Jarnac, about 80 miles north of Bordeaux. And apart from a 12 years with
Courvoisier's parent company in Canada, they have been there ever since,
with Jim rising meanwhile to president of the company. Their four
grown-up children are bilingual. Juliet is an interior decorator, with
three shops. They live in a very French, traditional 1860s home but
celebrate the fact that Jarnac is twinned with Dalkeith in Midlothian.
Indeed, they are in constant touch with Scots friends, relatives and
news, and his career always ensured a continuing link with Scotland --
especially when chairman of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association in
1990. But now Jim has just retired, and he and Juliet have chosen to
stay in their adopted land. After 30 years with Courvoisier, they find
they just can't leave their gentle Jarnac.
''Retirement is a time for familiarity and friends,'' says Jim.
''There's more space, more room to live here than in Britain, both
physically and in society. Jarnac is a very close community that looks
after its own people. It's also only three hours by train to Paris, has
frequent plane services, offers easy access to Spain and Switzerland, is
not on most tourist routes -- and best of all, has good weather!''

* KING HENRI IV of Navarre was the first of the Bourbons, but he much
preferred a shot of Armagnac. Anyway, the point is this: when he went to
visit his mistress Gabrielle at her Paris home, a second coach tagged
along behind him, bringing a chef who was keeping the partridges hot.
Why partridges, you ask? The fact is that birds were thought to be a
good aphrodisiac for women, although French men were supposed to get
their hit from stags' testicles and that sort of thing. On one occasion,
it says here, and believe it or not as you please, Gabrielle was not
responding to the partridges and therefore not to Henri. Something was
afoot (un pied).
Listening a bit harder, Henri could discern the sound of heavy
breathing from under the bed. Sacre rouge! That explained it. Gabrielle
had been exerting herself in his absence. Showing great kingly wisdom,
he reached down with a partridge for the hidden gentleman of the
bedchamber, who must have been hungry, and said no more about it.
I know this happened 400 years ago but, if you are considering that
French style for your kitchen, boudoir, salle a manger etc, you ought to
know something about the environment you are creating. You are stepping
into deep waters, my friend. If you are about to drop Euro-scepticism
and adopt French decor (the very word is French), plus investing in some
champagne and Chablis, you'd better be ready for what it brings on.
We did mention aphrodisiacs, I believe? The French have never
discounted them. You may, for example, pondering in your new Gallic
kitchen, consider producing a pot of bouillabaisse in the style of
Marseilles. Having been to the local co-op for your crayfish, rascasse,
crabs, sea-spiders, saffron and fennel -- which, of course, you will
find readily available -- you will then want to mix the aphrodisiacal
trigger. This is the rouille of olive oil, garlic, paprika, black
pepper, and breadcrumbs, which has been dumped into the middle of the
soup. Without it, the soup will not work: your kitchen will be less
French than you thought. You have to remember it was Venus, exhausted by
a fling with Mars, who passed on this powerful recipe to the French,
having presumably had enough of Romans for the time being.
But to make use of your French kitchen properly, you should try a
straightforward come-on like cardamom syrup. Ingredients: cardamom,
nettle-seed, cinnamon, root ginger, honey and sea splurge (ask at your
local co-op). Pour it over peaches or apricots. Eat. But if a partner is
''unavailable'' at the time, as in the case of certain film actors it
would be inadvisable to name, you would be better to stick to mince. The
French word for it is hachis followed by a deep sigh.

ABERFORTH Split Level Trust, which invests in smaller companies, has
prospered by investing more heavily in firms at the larger end of the
range.
Total return of the #88.5m trust was 10.1% in the year to June 30,
more than double the 4.4% of its benchmark Extended Hoare Govett Smaller
Companies index (excluding investment trusts).
But the performance of smaller companies lagged behind those of larger
firms. The FTSE All-Share index achieved a total return of 15.9% over
the same period.
John Evans, a partner of Aberforth fund managers of Edinburgh, said
the trust had benefited from a shift in its portfolio towards larger
companies with a market capitalisation of #150m to #250m.
These firms had generally outperformed companies at the smaller end of
the range and now accounted for 25% of the trust's total investments, up
from 10% a year ago, he said.
Aberforth Split Level Trust, which offers both capital and income
shares, announced a 1.8% rise in the full dividend to 8.6p.
In addition it will pay a special 1.5p dividend to holders of income
shares as a result of a change in accounting policy to an ex-dividend
basis.
There was a 11% fall in the net asset value of the trust's income
shares to 10.6p. The NAV of its capital shares rose 5.4% to 274.7p.
* COMPOSITE insurance group Legal &amp; General suffered a slide in life
assurance and pension premiums in the first half of the year after a
dent in confidence towards the financial services industry.
New premiums in the UK tumbled to #88m from #102.3m in the first half
of last year, a trend which is likely to be repeated by others in the
industry.
UK annual premiums were #61.5m, down from #71.1m last year.
However, group pension annual premiums had been more resilient.
British unit trust sales plunged to #24.6m from #74.7m last year. The
decline reflected the trend of consumers shifting their funds from
share-based products following the fall in value of the stock markets in
1994.
L&amp;G shares dipped 10p to 556p.

* RESEARCH chemists at Aberdeen University are hoping to develop
completely new methods of delivering drugs and vaccines.
The team at the department of chemistry has joined Bioscience company
Quadrant (Cambridge) UK to develop new drug-delivery systems for
administering medicines which are not only indefinitely stable, but can
be designed to allow the release of controlled doses at pre-set
intervals.
The technology could be used to vaccinate infants against the common
childhood diseases using a single injection with a cocktail of vaccines.
At the moment, conventional techniques require often painful
injections. But using the university's expertise in drug encapsulation
and solid-state chemistry, booster jabs could become extinct.
The market for alternative drug-delivery systems is expected to be in
the multi-billions by the turn of the century, giving the partnership
huge commercial possibilities.

Joe Donnelly has the inside story on technology helping to ease dental
patients' fears
THE old cliche about dentists always looking down in the mouth may be
true. It's a hazard of the profession. But now patients can be as glum,
if not glummer, than their dental practitioner, by using Virtual Reality
to see what's going on in their own molar department. And looking down
in the mouth might actually cheer them up.
Lloyd Jerome, of the Dental Practice in Glasgow's Virginia Street, is
a pioneer of the VR technology, and he boldly takes his patients where
they have never gone before, on a tour around their own mouths.
Using a Virtual Reality headset visor and an intra-oral camera, Lloyd
is able to show his patients what's needs done, in full colour, tooth by
tooth.
''When they are having a check-up, they can see what I see, via the VR
set. I can point out what needs to be done, and even show them places
where they should brush a bit more carefully,'' he says. ''Most people
go to the dentist for a check-up, spend a few minutes in the chair, then
they are given another appointment. There is a discontinuity of service,
and of course, they have to take the dentist's word that they actually
need the treatment. With this system, I can show them a crack or where a
filling is needed and make them realise it is not wise to leave the
situation for any length of time.
''The patient gets to see everything in much more detail than ever
previously possible. People are fascinated when shown the one place that
was in one sense, closed to them before, the inside of their own mouth.
''We can get a 40-times magnification which is very helpful to me too.
I can use the screen to get a finer detail than is possible even on a
close examination.''
Lloyd recognises that some people are less than keen on a
speleological travelogue of their own cavities, and some would rather
leave plaque to an expert's attack.
''If they are not interested in seeing what's happening on the inside,
they can lie back and enjoy another kind of show altogether. At the
flick of a switch, I can show them a film or video through the visor,
and naturally they have a wide selection to suit their own interests. In
our library we have Absolutely Fabulous, Eddie Izzard Live, feature
films and cartoons.
''Most patients are quite surprised to be able to watch a film while
at the dentists, and of course, the advantage is that they don't have to
talk too much. The films take their mind off what's happening.''
Lloyd believes his is the first practice in the UK to use Virtual
Reality, an idea he picked up in the United States. The vision headset,
made in Washington, cost #1500 to buy and import.
''It's been a great success,'' he says. ''About two-thirds of my
patients use the system and I've found it a great benefit to people who
are dentally phobic. It relaxes them and distracts their attention just
enough to help cure them of long-held fear of dental treatment.
''And for the others, especially people who are in for a particularly
long session, the films and videos help the time pass much more quickly.
They really can relax and enjoy the show.''
Sounds like the ideal solution to those dentists who insist on asking
complex questions which require long answers . . . when your mouth is
full of cotton pads.
And Virtual Reality is all very well, and it sounds like a dandy idea.
But I'll be better convinced when my dentist can guarantee me virtual
injections, virtual drilling, and virtual pain . . . the kind you can
kill at the flick of a switch.

Leila Aitken has some bright ideas that look as good as they feel
* IF you are still searching for just the exact shade of curtain
fabric to match a new carpet, or if you cannot find the right scatter
cushions, there is a way out of your dilemma -- paint them yourself.
Painting on silk is fast becoming a popular art form. Although it
isn't new -- the earliest silk wall hangings date back to the Chou
dynasty, one thousand years BC -- the high quality of the latest silk
paints on the market has brought an upsurge of interest. Previously,
good quality silk paints had to be ''fixed'' by chemicals or by steaming
the fabric, but the latest paints by Javana and Deka simply need to be
pressed with a hot iron to give permanent, brilliant colours.
The combination of silk -- a lustrous draping fabric, with bright,
glowing colours adds a distinctive and individual touch to any room.
Unlike ordinary fabric painting, where the paint sits on top of the
material, the silk fibres absorb the paints totally. Hand-painted silk
looks wonderful used for cushions, curtains, pictures, and firescreens.
My first attempt was a cushion cover using Habutai silk and a few
Javana silk paints -- pink, blue, and yellow (which I combined to make
green). I didn't even have a brush. To begin with, small rolls of cotton
wool held with clothes pegs are all you need to paint large areas. But
you will need a frame to hold the fabric tightly stretched. Special silk
painting frames are available, but a tapestry frame will do, or make
your own from four slats of wood nailed at the corners to form a
rectangle a little smaller than your piece of silk.
Pin the silk to the frame all round the outside edges, using drawing
pins. You will have to devise some method of keeping the silk away from
the table below, by supporting the frame edges on blocks or putting a
long screw at each corner to raise it from the table.
The silk paints spread in the fabric, more so if the fabric is wet.
For the cushion cover I first dampened the silk with water, using cotton
wool. Then I added random splodges of paint, in different colours. After
allowing the colours to seep into the fabric I sprinkled sea-salt
crystals in some areas and left the whole thing overnight to dry. In the
morning the salt had absorbed some of the colour and displaced it in
other parts, leaving satisfying white splodges and attractive colour
separation. The results you can see in the foreground of the photograph.
Because the paint spreads in the silk it isn't quite as easy to paint
a specific design, but there are several ways of doing this. A sticky
substance known as ''Gutta-percha'' can be painted on the silk to
prevent the spread of paint. Both long scarves in the photograph were
done in this way, first applying the gutta, allowing it to dry
completely before blocking in the different colours. Once dry the silk
is washed and the gutta dissolves leaving the original colour of the
silk to show through.
The shoulder bag is made of Noil silk, which absorbs the colour
quickly. The sunflower design was outlined lightly in pencil and then
painted as for a watercolour, lightest colours first, building up to the
darker shades.
Paint on silk has endless possibilities. A Complete Guide to Silk
Painting by Susanne Hahn is an excellent book on the subject and
Painting Flowers on Silk by Lydie Ottelart gives step-by-step designs
for pictures, cushions, and scarves. Both are published by Search Press.

THE first clear evidence of sex differences in the functional
organisation of the brain for language, has been reported by a team of
researchers at Yale University School of Medicine.
Using magnetic resonance imaging to study brain-wave patterns, men and
women performed tasks related to language processing, specifically tasks
tapping the cognitive processes used in reading.
During one of these tasks, a phonological exercise involving rhyming,
very different brain activation patterns were observed.
In males, brain activity was lateralised to left inferior frontal
gyrus regions; in females the pattern of activation was very different,
engaging more diffuse neural systems involving both the left and right
inferior frontal gyrus.
During this project, Yale researchers used functional magnetic
resonance imaging, a sophisticated method to measure changes in brain
blood flow and oxygen using special MRI. ''Using this strategy, we have
demonstrated remarkable differences in the functional organisation of a
specific component of language, phonological processing, between normal
men and women,'' the paediatric neurologists say.
In other words, women's brains work differently, when they're talking.
Some men think they disengage altogether, but we don't agree with that.
Now for some similarity between the sexes.
Researchers at Georgetown University Centre have identified a protein
complex that occurs naturally in both the testes and ovaries and is
capable of stimulating the steroid synthesis needed for reproduction.
Researchers hope their discovery could be used to design new treatments
for male and female infertility.
Steroid production is controlled primarily by the pituitary gland, but
for more than a decade researchers have known there is a local ''back
up'' mechanism in the gonad itself that stimulates steroid production
independent of the pituitary gland. The protein complex is believed to
have the potential to treat such conditions as low sperm count or
recurrent pregnancy loss caused by defects in progesterone production.
WHAT would our hi-tech world be like if it wasn't for the old Scots
who really did push back the frontiers?
It wouldn't be hi-tech for a start, as will no doubt be explained at
the Royal Society in Edinburgh on July 20 and 21. Scotland's
Mathematical Heritage Meeting organised by the RS, the Edinburgh
Mathematical Society and the British Society for the History of
Mathematics is designed to raise awareness of the enormous contribution
Scots have made during the past few centuries.
The meeting will cover the great Scots who really counted, so to
speak. Napier, inventor of Logarithms, simplified calculation so much
that without his efforts, the fast calculations needed in space travel,
biology, chemistry and physics, would not be possible.
Clerk Maxwell's revolutionary theories on electro-magnetism made
possible almost every electrical and electronic appliance, from
computers to electrical engines, hi-fi, radio and television.
Lord Kelvin, who among other things pioneered transatlantic cables,
built analogue computers. His experiments on fluid mechanics and
aerodynamics led to great strides in the development of aviation,
shipbuilding and even oil production.
Robert Simson's studies of Greek methods of geometry are still the
foundation stone of today's geometric calculations and designs, and the
principles are used in computer imaging. Colin MacLaurin was the father
of the pension fund, using maths to work out benefits or widows and
orphans as far back as the Jacobite rebellion.
These and other greats of the Scots maths pioneers will be the stars
of next week's meeting. Advance booking is essential from the Royal
Society.

TWO solutions in one, that's the IBM Thinkpad 701. The Big Blue wanted
to make a notebook as small as, well, a notebook. The problem is that
people's fingers are too big for the tiny keyboards.
The answer? A notebook computer with a revolutionary keyboard that
actually stretches to comfortable width. The machine is smaller than the
width of an A4 sheet, lees than 10 inches at its widest. When it opens,
the two keypad halves spread and interlock to form a full-size keyboard.
The screen is full colour, has the new IBM trackpoint feature for
moving the cursor, and has built-in infra-red to print or send files to
other machines with no wires or cable connections.
Weighing in at only 2kg, the Thinkpad boasts up to 75MHz speed, up to
8mb of standard memory, full 16-bit sound, removable hard drives with up
to a vast 720meg capacity, standard external diskette drive and card
ports. As they say, good gear comes in small bulk. Approaches are even
now being made to Santa Claus.
GLASGOW-based audio-visual communications firm SSK has added a
multi-media production facility to its service range. The company plans
to develop its system for sales and marketing presentations including
multi-media kiosks and portable demonstrations.
Project leader Marcus Cent says: ''Our multi-media will be offered
alternatives to traditional audio-visual services or to complement
existing material.'' By taking advantage of substantial archives of film
video and slides, SSK hopes to reduce the long development times
normally involved in creating all the materials at the start of a
project.
* VIS in Dundee is developing a series of interactive systems for the
Scottish Tourist industry. The development includes new visitor
information terminals at Glasgow Airport, a children's cartoon adventure
system using computer animation, and a multi-seat ride for the new
Tourist Orientation Centre in Aviemore.
Managing director Chris van der Kuyl says the firm will focus on the
entertainment market in the coming year, with a number of hi-tech
projects in the pipeline. VIS was the first Scots company to develop a
complete CDi production in two info terminals for the Scotch Whisky
Heritage Centre in Edinburgh. It also designed a CDi software package to
teach deaf people to communicate in foreign languages.
* AT&amp;T Global's recent move to Dunfermline is aimed at keeping the
company at the forefront of consumer interactive machines. The St
David's Bay plant is producing what AT&amp;T describes as the world's
leading interactive marketing terminal. Using one of six languages,
customers can use the terminal to browse through an electronic catalogue
of more than 350 types of products. Goods are paid for at the kiosk by
credit card and then delivered to any one of 30 countries, ideal for
tourists who don't want to lug bagpipes or cases of Scotch home. The
company has made two dozen machines for Galleria 21, and plans to expand
the concept throughout the UK.
* SET-TOP box designer Online Media is to work with the US educational
firm The Lightspan Partnership to supply its second generation units.
Online media's digital set-top box will include an integral CD drive,
yet still be able to connect with interactive cable technologies as they
become available. Using the units, Lifespan plans to bridge the gap
between home and school, allowing parents to follow children's progress
and become more actively involved.
* THE use of computers in learning at Strathclyde University is being
encouraged by cash from the Strategic Fund. Project DISTIL --
Dissemination of Teaching and Learning Technology -- aims to help
academic staff develop computer-based material into their courses. A new
service providing computer-assisted learning at Strathclyde and anywhere
else has been set up on the World Wide Web.
* MIST -- modular investigations into science and technology -- has
been adapted for interactive CD. Already an acclaimed curricular
resource, the Philips MIST system is an educational tool that plugs into
any TV, delivering sound, pictures, text, and animation. Available on 6
CDi discs, the program is made up of 250 chapters, almost six hours of
video, plus printed teachers' support material, and is linked directly
to the Scottish curriculum. Just released, the Sci-tech comes out at #99
for any two discs.
* JVC has just launched a new large-screen multi-format colour
monitor. Adopting a superflat CRT screen and a compact cabinet, JVC says
the monitor will suit a variety of presentation applications from staked
displays to conferences. Targeted at organisations with hi-tech display
presentations, the system comes in at #1695 plus VAT.
* SCIENTISTS at Aberdeen University have won a massive research grant
to find ways of detecting and cleaning up dangerous chemicals in the
environment.
The #875,000 grant is funded from money from the Biotech and Biology
and the Engineering Sciences research councils, and cash from the
University's two industrial collaborators, Axis Genetics and Guildhay
Ltd.
Running for three years, the project will build on work already done
by the University's Molecular and Cell Biology group, a major lab
devoted to engineering antibodies for the monitoring and removal of
organic pollutants from the environment. It is this that researchers
believe is possibly the greatest global problem for the next decade.
Genetics professor Bill Harris says that toxic pollutants can lead to
cancers and birth defects, a problem not acute in Scotland, but severe
in other parts of the globe.
''We are focusing on the detection of pesticides and herbicides and to
do this we are developing new methods which could be used worldwide,''
he said.
* MORTAL Kombat, was one game that stood out from the rest, not only
for the breath-taking digitised graphics, but for the abundant blood,
gore and occasional severed body part.
Now Mortal Kombat II has been unleashed to carno-fans, and it is
indeed a worthy sequel. To those unfamiliar with the game scene, MKII is
what a ''Beat-em-up'', two controllable figures which do just that to
each other to progress through the game. Sounds a little dull, but
strangely (and somewhat alarmingly) it's a very pleasurable experience
the first time you relieve a friend of his head.
Along with the basic punches, kicks and blocks there are some special
moves activated by complicated joystick combinations. While the original
game had seven characters, the sequel has 12 to choose from, including
three secret ones which pop up when you least expect them and do their
best to complicate matters.
The graphics are excellent, perfectly digitised actors in full 256
colours, pseudo texture mapped floors and, er, blood, gallons of it.
This is not for the faint, or weak hearted. The backgrounds are equally
impressive, many of them animate and are character-interactive. Sound is
top class and the gameplay is fluid and not at all robotic, unlike some
other recent games of this genre.
The version tested was run on a 486 but frankly the faster the better,
thankfully there is a facility to reduce the detail level for 386 (which
is the minimum required). Virgin offer an Amiga version too. The game
requires a VIA graphics driver or better and at least 512k (1/2 Meg) of
conventional memory. Most sound cards are supported.
The PC version of MKII is a virtually arcade perfect conversion,
something to impress your friends with until the next technically
advanced piece of software comes along. It's likely to keep gamers
challenged for at least a couple of months with its five difficulty
ratings ranging from very easy to pretty darned hard. All in all a top
class game, and , of course lots of blood.
Mortal Kombat II, Virgin, #30.

* WHY do the leaves of my blackcurrants turn brown and drop off? The
fruit is small and very poor.
* The problem is rust, a fungus disease spread by spores. To prevent
it, spray in April and May three or four times with a suitable
fungicide. After the fruit has been picked, use a liquid copper
fungicide. It is a seasonal problem and weakens bushes but does not kill
them.
* I HAVE a green privet hedge about 6ft high and 3ft wide. I let it
grow wild after I tried to trim it two years ago. As a result one
portion has died off, leaving a space in the hedge. What is the best way
to prune and groom my hedge?
* All plants -- even privet -- will react to harsh cutting, especially
at the wrong time of year, and if a dry spell follows. The rule is to go
for regular trimming. The blank bits need to be filled in with new
plants. Use cuttings 9-10ins long from mature wood taken in October. Put
them in sandy soil and leave them for a year or so.

GARDENERS hate weeds. It's official. In a discussion about pet hates
with a group of gardeners recently they came top of the list.
Particularly the obnoxious types like horsetail which spread
underground and pop up all over the place.
''Even in the greenhouse,'' as one gardener bemoaned.
It isn't even the appearance of the weed which makes it so unpopular,
it's the difficulty of trying to control it. Kill off surface growth,
and it looks as if you have it under control. Then up it comes,
somewhere else.
''I have even seriously thought of moving house to get away from it,''
said one gardener. ''I can't see any way of getting rid of it. My
neighbours don't seem too concerned, and it spreads in from their
place.''
I can sympathise. It must be very difficult indeed if you happen to
live near a railway embankment because horsetail was used to bind them
together.
Another shocking weed is Japanese bamboo, which has hollow stems and
invasive tendencies, and is particularly rife around coastal areas like
Kilcreggan.
I have seen it in many gardens in the West End of Glasgow as well.
Once it gets a grip it is a real menace. You may manage to control it
within your own domain, but it will soon come in from elsewhere.
Pet hate number two is lawn edging. You buzz round the garden with a
motor mower, but then comes the finicky job of doing the edges.
Another hate is watering plants. One gardener told me: ''It is a
no-win situation. I get up early on a sunny day and water all the
plants. Yet, when I come back, everything has wilted. My wife works too,
so there is no-one at hand to do the needful. Shading helps but it's not
the real answer. I suppose I'll have to invest in some kind of automatic
watering system.''

I MUST admit I am finding my new cordless multi-trimmer a great asset.
It is battery operated and does lawn edging like nobody's business.
It took a little while to get the hang of it, but now I can buzz round
the edges much quicker than when using shears.
Greenhouse benches are now often vacant, having been used for raising
vegetables such as tomatoes and bedding plants. The decision is whether
to continue using them for pot plants, but the pressure of other work
can make it tempting to leave them unused.
I will be filling up mine with a range of pot plants and I intend to
use capillary matting to alleviate watering.
If you don't want to run to the cost of this, folded newspapers are
fairly effective although not all that attractive. They hold moisture
and I have never had any damage from using them.
In addition to some form of matting, shading with netting or shading
material applied to the outside of the glass is effective.
There is a material called Vari-shade which you paint on the outside.
It is opaque when dry and transparent when wet, so that plants are not
deprived of light in dull weather.
Tomatoes should be cropping nicely by now. The problem can be fruit
splitting which makes them look unattractive, and is caused by
changeable weather and intermittent watering.

How the magnetism of France lured two Scots couples across the
Channel: Beverley Brown reports
* ASK Alister Rae for directions to his home in Provence and you're
likely to be told: ''Forty-five minutes from Chateauneuf du Pape, 20
minutes from Gigondas and 30 minutes from Beaumes de Venise.''
What you'd expect, really, from a man whose business is wine. But the
decision to buy and renovate a delapidated Provencal building on a site
which dates back to Roman times stems from a long-standing love affair
with the country.
Alister and his wife Elizabeth are both from the Borders town of
Peebles. Alister has always been interested in motor-racing, and they
used to drive to Monte Carlo each year to see the grand prix.
Alister's wine business grew from these trips. He is a director of
Peebles-based Villeneuve Wines, named after the French-Canadian racing
driver. Holidays in their favourite region, Provence, became the norm
and each summer they would rent a house in a different part of the
region.
''About three years ago we visited Vaison La Romaine, on the
North-Eastern edge close to the Baronnie mountains, and discovered the
authentic, old-world Provencal lifestyle that has remained untouched by
tourism,'' says Alister.
''We decided there and then to investigate the feasibility of buying a
property in the area and, with passable French, we visited a few local
estate agents.''
The Raes looked at several houses, searching for an old, traditional
home that needed restoring.
''Eventually we found one in the tiny village of Mollans on the river
Ouveze, situated in the foothills of Mont Ventoux about 13km from Vaison
La Romaine and 45 minutes drive from Avignon.
''The village is a conservation area, with no modern buildings,'' says
Alister, ''and because it is by-passed, the narrow streets are very
quiet, with only local traffic.''
The house had been converted from a lime barn and before that, a farm.
''The actual farm buildings are hundreds of years old and built on top
of Roman remains. To us it was primitive -- the lady owner had no
bathroom, only an outside toilet and outside shower of sorts, and she
had only lived in the space downstairs. Upstairs was the massive, old
vaulted barn where they once dried limes.
''We hired a notary -- in France it's quite common for a notary to act
for both the seller and buyer -- and eventually reached the final
stages, where all the lady's family had to be present to agree to the
sale and everything was officially signed over.''
Then came the task of renovating Chez Rae. Alister and an entourage of
willing helpers from Peebles removed walls and ripped up and replaced
floors.
''Some of the work was carried out by local tradesmen,'' says Alister.
''The rest we did ourselves or with the help of friends.''
Now it's finished, the Raes plan to treat it as their second home and
will start with their first proper family holiday there this summer,
with daughters Jessica, 8, and Sally, 5.
''The village has a butcher's, two bakers, a small supermarket, one
restaurant and two bars,'' says Elizabeth, ''and the villagers keep you
up-to-date with what's going on. Events are also advertised in the
butcher's window and the locals are very fond of impromptu open-air
dances during the summer.''
But no new labels are planned for the shelves of Villeneuve Wines in
Peebles.
''We do have one vine that has survived since 1949 outside the front
door,'' says Alister, ''and amazingly enough it produced over 40 buckets
of grapes last year. We just ate them.''

* IN Saint Symphorien-sur-Coise, some 10 miles outside Lyons in the
sunny south of France, Grange furniture has been designed and made
lovingly since 1905.
One of the more recent additions to its ranges has been the
Shaker-inspired kitchen furniture, in sycamore or maple wood, and
available in soft tones of grey, blue, green, red, antique cream with
saffron tops, and cherrywood colour finish.
So why have the very individual French gone for a look-alike instead
of an original design?
Alex Westwater of Sterling Furniture Group, the UK's biggest stockest
of Grange, says: ''Previously the bulk of Grange's furniture was all
cherrywood, so even if the design was different the colour tended to be
similar.
''I think they saw this as the chance for them to break out and do
something different, use half-a-dozen brighter colours, yet still have a
traditional touch.
''It's superb and it sells very well -- because it's a wee bit
different, it draws people to it. Luckily, none of the colours are too
strong, they're all quite subtle shades, so it doesn't look trashy.
''Two or three pieces in the range are multi-purpose. There's a chest
with six drawers and a cupboard below, which they call a semainier, it
could be used in a dining room, a bedroom even or a hall, so some pieces
are very flexible.''

Wendy Jack finds the French have lost none of their design flair
* THE morning after the night before . . . Bastille Day ended at
midnight, with explosions of fireworks and champagne.
The storming of the notorious Parisian fortress on July 14, 1789
marked the start of the French Revolution. But if the 5000-strong mob
which tried to free the prisoners were doomed to anticlimax, finding
only seven, no matter. The date went down in history as France's great
national holiday, and a day of huge patriotic favour. That's style for
you.
And style is what the French are exceedingly good at, as we all know.
Little by little, their home interior ideas are filtering into some of
our shops, to be used in British homes.
But what's the secret of French style, that certain chic?
Maryse Boxer is a French designer married to an American, and has
lived in London for nearly 15 years. Her rainboware ceramics and other
table designs are displayed in her shop within the Joseph Flagship in
Sloane Street, London, and at Linda Reid Plus in Glasgow. What does she
think is the secret of French flair?
''In France, I've always had a wonderful feel of things that are chic,
things not necessarily new. It's a way of knowing how to do very much
with very little. We French have flair,'' she concludes -- rightly, if
not modestly.
''It's a difficult art to learn for those not born with natural
flair,'' she continues. ''I try to give incentive, to tell people how.
The best way is to give them tools, basic things that they'll take to
make them creative. My ceramics are little modules that you can mix with
anything.
''If you have a dinner service of 50 pieces of something, you're stuck
with it. But my mix and match modules become something you can play
with, add to, so they give incentive to people. We in France have that
in our bones.''
Recently, she has designed pleated napkins which are being snapped up
at Joseph's (coming to Linda Reid Plus soon). She cites these as good
examples of stylish touches which lift a table from the mundane to the
special.
''It's so simple but so stylish, this is what I try to do in my
work,'' she explains. ''I try hard to tell people to take the time to
play, to experiment, you'll be rewarded and have more fun, your dreams
will bring you something.
''When you add a bow to your hair, or a scarf to an outfit, the way
you wear your bag or accessories, it makes all the difference. I try to
give people access to their own creativity.''
There again the stylish, effortless stamp she puts on her work is,
many would say, very French indeed.

* YOU want flair? A bit of Ooh La La? Ah, oui . . . but 'ow? Well, you
could start with imagination. Who for example, would have the audacity
to dress up a chair in tableclothes and napkin.
Precious few, but just look at the result -- not sheer cheek, but
sheer chic.
In Britain, alas, attempts to loosen up and be innovative too often
end up with a tacky-looking disaster. Do we try too hard, or not hard
enough?
The dressing-up treatment for this chair is simplistic in the extreme,
but highly imaginative -- and totally effective, true French-style
flair.
And study the shapes and colours of Maryse Boxer's ceramics. This
Parisian designer, domiciled in Britain, designs for an international
clientele, insisting that her work is not French in style but global.
Some would disagree with the latter viewpoint. These are ceramics with
a distinctive chic. There's a gentle beauty in their natural shapes of
leaves, petals, hearts; vibrancy in their colours . . . the epitome in
fact, of that elusive, inimitable French style, which we all long to
capture.
Tableclothes, napkin and ceramics, all from Linda Reid Plus, Giffnock,
Glasgow.

* THERE was a cheering atmosphere for traders at the Grosvenor
Antiques Fair which ran from June 14 to 24. Some very high prices were
paid for exhibits on the stands and this may mark an uplift in the
antiques business which has been in the doldrums for several years.
Oriental art did particularly well, and so did books and manuscripts.
A Book of Hours dating from around 1470 fetched #200,000, and The
History of Napoleon went for #50,000.
One unusual item bought by an American collector was a fluted blue and
white dish bearing the Meissen mark and the date of 1620 -- but all the
reference books give the date of the establishment of the Meissen
factory as 1710.
Is history about to be rewritten?

Liz Taylor visits the home of artist and writer John Ruskin and finds
herself beguiled by a man who lamented the human race's lack of
attention to the environment
WHEN John Ruskin heard that a railway had been built to connect
Matlock and Buxton, he summoned forth his not inconsiderable powers of
invective and announced: ''. . . And now every fool in Buxton can be at
Bakewell in half an hour, and every fool at Bakewell in Buxton.''
What would he say today if he were to return and find his home,
Brantwood, turned into a tourist resort with bus parties trundling into
its car-park and American visitors wandering through his rooms loudly
wondering who in tarnation John Ruskin was anyway? One lady seemed to
have confused him with John Peel -- the huntsman, not the disc jockey.
She was in the Lake District, after all.
The aesthetic John Ruskin who wrote learnedly on art, architecture,
and social questions is a character who does not seem to have a great
deal of relevance to modern times. He was archetypally a man of the
Victorian age though he did not, as his diatribe against the railways
showed, have a great deal of sympathy with its entrepreneurial,
profit-seeking spirit.
Although he proclaimed himself to be ''a true communist, redder than
red'', he was really nothing of the sort, and a case can be made against
him for advocating reactionary ideas and implanting artistic prejudices
that still haunt us. Yet, paradoxically, he was a man who took up
artistic crusades -- the Pre-Raphaelite Brethren, and the paintings of
Turner for example, when other critics damned them out of hand.
At the same time he adulated Venice and pushed the ideas of the Gothic
revival, laying the groundwork for preservation movements so, in a way,
he can be blamed for the ''heritage'' mania. Ruskin was an unlikely
architect of ''cultural tourism'' which attracts busloads of people to
his house today.
Until I went to Brantwood, John Ruskin was a character with whom I had
little sympathy. He seemed too privilegedly patronising, too personally
peculiar. Yet on a sunny day recently I found myself driving along
narrow hedge-lined lanes in search of his last home, Brantwood House,
overlooking Coniston Water, only three hours' drive from Glasgow.
When I got there, it and Ruskin completely beguiled me.
John Ruskin, a doted-on only child, was born in 1819 to a prosperous
wine-merchant father and a dominating mother who wanted her son to
become a bishop. She taught him his letters by readings from the Bible.
The boy was not only clever but also a talented artist.
He became a fine watercolour painter and also studied geology which
was the subject of his first published work at the age of 15. By the
time he was 24, he had started writing his five-volume study, Modern
Painters, which established him as a critic of formidable power. With
his parents he travelled extensively and was entranced by Venice which
provided the subject of another mammoth Ruskin undertaking, The Stones
of Venice, in which he described and illustrated the architectural
wonders of the city.
With the Ruskin family in Venice was his wife Effie Gray, a Scots
girl, whom he married in 1848. The first night of their honeymoon was
spent at Blair Atholl and it must have been a traumatic experience for
both of them, because in 1854 Effie was granted an annulment of the
marriage on the grounds of its non-consummation.
Fortunately for Effie, her husband's fascination with the painters of
the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood introduced her to the more worldly-wise
painter John Everett Millais, whom she married after the Ruskin marriage
was annulled.
Happily the couple had children and one of their sons was the model
for Millais's famous painting Bubbles, showing a curly-headed little boy
blowing soap bubbles. It was used by Pears Soap as an advertisement for
many years.
John Ruskin did not attempt matrimony again though he had several
romantic attachments, notably one to a young woman called Rose La
Touche, who died before he could get around to marrying her.
In the 1870s Ruskin took up social causes, establishing the Guild of
St George with which he intended to change the social fabric of Britain
-- everyone was to have enough books, clothes, jewels, and pictures to
look at. Labour was to be co-operative and there were to be no taxes.
Undeterred by his failure to carry out those aims, he adopted the
cause of conservation and became increasingly depressed by his vision of
the terrible consequences of man's lack of attention to his environment.
In that he was a century ahead of his time but few people paid any heed
to his warning.
He bought Brantwood in 1871, and by the 1880s had retired there,
living a semi-reclusive life under the care of his cousin Mrs Arthur
Severn and her family. He extended the house and also created a
wonderful garden which is now being restored to its Victorian character.
In the light, airy rooms of the house, family portraits hang on the
walls -- his father, mother, John himself, and several of Rose La
Touche. But none of Effie. Visitors can see the furniture that Ruskin
used, pictures that he painted as well as works by his Pre-Raphaelite
contemporaries, art treasures, coins, and pottery that he collected on
his travels.
Towards the end of his life Ruskin went mad and died at Brantwood in
1900, on the verge of the century which was to contain much of what he
had predicted with fear and apprehension.

Conrad Wilson savours a whiff of Middle Europe at a cafe with the
style of a pre-war station buffet
EDINBURGH was once a city of tea-rooms. Glasgow is conspicuously a
city of cafes. Central Station boasts an espresso bar, which is more
than can be said for Waverley. Even the Willow Tea Room, thanks to its
decor, looks more like a Viennese coffee house transported to
Sauchiehall Street than a place for dainty sips of Earl Grey.
But the most cafe-ish cafe of them all, the one any visitor with the
appropriate background would feel instantly at home in, is the Cafe
Gandolfi at 64 Albion Street. Though it serves only six sorts of coffee,
most of them variations on the espresso theme with decaffeinated
options, there is an unmistakable whiff of Middle Europe about it, which
familiarity does nothing to diminish. With its revolving door, its dark
jugendstil panels, its allusive photographs, its glimpses of stained
glass, it is the sort of place where Mr Norris might once have changed
trains.
It has, indeed, all the atmosphere of a pre-war station buffet, not
necessarily in Berlin, but quite possibly in Trieste, Budapest, Vienna,
Prague, or Warsaw. Yet to call it louche would be misleading. Nobody
could say the staff are sinister. The chunky brown hand-crafted wooden
chairs and tables may look like places of intrigue, but gossip and
eavesdropping are greater probabilities in this L-shaped room.
Recently I found myself sharing one of the larger tables,
unrecognised, with a fashionable counter-tenor and baroque conductor,
due to perform shortly afterwards (and I to review them) in the City
Hall round the corner. The cafe's closeness to Glasgow's quite European
old Gewandhaus -- a foolproof auditorium on rectangular Leipzig lines --
is another of its assets. You can eat there before or after a concert,
on any day of the week.
Habitues know the Gandolfi's robust menu inside out. The food -- spicy
Italian sausage with hot peperonata, Polish ham with pickled cabbage,
New York pastrami with Swiss cheese, roasted peppers Piemontese style,
gravadlax with dill and mustard dressing -- is what you would, or
should, expect. It is cosmopolitan and traditional, the product, it
seems, of several chefs and styles, all of them somehow cohering.
A couple of courses should be enough for all but gargantuan appetites.
The marinaded salmon is a generous portion, the spicy sausage is
filling, the mixed salad leaves (in an insufficient walnut vinaigrette)
include crunchy endive. Daily specials add variety. The touch is seldom
light, but lightness is not the aim. It wouldn't be the aim in Vienna or
Budapest either.
Edinburgh, for all its international aspirations, has nothing quite
like the Gandolfi. But it once had something Glasgow has never had: a
Japanese restaurant called Aye, which foundered because its delicacies
were deemed too dear (they weren't). Glasgow, in reply, now has its Yes,
which is no more Japanese than it is anything else, but which is wide
enough in scope and varied enough in pricing to make the affirmation
seem justified.
Situated in super-smart ground and basement premises at 22 West Nile
Street, Yes is the latest stop, or whistle-stop, in the talented and
peripatetic Ferrier Richardson's progress through the complexities of
Glasgow catering. Design, design, and design are clearly among its
motivations. The basement, of which you can catch a tantalising glimpse
from the street outside, is where the serious cooking and eating take
place, and I'll come round to it in a later article.
The ground-floor cafe-bar, in contrast, is an amplification of what
could be called the Princes Square approach to food and drink, and is
very Glasgow in a quite different way from the Gandolfi. Its
spaciousness, enhanced by a long bar counter and a wide sweep of tiled
floor, is a plus-point transformed into a minus by grating music and
wall panels disturbingly suggestive of Picasso's Guernica. As a result,
what could be an island of calm in the centre of Glasgow becomes just
another surge of restlessness.
What emerged from the kitchen one recent lunchtime proved equally
disconcerting. Though Richardson's penchant for juxtaposing east with
west could be discerned in a dish of oriental noodles with peppers,
prawns, and chicken, its effect was obscured by a lavish coating of soy
sauce. Overcooked goujons of haddock, undercooked potato skins, and a
mingling of overcooked and undercooked whitebait suggested that,
whatever things are like in the basement, Richardson's hand is urgently
needed upstairs.
* Cafe Gandolfi, 64 Albion Street, Glasgow (tel: 0141 552 6813).
Average cost of a two-course meal for two, with a glass of wine and
coffee, about #28.
* Yes, 22 West Nile Street, Glasgow (tel: 0141 221 8044). Average cost
of the same in the ground-floor cafe bar, about #22.

WRITTEN large in the records of beer brewing history is Bohemia and it
was here in the town of Plzen that in 1842 was produced the world's
first clear, golden lager-style beer. Although Plzen is the recognised
capital of brewing, Prague, the Czech republic's capital, also has a
similar tradition and boasts some excellent beers.
The brewery of Staropramen means old spring and it was founded in the
Smichov district of Prague in 1869 with its brewhouses built in a
traditional U-shape form around a cobbled courtyard. Modernisation is in
short supply but despite this the brewery works hard at being good at
its craft. Its elderly copper kettles go through an exhaustive system of
mashing in which parts of the wort are removed to be heated before
returning to the original vessel. It is perhaps this process that gives
the soft, sweet and malty character of Staropramen.
Fermentation takes place in open concrete vessels, tile-lined and each
with a capacity to hold 4000 gallons of beer. There are 150 of them and
when Bass took a 34% stake in the company in 1993 there was a move by
the Czech management to install stainless-steel vessels. Bass is not
without experience when it comes to change and it successfully persuaded
the Czechs not to go ahead on the basis that the beer's complexity would
probably be threatened.
Deep underneath the brewhouse in the vast chilled air of the lagering
(storage) cellars the beer rests on its side for 10 weeks until it
matures to a golden hue. A series of alleys and tunnels lead from cellar
to cellar, the cool air hanging in a dank nineteenth-century atmosphere.
The brewery's main product is a 10[DEG] (around 5% ABV) svetle or
light beer and it is this which has now become available at many
Scottish outlets, either in draught or bottle form. Ingredients used
include the Saaz hop variety, home-grown in Bohemia and much used by
brewers to give the Pilsner touch. Indeed, its quality was so recognised
that King Wenceslas forbade the export of its cuttings.
Many of Prague's bars are basic. Commonplace are cushionless upright
chairs around large robust wooden tables. But their size is their
potency and old men, dry, wrinkled and moustachioed, mix comfortably
with fresh upstarts in an air curdled with the reek of smoke.
Staropramen is the popular brand, but then it is the beer of Prague
and in city bars located some distance from famous squares it costs 25p
a [1/2]-litre or roughly #2 per gallon. But don't expect your landlord
to make a contract with you at this price; after all, the income of a
semi-skilled worker in the Czech Republic is around #1700 and his
favourite car, the Skoda, requires a year's income to buy.
In Prague Staropramen is available in the bottle, can, or keg but in
Peebles or Perth it can be had in the bottle from most supermarkets and
licensed grocers. Around the country several pubs have it on draught,
among whose number are: No 10 Tavern, Aberdeen; Esquire House,
Gillespies, Wharf, all Glasgow; Hunting Lodge, Kilmarnock; and the
Caprice, Ayr.

Lady Claire MacDonald has tried many ice-creams in the line of duty
but finds one of the simplest is a great family favourite and a
scrumptious ways of using up summer fruits
THIS is such a wide subject it could well run over several weeks, but
it won't! I shall endeavour to hold on for a while before I give free
rein to one of my favourite foods, which ice-cream is.
But it is important to consider ice-cream now, when soft summer fruits
are coming into their own and a glut of any of them can leave the
gardener/cook thinking desperately of ways to use them up and preserve
them. Make ice-cream.
I have a recipe which I make endlessly for our family use (I tend to
use slightly more complicated ice-cream-making procedures for our
guests) because it is quick and doesn't need beating when the ice-cream
is half frozen.
There are some utterly delicious ice-creams to be bought. Loving
ice-cream as I do, I find myself researching in depth, which is a
self-justifying way to say that I eat a lot of it. I find that what
appeals to Godfrey and me in bought ice-cream flavours doesn't appeal to
our children.
My favourite is Haagen Dasz Commotion, in which you find chips of dark
chocolate, chips of caramel, and toasted almonds in a coffee-flavoured
ice-cream.
I have re-created many of the combined tastes for our guests, using a
coffee ice-cream with chipped dark chocolate and a warm caramel sauce to
serve with it.
I could have made praline and combined the caramel and almonds, but I
preferred the caramel in an accompanying sauce. And this is what I like
when serving ice-cream, whether to our hotel guests or for us, to serve
an accompanying sauce. It dresses it up, it acts as a colour contrast,
and it is delicious, even if it is just a puree of the same fruit as the
ice-cream is made from, as in today's recipe.
Most fruits make exceptionally good ice-cream, and you can combine
summery flavours such as cooking gooseberries with heads of elderflowers
and lemon -- the resulting taste combination is really exquisite.
Strawberries, to my taste, need to be sharpened up with both orange and
lemon before being made into puree for ice-cream.
Blackcurrants are awfully good whizzed (then sieved to get rid of the
tiny woody seeds) with cinnamon before being folded into the ice-cream
mixture.
It can be very useful to have ice-cream and a puree for a sauce
frozen, to be used in an emergency -- and you can fast-thaw the sauce
either in a microwave or stand the container in a saucepan of very hot
water. But don't think that it will still be good in five or six months.
It won't hurt you, but it will have deteriorated in texture, so try to
use it within three months of making it.
Raspberry and lemon ice-cream
Serves 8-10
For the ice-cream:
[1/2] pint double cream, whipped but not too stiffly
4 eggs, yolks separated from the whites
4 oz sieved icing sugar
1 lb raspberries, simmered gently with the finely grated rind of 1
lemon and its juice.
For the sauce:
[1/2] lb raspberries
2 tblsps icing sugar -- or more, depending on your taste
COOL the raspberries then liquidise and sieve them. Whisk the whites
until stiff, then, still whisking, gradually add the sieved icing sugar
a spoonful at a time until the last spoonful -- don't add this.
Whisk until your meringue mixture is very stiff. With the same
unwashed whisk, whisk the yolks with the remaining spoonful of sugar,
until thick and pale. Fold the yolks into the whipped cream, then fold
the raspberry and lemon puree into the creamy mixture.
Lastly, with a large metal spoon, fold the meringue mixture through
the raspberry cream. Freeze immediately in a solid polythene container.
For the sauce, simply whiz the raspberries and icing sugar together.
Sieve this to get rid of the woody seeds. Serve spooned over the
ice-cream.
Take the ice-cream into room temperature for half an hour before
serving. Serving ice-cream is made easier if you have a jug of very hot
water to dip the serving spoon into between spoonfuls.

The rich characters and colourful narrative of talking books has
convinced Lesley Duncan that the best novels don't have to be seen to be
believed
INITIALLY I had reservations about audio books, at least as car
entertainment. The doubts dated back to one of my doomed efforts at
self-improvement. The soft female voice on the teach-yourself-Russian
tape could not compete with the roar of an aging Montego in the fast
lane of the M80.
Prejudice was softened by a double tape of Daphne Du Maurier's
masterpiece of ambiguity, My Cousin Rachel -- read by Mel Gibson with an
impeccable English accent (the paragon can act too!). Now, the latest
selection of audio tapes has quite won me over, on technical grounds
apart from their inherent interest. The human voice, clear and
characterful, rises above the worst rumble of the internal combustion
engine.
The motorised public are not, of course, the only clients for this
biggest growth area in book retailing. People in hospitals, people with
poor vision, gardeners, housewives, anyone with a busy pair of hands,
and a love of a good story can enjoy them.
Short stories have the great advantage of being usable unabridged. And
who could be more congenial company than Para Handy and crew? The wily
captain of The Vital Spark, the malcontent Macphail, Sunny Jim, and
Dougie are brought to idiosyncratic life by Robert Trotter in Para Handy
Stories (two volumes, four cassettes, Canongate Audio, #7.99 each). The
tales don't so much produce guffaws as a glow of amusement.
Take that of ''complete gentleman'' Hurricane Jack whose idea of
disposing of a family legacy is to traipse the country, pulling train
communication cords, summoning fire brigades, and generally getting
himself fined in as many ways as possible. Nothing sordid ever obtrudes,
needless to say, in these escapist escapades, though one may be a little
perturbed by Para Handy's summary treatment of the cockatoo which
interrupts his ballad-singing.
The bird goes overboard, irretrievably. However, humane values are
upheld as the crew reproach the captain till he sees himself as little
short of a murderer.
These cassettes are calculated to raise spirits (as The Vital Spark's
crew are themselves wont to do in the nearest hostelry).
Altogether darker-grained are the short stories of Lewis Grassic
Gibbon, four of which feature in Smeddum, Clay, Greenden, and Sim
(Canongate Audio, #7.99). Eileen McCallum reads them in authentic Mearns
style. The first two are the best. Clay charts the life of Rob Galt who
rents a farm and bends all his goodness and energies to conquering its
sour acres. His relationship with his wife and clever daughter are
sacrificed to this elemental contest of man and land. The futility of
his life is redeemed, in a sense, by his daughter's ability to forgive
him. A haunting piece of writing.
Almost skittish by comparison is Smeddum in which Meg Menzies -- a big
woman with a weasel-like mate -- bosses her unpromising progeny into
marriage. All, that is, except the wayward Kathleen, who escapes
maternal strictures by having, yes, smeddum to deal with her own sex
life.
The north-east is the setting for Nigel Tranter's historical novel,
The Queen's Grace, abridged and read on two tapes by Andrew Dallmeyer
(Novel Sound, #7.99). The hero is young Patrick Gordon of Clan Gordon,
who has to act as intermediary between his uppity clan chief Huntly and
the teenaged Mary Stuart, a pawn in the hands of her half-brother Lord
James.
How authentic the historical detail is one can only guess. Mr
Tranter's style veers between the antique and the cosily modern. For all
that, it's a gripping tale. The Scottish landscapes of the time are
sensitively evoked and the heroine Mary Mackintosh is spirited enough to
confound Mary Stuart's greeting of ''ma pauvre cherie.'' There is a
beheading at the end -- too graphically described for comfort.
The best treat of all is England, Their England, a two-volume version
of A G Macdonell's affectionate tribute to the South Britons and their
inscrutable ways. The Scottish outsider Donald Cameron -- a survivor of
Passchendaele and farming in Aberdeenshire -- is the ingenuous observer
of various aspects of 1920s England, from golfing to fox-hunting,
country-weekending to cricketing. The cricket match is rightly regarded
as a classic, as a cast of city and rural eccentrics bat and bowl their
way through a drowsy afternoon in the achingly lovely English
countryside.
There is a take-off of a pretentious German play, set in a Silesian
salt mine and mostly performed in pitch darkness, and a cynical look at
the League of Nations, with Foreign Office persons spouting familiar
verbiage. The fun gets very close to the bone when the question of
Yugoslavia and human-rights abuses is raised.
Macdonell's sunniness surmounts the implicit savagery of much of his
observation. Dramatised incidents -- with Sam Graham as Donald and a
supporting cast specialising in blustering blimps -- add to Leslie
Phillips's urbane narrative. Highly recommended (Bespoke Audio, #7.99).
For thoughtful listening -- perhaps at bedtime -- a sombre note is
sounded (with the help of bagpipes) in Scots at War, 39-45 (produced by
the Rev. William Marsh, #4.99). The poems, all but one written at the
time by factory worker Jackie MacDonald, have a power and resonance
beyond their sometimes gauche rhymes. The one about the D-Day landings
ends: ''We little knew what they would pay/In blood, to death, for
victory.'' The tape's proceeds go to the Earl Haig Fund.

Actor Russell Hunter tells ANN DONALD what he is reading before
catching forty winks at night.
I'M re-reading the six volumes of Konstantin Paustovsky's
autobiography called simply A Story of A Life. He was born in Georgia,
Russia, in 1893 and died in 1968. He was a man with a great drive for
words having been encouraged as a child to read all the great Russian
poets.
The first volume is called Childhood and Schooldays and starts just
before the turn of the century, and gives an amazing insight into what
rural life must have been like in pre-revolutionary Russia.
I first heard about the book when it was mentioned by one Marlene
Dietrich on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, when she said it was the one
book that she could re-read forever. I must have read it about eight
times now and it comes fresh off the page every time.
There is another author I always re-read called Ryszard Kapuscinski
who is a well-known Polish newspaperman who wrote the book Imperium. In
Imperium he spent about three years galloping all over the former Soviet
Union interviewing peasants, workers, the unemployed and beggars. The
book gives terrifying details of a corrupt Russia.
I do enjoy a lot of non-fiction but Una (McLean) is reading a novel
that I've just finished, called Perfume by Patrick Suskind. I think that
this book changed my physical being because I began to smell things that
I'd never smelt in my life before. I'd like to be able to read at least
50 good books every year. If I could read at least two good books every
week I'd be a much happier person.

GEOFF Billington kept Britain's flag flying in the absence of the star
home names as he ended Ireland's run of victories at Hickstead's Royal
International Horse Show yesterday.
The 40-year-old Cheshire rider, a strong contender for a European
championship place in September, won the West Sands Holidays
International Stakes with Mancuso, winning a six-horse jump-off.
With Britain's top trio of John and Michael Whitaker and Nick Skelton
away in Luxembourg, Billington is one of the leading home challengers at
this show.
He has already put himself into European reckoning with recent sound
Nations Cup team efforts with his other top horse, It's Otto.
He is quietly hopeful for toay's King George V Gold Cup on It's Otto.
The opposition will be toughened up today when Michael Whitaker flies
in from Luxembourg bidding for a second successive win on Midnight
Madness and a fifth victory overall. Results:
West Sands Holidays Speed Challenge: 1, Diamond Heather (S Breen,
Ireland) 61.65sec; 2, Everest Vantage (G Luckett, GB) 61.68; 3,
Impressionist (W Funnell, GB) 63.19.
International Stakes: 1, Mancuso (G Billington, GB) clear, 42.96sec;
2, Hello Oscar (G Glazzard, GB) 46.26; 3, Benjumin II (W Clarke, GB) 4
faults, 46.10.

IF the travails of Seve Ballesteros have been dominating the
conversations in the tents, even, I am told, between races in the
betting shop next to the Guinness bar, another man who has been fighting
to make his way out of the wilderness, Sandy Lyle, may be close to
achieving his goal.
The amiable Lyle, who won the Open Championship in 1985 and the US
Masters in 1988, has not won anything since the Volvo Masters in 1992,
but the breakthrough may be sooner than many of his despairing fans
imagine.
In fact, the man himself is convinced he will emerge a better player
than in his big years. He has certainly shown some glimpses of the old
champ this week at Carnoustie, where he completed his third round with a
72 for an aggregate of par 216.
He is probably too far behind to have a chance of winning -- ''If I
been two or three under it would have been a different ball game'' --
but his game is improving at such a rate that he might well make up a
good deal of the ground in his final fling this afternoon.
Lyle's confidence is clearly returning. His demeanour has changed from
the man of a couple of years ago, when he seemed almost resigned to
playing on the fringe of the big-time for the rest of his career.
Now there are genuinely positive vibes coming from the man who now
lives in West Lynton with his wife Jolande and children Stuart (12),
James (9) and Alexandra (2).
''My ball-striking is good,'' he said, ''and I am playing shots that I
could not have done two years ago, maybe even four months ago. The No.1
iron I hit today at the sixteenth, for example, was not in my repertoire
before.''
Lyle ought to have had a better score, having started with a birdie 3
and strung together 16 successive pars before suffering his only bogey
of the day, a 6 at the last. Still, if he was unlucky to go in the water
with a his tee-shot at the final hole, a No.3-iron shot he hit 220
yards, he was also more than a touch lucky at the opening hole.
He hooked his drive and was convinced he would be playing out of a
gorse bush before the ball hit a spectator and bounced back into play.
From there he chipped on and holed the putt for a 3.
At least he had the courtesy to thank the man who, albeit
inadvertently, diverted his wayward ball into the right spot.
Otherwise, his was a solid, uneventful round, but Lyle is looking
forward to the Open at St Andrews next week. Can he win? ''It depends on
the conditions. If it is windy it would give me a reasonable chance. I
enjoy the course.''
Lyle believes he is competing well again. ''My caddie thinks I need to
hit another 6000 balls before I am back. I reckon I will be a better
player than in my best days.''
One Scot who has yet to see his best days, and they could be very
good, indeed, is Andrew Coltart. Of the first 15 two-balls out in the
rain and gloom, he was the only one player with the magical red figure,
signifying below par, attached to his aggregate score.
The man from Thornhill put together a very sound 69, thanks to a
marvellous return half which he covered in 32. Considering that he had
looked to be wavering on the brink of dismissal as he headed towards the
last hole on the previous day, it was a display of gratitude as well as
aggression.
Coltart, like so many players at this level, put it all down to
putting. His 72 the previous day, even his 74 on the opening round, were
just as efficient in many ways, but the last bit, the point of the whole
business, was less effective.
He admits the difference between holing the putts and not holing them
is marginal. ''I went to see my coach and I felt happier with the way I
am swinging. The putting is down to a feeling you get. Suddenly, when
you stand over a putt, you think: that feels like it, and you stick with
that for a while and see how long that lasts.
''All I am doing is trying to keep making the cuts and looking forward
to tomorrow.''
It sounds like the philosophy of a young man goiong places.

BOWLS
TORRENTIAL rain dogged yesterday's opening day of the #12,000 Woolwich
Scottish Masters at Aberdeen's Westburn Park, but Commonwealth champion
Richard Corsie, national champion Colin Peacock, and former winners
Graham Robertson and Willie Wood survived to leave the Scottish
challenge in today's quarter-finals.
Wood, the winner back in 1990, produced the most impressive display
and is the only quarter-finalist to have won through with an unbeaten
record.
The 57-year-old Gifford man reeled off straight set wins over Scottish
junior champion Robert Paterson, 7-4, 7-5, Ireland's Noel Graham 7-4,
7-2, and former world indoor champion John Price 7-2, 7-4 to set up an
all-tartan quarter final clash with another former winner, Robertson.
Robertson launched his campaign with a 7-5, 7-6 win over defending
champion Andy Thomson, but then lost 5-7, 3-7 to Scottish champion Colin
Peacock from Marchmount.
However, he got back on the winning way with a 7-4, 7-4 win over local
internationalist Kevin Pirie and that put him and Peacock through to the
last eight while Thomson bowed out.
The world indoor champion followed up his defeat from Robertson by
going down 7-2, 7-1 to Pirie. And even a face-saving 7-5, 5-7, 7-6
victory over Peacock was too late to save his title.
Corsie, who lost out to Thomson in last year's final, opened with a
7-6, 7-3 win over international colleague Angus Blair before beating
local qualifier Mark Thurston 5-7, 7-5, 7-5.
Corsie, however, had to survive a scare before clinching his
quarter-final place. A 7-3, 7-5 defeat from Jersey's David Le Marquand
opened the door for Thurston, but the Turriff man lost 7-4, 7-2 to Angus
Blair to leave Corsie in second place in his section behind Le Marquand.
World outdoor champion Tony Allcock hit back after dropping his
opening match to set up a quarter-final clash with Corsie.
Allcock lost in three sets to Stephen Rees but recovered to beat
Ireland's Jeremy Henry and Alex Marshall to move through to his clash
with Corsie. Peacock takes on former world indoor champion John Price in
his quarter-final, Robertson and Wood meet in an all-tartan clash and
Rees faces Le Marquand. The semi-finals and finals will fought out
tomorrow.

TENNIS
WIMBLEDON hero Greg Rusedski continued the love affair with his new
British fans by leading his adopted country to a 2-0 first day Davis Cup
lead against Monaco yesterday.
The 21-year-old Canadian import, making his debut for the British
team, then revealed the ambition he believes is within the scope of
British tennis talent, saying: ''We can be back among the best in the
world in three years.''
Rusedski wiped out Christophe Boggetti in straight sets on
Eastbourne's lush Devonshire Park lawns and, after Oxford's Tim Henman,
20, produced a similar demolition of Sebastien Graeff, Britain were
heading for their first whitewash cup win in 10 years -- and first of
any kind since 1991.
There seemed a distinct danger of everyone becoming carried away as
this match against the no-hopers from the tiny principality is merely to
decide who goes down to the pits of Europe-Africa Zone division three
next year.
The best Britain and their new captain David Lloyd can hope for is a
convincing success to maintain their status for another year in division
two.
To fulfil Rusedski's bold prophecy, they must -- assuming Mark Petchey
and Neil Broad ensure victory in the doubles today -- win eight more
matches, at least half on hard-court or clay surfaces.
But Lloyd said: ''We've got Greg now and I sense a new spirit in the
team. All four players are pulling together in a real team effort which
is what Davis Cup is all about and there's no reason why we cannot go
from strength to strength.''
Rusedski pointed the way for Britain with a 98-minute 6-2, 6-2, 7-6
win containing 20 aces against Boggetti, while Henman ripped through
Monaco's top player, 18-year-old Graeff, 6-0, 6-3, 6-2.
* Andrew Foster continued his resurgence by reaching the semi-finals
of the Mercury Communications Challenge in Bristol yesterday.
Foster beat Dutch qualifier Dennis van Scheppingen 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 in a
tense quarter-final played in difficult gusty conditions.
Top seed Jeremy Bates was 3-0 up in the first set against Italian
Massimo Calvelli when heavy rain brought play to a halt. The rain then
relented to allow Bates to take his first set lead to 5-2, but then
started again, forcing action to be curtailed for the day.

EUROPEAN WOMEN
SCOTLAND gave another outstanding display in the heat in Milan
yesterday to sweep into the semi-finals of the European Women's Team
Golf Championship -- an event, amazingly, they have never won.
There was no doubting their superiority yesterday as they put Sweden
to the sword by 5-2 and they will today hope to do the same to Denmark
in their semi-final clash.
In the other match, defending champions England come up against top
qualifiers Spain, who had a struggle to overcome a battling Welsh
outfit.
Scotland have two linchpins in the Curtis Cup pair of Janice Moodie
and Mhairi McKay, and while they would be only too pleased for the rest
of the side to take much of the credit, there is no question that they
are a great inspiration and the key players in the success story.
Yesterday they proved invaluable once again -- they played together in
the foursomes and won their match and then each got points in the
afternoon singles, Moodie at the top of the order and McKay at the
bottom of the list.
Moodie, the 22-year-old studying at San Jose University in the US, was
in fine form, being two under par in seeing off the challenge of Mia
Lojdahl by 3 and 1, and McKay, twice a British Girls' Champion, now at
Stanford University, gained the biggest victory of the day, 6 and 5
against Maria Hjorth.
It was level-pegging after the foursomes, but in the singles Scotland
quickly assumed control and were always well and truly in the driving
seat, winning the top three matches and McKay's as well. Quarter-final
results:
Scotland 5, Sweden 2. Foursomes: J Moodie and M McKay beat M Lojdahl
and S Eklund, 2 and 1; A Rose and L Nicholson lost to S Eriksson and M
Hjorth, 3 and 2.
Singles: Moodie beat Lojdahl, 3 and 1; Rose beat A Berg, 1 hole;
Nicholson beat H Ohlsson, 4 and 3; S McMaster lost to Eriksson, 4 and 3;
McKay beat Hjorth, 6 and 5.
Other matches: Denmark 5[1/2], Italy 1[1/2]; England 4[1/2], France
2[1/2]; Spain 4, Wales 3.

BOXING
PETER McNeeley, who faces the daunting task of opposing Mike Tyson in
the former world heavyweight champion's comeback fight, completed an
unscheduled outdoor sparring session and declared: ''I'm in the best
shape of my life.''
A fire at McNeeley's Louisiana training camp forced him into the front
yard of local fight manager Beau Williford's gym, which was damaged in
the blaze.
And as the Boston boxer completed a week of conditioning in the
sweltering town of Lafayette, he announced himself ready to take on
Tyson on August 19 in what will be a #500,000 pay-day for the underdog.
''This trip has pushed me to another level. I'm in tremendous
condition now,'' said McNeeley, who has vowed to drop Tyson in three
rounds in the Las Vegas contest.
McNeeley will return to Lafayette on July 31 for a boxing exhibition
to benefit the Special Olympics before turning his attention to Tyson
and their date at the MGM Grand.
Tyson has not fought in more than four years, having been released in
March after three years in an Indiana prison on a rape conviction.

Book review from Native Stranger
by Alastair Scott
Little, Brown, #16.99
Almost a decade ago I wrote in The Herald: ''How gratifying it is to
welcome a young Scotsman as a major new travel writer,'' when reviewing
Scott Free by Alastair Scott. My opinion has been confirmed by the wide
readership Scott has built up through a series of travel books,
including a trek across Alaska with a pack of dogs.
His latest, Native Stranger: A Journey in Familiar and Foreign
Scotland, is his best yet. It seems that Scott decided to write a book
about Scotland while travelling in Karelia because he knew more about
some of the world's remoter spots than he did about his homeland. Native
Stranger is thus a learning process for the author as well as for his
readers.
Many travel writers insist on the comfort of top hotels and first
class travel when writing books; Scott journeyed round Scotland by
bicycle, and only abandoned his tent when the weather turned dire. Most
of the pieces in his book are short and succinct.
He starts off in Arthur Caldbeck's shop in Shetland, symbolic of our
country itself, cluttered, but with much useful stock. Scott combines a
fine sense of humour with descriptive aptness. Arthur's face ''had
oxidised to a crusty frown as a result of . . . years of exposure to
tourists' facile remarks about weather, beauty and loneliness.'' This is
the all too often the face that confronts tourists to Scotland.
Scott travelled in the Northern Isles, seeing the prosperity that
North Sea oil has brought. Shetland Isles Council has #300 million in
its Trust Fund, and #7 million is added annually from revenues levied at
Sullom Voe.
Poll Tax was charged at a flat rate of #1. But oil looked like doing
lasting damage to the ecology of Shetland when the Braer broke its back
on rocks.
Scott went to see for himself. ''The Braer disaster proved much less
dire than had been feared . . . The oil was a light crude, and the storm
which drove the ship ashore raged for a further five days and proved the
most effective dispersant. Rain gradually washed the slime from the
fields. Contaminated birds counted remarkably few.''
One important theme in Scott's absorbing travelogue by pedal power is
the role of the incomer in remote communities. On Vaila Island,
Shetland, Scott visited Dorotta, aged 32, an art dealer in London with a
thick, Polish accent, who bought Vaila Hall with her partner for a
quarter of a million pounds, with much more to be spent on restoring it.
''It's so ugly, so romantic . . . we just love it,'' Dorotta told Scott,
whose wicked ear for dialogue brings out the naivety and pretensions in
such people, to the reader's delight.
Contrast this with Scott's visit (with Maxwell MacLeod) to Mrs
Cameron-Head of Inverailort Castle, Inverness-shire. ''We drove a long
way in silence, each lost in his own thoughts. Suddenly Max said: 'I'd
better warn you. When we get there, don't inhale too deeply.' 'What do
you mean?' 'Cats' piss.'
Forget the rutted driveway, the buckets catching the leaks. Mrs C-H
had allowed the local post office to set up in the castle. Scott was
told that when a tenant's washing machine was broken, Mrs C-H was likely
to turn up on the doorstep with a replacement. ''That's what this
run-down castle is all about -- given her money away,'' MacLeod informed
Scott.
They dined with Mrs C-H, but she was only the ghost of her ebullient
self. Ten days later she died, and Scott's reminiscences are a moving
obituary to a rare type of laird. This book is as much about people as
places. Scott concludes: ''On deeper reflection, my initial
disappointment at not finding a greater display of national awareness
across the country gave way to a growing sense of reassurance, for the
preservation of our smallest differences, I realised, could only add to
the enduring distinction of the whole, of being a Scot. Scottish
consciousness is safest with local roots.''

BORDERLINERS
Peter Hoeg
Harvill, #14.99
ONLY a dogged core of Peter Hoeg's Miss Smilla fans will arrive at the
closing pages of his follow-up novel frozen to the chair. The justly
acclaimed Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow was, all else besides, a
fast-moving thriller. In this one it's the all else we're dealing with
-- that is to say Hoeg's preoccupation with detail, the sense of danger
emanating from what should be the source of security and, raised against
it, a cold, obsessive moral outrage. Borderliners is an intense, inward
book that hardly shifts out of the head of its teenage protagonist. When
it finally explodes into action the longueurs are justified: until then,
they're long.
The setting is an experimental school in Copenhagen. The narrator --
named Peter -- is in that state of heightened awareness that sustains
political dissenters under totalitarian regimes, where to read correctly
the minds of those in power is the key to survival. Why is he here? He
is an orphan with behavioural difficulties from a children's home. The
school has no buzz, no sense of communality -- fraternising is noted and
discouraged -- and the rules are enforced not by violence but by
menacing pauses and by the ringing of bells.
The study of time preoccupies Peter who is trying to piece together
the masterplan he senses, and the flaws in its practice. Occasionally
Headmaster Biehl strikes a pupil. Once. Unexpectedly. On the head. This
is the caring Baltic Bacon Kingdom, not Dotheboys Hall.
Of the many remarkable things Hoeg has achieved in Smilla, and to a
lesser extent here, none is more remarkable than his creative use of
Denmark. In Smilla it was its unfamiliarity as a literary landscape that
captivated, the exoticism of its Arctic possessions, its academic
faculties for research into ice and snow. In Borderliners he merely
plays upon an idea of Denmark as a rational place, a little cool, a
little earnest, with a name for enlightened social planning.
Katerina, an older girl, is also trying to crack the system. She and
Peter are joined in their silent intentional anarchy by the younger,
fragile, emotionally damaged August who is put into Peter's care. When a
crisis is finally engineered it brings the realisation for Peter and
Katerina that, with August, they are three, not two. They cannot leave
him. It is as if he was their child. The intensity of feeling for
another, more helpless, is what releases their humanity and, ultimately,
makes them more vulnerable.
In Borderliners the sanctity and fragility of childhood is the
message, complete and absolute. Ian McEwen crossed this same ground with
The Child In Time, and though that was a better story this is a more
vivid and committed treatment.
The experiment. It is, after all, an innovative, coolly documented
exercise in bringing up every type of child under one system. Personal
glory is the prize. The educational theorist as Dr Frankenstein.
We must assume now that childhood is a key subject for Peter Hoeg. The
fictional Peter winds up getting himself adopted by a couple named Hoeg
-- another tantalising jigsaw piece for fans already transfixed by the
''fencer, dancer, actor, sailor'' of his dust-jacket profile and the
spiky blonde author picture in the Cossack shirt, here blown up
back-cover size, looking like a rather confrontational Royal Danish
Ballet principal, only slightly ruffled from the rigours of performance.

THE OXFORD BOOK OF LETTERS
Frank Kermode and Anita Kermode, editors
Oxford University Press, #20
Dear epistle
OR CAN I call you letter? I'm sorry to hear that you are unwell, and
you ought to be dead by now. They say that about all the best literary
forms, yet look at how the novel keeps staggering from one reading of
the last rites to the next, so you mustn't let them get you down. Is
there anything I can do, apart from keeping you going a little longer
with this feeble correspondence?
That's the trouble. Nobody knows how to write decent letters any more,
and I'm no exception. Yet we love to receive them. I always open the
handwritten mail first. Anything without a proper licked-on stamp I
leave for at least a few days. Inland Revenue, gas bills, overdraft
limit reminders, and parking fines I hide in plastic bags and only
investigate when my cheques start bouncing or warrants get whapped into
my hand at the front door. It's not exactly Cicero, is it? It's not even
Adrian Mole.
I suppose the invention of the telegraph was the first writing on the
wall for you, or should that be writing on the wire? They've certainly
all got wired into you since: the telephone, the fax, and now E-mail.
They have all made communication promiscuous compared to the special
privacy that you have always offered.
Just think of all the junk you have been relieved from carrying, all
the boring tittle-tattle, ramblings, perfunctory business, courtesy
calls, and pure nonsense that you are no longer expected to burden. You
ought to be healthier than ever before.
Look at it this way. There were five good reasons why people have
always written letters: business, friendship, malice, penury and sex.
You have more or less gotten rid of the responsibility for the first.
The begging letter has gone for ever, because if anyone can wait long
enough for a reply their need can't be that acute, and they will be
ignored. Most people work out their anger or spite down the phone, and
the rest write to the newspapers, which is okay by us. That leaves you
the best. Letters from pals and love letters. What a nice job you have
these days.
Professor Kermode and his wife Anita ought to have put together a
valediction rather than a collection, if all the rumours about you are
true. Even if they end pessimistically by making Philip Larkin's
deathbed dictated letter to Kingsley Amis the 328th and final inclusion
in their Oxford book of letters, and they mutter gloomily about the
demise of the ''good fountain pen'', there is another vigour
demonstrated in their pages to see you safely into the next century.
Can you beat this, from Katherine Mansfield to the woman having an
affair with her husband, John Middleton Murry? ''Dear Princess Bibesco,
I am afraid you must stop writing these little love letters to my
husband while he and I live together. It is one of the things which is
not done in our world. You are very young. Won't you ask your husband to
explain to you the impossibility of the situation. Please do not make me
have to write to you again. I do not like scolding people, and I simply
hate having to teach them manners. Yours Sincerely, Katherine
Mansfield.''
Or Groucho Marx to Jack and Harry Warner, when their lawyers
threatened over the ''stealing'' from the title Casablanca for the later
film, A Night In Casablanca. ''Dear Warner Brothers, I had no idea that
the city of Casablanca belonged exclusively to Warner Brothers . . .
What about 'Warner Brothers'? Professionally, we were brothers long
before you were. We were touring the sticks as The Marx Brothers when
Vitaphone was still a gleam in the inventor's eye, and even before us
there had been other brothers -- the Smith Brothers; the Brothers
Karamzov; Dan Brothers, an outfielder with Detroit, and Brothers, Can
You Spare A Dime?''
The Kermodes are otherwise over-literary in their taste, and you too
may well disagree that writers always wrote the best letters. With the
exception of Shaw and Wilde, they put their better efforts into their
day job. So when you get someone like Mr A T Harris of New Jersey
writing to the superintendent of the Atlantic City Railroad a century
ago, it comes as a bit of a relief. ''Dear Sir, On the 15th yore trane
that was going to Atlanta ran over mi bull at 30 mile post he was in my
pastur You orter see him Yore ruddy trane too a peece of hyde outer his
belly between his nable and his porker and took his bag most off and he
lost his seeds I don't believe he is going to be any more use as a
bull.''
Scholars will recognise in this style the future James Joyce. He
appears in the Kermodes' collection, doing what those of us who care
about you, may be advised to emulate. He wrote to himself. ''Dear Mister
Germ's Choice, In gutter dispear I am taking my pen toilet you know . .
. .'' And he signed it Vladimir Dixon.
I hope this book revives your spirits as it did mine. I am writing to
let you know that it is nowhere near time for you to give up the ghost.
It was you who carried most of the Bible and started the English novel,
with Richardson's Pamela. Where would Robert Burns have been without
you, and the epistolary form? The Penny Post brought you to your heyday,
and it was you who did more than anybody else to promote mass literacy.
We still long to hear from you. Don't give up on us now.
Yours Ever,
John Linklater

AAA CHAMPIONSHIPS:
LINFORD Christie makes what he insists will be his farewell AAA
Championship appearance in Birmingham today, pursuing a record eighth
100 metres title, then he will hurry away to run for money in Italy,
rather than go out with a flourish by racing the 200m tomorrow.
Christie, whose seven victories equals the tally achieved by McDonald
Bailey, has won the short sprint for the past four years, and even the
presence of a substantial Australian squad, en route to the World
championships in Sweden next month, is unlikely to prevent him from
penning another statistic before slipping into his too-fiercely
proclaimed retirement.
Indeed, the principal threat to the Olympic and world champion may
come from his friend and business partner, Colin Jackson.
Good enough to have won the European indoor 60m sprint title last year
in Christie's absence, Jackson has forsaken the hurdles to make a rare
outdoor 100m appearance in which his personal target will be his own
Welsh record of 10.29sec.
Christie's presence in the 200m would have coaxed an extra burst of
adrenalin from Scottish No.1 Doug Walker, who needs a time of 20.80 to
confirm his place in the World Student Games team.
Injuries are unavoidable, but add the non-appearance of grand slam
hurdles champion Sally Gunnell, reigning and former European 400m
champions Du'aine Ladejo and Roger Black, world No.1 triple jumper Jon
Edwards, former world javelin record holder Steve Backley, and
Commonwealth triple jump record holder Ashia Hansen, and one can
appreciate why contracts between the sport and its star performers
should now be mandatory.
The presence of Yvonne Murray (1500m)and Mel Neef (400m) will be more
than welcome.
Ayr Seaforth's Brian Whittle finished third in these championships
last year and is still ranked fourth fastest in Europe for the season,
yet could not secure an individual place in the UK team.
Whittle believes he had a shoddy deal, and I agree with him.
''The only way to make sure is to win and be chosen automatically,''
he said.
But following injury, Whittle comes into this meeting with more than
20 Britons having run faster than him.
For him and Tom McKean, this is more than make or break for the season
-- failure to gain a UK team place could bring the decision to retire.
* SCOTLAND'S likely thin world championships representation took a
blow yesterday when Karen Macleod was forced to withdraw from the
marathon for which she had been pre-selected.
Doctors cannot identify why her left foot goes dead after as little as
one hour's running.
''I have been advised to defer a marathon until the problem is
alleviated,'' said Macleod, who finished fourth in the Commonwealth
Games.

BUSCH CLSSIC
FORMER winner Jim Gallagher recovered from an early bogey to vault
into the lead yesterday after his second round at the Anheuser-Busch
Classic in Williamsburg, Virginia.
Gallagher, the 1993 champion, recorded five birdies and an eagle for a
six-under-par 65 on a steamy morning at the Kingsmill course. He posted
an eight-under-par 134 halfway total and, with half the field back in
the clubhouse, led by one stroke from fellow Americans Blaine
McCallister (67) and Jim Carter (69).
Gallagher won the St Jude Classic in Memphis two weeks ago, his second
victory on the American Tour this year, but missed the cut at last
week's Western Open in Chicago.
Next week he will play at St Andrews for the first time. He has played
the past four Opens, and last year made the cut for the first time,
finishing equal forty-seventh at Turnberry.
''My brother's played at St Andrews and the only thing he's told me is

FR Leavis: A Life In Criticism. Allen Lane The Penguin Press, #25
(pp476).
READING English in Scotland in the 1960s I learned about Leavis from
the stiff upper lips of English students. Leavis was adored as the man
who sorted out various literary issues in Scrutiny, an old magazine
(1932-53) still running in the minds of young students impressed by the
biting comments of the great culture vulture.
Leavis was the fiercest critic of his time (1895-1978). He insisted on
high moral values in literature, denounced cultural charlatans, deplored
the cheap thrills of a society driven by commerce, championed modernist
writers he considered serious, savaged modish writers he considered
superficial. He was nothing if not opinionated. The Sitwells, he said,
belonged to ''the history of publicity rather than poetry''. D H
Lawrence, he said, was ''the great genius of our time''.
The point of his criticism was provocation and his opinions were
always open to question. In New Bearings in English Poetry (1932) he
said Ronald Bottrall would be recognised as the great post-modernist
poet, but I spent one summer in Spain with Bottrall who was clearly
distressed by his position as a forgotten poet. In The Great Tradition
(1948) Leavis recognised Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and
Joseph Conrad as the chosen few -- ''the great English novelists'' --
and foolishly denounced Joyce's Ulysses as ''a dead end'' when, in fact,
that fiction pointed the way forward for such outstanding writers as
Samuel Beckett and Anthony Burgess.
He was enthusiastically elitist. In New Bearings in English Poetry he
wrote: ''The potentialities of human experience in any age are realised
only by a tiny minority . . .'' The tiny minority -- the chosen few --
of Leavis's time included Leavis himself, his wife Queenie (who took a
highly critical look at popular culture in Fiction and the Reading
Public, 1932) and fellow elitists like T S Eliot. Leavis thought only
the minority mattered.
He first spoke up eloquently for this far-from-silent minority in Mass
Civilization and Minority Culture (1930), a pamphlet published by Gordon
Fraser's aptly named Minority Press. The minority preserved traditional
values: ''Upon them depend the implicit standards that order the finer
living of an age, the sense that this is worth more than that, this
rather than that is the direction in which to go, that the centre is
here rather than there.'' Born and bred in Cambridge -- where he buried
himself in work as a college lecturer and luminary before he was laid to
rest at Cambridge crematorium -- Leavis had the highest brow in the
cultural business (as this book's cover-portrait by Peter Greenham
proves).
Under the influence of I A Richards he developed into a combative
critic, so much so that he eventually turned critical on Richards and
his allegedly simplistic interpretation of poetry.
Leavis's most famous critical fight was with C P Snow who, in The Two
Cultures and the Scientific Revolution (1959), exposed the ignorance of
literary folk unaware of the insights of science. Leavis replied in his
Richmond Lecture of 1962: ''Snow is, in fact, portentously ignorant.''
Since Snow was both scientist and novelist, Leavis's attack was
ludicrous and showed the limitations of his approach to literature. For
Leavis, literature was an exlusive private property he wanted to protect
from conspicuously public figures like Snow.
As Ian MacKillop's biography makes clear, Leavis was a spiteful man.
He called David Holbrook, a student of his and a considerable critic,
''a well known indefatigable publicist on the themes of pornography''. A
hurt Hulbrook complained to Leavis about the ''wicked'' insult and
Leavis wrote back to say: ''now you come out with your 'wicked', it's
the time to let you have it.'' This exchange took place in 1977, a year
before Leavis died. He had been letting others have it all his life.
Like Holbrook, MacKillop was taught by Leavis. He has written this
book from a desire to demonstrate that a great critic can contribute as
much to culture as any (well, almost any) artist.
Here is a typical piece of Leavisite prose, from The Great Tradition:
''I have said nothing about Wuthering Heights because that astonishing
work seems to me a kind of sport. [Bronte] broke completely, and in the
most challenging way, both with the Scott tradition . . . and with the
tradition coming down from the eighteenth century that demanded a
plane-mirror reflection of the surface of ''real'' life. Out of her a
minor tradition comes, to which belongs, most notably, The House With
The Green Shutters.''
Every assertion in that passage is eccentric. Bronte renewed the
tradition to which she belonged. Nobody in the eighteenth century
''demanded'' a reflection of reality (think of Sterne). The House With
The Green Shutters is no product of a minor tradition but a masterpiece
drawing on the major achievements of classical tragedy. No matter.
Leavis wanted to stimulate debate and always did.
The Leavisite legacy is the kind of self-consciously clever and
quarrelsome criticism you find in so many literary reviews and in this
entertainingly opinionated book. Leavis, who once remarked he was useful
in a rough-house, helped create our modern kick-ass culture.

MEMORIES
Claudia Schiffer
Mandarin, #9.99
IT'S ironic that Claudia Schiffer's favourite authors should be
Balzac, John Irving and Max Frish, as Memories, her life story in
pictures reads as if it were written by Fisher Price. But then it's a
little girl's pop-up book about a catwalk princess as published by
Hello!
Who else would read such a sentence: ''Her one vice is chocolate,
which she indulges from time to time. But after the craving is sated she
returns to light meals of fresh fruits and vegetables, and she never
exceeds her ideal weight of 126 pounds.''
In Memories we read how Claudia fell to 'flu before her Holy
Communion. It was two weeks before ''Schiffer was introduced to one of
the most meaningful rituals of her faith.''
Her calendars are world-wide best-sellers. She is the biggest blonde
since Bardot. The reason? ''Claudia . . . spends months studying the
photographs, selecting and rejecting and re-selecting them.''
So why did she package Memories up over a lunch-hour? It is a
scrap-book lay-out coupled with poorer pics that has a hastily-produced
feel as if Kate Moss caught Claudia on the hop.
It takes some amount of drivel to distract a guy from a beautiful
blonde but Memories achieves just that effect. ''. . . a provacative
adventuress or an insolent dandy, Claudia embodies the hidden sides that
are in all of us''. Enough!

FOLLOW YOUR HEART
by Susanna Tamaro.
translated by Avril Bardoni
publishers Secker &amp; Warburg.
price #10.
THIS slim volume has dominated the Italian best seller lists and sold
more than a million copies worldwide, having been translated into 18
languages. The reasons for its success are immediately obvious. It has
enormous charm and is packed with a philosophical wisdom we can
immediately understand; it is narrated with a beguiling simplicity and
intimacy so that the reader appears to have intruded upon a private
correspondence.
While November winds whip the family house, a nameless 80-year-old
woman is writing to her granddaughter in America. The girl has been gone
for two months and in that time the grandmother has suffered a serious
illness, maybe even a stroke. Though they made a pact, at the girls
insistence, not to write, the grandmother is surrounded by emptiness and
silence.
There is no middle ground. Not to write could be seen as petulant and
spiteful, whereas to simply justify her behaviour would annoy the
granddaughter. So, using one of the girls old exercise books, she is
providing what she calls a little record of her days ''. . . something
you can keep through the years, something you can read whenever you need
to feel me near you.''
Of course, it is neither as simple nor as straightforward. The couple
did not part well, and the grandmother feels some explanations are
needed. The granddaughter was tense and moody; the grandmother afraid to
speak, fearing whatever she said would result in a confrontation.
Old age and childhood are similar, she says. Both have a sense of
defenselessness, though there are times when ones responses are
spontaneous and open, yet she is reticent to the point of stoicism. She
implies she does not like to interfere and shows no evidence that this
is anything other than the truth, yet by not interfering she was forced
to watch her daughter destroy herself in circumstances similar to those
in which she and her granddaughter parted.
She was born at a time when children were a social duty and grew up to
be a kind of well trained ape rather than a human being. She could not,
however, prevent herself from a single, if continuous, act of rebellion.
Again, she does not say, but strongly implies this is why she endured
her daughters' wilful non-conformity and has paid for her granddaughter
to study abroad. By digging back she suspects she will discover a series
of women's lives like dead fireworks, dropping to Earth instead of
soaring to the sky. The constraints of family and society were
continuous and enduring, replaced by guilt and remorse. With a single
lie she destroyed three lives.
This series of love letters, explanations, and confessions gradually
reveal a power and dignity which is both tender and evocative. The most
enviable and compelling aspect is the natural way the tragedy unfolds,
as though the woman was pulling back the years layer by layer to reveal
something she suspected might have been the case, something she hoped
was still hidden, but which she knew was there and could barely admit,
even to herself.
There is no sense of self-justification. Rather it is a plea for
understanding from the older generation to the younger, a one-way
conversation that manages to skip round most of the obvious ''homely
similes based on the lore of the kitchen.'' We are told the
granddaughter detests the side of her nature which inspires goodness and
gentleness, yet the frustrations of old age and the power of relief
showed the grandmother at a point of understanding their impact and
worth. And if she has a tendency to learn from seemingly unlikely or
ill-defined sources, that is only because we suspect knowledge implies
ability, which is obviously not the case.

IN THE most unpleasant variety of severe, disruptive, and testing
weather at Carnoustie yesterday, the outcome of the Scottish Open
championship was certainly consigned to an Australian and an Englishman,
with an extremely disconsolate Scotsman probably condemned again to play
a supportive role.
This plot was devised only at the last hole at the end of a long day,
after Nick Faldo had made a routine par.
Wayne Riley's No.3 wood shot of 223 yards bounced short of, and over,
the Barry Burn on to the green. But Colin Montgomerie's second shot, of
230 yards slightly pushed, struck the far wall and bounced back into the
water.
The upshot was that Riley's 69, a most resourceful advance in the
conditions, gave him a total of 204, 12 under par, and a five-stroke
lead over Faldo.
Montgomerie, almost incandescent with frustration at having had two
putts on every green -- including the eighteenth, where he missed from
five feet for par -- took 75 for 210, probably too great an advantage to
concede.
The Scot said afterwards: ''That was my most frustrating day on a golf
course. I missed only two greens in regulation and I've never taken two
putts 18 times before. A 75 is hopeless, because the third round is so
important and I've blown it again.''
Indeed, after having had 13 birdies in the first 36 holes, Montgomerie
yesterday had none.
Montgomerie's only other loss amid 16 pars was at the third. His
approach from the left rough flew the green into a ghastly confection of
spear-like dune grass and other assorted rough on a downhill lie. His
recovery inevitably raced over the green and, having chipped back to
five feet, he missed.
Riley, by contrast, dropped two strokes with wayward drives at the
fifth and fifteenth. But his long-handled putter worked constructively
for him as it delivered single putts for three of his five birdies and
for two par saves.
This was a tenacious performance by a pugnacious player, who will
surely be difficult to dislodge.
Being without any kind of victory for four years applies its own
pressures, however, and Faldo is playing solidly enough to take
advantage of any slips his playing partner this afternoon may make.
In the mixture of wind and rain that afflicted the leaders from start
to finish, Faldo kept pace.
''In these conditions, and on a course this length, nine holes feel
like 14,'' he reflected. ''It was a tiring old day but I still felt I
let a really good score get away by misreading one or two putts,
particularly on the inward half. But I played well through the green.''
Three putts at the second and a bunkered second at the seventeeth were
Faldo's two concessions to the card. Against these debits were the
credits of a No.3-iron shot on to the long sixth, a No.3-iron shot to 20
feet at the ninth, and a wedge to 12 feet at the eleventh. Riley will
have to be alert to take the #108,330 first prize.
After the benign weather of the first two days, Riley seemed to speak
for many players when he said he would like to see how the course played
in a wind. Their hopes were answered in spades, as the Angus coastline
embraced the four seasons as its version of summer.
Play had scarcely begun in heavy rain when it was suspended for 50
minutes after sea mist had rolled in. Then, after a wet but
comparatively docile morning, the north-east wind which had prevailed in
the sunshine of the practice days renewed its strength -- this time with
a razor's edge -- until a tentative sun returned, then to be replaced by
more rain.
Golf as a metaphor for life's eternal struggle returned with a
vengeance, most vividly illustrated in the contrasting scores of two
games -- the 69s of Andrew Coltart and Domingo Hospital, who remarkably
did not drop a shot, compared with the 82 and 79 respectively of their
partners, Donnie Hammond and Manuel Pinero.
Of the scores returned by the 78 players who made the cut, 15 were on
the par of 72 or better, of which only three were below 70.
But the fact is that even in an almost defenceless state, these
7187-yard links are in need of little reinforcement.
A lively contest within the tournament, that between the amateur
champions of Britain and the United States, continued apace.
An amateur has never made the cut in the championship and thus a
silver quaich will go either to Gordon Sherry, round in 71 for 214 to be
leading Scot after Montgomerie in eleventh place, and Tiger Woods, who
had 75 to be a stroke behind.
Sherry was delighted to have had another round under par, 71, despite
having hit his second at the ninth into a ditch for a double bogey 6.
But he played the last six holes in three under to be home in 33,
chipping in from 15 feet for a 2 at the thirteenth and reaching the
512-yard fourteenth in two into the wind after having hit a 280-yard
tee-shot.
Remarkably for one who is so tall and heavy, Sherry has not wilted
after having had a club in his hand every day for almost a fortnight.
Indeed, not only has his scoring sustained him, yesterday he was
mightily pleased with the jumbo-headed driver he used for the first
time, an inch longer than standard to accommodate his 6ft 8in height.
Woods' talent has certainly not been suppressed in conditions almost
completely foreign to him. Once he had passed beyond his rocky start,
dropping three strokes in five holes, he covered the next 12 holes in
one under until the Barry Burn again claimed his ball and he finished
with a bogey 6.
The partnership of Paul Lawrie and David Feherty, both five under at
the start, by no means brought out the best in them. Altogether they
made 12 bogeys, six of them over that last fearsome run of six holes,
all but one of which, the seventeenth, faced into the uncomfortable
elements.
Similarly, Ian Woosnam and Sam Torrance, beginning five and three
under respectively, sank comparatively without trace to two over and
level par.
Woosnam had eight bogeys and Torrance had three double bogey 6s,
evidence that his victory in Ireland last weekend had at last taken its
toll of his stamina.
* JOSE Maria Olazabal, absent from the Irish and Scottish Opens
because of a painful tumour on his right foot, is ready to return in
next week's Open Championship at St Andrews.
The Spaniard arrives in Scotland today, but has been advised to rest
all he can before the Open starts on Thursday.
Olazabal's manager, Sergio Gomez, said: ''A week ago I was not at all
sure he would be able to play, but rest and some new medication have
improved his condition. He certainly won't be playing a full practice
round each day next week, though.''

FOOTBALL legend Sir Stanley Matthews is to play again -- at the age of
80! The former England wing wizard will play 15 minutes for Beazer Homes
League club Clevedon Town in a friendly match against Bristol City on
Sunday, July 30.
Clevedon's manager, Steve Fey, met Sir Stanley when he spoke at a
dinner in the Somerset town early in the summer. ''It was a bit cheeky,
but as a joke I asked him if he would consider signing on as a player
for us,'' said Fey.
''I nearly fell backwards when he said 'yes', but I jumped at the
chance. I had a Beazer League registration form with me, hoping to sign
another player, so I got Sir Stanley to sign it there and then.
''I asked him what he had earned in the 1953 FA Cup final and he told
me #4, 18 shillings (#4.90). I offered him double that, threw in a
little extra, and got him for a tenner. It has to be the steal of the
century!''
The match at the Hand Stadium is in honour of Clevedon's retiring
president Doug Hand and will have free admission.

PAUL Gascoigne made his first appearance for Rangers last night -- and
scored the Ibrox club's opening goal in their closed-door clash with
Stirling Albion.
The game took place at Forthbank Stadium, where strict security made
certain that the SFA rules were enforced and that no-one, apart from
club officials, was allowed to watch the game.
Gascoigne scored the first goal and played for threequarters of the
match. The other Rangers goals came from Ally McCoist, Alexei
Mikhailichenko and Ian Durrant.
A Stirling Albion official said later: ''It was a good work-out for us
and for Rangers, and Gascoigne looked impressive.''
Meanwhile, Rangers' European Cup preliminary round match against
Famagusta at Ibrox on August 9 will be shown live on STV.
An STV spokesman said last night: ''There is fabulous interest in the
match and it will be a sell-out crowd on the night.''
STV are also contemplating beaming live the second leg a fortnight
later.
Rangers remain hopeful that they can complete the #3m signing of
Romanian Florin Raducioiu over the weekend. The Espanol striker has
insisted that he wishes to remain with the Spanish club, but Ibrox
manager Walter Smith said yesterday: ''I met the player's agent last
night and had further discussions. These will be ongoing.''

ON THE day when the door firmly closed on any chance Celtic had of
landing Anderlecht's Marc Degryse, the Parkhead club yesterday announced
that they are certain to sell a record number of season tickets -- even
although no new faces have been brought to the club.
Earlier this summer, Celtic seemed to have clinched the signing of
talented Degryse but the deal fell through, and yesterday the Belgian
captain looked to be heading for Sheffield Wednesday for a #1.5m fee. He
has agreed a three-year deal and is expected to complete the move next
week.
Better news for Celtic is that it looks more and more likely that
midfielder John Collins, who has a year left of his contract, will be
staying. And the club's Albanian defender Rudi Vata could be offered a
new one-year contract after it looked like he was on his way out.
Meanwhile, club spokesman Peter McLean said: ''At the moment, we have
sold in excess of 18,000 season tickets for our return to Parkhead, so
we are on target for a record number of sales. Everything is on schedule
for our return to playing at Parkhead and our capacity next season will
be 34,000.''
* THE FA confirmed yesterday that they will ask FIFA to invoke a
global ban on George Graham, the former Arsenal manager, who has been
suspended from the game for a year after taking #425,000 in ''bungs''. A
FIFA ban would ruin Graham's hope of pursuing a career abroad in the
interim.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
GEORGE McGuire did not begin playing cricket until he was around the
16 mark, and at 31 now, he regards himself as a veteran. So when the
medium-pace bowler says that his side, Stirling County, have one of
their strongest squads for years, it is time to sit up and take notice.
''We used to have to rely on four or five good players including the
pro, but this year, we have a nucleus of around 13 players. We can bat
well right up to eight or nine, and we are also bowling well.''
All of which, of course, means that third-placed Stirling must fancy
their chances against leaders Aberdeenshire at Williamfield today. And
with minimal percentage points separating the sides, probably the
deciding factor will be the Stirling pitch, not renowned for being
batsman friendly after rain.
Second-placed Ayrshire also are going well, and they aim to follow up
their win against Fifeshire last week at home to a Forfarshire side, who
may be lying seventh in the table, but who still could cause damage in
the Counties title race if they could put a couple of victories under
their belts.

EAST LEAGUE
THE aura of invincibility which has surrounded Heriot's through their
all-conquering run in the Ryden East League was somewhat compromised
when they were beaten by Carlton in the final of the Masterton Trophy in
midweek.
Observers from Royal High were in attendance and will have gained in
confidence for their encounter at Goldenacre. Doubtless that will be
reinforced when they learn that neither Mike Allingham nor Jim Love is
available for the leaders.
Victory was not without its cost to Carlton. Hugh Parker, whose
extended resistence almost salvaged victory last week, was forced to
retire with a back strain and may miss the trip to Watsonians.
Corstorphine's recent run of victories has propelled them up the table
and they await the visit of Grange without trepidation. A cup century
for Jamie Frost last Sunday may have earned him a place in the Grange
line-up.
That leaves Falkland and Edinburgh Academicals scrapping it out at the
bottom. Both are at home, Accies to Freuchie and Falkland to
Stenhousemuir.

TOUR de FRANCE
FRENCHMAN Laurent Jalabert staged a Bastille Day revolt against
cycling king Miguel Indurain in the Tour de France yesterday and came
ominously close to toppling him from his throne.
The 222 kilometres twelfth stage through the gentle slopes of the
Massif Central from St Etienne had looked perfect for some gentle
holiday riding, but the Frenchman had other ideas when he made a
surprise attack after only 24 kilometres.
For quite a large part of the second half of the stage Jalabert

jersey, at one point finding himself 10 minutes 50 seconds ahead of

WESTERN UNION
THE fact that all four semi-final places in the Whyte &amp; Mackay
Scottish Cup have been allocated to D M Hall Western Union clubs may say
something about the level of competition in that league.
Clydesdale have a clear lead and can probably only trip themselves up
en route to the title. The clubs behind them, though, have been playing
a merry game of musical chairs with only seven percentage points
separating four clubs.
Greenock moved back into second-top berth last weekend and today face
the side directly below them, Poloc. For the trip to Shawholm, Charlie
Stewart takes command in the absence of David Thomson, with former
Scotland all-rounder Peter Duthie back to open the batting and bowling.
Kelburne, who take on fifth-placed West of Scotland, have become
detached from the top five. What ambitions they have of climbing back
into the top half of the table were dented yesterday when Roger
Telemachus flew back to South Africa to play for the under-24 side.
Ayr meet Ferguslie, while its top v bottom at Bothwell, Uddingston
against Clydesdale.

BENSON and HEDGES CUP
THE bookies don't often get it wrong in a two-horse race, and that
fact that Lancashire have been installed as 9-4 on favourites to beat
Kent in today's Benson and Hedges Cup final at Lord's tells its own
story.
The smart money is still going on the Red Rose county, even though
they have lost two Test players through injury, with a third still
doubtful.
England seamer Peter Martin and opener Jason Gallian are certainly
out, Martin with ligament damage, the latter suffering the effects of a
fiery Test debut against the West Indies where he managed 7, 0, and a
broken finger.
The other major concern is one-day specialist Neil Fairbrother. His
troublesome left hamstring has responded to treatment. However, it may
take another examination this morning to decide whether the
hard-running, fleet-footed bat and fielder is worth risking.
Lancashire, though, have enough names in their line-up to beat Kent.
And, one in particular could prove to be the difference between the
sides.
Pakistan all-rounder Wasim Akram beat Worcestershire almost
single-handed in the semi-final, and he often saves his best for when
the silverware is on show.
Kent, meanwhile, will select their XI from a squad of 13, which
includes left-arm spinner Min Patel and pace bowler Alan Igglesden.
Wicketkeeper Steve Marsh will captain the side in the absence of
regular skipper Mark Benson, ruled out by yet another broken finger.
Kent though, will be pinning much of their hopes on Sri Lankan Test
batsman Aravinda de Silva, who has been in outstanding form with the
blade.

THE feud between world champion Michael Schumacher, of Benetton, and
Williams' Damon Hill, and their suggestions that they may be leaving
their current teams at the end of this season, have monopolised
attention around Silverstone in the build-up to tomorrow's British Grand
Prix, but another battle also is underway and this one involves David
Coulthard.
It is believed that the Scot and his team-mate, Hill, who responded to
the alarming degree of jingoism generated by 37,000 fans at Silverstone
by producing the fastest time in yesterday's practice session, will not
be driving in the same livery next season because the mighty
Rothmans-Williams-Renault team have already decided one of them will
have to be ditched.
Much will depend on what the drivers achieve in the second half of the
season when Coulthard, who is 22 points behind second-placed Hill,
declares the world will see the best of his skills, but he already may
have shown enough to the people who matter, his employers.
Informed opinion says team leader Frank Williams will probably stick
with the Scot at the end of the season because he is more than 10 years
younger and more naturally gifted than his English colleague, who has
not been slow to make it clear he has already started talking to
prospective employers.
Hill, whose contract expires at the end of the season, has entered
into outside negotiations because he believes he should be paid more
than the #2m he is on just now and is looking for a salary in the region
of #5m.
Although he will not be drawn on the subject, it is likely he also
feels he is due more respect from the Williams team who, he believes,
should have ordered Coulthard to adopt a supporting role in the
remaining races.
Schumacher also is seeking an increased income from his current #5m to
#15m, but is unlikely to get that easily from Benetton, although they
would have to reconsider if, for instance, Williams, who have been
willing to pay truly exceptional drivers big money -- the late Ayrton
Senna was on #17m, decided to seek Schumacher's signature for next
season.
Renault have supplied both teams with the same engines yet Schumacher
is consistently quicker on race days and, while Hill would point to
mechanical problems with his machine, his employers, in turn, would say
quietly that their man and car seem to do well in practice.
Many experts believe Schumacher would still win more grands prix than
anyone else even if he were to change cars with Hill, and perhaps
Williams are approaching that same conclusion.
Maybe they fancy a team of Schumacher and Coulthard, the champion and
the heir apparent.
Williams may take the view that unless Hill makes up an 11-point
deficit in the second half of the season and delivers the world title it
would be wiser to call time on him. Frank Williams will not allow
emotion to cloud his judgment.
If Schumacher, who is leading the procession with 46 points and who
had looked ominous on track yesterday until Hill's thrilling 1min
28.124sec lap towards the end of the hour-long practice session, retains
his crown he will, in fact, be able to name his price, but nothing will
happen regarding driver line-ups until after he has decided on which
team he wishes to drive towards glory.
Coulthard, who is being paid #500,000 for his season, watches
developments from a distance and, although he feels comfortable with his
position within the Williams set-up, he is desperate to win his first
grand prix.
This will be his sixteenth start and his time of 1-28.947 yesterday,
which gave him provisional third place, will have to be improved upon.
''I believe I can do that,'' he said after yesterday's efforts. ''It
was very blustery out there and it never felt like my car was connected
from front to rear.
''Maybe it was an effect of the wind, but I just feel there was
something not quite right and I am sure I will get more out of the car
tomorrow. Third is all right, I suppose, but I am disappointed not to
have done better today.''
However, Coulthard, like Schumacher, who is the closest driver to
Senna in that he is a perfectionist, has spent many hours testing in
race trim, that is with a full tank and on worn rubber and perhaps that
will tell when they leave the grid tomorrow.
''Given that I was not too far behind Damon and Michael today I don't
think pole position is beyond me,'' he said. ''Also, this being the home
grand prix makes it a little more special and it would be wonderful to
win here.''
Coulthard has recovered from his bout of tonsillitis and says he is
feeling much better physically, but it might be another fortnight, at
Hockenheim, before he is at his strongest.
Schumacher, who spun off after only a lap into his second run,
returned after having had his car checked over and posted his time which
made him the first to break 1-29 and must have thought that would be
enough, but Hill was winding up for a big one.
''This was a good signal, a strong message to send to Michael,'' he
said. ''He knows now I won't let him have it all his own way.
''The pressure was on me because Michael had gone quickly, but I am
more motivated right now than I have ever been to win and Sunday is all
that matters.''
Come that day when 90,000 fans will jostle for vantage points around
the 3.14-mile circuit, Hill and Schumacher would be wise to leave their
more basic emotions in the pits because there have been signs recently
that the mutual dislike which has been simmering and festering for some
time is in danger of spilling over.
Mostly it has been playground stuff but if either or both lose hold of
the calculating professionalism needed to negotiate successfully and
safely any grand prix circuit Schumacher and Hill could find themselves
racing towards disaster rather than improved contracts. Provisional

SEASONED punters and young families with children will rub shoulders
at Ayr tomorrow when the Scotland's first Sunday race meeting with
betting is staged on the 88-year-old Craigie racecourse.
Traditionally, the first weekend of the Glasgow Fair holiday attracts
large crowds to the beach at Ayr and the myriad of attractions on offer
at Butlin's Wonderwest World further down the coast.
Tomorrow, many of those day-trippers will stop short of the seaside
and head instead for Scotland's premier racecourse in Whitletts Road and
a world previously unknown to them of sinewy thoroughbreds thundering on
the turf at 35mph or more.
Also new to the many debutant racegoers will be the bellowing
bookmakers and the tictac men who telegraph the odds by mysterious arm
signals -- as demonstrated by John McCririck on TV most Saturday
afternoons.
If the sun shines a crowd of 10,000 is expected, not as many as on
Scottish Grand National Day or for the Ayr Gold Cup in September, but a
lot more than at recent meetings.
There have been 10 Sunday meetings so far at such courses as
Newmarket, the headquarters of racing, Epsom, the home of the Derby, and
Chepstow, the popular course in South Wales.
The trend has been for a large turnout of fun-seeking, first-time
racegoers (38%), with many bringing children (25%).
All the evidence is that it will happen again, at least that is the
hope and expectation of Mark Kershaw, general manager of Ayr's Western
Meeting Club who has planned a programme of family entertainment, with
help from his many friends including the bookmakers.
The fun starts at 11.30 -- 2[3/4] hours before the first race -- with
the Dalmellington Brass Band, followed by a falconry display, Disney
characters from Wonderwest World, a Punch and Judy show, and a magic
show.
That is not all. A children's play area has been set out -- well apart
from the sharp end of the racing itself -- with bouncy castle, juggler,
stilt walker, unicyclist, face painting, coconut shys, target crossbows,
a wheel of fortune, and a children's creche.
To the genuine enthusiasts and racing purists this may smack of
trivialising the sport of kings for short-term gain in attendance
figures.
To others closer to racing, the British Horseracing Board who have
allocated #276,000 towards promoting ''Sunday is Funday at the Races''
and local racecourse officials like Kershaw, it is sound investment in
the future.
Kershaw explained: ''No-one knows exactly how young people are
persuaded to become regular racegoers, but we are hoping that for some
at least the excitement of a race meeting, with medium-to-good quality
horses and some top-name jockeys taking part, will leave a lasting
impression. Even if a small percentage are converted that can only be
good for racing.''
He insists that the serious business of the race meeting itself,
although infected by a carnival atmosphere, will not be affected in any
way.
There are six races with total prize-money of more than #40,000,
including the feature race, the Tennent Trophy Rated Stakes, over a mile
and seven furlongs which has prize-money of #12,750.
Last year's winner, Batabanoo, trained by Mary Reveley and running in
the colours of Peter Savill, who owns Celtic Swing, is expected to take
part.
David McClymont, of sponsors Tennent Caledonian, admitted to being
excited by the prospect of taking part in Scotland's first Sunday
meeting.
He said: ''I love the sights, sounds, and smells of racing. Its
incredibly exhilarating.''
Let's hope everyone at Ayr feels the same when the last bookie's
ticket has been torn up, the last hamburger sold, and the last child
reclaimed from the creche around tea-time tomorrow.

YOUSH looks set to go off hot favourite for the John Smith's Magnet
Cup at York today after having beaten half-a-dozen of his rivals only a
week ago. However, his trainer, Michael Jarvis, is worried that this
race may have come too soon, which suggests caution about backing him at
short odds.
Naked Welcome looks as if he has been laid out for this race and I
will take the value on him. He ran well at Royal Ascot on his seasonal
debut and finished as if he would score over the extra trip.
Each-way backers should try Sherman, who is at long odds after
disappointing at Epsom, but won at a smart price over course and
distance in May.
The Foster's Cup can fall to Saxon Maid, who should be suited by this
step up in distance and only needs to reproduce the form of her third to
Beauchamp Hero at Epsom to score here.
The winner has since taken big races at Ascot and Newmarket, while
Saxon Maid reversed the form with runner-up, Waiting, on her most recent
run.
A five-furlong race for two-year-olds is hardly the safest betting
medium, but attention should be paid to the Weatherbys Super Sprint at
Newbury.
Blue Iris, Home Shopping, and Marl could all be big names by this time
next year, though Ortolan appears to be progressing better than any of
them and carries my vote.
Dance Turn was outpaced at the Curragh by the promising Darney, but
can atone over the 10-furlongs of the Steventon Stakes.
The son of Damister has been crying out for a trip and possesses a
touch of class that should see off these rivals.
Surprisingly, Paradise Navy has not been raised for his past three
efforts, all sound performances in well-contested handicaps, and can
take advantage in Chester's Summer Handicap.

TRYING to unearth the motivation that must fuel the psyche of Sam
Torrance, a man who has maintained a long-term presence at the top level
of golf, one of the most demanding and competitive sports, is not a task
you should tackle with undue optimism.
If there is a touch of the pragmatic Scot about Torrance, any other
pragmatic Scot, even interviewers, would recognise its validity. But the
job has to be attempted. If you ask Torrance, who has now spent 24 years
on the European Tour, how he has managed to endure so successfully, he
will give you a four-word answer: ''Love of the game.'' Press him
further, and he will tell you: ''Love of the game. Absolutely.''
That is about as far as he goes, and maybe he has got it right. The
evidence would suggest he has discovered something rather profound, even
if he couches it in simplicity.
It was not the Tour as we know it today when the 18-year-old lad from
Largs set out on his great adventure. In fact the birth of the properly
structured real European circuit was still three years away. When it did
begin in 1975, the prize money was #427,000. Last year, it was more than
#19m.
Torrance has gathered in his fair share of the shekels along the way,
but if that had been the motivation, he could have settled for the
fireside and slippers life long since.
He is not likely to opt for the easy way for some time yet, even if
one reason that his form has been so consistent in recent years is the
family base that has made him a contented man.
Wife Suzanne, children Daniel (5), Phoebe (3) and new arrival Anouska,
have given Torrance a sound emotional base from which to attack the only
real ambition he ever held -- ''to be a top golfer.''
He has now won 20 European Tour titles and nine others around the
world, including five Scottish Professional Championships. Spread over
24 years, it is a record which is a testament to a swing that was
fashioned, refined, and polished under the careful eye of dad Bob, one
of the best golf teachers in the world.
Sam rarely misses an opportunity to point out Bob's contribution to
his success, as he did last week when he recalled a lesson from dad
which helped win the Murphy's Irish Open.
It is a relationship which seems to be as enduring as Sam's swing, but
he will admit that they do argue and disagree often enough. ''When it
comes to golf, he is always right,'' he says.
He feels that he has been very fortunate to have his father as a
coach. ''Who wouldn't?''
Sam does not see Bob or mum June as often as he would like since he
shifted home from his birthplace to Wentworth a few years ago. ''The
move has turned out to be the right one. I did it because of the
constant travelling up and down from Scotland for flights abroad. Now I
am only 10 minutes from Heathrow. I am home every Sunday night even when
I win.''
The consistency of his game has enabled him to play in seven Ryder
Cups, with the eighth guaranteed later this year. Why the passion for
the team tournament?
''It has always been special to me. The Ryder Cup was something I
wanted to be part of from the very beginning. I enjoyed my first one in
1981, even though I was hammered, and I am not finished with it yet,
either.'' He insists that the players still think it is a ''fantastic''
event and blames the press (here we go again) for hyping up the rivalry
between Europe and America.
Torrance reiterates that he intends to be part of it for a while yet.
''People think because I have been around a long time I am ready for
retiring. I am a long way from that. Hell, I'm only 41.''
He is not sure if his game is better than it was when he was 30 but is
certain that it is more consistent...''and I think that comes with
maturity.''
As one of the few who have seen the Tour through 20 years of growth,
Sam's views on the state of the party are worth hearing. He has few
criticisms and only sees only one real problem to be solved.
''Appearance money is the one fault that has to be sorted out. It is
officially banned on the Tour, but we know it goes on.''
His own feeling is that appearance money should not be paid on your
own Tour. ''But if I am invited to play in the Far East or elsewhere,
and they want to pay me, I would take it.'' A man of clear cut opinions,
Torrance also has no doubts about the future for Scottish golf.
''There are some tremendous young players coming along at the moment.
Players like Dean Robertson and Andrew Coltart should do great things
and amateurs Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher have immense potential.
''I just wish the amateur lads would turn pro now. You can't beat that
experience.'' His own idol when he was their age was Jack Nicklaus, who
then became the best player he ever played with. Next in line are Lee
Trevino and Nick Faldo, choices that wouldn't cause too much heated
argument among the aficionados.
Sam might well be a hero to a few young Scots thrashing around the
public courses at the moment, and he has every intention of giving them
more reason to applaud.
''There is a lot I haven't done, like win a major.'' Winning The Open
would be ''the ultimate'' and if he managed it at St Andrews next week
the celebrations might last until the start of the new millenium. ''I
know it so well and I like the place so much that it would be
unbelievable to win there.''
Win or lose there, Sam seems to have discovered the secret of long
life on the golf tour. And, like Al Jolson, he insists we ain't seen
nothin' yet.

WITH the era of Britain's middle-distance athletics giants -- Coe,
Ovett, Cram, and Elliot -- now merely a nostalgic chapter in the history
books, Govan-born David Strang was hailed as a leading contender to don
their mantle.
All seemed to be going to plan when, on his indoor debut for Britain,
he won world championship silver in Toronto. The next act, his outdoor
senior debut, produced a classic 1500m victory over the USA at
Meadowbank.
For an encore, he began last year by capturing the European indoor
1500m title in Paris with a blistering finish. Intelligent and polished,
charming and articulate, he had it all going for him.
There were no gaps in the script, and Strang seemed on course to
fulfil his dream of continuing the UK tradition with distinction by
racing the metric mile next year at the Atlanta Olympics.
Last season he reached the 1500m final at both the European and
Commonwealth Games, and is already fastest UK miler this summer.
In pursuit of his goals, Stanford graduate Strang put his academic
career on hold, and admits it is largely the earnings of his high-flying
American wife, Ginny, which have ''kept the coffers full'' during a
protracted legal battle with the US Immigration and Naturalisation
Service.
So with world championship places at stake this weekend at the KP AAA
Championships in Birmingham, you might anticipate Strang lining up 100%
committed to all-out effort in today's 1500m heats, with solid hopes of
winning a place in Britain's squad, which is due to be announced on
Monday.
The championship publicity machine, pointing out that title-winners
are nominated automatically, has been touting Strang as a team contender
all week. But several competitors are in for a surprise today. Not least
former European 800m champion Tom McKean, along with whom Strang won
Commonwealth relay silver five years ago in Auckland.
For Strang, devastated by a crisis of confidence, cannot face the
1500m. He will race the 800m, challenging McKean for a world place. As
second-fastest Briton outdoors this summer over two laps, his sudden
switch will throw the event into the melting pot.
Most athletes would view reaching two major championship finals as
success. But Strang has carried a fearful burden through the winter. For
at the Europeans, in Helsinki, and the Commonwealth Games, in Victoria,
he finished last.
''That was a pretty ignominious double, and it has devastated my
confidence,'' confessed Strang. ''I cannot go on, at the moment, at
1500m, and I'm switching to the 800m in the hope that I can recapture
and rebuild my confidence.
''I ran the 1500m in the grand prix at Crystal Palce last weekend and
could finish only eleventh, in 3min 39.94sec.
''Logic tells you that most British runners would be delighted to have
made the team for both major championships of the season, and to have
reached the finals. But to finish last in both, to have run so badly,
has torn me apart. I have failed totally to come to terms with it.
''I believed I simply lacked the strength to go three rounds, and
geared my winter training to building that strength, even giving up the
indoor season. But there was more to it than that.
''I consulted a sports psychologist about six weeks ago, and believe
I'm on the way to sorting it out. I know the problem is mental, and I'm
man enough to admit it. I put extreme pressure on myself to succeed, but
I have to get the feeling of confidence back, and to enjoy my running
again. I believe that racing over 800m will do that -- and I will be
very disappointed if I don't gain a place in the 800m for Gothenburg. I
think I am quite capable of winning the title this weekend.''
Strang ran the 800m for Scotland at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, and
ran a tenth-of-a-second faster than McKean in the silver medal-winning
4X400m relay squad. ''I am only picking up an event I already know well.
I would walk into the team this year with my best 800m time, 1-45.8,
which I did in 1992. Then I was only fifth best in Britain, and failed
to make it to the Olympics. It just shows how the event has gone
downhill. But the way I'm running, I've a better chance of going to the
worlds at the shorter distance.
''I'd do anything to keep my Olympic hopes alive. Another bad 1500m
championship performance could have had a very negative impact on the
selectors. If I was a marginal choice for the Olympics next year, and
the most recent championship memory was of me finishing last, twice,
then I probably would not be chosen. I have to lay the ghost now.''
Strang, second-fastest Briton this year behind Curtis Robb,
acknowledges: ''It could come down to Tom and me for the world place,
but that's athletics. I have to do what is good for me, for my career.''
Financially, it is a brave decision, for all Strang's bonuses with his
shoe sponsor, New Balance, are geared to 1500m.
Strang cannot have been helped in his mental preparation by family
illness. His father, Alex, who lives in Johannesburg, has suffered a
recurrence of cancer. David arranged for him to be treated as an
experimental patient at the National Cancer Centre in Maryland. ''His
illness puts everything in perspective. But by living with us in
Washington, it has given me the chance to see him for longer than I have
been able in years. I will be running for him this weekend.''

ONE thing that I learned pretty quickly in South Africa is that I
don't like being lied to. Me and Roy Laidlaw were standing there in
Newlands stadium one sunny Sunday morning as the only two outsiders
watching the South African team training, and we got the chance to talk
to James Small and Kitch Christie.
''How much do you get for playing rugby then?'' I asked them both,
rather shyly. Spluttering denials were followed by ''expenses'' and
''travel allowances'' and the rest. And all along, I knew that they were
fibbing.
I had, after all, just got it from someone rather high in Western
Province that their good players didn't work, were tied to the Province
by contract, and got a grand a week, all year, to play for them -- and
that was before win bonuses.
I arrived home only this weekend after Big Jill and the troops had
come out to South Africa to join me for a wee post-World Cup break, and
the talk over there was all about the rebellion from the top players
over the money they received playing for Transvaal.
What was clear all along was that this was not so much a demand for
money, it was a demand for an increase in money. They were getting paid
already! They just wanted it ratified in contracts -- probably after
having heard Joel Stransky's chat about the cash he gets at Western
Province.
Uli Schmidt, the former Springbok hooker who was the liaison man
between the rebels and Luis Luyt before he was replaced by Francois
Pienaar, let slip in a moment's bitterness that the players should have
been happy with their lot because they were receiving more than 15,000
rand per month, before win bonuses, as it was. Allowing for the buying
power of the rand in South Africa, that is worth roughly 5000 quid. I
reckon that, given win bonuses, the Transvaal players were earning the
equivalent of #100,000 a year from rugby.
And all along the South African rugby authorities have denied
point-blank that they paid their boys. What a flaming sham it has been.
I even watched the likeable chief executive of the SA RFU, Ed Griffiths
-- their Bill Hogg figure, if you like -- state quite boldly on TV that,
in his opinion, the top rugby players in South Africa were
''under-remunerated.'' I thought they were amateur. Shows how naive I
am.
Now, of course, Pienaar and his pals have called off their action
after discussions with the SA RFU until a decision is reached from the
International Board talks on amateurism in early August. It is patently
obviously there's a tactic to keep the matter a little under wraps, and
off the front pages of the sports sections until then.
And no more than that.
But what all of this lying and double-dealing, and outright fibbery
has meant is that world rugby, to use a phrase, has not been fought on a
level playing field for many a year. South Africa, a beautiful country,
went about trying to win the World Cup with a venom more usually
reserved for Iron Curtain countries trying to prove the value of their
system in the 1970s and early '80s.
They wanted their fledgling land of varying colours to unite under
''one team -- one country;'' they wanted to win badly, and they did
everything in their power to make it all happen.
There's nothing wrong with that, as long as you play to the rules that
govern everyone else in the world. But if you break the rules, and lie
about it to a massive extent in the process, and if you pay your players
so that, unlike Gavin Hastings, for instance, they don't actually have
to put in a nine-to-five stint at the office or building site, then that
isn't fair. It is cheating.
It is cheating to a massive degree.
Just what are the ramifications, God only knows. If you were to play
it by the book, then you would take the World Cup back off them, tell
them they have been naughty boys, and smack their bottoms right hard.
Trouble is, of course, that the French pay their players, the New
Zealanders are about to, the Italians do, the Welsh have done in the
past. You can't retrospectively ban everyone.
What it all means to Scotland is that unless we, as a country, put in
place a system where our players have the same advantages and
opportunities as those from other countries, then we can never beat
them. There's no point playing a game to lose, is there?
We could have brilliant players, but if they don't train and practise
the same as the South Africans, then they can never beat them. I repeat
-- they can never beat them.
If the game is going professional, then we should be vigorous in
embracing it. It doesn't smell good to me, but there is absolutely no
point in playing a game to come second-best. And we should be open about
it. I just hate being flaming-well lied to.
Well, wouldn't you?

A BOLD and imaginative, possibly money-spinning, educational link
between rural and urban communities was launched at Perth yesterday.
At a market, which is the home for world renowned pedigree cattle
sales, United Auctions opened the doors of the Perth Mart Visitor
Centre.
The start may have been overshadowed by a religious convention in the
nearby McDiarmid Park but there is confidence among its backers that the
centre will draw in thousands of tourists who use the main north-south
road, including coach parties.
United Auctions have spent less than #400,000 developing a special
animal farm, theatre, and car park but believe that its four-times-a-day
Highland Farm Life Show will be a money earner.
In a new 150-seat theatre they are staging a display of livestock that
sets out much of what is important in the development of Scottish
agriculture.
The ''stars'' include and Aberdeen-Angus cow with calf, a Blackface
ram, a North Country Cheviot ewe with lambs, a Cashmere goat, Shetland
and Highland ponies, a Clydesdale horse and, of course, a Highland cow
called Morag who is admired by adults and youngsters alike.
Next door to the theatre is the animal farm where the public can see
livestock and which is to include outdoors paddocks within the next few
months.
Alan McGregor, chief executive of United Auctions, said this unique
centre could be repeated elsewhere in the group's auction market chain.
''At a relatively new auction market site like this we had available
land and the prospects of utilising it for the retail/tourism market,''
he said.
The retail centre offers a range of knitwear and souvenir goods and
the adjacent market complex includes catering facilities.
Organiser Fergus Wood said: ''We try to show the public our Scottish
livestock in as natural a way as possible and tell them something of
their history and how they have influenced our rural economy and
industries.
''We hope this will be an added-value project to our auctioneering
business, bringing the agricultural and general publics closer
together.''
The ''players'' in the Highland Farm Life Show had two days of
rehearsals in the small theatre ring before yesterday's launch but for
some they appeared to have been born to appear before audiences of
cheering children.

SO you've tried total quality management. Did the earth move? Probably
not. The quality of your company's output may have improved, but somehow
this failed to translate into bottom-line benefit.
What about teams and empowerment? I bet that caused a lot of confusion
and worry at first, even if things subsequently settled down. As we
learned to our cost in our business, the concept of teamwork is a
complex and subtle one to introduce into an organisation and requires a
major commitment to employee education and communication. It does
deliver benefits, but only for as long as that commitment is there from
management.
Perhaps you are now heavily into re-engineering: you've seen the
video, attended the course, and read the book. Naturally, the word has
already spread to every corner of the organisation that big job cuts are
on the way. Morale is plummeting, productivity is following fast and you
are already in trouble even before you get to deliver the bad news.
Whether you have tried all or none of these solutions, you would
probably agree that most managements these days spend a fair proportion
of their time trying to do things better. To put it another way,
managers are desperately insecure about the methods they use to run
their businesses.
All they are sure about is that the traditional top-down,
chain-of-command style no longer works they way it once did, given the
competitive forces upon every business these days. The structure of
business direction and control has crumbled and as yet there seems no
compelling new model of how to organise people more effectively for more
profit.
If a company's success depends on its people, which seems obvious, the
logical conclusion is that everyone in the organisation should be
encouraged and perhaps persuaded to make the maximum possible
contribution their talents and energies allow. Enter, then, the latest
buzzwords in the management lexicon.
This time it's ''open book management''. It's spreading rapidly
throughout the US, and although no-one has yet emerged proclaiming
themselves the open book guru, you can bet that pretty soon disciples
will begin to market the concept here as the ultimate solution for
business effectiveness.
Before that hype arrives, let's examine what it really involves. There
are three main elements:
* Every employee sees -- and is helped to understand -- the company's
regular financial figures, thus learning to track performance by the
week and the month. The key numbers are on display, on the flipchart, in
the handout and on the computer network. This is why it is called open
book: employees know whether their company is making money, and why.
* They are trained to accept that no matter what their job, part of
their responsibility is to move those key numbers in the right
direction. They may be sales executives, machine operators,
receptionists or stock controllers -- but they are also part of the
business and have a responsibility to each other for their own
performance and that of their department or unit.
* They receive direct shares of the profit on a regular basis, perhaps
monthly. No profit, no share; just the basic wage.
In one sense open book management is quite revolutionary. It requires
a degree of trust between managers and employees that is rarely
experienced in this country. Although larger companies tend to be
reasonably open with their financial figures, I suspect few
owner-managers in Scotland provide their people with even the briefest
summary of annual results.
In another sense this merely takes the team concept and all that
follows, including empowerment and profit-sharing, to its logical
conclusion and is not revolutionary at all.
Now to the $64,000 question: does it really work? There is growing
case study evidence from the US business press, including INC and the
Harvard Business Review, that quite remarkable results are possible. The
story I liked was of the vice-president of a large manufacturer visiting
a booming supplier to check out this open book stuff. He asked one shop
floor employee whether he knew the price of the crankshaft he was
machining. ''List price or dealer net?'' asked the machinist, before
going on to explain the two and how his own cost component was
calculated.
It does seem clear that open book management will only work if the
people concerned are instinctively and emotionally able to accept such a
fundamental shift in attitudes. Given our prevailing culture in
Scotland, I would not be over-optimistic of its widespread acceptance
here.
Alastair Balfour is managing director of the Insider Group.

Nick Dillon, European marketing manager of Motorola's High Performance
Division, wasted no time getting to the top in his chosen career. Now,
he tells John Buchanan, he has his sights set on new opportunities in
the rapidly expanding world of microprocessors
NICK Dillon was a confident young man when he left Motorola five years
ago to join a sales and marketing consultancy. He had every reason to
be. After all at 29, only six years after leaving Glasgow University
with a degree in electronics, he had risen to become Motorola's European
promotions manager and had two years experience of working in Paris
under his belt.
The young go-getter left the company having put in place a successful
university marketing strategy which had seen it donate expensive
merchandise to leading European universities. This not only attracted
Europe-wide press coverage but also meant that up and coming computer
scientists and designers became accustomed to working with Motorola
products in their university labs. The company is, of course, hoping
this habit will stick with them when they move on into industry.
A clever strategy most people would agree, and it gave Dillon the
right to feel confident of success in his new career as a consultant in
sales and marketing. To make things easier his new employer gave him an
intensive six-month course in both areas.
After his training stint he was presented with a desk in the firm's
Glasgow office, where his boss told him to find some new business for
the consultancy. ''Easy, or so I believed,'' says Dillon. ''All I
thought I had to do was phone up a few managing directors and arrange
interviews with them to get some business.''
Eight hours, and 112 calls later, he had a different view about how
easy it is to drum up new business. ''At the end of the day all I had to
show for my efforts was three appointments, and even these were not all
successful,'' he says.
He admits to asking himself what he had done leaving a company such as
Motorola. The exercise taught him that finding new business was not so
simple after all, although he says he later became good at it. ''After
two years in this consultancy I moved to the Strathclyde Institute where
we regularly won business from the big six, and that was a great
feeling.''
In January of this year a wiser, more experienced Dillon returned to
Motorola as European marketing manager in its High Performance Division.
''In the five years I was away I learnt what was involved in winning
business. It doesn't just happen, and I know what it means to run a
small to medium-sized company. I can see things from a customer's
perspective now,'' he explains as we settle down in a meeting room at
Motorola's East Kilbride plant.
At 34 he has been given the task of spearheading the company's drive
to dominate the European high performance microprocessor market. He
starts from a strong position. The East Kilbride plant, which employs
around 2500, already has 70% of the European market share of the 32-bit
embedded microprocessor market. In layman's terms this is the
microprocessor in equipment such as our TV sets, mobile phones, printers
and data organisers.
The Scottish plant is also the number one in Europe when it comes to
supplying the microprocessors for satellite set top boxes. ''Everyone
wants to take that position from us,'' he says. ''We must make sure that
we supply what our customers want if we are to continue to be
successful.''
However, he is confident of not only maintaining the company's pole
position but also expanding it as more devices than ever require the
additional computer power. He points to the new generation of printers
which incorporate fax machines and photocopiers in the one box as an
example of how the industry is developing. ''Combining these functions
in a single machine requires a lot of computer performance.''
AT East Kilbride Motorola designed and now manufactures the 68000
processor which was launched in 1993 to meet customers' specific needs.
''We have a world-class operation here. I am very proud we have such a
facility in Scotland and to be part of it,'' Dillon says.
In the past it could take up to two years to produce a new custom
designed microprocessor, but the design facility at East Kilbride has
now got this down to six months using the tried and tested 68000 32-bit
microprocessor as the core product.
The explosion in the demand for high performance microprocessors is
self-evident at the East Kilbride plant where, like a modern airport, it
appears that extensions are constantly being added. ''This plant is
working 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and the building work does not
stop production.''
The volume of business in all applications, he says, is exploding. As
an indication he cites the new smart cards with in-built computers which
have stimulated orders for millions of units. ''Five years ago when I
left here, an order for one million units was big, but now that size of
order is commonplace,'' he adds.
The demand for East Kilbride's products rises as every household and
office requires more high performance computer systems in the gadgets
they use. Motorola is preparing to grab the lion's share of the coming
interactive television market, where set top boxes using high
performance microprocessors will enable subscribers to receive up to 500
channels. The new generation of TVs will allow users access to catalogue
shopping and a customised news service.
Also on the horizon are multi-function PDAs (personal data assistants)
which combine a messenger system, mobile phone and computer in one
pocket-sized instrument.
Motorola's East Kilbride operation has until now concentrated mainly
on Western Europe, but this is about to change, and Dillon has recently
appointed his first Eastern European representative. ''Three years
ago,'' he explains, ''Motorola made a decision to hire Eastern European
graduates to begin developing the business in that part of the world.
One of these guys is now going back to Warsaw to be part of my team as a
bridgehead to Eastern Europe.'' Although a fledgling market, he expects
it to expand, and when it does his company will be there.
Nick Dillon could carry on talking about the challenges ahead but
there is work to be done at Motorola, and after little over an hour they
are queuing up outside our room waiting for the next meeting. After the
receptionist has checked my briefcase to ensure I am not absconding with
any of the company's secrets, Dillon waves me farewell before going back
to further develop the business.

THE Japanese have in the past copied our motorbikes, television sets
and even cars with great success, but surely they have gone too far this
time . . . copying our granite and selling it to our own Granite City!
Brian Crombie managing director of LSI UK Retail is delighted with his
order of 20 square yards of granite tiles from Privies &amp; Pantries, an
Aberdeen bathroom retailer. The tiles are imported from Japan, and are
produced by photographing a granite pattern into the tile!
Driven to make changes at Royal
CIGNA, the American based healthcare company, moved out of its offices
in Greenock recently to make way for the Royal Bank of Scotland's new
Mortgage Centre. However, naturally enough, it left behind its car park
complete with spaces next to the main entrance for disabled employees.
You would expect the new tenant to make changes, but Cigna staff who
have moved to a new home just across the road were taken aback when they
saw workmen busy in the car park moving the disabled parking spaces away
from the entrance to make room for executive parking space.
When I approached the Royal Bank in Edinburgh it was obviously unaware
of the new arrangements at the Tail of the Bank. After making a few
calls, a spokesman rang back and reluctantly admitted that the disabled
parking had been moved but insisted it was only a ''matter of six
feet''. It seems the Royal Bank's Mortgage Centre chief executive wanted
her space to be nearest the entrance.
A Cigna spokeswoman told Business Dairy that it treated all its staff
equally, and that when it occupied the building it had four spaces for
disabled employees nearest the entrance. This raised another question,
as the Royal Bank said it had only two disabled spaces and insisted this
had always been the case.
However, let's be fair to the Royal Bank, after all, as we explained
last week, it did give Bonnie Prince Charlie some gold, even if it was
under duress.
It appears the woman in charge of the mortgage centre often works late
and wanted a space near the entrance so she did not have to walk far in
a deserted car park. Fair enough. It was refreshing for the woman, who
shall be nameless at her own request, to come on to us and explain her
thinking at first hand.
Money men go
crazy for karts
KARTING appears to have got a grip on the Edinburgh financial sector,
with blue-chip names such as Ernst &amp; Young, Guardian Royal Exchange,
KPMG, McGrigor Donald, Save &amp; Prosper, Scottish Life and Standard Life,
not to mention the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank, all booked into
Karting Indoors at Gladsmuir, near Haddington, over the next few weeks.
But the pin-striped brigade will not be represented today when two
teams led by Karting Indoors track manager Fergus Laird participate in a
24-hour endurance event at Le Mans. Seventy teams from throughout Europe
will be taking part in the RacePro European Karting Series, which will
see drivers reaching speeds of up to 75mph.
Members of the two teams, one five strong, the other four, take turns
to drive during the event and are hoping to better the ninth position
the single team from Karting Indoors achieved last year.
From Stravanger
to Singapore
HARRY Baxter and Eileen Anderson of Strathclyde Business Development
would like to hear from companies interested in participating in two
trade missions.
The first is off to Stavanger in Norway where the Environment Northern
Seas conference and exhibition is being held from August 22 to 25.
Three weeks later SBD hopes to take a team of Scottish companies to
Singapore where the Environment/Watermex Asia event is being staged from
September 12 to 15. There is also a giant exhibition -- including
chemical, instrumentation and control, and international laboratory
analytical shows -- being held at the same time in Singapore and
companies will be able to take in both events.
Anyone interested should give Harry or Eileen a ring on 0141 227 3874.
Old Course goes on the map
OPEN championship golfers Colin Montgomery, Sam Torrance and Sandy
Lyle should make a beeline for the stall selling the new orthophotomap
of the Old Course when they arrive at St Andrews next week. The very
latest in digital mapping technology could prove to be a secret weapon
in their bid to win the Open.
Photomaps -- a joint venture between Survey and Developments Services,
Bo'ness, Scottish Golf and Travel Services, and Hunting Aerofilms --
launched the new mapping system earlier this week.
St Andrews Links Trust and the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club have approved
the photomap of the course and, although it is aimed at tourists, don't
be surprised if you see some professional golfers with their caddies
pouring over them. Digital mapping technology has eliminated the scale
and height errors normally connected with ariel photography, and the
photomaps give an accurate vertical image of the course.
The Old Course is the first application of the system but there are
plans to produce orthophotomaps of Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile.
Other golf courses, including Augusta and Pebble Beach in the US, are

NEWS that the N&amp;P building society is to be swallowed by Abbey
National could bring large cash bonuses and free shares for the
society's 1.3 million customers. And if the payout is anything like the
sums soon to be enriching the lives of savers with the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, N&amp;P customers should be feeling very satisfied.
A summer cash bonanza totalling #1800m will be on its way to eligible
C&amp;G savers in about three weeks -- once the dust has settled from the
Lloyds Bank takeover of the society, due to take place on August 1.
But C&amp;G savers have only two weeks to make sure they qualify for the
maximum payment possible. If you have less in your account now than you
did back in the spring of last year it's important to top it up if you
can -- payment will be based on the lower of your balances on July 31
this year or back in March or April 1994.
The bonus is is made up of a flat payment of #500 plus a percentage of
at least 13.2%. That means someone with a qualifying account of only
#100 could end up with an extra #513.20 to spend by August 10, when all
the payments are expected to have been made. At the other end of the
scale, a well-heeled investor with a qualifying investment balance of
#100,000 can look forward to a windfall of #13,700, although this is
subject to capital gains tax.
Most investors will find the money credited straight to their savings
accounts, but those with Tessas, where the payment could well exceed the
limit on yearly investment, will receive a cheque. All eligible savers
should have received details of what they stand to receive and how they
can maximise their payment, but if you have any queries you should ring
the C&amp;G freephone number 0800 716094.
Savers who unexpectedly benefit when their building society is taken
over might be tempted to try something a little racier than an ordinary
savings account with their windfall gain, but take extra care if you're
moving into an investment area you haven't looked at before.
It's not only fools and their money who are soon parted -- there are
still plenty of fraudsters around just itching to get their hands on
your cash despite the reams of regulations that supposedly protect
savers and investors. Seven years after the collapse of the Barlow
Clowes group, when nearly 20,000 investors lost a total of #191m, the
official Department of Trade and Industry report concedes that ''scope
for fraud remains'' in the investment industry.
An important first step is to check that the adviser you are dealing
with is fully authorised. Phone the Securities &amp; Investment Board
Central Registry on 0171 929 3652 to make sure.
It was the Government which agreed to pay compensation to victims of
the Barlow Clowes affair but, since then, a compensation scheme funded
by insurance companies, financial advisers and investment managers has
been set up. Last week, though, that financial lifeboat started to rock
alarmingly and it was only after the Government, in the shape of the
Treasury, threw a #17m lifeline that the waters calmed.
The future of the Investors Compensation Scheme (ICS) is being
threatened by a challenge from the insurance group Sun Life. It is
questioning whether it can be forced to pay contributions towards
compensating the clients of firms of financial advisers which had
already gone out of business before the Personal Investment Authority
was set up last summer.
Since the ICS was set up in 1988 it has paid out almost #85m to 8000
investors, with around half going to victims of investment-linked home
income plans which went disastrously wrong. But ahead lies the huge
problem of compensating those who have lost out because of bad advice on
personal pensions, where the total cost to the financial services
industry is expected to top #2700m.
It is important not to put all your eggs in one basket. The maximum
compensation is #48,000 for each authorised investment firm that goes
bust. The limits are even lower for banks and building societies. The
maxium payment is #18,000 per investor at a building society -- that is
90% of the first #20,000 of each investor's deposits. The compensation
limits for bank customers were raised to the same level on July 1.

* Last tax year I sold some shares which produced a capital gain just
under the annual exemption limit. I also became entitled to a share of
capital losses from a trust of which I was a beneficiary and this
amounted to #2000. I was under the impression I would be able to carry
these losses forward and set them against gains made in future, but the
Inspector has stated they must be set against the gains made last year
even though they were under the limit. Is this correct?
* From the details you have given it appears the Inspector is correct
in saying the losses must be offset against your personal gains in
1994/95. The general rule is that losses must in the first instance be
set against gains arising in the same tax year and only an excess amount
can be carried forward against future gains. The set off of losses
arising in the same year comes before the application of the annual
capital gains exemption.
You should, however, check with the trustees the date on which you
became entitled to the losses, since relief for the annual exemption is
given before utilising losses brought forward. The relevant date is that
on which you became absolutely entitled to the trust property but if, as
you say, this was in the same tax year as the personal gains, the
Inspector is correct.
* I remember reading in your finance columns that capital gains tax is
not payable on insurance bonds. I have received statements from an
insurance company which do not support this view, as a provision for
capital gains tax has been deducted from the value of my withdrawals.
Your comments would be appreciated.
* The answer previously given correctly stated that the profit on
surrender of a bond was not liable to capital gains tax but, if
appropriate, to income tax at the higher rate. The deduction made from
your withdrawals is not in respect of your liability but the insurance
company's potential liability to capital gains on the value of the
underlying units. As this is its liability it is not possible to utilise
your annual capital gains exemption against it.
* I have recently found out that my employer has become a plc, but
when I inquired about selling the shares I had accumulated through the
profit-sharing scheme on the stock market I was told the company would
not be floated for some years to come. Meanwhile, I can still only sell
the shares back to the company should I leave its employ, which seems to
leave the value in its hands and doesn't seem right to me. I am confused
about it being a plc and yet not being able to buy and sell its shares
on the stock market.
* Having public limited company status does not mean much as the
company can still choose when and if to float. It just gives it the
option to do so at some stage. Until this happens it is able to specify
when and to whom you can sell the shares. Putting a price on them is
bound to involve some subjectivity. It can be assessed from the
occasional external transactions that may occur in the shares. Or the
auditors can be approached to give a view, though the instruction would
probably have to come through the company.
* My wife has a house, which she owned and occupied before our
marriage, which she now wants to sell and gift the proceeds to her
daughter. The capital gain on the sale may be as much as #25,000 and
although we understand that this may be exempt, will it be so if linked
to the gift to her daughter?
* The fact that these two transactions are linked has no bearing on
the tax position in this instance. Assuming that your wife sells the
house within 36 months of it ceasing to be her main residence, the gain
arising will be exempt from capital gains tax. The gift of the proceeds
to her daughter is a separate issue and there need be no delay in
passing on the cash. In fact, the sooner the better as the gift will be
a potentially exempt transfer for inheritance tax purposes and will fall
out of account seven years after the date it is made.
* I noticed that among the exemptions allowed for the new gilts tax
are something called zero coupon Preference shares and this, in
particular, seems to have pleased the investment trust industry. This
form of investment is a new one on me. Can you tell me how it works and
what are the benefits?
* This certainly sounds one of the more exotic types of investment. It
is a form of share issued by a split level investment trust which
receives no income but is repaid at a fixed price at a set date in one
to 13 years (depending on the trust). The return is equivalent to a
fixed accumulating rate of interest and depends on the price paid (plus
commission) in relation to the price when the shares are repaid (or when
they are sold, if before redemption). It also depends on how much tax
has to be paid on the gain.
They are potentially good value for basic rate and higher rate
taxpayers if the gain continues to be taxed as capital gain rather than
income as has now been confirmed. The risk is regarded as moderate. The
investment trust might not have enough money to repay in full -- or if
they have to be sold early, and interest rates have risen since
purchase, the price may have fallen.
* I am moving to the south of England in a few months time and shall
be looking for a house to buy. I have just read a worrying report about
homes built on former contaminated land where the owners could be forced
to pay for remedial action should it be required if, for example, there
was a leak of gas from the site.
Can you tell me anything about this because I have never heard of such
a thing up here. How should I guard against this when house hunting?
* This relates to the Environment Bill which is expected to pass on to
the statute book shortly. This makes present owners liable for past
pollution problems on their land and property even if this was caused by
a previous owner.
It is only going to become an issue for housing estates built on
refuse infill sites and old industrial sites. There have been problems
with methane emissions from some of these sites which can accumulate
beneath houses.
Under the legislation the occupier will indeed be liable if the
original polluter cannot be found, though such liability could be
mitigated should the problem arise from poor installation of gas venting
equipment. In many cases the original polluter will be the local
authority or a contractor, so the homeowner will not be affected, except
possibly by remedial work undertaken.
The problems can come to light many years after the site was
developed. So if you do think of buying a house on an estate it would be
worth your while making inquiries into the previous use of the site and,
if necessary, there are specialist surveyors you can consult to help you
with this.

BRITISH farming's income boom in the wake of ''Black Wednesday'' has
only served to reinforce the industry's apathy and resistance to change,
said a leading farm commentator yesterday.
Farmers are still suffering from the illusion that their standards are
unique and ahead of the competition, delegates to the International Farm
Management Association Congress at Reading University heard.
''It is a dangerous and inaccurate assumption for UK producers and may
well represent an opportunity for those who seek to expand and develop
exports to these shores,'' warned David Richardson, a Norfolk farmer,
writer and broadcaster.
This attitude neglected to take account of a future with income
penalties for UK farmers following the recent Gatt round and of
increased competition for the British food market.
''Whether we like to admit it or not we British farmers have been
largely protected from competition from other food-producing nations for
a long while. Now, unless we get our acts together, we will lose a
significant proportion of our home markets to others.''
A complete culture change was needed and it might need a reduction in
profits to bring this about. Mr Richardson, who is chairman of the
Linking Environment and Farming Initiative, said adopting its aims could
solve many of the problems through farming profitably, responsibly and
with due care to environmental pressures.
Image was high on the agenda in yesterday's sessions, with speakers
from both sides of the Atlantic presenting their solutions. British
practitioner Denis Chamberlain pointed out that supermarkets and
processors, not farmers or growers, were getting the credit for
delivering what the consumer wanted.
Few MPs had anything more than a pressure-group grasp of farming, food
and countryside issues. This was why the impending Rural White Paper had
such crucial importance as an awareness-raising project.
''Where possible we need to find a common agenda with other rural
activists but more than that we need to go over their heads and talk
farming and countryside to those not entrenched in a point of view and
not saddled with biased opinion.''
From the US, Illinois farmer Harold Steele said Americans still had a
great respect and admiration for farmers. ''But their romantic image of
a simple hard-working farmer did not blend well with their scepticism of
technology and their cynicism about institutions created to protect
their health and safety.
''In simple terms, Americans still believed farmers were good people
but they feared we were not smart enough or sophisticated enough to use
the hi-tech tools which have now been placed in our hands to produce
their food.''

AFTER almost four years of negotiation, the British Veterinary
Association and the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department
have reached agreement on revisions of grants and payments which keep
down the costs involved in the Highlands and Islands Veterinary Services
Scheme.
This scheme, which involves more than 25 vet practices serving the
remoter areas, provides veterinary cover at reduced rates for
communities regardless of remoteness.
An announcement is expected next week from the Scottish Office.
A BVA official said: ''At last progress has been made which will
ensure that most of the practices in the HIVSS remain viable. This is
but the first step and if the scheme's long-term security is to be
assured further funding will be required.''

THE major draft from the renowned East Lothian-based Woodhall
Simmental herd of Hector MacAskill attracted keen interest in Perth
yesterday before a large ringside of buyers from all over the UK.
Many of those potential buyers were keen to acquire bloodlines dating
back to the original importation of the breed into the UK 25 years ago.
Top price was 5800gns for the very last animal sold, the April 1994
bull Woodhall Extra Special, which was first in its class at the
Highland Show and then male champion. Making the successful bid was a
former breed president, Dick Pierce, Yanley Farm, Bristol.
Top price female was the five-year-old in-calf cow Nosca Woodhall
Amazon, which sold at 3000gns to H &amp; W S Stronach, Berryleys, Banff.
Another in-calf cow, the four-year-old Woodhall Bliss, fetched 2700gns
to H Loughran, Cookstown, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The same
buyer took the six-year-old cow Woodhall Wren with her heifer calf at
2300gns.
The top price cow with calf at foot was the five-year-old Woodhall
Aileen which sold to J B Forrest, Whitemire, Duns. Maiden heifers sold
to a peak of 2400gns for the August 1994 Woodhall Empress which sold to
B Lundy, Caistor Manor, Lincoln.
Averages: 20 cows and calves averaged #1714.12, 12 in-calf cows
averaged #1372, 12 in-calf heifers averaged #1225, 11 Maiden heifers
average #1059.54, 22 heifer calves averaged #1146.25. Ten bulls averaged
#2299.50. Overall, 89 head grossed #127,869 to average #1436.73.
Auctioneers were United Auctions Limited.

WITH the demand for quality lamb stronger than ever, particularly on
the Continent, there is no reason to assume that trade for Suffolks at
the premier breed sales in Stoneleigh and Edinburgh, over the next two
weeks, will not improve on last year.
Marks &amp; Spencer has decided this autumn to promote Scotch lamb as such
in its stores on the Continent -- from Amsterdam to Seville -- so there
will be an increase in demand from that quarter.
The Suffolk cross is tailored to meet the requirments of the home and
Continental commercial marketplace with quality, early maturing lambs.
Already this year, Mr John Sinnett of Stockton Court, Worcester, has
been putting down markers, getting the Supreme Suffolk placing at the
Highland Show and the Royal Show. He will have six ram lambs for sale in
Stoneleigh, and nine in Edinburgh.
Mr Jimmy Douglas, of Cairness, Fraserburgh, who secured a new breed
record of 26,000gns in Edinburgh last year, will be hoping to keep up
the good work.
Having made the top averages at Stoneleigh and Edinburgh last year,
Kenny and Bruce Mair, of Kinnermet, Turriff, showed the reserve
champion, a ewe lamb, at last month's Highland Show. Of 62 breeders at
Stoneleigh, 17 are from North of the Border, with 10 from the
North-east.
The show and sale at Stoneleigh is on Wednesday and Thursday, July 19
and 20, with 263 ram lambs forward, and in Edinburgh on Thursday and
Friday, July 27 and 28, with 420 for sale.
* The Scots at Stoneleigh with ram lambs to be sold are: Campbell,
Kirkton, Kinnellar (11); Christie, West Carse, Stirling (3); Douglas,
Cairness, Fraserburgh (9); Fleming, Hallhill, Carluke (5); Fleming, High
Borland, Lesmahagow (4); Gilmour, Broomknowes, Maybole (3); Howie, West
Knock, Stewartfield (6); Howie, Crossford, Carluke (3); Lee,
Fordafourie, Fraserburgh (9); Mair, Kinnermet, Turriff (12); Neill,
Rossiebank, Dunning (5); Norrie, Wrae Farm, Turriff, (6); Park,
Drinkstone, Hawick (5); Sleighs, St John's Wells, Fyvie (6); Wilson,
Bogs of Baithnick, Keith (8); Wilson, Barnyards, Mintlaw, Tain (10);
Wilson, North Dorlaithers, Turriff (7).

Close shave: men have become big believers in skincare products. Ann
Donald examines the aromatic resultsel
IN the good ol' bad days -- when real men didn't eat quiche and the
average male's bathroom cabinet boasted nothing more excessive than a
bar of carbolic soap and a bottle of aspirins -- the term ''personal
grooming'' seemed more applicable to canines and horses than the male
homo sapien's daily hygiene routine. Indeed any brave soul who deviated
from the strict soap and water regime was scolded for undermining his
masculinity with the feminine indulgence of ''taking care of
appearances'' and branded a ''sissy''.
Thankfully, for the sake of both sexes, this misjudged school of
thought, where the pungently unmasked odour of natural sweat is
preferred over that of chemical deodorants, is waning. At least
according to a survey just published in Mens Health magazine.
A questionnaire based on the average British male's grooming revealed
that a surprising 62% proudly stated that they now used a fragrance on a
daily basis. Even more staggering was the admission that 65% regularly
smoothed in a dab of moisturiser -- either their own or their partners.
Clearly the British male has scaled the dizzy heights of personal
grooming at a frenetic pace and embraced the revolutionary phenomenon
that is male toiletries and fragrances.
Back in the seventies, however, the only toiletries available seemed
to be Brut 33 with pug-nosed boxer Henry Cooper urging adolescents to
''Splash it all over'' or Old Spice -- a surefire favourite with dads,
uncles and grandads to this day.
For a nineties generation these products appear to be embarrassing
relics from a by-gone era used exclusively and excessively by Medallion
Men anxious to woo the ladies. In the past five years an array of skin
products has swamped the market. One cannot flick through a male
lifestyle magazine without the latest designer fragrance assailing the
nostrils.
Indeed every respectable fashion house has established a male
fragrance. From Giorgio Armani's Eau Pour Homme -- ''a cool combination
of bergamot, mandarin and daffodil'' -- to the ''herby, woody, musky
tones'' of Romeo Gigli. Not content with this, each designer scent has
spawned its own inimitable family of by-products.
Emolliants, scrubs, pre and post-shaving gels, balms, lotions and
moisturisers are now part and parcel of a shaving process that no longer
merely snips those bristles off but decongests, hydrates, regenerates,
stimulates and tightens the stupefied male skin.
It is no wonder that Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore was recently
moved to observe that: ''We wanted sensitive men but we got men with
sensitive skin.'' The symbiotic relationship between advertising and
social trends meant that the rise of the emotionally sensitive New Man,
who apparently embodied the caring sharing nineties, was also a ripe
target for the toiletry manufacturers.
The thinking obviously being that a nineties guy was sensitive on the
outside and inside. Though the Sensitive New Man was soon exposed as
being a flash-in-the-pan media invention who gave way to the New Lad, it
transpired that Man and Lad were bound together by the rather more
durable desire to look, smell, and feel good about themselves and never
mind the sexual politics.
Sara Cramer is the Style and Grooming editor with Men's Health
magazine, which aims to cater for the emotionally and skin sensitive
male printing articles on everything from stress to facials. Cramer
believes the change in society's attitude which now permits men to care
about their appearance without being misconstrued as vain or effeminate,
can be traced back to the mid-eighties when the idea of body
consciousness was first mooted in the public mind.
''Ten years ago I think it was still slightly abnormal if men went to
the gym but now nearly everybody goes. Referring to the survey results
she said: In the same way, 10 years ago I don't think such a high
percentage of men would have admitted to using moisturiser or hairspray
-- even though they probably pinched their girlfriends' or wives' at
times. Nowadays, it's acceptable. It's no longer perceived as akin to
crossdressing if a man uses face products because they're available in
every High Street store.''
Hazel McIntosh's experience as manager with The Body Shop in Glasgow
bears this out. Since the company launched its Mostly Men range in 1987,
McIntosh has observed ''a massive influx of male customers''. With the
bold black and white packaging, the scrubs, washes and face protectors
are easy to spot which is all part of the philosophy to lure in males.
''At first, when we launched the range we put it near the door as men
didn't like to walk to the bottom of the shop. But over the years that's
all changed and now men of all ages pop in during their lunch hour
because they feel quite confident buying their shaving cream here,''
McIntosh said.
Despite these optimistic signs, there is obviously still a stronghold
of soap and toiletry dodgers holding out on the personal grooming
revolution, as two recent slogans testified. The 1995 Lynx system felt
the need to assure consumers with ''Easy skincare without losing face
with your mates'' while the Armani face moisturiser underlined ''the
unquestioned masculinity'' of its product.
It seems that despite the hype, old traditions die hard for some.
Finding a soft spot for a new image

like to smell good. Though if I'm going out I'll wear something because
I know certain people like it. But it's also nice and soothing to use
the balm after you've shaved and it helps with moisturising.
''There's no way it's considered feminine to wear this nowadays. I
know that all my friends buy skin products. I still think its 50/50
regards men wearing aftershave or whatever. Some use it to keep their
face in good shape and others are just posers.''
* DAVID SINGH (31) Processing Engineer.
''I buy all my stuff from The Body Shop: deodorant, gel, shaving
cream, and face protector. It's definitely acceptable now. I remember
when I was a wee boy on holiday and my mum was dead impressed by this
guy who not only used deodorant but a hairdryer as well. I've even
noticed that a lot of the younger guys at clubs are wearing expensive
aftershaves, which nobody did a few years ago.
''I think it all comes down to self-confidence and wanting to look
good. Also if you're going out you don't want to stink like nobody's
business if you're sitting down chatting away to somebody.''
* JAMES McDONALD (27) Parole Officer.
''I use seaweed facial scrub, Gillette gel, Boots anti-burn cream, and
Carolina Herrera aftershave balm if I'm going somewhere special. I use
them all to get a smoother shave and moisturise my skin. And I wear the
aftershave because I think it smells sexy --my wife Tracy, wears it too.
''It's definitely a generation thing. There are a lot of guys my age
spending heavily on these products, and there is a far better range now
than when I was even a teenager and buying everything from The Body
Shop.''

IF you feel you have been maltreated or misled by a financial
institution, there may be an ombudsman who can help you. Over the past
15 years a variety have been appointed to deal with banking, building
society, insurance, pension and other financial matters.
Your complaint will be considered free of charge and, if he finds in
your favour, you could be awarded substantial compensation. While the
ombudsman does not always uphold complaints, the system appears to be
working relatively well. It has enabled consumers who would not
otherwise have been able to afford legal action to seek redress.
The annual reports of the ombudsmen always make interesting reading,
giving examples of the cases received and how they have been decided.
Recently three have reported in rapid succession.
* The Pensions Ombudsman, Julian Farrand, deals with disputes and
complaints about maladministration by trustees and managers of company
pension schemes. Eligible complainants include members of pension
schemes or their widows, widowers or dependants. He reported an increase
of nearly 24% in the number of cases investigated over the past year.
His decisions favoured the complainant in 78% of completed cases, and he
made awards totalling nearly #1m.
Many of the complaints referred to in this year's report relate to
errors in calculations of benefits, confusion and delay caused by scheme
wind-ups and cases of employers and trustees failing to distinguish
their roles and interests -- most commonly in small schemes. About one
sixth of the cases investigated were directed against insurance
companies.
One of the most intractable problem areas concerned The Crown Life
pension schemes which are now managed by Century Life. A combination of
poor record keeping by Crown and the wind-up of many of the schemes has
led to long delays. ''Many thousands of members still wait for their
benefits to be paid or even calculated,'' Farrand comments. Indeed, so
great is the scale of this problem, with some 5500 pension schemes and
around 100,000 members affected, it is surprising the MPs of those
concerned have not called on the Government to step in.
If you would like to make a complaint about your pension, you should
go to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS) first. If OPAS
cannot resolve the situation, you can take the matter to the ombudsman.
They share the same address: 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB.
* The Building Societies Ombudsman will consider most complaints about
unfair treatment or maladministration by building societies. Last year
Brian Murphy saw a rise of 15% in the number received. Complainants were
wholly or partly successful in 51% of decisions made.
Mortgage related disputes accounted for two thirds of the workload,
compared with only a third two years ago when investment related cases
predominated. The ombudsman noted that the fall in investment cases was
partly due to the welcome improvements in the way societies were dealing
with obsolete accounts.
Among mortgage problems, his report refers to the relatively large
number of complaints that have arisen from misunderstandings over
mortgage protection insurance and mortgage indemnity guarantee policies.
It points out that it is essential the exclusions as well as the
benefits of these policies should be highlighted.
He has also been concerned by the large number of complaints received
from borrowers who applied for endowment mortgages but, due to an
oversight, the policies were never set up, effectively leaving them with
interest-only mortgages and nothing in place to repay the capital at the
end of the term.
Before complaining to the ombudsman, you must exhaust your building
society's internal complaints procedure. But if you find it is dragging
its feet -- a complaint should be dealt with in no more than six weeks
-- you can go to the ombudsman. His address is 35-37 Grosvenor Gardens,
London SW1X 7AW.
* The Personal Investment Authority Ombudsman was created a year ago
to deal with complaints about investments, including insurance
investment, and personal pension policies. The number of cases dealt
with so far by Stephen Edell has been relatively modest, though he
reports that towards the end of the period the workload was building up.
Many of the initial enquirers had not got to the stage when their
complaints had reached deadlock with the firm concerned. Nevertheless,
within the short time he has been in office he notes: ''A recurring
feature is the sale of long-term investment plans or whole of life
policies to teenagers or other young people. Many such sales will be
inappropriate.'' Looking forward, he anticipates there will be much more
work relating to disputes over pension transfers and opt-out advice in
the year ahead.
For details of how to complain to him, contact the PIA Consumer Help
Desk, 1 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 5AZ.

Stephen McGinty previews a festival using hard work, not sofa-beds, to
produce potential sit-com themes and giggles
YOU don't need a sofa for a sit-com. It just feels that way. But on
the opening night of the Channel 4 Sit-com Festival there are two sofas
on the stage of the Riverside Studios. If the strict rules governing
half-hour comedy extended to funny furnishings then David Fine's Friends
For Dinner with its lovely two-sofa set, would be much funnier than
Simon Block's Flicks. You see, Flicks has no sofa. Is Block mad, or
merely alternative?
Neither really, he's just funny and has found a formula. Flicks takes
place in a old cinema which the new commercially-minded manager plans to
convert from an old art-house to a new multiplex. With only one screen,
what he lacks in multi he aims to recoup in plex. ''Equity, prudence,
approachability, ruthless despotism, and absolutely no refunds are my
managerial watchwords,'' says Robert Bathurst's Mr Eastwood.
Except for the sofa, Block follows the rules. Sit-coms have to be
about 27 minutes long. ITV and Channel 4 require a mini-climax after 14
minutes for ad breaks, so BBC has an extra few minutes to play with. The
theme must fit into the first half-page, followed by three gags per
page. The no-nos includes more than six characters, three sets, and
moving from home/workplace or pub.
''As a writing exercise it's a monster,'' says Lynn Ferguson, who
appears in four of the festival's nine plays. ''Sit-com is the most
technical form of comedy, which is why people get it wrong so often.''
The aim of the festival, on a budget less than that of one full pilot
show, is to prevent more failures. Channel 4's commissioning editor for
comedy, Seamus Cassidy, has ploughed #200,000 into the development of
the nine plays with Riverside's director William Burdett-Coutts.
Of the nine he'll continue to develop three or four towards the
television screen. If just one can repeat Drop The Dead Donkey's
innovative success he'll be delighted. ''I wanted to give writers the
chance to hear an audience laugh before the pressures of the studio is
upon them,'' says Cassidy about the festival, which attracted 350
applicants.
''I wanted to find something that would encourage new writing. There
are workshops but not a lot comes from that and the next thing is
writing sit-coms and pilots. There is nothing in between.''
Tim Firth, who wrote Once Upon A Time In The North and Preston Front,
has strong feelings about pilots, half-hour one-offs which are used to
develop an idea. ''A pilot tells you as much about a sit-com as the
lopped-off head of a chicken will tell you about the quality of the
meat. The only thing you will be able to establish is whether or not at
this stage you are dealing with a turkey.''
Although David Fine's Friends For Dinner didn't gobble-gobble, it did
appear rather close to cooked. Fine won an Oscar for his animation Bob's
Birthday but his dinner-party play about political correctness and guilt
failed to raise more than a smile. That, apparently, was the author's
objective. ''It's not farcical and it's not going for big laughs, it's
more about what people can relate to.''
Helen and Michael -- who brood about buying Colombian coffee -- are
invited to Moira and Jim's, for what they believe will be dinner. But
their hosts have literally prepared peanuts and cheap wine to ease their
consciences after many dinner invites. Now while Flicks is like The
Brittas Empire, Friends For Dinner is a more cutting Terry and June.
Urbanski and the Brown Burglar by Tim Binding, features a former
publisher turned novelist and also has two sofas. But the quality of the
furniture is grubby and poor and reflects the script. There are, however
a few laughs and a crossword. ''What do you make 14 across? Derranged
person found in a lunatic asylum, six letters beginning with M? How
about Mother?''
William Burdett-Coutts collected a group of 12 actors to appear in the
nine plays. Each actor is in three or four productions. Lynn Ferguson is
in four. ''In sit-com the actors are usually quite close to what the
characters are like.'' So Lynn is a ''woman with baby and mobile home'',
''best friend: ditch all men and let's have a kebab'', a ''blonde-permed
air-head'' and ''gangster's wife''.
Her favourite line comes from the teen-angst pen of 16-year-old Susan
Nickson, whose play Back Door Women, centres around boyfriend troubles
of two friends working at a family-planning clinic. Lynn plays Ange who
suggests that if her friend truly wishes to die because of her
boyfriend, she should use the contents of her bathroom cabinet.
''If it's razor blades forget it . . . all I've got are a couple of
sanitary towels with the high-weave top sheet.''
''Well, you could swallow a few of those and dehydrate yourself.''
It will take years to develop what previews at the Riverside over the
next three weeks into a series of six programmes.
Successes such as Absolutely Fabulous and Men Behaving Badly have
impressed huge numbers of viewers in recent years but Dad's Army and
Fawlty Towers remain the comic grail.
It is still the ultimate ambition of writers and producers at the
Sit-com Festival, to join Basil Fawlty and Sergeant Mainwaring on the
most comfortable cushions of the great sit-com sofa.
* The Sitcom Festival runs until July 30 at the Riverside Studios,
Crisp Road, London.

REGULATOR Professor Stephen Littlechild is never far away when it
comes to looking at the UK's privatised electricity industry.
Yesterday, in response to US company Southern Electric's hostile
#1000m bid for South Western Electricity, he said that if the takeover
went ahead then ''additional measures would be necessary in order to
provide continued protection to customers and to maintain regulatory
effectiveness''.
Professor Littlechild noted that if the takeover is successful then,
for the first time, a public electricity supply licence would be held by
a subsidiary company rather than by a parent company.
Offer's suggestions for possible added conditions for issuing the
licence in such circumstances include the requirement that is such a
licensee wanted to carry out any new business unconnected with the
supply and distribution of electricity it would have to do so through a
separate subsidiary company.
Other proposals include restricting the license holder's ability to
give guarantees to other businesses, limit its transfer of assets and
require it to hold securities so that it keeps control over them. A
further area of potential concern is Offer's ability to obtain
information from the licensee. To deal with this, it proposes that the
licensee should get from its parent company an undertaking to supply
information which the electricity watchdog may require.
On Thursday, Southern Electric International, a wholly owned
subsidiary of The Southern Company, published its formal offer for SWEB.
The offer is #38 in cash and #52 in bonds for every 10 SWEB shares, with
a full cash alternative of #9 per SWEB share. SBC Warburg is acting for
Southern UK, a specially created acquisition vehicle for SWEB.
The Southern Group is the holding company of five regional electric
utilities engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity and supplies energy to customers in some of the south
eastern states of America such as Alabama and Georgia.
Southern Electric International (SEI) was founded in 1981 to take
advantage of the expertise and resources developed through the Southern
Group's related activities. SEI's main focus these days is on
international and domestic cogeneration, the independent US domestic
power market, and international electricity businesses. It is
particularly keen in the privatisations that have taken place in the
electricity industry across the world.
Thomas Boren, president and chief executive of SEI, said the company
could ''work well'' within the UK's regulatory environment. The US
electricity industry is largely self-regulating and what regulation
there is is based on rate of return. In contrast, the UK electricity
industry works under price cap regulation based on the RPI-X formula.
Offer, the office of electricity regulation, has called for comments
from the industry on the proposed takeover by July 21. Comments on
proposed licence modifications are invited by August 11.
Meanwhile, SWEB shares dropped 3p to 935p, still ahead of the
#9.00-a-share offer from Southern Electric. The City thinks that a more
realistic offer would be #9.50 a share.
SWEB's chairman Maurice Warren has urged shareholders to reject the
offer describing it as ''naive'' and ''inadequate''. A special
resolution removing the 15% limitation on any single SWEB shareholding
is to be put to shareholders at the company's AGM on July 25. SEI
currently has 11.2% of SWEB's share capital following a dawn raid on
Monday.

The Stock Exchange is often likened to a casino. One way to improve
the odds, suggests Ken Clay, may be to take a gamble on options or
warrants
INTELLECTUALS on the left side of politics used to complain that the
stock exchange was a casino. Now they are even busier criticising the
high salaries, options and protective contracts floating around in some
boardrooms, and the original complaint is gathering a bit of dust.
Looking at it objectively, there was only ever a grain of truth in the
casino allegation. Admittedly, a lot of money could be made when the
ball dropped into the slot marked ''takeover bid'', but for the most
part the rewards come to those who have thought things through carefully
and backed the right companies.
There are, however, a number of ways of gearing up the gamble and
increasing both the risks and the rewards. One is to buy options. As
these always cost less than the shares themselves, you can put yourself
in command of a lot more than you would be able to buy outright for the
same money. Another is to buy warrants. With both of these you can make
a lot of money -- or you can lose the lot.
A warrant is in some ways similar to an option. It too gives you the
right to buy shares of the underlying company at a fixed price, but it
does not compel you to do so. Few UK industrial companies have issued
them but there are a lot in the investment trust sector.
They are regarded by the marketing departments of the fund management
groups as essential for getting a new issue off the ground. The logic is
simple -- if establishing a new trust involves expenses which work out
at 5p a share, investors would be unlikely to buy it because they would
know the shares they paid 100p each for would have asset backing of only
95p unless there was something else to give extra value.
That is usually a warrant, given free normally at the rate of one for
every five shares bought at flotation and conveying the right to buy new
shares, generally at the issue price of 100p, at any time during the
life of the company, which is more often than not limited to 10 years.
It costs the company nothing.
Valuing a warrant is a complicated business, but if you believe that
shares go up in the long run it is obvious the right to buy at 100p in
10 years must have a time value. This is the case even where the trust's
shares have fallen since the issue. This is because there is still
plenty of time for the market prices of the trusts themselves to rise
well beyond the price the warrant holder has to subscribe to buy the
shares. The beauty of a warrant as opposed to an option is that
depending on the point in its life at which you bought it, it usually
has much longer to run.
Critics complain that warrants, once they are issued along with shares
in a new trust or as sweetners to an industrial company's loan stock and
so on, give no benefit to the company. They are not part of the capital
-- nothing can be brought with the cash they represent until the
subscription right is exercised -- and when they are exercised they will
have the effect of diluting the asset value of the existing capital. For
an industrial company, however, they can be seen as something of a
deferred rights issue which will, assuming the share price has behaved
well enough for them to be exercised, bring in cash for later use.
For an investment trust, however, they are unlikely to be exercised in
any great numbers until near the end of its life. So unless there is
provision for the shareholders to vote to continue the trust, they are
likely to bring little benefit, just a certain dilution.
Unless the taxation system changes, warrants are an attractive way of
making tax-free capital gains. Holders of those which have risen in
value can sell sufficient to get the whole annual gain ration.
Warrants almost invariably stand at a premium -- that is their price
plus the subscription price adds up to more than the Ordinary share
price -- so they are very sensitive to changes in the price of the
underlying trust and can move two or three times as much as the share.
They are, in fact, among the most volatile counters in the market. If
you bought at the beginning of last year, you probably ended up losing a
quarter of your money. But in the previous year you had probably seen it
double.
As they pay no dividends, they appeal to the investor most interested
in capital gains. But they also have attractions for anyone wanting to
make a gift to a young child. A relatively small outlay on warrants with
a good number of years to run could turn into rather a nice nest egg.
They do need to be watched, however. When they come to the end of their
life warrants become worthless. The child's parents need to be aware of
this and sell before they expire.
As the final date gets nearer, the premium will be more and more
closely related to the underlying share and in the final months the
warrant is likely to be priced at roughly the share price minus the
subscription price. If you fancy a dabble in warrants, remember that the
most important thing of all is going to be the performance of the
underlying share. Once you are satisfied with the prospects there, look
at the premium and how many years are left. Ask your broker to find out
the fulcrum figure. This is a calculation of the rate at which the
underlying shares need to grow each year before the warrant is a better
investment than the shares themselves. If you don't believe it can grow
that fast, look for another warrant.

<HEADLINE>British motor car industry's renaissance continues. Government aid provides new lease of life for Jaguar</HEADLINE>

FORD has always made it perfectly clear that unless substantial state
aid was forthcoming from the British Government the new Jaguar X200
would be manufactured at a Ford plant elsewhere, probably in the US at
Wixom, near Detroit. This would have made it the first Jaguar to be
built outside Britain.
However, aside from any sentimentality about Britain's renowned luxury
cars, now virtually all foreign owned, including, of course,
Rolls-Royce, there was never any question of the Government allowing
this to happen with all that would imply for the UK motor industry.
Yesterday's #80m state package was in fact virtually in place back in
March and possibly the only doubts about the full project which now
remain is whether or not it will be passed by the European Commission.
The Commission has to approve all significant state support to the
motor industry in the European Union. The EU Competition Commissioner,
Karel Van Miert, said yesterday that they were looking at the case.
However, Jaguar will be receiving money from a Government programmme
aimed at regions with particularly high levels of unemployment and areas
of economic disadvantage and this must be a relevant factor in assessing
the case.
In the meantime, the Government has not surprisingly made a virtue out
of necessity. State aid comprises #48m direct grant from the Department
of Trade and Industry with the rest made up of regional selective
assistance, local authority aid and property development assistance.
Altogether, the investment comes to around #400m and Ford's expansion
is expected to create 1300 direct jobs and 5000 to 6000 jobs in total,
including those of component suppliers. It is also expected to ensure
Jaguar's long-term future in the UK. Without it, in the words of one
analyst, Jaguar would probably have withered away in about 10 years
time.
Until recently, Ford's experience with Jaguar since it paid #1560m for
the company in late 1989 has not been a very happy one. Hit by the
recession and increasing competition, not least in the US which is its
main market, Jaguar has been in the red for six years and to date has
lost #770m.
Last September, though, it introduced a revised version of its XJ
saloon series which was well received and aided by economic recovery in
principal markets, sales have climbed. Jaguar in fact moved into profit
in the final quarter of last year for the first time under Ford's
ownership.
The outlook is certainly much brighter now and this year should see a
profit. And the proposed investment in the new X200 range, which is
expected to come into production in 1999, was greeted with enthusiasm by
sector analysts.
They believe that Jaguar will present a real threat to specialist
German car-makers BMW and Mercedes and could even take on mass producers
worldwide. Just competing in the class dominated by the German
manufacturers could make a serious dent. At the very least, the Germans
are likely to have to hike up their sales and marketing investment and
give more incentives such as making current optional extras standard
features of their cars at the basic price.
It is estimated that early X200 production should be about
50,000-60,000 and this in a very small market, where BMW produced
137,000 5-series cars and Mercedes built 165,000 C-class cars last year.
Analysts say that Jaguar's investment of #400m puts it on a par with
the kind of investment made by the Japanese car manufacturers in the UK,
and the spin-offs for the industry as a whole are clearly very
promising. There is, however, some sceptism about projection for the
creation of another 5000 indirect jobs in the parts and components
sector though the expansion is likely to be significant.
Overall, it is regarded as another pointer to the dramatic renaissance
of the British motor car industry, albeit under foreign ownership, which
is the growth centre of Europe.

I FIRST visited Hillend Reservoir in my teens. I was with Mike Shepley
and we had been assured that the pike there were in their teens too . .
. teens of pounds. We fished big pike bungs with highly pungent dead
herring and mackerel as baits and came away fishless, but with a dream
that we'd go back another day and catch one of those pike. Our dream
never came true.
But it has done for another group of anglers with a different dream.
Having been under the control of various authorities during the years,
the reservoir, now called Hillend Loch is in the safe, forward-looking
and innovative hands of the Airdrie and District Angling Club.
I say innovative because, when many fisheries, new and old, are
stocking rainbow trout to lure anglers to their waters, the wise
committee of the Airdrie Club have decided that their fishery will be
stocked with brown trout and brown trout only. Though they are more
difficult and expensive to rear, they believe there is still a
sufficient number of anglers who want to catch our indigenous and
much-loved brownie to make the fishery a success.
In the four years since the Airdrie Club has been in charge, every
penny taken from permits has been ploughed back into the fishery. At the
end of each season, 10,000 trout around six to eight inches have been
stocked and, nice to see for an old traditionalist like me, during the
legal brown trout season of March 15 to October 6, they stock fish in a
variety of sizes at the rate of around 1000 a month, and as a bonus,
around 2000 fish were introduced at the start of the season. Several
burns enter the loch and they provide good spawning grounds.
The fish don't go hungry, and the great joy is that, Hillend being a
shallow loch over most of its 365 acres, you can catch fish almost
anywhere and nearly always on a floating line. The club chairman, Robert
Potter, had written to tell me of the fantastic hatches of great red
sedges in early summer and how these evenings can provide remarkable
sport.
My visit was at the end of the late June hot spell and, would you
believe it, we had cloud cover and an east wind, occasionally veering to
the north. I was fishing with head bailiff John McGlynn who knows the
water well. The stiff breeze gave us pros and cons. In our favour was a
decent wave and succulent wind lanes to cover, and against . . . well,
there is the old phrase that says: ''When the wind's in the east, the
fishing's the least.''
But we still caught fish. Silvery trout with tiny red spots and golden
trout with black-spotted flanks and a hint of green on the gill-cover.
And we rose other fish too. John lost a belter and I had several
spectacular takes as fish cartwheeled over the fly. The trout were not
easy to hook and quite a few times I was left wondering what I had to do
to make permanent contact. The flies are fairly traditional, though
muddlering them is popular and as the flies left a wake through the
wave, the trout came at them hard . . . all very exciting.
Both John and Robert were at pains to point out that the fishery was
there to provide sport for all. You can spin and fish any legal bait
from the bank which is a great way to get younger anglers a fish or two.
And at only #3 for a visitor's day ticket, allowing four fish at 12
inches or more, you'll find no better value. If you want to boat-fish,
you'll need to go out with a member, but they'll be more than happy to
accommodate you.
This is a superb fishery . . . high quality, free rising brown trout
at reasonable cost on an attractive water. What more can you ask for?

from, among others, Cafaro Bros in Glasgow, P D Tackle in Cumbernauld,
Grant's of Airdrie, and Armadale Sports.

FIRSTBUS, formed by the recent merger of Aberdeen-based GRT and
Weston-super-Mare-based Badgerline, plans to buy the 20% stake in a
South Yorkshire bus company which rival Stagecoach was ordered by the
Government to sell.
The company, like Stagecoach before it, hopes ultimately to buy the
remaining 80% of Mainline Partnership.
It is confident it will not experience the same regulatory problems as
Stagecoach, although this view is not shared by everyone.
Perhaps reflecting the cheekiness of FirstBus's move, announced
yesterday, chief executive Moir Lockhead said: ''It is unfortunate for
Stagecoach that the Office of Fair Trading ruled against them. I think
we are quite delighted we have managed to get in there.''
FirstBus does not expect its #2m shares-plus-cash purchase of 20% of
Mainline to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in
spite of Badgerline's #38m purchase in the spring of last year of Rider
Holdings, the main operator in West Yorkshire.
Mr Lockhead said FirstBus was satisfied there was no contiguity
problem between Mainline and Rider.
He added that his company had already had discussions with the Office
of Fair Trading which ''have led us to believe there won't be any
difficulty''.
But Bill McCall, a director of stockbroker Tilney, believes the bus
industry is a ''political hot potato''.
He said: ''We could realistically expect that any large bus group in
the UK that is entering into any large arrangement will be looked at
very closely.''
However, FirstBus, which is second in size only to Stagecoach,
believes it will have the regulatory all-clear by the time the deal is
completed in early September.
It is proposed that Mainline will repurchase the 20% holding which
Stagecoach was ordered to divest in March.
FirstBus will then buy 20% of the enlarged equity for one million of
its Ordinary shares, which were unchanged yesterday at 147p, paying the
balance of the #2m in cash. It will also subscribe for #3.5m of
redeemable loan stock in Mainline.
Meanwhile, Stagecoach, which was ordered to sell its 20% stake in
Glasgow-based Strathclyde Buses the month after the Mainline ruling, is
seeking a judicial review of the South Yorkshire decision.
Having been granted leave to appeal last month, Stagecoach will
question the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's jurisdiction in cases
where a company has taken a 20% stake in another in which employees own
the majority of the shares, such as Mainline. The case will be heard in
the High Court in London later this year.
Derek Scott, finance director of Stagecoach, stressed that it was a
''test case'' challenging the conduct of the MMC investigation and was
not affected by yesterday's announcement by FirstBus.
Stagecoach, which originally paid about #1m for its stake in Mainline,
will not make a loss on its sale.
Although perhaps seen as rivals, there have been suggestions that the
big bus operators co-operate with each other, to an extent, because
there is plenty of room in the UK market.
Mr Lockhead, however, denied any collaboration with Stagecoach in
FirstBus's purchase of the Mainline stake.

DOUGLAS THOMPSON looks at what's happening in the world of movies and
television
* THIS weekend is make or break week for Kevin Costner with the
unveiling of Waterworld which is the most expensive film ever made. Last
night the adventure movie about ecological disaster and piracy, with
clean-cut Costner wearing webbed feet and apparently using that
whingeing Robin Hood voice, was being screened for the world's press.
Universal Studios is banking on the film being as exciting as its
budget (from $75m to $250m depending to which gossip you listen to) and
Costner, who has been given a rough ride over the film's roller-coasting
production and marketing costs, will defend himself next week.
But despite doomwatchers, the film has the added attractions of Dennis
Hopper as chief bad guy and Jeanne Tripplehorn as bountiful cleavage --
this is not sexist but job description -- and has all the possibilities
of a John Major. Against the odds it will run and run.
* ROSEANNE Barr just keeps on going. She's never been afraid to offer
her point of view and in next week's edition of The New Yorker, which
has become America's must magazine, she has a blast.
She has a go at three liberal superstars -- Jodie Foster, Meryl
Streep, and Susan Sarandon, saying they have little connection to the
working-class women the feminist movement needs to target. ''They're
just too middle-class white. They're just all upset about salaries or
something that feminism was about 25 years ago. They're rewarded for
making a woman's movement to be lost in time. And they don't even know
it. They're talented but deluded -- they are in effect castrated
females.''
Let's wait for the even better story -- the following cat fight. Or
possibly the movie.
* ROSEANNE'S TV mate John Goodman is making the most of his break from
the television series Roseanne and is cast -- banish you typecast
tyrants -- as Falstaff in the Old Globe theatre production of Henry IV
in San Diego. The theatre, one of America's great classic platforms, has
never had so many pre-booked seats and the moneymen are today hoping to
extend the performances. Goodman's popularity has also enhanced plans
for a cable TV production.
And you must look out for Dick Van Dyke in Diagnosis Murder in which
he plays crime solver Dr Mark Sloan. The long-time TV star has become as
popular as Angela Lansbury's Jessica Fletcher in Murder She Wrote, and
there are plans to link the two elderly amateur detectives in a special
Christmas television film.
* KATHLEEN Quinlan is something of a sideshow in the macho space drama
Apollo 13 -- she plays the wife of astronaut Jim Lovell -- but so few
are the leading female roles this or any other year, that she is being
touted for a Best Actress Oscar. Tom Hanks would make it a hat-trick if
he was nominated after Philadelphia and Forest Gump for Best Actor.
* WINONA Ryder, one of America's best young actresses, who helped
justify Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, is delving into the darkness
again. She will star in The Crucible in a screen adaptation of Arthur
Miller's landmark play. Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox is producing
the film about the Salem witch trials which will also star Paul
Schofield and Daniel Day-Lewis and starts filming in six weeks.
Maya Angelou, Anne Bancroft, Ellen Burstyn, Kate Nelligan, Kate
Capshaw, and Ryder finished filming the Aids-aimed education movie How
to Make an American Quilt this week.
* GIRL play: Kathy Bates -- the Oscar winner from Misery -- is the big
star of a remake of the classic thriller Diabolique. She plays a cop in
pursuit of women   who have teamed up to lose the man in their lives.
Wife Sharon Stone and mistress Isabelle Adjani are the femmes fatale.
Literally in this case.
* PULPING the profits: Pulp Fiction has become the highest grossing
independent movie ever; a TV biography is being written on the recently
late Lana Turner. Glenn Close, who this month gave up her role as Norma
Desmond in the Broadway production of Sunset Boulevard, is being sought
by Michael Douglas who co-starred with her in Fatal Attraction for what
his people call another ''erotic thriller''.
And Joan Collins is considering shoulder-pads again. It's profitable.
She would star in a remake of the 1960s American situation comedy My
Three Sons. The late Fred MacMurray had the original role.
Times change.

ANVAR KHAN considers the source of personal expression and healing
properties of earrings worn by both sexes
IT MAKES sense that earrings are worn by pop stars and famous
sportsmen. Both professions want to be seen to be flash. But you
wouldn't expect to see a golfer wearing an earring, just a footballer.
Because some men still believe that an earring on a man is an indicator
of weakness, of sentimentality, and some men don't want to be seen as
fey. No, that's for musicians.
Sovereign knuckledusters and chunky cufflinks, however, are dated.
It's better to wear an earring than a gold, ropey chain. Boys as young
as 12 have their ears pierced and feel perfectly confident that they
won't be harrassed with suggestions of homosexuality.
On the streets, an earring is fashionable. And there is a generation
of twenty-somethings who pride themselves on their open-mindedness to
wear them. It is that generation, who, this week, threatened to strike
if their employers, British Rail, banned their wee studs.
Yes, the new accessory for a man who is in touch with his feelings is
the solitary hoop or diamante droplet. Earrings are no longer the
insignia of Mexican bandits, pirates, druggies or those with a criminal
record. Successful men with pierced ears include Andre Agassi, George
Michael, Charlie Nicholas and Elton John -- men who cannot be accused of
having a poor mental attitude. Reactionaries merely publicise their dumb
prejudice. British Rail has illustrated how out of touch it is with the
public.
''Earrings are two bits of metal. It doesn't matter whether you wear
them or not, it doesn't affect your ability to do your job,'' says
Steven Kelly, 23, a hair stylist.
''Earrings are totally unisex, they are part of personal expression. I
do old ladies' hair and they don't look at me uneasily. It's also a
tribal thing. If you've travelled and experienced other cultures you
tend to take bits of them with you. For a lot of people, wearing
earrings is more spiritual. They wear wooden ones or crystals which they
believe will make them better people.''
He adds: ''I've got an amethyst I wear from time to time which was
given to me by a good friend. I'm not as spiritual as other people I've
met over the years. But those with an alternative lifestyles wear
earrings with turquoise or opals for their healing properties.
''If you walk around Glasgow, seven out of 10 men you meet will be
wearing jewellery. I do know that it is completely sexist, and out of
order in the nineties to ban earrings. British Rail should grow up and
concern themselves with the way they run their business instead''.

Each week Anvar Khan dips into the Beauty Box to try a new treatment
or product. This week it's the clay bandages that are breaking the
cosmetic mould
THE Universal Contour Wrap is a Disney procedure, larger-than-life
with a miraculous ending. I volunteered to try one at the City Beach
salon in Glasgow's Royal Exchange Square.
It was a sunny day and I was feeling sticky, puffy, and fat. In fact,
sometimes I feel that way regardless of the climate. I had no
expectations at all when I entered the salon. It is not wise to believe
in the cosmetic overhaul, it is the triumph of hope over experience.
I was taken in hand by manageress Frances Whittle and her helpful
assistant Lorraine. I had to fill out a form and declare my physical
health. The Universal Contour Wrap sounds like a beauty treatment dreamt
up by a movie mogul, the way Jayne Mansfield's bra was by Howard Hughes.
But it is a long series of bandages which, having been soaked in warm
clay and applied to the body, have enough magic properties to reduce the
size of the customer by at least six inches, that's horizontally not
vertically.
As it was I lost 14 inches all over. Yes, it is true, but please,
don't write in with your congratulations. As a reporter I can only relay
the facts. The clay acts as a poultice, drawing out toxins and
compressing lumpy fat, so the final effect is that of smoothness and
slimness. Cellulite is lessened too.
During my present term as fashion/beauty person, I have learned a lot
of things I don't really want to know, about banes such as cellulite.
The condition, first spotted, examined and logged by the French, is
caused by the fatty layers of the body absorbing poisons such as
caffeine, cholesterol, and the contraceptive pill. Hormonal changes such
as the menopause or pregnancy also contribute. The skin is a sponge, and
using bandages in the Egyptian style, you can squeeze it into
submission.
The clay, which is left on the body for two hours, extracts all the
crap. The skin and fatty deposits relax and the width of the thigh, the
hip, and the upper arm is immediately cut. Of course, cynics will
presume that given a glass of water, the bulk will return. Not so. You
lose no weight, just inches. The body bandage and clay act as a
poultice, not as a dehydrator.
If you wanted to puff up again, you'd have to drink alcohol, eat curry
and chocolate for a whole week. (If this is, actually, what you eat,
you'd have to eat twice as much.) And after two weeks I still haven't
put on what I lost.
* For appointments and information about special offers call Frances
Whittle, City Beach, at 29 Royal Exchange Square, 0141 248 8282. Price
#50 for a single wrap. A loss of six inches is guaranteed or you don't
have to pay.
SHARP PRACTICE
* MANY companies still believe that women have not yet learnt to
handle a razor. Where have they been? The Beauty Box is currently wading
through sheaves of press releases all pleading for attention with lines
such as ''For beautiful beachworthy legs without the worry of nicks and
cuts nothing beats the Ladyshave Aqua''. Well, I've got news for those
who think that women in the bath somehow wrestle with sadistic cum
masochistic urges to draw blood. Men's razors are so good nowadays that
we don't need to prove our femininity by buying a female version, such
as the Philips HP2720 battery Ladyshave Aqua at #23.95. Any Bic will do.
CODED COLOUR
* IT seems that old giraffe neck herself has scooped a contract with
Clairol. Linda Evangelista, supermodel, is the new face for Clairol's
Ultress Gel Colourant. Linda is internationally renowned for changing
the colour of her hair, from blonde to orange to black. We don't like to
gush at the Beauty Box, probably because we are deluged with sycophantic
simperings all the bloody time. Linda says in the press release:
''Working with Clairol will give me an opportunity to support a quality
product that is in sync with my nature and personality.'' (Oh, that's
why one changes one's hair colour, to pretend one has a personality.)
''I truly get an emotional lift from the hair-colouring process,'' she
goes on. Must be something they put in it. Ultra Gel Colourant by
Clairol costs #4.85.
* CABOUCHON make luxury accessories at affordable prices. Silk ties
come in an array of colours patterned with motifs to complement a
co-ordinating range of cuff links, tie-pins and tie-clips, from marine
life to animals to sundials. Presents for the man in your life, father,
brother, or lover, include the 18-carat gold-plated Cabouchon money clip
or Cabouchon pen in classic royal blue or tortoiseshell. Prices start at
#4.99 for a tie-pin, and cuff links from #8.50.
WELL RED
* THEY say that people who wear red are the most aggressive. With this
in mind, we suggest the following colour scheme as a means of therapy,
of sorting out the wheat from the chaff. That man at work, for example,
who constantly asks you to ''Cheer up'' or says ''Smile, you're nicer
when you smile''. Wear red, and enjoy the intimidation it can bring. Be
bold. Smile inscrutably and tell him that if he ever talks to you again
in that cloying, smug manner you will tell everybody in the building
about what he proposed to you during that company trip to Blackpool.
These are the things you could never get away with in fluffy pastel
pink. The red lippie is from Revlon's Ultimate II range priced #10.50.
* ESTEE Lauder introduce The Coffee Bar Collection, seven new shades
of brown, from Perfect Espresso, to Tawny Tawny, Mocha Java, Cafe Latte,
Honey Honey, and Matte Bronze. Lipsticks start at #11.50, Lip Defining
Pencils at #9, and Automatic Pencils for Lips #14.50. Available from all
Estee Lauder counters throughout the country.
* Clinique introduce a new fragrance for men. Chemistry kicks off with
a top note of ginger ale and Jamaican ginger, then to mid-notes of black
pepper, clary sage, and jasmine, down to balsam, musk, and amber. In the
1700s, with the accession of Louis XV, court etiquette demanded that
every person wear a different scent every day. Before his death in 1836
the deposed King of France, CharlesX, attempted to fight senility by
inhaling the scents in his bathwater. In 1890, Oscar Wilde popularised
lavender water as a signature scent. It is clear that men and perfume do
mix. Chemistry is #30 for a 100ml Cologne Spray.
ON SPEC
* I AM a speccy person and proud of it. I sympathise with the
short-sighted. There is only so much a magnifying compact mirror can do,
including the undermining of its owner by reflecting the same distorted
image as a trip to the hall of mirrors. The bespectacled have endless
problems regarding style. Eye make-up, how much, will anyone notice, and
can I see properly enough to put it on? Boots are heavy on the wordplay
and extravagant with promises. They write: ''When it comes to clarifying
the situation and focusing on the essentials Boots opticians have come
to the rescue''. Thank God. They're selling glasses. Any kind, any size,
any price, for anywhere. I can see clearly now . . .
* THE sarong is a holiday must. The Body Shop have introduced three
exclusive designs for this summer in a soft, fully-washable 100% Indian
cotton. Sarongs are suitable for all ages and all sizes. Simply tie them
around your bust or waist in the traditional Balinese and Tahitian way;
alternatively, make a turban and wrap all your beach goodies inside. The
designs focus on three shapes -- the Sun, Orchid, and Fish. The Sun
print is in red, yellow, and orange, the Orchid in a bright floral
design, and the Fish in blue. The Body Shop sarong retails at #8.95.
Also available are scarves and T-shirts in Sun and Fish designs from
Fair Trade partnerships in India.

AS PART of the Borders Season, Radio 4 broadcast The Candlemass Road,
dramatised from the novel of the same name by George MacDonald Fraser.
Directed by Patrick Rayner, this play was a delight; a vibrant, well
told sixteenth-century story of Border warfare.
The dodgy territory between England and Scotland is confronted by the
young Lady Margaret Dacre when she returns from Queen Elizabeth's court
to take control of her late grandfather's land in Askerton, Cumberland.
The events are narrated by Father Luis -- a world and soul-weary
traveller who had been given priest-space in an anti-Catholic sanctuary.
He spoke from a place without protection, worrying about what a
highly-protected aristocratic young woman would make of the blackmail
and barbarism of her heritage. And what could have been
radio-costume-drama became a fascinating exploration of frontier
politics.
Unwilling to allow herself or her tenants to be blackmailed, the
fiesty heroine makes a deal with a seemingly reprobate thief called
Archie Noble -- performed with wry passion by Bill Wrightman. Noble is
given two options by Lady Margaret: either he faces death, or he sorts
out the bad guys on her behalf.
She is appalled but aroused by his impudent confidence in the face of
his ladylord -- she has already chosen the tree by which he will hang
unless he complies, and is amazed that under such duress he insists on
making terms. On the contrary, says Noble -- the ideal time to make
deals is with a death threat hanging over you.
Sexual power and politics in a fascinating historical context is the
stuff of good drama, and the dialogue between the lady and the thief
successfully conveyed the ''knowing'' between them, overseen by Father
Luis (Laurence Payne); tired and intuitive, watching the development of
the exchange from his powerless altar.
When, against the odds, Archie Noble gets rid of the wild Nixons, the
lady offers him not just a steady job as constable of her new territory
but her bed into the bargain; the pact seems done, but he rejects the
deal -- and her -- because he knows that his act in her service will not
be forgotten or go unavenged.
The plot was Wild Rover meeting political realism and it only worked
because of the emotional precision of the language. The powerless if
honourable renegade is cast without assistance to the mercy of the
negotiators of barbarism. Lady Margaret Dacre looks to herself, having
been rebuffed, and allows the man who saved her to be hounded.
She declares that she is ''bred of this border'', and in this
dog-eat-dog world has found her place; the fate of a petty trafficker
and broken man is of no intimate import, despite her pangs.
Played with sass by Ruth Gemell, Lady Margaret was a familiar and
historically accurate figure. Patrick Rayner brought this piece
impressively to life.
A less confident gal, however, was the central character in Trevor
Royle's fine adaptation of Felicia's Journey.
Anne-Marie Horan played the title role of the adaptation of William
Trevor's novel, which used the story of a seduced and abandoned young
Irish girl to explore the ghastly washed-out world of post-Thatcher
England, where powerlessness leads to dangers. Just like the Borders,
400 years ago.
But thank God and Chic Murray that there is an absurd humour in the
arbitrary nature of experience.
In the Tall Droll: A Celebration of the Humour of Chic Murray (R2) the
sublime, surrealistic style of the comedian was brought to life with the
contributions of his wife Madie, Jimmy Logan and the actor Eric Barlow,
among others.
Bordering on the mad, while seemingly making perfect sense, seems to
have been the theme this week.

KUWAIT Petroleum (GB) has spent #5.7m on modernising and enlarging the
loading facility for road tankers at its Grangemouth depot to boost
sales in Central Scotland.
The seven new loading gantries at the company's Ross Chemicals depot
in Grangemouth harbour constitute a giant service station where each
tanker can load 25,000 litres or more of fuel within a few minutes.
More than 90 lorries a day visit the terminal, whose loading capacity
has almost doubled as a result of the modernisation.
Ross Chemicals was purchased by Kuwait Petroleum in 1986.
It imports oil products and liquid chemicals by ship and stores them
in large tanks for local distribution by road tanker.
Only a fraction of the 900,000 tonnes of products that pass through
the terminal each year actually belongs to Kuwait Petroleum, which
operates 584 service stations in the UK trading under the Q8 logo.
Ross Chemicals' main business is handling products for other oil and
chemical companies, which use Grangemouth as a gateway to Scottish
markets. These include Gulf, Fina and Conoco.
Kuwait Petroleum is owned by the Kuwaiti Government and controls a
modest 2% of the UK oil products market.
Its market share is even lower in Scotland, where there are only 20 Q8
service stations.
But Owen Jenkins, the managing director of the UK subsidiary, Kuwait
Petroleum (GB), said that the company is determined to expand north of
the Border.
''What we have done is to use the plant here, after upgrading it, as
the epicentre of our operations in Central Scotland,'' Mr Jenkins said.
''We look on Central Scotland as one of our preferred marketing areas
in the UK and as the opportunities present themselves we would very much
like to improve our market share,'' he added.
Kuwait Petroleum (GB), which invests about #20m per year in the UK,
plans to spend a further #3m on upgrading Ross Chemicals' storage tanks
in Grangemouth.
But Mr Jenkins was cagey about his plans to boost sales in Scotland,
saying only that the company aimed to ''substantially increase'' its
sales of petrol, heating oil and industrial fuels.
Like other UK oil companies, Kuwait Petroleum is working on very thin
refining and distribution margins of about 4% at present. But Mr Jenkins
said Kuwait Petroleum had a long-term strategy to boost its presence in
the UK and would press on regardless.
The company has annual turnover of #540m in the UK, but Mr Jenkins
declined to reveal its profit level.
Kuwait produces about 2.1 million barrels per day of crude and has
invested heavily in downstream activities such as refining and
distribution to guarantee markets for its oil and add value.
During the last 20 years Kuwait Petroleum it has bought up a string of
refineries and oil distribution companies in Europe and in Denmark it
claims 22% of the local market.
But the Q8 petrol sold in Scotland does not come from the burning
oilfields reclaimed from Saddam Hussein. It is purchased on a long-term
contract from Statoil in Norway.

SCOTTISHPOWER has entered the next phase of a revolutionary project
which it claims will cut emissions of harmful nitrous oxides from its
coal-fired Longannet Power Station by 60%.
New technology will allow the Glasgow-based utility to burn more coal
to feed planned increases in electricity sales to England, Wales, and
Northern Ireland, while remaining within pollution limits.
ScottishPower heads a European partnership which is developing
technology to burn gas along with coal at the power station on the Forth
Estuary -- a process which cuts pollution.
The company has now outlined its proposals for the
seven-and-a-half-mile gas pipeline, from the west of Dunfermline, which
will feed the #17m project.
It partners in the scheme, which received a #5.5m grant from the
European Commission's THERMIE programme last year, are British Gas,
Babcock Energy, Italian state utility ENEL, Italian engineering group
Ansaldo, the Electricity Supply Board of Eire, and Electricite de
France.
If successful, the technology, due to be commissioned next year, will
be extended from one of four 600MW generating units at Longannet to the
other three, at the rate of one a year.
It would also probably be installed by other companies throughout
Europe, which are faced with increasingly rigorous emission limits.
Although burning gas along with coal would appear to threaten the
future of coal, ScottishPower maintains the opposite is true.
With plans for the upgrading of the interconnector to England and
Wales and a transmission link to Northern Ireland well advanced,
ScottishPower expects about one-third of all its electricity sales to be
outwith its home patch within three years.
Ken Vowles, managing director of ScottishPower's generation division,
said: ''The fact that we can reduce our (nitrous oxide) emissions by 60%
will allow us to increase our coal-burn for exports and other
opportunities.''
Nitrous oxides contribute to acid rain.

IF, AS Jo O'Connor maintains, everybody -- and possibly anybody -- has
at least one book and play inside them, then O'Connor's first play by
the Dublin-based Pigsback company shows that it takes more than just
silvery word-spinning to become a playwright -- though there's no doubt
he has plenty of that.
''You could boil an egg on him -- three minutes,'' says the ebullient,
dependable Medbh (a delicious performance from Kathy Downes) colourfully
describing the full extent of her lover's love-making to mother of all
the Doyles, Moya.
A saga of family recriminations and new revelations, the Doyles --
Medbh, London-based brother Johnny and their New York exiled sister
Catherine and boy-friend Tom -- have all come home to prepare for the
proposed wake of their father Endan, a character we see only through his
self-made videos and which portrays him as enigmatically,
self-confidently inscrutable, part academic, part Elvis Presley poseur,
part poet.
Unfaithful, but not in the way anticipated, Endan remains the play's
dramatic engine and by far the most intriguing aspect in an evening
that, for all O'Connor's gifts of wit, settles far too easily for stock
naturalism and maudlin reminiscence.
Certainly the sibling squawls have an all-too-painful sting of truth
about them as does Johnny's undisguised fury (he makes Jimmy Porter
sound like a purveyor of nursery rhymes), and the long-suffering, stoic
goodness of Anne Kent's Moya. But Red Roses and Petrol feels, as
O'Connor has reported, as if it just came pouring out. Having heart and
telling stories in the theatre is not enough; it's the means you find to
tell them that counts.

ASDA chief executive Archie Norman has made #1.26m through a share
option deal, it emerged yesterday.
The supermarket group's boss was allowed to buy more than two million
shares at 36p each and sold most of them yesterday at 97p, netting him a
profit of 61p a share.
Mr Norman still has 200,820 shares in the Leeds-based group, according
to Asda.

WHAT with Jumping Jack Flash Jagger back at Wembley, Marianne Faithful
at Shepherds Bush and now Julie Christie on stage at Wyndhams, it really
has been like old times revisited in London.
This Theatre Clywd production of Pinter's brilliant, enigmatic essay
on ownership and sexual fantasy is Christie's belated West End debut --
at the age of 55 -- and could hardly suit her better.
Playing off her own undiminished aura as an icon of her times, she
gives a deliciously beatific humour to Kate, the bisexual object of
desire over whom Deeley, her husband, and Anna, her old friend, are
fighting for control. But Kate belongs to no-one and Lindy Davies's
smarting, tensile production makes you marvel all over again at a play
that shimmers with so many subtleties of meaning.
Did Anna really die? Has she returned as a dream in Kate's
imagination? But then Kate herself is something of a blank sheet, a
mirror of Deeley and Anna's own fantasies while her own feelings remain
locked, cold, and absent.
Whatever, whether you take a metaphoric or naturalistic reading, the
pleasure of watching Christie and fellow actors Harriet Walter and Leigh
Lawson squeezing every ounce of juice out of Pinter's bare bones is
analogous to that of listening to the subtle harmonies of a Mozart or
Schubert chamber trio -- and twice as erotic.
Walter, at her most stylish and still, makes quietly explicit the
implied, suppressed passion between the two women. Reality and imagining
are interchangeable here -- and just as potent, sexuality and sexual
roles a shifting, interchangeable continuum that, in the end, reduces
Lawson's shaggy, raddled film-director husband, far from being the
master of his object of desire, to a tragic, mere outsider. Exquisite.

AMERICA has many things going for it, and it's always difficult to
knock a country that's given us the atom bomb, home delivery pizza, and
Baywatch. Unfortunately, though, it's not all highbrow; we have to
recognise the horrendous things the US Government forces on the rest of
the world, in particular the effects of its international travel
industry. This Tourist Export Policy was started in an attempt to make
the States more tolerable during the summer. Sending the more irritating
members of society abroad for a few weeks gives a bit of a holiday to
the ordinary folks back home, and the results of this programme can be
seen in any part of Edinburgh between May and September.
Most of the recruits, or ''tourists'' as they are known, are
unwittingly chosen for their capacity to annoy passers-by in a matter of
seconds. The exact recruitment criteria are hidden in the fogs of
Washington bureaucracy, but it's widely believed that they include an
ability to mispronounce any place name of two syllables or more, a
tendency to wear clothes that resemble cast-offs from a pantomime horse,
and a talent for making loud but vacuous comments at a pitch reminiscent
of fingernails drawn down a blackboard.
Unfortunately the US Government fails to see the effects of this plan
on the economies of the countries visited. The money the Yanks bring to
Scotland fuels demand in two main areas: tartan gonks and potpourri.
This has the unfortunate effect of diverting energy, manpower, and
resources from our traditional industries, leaving us exposed to the
vagaries of world gonk demand. Although our gonk production capacity has
always been second to none, US trade links have allowed this trade
sector massively to overheat. Rumour has it that the bottom is about to
fall, Barings-style, from the gonk and potpourri (Gapp) market, and when
it does the mammoth job losses throughout Scotland will cause our
economy to nosedive, leaving us all dependent on handouts from the
States.
It may be frightening, but it shouldn't really surprise us. The CIA
has apparently known about the effects of gonk overproduction for some
time and will stop at nothing to achieve its shadowy aims. Apparently
JFK knew too much about the gonk-effect, and by late 1963 he was due to
blow the lid off the whole business, or Gonkgate as it's become known.
We all know what happened to him, don't we? Yup, he slept with Marilyn
Monroe. Lucky or what? Anyway, as the gonk wars are being propagated,
the malls of America are full of people of near-pensionable age being
dragged towards travel agencies.
''Hey, I don't wanna go to Eeroap again!''
''Sure you do Ed. Now stop struggling or you might tear your new pink
tartan trousers.''
Unfortunately, over the past few years we've just played right into
their hands. To optimise the financial benefits, we in Britain have
devised even more ways to entertain tourists. Most of these
''amenities'', or ''wallet drainers'' as they're called in the trade,
could have a millionaire selling the Big Issue before you could say
''International phone call from your hotel room''.
The first thing we do to accommodate them is finish the football
season. It doesn't matter how strong the lobbies are, we will always
play winter football in this country. Americans don't understand
football, so we get it out of the way while they're not around, leaving
us free to fleece them while they attend the golf and tennis
tournaments.
Yanks want action, skill, and excitement when they watch sport, and
that's just not what Scottish football is about. Admittedly you don't
get too many thrills from golf or tennis either, but at least you get
history, which as far as the Americans are concerned is one of the few
good reasons to visit Europe. Americans tend to go crazy over a bit of
history, mainly because it's something they never get back home.
(Tasteless Hugh Grant quip removed -- Ed.)
In America they have some concept of tradition, but it's pretty mild
by our standards. What they would call tradition we would call habit. If
a golfer hits a great shot on an American course, then that's tradition,
unless it was before 1963, or played by Arnold Palmer, then it becomes
history. If you thought the idea of tradition was bad, their history is
even worse, mostly because they're still at a stage where they make it
up as they go along. If you ignore Native American history, as most
Americans do, you see that all of their historic monuments are, by our
standards, brand spanking new. Most of our pop stars, even ones that
sing songs like Shaik Ya Booty (DA Funk is UP), are older than their
historic monuments. In American terms, the Mackintosh School of Art
would be a medieval building.
As far as Americans are concerned, it doesn't matter how facile or
insignificant an event is, if it happened in the USA, then that's enough
to allow it to be consigned to the annals of history. The home run by
that Oakie McScoaggy made for the Dodgers in '49 (a top-swerved archball
to the hoochers, apparently) is as much a part of their heritage as the
shooting of JFK. This is probably why the OJ trial has so much of a hold
on public imagination in the States. If a Scottish footballer were
charged with a similarly horrendous stabbing, then of course we'd be
shocked, but only because our footballers could usually only cause death
by cliche. They certainly couldn't kick them to death. No matter how
shocked we were, we wouldn't be quite so obsessed about it. In the
States, however, they've completely flipped. To them this is more than a
mere sportsman on trial, this is their heritage in the dock. Our
sportspersons may be rotten, but at least we keep them in context.
So with history as the carrot, American tourists are herded round
Britain in giant coaches trooping out only to mill through every gonk
centre and coffee shoppe, gradually destabilising the Footsie with every
wool/wood/tartan contraption.
They're blissfully unaware that they're doing any harm, and in fact
they believe that they're doing us some good by bringing hard currency
to our impoverished shores while they do Scatlan'. They don't lose the
student approach to travel: as long as you've been somewhere, no matter
how fleeting the visit, then you've done it. For them, Scotland is a
drive past Glasgow, a visit to Stirling Castle, trip to Loch Ness, a
drive to Edinburgh, stopping off at Princes Street to buy a tartan
scarf, then off down to London via Stratford-Upon-Avon. The rest of
Britain can be ''done'' in around three days, then it's off to France
(ie, Paris) and mainland Europe, usually only to those places with a
fully functional McDonald's. After three weeks it's back to Heathrow for
a final duty-free gonk-buying frenzy and home to a refreshed USA.
I know America's a new country, but why can't they be as laid back
about history as we are? Why can't they just let it evolve? Our sense of
history is so well developed that we still consider it worth while
getting drunk, causing traffic jams, and having fist fights over
commemorations for a battle that took place overseas in the late
seventeenth century. Now that's what I call a sense of history.
How can we fight this economic invasion? What can we do with the
irritating, incoherent, badly dressed, talentless members of our
society? Easy: we'll do what we always do -- vote them on to the
council.

AT one stage I was waiting for Clive Anderson to arrive on stage and
announce we were watching Whose Gig Is It Anyway? That was perhaps the
moment when the inimitable Kim Fowley invited demon bin-lid basher Gus
out of the audience to wallop the drums during a run through surf
classic Wipeout.
Or was it the moment when he invited one young lady to give us five
reasons why she should be allowed to bed Tim Roth? Or the Scottish
Nationalist extolling the virtues of independence in a short diatribe?
Or even the drag artist who grabbed the microphone to despair that some
girl was covering her chest and if she had a cleavage (which he sadly
didn't) she should flaunt it?
This evening resembled a flowing stream (nay raging torrent) of
consciousness from Mr Fowley, a free-form ramble through a few lyrics
made up on the spur of the moment and a chance to bizarrely bond with
his public.
A request for a title he could instantly concoct a song from resulted
in Crab Meat, a crustacean love song which Mr Fowley obviously hoped
would be taken on several horizontal levels.
At times the whole event transcended the best Opportunity Knocks ever
had to offer. People who had given him demo tapes were invited to air
their dreams of stardom while bemused punters were dragged on stage to
harmonise, disharmonise, or just dance as required. In among this
chaotic affair, various BMX Bandits helped Kim out, with Duglas Stewart
returning for a couple of vocal exercises after warming the crowd up
before Fowley's arrival, and Kim's producer Mike Bennett growled his way
through a noisy version of the Stranglers' Peaches.
Kim Fowley resembles the psychopathic killer in the film Manhunter and
his greatest hit was They're Coming To Take Me Away, Haha. Kim Fowley is
125, or so he says. Enough said.

ANY doubt that Oasis are the biggest thing in British music today is
removed with the overwhelming response to the mere unveiling of their
backdrop, which is greeted with a roar the size of which most bands are
unlikely to accumulate in an entire career.
This is an undoubted haven for fervour and adulation, the type of
which only Take That of the Gallagher brothers' contemporaries could
match, the difference being that this is primarily, though not
exclusively, a laddish, male audience.
The commitment of the band to these fans is also laudable, their
value-for-money approach reflected in the low cost of tickets for such a
large-scale event and their shunning of potentially more lucrative
venues.
Five songs into the set it is obvious that the good-natured and
boisterous atmosphere in the tent has been achieved at a cost, volume
has been preferred to subtlety, with feedback and distortion leaving an
indelible impression on the ears, but even the opening salvo represents
a remarkable achievement for a band a mere 15 months into their
recording career.
The first of the new songs, Hello, sits comfortably between the
singles Supersonic and Some Might Say -- neither a great advance nor a
drop in quality from the songs that have made Definitely Maybe a double
platinum album.
Oasis are adept at stealing from and carefully reproducing their '70s
heroes while leaving their own impression on the sound, but it is only
towards the end and the fiery versions of Live Together, and Cigarettes
and Alcohol that the set really ignites.
In traditional manner, I Am The Walrus closes proceedings, and Oasis
confirm their status at the forefront of British pop. Its future could
certainly be in less capable hands.

Historian and author James Hunter, chairman of Skye and Lochalsh
Enterprise, urges the Government to take a new line on the Highlands and
Islands, an area set to become one of the most dynamic in Europe
PARTLY because the Conservative Government has been oddly reluctant to
claim any credit for one of the more extraordinary transformations to
have occurred in Scotland this century, most Scots are unaware that the
Highland Problem, as traditionally defined, has been largely relegated
to the history books. Most Scots, as a result, are mistakenly inclined
to the view that the northern half of their country remains
characterised by exceptionally high rates of unemployment, persistent
depopulation, and all the other standard symptoms of rural
disintegration.
Such manifestations of social and communal decline can still be found
in the Highlands and Islands. They can be found in South Harris -- a
place whose various travails were poignantly rehearsed by several of the
people who gave evidence to the recent inquiry into the planned
superquarry at Lingerbay. Without a major jobs boost of the kind the
quarry's promoters had promised, these people argued, South Harris could
well cease to exist as a worthwhile human community.
To make a circuit of South Harris is to appreciate the force of such
arguments. Many of the island's houses appear to have been abandoned.
Others, though still occupied, have something of the unkempt appearance
which -- whether in Easterhouse or in the Hebrides -- is a pointer both
to social deprivation and to the sense of hopelessness which deprivation
can engender.
But what is most striking about South Harris, in the context of the
wider Highlands and Islands, is how exceptional it has become for such a
place to be locked into a downward spiral so unrelentingly dispiriting
in its psychological impact as to make even a superquarry seem
momentarily appealing.
Time was, after all, when the future of much of the Highlands and
Islands seemed every bit as bleak as the future of South Harris seems
today. Some 30 or 40 years ago, as is clear from the briefest of trawls
through the relevant files in the Scottish Record Office, official
reports on prospects for localities like the West Highland mainland,
Mull, and Skye were unrelievedly pessimistic in tone. In much of this
area the population had fallen by one-quarter in only 20 years. The
landscape was disfigured by ''sad blots of ruined houses''. Crofts had
been abandoned. Employment was almost impossible to obtain.
''In brief,'' one Scottish Office team concluded, ''the Highland scene
presents a picture of a drift of the younger people to the towns,
leaving behind a diminishing and ageing population . . . approaching a
position at which it could no longer maintain itself.''
Today the same Highland scene -- as may be discovered by journeying
from Oban to Assynt by way of Mull, Moidart, Morar, Skye, and Wester
Ross -- has changed in ways which the authors of that last commentary
would not have believed possible.
As is evident from the new houses which are everywhere to be seen,
this is now an area of soaring population. Nor is population growth
confined to larger settlements like Tobermory, Portree, and Ullapool.
One wholly rural locality, the Sleat peninsula, has seen its population
rise by no less than 60% in just over 20 years -- while the wider Skye
and Lochalsh district, to which Sleat belongs, turned in an overall
expansion of some 15% in the 10 years to 1991.
Such developments serve to underline the peculiarly untrumpeted fact
that the North of Scotland, so long synonymous with apparently
unstoppable outflows of population, is today making very different
demographic news. No other predominantly rural area in the European
Union has recently been gaining population as fast as the Highlands and
Islands.
The Skye and Lochalsh experience, admittedly, is exceptional -- even
by Highlands and Islands standards. But it is nevertheless indicative of
upward pressures sufficiently widespread to ensure that those Highlands
and Islands localities which have been gaining population (notably
Orkney, the west coast mainland, the Moray Firth area, and islands like
Skye and Mull) have more than made good the losses occurring in those
other places (like South Harris and the Western Isles more generally)
where depopulation has still to be decisively reversed. Although the
1980s saw Scotland's population dip by more than 3%, the overall
Highlands and Islands trend was strongly in the opposite direction.
Nor is this phenomenon to be explained, as is sometimes said, by
people moving north to retire. In Skye and Lochalsh, for instance,
over-65s accounted for a significantly smaller proportion of the
population in 1991 than they had done 10 years earlier. This is because
the district's population increase was concentrated in the 20 to 44 age
group. And since such people are more economically active than others,
it is no surprise to find that, between 1981 and 1991, the Skye and
Lochalsh economy expanded even more dramatically than the district's
population -- with the number of economically active individuals going
up by over one-third, and with total employment rising by almost half.
This is not to say that unemployment has been banished from the
Highlands and Islands. Redundancies at Dounreay, the downturn in
oil-related activity, and the international recession's negative impact
on the tourist trade have all conspired to ensure that the North of
Scotland's jobless figures remain unacceptably high. Even this cloud,
however, is acquiring the beginnings of a silver lining.
This year's springtime unemployment rates of 7.9% (Skye and Wester
Ross), 7.7% (Badenoch), 7.2% (Islay and Mid-Argyll), 7.2% (Inverness),
6.6% (Lochaber), 5.2% (Oban), 4.3% (Orkney), and 3.5% (Shetland) were
not such -- with the possible exception of the last two or three of
these statistics -- as to occasion much by way of celebration. But those
unemployment rates, like the comparable rate for the Highlands and
Islands as a whole, were below both the Scottish and British averages.
Just like the region's emergence as a population growth area, this
represents a spectacular overturning of historical trends -- the
Highlands and Islands, ever since such things began to be measured,
having usually suffered unemployment rates several times greater than
those prevailing in the south.
There are those, of course, who discern in all of this a cause for
lamentation. To Settler Watch and other neo-fascist dwellers on the
wilder shores of Scottish nationalism, the accelerating repopulation of
the Highlands and Islands is something to be deplored, not least because
-- as is exemplified by the fact that one in six people living in Skye
and Lochalsh was born in England -- much of this repopulation is a
consequence of migration from other parts of Britain. The so-called
white settler is not so much welcomed as blamed, and not just by Settler
Watch, for everything from housing shortages to the undeniably
precarious condition of the Gaelic language.
Although such facts are not likely to make much impression on those
who define what it is to be Scottish in much the same
ethnically-obsessed way as Adolf Hitler defined what it was to be
German, migration into the Highlands and Islands has actually been less
detrimental to Gaelic as is often assumed. Our distinctive cultural
traditions are prominent among the factors which are persuading people
to make new lives for themselves in the North of Scotland. In the
increasingly numerous Highlands and Islands primary classrooms, where
pupils are taught entirely through the medium of Gaelic, it is common to
find Gaelic-speaking children whose surnames are obviously English.
But for all that such children, and their parents, are making a more
meaningful contribution to the survival of Scotland's oldest living
language than the sloganeering bigotry of the Settler Watch variety,
there remains much to be done if we are to deprive our aspiring racists
of the materials from which they are so assiduously trying to construct
a political platform.
Although there will be lots of setbacks along the road, both the
Highlands and Islands' economy and the Highlands and Islands' population
will almost certainly continue to expand. The way in which the region
has managed to corner so much of one of the modern world's scarcest
resources -- a comparatively unspoilt and unpolluted natural environment
-- will be one key element in its future advance. Another will be the
extent to which technological developments, not least in the computer
and telecommunications fields, enable people simultaneously to enjoy a
rural lifestyle and to engage in occupations of a sort which were
previously confined to urban centres.
What has got to be energetically countered if anti-incomer hostility
is not to spiral out of control, however, is any tendency for the more
successful society which is now emerging in the Highlands and Islands to
fragment in such a way that to be a white settler is automatically to
have a high income and a good home while to be a ''native'' is to have a
low income and a poor home.
That is why the one thing which our newly appointed Scottish
Secretary, Michael Forsyth, could most usefully do for a locality like
Skye and Lochalsh would be to help its housing association and others to
step up their already strenuous efforts to cope with the housing
problems which are by far the most unacceptable downside of economic
growth and population increase. Rickety residential caravans and
below-tolerable-standard homes may not be so apparent to the casual
visitor as the spanking new houses mentioned earlier. But such caravans,
and such homes, certainly exist in many parts of the Highlands and
Islands. It is time they were eradicated.
Here in Skye and Lochalsh people are considering how whole new
villages might be established in places (and the currently booming Sleat
peninsula is one such place) which last century's landlords cleared.
Agencies are equally keen to explore how new houses might be equipped as
the sort of workplaces required by folk who want to take advantage of
the economic opportunities opened up by national and international
computer networks. There is a determination, in other words, to build
strongly on what people here have already accomplished. And it is
greatly to be hoped that the Scottish Secretary, who has urged everyone
to engage in dialogue with him, will take a constructive interest in
what Skye and Lochalsh -- and other places in the North of Scotland --
is at present about.
Michael Forsyth, if he is to move in our direction, will have to
resist the temptation to portray the public expenditure requirements of
the Highlands and Islands as deriving solely from subsidy-junkies in
search of yet another fix. Now that the Highlands and Islands is on its
way to becoming one of Scotland's success stories, it needs a Scottish
Secretary who is prepared to invest in this success.
The possibilities are illustrated by the achievements of Sabhal Mor
Ostaig -- Skye's independently managed Gaelic-medium college. Founded 20
years ago in an abandoned farm steading, Sabhal Mor has been the
recipient of modest, but unusually imaginative, assistance from the
public purse. As a result, the college and its associated businesses are
today providing 40 jobs -- as well as offering a unique range of
educational courses.
On an island where people shall shortly be required to meet the cost
of the new bridge by paying tolls which will be higher than those levied
on any comparable facility on Earth, there is a need for more
expenditure of the sort behind Sabhal Mor Ostaig.
The Skye Bridge will lead to an island where, to reiterate, people are
trying to foster the emergence of a quality economy. The Skye Bridge
will also lead to an island where the single secondary school is so
overcrowded and dilapidated that an international property firm, in a
report commissioned by a local action group, has recommended that
several of the classrooms be subject to ''immediate closure'' on health
and safety grounds. The school, if the area is to make the most of its
developmental opportunities, needs urgently to be replaced. And only
Michael Forsyth can sanction the necessary expenditure.
There is no reason, of course, why the Scottish Secretary should pay
particular attention to Skye and Lochalsh. But Mr Forsyth might
nevertheless do a favour to both the North of Scotland and his party by
reflecting on the more general message which this essay is intended to
convey.
It would be good if, having so reflected, Michael Forsyth were to
adopt as constructive and as innovative an approach as possible to
everything from northern railway services to the development of a
University of the Highlands and Islands.
Even the most intractable of Tory difficulties, the issue of
Scotland's constitutional future, might be partly resolved by such a new
departure. Suppose, for example, Michael Forsyth were to recreate that
post-war institution, the Highland Panel. Consisting of Highlands and
Islands MPs, councillors and others, the panel was responsible, in
conjunction with the Secretary of State, for Highlands and Islands'
policy. A revived and enhanced version could prove the ideal means by
subjecting quangos like Highlands and Islands Enterprise and its
associated local enterprise companies to a measure of democratic
scrutiny.
Still more enticing, from Michael Forsyth's perspective anyway, would
be the possibility of detaching the northern half of Scotland from the
wider devolutionary cause by thus providing the Highlands and Islands
with what could eventually amount to a regional assembly of a type which
could never threaten -- because nobody wants Highlands and Islands'
independence -- United Kingdom unity.
Any such attempt to reposition the Conservative Government in relation
to the Highlands and Islands will require one further -- and still more
radical -- readjustment, of course. The Tories, if they are to become
spokesmen for a demographically resurgent, economically expanding, and
culturally self-confident Highlands and Islands, will have to abandon
their increasingly anachronistic and electorally catastrophic
identification with the region's lairds. Instead of aligning themselves
unthinkingly with absentee sportsmen and speculators, Conservative
Ministers will need to identify with the growing number of Highlands and
Islands residents who are sufficiently self-assured and enterprising as
to want to take charge of their area's most basic resource. Tories, in
short, will have to become land reformers.
Enclosing this article and one or two supporting papers, I have
responded to Michael Forsyth's offer to engage in dialogue about
Scotland's future by sending him a letter advocating just such a change
of direction. I await the Scottish Secretary's reply with interest.

FRIDAY night at the SYDF -- it's almost the end of the festival and
it's the turn of various tutors and musicians to strut their stuff.
Sadly, ironically, two of the tutors can't perform -- both have been
injured -- while teaching, apparently, and not at one of the late-night
hoolies that make the festival a real celebration of dance as pure
enjoyment.
So, while Adele Thompson hobbled to her seat (a pulled calf muscle, I
believe), a motley troupe of musicians wandered on stage and filled the
breach. Early fooling around with bottles -- much popping, hooting, and
rasping -- led into a merry session with an Eastern European feel. Grand
sounds and some genial clowning as well.
A fractured wrist prevented Brigid McCarthy from being part of The
Company -- Power of Four (an SYDF commission choreographed by artistic
director Winifred Jamieson) rapidly became Power of Three . . .
Obviously this altered the dynamics of the piece but Dawn Hartley, Lisi
Perry, and Michael Seaborne worked well together, bringing out a sense
of oppositions and coalitions within the shifting textures of the
movement.
At the heart of the programme -- and performing for the first time in
Glasgow -- were four members of CandoCo -- company in residence at this
year's festival. In this integrated company you dance with what you've
got -- legs, a wheelchair, or -- like the fleet and energetic David
Toole -- your arms. His duet with Kuldip Singh-Barmi (a lyrically
athletic dancer) to Spanish guitar music remains one of the lovelist
pieces I've ever seen -- fiercely graceful and free-spirited.
Two earlier pieces, with Celeste Dandeker both in and out of her
wheelchair, highlighted the various ways her mobility -- sometimes in
the arms of a partner -- was a springboard to new ways of moving for
others, too.
A marvellous inspiration for everyone at the SYDF -- but please, could
the full company come to Glasgow soon? At the same time it would be good
to see some of the initiative started locally by the festival continuing
under their own steam, perhaps travelling to wherever this peripatetic
event fetches up next year.

NOT only did the weather give the tabloids the perfect gag for the
Wets return to their native patch, but they've produced a show to back
up the hype of a record-breaking run at the venue.
They did it by going back to what they're best at. For the bulk of the
performance this was a soul review, albeit with a Beatles fetish. The
stage was ruched in white, the band kitted out in Abbey Road-era suits
(apart from Marti's crushed velvet). They were introduced with a snatch
of A Day In The Life and followed their debut single, Wishing I Was
Lucky, with The Temptations' Get Ready, then their own Temptation.
Clever stuff, eh? And all with a crack horn section including the great
Jamie Talbot on saxes.
Rattling though a string of soupy ballads from the latest album,
Picture This, they then made their way -- by way of a flying gantry and
quotes from Isaac Hayes's Shaft and The Emotions' Best Of My Love -- to
the ''unplugged'' stage for as intimate a performance as those who had
blagged a place beside it are ever likely to see from the Wets. The
durries and beanbags scattered on it should have been laughable, but
weren't. The individual party pieces could have been excruciating, but
weren't. The songs included a very nice reading of Lowell George's Roll
It Easy and a With A Little Help From My Friends that nodded at Joe
Cocker's version.
More of the history of the music was evident here than at Page 'n'
Plant earlier in the week, in fact. Who'd have though it?

Francesca Fearon describes how top fashion designers have succumbed to
sultry Spanish influences.
WHEN explaining the inspiration for his autumn/winter haute couture
collection for Guy Laroche, Michel Klein said: ''I dreamed of an actress
who fell in love with a bullfighter. She makes her entrance in a black
tweed suit and sets her heart on a lace dress worn with jet jewellery
and a provocative mantilla -- unaffected, understated -- a fleeting
moment of passion, of love, for a heroine straight out of Goya.''
Klein visualised raven-haired beauties from the 1950s like Ava Gardner
and Maria Callas as his heroines and created for them tight, little
corset-shaped jackets (made for Laroche by the London-based Mr Pearl)
that curved out, Infanta-style, over big gathered skirts.
Tiers of crystal-pleated ruffles, thick guipure laces and arabesques
of jet beading gave a dramatic edge to the silhouette. Veils of black
lace suggested false modesty whether accentuating a cleavage or
mysteriously concealing a pretty face with a mantilla. This was a
Spanish theme abandoning the tourist trappings of flamenco dresses and
castanets for something more subtle and glamorous.
The passionate Spanish mood of Klein's collection for Guy Laroche was
the invisible thread that linked several of the haute couture
collections. Christian Lacroix has always expressed a fondness for the
Latin culture in his ideas, which this season emerged as velvet corsets,
ruffled off-the-shoulder necklines and silk matador shirts.
Deep Latin passions lurk just beneath the surface of Lacroix's work
and that is what makes his collections so popular.
The raised waists and wide skirts of the Infanta ballgown was a
silhouette in several of the collections. Apart from Lacroix, Laroche
used the silhouette for a pink satin ''Goya'' dress embroidered with
black braid. Yves St Laurent -- similarly inspired by Goya with
flame-embroidered capes -- shaped his version in white damask and
embroidered it with arabesques of jet beading.
At Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld's fluid bias-cut cocktail dresses in black
were topped with large toreador hats. The Latin theme was also mixed in
with voluminous amounts of tartan taffeta in Ferre's collection for
Dior.
The black corset-shaped velvets, matador hats, and cascades of jet
jewel evoked a sense of passion and sensuality in Givenchy's farewell
collection. He may be relinquishing the reins of his house, but he
wanted to demonstrate his love for what he had achieved -- and he did it
with style. Ironically, Hubert de Givenchy's recently-confirmed
successor John Galliano imagined a shipwrecked Spanish princess as the
muse for his own winter ready-to-wear collection of scarlet bias-cut
gowns.
The wealth of Spanish cultural references in the collections suggests
a new season seething with heady passions.

IF I use the word Bosnia, do you promise not to turn the page? It was
the sight of 84-year-old Szymon Serafinowicz tottering into court to be
accused of war crimes that made me wonder . . . If there is no time
limit on the prosecution of mass murder, and if we argue that it's
legitimate to take action now, on behalf of the victims of pogroms that
happened 50 years ago, how can we witness gross crimes against humanity
in the here and now, and say the reasons for us to stay in Bosnia grow
weaker?
In a week when monstrous crimes are committed against Bosnian people
by Serbian forces, how can the strong and stable nations of Western
Europe watch violent images of ethnic cleansing in Srebrenica and do
nothing but mouth concern? Does modest shuffling on the sidelines of war
atrocities not constitute collusion?
Surely, more than any other single event, it was Britain's
capitulation to Hitler at Munich in 1938 that paved the way for Hitler's
conquest and slaughter of his smaller neighbours? Are we not involved in
appeasement now?
It seems Western leaders have decided that political gangsters like
Radovan Karadzic and Slobodan Milosevic, responsible for war crimes such
as the shelling of Vukovar, can go unchallenged in Bosnia. For the
second time this century Europe remains passive as a community is
destroyed in its midst.
Of course it may be that I'm biased, emotional, hopelessly irrational.
That may have something to do with having spent a day making hopelessly
inadequate efforts to convey the story of two of those who escaped the
killing grounds with their bodies, if not their souls and minds, intact.
Of listening to the pained guilt of the survivors, and wondering where
I've heard it before.
But then remembering that the international community was able to move
300,000 troops to the Gulf in 1990 to liberate Kuwait, was roused to
accuse the Serbian psychopaths of war crimes only when its young
soldiers were held captive, one US airman shot down, surely it's not too
irrational to wonder if some lives are seen as worth more than others.
To believe that of all war crimes, indifference is the worst.
The myth now goes unchallenged that somehow internecine strife in the
Balkans is just too intractable, too complex to become involved in, that
one side is as bad as the other, the shrug that says genocide has gone
on throughout history. For three-and-a-half years we've watched ethnic
cleansing create two million refugees, countless dead, the rape of tens
of thousands of women, the sight of concentration camps, and cities and
towns held siege. Yet still war crimes against Bosnian communities are
met with calls for restraint.
Threats to Western oil supplies elicit decisive political and military
action with smart weapons and winning strategies to halt aggression. It
is the political will, not the military means, that is missing in
Bosnia.
Perhaps it's true that underlying all that happens in Bosnia is the
primal struggle which is the fight for land that throws aside all moral
codes. That ethnic cleansing goes on all the time in other places -- is
happening now in East Timor, in the Western Sahara, in Tibet; that it's
been around since Machiavelli -- does not justify inaction against war
crimes. Nor does it relieve us, or our mealy-mouthed leaders, of
responsibility for failing wilfully to prevent mass slaughter in Bosnia.
The American writer Mark Twain wrote that of all the animals, man is
the only one that is cruel. Man is the only animal that deals in the
atrocity of atrocities, war. He is the only one that gathers his
brethren around him and goes out in cold blood and with calm pulse to
exterminate his kind.
He sets himself apart in his own country, under his own flag, and
sneers at the other nations. He is the only animal that loves his
neighbour as himself, and cuts his throat if his theology isn't
straight. And in intervals between campaigns he washes the blood off his
hands and works for ''the universal brotherhood of man'' -- with his
mouth. Man, he wrote, is truly the Unreasoning Animal.
Shall we just hang around, then, for another half century, wait for
another generation to hold trials for crimes against humanity, in
Srebrenica perhaps? If there's anyone left, that is, to bear witness.

James Holloway looks at the work of a painter who sold an inheritance
for his art
WILLIAM AIKMAN would never have become a painter had his older brother
and father not died within the space of two years leaving him free to
follow a career of his choice. His surviving relatives urged caution and
a steady career in the law but Aikman had other ideas now that he was
able to fund his lengthy art training in Edinburgh, London, and Italy by
selling his ancestral property outside Arbroath.
As a student in Edinburgh Aikman worked as an assistant to Sir John
Medina, the premier portrait painter in Scotland in the last year before
the Union with England. He was in London in May 1707 to hear the bells
ring out across the city to celebrate the Union, writing on May 1 that
year to his uncle, Sir John Clerk of Penicuik: ''The Queen this day
touchd the Act so we are no more Scots and English but all bold
Brittains.'
Aikman soon left London for Italy where cousins of his were long
established in the import-export trade. He travelled on the Continent
with the architect William Kent, and visited Turkey and Greece,
unusually for an artist of this time.
The death of Medina in l710 probably encouraged Aitman to return to
Scotland where he quickly assumed the dominant position of his former
master. Where Medina's style had been rich, confident, and baroque
Aikman's was more diffident and sensitive, as if in music the melody had
changed from a major to a minor key.
With his family connections, his cosmopolitan training as much as his
own ability, Aikman soon became the pre-eminent painter in Scotland. It
was the encouragement of the 2nd Duke of Argyll that persuaded the
artist to move south. The Duke's example encouraged fellow Scots in
London to sit to Aikman for their portraits. But Aikman was soon also
painting the portraits of the most eminent English men and women -- the
Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, the Earl and Countess of Burlington
and the royal family.
It must have been a disappointment to him that he did not succeed Sir
Godfrey Kneller as Principal Painter to the King. The Irishman Charles
Jervas did instead. Aikman found it difficult to balance the expense of
a grand establishment essential for a society portrait painter with the
income he received from his work. Although business came, Aitman's
health gradually declined. He was suffering from tuberculosis and died
early in 1731 at the age of only 49.
He was mourned by many friends especially in the literary world.
Writing to a fellow poet, Alexander Pope commented: 'Your epitaph on
that worthy modest man, poor Aikman, pleases me greatly. Is there
anybody so generous (or rather -- so just) to intend him a monument?''

Gallery.

AMID the cut and thrust of debate over the state of the health service
north of the Border, the threats to Highland rail lines, the vanishing
of Scots Conservatives and a wheen of siclike topical issues, you might
have missed one -- seemingly insignificant -- dispute in the Letters
Page of this very journal. It was all about Brucespeak.
If you've ever any doubt that Scotland remains a nation still with its
own unique character then look no further than these readers'
dispatches. Every so often a topic will surface which confirms our
status and one of the most recent was a cracker. What language, prithee,
spake our patriot king, Robert the Bruce?
While English regional newspapers (and presumably television and
radio), with one eye always on Westminster, debate their local
controversies and singularly fail to get over-excited, bigger issues are
at stake hereabouts. Where else in this United Kingdom would such a
seemingly obscure subject as the mother tongue of a long-dead
revolutionary cause a stir.
On the threshhold of the 21st century the cynics and lost souls will
tell you that such debate only confirms that Scots are locked in a time
warp, introverted and out of touch with greater realities. Balderdash, I
say. It's an indication that we are conscious of, and care about, our
history, our wonderful story which three centuries of Union has failed
to tarnish.
Oddly, the Bruce debate was prompted by the suggestion that French
actor Gerard Depardieu play the screen role of Robert Bruce, the
argument being that his mother tongue would have been Norman French;
another correspondent believed Rab would have spoken Gaelic and I myself
wonder about Auld Scots, or even Norse.
Always anxious to throw in an Orcadian connection, I can tell you that
one legend has it that the Bruce dynasty descended from a tenth-century
Norse earl called Lodver. They sloped off to Normandy and two
generations later Adam de Brus (from the town of Brix) was with
Guillaume le Conquerant when he splashed ashore at Hastings. Brus was
given the job of quieting the restless natives in Yorkshire and for his
success received a number of land grants.
His eldest son Robert was, in 1124, given the Lordship of Annandale (a
strategic western gateway to Scotland) by David I. In all, seven Lords
of Annandale bore the name Robert Bruce, right down to the man who was
to be king.
Bruce himself was born at Turnberry Castle in Ayrshire on July 11,
1274, to a mother of Celtic stock and a father, who as we've seen, was
Norman-French extraction. The Bruces were always alert to the main
chance and the future King Robert, before throwing himself
wholeheartedly into the independence cause, is said to have aided Edward
I against John Baliol.
But to the matter of the moment -- his lingo. He would certainly have
spoken the Norman-French of his peers but it is likely that he also
spoke Gaelic fluently since it would have been the tongue of his
household staff and in use right up the west coast from Galloway to the
Highlands at this period. Perhaps the Bruce spoke ''up'' in Norman
French and ''down'' in Gaelic. At his grandfather's castle of Lochmaben
he probably heard and used the Northern English which was, generations
later, to become broad Scots. It's reasonable to assume his education
also included Latin.
Ronald McNair Scott, a modern biographer of Bruce, summarises: ''He
would have become trilingual at an early age; an accomplishment most
necessary for one who was to draw supporters for his struggle from all
three spheres''.
On this occasion, colleagues, it seems we can all award ourselves a
gold star. Our king was a linguist. Now I wonder if he liked a drop o'
whisky, a nice Bordeaux, a pint of bitter, or maybe he was still a
Carlsberg man?

Anne Redpath's work is defined by many qualities but most of all by
the energy and colour which she brought to her painting. And although
artistic endeavour always came second during her sons' formative years,
once they had grown she went on to produce some of her greatest works.
Lesley Duncan examines Redpath's life and art
SHE confronts visitors at the doorway of the Portland Gallery in
London's fashionable Bury Street. A young woman with an impassive face,
finely arched eyebrows, and sculpted mouth. Her gaze is unfathomable, as
if focused on some inner vision. Her black hair hangs severely from a
central parting. She has the air of a Scottish Pocahontas.
In a curious bisecting effect, the line of her hair-parting is
continued down the brow and nose, across the upper lip and the shadowing
of the chin and throat, into the vertical divide of her gilet. The green
of this garment and the scarlet and white of the kerchief round the neck
suggest the colourist to come.
Meet Anne Redpath, as painted by herself as a young woman. The
self-portrait is a talking-point of the exhibition mounted by the
Portland Gallery on the centenary of the artist's birth.
Such centenaries are of course stock occasions for reassessment. Anne
Redpath will not escape the treatment, especially since she was the
first woman painter (the sculptress Phyllis Bone preceded her) to become
a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy. The London exhibition leads
off a variety of centenary shows. Later in the year there will be others
at the Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the
National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.
The Hawick-raised painter offers cheering precedents for fellow
artists, particularly women. For she overcame a fallow period when the
demands of motherhood and domesticity took priority over -- or perhaps
channelled in other directions -- her own creative instincts. And, like
Verdi's, her work seemed to become more profound and energetic as she
aged.
If her life-story lacked dramatic edge, she compensated in her
canvases. Her Borders heritage certainly impinged on her art. Her father
was a designer of tweeds -- and a very good one by all accounts. He was
known to put an inspired thread of contrasting colour through his
designs. His daughter, too, would become known for her decorative and
dramatic use of colour. Sometimes a dribble of scarlet worked as a
leitmotif. ''I do with a spot of red or yellow in a harmony of grey what
my father did in his tweeds,'' she once said.
The teenaged Redpath went to Edinburgh College of Art in 1913 and
shone. In 1919, with the only travelling scholarship awarded for her
postgraduate year, she visited the Low Countries, France, and Italy.
Several months spent in a pensione in Florence, in a room with rough
white plastered walls, may have prompted a life-long preoccupation with
white. That trip also introduced her to another seminal influence, the
Primitives of Siena.
In 1920 she married the architect James Beattie Michie, who worked for
the War Graves Commission in France. The couple lived in the Pas de
Calais for five years, then moved south to the Riviera. There were three
sons to bring up. Life eclipsed art for 14 years.
Her youngest son, David Michie, himself a distinguished painter and
RSA, comments on those years. ''She didn't stop painting entirely. But
it is perfectly true it was rather secondary to looking after her three
boys. She never regretted it or felt she had lost out. As far as she was
concerned she had a rich kind of life.'' Apparently when she became a
governor of Edinburgh College of Art she was quite shocked when
approached by young women who would say: ''I'm not going to let my
family come between me and my art.'' She didn't perceive herself as
having done this. On the other hand, says her son, ''she had the moral
point of view that if you have children you can't say they're not your
responsibility''.
This dilemma over priorities has dogged creative but conscientious
wives and mothers down the centuries (Clara Schumann is an obvious
musical example) and will no doubt continue to do so as long as
single-mindedness is central to the highest achievement. Individuals
have to make their own accommodations with contradictory impulses, not
to mention the expectations of society. Most probably fail to do so
satisfactorily, particularly when there's a hiatus in a crucial period
of their artistic development. Anne Redpath triumphantly bucked the
trend.
When she and her sons returned from France to settle in Hawick in 1934
(her husband found work in the south), she focused fully again on her
art, no doubt spurred by the need to support her family. Critics agree
that it took her some years to get back the confidence and brio of her
younger self. But when she did by the early 1940s, she went from
strength to strength.
Various aspects of her mature art can be seen at the Portland Gallery
exhibition. In the characteristic still lifes of her middle period,
jugs, teapots, wally hens, and flowers were displayed on tilted
table-tops, verisimilitude subservient to the decorative juxtapositions
of objects and colours. The flowers, often in white receptacles, were
sometimes hardly identifiable -- less Fantin-Latour than Matisse in
effect.
There are examples here. But in the late, outstanding still lifes on
show, the paint and subject matter have acquired a greater urgency and
brilliance. A group of three paintings in the upper gallery -- one oil,
two watercolours -- has the common theme of white flowers, but, in the
oil painting particularly, the surrounding blues and greens swirl with
energy.
Downstairs, several more floral paintings demand attention. In a
watercolour of 1962, the red tulips of the title pose their curving
heads against a background of similar hue -- an almost wilful tour de
force. Bouquet from 1959 is a wild array of high-summer colour, from
lurid limes to pinks. The brushwork has an almost frantic dynamism.
Gallery owner Tom Hewlett speculates that intimations of mortality
(Redpath had heart trouble and died at the age of 69) may have
contributed to the furious energy displayed in this and other late
works. In White Azaleas of 1963, the white flowers and their table
cascade down the centre of the canvas in a torrent of paint.
Most captivating, perhaps, is The Pink Goblet of 1961. In its placing
of household objects -- a white vase, a bowl of African violets, a
teapot, a dish with two lemons -- it harks back to earlier work, but the
background is rich and mysterious and disturbed. The back of the canvas
is revealing too, for attached to it is a letter from Redpath giving her
own comments on the picture to the purchaser. It was, she says, typical
of her painting of that time: ''It is fairly near abstraction but not
quite. I am too interested in the objects themselves to lose them
altogether.''
Like her contemporary William Gillies, Anne Redpath also painted
landscapes thoroughout her life. David Michie points out the contrasting
stimulus presented by these and the still lifes. In the studio the
artist worked within the limits of her own imagination, while landscape
painting offered the challenge of continual changes of tone, colour, and
mood.
This is borne out in Tafira Alta (1959), a semi-abstract view of
hillsides in a tumbling land-mass of blues, greens, and whites. The
little village in the foreground is almost overwhelmed by this lava of
cold colour. The artist painted the same Gran Canaria scene in a warm
palette of reds, oranges, and browns.
Another strand of inspiration in Redpath's late years was the
interiors of baroque churches in Gran Canaria and Portugal. The richness
of the ornamentation and the sometimes sinister figure of Christ
lurching through the curtains were dramatic and exciting to this painter
of ''good Presbyterian background,'' says her son (in fact the family
was Congregationalist). But the appeal was painterly, not religious.
For all its blue mysticism, the example in the Portland Gallery
exhibition -- Altar to the Virgin -- has the show's only jolting
paintwork in the rather crude little heads of the three putti. Venice
and its church interiors provided the subject matter for Redpath's last
major exhibition before her death in January, 1965.
Another London cache of Redpath pictures -- sadly not accessible to
the public -- is in the collection of Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd. The
most important of these is Window in Menton. Once owned by the pianist
Yonty Solomon, it combines elements of portrait, still life, and
landscape. Redpath's work is also held in various Scottish galleries,
notably the Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. Glasgow Art Gallery and
Museum has two oil paintings and a late self-portrait in charcoal, among
other examples of her work.
William Baillie, president of the RSA, did not coincide with Anne
Redpath in the academy, but remembers her from her final Edinburgh
period as a great conversationalist who loved parties almost as much as
painting and was very kind and encouraging to younger artists. He
comments on the energy and dramatic development of her later work,
qualities which explain why ''people revere her as one of the most
important and distinguished of Scottish painters''.

THE Largs rail accident has created ''more of an opportunity than a
problem'' for the town, according to Labour MP Brian Wilson.
The Cunninghame North MP said Tuesday's accident -- when a train ran
through the buffers, destroying several properties and injuring five
people -- had provided a useful development opportunity.
He said: ''Nobody would have wanted such a thing to happen, but now
that the situation exists, it presents a huge development opportunity
for Largs.
''I am assured that the whole consequences are covered by insurance,
but it is now a case of replacing what existed with something better and
more appropriate to future needs, rather than simply restoring what was
there before.''
Mr Wilson, who singled out car parking facilities as a possible avenue
for improvement, has proposed a working group involving the various
railway organisations, the local authority, and other local groups to
draw up a development brief for the site.
A spokeswoman for station owners Railtrack said: ''This was a tragic
and serious accident, and we are going to find out what happened. But it
does not necessarily mean gloom and doom for the area. We will be
examining all possibilities.''
An internal inquiry into the cause of the accident will be held later
this month.

the Burmese people, not the country's military rulers who imprisoned her
for nearly six years, should decide whether she becomes a national
leader. Earlier, she urged countries not to rush into improving

PROFESSOR Steve Bruce's attempt (July 12) to place the marches
organised in the late 1960s by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights
Association in the same category as the province's annual Orange parades
-- such as the latest one which produced a dangerous confrontation with
the local Roman Catholic population on the outskirts of Portadown --
should not be allowed to go without further comment.
The civil rights marches -- which had the whole-hearted support not
just of the ''minority community'' in Ulster but of the more enlightened
members of the ''majority community'' -- had the highly principled and
utterly laudable objective of challenging the widespread anti-Catholic
discrimination which for 50 years had formed the bedrock of the Stormont
regime.
The view, moreover, was subsequently upheld by the Cameron Committee,
appointed by the British Government under a Scottish (Presbyterian)
judge to look into allegations of religious discrimination in Northern
Ireland.
Orange parades, on the other hand -- and particularly those whose
organisers insist on marching through Catholic districts -- have the
perfectly obvious motivation of deliberately provoking and humiliating
the members of that very minority community who for decades had suffered
serious descrimination in employment and housing, and as a consequence
of electoral gerrymandering, at least since the foundation of Ulster's
sectarian mini-state in 1921.
Against this background, and if the minority community in Northern
Ireland is ever to be conviced that the British Government is genuinely
determined to establish a pluralist democracy in ''the province'' then
surely such marches either be banned altogether or else their routes
should be rigorously restricted by the RUC to minimise the offence that
they are undoubtedly intended to give.
To pretend, as Professor Bruce seems to do, that this is an issue of
Orangemen's rights to march in every street in Ulster, when it is
primarily an issue of public order, is surely a departure from the level
of academic impartiality -- or at least balance -- which one is entitled
to expect from such a distinguished scholar.
Would the RUC allow Republicans to exercise their civil liberties by
marching up the Shankhill Road, and if so, would Professor Bruce be
prepared to condone such a totally irresponsible police decision with
its predictably disastrous consequences for the current peace process.

THE identity of a ''secretive' company behind a new high-tech
bio-medical plant in the Highlands was announced yesterday.
A spokesman for Highlands and Islands Enterprise confirmed that
Selfcare Incorporated, of Boston, Massachusetts, was to open a #9.6m
operation in Inverness in December.
Selfcare Inc. were founded in 1992 by British-born Harvard Business
School graduate Roland Zwanziger, and intends to produce a range of
medical testing kits at their new facility.
The identity of the firm was previously kept secret by the Government
jobs agency and Highland Regional Council chiefs, who approved plans for
the new factory last month.
They said that the reason for the secrecy over the name of the new
company was to prevent any of Selfcare's competitors moving into the
same market.
The company will provide an initial 80 jobs, rising to 365 when the
factory is fully operational.
Selfcare also has a factory in Galway in Ireland, which produces Aids
testing kits, but they have assured locals that the Inverness facility
will not be involved in this field.
A company spokesman said yesterday: ''We are about to start recruiting
and we want to employ as many people as possible from the Inverness
area.''

''THE crowd'' attending Jessye Norman's recital on July 6 would surely
disagree with Michael Tumelty's criticism of this glorious performance
-- he must indeed be the odd man out.
That this odd man gets privileged space in The Herald seems most
unfair. (I presume he is simply trying to earn his fee by somewhat
pretentious erudition.) On behalf of my fellows in ''the crowd'' I would
like the record to show that the City of Glasgow was indeed privileged
on July 6 to host this triumphant event.
She was wonderful.

TO answer Valerie White's question (July 13) in defence of
private-sector nurseries, it is a majority of parents having used them
who dispute their value.
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council's survey was prepared in
consultation with the Scottish Office Education Department to research
parents' experience of pre-school education and their preferences based
on that experience.
One thousand four hundred questionnaires were distributed randomly in
347 schools throughout Scotland to parents of primary one children; 680
responses met the deadline.
Comparing each person's experience with their current preferences,
full-time local authority nursery schools received a 70% satisfaction
rating, compared to only 33% for the private sector. Half-day provision
scored 64% and 27% respectively.
But concern over nursery vouchers is not simply a debate about the
''wealth of experience'' among private-sector providers. The main
question must be whether the best quality pre-school education will be
available to all children, regardless of their parent's ability to pay.
As trailed by Michael Forsyth's announcement last week, far from
providing an ''equal basis'' of funding, a voucher system could benefit
the better off at the expense of children who are most in need. Its
focus is not children but adults -- providers, parents and a new
bureaucracy. Introducing vouchers at nursery level is also the first
step in extending them to the whole of education, being pivotal to the
market philosophy.
On the bright side, however, at least in Scotland we can expect
imminent public consultation, unlike England, giving Michael Forsyth and
his new Education Minister an early opportunity to put their listening
skills to the test.
A good start would be for them to avoid paraphrasing the Henry Ford
maxim: ''You can have any system you want as long as it's education
vouchers.''

Announcing the ''milestone'', Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of
State at the Scottish Office, said the National Museums of Scotland had
done much to demolish the myth that museums were ''dry, dusty, forbidden
places''.
''The figure raised by July 13 was #5,055,386,'' he said. ''The target
which the Museum Trustees, the Patrons and other volunteers have
undertaken to raise is at least #8m.''
Meanwhile, six winning entries in a competition to find an architect

Only one of the successful entrants is Scottish -- Maclachlan Monaghan

IN his review of the Jessye Norman recital, Michael Tumelty draws
attention to the disruption of meaning, musical flow, and mood, caused
by hand-clapping audiences unused to the song-cycle/song-series format
(July 6).
He also describes the charisma of the lady, who can provoke gush
reactions, diverting attention from the songs to the singer.
Instrumentalists are rarely troubled thus, since little eye-contact is
made.
Warm-hearted Glasgow audiences undoubtedly mean well, and, perhaps not
knowing what to do, feel uncharitable if not acknowledging every dying
fall and cadential top C. Has anyone ever heard an Edinburgh audience
clap too soon?
I am sure all that is required is pointed and prominent guidance at
the top of the programme notes. An over-courteous request will have no
chance of quelling the Glaswegian's determination to join in -- as Ms
Norman discovered. But something reminiscent of our Infants' Mistress
(that lady who shaped us all) just might, viz: Please allow SILENCE to
prevail between these songs.
Audiences traditionally fraternise to within minutes of the hurry
bell, and settle down to browse through their notes only after the music
has begun. So the type-style must be bold, repeated at the top of every
relevant page, and, like the commands we remember from Room One,
coloured red.
Later, words could be replaced by a symbol, or, more excitingly, by an
Italian term, ratified by the Associated Board and Brussels.

Iwas four minutes that shocked the world. Michael Burke's reports for
the BBC on the 1984 Ethiopia famine began in a refugee camp in Korem.
Television conveyed the indescribable. Michael Burke tried, calling it a
''famine of biblical proportions'' but it was the image of the shamed
survivors that haunted Bob Geldof.
Food supplies were shrinking among the thousands of starving, so the
aid agency erected a waist-high wicker fence. The lucky few were fed
with their backs to their countrymen, inside the perimeter. The rest
looked on sure of their fate. In Britain Bob Geldof watched, wept, then
worked hard to help those he could.
Today on BBC2 Live Aid 10th Anniversary will, for the first time,
repeat the musical images Bob Geldof created in order to save lives. It
began with Status Quo turning a song into a description. Rocking All
Over The World was watched by 1.4 billion people in 170 countries. What
followed was truly unforgettable.
''It would probably look more like a concert today than it did then
because I don't believe people were watching the concert,'' says Geldof.
''I believe they were undergoing some kind of experience which I can't
define, and which is not able to be repeated.''
The atmosphere may have evaporated, but the images can be replayed.
There was Wembly and Philidelphia, both packed with people, Freddie
Mercury milking an audience, Sting and George Michael, U2 and The Style
Council, Elvis Costello and Elton John. There were good songs, bad
songs, and the meanings of songs were linked to another continent.
There was The Cars' single Drive with images of dying children while
lead singer Rick Ozabek sang: ''You can't go on/thinking nothing's
wrong''. There was Freddie and Brian May in a caftan sing: ''Is this the
world we created/what did we do it for.'' And then there was Geldof with
The Boomtown Rats.
Geldof said: ''When I stopped in I Don't Like Mondays -- singing 'and
the lesson today is how to die' -- it was because I was adjusting my
emotional flies. I locked in and scrutinised the crowd. And without
getting mystic about it, there was something going on. For that second
there was absolute calm. A connection. It was weird. I'm shivering now
talking about it.''
The experience itself was totally televisual. I remember watching as a
13-year-old when it was announced that more than a billion people would
be watching in more than 100 countries. I tried to imagine what that
would look like. Little boys and girls, grown men and women, sitting
watching, the world united, for once in a common cause.
I got a headache. And then Queen came on, and then Bob Geldof swore
and it was brilliant. Bob Geldof weeping with frustration, shouting:
''F*** the address, send us your money.'' Real drama with no-one
tut-tutting and turning it off. I remember the hassle of everyone in the
family wanting their favourite band recorded and arguing the toss with
my sister who liked U2 and my brother who prefered Paul Young.
The Live Aid concerts raised more than #40m for the Ethiopian people
and as part of the anniversary Bob Geldof returned to the country, for
the first time in 10 years. The journey was as much a respite from the
media attention on his collapsed marriage as that of a returning hero --
which he insists he is not.
He told the Radio Times: ''I loathe and detest aid films. Whitney
wandering through famine-torn Africa holding hands with the little black
babies makes me sick. It's patronising and grotesque.''
On his return, flanked by a documentary film crew, he visited the
areas which were formerly decimated. With pride he saw the roads,
four-wheel-drive vehicles and wells where there once was nothing.
Ten years ago Geldof was critised for using the word ''holocaust'' to
describe the deaths of more than one million people from starvation, as
if the word remained copyright to the Nazis and the Jewish final
solution. But when you consider the images he remembers, the word is
fitting.
''I have this one image in my head of a small boy who had eaten raw
grain because he was starving. He was actually beyond the stage where he
could consume the food and the grain tore his guts out. Literally. His
insides fell out of him. He died right in front of me. I couldn't do
anything. Horrible, horrible.''
This year the cameras also recorded the struggles the country cannot
shake. Ethiopia has chronic unemployment, an epidemic of teenage
pregnancies, and an Aids rate running as high as 24%. BBC2 has used the
Live Aid repeat as the perfect introduction to its African Summer
Season. This is an attempt to understand a continent.
Africa means war and starvation to the average viewer. Yet in the
first of seven-part travel series African Footsteps (BBC2, Thursday)
Antony Sher and his partner, theatre director Greg Dorin, tap into the
mystery of Tangier.
In a bid to explain its attraction they focus on the drug-taking beat
generation of Burroughs, Ginsberg, Leary, and Kerouac.
While on Sunday in The New Map of Africa, leading African figures such
as General Yakuba Gowon, the Nigerian president during the Biafran War
and the Rev Canaan Banana, former president of Zimbabwe, discuss the
problems Africa now faces. Gathered in the game lodge in Harare,
Zimbabwe, they attempt to find solutions to the ethnic and tribal
conflicts and the genocides which follow.
Bob Geldof will not be attending, but he has his own thoughts on
Africa's dilemma. ''I wonder if the whole continent shouldn't ignore the
rest of the world. Create their own internal markets, find a viable
benchmark currency -- probably the South African rand -- and trade among
themselves. That might be ludicrous economics but how else are they
going to get out of this one?''
* IT is said that Mrs Gaddafi, the mother of Libya's leader, was the
finest archer of their Bedouin tribe. Her son, little Muammar was so
deeply influenced by her skill that when he grew up to be a Colonel, he
insisted on female bodyguards. The work of the Jamahiryan Guard, and the
ambiguous attitudes of their charge, is profiled in a disturbing
documentary. Witness: For The Love Of The Leader, (Channel 4, Tuesday)
travels to the Tris Girl's Military Academy, the only female officer
school in the Islamic world.
Teenage recruits are drawn from right across Libya but entry is
dependent on a ''certificate of morality'', issued by a neighbourhood
popular committee that attests to their purity and ideological
correctness. His corps of Revolutionary Nuns also disseminate Gadaffi's
ideas and recruit for the academy.
Though invited by Gaddafi to profile their work, relationships between
the camera crews and the academy's staff started to strain as the crew
attempted to pierce the surface of the women's devotion and present a
true portrait of their roles and, more importantly, their rights.
* WILL they or won't? That is the question. Well, it's not the
question, but Bill Shakespeare didn't write situation comedies, no
matter what academic lovers of Much Ado About Nothing say about his
common touch and his audience of ordinary men. No, the question is posed
by the authors of Moving Story (ITV, Tuesday) about two virginities,
hanging in the balance.
As the comedy, that is life at Elite Removals, returns for a second
series, Asif (Ronny Jhutti) is considering losing the big V to Kalsoom
(Meera Devon), whom I'm sure he loves very much. But such a moral and
personal dilemma will not move the furniture. Ever since Laurel and
Hardy wrang laughter from a hill and a piano, removal men have been
granted a comedy licence. In fact Bamber (Warren Clarke) resembles
Oliver Hardy with his bowler hat and spotless white gloves.
Moving Story is written by a team of four writers. Although
Shakespeare alone wrote 37 plays and acres of sonnets, today's writers
like their weekends off. Yet there remains similarities between
Shakespeare's Macbeth and Hamlet and Bamber as Warren Clarke,
unwittingly testified.
''Bamber throws names of great philosophers in a hat, mixes them up
with famous quotations and uses them together in sentences that sound
wonderful -- but don't mean a thing. It's a lot harder to learn lines
that don't make sense, but I'd rather have that, than Bamber talking
like a brain of Britain.''
* IN Married . . . With Children (STV, Thursday) the Bundy's continue
to deliver the arsenic antidote to the saccharine sweetness of The Cosby
Show. But what else is expected from the sitcom family named after
America's most famous serial killer? Milk and cookies? Naw! Ted would be
proud of how Al, Peg, and the kids turned out.
In this week's episode greed truly is good as the family dog
mistakenly receives a credit card, launching the group on a spending
spree with the usual consequences..

ERIC Cullen was released from Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison yesterday
after serving two weeks of a nine-month sentence for having indecent
videos and photographs involving children.
The actor, who played Wee Burney in the Rab C Nesbitt TV series, has
been granted interim liberation, pending an appeal over his sentence.
''I'm a bit shattered,'' he said in a quiet voice. ''I'd like to
sleep, and I'd like a bath.''
He said that his time in prison had been traumatic. ''I'm really glad
to be out. It was very lonely and I'm glad to be back with my friends
now.''
Cullen was driven out of Barlinnie by friends. They had brought with
them his three-legged dog, Becky, which he cuddled in the back seat of
the car driven by Caroline McFarlan, wife of television presenter Bill
McFarlan.
The McFarlans have stood by Cullen during his ordeal, claiming he is a
victim who has been cruelly used by other people, and should never have
been jailed.
He was taken to the McFarlans' house in Whitecraigs, on the outskirts
of Glasgow, where the couple's three children had a birthday cake
waiting for him. Cullen, who is 4ft 4in tall, turned 30 while in jail.
A family friend said: ''The children just charged out and covered him
with hugs and kisses. The McFarlans would just like to thank the many
hundreds of good, decent people who wrote letters of support.''
She added: ''When the rain came on, he just dived out the back door
and just stayed in the rain. He was looking at the sky saying 'It's good
to feel rain again.' ''
Friends and campaigners have described the sentence imposed on the
actor as inhumane. They claim that he had been a victim of sex abuse
since his early teens, and had been forced into storing the indecent
material at his house by a paedophile.
They allege that the authorities prosecuted him only because they
feared criticism if they dropped the charges against someone who was so
much in the public eye.
During his fortnight in prison, the actor was kept alone in a suicide
observation suite where there are no materials with which a prisoner
could harm himself, and where prison officers check every 15 minutes on
his condition.
It was said at the time of his court appearance that he was suffering
from severe depression.

A WEEK may be a long time in politics, as Harold Wilson once shrewdly
observed, but a decade is certainly a long time in social history. Our
memories have been jogged this week that 10 years has elapsed since Live
Aid, and the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior. As recent events have
reminded us, both incidents failed to change the world -- the famines
and massacres in Africa have not abated, nor the French appetite for
setting off atom bombs in Pacific atolls.
A third (and much less important event) happened in July 1985. My book
Religion Inc (an expose of the Church of Scientology) appeared, a few
months after the death of the cult's founder, L Ron Hubbard. Naively, I
assumed once the true facts of the cult were widely known, and without
the scheming Hubbard at the helm, the cult would shrivel and die. Alas,
I was wrong.
My book did not appear in paperback because the cult threatened to sue
and the publisher which had signed it up took cold feet. Another book
appeared about Hubbard and its author suffered considerable harassment.
No action was taken against the cultists who hid their nefarious
activities behind the cloak of freedom of religion.
Since then I have had little or nothing to do with the cult. However,
of late it seems to be enjoying a resurgence. I have recently come
across several instances of young people being persuaded into signing
away their money and their lives to these religious highwaymen. This
week ITV networked a documentary which showed the leopard has not
changed its spots and has devoured many more victims in the decade which
has passed since Hubbard's death. Although the EU has recommended that
independent bodies be set up to monitor the activities of new religious
movements -- and Germany, Denmark, and France have moved within the past
year to revoke Scientology's religious status and treat it like a
business for fiscal purposes -- in the UK it still operates with
impunity despite the fact that in 1984 an English judge described it as
''immoral and socially obnoxious''.
Following this week's programme, families of cult members and
ex-Scientologists are promoting a petition to the Home Secretary which
calls for a full Government inquiry into its activities and
''religious'' status. I wish them luck. Later this year I am involved in
a conference on cults at Carberry Tower and would be pleased to forward
further information to anyone who is interested, especially those with
an inside story to tell. However, my reason for raising this topic is
not to deal with Scientology.
It is to point out that something has happened in those 10 years since
1985. Socially obnoxious people or incidents which aroused a public
outcry seem to flourish and nothing happens. No sanctions, no interdict,
no action. There appears to be a new climate towards such people and
events which is a strange mixture of apathy, weariness, and tolerance.
Whatever its origin, its result is to create a new atmosphere of
powerlessness which is to the detriment of most people. They lack
optimism that problems will be solved, and they lack faith that justice
will be done.
When the Rainbow Warrior I was sunk by the French Secret Service and a
crew member killed, the denials flew thick and fast that the action was
officially sanctioned. Subsequent events have shown that this was a pack
of lies and one of the perpetrators has now been given promotion. It is
incidents like this which destroy the faith of people that honour will
be upheld by those who govern, and they contribute to a climate of
distrust.
Our inability to deal with ''socially obnoxious'' people on our own
doorstep is another case in point. Whether it is under-age rapists, too
young to be named but strong enough to inflict injury, or anti-social
families who terrorise their neighbourhood, we seem to be able to do
nothing.
Don't imagine it is all exaggerated by the media. Just talk to anyone
who works in urban areas. An area I know has just said farewell to a
family in which the father was employed to look after elderly people but
who spent most of his time in the bookies and whose sons were the area's
biggest bully boys. The length of time it took for action to be taken
left everyone feeling that all the effort was being put on the side of
perpetrators.
And did you see the golden girl wife of the English speculator who
lost the billions in Singapore bleating that the British Government
should intervene to prevent his extradition to stand trial?
On a grander scale we have the famine in Africa which Live Aid set out
to address. It was a wonderful ideal, but the reality of the decade has
been that those with power and money in the most needy parts of Africa
seem to want to spend it on guns rather than social programmes. The
former Yugoslavia is another example of those who seem to prefer war to
the price of peace. We are waking up to the realisation that
establishing peace and justice means sacrificing one, if not both, of
these ideals.
It adds up to a picture of a world in which freedoms are being abused
and we are increasingly powerless to influence the process. I believe
the answer is not more government intervention, nor more laws, but the
establishment of a moral climate in which people do not feel free to get
away with false religion, nuclear pollution, or genocide.
Of course it will require action by politicians and legal authorities,
but they will only do so if driven by a desire for justice by people
themselves. We have the laws, we have the mechanism to right wrongs, but
in 10 years we seem to have lost a desire for justice.

I would like to make two points in reply to the Rev William McMillan's
letter (July 8).
My reference to God's unconditional love surely cannot be suspect.
Certainly it is not conditional on our goodness but nor does it exclude
those (the majority of the world's population) who do not believe in the
Bible. Everyone qualifies for God's love, not only those who accept
Jesus Christ as their saviour.
As for reading St Paul's letters, I simply do not accept that the
Bible is the only holy book. I would as soon read from the Torah, the
loving Vedic literature, the beautiful Buddhist scriptures or even my
own Spiritualist principles -- the first being the Fatherhood of God and
the second the Brotherhood of Man, which brings us right back to God's
unconditional love to us and through us to each other. Can this be
suspect?
My other point is that (as I said previously) if we all led our lives
with our own unconditional love to the best of our ability, surely that
would be exactly the way God would want us to live our lives
irrespective of religion, creed, or dogma.

IN response to Margaret McCormick's letter (July 12) I would make the
point that any claim under any insurance policy is subject to agreement
by the insurance companies.
It is only fair that they are allowed to review the basis of any claim
as any change in a person's circumstances from those at the time of the
policy being agreed could place the company at a disadvantage and thus
result in increased premiums.
I do sympathise with those whose claims are not met and fully agree
that at the time any insurance policy is taken out the person insured
must be made fully aware of the terms of the cover, but more importantly
it is imperative that any change to personal circumstances is advised to
the insurance company Immediately to check whether cover will still be
provided under a particular policy.
In the area of mortgage providers it is essential that the full terms
of mortgage protection are provided in writing before a mortgage is
agreed to ensure that the borrower understands the terms of cover and
wishes to proceed.
I am sure that the insurance companies are already looking at the
question of short-term contracts but it is also possible that even now
cover can be agreed depending on someone's employment history.
It should also be noted that claims under the DSS scheme are not
always agreed either and the payment will not cover insurance premiums
which may leave someone without life cover or buildings and contents
cover, whereas under a personal scheme these can be included in the
cover.
Turning now to Mr Corbett's letter (July 12), he himself confirms that
there would be an increase in public expenditure, namely #580m, but to
balance the books includes the suggestion of the withdrawal of MIRAS
which I would be totally opposed to and would in fact wish to extend it
to #40,000 for first-time buyers and back to the 25% for all, which will
help the housing market and reduce unemployment.
I cannot agree that there would be a net increase in jobs if there
were a large council house-building programme because if there is less
private house building due to the Labour Party's negative attitude to
private house-owners the number of people who currently work in this
area would reduce which in turn would effect other areas, with no change
in the total unemployed.

THERE are politicians who believe in the grand gesture and then live
with the consequences because of the short-term gains. They issue a
sweeping political statement which has an immediate beneficial impact,
and ignore the long-term difficulties it raises. Malcolm Rifkind is not
such a politician, will not be that kind of Foreign Secretary, could not
live with that approach to policy. The ''safe havens'' policy in Bosnia
is a case in point. He has always been sceptical about the chances of
the safe havens working. In his view the member states of the United
Nations made a grand declaration of policy without first giving the UN
the resources to implement it. The rapid reaction force has come into
being far too late. The Foreign Secretary believes the UN must not be
pushed into declarations of policy it cannot deliver, and the criticism
it has received because of the subsequent failure of such policies is
grossly unfair. It is not the fault of the UN as an organisation. He has
a point. It should be judged by its other achievements in Bosnia and
elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia, achievements in those areas which
fell within its competence. The situation in central Bosnia, for
instance, has improved out of all recognition over the past 18 months.
The 15 front lines which bedevilled the area are no more. Flak jackets
are no longer de rigueur, armoured vehicles not the only possible means
of transport for visiting politicians. The civilian population is
leading a normal existence.
Whatever else happens in the next few days as the safe havens meet
their fate there is no question of UN troops coming to their rescue.
Wisely. We will not be going to war, whatever the Serbs get up to, in
the former Yugoslavia. All diplomatic means will be exerted to protect
the safe havens, but if these efforts fail then it is not part of
British policy to dispatch an army to fight the Serbs, the rather
belligerent recent utterances of President Chirac apart. It is too early
to judge the new French President, but it is already clear he is a man
who shoots from the hip, someone whose words are not always followed by
deeds even although the words are sincere. The rhetoric is one thing,
the policy another. The thing to do now, as the Foreign Secretary has
done, is ask for the detailed proposals the French have to help the
enclaves, because as far as Britain is concerned the necessary military
resources are not on the ground.
If the arms embargo is lifted by the United States then the UN would
not remain, but otherwise it is there to stay. Withdrawal is not an
option. The Foreign Secretary believes the net effect of its presence is
beneficial, and that those who assume the UN could pull out and that
would be the end of the matter are wrong. We will be involved, one way
or another, in Bosnia until there is a stable political settlement, and
we could not wash our hands of the problem even if we did take our
troops out.

THE answer given to your reader by the Personal Finance team about
buildings insurance is nonsense (July 8).
Having been down that road they suggest, I can tell your reader that
insurance on buildings is based on full house value.
Producing a professional rebuilding valuation, as suggested by the
finance team, would make no difference. This I know from my answers from
more than one insurance company on different properties.
Insurance companies will tell you that even if you suggest, as I did,
that a maximum claim clause be included any future claim would be
reduced for under-insurance.
So your finance team's answer is fundamentally doomed to failure and
would just waste your reader's time and money.
Insurance companies argue that all premiums are based on full
valuation including site values. A reduction, they say, would result in
across-the-board rate rises.
I would, however, very much like to be proved wrong and have your team
get my insurance based on rebuilding costs without penalty.
Come on team, prove me wrong, please!

IN the recent correspondence criticising clergy selection, the two
protagonists were on the one hand the assessment committee and, on the
other, those applicants who were rejected for one reason or another. I
believe there is also a third party, namely the Church of Scotland
members who pay for the whole business.
Is the laity being well served? Effective assessors should produce a
consistent supply of high-performing clergy. There is an abundant supply
of applicants for what is, in contemporary terms, a secure and
comfortable job. What are the observed results?
Certainly in the past clergy were consistently good preachers and
pastoral counsellors. They were sound scholars, if a touch snobbish here
and there. It is my experience that the contemporary scene exhibits
constrasting clergy -- some performing conscientiously and well while
others should obviously have been rejected by any assessment process
worthy of the name.
So Iain Galbraith (July 8) and Christine Maxwell (July 12) probably
have cases to be answered. The Rev Evie Young and colleagues likewise.

K A SUTHERLAND forecasts a ''bleak future for Scottish railways''
(June 29). Rail was the accepted transport for the majority in the early
twentieth century, but will be superseded by road in the 21st.
The future of rail surely lies in the rapid transport of large numbers
of commuters into city centres, long-distance full train-loads of
suitable freight, and a few fast Inter-City services able to compete
with air lines.
Industry, commerce, and the public at large demand real reduction in
oppressive taxation, which means cuts in public expenditure. Mr Lang, on
behalf of the taxpayer, is right to pay high regard to
cost-effectiveness.
Discredited Strathclyde region (how glad we will be to see its demise)
openly states that fares on Strathclyde Transport would double without
the #91m a year subsidy from the region. Since only about 7% of
passengers travel by rail, why should 93% be expected to carry this
massive burden, much of it through road taxation? A subsidy of #2.1
billion was given to BR last year -- the highest ever -- equal to 1p on
income tax.
Park and Ride commuters, say on the Ayr/Glasgow route, enjoy an
enormous advantage in being conveyed comfortably into the heart of
cities without stress, let, or hindrance. Why should they not pay the
full economic cost? Why expect to be subsidised by other travellers?
Mr Sutherland is right to seek full electrification of the
Glasgow/Edinburgh line. Equally I would plead for the upgrading of the
A8/M8 to full three-lane motorway.
To compete with the airlines it should be possible to run a very fast
(SGV) service from Glasgow/Edinburgh to London via the East Coast line.
Given this fast line, it would hardly seem justified to upgrade the
tortuous section over Shap on the west coast line against the competing
claims of education and health on the public purse.
If a private operator can see a return on the capital, so be it.

THE latest sporting initiative by the Prime Minister deserves a warm
welcome. It ought to strike a chord in many minds, for unease about our
poor performance in international sporting events has been widespread;
and worries about the decline of sporting and athletic activities in
schools are often expressed in conjunction with doubts about the fitness
of today's children and young adults. Certainly the past two decades
have not been good for our sporting life, though we should not damage
the prospects of the Prime Minister's changes by engaging in
recriminations. What matters is reform, and it is important that the
main agency to promote it will not be an agency of state. The strategy
of trying to link school activity with independently organised local
sporting and athletic bodies is also vital: this country, most
unusually, has a web of voluntary sporting agencies and associations
(often small and quite local in their operations) which can be exploited
for an even wider good than that achieved by its present users.
Schools seem to be a crucial focus of the new departure. They once did
provide considerable scope for sporting activities which were often
managed voluntarily by teachers. Many teachers came to feel that their
games and athletic efforts were taken for granted. (Other teachers, but
only a minority, espoused anti-competitive notions which were hostile to
team games altogether.) If they are to be coaxed back into anything like
their old role, provision must be made for their payment: the
administrative burdens of today's schools leave teachers with far less
free time and energy than was once the case. Money too will be required
to re-establish playing fields which many schools sold, since their use,
given the earlier climate, was so minimal.
Actually, money ought to be available for such purposes since #100m
will come from the National Lottery. That body is itself a source of
some concern, something which attaches to some of its funding
disbursements as well. In this case there is every reason to welcome the
targets of its spending for it will be putting back much of its largesse
in the areas from which it originally came, which can hardly be said of
many of the big, more publicised, donations made so far.

A MISSING person report filed by a husband anxious about his wife
uncovered the shocking truth: the ''wife'' was actually a man who is
accused of taking the husband for up to #25,000 during their
three-and-a-half-year marriage.
Felix Urioste is in jail on #12,500 bail on fraud charges, and Bruce
Jensen is confused, embarrassed, and broke.
Jensen told police in Bountiful, Utah, that he did not know his wife
was a man until officers convinced him.
''I feel pretty stupid,'' Jensen, 39, told the Standard-Examiner of
Ogden.
The deception unravelled when Urioste, 34, was arrested in Las Vegas
for using 33 credit cards obtained fraudulently. At the time, Urioste
was travelling as a bearded man.
Prosecutor Bill McGuire said Jensen was ''just incredibly naive''.
Authorities said Urioste was able to pull off the deception because he
looked like a woman and because Jensen never saw him naked.
The couple were married when Urioste told Jensen he was pregnant with
twins after a single sexual encounter in 1991, McGuire said. The
prosecutor said Jensen married Urioste out of a sense of responsibility,
and the marriage was basically celibate.
Several months after the marriage, Urioste told him the twins were
stillborn and also falsely claimed he had cancer.
Jensen is seeking an annulment, citing irreconcilable
differences.--AP.

Escaping to log cabins, lighthouses and private villas on holiday can
offer freedom and less strain on your budget if money is tight. Jill
Crawshaw gives a comprehensive guide to self-catering get-aways
Olu Deniz has a great golden crescent that shelves gently into the
warm turquoise water
IT was the unpredictable appetite and unstable table manners of our
first child that converted our own family to the freedom of
self-catering, liberating us from so-called ''international menus'' and
the tyranny of head waiters.
Since then we've tracked down an amazing collection of holiday
villages and country cottages, log cabins, luxury villas and
lighthouses, water mills and palazzos, some conveniently packaged by
British firms with flights and self-drive cars, or ferry fares included.
Perhaps because of the variety of holidays, the freedom, and the
flexibility they offer, self-catering holidays now represent more than
half the holidays taken, pushing hotels and catered accommodation into
second place -- but because in some cases inspection and regulation of
properties can be less rigorous than other vacations, and standards do
vary, it's as well to do as much homework as possible before filling in
the booking form.
A self-catering holiday may not be a cheaper option than those
offering full or half-board. And since you spend more money locally,
exchange rates can affect the final cost; the pound stretches further
this year in Turkey and Greece, but eating, drinking, and stocking the
larder in France, Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavia will bruise the
most resilient holiday budget.
* Family beat
WITH its 100 beaches and breezy climate, dry-stone walls, and little
white cubist villas with Ideal Home patios and arches, and
oh-so-convenient modern plumbing, and kitchens, Minorca is a family
do-it-yourself holiday island par excellence. And there is a fascinating
culture and history stretching back to about 4000 BC, when mysterious
invaders left strange stone dwellings on the island, up to the more
recent eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when the French and English
scrapped over one of the finest deep water harbours in the
Mediterranean.
Which Minorcan resort to choose?
For the best beaches, Cala Galdana, Santo Tomas and Arenal (not to be
confused with the Majorcan resort of the same name), where there is a
selection of villas and apartments. Binibeca Vell is a highly
picturesque and delightful purpose-built fishing village, but the
apartments are too close together, and the beach pocket-sized.
There are family apartments too at the genuine and rather
sophisticated fishing village of Fornells, where Spain's King Juan
Carlos sails.
But holidaymakers don't need to stay in a resort -- there are
individual villas dotted all over the island, but you will need a car to
reach the beaches, shops and towns. Cars are often included in the
overall price of the holiday. Firms with a range of properties in
Minorca include: Thomson Holidays (0161 911 9000), Panorama (01273
206531), The Travel Club of Upminster (01708 225000). Sample price: 14
nights at the Sa Mirada Apartments, Arenal d'en Castell, from
#261--#447. Two weeks at the Anabel Apartments, Cala Galdana, where
there is a free Big T Club for children, and regular entertainment, from
#298--#531, both from Glasgow, from Thomson Holidays. Car hire costs
approximately #75 for three days, #145 for a week.
* Turkish rarebit
HOLIDAY flats and villas are still rare finds in Turkey, but the
combination of stupendous beaches, healthy, and delicious eating based
on fresh fish, lamb, vegetables, fruit, honey and yoghurt, and low
prices make it ideal for those with a taste for something different in a
self-catering holiday.
The best beach, one of the most breathtaking in the Mediterranean, is
Olu Deniz, with a great golden crescent that shelves gently into the
warm turquoise water, with enough trees for shade, and no monster hotels
with all-night discos. Specialists Simply Turkey's (0181 747 1011)
holiday village at Ocakkoy, up in the hills overlooking the magical
coast, has a free mini-bus service to Olu Deniz. The place consists of
old but well-restored stone houses, furnished with traditional divans
and kilims.
A villa sleeping four people in peak season with flights from
Manchester and London costs from #398 for one week, #477 for a
fortnight.
Thomson Holidays offer the Gokcen Apartment four miles from Olu Deniz
from #357 for two weeks, with flights from Glasgow. The simply-furnished
apartments belong to the family who also run the small hotel with a
pool.
* High rise luxury
THE first glimpse of the high-rise towers of Sarasota's Longboat Key
Club utterly belies its facilities -- no less than 18 tennis courts with
resident professional, championship golf courses, nature trails, jogging
track and 12 miles of talcum powder sand for shell gathering, pelican
watching and bathing.
But it is the condominiums which dazzle -- huge bedrooms with
emperor-sized beds, bathrooms almost as large, and a huge television set
in every room (a smaller one in the kitchen), though the one in our
bedroom was so discreetly hidden behind a teak cupboard that we only
discovered it on the final day.
Children between the ages of five to 12 are looked after in an
activity club free of charge. Sarasota is one of the most attractive
Gulf Coast resorts, about 90 minutes from Tampa airport, or three from
Orlando. These holidays can be combined with other Florida destinations.
One week costs approximately #800: it makes more sense to add at least a
second week at a different destination -- add about #200--#300. Kuoni
(01306 742222), and there are supplements of between #30--#138 from
Glasgow.
* Lighthouse
THE lighthouse for holiday hire on Norway's Vik Island can only be
reached by rowing boat, which comes as part of this escapist package.
Built in 1875, the lighthouse has been modernised, while keeping its
traditional character -- civilisation is about 400 yards away in the
fishing village of Skundeneshavn, an eighteenth and nineteenth-century
centre of the herring industry.
The lighthouse sleeps up to seven, costs from #399--#471 each for a
party of two for seven nights, and #69--#159 for each extra adult.
Children aged under four go free, and those aged four to 16 cost
#30--90. These prices include ferry fares for cars and passengers
between Newcastle and Bergen.
Inntravel (01653 628811) also have a selection of cottages and harbour
houses in the Lofoten Islands and Hardanger Fjord in Norway, and
self-catering farmhouses in traditional working villages in Austria and
Switzerland.
* Chateaux and palazzos
IT is possible to rent studios, apartments, turrets, whole floors or
other bits of chateaux from various companies, but if you want to play
seigneur over your own domain, two firms offer the complete shooting
match for hire.
In the Dordogne, Lot and Tarn, villa specialists Meon Travel (01730
266561) have a range of small private manor houses: the Chateau de
Roucaudon for example, near Les Eyzies, dates back to 1609, has a small
trout fishing river flowing through its 17 hectares of grounds, the
river Vezere close by for swimming and canoeing, a pool, and an
antique-strewn interior. The Chateau, which is unsuitable for children
under 10 costs from #2358--#3419 for a week, including ferry crossing
for a car and up to five passengers.
A typical example: The Chateau de Bois Girand sleeping 14 costs a
total of #2330--#2895 for a week, excluding fares which can be booked
through the company. They can also offer palazzos, luxury villas and
castles in Italy, many of them in such delectable areas as Rome,
Florence, Venice and Siena.
One property that's rather special is the only house on the island of
Torcello in the Venetian lagoon, furnished with fine antiques and
surrounded by beautiful gardens. A maid helps out, plus a butler who is
also the villa's boat driver. The cost of the house, which can sleep up
to 12, is from about #560 per person per week. It can be hired with or
without flights.
* Agrotourism
A NUMBER of conservation schemes run by local communities or national
governments are proving a successful way to preserve village life, and
encourage visitors to join in.
In the Sierras of Spain in Andalucia, in the pueblo blancos such as
Algtocin, Guacin or Benalauria, a number of cottages and farmhouses have
been modernised with kitchens and bathrooms, simply furnished, and are
available in the heart of these dazzling little white towns at an
average of #10--#15 per person per night -- though some have a minimum
rental of six nights' stay. They can be booked through Rural Andalus
(0034 5227 6229).
In Greece, ''Traditional Settlements'' provide holiday accommodation
in a variety of restored mansions and forts across the country and on
the islands, some basic, others comfortable rather than luxuriously
furnished. You pay between #10--#30 a night per person. A leaflet giving
details is available from the Greek National Tourist Office, 4 Conduit
Street, London W1R 0DJ, (0171 734 5997).
You can also rent village houses as part of a self-catering package
from Sunvil Travel (0181 568 4499) on the west of the island of Crete at
Spilia, near Chania. A week's self-catering costs #430--#460 per person
including flights and car hire, and the week can be combined with
another type of holiday in Crete.
The French Gites have been modernised and marketed with government
help for 40 years. The largest Gite operator in Britain, Gites de France
(0171 493 3480) has 2000 cottages, houses, converted barns and
farmhouses, all in rural locations in its directory.
Gites are normally graded from one to four epis or grains of corn, and
prices are reasonable -- from as little as #100 a week for four in low
season in lesser known areas, rising to about #750--#800 for larger
properties in popular spots in high season. These Gites may be booked
separately, or as part of a package. There is a #3 membership fee.
* Interesting Iberia
AWAY from the pop spots, Individual Travellers Spain &amp; Portugal (01798
869416) offers independently minded travellers a mouth-watering
selection of converted windmills and village houses, mountain retreats
and traditional farmhouses in less commercialised Iberia.
A renovated farmhouse in the Montanhas region of Portugal for example,
surrounded by vineyards, with views across the Douro Valley (famous for
its port production) with a pool and large courtyard costs #2074 for a
fortnight for six people in high season. On the Costa Lisbao, near the
twelfth-century Palmela Castle, four people can share a windmill with
circular rooms, a woodburning stove and striking views of the Arrabida
National Park, the beaches of Troia and the Atlantic. The price is
#736--#948 for two weeks for the property, which includes either car
rental, or the short sea ferry crossing. Flights from Scotland can also
be booked.
In Spain's Cataluna a farmhouse believed to be 1000-years-old, near
the town of Tremp, and set on a rocky outcrop among lakes and mountains
in a region rich in Romanesque art and birdlife, costs #630--#1056 for
six people in search of peace and quiet. Only five families live in the
village permanently, and the house can only be reached by a footpath.

THE new bridge at Kyleakin, which opened yesterday, restored Skye's
link with the mainland from which it has been detached since before the
first human settlers reached the West of Scotland thousands of years
ago. In some ways the change is symbolic, for an efficient ferry service
has maintained the connection even for large vehicles in modern times,
and it is a long time since the ferry was propelled by oarsmen. There is
no doubting that the change will greatly boost the number of cars and
tourists visiting Skye. The local economy ought to receive an additional
stimulus as well, though some places, notably Kyleakin itself, might
suffer from being by-passed. Local opinion was always aware of the cons
as well as the pros of any bridge, which probably would not have been
built had that opinion been decisive.
Something will be lost by the end of isolation and its romantic
associations with the past, with the escaping Bonnie Prince Charlie and
his protecting Flora Macdonald, immortalised, if long after the event,
in the famous song, Over the Sea to Skye. The sea passage essential to
that experience and recreated in many minds by the ferry may not be lost
entirely, for local efforts may re-establish a service and ignore the
bridge which has the drawback of a toll which matches the cost of the
ferry it replaces. If such a new venture proves to be viable without
public subsidy no-one will gainsay its own romantic impulse.
The harsh, compelling, and unique landscape of south-western Skye may
find new votaries. The West Highlands in general exert a powerful
magnetism on the products of the crowded urban society of southern
Britain and of Europe beyond. That is progress, but if the melancholy
strain of the Gaelic temperament sheds a tear at yesterday's event it
may be more widely shared than admitted.

Sarajevo, Friday
HUMAN tragedy on a massive scale was unfolding in Bosnia tonight as
thousands of Muslim refugees fled the captured ''safe area'' of
Srebrenica.
Streams of evacuees, mostly women, children, and elderly men, arrived
at a makeshift tent city at the UN airbase in Tuzla, creating one of the
worst refugee crises of the war in Bosnia.
The grotesque reality of the refugees' misery was grimly illustrated
by the discovery of a woman who hanged herself from a tree in despair.
The woman, apparently in her early 20s, was found hanging from a torn
blanket, her bare feet dangling about 3ft from the ground.
Most refugees fear they will never see their menfolk again, expecting
the Bosnian Serbs to execute their policy of ''ethnic cleansing'' in
brutal fashion.
Stories circulating among the refugees -- which the UN was unable to
verify -- spoke of men being murdered and young women abducted and raped
by Serb troops.
Bewildered and terrified refugees were too traumatised even to speak
to their fellow-Muslims about their ordeal, said Anne-Marie Huby of
Medecins Sans Frontieres.
''These people are already survivors of earlier waves of ethnic
cleansing in 1992 and 1993,'' she said.
''They really thought, when they saw the Serbs come in this time, that
it was their last hour. Our aid workers say people are absolutely
convinced they will not see their men again.''
Aid workers described the camp at Tuzla, where up to 20,000 refugees
have already gathered, as totally unsuitable for the purpose.
Water and military ration packs were distributed to the refugees, but
aid workers warned of serious health risks unless shelter and sanitation
were improved.
They said that diarrhoea could become endemic within days as the camp
has virtually no toilets.
Vulnerable refugees, weakened by months of starvation rations in
Srebrenica followed by an exhausting forced march in scorching heat away
from the former safe haven, could die in large numbers.
Thousands spent last night sleeping rough and have no daytime shelter
from the strong winds and blistering sun, leading to fears of mass
dehydration and heat exhaustion.
Britain's Overseas Development Administration announced tonight that
800 tents, enough to shelter 6400 refugees, were being flown out to
Tuzla tomorrow at the request of the Red Cross.
Bosnian Government authorities in Tuzla, outraged at the UN's failure
to maintain the safe haven in Srebrenica, are refusing to allow refugees
into public buildings in the town, which is already home to almost
200,000 displaced people.
Oxfam aid workers have reported a number of deaths, several of them
small children, and the charity's spokeswoman Sheila Young forecast many
more if sanitation is not rapidly improved.
Oxfam has already distributed #50,000-worth of clothing and tents to
the Tuzla refugees, and a charter plane is to fly from Britain on Monday
carrying a further #100,000-worth.
However they fear that, as further safe havens fall, the disaster will
become too great for aid organisations to cope with.
The Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Siladjdzic, insisted today that
massive atrocities were being carried out by Bosnian Serb troops.
''Massive massacres were committed by Serbian terrorists upon the
civilians of Srebrenica,'' he said.
''There are hundreds of witnesses that arrived yesterday to Tuzla,
speaking of horrendous crimes there; hundreds of bodies, naked, stabbed,
and killed by Serb terrorists.''
He described the Western governments as ''accomplices'' to an act of
genocide, because of their refusal to allow arms to be supplied to the
former Yugoslavia.

SCHEDULING is an art, or so the people who decide which abysmal old
British movie absolutely must be shown at 9.30 on a Monday morning would
have you believe. With the sublime intuition of the truly creative they
just know that you run, say, The Beechgrove Garden against The Bill,
that you build a day-time audience by moving -- marvel at the logic --
from the Pink Panther to the Third Test, Neighbours, and The Rockford
Files. If scheduling is an art, you're reading a column by Marcel
Proust.
In summer, however, most of this pretension evaporates. Scheduling for
the summer months means sport, something for the kids, a few
documentaries, and as much old rubbish as you can get away with. While
the BBC claims to have reduced ruthlessly the number of repeats --
''classics'' as we must learn to call them -- experience suggests that
while the other three seasons have improved, summer is as bad as ever.
If the days seem longer that's just because you're watching Zulu (BBC2,
Sunday) or Inspector Morse (ITV, Wednesday) yet again.
Even when something new pops up, the gods of scheduling are
capricious. Having at last found something else for Jeremy Paxman to do,
for example, the wizards at the Beeb saw fit to run You Decide -- With
Paxman (BBC1, Tuesday) directly opposite Newsnight (BBC2). Presumably
this is what they mean by extending choice.
As it turned out, Paxo has no cause as yet to give up the night job.
Plugged as an opportunity for you, the ordinary and habitually
disenfranchised viewer, to have your say on an issue of the week, this
is in fact just another phone-in, distinguished only from Talkback
(BBC1, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) by the fact that Paxman rather
than his Newsnight colleague Sue Cameron is in charge.
The gimmick of You Decide -- and a pretty lame one it is -- is that
our hero plays devil's advocate, taking a contrary line to whatever
heartfelt opinions the viewers happen to have stumbled across. So, one
is obliged to say, what? Presenting Paxman as the devil's advocate is
about as original as presenting Wogan as a smirking buffoon. Satanic
advocacy is Paxman's metier, his reason for being, journalism as he
lives and breathes it. Otherwise this is just that old TV favourite: a
radio show in disguise.
The second part of Barnardo's Children (BBC1, Tuesday) was as
heart-breaking as the first. What is it about the faces of children that
makes them so eloquent? How do old photographs and film preserve sadness
intact for decades, as though grief were a quality somehow captured in
the emulsion? This week we heard of the thousands of children -- think
of that --  who grew up with the mistaken belief that they were orphans.
Adult or aged now, they expressed everything by their inarticulacy,
conveyed in their own incomprehension of how a determined effort to do
good could cause so much harm.
If this series wins no prizes there is truly no justice.
Shopping: The Supermarket (BBC2, Monday) will probably win a year's
supply of soap powder from the industry, if only because it encourages
the British obsession with pushing a trolley around aimlessly on Sunday
afternoons. Nevertheless, it told its weird, thoroughly modern story of
consumerism with a great deal of panache and quite a bit of humour.
Here was history as we lived it in the American century. Not the great
victories of wars and science but the triumphs of packaging, malls,
Green Shield stamps, and Co-op divvies. This was America's contribution
to civilisation in all its rapacious innocence -- the TV dinners, the
homogenised snacks, the shrink-wrapped psyches -- that attracted, and
still attracts, more genuine ingenuity than was ever expended on
society's ills.
Gunter Grass used to claim that the arrival of the potato made more
impact on European history than the Hundred Years' War. What will our
children's children make of family-sized packs of frozen breaded-chicken
bits? Travels With My Camera (Channel 4, Monday) was one of those ideas
that was always likely to work. Simple, really: give cameras to
talkative reporters and let them go, in this case to what Reggy Nadelson
called Bomb Country, the secret state of the nuclear age.
Driving 1300 miles from New Mexico to Wyoming this self-proclaimed
Greenwich leftie found herself in surreal nuclear theme parks,
picnicking at the site of the first bomb test, wandering through the
ghost town of old Los Alamos, where it all began, and chatting with
Edward Teller, Dr Strangelove himself, the father of the hydrogen bomb.
If the film had a fault it was, perhaps, the implicit belief that the
nuclear age is at a close. We saw old men and old women, the pioneers,
and the detritus of the wholly futile, entirely evil work on which they
innocently (in most cases) expended their lives, not the industry which
continues to prosper. Most chilling of all was Teller himself, with a
face as old as human stupidity, a brilliant scientist still failing to
solve the compassion problem. Until his appearance Nadelson's film had
been almost jaunty; suddenly there was a shadow across the sun, a stain
on the screen.
Some stories can't be told often enough.
''Ha ha bloody ha,'' said putty-faced Bob for the first time ever
while his feral friend Terry smirked like a whippet winning at 20 to
one. Is this (The Likely Lads, BBC2, Thursday) really the way we were?
Was it only 30 years ago? Never mind whatever happened to the lads,
whatever happened to the world they inhabited? All gone.
Comedy is like that. Its tiny details -- those suits, those streets,
those haircuts -- make better social history than most of the more sober
studies. This rerun of The Likely Lads saga is an odd choice, even by
the standards of BBC schedulers, but it does at least remind you of how
good James Bolam and Rodney Bewes were, even in 1964, and of why ITV is
still struggling, with the rather desperate expedient of the Comedy
First try-outs (ITV, Monday) to find a sit-com half as good 31 years
later.

Rob Robertson talks to the Scot who will be fighting to defend human
rights in Hong Kong when it comes back under Chinese rule in 1997
A 72-year-old Edinburgh-born Hearts supporter may seem an unlikely
figure to take on the might of the Chinese Government on the issue of
human rights. However, Jimmy McGregor shouldn't be underestimated.
He is a prominent figure on the Hong Kong Legislative Council, which
is similar to our Parliament, and is responsible for organising the
colony's changeover to Chinese rule in two years.
Back in his native city for a brief visit to receive an honorary
degree from Napier University, McGregor spoke of his worries for the
people of Hong Kong.
A close political ally of beleaguered Hong Kong governor Chris Patten,
McGregor is looked on by many in the colony as the man to fight for
their human rights.
''Sixty thousand people a year are leaving Hong Kong, mostly Chinese
middle-class people,'' he said. ''They are capable, wealthy, and good
people who are leaving because they are afraid.
''They do not have the confidence to keep their children in Hong Kong
beyond 1997. Many of them have run away from China before. They know how
China works, what it does to dissidents, and the level of corruption in
the country.
''They do not trust the Chinese promises on human rights or their
claims to uphold the legal system.''
Last week the Hong Kong Legislature put forward a motion of no
confidence against Chris Patten, the first such challenge in 150 years
of British colonial rule. McGregor described the move, which was
defeated, as extraordinary, hurtful and stupid.
The motion was put forward by the Democratic Party, who until then
were among Patten's closest allies. It was lodged to express their fury
at last month's Sino-British agreement for a post-1997 Hong Kong Court
of Final Appeal.
They argued that Patten kowtowed to Chinese demands and accepted a
watered-down court and legal system which did not guarantee judicial
freedom when Hong Kong is taken over by China.
''This arose because in the past few months there has been a change in
British policy towards China,'' said McGregor. ''It is clear that the
Government now wants to repair fences with the Chinese authorities in
such a way as to give Hong Kong the best possible chance of a smooth
transition.
''However, there are many issues on which we have disagreements with
China. There are fundamental issues in Hong Kong we must protect.
''The Chinese Government is communist. The British are leaving behind
a structure of democratic government where people do have the right to
vote. There are human rights in Hong Kong that simply do not exist in
China.
''Bit by bit the Chinese Government is taking action to ensure it is
in a position to crack down if it has to or make official Hong Kong
parties, like the Democratic Party, so ineffective in office people will
not vote for them.
''I had thought the Chinese Government would mellow in their dislike
of Mr Patten and their dislike of the British authorities, but they have
many petty ways in which they show the whip is in their hands and the
British have to jump to it.
''The Chinese have some deep suspicions of the British Government.
They think the British will take more out of Hong Kong than they should,
which is nonsense.''
He said the Chinese authorities did not get on with Chris Patten
because he was standing up for the rights of people in Hong Kong.
''He has the guts to stand against the might of China, which is pretty
fearsome. He has managed to introduce a slightly better level of
democratic reform.''
Another major problem for the colony was the possibility of political
corruption.
''Corruption in China is very serious and is already pouring in across
the border. Even the military is involved.
''How on earth will the Chinese Government, with no capability to stop
corrupution in their own country, prevent it in Hong Kong.''
Apart from his fears over China, McGregor said his biggest regret was
he was unable to convince the British Government to set up an office to
promote Scottish interests in Hong Kong.
Away from politics, McGregor is a successful businessman with
directorships of a number of major companies. He is also honorary
president of the Napier Hong Kong Association which administers and
raises funds to provide scholarships for Hong Kong students to study at
Napier University.
Despite the lure of watching Hearts regularly and the pull of Scotland
he said he would probably stick it out in Hong Kong.
''At the age of seventy-two there is every reason to stay, but good
reasons not to. I have been a thorn in the side of the Chinese
Government over the years. Only time will tell how things will change
for people like me.''

Bank of Scotland
THE scene is Patrick Steill's Cross Keys tavern in Edinburgh's High
Street, midway between Parliament Close and the Tron Kirk. The date is
November 1, 1695. A book has just been opened under the supervision of a
cousin of the Earl of Argyll seeking subscriptions for the founding of a
''publick bank''.
The first 172 subscribers -- adventurers as they are swashbucklingly
called -- include nobles and landowners, merchants, lawyers, and judges.
Seven women subscribe in their own right.
This is pre-Union Scotland, a country in political and economic
ferment. The massacre of Macdonalds in Glencoe took place just three
years earlier. It is the start of the ''seven ill years'' marked by
failing harvests and widespread poverty among ordinary Scots.
It is also a time of great commercial adventure. In the same year that
the bank's subscription book is opened in that Edinburgh hostelry, money
is also being sought for a rival venture, the Company of Scotland, later
known as the ill-fated Darien Company.
While Darien swallowed up perhaps a quarter of Scotland's entire
liquid assets and ended up in ignominious failure in the swamp-ridden
isthmus of Panama, the bank which first saw the light of day in a
tavern, Bank of Scotland, prospers still, its elegant present-day
headquarters little more than a stone's throw from where it first raised
capital.
Bank of Scotland still operates under its founding Act, passed by the
old Scottish parliament on July 17, 1695. That legislation, 300 years
old this month, enabled 12 merchants, five of them Edinburgh-based,
seven based in London, to raise twelve hundred thousand pounds Scots
(#100,000 sterling) from the public.
It was a unique institution for its time, wholly dependent on the
capital raised from its investors. The driving force behind Bank of
Scotland -- whisper it now -- was actually an Englishman. John Holland,
the prime mover among the 12, was a London-based paid employee of the
East India Company, involved in the cloth trade.
Legend has it that Holland acted on an idea put to him by a friend,
''an earnest and ingenious . . . Scotch gentleman''. There is, perhaps,
a compensating symmetry in the fact that while Holland is credited with
Bank of Scotland it was a Scotsman, William Paterson from Dumfriesshire,
who is generally deemed the inspiration behind the creation of the Bank
of England a year earlier.
In fact, Paterson did what he could to kill off Bank of Scotland at
birth. He was a vocal promoter of the Darien adventure and, given Bank
of Scotland's links through Holland to the English East India Company,
Paterson saw the fledgling Scottish bank as a commercial rival and was
keen to do it down.
Within a year, Bank of Scotland was in deep trouble as Paterson and
the Darien Company tried to break it, by accumulating its banknotes (the
first to be issued anywhere in Europe) and demanding cash for them.
Bank of Scotland narrowly survived that first run on its reserves. But
it was Darien which was destined to become a failed footnote in Scottish
history. Three hundred years on, Bank of Scotland has prospered mightily
with a current balance sheet of #34 billion and a market capitalisation
of nearly #2500m.
The bank's progress in the past three centuries has been far from
uniform. There have been many dramatic periods in its history, mirroring
the ups and downs of Scotland itself. Although accused by some in the
eighteenth century of being the Jacobite bank, Bank of Scotland withdrew
credit and moved all its valuables into Edinburgh Castle when faced with
Bonnie Prince Charlie's advance on the capital during the '45.
In the nineteenth century, Bank of Scotland helped save Sir Walter
Scott from bankruptcy and acted almost like an unofficial central bank
when the Scottish banking system was racked by a wave of failures which
saw the demise of first the Western, then the City of Glasgow Bank.
But the really spectacular growth in Bank of Scotland -- a 10-fold
increase in its balance sheet giving it, despite new entrants to the
field like Abbey National, 7% share of the UK banking market -- has all
occurred in the past 15 years. The conditions which made that dramatic
growth possible have all emerged since the last war.
The bank's present governor and group chief executive, Sir Bruce
Pattullo, the first man to reach that post through the ranks, joined
Bank of Scotland as only its third graduate trainee in 1961. He has
observed all these changes and, since 1979 when the bank skipped a
generation and made him treasurer at the age of 41, has shaped much of
that growth.
British banks after the war, he points out, were very different
animals from the institutions we know today. It wasn't just that, in his
first three years of branch postings, one of his main tasks at
Goldenacre branch was to keep the two coal stoves -- one behind the
counter, one in front -- going full blast to salve the manager's chronic
lumbago. The relationship between deposit taking and lending was also
quite, quite different.
On average, in recent years, Bank of Scotland has lent some 84% of
deposits to borrowers. Immediately after the war that figure was under
5%. Even by the late fifties it had grown little. This was the age of
credit squeezes when most of the money deposited was invested in gilts,
government securities. But in the post-war period inflation crept
steadily upwards, from 2.5% to 7% by 1957.
Chasing better returns pushed the banks into investing in longer and
longer-dated gilts. But, as interest rates continued to rise, the
capital value of these government securities -- and, therefore, the
capital value of the banks' hidden reserves -- faced steady erosion.
''For 15 years management and the board were busy trying to make
sufficient profits from relatively mundane lending activity to cover up
the losses going on at the back of the balance sheet. That must have
drained their energy,'' says Pattullo.
He remembers the bank then as steeply hierarchical, where bright young
men, even those like him who made it to the all-powerful inspection
department, were ''ground under foot'' if they had ideas above their
station.
It does not sound like an environment where, two decades later, growth
would suddenly mushroom and Bank of Scotland would win accolades as a
market innovator. But there were signs, even then, of that. In 1959,
Bank of Scotland was the first British bank to install a central
computer, an IBM 1401, purchased from the late Sir Alex Fletcher. Sir
Bruce is fond of reminding people that the power of that whirring
edifice resplendent in its air-conditioned suite amounts to just one two
hundred thousandth of the computing power of one Pentium-powered PC
today.
Earlier, in 1955, Bank of Scotland had merged with the Union Bank of
Scotland, the first of two big post-war acquisitions which helped
rationalise provision in an overbanked country. The second acquisition
was British Linen, bought from Barclays in 1971. Under Jimmy Letham, the
treasurer between 1966 and 1970, some promising younger managers,
including Pattullo, were plucked from the inspection department and
given their heads to create whole new functions like marketing and
investment management.
Bank of Scotland was entering the modern management age. But the
biggest boost to its later growth came in the late sixties and early
seventies with the mounting realisation that the North Sea would prove
to be a significant world oil province. Oil caused 34 non-indigenous
banks to set up offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow in search of a slice of
the action.
Then, in 1975, National Westminster announced it too would open a
branch in Edinburgh, immediately followed by Barclays, both breaching a
century-old gentlemen's agreement between the Scottish and English banks
not to encroach on each other's territory. ''We thought it was the end
of the world,'' recalls Pattullo. ''But, in some respects it proved to
be the beginning of a brave new world.''
The horizons of that new world can be judged by the fact that Bank of
Scotland today does 60% of its business south of the Border, and does it
-- thanks to technical and product innovations like HOBS, its electronic
banking system, and market leadership in funding management buy-outs --
without an extensive and costly branch network. Pattullo sees no reason
why that percentage should not reach 80% or even 90% in due course.
When Pattullo was taken to the New Club by the then-governor, Lord
Clydesmuir, in 1979 to be told the board wanted him to become treasurer
at the dramatically young age of 41, the post-war transformation in the
bank's fortunes entered its final, dramatic phase.
Pattullo quickly did two things. He abolished the new business
department on the assumption that it was stifling initiative elsewhere
in the bank. New business was something everyone should be seeking. And
he set about, with the support of Lord Clydesmuir and his successor Sir
Tom Risk, to plug what he saw as a strategy gap in the bank's
organisational structures.
The main board, made up entirely of non-executives whose primary
energies were devoted to their own businesses, assumed the executive was
thinking ahead. But, given the bank's hierarchical traditions, a
deferential executive left strategic thinking to the board.
''In fact, neither was doing it,'' says Pattullo. So he formalised
what is possibly a unique structure in British corporate life where the
management board, made up of all the bank's key executives, formulates
strategy and makes recommendations to the main board which Pattullo, as
governor, now chairs.
In the Pattullo era, Bank of Scotland has driven forward the principle
that the whole enterprise prospers when its people take authority and
run with it. He is fulsome about the number of workable innovations
which have bubbled up from within an empowered structure.
Bank of Scotland garners contradictory attention from the outside
world. Admired for its innovative track record, it has also been
dismissed by the Lex column in the Financial Times as ''boring''.
Pattullo is not unhappy with the epithet. A judicious mix of
ground-breaking and traditional Scottish canniness serves banking well
-- summed up in the current treasurer Peter Burt's telling phrase as
''deep pockets, short arms'' -- Pattullo believes.
Boring means not causing anyone too many surprises and that, in a
bank, is a virtue, he believes. In the most recent recession, he adds,
there was a time when most banks, reeling from the impact of mounting
provisions on their dwindling profits, had pulled down the shutters
completely and only Bank of Scotland and NatWest were at the table for
the big deals.
What started 300 years ago as good Scots siller changing hands in an
Edinburgh pub has come a very long way. Not as the crow flies, perhaps.
But John Holland and his colleagues would not recognise what's become of
what they started. Scotland's friend for life has outlived almost every
other institution in the land. And, given its rapid growth in the past
15 years, it looks to have a lot further to go.

Zagreb, Friday
BOSNIAN Serb forces launched a big attack on the Muslim enclave of
Zepa from the south today.
''It is a major attack now, the Bosnian Serb army is moving in from
the south,'' said a UN source in Zagreb.
''They were targeting our observation posts from the outside, but they
have now pushed in,'' he said, adding that there were also reports of
burning villages.
In Sarajevo, UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko said later that a number of
shells landed near the observation posts of Ukrainian UN peacekeeping
troops in Zepa, but the area was reported to be quiet by early evening.
Ivanko stressed that information from the isolated enclave in eastern
Bosnia, surrounded by Serb forces, was sketchy.
About two hours before the reported attack, UN spokesman Chris Gunness
said there was Nato air presence in the area.
Two limited Nato air strikes on Tuesday failed to prevent Bosnian Serb
forces capturing Srebrenica, another UN-protected ''safe area'' north of
Zepa in eastern Bosnia. Serbs then drove out thousands of Muslim
refugees westwards to Bosnian Government-held territory.
About 15,000 people, mostly Muslims, live in the small, hilly enclave
of Zepa where they are under the protection of fewer than 100 Ukrainian
UN soldiers.
The attack on Zepa began after talks between Serb rebels and
government forces broke down. The local Serb commander then told the
Ukrainian UN commander that all civilians should leave the enclave, and
government forces should surrender weapons by 2pm.
Two hours after that deadline passed, Nato jets circled overhead and
shells rained down on three Ukrainian compounds, UN spokesmen said.
The Serbs insist that they are justified in attacking ''safe areas''
because the lightly armed government troops in the area mount attacks
from them. However their firepower is no match for the Serbs, who have
used their enormous advantage in heavy weapons to take 70% of Bosnia.
The Zepa scenario closely resembled that preceding the fall of
Srebrenica, the first UN safe area created in 1993. That defeat for the
United Nations has drawn worldwide condemnation of the Serbs, but no
decisions on what to do next.

A THREAT of industrial action by staff at UK passport offices was
lifted yesterday after last-ditch negotiations.
Leaders of the CPSA union claimed that senior management of the
Passport Agency had stepped back from proposals to cut 10% of its 1600
staff, and bring the private sector into passport production.
The union's Scottish officer, Mr Michael McCann, said the strength of
opposition expressed by staff had forced management to guarantee that
there would be no compulsory redundancies and that any restructuring
would take place over a longer term.
As a result, CPSA officials called off the action which was due to
begin on Monday, and will now ballot members, recommending that they
accept the agency's written assurances.

Moscow, Friday
SPECULATION swirled around President Boris Yeltsin's health today
after he prolonged his stay in hospital and called off a trip to Norway.
However, working from the Moscow hospital ward where he was taken with
heart pain on Tuesday, the 64-year old president issued a decree setting
December 17 as election day for the lower house of Russia's Parliament.
The move appeared designed to silence opposition communist and
ultra-nationalist critics, who had said the Kremlin chief secretly
planned to put off the scheduled election because he feared pro-Yeltsin
parties would take a beating.
''Passions will now subside about whether the elections are to be held
or not and that is the most important thing,'' Duma chairman Ivan Rybkin
told reporters.
Within hours of the announcement, a fresh bout of speculation over
Yeltsin's fitness was triggered by news that he would stay in hospital
all next week, missing a planned three-day visit to Norway from July 19.
This marked a sharp break with official assertions that he was
recovering well and was determined to stick to his work programme next
week.
Yeltsin, whose indifferent health and alleged heavy drinking have led
the opposition to question his fitness to rule, has not been seen in
public since he was taken to hospital on Tuesday with chest pains and a
blood supply problem.
Television cameras have not been allowed in to his hospital ward.
Top adviser Viktor Ilyushin said that Yeltsin, who has headed Russia
since in 1991 and faces re-election next June, had cancelled all his
engagements until July 24 on the advice of his doctors.
Kremlin officials said earlier he would leave hospital on Monday,
travelling to Norway on Wednesday then to Murmansk in Russia's Arctic
north.
Presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev said Yeltsin's doctors had
deemed it too dangerous for him to fly.
Earlier, Yeltsin's wife, Naina, visited her husband and later said he
was well. ''I can put Russians at ease, Boris Yeltsin's health is
fine,'' she said, ''but this treatment should not be hurried.''
Ilyushin put Yeltsin's heart problem down to stress caused by a series
of crises, including a hostage drama in the southern Russian town of
Budennovsk, failed moves to impeach him, and fighting in the breakaway
Chechnya region.
''It is enough to mention the events in Budennovsk, the confrontation
between the State Duma (lower house of parliament) and the government,
the impeachment procedure started by the communists, the events in
Chechnya, to understand the daily overload Boris Yeltsin faces,'' he
said.
In Chechnya itself, peace talks which had been due to resume between
the Russian government and Chechen rebels in the capital Grozny were
postponed, chief mediator Sandor Meszaros said.
Earlier, there had been reports that the rebel delegation had not
returned from consultations with separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev.--Reuter.

Srinagar, Friday
KASHMIRI militants who have threatened to kill five Western hostages
tried to contact negotiators today, indicating that they may be ready to
modify their demand.
However faulty telephone lines in Jammu-Kashmir state prevented the
kidnappers from reaching the Western diplomats.
The separatists have threatened to kill the hostages tomorrow night
unless India frees 21 jailed Kashmiri rebels.
Indian officials and Western diplomats have been trying to contact the
rebels in an effort to persuade them to free the five male tourists: two
Britons, an American, a German, and a Norwegian.
Today, the kidnappers from the little-known Al-Faran group tried to
call a designated phone number to talk with the Western diplomats in the
state capital, Srinagar, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
No call came through, however, and the US, British, and German
diplomats left the building after waiting for an hour. A short time
later, the rebel spokesman called.
He was given another phone number to contact the diplomats, but it did
not work because of telephone service problems in the war-torn city.
Earlier, in a telephone call to the Associatated Press in Srinagar,
Al-Faran had again threatened to kill the hostages by tomorrow night if
its demand was not met.
The militant spokesman said the captives were in good health, but he
urged the hostages' friends and families to win their release by
persuading India to free the jailed rebels.
The spokesman also said the rebels had telephoned the office of
Lieutenant General D D Saklani, the top security official in the state,
three times yesterday, but a low-ranking staff person who answered hung
up, apparently believing the call to be a hoax.
The hostages are Keith Mangan, 33, of Middlesbrough; Paul Wells, 23,
of London; Donald Hutchings, 42, of Spokane, Washington; Dirk Hasert,
26, of Erfurt, Germany; and Hans Christian Ostro, 27, of Oslo, Norway.
Another American who was kidnapped on July 4 with the two Britons and
Mr Hutchings escaped last Saturday and returned to New Delhi.
Since late 1989, Muslim rebels have been fighting for the independence
of Jammu-Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in mostly Hindu India.
More than 11,600 people have been killed.
Militant groups have kidnapped other Westerners to dramatise their
demands, but all the captives have been freed unharmed.--AP.

Sydney, Friday
ANTI-NUCLEAR demonstrators around the South Pacific threw a symbolic
wet blanket over France's Bastille Day celebrations.
Thousands of people opposed to the planned resumption of French
nuclear testing in the region held rallies and marches to try to spoil
official Bastille Day receptions in New Zealand, Australia, and Fiji.
In New York, about 150 people gathered outside the French Consulate,
waving French flags and loaves of French bread. One protester's placard
read: ''Baguettes not bombs.''
The environmental activist group Greenpeace, which sponsored the
protest, also planned demonstrations in San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago,
Boston, and Washington.
''If we can show there's support that nuclear tesing should not be
resumed, that's the power of the people,'' said Greenpeace activist
Sonja Deely.
In Europe, demonstrators were out in several nations, among them
Britain, Germany, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic.
In Paris, however, President Jacques Chirac brushed aside the chorus
of international protest and reaffirmed his commitment to go ahead with
the testing, telling a Bastille Day news conference that his decision
was irrevocable.
In Sydney, Australia's biggest city, about 10,000 people shouting
''Stop French testing'' marched to a police-ringed French consulate.
Marchers, clogging four city blocks, carried banners reading ''Truffles
not testing'' and ''Boycott products of France''.
Expatriate Polynesians burned a French flag at a protest south of
Sydney and 1000 people rallied outside a convention centre in Canberra
as the French ambassador went ahead with an official reception.
An Australian MP presented a 100,000-name petition to the French
ambassador calling for testing to stop.
In New Zealand, about 2000 protesters dumped manure outside the French
ambassador's Wellington residence and heckled the ambassador and his
guests, chanting ''Liberty, equality, fraternity, hypocrisy''.
About 2500 people marched on the French embassy in Fiji's capital,
Suva, and handed in a 50,000-signature petition.
About 6000 Italians protested in a nearby square as Bastille Day
celebrations took place at the French embassy in Rome. Protesters
wearing gas masks also picketed the French embassy in Athens.
Outside the French consulate in Hamburg, demonstrators unfurled a
symbolic 26ft high mushroom cloud image, accompanied by wailing sirens
and a small explosion. A crowd of about 150 jeered and waved banners
saying ''Shame for Europe -- save Polynesia''.
Germany's powerful Greens party organised a protest outside the French
embassy in Bonn.
In Switzerland, activists climbed the French embassy's roof in Berne
and about 100 Greenpeace protesters rallied outside.
Czech anti-nuclear protesters demonstrating outside the French Embassy
in Prague persuaded several party guests to sign a petition calling for
a halt to nuclear tests.
The strongest protests were in Australia, where unions hurt French
businesses with a range of Bastille Day boycotts.
Air France cancelled Bastille Day flights between Sydney and Paris and
Sydney and New Caledonia owing to a 24-hour ban by transport workers. A
French ship was reported to have been boycotted by port workers in
Melbourne.--Reuter.

A MEMBER of a masked gang which subjected an elderly couple to a
terrifying knifepoint ordeal was jailed for five years yesterday.
Stephen Potter, 30, winked to supporters in the public benches at the
High Court in Edinburgh as he was led away.
One of the victims, Mr James Shanks, 87, who was virtually bedridden
at the time of the attack, has since died.
His companion, Miss Betty McCracken, who was 68, had rings forcibly
pulled off her fingers after being threatened that her fingers would be
cut off if she resisted.
Lord Osborne told Potter: ''The experience to which they were
subjected must have been truly terrifying and I am dismayed to learn
that it lasted for a considerable period of time.''
The court heard that Potter, a father of two, was part of a gang which
broke into Lathallan House, near Polmont, Stirlingshire, on July 8 last
year and stole valuables and cash from the couple during an ordeal which
lasted for hours.
Potter, unemployed, of Miller Street, Carluke, Lanarkshire, admitted
assaulting the couple and robbing them of #1050, Chinese, silver, and
Victorian vases, Japanese dishes worth #5000, a gold watch, and 11
rings. None of the items has been recovered.
Two other gang members were jailed last year. Potter's brother,
Robert, 26, of Riverside Road, Larkhall, was jailed for five years and
David Balmer, 27, of Eastfield Road, Carluke, for six years.

A round-up of new sounds by The Herald reviewers
Berlioz Overtures, San Diego Symphony Orchestra (Naxos)
* HERE'S another bargain from the budget-label Naxos (CDs under a
fiver). And it raises again the questions of full-price CDs and how much
music they contain. Here is a complete set of Berlioz's Overtures,
running at nearly 76 minutes, for under a fiver. The disc marks the
debut on Naxos of the San Diego Symphony Orchestra -- the first US
orchestra signed up by the label -- with their conductor Yoav Talmi.
Performances, recorded in the Copley Symphony Hall in San Diego, are
good -- if not in the superstar category -- as is the sound overall.
Totally acceptable. Death to the #15 CD.

* A mammoth re-release of five early greatest hits compilations and
the Strolling Oldsters' first 13 albums until 1970, most of which come
with their US sleeves, track-listings, and titles. Everything is
digitally-remastered from the original master tapes. As well as in CD
form, everything is available for a limited period on vinyl. But if you
buy everything at once, your wallet will be in need of a severe digital
re-mastering, too. So what to go for? Well, you could take the easy way
out and opt for the best of collections. Instead, I'd recommend
Aftermath, the first album upon which the Stones stretched out and
became something rather more than blues-bound laddies from Sarf Landan;
Beggar's Banquet for its reinvention of rock'n'roll as revo-loo-shun,
and Let It Bleed, for its endorsement of the lure of country-rock. And
why not seize the time to re-evaluate Satanic Majesties? For years,
every critic has dismissed its fey psychedelia as a poor imitation of
the Beatles' Sgt Pepper. Now I wouldn't be so sure, though. But I am
sure that once Brian Jones died for Mick'n'Keef's sins, the Stones were
never one-quarter as good.

roaring, but often undervalued, bands.

A SCOTTISH humanitarian group operating in Tuzla last night appealed
for aid to help the tens of thousands of Muslim refugees who fled there
from the Srebrenica enclave.
Scottish European Aid has a team in Tuzla which has linked up with the
United Nations to deliver vital water supplies to the refugees.
Speaking from Split the group's co-ordinator, Mr Jonathan Dames, from
Edinburgh said he had been receiving regular reports all through
yesterday from his team.
He said his 40 colleagues had thirty vehicles at their disposal but
needed more cash aid to help fund the emergency project.
Mr Dames said :''The team is helping supply 85,000 litres of water
each day to the displaced people from Srebrenica.
''It has been suggested around 30,000 refugees could be in Tuzla by
Monday. They are pouring in on an unprecedented scale, and are
frightened and devastated.
''Many of them are camping on Tuzla Airport runway with no food and
little water in the heat of summer.''

FIFTY per cent of girls have lost their virginity by the age of 16,
according to a report published yesterday.
Attitudes to boys varied -- but one in four of the teenage girls
questioned said they had been forced to have sex.
In Scotland, one in three girls frequently practised unsafe sex, and
the same proportion -- one in three -- were also the most likely to have
been forced into sex.
The survey of 1000 young women by 19 magazine also showed that the
average age that girls first had sex was 15[1/2]. One in three would
sleep with a married man, although 33% said they would say no to casual
sex.
But one in four girls admitted to having unsafe sex, while a similar
number would cheat on their boyfriends.
Attitudes were liberal, with 88% saying it was all right to be gay and
more than half (56%) saying they would think about looking at
pornography.
Girls from the South of England were fastest to start a sexual
relationship and would be most likely to two-time boyfriends.
Northern girls were more cautious about jumping into bed with someone
without knowing their full sexual history. They hang on to their
virginity longer than southern girls.
Half the girls questioned in Wales said they would cheat with married
men and were the most likely to jump into bed on the first date. But 91%
said they would take precautions.
Girls in Northern Ireland were the most virtuous, remaining virgins
until an average 17 years.
* Pregnancies among girls aged 13-15 is on the increase in Ayrshire
and Arran Health Board's area, although its overall rate of teenage
pregnancies is coming down.
In his annual report, issued yesterday, Dr Drew Walker, the board's
director of public health, said the overall number of teenage
pregnancies in the 13-19 age group, recorded as 42.9 per 1000 females in
1993 -- had dropped by 5.5 per 1000 in the past three years.
However, in the 13-16 age group -- below the legal age of consent --
the number of pregnancies had been gradually increasing, with the 7.4
per 1000 females recorded in 1984 creeping up to 11.7 per 1000 in 1993.

THE accolade of being the first humans ever to walk over the sea to
Skye went yesterday to Donald Ross, 17, and Kenneth MacDonald, 22.
Their several Great Steps for Mankind came after the last two sections
of the bridge were connected at a ceremony to mark its completion -- and
they speedily used the opportunity to push out the boat for the first
National New Blood Donor Day in Kyle today.
Mr Ross, Kyle's youngest blood donor, and Mr MacDonald, one of the
youngest Skye donors from Portree, were accompanied by North of Scotland
Blood Transfusion Service manager Marianne Greg, co-ordinators Morag
MacLeod for Kyle and Pat MacDonald for Portree, and long-serving Kyle
donor Audrey Henderson.
A special session for new blood donors will be held in Kyle village
hall between 11am and 5pm today, when people can either donate blood or
register at a pledge point.
BBC children's wildlife presenter Terry Nutkins will be present at
11.30am along with fiddler Phil Cunningham, who will perform during the
day.
New blood donor attendance in Scotland fell from 38,762 in 1993/94 to
37,265 in 1994/95. The service needs thousands of donations a day.

THE directors of the Skye Boat Company, set up 18 months ago to
provide an alternative service to the new bridge, have invited members
of the public to take shares in their company.
The local businessmen -- an architect, an accountant, and a chartered
engineer -- want to offer local people and tourists the opportunity to
continue crossing from Kyle of Lochalsh to Kyleakin by ferry when
Caledonian MacBrayne ceases operating its service when the bridge opens.
The company has initially targeted the Skye Bridge Appeal Group,
offering its 200 members the chance to buy 100 shares at #10 each (which
would qualify the shareholder for one year's free car travel on the
ferry), or a group of up to five people to buy 100 shares (qualifying
the addressee to one year's free pedestrian travel).
Mr Peter Findlay, one of the directors, said they had a ''good sum''
in the bank and estimated it would cost between #50,000 and #70,000 to
buy the right kind of ferry. The company would employ 14 people,
including some former CalMac employees, once it began operating, he
said.
However, to date, a suitable ferry has yet to be acquired.
''We have just missed one ferry but we are not upset about it because
it would only take six cars. As this develops we are getting more and
more people coming in and advising us that a six-car ferry would not
take enough people to make an impact. We are on the trail of other
ferries, in Scandinavia in particular. We would like a ferry that would
take about 12 cars, but the important thing is that it would take 100 to
150 passengers,'' said Mr Findlay.
''In the summer season all the visitors want to go over the sea to
Skye. A lot will come by train and they don't want to go over the bridge
on a bus. They like the idea of a ferry. We know we will have a good
clientele there and a regular winter clientele from locals,'' he added.
He predicted that the bridge would ''take everything and everybody who
can recover the cost, such as business cars'' but that people who have
to pay the fare out of their own pockets would take the ferry.
He said that the Skye Boat Company's would be charging ''significantly
lower'' prices than the bridge. The Skye Bridge tolls have yet to be
fixed, but they are expected to mirror CalMac's at #5.20 each way for a
car.
Mr Findlay said: ''We think we can do it for #4 a car. We will be
asking a small fee for foot-passengers and locals would get a long-term
pass and shareholders will get a year's free ferry pass.''
His co-director, Mr Bob Danskin, said the company had between three
and four months -- the bridge is expected to open to traffic either late
September or October -- to find a suitable vessel.
An estimated 60 to 70 local people are believed to cross between Kyle
and Kyleakin every day, either for work, shopping or business.
''It is an extension of the street between the two villages,'' said Mr
Findlay.
Opponents to the bridge claim that when it opens officially, Kyleakin
will lose out drastically on passing trade because visitors will no
longer stop in the village and surrounding tourist attractions will be
ignored.
Some councillors on Skye are campaigning against the proposed tolls,
but Sir Iain Noble, chairman of Skye Bridge Ltd, has defended the cost.
He said: ''The level of tolls is spelled out by an Act of Parliament.
We cannot alter them. If they were lower they would have to go on
longer. At least they will be no higher than the ferry. If some people
use a private ferry, the tolls will carry on longer. Every person who
pays the toll brings nearer the day when these high tolls will cease.''
He called on people to start ''blessing it rather than bashing it''.
But the Scottish Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, Mr
Charles Kennedy, said he would be seeking an urgent meeting with
Scottish Office Minister of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton to discuss
whether the Minister supported the principle of competition where the
Skye Bridge was concerned.
''To give substance to that signal he must ensure that the Skye Boat
Company Ltd is given all practical support in its efforts to run an
alternative ferry,'' he said.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''After careful
consideration, Ministers concluded that the Skye Bridge, which will in
due course be free of tolls, would provide a better and more reliable
service for the people of Skye than continuing the present ferry
service.
''The Government, therefore, invested #6m to provide approach roads
for a new bridge and secured the bridge itself through private finance.
While Ministers support the principle of competition, they concluded at
the time that they should not spend tax-payers' money on a ferry service
situated directly alongside the new bridge.
''Should a private vehicle ferry service wish to operate between Kyle
and Kyleakin, an operator could do so providing the necessary provision
and licences were obtained and the appropriate facilities were
available.''
The Skye Bridge has been built with private money by The Miller Group,
the German firm Dywidag, and the Bank of America. They will receive the
revenue from tolls before handing the bridge into public ownership next
century.
The Scottish Office has also defended the high toll charges, claiming
they were set after negotiations with local interests and that there
would be discounts for regular users.

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton last night pledged to infuse a new
sense of urgency into the Northern Ireland peace process.
Speaking after an unexpected meeting with Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams, Mr Bruton also repeated calls for the early release by Britain of
paramilitary prisoners.
Dublin Government sources emphasised that the speedily-arranged
Bruton-Adams talks -- also attended by Ulster's Social Democratic and
Labour Party leader John Hume and deputy Irish premier Dick Spring --
did not add up to a peace process crisis meeting.
However, the unscheduled Dublin Castle exchanges were preceded by
statements expressing concern.
Sinn Fein strategist Martin McGuinness spoke of the process ''falling
asunder'', and Dublin's Fianna Fail opposition party leader, Mr Bertie
Ahern, openly spoke of a crisis.
Former Irish Premier Albert Reynolds -- one of the architects of the
process -- said there was a crisis of confidence.
The four-way talks ended with a joint statement urging early inclusive
all-party talks to resolve the problem.
The communique also highlighted the current impasse in the peace
process, and insisted that it had to be overcome.
Our Political Correspondent writes: The Northern Ireland Office said
yesterday that Sinn Fein and the IRA had not yet done enough to indicate
their commitment to a peaceful solution in the province to warrant them
being invited to all-party talks.
In particular, a willingness to respond positively to the British
Government's proposals on decommissioning arms was required, a
department spokeswoman said.
British and Irish officials are working on a variety of methods of
organising decommissioning and arrangements which could be made in both
countries for an amnesty while arms were handed in.
The British Government has made clear that it is not particularly
concerned which  method is adopted to take arms out of ciruculation,
provided that it is verifiable.
British and Irish Ministers should be able to discuss the options
around the end of this month, but before then the British Government is
likely to be in touch with Sinn Fein indicating that it needed to do
more.
The Unionist parties, although they  have not accepted the framework
document for pursuing a Northern Ireland solution, are expected to have
talks with Ministers in the autumn when the subject of decommissioning
loyalist arms will be raised.

As the final link between Skye and the mainland is completed, Alison
Daniels reflects on the feelings of loss and the hopes for the future.
IT took just 21 minutes for the last section of the Skye bridge to
slide across a 13ft gap, finally completing the road link between the
Isle of Skye and the mainland.
It was a moment that has been three years in coming, and one which the
smattering of people on the gravel shorelines far below the concrete
bridge watched with mixed feelings.
But for the contractors it was clearly an occasion to be relished. To
record the moment for posterity, representatives of engineering company
Miller and its German project partners Dyckerhoff &amp; Widmann accompanied
journalists to the centre of the concrete span to watch as a sliver of
green sea vanished beneath a metal sheet.
At 3.41pm, to the skirl of pipes and the hum of machinery, the sheet,
which will support the final section of the bridge, began its juddering
journey from the north cantilever towards the southern span of the
bridge, curving away towards Kyle of Lochalsh.
To add a dash of symbolism to the historic picture, a Saltire and a
Lion Rampant flag fluttered from the supporting scaffolding.
From the Skye side of the gap an 80-ton mould was moved into position.
Over the next fortnight it will be filled with 45 cubic metres of
concrete, before the road bridge is surfaced.
With the gap ever-narrowing, workmen radioed instructions which look
set to seal the fate of the two Caledonian MacBrayne ferries zig-zagging
across the mouth of Loch Alsh, 200 yards from the bridge.
The Government-run ferry service is due to cease to operate 24 hours
after the longest bridge in the northern hemisphere opens to motorists
in the autumn, but demand continues for a full public consulation to be
implemented before the ferries stop running.
At 3.55pm, Sir Iain Noble, chairman of Skye Bridge Limited -- the
private company which will operate the bridge -- clasped the hand of
Miller chairman James Miller.
With the gap now just a few inches, it was a chance to extol the
virtues of the 560-metre bridge which now links Skye to the mainland for
the first time since the Ice Age.
The historical gesture complete, Sir Iain added a few words meant to
quell criticism of the highest bridge tolls in Europe, and reiterated
that it will be cheaper for motorists to use than the ferry.
''The bridge was expensive to build but, hopefully, it will benefit
the economy of Skye. The tolls are something which are determined by
Parliament, but every person who pays brings nearer the day when these
tolls will cease.''
Local Highland regional councillor, Mr John Farquhar Munro, conceded
that most people in the area welcomed the bridge. However, he expressed
some scepticism over the period tolls will be charged, estimated at 20
years, and said, like others, he had expected bridge fares to be in
pence not pounds.
Watching the stage-managed spectacle, a group of workmen grabbed the
chance of a quick break and pondered less on the historical significance
than on the fact that a tough contract was near completion.
Around 150 men have worked seven days a week in some of the most
inhospitable conditions, which have seen wind-chill temperatures reach
minus 40 degrees Centigrade.
Finally, at two minutes past four o'clock, the metal sheet came to
rest against bars jutting from the southern span. The sea below gone. In
the Sound of Alsh a yachtsman leapt on to the bow of his boat to snatch
a photograph.
In a coincidence of timing, not stage-managed by the contractors, the
two CalMac ferries idled momentarily at their landing stages in Kyle and
Kyleakin, perhaps a sign of things to come.
On the bridge, workmen dismantled the temporary catwalk which had been
slung across the narrow gap and had allowed 11 Skye schoolchildren to
walk to mainland Scotland and back last month.
With yesterday's moment duly recorded, the media corps walked back to
Skye to canvass the opinion of those onlookers who had wandered up from
the shoreline.
Acknowledging their view was sentimental, members of the Green family,
from Saltcoats, were typical when they ventured the view that something
indefinably Scottish had been lost.
Gazing at the bridge, Mr Brian Green said: ''We have been coming up
here for six years and, personally, as a tourist I would rather use the
ferry than the bridge. However, I know the local people have wanted this
bridge and you couldn't have stopped them going ahead with it. I suppose
though it does seem a bit sad.''
On the ferry, more sighs from tourists over the dashing of the
romantic notion of an island crossing sacrificed to commercial demands.

A 17-YEAR-OLD with six A-pass Highers yesterday cleared the first
hurdle in his legal challenge against a decision by Glasgow University
to turn him down for a place at the Faculty of Medicine.
Mr Conor O'Reilly claims the university acted in breach of natural
justice, and at the Court of Session yesterday Lord Coulsfield rejected
a plea by the university that his case should be dismissed at this
stage.
Mr O'Reilly, who attended the hearing with his parents, said he was
pleased with the way the case had gone so far.
A spokesman for the university commented: ''The case has now been
continued to a proof on the very narrow point of whether the university
required candidates to have had work experience.
''As was stated in court today, our decision to reject the application
(by Mr O'Reilly) was based on the lack of motivation shown by the
candidate and not on the question of work experience. The proof will now
determine that point.''
Mr O'Reilly, who attended St Aloysius' College, gained A-pass Highers
in biology, chemistry, English, Latin, maths and physics and went for an
interview at Glasgow University last December.
The interview lasted about five minutes, and about a week later he
received a letter informing him that his application had been rejected.
He asked for an explanation, and in May was finally told that the
specific reason for his rejection was his failure to express a strong
personal enthusiasm for and a commitment to medicine either in a written
statement he had prepared or in what he said at the interview.
The university added that this impression was reinforced by the fact
that Mr O'Reilly had failed to make any independent effort to acquaint
himself with the way of life a medical career offered, for example by
work shadowing in a general practice or a hospital or voluntary work in
a caring environment.
The university also pointed out that admission to the faculty of
medicine was based not just on academic qualifications but also on a
school report, a personal written statement by the candidate explaining
why he or she wished to study medicine and an individual interview.
It says that each year the faculty of medicine receives about 2000
applications for 234 places and that this year 26 applicants with
straight-A highers (including Mr O'Reilly) were not offered a place.
In his court case Mr O'Reilly is asking Lord Coulsfield to declare
that in reaching its decision the university failed to give proper
weight to his personal statement and report from his school and that it
acted unreasonably and contrary to natural justice.
He says the university failed to advise him in its prospectus for
potential students that it was a prerequisite of entry to the faculty of
medicine to make an independent effort to familiarise himself with the
way of life offered by a medical career.
Mr O'Reilly, whose father is a consultant and lectures at Glasgow
University, is also asking Lord Coulsfield to set aside the decision
rejecting his application to join the medical school.
He has been unconditionally offered places at Aberdeen, Dundee,
Edinburgh and St Andrews, but is determined to go to Glasgow.
Mrs Margaret Hughes, counsel for Mr O'Reilly, said that the letter
explaining the rejection implied that work experience was a material
factor in the selection procedure.
If this was so, she contended, it should have been disclosed in the
prospectus.
Mr Neil Davidson, QC, for the university, submitted that lack of work
experience was not a primary reason for Mr O'Reilly's rejection. The
primary reason was that at his interview the interviewers formed the
impression that Mr O'Reilly was not sufficiently motivated to pursue a
medical career.
This was very much a question of judgment for those who had to decide
on admission to what was a highly competitive discipline.
A date for a second hearing has not yet been fixed.

A SCOTTISH heart surgeon at the centre of several controversial
issues, including a ''no confidence'' vote from colleagues, has resigned
from a children's charity while its financial affairs are under
investigation.
Health managers recently declared publicly that Mr Duncan Walker had
lost the support of fellow consultants and they are conducting a review
of his past ''clinical'' work.
Mr Walker, 53, who was born in Uddingston, is a father of four, and
former houseman at the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. He has been at
Killingbeck Hospital more than 15 years carrying out almost 30,000 heart
operations, mostly on children.
Yesterday in a statement via a PR company he said he was resigning his
voluntary position as a trustee of the Children's Heart Surgery Fund.
''I am stepping down with deep regret so the Children's Heart Fund can
pursue its objective of raising money for the benefit of sick children
as effectively as possible. In doing this I hope to lift from the trust
the cloud of idle speculation and harmful innuendo which has followed me
for many months. It will also allow me to concentrate my efforts on
getting myself back to work.''
The Charity Commission is looking into a complaint that the fund's
money was used for research and care for adults, in breach of its strict
remit to spend donations ''for the relief of sick children''.

Ken Gallacher delights in a new series on Louis Armstrong which goes
beyond all the popular material
THE six-hour profile of Louis Armstrong which was kicked off by
trombonist and broadcaster Campbell Burnap at the beginning of the week
on Radio 2 promises to be a definitive series on the trumpeter's life
and music.
It may appear that there is little new which can be discovered, or
said, about Armstrong whose achievements as jazz musician and
entertainer have been covered in numerous books, as well as previously
broadcast radio and television programmes.
Burnap, however, has not relied on material which is already widely
known. He travelled to the States to put the programmes together and
over six hours they will provide a unique insight into Armstrong the man
and the musician.
Burnap, for instance, taped lengthy interviews with two of Armstrong's
longest-serving sidemen in the All Stars, the group he travelled with
for more than quarter of a century after the Second World War.
Bassist Arvell Shaw lives now on Long Island while drummer Barrett
Deems has returned to his home city of Chicago where, close to 80 years
old, he still plays regularly.
''Barrett is as irrepressible as ever. He had a big band album issued
last year and he still has that band going in Chicago. He plays quite
regularly and it's clear that his drum kit remains his life,'' smiles
Burnap.
''While we were there we caught him playing one of his regular gigs
and also managed to sit him down to talk about his days with the All
Stars. There is some fascinating stuff from him.
''Arvell Shaw who was the bass player for so many years with Louis is
not as active as Barrett. He is almost blind now but he still plays
occasionally and he was talking about a possible tour of Japan with a
group when we spoke with him.
''There are not too many of the sidemen still around so we were
delighted to get these two on tape, particularly as they spent long
periods on the road with Louis in the fifties.''
Burnap was also able to visit Armstrong's home in Corona, part of the
New York suburb of Queens, and also a permanent exhibit of the
trumpeter's memorabilia at the University of Queens.
''Astonishingly,'' he reveals, ''the family home where Louis lived
when he was not on the road with the All Stars was left by his widow
Lucille to the city of New York -- and the city fathers in their wisdom
didn't want it.
''What happened then was that Queens stepped in, the lady who looked
after the house when Lucille was still alive still does that, and if you
call in advance then you can visit. It is beautifully kept and you can
see the room where Louis spent so much of his time practising and
listening to his tapes and records. There are some mementoes scattered
around but it's at the University of Queens that you can see the best of
the material.''
The music, of course, is the raison d'etre for the programmes. And
Burnap and his team have unearthed some previously unissued material,
including a snatch from a Fleishman's Yeast radio programme in the
thirties when Armstrong was the first black entertainer to headline a
sponsored show.
There are stories from New Orleans about Armstrong and his
relationship with King Oliver, from the riverboats where be began his
career, and right up to the showbiz funeral which upset so many of his
closest friends.
''It was a strange business,'' muses Burnap. ''So many of Louis's
friends could not go to the funeral because it became like a
record-company production or something. There were all these
pall-bearers, all celebrities. Strange, strange business and a lot of
people were hurt when they were left out.''
Armstrong himself might have found it bizarre that among the
pall-bearers was Bing Crosby. Certainly Crosby had recorded with
Armstrong, had had the trumpeter on his TV shows and his radio shows and
appeared in films with him including High Society.
But towards the end of his life Armstrong, the simple man from New
Orleans who was somehow touched by genius, used to fret over the fact
that in all the years he had known Crosby he had never once been invited
to his home.
As a musical colleague for ''Papa Bing'' he was fine, mugging happily
for the cameras. As a house guest Armstrong remained persona non grata
and that hurt him deeply.
But the hurt remained hidden, part of the private man whose life we
will know a little more about from this series.

THE Scottish Prison Service was attacked yesterday for its ''heartless
treatment'' on the day it issued a report claiming it was ''extremely
successful''.
The parents of a 17-year-old Kelly Holland, who committed suicide
while on remand in jail, criticised prison leaders and claimed they had
warned officers their daughter was suicidal.
Edward and Isobel Holland, of Hamiton, Lanarkshire, also claimed that
the Scottish Prison Service had still not written to them since, Kelly,
-- who was on remand facing minor charges -- committed suicide on June
23.
They couple said they were angry over the ''heartless'' way the death
was handled by the SPS.
Mr Holland, 44, said: ''Even now, weeks on we still have not been
contacted by the prison authorities.
''There has been no letter, no card, not even a phone call.
''We were given the news early in the morning of her death by the
local police. They gave us a number to call, but said not to phone until
8am. That left us waiting for more than two hours not knowing why our
girl was dead.
''When I went to the prison I couldn't bare to go in. I was handed a
torn plastic bag with Kelly's belongings in it and told to sign a piece
of paper.''
Just four days after Kelly's death another remand prisoner at Cornton
Vale, Arlene Elliot, 17, from Partick, Glasgow, took her own life.
Mrs Holland, 39, said: ''We warned the prison that we felt Kelly was
suicidal, yet she was still able to do it somehow.
''It is almost unbelievable that she could have made this decision and
done it without someone noticing how upset she was.''
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: ''The time this happened is
not covered in the annual report.
''I understand that when Mr Holland went to the prison he was invited
in but refused.
''I cannot comment of any warnings of suicide because the death is the
subject of a Fatal Accident Inquiry.''
In his annual report issued yesterday, Mr Edward Frizzell, chief
executive of the Scottish Prison Service, said that the service had met
and improved all the performance targets set by the Secretary of State
for Scotland during the year to March, covering custody, good order,
care and opportunities.
He said: ''It is hard to measure the success of a prison service which
has to strive to meet a broad range of objectives, against a background
of often contradictory expectations by the public it serves.
''But by any standard, I think it is fair to say that the year was
extremely successful for the Scottish Prison Service, and that the
public was well served.''
Scotland has 19 prisons, ranging from Barlinnie in Glasgow with more
than 900 places, to Friarton in Perth, which houses 60. Run by a staff
of 4500, it costs #165m a year to run, with the average cost per
prisoner place for the current year projected at #26,700.
Last year, almost 5600 were held in Scotland's prisons, of which fewer
than 200 were women, although there were four or five times that number
of remand prisoners.

A TALENTED footballer who wrecked a ''highly-promising'' sporting
career with chronic drink and drug abuse was jailed yesterday at
Inverness Sheriff Court.
The court was told that former Highland League star George Stewart,
27, was tipped for the very top in senior football before a spate of
drink-related offences.
The former Ross County, Nairn, and Clach striker was jailed for three
months for struggling violently with two policemen.
He admitted resisting arrest and breaking the peace last December 30,
as well as 21 previous convictions.
Depute-fiscal Sharon Ralph said Stewart refused to stop shouting and
swearing when police were called to a disturbance outside a house in
Benula Road, Inverness.
Defence agent Jack Gowans told the court: ''He accepts he has chronic
problems with drink and substances, and is taking steps to get help. He
wouldn't say boo to a goose when he is sober.''
And Mr Gowans revealed: ''His highly-promising football career has
been ruined by addiction. He would almost certainly have made the
highest grade.
''He recently relaunched his career and has received glowing reports
in the local press,'' he added.
Stewart made his football comeback this season in the Inverness
Amateur League -- and netted five goals for division two leaders Locheil
just days before his court appearance.
Imposing prison, Sheriff James Fraser said it was his duty to protect
the police and public, adding: ''I'm not really interested in you. If
you are genuine in your desire to reform, you can do so after prison.''

In the first article of a new weekly column, special travel
correspondent Katie Wood looks at some of the best summer deals
available and top holiday destinations for Scottish travellers
LONDON remains the most popular city break destination for Scots, but,
the big dilemma? Should you take a package or DIY?
Keith Prowse Londoners is a new package deal aimed at those who want a
themed break in the capital. This programme has direct connections from
Scotland with prices starting at #169 for two nights' hotel
accommodation, return rail travel, best tickets to either a show,
concert, or sports event. A free London diary of events is thrown in.
Air travel is also available at extra cost. Call 0345 881882.
An alternative is to sort out your own transport (and British Midland
have some good flight deals just now) and book your own accommodation.
One of the best ways to do this just now is to take advantage of the
reduced rates offered by the London Hotels Discounted Reservations Co.
Choose from budget B&amp;Bs to 4-star hotels. Prices start at #32 per person
for a room with a midweek theatre performance thrown in. This same
package including dinner costs #42. Call 0171 454 5000.
* THINKING ahead to winter sun? Dirct Holidays has launched its new
1995-6 Winter Holiday Brochure featuring a range of popular holiday
spots direct to the customer at low prices.
Tenerife, Grand Canary, Lanzarote, Costa Blanca, Majorca, the Algarve,
and Florida are all on offer with prices from #249 for a week. Their
long-stay holiday prices are particularly good, with 35 nights'
self-catering in Grand Canary starting at #319, and 42 nights in the
Algarve from #199. Call 0141 221 0077 for a brochure.
Italy is the bargain of summer '95. The devalued lire makes even our
pound look good, and packages for a bit of la dolce vita are selling
fast. Italian specialist Travair (tel 0141 333 0533) is still the best
bet for direct flights to and from Scotland. It also offers an
accommodation service.
If you want to tour -- a must for regions like Tuscany -- you'll need
a set of wheels. Don't book once you're out there -- prices and
conditions double. Best deal just now comes from Holiday Autos who hire
cars in Italy from #250 a week. Take advantage of their current special
offer and choose a car with air-conditioning for just an additional #1 a
day. Call them on 0171 491 1111.
* FEEL like a last-minute break to the Emerald Isle? Beat this for
value -- Aer Lingus has introduced a new #59 return fare on its
Glasgow-Dublin route. Valid midweek only, it runs until July 20. Travel
agents have details.
* BRITISH Airways is offering a dedicated female chauffeur service for
its women Business passengers as part of the airline's #70m package of
improvements to Club Europe. The limo service will operate from
Edinburgh and Glasgow, with prices for an airport transfer starting at
#39 one-way. It is expected that there will be a high uptake on this new
service by the female executive population which represents 24% of all
passengers travelling on the airline's long-haul Club product.
Perhaps if the service had been complimentary, as it is with some of
the American airlines, the round of applause would have been warmer.
* A T Mays is urging holidaymakers visiting Turkey this summer to take
care with their holiday money. The Turks have introduced their highest
ever denomination note -- for 1,000,000 lire. And before you get too
excited at the prospect of being a Turkish millionaire, bear in mind
it's worth precisely #15.
* IN descending order of popularity after London, the top 10 city
break destinations for Scots are Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin, New York,
Brussels, Copenhagen, Vienna, Prague, Rome, and Berlin.
Dublin has seen a tremendous increase this year, but Paris and
Amsterdam remain the top favourites, as they have for the past decade.
Crystal Premier Cities are better priced than most operators who put
together Scottish departure city breaks. A typical two-night package
with them to Paris in the three-star Hotel des Flandres comes in at #149
for B&amp;B with flights from Edinburgh/Glasgow. The price includes arrival
coach transfers. Call 0181 390 9900.
* IT'S official. Visitors to Scotland should receive the warmest
welcome in the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Tourist Board-backed programme ''Welcome Host'' trains
people in the front line of tourism -- from hotel receptionists to taxi
drivers; ScotRail officials to pub landlords. Local enterprise
companies, area tourist boards and large tourism businesses have now
trained more than 10,000 Scots from all sectors of the tourism industry
in the best practice in customer care. Compared to the numbers from
England and Wales, Scotland is well ahead.
* GILL Airways has just introduced a new service from Prestwick to
Belfast City Airport. Three flights a day will run Monday-Friday and
five on weekends, taking 35 minutes on the 36-seat plane. Fares are a
reasonable #29 single, with a fully flexible fare of #49.
Newcastle-based Gill Airways currently operates services between
Aberdeen-Newcastle and Wick-Newcastle, and it recently took over the
Edinburgh-Leeds/Bradford service from Air UK. Travel agents have
details.
* DIG out that feather boa! There's a special offer running just now
which is ideal if you want to celebrate a special occasion around the
middle of September. How does a trip on the Orient Express to Venice
grab you?
A special discounted holiday is departing September 14 offering
savings of #250 per person on this date. This brings the price down to
#1170 for a four-night break which includes a flight to London, travel
on board the great train to Venice, all meals, three nights' B&amp;B in
Venice at the Hotel American, and a return scheduled flight to Glasgow.
Travel agents have details.

A STUDENT who acted the good Samaritan, and went to help a crying
woman, had his throat slashed with a broken bottle, a court has heard.
His attacker, William Whalen, 22, had misunderstood the situation. He
was ordered yesterday at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to be sent to the High
Court for sentence.
He had pleaded guilty at an earlier court appearance to assaulting the
student, Mr Scott McEwan, 21, in Guthrie Street, Edinburgh, on March 5,
by striking him about the head and body with a broken bottle to his
severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
Whalen, who is in custody, also admitted assaulting another man with a
bottle on February 4 in Tron Square and robbing him of his jacket and
wallet.
In connection with the assault on Mr McEwan, the court was told the
student heard a commotion and saw the accused running in the street. He
also saw a woman crying and looking upset.
He approached her and asked if she was all right and if she wanted to
call the police.
Whalen came back brandishing a bottle. He pushed Mr McEwan against a
wall, smashed the bottle, and then stabbed him with it on the face and
neck. One of the cuts to the throat severed the muscle near the jugular
vein.
Solicitor for Whalen, Ms Sandra Walker, said her client did not have a
great deal of recollection about the attacks. On both occasions he had
been drinking heavily. ''He appears to become a different person when he
drinks,'' she said.
The accused and the woman had been in a group on the evening of the
attack on Mr McEwan. They became involved with another group of youths,
an argument developed and the woman was slapped. Whalen, she said, ran
after the person who slapped her.
''He came back to see this man opposite his girlfriend and got totally
the wrong end of the stick,'' Ms Walker said.
Sheriff Andrew Lothian said he was sending Whalen to the High Court
for sentence as he had pled guilty to an assault with a bottle in order
to rob, and deliberately breaking a bottle and using it to inflict
appalling injuries.

ACTOR Marlon Brando says he is seriously contemplating seeking Irish
citizenship.
Brando, 71, currently shooting the film Divine Rapture in the County
Cork village of Ballycotton, said he may formalise moves towards an
application before leaving the country next month.
He said he felt an overwhelming ''rush of emotion'' on arriving in
Ireland earlier this month, the Irish Independent reported.
''I have never felt at home really in the places I've been,'' said the
Hollywood star, whose great-grandfather, Myles O'Gahan, was born in
Dublin.
''I was brought up Irish. My grandmother was full of Irish
expressions, and it was very striking when I got off the plane. The
words came to me 'I'm home'.''
The normally reclusive star added: ''It means moving a lot of
furniture around, but I think it might very well be worth it, because
what's worth anything more than feeling at home?''

A BARBECUE explosion badly burned a 13-year-old boy and injured three
adults involved in a Salvation Army camping trip that was visiting
Nottinghamshire.
Barry Graham, 13, of Dundee, remains in the intensive care unit of a
Nottingham hospital with burns to his face, neck and back.
His condition was described as ''poorly but stable''.
Mr Ian Perry, of Pitkerro Road, Dundee, the leader of the group of 11
children and four adults, is in the same hospital with serious 18% burns
to his arms, hands, and chest.
His wife, Marion, who was with the group, was treated for shock, while
another adult helper, Mr Graham Chapman, was treated for superficial
burns after the incident on Thursday night.
Last night, Major Ronald Smith, the Salvation Army district commander
for the North of Scotland, pledged there would be an inquiry into the
accident.
It is believed that white spirit was used to ignite a barbecue at the
Thorntons Hall Caravan Park, Cropwell Bishop, Nottinghamshire.

RAIL services ground to a complete halt in Scotland yesterday as
members of the Aslef train drivers' union staged the first in a series
of one-day strikes over pay.
Their action paralysed virtually the whole of British Rail's network
and cost the company a total of #10m in lost revenue.
A senior ScotRail official warned that jobs could be at risk because
of the stoppages, which will cost the Scottish operation #400,000 each
day.
Mr Peter Summerhayes, director of operations and engineering, said
yesterday's action, which involved about 900 Aslef members in Scotland,
was especially costly because of disruption to the start of the Glasgow
Fair and to events such as the Tall Ships Race at Leith and the Scottish
Open at Carnoustie.
He expressed deep concern and said the two sides must have further
talks.
''Just standing off each other is getting us nowhere and it's no way
to conclude an industrial dispute,'' he said. ''The only people who are
winning at this particular time are our competitors and they are hungry
for our traffic.''
Financial losses would have to be made up and jobs were being put at
risk by Aslef action, he said. It was extremely disappointing,
especially as ScotRail had been forced to re-build the business after
the ''financial disasters'' of last year's lengthy signal worker's
dispute.
''We are only just recovering passengers' confidence in some of our
express routes after the problems of last year,'' he said. ''When our
customers can't get a service, they will find an alternative. Good
pricing and reliable services are the only way to get them back.''
Mr Pat O'Connor, Aslef's Scottish district secretary, said there had
been 100% support for the strike.
He said the drivers were fully resolved to continue with the planned
stoppages. He added: ''As far as they are concerned, they are the ones
who made #362m profit for BR and they will stay out until they get their
fair share of that profit.
''We regret any inconvenience caused to the travelling public,
especially here in Scotland where it is the start of the Glasgow Fair.''
He said the day of the first strike had not been of Aslef's choosing,
with the start of the series having been postponed because BR had sought
an interdict on a legal technicality.
He said Aslef remained willing to speak to BR at any time and wanted
an early resolution to the dispute.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said normal operations would resume today,
although eight early-morning services, all on the Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Executive network and before 6.30am, had been cancelled.
The rail strike seemed to have little impact on road traffic levels in
Scotland, but some bus operators took the opportunity to lay on extra
coaches.
An Automobile Association spokeswoman said traffic levels had been
normal in the East of Scotland. In the West, it had actually been
quieter than usual, probably because many people had the day off for the
Glasgow Fair holiday. However, widespread flooding had caused problems
for drivers.
Mr Alasdair Henderson, general manager of the Scottish Citylink bus
company, said it had about 70 extra coaches operating across Scotland.
Some of the additional services had been planned to cope with extra
holiday demand, but others were laid on for the increased commuter
traffic.
Fair Friday is one of the busiest days of the year for Glasgow
Airport, which yesterday handled about 30,000 passengers. Storms over
the Atlantic caused delays on a couple of Canadian flights but
everything else went smoothly, said an airport spokesman. He added that
the rail strike had not made any significant difference to the numbers
of people flying.
There was only one passenger train running on a Railtrack line in
Scotland yesterday -- the steam train operated by West Coast Railways on
the line between Fort William and Mallaig.
The only other movements on Scottish tracks were a freight train from
Coatbridge to Southampton and a mail train running between Glasgow and
London Euston. Their drivers have not been involved in the recent
ballot.
The only BR trains to run yesterday were operated by drivers belonging
to the RMT rail union. South East Trains was able to run just 10 of its
normal 1700 daily services. Some other English regions also managed to
run a very limited service.
The next strike is planned for Tuesday. The others are scheduled for
July 27, August 8, August 25, and September 12.

FLASH floods and torrential rain brought chaos to parts of Scotland
yesterday as motorists, householders, and emergency services were caught
out by the rising waters.
Seven people, including a pregnant woman, were taking to hospital
after Kirkcaldy Telephone Exchange was struck by a bolt of lightning.
In Strathclyde the Erskine Bridge and Clyde Tunnel were closed.
Motherwell, Renfrew, and Glasgow city centre were among a large number
of areas hit by floods.
Flood waters returned to Paisley's Ferguslie Park for the second time
in seven months stranding cars and causing panic among residents.
Almost one inch of rain fell on the central belt during a thunder
storm lasting just one hour, said Glasgow Weather Centre.
In Strathclyde houses were threatened by floods, dozens of roads
closed, and power supplies to businesses cut during the deluge.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said: ''Flood water has closed a
number of roads throughout the region and water has broken through roofs
of some shops and houses. A large number of vehicles have been stranded
due to the deep water. There have been no major evacuations.''
Lightning strikes were reported all over the Central Belt. In Glasgow
city centre a number of offices in St Vincent Street were evacuated
after being hit. In Kirkcaldy the people involved, some of whom got
minor electric shocks, were taken to hospital. However, it is believed
it was merely as a precautionary measure.
The latest downpour hit Ferguslie Park only 10 days after the Queen
visited the area to see the effects of the clean up after December's
flood.
Within minutes of the rain starting yesterday Candren Road, an area
very badly hit in the previous floods, was under two to three feet of
water provoking anger from residents.
Many families are still waiting to return to homes extensively damaged
by the floods in December. They could not believe it had happened again.
Mr John Swanson and his wife Kathleen lost all their belongings to the
last flood, but were expecting to return to their home later this month.
''We are devastated by this,'' said Mrs Swanson.''We are staying in a
house nearby and came down here right away to see what was happening.
''We were told it would never happen again and couldn't wait to get
back to our house,'' said Mr Swanson. ''Now we can't come back to
this.''
''We didn't have any insurance. We couldn't afford it. What are we
going to do now. Pull our furniture up the stairs every time it rains?''
Although he floodwater lapped around the doorsteps of houses in
Candren Street it did not enter any of the homes.
Ms Jayney Mains, 21, was pregnant in December when the flood hit and
had to be rescued by firefighters in a rowing boat.
Yesterday she watched as the waters rose again. ''The water bubbled up
through the road. It was incredible. Like a tide. It is ridiculous that
it has happened again and the reason is nothing has been done since the
last flood.''
Ferguslie councillor Olga Clayton said that although a report had
commissioned into December's flooding as far as she knew there had been
no flood prevention works built.
''People have no confidence to go back to their homes after this I can
understand that. If I lived in one of these houses I don't think I would
want to go back into them. There has to be something really wrong there
that has to be tackled.''

<TEXT>
HARLEY Street surgeon Nicholas Siddle was ordered to be struck off the
Medical Register with immediate effect yesterday after being found
guilty of serious misconduct following a series of bungled ''keyhole''
operations on women patients.
Mr Siddle, 46, a father of three, was found guilty yesterday after a
five-day hearing of the General Medical Council's Professional Conduct
Committee.
The committee heard that seven of his patients suffered damage during
operations at three London hospitals between September 1991 and December
1992.
After deliberating for slightly less than an hour the committee found
him guilty and ordered that his name should be struck off the register.
Chairman Sir Herbert Duthie said that, for the protection of the
public, his registration should be suspended with immediate effect.
Mr Siddle stood with head bowed as Sir Herbert spoke of the
committee's great concern at his ''catalogue of failures'' in both pre
and post-operative care and his surgical skills in both laparoscopic
(keyhole) and open surgery.
His standard of care for the seven patients had fallen grossly below a
standard the public was entitled to expect of their doctors and which
the medical profession expected of its members.
Mr Siddle has 28 days to appeal but he said he would not be exercising
that right.
He said his first thoughts and sympathies were for the three patients
who had suffered physical injury.
He said he wanted to stress to women facing keyhole surgery in the
next few weeks that it was not particularly difficult or dangerous and
they should not be put off.
''I am clearly very disappointed that the committee has not seen fit
to act on the recommendation of my counsel to allow me to retrain.
''I wish to thank the very many patients and colleagues who have
supported me through recent times,'' he added.
Earlier, it was alleged that the committee may have been ''grossly
misled'' about offers of retraining.
The committee heard that it had been agreed by the St Vernon's
Hospital Trust, Watford, and St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, to undertake
a year long programme of retraining.
But it ruled that the messages from the two hospitals were not
relevant to its deliberations on serious professional misconduct.
Consultants in keyhole surgery from Watford General Hospital and St
Peter's had said it had been agreed that, if Mr Siddle was not struck
off, the hospitals would be willing to offer him retraining for up to a
year.
However, after a series of tense talks behind closed doors, and an
exchange of faxes between the hospitals and the committee, CMC barrister
Miss Rosalind Foster said she was ''deeply concerned'' at new
information that had come to light.
It appeared the St Vernon's Hospital Group was not happy at claims
that it had agreed to allow one of its consultants to act as an external
assessor as well as a superviser of #130,000-a-year Mr Siddle.
Mr Kieran Coonan, QC, for Mr Siddle, said: ''We do not accept for one
moment that this committee has been misled.''
Mr Siddle qualified in Liverpool in 1972 and was admitted as a member
of the Royal College of Gynaecologists in 1977.
Yesterday, the committee heard that the operations by Mr Siddle, a
former consultant at University College Hospital, London, left women
with a variety of injuries.
He had admitted a number of the charges against him.
Psychiatrist James Griffith-Edwards, who examined him in the summer of
last year, said he found no sign of mental illness.
But he did find signs of ''stress reaction'' which he thought
understandable considering the ''package of slings and arrows'' he had
suffered.
These included the death of his prematurely-born twins, the break-up
of his marriage and financial problems.
Professor Henry Brant, former chief consultant at UCH, said he and
colleagues repeatedly tried to warn Mr Siddle that further ''disasters''
were likely if he carried on with his surgery in the same way.
But his reaction was partly ''what proof have you got that this is no
good or that is no good'', he said.

A SCHOOLBOY who raped a nine-year-old girl was freed yesterday after a
judge told him: ''Be a decent fellow.''
The 13-year-old boy carried out a catalogue of sex offences against
the girl, Mr Paul Lewis, prosecuting, said at Cardiff Crown Court. An
initial indecent assault had led to full sexual intercourse.
The boy admitted a single charge of rape and was sentenced to a
three-year supervision order at Cardiff Crown Court.
Judge Mr Justice Jowitt told him: ''You behaved wickedly and were
dirty-minded. You have to learn that sexual desires must be put aside at
your age. You must learn to control your urges.
''It may sound old-fashioned, but think about purity and being a
decent fellow.''
Mr Lewis said: ''The incident came to light when the young girl's
mother found the teenage boy performing a sexual act in front of her
daughter.
''The little girl told the police that such behaviour had been taking
place for some time. She said she didn't tell anyone as the boy
threatened to kill her.''
Mr Lewis said the girl then told officers the boy had also forced her
to have full sex.
''The little girl says the teenager grabbed her arms and held her
down,'' he said. ''She was screaming and kicking but she could not push
him away.
''Asked how many times this had happened to her, she told the police:
'Around 20'.''

A TARGET of 5000 new recruits today has been set by the Scottish Blood
Transfusion Service in what has been designated UK new blood donor day.
In the first joint campaign of its kind organised by the four UK
transfusion services, a total of 50,000 donors -- of blood or pledges
for the future -- are the target in today's drive.
Ms Moira Eadie, donor services manager for Glasgow and the West of
Scotland, said that 40,000 new donors, aged 17 to 60, would be needed in
Scotland in 1995 to maintain the supply of blood, plasma and specialised
blood products.
Among the most frequent beneficiaries are babies in neo-natal care
units, for whom the service now is supplying blood in mini-sized sachets
so that whole units do not have to be discarded with only a little used.
Dr Charles Skeoch, a paediatrician at Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital
and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, said: ''They have so little
blood to start with, and we have to take samples so often to monitor
their condition, that we just have to top it up.''
Sometimes Dr Skeoch's patients need something a bit special -- like
the Cook twins, Shannon and Declan, who were born at Rottenrow five
months ago.
They were quickly recognised as having thrombocytopaenia, a rare but
potentially fatal disorder leading to loss of platelets (blood cells
which control clotting) and internal bleeding. They needed the help of a
particular donor, one of a number whose names are kept by the service
and who have a particular ingredient in their blood.
Fortunately, the donor was at home and she was quickly brought into
Glasgow to have a donation taken for Shannon and Declan.
Their parents, Gordon and Janice, waited anxiously, knowing that the
lives of their babies -- their first -- hung in the balance. Mr Cook
said yesterday: ''They were given the transfusion of platelets over a
period of a week and came on by leaps and bounds.''
Special donor and pledge sessions are being set up today at the donor
centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and at various points in towns and
cities throughout the country.

ROOM to let in extremely swish Edinburgh New Town flat. Nae workies,
nae schemies, nae radge scruff. Applicants must be prepared to undergo a
competitive audition; mysterious junkies with suitcases full of money
preferred.
Flatmates are difficult, aren't they? Couch Potato is far too grand to
live in rented rooms nowadays, but in our student days these matters
were always arranged on a gentlemanly and informal basis -- amiability,
a good stereo, and trustworthiness in the matter of other people's
girlfriends were the main criteria for being invited to take up a
vacancy at the festering Dennistoun hellhole we called the Harcourt
Drive Hilton. Put an ad in the papers and you never know who's going to
turn up; and if you don't like them, how do you put it kindly?
Not that that consideration bothers the unspeakable Yuppies From Hell
in Danny Boyle's elegantly nasty and very funny Edinburgh thriller
Shallow Grave (rental, cert 18). When interviewing candidates attracted
by the advertisement of which the above is a slightly more candid
version, the three of them -- doctor Kerry Fox, accountant Christopher
Eccleston, and journalist Ewan McGregor -- line up like a Higher Civil
Service interview panel and conduct the interviews on the principles of
the Theatre of Cruelty -- thereby cunningly ensuring that none of us
will get upset at anything that happens to them.
Which is just as well; because, soon after picking mystery man Keith
Allen as their new chum, they find him dead in his room with a suitcase
full of someone else's money under his bed, and the stage is set for a
delicious comedy of class and conscience as one little sin leads to
another, with Nemesis never more than one plot twist behind.
Conquering their professional scruples with remarkably little
difficulty, our chums decide to keep the money and get rid of the body
(leading to a hideously crunchy scene at dead of night in the woods near
Edinburgh), but living with the secret proves difficult, and soon our
playmates are fit to cut each other's throats -- which is really pretty
superfluous, there being certain third parties only too willing to do
that for them. Being rich suddenly begins to take second place to
staying alive, and that on a purely individual basis.
Sharp as a cleaver and fast as a bullet, Shallow Grave is the most
entertaining and sophisticated crime comedy since Pulp Fiction, and
packs a sardonic little message about respectability and hypocrisy
beneath the mirth and mayhem. Strongly recommended.
Cult corner: Fox Video have upstaged Batman Forever with the re-issue
of the Zap! Po! Zowie camp classic Batman -- The Movie (1966, #10.99,
cert U), a feature-length pilot for the Bat-tastic TV series starring
Adam West and Burt Ward. Bat-tling an unholy alliance of Bat-villains
The Joker, The Riddler, The Penguin, and Catwoman, our heroes save the
planet for the first of many times. Rubber sharks, surf-instrumental
soundtrack, secret weapons, a nutty professor . . . this is the best fun
you can have with one of your mum's old sheets on.

TWO sailors were hailed as heroes last night after they rescued an
82-year-old woman who slipped and fell into the water at the Tall Ships
race site in Edinburgh.
The woman fell between the quayside at the Albert Dock, Leith, and one
of the tall ships around 2pm. Two crew members of a nearby yacht jumped
into the water to rescue her. She suffered grazing to her arm.
A police spokesman said the men would be considered for a police
meritorious award.
Meanwhile, the Earl and Countess of Rosebery have turned the grounds
of their estate overlooking the Firth of Forth into a public grandstand
for the Tall Ships Race.
They are hoping to pull in around #100,000 in gate money from
thousands of sightseers keen to watch the ships under sail shortly
before Princess Anne signals the start of the race next Tuesday.
And they claim the grounds of Dalmeny House, between Cramond and South
Queensferry, is the best vantage point for anyone wanting a close-up of
the spectacle, and have spent months creating 10,000 parking spaces.
Charges will be #10 per car and #20 for a minibus.
But yesterday Lady Rosebery insisted there was no question of them
cashing in.
She pointed out that promoters of the event had urged them to create
parking space and the #2-a-head charge to the many expected to arrive on
foot was going to three of her pet charities -- Edinburgh's St Columba's
Hospice, the Thistle Foundation, which provides housing for the
disabled, and the South Queensferry inshore rescue boat.

<HEADLINE>Woolworth's murder trial told of fatal knife attack at the till. Victim seen as 'robbery hazard'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977387777</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAN knifed a young assistant manager to death in a Woolworth's store
because he saw him as a ''have-a-go hero'', a court was told yesterday.
The prosecution alleged Mr Ian Kay, 28, told police he carried a knife
and expected to use it if anyone got in his way on a robbery.
Mr Martin Heslop, QC, prosecuting at the Old Bailey, said Mr Kay had
boasted to police he would never harm women or the elderly, but regarded
his 22-year-old victim, Mr John Penfold, as ''fair game and a necessary
hazard in a robbery''.
Quoting Mr Kay's alleged statements to police, Mr Heslop said: ''If
someone wants to be a hero, you just have to stop them, because at the
end of the day you have got to get away . . . It was do or die.''
The prosecutor went on: ''He said, in chilling terms, that if someone
was stupid enough to have a go and try to stop him, he described him as
a have-a-go hero, then they got what they deserved.''
However, Mr Heslop said one witness alleged Mr Penfold did not
confront the defendant.
Mr Kay denies the murder on November 3 last year.
Mr Penfold had worked for Woolworths since starting as a Saturday boy
at 16. He rose quickly through the ranks and was a likeable, intelligent
young man with obvious potential, the jury was told.
He was appointed assistant manager at the store in Teddington, west
London, in August last year. Three months later he collapsed dying from
a stab wound through the heart.
''I went for the money, he went for me, so I stabbed him,'' Mr Kay,
from Bracknell, Berkshire, allegedly told police.
Mr Heslop said the defendant had said he had no regrets. He told the
jury the issue to decide was not if Mr Kay stabbed Mr Penfold, but
whether he was guilty of murder or the lesser offence of manslaughter.
He had been examined by several psychiatrists and all agreed he was
suffering from a personality disorder but had reached different
conclusions about his state of mind.
He had targeted Woolworth's stores, which he saw as easy prey, during
a three-month robbery spree which began soon after he left prison.
Mr Kay has admitted all the other offences, the prosecution said,
apart from one raid on a supermarket at High Wycombe.
Part of his pattern was to warn people he had a knife and would use
it, Mr Heslop said.
''All this shows that the violence on November 3, which resulted in
John Penfold's death, was calculated aggression in the course of
robbery,'' he added.
Earlier that day, Mr Kay had tried to rob another Woolworth's branch
at Yiewsley, Middlesex, but was thwarted by a female cashier.
He angrily searched for a new target, said Mr Heslop. ''Eventually and
unfortunately for John Penfold, he picked Teddington.''
Student and part-time assistant Julia Bovis, 19, was on her second day
working at the store when Mr Penfold approached her till with a bag of
#1 coins.
''As the till drawer was about to be opened the defendant, no doubt
spotting his chances, approached with a bag of Quavers,'' she said.
Miss Bovis said he threw the Quavers on the counter and Mr Penfold,
believing he was a customer, told her to serve him.
''At that point the defendant, armed with this knife, lunged forward
at John Penfold,'' Mr Heslop said. ''He made a fast jabbing movement
towards him, connecting with his chest. Mr Penfold groaned and staggered
back -- he had been fatally stabbed in the heart.''
As Miss Bovis pushed herself away from the till, Kay reached over,
grabbed #165 and ran off.
''According to Julia, John Penfold did nothing to provoke the attack,
did nothing to confront the defendant and he obviously had no chance to
defend himself,'' Mr Heslop said.
Mr Penfold's parents were in court as the trial started.
0 The trial continues.

* SCOTTISH schoolchildren are pushing back the frontiers of science to
help shape the next century. They are among nearly 100,000 youngsters
throughout the UK who have experienced how technology works in the real
world, thanks to financial aid from the Toyota Science and Technology
Fund.
The fund, aimed at nurturing young people's enthusiasm for science,
has been extended for another three years, bringing its total cash aid
to schools to #1.2 million.
In the past year alone, more than 25 Scottish schools have taken part
in projects through the fund, organised by the Scottish Education
Business Partnership. From Thurso to Dumfries, pupils are getting
hands-on technical experience in an array of disciplines in the
nationwide drive to encourage more talent into technology and
engineering and related sciences.
The manager of Dunbartonshire Education Business Partnership, Mhairi
Robertson, tells us that projects include a study of plastics by primary
seven children in Rhu Primary, circuit design, construction and testing
in Dumbarton Academy and the use of amplifiers to produce signal
conditioning in St Andrew's High School, Clydebank.
These and other projects are, according to the government's Office of
Public Service and Science, ''vital'' to the need to encourage the
innovative scientists and engineers of tomorrow.
According to government research, too few young people are attracted
to science subjects, having been put off at an early age. As a
consequence, they say, Britain is falling behind its competitors in the
proportion of the population qualifying in technology subjects,
hindering its ability to exploit technology for wealth creation and
economic growth.
The science fund, set up in 1992, provides grants of up to #1500 for
primary and secondary schools, and each grant enables individual or
groups of local schools to undertake projects with local businesses. In
the classroom, it aims to raise the motivation and self-confidence of
pupils.
* THE first Internet awards for excellence on the Web have been
created by iced-tea makers Liptons. The Liptonice Cubes have been
developed to recognise the best on the information superhighway, like a
top ten for netsurfers.
The first list includes the Tele-Garden for webbers to tend their own
horticultural space, with a virtual garden that can be watered and
maintained using a robotic arm. The Virtual Pub has a guide to bars,
brewing tips and lists of tasting events. Liptonice also rate the Tarot
Site, for astrology fans, and for real anoraks there's the Contact
Project for UFO seekers who want to try to decipher an alleged message
from the Tau Ceti system somewhere out there.
Red Planet, coming in at number five, lets you enter a virtual world
and pretend to be on Mars, which is actually number four in the solar
array.
The Spot is, allegedly, the on-line version of real-life soap operas.
In this Web site, a group of people living in a house together recount
their daily experiences on-line while the rest of the world looks on.
Sounds as interesting as watching brown paint dry and listening to Lloyd
Grossman, all at once.
Autopilot, also appearing on the list, apparently takes the
''drudgery'' out of net surfing by loading a random page every 12
seconds. If it's drudgery, why do people bother, one wonders?
Bartlett's Familiar Quotations Site is claimed to be a favourite with
literature buffs looking for inspiration. We thought literature buffs
would tend to read books, instead of hooking in to cyber-vacuum all day.
The Liptonice Cube list will be updated weekly by votes from Internet
users. Fascinating.

JOHN REDWOOD yesterday reinforced his bid to be seen as the leader of
the Conservative right when he criticised the role of the Nolan
Committee and, by implication, the Prime Minister, who set it up.
He insisted that Parliament alone should judge the conduct of MPs and
''not look to others above it to regulate its conduct''.
Following his leadership challenge to Mr Major, Mr Redwood's stand
will strike a chord with many Conservative back-bench MPs who are
incensed that the committee has been set up as a watchdog of MPs'
behaviour, something traditionally dealt with by the Commons itself.
He spoke out as the Commons prepared to debate on Wednesday the report
on Nolan of the Commons Privileges Committee.
The Government is expected to invite the House to accept the select
committee's recommendation that further work needs to be done on
implementing Nolan's proposed curbs on MPs' consultancy work.
This was carried by the Conservative members of the committee,
supported by the Liberal Democrat member Mr Robert Maclennan, against
the angry opposition of the Labour members.
The Opposition intends to table an amendment for the debate urging
that individual MPs should declare their total earnings from
consultancies.
The outcome of the vote is made more uncertain by the possibility that
some Conservative MPs, who are unhappy about some of their colleagues'
undeclared work, might support the Opposition.
The prospect of Nolan having a continuing remit to scrutinise MPs'
behaviour rankles with many Conservative MPs, and some have been
pressing the Government to wind up the committee after it has conducted
some other scheduled investigations, one into the conduct of local
government.
Mr Redwood joined those who fear that too many restrictions on MPs
activities could see the creation of a purely political specialist House
of Commons.
He plans to further bolster his claim to be champion of the Tory right
with two fringe meetings at the Conservative Party conference in the
autumn.

HEALTH Secretary Stephen Dorrell last night demanded reports from six
hospitals, including one in Scotland, where samples from patients were
wrongly diagnosed.
Thousands of cases are having to be reviewed after the discovery of
alleged errors by a locum consultant pathologist, Dr Samuel Kiberu, who
has been suspended.
Mr Dorrell's request came as the Royal College of Pathologists said it
had repeatedly warned the Government and hospital trusts against using
stand-in pathologists.
Dr Kiberu worked for a short period at the Victoria Hospital in
Kirkcaldy in 1991, after qualifying as a laboratory pathologist.
However, medical specialists in Fife said yesterday there was no concern
about the results of the 278 tissue specimens he examined.
A spokesman for Fife Health Care admitted it had discussed the
situation with the Victoria Hospital Trust. He added: ''Dr Kiberu made
one slight misinterpretation of a slide during his time at the hospital.
That, however, was only one error among 278 specimens he dealt with,
and, in any event, the female patient was treated successfully.''
Mr Dorrell said: ''I have great sympathy with the patients involved,
and their relatives. I have asked for reports on Dr Kiberu's work in the
NHS and I have no further comment to make on this case until I have
studied those reports.''
He added: ''Patients and the public have a right to expect their
doctors' professional performance is of the highest quality. The
Government will continue to take any action necessary to safeguard the
right of patients to the highest quality of professional care.''
Earlier, Mr Keith Lockyer, secretary of the Royal College of
Pathologists, said: ''The college is very concerned about this affair
and the whole question of locum cover.
''We have made representations to the Government and trusts on
numerous occasions, saying hospitals should be staffed up so that
pathology care is adequate.''
Grantham and District Hospital, Lincolnshire, has discovered 74
potentially serious errors and asked for checks to be carried out on
those patients. Fifteen more mistakes came to light at Bassetlaw
Hospital, Nottinghamshire.

<TEXT>
A MAN who overcharged for plumbing work was sentenced at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court yesterday to nine months in prison.
Ricky Venters, of Caledonian Road, Edinburgh, admitted at an earlier
appearance that he attempted to obtain #2770 from a couple by fraud and
obtained #1000 from an 87-year-old man by fraud.
The offences took place in Edinburgh between March and December 1993.
0 In the case of the 87-year-old man, Venters had turned up at his
door offering a free check of his drains with a closed-circuit
television probe system. Afterwards, he said that work was needed and
the man later received a bill for #1000.
Advocate Martin Jones, appearing for Venters, said the work done was,
to some extent, required.
He told Sheriff Iain Macphail, QC, that his client had no experience
of drainage work.
He was now living on state benefits, but had saved #297 to
''demonstrate his real intention of paying back this elderly
gentleman''.
Mr Jones suggested that Venters could be placed on community service
with a compensation order.
He was married with two children but was willing to repay the amount
at #15 a week.
Sheriff Macphail pointed out that Venters had previous convictions for
dishonesty and that he had admitted an attempted fraud and actual fraud
where he obtained #1000 from a victim aged 87.
He said that the only appropriate sentence was custodial.
He sentenced Venters to four months for the attempted fraud and nine
months for the actual fraud, the sentences to run concurrently.

HAVE you heard the one about the comedian with depression? An
industrial tribunal did yesterday.
Mr William Dewar, of Elizabeth Drive, Boghall, Bathgate, claimed he
was unfairly constructively dismissed by Brake Brothers Food Service
Ltd, of Bellshill, Lanarkshire, in February this year.
The company, which delivers frozen foods to hotels, restaurants, and
works canteens, claimed that he resigned voluntarily.
Let us tell you a story . . . in October 1992, Mr Dewar gave up his
day job when he was promoted to night stores chargehand by Mr Kenneth
Anderson, the manager at the Broxburn depot.
Concerns were later expressed about the way Mr Dewar was carrying out
his chargehand duties and the lack of communication with Mr Lynch, his
immediate superior.
Following an incident in May last year, when Mr Dewar was alleged to
have sworn and thrown boxes at a fellow employee, he was demoted to
night storeman.
After this, his attendance record deteriorated and he was called to a
disciplinary hearing and given a written warning. He went off sick again
and, from November 18 last year until February 16 this year, when his
employment terminated, he was continuously absent with depression.
Then something funny happened. The tribunal noted: ''Shortly after the
applicant went off on sick leave on November 18, the respondents learned
that he was appearing as a stand-up comedian at a club.
''The respondents also had a request from an employment agency for a
reference for the applicant.''
The tears of a clown notwithstanding, the company decided to obtain an
independent medical opinion.
The outcome of this was that Mr Dewar believed there was ''an
irrevocable breakdown'' in his relationship with Mr Anderson, and that,
rather than any clearly defined illness, was causing the sickness
absence.
A meeting was arranged involving senior members of the company, Mr
Dewar, and a union representative -- who was told by Mr Dewar that he
''was adamant that he was resigning''.
The tribunal faced the decision: was it the sack, in which case it
could hand out a bag of compensation cash? Or the shepherd's crook and,
Mr Dewar, kindly leave the stage.
Suffice to say that the company had the last laugh.

And like their big brothers, they are just as valuable and worth
conserving, supporting a whole range of plants, insects and animals,
from carnivorous sundews to dragonflies, butterflies, and birds.
They are Scotland's raised bogs. Not very glamorous, and often seen by
farmers, mining companies, and those who want to turn the peat reserves
they contain into garden compost, as pretty useless in their natural
state.
That's the major problem for conservationists -- how to persuade the
public and the politicians that these maligned and misunderstood
habitats, with their globally unique ecology, are not just unpleasant
pieces of unproductive waste ground.
Unless the message gets across, we could lose them for good with
tragic environmental consequences. ''If all the damage stopped tomorrow,
50 or 100 years down the line we would still lose all our raised bogs,''
says Nigel Doar, campaign co-ordinator for the Scottish Wildlife Trust.
''The only way we are going to conserve this internationally important
resource is to increase public awareness and increase political
pressure.''
Raised bogs have been created over thousands of years. They develop in
waterlogged conditions where plants -- mostly sphagnum mosses -- which
carpet the bog surface, slowly decay, forming layers of organic matter
-- peat. As the peat accumulates the bog literally rises from the
surrounding land.
It is an incredible natural preservative, providing a valuable source
of archive material for historical study. Peat bogs have produced some
of the most spectacular finds of British archaeology, including
remarkably well-preserved bodies of some of our ancestors.
But they are a dwindling natural landscape feature. During the past
150 years, 96% of the UK's raised bogs have been destroyed, largely due
to drainage and conversion to agriculture and forestry. In recent years,
however, losses to these uses have diminished, with the new focus of
attention on peat extraction for horticulture.
The scale of destruction has been mirrored or exceeded in the rest of
the European Community. Of the remaining British bogs, no less than
two-thirds are to be found in Scotland, placing the nation high on the
world stage for this form of habitat.
The Scottish Wildlife Trust has long recognised the importance of
raised bogs, and has been bringing them into conservation management for
20 years. The combination of their habitat value, fragility, and
increasing rarity resulted in funding from the European Union to conduct
a two-year conservation project in Scotland which culminates this month.
From July 24-27, a high-profile international Peatlands Convention
will take place in Edinburgh, to be attended by peatland experts and
policy makers from 16 countries worldwide. Bubbling botanist,
conservationist, and TV personality, Professor David Bellamy, will
deliver the opening address.
The conference, according to Nigel Doar, is not just going to be a
talking shop but a ''springboard into the future'' to get things done.
Continuing the momentum, the conference will be followed, on July 30,
by International Bog Day, now into its fourth year and the centrepiece
of the UK Peatlands Campaign. A number of events are planned for
Scotland, co-ordinated by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, celebrating the
wonders of peatland habitats and transmitting the message that peat is
better left in bogs than spread around domestic gardens.
Standing in an Edinburgh B&amp;Q store at Easter, selling peat
substitutes, Doar and his colleagues got a good response. ''Most people
said that if they had a product of the same price and the same quantity,
that would perform the same purpose, they would buy it if it was
environmentally sound.''
Alternative products on offer are things like composted wood waste and
coconut fibre. ''There was a huge problem at first in that most of the
alternatives hadn't been tried,'' says Doar, ''but now there are quite a
few companies who have developed very good alternatives which have come
up performing just as well as peat in several trials.''
Domestic gardeners and corporate local authority gardeners -- large
users of peat -- were recognised by SWT early on as the main targets for
influence on the issue of bog conservation. Now six Scottish local
authorities have signed a ''peat protection charter'' which commits them
to ''certain principles of good behaviour'' as Doar puts it.
But domestic and local-authority use of peat is by no means the only
threat to raised bogs.
''One threat Scotland has that virtually nobody else has is open-cast
mining,'' says Doar. With deep mining largely a thing of the past and
with mining companies ever on the lookout to exploit coal reserves
nearer the surface, the threat is always present. At Greenhead Moss in
Motherwell, for instance, ironically next to a local nature reserve, the
peat bog has been getting smaller and smaller.
Doar describes Drumshangie Moss, in Monklands district, as ''a
patchwork of two or three pieces of bog''. Here, unfortunately for the
bog, it lies over the most valuable coal reserves. Pressure from SWT
succeeded in the mining company modifying its extraction plans, but the
problem in cases like this is that the hydrology of the remaining bog
can be affected by what goes on around it.
If it dries out, it is no longer an active, developing raised bog. It
becomes colonised by birch and heathers -- ''things which shouldn't
really be there'', as Doar puts it.
Another threat is road building. ''It happens all over the place in
small bits,'' says Doar, but major road schemes currently under
consideration could have a much greater impact. A new extension of the
M80 from Stepps through the Kelvin Valley past Kilsyth to Haggs
threatens Gartshore Moss and Barbeth Moss, while an offshoot of the M8
from Bathgate south to Douglas Water would affect Longridge Moss,
Swinabbey Moss, and possibly Cranley Moss, which Doar describes as ''an
outstanding site'' where the Scottish Wildlife Trust has been carrying
out conservation work.
Atmospheric pollution is yet another problem, with changes in
rainwater chemistry having an effect on the sphagnum mosses.
''Virtually everything that could happen to a habitat has happened to
raised bogs,'' says Doar. ''We need better protection of the best sites,
the introduction of some kind of protection for all sites, and a huge
wad of increased public awareness and concern about them.''
As for flora and fauna, look no further than a raised bog for variety.
Some life forms have become so specialised they depend entirely on this
habitat.
In the plant line there are the sphagnum mosses, ranging in colour
from green to bright red. In Britain, bog rosemary is found only in
raised bogs. Sundews -- unusual plants which supplement their diet with
insects trapped by sticky blobs on their leaves -- are among the first
to die out when bogs are drained.
The large heath butterfly has evolved specifically to live off
peatlands. Just recently, a small jumping spider was found on a Scottish
bog for the first time, and there are undoubtedly other creatures, says
Nigel Doar, that we simply don't know exist.
Birds are perhaps the most conspicuous inhabitants of bogs with which
the public can readily identify. Apart from the predators, like hen
harriers and short-eared owls, there is the beautiful golden plover --
one of the wading birds that lives on bogland.
Of the forms of protection that exist for raised bogs, like
designation as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), they are
often not enforced strongly enough in Britain, complain
conservationists.
The latest weapon in the armoury is an agreement by member states of
the European Union to establish a network of Special Areas of
Conservation (SACs). These are still at the identification stage and
have not yet been given full designation.
Major disagreements between conservation bodies like the Scottish
Wildlife Trust and the Government about how many sites should be
designated have already started. ''The Government seems loath to use
European legislation in the way in which it was intended,'' laments
Nigel Doar.
As in so many other instances, the interests of conservationists and
those of commerce and development clash head-on regarding the
preservation of raised bogs.
This month's convention in Edinburgh and International Bog Day will
keep up the pressure and increase public awareness. But the real
effectiveness of such initiatives can only be judged in decades to come,
by our children, and our children's children.
Will raised bogs and their life forms still be a part of the British
landscape in 100, 200 years' time? For now, no-one can be sure.

THE mother of a six-year-old Edinburgh boy, who a court has ruled is
to be kept apart from his father, yesterday criticised a Scottish judge.
Mrs Shoneagh McCathie was responding to criticism by Lord McCluskey of
a decision by two ''brother'' judges to sever permanently links between
her son Bradley and his father, Mr Stuart Sanderson.
On Wednesday, in a judgment issued at the Court of Session, Lord
McCluskey dissented with colleagues Lord Weir and Lord Brand in what he
called an ''extraordinary'' decision.
The court had ruled Mr Sanderson, from Edinburgh's Crewe Toll area,
should be denied access to the boy, who was born during a relationship
between Mr Sanderson and Mrs McCathie -- at that time Ms Shoneagh
McManus.
In the ruling, the two judges said a Sheriff Court decision not to
allow access had been justified and that access might be potentially
harmful.
Lord McCluskey, however, said there was no justification for keeping
Mr Sanderson apart from his son. He said no sufficient reason had been
given for preventing the child seeing his father and grandparents.
''We have a situation in which a father and his young son, now aged
six, have been denied all contact with each other for two years on the
basis of a few trivial matters which neither the sheriff nor the sheriff
principal had evaluated with any commonsense, or sense of reality.''
Following the ruling, Mr Sanderson's parents described their son as
''a damn good father'', who would do nothing to harm his son.
Mrs McCathie married Mr Brian McCathie last year, and the couple, who
live at St Clair Place, Leith, have a six-month old son Liam. Yesterday,
she said Lord Mucluskey had talked of triviality. ''He seems to be
saying domestic violence is a triviality.''
Mrs McCathie alleged she had left Mr Sanderson several times because
of ill-treatment, and also that he had ill-treated Bradley.

The grisly event in which thousands of Zulus and 17 British men were
killed in a one-sided battle still haunts Rorke's Drift more than 100
years on, as Derek Douglas and photographer James Galloway discovered
WHILE much of the rest of Britain was watching Pete Sampras do battle
against Boris Becker in the Wimbledon men's final last Sunday, I tuned
into the celebrated celluloid account of an altogether more compelling
mismatch, Zulu. At Rorke's Drift.
There was Michael Caine as the aristocratic Lieutenant Gonville
Bromhead displaying that English stiff upper lip in the face of
overwhelming odds. And there was Stanley Baker as the artisan lieutenant
of Royal Engineers, John Chard, proving the truth of the old adage,
cometh the hour, cometh the man.
The cinematic representation of the defence of Rorke's Drift has
become one of the abiding images of the big screen. Eleven Victoria
Crosses won in a single day, valiant Welshmen standing their ground
against a Zulu impi which outnumbered them by a factor of thousands to
one. It was a great movie and, to all intents and purposes, as
historically accurate as cinematic licence would allow.
But what of Rorke's Drift itself? Does it -- do the killing fields --
live up to the expectations raised by the Caine-Baker film portrayal?
Yes, in every way. In January, 1879, Rorke's Drift was being used as a
supply depot for Lord Chelmsford's British colonial expedition to drive
the Zulus out of their homeland and to extend the borders -- and secure
the mineral rights -- of the British colony of Natal.
But before then it was headquarters to James Rorke, a lieutenant in
the Buffalo River Border Guard. He established a ''drift'' or crossing
point on the Buffalo River, hence the name, Rorke's Drift. The Zulus
called it Jim's Place and when the decision was taken to attack Lord
Chelmsford's supply depot there they said they were going to fight, not
at Rorke's Drift, but at Jim's Place. Somehow it doesn't quite have the
same majestic ring to it.
Within a couple of years of Rorke setting up on the slopes of the
Shiyane mountain, the Reverend Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins in the movie)
established a Church of Sweden mission on the site, and there is to this
day a Lutheran church on the battle site.
Rorke's Drift is not easy to find. It stands amid countryside of
breathtaking beauty in what is now Kwazulu-Natal and 27 kilometres up a
dirt track.
There is a school there now, and a craft shop, and a few houses spread
around. But it takes little imagination to see it just as it was on
January 22/23, 1879, when Prince Dabulamanzi -- King Cetshwayo's
half-brother -- ignored his chief's express order not to stray into
British Natal and attacked the supply depot.
Dabulamanzi and his Undi corps were angered by the fact that they had
played no part in the rout the previous day when, beneath the
sphinx-shaped mountain Isandlwana, 20,000 Zulus annihilated almost 1400
British soldiers, and one of Lord Chelmsford's three invasion columns
had been wiped out.
The Undi corps descended upon Rorke's Drift -- just 11 kilometres
overland from Isandlwana -- and for an afternoon, overnight and for most
of the next day, wave after wave of warriors threw themselves at the
rudimentary defences which Bromwell and Chard had managed to throw up.
The two officers, contrary to the Caine-Baker portrayals, were not
thought much of by their contemporaries.
Chard was said to have been ''a plodding, dogged sort'' while Bromhead
was ''fearless and hopelessly stupid''. Perhaps they were uniquely
qualified for the action they were to fight that January in 1879.
Today, the site of the hospital where Private Hook (''Ill, excused
duties, sir'') fought off the Zulus and led the wounded to safety as the
hospital burned around them, is a museum. Set into the floor are the
foundations of the hospital building in which Hook won his VC.
Elsewhere, the site is much as it was. Cobblestones set into the
ground depict the lines of the mealie sack, biscuit box, and overturned
wagon which was to be the saving of the British defenders.
The surrounding terrain is exactly as it was 116 years ago. Three
flags -- the new South African emblem, a Union Jack, and the Red Dragon
of Wales -- fly from staffs erected just where Dabulamanzi's men mounted
their frontal attack.
In the museum there are graphic displays depicting the gory action and
artefacts taken from the site, including ammunition boxes and rounds of
unspent bullets for the rapid-reloading Martini-Henry rifles against
which the Zulus stood little chance.
The mass grave containing the bodies of 500 Zulu warriors is marked
with a cairn and 200 yards away is a small cemetery plot which is the
final resting place of the 17 British dead.
Thanks to the power of the big screen, the action at Rorke's Drift has
been indelibly burned into the consciousness of a generation of
cinema-goers.
But what of the Zulus, who were fighting for the homeland in the face
of Victorian Britain's colonial aggression?
While we were at the site Brightness Zinhle, a 17-year old Zulu girl
who attends the mission school at Rorke's Drift, came across seeking a
contribution to the funds which her New Foundation of God choir needs to
attend the Bethel choir conference in Durban.
Was there any Zulu notion of what had taken place here? Was it taught
as history at her mission school? ''I just know that the whites fought
the blacks here. I don't know what it was about. Many Zulus died.''
That was an eye-opener. So far as young Brightness was concerned, this
wasn't a band of heroic red-coats holding out against all the odds. It
was just white men fighting black men. In view of the recent history of
pre-Mandela South Africa, it would seem that nothing much had changed.
The issuing of 11 Victoria Crosses to the defenders of Rorke's Drift
-- the most in a single day's action in British martial history -- was,
say the cynics (and there were cynics around in Victorian Britain, too),
done to divert public opinion from the crushing defeat at Isandlwana.
And it was to Isandlwana that we travelled next. We arrived there,
over dirt roads, as night was falling.
On either side Zulu kraals were just visible, the interiors of the
circular, thatch-roofed huts lit by oil lamps. This was as far removed
from modern South Africa as it is possible to be.
Isandlwana mountain was a sacred place to the Zulus and it was not
difficult to understand why.
Silhouetted against the indigo sky the sheer basalt cliffs, crafted by
nature into the perfect representation of a crouching lion or sphinx,
take on a magical, ethereal quality.
The graves of the hundreds of men who died there litter the lower
slopes. The headstones are dotted over a few hundreds square yards, the
graves being dug where the soldiers fell.
Again, just like at Rorke's Drift, the remoteness of the battlefield
-- despite the small museum which is now on the site -- means that the
killing fields have been left exactly as they were just more than a
century ago.
The passing of the years has been unable to diminish the sheer beauty
of the place or, standing there in the balmy African twilight, to erode
the twin senses of tragedy and suffering which have been companions to
Isandlwana for those 100 years and more.

<HEADLINE>Supplier admitted selling ecstasy during rave at which man died from overdose. Five years for Hanger 13 dealer</HEADLINE>

A DRUGS dealer who admitted selling ecstasy at a rave in Hanger 13,
Ayr, on the night a man died from an overdose was yesterday jailed for
five years.
A steady flow of people were seen buying the drug from Martin Tricker
inside the Hanger 13 club on that same night.
At the rave last August, Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, of Rigside, Lanark,
collapsed and later died after taking the drug.
The High Court in Ayr yesterday heard how Tricker, 21, of Philip
Square, Ayr, was seen inside the main hall selling ecstasy.
Later he admitted to detectives being involved in selling ecstasy.
When they raided the house in Drongan, Ayrshire, where he then lived,
they found a notebook with the words ''1 Ex #12.50'' indented on the
book.
Advocate-debute Valerie Stacey said that in Ayr the drug was so
prevalent that its price had been reduced. It was being sold at between
#10-#15 a tablet compared with #20 in Glasgow.
However, on the night of Mr Stoddart's death, Tricker was supplying
not just one person, but a steady flow of people.
She said that there were a number of people selling the drug in Hanger
13 at various locations where youngsters knew where to find them as they
knew the dealers by sight.
Tricker also pled guilty to attempting to pervert the course of
justice by threatening a witness in the case last March in Ayr town
centre.
He approached Mr David McGinlay, who had picked him out as a drug
dealer at a police identity parade. Tricker asked him if he had been to
see his lawyer to give a statement.
He also asked him to go to the police station and retract his
statement. He suggested that Mr McGinlay should tell them that he just
picked him out because he knew him.
Tricker then threatened he would come down on McGinlay ''like a ton of
bricks''. He also said he would get his heavies to do McGinlay and give
him a hammering.
The Advocate-depute said that Mr McGinlay had invited Tricker to fight
to settle the issue, but the accused declined. Tricker left warning Mr
McGinlay: ''It is being arranged.''
Mr William McVicar, QC, defending, said his client regularly attended
the raves at Hanger 13 and used drugs.
That night he had more ecstasy tablets than usual and word soon spread
that it was possible to obtain drugs from him.
He claimed that Tricker had no intention to go to Hanger 13 to sell
drugs. He said there was only a small quantity of ecstasy involved, but
Tricker was now very remorseful about what he had done.
He added that the threats to Mr McGinlay were because Tricker lost his
temper as he was unhappy the witness was not going to co-operate with
his agent.
Tricker had been released on bail at Ayr Sheriff Court on January 9 on
a charge of supplying drugs, but he was remanded in custody two months
later, after being accused of perverting the course of justice.
Lord Gill said that a social inquiry report had described Tricker as
an intelligent and articulate person, which made the circumstances even
more regrettable.
He jailed Tricker for four years on the charge of supplying ecstasy
atHanger 13 and one year for attempting to pervert the course of
justice, with the sentences to run consecutively.

* THE nice wee nostrum for Glasgow's angst during the 1960s was the
cry for a return of the trams. Remedy or not for Glaswegian concern, it
was and remains a remedy for every European city's traffic ills, and it
is only a matter of time before the trams are back.
Older citizens -- and I am afraid I seem to be one of them -- have a
tearful regard for the shooglie things, the trams on the tracks. When
the final tram rolled along the last Glasgow lines we turned out in our
thousands. It was a bigger turn-out than you would get at the Cenotaph.
Men and women wept: this is not a lie, because they did.
There have been many books on trams, and Brian Patton, a patron of
trams and an enthusiast for many a long year, has produced a splendid
one, Glasgow Trams (Silver Link Publishing, #12.99).
Brian is a bit too young to remember the full glory of the trams. I
was a bus conductor just after the trams had been phased out. The tram
people never quite got over not being on the decks of these urban ships:
never understood the bus, the way that people like myself cannot quite
grasp the difference between a typewriter and a word-processor.
Ach, it disnae matter -- except for one thing. Typewriters and
computers don't make a difference; but trams did. Which is why we have
these books on trams.
They were tall ships; they were poetry, they were elegant and elegiac
and sad and happy. They were pets like furry animals. They were yours.
You could turn the seats around at every terminus.
They went to their destination, a bit creakily perhaps, but they got
there. They were straightforward, on the right track. Not a bit like me,
or you, or anybody else today really.

SCOTLAND'S sporting youngsters sprinted up the political agenda
yesterday with the unveiling of plans to bring competitive school sports
back to the prominent position they once held.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth chose Hampden Park to outline his
12-point plan to revive youth sport, while in London John Major
announced a British Academy of Sport to be financed by up to #100m of
lottery funds.
Mr Forsyth's goal is ultimately to restore Scotland's fortunes on the
sporting field through encouragement and development of youth talent.
His package includes an extra #300,000, of which #200,000 will go from
the Scottish Sports Council to build on the Team Sport Scotland
Initiative he developed in the early 1990s taking the budget to
#700,000. A further #100,000 will be committed to the Sports Mark Award
to reward schools with high quality provision of sporting activities and
facilities.
The proposals also include:
* A national youth sport strategy and a new scheme, School Sport
Scotland, to give a higher profile to school sport.
* Stronger links between schools and clubs at local and strategic
level, more medals and awards, and HM Inspector of Schools reports on PE
teaching.
* New planning guidelines to protect school playing fields. New
guidance to education authorities and school boards on maximising
out-of-hours use of school facilities.
While accepting a decline in the popularity of school sports, Mr
Forsyth said Scotland had escaped the ''loony idealogy from the left''
which argued sport was bad for children and competition should be
banned.
He said he had been extremely impressed by the close links forged
between Scots national rugby champions Stirling County and youngsters in
the local community.
''I want to give more young people a chance to take part more fully in
sport in schools and I also want them to be able to realise their
potential in any area where they show promise,'' he said.
''The announcement today of plans for a British Academy of Sport
completes our sports package by providing for the further development of
elite performers.''
There were no proposals to build a Scottish version said the Minister,
but Scots would benefit from the academy. The emphasis north of the
Border would be on specialised local training.
''I plan to build on the commitment which exists in school sport in
Scotland and the proven success of the existing schemes like the
Scottish Sports Council's Team Sport Scotland Initiative. The advent of
the National Lottery gives marvellous opportunities to get more and
better facilities off the ground.
''My proposals will provide a framework for better links between
schools and sports clubs to give young people new opportunities to
develop their talents,'' he continued.
''And these developments must take place within a well thought out
strategy for youth sport in Scotland.''
Mr Forsyth said there were no plans to reward teachers financially for
taking on coaching duties after school hours, but said he would not
stand in the way of local authorities who chose to do so.
''It is a matter for them, but most teachers are not doing it because
they want a reward,'' he said.
The initiative was broadly welcomed by education officials and sports
organisations.
The Scottish Sports Council said it was delighted that the Government
recognised the value of sport and, in particular, youth sport.
It felt that it would develop opportunities for young people and
provide a framework for the support of aspiring and elite athletes.
A spokesman added: '' The Government's policy document is a product of
the close working relationship between the Scottish Office and the
council.
''We particularly welcome the focus on sport in schools, and believe
the initiatives will give youth and excellence in sport a positive boost
towards the next millennium.''
The Scottish Rugby Union, recently visited by the Duke of Edinburgh
who saw a coaching session of teenagers in progress at Murrayfield, also
welcomed the announcement.
Head of finance, Mr Graham Ireland, thought it a positive move which
bode well for the future of sport in Scotland.
He added: ''We have worked closely with National Playing Fields
Association and have a number of initiatives in mind. We are hoping to
talk to the Government about possible funding.
''We are delighted the Government is raising the profile of sport.''
Mr David Bayman, assistant Principal of Dunfermline College of
Physical Education, whose campus in Edinburgh is part of the Moray House
Institute of Education, said he thought it an important development by
the Government, responding to an initiative which had been mooted over
the past decade by sports bodies.
''We want to see practical ways of stopping the decline of sport in
schools. It also underlines the fact that the patterns of coaching,
including volunteers, needs to be looked at,'' he said.
The Educational Institute of Scotland took a more reserved stance.
Spokesman Ronald Smith commented: ''It is a bit like the curate's egg --
good in bits, bad in others.
''The introduction of a sports mark, for example, could be divisive in
that parents could be persuaded to send their children to schools which
were awarded them.''
He added: ''It is interesting that money has been suddenly found for
funding, when we are continually told there is none available.''
Mrs Gloria Grosset of the Scottish Lawn Tennis Association regarded
the announcement as ''great news''.

Allan Massie. THE RAGGED LION (Sceptre, #5.99).
Finding his literary hero's own memoirs and autobiographical writings
somehow unsatisfactory, the distinguished Scottish novelist Allan Massie
has taken upon himself to take Sir Walter Scott's own place and compose
a fiction intended to tell an intriguing version of the truth about that
strange, melancholy, brilliant, and ordinary middle-class Edinburgh
worthy who was the Wizard of the North. Aside from its quality as a
biography packed with incidental information and insight, Massie's great
achievement is to have created a sympathetic and convincing tone of
voice that will make even diehard anti-Scottists like the present
reviewer give the novels another try. A very fine book indeed.
Robert Orledge. SATIE REMEMBERED (Faber, #10.99).
What is Eric Satie (the k in Erik was an adult affectation) remembered
for, since you ask? For the Gymnopedies and the Gnossienes, of course,
those deceptively simple short piano pieces, written in the last two
decades of the nineteenth century, that have become a musical shorthand
for early Modernism in Western art and culture. They sound so lost and
lonely, so like their creator -- a personal presence so vague and
enigmatic that it is hard to imagine him having any more precise kind of
biography than this collection of often contradictory reminiscenses by

A HIGH Court battle began yesterday between #18m lottery winner
Mukhtar Mohidin and his wife, Sayeeda, over who gets the money.
The dispute was transferred to the privacy of the London court's
Family Division.
Mr Mohidin, 40, once a factory worker in Blackburn, Lancashire, was
the first big jackpot winner when he won the top prize in December.
Since then, the couple and their three children have changed their
names and moved to a #350,000 house in the South of England.
However, the pair have accused each other of giving too much of the
win to their respective relatives, and have launched separate civil
actions to make their claims to the money.
Mr Mohidin, who claims the cash is his because he bought the winning
ticket, is seeking a declaration that he is ''solely and beneficially''
entitled to it.
He also wants the court to say that he is not bound by an authority he
signed in March which allows his wife to take limited funds from the
sum.
In the Chancery Division of the High Court where Mr Mohidin issued his
writ on Monday, Mr Justice Rattee ordered that his case should be
transferred to the Family Division, where his 33-year-old wife has
brought proceedings under the Married Women's Property Act.
He said: ''The subject matter is an unhappy dispute between husband
and wife as to their beneficial entitlement to money. It seems
peculiarly a matter which ought to be dealt with there.''
Neither of the couple was in court to hear Mrs Mohidin's counsel, Mr
Romie Tager, QC, tell the judge that, contrary to previous reports, they
were ''struggling to save their marriage''.

<HEADLINE>Timely change for car park charges</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977387796</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A NEW charging scheme -- thought to be the first of its kind in the
United Kingdom -- has been introduced in three Glasgow city centre car
parks.
Customers at the car parks at Buchanan Street, Cambridge Street and St
Enoch Centre are now charged in increments of five minutes rather than
hourly or two-hourly periods.
Mr Tony Hughes, Strathclyde Regional Council principal traffic
engineer, said: ''The normal policy of charging for parking in one or
two hour bands is seen as a major disincentive to the use of car parks
for those who want to park for short periods.
''It can also be seen as unfair, since motorists almost always have to
pay for a longer period than that actually required. By charging in five
and ten minute units for parking, we hope to encourage their use in
preference to on-road spaces.''
The cost of full hourly charges will rise in some cases but fall in
others. For instance, a full two-hour stay has risen from #1 to #1.20
but parking for five hours is now cheaper, falling from #5 to #4.20. The
council argues that most customers will pay less because they do not
stay for full hourly periods or the maximum time previously allowed.
The new charges are 10p per 10 minutes for the first three hours, and
10p per five minutes thereafter, subject to a maximum charge of #1 after
6pm on weekdays and all day Sunday.
The new charges are part of a programme of improvements at Glasgow car
parks. Other measures include closed circuit TV and new lifts.

Flight delays can leave passengers stranded and bored. Margaret Hughes
checks out our regional airports to see if they pass the entertainment
test
THIS week's pictures of dishevelled holidaymakers stranded at Glasgow
Airport must have struck a chord with anyone who has ever had a holiday
begin, or end, with a lengthy delay in an airport waiting lounge.
When faced with such a dilemma, boredom is usually overcome by eating,
shopping, or any other makeshift form of entertainment.
As frustrating as it must have been for those stranded last weekend,
Glasgow Airport is one of the better places for such a problem to arise.
As well as a varied choice of eating outlets, there are also shops to
browse through, and a play area for children.
The next four days will see 932 flights leave and arrive at Glasgow
International Airport and more than 110,000 passengers sampling its
offerings of pre-holiday dining and entertainment.
Extensive renovation work and modernisation during the past few years
has transformed the airport into an altogether more pleasant place.
Most eating and drinking facilities are on the upper floor. The
Granary is a self-service restaurant offering pretty much the same sort
of food you could expect to see in a motorway service station. There are
salads, sandwiches with interesting fillings such as smoked salmon, or
ciabatta with cheese or ham. They all look freshly made and appetising.
There are hot meals, including regulars such as fish and chips, steak
pie, and curry.
If you are stranded first thing in the morning, and cannot wait for
your airline breakfast tray, then the ''Big Breakfast'' is a mammoth
serving of bacon, eggs, and sausages. In fact there would probably be
enough to feed the entire family.
Unless there are myriad plane delays and the airport is wildly busy,
seating should not be a problem. Much of the Granary seating is
non-smoking.
For fast-food fans, McDonald's has recently opened in the airport and
stays open 24 hours a day. Considering there cannot be many regulars in
the airport's pub, the Tap and Spile, it has quite a friendly feel. This
probably has more to do with the clientele's air of pleasant expectancy
and determined effort to get their holiday off on the right foot. But it
can get a bit busy, even rowdy, so if you want to catch some sleep while
waiting for your flight, it would be best not to sit too close to it.
The menu at Garfunkels Restaurant is typical of its High Street
outlets with burgers, pasta, pizza, steaks, and salads.
If it is all getting too frenzied, you might be lucky enough to find a
quiet corner at the Costa Coffee Boutique, situated on the ground floor.
This outlet serves some of the best cappuccino and espresso anywhere.
With a larger coffee shop on the first floor, situated between Domestic
Arrivals and International Departures, you have the choice of two
venues.
Cafe Select, situated at International Arrivals on the ground floor,
is a similar set-up, and serves tea and coffees as well as sandwiches.
No matter how short the flight delay is, excited children will soon
get bored. The ''Outer Limits'' is bound to be the venue they choose to
wait in. It has a choice of video games, but the noise levels get high
and it will quickly drain your pocket. For smaller children there is a
supervised play area, with climbing frames and a pool of plastic balls.
With shops including John Menzies, Thorntons, and Our Price Records,
an hour or so can easily be whiled away. You can even stock up on some
Scottish delicacies at The Best of Scotland.
In the event of a long delay extending through the night, an airport
spokesperson explained that the Granary remains open 24 hours a day, and
entertainment will be provided to keep youngsters occupied.
Fewer holiday flights leave from Edinburgh Airport and so there are
less facilities than at Glasgow. However, there is some choice.
Ginghams is a self-service restaurant offering a choice of sandwiches,
hot meals, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. It has ample seating and
its menu should provide something to suit most tastes.
It, too, has a Costa Coffee Boutique with a good vantage point close
to one of the entrances -- so you can at least indulge in some
people-watching while you wait.
Upstairs a Cafe Select offers a choice of alcoholic beverages, as well
as a limited selection of food.
The ''shopping mall'' is considerably smaller, but well-known names
are represented, such as Tie Rack and the jewellery chain, Torq. The
large bookstore-cum-chemist-cum-record shop takes up a considerable
chunk of space and has pretty much all the last-minute things you might
need.
Because the airport does not benefit from the wide-open space of
Glasgow, it has the potential to become more chaotic.
Prestwick International Airport, once Scotland's transatlantic
gateway, is now a shadow of its former self. The number of charter
companies using this airport is increasing, and a railway station and
walkway have been constructed to tempt more travellers to use the
airport. But this is one place you definitely do not want to be
stranded.
Eating and drinking facilities are limited. On the first floor,
Carnegie's is the pub/bar outlet that looks smoky and claustrophobic.
The Gallery Cafe is a self-service restaurant with a good selection of
hot and cold meals, as well as sandwiches and drinks. The food certainly
looks good enough, but the surroundings appear dated.
Downstairs there is a smaller cafe area and a pub named Gracelands.
Not surprisingly, it depicts Elvis Presley on its wall but it is small
and a little gloomy.
Shopping is limited with a few small shops, including a general
newsagent which sells books, mementoes of Scotland, and toiletries.
Airport seating is limited, no more than a few rows of uncomfortable
looking benches, but there is plenty of floorspace to lounge around.
Perhaps the most depressing facility was the children's play area. It
consisted of one very small merry-go-round set right next to the
designated smoking area.
Starting your holiday in a frazzled state because of a flight delay is
not ideal, but look at the bright side . . . you'll have plenty of
spending money to keep yourself going on food and drink.

SCOTTISH mountain rescue skills and equipment have been recruited to
help save lives on ''Noah's mountain'' in Turkey.
The 16,945ft Mount Ararat, reputed resting place of Noah's Ark, is to
have Turkey's first mountain rescue team, and its members have been
trained by the Lochaber team leader, Mr Brian McDermott.
The climber, who has been involved in hundreds of rescues, has
recently returned from a teaching trip and advising on the best
equipment. Ropes from Aviemore and stretchers from Glencoe are now part
of the standard kit for Turkish rescue teams.
Mr McDermott, who was born in Ulster, said: ''Scotland is the only
place in Europe where most mountain rescues are based on the ground,
everywhere else uses helicopters all the time.
''Conditions in Turkey are very similar with remote mountains and a
locally-based voluntary service.''
In October, a member of the Turkish rescue squad will visit the
Lochaber team and Fort William Police to learn how to train
search-and-rescue dogs.

A BATTERED wife who disappeared 10 years ago has been found buried
under the floorboards of her home, police said yesterday.
Mrs Margaret Bennett, 50, was reported missing by her violent husband,
Frank, in January 1985. Three years later, he died after walking in
front of a train.
Now detectives believe he killed his wife and then committed suicide.
Police said there was no evidence of foul play at the time of Mrs
Bennett's disappearance to involve them making a full search of the
house. Two years ago, they dug up a patio at the back of the building
following information, but found nothing.
A Home Office pathologist attended the scene yesterday and the body
was being removed for a post-mortem examination. Police said it was too
early to determine how Mrs Bennett died.
The house in Field Terrace Road, Newmarket, Suffolk, remained empty
for several years and was in the process of being sold to a local
builder. The man, who does not want to be identified, found the remains
under the floorboards in the living room.
Police said the builder had lifted the carpet in the living room and
saw that a section of the floorboards had been replaced.
As he disturbed the loose soil below to inspect the foundations, he
came across the body wrapped in polythene.
Mrs Bennett was reported missing on January 27, 1985. Mr Bennett
claimed to have last seen her three days earlier when they argued before
he went to work.
He told police he had returned from work to find she had left taking a
suitcase full of clothes and #25 in cash.
A police spokesman said: ''The couple were known to have a turbulent
relationship. They had moved to Newmarket three-and-a-half years earlier
from London.
''Mrs Bennett is believed to have suffered domestic violence. She was
known at the local women's refuge and had gone missing from home
frequently prior to January 1985.
''Police were suspicious about the incident. After extensive
nationwide inquiries failed to trace Mrs Bennett, her husband was
interviewed by detectives.
''However, no evidence ever emerged to suggest she had been the victim
of foul play.
''On Monday November 7, 1988, Mr Bennett's body was discovered beside
a railway track in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, after he walked
out in front of a train.''
No suicide note was found and the coroner recorded an open verdict, he
said.
He added: ''Inquiries into Mrs Bennett's 'disappearance' continued and
in 1993, working on information received, police dug up the patio at the
back. However, nothing suspicious was discovered.''
Detective Superintendent Peter Worobec said: ''On the face of it, Mrs
Bennett was murdered by her violent husband and buried under the
floorboards.
''Because the couple lived alone, no-one was aware of what had
occurred in the house.
''However, in-depth forensic inquiries will be carried out to confirm
that our suspicions are correct.''

<TEXT>
A SHERIFF yesterday took the unusual step of referring three teenage
victims of a vigilante-style beating to the children's panel -- after
hearing they had been caught literally with their trousers down.
The three boys, all 15, were given a brutal hiding after being found
with three teenage girls in a bothy in woods near a former Stirlingshire
mining village.
Stirling Sheriff Court was told that adults in the village had gone
looking for the girls on April 8 after they had been reported missing.
The girls had failed to turn up at a friend's house, where they were
supposed to be spending the night. And at nearly midnight the girls --
two aged 13 and one aged 14 -- had been seen wandering the streets
before disappearing.
Two men were tipped off that the girls could be with the boys. They
went to a den in the woods and kicked in the door. Inside, by the light
of a cigarette-lighter, they found the girls and five teenage boys, some
of whom had been drinking.
One of the boys was naked in a sleeping-bag with one of the girls. Two
other boys were dressed only in their boxer shorts.
The older of the two men told police that the sight made him ''blow
his top''. He picked up a piece of broken door-post and smashed a
16-year-old boy in the face.
Then he aimed blows with the makeshift baton at two of the 15-year-old
boys, catching one on the elbow and raining blows on the back and arm of
the other.
The other man threw a punch, catching another 15-year-old boy on the
face, before coming to his senses and trying to restrain the older man,
said depute-fiscal Mrs Wilma Curtis.
Another of the boys escaped, and raised the alarm.
Mrs Curtis said police arrived and took the boys to Stirling Royal
Infirmary. One had a cut near his eye, and another had an injured elbow
which needed to be protected by a special cuff. A third had his glasses
smashed in the attack.
The two accused men admitted assault, and the younger man admitted
committing the offence while on bail. Sheriff David Crowe fined the
older man #300 and the younger man #100.
The sheriff said: ''I can understand there was considerable
provocation. While that doesn't excuse your actions, it possibly makes
them to some degree understandable.''
He said it gave him great concern to be told that three 15-year-old
boys had been allowed to stay out all night unsupervised, and had been
drinking.
The sheriff added: ''It also gives me great concern that girls of 13
and 14 were raking about the streets at 11.30 at night -- it's
extraordinary.''
Under a rarely-used power, Sheriff Crowe ordered the procurator-fiscal
to refer the girls and the three 15-year-old boys to the Reporter to the
Children's Panel.
The parents of children involved said nothing as they left court.
The older accused man said later: ''I think the sheriff was very fair.
I think he was right to refer the youngsters to the panel, but their
families aren't pleased.''

COMEDY actor Stephen Fry returned to the public stage yesterday, if
not quite in Liz Hurley style disguise, at least with a change.
He was honoured at the graduation ceremony of Dundee University, and
displayed a new blond hairstyle.
The opinion of the spectators was ''not quite a Gazza, more of a honey
blond''.
Mr James Duncan, his assistant at the university, said: ''Stephen told
me that his hair turned blond naturally in the sun.''
Fry, a Cambridge graduate and the rector of Dundee University, was
making his first public appearance since he disappeared after walking
out on a West End play in February.
He wrote to the play's author: ''My confidence is so blown away that I
can never tread a stage again.'' However, yesterday he strolled across
the stage of Dundee's vast Caird Hall to accept an Honorary Doctor of
Laws degree in recognition of his services to the students.
He was given a rapturous reception by the students. His parents were
also in the audience.
He took several bows, blowing kisses and saying ''Thank you'' to the
audience. Later, he said he was ''touched'' by his reception. Asked if
it marked a return to public life, he replied: ''I'm not really saying
anything about that.''
He has represented the students for three years and was re-elected
unopposed for a second three-year term earlier this year.

* Andrew McDougall has been driving his Readiscovery ''Book Bus''
around Scotland since January, encouraging school children to read. Here
he describes his eating pattern on a typical day in the Outer Hebrides.
I STAYED in a bed-and-breakfast in Stornoway, got up at 7am, and had
breakfast at 7.30. It consisted of orange juice, Corn Flakes, bacon,
egg, and toast, and two cups of tea (the ordinary breakfast kind). Then
it was into the bus for the drive to the morning's schools (I had a
couple of extra-strong mints on the way). Children's author Vivian
French and I visited schools at Breasclete, Bernera, and Uig, where the
children as usual came into the bus, used the computer, and listened to
books on tape.
Lunch was at Uig Primary School. As far as I can work out, it was a
turkey burger, with two scoops of mashed potato, carrots, and gravy. For
pudding there was chocolate blancmange with some sort of cream. I had
tap water to drink. The children were then on the bus again. I stopped
about 3.30pm and had a cup of tea and a slice of cake in the staffroom.
Then left for Stornoway, arriving at 5.30pm.
I went out for a bar meal of marinaded herring salad for starters, and
steak and chips with vegetables for main course -- the steak was not as
rare as it could have been. To accompany my meal I had three pints of
Guinness. Then it was back to the B&amp;B at 10.45pm to pack. I went to bed
at 11.30pm without anything further to eat or drink.

<HEADLINE>6000 new jobs as Jaguar roars again. Lang delighted with massive vote of confidence for British manufacturing</HEADLINE>

LUXURY car company Jaguar yesterday announced it was building a new
small model in the Midlands in a #400m project which will create more
than 6000 jobs.
Thanks to #80m from the Government, Jaguar's parent company Ford
decided to go ahead with the car in Britain rather than in America.
The project will create about 1300 jobs at Jaguar's Castle Bromwich
plant in Birmingham and at Ford's plant in Halewood, Merseyside, which
will be resposible for major body pressings.
It is also estimated that building the new car will create a further
5000 jobs in the British motor industry.
''This is terrific news and a significant achievement for the British
motor industry and the West Midlands in particular,'' said President of
the Board of Trade, Ian Lang.
''This is the latest in a long line of investments by Ford in Britain.
It is also a vote of confidence in British manufacturing and
engineering.''
Codenamed the X200, the new car is scheduled to come into production
in 1999 and will double Jaguar's annual production capacity to 100,000.
America is expected to make up about 45% of the new car's market and
there will also be sales to Japan and Germany.
The new vehicle is aimed at the market dominated by medium-sized
executive saloons like the BMW 5-series.
It is likely to have a distinctive Jaguar look, but could be powered
by a Ford engine and use the chassis of the latest Ford Scorpio.
Jaguar chairman Nick Scheele acknowledged ''the X200 is a vital
project for Jaguar and its future in the UK''.
The project should help to reinforce a recent recovery in the
company's fortunes.
Jaguar is this year expected to make its first profit since it was
bought by Ford in 1989 for #1.6 billion. Under the strain of the
recession and increased competition, particularly in America, the
company has lost #770m over the last six years.
In the first six months of this year, however, sales rose 37% with
sales in America, Jaguar's biggest market, up 28%.
A Jaguar spokesman said: ''This is tremendous news for Jaguar and also
a great reward for all the hard work everyone has put in over the last
five years to ensure Jaguar remains a world class company.''
The package will create 1210 jobs at Jaguar's Castle Bromwich plant
and 150 jobs at Ford's plant at Halewood on Merseyside.
About 57 acres of derelict land will be reclaimed and the project will
also mean new community facilities.
Jaguar received a #48m direct grant from the DTI -- which is subject
to final clearance by the European Commission.
* Land Rover is recalling 3644 new Range Rovers because of a problem
with the brakes, the company announced yesterday. The vehicles were
built for the UK market from September 1994 to the end of May 1995.
Land Rover said the problem was caused by a brake component from an
outside supplier.

MINISTERS admitted yesterday that troops were on the brink of being
ordered to help end the Greenpeace occupation of the Brent Spar
installation last month.
The ''contingency plan'', which involved Royal Marines on stand-by at
RAF Kinloss, had been widely rumoured but never confirmed by the
Government. The men were not deployed, as Shell abandoned its plan to
dump the platform at sea.
However, yesterday's admission by Armed Forces Minister Nicholas
Soames prompted an angry response from Western Isles Labour MP Calum
Macdonald, who accused the Government of being ready to use
''French-style paratrooper tactics'' against the demonstrators.
The disclosure came in a Commons written reply.
Mr Soames said that contingency arrangements were put in place ''in
anticipation of a possible police request for service logistical
assistance, and a Royal Marine detachment and supporting elements were
deployed to Kinloss against this contingency.''
Mr Macdonald replied: ''This is an astonishing revelation. It is
staggering that the Government were so out of touch with public opinion
that not only were they determined to press ahead and dump the Brent
Spar at sea, but they were actually willing to use the Royal Marines
against a peaceful demonstration.''
Greenpeace said in a statement: ''It is rather worrying that the
Government was prepared to use the military against peaceful,
non-violent protesters.''
Meanwhile, Energy Minister Tim Eggar has told the Commons that the
rig, now moored in a Norwegian fjord, still could be sunk and insisted
that the only victims of such disposal would be worms on the sea bed.
The Scottish National Party yesterday demanded the creation of an
independent commission to determine how best to dispose of redundant oil
platforms.
This would ensure a ''systematic approach'' which had the confidence
of all those involved, said the party's Environment spokesperson, Ms
Roseanna Cunningham.

MR MAJOR made a dramatic call to world leaders last night hours after
being the target of a furious outburst by the French President, who
accused him of bowing to Bosnian Serb aggression.
In an extraordinary public swipe at his own allies, Mr Jacques Chirac
likened Mr Major to Neville Chamberlain, who appeased Hitler and Nazi
Germany. President Bill Clinton was not spared in his attack.
Mr Major later called an international conference in London for next
week of the leading players in the Bosnia crisis.
The Prime Minister spoke to Mr Chirac by telephone for 30 minutes
about the deepening crisis after the President's attack. The
conversation was described tersely by Whitehall officials as
''businesslike'' and ''constructive''.
Afterwards, Mr Major moved to wrest back the initiative by announcing
he had summoned the meeting next Friday to consider the way forward.
Representatives of the United Nations, Nato and the five-nation
Contact Group, which comprises Britain, US, Russia, France, and Germany,
have all been invited.
President Clinton ordered General John Shalikashvili, chairman of his
military joint chiefs of staff, to attend the meeting. The decision
followed talks involving the president's top diplomatic and military
advisers at the White House.
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said they recommended the
president maintain his committment ''to keep US combat forces out of the
conflict''. He suggested the US was ready to transport and help equip
European troops involved in the Rapid Reaction Force, and said the
discussions in London would ''obviously relate to the nature of the
mission, to arrangements for command and control, the likelihood of
success, the duration of the proposed mission and types of questions
related to those general subjects.''
Mr Major said there was a ''very urgent need'' to reassess the future
role of UN protection forces. ''I hope that through this initiative, the
international community will be able to regenerate and redirect
diplomatic efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement,'' he said in a
statement.
The diplomatic war was breaking out as Bosnian Serbs pounded another,
UN safe area, Zepa. The widely-predicted assault was described by a UN
source as a ''major attack'' in which the Bosnian Serb army openly
targeted Ukrainian UN observation posts.
On the earlier fall of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, Mr Chirac
told a Paris news conference that the world reaction looked like,
''keeping things in proportion, a bit like the talks that Chamberlain
and Daladier held''.
He was referring to a 1938 Munich conference at which the then British
and French Prime Ministers accepted a carve-up of Czechoslovakia in an
attempt to prevent war with Hitler.
Mr Chirac said that after speaking to Mr Clinton: ''I owe it to truth
to say that up to now the contacts the French Government has made have
not been positive. I deplore that. For the moment we are alone.''
Mr Chirac said he had initially proposed retaking Srebrenica and
restoring its Muslim residents, but now believed that the very least
that should be done was to reinforce other eastern enclaves and lift the
siege of Sarajevo.
France has stepped up pressure for the use of military force to impose
the will of the UN on the Bosnian Serbs, calling for action within 48
hours. It wanted the UN Rapid Reaction Force deployed to seize back from
the Serbs Srebrenica and to break the seige on Sarajevo.
As the diplomatic dispute went on, so did the battles. Bosnian Serb
forces destroyed an aid convoy and clashed with French UN troops on a
mountain road which Mr Chirac has pledged to use to break into Sarajevo.
The four-truck convoy bringing much-needed flour for the Bosnian
capital's bakery was blasted with tank and cannon fire from Serb
positions in the valley below the exposed Mount Igman road. The French
troops responded by firing high explosive mortar bombs and anti-tank
rounds at Serb positions in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.
Reporters saw two of the trucks burning on the high road to the west
of Sarajevo. Three French soldiers were slightly injured and a third
truck was destroyed by mortar fire.
Despite these skirmishes, and the wider ethnic cleansings, the clear
message in Whitehall was that Britain would not commit troops on an
ill-thought out mission that could end in humiliation and failure.
A senior defence source said: ''The French know perfectly well that to
'retake' Srebrenica would require the help of the US. It is pretty
certain that the Americans will not do that, and the French know it. We
have to come up now with a strategy and approach which reflects
realities and helps move things forward.''
This message was emphasised by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo in
Scotland. He made clear that Britain would continue to hold a middle way
between military intervention and threats of withdrawal.
He insisted Britain would hold true to the neutral and humanitarian
role its troops were engaged in.
Speaking to Eastwood Conservatives outside Glasgow, he defended
Britain's apparently tepid response to continued ethnic cleansing.
''That is because we do not have a million men at our disposal to go and
solve every civil war in Europe. What we can do is to use our diplomatic
efforts to bring peace and use our troops to save lives and there is
nothing to be denigrated in either of these activities.''
Nor did he accept that continued Serb aggression amounted to a
humiliation of the UN mission and Britain's part in it. ''Britain's
reputation rightly stands very high, because our men have gone there to
do an incredibly professional job,'' he said.
''They have been rebuilding kindergardens, they have been saving
lives, they have been teaching children how not to step on mines, they
have been getting food through to people, they have been standing
between warring factions, they have been taking risks to get the convoys
through.
''There is nothing humiliating in anything that our boys have done out
in Yugoslavia.''
Of French threats to withdraw its forces unless allies agree to take a
more proactive role in recapturing safe areas, Mr Portillo said: ''It
depends on what you think the United Nations is there to do. It is
there, I believe, to save lives and I don't think we have run the course
of that.
Overall, he insisted that the current approach was the only viable way
forward in the region. ''We need to recognise why we are in Bosnia and
the limitations on what we can do,'' he said. ''We are not in Bosnia to
fight a war. We are there to save lives.''
Mr Robin Cook, Shadow Foreign Secretary, said: ''President Chirac's
claim that the British Government is refusing to support a more robust
approach in Bosnia is of serious concern.
''The success of the operation depends on the willingness of the
international community to show united resolve. Public disagreement
between the two major troop contributors only serves to weaken the UN.''
Mr Major said Mr Portillo would be visiting Unprofor this weekend, and
Chief of the Defence Staff Sir Peter Inge expected to hold a meeting
with his French and American counterparts in the next two days.
In the Lords, junior Defence Minister Earl Howe rebuffed French calls
for action by troops to protect the Muslim enclaves, saying there could
be no military solution to the crisis there.
''What we have to do is intensify efforts to achieve a negotiated
settlement,'' he said. ''The Government maintains that there can be no
military solution.''
It was an echo of Mr Portillo's words.
