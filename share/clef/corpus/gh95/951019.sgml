Kate Rafferty reports on a garden centre which has invited a
charity to join their anniversary celebrations.
THIS is the time of year when most gardeners can start to take it a
little easier. Once planning for the next seasons and October's planting
is done, there's a slightly quieter period until the blooming of spring.
At Findlay Clark Garden Centre, however, it's the busiest winter ever --
with more than just the popular Milngavie premises to run.
The company is arranging a series of events to mark the fact that, on
November 11, 1970, they opened the gates at Boclair Road for the first
time. ''What we're celebrating,'' said Findlay Clark chairman David
Clark, ''is surviving our first 25 years -- something we're extremely
proud of.''
David and his fellow directors, wife Jean and the more recently
recruited Harry McDiarmid, were determined that events connected to the
25th anniversary wouldn't pass without some meaning.
''Twenty-five years seems almost like yesterday at times, but it is an
achievement and we didn't want the celebrations to be kept entirely to
ourselves,'' he added.
''We've always worked quite closely with Riding for the Disabled and
have asked them to be a large part of the main event connected with the
anniversary.''
On Saturday, November 11, Findlay Clark are hosting a Gala Evening to
mark the anniversary, with the aim of raising #25,000 for Riding for the
Disabled.
''It's also their silver jubilee so it seemed like the perfect way to
combine both,'' said Mr Clark.
Following a champagne reception at 7pm, David Clark will welcome
guests, as will Jean Gardener, chairman of Riding for the Disabled, West
and Central Region.
The charity auction which follows will be the highlight of the
evening. Sotheby's auctioneer Anthony Weld Forrester will take charge of
the proceedings, in a style which David Clark promises will keep the
evening swinging along.
There are 56 lots in the auction, donated by those associated with
Findlay Clark, supporters of Riding for the Disabled, and organisations
which simply wanted to help the event reach its target sum.
There are many gardening-related items on offer, from a wheelbarrow
filled with gardening goodies, to a wheelbarrow filled with manure . . .
guests can also bid for a reclining stone gnome.
The donations cover a wider spectrum, however, with meals for two, a
night in a country hotel, a weekend use of a luxury car, days out to
some of Scotland's prime visitor attractions and a selection of choice
whiskies on offer. One of the most popular lots will be a hand-made
wooden rocking horse, which David Clark reckons would sell in London's
top store for around #1500.
The evening's final lot, donated by The Herald, has a festive feel.
Revellers can bid for two one-day trips to Lapland -- meeting Santa
Claus and jet snow-skiing included.
There are also prizes, including a weekend for two in Paris, to be won
in the raffle and tombola, but the evening doesn't come to an end when
the goods are handed out -- there is dancing into the wee small hours to
jazz band Dave Wilson and the Uptown Shufflers.
''Tickets for the evening are #15,'' said Mr Clark. ''We've sold 150
and are hoping to sell the same amount again. We've already had
donations from people who can't be there on the evening.'' All money
raised will go into a Riding for the Disabled trust fund to finance
training courses for carers and trainers.
''The gala night is a public evening, but on Friday, November 10, we
will hold a dinner to thank our staff throughout Scotland. There are
employees travelling from as far as Peterhead to be with us that
night.''
The business opened with David and Jean Clark at the helm, employing
four staff and one part-time employee. Now the Findlay Clark name is
known in locations throughout Scotland, with more than 190 staff.
Apart from the garden centres in Milngavie, Kinross, and Aberdeen,
Findlay Clark specialises in landscaping and nursery sites. ''There has
been a tremendous amount of competition in the garden centre business
over the past 25 years, but I've always felt that competition keeps you
on your toes and stimulates growth.
''We're always looking to expand the business -- for example, when we
took over the Aberdeen centre in 1985, there was a nursery attached. The
manager there has turned that part of the business around.''
This month, as part of the anniversary, the centre has 25 special
plants for keen gardeners to consider. The offer has started this month
to catch the best planting time and aims to provide enthusiasts with a
superb choice of unusual plants which, come next spring, will make
gardens more individual.
The choice of these special plants, David Clark believes, is a
testament to the skills and knowledge of Findlay Clark staff, from
nurserymen to those who provide on-site help for customers. He believes
that although the centres may expand and diversify, plants will always
be the main part of Findlay Clark. ''We will always cater for Christmas
needs and have a large stock of bulbs and a choice of garden furniture
at the centres, but plants are the heart of the business.''
The Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988, he believes, did a tremendous
amount of good for the horticulture industry and the garden business in
general. Just before that festival David and Jean were joined by a third
director, Harry McDiarmid, recruited from the catering industry to bring
some bright new ideas to the business.
It was a conscious decision to bring someone in from outside the
gardening business; and the food industry David Clark believes, requires
the same manner of discipline, surviving on perishable materials with a
fast turnaround of goods.
Vistors to the Boclair Road centre will be familiar with The Famous
Coffee House, the conservatory centre and the saddlery business. ''These
are run by individual companies -- all specialists in their field,''
said David Clark. The businesses on site are those which will complement
the busy garden centre.
There are many ventures which the Findlay Clark directors have in mind
for the site, but the next one to open will be a pet centre -- something
which will no doubt be a great attraction for the younger visitors.
''We believe in pushing the business forward,'' said David Clark.
''We're proud of the Milngavie centre's first 25 years and look forward
to many more.''
Winter can bring as many glorious colours to the garden -- an employee
tends the large selection of winter pansies

WHY should businesses sign themselves up for 25-year office leases
when their business plan rarely looks more than three years ahead?
Sinclair Browne of agents Chesterton says that many companies are
increasingly reluctant to commit themselves for the length of time
preferred by institutional landlords. Pointing out that until recently a
lease represented a ''capital'' asset which could be sold on at a
healthy premium, he says that continued low inflation and controlled
economic growth are likely to prevent such gains for the next few years.
Launching Chesterton's latest research into the Glasgow office market,
Browne suggests that the current dearth of speculative development in
Glasgow might be addressed through innovative joint ventures.
''Institutions, having been for so long purchasers, are likely to become
more actively involved in the development process with joint ventures
between fund and developer becoming more common -- both parties sharing
the risk and the reward,'' he says. This will be increasingly common
where the fund has the ability to provide both short-term finance and a
long-term ownership for the development.
Recent examples of this new joint venture trend include: Clerical &amp;
Medical's scheme at 227 West George Street; National Mutual's 183 St
Vincent Street; Liverpool &amp; Victoria's 11 George Square; and Scottish
Amicable's 181 West George Street.
The Chesterton report also predicts that the provision of new business
parks close to the city centre will have a major impact on the Glasgow's
office market.
Browne says that there is around one million sq.ft of empty space in
the city centre, but half of that is unfit for letting without
redevelopment or refurbishment. ''With little speculative development
taking place in the early 1990s, the supply of good quality open-plan
space has been steadily eroded. At present there is no self-contained
building available in the city centre that provides in excess of 35,000
sq.ft.''
THE magnetic pull of the Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone has attracted an
engineering firm out of Glasgow and into the ''Supercounty''. In a
direct challenge to Glasgow's ability to hold on to its industrial base
in the face of financial incentives on the EZs, Kelvin Diesels is
relocating from Port Dundas -- where it has been based for more than 70
years -- to a new 29,000 sq.ft factory at Tannochside Park on the EZ.
Tannochside Park is one of nine EZ sites in north Lanarshire, all of
which offer attractive incentive packages to relocaters and business
start-ups. Tannochside is being developed jointly by Motherwell District
Council and the Lanarkshire Development Agency.

THE only new office scheme to be completed in Edinburgh's New Town
this year poses a challenge for its letting agents.
Now ready for occupation, Trafalgar House Property's 34,000 sq.ft
scheme at the corner of Princes Street and Castle Street is looking for
a rental of #17 per sq.ft. That is an ambitious target in the current
market, especially for a building which is not located on a traditional
office pitch. But with its impressive views of the castle and high
specification, letting agent Alan Robertson of Jones Lang Wootton is
confident of tying up a deal in the near future.
''We have not met much resistance to the location,'' says Robertson.
''It is an unusual pitch. But people see it as a spectacular site,
rather than as a disadvantaged one.'' The scheme has no car parking, but
spaces within a few minutes walk of the building are being organised by
Robertson.
His optimism is likely to grow when full details of a deal at the
31,000 sq.ft Conference House are revealed. The new building stands
adjacent to the International Conference Centre and was developed to
provide an income stream to meet the running costs of the capital's new
conference venue. Although letting agents Montagu Evans would not be
drawn on the subject, it is understood that some 7500 sq.ft in
Conference House has been let at a headline rent of #15 per sq.ft to
Edinburgh's Chamber of Commerce.
Meanwhile, the city is running short of modern quality space.
Robertson says that a space crisis has been averted only because of a
dip in the level of demand over the past nine months. ''But there are
now some signs that there could be a flurry of lettings towards the end
of this year. If this happens, then a shortage of good quality open-plan
accommodation may well emerge by next year,'' he says.
With only some 10,000 sq.ft of new open plan scheduled for completion
in Edinburgh next year, it would appear that 7 Castle Street and
Conference House have a window of opportunity to set new post-recession
rental records prior to 1997's completion of Exchange Plaza,
CALA-Morrison's 95,000 sq.ft speculative scheme fronting the western
approach road where it meets Lothian Road.
The joint letting agents at Exchange Plaza are Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
Ryden, and Jones Lang Wootton.

LAKE Coniston received a Breeders' Cup confidence booster yesterday
when handicap figures revealed he holds a clear advantage over his
rivals in the Sprint.
Britain's leading speedster, who has not raced since flopping at
Haydock last month, is rated 126 -- 6lb clear of America's best Classy
Mirage, and 8lb ahead of Hever Golf Rose.
A spin round a bend on Lingfield's all-weather track has satisfied
trainer Geoff Lewis that Lake Coniston, winner of the Abernant, Duke Of
York, and July Cup, can cope with the Belmont turn.
The trainer said: ''If he can produce his best form, he will win.''

BUSY Flight can bridge an eight-year gap since his trainer, Barry
Hills, was last successful in Newbury's Vodafone Horris Hill Stakes in
1987 with Glacial Storm.
The last-named was one of the better winners of this Group Three
contest in recent years -- going on to finish second to Kahyasi in the
following season's Derby -- but Busy Flight could give the race records
a much-needed boost.
On his latest start, he ran a fine second to Mick's Love in a
conditions stakes at Newbury, beaten just three-quarters of a length at
the line after staying on strongly through the final furlong.
Busy Flight had earlier caught the eye at Doncaster and he is taken to
maintain his upward curve of improvement by bagging this Group Three on
the way to greater glory.
Tumbleweed Ridge looks a formidable danger on form but might be run
off his feet in the closing stages.
Simon Whitworth and Gary Moore look to have a fine chance of televised
success with the consistent No Extras in the Gardner Merchant Handicap
over six furlongs.
Despite running well over both five and seven furlongs, the
five-year-old has always reserved his best form for this trip and can
gain due reward here for some brave recent efforts.
Most notable among those must be his latest run, where, giving weight
away all round, he failed narrowly by a length to peg back Coastal Bluff
and Fire Dome in the closing stages of a valuable handicap over the
minimum trip at Ascot.
With an extra furlong here, off the same mark of 100, and with his
favoured easy ground forecast, he should take all the beating.
If anything goes awry in the plans of Whitworth and Moore, Bold Effort
seems the most likely to benefit. He would come into it on his best
form, but might just fail to last out on this softer ground.
The best way to round off a televised treble would be to include
Paradise Navy.
Last time, he made eye-catching progress to take fourth place behind
Arian Spirit at Pontefract.
And although a line through the second, Unchanged, gives him plenty to
find with both Bean King and En Vacances, Paradise Navy looks very close
to putting in a big run and he will appreciate the conditions of the
Vodafone Group Handicap.

McGREGOR The Third, bred and owned in Perthshire, and a new recruit to
racing at the age of nine, won his second novice chase in 12 days at
Newcastle yesterday by a distance.
As at Carlisle, McGregor The Third, ridden by 3lb-claimer Brian
Harding, soon had the field well strung out. The 1-4 favourite jumped
boldly throughout never looked in any danger.
McGregor The Third is owned by Mrs Fiona Whitaker of Glenfarg and was
bred from her prolific mare Arctic Dawn, who, by the age of 25, had
produced more than 40 winners over jumps.
He carries Mrs Whitaker's colours, which Lucius carried to Grand
National glory for her in 1978. Like Lucius, McGregor The Third is
trained by Gordon Richards, but much of his skill in navigating fences
may be due to the four years he spent eventing.
Richards sent him back home to Perthshire as a three-year-old because
he considered him too weak and gangly. He now admits McGregor The Third
may turn out to be something special.
Peter Monteith consolidated his position at the top of The Herald
Scottish jumps trainers' championship when novice hurdler Done Well,
4-1, became his sixth winner of the season.

PARIS St Germain coach Luis Fernandez faces the sack if he cannot
guide his side beyond Celtic in the European Cup-winners' Cup.
Fernandez, who was capped 60 times for his country, has suddenly come
under threat after his team's slump in form.
Before the start of the season the ambitious men who run the Paris
club told Fernandez: ''You must win the championship, and you must win
the European Cup-winners' Cup.''
The Paris side looked on course for the French title when they won
their first six games. But, since then, they have stuttered and stumbled
to a sequence of four matches without victory.
Suddenly Fernandez, a hero as a player, is under fire. There is no
doubt that if his team lose to Celtic over the two legs then he will be
out of the job.
It is an enormous challenge for him, and Celtic, as they flew into
Paris, realise that the pressure tonight is on their opponents.
Parkhead manager Tommy Burns is still in the throes of rebuilding. He
recognises the enormity of his own job, but Celtic's expectations are
less than those which face the French.
Burns will be able to use some of his younger players. He will also be
allowed a lapse in view of Celtic's recent lack of European experience.
The pressure, without doubt, is on Fernandez, who admits: ''Celtic are
a side I would not have desired to play as early as this.
''They are an accomplished team, and our experience against sides from
Britain leaves us wandering exactly how well we can do.
''We know, to begin with, that we must have a victory in the Parc des
Princes, because, when we visit Glasgow, the supporters will be a
powerful factor in the game.''
How powerful they will be here in Paris remains a mystery. Fans who
were without tickets supplied via the Glasgow club are still buying
their places in the French capital.
It is believed now that more than 5000 supporters will be at the game,
which will produce a major security headache.
* EVERTON, winners of the cup in 1985, will need to beware the
free-kick artistry of Feyenoord veteran Ronald Koeman in Liverpool
tonight to keep their European campaign on track.
The former Dutch captain's curled free kick for the Netherlands
stopped England qualifying for the 1994 World Cup finals, and he fired
in an extra-time free kick to clinch Barcelona a 1-0 victory over
Sampdoria in the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley.
Feyenoord coach Arie Haan has selection problems with an injury to
defender Henk Fraser and suspended midfielder Peter Bosz.
Italy's UEFA Cup-holders, Parma, travel to Sweden to meet Halmstadt
but holders Real Zaragoza have a tough challenge at home to Belgian
league leaders Club Brugge.
Celtic fans will not be sad if Rapid Vienna, who hustled the Parkhead
team out of the Cup-winners' Cup in the season when Everton won it, are
given a hard night in Portugal by Sporting Lisbon.

JUVENTUS ... 4 RANGERS ... 1
SOMETIMES reality can cut deeply. Last night Rangers European
aspirations were lacerated by a team playing a different kind of
football from that witnessed in Scotland's top division.
Juventus were sharp, stylish and immensely skilful while Rangers were
sluggish, uninspired, and frankly inept by comparison.
Little went right for them, but to dwell on the poverty of their play
would be to deny the remarkable quality of the Italian champions.
Also, it would be insulting to Alessandro del Piero who demonstrated
why he has been hailed widely as the successor to Roberto Baggio.
Del Piero is not yet 21 -- his birthday is next month -- but as a
footballer, he came of age a long time ago, although it was last season
when he began to push for full recognition among a squad of gifted
performers.
Last night, he mesmerised and tormented defenders in equal measure.
In particular, the unfortunate Alex Clelland seemed to be victimised
by del Piero's genius, and it was perhaps inevitable that the defender's
temperament would break.
He had been assigned to the Juventus player early in the match, but
paradoxically was relieved when it became apparent he was chasing no
more than a shadow.
Clelland was moved away from his tormentor, but they came together
again in 52 minutes, only for del Piero to disappear as quickly as he
had appeared in front of the defender. The Italian's turning manoeuvre
was astonishing and again Clelland was left looking foolish.
It was too much for him to bear, and he sought out del Piero two
minutes later, scything his legs from beneath him.
The referee, Vadim Zhuk, had no alternative, and Clelland walked with
the jeers of the Italian supporters threatening to pierce his eardrums.
At least Clelland's suffering was over and perhaps because Juventus's
handsome triumph virtually guarantees them a place in the Champions'
League quarter finals, they might be more sympathetic when they play in
Glasgow in a fortnight.
With Borussia Dortmund beating Steaua Bucharest 1-0 -- also last night
-- it appears now as though the Germans are favourites to take the
second qualifying place from Group C.
Rangers could still qualify by beating Juventus and Steaua at Ibrox,
and then taking at least a point in Dortmund, but after last night, they
have no justification to believe other than that the dream is over.
Walter Smith, who suffered visibly as he watched Rangers being dragged
towards their heaviest defeat since the 5-0 thrashing by Cologne in
1982, will not admit publicly that it is all over, but he must know
Dortmund are unlikely to give up the advantage gained last night.
''I always thought that Juventus would be a two-game exercise but
Dortmund's result makes it very difficult for us now, '' he said.
''Clearly I am disappointed with the performance, but we all must take
into account the standard of team we have just played.''
Rangers fell three goals behind in the space of nine minutes by which
time Andy Goram had already excelled himself by denying the Italian
champions three times.
However, even he could not stand between Juventus and the three points
which they desired and in 15 minutes he was beaten by Ravenelli.
Clelland committed his first foul on del Piero deep on the left, and
from the free kick 22 yards out, Ravenelli's shot penetrated the
defensive wall with the ball taking a deflection off Craig Moore and
thus deceiving Goram.
Del Piero skipped away from the strangely sluggish Gordan Petric two
minutes later and supplied Ravenelli on the left. His chip was knocked
out by Goram, but Antonio Conte followed up and scored.
In 23 minutes del Piero was fouled by Moore, who was deputising for
the suspended Alan McLaren, and after having dusted himself down scored
the third. Moreno Torricelli tapped the ball to del Piero, and from a
tight angle he curled the ball over Goram.
It was an audacious piece of skilful play which had the Juventus
supporters chanting the youngster's name.
The nature of the start to the game left Rangers bereft of ideas and
their supporters sitting in silence after they had contributed raucously
to the pre-kick-off atmosphere and Smith said: ''We didn't start well at
all, and nobody likes to be beaten in that fashion.''
His players looked thoroughly dejected as they trudged off the pitch
at the end, and before John Brown, a second half substitute for Stephen
Wright, could find sanctuary in the dressing room, a Juventus fan
sprinted on to the pitch and swiped from his grasp the jersey which had
been given to him by one of his opponents.
A security man pursued the thief, retrieved the jersey, and gave it
back to Brown, although why the veteran should want a reminder of a
black night in Rangers history is hard to understand.
Too many of the Ibrox side's players failed to contribute properly to
the game and the manner in which they lost their fourth goal in 74
minutes was typical. Moore attempted to play a long ball forward to Oleg
Salenko, but he stood still while Ciro Farrara darted forward to
intercept. His header put Ravenelli clear and he beat Goram for a second
time.
Gough scored Rangers goal a few minutes later when his shot from long
range took a deflection off Torricelli and wrong-footed goalkeeper
Angelo Peruzzi, but it was no consolation at all, and there could be no
disguising the embarrassment which Rangers suffered.
Juventus's manager Marcello Lippi said that he had not expected the
game to be difficult although he never imagined his players would make
such an impressuve start. ''After the three goals in the first half, it
was all very simple,'' he said.
Although Paul Gascoigne might be fit for the return game, Rangers will
be without McLaren, Clelland and Gordon Durie who was booked last night
for a second time in this qualifying campaign.

SYMPATHY was the only real feeling that could be expressed for North
Schools after their 49-0 defeat by Midlands Schools at Dunblane in the
Bank of Scotland Under-18 inter-district championship. Yet suggest to
North Schools that they should not be in the schools district
championship and the very idea is met with instant opposition.
''Basically, if we do not play against better sides than we will never
know what standard we have to attain,'' contends Ken Deans, the North
Schools secretary. Admittedly, as Deans pointed out, North were missing
their Robert Gordon's College players and that meant gaps in key
positions. Significantly, with their full squad available earlier in the
season North, lost by a much smaller margin to South in the match at
Inverness.
North, however, have taken encouragement from their win at under-16
level over Lothian Schools at Prestonpans, suggesting that better
coaching in lower age groups is now having an effect.
But the immense logistical problem of bringing together a squad from a
huge area remains a major difficulty for North Schools, whose area
covers more than half of Scotland. Distances also create difficulties in
arranging inter-school matches, a problem which Deans claims could be
solved by selecting central venues such as Inverness for staging games.
The distance factor is made worse by the fact that there is no longer
a concentration of rugby-playing schools in the two urban areas,
Aberdeen and Inverness. Robert Gordon's College is now the only Aberdeen
school playing extra-curricular rugby, while in Inverness that
distinction goes to Millburn Academy.
But according to John Roxburgh, the Scottish Rugby Union's technical
administrator, the signs are that more schools in the North are now
offering rugby. His view, with certain provisions, is that North must
continue to play in the district championship.
''If you don't have district rugby, you are missing an essential rung
in the ladder,'' says Roxburgh, who adds: ''Adult sense must prevail if
it is obvious that a team will simply be put to the sword.''
One of the other problems for North Schools is that, with the
exception of Gordonians, there is at present no attractive adult shop
window. Highland RFC, which in its heady days occupied a place in the
first division of the former national league, has seen its fortunes slip
drastically and the only route now for aspiring players is with clubs
outwith the region.
Meanwhile, North Schools are taking their under-15 and under-16 teams
to the Borders this weekend for matches against Earlston High School,
Kelso High School, and Duns. It is all part of the enormous lengths to
which North Schools are going to try to improve their younger players.
''Many of the schools have only small fixture lists and have to
compete against other sports,'' says Ken Deans. He should know -- for at
Kingussie High School, where he teaches, shinty is king, closely
followed by soccer.
If that already makes it hard for rugby to survive, then there is also
a winter sport to contend with. ''Because ski-ing is so popular, we play
rugby only up until Christmas,'' says Deans.
Mountains, indeed, for North rugby.

LIKE all professionals who have pride in their work, Raith Rovers'
players will carry more than a modicum of faith with them on the plane
to Munich for their return UEFA Cup-tie with Bayern in less than a
fortnight.
Every player at this level will, or should, allow himself room for
optimism even if the odds are enormous against success, and at 2-0 down
against one of Europe's leading teams, they can safely say that is the
situation.
Players, and manager Jimmy Nicholl, will continue to talk about having
a ''slight chance'' of reversing that scoreline and even making it
through to the next round right up to their big moment in the Olympic
Stadium. By the time that arrives, they will have convinced themselves
that anything is possible.
Indeed, Nicholl was saying as much yesterday. ''There is no way this
is mission impossible. Any football match is winnable and if we get the
breaks we didn't get last night, who knows?'' That is how it should be,
otherwise there is little point in making the journey at all.
However, those of us not quite so involved will have to accept that
the wee Rovers will not be going any further in the competition, but we
will go to Munich hoping and praying that the team from Fife will finish
the night with their self respect intact.
Rovers have done so well in the past couple of years that a drubbing
from the Germans would be an unjust climax to their first foray into
Europe.
The gulf in class, inevitably, between teams of contrasting financial
and football status means that such a result is possible, but the
mixture of youth and experience that Jimmy Nicholl has forged is capable
of looking after itself in most companies.
If Rovers can put on as good a show as they did at Easter Road, when
players like David Sinclair, Colin Cameron, and Danny Lennon did not
look out of place, then they could emerge from this exciting adventure
with greater self confidence rather than less.
That is one of the hopes held by Nicholl. ''If a team like Bayern
cannot give us a drubbing, then we should have nothing to fear from any
team in the premier division. I want our players to gain from that
experience and use it here.''
''In the meantime Nicholl has the unenviable task of re-establishing
normality among players who were given an immense boost by the backing
of more than 10,000 fans in Edinburgh. They made enough noise to give
the impression there were 20,000 of them in Easter Road, and they stood
by their side.
Now Rovers will have to recondition themselves to play in front of
5000 at Stark's Park on a good day, and with a good deal fewer on away
ventures. The danger of losing their way in the premier division after
the highs of Europe is real enough and Nicholl will work hard at getting
them ready for the first tough confrontation, against Falkirk at
Kirkcaldy on Saturday.
The wonderful fans who turned up at Easter Road would do the team a
huge favour if they made their way to Stark's Park to give the lads a
lift. Nobody deserves it more.

<TEXT>
MIDDLESBROUGH'S new #4.75m Brazilian Juninho is set to make his debut
on the big screen, because of Manchester United's ban on away fans.
Redevelopment work at Old Trafford has forced the club to exclude
visiting supporters in order to satisfy the huge demand for tickets made
by their own followers.
But 'Boro are planning to combat the ban when they visit United on
Saturday week by showing the match live on a giant TV screen inside
their own new Riverside Stadium.
Club spokesman Dave Allan said: ''With the prospect of Juninho making
his debut, interest will be even higher on this occasion and we plan to
put 8000 tickets at #6 each on sale for the Main Stand.
''The screen we are using has already been used by Manchester United,
Manchester City, and Everton. We also have the option of bringing in a
second TV screen in front of the East Stand if the 8000 tickets are sold
out.''
United are set to lift their ban on away fans in a bid to inject the
atmosphere back into Old Trafford -- but too late for Juninho's debut.
Southampton could be the first visitors watched by their own fans when
they visit Old Trafford next month.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
BRIAN Irvine could defy the odds by playing in the premier division
within a couple of weeks, writes Ian Broadley.
The Aberdeen defender, who has multiple sclerosis, was given the
go-ahead yesterday to return to top flight league football just four
months after being diagnosed with the disease, which can prove fatal.
Dons' manager Roy Aitken, who saw 30-year-old Irvine come back
impressively in a friendly against Ross County, insisted: ''I never had
any doubts that Brian would play top class football again, because he is
such a determined character.
''Fortunately, he is only suffering from a mild form of MS, and the
medical experts have given him the all-clear to resume his career.
''He has done all the physical work in training, and now needs another
half dozen games to sharpen him up. He will play for the reserves
tomorrow night against Motherwell to take him nearer that target.
''His form in these games will decide when he plays again in the first
team. That is what he is concentrating on now, and that is where he will
do his talking.''
Father-of-two Irvine, a born-again Christian, declined to discuss his
recovery. But Aberdeen supporters' chief Roddie Arnott said: ''This is
fairytale stuff and fabulous news for everyone. I'm certain everyone
wishes him all the very best.''
Meantime, Aberdeen have enlisted specialist Dutch coach Gerrie van Eyk
to work with their goalkeepers.
CAMEROON goalkeeper Andre Boe is creating an interest among the
supporters of Morton. Around 300 turned out to see him make his debut in
a reserve match on Tuesday in a 2-2 draw with Dumbarton.
Morton coach John McMaster said yesterday: ''I could not believe it. I
don't think I have ever seen as many at one of our reserve games before.
''He is a fantastic entertainer and the crowd loved him. He was
flamboyant and put on a spectacular show, even coming up to the halfway
line when we were taking a corner kick.
''In fact we had to stop him going all the way into their penalty
area.
''He was desperate to get a game after waiting so long for his
international clearance, but now he can settle down and we will assess
him over the next few weeks.''
The Morton manager Alan McGraw returns home today after watching
Rangers in Italy and he can expect an increased offer from Dundee United
for midfielder Derek McInnes after their first bid of #300,000 was
turned down at the weekend.
SCARBOROUGH have their eyes on Dunfermline winger Paul Kinnaird. He
has left to spend some time at the English club with the prospect of
signing for them, although he is under contract to Dunfermline until
December.
Dunfermline's Dutch goalkeeper Guido van de Kamp will be available for
the home game against Dumbarton, though he had cuts inside and outside
his mouth stitched after being stretchered off during the game against
Dundee last Saturday.
Striker Hamish French, who has only played 10 minutes in the first
team since last March because of injuries, will make his comeback.
He played and scored in the reserves against Raith Rovers earlier this
week.
LIVINGSTON could receive double welcome news today at the Scottish
League Management Committee.
The committee are expected to set a date for an inspection of their
new stadium so that the club can move soon.
In addition Livingston chairman Bill Hunter is one of four bidding for
the vacant position as third division representative on the committee
following the resignation of Jack McGoogan, of Albion Rovers. The others
are Bill White (East Stirling), Pat Lawler (Alloa) and Martin Smith
(Queen's Park).

Brazilian genius promises fans he will score.
BRAZIL'S World Cup star Rai promised his adoring Parisian fans last
night that that he would score against Celtic in the European
Cup-winners' Cup clash at the Parc des Princes tonight.
Rai has just returned to the St Germain side after an injury which
kept him out at the start of the French season.
Yesterday, at the club's training headquarters, he said: ''This is the
most important match I have faced with the club. We know that there is a
sequence of results which we must deliver for the coach.
''We have important games in the championship, and we have these two
matches against Celtic. We know that we cannot lose any of them.
''Personally, I believe I will score against the Scottish side.
''We know about their team. We have been watching videos for the last
two days.
''Joel Bats has watched Celtic, and he has talked to us about the
problems they may set.
''We know, for instance that they are not a typically British team.
They will not play the kick and rush style which we associate with so
many of the sides over there. They are more similar to the game that
clubs play in Europe.
''They like to pass the ball, and to build patiently, and that is
something we have been made aware of.
''However, we know that they still have the spirit that British teams
possess. That is something that allows them never to accept defeat.
''And, for us, it remains the biggest problem of all when we must play
against a team from Britain. This spirit, this feeling, is something
that other countries do not duplicate.''
Rai recognises that his own club's form has given cause for concern to
the passionate Paris support.
But he insists: ''We have had many injuries. There have been too many
players, including myself, who have suffered this season.
''I have only returned to the team, and even while I have done so,
other players remain unavailable.
''There have been too many changes in our side to allow us to play as
we should do. The injuries have not affected just one area of the team.
There have been problems in the defence, and in midfield, and up front
in the attack and always the coach has had to chop and change.
''Now we are hoping that some of these worries can go. They must go,
otherwise our season will be over far too soon.
''That is something that we cannot contemplate. What we look for is a
victory over Celtic in this first match, enough of a victory to carry us
into the quarter-finals of the tournament.''
Celtic, of course, have different ideas. They know that they are
meeting the French cracks at a moment when they are being barracked by
their own fans, and when they worry about their own form.
Manager Tommy Burns, naturally, will not talk about the opposition
problems. He concerns himself with his own side.
However, the Scottish Cup-holders have watched Paris St Germain on
several occasions, and have seen the crisis in confidence which exists.
There is little doubt that Burns will look for at least one goal, that
he will attempt to have his foreign stars Andreas Thom and Pierre van
Hooydonk strike for what will be glory.
To get a goal away from home is vital nowadays in Europe. Burns knows
that and Burns knows, too, that his opponents will be vulnerable in the
Parc des Princes tonight.
Despite his own injury problems, the men he knows must be left out,
and the men he worries over, Burns will put out a side which will be
close to the strongest available to the Parkhead club.
There is little doubt that Thom and van Hooydonk are essential
components in his thoughts. The German, in particular, will relish the
European stage. He has the burst of pace, and the anticipation which
marks a player at this level.
If he can perform as he did in the previous round, albeit that was
against lesser opposition, then Celtic could return to Glasgow with the
result they want, and with the chance to join Europe's elite in the last
eight of this tournament.

Legia Warsaw 1,
Blackburn Rovers 0
THE wheels finally flew off for good on Blackburn's demolition derby
of a Champions' League campaign, as they crashed to their third and
fatal successive defeat against Legia in Poland.
Europe is littered with the wreckage of Rovers' highest ambitions:
Sweden last season, Spartak Moscow, Rosenborg, and now Warsaw this time.
Jack Walker and Kenny Dalglish, the men who built the Ewood dream,
chose not to witness this latest nightmare which condemns Ray Harford's
team to endure their final three games with only pride and points money
at stake. But after nothing from their first three, they look likely to
end up with precious little of either.
Harford, however, praised his team. ''We still have hope. We have a
chance with two home games to go,'' he said. ''That was more like the
Blackburn of old. The shape of the team was good and we looked quite
solid. The players looked comfortable with the system and confident. We
deserved to get something out of the game.''
A lucky twenty-fifth minute goal from 27-year-old hometown favourite
Jerzy Podbrozny revived that familiar sinking feeling for Rovers, who
needed at least a draw after having lost losing to the Russians at home
and away to the Norwegians.
Colin Hendry blocked Cezary Kucharski's cross, but the ball looped up
and into the middle to present Podbrozny with a simple header.
Blackburn put up a valiant show in the second half, inspired by the
titanic Hendry, but gained no reward for their best football of the
campaign. Spartak's comeback from 2-0 down to win 4-2 against Rosenborg
prevented it being an even worse night.

* THE injured wrist of Scotland's Pam Wright has responded to
treatment in time to line up in the 54-hole La Manga Club Spanish Open,
the final event of the season, which begins over the South course at La
Manga today, writes Bill Johnson.
Wright jarred her wrist when her club hit the roots of a tree during
the second round of the French Open last week, causing the Aboyne golfer
to pull out of the tournament.
''I have received treatment and while I can still feel the odd twinge
I am going to play,'' said Wright, who will be playing in her third
European event of the season.
Wright will have to play in at least three European tournaments next
year to be eligible for selection in Europe's team for the Solheim Cup
match against the United States at St Pierre next season.
Julie Forbes, another Aboyne player, has extended her run of top-10
finishes to five in her last six tournaments to move into twelfth place
on the Solheim standings. The leading seven will earn automatic places.
Marie-Laure de Lorenzi, who won her third title of the year in the
French Open last weekend, is the defending champion.

* A HAT trick by 18-year-old Raul Gonzalez led Real Madrid to a 6-1
demolition of Hungary's Ferencvaros in Group D and brought back memories
of Real's European Cup golden years.
Raul, majestic throughout, set Madrid on their way to their best win
of the season, scoring twice in the first half-hour. He crafted two
goals for Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano before completing his treble
with a sweet strike seven minutes from time. Defender Fernando Hierro
also scored, with a rasping free kick.
The win left Madrid second in Group D, three points behind European
champions Ajax, who maintained their 100% record with an easy 3-0 win
over Grasshopper Zurich and boosted their unbeaten European Cup run to
14 games. Patrick Kluivert opened early with a dazzling 20-metre strike
and added his second in 68 minutes. Finidi George completed the rout.
A fine goal just before half-time gave Panathinaikos a surprise, but
ultimately well-earned, 1-0 away win over Porto in Group A -- despite
being reduced to 10 men for more than half the game. The goal came when
winger Dimitris Markos dribbled across the area before sending in a
curling left-foot shot.
Porto's former England manager Bobby Robson, back on the bench after
being away from the game for two months for an operation to remove a
cancerous cist from his nose, said: ''It was an unhappy return, but that
is football. We had many chances and we suffered an unnecessary goal.''
French champions Nantes tasted success at last with a 3-1 victory over
Group A stand-ins Aalborg, the replacements for Dynamo Kiev, who were
banned for a match-rigging attempt.
Nicolas Ouedec opened the scoring in the fifth minute. But the Danes
equalised in the first minute of the second half when Jan Pedersen
neatly volleyed home a cross from the right.
The French were shaken out of their lethargy and scored 10 minutes
later through Reynald Pedros after good work by Japhet N'Doram and
Ouedec. The latter also set up the third goal for Pole Roman Kosecki in
75 minutes.

ALL last week the SRU were interviewing firms for the much needed
full-time PR job at Murrayfield. Among the gladiatorial contenders was
one firm from south of the Border who caused sharp intakes of breath
when they suggested that the SRU think of themselves as a type of bird
and try to imagine what type of bird they wished to be and wished to be
perceived as.
Duncan Paterson, say our spies, was not amused at the thought of the
SRU having to think of themselves as birds when they are trying to run a
multi-million pound business. Birds usually flit along the seashore or
soar high above us all, and this must be yet another trendy marketing
ploy. ''Right Duncy . . . so you're sitting on your nest see . . .'' It
seems clear to us at the diary, that the SRU can be either eagles, or
albatrosses.
Whatever, they need to be one of the flock and stop dropping things
from such a great height when no-one is looking.
* TALES reach the diary of Bruce Hay's legendary team talks as coach
of this year's highly successful Boroughmuir team based in Edinburgh.
Apt to lose himself in oratory as excitement sweeps the air, we are told
that prior to last week's game against Edinburgh Academicals the former
Scotland winger told his young team to concentrate and: ''Get your
clouds out of your head.''
More dressing room stories are welcome, and bets are being taken on
whether Hay mentions the hand in job, one time at a game, and tells his
team that if the opposition are on the ground then they are to bastard
the kicks.
Takes us back to a legendary team talk where Jim Telfer is exhorting
the then Scottish back row of Finlay Calder, Derek White, and John
Jeffrey to give their all for Scotland against the Irish. ''If your
granny was out there lying offside holding the ball would you kick
her?'' asked the now reformed Telfer.
Without waiting for their reply he told them: ''No you wouldn't . . .
but he would.'' said Telfer, pointing to Derek Turnbull who was sitting
on the bench.
The three were terrified as they ran on to Landsdowne Road. White
stopped the other two. ''It's OK, don't worry,'' he said in a remarkable
moment of self-composure. ''It's alright for Derek Turnbull to kick a
granny in the head. He is after all a policeman.''
* TALKING of policemen, Cecil du Plessis, the GHK second row who went
back to South Africa to play some games for Eastern Province after
having a close encounter with a breathalyser machine, has told GHK that
he is available to come back and play for the Old Anniesland club. ''We
are not sure whether we want to have him back so late in the season,''
said GHK director of rugby Andy Little.
A GHK confidant has told the diary that there is a possibility of du
Plessis now talking to Rangers goal keeper Andy Goram about the best way
of being ''not 100% right upstairs.'' It sounds like a marvellous
cultural exchange.
* IN these days of money, Waysiders Drumpellier found the ideal way of
luring Scott Hastings to talk to, and coach, their junior section when
they offered the services of top chef Willy Chalmers to the Scottish
centre. Chalmers, a prize-winning culinary master and Waysiders
Drumpellier member, is to rustle up a fabulous meal for eight at
Hastings' home, and the guest list will include Sean and Lynne Lineen
and Gavin and Dianne Hastings.
It sound like something Hello! magazine will be very interested in,
and Will Carling has asked if he can come. Tell us something, have you
ever felt left out of things in your life? Ever felt as if you are on
the outside looking in? Or, as Bruce Hay would say, on the in looking
outside?
* STRANGE goings on reach us from Cartha Queens Park coach Doug Smith,
who says that he found an old pair of his flared, hipster,
red-white-and-blue jeans in the attic the other day.
''I put them on, and when I played they used to be so tight round my
legs that they split down the seams,'' says Smith, who played for
Kilmarnock, West of Scotland and Glasgow High. ''But now there's two
inches of spare material there. The thing is that the waist stays two
inches apart too and I am the same weight. Why?''
A fascinating question I am sure we would all agree, and one that
would be well answered by the Labour party and the redistribution of
resources. They were lace-up fronts as well. You old trendy, Smith.
* GARNOCK rugby club have been battling against the odds ever since
their facilities, which had been among the best in the country, were
condemned when subsidence was discovered beneath them. They now have a
Portakabin. But that hasn't stopped the indomitable spirit of the men
from Kilbirnie who had an on-field presentation of a bottle of whisky
last week from the youngest club member, who is five, to the oldest, who
is 90.
Spotted at a game was referee, gym teacher, and founder member of the
club David Gunn. Jock Clarke, a man of letters at Garnock, remembers Mr
Gunn, who once warned him that he was about to play against a one-armed
opponent called John McGhee. ''Because he only has one arm,'' said Mr
Gunn to Clarke, ''I let him use his feet to tackle.'' Clarke remembers
being scythed down most of the afternoon.
McGhee, Clark, and Gunn are all still in the area. All a bit
frightening is it not?

BADMINTON
THE ongoing battle between the Scottish Badminton Union and the BBC
over their refusal to cover the endangered Scottish took on another
slant this week when sports editor Mike Abbott suggested the event was
not of a high enough standard.
Following an article in The Herald about lack of coverage for the
event scheduled for Glasgow's Kelvin Hall on November 22 to 26, Abbott
received a flood of letters.
A reply stated: ''One of the difficulties with the Scottish Open in
the past, despite its grading with the IBF, has been the standard of
players.''
Anne Smillie, chief executive of the SBU, said: ''The Scottish Open
always attracts the top European players.''

CONSIDERATION of the prospects for the #1m Alfred Dunhill Cup, which
begins this morning at St Andrews, were dominated by the forceful
denials of Greg Norman, probably the world's highest contemporary earner
competitively active in regular tournament golf, of allegations that his
demands for appearance money were excessive.
''I don't just fill my pockets up and take off,'' responded Norman, a
member of the Australian team. ''Am I greedy? I don't think so.'' Norman
calculated that he would accept fees at only eight of 24 tournaments
this year --in fact six, since at two of them he returns the money to
charity.
Norman also refuted claims that his absence from last week's World
Matchplay Championship was because of his insistence on a vast fee.
''They asked me last April if I was interested,'' he insisted. ''I said
'yes', but heard nothing more. When I missed the cut in the European
Masters I returned part of the fee. How many do that?''
Be all that as it may, Colin Montgomerie looked at the draw and
probably summed up the feelings of every other country when he said
yesterday: ''I'm glad Scotland aren't in Group One. We've every chance
of reaching the semi-finals.'' But the wiser counsels born of a
chastening experience brought a cautionary note.
Having avoided entanglement with the United States, Canada, Ireland,
and Sweden -- countries which have won the tournament on six of the 10
occasions it has been played over the Old Course -- Scotland have found
comparative sanctuary in Group Two, along with South Africa, the
Republic of China, and Germany.
By coincidence, the first two countries joined Scotland in round-robin
battle last year, when South Africa gained the semi-final place in the
18-hole three-a-side medal matchplay tournament. But it was in 1993 that
Montgomerie, forgivably in the circumstances, made the celebrated gaffe
that annually returns to chide him.
''If we can't beat Paraguay,'' the then captain declared, ''we might
as well go home.'' Whereupon Scotland lost to the South Americans, a
particular embarrassment on a links inflicted by the representatives of
a landlocked, Third World golfing nation. Little wonder Montgomerie
stated: ''This time I'm not saying a damned thing.''
As it is, although the Republics of China and Germany -- the latter
then Langerless but, in the person of Alexander Cejka who has won twice
in Europe this season, not entirely rudderless -- should be disposable,
the South African team of Ernie Els and David Frost, with Retief Goosen
replacing Wayne Westner, are likely to be as awkward to beat.
Incidentally, the star attraction of the pro-am competition, Sylvester
Stallone, who should have partnered Els, withdrew. No official
explanation was forthcoming but the suggestion was made that the actor,
scratch when he has taken on villains in his film career, suffered the
equivalent of stage fright at the prospect of a live audience for his
12-handicap golf game.
In the pecking order of the 16 teams China are, by the aggregate of
individual placings, ranked last in the Sony world list and the Germans
third last. Scotland, the team now led by Sam Torrance and completed by
Andrew Coltart, are fourth, a place above South Africa, and so again
their meeting on Saturday should be the decisive one.
Torrance and Montgomerie, first and second on the European Order of
Merit, have obviously been playing well and Coltart has recently
rediscovered some of his early-season form. However, no under-estimation
can be allowed since, for example, Chen Liang-hsi beat none other than
Nick Faldo two years ago.
Coltart has been given the task of confronting Chen as Scotland begin
their attempt to improve on five semi-final places and two in the final,
both of which finished in defeat by England. Montgomerie attributes this
nearly record entirely to coincidence. He said: ''We've had good teams
in the past and we've a good one this year.''
Australia and England, seeded second and seventh and both twice
winners of the event, are in the next strongest group along with Spain
and Argentina and with Nick Price in Zimbabwe's team in Group Three and
seeded third, the 48 players attempting to reach Sunday's final (the
winning of which will be worth #100,000 to each member of the side)
include 10 of the leading 23 in the world rankings and seven of Europe's
victorious Ryder Cup team.

SHINTY
SHINTY'S new premier league reaches the halfway stage this weekend
with Kingussie, perhaps predictably, having established a three-point
advantage over nearest challengers Fort William.
Inveraray's excellent run ground to a halt last weekend, although the
Argyll team should regain their momentum on Saturday when they go to
Oban Celtic.
Fort William, on the other hand, entertain Newtonmore, still smarting
from defeat at near neighbours Kingussie last weekend.
Kingussie go to Glenurquhart, who are trying to prevent their campaign
collapsing. All of a sudden things look very bleak for the Glen, who
have slipped down the table steadily in the past fortnight.
Oban Camanachd are still some way off top form and will still be
under-strength when they go to Govan to meet Glasgow Mid Argyll. The
city side taught Inveraray a lesson or two in finishing last week and
will no doubt want to build on that, their win hoisting them into third
place.
The intermediate and junior sides are in Balliemore and Strathdearn
Cup action. North teams feature in the pick of the the Balliemore games,
with Kinlochshiel entertaining Kilmallie and Inverness going to
Lochcarron. Beauly, from near Inverness, face the marathon journey to
Rothesay to meet Bute.
In Dunfermline, meanwhile, shinty's newest club is still celebrating
their 1-0 victory over St Andrews University.

TOM Griffith will make a tentative start to the season at this
weekend's West Open championships at Cumbernauld before embarking on a
two-month overseas training trip -- to Australia and Arizona -- geared
towards the Olympic trials next March.
The 22-year-old Scottish internationalist, recovering from a shoulder
injury, will line up at Cumbernauld after just a couple of weeks full
training.
Griffith's clubmate Alison Sheppard, the two-time Olympian who leaves
at the end of this month for six weeks training in Canada, has entered
the three shorter freestyles and the 100m backstroke at the West Open
event.

CRICKET
SCOTTISH cricket's domestic showpiece looks certain to return to
historic Hamilton Crescent next season -- despite the violence which
marred this year's Whyte and Mackay Cup Final.
But West of Scotland's Partick ground won't be hosting any big
representative games next season.
That means the Glasgow public will be starved of big game action after
the SCU decided to play Pakistan in Edinburgh. The Scots are also due to
play two home ties in the B&amp;H Cup but neither will be played in Glasgow.

Borussia Dortmund 1,
Steaua Bucharest 0
BORUSSIA Dortmund scored their first Champions' League victory,
following a defeat by Juventus and a draw against Rangers with a
second-half goal by 19-year-old midfielder Lars Ricken.
Already without strikers Stephane Chapuisat and Karlheinz Riedle, who
have been injured for months, Dortmund also played without German
international midfielder Andreas Moeller, who strained a calf muscle two
days ago.
Ricken, a German Under-21 international, filled the gap brilliantly
and nearly put Dortmund ahead after five minutes, but his right-foot
drive from the edge of the penalty area hit the left post.
Dortmund had few other openings in the first half against the
defensive Romanian team, whose 1986 side won the Champions' Cup.
The Germans increased the pressure in the second half and the efforts
paid off in 58 minutes. Knut Reinhardt broke through on the left wing
past two Romanian defenders and sent a perfect cross for the charging
Ricken, whose header to the far corner beat Steaua's World Cup
goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea.
Steaua then opened up and threatened Dortmund's goal on several
occasions late in the game.
Captain Anton Dobos, although sandwiched between Juergen Kohler and
Julio Cesar, rose over the two experienced Dortmund defenders to meet a
free-kick cross, but his header went just wide.
The Germans then held on to their hard-fought victory before a
sell-out crowd of 35,000.
Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld admitted afterwards that teenager's
Rickens' goal came as a major relief. ''We had most of the game and no
defensive problems. The goal set us free, and it was a fair result,'' he
said.

TROUBLED teenager Ronnie O'Sullivan suffered a first round defeat for
the second world ranking event in succession at the #330,000 Skoda Grand
Prix in Sunderland yesterday.
The woefully out-of-form former UK champion, who also failed to clear
the opening hurdle in the recent Thailand Classic, crashed out 5-2 to
Portadown's Michael Duffy in the biggest upset of the snooker season so
far.
Duffy goes forward to meet fellow Ulsterman Joe Swail who maintained
his solid start to the season by beating Scunthorpe's Jeff Cundy 5-3.
New Zealander Dene O'Kane, a semi finalist in the recent Thailand
Classic, demonstrated his new-found confidence during a 5-1 victory over
Leigh Griffin of Birmingham.
Dean Reynolds lost 5-3 to Basingstoke's Mark Flowerdew, but criticised
his opponent for slow play. ''Throughout my career I have never come
across a slower player than him,'' said Reynolds.
Darren Morgan, the world No.8, fired in an 85 break in the final frame
to edge Dubliner Stephen O'Connor 5-4.
Earlier yesterday Ken Doherty, beaten in his first two matches of the
new campaign, finally got on a winning track with a 5-0 first-round
whitewash of Derby's Matt Wilson.
Maltese speed merchant Tony Drago, the fourteenth seed, was also in
top gear as he raced to a 5-1 victory over Welsh veteran Doug Mountjoy.
Drago now meets Dene O'Kane or Leigh Griffin while Doherty takes on
Dean Reynolds or Mark Flowerdew.

JIMMY White battled back from the brink of another surprise defeat to
force his way into the last 16 at the #330,000 Skoda Grand Prix in
Sunderland last night.
The Londoner, almost three years without a major title, appeared to be
on his way out before he reeled off five frames in a row to pull off a
gritty 5-3 victory over Martin Clark.
Despite being laid low by a streaming cold, Clark established a lead
of 3-0 and 41-0 when he missed a straightforward green in the fourth
frame. White responded with a run of 45, and eventually cleared from the
last red to pink.
After the interval it was one-way traffic as the Whirlwind began to
blow with breaks of 104, 48, and 58.
The No.5 in the provisional standings, Nigel Bond -- finalist in this
year's world championship and also in Thailand -- lost 5-2 to French
Canadian Alain Robidoux.
Troubled teenager Ronnie O'Sullivan suffered a first-round defeat for
the second ranking event running. The out-of-form former UK champion

SCOTLAND moved a step closer to the final of the Emerging Nations
World Cup with a 38-16 victory over the USA at Northampton last night.
But for 30 minutes they were far from convincing, and the Americans
took a surprise 6-2 lead in the fifteenth minute, Rory Lewis's try being
converted by David Niu.
But relative experience of Scotland and the naivety of the USA started
to tell and the competition's second favourites eased home.
Graeme Thompson, who had opened the scoring with a twelfth minute
penalty, went on to bag 14 points.
Centre Darrall Shelford, brother of All Black Wayne, ran in three of

EDINBURGH-based Forth Ports has beaten West Coast arch-rival Clydeport
in the fiercely-contested battle for the Port of Dundee.
It emerged yesterday that Forth's #18.05m bid for the trust port had
been significantly higher than that from Clydeport, which teamed up with
the management and employees at Dundee in its attempt to expand on to
the East Coast.
Clydeport's defeat was its second in only two days.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the Rosyth 2000 consortium, of which
Forth is a member, had won control of the Rosyth Naval Base in Fife.
Clydeport had also mounted a bid for Rosyth, which was previously the
only major port in the Firth of Forth in which its East Coast rival did
not have an interest.
Caledonian Ports, the company formed by Clydeport and Dundee's
management and employees to mount the bid, received preferential
treatment.
With Caledonian having been granted a 5% ''price preference'', its bid
for Dundee would have been successful even if it had been as much as
#900,000 lower than Forth's.
Forth has been expanding aggressively in the last few weeks.
Even before last month's announcement of its #121.6m purchase of the
Tilbury docks in London, which will double its size, it was nearly twice
as large as its West Coast rival.
Clydeport, with operations at Hunterston, Glasgow, Ardrossan and
Greenock, will be disappointed not to have shaken its entire dependence
on the West Coast.
The actual cost of Dundee to Forth is only about #10m, including its
acquisition expenses. After the costs incurred by Dundee Port Authority
in the privatisation process are deducted from the #18.05m, half will go
to the Treasury and half will be retained by the new Forth-owned Port of
Dundee company.
Forth now has the East Coast pretty well wrapped up. Even before the
Rosyth and Dundee deals, it owned Grangemouth, Leith, Granton,
Burntisland, Methil and Kirkcaldy. It also has piped-cargo terminals at
Houndpoint and Braefoot on the Forth, which handle oil and related
products.
It was Forth's dominance of the East Coast which yesterday prompted
Dundee East Labour MP John McAllion to express concern for the future of
Dundee port. Local authorities will also be seeking assurances about the
future of the port from its new owner.
However, these concerns were dismissed by Forth Ports chief executive
Hugh Thompson, who promised to develop the port to its full potential.
He said: ''I think common sense dictates that anyone who is paying the
money that we are paying for Dundee would not let it languish. That
would be sheer madness.''
Although against privatisation in the first place, Mr McAllion would
have preferred a successful Caledonian bid. He believed Clydeport would
have had a vested interest in developing Dundee, seeing it as a rival to
Forth's East Coast operations.
Meanwhile, obviously referring to the same issue, Clydeport executive
chairman John Mather said: ''Given the current competitive ports
environment on Scotland's East Coast, we considered it important that
exporters and importers should continue to be offered a strong element
of choice.''
He also claimed that a higher bid by Caledonian would have constrained
the joint venture company's plans to develop Dundee and would not have
been in the best interests of the workforce there.
The vanquished Clydeport said it would continue to examine expansion
opportunities but did not specify what these might be.
Caledonian, whose chairman is Dundee Port Authority (DPA) chief
executive Captain John Watson, was supported by 90% of the 90-strong
workforce at Dundee.
Captain Watson, who will find out where he stands at a meeting with Mr
Thompson in London this morning, expressed the workforce's ''extreme
disappointment'' at the result of the auction.
He said: ''The relationships which developed between ourselves and
Clydeport from the beginning became very close indeed.
''We worked extremely well together and we enjoyed great support from
Clydeport and its board.''
However, speaking as chief executive of DPA, he claimed the successful
privatisation of the port was a success story.
He added: ''Along with that success, there has to be the enthusiasm
and the expectation of better times for this port along with a
substantial partner (Forth Ports) which has shown, particularly in
recent times, how strong it is.''
Richard Andrews, ports analyst at Edinburgh-based stockbroker Bell
Lawrie White, said: ''It is clearly disappointing for Clydeport.
''It would certainly have helped them if they could have moved away
from their complete exposure to the West Coast.
''Obviously the East Coast is better positioned for the bulk of trade
from the Continent.''
The battle for Dundee became a head-to-head battle between Clydeport
and Forth after John Sutcliffe &amp; Son, which owns the port of Boston in
Lincolnshire, withdrew from the contest in August.
Dundee port, with more than 1400 metres of wharves and 83,000 square
metres of warehouses and transit sheds, has maintained its leadership in
the handling of jute and related products.
More recently, it has diversified into the handling of grain, forest
products, agrochemicals, and oil and petroleum products.

offset by tax credits of #440,000, interest and finance charges of
#590,000 and exceptional items -- including loss on sales and
revaluation of grain stock, redundancy payments and a bad debt of
#93,000 incurred when Sorries Limited of MacDuff went into receivership
-- amounting to #564,000 meant the loss for the year was #683,000,
compared with a post-tax profit of #539,000 last year.

IMPORTANT concessions have been won for Scotland under plans to alter
the distribution of sheep and suckler cow grant aid.
Scottish Secretary of State Michael Forsyth is understood to have
personally intervened to gain protection for ''developers'' under the
forthcoming re-run of quotas affected by a recent English court
judgment.
The developers category is to be run again allowing producers
previously rejected under the Sheep Annual Premium and Suckler Cow
Premium schemes to have their cases reassessed, under new guidleines,
and those gaining entitlement will receive quota allocations from next
year and compensation for 1993-95.
If the new quota allocations exceed in total the amount left in the UK
national reserve, some quotas will have to be withdrawn in some
categories but these producers will also be compensated.
National Farmers' Union of Scotland president John Ross said: ''We
have won a fight to fair and reasonable treatment for quota holders
affected by the English court judgment.
''We now have a pledge that any existing holders who have their
allocation reduced will receive sufficient compensation to reinstate the
quota originally allocated. This, together with a less disruptive method
of administering and redistribution is a big step forward.''
Claimants to the 1993 reserve will be asked to re-apply for the
re-opened ''developer'' category plus producers who did not apply for
quotas because they fely they could not meet the original eligibility
criteria.
The Scottish Office also announced that there will be only one
application period for the 1996 Sheep Annual Premium Scheme, from,
December 4, 1995, to February 4, 1996, with the 100-day retention figure
running from February 5 to May 14.
The single retention period is believed to be forced on producers
because EU auditors were dissatfied with the accuracy of record keeping.
SFU chief executive Tom Brady said it was a disappointing decision.
''We argued against any change for 1996 being announced at this late
stage in the season because it gave producers insufficient time to
change their system to suit.''
Lord Lindsay, the Scottish Farming Minister, said the Scottish Office
had looked at ways which would have allowed a two-period retention as
well as moving a single period to 1997.
''But after exploring all options with the commission we concluded
that the measures that would be necessary to provide adequately
fraud-proof control would be burdensome and costly.''

<TEXT>
A NEW call has been made for reform of the agricultural holding laws
in Scotland to make things easier for owners and release more land for
tenancies, writes ROY GREGOR.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland (RICS) has
just published results of a survey of over 1000 landowners, covering
nearly 1.7 million acres, which shows that 56% of let land is held on
unconventional tenancies with limited partnerships making up 40% of new
lettings in the last 20 years.
Peter Graham of RICS said: ''The existing legislation is too
restrictive with landowners chosing to farm land in hand, or devising
complex letting arrangements to avoid security of tenure.
''The survey confirms that a deregulated system would lead to more
land becoming available to let, opening up greater opportunities for
young entrants with fresh ideas and enthusiasm and for those keen to
expand their farming businesses.'
He said that greater freedom of contract would allow non-agricultural
uses such as tourist enterprises and farm shops to be negotiated into
tenancy agreements in a way that was not possible within traditional
agricultural tenancy.
''It is time for the Government to act in introducing a simpler legal
framework in Scotland to help revitalise the tenanted sector which is
fundamental to a healthy farming industry.''
The RICS key policy recommendations are:
* A simpler more flexible legal framework enabling rural owners and
farm busineses to make agreements suiting their individual needs.
* Adequate safeguards to compensations for tenants' improvements,
rights to arbitrations and length of notice to terminate.
* Existing tenancies should remain unaffected.

ECONOMY
RETAIL sales in September failed to show the expected bounce back
after August's sharp decline, blamed largely on the hot weather, and
were broadly unchanged on the month to leave a year-on-year reduction of
0.4%. This completely wrongfooted City analysts whose expectations had
centred on a monthly increase of around 0.6%.
The official reason for the divergence -- actually the outcome seems
to tally with the recent CBI Distributive Trades Survey which showed
sluggish High Street sales in the month -- is that higher food prices
met with consumer resistance. The figure, though, is yet another
indication of the lack of consumer confidence.
However, the September jobless data, showing the largest drop in
unemployment this year and much more than projected, together with
August's underlying average earnings growth of 3.25%, unchanged on July,
and a slight decline in unit wage costs growth to 3.5% were considered
much more acceptable.
The jobless figures in particular helped boost share markets although
the FTSE-100 Share index, which finally closed at a new all-time high of
3593.0, up 30.8, is still mainly driven by takeover speculation and Wall
Street. In foreign exchange markets, the influencing factor was more the
contracting US trade gap, with the pound up against the German mark but
lower against the dollar.
CBI director-general Adair Turner yesterday reiterated that the next
move in interest rates should be down but that it also had to be
sustainable. Because of that the CBI is not pressing for a cut at the
moment as it would be dangerous. He added: ''We are not in favour of an
increase in rates and we would oppose that.''
The underlying picture for retail sales last month was mixed. A 1.3%
fall in the food sector offset rises in many other areas. Sales of
textiles, clothing and footwear were up 1.6% even though there was a
price rise of 3.9% in clothing and footwear. However, even non-food
retail sales did not recover all the ground lost in August.
Yesterday British Retail Consortium trading policy director Hugh Clark
commented: ''September was a tough month for retailers with no volume
increase on last year. The exceptionally dry weather in August and
relatively mild weather in September had a combined negative effect,
pushing up inflation in food and limiting sales of traditional autumn
mechandise. Small traders suffered badly.''
Consortium director-general James May argued: ''These figures confirm
that there is an economic case for tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget as
well as political ones. After two years of substantial tax rises, the
time has come for the Chancellor to ease the tax burden on consumers.
Retailers will be looking for some action on this front in next month's
Budget.''
Wholesale prices have continued to rise but retailers are prevented
from passing these on because of consumer resistance in a competitive
market place. However, inflation figures for September released last
week showed the underlying annual rate unexpectedly rising from 2.9% to
3.1% against a market forecast of 3%. The Chancellor said at the time
that the figures were still being distorted by the aftermath of a hot
summer on food prices.
Yesterday's disappointing retail sales figures may be the the
corollary to this. So far as the data has any implications for interest
rates, securities house James Capel's Adam Cole considered that the
lower than expected retail sales figures were likely to be offset by the
larger than expected fall in unemployment. And while the next move in
rates is expected to be down, he did not think this likely until early
1996.

OIL AND GAS
THE 145-tonne sub-sea manifold for the Foinaven field to the West of
Shetland has been completed by Babcock OGL at Rosyth and is ready to be
shipped to its destination.
The #5m state-of-the-art manifold, which took 10 months to build, was
constructed by Babcock for the Cameron Division of Cooper Cameron which
was responsible for the overall design.
The manifold is one of two which lie at the heart of the system
designed especially for the BP/Shell co-venture from which the first oil
is expected to be brought ashore early next year. The second structure
is under construction at Rosyth.
The Foinaven field lies in water depths of between 400 and 600 metres
and since divers cannot work at these depths the Foinaven system has to
rely heavily on advanced sub-sea technology and remotely operated
vehicles (ROVs).
One of the fundamental concepts in the design was to ensure that no
single failure could lead to a field shut-down.
The manifold will be installed by the semi-submersible vessel Iolair
and maintained by ROVs throughout its 25-year-lifetime.
The first manifold will handle eight gas lifted production wells and
potentially two gas injection wells and will be located approximately
3.5 kilometres from the Petrojarl Foinaven, the floating production,
storage and offshore loading system for the field.
* ABERDEEN-based Atlantic Power &amp; Gas has teamed up with the mighty
Rolls-Royce to form a new oil and gas service company.
International Maintenance Management, in which Rolls-Royce and
Associates and Atlantic each own a 50% stake, will offer North Sea
operators a ''planned lifetime management'' service.
It claims application of such management to support activities can
minimise the life-cycle costs of an installation.

SCOTTISH Television's largest shareholder, Flextech, has confirmed
that it has sold its cable TV businesses for #62.6m to the biggest
postal and telecoms company in the Netherlands, KPN Kabel.
The businesses being sold hold cable franchises in Andover, Oxford,
Stafford and Salisbury. The franchise areas include around 216,000
homes. Latest figures show they had just under 4000 subscribers between
them out of the 25,000 homes passed.
Flextech said it was selling the cable interests because they were not
seen as a core business. The disposal represented a continuation of its
strategy to focus on making TV programmes.
At the end of August, Flextech swapped its 20% stake in HTV and #64m
cash for the 20% holding in Scottish. That diluted Mirror Group's
holding to 16%.
Since then, there has been speculation the Glasgow-based company would
seek to merge with the Welsh and West of England TV contractor.

RETAILING
PROFITS of Body Shop fell sharply in the six months to August despite
a 15% rise in sales to #239m, but the group still expects little change
for the full year compared with 1994-95's #33.5m.
Chairman Gordon Roddick, husband of founder and chief executive Anita
Roddick, said the 26% fall to #9.1m in profits was in line with
expectations. The interim dividend is raised by a fifth to 1.08p.
Body Shop had earlier warned that the current year would be one of
consolidation and Mr Roddick said the phasing of overhead increases
meant operating costs would rise more modestly in the second half, the
more important trading period.
Body Shop is pushing to become a global retailer and it opened 90 new
shops in the six months bringing the total to 1300 in 45 countries.
Europe had the most new openings at 34.
Like-for-like sales were 1% ahead, with Asia the best performer and
the US remaining the laggard. There was an operating loss of #2.4m in
the US, where Body Shop faces competition from lookalikes. The group is
aiming to open 40 new outlets this year, raising the number to 275.
First-half comparable sales were down 8%, but Mr Roddick said that in
the past seven weeks sales were running at just 2% below last year. A
new advertising campaign is to be tried out shortly.
The UK performed better, with comparable sales up 2%, helped by the
expanding home selling operation. Since the half-year end sales have
been running 5% above last year. Profits were lower as a result of
higher overheads.
In Asia sales were up 15% and the region was largely responsible for
the 29% increase in international profits. The group is moving into
Japan, with 60 stores planned by the year-end.
Overall, Mr Roddick said Body Shop was making progress with the
long-term strategy of driving sales growth and was on target for at
least 150 store openings in the current year. The shares slipped 6p to
135p.

Fifteen years ago Lille was
a city going nowhere. Then a
man with a dream gave the
metropolis a new platform
for growth and prosperity:
a Eurostar terminal.
Anne Johnstone finds a city
poised to take 'a quantum
leap into a radical future'
ACT ONE. Scene One. It is May 16, 1982. The Anglo-French summit is on
and Margaret Thatcher is dining at Hopetoun House outside Edinburgh.
Across the table is Pierre Mauroy, French Prime Minister and veteran
socialist. Politically they have little in common but Thatcher is in a
rare mellow mood. The news from the Falklands has been excellent. Mauroy
puts on his most ingratiating smile and broaches a subject close to his
heart.
''I had a dream,'' he told her. ''In my dream I travelled directly
from Lille to London by train.'' Thatcher appears surprised. She has had
a similar dream, she tells him. In her dream her car gets from Britain
to the Cote d'Azur without encountering a single red light. The two
Premiers agree to discuss the matter further. The Channel Tunnel is back
on the political agenda.
Act One. Scene Two. It is January 20, 1986. We are at Lille City Hall.
Francois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher are signing the Channel Tunnel
agreement. Seated behind them is the mayor of Lille. His name? Yes,
Pierre Mauroy. Over the next two years Mauroy, though no longer Prime
Minister, is able to use his considerable influence to ensure that the
line of the Paris to Calais fast train (TGV) passes through the centre
of his city instead of by-passing it as originally intended. At a single
stroke Lille is back on the map.
Today Lille, perhaps more than any other European city, is on a fast
track to the future. It is an extraordinary feat because only 15 years
ago the city seemed to be going nowhere fast. If you know Glasgow, the
first part of this story has a very familiar ring.
During the last century, Lille grew like a stain, absorbing
surrounding villages and throwing up mills and breweries as it went. But
by the 1970s the whole Nord Pas de Calais region was in rapid decline.
The mines were closing. The textile industry, the engine which had
hauled the local economy for a century, was in freefall, undermined by
competition from the Far East. This, combined with the migration of the
bourgeoisie into the surrounding countryside, left entire districts of
the city derelict and abandoned.
Urban renewal was by bulldozer. The city attempted to tackle its
dreadful housing problem with a strategy known as ''operation tiroir''
(drawer), flattening whole areas and rebuilding with high-rise blocks.
But the higher rents being charged in the new blocks had the effect of
driving poorer residents out to older unmodernised areas in the
adjoining towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing. This merely compounded social
and economic problems in those areas.
As if that wasn't enough, Lille managed to compound its problems by
exporting its ancient university, and with it much of the city's
cultural life, to a soulless new town on the edge of the metropolis.
And, though Lille has been reasonably successful at attracting service
industries, unemployment has remained stubbornly high (13.4% across the
arrondissement of Lille and much higher in some areas within it).
To add insult to the injury, the French structure of government
appeared ill-adapted for tackling urban renewal. On one hand, government
decision-making was highly centralised, a tradition stretching back to
the Napoleonic era. On the other, the basic unit of local government was
the tiny commune, which fragments urban government.
Nearly 30 years ago Lille recognised this and began moulding all the
communes in the metropolitan area (pop. approx one million) into one of
France's few ''urban communities''. Today 87 communes make joint
decisions about planning, highways, water, public transport, and waste
disposal. As Britain destroys regional government, France is creating
it.
In Lille its achievements include the futuristic VAL, the world's
first and now much-copied driverless Underground trains. Opened in 1989,
today it carries more than 45 million passengers a year. There's also a
joint ticketing scheme between bus, VAL, and trams (which Lille has had
the wit to retain).
At the same time Lille underwent a Glasgow-style facelift. Key public
buildings, including the old Lille-Flanders station, were cleaned and
renovated. Some imaginative planning and traffic management enabled the
creation of several new squares, complete with fountains, works of art,
and pavement cafes. For the Lillois themselves these squares marked a
vital psychological change.
Private developers snapped up the crumbling houses and workshops in
the old town. Chic young couples began to move back into the area.
Tourists started to come to Lille, other than by accident. So far in
this tale of two cities, Lille and Glasgow are on pretty level pegging.
Five years ago, all that changed.
The French are famous, some say notorious, for their love of ''grand
projets''. Little Lille (the city itself has just 172,000 inhabitants)
is no exception. Bringing the Eurostar terminal to the centre of the
city was the first piece in the jigsaw. The spanking new Lille-Europe
station is an extraordinary light-filled multi-layered structure of
glass, steel, and concrete, full of bustling walkways and escalators
under an undulating roof. Beside it lay an uninspiring 288-acre tract of
mud, recently vacated by the military. In 1990 a semi-public planning
and development company, Euralille, was created to exploit it.
In 1991 work began on what's been dubbed ''the biggest European
construction project since the rebuilding of Berlin''. Imagine Glasgow's
Central Station, the St Enoch Centre, Princes Square, Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall, the SECC, and a giant version of the projected commercial
development on Pacific Quay, all on one site. Add restaurants, a hotel,
a business school, a multilingual primary school and 6000 parking spaces
and you can imagine the scale of Euralille.
Dutchman Rem Koolhas, the chief architect, claims his project will
launch Lille on ''a quantum leap into a radical future''. It is
symbolised by the absurd-looking ski-boot-shaped office block dominating
the site. So far #620m has gone into Euralille, less than one-third of
it from the public purse. Most of the building work is done, though the
''Matisse Park'' is still something of a euphemism and a lot of the
office space is unlet.
I found Lillois generally excited about their ''new town within the
city''. The students and businessmen may not have moved in yet but the
place is already a seething mass of travellers and shoppers, a city on
the move.
Supporters say Lille was condemned to a long slow death without a
megaproject like Euralille. They argue that it has brought work and is
attracting tens of thousands of high-spending Belgians to a city which
in recent years has made virtually nothing of its proximity to its
richer neighbours.
Detractors say Euralille typifies a psychology which addresses
monumental projects but ignores human need. Environmentalists attack it
for creating the world's biggest underground parking lot in a city
officially committed to taking cars out of the city centre. They
question whether Lille can fill the cavernous elliptical ''Grand
Palais'', with 5000-seat concert hall and three conference halls. Most
of all they wonder whether Euralille-style developments don't merely
polarise communities, geographically, socially, economically.
It's easy to catch the excitement of the new Lille among the upwardly
mobile, toying with their designer salads along the verandahs of the
Euralille Centre, as alongside the latest bullet train-like TGV
disgorges another load of high-speed travellers from Paris, Brussels or
Waterloo. In the centre of Lille the only signs of social dislocation
are the young homeless begging around the station and attempting to sell
Macadam, the French version of the Big Issue.
But travel a few miles north-east to the traditonal working-class area
of Roubaix and the picture changes radically: here, small decrepit
houses line narrow streets around silent factories.
Roubaix has lost 30,000 jobs in 15 years, and it shows. Once dubbed
''the town of 1000 chimneys'', Roubaix's chimneys now disgorge more
buddleia than smoke. The twinning with Bradford is a bit of an
embarrassment.
Wool and textiles once wove Roubaix together. At one time 4000 workers
flooded each day through the gates of the knitting-wool people ''La
Lainiere de Roubaix''. Today they employ barely 400. There's worse down
the road at the former Ugine Kuhlman soap-powder plant. First you come
on two giant slag heaps stuffed with phosphates, chrome, nickel, and
other assorted nasties. The factory itself is empty and vandalised.
It isn't that money hasn't been spent on Roubaix, just that a lot of
it has been spent badly. A commercial complex, optimistically christened
''Roubaix 2000'', is being demolished this autumn after running into
problems. Smart new workshops remain empty years after completion.
''Roubaix is an ugly, dirty, sad town with social problems so nobody
wants to come here. We've lost 6000 people in the past few years and we
need to lose more,'' says Michel LeCoeur, a local journalist.
Local literature makes much of the Euroteleport, a sophisticated
telecommunications centre, based in an old textile mill, but LeCoeur
says few locals found work there.
The most serious attempt to tackle the problems of areas like Roubaix
was with one of the first examples of a ''Contrat de Ville''. Comparable
in some ways with the English City Challenge initiative, there's one
important difference. The strategy is based specifically on the need to
tackle the problems of disadvantaged groups. The Contrat de Ville is
intended to counterbalance the cuckoo-in-the-nest effect which a project
like Euralille can have.
In Lille's case, following a historic agreement between all the
communes in the area, a #214m programme was agreed, including help for
the homeless and the handicapped, creche facilities, water pollution
measures, and apprenticeship programmes. Because the state element in
the funding (40%) is guaranteed, local authorities feel confident about
adding their own contributions, without the traditional fear that this
will result in the state cutting or withdrawing funding.
A second imaginative project involves turning the stinking, polluted,
abandoned Roubaix canal into an urban park, using it as a catalyst for
transforming the image of the whole area. Others, including LeCoeur,
believe a more straightforward way of bringing new life to Roubaix would
be to push a motorway along the canal to link Lille with the Belgian
border. It is too early to tell whether such initiatives are capable of
turning around an area with such entrenched problems, but one can't help
admiring the single-mindedness with which the French tackle such tasks.
What does Lille show us about Glasgow? Several things, all rather
depressing. Despite recent British initiatives, mainly south of the
Border, the French Government has a much stronger cities policy. While
Britain poured its post-war heart into new towns and garden suburbs, the
French always retained the concept of cities as hubs for regional
regeneration.
There's a big difference between talking to politicians and civil
servants in Lille and Glasgow. The French exude an impression of ''can
do'' style empowerment. No wonder. They have much more power, for while
Thatcher emasculated city halls, Mitterrand was giving his hotels de
ville new powers. New forms of local government, like packing the
previously warring communes into Urban Communities, have enabled areas
like Lille to pack a much more powerful economic punch.
That's because they are based not just on those who live in city
centres but also those who work, play, and learn there but live on the
periphery, often beyond the city boundary. Developments in Lille, like
the VAL and Euralille, could not have happened without a powerful
unified body and large public finance incentives for acting together.
Strathclyde may have been bureaucratic and unwieldy but at least it
was large and powerful enough to take important strategic decisions.
Cities can't influence their own futures if they don't have the
structures or spending power to do so.
Secondly, the frenetic pace of Lille's recent renaissance is based on
the old business adage that the three secrets of success are: location,
location, and location. More than 100 million people live within 300km
of Lille. It is a natural transport and communications hub. The TGV
network is bringing Calais 60% closer to Lille in time terms, Paris 50%,
London 50%, Brussels 70%. Soon it will be possible to go to Marseilles
and back in a day.
These developments have enormous implications for Lille's potential as
a trading centre, while peripheral European cities like Glasgow are
likely to find their geographical disadvantage compounded by lack of
investment in transport links.
Thirdly, this is a touchy and controversial area but Lille
demonstrates the importance of forceful, visionary political leadership.
One distinct difference between British and French politics is the
degree to which French politicians, even in high office, continue to
work for the regions from which they came.
The story of Lille is basically the story of Pierre Mauroy, French
Prime Minister between 1981 and 1984 but also mayor of Lille for more
than 25 years and president of the Urban Community. Even those who
loathe him, admit the TGV coup, Euralille and the Contrat de Ville could
not have happened without him.
''He has big, simple visions and the guts and influence to go for them
and make them work,'' says one Lille planner. Where is Glasgow's Pierre
Mauroy?

Want to make a career change? Or have you been forced to? Either way,
Heather Lyle, who runs KPMG Career Consulting in Scotland, may just be
the person to speak to
HOW many people do you know who don't like their job? What's more, how
many do you know who don't even expect to like work? How many see it as
totally separate from life outside, working to live and breathing a sigh
of relief at the end of the week?
In a 1992 survey by the Roper Organisation, 45% of US workers said
they would change their careers if they could. Numerous recent studies
suggest the UK is no different.
Redundancy or sudden unemployment can be the triggers which finally
cause an individual to question whether they are in the right line of
work.
However, as people's quality of life expectations increase, the
remainder of the nineties will see a growing trend in mid-life career
changes. People will increasingly search for work they feel they can
really believe in.
People can alter their career in varying degrees -- they may stay in
the same industry but change function. They may change the scope of
their role; move into a different industry; move from public to private
sector, or go from employment to self-employment.
They might make these changes at any time of life. Commitments,
priorities, personal goals and the balance between home and family all
change as time goes on and they govern the part a career plays in our
lives.
Many of the people with whom we work at KPMG come to us knowing that
they want a change but are not sure what. So just how do they go about
making a major career change?
Jane was disillusioned with working in a research role for a charity
which seemed to her to be overly political and to present little
opportunity for career advancement. She wanted to do something
different, perhaps something that would require retraining.
Jane went through a series of stages deciding what she wanted to do
and how she would do it:
Who am I?
She assessed her skills, talents and experience to decide what she had
to market to a potential employer. She also thought about her values --
what was important to her in a job, the sort of organisation and
environment in which she would be happiest.
Where am I going?
She then spent time discussing and identifying her aims and ambitions.
By this time Jane was clear that she wanted a job that would be more
closely involved with people. She also wanted to keep up the renewed
academic interest awakened during a part-time MSc course she had just
completed. She had never considered teaching, but felt this seemed a
very attractive option.
How do I get there?
This was when she researched the job market to work out what needs
there were -- and what opportunities that might match both what she
could offer and what she wanted. She aimed to make any job search as
targeted as possible. She talked to as many people she could think of
who had any connection with the profession and eventually decided
primary school teaching was for her.
She has now successfully completed a training course and has just
begun her first teaching job. What prepared her best for her career
change was meeting and talking to other teachers.
Many people decided to start their own business. Sometimes this is a
question of extending the time currently spent on a hobby to full-time
work.
One senior manager who had worked with a major computer manufacturer
for 20 years decided he wanted to develop his interest in playing the
piano and now has a full-time entertainment business, playing at clubs,
parties and even the odd ballet lesson.
He said: ''I just love it. I am lucky in having always dabbled in
entertainment work through my piano, and this has given me the contacts
to develop this further into something which gives me sufficient income.
I just needed to have the courage to try it -- so far it's working.''
An insurance administration manager who wanted to have more freedom
and more social emphasis in his work began to look at opportunities in
the leisure industry.
Having taken advice on what he needed to consider before setting up a
business and the potential problems he had to be aware of, he decided to
enter into an agreement with a major brewery to manage a pub.
He visited some 20 pubs and talked to the publicans as part of his
research. ''As well as giving me lots of ideas about what can bring the
customers in, the people I talked to gave me invaluable information
about the life of a pub manager which enabled me to assess whether the
change would suit me. I have and it has.''
At KPMG we have seen many success stories of career changes and they
are all very different. They are all similar in one respect however.
They require courage, decision and self-awareness.
The individual needs to say: ''If I don't take responsibility for
working out what will make me happy and satisfied, and doing what it
takes to achieve this, no-one else will.''

SHARES of WH Smith yesterday recovered strongly, rising 23p to 379p,
on the back of a reassuring statement from chairman Jeremy Hardie at the
annual meeting.
Group sales were up 8% in first quarter trading to early September,
despite the hot weather, which tends to keep people out of the shops.
Smith shares have underperformed this year as the group has been hit by
competition, particularly from supermarkets moving into books,
magazines, and stationery.
However, profits for the first half of the year will be down heavily
as a rssult of #20m of costs incurred to improve performance, including
redundancies in the wholesale newspaper business and in the retail
headquarters. There will also be a major rise in advertising costs.
Mr Hardie commented: ''We have taken firm action across the group.
From these changes will arise improving overall efficiency and levels of
productivity which will enable the company to move forward in the
trading year 1996-97.''
The sales gain so far has been concentrated in Virgin Our Price record
stores and also Waterstone's bookshops which saw sales rise 16% and 14%
respectively. The music shops were boosted by good sales of the Blur and
Oasis groups.
However, in the flagship WH Smith chain, which is the main problem
area, like-for-like sales were only 1.4% ahead.
Analysts consider Waterstone's margins could come under pressure
following the end of the Net Book Agreement. This has paved the way for
further discounting, though Mr Hardie said his group was confident of
improving further on its position as market leader.
The 219 Do-It-All DIY stores have been hit by depressed demand and
strong competition so that its sales were down 7.5%. But the 78 revamped
stores did see a small improvement.
Newspaper distribution achieved a 12% gain, helped by extra
territories gained from recent contract negotiation, but office supplies
were only 2.5% up.

FALKIRK-based Walter Alexander, Britain's biggest bus builders, is set
to help build vehicles in China.
It has formed a partnership with the Kowloon Motor Bus Company, Hong
Kong's largest franchise bus operator, to set up and assembly line in
the People's Republic of China.
The joint venture, to be called Dragon Pioneer International, will
become the investment vehicle and sales outlet for another joint venture
between Dragon Pioneer and the Chinese-owned Jinbaoma Bus Industry
Company.
The new assembly line will be set up in the Guangzhou province and the
first buses are expected of it early in 1997.
A delegation of top Chinese officials yesterday visited the
Stirlingshire plant as part of the process to finalise the deal.
Teams of experts in the engineering and technical field will travel
periodically to China to oversee the construction and operation of the
assembly line which will eventually be developed into a full
manufacturing facility.
Alexander's chairman John Fleming described the partnership as a
''extremely important development''.
He added: ''The potential in the Asian market is very considerable and
an agreement of this sort is very important to the future development of
the company.
''We are very honoured to have achieved such a high-calibre
partnership.''
A company spokesman for Alexander, taken over earlier this year by the
Mayflower Corporation, added: ''The opportunites in China are quite
fantastic. We can only hope that this agreement may lead to greater
things in the future.''
During the last two weeks, Alexander has secured orders worth almost
#30m.
The biggest came from Perth-based Stagecoach for 660 bodies, which
will lead to the recruitment of another 100 coachbuilders to help tackle
the #20m order.
Another #5m order was placed by Hong Kong City-bus for 50 hi-tech
double deckers and Dublin Bus ordered 70 double deckers at a cost of
#4m.

Dearborn, Michigan, Wednesday -- Ford Motor Company, today said its
third-quarter profit plunged by 68% as the costs of new model launches
and component shortages hurt earnings.
Ford said it earned $357m, or 28 cents per share, in the quarter,
compared with earnings of $1120m, or $1.04 per share, last year.
Its worldwide sales and revenues improved slightly to $31.4bn from
$30.6bn in the quarter.
The company said sales to domestic dealers in the quarter fell 12% to
869,000 units from 992,000 units.
Net income from its US automotive operations fell 66% to $187m from

of the mortgage book of HYPO-MSL (Mortgage Services Ltd) boosted the
society's assets to more than #7000m and lifted above the Yorkshire
Building Society to No 10 in the industry league table. The acquisition,
for an undisclosed price, is the largest so far by the

GRAHAM Kirkham is set to realise more millions from DFS, the furniture
retailer which he founded, and he will give up control as a result,
writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
He and his family intend to reduce their stake from 51.7% to 34.1%
through selling 18,000,000 shares to institutions and others which will
net about #60m.
Mr Kirkham yesterday explained that he has had numerous approaches
from investors asking if he would sell more shares and his decision will
make the market in DFS shares more liquid.
The shares eased 8p to 345p yesterday despite news of healthy trading.
Profits rose 23% to #26.2m in the year to July on sales 8% higher at
#145m.
There were no new openings in the period and margins improved from
16.2% to 16.9% on the back of improved efficiency.
The year ended with cash balances of #29.2m, up #2.4m, and DFS is
paying a final dividend of 5.65p, which makes a total of 8.3p, a rise of
15%, broadly in line with the earnings per share advance.
Mr Kirham said the new year has begun with a record order book and the
largest store opening programme yet.
He believes the chain could ultimately reach 100 stores across the
country, from 30 now. DFS has 8% of the market and around 15-20 new
outlets are planned over the next three years.

<TEXT>
TOP executives of Barings Bank may be charged with criminal offences
and their extradition to Singapore sought, the director of Singapore's
Commercial Affairs Division said yesterday.
And Nick Leeson could do a deal with Singapore prosecutors to turn
state witness.
Any Barings executive who is found to have committed offences in
Singapore could now be sought for trial, CAD director Lawrence Ang said.
At a press conference yesterday he did not name names and said he
could not go into details of the charges except that they would be under
the Companies Act and Penal Code. ''But if it can be established acts of
conspiracy took place in Singapore we may be able to extradite more
people from the United Kingdom.''
He referred throughout the press conference to ''other people at
Barings''. But it was quite clear from the questioning that Singapore's
financial inquisitors are now turning their guns on Nick Leeson's
bosses.
He said investigators had gone to London to talk to staff at Barings'
headquarters but ''Barings set unacceptable conditions for the
interviews''.
He went on: ''They wanted guarantees that no criminal charges would be
laid against them. They wanted all questions to be submitted in
writing.''
''Our investigations into Barings now include other possible criminal
acts. In due course in consultation with the Attorney General we will
decide if grounds exist to arrest anyone else.''
Asked if Mr Leeson could now do a deal with the Singaporean
authorities, he replied: ''If he wishes to co-operate. If the terms and
conditions are acceptable to both parties, why not.''
The press conference was being widely interpreted as an open
invitation to Mr Leeson to go to Singapore and get his case over with on
the best possible terms. At the moment he faces a maximum of 14 years in
prison on three groups of charges: forgery, price adjustment (cheating)
and deceiving SIMEX, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange.
Other charges could, however, still be laid against him on the
termination of sentence if convicted, or on his acquittal.

I PREDICT the islanders of Skye stand a strong chance of success in
challenging the legality of toll charges by refusing to pay on crossing
the Skye Bridge.
Professor Thomson states that it is probably a criminal offence. Is it
or is it not? He is also quoting as saying that it will be dealt with in
the same way as non-payment of the poll tax.
Non-payment of the poll tax was the most striking example of people
power in modern times which on its own brought about the demise of the
poll tax.
Similarly if the Skye population refuse to pay in significant numbers
and is prepared to take it all the way with non-payment of tolls, fines,
etc, we could be reading of a reduction or even abandonment of toll
altogether.
The thought of the bridge manager, Mr Thompson, having to report
dozens of non-payers to the police and islanders leaving names and
addresses instead of paying could bring chaos in collection and shake to
their foundations the whole feasibility of tolls on bridges.

THE irony of this Government's position regarding rural regeneration
is almost beyond belief. On the one hand it argues the case for
recognition of the Highlands' and Islands' social and economic
fragility, thereby securing Objective One status and therefore specific
European funding.
At the same time it willingly imposes the unjust burden of the highest
bridge tolls in the whole of Europe.
The undemocratic process by which this new bridge has been foisted
upon the area is now a matter for the record and simply illustrates a
Government in pursuit of a political ideology, devoid of any genuine
concern for the well-being of our citizens.
It is also indicative of the real dangers inherent in the
fragmentation of planning such key areas of our infrastructure.
If we are serious in our desire genuinely to seek to achieve rural
regeneration in a manner successfully attained by our Scandinavian
neighbours then we must ensure that all such developments are funded
through the public purse and with equity throughout the country.
The principle of tolls has been with us for a very long time and may
well be a suitable system for recouping the capital costs of such
schemes.
The people of Skye, Lochalsh, and beyond do not, I believe, have a
problem with this in principle but do justifiably feel angry at the
prospect of being held to ransom by what amounts to a
Government-sponsored monopoly whose aim is not simply to recoup capital
costs but to generate huge profits for the private investors involved at
the expense of an area which, by the Government's own criteria, is
already economically disadvantaged.
This was a fact, which both Iain Noble (chairman of the Skye Bridge
Company) and Norman Lamont, in seeking to justify the current situation,
failed to take into account.
It would appear that unless we are intent upon punishing those
citizens who live outwith the main population centres then it is of
paramount importance to establish nationwide parity in relation to all
toll-bridge tariffs.
This can only be achieved through a process of cross-subsidising all
bridges in Scotland which currently or in the future may attract tolls.
This process is already well-known in the islands with regard to ferry
charges, indeed the Kyle-Kyleakin crossing having been the most
profitable route and therefore in part subsidising less-used services.
It would appear iniquitous that the people of Skye and Lochalsh who
for many years have suffered under excessive ferry charges are now to be
dealt yet another blow with the immoral and politically corrupt
imposition of yet another 30 years (without limit) of paying into the
coffers of international investors.
The people of Scotland in other instances as we know have accepted
bridge tolls without question. It is, however, highly unlikely that the
users of the Forth, Erskine and Tay bridges would tolerate for one
moment charges in excess of #5 per crossing, and they would of course be
right.
The users of the Skye Bridge should enjoy the same rights as all other
bridge users throughout the country. The Skye Bridge is but the thin end
of the Tory wedge into other areas of privatisation and as such is of
national significance.
I for one applaud the efforts of those who choose to pursue all
available avenues in seeking redress for this iniquitous situation and
hope that a future Scottish parliament will legislate specifically to
end this desperate exploitation and to plan for and manage all future
schemes with sensitivity and with equity in the interest of all our
citizens.

THERE appears to be much bad feeling in Skye over the new road bridge
but there are many flawed arguments being put forward against the
bridge's operators.
One argument is that the islanders have no choice and that there is no
competition vis-a-vis routes from Skye to the mainland.
They have no less choice than there was previously, and if the
islanders do not wish to utilise the road or if they do not like having
to pay for travel to and from the mainland every day, they can simply
move to the mainland.
The main objection is to the paying of a toll following years of
paying for ferry travel. The road bridge has been privately funded and
it is perverse to expect a company not to try to recoup the cost of the
road. It was not built free, the materials were not free and the men and
machinery had to be funded.
Furthermore, the ferry payments to Caledonian MacBrayne are irrelevant
to the road charges. CalMac received fares for a service provided but
the road is being run by a different organisation unrelated to CalMac or
its fares.
Some say they will not pay the tolls. This is irresponsible. Not only
will it be cutting off their noses to spite their faces, but they will
be cutting off a lot of other people's noses, too, as private enterprise
will be once bitten, twice shy, and will be less than enthusiastic to
support much-needed similar ventures, or dissimilar ventures, in future.
Those who travel to and from Skye should surely be rejoicing that they
have a substantial link to the mainland of Scotland for the first time
since the Ice Age and that it will be open all day and in much worse
weather than even Caledonian MacBrayne's ferry service can overcome.
Surely Skye can only gain.

THE September retail sales figures undoubtedly came as a
disappointment and certainly took the market by surprise. Economic
forecasting is as difficult as any other kind and on this occasion, if
the official explanation is any guide, it is consumer resistance to
higher prices, especially food, that has undermined expectations. That
is probably good for inflation as were the August figures for average
earnings showing no change on the month.
On the other hand, the inflation figures for September last week were
slightly worse than expected and they could have been the main factor
that had an impact on sales.
The jobless figures will be welcomed by the Government as an
indication that the labour market, after briefly stagnating during the
summer months, is now seeing a pick-up in the decline in unemployment.
This suggests that growth is holding up reasonably well despite the
disappointing retail numbers.
All the data so far this month adds up to interest rates staying on
hold until a clear cut pattern emerges.
At the moment the signals are mixed. Undoubtedly there has been a
slowdown in economic growth but whether this is merely a pause, as the
authorities and many economists believe or something more serious as
others fear, is not yet obvious. Third-quarter GDP is due on Monday and
this will be a key factor in the Chancellor's strategy.
Crunch near
THERE is something going on at Trafalgar House. The shares of the
engineering oriented conglomerate reaching a low point of 18p in
inter-day trading yesterday before bouncing back to close 2[1/2]p down
at 21p. That puts a market capitalisation on the stock, including all
Convertible Preference shares, of just over #400m for a company with
annual turnover well above #3000m.
The feeling is that the crunch is nigh with the shares firing all
kinds of distress signals at present.
And distress is certainly being felt among shareholders.
Some may have held 100 shares 10 years ago worth #355. If they had
participated in all the five rights issues, which would have cost in all
#305, today they would be looking at an investment worth just #140 or a
79% decline.
There is a more piquant discomfort in the House of Keswick whose Hong
Kong Land associate has an effective 29.7% stake since 1992 and has
injected both management and the family's business reputation.
At that time, the end of the Broackes and Parker era was hailed with
some relief by a jaundiced City but black holes kept appearing and the
ultimately fruitless attempt to find salvation through the acquisition
of Northern Electricity further damaged credibility.
An unprecedented wall of silence surrounds Trafalgar although there
are strong suggestions that Simon Keswick may buy out the outside
interests -- it would not be that a significant sum to the Jardine
Mathieson group.
One calculation is that tangible net assets are worth 41p per share
unless here has been a deterioration of substance in the balance sheet
since the half time figures. That is before allowing for the very
substantial tax losses available and the ability of another UK profit
earner to claw back #220m of currently written off Advance Corporation
Tax. The QE2 could still be worth #100m, likewise the Ideal Homes land
bank, although how one values John Brown and Davy is somewhat more
arcane.
Trafalgar, in some respects, is in the same position as other
conglomerates found themselves in such as Lonrho, BET, and Cookson.
Their distressed share price proved a wonderful buying opportunity at
the time. This is a very high-risk situation but where the goodwill
attaching to the reputations and technical skills of the engineering
operations should guarantee an eventual return.
Paying off
BODY Shop's drive to increase sales appears to be paying off as
volumes have picked up since August but they are still seeing a
year-on-year decline in the US.
UK corporate history is littered with British retailers' failed
attempts to break into the US market. It looks so inviting -- a huge
single market serving a well-heeled populace and with low entry costs.
However, as Laura Ashley, Sock Shop and even Dixons have found out, the
reality is different.
It is very difficult to find a niche in such a well-covered market and
competition is unrelenting and unforgiving. If a retailer does happen
upon a new idea, copy-cat formats soon spring up and expand rapidly as
opening costs are low.
The fear is that Body Shop will also come a cropper. It has spawned a
number of imitators, including Bath &amp; Body Works, which is part of one
of America's most successful retailing groups. It has installed a new
chief executive in the US operation with a brief to give the stores more
focus and is cutting the cost base, while continuing to extend the
chain.
Body Shop's ethical stance does single it out and is a definite
marketing plus, so long as the group continues to refute successfully
attacks on its sincerity. As might be expected, sales are going well in
the Asian region, where more and more stores are opening. But underlying
sales growth in Europe and Central and South America looks rather
disappointing and it is dropping in Australia.
Whether Body Shop will make it as a true global retailer remains to be
seen but maintaining product differentiation is going to be a tough
task. Certainly the stock market is not going to give it the benefit of
the doubt.

I AM grateful to The Herald for the verbatim report of the Prime
Minister's speech at the end of the Blackpool conference.
One sentence about small businesses must have produced many a hollow
laugh: ''We've set up the biggest consultation with business ever seen
in this country -- to find out what more we can credibly do to help
them.''
In the heady financial days of 1988 I started a small retail shop
paying an affordable sum to the local authority. On the introduction of
the business rate, the levels of payment and their increments had been
fixed by central government.
By the time I was forced to close, four-and-a-half years later, I was
paying over eight times the original sum. Businesses failed at an
unprecedented rate but, strangely, there was no consultation then,
despite cries of protestation from those affected.
Even now, the party in government still relies on an undeserved
loyalty from the entrepreneurial section of the population which seems
unable to detect radical changes in the tone of the Tory Party.
Can anyone remember when the Conservatives actually conserved
anything?

MURRAY Ritchie pointed out how the German nation jealously guarded its
car industry, the right to build cars, and compete with others (October
9).
Why did the Scottish nation and indeed workers fail to guard their
rights to work in a number of precious industries such as mining,
shipbuilding and steel manufacture?
The seeds of this rape have been sown and are now starting to bear a
poison crop -- youngsters with nowhere to learn potential skills and
instead heading for cheap thrills with drugs, drink, and petty crime.
Pre-1979 and Thatcher's vindictive stranglehold on this part of the
world at least there was some hope with apprenticeships in real trades.
We should be ashamed to have stood back and have this taken from us.
I have travelled a little and encountered foreigners who look at you
in amazement that ''Scotland the Brave'' has managed to put up with it
all.
I sense it is too late but I would hope people would get their heads
together to try to repair the damage done before I and probably a few
others take the easy way out and emigrate.
No, I haven't even seen Braveheart.

I RECENTLY returned to my hometown to attend the funeral of a friend's
father. I found myself talking to four children of family friends. All
were mid-to-late twenties; all were university graduates with good
degrees. All were employed at something -- although two had jobs
unrelated to what they had trained for.
What was particularly disturbing was that all were in temporary
employment, which effectively disbars them from obtaining mortgages,
being unable to sustain payment to life insurances, health insurances,
and personal pensions, etc. Only one was in this situation from personal
choice.
It is surely counter-productive for the most able/energetic elements
of the country's workforce to have three or six-month contracts
renewable on performance, with all the stress implications that can lead
to.
Surely the expectations of a stable society can only be diminished by
this basis for employment?
The word dilettante could take on a whole new meaning. There now seems
to be a fund of knowledge which is being wasted as people spend their
time on the fringes of areas of stable employment making great efforts
to become accepted.
Is this what middle-class achievers can now expect as the norm?
Are these young Scots typical of a betrayed generation?

A NEW Scottish company is branching out and crossing the sea to
Northern Ireland in an #11.2m takeover of the province's biggest weekly
newspaper group, Morton Newspapers.
Earlier this year Scottish Radio Holdings -- which owns Radio Clyde
and Radio Forth -- created the new company, Score Press, with a view to
moving into the local newspaper market.
Last night James Gordon, chief executive of SRH, denied the
acquisition was a ''back door'' way into local radio in Ireland. But he
admitted the company ''would continue to seek further opportunities for
growth in the highly successful commercial radio market''.
Morton Newspapers' pre-tax profits for the year to end-March were
#540,000, down from #933,000 the previous year. Net assets stood at
#1.33m. The company publishes 26 titles, six of them freesheets.
The takeover involves #6.7m in cash with the balance met by the
allocation of 1,514,162 new Ordinary shares in SRH.
SRH intends to carry out restructuring plans already under
consideration by the management of Morton Newspapers and envisages a
modest amount of further reorganisation.
Score Press is 90% owned by SRH and 10% by Charles Villiers, its
32-year-old chief executive, who already has a wide experience of the
local and regional newspaper industry.
Mr Gordon said: ''This is an exciting first step in our carefully
planned diversification into local weekly newspapers. We will, of
course, continue to seek further opportunities for growth in the highly
successful commercial radio market.''
He added: ''The financial success of SRH has been built on the firm
foundation of the strong local appeal of the programming of individual
stations within the group.
''That same attention to local interests is a key factor which has
helped Morton Newspapers to achieve the large and loyal readership which
it has been able to build up. It, therefore, fits perfectly with our
planned expansion into this field.''
John Morton, chairman of Morton Newspapers, said: ''Following recent
expansion, the company felt that its future interests were best served
by joining a public company with resources to finance future growth.
''Our recent major investment in new plant and premises meant that we
had taken Morton Newspapers as far as it could go in private hands. By
happy coincidence Scottish Radio was looking for an expansion
opportunity in the local newspaper publishing field.''

ROWARDENNAN Estate including Ben Lomond was acquired by the National
Land Fund as part of a National Memorial to the Second World War, but
Gordon Cowie, of Forest Enterprise, argued (Ocober 9) that on acquiring
the estate from the fund in 1950 the Forestry Commission was subject to
no particular obligations arising from the function of the fund because
it had repaid the purchase price and the Government had imposed no
restrictions. This is disputed.
As in all other cases where the fund passed land to Government
departments the Treasury required a repayment to avoid double funding
and despite the absence of written restrictions there was no doubt about
the Government's conservation objectives.
On the first acquisition the Government announced the purchase to be
''to preserve the natural beauty, safeguard public access and use for
agriculture and forestry''. Note the priorities.
The Government had already offered the estate as a gift to the
National Trust for Scotland which wished to accept despite financial
problems.
Additionally, the fund operated throughout its life to the objectives
outlined by Hugh Dalton in his 1946 Budget speech.
''There is still wonderful beauty to be found in Britain. The best
that remains should surely become the heritage, not of a few private
owners, but of all our people. We shall dedicate some of the loveliest
parts of this land to the memory of those who died in order that we
might live in freedom. Let this land of ours be dedicated to the memory
of our dead and to the use and enjoyment of the living for ever . . . ''
Of the properties it acquired 80% went to the National Trusts and 7%
to the Youth Hostels Associations.
Mr Cowie says that the commission followed the principles of the fund,
but is this so? On acquisition the Forestry Commission insensitively
planted up the open hillsides with the blanket conifer plantations we
know today on Sallochy, Coille Mhor, and Ptarmigan.
It also started to convert to conifer plantations, by felling and
underplanting the lochside oakwoods, one of Loch Lomond's main glories
and the largest such habitat in Scotland.
The process is described in the commission's own 1969 book. About 60%
had been ''underplanted'' by 1969 when the process was halted and
replaced by the admirable current conservation policy.
Tom Weir was right to complain that great opportunities for the
conservation of Scotland's natural heritage have been missed, and we all
have lost out.
In this fiftieth aniversary year of the end of the Second World War it
would be sensible and just for the Government to secure at long last the
desperately needed effective management of this beautiful area and
equally appropriate for Forest Enterprise to demonstrate its undoubted
skills and concern by replacing the alien conifer plantations by native
woodlands into the new Millennium.

THE decision to build the M74 extension must rank as one of the most
ignorant and selfish planning decisions ever made in Glasgow.
This road will dominate and desecrate the South Side of the city. It
will be five miles long and as it approaches the Kingston Bridge it will
be on supports and there will be a great flailing of new roads in its
wake.
This thing is massive. None of the planned bits of grass or statues
are going to shield anything.
And for what? All the evidence now shows that these roads increase car
use. The Conservative Government is even reversing its car-centred
approach.
Most car journeys are only a few miles. It would take so little to
build light, comfortable, and efficient transport systems and dedicated
cycle routes.
Part of the route could instead be used to provide what is really
needed, a totally car-free village within the city. We could beat
Edinburgh on this one.
I am surprised and sad at the very limited debate that has taken place
in the run-up to this decision. I feel very let down by the apparent
disinterest of various health bodies that I would have expected to enter
this debate.

SINCE 1968, Shelter has highlighted the serious problems in Scottish
housing: both homelessness and appalling conditions. Our message has
consistently struck a chord, reflected in widespread media coverage.
Record levels of homelessness are rightly reported in the front half --
the news pages -- of newspapers. What is curious is that other vital
components of housing policy, such as interest-rate fluctuations and the
fortunes of construction companies, are often reported in back pages --
the business section.
This way of segmenting news accurately mirrors the way public policy
treats housing. In the national policy agenda, homelessness and housing
poverty are disconnected from the economic context and are thrown into
the pool of social policy issues, there to compete for resources with
education, health, and welfare benefits. Other pillars of public policy,
such as state education and the National Health Service, still
manifestly benefit the majority of Scots, while public housing policy is
seen as the lot of the less fortunate minority. The result is that
housing investment has been uniquely singled out for the most savage
cuts.
The social consequences of the retreat from investment are disturbing
enough. In the mid-1990s 43,000 homeless applications are made annually
to Scottish housing authorities; equal to the population of a town the
size of Paisley; one in 11 Scottish household now languishes for an
indeterminate period on a public sector house waiting list. But it is
clear that the flight from investment will have profound economic
consequences as well. This should be of equal concern to readers of both
halves of newspapers.
Next week in Glasgow, Shelter and the construction company Miller
Partnerships are hosting a major conference which aims to restore
Scottish housing to the heart of the Scottish economy. Builders,
lenders, and consultants will join politicians, campaigners, and
public-sector managers to examine the role of housing in securing
economic prosperity. Their task is to turn facts into a serious
political agenda.
Housing, after all, is already the major feature of our urban
landscape; housing investment accounts for more than 40% of all
investment in Scotland; housing-related decisions account for up to half
of total energy use in Scotland and influences much of the demand for
goods like carpets and fridges and services such as building trades. A
housing system which does not work well can have a substantial
distorting effect on the wider economy. This is still evident in the
southern third of England.
The future throws up still greater challenges. The rush towards
greater economic flexibility in Scotland sits ill with the central plank
of Government housing policy, the cranking up of owner-occupation
levels. The increase in self-employment and part-time working, alongside
higher levels of wage poverty in work and sustained long-term
unemployment sit ill with the demands of a 25-year mortgage. At the same
time, a social context of a 74,000 increase in the number of households
-- mostly single people, many of them elderly -- in the next five years
offers few reassurances that housing eggs can continue to be placed in
the home-ownership basket.
A reappraisal of the merits of a robust rented sector, both public and
private, is required. Based on current estimates of household formation
in Scotland, Shelter estimates that about 13,000 affordable rented homes
need to be provided in each of the next five years. Current levels of
output are about 6000 a year.
In addition, there is a desperate need to tackle the worst problems of
dampness and disrepair lest these problems create even greater
investment requirements in the future. Taken together, these priorities
would require an additional #580m per year in housing investment. This
might be compared with the #1200m which has been lost to the Scottish
housing budget since 1990 and the #250m which the Treasury will siphon
off from Scotland by reducing the rate at which mortgage tax relief is
applied from 25% to 15%.
There are a number of reasons why increased housing investment is
justified in economically rational terms. Not least of these is the
direct and indirect jobs impact of the increased activity. In gross
terms, the level of investment we propose could sustain up to 33,000
jobs. The savings to the benefits bill and the new tax yield could see
up to half of the capital cost of the programme recouped. The stability
gains of a planned programme in a notoriously volatile industry would
offer a benign environment for better training and higher job quality.
Other benefits are less easy to quantify but no less significant.
Investing in affordable rented accommodation eases the poverty trap
experienced when households face high housing costs and the loss of
benefit which results if they find relatively low-paid work. These traps
are a barrier to economic efficiency. The rigidity of a housing policy
which treats renting as a poor relation threatens the greater labour
market flexibility which we see on the horizon.
If households remain tied into the mortgage millstone or high-rent
accommodation the flexibility to move in search of opportunity, to take
career breaks or to undergo retraining will appear as false promises.
Who can tell what the cost might be to Scotland's international
competitiveness?
Most difficult of all to quantify -- and, remarkably, ignored in the
national accounts -- are the positive effects that housing can have on
communities, health, and education. Housing regeneration can have a huge
impact on the confidence of a community and increase residents' skills.
Housing repair and improvement is required to rid over one-quarter of
our homes of damp-related problems which are costing the NHS tens of
million of pounds each year.
Good housing must implicitly be part of policy on education. Research
by Shelter in England has shown that housing insecurity is a major
factor limiting the performance of individual children and of entire
schools.
A couple of weeks ago Shelter received a letter from the new Housing
Minister, Raymond Robertson, advising us that new housing investment
would have to wait its turn in a queue of priorities including other
areas such as health. This is a crude way to manage the public purse.
Housing cannot simply be treated as another slice of the finite
public-sector financial cake. It lies at the heart of economic and
social prosperity. Failure to get housing right undermines the very
efficiency after which public sector spending strives.

THE economy continues to send conflicting signals to its Treasury
managers and their advisers. The latest employment figures, for example,
show strong growth in job opportunities (not only directly but also in
the rise in recorded vacancies) and would easily be compatible with the
sort of growth which would keep interest rates at their present level as
a brake on possible inflationary trends. Yet the earnings figures
contradict any notion of a quick inflationary return: they remain
remarkably stable, and usefully modest. And the spending evidence from
retailers shows that, in spite of the additional cash that ought to be
available as more people come back into work, all the pressure on prices
remains downwards. Attempts by retailers to rebuild their profit margins
are not succeeding yet. One certain beneficiary of the trend is public
spending, where borrowing, though still overshooting Government
estimates, may be beginning to fall somewhat as spending on unemployment
and related benefits contracts.
Public confidence remains absent, and as long as that is the case
spending will remain muted. No doubt it could turn very easily -- by its
very nature group confidence is elusive. Meanwhile the Government is
under great pressure to inject stimuli into various markets. The most
notable is the housing market, which is still stagnant. Poor car sales
in August have led motor manufacturers to call fiscal changes to boost
their sales; they might themselves reduce their profit margins which
seem to be higher here than elsewhere in the EU. Certainly the general
retail experience is that lower prices do evoke higher spending, but
without these, consumers are preferring to leave their cash in the bank.
Sooner or later all this will change, but worries about a sudden
inflationary surge may be wide of the mark. It is quite possible that we
are really fixed in a deflationary situation which needs a more positive
response than either the Bank of England or the Treasury is able to
contemplate. If that is the case, its acceptance should strengthen the
Chancellor's resolve to reduce interest rates as soon as possible,
though he can never know if his doing so will coincide with the return
of spending confidence (as it has so often done in similar stages of the
economic cycle in the past).
One other factor needs to be borne in mind. It is possible that
employment data are losing their precision as short-term economic
indicators, as the nature of the employment offered changes to far more
short and part-time working than was the case even a decade ago. The
latest figures may also be distorted by the way in which the summer
figures are often boosted by student employment which drops away
abruptly once term starts (as it did this month). But there is no
gainsaying now the steady trend towards lower unemployment in the
British economy. Even if there remain worries about the quality of the
work on offer, and the way in which the statistics were ''refined''
earlier to produce outcomes favourable to the Government, the fact is
that nothing in these respects has changed in over a year. In the past
the improvements might have led to a political reward for the
Government; but just as the swing to much higher unemployment in the
1980s produced little effect on the Government's popularity, swings in
the other direction now evoke a comparable lack of enthusiasm.
Employment may have ceased to be a significant direct political factor,
yet uncertainty concerning it may lie at the heart of popular refusal to
spend.

SEMINARS
SUCH is the demand from Scottish business women for a quartet of
Glasgow seminars, starting next Monday and collectively called Key to
the Boardroom, that the organisers have had to switch to a bigger venue.
A recent report highlighted the shortage of women in business,
especially in the emerging role of non-executive director. Now the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and KPMG have joined
forces to address this shortfall.
With more than 200 participants attracted to the four seminars, Anne
Bryce, ICAS head of Insolvency, said: ''It is the first event of its
kind to be staged and will give those attending the opportunity to
discover new ways to make progress in their career.'' They will also rub
shoulders with women who have already ''made it'' in business.
The RAC Club will now host the seminars instead of KPMG's offices. The
series begins with Progress to the Board on October 23, followed by
Financial Issues on November 6, Legal Implications on November 20 and
Boardroom Strategy on December 4.
Mary Campbell, a director of Noble &amp; Co, will conduct the financial
seminar. She said: ''It will be relevant for people who do not have a
financial background, and the accent will be very much on question and
answer to build up knowledge. It should be both challenging and a great
deal of fun.''
Recent statistics show that 97.3% of directors are men, while at
non-executive level the proportion is 96.3%.
* IF you are a woman trying to make your way in the business world and
want to learn from those who are already well established in their
chosen field, it would be worth attending the Wednesday, October 25
meeting of the Business Women's Forum in Glasgow.
The venue is Queen's Cross Church at the junction of the city's
Garscube and Maryhill roads.
Speakers will include Roberta Buchan of bridal dress fame, journalist
Bev Brown, auctioneer Anita Manning who was a panel member in this
year's Scottish Television Business Game, consultant Marilyn Orcharton
who has appeared on TV's Question Time, and Patricia Douglas of the
Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.
Chairing the evening, which starts at 6.30pm, will be Kaye Adams,
presenter of Scottish Women. To book a place call 0141 950 2020.

STOREFITTERS Havelock Europa is broadening its horizons and looking to
expand abroad and boost foreign contracts from its current 3% of total
sales to 15%.
To help it capture more of the overseas market Havelock recently
opened up a new office in Paris.
The Fife-based company's results for the first six months of this year
already show it heading for a healthy full-year profits.
The figures released yesterday show turnover up by 44.9% to
#22,790,000 from #15,733,000 for the same period last year.
Pre-tax profit leapt by 31.7% from #1,555,000 last year to #2,048,000
this year and the dividend up 20% from 1p to 1.2p.
Chairman Norman Lessels said: ''Havelock Europa has the necessary
skills, energy and resources to exploit both its leading position in the
UK and the attractive opportunities presented overseas in the field of
store equipment supply and other commercial interiors.
''The directors continue to view the future with confidence.''
Orders for the nine months to the end of September were up 36% on the
same period last year.
The firm is banking on continuing its lucrative business with the Bank
of Scotland.
Already Havelock Europa has completed the refurbishment of 16 branches
and will complete work on another 43 before the end of the year and
recently secured a contract for work on another 127 Bank of Scotland
branches.
The company has also teamed up, as a marketing partner with the John
Ryan Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is hopeful of developing
substanial business with banks overseas.
Recent new customers include Dixons and What Everyone Wants.
Other customers include Marks and Spencer, Boots the Chemists and
House of Fraser, where Havelock Europa is playing a major part in
refurbishment.
The company is also involved in food retailers which include Tesco,
Safeway and Asda.
Until now food retailers have been a relatively modest area for the
company but it now regards that area as one of substantial growth.
Following yesterday's results, Grant Milne, an investment manager with
Stockbrokers and Fund Managers, Tilney and Co, said: ''These results
today confirm a good performance from the company and it is reassuring
to see them coming out and showing they are confident for the future.''

After 10 years the
man many regard
as the godfather
of the alternative
comedy boom is
returning to
live stand-up.
Mark Fisher
explains why
YOU don't expect to find Alexei Sayle in a place like the Russell
Hotel. This upmarket joint in Central London isn't one that aspires to
the gentrified living of an earlier century in the bland way most hotels
do -- it doesn't have to, it's the genuine article.
But if Sayle, the ex-communist, crop-headed, tight-suited
comedian-with-an-attitude is not the first person you'd imagine sinking
into the impossibly deep leather armchairs in the lounge bar, lack of
imagination is your problem not his. ''I quite like it,'' he says
innocently and without embarrassment.
Something else you don't expect is that a place like the Russell Hotel
would have a grill and pizza bar called the Virginia Woolf Restaurant
(Virginia Woolf wouldn't have expected it at any rate).
''I've got a couple of her recipes myself,'' quips Sayle when I point
it out. And he lights up a cigar, which you also wouldn't expect. Then
you notice his head, and what you don't expect is that the man whose
coif is to comedy what Kojak's was to cop shows actually has more hair
than he does on the telly. Not long exactly, but longer than his
trademark borstal crop.
But the thing that few people expected of Sayle, the man who in his
Comedy Store days inspired a generation of comedians from Arnold Brown
to Arthur Smith, was that he would return to live stand-up. Sayle was
the legendary London comedy club's compere throughout its first year (it
opened in May 1979) and was there at the start of the careers of Elton,
Mayall, Edmonson, French and Saunders -- a generation that dared to
suggest to a desensitised world that perhaps the best laughs were not to
be found in gags about your mother-in-law, your chest measurements and
your Asian neighbours.
Sayle himself was billed as an intellectual yob, his ferocious Scouse
invective bulldozing the way clear for jokes about Albanian politics,
Bertolt Brecht and what was on in Stoke Newington.
National tours, hit singles, journalism, three series of his own TV
show, countless film and sitcom appearances, and writing radio adverts
followed, but fast-forward to 1995 and it's been a whole decade since he
last performed live in this country. For those who regard him as the
godfather of the alternative comedy boom, even if that alternative has
quietly sneaked into the mainstream, those 10 years have been a long
wait.
''If you're a good comic I think you should get out there,'' he says,
pointing out that he did slip in a tour of Australia in 1991. ''I always
thought I'd go back to it at some point.''
These days Sayle holds a rather odd place in the public consciousness.
He's the reliable personality sensible enough to present a series on
road safety, concerned enough to front a documentary about world food
production, balanced enough to endorse the Sports Council's Sport for
All campaign. But he's also the furious ranter, the opinionated
outsider, a man in an ill-fitting suit railing at the world's
injustices. When the publicity stills arrived from his PR agency my
two-year-old daughter opened the envelope and promptly kissed his
photograph.
At least it wasn't the one of his alter-ego, the sad warm-up man Bobby
Chariot, but it was not the reaction you'd expect. And it kind of
reinforced my theory that Sayle now inhabits a weird netherworld between
the inanity of light entertainment (witness the opening sequence of The
All New Alexei Sayle Show with the refrain ''Life's a big banana
sandwich'') and the subversiveness of agitational comedy.
''I don't know if I consciously play with those images,'' he says.
''But once you're on television you have to adapt to the medium.
Shouting at people for half an hour simply doesn't work on the TV.
That's why there's a more rounded performance. I don't know if it's
cuddly, it seems to me to be fairly uncompromising, but it's obviously
less spiky than it would be in a club.''
Anticipating that his forthcoming live dates (the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre last night and Glasgow Pavilion next Tuesday) will show a more
frantic side to the small-screen Alexei, he'll none the less be taking
the opportunity to relive some of his favourite TV moments alongside a
batch of new material. And with the introduction of the luckless Bobby
Chariot on to the stage, with his protruding teeth, curly perm and satin
jackets, it's the first time Sayle will have blended character comedy
with his patent stand-up diatribes.
''He's the first character that I've kept going over two or three
series and he seems dead popular,'' he says. ''I don't extemporise that
much as a stand-up -- I make up stuff but not a huge amount -- but I'm
hoping more will come with Bobby because he's got a life of his own.''
Kept endlessly busy by a diverse mix of television engagements, Sayle
has been careful to put together his personal work in the way he wants.
This year he's travelled from Northern Syria to the Red Sea for Great
Railway Journeys Of The World and turned in a cameo appearance from
Cannes in One For The Road with Alan Davies, but when it comes to his
own series or his recently completed 50-minute romantic drama, Sorry
About Last Night, in which he stars opposite Siobhan Redmond, he makes
sure that he is in control.
''My series and the film have all been made with my own crew that I
work with all the time,'' he says. ''In future I only want to work with
those people. I know we're on the same wavelength.''
He hasn't gone to the extent of setting up his own production company,
but within the walls of the BBC he's found himself a pretty secure
footing. Yes, he has to admit that he's now part of the comedy
establishment, especially as the floor-managers, researchers, and junior
directors he remembers from his early days are now, like Alan Yentob,
heading up whole departments if not channels of their own. He's always
been polite to the right people, he says, otherwise he'd never have got
on.
So can comedy, once the revolutionary hope of the post-punk
generation, ever be subversive? ''Only within showbusiness,'' he says.
''One form of comedy can replace another, but it doesn't mean anything
to the outside world. If I have political material in my act it's there
because it's what I want to write about. When Picasso painted Guernica
it was something he felt passionate about, I don't think he was trying
to stop the bombing of civilians. You talk about stuff you feel deeply
about, but you're not trying to have an actual effect on that thing.
Obviously, in a more diffuse sense, you're hoping to have some effect,
but you certainly can't go into comedy in a proselytising frame of
mind.''
He does, though, want to deal with ''big stuff'' on his tour, as much
as anything because politics have gone out of fashion with the younger
generation of comedians. ''It's all that observational shit, which I
hate,'' he says. ''Hey, have you noticed when you leave the toilet lid
up . . .''
''Generally the work I do is not about tackling things head on,'' he
says. ''I like to deal with peripheral things. I would never do a Hugh
Grant joke -- I hate that kind of thing. I'm interested in things that
are round the back.''
And for as long as he keeps peering round the back, Alexei Sayle will
remain gloriously not what you expect.

THE Home Secretary, Michael Howard, had an exceptionally good Tory
conference last week -- at least as measured by popular response. But
professional opinion was, where not outrightly opposed to his latest
proposals, deeply sceptical as to their worth. Neither critics nor
supporters could have been prepared for the storm which has blown up
about him and is threatening his political survival. The resignation of
Mr Derek Lewis, in effect a sacking, has not gone smoothly (possibly
because Mr Lewis was not a civil servant but an outside recruit to the
Prison Service). Not only is Mr Lewis not going quietly, his complaint
that Mr Howard intervened directly in the day-to-day management of the
service focuses attention on the Home Secretary's role in the events
which led to the sacking. Mr Lewis is effectively supported by one of
the non-executive directors of the Prison Board, who has resigned in
protest at his treatment (another has said she is also considering
resignation). The matter has assumed legal status because Mr Lewis is
going to law to justify himself and to claim compensation. That will be
a lengthy process (though most such cases are settled out of court). The
political process will be settled more quickly, probably in the House of
Commons today.
Politics and the law are closely related but the priorities are
different -- the law moves slowly and is concerned with justice,
political movement is almost immediate and may almost ignore justice.
There will be enormous pressure on Mr Howard to resign today -- and in
different circumstances he might have done so. It does look as if his
hands-on management in the Prison Service has exposed him to far more
direct responsibility for recent events than might have been thought the
case earlier. Yet it seems impossible for the Government to contemplate
the disaster his resignation would entail, for itself as much as for him
personally. Mr Major has already lent his backing to Mr Howard, and
though that did not prove to be much of a guarantee in other ministerial
cases (Mr Mellor's and Mr Lamont's, for example) it should be honoured
this time. Anything else would have dire consequences for the Tory
party: it is Mr Howard's good luck that his personal standing is firmly
tied to the party's own chances of even partial electoral recovery.
Timing is everything in politics, and it favours Mr Howard's survival
just at the point when the conference gave the Tories a successful
relaunch after the events of the summer and Mr Major's own re-election
over Mr Redwood. There is the fact too that Mr Howard is an extremely
competent debater who is genuinely convinced of his lack of culpability
in the present affair. His conduct today will be vital to his success
but few would doubt that it will be less than technically competent.
Only were he to perform particularly ineptly would there be much doubt.
Yet whatever the immediate outcome, the affair does damage the
Government again. It confirms its tendency to be accident prone, and to
be unable to initiate events rather than react to them. It exposes it on
a chosen favourite issue, law and order, but in a context where the best
that can be hoped for is a draw, and the worst is an exposure of
continuing weakness in the Prison Service, which Mr Lewis found ''a
shambles'' when he took over its management, and where a series of
spectacular failures has advertised little improvement. That the Home
Secretary has become an unpopular parliamentary figure will not ease his
passage today but his salvation will owe more to the Government's
majority of five than to the merits of his case.

Edith Pargeter (Ellis Peters), author; born September 28, 1913, died
October 14, 1995
EDITH Pargeter, later to earn international fame as Ellis Peters, was
born in Shropshire in 1913. Her fascination with writing started while
she was still at school and by 1936 she had already had two books
published. By 1995 the number had risen to more than 90.
There were other strains to her life too. At the outbreak of the war
she was turned down for the Women's Auxiliary Air Force on the grounds
that her job as assistant to a chemist was a reserved occupation.
Her solution to this was to give in her notice to her employer and
then to apply to join the Women's Royal Naval Service instead. She
worked in the signals office of Western Approaches HQ for the rest of
the war and was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1945.
She developed a great affinity with the people of Czechoslovakia,
visiting the country with her brother Ellis after the end of the war in
order to attend an international summer school. She learnt the language
through a gramophone course and returned to the country as often as she
could thereafter.
She translated the works of a number of Czech writers into English,
thereby becoming for them a valuable channel of communication to the
free world. She was awarded the gold medal and ribbon of the
Czechoslovak Society for International Relations in 1968.
She adopted her penname in 1959; ''Ellis'' being the surname of her
Welsh grandmother as well as the Christian name of her brother and
''Peters'' from ''Petra'', after one of her Czech friends. Her books
alternated between historical novels and crime stories, these two
eventually coming together with the Brother Cadfael series. In 1962, she
was awarded an Edgar by the Mystery Writers of America and, in 1980, the
Silver Dagger by our own Crime Writers' Association.
In 1990, she was made a member of the Welsh Academy. In May, 1994, she
was chosen to receive the Cartier Diamond Dagger, an annual award by the
Crime Writer's Association for outstanding achievements in crime
fiction. She also received an OBE last year and was made an honorary
Master of Arts of Birmingham University.
The Brother Cadfael Chronicles came about almost by accident. In 1977,
while researching in Shrewsbury Abbey, she came across an old book in
which there was mention of a medieval monk being sent into Wales to
recover the relics of St Winifred. Immediately, the historical novelist
in her took over and the result, A Morbid Taste for Bones which she
fully intended to be a one-off, was published in 1979.
I became a convert to the Brother Cadfael books nearly three-quarters
of the way through their publication and I have been catching up ever
since, sticking religiously to their chronological order. Edith Pargeter
herself found it difficult to understand why they appealed so much to
the public, oddly perhaps because she must herself have fallen under
their spell.
It is partly the atmosphere of timelessness about them about them, a
full but unhurried existence with a total absence of change. Apart from
Cadfael, a number of characters, good and bad, run the length of the
archive, the stalwart sheriff Hugh Beringar and the all-enduring but
ever cheerful Brother Mark among the former and the prim and
disapproving Prior Robert with his odious toady, Brother Jerome, leading
the latter.
Not least there is the ever-present but invisible influence of St
Winifred herself; and all this against a backdrop of the continuing
civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud.
I was privileged to meet Ellis Peters on the occasion of her
presentation with the Diamond Dagger. I congratulated her on having made
in the villain of the Cadfael book that I had by then reached, a
character of wholly unmitigated nastiness, which I have always regarded
as being one of the hallmarks of a great suspense story. ''Oh, I do hope
not. I always try to find something good in all my characters,'' she
said.
Ellis Peters died Last Saturday and Brother Cadfael with her. But both
will live on for decades yet in the affection and gratitude of countless
readers.

Arthur Wilson, Army doctor and GP; born December 2, 1918, died October
7, 1995
DR Arthur Wilson, general practitioner, New Abbey, Dumfriesshire, for
35 years and wartime Army medical officer, died at home recently after a
short illness.
A country GP for almost half his life, Arthur Wilson was born in
Glasgow, the son of a Church of Scotland minister and a school teacher.
His early childhood was spent on Fair Isle and he then moved to live
with his grandparents in Shettleston while his parents carried out
missionary work in the West Indies. Educated at Glasgow High School and
Glasgow University, he graduated in 1942.
Soon after, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. Posted to Naples,
he joined the invading Allies as they forged their way from Sicily
northwards. It was during this period that he developed his interest in
venereology.
Sexually transmitted disease was rife, an almost inevitable
consequence of troops set free in the back streets of Naples after
spending two years in the desert. This work allowed him to develop his
considerable counselling and diagnostic skills which were later put to
good use in general practice and as head of Dumfries Infirmary's
venereology clinic.
At the end of the war he was part of the conquering army in Austria.
Here his compassion for the vanquished came to the fore. It was at this
time that he was allocated Herman Goering's staff car and driver to
transport him about his medical business.
He recalled the time when he and a Romanian doctor were asked to
examine refugees from Romania for typhus-carrying lice. Any refugee sent
back faced certain execution. Determined this should not happen, he set
about getting the other doctor drunk on Schnapps in order to sign all
the medical certificates himself. Unknown to him, his counterpart had
the same idea.
At the end of the day it's not clear who signed the certificates, but
every refugee passed through to the West, the only two casualties being
the doctors themselves.
After four years working in a hospital in Graz, the young doctor
returned to Britain in search of a rural practice. He found what he was
looking for in New Abbey, but had a fight on his hands first. The local
health council had decided that the practice was non-viable and proposed
that it should be taken over by a neighbouring doctor. Supported by
villagers, Arthur Wilson appealed to the Secretary of State.
In 1954, his appeal upheld, he began his life as a country GP, a
talented doctor, and popular member of the community. He developed a
great knowledge of local history and was a keen hill-walker and sailor.
He leaves a widow, Marion, four children, and seven grandchildren.

Helen Vlachos, Greek newspaper publisher and columnist; born December
18, 1911, died October 14, 1995
HELEN Vlachos, who published one of Greece's leading dailies and
defied the dictatorship that suspended democracy, was buried with full
state honours in Athens on Monday. She had died two days previously,
aged 84, after a long illness. Members of the Socialist Government,
political party leaders, and hundreds of journalists attended her
funeral at Athens's First Cemetery.
Known for her tenacity, Helen Vlachos was born in 1911, the only child
of George Vlachos who in 1918 founded the highly respected Kathimerini,
a morning paper compared to the New York Times. Helen Vlachos was seven
years old at the time and politics and publishing were to dominate her
life. Indeed she once described the Kathimerini as ''a younger sister
and the most important member of the family''.
Though first employed as a book-keeper by her father, she turned to
writing with a series of articles on the Far East, and continued with
her admired coverage of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. After the Second World
War -- in which her father had refused to co-operate with the Nazi
occupation -- Vlachos was given her own column in the Kathimerini. Its
immediacy and wit made it instantly popular, a popularity that was to
endure.
When her father died in 1951, Vlachos took over as publisher and
started writing bi-weekly columns chastising the government of the day.
She then founded an afternoon daily and also launched a magazine, along
the lines of Life.
When the military junta seized power in April, 1967, Vlachos closed
her publications to avoid censorship. After describing one of the ruling
army colonels as ''a clown'' five months later, she was placed under
house arrest. Later the same year she fled to London, where she was
granted political asylum and from there she continued her struggle
against the dictatorship until it collapsed in July 1974.
Vlachos returned to Athens and restarted the Kathimerini six weeks
later. She accepted for a while a parliamentary seat offered to her by
New Democracy, the party created by her friend Constantine Karamanlis,
who served as premier and president of Greece for over 20 years. She was
not, however, particularly happy as a politician, insisting that she was
first and foremost a journalist.
She was the author of several books written in English and Greek. In
her book in English titled Under House Arrest Vlachos gave a dramatic
account of how she managed to escape from arrest by dying her hair,
borrowing a friend's passport, and flying to London. A collection of her
columns was published in English under the title Mosaics.
Vlachos sold the Kathimerini in 1987, citing publishing difficulties
and changing political life styles. However, she continued to write a
weekly column for the new owner till failing health eased her into
retirement, which she spent between her two homes in Athens and London.
She loved Britain -- according to her friend and fellow Greek, the
author Mark Dragoumis -- and admired the British for their restraint,
their tongue-in-cheek comments, and their common sense.
He recalls her as a delightful person, an excellent listener who was
immediately able to go to the heart of things and make her points
directly and wittily, though she did not suffer fools gladly. ''She will
be dearly missed by all who knew her, even by those who had often
clashed with her,'' Mr Dragoumis says.
Vlachos married twice but did not have children. Her husband,
Constantine Loundras, survives her. She was an admirer of the former
King Constantine of Greece and he has personally expressed his
condolences to the family in a telegram.

leading professionals in the skills development and training field, died
suddenly at the age of 46 at his home on Saturday.
Dr Des Bonnar, chief executive of LEEL, paid tribute to Mr Leslie's
enthusiasm and commitment to his work. ''Many thousands of people who
did not even know him are the beneficiaries of the talents and
generosity of spirit he possessed and used to ensure they received the
opportunity to advance in their careers,'' he said.
LEEL chairman Mr Bob Maiden, describing his death as a terrible blow
to his family and colleagues, added: ''It is a tribute to his dedication
that last year a higher percentage of young people in the Lothians than
anywhere else in Scotland gained a job at the end of their training.''
Mr Leslie, who belonged to Edinburgh, will also be remembered for his
role as reserve goalkeeper with Hearts FC in the late 1960s.
He is survived by his wife, Gina, son Keith, and daughter Carolyn.

The Rev Murdo Alexander MacLeod, MA, Moderator, Free Church of
Scotland -- an appreciation by John Macleod
THE death of the Rev Murdo Alexander MacLeod, minister of Stornoway
Free Church and the denomination's longest-serving Moderator, has
stunned the Church and indeed the whole Isle of Lewis.
Born in Ness, Lewis, in 1935, Murdo Alex -- as in a denomination full
of MacLeods, he was universally known -- was the son of the manse. His
father, the Rev Alexander MacLeod, was at the time minister there; a
beloved preacher, he was later translated to St Columba's Free Gaelic
Church, Govan, Glasgow, and died suddenly at Back, Lewis, in 1954 --
also 60.
Contemporaries remember Murdo Alex as a personable lad, keen on
football -- it was a family talent: some MacLeods have played
professionally -- and much given to practical jokes.
These were interests he never quite repudiated; but, after his
father's death, he was awakened to his need of Christ's salvation for
his soul. Murdo Alex had not long professed faith -- he was then working
in a Glasgow office -- when he felt led to follow his late father into
the ministry of the Free Church.
After study at Aberdeen University and the Free Church College,
Edinburgh, Murdo Alex in 1966 was ordained and inducted to his first
charge at Drumchapel, Glasgow -- a new congregation of the Free Church,
formed only in the fifties. Here, and subsequently, he had a priceless
asset in his wife, Annibel Nicolson, from Point in Lewis.
In 1972, Mr MacLeod and expanding family moved to Dingwall, where he
laboured until 1978. He was already growing in reputation as a preacher
-- but, even more, as one of life's original personalities. He could
relate to anyone. The lapsed Free Church hearer he could visit, or meet,
and tease and jolly back to attendance. He was also, in the increasingly
dark politics of the Free Church, very shrewd.
In 1978 Murdo Alex began a fruitful ministry at Greyfriars Free
Church, Inverness. Here he built attendance to record levels,
establishing himself as perhaps the Free Church's foremost parish
minister; completed his family. What might have been a remarkable
pastorate, however, ended in March, 1984. Murdo Alex was called to
Stornoway.
The Lewis capital boasts not only the largest Free Church congregation
-- some 1400 regular hearers, not to mention thousands of nominal
adherents -- but it is the largest Presbyterian congregation in the
world. They actually have to hold parallel services in English and
Gaelic.
The pulpit work is hard, the pastoral burden murderous. Murdo Alex had
the assistance of a full-time lay agent, Malcolm MacLeod, and three
successive assistant ministers; he also had a huge deacons' court and a
kirk session as big as a synod. But the responsibility -- the worry --
was all his.
Murdo Alex was at the forefront of a successful campaign to prevent
Sunday ferries, active in educational committees, in the thick of
efforts to address the needs of Stornoway's teenagers. He would
willingly speak to a journalist or dash to Radio nan Gaidheal at a
moment's notice -- not for vainglory, but because he was eager to put a
Gospel witness across.
But he wasn't a killjoy. When Murdo Alex led protests against a
Stornoway fun-run -- it was part of a national event, for charity -- he
made plain his regard for the cause, and asked only that Stornoway's
fun-run be arranged for the Saturday. It was, and he was asked to fire
the starting pistol, which he did with gusto.
Murdo Alex took what relaxation he could. He was fascinated by the
Second World War, and would read up on its battles into the small hours.
He loved football, watching it, discussing it. Murdo Alex delighted in
company, and in brisk walks about Stornoway, hailing his flock in
characteristic chaffing fashion.
His sense of humour was legendary. After his first heart attack in
1979, that Murdo Alex decided to buy a bike. His first spin was to the
august manse of a senior colleague. He pedalled up to the door, skidded
to a halt, and rang the bell. ''Hi,'' he said to the lady of the house,
''can Hugh come out to play?''
His preaching was excellent. Murdo Alex had a strong voice and wasn't
afraid, on occasion, to use it. He was an all-round, exponent of the
fundamentals of Scripture, and of Christ, so strange to natural Man.
It was an impossible job, being minister of Stornoway. You suppose he
should have taken it easier. Called for more help, more assistance
(after all, the congregation sent a huge six-figure sum to Edinburgh
every year). But it wasn't Murdo Alex's way to go easy, to think of
retirement, to delegate. He spent himself fully in service, and to the
end.
In May of this year, the Stornoway minister was honoured with the
chair of Moderator of the General Assembly. In an ordinary year this
would have been a delight. This year, clouds hung over Edinburgh and
over the Free Church. The 1995 Assembly had to deal with matters of
extraordinary unpleasantness. Yet, in that week, MacLeod's jovial charm
did not slip. He was as courteous to reporters as ever. He chaired
emotive sessions of Assembly with firm competence and, now and again,
defusing wit.
That the Free Church is still in one piece, as we reach the end of
1995, owes much to him. In him, the Free Church has lost the last

William Milward Russell DSC, civil engineer and sailor; born February,
1912, died October 7, 1995
THE civil engineer and yachtsman William Russell, who has died at 83,
was the only son of William Russell, Tigh-na-Mara, Colintraive. He loved
rural Argyll and excelled in all it has to offer, becoming a skilled
sportsman, naturalist, and sailor. When his father represented Great
Britain, sailing at the highest international level in America, his boat
was crewed by William and William's sister. A remarkable family
achievement.
At Loretto School William qualified for Edinburgh University where he
earned a blue as their cox, and graduated in economics.
His working life began with the Fram civil engineering company in
Glasgow where he made an outstanding contribution. This period of hard
work, however, did not subdue his ever-present taste for fun.
When the war came Russell, like so many yachtsmen, volunteered for the
Royal Navy and enjoyed -- that is the right word -- a distinguished
career, becoming a lieutenant-commander.
Mentioned in despatches in 1944, he was awarded the DSC in 1945, the
citation reading: ''In recognition of gallantry, courage and devotion to
duty in clearing the Scheldt estuary of mines.'' He was thus among the
first to approach Fortress Europe on D-Day. Coincidentally his flotilla
was followed by that of his brother-in-law as they cleared the way for
invasion.
Another wartime posting took William to Shetland where he met Margaret
Cowan, a WRNS officer, who shared his love for fishing. Before the war
ended they were married: a precious union which endured until Margaret's
death nearly 50 years later.
Returning to Fram after the war, William soon contemplated early
retirement, but was persuaded by his colleagues to take on the direction
of an enlarged operation, which he did with notable success.
Despite that demanding job, and the travel it required, he rarely
missed a Scottish rugby international at home or away, and he resumed
his contribution to racing on the Clyde, both afloat and on the
committees.
His fishing continued but not always with a rod. The splash net, now
illegal, was not always so, and William was a legendary devotee. A great
supporter of clay-pigeon shooting, William was also a good shot and a
wonderful companion in the field, where his generosity, good fellowship,
and knowledge of the countryside were a boon to his companions and an
inspiration to youth.
He was buried in Colintraive, the Argyll village in which he, made his
home. No aspect of village life had escaped his notice, his
participation, and his support.

AS the clocks change and we fall back into winter time it comes not
alone. Reduced daylight hours bring the curtains to an early close and
all over the house lights are switched on. Occasionally a lightbulb will
go pop and a replacement will present a choice that is as long as the
day has become short. Traditional lightbulbs cost money to buy and more
money to burn. Perhaps it is time to look at the alternatives.
Electronic energy-saving lightbulbs use less than one-quarter of the
electricity of normal bulbs and can last 10 times longer. It is reckoned
that by replacing one lightbulb in your house it is possible to save
around #10 off your annual lightbulb bill. Clearly these savings will
increase the more energy-saving lightbulbs you employ.
A scheme to reduce the price of these energy-saving bulbs is now in
place and savings of around one-third (about #5) are feasible. Made
possible due to funding by the country's electricity companies, almost
1.25 million lightbulbs displaying the Billy the Dinosaur character will
be on sale at reduced prices.
Electronic energy-saving lightbulbs are correctly known as ''compact
fluorescent lamps'' or CFLs. They are simply scaled-down versions of
fluorescent strip lamps and when compared to a normal bulb they produce
light more efficiently, last longer and will save money in the long run.
Ordinary lightbulbs work by using electricity to heat a thin, coiled
tungsten wire, the filament, until it glows to a white heat. Most of the
electricity is used to generate heat making it quite an inefficient way
to produce light.
In the CFL, an electric current passes through a gas inside the glass
tube, causing the inside of the tube to glow brightly or fluoresce. This
is a more efficient way to produce light and does not have unwanted heat
as a by-product.
CFLs come in a wide range of shapes and sizes but they are all
variations on the same theme, a fluorescent strip that has been bent
into a compact shape which is in some cases covered by a light fitment
or dome. The lightbulb's electronics are housed in an adaptor which fits
into the bulb-holder; screw and bayonet fittings are also available.
These two-part bulbs have a reusable adaptor and when the lamp
eventually fails a new tube is all that need be bought.
They are best used where they are likely to be on for fairly lengthy
periods such as living rooms, hallways, stairs and for external
lighting. CFLs are also ideally suited for areas where access to a
fitment is difficult.
Hotels, offices and industry are already familiar with the benefits
associated with CFLs, however, the domestic market has been slow to
approve their benefit. Perhaps initial cost and lack of awareness has
put many off but just as loft insulation became a vital component of the
energy-efficient home then so too will the compact fluorescent.
A Department of the Environment information pamphlet highlights a
project carried out by staff at the National Power Technology Centre in
Leatherhead to examine the use of CFLs in the home. Thirty-three
households took part in the experiment in which nine remained with the
traditional tungsten lightbulb.
In each house an electricity meter was installed in the lighting
circuit to monitor the power consumed for lighting alone. Readings were
taken at monthly intervals and analysed.
The result of the study shows the cost-efficiency of CFLs ''the
majority of the lamps installed in halls, lounges and landings proved
highly cost effective with simple payback periods of less than three
years (based on a standard price of #13). In general CFLs were found to
be less cost effective in kitchens, dining rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms
and toilets since in these areas they were not operated for long
hours.''
The savings are not just financial. By reducing the amount of
electricity needed to light a bulb, the environment will be kept
cleaner. In 1994 one million energy-saving lightbulbs were sold which
alone saved enough carbon dioxide emissions (the main Greenhouse gas) to
fill 356,000 hot air balloons and enough electricity to run London's
public lighting for more than three years.
Mr Chris Brown of the Energy Saving Trust said: ''Switching to
energy-saving bulbs makes sense in many ways. If every home in the UK
switched to just one energy-saving lightbulb, #180m per annum would be
cut from the nation's lighting bill. Not only are they cheaper to run,
they also help the environment.
''By using energy-saving bulbs you can help conserve the world's
energy resources and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.''
All bulbs offered under the scheme are of the highest quality and
credited by the Energy Saving Trust with a lifetime of 10,000 hours.
They are available from leading supermarkets and DIY outlets.

SAVOURNA Stevenson's commissions for the biannual Borders Festival of
Myths and Legends have produced some memorable instrumental music over
the past few years, notably her Tweed Journey.
This time around the harpist has taken a different route by
collaborating with poets and lyricists Liz Lochhead, Valerie Gillies,
Michael Marra and Les Barker to produce some unusual extensions to the
border ballad tradition, sung in inimitable fashion by June Tabor.
Presented alongside more established songs of that ilk, including
Tabor's typically taut, news bulletin-style Dowie Dens O'Yarrow, the new
songs quickly indicated that we were not in for a cheery show. Death,
dyslexia and more death featured in rapid succession. But when bassist
Danny Thompson is involved, light relief is rarely far away. Taking a
break from forming a compact, jazzy partnership with Stevenson's harp,
Thompson prefaced a marvellous solo spot with some observations that
made it clear he knew all about Aberdeen's flag day reputation.
Barker, too, can be relied upon to entertain. His revision of the Maid
of Melrose Town, which Tabor sang deadpan to a boogie-woogie backing, is
a hilarious take on the theme of lovers parted by war, pledging undying
but doomed affection. Few writers could follow that with the grim
tidings of Jean Gordon (nine sons: eight hung and one murdered before
her troubles really started), and few singers could make the transition
so convincingly as Tabor. Beyond the Ballad returns to home ground to
complete its tour at the Maltings, Berwick tonight and the Tait Hall,
Kelso tomorrow.

Professor Paul Richards, CBE, botanist; born December 19, 1908, died
October 4, 1995
ONE of the pioneers of tropical rainforest ecology, Professor Paul
Richards, has died aged 86.
Born in Walton on the Hill, Surrey, he grew up in Wales and showed his
first passion for bryophytes -- mosses and liverworts -- while a
schoolboy. Just out of short trousers, he wrote to one of the best-known
British botanists of the era, Henry N Dixon, asking for an appointment
to discuss bryophytes. To Dixon's surprise, he was confronted by a young
teenager, clutching his school cap, instead of the mature scientist he
was expecting.
But the meeting proved to be the forerunner of many significant
achievements. In British botany circles he became known as an expert in
bryophytes -- a subject on which he was still publishing well into his
eighties.
Internationally it was his work on the tropical rainforest for which
he was acclaimed. In 1952 he published The Tropical Rain Forest, which
became something of a standard text and was translated into a number of
languages. He first visited a rainforest as a second-year undergraduate
at Cambridge in 1929 when he joined an Oxford expedition to British
Guiana (now Guyana).
He completed his studies at Cambridge, graduating with a first-class
degree, and after a period of research at Cambridge, moved to the
University College of North Wales in Bangor where he became Professor of
Botany.
Throughout his career he received a number of honours and prizes,
including the Frank Smart Prize of Cambridge University, 1931-33, and
the Gold Medal for Botany of the Linnean Society of London. In 1974 he
was made a CBE.
He is survived by his wife Sarah Anne Richards, one son, and three
daughters.

MY father shoots them. He leans out of his bedroom window, takes aim
at the fluffy tail, and pulls the trigger of his air gun. Sometimes he
just gives them a good fright. On other occasions he kills them. It's
been a while since they came into his garden to pinch the nuts off the
bird table.
When I told an eminent conservationist in Scotland about it, he
approved. Quite right, he said. For, cute, cuddly little things that
they are, grey squirrels are now considered the enemy.
They are not just the enemy of the landowner whose trees the grey
squirrel strips bare, but the enemy of their cousin, the red squirrel.
And the red is just as cute and cuddly. What's more it was here first.
The grey was introduced to this country about 140 years ago for its
aesthetic value. In other words, someone thought it was pretty, thought
he would like to see this cute grey creature running up and down the
branches of the trees in his neck of the woods, and brought it in.
Why must we meddle so? The grey squirrel was perfectly happy in his
native American woods. But his arrival has almost killed off the red.
There are now fewer than 160,000 red squirrels in Britain --
three-quarters of them in Scotland and most of them in the South-west.
This week scientists have been debating the problem at a conference
held at Edinburgh Zoo -- perhaps hoping to find a solution before the
red goes from being a threatened species to an extinct one that has to
be bred in captivity.
Earlier this year Scottish Natural Heritage named the red squirrel as
one of the species it wanted to save in its species action programme.
This week Dr Tom Tew, a senior scientist with the Joint Nature
Conservation Committee, explained that it was now possible to feed reds
selectively. Now how do you feed one species and not another when they
are living in the same forest? Simple. You install a hopper. The nuts
are placed at the end of this device and the grey scuttles along towards
his dinner. On the way, he triggers the release on a trap door as he
tries to reach the nuts, and the next thing he knows, he is on the
ground. The red, on the other hand, being a much lighter animal, crosses
safely over the trap door to the nuts.
BUT let's be honest. It's going to take a heck of a lot of hoppers to
redress the balance of two-and-a-half million greys to 160,000 reds.
Which is why some tough decisions are going to have to be taken.
Someone, somewhere, is going to have to launch a campaign to rid us of
this pest. And that means shooting and poisoning.
There are other measures that can be taken, but generally they are
only half-measures or they will harm another species.
It seems we just keep making the same mistake over and over again. Or
at least our great grandfathers made the mistakes and we're being left
with the mess to clear up. They introduced mink for vanity's sake.
What's happening now is that campaigns are being launched to trap and
kill them too because they are depleting sea-bird populations and
killing water-voles.
They introduced the muntjac Chinese deer because they were such pretty
animals. Now, the muntjacs have chomped their way through woodlands in
England and Wales and are making headway into Scotland. And gardeners
will be all too well aware that the New Zealand bloodworm is attacking
our own native worms.
Some people may say that you can't turn the clock back. That the grey
squirrels that swarm across the footbridges over the river Kelvin in the
Botanic Gardens in Glasgow have just as much right to live as the red
squirrels in Galloway.
It's true, the natural world is constantly evolving and we will never
be able to return to the world we had 300 years ago when our Highlands
were full of bear, lynx, and wolves, no matter how we try.
So why do we try to right some wrongs and not others? I suppose
because some are possible and others are not. Because if we didn't make
the effort for some species while they still had a chance, then it would
be giving up. Because if we accepted the argument that nature should be
allowed to take its course unchecked, we would allow even more people to
die from floods and famines without aid intervention.
But we know that it is because we have moved water-courses, abused the
land, and meddled for profit in places where we should never have been,
that the earth is giving up -- with a whimper in some places, with a
howl of rage in others.
Maybe that's why we feel that if we can save the red squirrel, even if
it is at the expense of some greys, then we redress the balance
elsewhere, and our guilt will be eased.

MONDAY: We were all sorry that Her Majesty could not attend the State
Opening of the Scottish Parliament but were sure the fact that she had
been hit on the head by a grouse during a previous visit had nothing at
all to do with it. She felt a cold coming on. Anyway, the Princess Royal
deputised and she sure can belt out Flower of Scotland with the best of
them.
There was a lengthy discussion in the Labour Group about what we
should wear. In the event there were a few kilts but the spin-doctors
don't like them much as they tend to strobe on the telly. Eric Clarke
came in a miner's lamp, Robin Cook was dressed as a jockey, while Bob
Gould and Keith Geddes, the real power brokers, appeared as Frankie and
Josie. No, I don't know which was which.
The Tories, now led by the Lord Lindsay who talks like Hugh Grant and
looks like Robert Redford -- actually my wife says he looks better than
Robert Redford -- all wore black ties. For the Liberal Democrats Mr
Robert Maclennan donned a toga but nobody paid the slightest attention;
he said he was used to this treatment from his Westminster days.
Alex ''Slippery Slope'' Salmond, eternal leader of the Nats, declared
the whole gathering to be nothing more than a ''puppet parliament''.
Perhaps to underline the point, a Mrs Ewing came dressed as Looby Lou.
Canon Kenyon Wright (Ind. Glencarse) insisted the day had been
''historic''.
TUESDAY: This was the big picture, choosing the new Chief Minister.
Funny title for a Premier, sounds more like that Church of Scotland chap
with the breeches.
Robin Cook ran a book and gave the odds as 4/7 Bob Gould, 9/2 Keith
Geddes, 7/1 Rosemary McKenna, 10/1 Jean McFadden, 100/8 Pat Lally, 25/1
Alex Salmond, 100/1 bar.
The trouble was, having agreed to this daft PR system -- never again,
some of our supporters voted for four different parties by mistake and
the spoilt ballot papers won one seat -- we did not receive an overall
majority.
To confuse the issue, and because we could not agree among ourselves,
we put up three candidates for the top job, the Tories, the Lib-Dems,
the Nats, the Monster Loonies, and the Inds. all sponsored their
choices. After seven ballots Canon Kenyon Wright was elected Chief
Minister.
''This has certainly been a historic day,'' he told us. We got
banjaxed in the Waverley Bar.
WEDNESDAY: Raised income tax by 3p in the #1. Sad, but had to be done,
as Finance Minister Jimmy Wray explained in a long but extremely cogent
Budget speech during which he sipped, as tradition demands, from a small
goldie. Extra civil servants, more council houses, re-reform of local
government, big salaries for us don't come in lucky bags, he explained
wittily.
''You're worse than the bloody Tories,'' yelled Kenny Macaskill (SNP,
Bathgate) before he was suspended from the Chamber for six months. We
are not going to tolerate that kind of yobbish behaviour in the new
Parliament.
The Budget was approved by 65 votes to 63 and Jimmy received a
six-second sitting ovation. ''An absolutely historic decision,'' cried
the Chief Minister.
THURSDAY: I have been put on the Education Select Committee which,
apparently, has to trudge round the country looking at schools in Wick,
Pumpherston, and Prestonpans. Can't help recalling the bad old days on
Motherwell District Council when the world was our playground.
This ancient Royal High School building is quite comfortable, though,
even if the second largest room is for ladies only. High time these
women spent more time at home, one of my Labour colleagues joked.
Suspended, six weeks.
I was sitting today in what someone told me was the old library. A lad
called Walter Scott had carved his name on a desk. Selective schools
never did work, as I tried to tell Tony many a time.
All Japanese electronics companies have announced they are moving from
Scotland to Kent where everything is cheaper. ''You cannot but say that
we live in historic times,'' the CM stated as he responded to a motion
of no confidence in himself.
FRIDAY: Started well enough. We collected our first pay-pokes and were
set to return to our constituencies, well, those of us who have
constituencies that is, about one-third of the members here are not
elected at all. Because it was the half-day most of our gang had
gathered in the Jinglin' Geordies to celebrate the 11 o'clock opening or
some such momentous event. Then the division bells went off.
We struggled back up Waterloo Place, past the Calton Hill, where
Adrian was just saying you meet a fascinating range of people, and
puffed into the old building.
Gordon Brown was there. Aye, him who's the UK Chancellor; he wasn't
looking too cheery, but you can't expect miracles.
''The Blair Government has fallen,'' he wailed. ''The IMF has called
in the loans. We're doomed, all of us, doomed . . .'' He was led quietly
away.
The wee Canon was on his feet. ''We are to wait here for a message
from Westminster. Her Majesty has asked Malcolm Rifkind (Con. Edinburgh
Pentlands) to form a Government. Mr Michael Forsyth (Con. Stirling) will
be returning as Secretary of State. Hurrah, cried Lord Lindsay loyally,
the rest of us sat stunned.
''I think we must concede,'' began the Chief Minister again, ''that
this has been . . .''
There was absolutely no need for Tommy to hit him, by the way;
understandable nevertheless. So far, the year 2004 has been a real
bummer.

CARDBOARD boxes. ''Oh, yes,'' says Clea Wallis, director of
Dudendance, laughing at the recollection. ''For ages I couldn't walk
past any large box without thinking -- should I take it, just in case .
. .'' The boxes, you should know, were a core part of Dudendance's first
showing in Scotland -- a residency at Paisley Arts Centre that
culminated in a performance. And, subsequently, in the group's
relocation to Glasgow where they are about to perform at The Tramway.
That Paisley residency -- set up by Steve Slater who's now programming
with Glasgow's Department of Performing Arts and Venues -- convinced
Clea that London had really become a no-go area for Dudendance. ''We
just couldn't get over the amount of support we got at Paisley. People
seemed genuinely interested in the work. They wanted to know when we'd
be back. You reviewed us. It was just so different from what we'd been
used to!
''We'd been battling away in London for ages, feeling more and more
out of it. We'd had some good notices -- but it was as if there was a
network and we weren't part of it, couldn't get to be part of it.
Funders didn't bother coming to see the work. We couldn't even get an
appointment to see someone at the Arts Council to talk about our ideas.
''We had no funding, no money to pay an administrator. Or a
professional publicist. It just seemed that everything had become a
marketing rat race and we simply couldn't compete.''
Just how different things could be had already been realised during a
two-year period in South America. There she found that ''you didn't need
to be flash'' to take part in cultural festivals . . . and, ''gosh! . .
. they paid well''. For someone who had been cleaning part-time in order
to continue working with Dudendance -- ''anything that was hard graft
with low pay'' she says, without a trace of a whinge -- South America
seemed the answer to most things. Indeed, she kept meaning to go back.
But then Dudendance discovered Paisley and vice versa . . .
These days she sounds remarkably cheerful. A summer project, where
they organised a whole programme of classes, unexpectedly brought a
range of inexperienced but passionately interested people in off the
street. That absolutely delighted her. As does working, for the first
time ever, with a composer on the music for Tetrachord, seeing how
sounds can add in layers of meaning and open up new ways of looking at
things. She is keen, always, to find new ways of looking at things.
Carrier bags. This time the Dudendance view of life, its foibles and
its petty tyrannies involves plastic carrier bags. Like the Wombles,
Clea has an eye for thrifty recycling. But if the props are slightly
used, the work itself is fresh.
In the interests of keeping such a resourceful company in Glasgow, I'm
willing to tender my personal hoard of rubber bands, paper clips, hat
boxes and leaning towers of newspapers -- I've seen what glories they
can conjure with simple junk!
* Dudendance perform Tetrachord at The Tramway on Wednesday and
Thursday at 8pm -- this is part of the Dark Lights season which also
includes Group N with Unbroken View Extended Frame this Saturday, also
at 8pm.

IN HIS introduction to the Scottish Autumn festival brochure,
Hungarian minister Torok Andras says: ''Hungarian people at large think
they know a lot about Scotland -- whisky and bagpipes and the kilt . . .
Some intellectuals have read a lot of Walter Scott, are enthusiastic
about Charles Rennie Mackintosh of Glasgow . . . and the Edinburgh
Festival.''
The Deputy State Secretary for Culture believes many of his fellow
nationals harbour general misconceptions about Bonnie Jockland.
Organised by The British Council in Budapest, Skot Osz '95 aims to
burst the stereotypical bubbles of Hungarians' perceptions of Scottish
culture with an impressive six-week jamboree of music, theatre, film,
literature and visual art.
As Viveca Abrahams, assistant director with Budapest British Council
explains, the festival has been a long time in the planning. ''There
seemed to be just so many exciting things happening on the Scottish arts
scene that it was a natural choice to devote an entire festival purely
towards Scotland.''
During Mayfest this year Abrahams dispatched a reconnaissance team of
Hungarian arts officials to Scotland where they liaised with people like
Charles Escher at Tramway, Shonagh Irvine from the literature department
at the Scottish Arts Council, Nicola White at the CCA, and Sound City
man John Williamson, all of whom advised the team as to the good, the
fresh and the funky.
On the whole, the reconnaissance mission can be judged a success.
Especially strong is the film programme which has managed to import 12
milestones in contemporary Scottish film-making (a feat in itself) from
Venus Peter to Shallow Grave, Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life and a
Bill Douglas trilogy. The visual arts and literature programmes are
spot-on but theatre is a bit low on the ground.
And the music programme has a heavy folkie bent counteracted only by
Creeping Bent's punky popsters The Secret Goldfish.
Beata Veszely, curator with the Ujlak Exhibition Hall, is one of those
who chose to exhibit the likes of CCA, Transmission and Tramway regulars
such as Ross Sinclair, Christine Borland, Roddy Buchanan plus Jackie
Donachie, Douglas Gordon, Tracy Mackenna, Dave Allen and Eva Rothschild
whose predominantly conceptual work is among the 18 Scottish-based
artists scattered throughout Budapest's cutting-edge galleries.
Lest anyone get the idea that this festival's intent is to gain one
enormous ego boost as Scottish arts show off to their ''deprived''
Eastern European cousins, Abrahams diplomatically points out that the
emphasis is on ''partnership and nurturing future links'' between the
two countries.
However, the torch of long-term collaboration is to be carried by
Theatre Cryptic who set out later this week to tour Hungary and the
Czech Republic with their critically-acclaimed production of Michele
Roberts' Child Lover. As Boyd explains, not only will they be performing
but they will also be auditioning for their new production Parallel
Lines, an adaptation of the last chapter of Ulysses. She hopes to tour
Hungary with the completed production of Parallel Lines.
Indeed if these valiant efforts by our varied artistic Scottish
ambassadors don't dispel the kilted, whisky-sloshing, haggis-eating Jock
image, nothing will.

KEVIN MAXWELL's old man was indeed a bully, and anyone who knew him
knows that to be true. A bully needs to surround himself with people who
can be bullied. Those bullied by brutes in domestic circumstances or in
schools have little choice and evoke our sympathy. Others allow
themselves to be bullied for base reasons.
Maxwell had the enormous unelected power that goes with the ownership
of enormous wealth. He used his wealth to buy executives whom he
bullied. They could have told him to get stuffed, but his money brought
their compliance.
I was in the Mirror building in London one day and he phoned down and
boomed: ''Jimmy I heard you were in the building, come up and see me for
a minute.'' It was to be for more than a minute.
His waiting room was crowded with Mirror Group executives. He came to
his office door, jacket off, broad galluses, the fashion accessory to
come of the busy young executive, valiantly holding up his trousers. He
ushered me into his office without a glance at those waiting.
Cap'n Bob wanted to talk about everything under the sun. When I made
moves to leave he would immediately branch into some other subject,
suggesting more tea or coffee and sandwiches, a brandy perhaps.
Eventually I had to go or miss my plane. He walked me to the door,
bade me bon voyage, then closed it without even a peep outside. The same
people were waiting. Some I knew. We swopped pleasantries. One let it
drop that they had been waiting since 9 o'clock that morning. It was now
after 4pm. I was shocked and angry.
Angry at Maxwell for treating people like this. Angry at those who let
him treat them this way. I wouldn't wait hours for anyone, unless there
was a bloody good reason, like a near fatal accident, nor would any
other punter. But these guys hadn't the bottle of the punter. Executive
status and salaries, not to mention the executive toilet, meant more to
them than humiliation.
In 1986 Kenny Gallagher, Herald scribe, jazz fan extraordinaire,
Glesgafied Dundonian, and good friend, told me that Kelvin McKenzie,
editor of the Sun, was very keen to have a word with me.
I was intrigued. My political viewpoint and the editorial line of the
Sun were diametric opposites. We met in a hotel restaurant near the
Embankment. Kelvin wanted me to work for him as a columnist. Free to
write what I wanted.
I explained the need for me to have discussions with others,
particularly with some political friends. He understood. I discussed the
proposition with Neil Kinnock, then leader of the Labour Party. Neil
wanted me to accept for they desperately wanted a friendly voice within
the tabloid he considered a priceless vote winner for the Tories.
Later Glenys joined us for a meal in an Italian restaurant in Covent
Garden. It was delightful. When relaxed, away from the public eye and
able to be themselves, they are delightful company. It was a great pity
that their natural likeability was overlain with media hype and gloss by
the spin-doctors during General Elections.
But Neil had decided, I think in consultation with others, that it
would be prudent to explain everything to Maxwell, who promptly
exploded. The upshot was that I was to stay put, as they didn't want to
antagonise the owner of the Mirror Group that gave it support.
I wrote to Kelvin McKenzie and briefly explained the circumstances. He
wrote back saying his offer still stood, etc. The outcome was that I
ended up writing for the Mirror and the Record at a time when contracted
to the production of some television documentaries. It was a real bind.
Maxwell explained the position to me and asked if I wanted paid,
offshore. My ''What!'' spoke volumes and he quickly changed the subject.
This it seemed, was standard practice for some, in this bastion of
''socialism''.
It was quietly resolved that Labour's leader would eventually have
what he thought best for the Labour movement, without bringing down the
wrath of Maxwell on his head, and so it came to be.
Neil's fear of antagonising Maxwell, whom he thought mad, was
perfectly understandable, given the hostility to Labour of all other
mass circulation papers. But the issue was to be faced sooner or later,
and not just by Labour. Why should the likes of Maxwell or Murdoch have
such political clout? They hadn't earned it by the display of social
virtues. They weren't noted for their advocacy of a moral philosophy
which might add to the sensibility of civic and public life.
They were wheelers and dealers, made money, and therefore had power.
They bought newspapers and television outlets and thus political power.
Party leaders court them as if they came to where they were by divine
right, feudal kings in a free-market economy.
The Mirror Group de-recognised trade unions. Labour promises to
legislate for trade-union rights for the workers at GCHQ, Cheltenham,
but will not declare itself in support of trade-union rights at the
Mirror, because it doesn't want to offend the new owners.
Murdoch is wooed by Blair and Major though he hasn't even got a vote
in this country. Neither will take a stand against the extent of his
cross-media ownership because they fear the hostility of his papers.
The right to vote is an important factor in the democratic equation.
Access to information is equally important. An uninformed, misinformed
electorate devalues the vote and makes nonsense of democracy. Vast
concentrations of media ownership, unconstrained by public
accountability, are a violation of the democratic ethos.
EVERY dictator starts by seizing control of the media. Why in a free
society should a few people be allowed to buy it all up? Our democracy
needs smaller groupings of independent newspapers which would be more
likely to reflect the plural views of our society, and near monopoly
control of commercial television should be taboo.
'''Here's freedom to them that wad read, Here's freedom to them that
wad write, There's nane ever fear'd that the truth should be heard, But
they whom the truth would indite.'
We Scots don't need spin-doctors, we've got Rabbie.

SO, coming soon to a high school near you: a nation once again, sort
of.
Strictly in a semi-autonomous, additionally membered,
slightly-entrenched, somewhat gender-balanced, negotiations with the
Treasury permitting manner, but a nation, sort of. With a version of a
parliament. And MPs, after a fashion.
To say that news of the Lab-Lib Contrived by '95 deal has not set the
world on its ear is to say nothing. Nevertheless, Michael Forsyth,
predictably and conspicuously, has led criticisms of the proposed
''tartan tax'' that would keep the parliament from the poorhouse.
We had not realised hitherto that the Scottish Secretary was a fan of
A Claim of Right for Scotland, first advanced in 1988, but so it seems.
''It has been argued,'' says that document, ''that an Assembly would
condemn the Scots to taxation permanently higher than that elsewhere in
the United Kingdom. Any Assembly scheme which does will have been
wrongly conceived.''
So let's get this straight: Labour MPs adopted a document opposed to
''permanently higher'' taxation for Scotland but now propose a scheme
under which Scotland's income taxes might be ''varied''. The Tories,
meanwhile, denounced the paper because it agreed with them. And both,
needless to say, wish for nothing more than the strengthening of the UK.
On which note: when Forsyth tells the Commons, as he did yesterday,
that devolution will mean a ''jobs holocaust'', are we to understand he
means one job in the Stirling area in particular?
The Sunday capers
THE target audience for the Sunday Times Scotland has always been
something of a mystery to us. Now, thanks to a personal ad published by
the tabloid last weekend, things may be just a little more clear.
Inviting readers to ''turn fantasy into reality'', the sizable advert
suggests they rush their orders to ''Transformation'' of Manchester for
a full colour catalogue priced at only #15, ''fully refundable with each
order'', from ''the world's leading TV specialists''.
Improved reception perhaps? A new satellite dish? Subscriptions to the
Radio Times? Not exactly.
As it turns out, Transformation's mission in life is ''Turning Men
into Beautiful Women'' with ''Everything a crossdresser could ever
fantasise about'', not least wigs, ''fetish frills'', ''waist
clinchers'', and, um, ''beard cover''. All this illustrated by drawings
of what appear to be Bet Lynch and one of the Bradford &amp; Bingley chaps.
We had always wondered why the Sunday Times was so popular with Tory
MPs. Given that Transformation also offers a ''virtual reality info
line'', we now know one good reason.
Yours, Disaffected
AS brother Shields was kind enough to recall yesterday, the Diary's
own Pissed-Off Pedagogues Virtual Reality Info Line continues to buzz,
with disaffection among academics apparently spreading far and wide.
This week it's the University of Paisley, God love it, and another
anonymous missive.
Interestingly, while making some entirely defamatory remarks about
''toffs'', poorly qualified and motivated students, and ''drop-outs from
'real universities' in most top jobs'' which we are unable to quote in
full out of deference to the blood pressure of the lawyers, our
correspondent recalls that Paisley has been ranked 96 out of 96 in
educational league tables.
Our own feeling, for what it's worth, is that someone has to be, but
the writer instead blames Scottish educational correspondents for
keeping the news to themselves. ''Fans with typewriters'', he/she says,
''who publish gushing hand-outs verbatim but find league tables
politically incorrect''.
Honest, guys, that's just what it says here. But to keep our
correspondent happy, we can now report that he/she has been promoted to
the top of our all-new Pissed-Off Pedagogues Poisoned Pen Premier
Division.
There is, as fans with typewriters like to say, everything still to
play for.
Conference thrill
IF some among you have wondered, as one does, what political
correspondents actually do at party conferences other than paddle in the
waters of Lethe, we may be able to help.
Picture the scene: Blackpool in October, the lunch hour, and a
breather before the next Tory rises to damn all the offspring of
immigrants not named Portillo, Howard or Rifkind. The hacks are at a
loose end.
Got it, says one (or words to that effect). Does not this fair resort
boast Britain's largest roller coaster? Is it not a sickening,
gut-churning, horrifying ride in no way resembling a day at the Tory
party conference? Yes (omnes), truly it is.
Thus, with Mr Simon Hoggart of the Guardian, a noted connoisseur of
thrill rides on three continents in the van, supported by our own Mr
Robbie Dinwoodie (a Hearts fan familiar with ups and downs), Mr Matthew
Parris of the Times, and Mr Steve Bell, the Guardian's ace cartoonist, a
dash is made along Blackpool prom, innards are left hundreds of feet in
the air, a commemorative photograph taken, and the hacks are returned,
refreshed, in just the right mood for the conference.
It is fair to say that at least this provided Mr Bell with the
inspiration for the next day's front-page Guardian drawing (depicting
the Cabinet on the way down). But the next time anyone mentions
''gentlemen of the press'', you'll know exactly what to say.
Put that in
pipes
AH, the skirl (''1. vi, scream, cry out with fear, pain or grief 16-.
2. vti, utter with a high-pitched discordant sound . . .'' -- Concise
Scots Dictionary) of the pipes. The Scottish Tourist Board thinks we
should know more.
To that end it has issued 10,000 copies of a new leaflet -- The Great
Highland Bagpipe: Where and When to See the Pipes Played in Scotland --
answering the pressing questions of native and visitor alike.
''What does the pipe look like?'' it demands, as though asking for a
cruel answer. ''Why do the pipes sound different?'' it goes on, leaving
itself wide open. ''Why were the pipes banned?'' it inquires, leaving
one or two of us with unkind thoughts.
Finally, it pops what may be the killer question for those whose
admiration for Ceol Mor is limited: ''How long can a pipe tune last?''
Oh, go on, then: not very long -- it just feels that way.

THE revival of Ron Hutchinson's furious four-handed why-he-dunnit
about the IRA prisoner beaten up by the RUC man in Paddington Green
makes a dramatic opener for the arrival of the Royal Court in the West
End. With typical flourish, Stephen Daldry and designer Bill Dudley have
done a ''kitchen'' on the downstairs stalls of the Duke of York's,
tearing out its innards and turning the auditorium into a veritable
bear-baiting or Elizabethan cockpit.
An inspired visual statement you'd think for a play that historically
recalls the long, dark recesses of time of internecine Irish conflict
and emotionally and verbally ressembles nothing so much as a pugilistic
battering ram -- ''Prod'' and ''Finian'' slugging it out to the sound of
English coppers stamping on their heads.
Yet for all that, Hutchinson's close-cropped ferocity doesn't quite
come off. Ironically, it's the dynamics of the new staging that
mitigates against its own impact. Rufus Sewell's IRA prisoner is less
effective than he might be swivelling this way and that to address the
four-sided audience though Tony Doyle's menacing RUC interrogator has no
such difficulties. Mesmerising as an animal trapped by his own fury,
he's matched by John Castle and Pearce Quigley as the two shocking
examples of English cynicism and amusing but blinding petty-minded
self-interest.

IT'S a gloomy warning: ''Truth is a scarce commodity at any time. When
it comes to the Irish situation it gets scarcer.'' And it was uttered on
a windy night in Edinburgh earlier this week by one of Ireland's most
influential commentators.
But Tim Pat Coogan, writer, former editor of the ill-fated Irish Press
and friend of the Dublin political set, has more than just warnings to
issue. Best known for his detailed study of the IRA and a scathing
critique of the Republic's revered statesman, Eamon de Valera, Coogan
has in his latest book shone a bright light into some of the murkier
aspects of Northern Ireland's ''Troubles''.
Following the IRA ceasefire more than a year ago and the seeming
impasse reached over the peace process, Coogan attempts in his 405-page
tome The Troubles to explain why violence again engulfed the Province in
the Sixties, the path the bloodshed took and, a quarter of a century
later, how the fragile peace was made.
A vein of anger runs through his descriptions of Ulster bigotry borne
out of the belief that the British public's understanding of the
Troubles has been filtered by a media peering across the Irish Sea
through ''a telescope with a cap on it''.
Viewed through a Dublin telescope with the cap off, the jingoism of
the London tabloids lauding the efforts of the British Army have been at
best frustrating, at worst damaging, he says. In spite of the efforts of
individual journalists, the broadsheets and the BBC fared little better
during the Seventies and Eighties; too inclined to gave in over pressure
to ban critical programmes perceived as giving credence to the
Republican viewpoint and losing sight of the elusive ''truth'' in a
''media war'' fought with the Whitehall spin doctors.
It is a point he reiterated in Edinburgh earlier this week during a
tour of Britain to promote his book. As someone whose life and career
has been caught up in reporting, analysing and at times playing the part
of conduit between North and South, he laments the low priority to the
Whitehall bureaucrats who, he says, have principally seen the problem as
one of eradicating or containing terrorism rather than addressing the
political problem.
But perhaps Coogan's most significant contribution towards the pursuit
of ''truth'' is his investigation into the ''dirty tricks'' war waged by
the myriad of Government intelligence-gathering units, the rivalry
between the army and the RUC and the treatment of ''touts'' or
informers.
His description of some of the grimmer operations carried out by MI5,
MI6, the RUC and army intelligence skim only the very surface, he says.
For even the world-weary, the details of collusion between the RUC and
Loyalist paramilitaries, the security forces' shoot-to-kill policy and
allegations that Republicans like SDLP leader John Hume and Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams were poisoned are startling. Coogan says: ''It
must be acknowledged that the episodes, described and surmised,
unquestionably point towards a very dirty form of warfare all round.''
Coogan also sheds some light on the machinations of the peace process
and in particular the role played by the Clinton administration, backed
by the powerful Irish-American lobby. If, he says, the Unionists resent
the meddling of the Americans and the increasingly popular US ambassador
to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, they should note that the ''unofficial''
trans-Atlantic negotiations have been crucial in securing and
maintaining the peace. Clinton's imminent visit to Ireland is, he adds,
the only hope of the process shifting from neutral to first gear.
Like other Southern commentators Coogan is highly critical of the
Government's stance on decommissioning, claiming there are about 130,000
weapons in Loyalist hands. Yet he is also optimistic. ''Despite the
obstacles, my settled conviction is that Ireland's peace is reachable
from here.''
His vision of the Ireland of the future is one where the image of the
South as one big subsidised farm is transcended by a united state with a
flourishing culture and one in which Protestant leaders are able to look
over the ''No Surrender'' fence and lead their communities forward.
The Troubles by Tim Pat Coogan is published by Hutchison, priced #20.

WHEN the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio appear with the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra, the chances are that they will have Beethoven's
triple concerto in tow, along perhaps with a bit of Mendelssohn. But
though the diet tends to be predictable, it usually manages to stay on
the right side of staleness, as last night's concert for the most part
confirmed.
True, it began somewhat weightily with Jaime Laredo forsaking his
violin to direct a dignified rather than audaciously Mozartian account
of the Haffner symphony -- the first movement big-boned, the andante
romantically slow-moving (or so it sounded in the aftermath of
Mackerras), the minuet and finale not at all mercurial.
Nor could Joseph Kalichstein's treatment of Mendelssohn's G minor
piano concerto be described as in any way elfin, though it was certainly
delivered with all the panache the music needs and he did relax enough
to let the slow movement (where there was some delightful cello tone)
make its point.
But the concert, like the soloists themselves, finally came together
in the Beethoven. This was the evening's raison d'etre, every nuance of
which Laredo as conductor and violinist knows how to handle, and whose
multiplicity of problems he has long ago solved. Again this was in no
sense a lightweight chamber performance, in spite of the chamber-sized
forces, and in the first movement the Eroica symphony seemed always
somewhere in the background.
Kalichstein's piano playing was filled with foretastes of the Emperor,
Laredo's (especially in the upper register) of the violin concerto, and
Sharon Robinson's of the cello concerto Beethoven sadly never wrote.
Though a few exaggerations seem to have crept into their interpretation
over the years -- the odd obtrusive slow-up or extra surge of momentum
-- these were a small price to pay for a performance that clearly
believed in this underrated work and projected it with conviction.

Mark Fisher examines the threat to arts funding posed by the arrival
of the new unitary auithorities
ON APRIL 1 next year the existing Scottish regional and district
councils will hand over power to the new unitary authorities. Step aside
Fife Region along with the district councils of Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy,
and North East Fife, enter Fife Council. Out with Highland Region and
its eight district councils, in with the all-new Highland Council.
Whatever the motives of central government, changes are going to come.
Less certain is how arts organisations that previously received
funding from both district and region are going to fare when their grant
applications go in to just one new authority. Can the new City of
Edinburgh Council, for example, be expected to support the city's
artists to the same extent as the old Lothian Region and Edinburgh
District combined?
The prevalent belief is that the figures are unlikely to add up. It is
not that local government, new or old, lacks the political will to
support the arts -- far from it, local government in Scotland currently
provides more public arts subsidy than any single funding body. In the
year 1992/93, they gave out an estimated #35.5m in revenue grants, and
almost twice as much again for the funding of arts bursaries, teachers,
and advisers. By contrast, in the same year the Scottish Arts Council
handed out around #21m. It would be wrong to imagine that the new
authorities will be so radically different that overnight the arts will
cease to be valued.
But it is precisely because such a large sum of money is at stake that
worry has set in. ''The contribution of the local authorities is
pivotal,'' says Eric Robinson of the Scottish arts lobby, Salvo. ''It is
absolutely crucial, and that is why everyone is so concerned.''
There are bound to be casualties in the chaos of transition. The
uncertainty itself -- the new authorities have still to have their
budgets set -- means that for the next few months forward-planning will
be guesswork. And even after April, the new councils will have plenty to
worry about -- social services, education, local transport, employment
-- before they get round to serious thinking about arts policy.
One anticipated problem arises from the fact that many arts
organisations have a catchment area much bigger than that covered by
their new authority. They may be an asset to their immediate locality,
but that doesn't stop them being a benefit to the region as a whole.
Take the Citizens' Theatre. It currently receives funding from
Strathclyde Region (#178,000), Glasgow City Council (#378,00), and the
Scottish Arts Council (#628,000). Assuming that the amount of SAC
support remains the same, it will be looking for #556,000 under the new
system, if it is to maintain its output at the current level.
The new City of Glasgow will be its obvious first port of call, but
what of the people of Eastwood, of Bearsden, of Clydebank, any of who
continue to benefit from the theatre? It will be harder for the
Citizens' to persuade the new authorities of East Renfrewshire, East
Dunbartonshire and Dumbarton and Clydebank that they ought to fund a
theatre that exists outwith their geographical boundaries. Not
surprisingly, Giles Havergal, the theatre's artistic director who has
not incurred a deficit in 25 years, is contemplating closing his doors
for anything up to six months next year.
The situation is not all bleak. Many people believe that the system of
funding will be simplified by having only one authority to approach. The
change also opens up the opportunity to look afresh at old anomalies.
If, for example, the authorities adopt a coherent arts policy, as is
being urged by Salvo, the Scottish Arts Council, and Cosla, then artists
should find their position clearer, negotiations more straight-forward
and councils more easily accountable.
Another spin-off could be greater harmony between the departments that
control spending on leisure (currently a district council remit) and on
education (a regional council concern).
''We could see these vital two sides of artistic activity in Scotland
working together,'' says Donald Smith, director of Edinburgh's Netherbow
Arts Centre, which caters to a mixed audience of schools, outlying
communities and regular city theatre and gallery-goers.''
The situation wil be more complicated for organisations whose work
straddles departments. Edinburgh's Theatre Workshop will be hoping that
the new council will be able to match the funding it gets from not one,
but two, departments of Edinburgh District Council -- leisure and
economic development -- as well as a further two departments of Lothian
Region -- education and social work.
When you move on to the national companies, like the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra which has been receiving money from 49 local authorities, you
don't need to be too sceptical to agree that only a decision by central
government either to relax its rules about capping the new authorities
or to introduce some form of transitional relief will help things along
in the short term.
''There's going to have to be transitional relief otherwise there's
going to be a lot less activity,'' insists Mary Picken, arts officer of
the Scottish Trades Union Congress.''
The idea of transitional relief is not without precedent. In 1982 when
the Stodart report took away the obligation for regional councils to
support the arts to ease the transition of responsibility from region to
district, the Government gave a special grant of #600,000 to the
Scottish Arts Council.
Scottish Arts Council depute director Christine Hamilton does not
believe that the changes will result in revenue-funded companies going
to the wall, but she is concerned about a fall in output and in
particular about the effect on smaller and lower-profile organisations.
The SAC's advice has been to plan carefully and to assume that funding
will be, at best, maintained at this year's level.
''Next year might not be the most exciting in terms of arts
development,'' predicts Hamilton. She emphasises that in all her
dealings with representatives of new authorities the political will is
not lacking. One arts officer told them they were ''pushing at an open
door'', an attitude that reflects the widespread acceptance that the
arts have an important place in local authority provision of services.
If that is encouraging, it is no guarantee that the transition will be
smooth. ''If you shake the main pillars of support, there's a very real
danger that the whole edifice will collapse,'' warned Scottish Arts
Council director Seona Reid at a recent conference in Perth about the
effect of reorganisation on the arts.
She went on to say that Government ministers were aware of the threat
to the arts, though she had been given no indication about what that
awareness might mean in practice. She did, however, welcome the
opportunity to standardise and simplify local-government funding
structures across the country, and had been active in encouraging the
adoption of a unified arts strategy.
That would indeed be welcome, but many feel that long before the
strategies and policies get drawn up, the most pressing need is going to
be for money -- just to keep the existing companies and artists going.

Despite Saddam Hussein's referendum, a man called 'uncle' is still
striving for Kurdish justice. Gareth Smyth reports
MILLIONS of Kurds know him affectionately as ''mam (uncle) Jalal''.
But surviving in Iraqi politics requires steel, and Kurdish leader Jalal
Talabani has ridden its ebb and flow for a long time.
In a brief, private visit to Britain in the aftermath of Saddam
Hussein's staged referendum, Talabani insists the Iraqi President is
''very weak, and totally isolated from the Iraqi people''.
But the lines on the 62-year-old brow are deepening. Talabani's
struggle for Kurdish rights has brought him periods of exile, of
organising guerrillas within Iraq, and of manoeuvring for international
support in a world where the Kurds have had few friends.
It seems a long time since, at the end of the Gulf War and before the
West established ''safe havens'', Talabani was photographed kissing
Saddam Hussein as he tried to reach an agreement with the Iraqi dictator
in Baghdad. The televised kiss was interplayed on Western TV screens
with pictures of thousands of Kurds fleeing from Saddam across the
mountains into Turkey and Iran.
The Kurds were in a very weak position, Talabani recalls, and his
greeting was no more than is traditional in the Middle East. Today ''mam
Jalal'' insists the Kurds will not find justice while Saddam remains in
power and must work alongside other Iraqis to overthrow him.
''The main task is to rescue Iraq, to liberate Baghdad,'' he says.
''This is the key to solving the problems we face in Kurdistan.''
Never has Talabani faced a situation laced like today's with such a
potent mixture of both opportunity and pitfall. Since the allies created
safe havens, Talabani has worked within the Kurdish-held zone in
northern Iraq. Here 3.5 million people live beyond Saddam's sway.
But not all is rosy. Since spring last year hundreds, perhaps
thousands, have died in armed clashes between the two main Kurdish
parties, Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Massoud
Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
Talabani concedes that overcoming this rivalry, and restoring the
authority of the Kurdish parliament elected in 1992, are top priorities.
Talks in Dublin in August called by the USA and in Tehran this month
show that ''both sides remain committed to solving problems though
dialogue'', he says.
The KDP has agreed to return to the parliament the customs revenue
levied on trucks between Turkey and government-controlled Iraq. The PUK
has promised to withdraw its forces from the regional capital Arbil,
which they captured during the fighting.
Making the agreement stick is another matter. Talabani seems prepared
to play off the United States and Iran against each other to improve the
Kurds' position. ''We will welcome anyone who will help to end the
conflict,'' he says mischievously.
Talabani is grateful to the United States, Britain and France for
continued military protection through the no-fly zone for Iraqi aircraft
north of the 36 parallel. But he is critical of what he sees as the
contradictions of United Nation sanctions which operate against the
whole of Iraq, including the Kurdish-held zone: ''We are the victims of
Saddam Hussein, yet we are suffering more than Saddam from sanctions.
(Unlike us) he can run his factories, and can gain spare parts through
different ways.'' Sanctions against the Kurdish zone should be lifted
''as soon as possible'', he says.
The West fears that applying sanctions in this way would further
divide the country, raising the nightmare scenario of Iraq -- a mosaic
of Kurds and Arabs, and Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims -- drifting into the
kind of sectarian chaos which raged in Lebanon during the 1980s or in
former Yugoslavia throughout the late 1990s.
''Many people are frightened that civil war will follow the collapse
of the dictatorship,'' says Talabani. But this should not fuel the
notion, beloved of US diplomats, that another ''strong man'', perhaps
from the Iraqi army, could ensure stability.
For Talabani, the opposition Iraqi National Congress (INC) -- which
the Kurds have supported since its foundation in 1992 -- offers the
possibility of a pluralist but united Iraq. ''The INC represents the
unity of Iraq. We have Kurds, Arabs, Sunnis, Shi'ites, Turkomen and
Assyrians.''
Keeping Iraq together, he says, involves recognising differences
through a federal, democratic structure: ''The dictatorship divided
Iraq. Federation has united countries, like Germany and the United
States.''
Talabani acknowledges the worries of Arab Sunnis, who have dominated
Iraqi politics since independence in the 1920s but who make up just one
in five of the population. Straight-forward majority rule, he concedes,
would not suit Iraq: ''A new system should recognise the rights of all
groups.''
This means regional government for the Kurds, and not their cherished
dream of independence. But then ''mam Jalal'' knows very well that
Kurdish politics has always been a matter of choosing something short of
the ideal.

OOR Alf's disadvantages in the 90s Diva Handicap Stakes are all too
obvious in the face of competitors who turn their hands to a spot of
modelling when invited by the glossies. But the lass can still knock
spots off many of the competitors when it comes to the voice. Ms Moyet's
is not a big soul voice or a sensual jazz voice, it is a showbiz voice,
and I'd put a substantial wad on her lasting the pace and beating her
rivals over the distance. If the recording career ever wanes, and this
packed house would suggest that's a long way off yet, the musical stage
beckons.
Which is probably why there was a false proscenium arch erected for
her performance (which for presumably sell-out reasons I found myself
sitting behind which had an odd effect on the sound, which I trust
others did not have to endure) and her band are a highly accomplished
showband. This was a pick'n'mix affair, largely ''unplugged'' in the
first half, with acoustic guitars, electric stand-up bass, Hammond
organ, and percussion, and leaning more towards a light rock vein in the
second.
She and the boys were better on the more stylised material. A smoky
rewrite of Kitty Lester's Love Letters led into a re-arranged All Cried
Out. If Love Resurrection was plodding, it didn't obliterate the memory
of a swampy Chain of Fools. Alf may do a fine Billie Holiday for Old
Devil Called Love, but aping Piaf for the first encore was probably a
mistake.

''D'YE ken the score wi' Rangers?'' somebody asked me as I wondered
home last night. I didn't, of course, but I nearly told him that I'd
just picked up a few new football chants from the splendidly named --
and vigorously bellowed -- You're Gonnae Have a Nasty Accident.
The show, written by Martin McCardie for the older members of West
Lothian Youth Theatre, is doing a short tour before representing the
home side in Stramash 95, the international youth drama festival opening
in Livingston this weekend.
A lively piece of contemporary agitprop, it throws up a load of
pertinent ideas about the nature of gang behaviour, football violence,
and adolescent alienation.
It rests on the pretty unlikely premise that a group of self-styled
outsiders might be coerced into setting themselves up as a gang of PC
vigilantes, punishing with violence anyone who breaks their right-on
code. People caught on the terraces spouting racist, sexist, or other
offensive language become marked men, getting cold-blooded beatings
after football passions have cooled.
The play's second unlikely premise is that the teenagers don't
immediately notice the contradiction of answering violence with
violence. But the thrust of McCardie's quick-footed script gives the
play a logic of its own, and what matters is not plausibility but the to
and fro of debate.
And in Raymond Branton's imaginative, elegantly choreographed
production, that debate is backed by a great, tough energy from the
eight-strong cast. Well drilled and tightly disciplined, they perform
the play like a musical score, choral chants making way for solo spots,
in a display of the kind of focused team work that the piece finally
celebrates in the beautiful gemme.

CHANCES are, whether you're a fan of limp-wristed fopp-mod or not,
your opinion of Menswear depends on your feelings regarding the current
''cheekbones over chord changes'' debate. Menswear supporters will argue
that the rise of the band from shop dummies to Top of the Pops regulars,
via unnervingly premature NME/Melody Maker front covers, is testament to
their remarkable chutzpah and charisma.
Cynics may suggest that the pub you drink in should not affect your
pop luck. Personally, I'm willing to let Menswear sing for themselves.
The first thing that strikes me about the band as they strut on stage
is that, despite the flashing sirens and pre-pubescent squeals which
greet them, they haven't an ounce of presence between them. Singer
Johnny pouts, preens, and minces across the floor but he has no real
aura of celebrity, no dazzle.
As for the music, the set begins with a diluted ''re-working'' (ahem)
of Pavement's Cut Your Hair, which leads on to a
''re-contextualisation'' of Aztec Camera's Oblivious, and so on. There's
no passion, sensitivity, or humour in Menswear music, or even on their
faces.

THE first genetic map, a blueprint of what makes humans really human,
has been published. It is the Genome Directory, which has been issued as
a supplement to Nature magazine. It is almost 400 pages long, is only
half done, contains errors, but is a major achievement -- a milestone in
the comprehension of how life generates and what makes it tick.
This is the first section of the world map of humans, an atlas that's
made up of a sizable chunk of the 100,000 or so human genes, and medical
experts all over the world believe it's a step on the road to finding
the genetic causes, and eventually the cures, of many killer diseases.
The Genome Directory is described as a map, most of it the work of a
French team of experts who are themselves part of a global effort to
unpick the knit and purl of the human animal. The full map will
hopefully chart the complete sequence. The aim of the genome project is
simple: to analyse and sequence all the DNA on all the human
chromosomes.
In America it is a huge money-spinner, costing $180m a year. Other
countries, and the European Union itself, now have their own programmes,
supported by charities, foundations, business, and government research
money. The project is vast. The budgets and urgency compare it to money
spent on space exploration.
The possibilities in the human project are enormous, as researchers
now try to pin down the genes associated with diseases including breast
cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and even obesity. By examining genetic
components to common ailments, major pharmaceutical companies could plug
into the rich markets of treatments.
The headlong pace of discovery since the launch of the genome project
has uncovered a staggering list of genetic disorders. Many cancers and
heart disease are thought to be genetically based, as are other human
predispositions, rightly or wrongly.
In July last year, US researchers claimed a possible genetic link with
male homosexuality. Scientists also claimed that shyness was
gene-related. Linguistics researchers and neuroscientists believe that
even grammar may have its basis in genetic instructions. Others have
variously claimed genes for aggression and for alcoholism.
A British team announced finding a gene responsible for the disease
that leads to kidney failure. Colleagues in Oxford tracked down genes
which could cause childhood diabetes. Recently British and American
researchers found a genetic scapegoat responsible for a form of
inherited breast cancer.
But the search for the ultimate basis of human beings is not without
its attendant problems. Walter Bodmer, the director-general of the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund, and a former director of the
international human genome project, says that new laws may be needed to
stop employers misusing genetic data to select or sack employees.
The only exception, he suggests, should be cases such as colour
blindness and commercial flying, where a particular genetic difference
may be coupled to a particular job or category of employment. In
America, however some companies have taken advantage of genetic research
to try to ensure that employees have only ''healthy'' genes.
Under equal opportunity legislation, welcomed by present genome
project director Francis Collins, this has now been declared illegal.
Because genetic markers have been found for such diseases as
Huntington's chorea, or that predispose people to conditions such as
colon cancer, workers were at risk from employers weeding out
potentially costly -- and sickly -- employees for whom they have taken
insurance or agreed to pay health-care costs. To avoid hiring people
with ''disease genes'', some companies ask job applicants about their
family medical histories or ask for samples of blood or cell tissue
without revealing that they will be used for genetic tests.
Even in the UK, often slow to act against perceived business
interests, the Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology has
heard concerns voiced by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics on the need
to regulate genetic testing and screening. The council also called for
the insurance industry not to pry into the results of people's genetic
tests. Last month, the Association of British Insurers told the select
committee it wants to see all results.
There are deeper fears and bigger ethical problems. In Maryland,
protesters disrupted a meeting held to debate whether the roots of
violent and criminal behaviour can be traced to a person's genes. The
meeting was sponsored by the National Institute of Health as part of its
programme to examine the ethical issues generated by the human genome
project. It brought researchers, who believe their work shows that genes
can lead to violent or criminal behaviour, face to face with their
critics who are worried about the political uses to which such findings
might be put and claim the knowledge and the technology would be used
for genocide if the very concept is accepted.
The fears were not allayed by allegations that mental health officials
were planning to test inner-city schoolchildren -- most of whom are
black -- for genetic markers that might predispose them to violence.
Since all African Americans then would have the genetic markers for
black skin, wrong assumptions can be made.
The ethical considerations also stretch to cover the lucrative market
on human gene patents. Any pharmaceutical company that has control over
the knowledge of genes for major common diseases is assured vast
profits. Earlier this year the House of Commons Select Committee on
Science and Technology considered this very point.
Alastair Kent, director of the Genetic Interest Group (GIG), opposed
the trend towards the patenting of human genes as intrinsically wrong to
have a patent on something that is part of a person. One major company,
Merck Sharp and Dohme, says it will publish the details of the gene
sequences its researchers isolate, thus preventing anyone from claiming
patent rights. But others are in partnership with biotechnology
companies, and plan to patent as much as they can.
Professor Sheila McLean of Glasgow University told the committee that
urgent laws are needed to cope with the ethical questions on
individuals' rights to medical privacy and access to insurance. She said
the speed with which research into the human body's genetic structure is
advancing makes setting up a legal framework a matter of urgency.
The speed of research accelerates. The first, partially completed map
of the human genome, published by Nature magazine is a major step along
the way to discovering the set of amino acids, markers and messengers in
the complete kit-book for a human.
Somewhere down the line they might find the gene that makes humans do
exactly what some people are concerned about: profiting from misfortune;
preying on the weak; discriminating against the different. Conversely,
they may find the gene for altruism that bravely combats the human
condition.

Footballer Brian Irvine has achieved his first goal in his battle
against multiple sclerosis, as Graeme Smith reports
WHEN Aberdeen and Scotland defender Brian Irvine ran out on to
Dingwall's rain-swept Victoria Park to play 45 minutes of football this
week he sent a message of hope throughout the country.
Three months ago the 30-year-old Pittodrie favourite stood in front of
the Aberdeen home he shares with his wife Donna and their daughters
Hannah, four, and Christina, 10 months, and announced to the gathered
press that he was suffering from multiple sclerosis.
There were few among them, or who read their articles the following
day, who were in any doubt that an illustrious career had ended. Even
assurances by the club doctor, Derek Gray, and manager Roy Aitken that
they were confident he would resume his playing career were not enough
to convince many.
Irvine was clearly emotional as he apologised for being unable to
raise a smile but he said: ''I am in positive frame of mind and I am in
the recovery process. I hope you will all be there to cheer me when I
come back for my first game.''
When he ran out for the second half of the match against Ross County
in a game to open their new stand, Irvine swept aside the doubts about
his own future and many of the myths surrounding multiple sclerosis. The
return was as Dr Gray had predicted and he hopes that the ''fairy-tale
ending'' will come in just a few weeks with a return to first-team
contention.
''MS is a disease where there are periods of activity and periods of
remission and with the pattern of Brian's type we expected he would
totally recover from his first episode and be able to return to play
football.
''There is a wide spectrum of MS from the type Brian has to a
fortunately very much rarer type which is rather more aggressive. Many
people, when they find out they have the illness, believe it will mean
they will end up in a wheelchair within months and Brian's return to
playing may help make it clear that is not the case.
''Most people can lead a very, very reasonable quality of life. ''I
have patients who have had one episode and have never had a second.''
Multiple sclerosis is known to strike around one person in 1000
although for some inexplicable reason it is more prevalent in the
North-east of Scotland where twice as many may be affected is in the UK
on average. However, that is unlikely to have any significance in
Irvine's case because he was born and brought up in Lanarkshire and it
is in his early years the illness may have been rooted.
Only a minority of victims rapidly progress from the onset of
disability to death with the cause of death being a vulnerability to
illnesses like pneumonia rather than MS itself which does not kill.
There may actually be many sufferers of mild MS who are unaware they
have the illness. Brian Irvine's MS was diagnosed after the 6ft 2in,
13-stone, 30-year-old suffered a back injury during the close season and
he experienced a persistent tingling down the back of a leg.
Experts say that minor symptoms could easily be ignored by people in
less physically demanding professions. However, there is nothing to
suggest that continuing to play football will exacerbate his condition.
Irvine prefers not to discuss the condition publicly. ''He says he
wants to do his talking on the pitch,'' said manager Roy Aitken. ''Since
it was explained at the start I have had no doubts that he would return.
We had the game against Ross County earmarked as a possible return date
and he came in this morning with no ill effects so we are now looking at
him playing a reserve game on Thursday.''
Aitken said that it was now a question of him reaching match fitness
to be in contention for a first-team place. ''He is about two months
behind the rest of the boys,'' he added. ''His progress over the past
month has been good and he has been in full training with the first team
for the past two weeks.
''He has now done his pre-season stamina work and has the base to work
from and it normally takes three, four or five games to get match fit.''
Irvine has established something of a reputation for scoring goals for
his club when it most matters. Against Ross County with four minutes to
go he rose to head a cross into the back of the net for the Dons sixth
of the night, for his first of the season, and for one of the most
significant goals scored in Scottish football.

PHIL PENFOLD finds it worth the wait to meet Hollywood's newest and
down-to-earth teenage starlet
THEY'VE dubbed her ''the queen of the nineties Lolita culture''. She's
made the covers of Vanity Fair, is the object of the Internet's more
ardent on-line fan club, and she's just received a cool $10m from
Columbia Pictures to do whatever she pleases in her next two movies.
Alicia Silverstone was 19 just a few days ago on October 4. She is
also running 45 minutes late for our interview and on arrival doesn't
bother apologising. Although you might feel a little bit angry at
sitting around kicking your heels waiting for a teenage starlet any
annoyance goes out the window when Alicia starts talking. She's
completely frank, honest and disarming.
She's also blonde, beautiful and very svelte. Miss Silverstone is
almost precociously pert and as sharp as a well-honed razor.
Born in San Francisco to a Scots air-hostess mother (''I have really
no idea where in Scotland she was born, but she's always going on about
it'') and an English dad who is a real-estate agent, Alicia started
acting at age 12, and has now made nine movies including a sexy
thriller, The Crush. But her breakthrough came this year with Clueless,
in which she plays a Beverly Hills rich kid who unexpectedly turns out
to have a heart of gold.
It set the American box office alight, and to promote the opening in
the UK, Alicia has turned up in town. ''I seem to be on aeroplanes all
the time and that means I'm just fast asleep.''
She says that most of that $10m ''will go in taxes and I'll end up
with about 20% of the rest. My mom and I would love to provide an animal
foundation and I also want to buy a house with a yard so that I can have
a lot of animals roaming around.
''I've never ever known who was in the charts or the movies because,
unlike the character I play in Clueless, I've never really had any
interest in keeping ahead or level with the pack. The only person I've
ever admired was Olivia Newton-John because I thought she was my mother!
In the job mom was in she was always away, and at the age of four the
facts kinda seemed to fit in.''
She says that at the moment she's ''in the education of life''.
''There's so much out there that I have to learn about. I know very
clearly who my friends are and I knew I wasn't going to find them in
school. So I missed out on something of an education. But now I have the
opportunity to soak these things up and act like intellectual blotting
paper.''
But this is the girl, surely, who was in the middle of a
much-publicised court case when, at 18, she applied to be
''emancipated'' from her parents so that she could work longer hours at
the studio?
Alicia agrees. And explains that the legal process, done with the full
approval of both her parents, was merely so that she could work harder
at her chosen career. ''It meant that out of nine hours work at the
studio I didn't have to spend three hours of that studying,'' she says.
And then she says: ''I have the most down-to-earth mother in the
world. She gives me love, honesty and reliability. She gives me values.
She taught me all that. The energy from her is amazing.
''And the character I play in Clueless couldn't be further from what
she really is or from what I am. Cher is materialistic and shallow. And
I admit at first sight she's superficial, snobby and self-absorbed. As
well as arrogant. But then you find she does have a very generous
heart.''
Stardom, says Alicia, has not gone to her head. ''Being a high-paid
actress has no effect on the fear, the terror, of knowing that I may
never aspire to do what I want to do. Or want to be. Daniel Day Lewis,
Sean Penn. I admire them. But they don't write roles like that for
women, they really don't. Nicole Kidman, I admire her. And Jodie Foster
-- but they're strong women getting strong roles.
''It's terrifying being billed as a star because I still don't know if
I can fulfill people's expectations.''
Her next movie will be a project called Excess Baggage and it will be
under the banner of her own production company, First Kiss.

NEW RELEASES
Nine Months (12) directed by Chris Columbus.
Clueless (12) directed by Amy Heckerling.
On general release.
The Big Sleep (PG) directed by Howard Hakes.
Filmhouse, Edinburgh.
All films open tomorrow.
Hard lines: Alicia Silverstone is divine as the brat who has
brainwaves.
William Russell compares two comedies and finds that the new kids on
the block outclass the latecomers
HE'S de-licious, de-lectable, de-lirious, de-lovely, de-limit, and
much, much more. In the circumstances we will not pursue that line of
thought to its logical conclusion. The ''He'' is, of course, Hugh Grant,
the actor with the goofy grin and that forelock which will keep falling
into his eyes, who has emerged as Britain's latest copper-bottomed
internationally known film star.
The last male one of that ilk was probably Michael Caine. Sir Anthony
Hopkins is more an actor than a star, Daniel Day Lewis never quite makes
up his mind about what he wants to be, it is far too early to decide
about Ralph Fiennes, and, when it comes to the women, one is never quite
sure whether Emma Thomson, despite that Oscar, is not a bit of an Esther
Williams, who was a star only when wet.
As for what Hugh is being delectable and all the rest in, it is Nine
Months, the $35m Hollywood comedy, his first American film, whose
release in Britain was delayed for months for reasons we will not go
into. The trouble about the delay is it now comes out in the same week
as an infinitely funnier film, Amy Heckerling's comedy, Clueless, about
rich Beverly Hills school girls who shop until they drop.
But more about that later on. First of all, how has the man, who
seemed fated at one time to end up being known as Mr Elizabeth Hurley,
fared in his first Hollywood role? It has to be said that Hollywood
knows how to make a man look good and he has never been lovelier.
He has also been surrounded by good people like Julianne Moore, Tom
Arnold, Joan Cusack, Jeff Goldblum and Robin Williams, so there is no
question of his having to carry this particular baby alone. As for the
director and writer, he is Chris Columbus, who made the Home Alone
movies and Mrs Doubtfire, which helps, while the film on which it is
based was a French success called Neuf Mois so they were not exactly
starting from scratch.
Samuel (Grant), a child psychologist, British of course, since Hugh
cannot really do American, has been living happily in San Francisco with
his girlfriend Rebecca (Moore) for five years. Then one day she reveals
she is pregnant, after which Samuel goes through hell as every
conceivable joke about what a baby can do to a man's life is cracked.
His scarlet Porsche looks like being the first casualty -- no room for
a baby seat there -- and things get frantic after Rebecca's
obstetrician, a Russian emigre played by Robin Williams, turns out to
have more experience as a vet.
Hugh does his familiar comic routine -- all those little nervous
facial tics and self-deprecating gestures are there in abundance -- and
Moore does her best in a thankless part, although less so than her other
current role in the thriller, Assassins. It is all very predictable,
sentimental and glossy with an outcome -- Samuel realises that
fatherhood is wonderful after all, exchanges the Porsche for a fanmily
car, and commits himself to Rebecca at the altar -- never in doubt.
On this evidence Grant's Hollywood career should continue to flourish.
Although by no means a top-drawer comedy, even by Chris Columbus's
standards, it is not, as rumour had it, the worst movie to come out of
Hollywood since 9[1/2] Weeks. Beside the utterly delightful, delicious
and delectable Clueless, however, it fails to sparkle.
Cher Hamilton (the divine Alicia Silverstone) lives in Beverly Hills
with her bad-tempered father, Mel (Dan Hedaya), a corporate lawyer who
is between wives. She runs her life, his life, and the lives of her
high-school friends with a ruthlessness that has to be admired, using
her skills as a persuader to get her own way when her academic talents,
which are limited, let her down.
Her wardrobe is so vast she has it all filed on her computer which she
consults when deciding what to wear. She may not be academically
brilliant, but she is bright enough for her own ends and she knows how
to get them. Nor is she stupid.
There is a lovely moment when Cher demolishes a pretentious college
girl who wrongly quotes Hamlet, and is sniffily dismissive when told she
is wrong. She knows her Hamlet, she sneers. Cher smiles and says that
may be so, but, whatever the other girl might think, Mel Gibson did not
say those lines -- it was Polonius.
Her favourite pursuit is making people over, turning them into what
she considers to be cool -- ''clueless'' stands for ''uncool'' -- and
her comeuppance occurs when she decides to do this favour for her new
school friend, Tai (Brittany Murphy), who has no dress sense and lacks a
boyfriend.
Cher does not go out with high-school boys -- they are too young, too
messy and is waiting for Mr Right -- and decides that the right boy for
Tai is the school snob, Elton. It all goes horribly wrong after Elton
makes a play for Cher instead, leaving her, when rebuffed, to be mugged
at a filling station. It is typical that the only thing Cher worries
about, as the mugger takes her purse and mobile phone, is what is going
to happen to her dress when he tells her to lie down on the wet
forecourt.
In the process of the makeover Tai demonstrates she is no pushover,
let alone a loser, and Cher discovers that she too can become clueless.
Alicia Silverstone, all sugar and spice with a core of steel, manages to
make a genuinely spoilt brat sympathetic.
Cher does have a heart, which she eventually loses to Josh,
law-student son of one of her father's ex-wives, who has come to spend
the holidays and do some work for his stepfather on the side. And she
does learn lessons from the things that happen to her.
The plot is allegedly based on Jane Austin's Emma, although the
parallels escaped me. The best thing to do, instead of seeking them out,
is sit back and enjoy a witty, sharply-drawn portrait of high-school
society in which learning comes last and shopping comes first.
Heckerling has done a first-rate job both as writer and director, and
has extracted from Silverstone, Murphy, Stacey Dash as Cher's best
friend (naturally called Dionne) and the rest of a young cast,
performances of great assurance.
Television has done the cinema good service, but it does diminish
films, so a chance to see Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep on the big screen
in a brand-new print is not to be missed. The photography by Sid Hickox
is superb. Black and white films somehow left much more to the
imagination and also allowed far more visual creativity than colour
allows. So it looks great.
It also sounds great having a witty and tautly-written script. Bogart
and Bacall, at the peak of their careers, are terrific and divine
respectively, and there is a supporting cast to die for, including an
incredibly sexy Dorthy Malone as the bespectacled owner of a bookshop
who when Marlow comes to call, removes them, pulls down the blinds, and
takes the afternoon off. So should you.

TOM JOHNSTON provided his services as Regional Commissioner for Civil
Defence at no charge to the state. It was an example followed by all the
district commissioners and their deputies.
In fact, as Johnston later noted, only one in 13 Civil Defence workers
in Scotland accepted payment for their services and sacrifices during
the war. Between 1939 and 1940 there was ''greater community of feeling
and greater goodwill among ourselves than probably at any time in our
history'', Johnston maintained.
There was no limit to the ''urgent and sticky problems'' he was
expected to solve during the 17 months he spent as Regional Commissioner
for Scotland. These ranged from finding billets and transport for
thousands of mothers and children evacuated from crowded industrial
areas to billets in the country at the height of the bombing threat, to
ensuring the safety of the Scottish Crown regalia and jewels.
The precious regalia were finally built into the wall of Edinburgh
Castle. Only four men knew their exact whereabouts. ''I often
wondered,'' mused Johnston, ''what would happen had a bomb hit the four
of us. The chances were that the regalia might have been lost until
Judgment Day.''
On another occasion Johnston was endeavouring to find a safe hiding
place for thousands of gallons of whisky.
The whisky didn't pose any kind of threat to the Regional
Commissioner's teetotal habits. But it was a potential fire hazard if
stored in a major area of population. It was also a valuable export,
worth millions of dollars in the United States, and as such an asset
nobody wanted to lose.
An attempt to bury the precious amber liquid deep beneath the surface
of the earth, in a disused lead mine at Wanlockhead, was rebuffed by
Customs and Excise. The men in starched shirts were probably right to
worry that although the whisky might be safe from enemy bombers, it was
unlikely to survive inquiry from foraging packs of British citizenry if
ever news of its whereabouts leaked out.
Johnston finally ordered one huge load, valued at #1m, to the United
States for sale, or safekeeping. A ship was found, the SS Politician,
with sufficient space in its hold to accommodate the additional cargo. A
route to the Atlantic was planned by way of The Minch. And it was there,
in thick fog, that the SS Politician ran aground on the tiny island of
Eriskay.
Unlike the teetoal Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence in faraway
Edinburgh, the people of Eriskay and neighbouring Barra were happy to
accept a drop of the hard stuff occasionally. But especially if it came
their way free, in thousands of cases, compliments of the Government.
Sir Compton Mackenzie, who immortalised the incident in his novel
Whisky Galore, treasured the reaction of important visitors from the
mainland when they entered his house on Barra and ''saw the bottles of
whisky in a long row all around the top of the bookshelves''.
One such important guest was Tom Johnston, who visited Barra not long
after the loss of the SS Politician. Johnston declined his host's offer
of whisky but said he would drink half a glass of sherry.
''I'm sorry you won't sample some of our whisky,'' an amused Sir
Compton Mackenzie reported himself as saying at the time. ''After all
you are the man we have to thank for giving us whisky galore.''
His guest was entitled to feel perplexed. The famous author enjoyed
the moment. ''Tom Johnston looked at the bottles of whisky round the top
of the bookshelves,'' Sir Compton recalled, in My Life and Times, ''and
then quickly swallowed that half glass of sherry as if it were
firewater.''

Russell Galbraith explains how Johnston became the father of the
Scottish tourist industry:
LATE in 1945 the Scottish Tourist Board was created, with Johnston,
who was no longer an MP, as chairman. There was the one firm and
inflexible condition he applied to his appointment -- ''that we would
raise all our funds inside Scotland''.
''No more handing over to London any share of the moneys we raised in
Scotland for Scottish tourism,'' he added. ''We would be independent in
name and in reality.''
His aim was an association which, predominantly, represented
consumers. He wanted to develop the country and open up the show places
for the benefit of everyone, ''the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and
the plutocrats as well,'' Johnston explained.
Cheap package holidays to exotic-sounding locations in faraway
countries didn't exist. Clyde coast towns, like Rothesay, Dunoon and
Largs, competed fiercely with east coast havens such as Portobello,
Dunbar and Arbroath for the bulk of the annual family holiday trade.
A register was compiled of the various types of holiday accommodation
available in Scotland. Local authorities were encouraged to improve the
standard of houses which could be used to support the bed and breakfast
trade in rural areas. Guidebooks were commissioned and information
bureaux established in different parts of the country. Hotels and
boarding-houses were encouraged to improve their catering standards and
feature native produce.
Contact was also developed with a wide variety of Scots societies
overseas. Johnston was fond of claiming there were 20 million people of
Scots descent living outside Scotland.
''Who, having experienced it, can ever forget the overpowering
intensity of the Scottishness in the gatherings of our folk from
Calcutta to Chicago?'' he inquired.
His own strong streak of kailyard sentiment encouraged the belief
that, with its nostalgia for the old birthplace, this greater Scotland
beyond the seas was a fact of some importance in the world. ''Folly
beyond words not to do all in our power to tighten the bands of racial
fraternity, and to attract the exiles back to holiday in the land of
their birth, or whence their forbears sprang!'' he claimed.
By 1950 it was estimated that 40 per cent of the 240,281 foreign
tourists who arrived in Britain from countries outside Europe included
Scotland in their itinerary. More than 65,000 people were employed in
the tourist trade. According to Johnston ''the Scottish economy benefits
to the extent of #12.8 million, excluding shares of summer lettings,
railway transport, catering and merchandise sales.''
But then, as now, the railway authorities showed little regard for
Scotland. A decade before the Beeching axe destroyed the Scottish rail
network, and more than 40 years ahead of the latest threats to the West
Highland line and the west coast sleeper service, an information
bulletin issued jointly by the Scottish Tourist Board and the Tourist
Association of Scotland revealed: ''Proposals by the Railway Executive
to close certain branch lines and railway services in Scotland have been
causing the board and other authorities considerable concern.''
Johnston campaigned vigorously for the restoration of a transatlantic
shipping service between New York and the Clyde.
''It is intolerable that great ships should be built there, sail away
and never return,'' he complained. Following a meeting in New York an
unnamed English shipping magnate conceded he had made ''a splendid case,
but please not to forget that he was chairman of an English harbour
board''.
Characteristically, Johnston refused to take no for an answer. His
persistence was finally rewarded when the Donaldson Atlantic Company
introduced a transatlantic service, using the Lismoria and the
Laurentia, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company carried passengers
between the Clyde and St Lawrence aboard the aptly-named Empress of
Scotland.
There wasn't much he could do about the weather; except insist, with
the help of some carefully selected statistics, that it wasn't as bad as
people imagined. In the average year, for example, his chart showed the
sunniest place in Britain was the Inner Hebrides and not, as many people
imagined, the south-east coast of England.
Another negative factor, counting against Scotland ever becoming a
major world tourist attraction, was the irksome presence of the dreaded
midge. Tom Johnston was horrified to learn Scotland harboured 155
different kinds of midge.
Midges didn't exist in Patagonia or New Zealand, he discovered: why
was their presence tolerated in Scotland? At the very least, Johnston
wanted effective lotions made available at reasonable prices, and
without further delay.
His anti-midge campaign earned him an accolade from The Glasgow
Herald. A leading article suggested his respect for the midge marked him
''as a man who, having set Scotland's peculiar problems in the right
perspective, is determined to mend matters''.
Demonstrating its own sure grasp of the seriousness of the problem
Johnston now confronted, the Herald added: ''He will earn his monument
if he adds no more personal achievement than the eradication of the
midge which since the wolf went has been the only voracious creature
with which the southron visitor could not cope unaided.''
Johnston continued as chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board for more
than nine years. His decision to resign was made after he had been
''pressed by the Prime Minister and others to accept a new part-time
sphere of activity''. At a dinner in his honour, held in Edinburgh in
January 1955, Johnston claimed tourism now contributed #51million a year
to the Scottish economy. In his last year as chairman of the STB the
number of visitors to Scotland exceeded 300,000. Measured in terms of
employment it was already the sixth largest industry in the country.
''We have kept clear of partisan politics,'' said Johnston. ''We have
kept clear of group formation. We have kept clear of dependence on
grants in aid and subsidies from the trade. We are all proud of the
success so far and I am sure the future has even greater successes in
store.''

Q: Is there any point in using that anti-baldness drug which I have
seen advertised?
A: Yes -- for some men. It's thought that around 40% of receding males
derive some benefit from it.
Unfortunately you can't tell whether it will work for you without
giving it a try over a period of several months. And that's costly --
because you'll need to pay the chemist about #30 per month for your
supplies (pharmacists vary slightly in what they charge).
Personally, I've been applying the drug -- which is called ''Regaine''
-- to my thinning brow for several years. And in my case it does seem to
have ''stopped the rot'' somewhat!
But I assure you: it won't work for everybody.
Q: MY doctor has just told me I may have ''prostate trouble'', but I
don't understand what the prostate is, or what it does. Please explain.
A: I promised I'd return to the subject of prostate trouble this week,
because there's so much of it around!
Amazingly, most men know very little about it. A recent survey showed
that only one in 10 males has any idea where the prostate gland is. And
half of all men think that women have a prostate, too. (No, chaps --
they don't.)
Furthermore, a large chunk of the population believe that the gland is
called ''prostRate''. It isn't.
OK, so what does the prostate actually do? It's job in life is to
provide part of the sex fluid when a man climaxes.
And where is it? It's located below your bladder -- just behind the
central point of your pubic hair.
It's about the size of a large horse chestnut. Now, you know how
youngsters drill a hole through a conker; well, the prostate is just
like that -- it's got a precisely similar hole, straight through the
middle.
The vital point to appreciate is that all men have to pass water
through that tiny hole. That's no problem when you're young. But the sad
fact is that in every male over the age of about 50 the prostate gland
starts enlarging.
As you can imagine, this can easily cause difficulty in passing urine.
The ''stream'' may be poor, and there can be difficulty in ''getting
started''. Embarrassing dribbling may also occur.
Clearly, any reader who gets any of these symptoms should a doctor
without delay.
Q: Why do people make all this fuss about blood pressure?
I have raised blood pressure, but I feel perfectly well. Do I really
need to take the tablets which the doc prescribes for me?
A: It's recently been found that a lot of men have absolutely no
notion of the great dangers of having untreated high blood pressure.
It's like this. Blood is pumping through the blood-carrying tubes of
your body (your arteries) at a certain pressure. But if that pressure is
too great there's a risk that one of those tubes is going to burst.
So it's exactly like pumping water through a garden hose at too high a
pressure; after a while, the tubing may split. Alas, in human beings the
place where the split occurs is usually in the brain. Result: the person
takes a ''shock'' -- otherwise known as a stroke.
High blood pressure also increases the risk of heart attacks and other
troubles. So if you have a raised pressure, you most definitely do need
treatment to bring it down.
* If you have any query about your health, write to Dr David Delvin at
The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. Dr Delvin cannot reply in
person, but will try to respond in this column. Your name will not be
published.

NURSES may be worshipped when walking the wards, but if they fall they
are only broken-down angels. It's one of the many paradoxes of the
National Health Service that the caring it devotes to patients does not
extend to its own carers.
The workhorse mentality has been ingrained in the NHS since its
inception. Keep flogging the junior doctors and the ward sisters and
maybe dangle the occasional carrot, but bad backs and exhaustion are all
part of the job and never did matron or the medical dean any harm.
At least #3m of taxpayers' money is spent every year in Scotland
clearing up the human debris from accidents involving nurses. They
suffer far more back injuries than construction or factory workers.
Two separate accidents in September 1990 alone have now cost an
estimated #300,000 in public funds. They also wrecked the careers and
lives of two women.
Mary Jane Trainer was on a night shift at Ugie Hospital in Peterhead,
lifting a draw sheet to relieve pressure on a frail 83-year-old woman.
The threadbare sheet ripped and Mrs Trainer was thrown on to the floor,
striking her back and head. She has never worked since.
After two major operations on her back she is also unable to do
routine household tasks and her efforts to find a less taxing job fell
on deaf ears at Grampian Health Board.
''It was devastating in every respect, not just for me but for my
family. I am never without pain,'' she said. ''I had complained about
the state of the laundry and so had many of the day staff, but
management took no notice. It was never inspected and I believe today it
is still not inspected.
Trainer, now 62, of Tarves, Aberdeenshire, a registered nurse, was
also due to start a course to become a nurse teacher. She pursued a
civil action against the health board which it initially contested, only
to offer a settlement of #80,000 minutes before the case was due to be
called at the Court of Session.
''The money really was not an issue and once various bills had been
paid, there wasn't a great deal left. If they had said sorry at the very
beginning and shown a bit of compassion, a bit of understanding and kept
in touch, that would have spoken volumes. But nobody ever said sorry.''
Susan Medlam of Fife suffered similar injuries when she was helping to
move a patient. A widow, she had started in the NHS as a ward domestic,
then became an auxiliary nurse. She was awarded #60,200 damages against
Fife Health Board after Lord Osborne ruled that the board had failed to
give proper training.
Medlam, 48, of Huntly Drive, Glenrothes, had not been trained in
lifting patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, who are known to be
likely to fall or stumble because of their illness.
As well as the damages, the taxpayer pays for replacement staff, legal
representation for the health board, court expenses which can easily run
to #60,000 in a successful proof, in addition to a variety of state
benefits.
Both accidents could have been prevented for less than #40, the cost
of a reinforced draw sheet for Trainer and a training course for Medlam.
They were the lucky ones in at least having a claim capable of
proceeding to law. The majority of nurse injuries never get that far.
''We only see the tip of the iceberg,'' said Robert Carr, solicitor
for the Royal College of Nursing. ''In the past nurses did not claim for
this sort of thing because they thought it was part and parcel of the
job. Until about 20 years ago a nurse's back was perceived as an
occupational hazard.
''One of the terrible indictments of the health service is that those
who have cared for others are simply tossed on to the scrap heap when
they themselves sustain injury when handling patients.''
What irks him most is that most of the accidents are avoidable through
appropriate training, hoists, and other lifting equipment. Carr argues
that ignorance is no excuse for employers, given the rapid advances in
ergonomics and lifting techniques. He points to the example of some
trusts in England where manual lifting has been all but eliminated and a
typical 30-bed ward could be properly equipped for just #7000.
Matters should have improved since the introduction of European manual
handling regulations in 1993 and changes in NHS administration where
health and safety functions now clearly rest with individual trusts.
Solicitor Mary Biggam, who handles claims by Unison members, says the
evidence so far is mixed: ''It varies from trust to trust and the
measures they have taken. Some have reacted positively but we are still
getting cases where people are not being trained and are not getting
proper equipment.''
She should know. She was an intensive-care sister until 1990 before
taking up the law. Like many of her colleagues, she has residual back
pain, a legacy of lifting every type of patient, the frail, aggressive,
fat, obstinate, incontinent, or confused.
''Factory workers are never asked to lift the same type of load that
nurses are. The load they are lifting is totally unpredictable,'' she
said.
It is sometimes difficult to pursue specific claims when chronic
occupational back strain is so common. A further problem faced by Biggam
and Carr is gaining evidence from colleagues of injured nurses.
''We have a great deal of difficulty getting statements because these
people are so frightened of losing their jobs,'' she said.
The result is that social ostracism often accompanies the physical,
psychological, emotional, and familial damage of an accident on the
ward.
Carr finds the whole court process in this area wasteful and
unnecessary.
''I am a reluctant litigator. Frankly, it is work we could do without.
Each one of these accidents is a personal tragedy for the nurse involved
and also a huge waste of resources. It would be much better if these
resources were utilised in preventing injury in the first place.''
Meanwhile, back in Tarves and five years later, Trainer is still
waiting for her apology: ''The way I was treated was a disgrace and I
just hope things change so that other nurses do not have to go through
the same dreadful experience.''

POLICE in Lothian are working on a new lead which they hope will
provide a breakthrough in the hunt for the killer of a man stabbed to
death six months ago.
They revealed yesterday that a witness had come forward to reveal he
saw factory worker Robert Higgins, 35, of Dalmeny, near South
Queensferry, on the same day his body was discovered.
His body was found on May 1 in a disused quarry near Kirkliston by a
man who was out shooting.
The new witness saw the victim, who lived with his mother and was
known locally as ''the gentle giant'', at about 1.30am.
He was walking only half-a-mile from his home towards Dalmeny along a
footpath known as Lovers' Lane which links Dalmeny and South
Queensferry.
The previous last sighting of Mr Higgins was more than 14 hours
earlier, on the Sunday morning, in Morison Gardens, South Queensferry.
The witness also recalls seing a man and woman standing on a grass
area further east, in the direction of the Hewlett Packard factory on
the outskirts of South Queensferry. He has also reported seeing a man
walking eastwards on his own along the same footpath only minutes after
he spotted Mr Higgins.
The officer leading the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Douglas
Watson, described the new information as ''significant''.
He said: ''We have now traced Robert to half-a-mile from his home in
Dalmeny and the answer to this murder may lie in what happened in
Lovers' Lane that morning.''
He appealed to the three other people sighted by the witness and
others in the Dalmeny and South Queensferry communities to contact
police.

A MAN who went out leaving two small children in the care of a
13-year-old babysitter had charges against him found not proven
yesterday at Lerwick.
Sheriff Colin Scott Mackenzie said he had not the slightest doubt that
the professional man, who is in his 50s, had neglected the children,
aged two and six.
However, the sheriff said the babysitter had shown enough maturity to
cope and therefore found the case of neglect not proven.
For a case to be proven, it had to be demonstrated that the neglect
was likely to cause suffering or injury, and the presence of the
13-year-old girl had persuaded him that a sentence should not be passed.
Sheriff Mackenzie said the police were justified in bringing the case.
They had been called to a house after the six-year-old had called
emergency services when playing with the phone.
''What met the police's eyes was a scene of bad housekeeping on a
distressing scale. The place looked as if there had been a party the
previous night,'' said Sheriff Mackenzie.
The kitchen was piled high with unwashed crockery ''just waiting for
tiny fingers'' and there were opened, unfinished bottles of alcohol
lying around.
He warned: ''It should be noted that anyone who engages an underage
babysitter is taking a risk in the event of proceedings in court, that
the babysitter might not present such a mature manner as the current
one.''

<HEADLINE>Blow for Kvaerner Govan as company admits damage to Royal Navy assault vessel. Clyde launch holes #149m ship</HEADLINE>

THE Clyde's reputation for shipbuilding took a knock yesterday when it
was revealed that a vessel was holed during her launch ceremony at the
Kvaerner Govan yard.
The damage was caused last week when the Royal Navy's HMS Ocean, a
#149m helicopter assault ship, was entering the river. Her bow
apparently hit concrete under the slipway when supports collapsed.
Last night, yard managers admitted the incident had happened, but were
playing down the extent of necessary repairs to the 600ft ship.
However, the damage to Kvaerner's status is likely to be more
significant, especially at a time when the company is striving to find
orders to preserve the jobs of its 1200 workers.
The contract for the Ocean, worth #80m to Kvaerner, was the first for
a naval vessel at the yard since 1970, and was seen as an important
landmark for the Norwegian-owned company.
Last week's incident also comes embarrassingly soon after the fiasco
of the #4m offshore wave-power station Osprey, which had a hiccup at its
launch from UIE in Clydebank, and sank within weeks of being installed
in the Pentland Firth.
Senior managers at Kvaerner were not prepared to discuss the situation
in detail yesterday, and union leaders were not available for comment.
The company restricted itself to a statement issued through a
London-based public relations company. It said: ''HMS Ocean sustained
some damage during her launch. The hull was breached in one tank. A
temporary repair has already been effected.
''There is no immediate requirement to dock the ship. The damage will
be rectified during a dry docking of the ship at a convenient time. The
breach of the tank in no way had any effect on the ship's safety and
there was no requirement to pump out water to keep the ship afloat.''
It was reported that the HMS Ocean collided with a tug and its bow hit
the concrete under the slipway after supports collapsed.
''It was extremely hairy,'' said a witness. ''You don't want to see a
20,500-tonne ship out of control coming towards you.''
The Ministry of Defence later insisted that HMS Ocean had not clipped
a tug and Kvaerner Govan said that reports that the ship was out of
control during the launch were ''a wild fabrication''.
The main contractor on the Ocean is VSEL, which will fit out the ship
with all her military equipment at its Barrow-in-Furness yard in Cumbria
next year.
VSEL said in a statement: ''Ocean sustained some damage during her
launch at Kvaerner Govan on October 11. The extent of the damage is
currently being assessed and it will be rectified.
''It is hoped that the repairs can be accommodated within the existing
time-scale for completion of the vessel, although it is not possible to
make a firm prediction at this stage.''
Mr Kjell Mikalsen, Kvaerner Govan managing director, said at last
week's launch that the Ocean proved that ''it is possible to use modern
commercial shipbuilding technology to reduce defence costs''.
While there is no suggestion at this stage that the yard cut corners
to save money, his comments will ring hollow on Tyneside, since the
controversial decision to place the order for the ship with VSEL in May
1993 effectively sounded the death-knell for the Swan Hunter shipyard.
It required the contract to stay in business but its bid was
substantially higher than that of VSEL, leaving Ministers with no option
but to award the contract to the Barrow company, now owned by GEC.
The ship, to be based at Plymouth when she becomes operational, will
be able to transport a squadron of 12 assault helicopters, currently the
Sea King model.
In a crisis, the Government could deploy the carrier and ''poise''
offshore in the hope of persuading an aggressor to back down with just
the threat of force. But in an amphibious assault, commanders will be
able to launch marines and helicopters in simultaneous sea and airborne
operations.
In peacetime, the ship and its 250-strong Royal Navy crew will play a
key role in humanitarian operations, such as evacuations, floods, or
earthquake relief.

ABOUT 12% of the Scottish population are expected to see The Phantom
of the Opera in Edinburgh, which in hi-tech terms will outshine the
long-running London West End run.
Its massive fibre-glass elephant, an eye-catching prop in the
award-winning musical, has been safely installed inside Edinburgh's
Playhouse Theatre and is awaiting its cue.
Budgetary demands do not allow for it to be the target again for the
traffic warden brigade, one of whose members took exception to it
standing outside a top Manchester theatre some time ago and slapped a
ticket on it.
It has taken #1m and something like 28 40ft trailers to get Phantom to
the Playhouse, where it is now taking shape and on schedule for the
official November 1 opening.
''When you move the show, it's more akin to moving a small village
than a musical,'' according to production manager Kevin Eld.
The cast of 44, led by Broadway star Mark McKerracher, have been
rehearsing in London but have now travelled north for the final
preparations.0

STOCKHOLM: Prosecutors are to investigate credit card misuse by
Swedish Vice-Premier Mona Sahlin on suspicion that she may have
committed breach of trust and fraud. Before Sahlin's use of an official
charge card for private spending, which she later repaid, she was
favourite to succeed Ingvar Carlsson when he steps down as Prime
Minister and Social Democratic Party leader next March. Sahlin, 38, has
now withdrawn her candidacy but denies dishonesty.

HE DIDN'T see it coming; the first blow, the knife that flashed past
his face, the feet and fists crunching into flesh and bone. There had
been no sense of menace in the casual request for a cigarette as he
cruised the lawns and pathways of Glasgow's Queen's Park, but that warm
June night *Ronnie almost died for being gay.
''Somebody asked me for a cigarette and I said I don't smoke -- I
always say that as it's often an opening for something -- something like
trouble. They want to see how you reply. That's as far as I can
remember.
''When I got home I had a cracked skull. I was bleeding. My eye was
all bruised. I have a vague recollection, a sense that there was more
than one person because I felt somebody was in front of me and somebody
was behind.''
Ronnie was just the first victim of the young gang who had made their
way into the park on a queer-bashing spree that night. A short while
later they attacked a second man, then came across 35-year-old Michael
Doran and left him dying, every bone in his face and head shattered, his
body punctured with stab wounds.
These were not isolated incidents. The Herald understands that there
are several charges outstanding against individuals for assaults in the
Queen's Park area earlier this year. A source close to the case has
described them as being in ''a similar vein'' to the other incidents.
Youths who frequent the area say it was common knowledge that gays were
being attacked on a regular basis and that it was only a matter of time
before someone was killed.
''There's one guy who did it one night to get his taxi fare home,''
said one youth. ''You can beat the s**t out of them and they're not
going to tell are they? We knew this (murder) would happen one day. We
knew it would come to this. It was bound to.''
Yet a senior officer for Strathclyde Police F Division, which covers
the Queen's Park area, has dismissed the suggestion that there is a
problem or that it is time a gay liaison officer should be appointed.
Chief Superintendent Robert Jarvis told The Herald: ''We would first
have to be certain in our minds that we have a particular problem of gay
people being assaulted. We don't have information at the moment that
would suggest that . . . we are not aware of an identified problem of
gay people being assaulted.''
*Doug would disagree. He is gay and was attacked with his partner on a
bus in Shawlands last Thursday night, the second time he has been
assaulted this year. On both occasions, his assailants used belt
buckles. ''They seem to be in for the queer-bashers just now,'' says
Doug. ''Little effort. Lot of damage.'' He pulls back his fringe to show
a blood-encrusted, stitched gash on the hairline.
We met him on one of the shrub-shrouded pathways that cut across the
back of Queen's Park, facing on to a housing area known locally as ''Gay
Heights''. The light is fading and the park, a daytime haven for
dog-walkers, strollers, and elderly men sitting in quiet contemplation,
is starting to empty. Down by the main gate, a gaggle of youths, beer
cans clenched in their fists, are throwing contemptuous glances at
anyone who looks their way.
Doug is 30 and is wearily resigned to the risk of attack in Queen's
Park and the other gay meeting points across the city. ''They've been
going about mob-handed, groups of 12 or so, with two or three girls.''
The modus operandi is always the same: a quiet request for a cigarette,
a quick test of the muttered response for any trace of effeminacy, then
the belts or the bottles come out. Doug says it's been happening for
years with older attackers introducing younger ones to the ''sport''.
What disturbs him more these days, he says, is the way Strathclyde
Police are handling the issue.
''Take our own assault on Thursday. What most concerned me was the
manner of the policewoman, who repeatedly asked me: are you sure you
wish to make a formal report because we have been receiving conflicting
stories. I finally had to tell her: I formally require and request you
to make an official report on the attack on my partner and I. Have you
got that yet?''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said yesterday that there was a
record of two men complaining about an assault in Pollokshaws Road at
that time. ''It has been taken seriously. It has been recorded as an
assault and is being inquired into.''
Chief Superintendent Jarvis, meanwhile, has said the force has been
aware that there have been assaults in Queen's Park but were not aware
of any particular pattern over a lengthy period. ''We have responded
when assaults have taken place and increased patrols at the time. That's
our normal operating procedure.''
Doug thinks the latest attack against him was part of a retaliatory
foray against homosexuals for the jailing of four youths in the Michael
Doran murder, but he says assaults are all too commonplace and feelings
within the gay community are now running high.
''The feeling is that if we have one more death, we will have to take
the matter into our own hands, launching something like London's
Guardian Angels. Of course there's problems with the whole vigilante
thing, but something has to be done and the police are doing nothing.''
In Scotland and the rest of the UK, gay activists say violence against
homosexuals is on the increase and frustration at policing of the issue
is growing apace.
''The police nationally don't co-ordinate or collate any statistics so
we don't know the true scale of the problem,'' says Peter Tatchell of
the gay rights campaign group OutRage. ''But anecdotal evidence from the
reporting of homophobic assaults to individual police forces and to the
gay press suggests a significant increase UK-wide.''
One study to be released next month has found that almost two-thirds
of homosexuals have been bullied because of their sexuality. A separate
investigation found that about one-third of all lesbians and gay men
reported having been attacked at least once in their life and in many
cases several times.
''Transposed across Britain as a whole that would suggest about 1.5
million homosexuals have been beaten up because of their sexuality,''
said Tatchell. ''It does appear that as lesbians and gay men become more
visible and gain greater recognition and rights, a small backlash is
developing from entrenched bigots which is producing a rise in anti-gay
attacks.
''Sadly many police forces around the country don't seem to take
queer-bashing seriously. Only a handful of police forces bother to
monitor violence against lesbians and gay men, although every force now
monitors attacks on the black community.
''There was one survey recently in which most lesbians and gay men
said they would not report crimes of violence against them to the police
because they felt the police were at best unsympathetic and at worst
downright hostile to homosexuals.
''There is a lack of confidence in the police among many gay people
and there's an urgent priority for the police to start monitoring or
recording homophobic attacks so we can get an accurate picture of the
scale of the problem.''
In Scotland, gay activists have become so concerned at the growing
level of violence that they are planning to start collecting data
themselves. As with the rest of the UK, it is difficult to try and
pinpoint the number of assaults against homosexuals but it is generally
acknowledged that the problem is massively under-reported. In Glasgow
this year, there have been around 20 attacks reported to gay activists
but not to the authorities.
Glasgow-based gay rights campaigner and writer Garry Otton, who is
researching a book on the world of cruising, says those using spots like
Queen's Park are particularly vulnerable to attack and often can't come
forward.
''There's a feeling of fear, desperate fear, and anger and
powerlessness, because by and large they will not have come out. We're
talking about people in very high positions who can't afford to let it
be known that they are gay. They can't come out and they can't speak out
about the violence.
''The best thing Strathclyde Police could do is to appoint a gay
liaison officer. Not a puppet, but someone who has real clout, to liaise
with the gay community. Glasgow is the third-largest city in the UK,
European city of culture. It's got to boot prejudice out.''
While the Strathclyde force does not have an official gay liaison
officer, it does have two officers who have a responsiblity to establish
links with the gay community, including Detective Superintendent Phil
McDonald of A Division. DS McDonald says part of his brief is to address
issues affecting the gay community, but admits it is not a formal role.
''I suppose you could call me the gay liaison officer for the force
mainly because there are a lot of gay bars in this area,'' he said.
Across in Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders Police have had a gay liaison
officer for more than two years. The present incumbent is Detective
Inspector Willie Manson, who has established strong links with the gay
community but who admits that the role has it's own stigma.
''I'm the third one along the line and I took over a few months ago. I
think I'm the only one in Scotland . . . but it does carry it's own
prejudice within the force. I'm not gay. It's just purely a liaison
thing, getting a dialogue going.
''. . . We have got a large section of the community here and we have
got to listen to what they are saying. We must average a couple of gay
murders a year so it's handy for us to be able to have people we can
speak to. From our point of view if we had complaints about a specific
problem, it's our duty -- they are all taxpayers -- to take on whatever
problem is complained about. If there was a spate of gang attacks we
would put extra patrols out to tackle them.''
Despite the criticisms of the police, however, Ronnie -- who was
attacked the night Michael Doran died -- has no complaints about the way
he was treated after the assault.
''I could not say anything other than the police that dealt with me
were extremely nice and extremely friendly. It's an entirely new world
to them and I understand that. It's easy to criticise the police but
what can they do? They can't patrol the park day or night.''
He believes the problem lies more in the hard-man image still
cherished and cultivated in the West of Scotland. ''I think Glasgow is a
homophobic city. It just isn't the friendly city it's made out to be,
certainly not as far as gays are concerned. Glasgow seems to have this
attitude that gays are people to be got at.''
These days he tries not to think about what happened to him that
night, or to think about the people who left Michael Doran dying in the
bushes not far from where he himself was attacked.
''I've been going into the park for almost 30 years and you develop a
feeling when something just isn't right . . . it's just the noise or
lack of noise, just something that says: stop. But this time I had no
feelings at all. It was always considered risky, but I never came across
anything. But then nothing ever happens to you does it? It always
happens to someone else. I won't ever go into the park again. Not even
in daylight.''
*Names have been changed.
CONFESSIONS OF A YOUTH WHO LURED AND ATTACKED HOMOSEXUALS FOR THE
'BUZZ'
* THE MOTIVATIONS of those who attack homosexuals may be many and
varied. Some say it's prompted by fear about their own sexuality, others
that it's the casual violence of a mindless minority. *Thomas thought he
was doing it for money.
Young and rootless, his knowledge of homosexuality was a bi-product of
childhood abuse, macho uncles who dismissed his love of books as girlish
and the rent boys he mixed with. He felt he had two choices; sell
himself or attack others. He chose to attack.
''The first time I went into a gay bar and flirted with this guy. He
bought me drinks, brought me food. Later in a gay club he tried to kiss
me. I had to do it and I hated it. I hated him and I was embarrassed.
All these images of my uncles teasing me came back and I knew that I was
going to do him and embarrass him the way he did it to me.
''Outside the club we went to his car and I just grabbed him and
started to punch him and punch him. I was screaming at him. I left with
#60 of his money. I felt exhilarated. I felt like I had beaten his
sexuality, made him pay. I did it about five or six times, but it
escalated.
''One time I got the guy back to his flat and I pulled a kitchen
knife. I had to do more to get the buzz that I'd beaten them. Looking
back I have no doubt that if I had continued I would have killed
someone.''
The attacks took place more than five years ago and were never
reported. Today, Thomas, now in his mid-twenties, has moved home and
received counselling. Newspaper reports of the killing of Michael Doran
and the assaults on other members of the gay community have brought back
painful memories.
''I have to live with what I've done. I don't do it anymore. I read
reports in the papers about one of the attackers having an alcoholic
father, but at the end of the day there are no justifications, there are
only excuses.''

Where egos dare: balding can injure self-esteem and sends many men in
search an elusive solution. Ann Donald considers its delicate psychology
SLAPHEAD, Kojak, or plain old-fashioned baldy. The chances are by the
time 40% of males reach the age of 40 they will have had to endure these
ribald remarks. For the general public male hair loss has always been a
source of unrivalled fun -- Gregor Fisher's Baldy Man struggling with
his three strands of greased hair is a prime example, as is Richard
Wilson in One Foot in The Grave.
That is of course until you wake up one morning to find that a barber
has deposited the previous day's ''takings'' on your pillow. Then all of
a sudden those witty retorts about ''scrapeovers'' don't seem quite so
amusing.
It is unsurprising then that a recent report indicated a
disproportionate number of balding men suffered from lack of self-esteem
in comparison to those with a full head of glossy locks. The hair clinic
business too has mushroomed in recent years, packed out with leagues of
desperate people in search of that miracle cure that will revitalise or
reverse failing hair follicles.
But despite the numerous and often dubious small ads and miracle cures
boasting before and after photographs of Yul Bryner types transforming
into Mel Gibson's Wallace, the fact is, you will never have the same
head of hair, especially if the cause is male-pattern baldness.
Keith Hobbs, a consultant at the Scalp and Hair Hospital of the
Institute of Trichology in London explains that this type of hair loss
(also known as androgenic alopecia) is by far the most common but
unfortunately there is no known treatment.
''This is partly due to its hereditary nature being passed down by
both mother and father via the genes,'' he reports. ''We also think that
it's to do with the presence of the male hormone (or androgen)
testosterone running around the body and accelerating loss bilaterally
at the temples or at the top of the head.''
Another common cause is alopecia areata which can happen to both males
and females at any age and is often linked to stress, as Hobbs explains.
''This is termed an auto-immune problem and occurs when the body's
defence mechanism starts attacking itself and you get 50p-sized patches
of complete baldness.''
Fortunately this is usually a temporary state and regrowth is normal.
According to Hobbs, temporary hair loss can also be induced by
''traction'' -- due to plaits, hair-rollers or hair extensions pulling
on the hair follicle -- and abnormal thyroid function, anti-depressants
or betablockers, or in women during pregnancy.
Referring to the psychological side-effects of baldness in any form,
Hobbs is in agreement with the report's findings on balding men's lack
of self-esteem, having witnessed first-hand the reactions of many of his
clients who come to the institute for treatment.
''Most ladies would not realise just how much the young, balding man
is upset,'' he says. ''In order to keep their macho image they won't
admit their feelings. However, when they get here they open up heart and
soul. You'd be amazed what we get: tears, paranoia, and I know that two
or three of my patients have literally been suicidal even thinking that
they're losing their hair.''
George Theurer from A and A hair replacement systems in Edinburgh --
''nobody likes the term ''wig'' -- have been in business for 50 years.
Theurer is, however, highly critical of those commercial hair clinics he
views as preying upon the insecurities of balding men in a society that
places so much importance on physical appearance.
''Why do people go to Lourdes?'' he asks rhetorically -- ''Because
they hope and expect to be cured. In the same way you could meet a
perfectly sensible man who is a head of industry but when he goes to a
hair clinic he is thinking that he is the one in a thousand that they
can do something for.''
Apart from the hair replacement system which is still viewed by many
as the last stop, there are a clutch of products on the market
purporting to slow, reverse or halt hair loss. Judging from Keith Hobbs
and Theurer's experience many of these products appear to rely on
improved circulation to the scalp or act as psychological balms for the
users who want them to work and therefore become convinced of the their
worth.
Some of the most popular treatments include Silicium 44, Foltene and
Nuorkrin and Regain. The latter is also known as minoxidyl and was
hailed as a wonder drug when introduced in the late eighties, after it
was discovered that nominal hair gain was found to be a by-product when
the drug was given originally to reduce blood pressure.
Theurer gave it a two-year trial with his clients but has since ceased
recommending it because of poor results. ''Some patients said that it
stopped their hair loss -- which is very difficult to tell anyway -- and
others reported a fine growth of downy hair on the crown,'' he says of
the solution.
It has been shown to work on only 15%-20% of the population. ''But I
was worried, because you have to use it every day and if you stop using
it then your scalp can quickly reach the stage it would have been at if
you hadn't been using the treatment.''
Carol Walker, a consultant trichologist with the Birmingham Trichology
Institute, specialises in litigation, acting as an expert witness for
both plaintiff and defence in court cases where a hair product's
advertising claims are said to have misled the general public. She is
therefore familiar with most products on the market.
Having been part of a recent Cook Report TV programme where she
interviewed two individuals who had been conned out of #26,000 and
#29,000 respectively for so-called hair treatments she is also aware of
how desperate the general public are.
''They will do and try anything and a lot of these products are just
playing on people's imaginations by offering you something that you want
to hear but is not necessarily true.''
According to Walker, GPs need to be more sympathetic to the plight of
balding males rather than doling out condescension. ''If GPs sent people
for counselling and advice then they wouldn't be taken in by the
commercial sector,'' she says. ''I would also advise getting in touch
with the Institute of Trichology who are a recognised and registered
charitable body who were set up to not only further understanding of
hair and scalp problems from a scientific point of view but to give help
and advice.''
However, with a final damning and realistic note she says: ''They have
been looking for the elixir of hairgrowth since 500BC and they still
haven't found it. There are no cures and I really can't see there being
a cure-all in our liftime.''
It really would appear that the best measure is to face facts and go
bald in style.
* VINCENT JARVIS, 28, civil-servant -- ''When it first happens you
definitely think that there is something wrong with you and it can make
you very self-conscious if you concentrate on it. However, as you get
older you stop thinking about it and notice it less and less. One piece
of advice I'd give is: for God's sake never go for a flat cap or that
old man's swoop style (two strands swept over the crown).''
* JOHN MALPASS, 33, partner with DLC hairdressers -- ''For me,
personally, the idea is baloney but there are definitely people out
there who do suffer loss of self-esteem. My hairline started to recede
at 16 and by my mid-twenties I had male-pattern baldness. I did at that
point check out options from surgery to using minoxidyl. I used
minoxidyl for four years but eventually decided I was fooling myself and
cut it all off. The best thing you can do is face up to it and don't try
to conceal it. If you cut your hair short then it gives the illusion of
thickness rather than being long and stringy. Another idea is to make
good use of facial hair.''
* ROBERT TURNBULL, 58, co-manager of jewellery shop -- ''My hair
started to recede badly when I was in my late twenties and now it's
completely bald on top. It bothered me then because you still want to be
seen as attractive, but now it's fine and my wife thinks I look
especially good when I've got a tan. I think that lack of self-esteem
only occurs if someone's personality is such that they're prone to a
lack of confidence.''

A NEW grant-support scheme to encourage repertory theatres to share
their work with other areas was announced in London yesterday.
The #2.5m scheme is funded by Barclay's Bank and the Arts Council of
England. They are providing #1m each, with Barclays contributing a
further #500,000 for tours in Scotland and Wales and an annual showcase
of work at London's Old Vic theatre.
At a champagne breakfast at the theatreland restaurant, The Ivy,
Barclay's Stage Partners was launched by Heritage Secretary Virginia
Bottomley and Arts Council chairman Lord Gowrie.
The fund is an extension to the bank's New Stages scheme and is aimed
specifically at increasing the variety of regional touring theatre.
It encourages formation of partnerships of three or more theatres to
help tour a production and will run initially for three years. At least
two theatres in the partnerships must be based in England.
Barclays chairman Andrew Buxton said the scheme would meet the needs
of regional customers and ''support the creation of new productions''.
Mrs Bottomley welcomed the initiative as a way of involving ordinary
people in an art-form ''fundamental to the nature of the society in
which we live''.
''This is excellent news for British theatre. It delivers an important
benefit to theatres across the country and, most importantly, to the
paying public,'' she said.
Lord Gowrie praised it as offering ''more access and wider choice to
audiences -- there's no shortage of talent in the regions, only a limit
on resources''.
Former Glasgow Tramway director Neil Wallace called the move ''a key
breakthrough, a milestone in funding practice''.
Ms Ruth McKenzie, admistrative director of Nottingham Playhouse, whose
production of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari comes to The Tramway in Glasgow
from November 14, called it ''straightforwardly good news''.
''Regional theatre isn't just as good as London's. We think it's
better. We look forward to sharing our work with other audiences,'' she
said.
She said the scheme is support and recognition for a trend that has
become obvious over the past few years.
She added: ''No single theatre would have the money to bring over
Russia's Mali Theatre, for example. But in conjunction with Newcastle,
Brighton, and Glasgow, in the future we can and will.''
In the past few weeks, there have been a series of announcements of
new schemes in areas that once might have been solely covered by Arts
Council subsidy.
Three weeks ago, Guinness plc in association with the National Theatre
announced their Guinness Ingenuity London #10,000 pub theatre award
scheme.
London's Drill Hall, the major venue for lesbian and gay work, has
just announced a #1000 play award, thanks to a joint deal from a lesbian
and gay newspapers and the Association for British Sponsorship in the
Arts.
The venue was on the point of closure due to lack of funding. Now the
Drill Hall's Julie Parker has secured sponsorship of #30,000 from The
Pink Paper and #30,000 from ABSA.

LABOUR'S Scottish health spokesman has pointed the finger at GP
fundholding and the internal market in the health service for some of
the financial problems that have hit the Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust.
As it emerged that contracts between the beleaguered ARHT, Grampian
Health Board, and GP fundholders have only just been agreed, more than
six months into the financial year, Mr John McAllion claimed that health
trusts ''were always liable to find themselves in trouble'' because of
their reliance on the internal market.
A spokesman for ARHT, which has just received #1m of emergency public
funding because of its financial problems, admitted yesterday that the
delay in negotiating the contracts had been a ''contributory factor'' in
the trust's financial crisis.
However, Dr Ivan Wisely, an Aberdeen-based GP who is chairman of the
commissioning and fundholding committee of the Scottish General Medical
Services Committee of the BMA, denied that fundholding was to blame for
the cash crisis.
The negotiations had become a protracted process because the GPs were
trying to get a better service for their patients, he said, in an area
where the trust had a virtual monopoly. Dr Wisely added that, since last
year, the trust had increased its prices by 10%.
Grampian Health Board blamed the technical and complex issues that had
arisen in the negotiations for the delays but added that normal cash
flow had been maintained throughout the process.
Nevertheless, the ARHT admitted that the uncertainty created by the
lengthy negotiations had contributed to planning and development
problems. The trust's spokesman also blamed rising costs and the demands
placed on an acute hospital for its financial crisis.
Meanwhile, Mr McAllion said he did not accept that the #1m given to
ARHT and #500,000 to the Highland Communities Trust in Inverness, via
their respective health boards, had been funded by a reimbursement by
the Scottish Office of a general health board underspend throughout
Scotland.
''We have to find out exactly where the money came from and why it was
allocated in the way in which it was. There are priorities right across
the health services in Scotland, including the nurses' pay award, which
all the trusts are having to fund from their own resources. Why was this
one picked out as a top priority?'' he said.
Mr Jim Devine predicted that many other health trusts would soon be
facing financial crises of their own.

GLASGOW MP Maria Fyfe has resigned from the Labour Scottish Front
Bench in advance of what is expected to be a wide-ranging reshuffle of
the junior ranks of Shadow Ministers, as leader Tony Blair fine-tunes
his team in preparation for a General Election.
Mrs Fyfe, who has served on the Front Bench for seven years, last
night denied she had been pushed and claimed she was unwilling to face
the demands of serving as a Government Minister should Labour win the
next election.
She said she chose to resign before the reshuffle, which is to follow
last night's Shadow Cabinet elections, to avoid speculation over the
reasons for her departure.
''I would not want to be confused with those changes,'' she said.
Mrs Fyfe was rumoured in some quarters to be vulnerable to a
reshuffle, and her decision will be taken by some as confirmation of the
fact. However, last night she denied she had been asked to stand down:
''No such suggestions were made.''
Instead, Mr Blair and Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson both
expressed regret at her decision, she said.
''It was purely my own decision. Labour is bound to win the election.
I would have anticipated being a Government Minister, but it's not a
life I want to lead. I'd rather be doing other things.''
Mrs Fyfe's departure leaves Dundee East MP John McAllion and Dumbarton
MP John McFall on the team with Mr Robertson. Neither is thought to be
at risk in the changes.
After Mrs Fyfe made her final Front Bench appearance yesterday during
Scottish Questions yesterday, Mr Robertson said: ''Maria has made a huge
contribution over the years to strengthening the party's position in
Scotland. Her experience and success have been invaluable in giving
Labour the consistently high position it has with the Scottish people.''

Brussels
FRENCH Government officials have handed over fresh scientific data on
the effects of nuclear testing in the South Pacific to the European
Commission, it was confirmed yesterday. The new information has not been
made public.
The move followed an ultimatum from the commission last week when it
insisted on receiving the data so that it could decide what action, if
any, to take about continued testing in the area.
Commission experts are now studying the data and will report to the
executive at a special meeting on Monday in Brussels when a decision
will be taken on whether to seek a legal injunction against France.
A commission official said: ''Yesterday we received a reply from
France after our letter was sent out following last week's commission
meeting. The commission will now be in a position to take a decision on
continuing this policy by 6pm on Monday at the latest.''
Commissioners will take a conclusive view on Monday about whether the
tests contravene the Euratom treaty. If they decide the law is being
broken by France, they could resort to the European Court of Justice and
seek an injunction. Such a move would cause a huge internal row in the
European Union.
If they decide to permit continued French testing, they will anger the
European Parliament, which has condemned President Jacques Chirac's
policy of renewing testing until next spring in defiance of world
condemnation. The parliament wants the tests stopped immediately.
Commissioners have been instructed by president Jacques Santer to keep
their findings secret on Monday night so that Euro-MPs can be informed
of their decision ahead of the world's media. Mr Santer will travel on
Tuesday to Strasbourg to report to the European Parliament during its
budget-fixing plenary.
France angered the commission by refusing access for a Brussels
inquiry team last month in some test areas of French Polynesia and
failing to answer some of the commission's questions despite repeated
requests.
The commission has a legal duty to monitor health and safety measures
for EU states' nuclear experiments.

TONY Blair's Shadow Cabinet received a vote of confidence last night
from Labour MPs -- with the exception of a humiliating defeat for Shadow
Trade and Industry spokesman Dr Jack Cunningham, who has served on the
Front Bench team since 1983.
Thanks partly to a deliberate strategy adopted by women MPs for the
elections, women continue to make a slow but steady advance in the
Shadow Cabinet, with the extra place in the now 19-strong team taken by
Ms Clare Short, who from a position on the left of the party has become
a valued ally of Mr Blair.
She made a notably strong defence at the party conference of the
leadership's decision to ditch hard-left Ms Liz Davies as a
parliamentary candidate.
Former deputy leader Mrs Margaret Beckett becomes the favourite of the
PLP, with 187 out of 270 votes cast, putting last year's winner, Shadow
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, into second place with 181.
The unexpected return of Mr Tom Clarke means that there are now six as
opposed to five Scots in the Shadow Cabinet. There now are six instead
of five women.
Mr Donald Dewar, the Shadow Social Security spokesman, increased his
vote to 156 from 142 last year, but came fifth instead of fourth while
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown ran third with 159 votes this year to 167
in 1994.
Mr George Robertson, Shadow Scottish Secretary, dropped 10 votes and
fell from ninth to seventeenth place.
The other Scot elected was Dr Gavin Strang, Shadow Agriculture
spokesman, whose vote shot up from 97 to 131, recognition of his work in
strengthening Labour's profile in rural seats.
Disappointments for the Scots were the moderate showing of MPs like
Brian Wilson (Cunninghame North), whose Commons performances have
impressed but who only gained two votes to poll 88, and Mr Alistair
Darling (Edinburgh Central), who won only six more to fall well short of
a place, with 67.
Mr Clarke said he was not surprised by his return to the Shadow
Cabinet after being voted off last year.
''I'm absolutely delighted that the Parliamentary Labour Party has put
me back onto the Shadow Cabinet,'' he said.
''I look forward to working with Tony Blair in what is a vital period
as we approach the General Election.
''I'm sure Jack Cunningham will have a pivotal role in the Shadow
Cabinet. I think Tony Blair recognises Jack's abilities,'' he said.
Responding to the news of Dr Cunningham's failure to get re-elected,
Mr Cook said: ''I'm sorry when any colleague loses his seat. Jack I know
has put a lot of effort into making contacts. He must be very
disappointed by the outcome.''
Mr Blair may leave many of the posts unchanged, but with a few
shuffles to give an essentially unchanged team a brighter look.
With the prospect of a General Election next year growing as the
Government's majority shrinks, last night's vote may have elected
Labour's first real Cabinet for 17 years.
Ms Short's entry into the Shadow Cabinet was the result of a strategy
developed by a group of Labour women MPs after last year's elections, it
emerged last night.
Several who had planned to stand chose not to in order to give the
more electable women a better chance.
Rules introduced this year required MPs to vote for at least four
women. By conspiring to reduce the number of women standing, the group
forced up the vote for each of those who were.
One woman MP, who stood last year, said: ''We discussed it among
ourselves last year, and at the Labour conference. There was a feeling
among the women that we were damaging our chances.''
Four MPs who stood last year chose not to this year: Mrs Mildred
Gordon, Ms Kate Hoey, Ms Joan Walley and Mrs Maria Fyfe.
One said: ''This time we acted in a sisterly manner to ensure Clare
Short got on, and that those already there stayed.''
* The full results after voting among 270 MPs were:
Margaret Beckett 187, Robin Cook 181, Gordon Brown 159, Ron Davies
157, Donald Dewar 156, Marjorie Mowlam 152, Chris Smith 148, Frank
Dobson 142, David Clark 141, Ann Taylor 138, David Blunkett 132, Gavin
Strang 131, Jack Straw 128, Joan Lestor 122, Michael Meacher 121, Clare
Short 119, George Robertson 116, Harriet Harman 108, Tom Clarke 107.

BRITISH GAS is planning to resume drilling on the seabed off the West
Coast of Scotland this morning, despite strong expressions of concern by
a group of Scottish MPs who met the chairman Mr Cedric Brown yesterday,
(writes Stuart Trotter).
They fear that ''ploughing'' work on the seabed to construct a trench
for a connector pipeline between the West Coast and Northern Ireland
could displace many more explosive devices of the kind already washed up
on Scottish coasts.

THE Royal College of Nursing, which held its annual general meeting in
Edinburgh yesterday, said a recent Institute for Employment Studies
survey put Scotland top of a league table for nurses who want to quit
the NHS.
Around 42% said they would leave the profession if the opportunity
arose. Low morale, caused by a lack of job satisfaction, security, low
pay, and a lack of prospects, has been blamed for the drift away.
However, RCN General Secretary Christine Hancock said the independent
review body, which sets pay levels for nurses, should be defended
despite a controversial 1% national award topped up to 3% locally this
year.
She claimed the body had worked well for the last decade, amid the
recent fear it had been undermined by a deal negotiated last month
between NHS managers and health unions, including Unison, for local pay
deals with a national safety net.
''The review body system has not been extravagant in the way it has
paid nurses. What it has ensured is decency, fairness, and a reasonable
approach to pay and that is what nurses have wanted to see and what
nurses have respected,'' said Ms Hancock.
An RCN survey of 6000 nurses earlier this year found 20% of NHS staff
hoped to leave the profession within the next two years.
The RCN is one of eight professional groups within the NHS --
including the British Medical Association -- to publish a consensus
statement backing the body, which they claim is a vital safeguard for
standards of patient care.
Ms Hancock revealed the RCN was taking a resolution to the next
meeting of the Nursing and Midwifery Negotiating Council later this
month over the issue.
''Nurses, midwives, doctors, and the professions allied to medicine
have made a principled stand to defend national standards of patient
care by supporting a consensus statement on the pay of health
professionals which strongly endorses the review body system.
''The RCN now hopes to see our colleagues within the negotiating
council for nurses and midwives supporting the review body by ensuring
that it leads the pay round rather than ratifying decisions made
locally,'' said Ms Hancock.
Ms June Andrews, secretary of the RCN Scottish Board, said morale was
falling in the profession because of situations such as the 33% pay
award to the chief executive of the Grampian Healthcare Trust, while
nurses were given only 3%.
She said a recent survey had shown more than 40% of newly qualified
staff nurses had already quit the profession only a year after
qualifying, a situation which she described as ''serious''.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday donated #100,000 to Scottish
Opera as emergency funding to sustain the company in its present crisis.
The bank also issued a rallying call to Scottish businesses to step in
and save the opera company, which is scheduled to be put on a part-time
basis at the end of this year.
Lord Younger of Prestwick, chairman of the Royal Bank, handing the
cheque to Mr Richard Jarman, general director of Scottish Opera, said
that it was ''inconceivable'' to think of cultural life in Scotland
without Scottish Opera.
''We are bedrock supporters of Scottish Opera,'' said Lord Younger.
''It is an enormously important part of our cultural achievement, and we
felt that it was up to a firm like ourselves to step in and do
something.''
The #100,000 donation is unconditional, and not intended to support
any single production or area of activity. It is intended simply to
sustain the company on its present basis.
Lord Younger also called directly on corporate Scotland to help save
the opera company. ''Scotland has to determine whether it is prepared to
support a full-scale opera company or not,'' he said. ''We feel we're
doing our bit. We'd like to see others help to do so, too.''
Mr Sandy Orr, chairman of Scottish Opera, said that the Royal Bank's
donation was a ''typical, strong, robust reaction to the problems we
face''. He said that he hoped the views held by the Royal Bank would be
shared in the private sector.
''I am determined to fight for the retention of our fine company as a
full-time national asset, and am heartened that another of Scotland's
major institutions should affirm its commitment to the arts in such a
tangible form.''
The bank's gesture followed the publication of a report two weeks ago
which recommended that Scottish Opera should make its own orchestra
redundant and use other Scottish orchestras in the pit.
The board of Scottish Opera rejected the report and announced that, to
preserve the integrity of the company's resources, the entire company
would be put on a part-time basis from the end of this year.
Lord Younger would not be drawn on any political implications of the
bank's donation. He said that the future structure and activites of
Scottish Opera were a matter for the opera company and the Scottish Arts
Council.
It did appear, however, that he was aligning himself with the Scottish
Opera management's decision to hold the elements of the company
together, whatever the cost. ''We believe our support at this time will
assist Scottish Opera to arrive at a solution which will offer the best
chance of maintaining its artistic integrity,'' he said.
Mr Jarman said yesterday that, while the #100,000 would help
immediately to keep the company going, it did not materially affect the
decision to go part-time.
''This is a very important gesture of support for the company,'' he
said. ''It enables us to buy time for the rest of this year. But in the
long term we need secure, increased, and on-going funding. That comes
principally from public support.''
Mr Jarman added that the Royal Bank's #100,000 would literally keep
Scottish Opera alive while the long-term issues are addressed. ''It
guarantees our full-time programme at the moment, and to that extent
this money is absolutely vital.''
* A #250,000 fund aimed at supporting arts organisation during local
government reorganisation has been announced by Glasgow City Council.
The move comes after the city's Citizens' Theatre warned that it could
have to close to the public for anything between four and six months
after its #178,000 Strathclyde Regional Council grant is withdrawn with
the disappearance of the authority next April.
The council said the fund also would tide over events like the Glasgow
International Jazz Festival and Mayfest. Many organisations rely on
advance funding to meet running costs and wages usually paid out by the
council.
City treasurer Gordon Macdiarmid said the move was meant to give arts
organisations breathing space before the 12 new authorities agree on an
arts funding policy.

THE Prime Minister is to meet the leader of the SDLP, Mr John Hume,
this week to increase pressure on the IRA to change its stance on giving
up its weapons.
The involvement of Mr Hume, who was a key figure in bringing about the
ceasefire in Northern Ireland, is regarded as essential in persuading
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to accept an international commission to
arrange an IRA handover of ''offensive'' weapons like Semtex, mortars,
and ground to air missiles.
The move suggests the stalemate in the peace talks could be broken for
President Bill Clinton's visit to Ireland next month.
Yesterday the president's National Security Adviser, Mr Anthony Lake,
completed a round of talks in London and headed for Belfast and Dublin
in a bid to accelerate the peace process.
If Mr Hume agrees with Mr Major that, in the circumstances, Sinn
Fein/IRA should now make a significant gesture, there could be important
announcements before the visit.
The UK-Irish delayed summit could then be reinstated to combine with
Mr Clinton's tour of Britain and Ireland.
Even the Ulster Unionists are prepared to go along with the idea of an
independent international commission, chaired by an American, to try to
break the stalemate on the decommissioning of terrorists' weapons.
The Irish Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton, told his parliament in
Dublin yesterday: ''I believe there is a will on all sides to overcome
these problems, however difficult they may be.''
Mr David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said: ''We are
satisfied there is a commitment to peaceful methods . . . there is a
shift there.''
If Mr Hume can be persuaded by Mr Major to join the new initiative
launched by London, Dublin, and Washington, the IRA might be convinced
that it can no longer delay on the decommissioning weapons.

Angeles
A RETIRED British sailor accused of sexually fondling two teenaged
Filipino boys pleaded not guilty today to charges of acts of
lasciviousness.
Douglas Michael Slade, 43, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, pleaded
his innocence in a court in Angeles city in the Philippines while the
two boys, aged 12 and 13, sat with their mothers on a bench a few feet
away.
''Not guilty,'' Slade said after a woman clerk read out the charges
against him, for which he is liable to life in jail if found guilty.
Prosecutors filed the charges after the two boys complained the Briton
fondled them at his house in Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila.
Slade had earlier accused immigration agents of instigating the
''trumped-up charges'' against him. He is free on bail.
Another Briton is facing a separate trial in the Philippines for
sex-related crimes.
Travel agent Michael Clarke, from Eastbourne in the county of Sussex,
is on trial in Olongapo, 30 miles north-east of Angeles, on charges of
promoting child prostitution by advertising sex tours. He has also
denied the charge.
The Britons' trials coincide with a Philippine Government crackdown on
a flourishing sex trade in the country which has led to the growth of
child prostitution, officials said. The drive has netted about 10
foreigners in recent weeks, including Americans, Britons, and a
Frenchman.
BANGKOK: Two British disc jockeys at a popular music radio station in
Bangkok have been detained on charges relating to child pornography.
Clifford Armstrong, 34, and Ian David Baker, 44, were arrested at
their homes yesterday after police said they found pornographic material
there.
Immigration police said they had been charged with conducting immoral
activities. If found guilty, they would be deported after paying any
penalty.
Several other foreign workers at the radio station have been suspended
pending an investigation into the affair.
SYDNEY: An Australian became the first person to be charged under his
country's new laws aimed at preventing child sex tourism when he was
ordered to stand trial on charges of having sex with a five-year-old
Filipino girl.
Anthony Carr, 43, was charged with sexual conduct involving a child
under 16, arising out of a visit to the Philippines last November.
Documents presented to Manly Local Court alleged that Carr was
photographed indecently assaulting a girl aged five.
Carr, who has yet to enter a plea, faces nine charges, including five
of aggravated indecent assault on children in the Philippines and
Australia.--Reuter.

Paris
ALGERIAN Islamic militants stepped up pressure on French President
Jacques Chirac today to sever ties with Algeria's military rulers a day
after suspected Muslim extremists bombed a Paris underground train.
A leading Arabic newspaper reported that a Muslim extremist group that
has claimed responsibility for the bombing campaign in France had sent
Paris a four-point ultimatum, warning Chirac against meeting Algerian
President Liamine Zeroual next week.
The Saudi-owned London daily Asharq al-Awsat published what it said
were the demands of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) the day after the
latest bomb, the eighth in the series, tore apart a rush-hour
underground train in central Paris, injuring 29.
It said the GIA had told Chirac to cancel his planned meeting with
Zeroual in New York, suspend Algerian aid and diplomatic relations, and
denounce next month's Algerian presidential election.
French government spokesmen vowed that Chirac would go ahead with the
Zeroual talks next week, despite growing domestic criticism.
The GIA, a shadowy offshoot of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), has
claimed responsibility for a wave of bombings in France that has killed
seven people and wounded 170 since July.--Reuter.

Seoul
SOUTH Korean Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo said today that North Korea
could commit further military provocations and the United Nations
Command joined Seoul in accusing Pyongyang of infiltrating a spy.
''You cannot rule out the possibility of adventurous military
provocation if you look at the situation in North Korea hit by despair
from economic failure and uncertainty over the power succession,'' Lee
told senior military leaders.
North Korea's Kim Jong-il has still to receive the formal mantle of
national leadership following the death of his father Kim Il-sung in
July last year.
Lee was speaking after being briefed on yesterday's killing of an
armed North Korean spy just south of the inter-Korean border.
Today the Defence Ministry said it had confirmed that a second North
Korean infiltrator survived the shooting by South Korean troops and
slipped back to the North across the border.
Roadblocks remained as a massive search continued for other possible
communist agents still on the loose, it said.
''It is time to build our defences more solidly than ever,'' Lee told
the military leaders.
The United Nations Command in South Korea said it had attempted last
night to pass a protest message from South Korean Army Major General Lee
Suk-bok, senior member of the Military Armistice Commission (MAC), to
North Korea through duty officers at the border hamlet of Panmunjom.
However a North Korean duty officer refused to accept the message.
South Korea called for steps to prevent the repetition of the
infiltration, the first such incident since May 1992 when South Korean
border guards clashed with three infiltrating northern soldiers, killing
all of them.

AN Edinburgh University student leader last night admitted using false
identities and forged credentials to attend and vote at two major
national conferences.
The National Union of Students have been called in to investigate the
activities of Ms Catherine Bromley, vice-president representation of
Edinburgh University Students' Association.
President of the NUS Scotland, Mr Douglas Trainer, said an immediate
inquiry had been launched and an executive meeting would be held
tomorrow to discuss the issue.
Edinburgh University Students' Association is not affiliated to the
NUS and because of that Ms Bromley should not have voted or officially
attended at either conference.
At the NUS Women's Conference held in Blackpool last March, she
registered in her own name but masqueraded as the delegate from Jewel
and Esk Valley College in Dalkeith.
At the conference, she voted against a no-confidence motion against
the NUS president. The Dalkeith college has told student leaders it had
no delegates at the conference and did not have a women's officer.
Two weeks later, Ms Bromley returned to Blackpool to attend the NUS
national conference, where she registered in the name of Paula
Titterton, who at the time was a member of the Students' Association of
Reid Kerr College, Paisley.
At the conference, she addressed representatives as Paula Titterton,
voted on a crucial motion on student finance, and waived the right of
Reid College to speak on two amendments. The real Ms Titterton was not
available for comment last night.
Following inquiries by The Herald, Ms Bromley issued a statement where
she described her actions as ''indefensible and unacceptable''.
She went on to claim that her forged credentials and other papers had
been prepared by her former boyfriend. Ms Bromley accused him of leaking
the story after their relationship ended. The Herald was unable to
contact the man at the centre of her allegations.
She said an article in Edinburgh University's student newspaper,
Student, which outlined the way in which she attended both conferences
gave an accurate representation of her behaviour.
In it she is quoted as saying she attended the conference because she
wanted a holiday with her boyfriend and did not think he would have
allowed her to go if she had not voted.
Ms Bromley said: ''I will not defend my own personal actions as they
were, as I have stated elsewhere, indefensible and unacceptable.
''They do not, however, reflect on EUSA, Edinburgh University or my
position as vice-president representation.''
She added that the Students' Representative Council had discussed the
issue and had passed a motion of confidence in her by 26 votes to four
at a meeting on Tuesday evening.
NUS President Douglas Trainer said the case had caused them great
concern. He said the matter had been reported to him by the students'
association of Jewel and Esk Valley College in Dalkeith.
Mr Trainer said he had no idea why Ms Bromley would want to go to the
trouble of taking on a false identity and using forged documents to get
into the conferences.
Mr Trainer said: ''We have launched an inquiry into what happened. The
conferences themselves are complicated and arduous and I can't
understand why someone would want to sneak in.''
The Edinburgh University Students' Association said Ms Bromley had
confirmed to them that she had voted under false identities.
A spokesman for Edinburgh University said the matter was being dealt
with by the students' association and it was up to them to decide what
action should be taken.

Sarajevo
YUGOSLAVIA and Bosnia have agreed to open liaison offices in each
other's capitals, a move short of diplomatic recognition, US peace envoy
Richard Holbrooke announced in Sarajevo today.
''This is a small step on a long and difficult road,'' he said of the
move by two countries that have had no official contact since war broke
out in Bosnia 3[1/2] years ago.
The announcement came after talks in Belgrade with Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic, and in Sarajevo with Bosnian leader Alija
Izetbegovic to prepare peace talks between the warring parties at the
end of this month.
As further evidence of the quickening pace in the Bosnia peace
process, the US announced today a site for the talks on October 31 -- an
air force base near Dayton, Ohio.
Holbrooke, who was accompanied on his trip by Russian peace envoy Igor
Ivanov and the European Union's Carl Bildt, stressed that the move to
set up offices did not amount to full diplomatic recognition.
''That remains an important, and I might add difficult, objective of
our negotiations,'' Holbrooke said, adding that the move also assumed
that the current Bosnia ceasefire would hold.
Washington sought to persuade Belgrade earlier this year to recognise
Bosnia in exchange for lifting international sanctions that have
crippled the Yugoslav economy.
The initiative ran out of steam after Milosevic pressed for a complete
end to sanctions as the price of recognition, while the Americans
insisted on some mechanism to reimpose them if the Yugoslavs failed to
honour their commitments.
The three envoys flew to Sarajevo in a Hercules transport plane
bringing humanitarian aid to the besieged Bosnian capital.
A ceasefire across Bosnia, arranged as a prelude to the peace talks,
came into force last Thursday, though fighting has continued in the
north-west of the country.
Earlier the three men held talks in Belgrade with Milosevic, a key
figure in the peace process since taking over the negotiating role from
the intransigent Bosnian Serb leadership.
Apart from preparing for the peace talks, the envoys were briefing
Milosevic on yesterday's talks in Moscow between a big-power Contact
Group on former Yugoslavia.
Later Milosevic met French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette who
brought up the issue of two French pilots shot down over Bosnia seven
weeks ago and captured by the Bosnian Serbs.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said earlier the men had now been
kidnapped by an unknown group and he did not know where they were.
Group members agreed to step up the pace of the peace process, but
failed to overcome a serious obstacle to a settlement -- Moscow's
objections to participating in an international peace force under Nato
command.
The question of Russian participation has emerged as a real problem,
though all sides in the five-nation Contact Group, which also includes
Britain, France, and Germany, agreed to make every effort to overcome
it.
Asked in an interview with French television shown in Russia if there
would be Russian troop participation in a peacekeeping force, Yeltsin
said: ''Under the aegis of Nato, no.''
Moscow has proposed a joint or rotating command between Russia and
Nato, but Washington has rejected this idea.
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky said the issue would be
one of the central questions to be worked out at the summit meeting
between President Boris Yeltsin and US leader Bill Clinton in the United
States next week.--Reuter.

A SCHEME to measure pollution levels on some of Scotland's busiest
streets was launched yesterday in Glasgow.
The sophisticated #50,000 air quality monitoring unit will carry out a
series of seven-day tests at various sites throughout the city.
The first exercise began yesterday in Union Street in Glasgow city
centre, a road popular with shoppers but also a busy bus route.
As well as measuring pollution levels, Strathclyde region hopes the
exercise will show if new road schemes have been successful in reducing
pollution levels.
The unit will take readings on the busy A77 through Glasgow's south
side and compare these to measurements taken on the M77 motorway when it
is completed.
Opponents to the road have claimed children and those suffering from
respiratory diseases will suffer from the increased pollution caused by
the heavy traffic flows.
Councillor Charlie Gordon, of the region's roads and transport
committee, said the tests would show if traffic initiatives were meeting
targets for the reduction of pollution.
''We will be using the unit to try and monitor progress towards our
pollution targets,'' said Mr Gordon.
''It is part of our five-year plan in the city centre to improve air
quality and to pinpoint any problem spots.''
Mr Gordon said the exercise would give an accurate picture of what
risk the cocktail of fumes posed to health.

Madrid
THE Spanish Senate decided today to investigate claims that Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez's government oversaw a 1980s war by security
force death squads against Basque Eta rebels.
The decision was passed by 128 votes to 127. Gonzalez has denied
persistent accusations that he knew about the activities of the shadowy
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups (GAL) against Eta (Basque Homeland and
Freedom) guerrillas.
The move increases pressure on Gonzalez, adding to a series of court
efforts to determine whether, as charged by former intelligence chiefs
and disgruntled allies, he knew of the campaign which claimed 27 lives
from 1983 to 1987.
Left and right united against Gonzalez's ruling Socialists to support
the opposition Popular Party proposal by one vote.
Gonzalez and the rest of the government deny having known that
security forces and hired gunmen were kidnapping, torturing, and killing
presumed separatist guerrillas of Eta to try to stop their bloody
campaign.
However the Popular Party claims that depositions by former police and
security officials incriminate the government.
Gonzalez insists he first learned of the death squads through the
press. The scandal has seriously affected the Socialists' credibility
and has served the Popular Party with a potent electoral weapon.
The Popular Party, which is leading in opinion polls, and other
opposition groups are calling for Gonzalez to step down and call early
elections.
Gonzalez has called polls a year early in the spring, but has not said
whether he will stand for an unprecedented fifth term as Prime
Minister.--Reuter/AP.

SCOTTISH Nuclear yesterday moved to defend its record after it emerged
that the utility's former director of safety is to tell MPs that nuclear
privatisation is endangering safety standards.
However, Labour industry spokesman Brian Wilson said that
reponsibility for answering the concerns lay with the Government and not
Scottish Nuclear.
Former safety director Captain Richard Killick, who retired last
month, will give evidence before a Commons Select Committee alleging
that low morale, heavy workloads, and pressure to cut costs before
privatisation threatened ''a significant reduction in safety''.
However, in a statement yesterday, Scottish Nuclear's technical
director, Mr Jim Grant, said: ''There will be no compromise on safety.
''Safety will remain the company's top priority.''
Later, Mr Wilson dismissed the statement. He said: ''The comments in
the statement do not begin to address the concerns over privatisation
which Richard Killick had highlighted.
''This is not a matter for Scottish Nuclear to defend themselves over.
I am a defender of their record under public ownership.
''The obligation to address these concerns lies directly with the
Ministers who are driving the privatisation agenda through for reasons
that are cynical and political.''

THE UK'S official unemployment tally fell for the 25th consecutive
month in September to a four-year low.
Statistics released yesterdayshow a seasonally-adjusted jobless total
of 2,265,100, or 8.1% of the workforce, down 27,200 on the previous
month, and the lowest figure since that of May 1991.
In Scotland, 1700 left the unemployment register, which stands at
196,100, or 7.9% of the available workforce.
However, while that news was welcome for the Government, it was
tempered by new retail sales figures which revealed that consumers are
remaining cautious in their spending patterns.
Sales failed to recover after a sharp 0.8% fall in August and, for the
first time since July 1992, were down on the previous year's level.
Retailers said the statistics demonstrated that there was an economic
and political case for cutting taxes in November's Budget to boost
confidence in the economy.
The 27,200 decrease in the number of people out of work and claiming
benefit was the biggest of the year so far and was bolstered by a big
rise in the number of people in work: up by 107,000 in the latest
quarter, the biggest rise for more than three years.
In addition, there is evidence that pay remains under control. Average
earnings rose by 3.25% in the year to August, the same as in the
previous month.
City analysts said a bigger-than-expected fall in unemployment
indicated the economy remained robust and offset the weakness suggested
by the retail sales data. The figures therefore had few implications for
interest rates.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth described the jobless figures as
''very good news'' and welcomed the fact that unemployment had fallen in
every region of Scotland.
However, Labour's employment spokesman John McFall said the Tories had
a shabby record on unemployment. Compared with 1979, he said, there were
now 23,000 claimants out of work for a year or more, and 20% of the
under-25 age group were long-term unemployed.
The SNP's Anne McNair said the ''fiddled'' figures were ''a shameless
charade by a shameless Government'' and said even those finding work had
no guarantee of job security.
Liberal Democrat employment spokesman David Chidgey said: ''While the
fall in unemployment is welcome, there is continuing concern about the
decline in the level of manufacturing employment -- the dynamo of the
economy.''
Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ''The continued decline is
welcome but the overall figure remains too high. The Scottish economy
can do better and these figures show the need for a Scottish Parliament
to ensure an economy that is both effective and prosperous.''

FORMER SAS commando Tom McClean said yesterday he would set off on a
return trip to America next summer in a 60ft-long steel ''whale'' named
Moby Dick.
The 18ft-high craft, which has a girth of 45ft, will be launched in
Inverness. It was built at William Reid's engineering works in Forres,
Moray.
Mr McClean, 50, said he got the idea for the whale-boat from his
nickname -- his friends have called him Moby Dick for the past 30 years.
He said he was looking for eight people to crew the craft on her
three-week trip across the Atlantic via the Azores next June.
Whale-spotting will be a feature of the voyage for crewmen. The return
trip will include a visit to the whaling grounds off Newfoundland.
The Atlantic holds no fears for Dublin-born Mr McClean, a father of
two, who runs an outdoor adventure centre at Loch Nevis, near Mallaig,
Inverness-shire.
He has seldom been out of the news since he became the first man to
row the Atlantic in 1969.
In 1983, he conquered the ocean in the bath-tub sized Giltspur and two
years later lived for six weeks on uninhabited, storm-swept Rockall to
claim it for Britain.
Next summer, he will wave goodbye to his wife, Jill, and their
children, James, 15, and Ryan, 13, just as he did in 1987 when he
reclaimed the solo rowing record with a crossing of just 57 days.
He appealed yesterday for businesses to help finance his latest
venture through sponsorship.
Those wishing to crew Moby Dick or to help in other ways should get in
touch with Mr McClean at Invermorar House, Mallaig PH40 4RG, or
telephone him on 01687 462274.

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council last night welcomed the Government's
decision to inspect community care services in Lanarkshire.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State, said the Scottish
Office social work services inspectorate had been asked to carry out the
inspection.
He said: ''It is very important that people entering residential care
and their relatives are given unrestricted choice of care homes or
nursing homes in their area.
''Representations have been made that in Lanarkshire this free choice
has not always been made clear to people.''
Mr Ian Gilmour, Strathclyde depute director of social work, said:
''The council takes its responsibilities for community care and placing
of elderly people in residential homes very seriously.''

A SCHOOLBOY driver who admitted killing a friend in a car he got by
swopping it for a stereo system days earlier was yesterday sent to a
young offenders' institution for 18 months.
Danny Holland, 14, died when he suffered massive head injuries after
being catapulted from the Ford Escort XR3i when it crashed at high speed
in March this year.
Police followed the vehicle as it travelled at speeds of more than
100mph, but lost sight of it shortly before it crashed at Kidlington,
Oxfordshire.
Jason Stevens, who is now 16, of Harts Close, Kidlington, admitted a
single charge of causing death by dangerous driving.
One witness told Mr Justice Kenneth Wilson-Mellor at Oxford Crown
Court that Stevens had told him he would tell police that Danny Holland
was driving the car when it crashed.
Mr Anthony McGeorge, prosecuting, said Stevens's car drove at more
than 100mph along the A41 Oxford Road at Bicester, and more than 70mph
in a 30mph area in central Oxford.
Police in a marked car later saw the vehicle again and tried to
follow.
Mr McGeorge said Stevens told police several days after the crash:
''The police car came ramming in at me. He tried to ram me. That scared
me so I started driving up the road.''
He added: ''I'm real sorry about the death of my friend. I wish I'd
pulled over.''
Stephen Powell, 21, another passenger in the car, told police: ''We
were doing 125mph. I told him to slow down. I was scared. I said slow
down, you are going too fast.
''He said he was not going to slow down, he was not going to get
arrested for no-one. He was not going to lose his car.''
Stevens was detained for 18 months and disqualified from holding a
driving licence for five years.

A LAW firm has been ordered to pay #9099 compensation to its former
secretary, Mrs Mary Burnside.
Mrs Burnside, 58, claimed she was sacked unfairly by Hennesey Bowie
and Co after she failed to accept a proposal to halve her hours and pay.
She refused to work mornings only every second week, with a colleague
doing the same hours on alternate weeks, to allow a third secretary her
desk in the afternoons. She was then dismissed after many years service.
Mrs Burnside, of Hume Drive, Uddingston, told a Glasgow industrial
tribunal that she had been widowed a year earlier and depended on her
income. She couldn't afford such a drop in pay.
In addition, she considered her work was important in terms of
rehabilitating herself after her bereavement.
She told the tribunal that it simply never crossed her mind that she
was at risk of dismissal.
Had she been faced with the stark choice of having to agree to work
alternate weeks of mornings only or losing her job, she would have
agreed to work alternate weeks.
She had worked for Mr Bowie in his own practice for 10 years and for
Hennessey Bowie and Co for another 10 years at West Regent Street,
Glasgow.
In its findings, the tribunal decided the reason for Mrs Burnside's
dismissal was a problem of space in the office but said other solutions
could have been considered before she was dismissed.
It said it was not acceptable for the firm to discuss a major change
in employment terms and conditions by telephoning Mrs Burnside at home.
This should have been discussed properly at a meeting.
However, the tribunal said it was much more serious to dismiss her
without making it perfectly clear to her that she would be dismissed if
she refused to accept the change.

A WITNESS wept yesterday in court as she described how her father,
Frederick West, and her stepmother Rosemary West sexually assaulted her
at the age of eight in the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street.
Both Wests carried out the attack in which she was gagged and her
hands bound, the 31-year-old told the court.
The assaults were to continue on a regular basis until Anne-Marie
Davies, who later married, ran away from home at the age of 15.
The pain, she said, was excruciating. ''It hurt so much I wished I was
dead.''
Mrs Rosemary West pleads not guilty to the murder of 10 young women
and girls -- including her own daughter Heather -- whose mutilated
remains were recovered from 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester.
Five of the bodies were buried 3ft below the cellar where Mrs Davies
says she was first sexually assaulted in 1972.
She told the court she was taken down to the cellar by her father and
stepmother.
''About then I had my clothes removed,'' she told the court. Asked who
did this, she replied: ''Rosemary did.'' Mrs Davies said she cried.
''I was told that I should be very grateful. I was lucky I had such
kind parents who thought enough of me to help me. When I got married, I
would be able to satisfy my husband and keep my husband,'' she said.
Mrs Davies continued: ''I was led to believe all loving parents were
the same.
''I was struggling, screaming, crying, and my legs were crossed.
Rosemary sat on my face.'' Mrs Davies said because she had struggled her
hands were bound and she was gagged.
Her father had sexual intercourse with her and it seemed to go on for
a long time, her stepmother sat across from her watching.
Mrs Davies said she kept asking ''Why?'' but Mrs West would not answer
her.
Between sobs, she told the court that it was difficult to recount
these events.
Throughout the events, Mrs West had laughed and smirked. Mrs Davies
said Rosemary West had told her it was for her own good and she should
stop being silly.
''My stepmother grabbed my breasts and was scratching them until they
were bleeding,'' said Mrs Davies.
Mrs West had then taken her upstairs and helped her wash. Mrs Davies
said she was warned not to say anything to anyone.
She also remembered another occasion when her father came home with
steel objects he had made at work.
Mrs Davies described to the court another sexual attack on her by her
stepmother in which she was strapped to one of these instruments.
''I was frightened . . . I was completely naked,'' said Mrs Davies.
She said she had been gagged before Mrs West started hitting her with
her fists and hands and swore at her, calling her names.
After the attack, during which her father appeared for a brief period,
her face was swollen and she was scratched, said Mrs Davies.
Her stepmother poured a bath and put salt into it.
''She said it would sting but it would help me. She gave me a cup of
tea,'' Mrs Davies said.
Mrs Davies told the court that her father, Frederick West, had sexual
intercourse with her on many occasions and sometimes her stepmother,
Rosemary, would be there. Often it happened in her father's van.
He gave her a few pounds to buy sweets and told her not to tell.
In the house there was a door which led into the ''best room''.
Mr Brian Leveson QC, prosecuting, asked, ''When did you use the best
room?''
Mrs Davies: ''It used to be used for entertaining people.''
Mr Leveson: ''What sort of people?''
Mrs Davies: ''Clients.''
Mrs Davies also recalled first going to a public house when she was 13
with her stepmother.
She remembered drinking barley wine and being very tipsy at closing
time. She was told they would be walking homebut shortly after her
father pulled up in the van.
She was pushed into the back of the vehicle and her stepmother joined
her. Mrs West then started to beat her with her fists. Mrs Davies said:
''I remember thinking, 'What have I done . . . why?'.''
Her father then joined them in the back and he, too, hit her before
having sexual intercourse with her.
Mrs Davies said her stepmother Rosemary West was just laughing and
fondling her breasts and squeezing.
Asked if she ever told anyone about the assaults, Mrs Davies recalled
when aged nine, her father used to tell Rosemary to ensure when
disciplining her that the bruises didn't show. She was given a note to
take to school excusing her from games on these occasions. One day, a
lady from the welfare came to see her stepmother.
Mrs Davies said after this visit she was beaten, despite insisting
that she had not said anything to anyone.
Mrs Davies recalled seeing Shirley Ann Robinson at 25 Cromwell Street.
She said that at first her stepmother had started seeing her and then
her father.
''My father made Shirley pregnant and at the same time my stepmother
was pregnant,'' she said.
She recalled an occasion when her father tapped Shirley's stomach and
said: ''There's a baby in there.''
''He was taunting my stepmother by saying Shirley's going to be his
next wife,'' added Mrs Davies.
He said that Shirley was going to have a white baby.
Mrs Davies continued: ''My stepmother was very upset. It is
understandable my father was humiliating her.''
After that, things became very tense in the household and Ms Robinson
tended not to come down to the West's living area as often as she had
done previously. One day, she came home from school shortly before
Shirley's baby was due and was told she had gone to Germany.
''I never saw her again,'' Mrs Davies told the court.
The court has heard that Ms Robinson's remains and that of a foetus
were uncovered from underneath the patio in the back garden at 25
Cromwell Street.
Asked about the relationship between her father and stepmother, Mrs
Davies said: ''They doted on each other. Rosemary had so much love for
my dad she would have done anything for him.''
On June 17, 1987, Mrs Davies said Mrs West held a birthday party for
her three-year-old daughter. Members of her family came to her house for
the party, including her step sister Heather. She never saw Heather
again.
Mrs West is also accused of murdering Heather.
Mrs Davies's natural mother was Scots-born Rena West. The court has
heard her remains were found in a field, although Mrs West is not
accused of killing her.
Mrs Davies told the court she could vaguely remember her
naturalmother.
Initially, Mrs Davies had lived at 25 Midland Road, Gloucester, with
her stepmother and her sister Charmaine.
Mrs Rosemary West is accused of murdering Charmaine, who disappeared
when she was eight.
Mrs Davies, then aged about seven, thought they said she was her
daddy's girl. ''I loved my dad a lot,'' she said.
Mrs Davies recalled an occasion when Charmaine was tied to the bed.
Then one day when she came home from school she was told Charmaine had
gone back to live with her mother.
When Charmaine disappeared, only Rosemary and Mrs Davies were living
in the Midland Road flat.
''I remember my father was in prison,'' said Mrs Davies.
Mrs Davies said: ''I was there. Rosemary was there. Charmaine
wasn't.''
The trial continues today with a visit by the jury and court officials
to 25 Cromwell Street.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth will become an honorary Gael
tomorrow when he heads north to learn the ''Language of Eden'' at the
Royal National Mod in Golspie.
For the second time in a week the Lowlander will sit down to take a
Gaelic lesson alongside other learners.
On Monday he toured the Gaelic college, Sabhal Mor Ostaig, in Skye,
saying to students and staff Ciamar a tha thu? -- the traditional
greeting of the Gael.
Tomorrow he will take part in a Gaelic conversation class at Golspie
High School during the first tour of the annual festival of Gaelic arts
and culture by a Scottish Secretary since 1972.
During his last spell at the Scottish Office as Education Minister, he
astonished the House of Commons by responding to a question about Gaelic
with a rehearsed answer in the language. However an off-the-cuff
supplementary question from Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald, a native
speaker, had him stumped.
At the Mod yesterday the ''Gaelic Booker Prize'' was won by a former
headmaster from Lewis.
Calum Ferguson's book Hiort -- the Gaelic name for St Kilda -- is a
social history of the now deserted islands. He fears the distinctive
traditions and culture of the hardy island race will be lost forever.
Mr Ferguson said: ''Their culture and music reflects their almost
total reliance on the seabirds for their life. They had some really
lovely bird songs to welcome them back after the winter that are now
sadly in danger of being forgotten.''
He picked up one of the biggest cash awards at the festival -- #400
from sponsors An Comunn Gaidhealach.

<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER magnate Robert Maxwell's death had a ''catastrophic'' effect
on his company's shares, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Kevin Maxwell told the court hearing the fraud case against him,
his brother Ian, and Maxwell aide Larry Trachtenberg: ''The initial
consequence of my father's death was the price of MCC (Maxwell
Communications Corporation) went into freefall.
''His death and the reaction of the market resulted in hundreds of
millions of pounds being wiped from the share price.''
In his third day in the witness box, Mr Maxwell explained the reasons
for the group's collapse.
He said that, in November 1991, after his father's disappearance at
sea, the survival of the group relied on a number of aspects.
''It depended on the value of assets exceeding its liabilities. It
depended on continuing bank support. It depended on the ability to
obtain fresh equity and the management of the group remaining in control
of its most important assets.''
Questioned by his counsel, Mr Alun Jones QC, about the ''seeds and
origins'' of the group's failure, Maxwell said: ''I feel that I share a
significant responsibility for the collapse of the business.''
He listed disastrous losses of more than #300m in share values in the
1987 world stock market crash as contributing to the company's collapse.
These assets had been acquired during ''an absolutely massive spending
spree'' by his father using MCC and private companies' money.
Despite problems, his father was still keen to go ahead with a
multi-billion dollar investment in Paramount which left Kevin Maxwell
''speechless''.
Mr Maxwell, his brother Ian, and former Maxwell adviser Larry
Trachtenberg, deny conspiracy to defraud the company pension funds by
misusing #22m-worth of shares in Israeli company Teva as security for a
loan in a bid to prop up the crumbling Maxwell empire.
Mr Kevin Maxwell alone denies a charge of conspiring with his late
father to misuse #100m of shares in another Israeli concern, Scitex, to
pay private Maxwell company debts.
In both cases, claim the prosecution, the shares were not theirs to
use but belonged to the pension fund.
Mr Kevin Maxwell has told the court he believed what his father had
told him, that the shares had been transferred from the pension fund to
the Robert Maxwell Group and that he acted legally.
The trial continues today.

THE new South Lanarkshire unitary council said last night it had not
agreed to participate in any Government pre-school voucher pilot scheme
despite Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's comments to the contrary at
Scottish Questions in Parliament.
Mr Forsyth indicated yesterday that eight of the new unitary
authorities had said they would participate, including South
Lanarkshire.
He expected that the concept, giving a voucher worth #1100 to parents
of all four-year-olds, would become generally accepted.
However, a council spokesman said: ''It is not the case that we have
agreed to become involved.''
The council is already on record as stating the concept of pre-school
vouchers was devisive and has called for more funding through local
authorities.

AN amateur footballer was convicted yesterday of common assault and
fined #400 at Ayr Sheriff court. He struck an opponent during a match.
Sheriff Neil Gow said the verdict had important implications for the
amateur game.
Ian Govans, a winger with Hurlford Thistle, was found guilty of
elbowing Dailly Amateurs defender Ian McLure in the face during an
Ayrshire Amateur League game on May 13 last year, breaking his
opponents' nose.
Sheriff Gow said he had been influenced by last week's decision by
Lord Hope at the Court of Appeal to reject former Rangers player Duncan
Ferguson's appeal against a three-month prison sentence for a pitch
head-butt.
He told Govans it was with some hesitation that he decided a prison
sentence was not required.
The sheriff said the assault had not been committed in a very public
forum, as in the Ferguson case. Only 100 spectators were present at the
match at Brunston Castle, Dailly.
A second distinction was that Govans, 30, of Sherwood Road, Hurlford,
was not a public figure.
Govans, a first offender, denied assault, claiming that he had merely
pushed his opponent and that his hand or forearm accidently struck
McLure.
After the incident, the Dailly club committee met at half-time and
decided to call in the police.
The court heard that McLure had already undergone one operation on his
nose and might require further surgery to correct breathing problems.

SCOTTISH MPs yesterday stepped up the pressure for a total ban on the
sleeping drug Temazepam as concern grew over its use by addicts.
In a Commoms debate, the Government was accused by a number of MPs of
not doing enough to prevent misue of the drug and to control its
availability. This week's announcement of a ban on the drug in its
gel-filled capsule form was described as ''too little, too late.''
However, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton rejected
the calls for a ban, arguing instead that the Government was taking
measures to tackle the drugs problem head-on and was pouring resources
into it.
The debate was initiated by Labour MP Tommy McAvoy (Glasgow
Rutherglen), who said deaths in Strathclyde from drug abuse almost
certainly would reach 100 this year and that it was time for tougher
Government action.
He claimed that one fifth of supplies of the drug were coming to
Scotland, which had only 10% of the UK population, and claimed that the
main source was organised crime -- ''hardened people who don't care
about the consequences.''
There was a suspicion that the Government was not seriously concerned
about the problem and was more concerned about the cost to suppliers
than the effects on people.
Mrs Irene Adams (Paisley North -- Lab.) who has been at the forefront
of the campaign against drug dealers in her constituency and the West of
Scotland, said that, on paper, Britain exported more Temazepam than it
manufactured. The drug had run out of patent, and there now were 10
companies making it. Anyone, she claimed, could set up as a
pharmaceutical wholesaler.
Mrs Adams -- whose family has been threatened by drug barons and who
referred to evidence of addicts, particularly to the gel form of the
drug, having limbs amputated because of its effects -- said that
licences to manufacture Temazepam were not being policed adequately.
She told the House: ''These drugs are not finding their way out of the
country but on to the back streets of the country, and they are causing
abject misery to families the length and breadth of this country.
''We have to look at banning the manufacture of the jelly form and
possibly banning its manufacture completely.''
Mrs Adams's Paisley MP colleague Mr Gordon McMaster joined in the
tributes to her courage in taking on the drug barons and referred to the
territorial battles going on in the area as the drug dealers fought for
supremacy.
He said: ''I would favour a total ban because there are alternatives
and a total ban would be clearcut and final. Why does Britain
manufacture so much more Temazepam than we need?''
Mr McMaster also called for much tighter controls on the availability
of guns, arguing that the level of crime associated with Temazepam
showed that fire arms were far too easily available. In addition, he
wanted greater protection for witnesses in trials against ''evil drug
barons.''
Mr David Marshall (Glasgow Shettleston -- Lab.) said there should be a
ban on manufacture of the drug now with severe penalties for anyone
found making it after the ban had been imposed.
From the Labour Front Bench, Mr John McFall said it was ''incumbent on
the Government to rethink its whole policy on this issue.''
For the Government, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton argued that the Government had made resources available
on a wide front to tackle the drugs problem.

WHY were people so keen to get him out of the country, Mr Michael
Forsyth wondered yesterday. It was his very first appearance at the
despatch box as Secretary of State and already he was being invited to
take himself off to Catalonia, Bavaria and Geneva.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace suggested the trips to
Spain and Germany would show Mr Forsyth how well devolution worked
there.
Mr Forsyth, Minister in charge of an array of quango appointments,
blushingly replied that half the members of the proposed Scottish
parliament -- the not-directly elected ones -- would be put there by
patronage.
There also would be a ''jobs holocaust'' under devolution, he
prophesied, as employers and employees fled Caledonia for the happy,
lower-taxed parts of the United Kingdom.
All was not aggression, however. The Secretary of State continued to
shower compliments upon Mr Campbell Christie, doubtless well deserved,
but just possibly motivated by a desire to exploit any cracks in that
Labour unity which Mr Blair has made the order of the days, weeks and
months.
He had to halt this campaign of damning with excessive praise when
reminded of Mr Christie's enthusiasm for a Scottish parliament.
''Campbell Christie isn't right about everything,'' Mr Forsyth was
obliged to concede to relieved cheers from his own benches.
Mr Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye -- Lib. Dem.) with
political intent raised the cracks which had appeared in the new Skye
road bridge even, he said, before the opening ceremony. Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton told him they were merely ''cosmetic cracks''; if so,
far from the first this Government has suffered.
In a rather unfair flanking attack, Mr Forsyth was asked to do
something about reducing the duty on Scotch whisky -- a perpetual
favourite with Scots MPs of all persuasions, the campaign not the
liquor, of course.
The Secretary of State can only ask the Chancellor, as they well know.
Doubtless if Mr Forsyth could say ''Halve the duty Ken, and we'll pick
up 30 Scottish seats'' this  would prove a persuasive argument.
However,  as Mr Clarke knows, the likelihood is that the Scot, feeling
his national brew has been over-taxed for too long, would just go on
drinking and voting for the party he first thought of. Thus, he is
unlikely to be in the giving vein in this area of taxation.
As the Opposition brickbats whistled across the Chamber, one thought
it was enough to make a Secretary of State think longingly of foreign
parts. In fact, he will soon be heading for Japan. However,  not to get
away from it all. To try and persuade them to cut their tariff on
Scotch.

LABOUR tried to make capital yesterday out of the appointment of
former Labour MP Dick Douglas to chair the new Water and Sewerage
Customers' Council.
Questions were asked about whether the poll tax rebel had paid his
community charge since being appointed and, if he had not, why had the
Government appointed him.
However, it emerged last night that Mr Douglas had paid his poll tax
in full as far back as l991, and Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was
said to be furious that Labour had sought to ''disparage Mr Douglas in
this way without checking their facts.''
Mr Douglas, who switched to the SNP before being defeated in the 1992
General Election, last night angrily responded: ''I have paid my poll
tax in full as far back as 1991.
''This is an abuse of the House of Commons to raise the issue in that
way and I have protested to the Speaker.''
Mr Michael Martin (Glasgow Springburn -- Lab.) said in the House:
''Now that he has a nice salary, perhaps Mr Douglas would pay something
for that salary because he encouraged a great many people not to pay the
poll tax.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''Mr Douglas was
plucked from obscurity -- to which he was consigned by the electors --
by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Has he or has he not paid the
poll tax? Or is this not just another example of the Government's own
double standards?''

THE West Coast main line linking Scotland to London is to receive #7m
in European funding to pay for further feasibility studies into the work
required to improve the route.
Transport Secretary Sir George Young announced yesterday the money had
been made available from the EU's Trans-European Network budget for use
this year. He said he expected more money to be awarded in 1996 and
1997.
In a Labour-led debate on railway privatisation in the Commons, Sir
George said he was pleased with the progress made so far in preparing
the more than #1000m upgrade project, and rejected Opposition
suggestions that it was in crisis.
Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish expressed doubts over the size
of the award, and the project it would be spent on. He told MPs: ''#7m?
What is this for? It's simply for more feasibility studies. A #1000m
project is now in tatters,'' he said.
The British rail industry was being subjected daily, in the press, to
ridicule ''for no reason other than the sheer stupidity and stubbornness
of the Government,'' he said.
Opening the debate, Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said
the Government was in ''deep trouble'' over rail privatisation. He
highlighted safety as a particular concern.
The railways had been split into too many component parts to attract
interest from investors, he said.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday poured scorn on the
concept of a Scottish parliament as he gave his strongest response so
far to the devolution plans of the Opposition parties.
During heated exchanges at Scottish Question Time in the Commons, he
warned of a ''jobs holocaust'' if the assembly ever came into being and
repeated his claim that a ''tartan tax'' would be levied on the Scottish
people.
Mr Forsyth said that if the plans went ahead he ''may be the last
Scottish Secretary to argue for Scotland's interests inside the
Cabinet.''
He told the House that businesses and local authorities were working
to provide jobs in Scotland, and warned the Opposition: ''You are all
committed to policies which would threaten these jobs.
''The minimum wage which would destroy jobs, the Social Chapter which
would destroy jobs and the special deal for Scotland -- the tartan tax
-- which would be a jobs holocaust.''
He praised STUC general secretary Campbell Christie for trying to
ensure there were proper standards for training and education, but the
Liberal Democrats Scottish leader, Mr Jim Wallace, sought to turn the
compliment back on Mr Forsyth by stating: ''Yesterday Campbell Christie
was enthusiastically presenting to the Scottish people the blueprint for
a Scottish parliament.''
Mr Forsyth, said: ''Campbell Christie isn't right about everything.
His enthusiasm for seeing a socialist-dominated body has overtaken his
judgement.
The Scottish Secretary claimed that a Scottish assembly would have
half its members put there by patronage.
In a reference to the new unitary authorities in Scotland, Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson told Mr Forsyth: ''If we had a
Scottish parliament we would never have had this wretched,
gerrymandered, unnecessary reorganisation of Scottish local government
in the first place.
''Giving back a few powers to local councils in Scotland and beefing
up a few old quangos is not going to be seen as devolution. In fact, it
is a con trick, given the systematic stripping of power at a local level
in Scotland over the last 16 years.
''You look like the burglar who has stripped your house and then
expects to be thanked for giving you back the candlesticks. When are you
going to grasp the fact that the people of Scotland want a devolved
Scottish parliament and they won't settle for anything less than that?''
Mr Forsyth responded: ''When are you going to grasp the fact that
inward investment to Scotland would be damaged if people can go to Wales
or the North of England or elsewhere and have their workers paying a
lower rate of income tax? You are being grossly irresponsible.''

THE housing charity Shelter Scotland warned yesterday that its service
was under severe pressure because of record levels of homelessness and
long housing waiting lists.
Launching its annual report, acting director Elaine Rosie spoke of the
''uphill struggle'' just to raise funding for the level of service
currently offered.
Shelter has applied for national lottery funding to create a new
housing aid centre in Dundee and hopes to hear if its application has
been successful by next week.
It also said the changes to income support and mortgage interest
introduced earlier this month and changes to housing benefit due in
January would make an already difficult situation worse.
Ms Rosie commented: ''There is no doubt that our staff are bracing
themselves for the effect of these changes to become obvious.
''It is going to be a difficult year and we hope our supporters
continue to respond as magnificently as they have done up till now.''
The report shows the income of the charity in Scotland for 1994-95 was
#892,169.
Shelter Scotland is a division of Shelter the National Campaign for
Homeless People but maintains an independent fundraising programme.
The most recent survey by Shelter found 43,079 families and single
people applied for help from councils over homelessness last year.
In the report, Shelter claims these ''alarming'' figures understate
the true extent of the housing crisis in Scotland as many people never
approach their local authorities.

THE man whose appeal against a conviction and eight-year sentence for
a building society robbery split the senior ranks of the Scottish
judiciary may now stand trial for a second time.
The Court of Criminal Appeal yesterday set aside the conviction of Mr
Alan Church and granted leave to the Crown to bring a fresh prosecution.
The Lord Advocate now has two months to make a decision.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, said yesterday that Mr Church,
29, had suffered a miscarriage of justice at his trial because of the
absence of expert evidence that his face did not match that of the man
captured on the building society's security cameras.
The decision provoked a warning from lawyers that, unless the law on
fresh evidence appeals was changed, our criminal justice system would
fall into disrepute.
Mr Church's appeal should never have got off the ground because,
within weeks of Lord Hope and two other judges allowing the expert
evidence to be heard, a five-judge Bench headed by Lord Justice Clerk
Ross decided Lord Hope had interpreted the law wrongly.
However, because the ruling in Mr Church's favour had already been
made, his appeal was allowed to proceed as a ''one-off'' case.
The #930 robbery at the Alliance and Leicester Building Society in St
Vincent Place, Glasgow, took place in January 1993, and the robber was
captured on security cameras.
The following month, an excerpt from the videos was shown on STV's
Crime Stoppers programme. Mr Church, of Regent Moray Street, Yorkhill,
Glasgow, who had seen the film and realised that the robber looked like
him, went voluntarily to Cranstonhill Police Station.
He told police he knew nothing about the incident and that he had not
committed the robbery. However, he was later arrested, charged, and
convicted at the High Court in Glasgow in June 1994 after being
identified as the robber by three members of staff and a customer.
With the help of friends and by selling off personal possessions, Mr
Church raised cash to pay for reports from experts in the technique of
facial comparison. The experts then gave evidence before Lord Hope,
sitting with Lords Allanbridge and Clyde.
Lord Hope said yesterday that the court had decided to hear the
experts to rule on whether the verdict of the jury at Mr Church's trial
at the High Court in Glasgow, reached in ignorance of their evidence,
was a miscarriage of justice.
The question of identification was crucial in the case, so evidence
from experts that there were differences between the facial features of
Mr Church and those of the person on the video which had led them to
conclude they were not the same people would clearly have been important
evidence.
It was evidence which contradicted the eye witnesses and might have
been found by the jury to at least cast reasonable doubt on that
testimony.
Mr Graham Bell QC, a spokesman for the Advocates Criminal Law Group,
said the success of the appeal underlined the necessity for broadening
the basis upon which the Court of Criminal Appeal could consider new
evidence.
Had the court refused to hear the additional evidence on the basis of
the law, as stated in the five-judge case of Angus Elliott, that
miscarriage of justice would not have been rectified.
Mr Bell added: ''This case underlines the urgent requirement that the
court's powers to address possible miscarriages of justice must be
widened to include a test similar to the power of the Appeal Court in
England based upon a conviction being unsafe.
''The restriction held to exist by the court in Elliott cannot be
allowed to stand if respect for our system of criminal justice is to be
maintained.''
In the Elliott case, which over-ruled Church, Lord Ross said
Parliament had provided that fresh evidence should be allowed only if it
had not been available at the time of the trial and could not reasonably
have been made available.
It was accepted in Church that the evidence had been available at the
time of his trial but Lord Hope said it should be allowed despite that,
since Mr Church had provided a ''reasonable explanation'' for failing to
produce it.

<HEADLINE>Dumping Brent Spar in sea ruled out</HEADLINE>

SHELL yesterday virtually ruled out deep-sea dumping as an option for
the Brent Spar as an independent survey confirmed that ''in general'' it
had been accurate about the amount of wastes on board.
The oil company said it was confident a new solution could be found to
meet Government requirements and its director of public affairs, Mr John
Wybrew, said that effectively ruled out deep-sea dumping.
The statement was welcomed by Greenpeace whose successful high-profile
campaign to prevent the dumping in the Atlantic during the summer raised
emotions to such a pitch in Europe that Shell filling stations were
attacked.
Now it appears Shell is determined to avoid another confrontation. It
cannot categorically rule out deep-sea dumping because that option is
the only one so far licensed by the Government for the disposal of the
redundant oil loading installation. Shell is seeking an alternative
option which the Government will accept.
Mr Wybrew was speaking following the publication of a #200,000 report
by Norwegian firm Det Norske Veritas (DNV) on the contaminants in the
Brent Spar. DNV said Shell's inventory estimates on heavy metals and
radioactivity were confirmed with only minor deviations and, although
the total amount of oil on board was more than originally estimated by
Shell, it was far less than claimed by Greenpeace.
The total amount of hydrocarbons on board is estimated by DNV to be 75
to 100 tonnes compared to Shell's estimate of 53 tonnes and Greenpeace's
original figures of 5000 tonnes which it subsequently withdrew,
admitting an error.
The discrepancy with Shell's estimate was due to oil still in the
piping, according to DNV's Ole-Andreas Hafnor, who was responsible for
the report. DNV found no evidence that toxic waste had been hidden on
the platform.
Three times more sludge than Shell estimated was found in storage
tanks but this was largely accounted for by water and marine products.
The radioactivity levels would not be classed as radioactive waste in
most countries, Mr Hafnor said.
Mr Eric Foulds, Shell's director of the project to dispose of the
installation, said: ''If all the numbers were multiplied by 10, there
still would be no environmental significance.''
Geir Wang-Anderson, of International Greenpeace, said; ''The
information now means that the best method of decommissioning the Brent
Spar on land can be decided properly with all the facts before us.''
Campaign director Ms Sarah Burton said Greenpeace would work with
Shell in deciding the future of the Brent Spar and would present its own
disposal alternative later this week.

A DRUGS company employee was sacked after police were told he had been
involved in supplying an opium-based substance to a youth who was taken
to hospital in a life-threatening condition.
Police called at Mr Allan McNeill's Edinburgh workplace, MacFarlan
Smith Ltd, where controlled drugs are made.
Mr McNeill, 29, of Mayfield Crescent, Musselburgh, had claimed he was
unfairly sacked. An Edinburgh tribunal agreed and awarded him #12,742.
Police told company officials the youth's parents had informed them Mr
McNeill had been involved in the supply of a substance believed to have
been opium based.
Mr McNeill was questioned and the company's factory was searched but
nothing was found. He was suspended but denied any involvement in the
supply of a controlled drug to the youth.
He said the youth and his parents knew where he worked and the nature
of the work. He understood that the parents had named a number of
associates of their son to police when they were investigating.
Later, the youth recovered and allegedly named Mr McNeill as the
supplier of the drug cocktail.
Mr McNeill was called to a disciplinary hearing and dismissed by
production manager Stewart Cairns, who said he no longer had trust and
confidence in him.
Mr McNeill felt he did not get a fair hearing and that the minds of
management already were made up. His appeal was turned down.
In its findings, the tribunal said the firm did not do all it
reasonably could have done to establish and fortify its suspicions.

AN artificial electronic limb promises to give seventeen-month-old
Martin Calder, the youngest child in Britain to be fitted with such a
limb, much greater freedom.
Martin, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, was born with both hands and one
leg missing and is adapting well to his new right hand, fitted by
doctors at Southern General Hospital, Glasgow.
Fingers on the tiny hand clench as muscles in the stump of his arm
transmit signals from his brain.
As he grows older, doctors hope a left hand and working artificial leg
will follow.
''It should revolutionise his life. We are hopeful that he may soon be
able to feed himself,'' said Mr Mark Broomfield, lecturer in prosthetics
at Strathclyde University.
''He has already adapted well to using it -- perhaps better than some
older children, who find them heavy.''
Another department at Southern General is already working with Martin
to fit an artificial leg. Unlike the hand, it will not be electronic but
work from the natural swing of his upper leg.
It will probably be three years before doctors fit a left hand. ''To
cope with both at once might confuse him,'' said Mr Broomfield.
The socket of the #2000 artificial limb will have to be refitted every
three to four months as Martin grows. However, when the hand itself
becomes too small for him it can be passed on to another child.
Despite his disabilities, Martin has impressed everyone who meets him
with his intelligence, cheerfulness, and fighting spirit -- all
important factors for doctors deciding to fit an electronic hand to such
a young child.
Martin's mother, Mrs Avril Calder, said: ''It will make all the
difference in the world when he is able to feed and amuse himself. The
way things are, he takes up a lot of our time and we have three older
boys to look after as well.
''He's already trying to walk but the artificial leg he has is purely
cosmetic and you can see the frustration on his face when he tries to
stand up. We can't wait to get him fitted with a proper one.''

THE efforts of Britain's First World War Government to mount a smear
campaign against an Irish patriot were disclosed in Government papers
made public for the first time yesterday.
Sir Roger Casement, a former British diplomat, was hanged at
Pentonville Prison on August 13, 1916, for high treason after trying to
raise support in Germany for a Free Ireland.
Following his death details of his personal diaries chronicling his
promiscuous homosexual activities were leaked in order to prevent him
becoming a martyr. The diaries were seized by police.
Irish Nationalists have long suspected the diaries were forgeries.
However, last year they were released by the Public Record Office in
Kew, London, after being authenticated by forensic scientists.
The Government had previously resisted pressure to release the diaries
on the grounds that it could be harmful to UK-Irish relations and that
they had no wish to blacken the name of a man who had been hanged.
However, Cabinet papers released yesterday by the PRO showed how in
1916 officials had launched a concerted attempt to discredit Casement's
reputation in the face of a campaign for clemency.
A memorandum by Home Office Assistant Under-Secretary Sir Ernley
Blackwell to the Cabinet on July 15, 1916, baulks at a Foreign Office
suggestion that the diaries' contents should be disclosed before
Casement was hanged.
He adds, however: ''I see not the slightest objection to hanging
Casement and afterwards giving as much publicity to the contents of his
diary as decency permits so that at any rate the public in America and
elsewhere may know what sort of man they are inclined to make a martyr
of.''

THE man who heard a jury return a verdict of not proven over the
murder of teenager Amanda Duffy has been ordered to pay #50,000 in
damages to her family.
The ruling from the Court of Session comes after her parents, Joe and
Kate Duffy, raised a civil action against Francis Auld, who walked free
from the High Court in Glasgow after the criminal case against him was
found not proven.
Last night, Mr Duffy said the family would enforce the claim ''through
every legal means possible''.
Miss Duffy, 19, was found murdered at a town centre car park in
Hamilton, Lanarkshire, on May 30, 1992.
The not-proven decision led to a campaign to have the controversial
verdict scrapped in Scottish courts.
Auld later appeared in court and admitted making threatening telephone
calls to a former friend saying: ''You thought Amanda was the last, well
you're next.''
The civil court action names Auld as being responsible for Amanda's
death.
Lord Morison found that Mr and Mrs Duffy had been deprived of their
daughter's society.
They were each awarded #25,000, as well as legal expenses and interest
at 8% per annum, dating back to the day Amanda was murdered.
The decree for payment of the damages was issued from the Court of
Session last month. It is the first time the Duffy's have spoken of the
decision.
Auld, now 22, did not oppose the action. He is thought to be living in
the North of England.
The Duffys will have to first trace him, then claim the damages cash
through wages arrestment and other normal debt recovery procedures.
In theory, all wages earned by Auld could be claimed until the damages
are paid.
Mrs Duffy, 42, said: ''Amanda's life was taken and so was her
reputation. This judgment means her good character has been saved and
that has been the driving force that spurred us on.''
Mr Duffy, 44, added: ''It seems ironic that a criminal court with a
jury of 15 people can acquit someone charged with the murder of our
daughter and yet we can successfully raise a civil action.
''It makes a mockery of our legal system.''

A SNAPSHOT of how Scots spend their money was given in an extract of
figures provided by the Central Statistical Office yesterday.
The numbers reveal the average Scot spends #2.60 each week keeping in
touch with current affairs, 50p above the UK average, and #4 on spirits
and liqueurs.
The figures also showed weekly household outgoings in Scotland
averaged #280.50, #3.10 below the UK average, with only #41.30 spent
each week on housing -- the only region where such expenditure was not
one of the top three categories.
Food and non-alcoholic drink tops the list of spending each week, with
#49.60 spent in shops and supermarkets, closely followed by leisure,
which claims #49.30 of weekly outgoings. Cars and travel claim a further
#42.
Scots also finish high in the league of spending on fuel and power,
coming second only to householders in Northern Ireland, with an average
of #14.10 spent each week in homes.
Scots top the league tables in the ownership of washing machines, with
93% of households owing a machine, a higher proportion than anywhere
else in the UK. Around 56% also own tumble driers, a figure equalled
only by residents of south-west England.

A NATIONWIDE warning was issued yesterday about railed bed guards
after the death of a baby.
Urgent action was taken as a result of the weekend hanging of
11-month-old Matthew I'Anson when he slipped through the rails until his
head became trapped, with his feet unable to reach the floor.
Argos has stopped selling the rails at its 363 stores and placed
adverts in national newspapers warning that they are unsuitable for use
with babies and small children.
The company, which has sold 80,000 guards in four years, moved swiftly
after learning that the rail which killed the baby at his home in
Hartlepool, Cleveland, was bought from one of its stores.
A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
recommended that babies and small children should be placed in approved
cots rather than in beds from which they could fall.

THE airline price war on flights between London and Scotland hotted up
yesterday with new budget carrier Easyjet offering #29 singles between
Luton and both Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The new operation, which gets off the ground on November 10 to and
from Glasgow with Edinburgh services coming on stream two weeks later,
undercuts existing services, including Ryanair's Stansted-Prestwick
service which is due to begin a week today with a lowest return fare of
#59.
Ryanair has been threatened with legal action by the UK's second
largest airline, British Midland, for promoting its Scottish destination
as Glasgow-Prestwick when the airport is 35 miles from Glasgow. British
Midland has also threatened to match the #59 return fare.
Luton airport is less than 40 minutes by train from Kings Cross,
although until a new airport railway station is opened in 1997, a
10-minute bus shuttle is involved. Stansted, with its dedicated rail
link to London's Liverpool St, is slightly further out but with similar
connecting times.
However, it is at the Scottish end where the Easyjet service will save
on time and hassle in that it will fly direct to Glasgow and Edinburgh
airports. Ryanair offers free rail travel to and from Prestwick and both
it and Easyjet offer cheap rail connections to London.
For the first two weeks, all 130 seats on each of the three daily
flights (two on Saturdays and Sundays) in each direction will be
available at #29. After that, some seats will be available on every
flight at this low rate on a first-come-first-served basis. Once they
are all booked, single fares of #39, #49, and #59 come into play.
Yesterday, Easyjet was unable to say how many of each price category
would make up a typical planeload as much would depend on traffic
levels. However, the company does guarantee that 100,000 seats will be
available at #29 each year.
Chairman and chief executive of Easyjet, Mr Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who
also owns Stelmar Tankers, modelled his cut-price airline on Southwest
Airlines of Texas and Valujet, Florida, and plans to extend his budget
services to several European destinations next year.
He claims his aim is not to win market share away from other carriers
but to encourage market growth by bringing prices down to a level where
people could take impulse decisions to fly ''instead of buying, say, a
pair of jeans''.
Direct selling to customers with all reservations handled by the
company's tele-sales centre in Luton is a key ingredient in the
cost-cutting exercise as is insistence that there can be no
cancellations, alterations or refunds. In-flight refreshments will be
available for purchase.
Scottish Tourist Board chairman Ian Grant welcomed the new service as
''a huge boost to our promotional efforts in England''. Scotland wanted
to see more English visitors flooding in for Hogmanay and Burns
celebrations and the board's promotions could work well only if
potential visitors had a choice of value-for-money transport options.

AFTER years during which both Ministers and governors had taken their
''eye off the ball'', Mr Derek Lewis says, it was he and fellow Prisons
Board members who were trying to re-focus the Prison Service's efforts
on to security.
In a letter to the Home Secretary dated last Thursday, Mr Lewis argued
that he had done a great deal to drag the service back from the dire
state he found it in when he took on the job almost three years ago.
The 1990 Strangeways prison riot had prompted a change of climate in
the service which, he implied, had resulted in security considerations
being given inadequate priority.
Mr Lewis wrote: ''I believe that the change in climate triggered by
the 1990 riots, the Woolf report . . . resulted in both Ministers and
the service taking their ''eye off the ball'' of security, particularly
at the grass roots, in favour of conditions and care.''
It was only after the service got executive agency status that the
problems began to be addressed.
Mr Lewis suggested strongly that he had had neither the resources, nor
the managerial freedom, to achieve as much as he could have.
Commenting on Sir John Learmont's observation that top management had
to be responsible for its performance, Mr Lewis noted: ''Performance
must be measured in the round against the performance targets that are
set by Ministers for the service.
''These are agreed in the context of what is reasonable at that stage
in the development of the service and the constraints on resources or
freedom of action that apply.''
He felt he had been let down by some of those working below him as
well as by his political masters at the Home Office.
The Prison Officers' Association also came in for criticism. Mr Lewis
said it had ''an insidious and corrosive effect on morale''.

THE wife of John Marriott, the prison governor suspended from
Parkhurst following the breakout in January, last night claimed Mr Derek
Lewis told her husband not to pursue the question of who suspended him.
Mrs Marion Marriott said she and her husband went to see Mr Lewis in
February.
''We asked him, and he (Lewis) was stonewalling at the time. He said,
'Just don't follow that line of inquiry, because it won't do you any
good'.''
She spoke following more claims over whether Mr Howard intervened to
seek the disciplinary suspension of Mr Marriott.
Mr Howard announced Mr Marriott's departure, with immediate effect, in
the Commons. There has been speculation over whether the orders came
from Mr Lewis or the Home Secretary.
Recalling the day her husband was suspended, Mrs Marriott said he had
a meeting with director of custody, Ms Philippa Drew.
Ms Drew said it had been decided that Mr Marriott would have to be
moved from Parkhurst and she was trying to organise an orderly hand-over
which would take a number of weeks.
''Mid-afternoon, I got this phone call. John sounded terrible and he
said 'it is worse than we feared. The Home Secretary is going to say
that I have got to go now'. This was like minutes before the Home
Secretary got up in the Commons.''
Mrs Marriott said: ''We have long suspected there had been political
interference.''
Asked if she knew who telephoned Ms Drew shortly before Mr Howard
stood up in the Commons, she said: ''I don't know. But it obviously came
from somewhere on high because she went pale.
''She and her driver brought John home, and she actually burst into
tears here.''
Mrs Marriott said: ''More than anything else, John has felt betrayed.
He has worked bloody hard for 25 years. One day he is the governor who
is constantly being promoted . . . and the next day he is pushed out.''
Pressed whether she felt sorry for Mr Lewis, she said: ''I bet he
knows how John felt. Yes, I do feel sorry for him, because I know how
awful it felt.''

THE writ issued on behalf of sacked prison chief Derek Lewis details
difficulties he said arose as a direct result of intervention on
operational issues by the Home Secretary.
The document, delivered to the Treasury's solicitors, makes it clear
Mr Lewis is seeking damages for lost salary and bonus payments up to
September 1996, and other ''consequential'' losses.
He is also seeking damages and a declaration that his sacking was
unlawful.
The writ, drawn up by Russell Jones and Walker, solicitors to Mr
Lewis's trade union the First Division Association, makes it clear that
no disciplinary action had been taken against the former director
general of prisons before he was sacked.
It points out that Mr Lewis achieved all the main performance targets
set for him in the last financial year by the Home Secretary.
It claims any deficiencies were substantially caused or contributed to
by the ''high level of involvement'' by the Home Secretary in day-to-day
operational matters, including:
* Mr Michael Howard's intervention in an attempt to alter plans drawn
up by the Prison Service following the escape from Whitemoor last year.
* Delays induced by the ''repeated personal involvement'' of Mr Howard
or his agents in recruiting a personnel director for the Prison Service,
which caused or contributed to a delay of one and a half years before
the post was filled.
* Instructions from Mr Howard to Mr Lewis requiring him to make public
statements ''highly critical'' of action by the Prison Officers'
Association.
* A requirement to attend on average once a day with Mr Howard at the
Home Office headquarters to discuss operational matters.
* Pressure on Mr Lewis by Mr Howard to increase the severity of
internal disciplinary action.
* The ''extreme and unjustified'' pressure exerted by Mr Howard on Mr
Lewis on January 10 this year to suspend the former governor of
Parkhurst Prison rather than move him to another non-operational post,
as Mr Lewis had decided to do on operational grounds.
The pressure included a suggestion that Mr Howard would consider
over-ruling Mr Lewis if he did not comply.
* A requirement by Mr Howard that Mr Lewis delay urgently needed
operational restructuring of area manager arrangements.
* The ''failure'' of Mr Howard to provide extra resources to avoid
delay in the implementation of the Woodcock security recommendations
following the Whitemoor escape, despite assurances given to the Commons.
* The ''failure'' by Mr Howard to devote sufficient time to policy
proposals to introduce greater restrictions on home leave, resulting in
a year's delay before policy changes were announced.
* A ''refusal'' by Mr Howard this summer to allow the service to
reduce the number of prisons holding Category A prisoners in order to
improve security and reduce costs.
The writ said Mr Lewis had accordingly suffered loss and damage.

<HEADLINE>Howard's way to Tory tears. Conference rapture turns to despair as jail storm breaks</HEADLINE>

THE heady excitement of the Tory conference in Blackpool last week,
the glowing smiles of Ministers and the raptures of the party faithful,
all seemed light years away yesterday.
Within 72 hours of the return of Parliament from the summer recess,
the Government found itself plunged deep into a new embarrassment with
Home Secretary Michael Howard beleaguered by calls for his resignation.
Ministers were shocked, not just by the speed and ferocity with which
the prisons controversy hit them early this week, but by the way the
issue now threatens to haunt them for weeks to come.
With legal procedures now invoked by Mr Derek Lewis, the dismissed
head of the Prison Service, against the Home Secretary, there is little
prospect that the matter will quickly disappear.
Fortunately for Mr Howard, the crisis has not -- not yet anyway --
attracted hostility from his own back benches, and he at least enjoys
the publicly stated support of the Prime Minister.
Even so, the quality of the Home Secretary's response to today's
Labour-inspired debate in the Commons -- present indications are he will
take part -- will decide whether he can maintain the full backing of the
party in the House of Commons.
For there are Tory MPs who privately, so far, regard the manner in
which the Home Office has handled the prison service over the past few
years as being somewhat short of perfection.
So far, Mr Howard has mounted an impressive case for his own defence
on why he believed he was right to sack Mr Lewis, and the Prime Minister
effectively endorsed that during Commons exchanges on Tuesday.
But this has not been the only problem which the resumption of
Parliament has visited on the Government.
Ministers had to suffer the humiliation of defector Alan Howarth
taking his seat on the Opposition benches amid crowing Labour MPs.
Mr Michael Heseltine's initial question time as Deputy Prime Minister
was in part disrupted by the furore surrounding Mr Howarth's arrival in
the chamber.
Mr Howard, now in the doldrums, was one of the most successful
Ministers at the party conference.
His buoyant performance, announcing longer prison sentences for
criminals, won over conference-goers and he secured the longest and
loudest ovation, excluding the Prime Minister, but including Baroness
Thatcher.
However, his new plans were swiftly attacked by the Lord Chief Justice
-- a sharp reminder to the Home Secretary that pleasing a Tory
conference is one thing, while winning over those who can wreck your
policies is quite another.
The present Home Secretary is used to crises and clashes with judges,
the House of Lords, and senior police officers. This threat, however,
seems more grave than the previous ones. But Mr Howard is an old hand, a
precise and sometimes devastating debater, and the immediate signs are
that he will win through.
Even so, whatever the rights and wrongs are, the issue has certainly
left an unpleasant impression that Mr Howard is out to save his own
skin, a feeling which does little to enhance an unpopular Government.
But the last thing the Prime Minister wants now is a Cabinet
resignation, which would produce an even worse impression of disarray
and incompetence at the helm.
No doubt if the head of the Prison Service had been a lifelong civil
servant and not a business executive from outside, he would meekly have
accepted his dismissal and the trouble would soon be forgotten. And it
is Mr Howard's misfortune that that has not happened.
No wonder, therefore, that this embattled Government, enjoying an
overall majority of only five in the Commons, votes for longer
parliamentary recesses than most of its predecessors. A sitting House
merely brings trouble in its wake.

<HEADLINE>Best-loved racehorse is buried on the winning line at Aintree, scene of three National triumphs. Red Rum, the moving spirit of racing</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE world of racing was yesterday mourning the death of the legendary
Red Rum, Britain's best-loved racehorse and three times Grand National
champion.
The 30-year-old has been buried on the winning line at Aintree, scene
of the world's greatest steeplechase. He won it an unprecedented three
times in the 1970s.
Since retiring from racing, Red Rum lived at the stables of trainer
Ginger McCain in Cholmondeley, Cheshire, where he was put down at 8am
today.
Mr McCain said: ''We're all very sad. The old lad has had a wonderful
life and been a marvellous friend.''
He said it was appropriate for the horse, which had been part of his
family for 23 years, to be buried at Aintree.
Red Rum won the Grand National in 1973, 1974, and 1977, and was
runner-up twice. A permanent memorial to him will be erected at
Liverpool's famous Aintree course.
Red Rum's vet, John Burgess, said: ''For a short time Red Rum had not
been himself. This morning I was called to his stable and found him in a
distressed state, obviously very weak and showing signs of circulatory
failure.
''In consultation with Mr McCain, it was decided immediately to put
him to sleep in his own box at Cholmondeley stables.''
Red Rum, who was making regular public appearances until recently,
became a legend when he won the world's greatest steeplechase an
unprecedented three times and was second twice.
This record has never been seriously challenged and made him one of
the most famous horses in the world.
Aintree managing director Charles Barnett said: ''Red Rum has been an
integral part of the Grand National's history and has been here at
Aintree racecourse on Grand National day from 1973, when he first ran in
and won the race, until 1994.
''He was particularly important to Aintree in its dark days and has
ever since been an inspiration to many.
''Red Rum had the best record of any horse round the Grand National
course. He made a public appearance at Aintree on May 3 this year to
celebrate his 30th birthday and many of his fans came to Aintree to
admire him.''
Fans around the world held their breath when Red Rum came within hours
of being put down in January 1992, after suffering colic.
However his fighting spirit saw him through as well-wishers sent
hundreds of cards and messages to his stables.
This year, for the first time since he retired, he did not lead out
the parade of runners and riders before the start of the big race.
He began his remarkable winning run over Aintree's gruelling
4[1/2]-mile, 30-fence challenge in 1973.
He pipped Crisp to the post that year and a year later triumphed at
the expense of L'Escargot. He was runner-up for the next two years
before securing his place in history by winning again in 1977.
He is immortalised by a life-sized bronze statue at Aintree, and this
year an evening meeting was held there at which every race was dedicated
to him.
Mr McCain moved to ''Rummy's'' retirement home stables on a 190-acre
farm in 1991. He once said that in all the horse's hundreds of
appearances, he had only once kicked someone.
That was a policeman, who took it well, saying: ''If you're going to
be kicked, it might as well be by Red Rum.''
Tommy Stack, the jockey who rode Red Rum to the third of his Grand
National victories, said: ''I am sad to hear the news and feel
particularly sorry for Ginger McCain. It will be a big loss to him.
''The National win was a great day for me but he was already an
Aintree legend when I rode him.''
Stack said that on the night of the 1977 National ''the horse was
invited into a hotel in Southport -- and proceeded to walk up the steps
and into the lobby for a drink''.
Lester Piggott, who rode ''Rummy'' to victory on the flat in 1967,
said: ''I am very sorry to hear of his death.
''He was a racing institution and stayed in our yard on more than one
occasion when he was been down to open betting shops in the area. It's a
very, very sad loss.''
Phil Harrison, Red Rum's stable lad in recent years, recalled: ''He's
been in lifts, up on to stages, shops, and supermarkets, and he's always
been brilliant with people.''
BBC racing commentator Peter O'Sullevan, behind the microphone for all
five of the horse's National appearances, said: ''It was one of the
privileges of one's life to have called Red Rum home to all his Aintree
victories but especially so when he landed the hat-trick.
''He had a number of trainers but was most fortunate to have come into
the sympathetic hands of Ginger McCain who could train him on Southport
sands.
''That was the ideal terrain for a horse who had leg problems,
problems that affected his career.''
Jenny Pitman, who trained 1983 National winner Corbiere and this
year's Aintree hero Royal Athlete, described Red Rum's death as the end
of an era.
''I think that he was a great servant to racing both on and off the
track,'' said Mrs Pitman.
''He was one of life's characters -- he'd been there and done it. It
is a sad day for all of us.''
Red Rum's domination of the Grand National captured the imagination of
the public and made him a household name.
His record in steeplechasing's greatest prize is second to none, with
an unprecedented three triumphs and runner-up in 1975 and 1976.
His courage, clever jumping technique, and bottomless stamina were all
formidable weapons which served him particularly well at Aintree.
Red Rum amassed #114,371 in first-prize money during his career,
record earnings for a jumper at the time.
He won 24 of his 100 races over jumps but always reserved his best
form for his favourite 30 fences at Aintree.
After starting his career on the flat, Red Rum eventually ended up at
Ginger McCain's stables. Racing for owner Noel Le Mare, he immediately
showed much-improved form, winning six of his nine races in the 1972-73
season, including his first National.
Partnered by Brian Fletcher, ''Rummy'', as he was affectionately
known, produced a storming finish to catch top-weight Crisp in the
shadow of the winning post, one of the most exciting of all Aintree
climaxes.
Twelve months later, at odds of 11-1, McCain's hero carried 12 stone
to victory over L'Escargot.
L'Escargot turned the tables in 1975, and Rag Trade beat him in 1976,
but the following year, Red Rum -- at the age of 12 -- made an emotional
return to the winner's enclosure.
Ridden by Tommy Stack, Red Rum earned his entry in the record books
with a 25-length victory from Churchtown Boy.
In doing so, he eclipsed the achievements of Reynoldstown, the only
other horse this century to have won two Grand Nationals at Aintree.
After finally being retired on the eve of the 1978 Grand National, Red
Rum was in constant demand for public appearances. His happiest moments,
perhaps, were parading each year in front of Aintree's stands before the
start of the four-and-a-half mile chase.

SKYE Bridge toll protesters met last night to discuss taking legal
action against the Skye Bridge Company after around 30 people were
charged following a blockade of the bridge on Tuesday.
A convoy of cars led by the Isle of Skye Pipe Band allegedly blocked
barriers for several hours before police intervened.
Following a meeting of Skye and Kyle Against the Tolls (Skat) in the
Tongadale Hotel in Portree last night, one organiser, Mr Andrew Millar,
said the group had appointed two lawyers, ''with a view to taking the
matter to the highest court possible''.
He added: ''A special meeting was called to allay the fears of some
protesters regarding charges resulting from Tuesday.
''Both civil and criminal actions are being considered by our legal
team.''
He said the group were planning a further ''freedom run'' at the
weekend, probably Saturday, at a time which would cause minimum
inconvenience to other travellers.

IN a dramatic political comeback, Mr Tom Clarke, MP for Monklands
West, last night regained the place in the Shadow Cabinet which he lost
last year.
The 54-year-old MP captured more than 20 extra votes to win the last
of the 19 Shadow Cabinet posts up for election by Labour MPs.
The other shock was the defeat of Dr Jack Cunningham, the Shadow Trade
and Industry Secretary, who has been in the Shadow Cabinet since 1983,
and was regarded as among its senior figures.
A lacklustre performance as Shadow Foreign Secretary caused his vote
to drop last year and he was unable to re-establish his position in his
new berth.
Sources close to Mr Blair, though, made it clear that he would be
given a senior post when portfolios were allocated today.
The poll was topped by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former acting leader
of the party after Mr John Smith died, who pushed Shadow Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook into second place.
Mrs Beckett is to be moved into Dr Cunningham's job at trade and
industry secretary.
David Blunkett is to have employment added to his education portfolio
to mirror the Government which has merged the two departments.
Harriet Harman, whose employment job will thus disappear, is to be
offered the health job.
The one post so far decided is that of chief whip which will go to
Donald Dewar, who holds the social security brief which will be given to
Chris Smith.
Mr Clarke's return caused much surprise, not least among some of his
Scottish colleagues still critical of his initial defence of Monklands
council during last year's difficult by-election.
Mr Clarke was Shadow Scottish Secretary from 1992 to 1993 after
springing his first Shadow Cabinet surprise by gaining a place as an
outsider.
His work on disability issues has won him support among Labour MPs.
However, the failure of the parliamentary party to elect several
younger MPs caused some within the Labour ranks to suggest that the
system of a Shadow Cabinet elected by their colleagues should be
scrapped.

UNION officials have raised fears of job losses and a downturn in pay
at Canniesburn Hospital following the award of a contract to private
bidders in favour an in-house tender which had been ''cut to the bone''.
The contract for so-called hotel services covers the duties of
domestics, catering, and portering.
Documents passed to The Herald show that the in-house bid of #719,262
would result in some job losses and a reduction in working hours for
other members of staff at the Bearsden hospital.
The board of Glasgow Royal Infirmary University NHS Trust awarded the
contract to Surrey-based company Initial Healthcare Services for a lower
figure two weeks ago. Now, around 100 staff will be forced to re-apply
for their jobs.
Union officials are due to meet representatives from Initial
Healthcare and hospital staff today in what could be a stormy meeting.
Mr Jim Devine, regional officer of the health union Unison, said that
any bid lower than the in-house tender would have an even greater impact
on staff.
He added: ''I am absolutely appalled that loyal health service workers
are being treated in what I believe is an immoral way. This is
exploitation of low-paid workers who are being asked to bid for their
jobs back with the risk that they will face worse pay and conditions of
service.
''We understand that the local management at Canniesburn cut staff
costs back to the bone for the in-house bid. I also understand they were
equally as surprised at us that it had gone elsewhere. I don't know how
a bid could be lower than theirs and not adversely affect staff.
''I will be seeking detailed information about pay and conditions for
staff.''
Industrial action was averted in May last year after a dispute over
the transfer of pay and conditions for 380 porters and cleaners at
Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Unions claimed that the successful bidder,
Executive Healthcare, planned to cut wages.
Initial was also at the centre of a row over the transfer of pay and
conditions last year. A group of cleaners from an Essex hospital won a
legal challenge after being made redundant by Initial after the company
lost out on a health contract. The workers were paid redundancy money
and nearly all staff were taken on by the new company, Pall Mall
Services, but on less favourable terms. The Court of Appeal backed legal
challenges against both companies.
GMB regional industrial officer Robert Parker said the union hoped to
avoid a repetition of the bitter dispute with the infirmary.
He said the union would give Initial an opportunity to discuss their
plans for Canniesburn before taking any action.
A statement from Initial said the firm could not make any comment on
the running of the contract or the cost of their bid.
However, they could not rule out changes to the contract, which
includes staffing and running the hospital.
A spokesman for the infirmary said both Initial and the in-house
bidders had been on a shortlist of three. The cost of the contract had
originally been put at #774,000.
The three-year contract begins in January next year.

MEMBERS of Glasgow's gay community are considering forming their own
protection force following a spate of attacks which culminated in the
murder of homosexual Michael Doran in the city's Queen's Park in June.
Homosexuals using the park as a meeting place believe police are not
interested in a growing number of assaults on gay people in the city.
''The feeling within the community is that if we have one more death
we will have to take the matter into our own hands, launching something
like London's Guardian Angels,'' said one homosexual who was attacked
last week.
''Of course, there are problems with the whole vigilante thing but
something has to be done and the police are doing nothing.''
Mr Doran, 35, was stamped, kicked, and stabbed to death in Queen's
Park on June 2 this year by a gang on a gay-bashing rampage. Two other
men were assaulted the same night.
Homosexuals who frequent the park say assaults are common, often to
extort money, and it was only a matter of time before someone lost their
life.
Since the jailing of four youths for the Doran murder, there have been
reports of retaliatory attacks against homosexuals in the city.
However, a senior officer for Strathclyde Police F Division, which
covers Queen's Park, has told The Herald that they do not believe there
is a problem with gay bashing and has dismissed suggestions that a gay
liaison officer should be appointed.
Lothian and Borders Police is the only Scottish force which has a gay
liaison officer.
The liaison officer, Detective Inspector Willie Manson, said his role
was to break down barriers and establish strong links within the gay
community.
''It is to address the gay community,'' he said. ''It's trying to
allay their fears and provide a service to them.''
Nationally, gay activists say attacks against homosexuals are on the
rise, although it is almost impossible to draw up figures because police
forces do not keep such statistics.
Mr Dominic d'Angelo, of Gay Scotland, said he has come across the
vigilante sentiment before amongst the gay community but believed that
change would come about only through a broader campaign against police
handling of the problem.
A conference to discuss policing and the gay community will be held in
Manchester early next month. Lothian and Borders Police will be
attending and it is understood Strathclyde Police are trying to find a
representative.

<HEADLINE>High levels of toxic waste found in Loch Lomond</HEADLINE>

Toxic waste in Loch Lomond.
High levels of toxic petrol
waste, mostly from speedboats, have been found for the first time in
Loch Lomond by Glasgow University scientists.
The preliminary research finding has worried Scottish Natural Heritage
which has agreed to fund continued study.
The benzine poisons from petrol have been found in concentrations
which wipe out planktonic life in localised areas, with unknown
long-term effects on the food chain.
It is the first time such a finding has been made in Scotland, adding
a new dimension to the debate over the health of the loch as speedboat
sports increasingly exclude less damaging types of water use.
Proposed by-laws are bitterly opposed by water ski and speedboat
interests, led by the Scottish Sports Council.
While the scientists remain firmly distanced from those issues, The
Herald has been told by Dr Colin Adams, the director of the university's
Rowardennan field station on the loch, that the levels of toxic
hydrocarbons from outboard engines in certain spots and at peak times on
Loch Lomond are exceeding the maximum levels recommended by the EU and
in the US.
The UK has set a much lower standard but the levels of toxicity at hot
spots such as The Narrows -- the passage between Inchtavannich,
Inchconnachan, and Inchmoan -- and off Balmaha Pier exceed even that.
The research takes on further significance in the light of another
study made by the same team which shows a continuing growth in the
numbers of craft using Loch Lomond but with a very large swing towards
speedboats.
These have increased by 60% since the scientists did their first
survey in 1989. Last year, for the first time, more than 500 craft were
counted in one day.
Mr John Burliston, of Scottish Natural Heritage's Clydebank office,
said yesterday: ''The research has surprised us as much as the
scientists. We did not expect there to be any significant residue
recorded but, having found it, we are interested and concerned.
''It may be that there is cause for concern and it may be that there
is not. The bottom line is we need to know.''
Dr Adams said scientists had identified the cocktail of toxic
chemicals coming from outboard engines. Most of the chemicals are
highly-toxic benzines or benzine compounds from petrol.
Using studies from the American Environmental Pollution Agency and
applying them to their own knowledge of boat type and daily usage on
Loch Lomond, the Rowardennan scientists were able to calculate that an
estimated 30 tons of hydrocarbon toxins were being discharged annually
into the loch, close on two thirds of that from speedboats.
Using an international standard for measuring the toxicity of
chemicals, they were then able to apply this to particular plankton on
Loch Lomond and arrived at a safe level of exposure. It was armed with
this detailed knowledge that they made the surprise findings of
concentrated poisonous pollution.
Dr Adams says: ''The real down side of this is that there are bigger
and heavier fractions of hydrocarbon discharge which are less volatile
and will not evaporate or disappear but which will concentrate in the
sediments and enter the food chain.
''We do not know whether we have lost all the plankton in one area
over a short period.''

Labour turns the screw and drags Forsyth into prison row
HOME Secretary Michael Howard will today face demands for his
dismissal as Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is dragged into the
furore over the running of the Prison Service.
Labour will call for Mr Howard's resignation when the Commons debates
the prison service south of the Border. Mr Howard also faces legal
action form Mr Derek Lewis, the sacked director general of the Prison
Service, who is suing him, claiming wrongful dismissal.
In another development last night, Mr Forsyth, a former Home Office
Minister, was being linked to the accusations levelled by Mr Lewis.
Labour leader Tony Blair is still undecided as to whether the
Opposition should launch a censure motion on the Home Secretary which
the Prime Minister would have to accept and give Government time for
debate.
Mr Blair will assess the situation after they have tested Mr Howard
and his support on the Tory back benches.
Mr Forsyth was at the Home Office at the time of the series of
embarrassing prison escapes at Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight and at
Whitemore, where IRA prisoners were able to store explosives and
weapons.
Labour alleges that both Mr Howard and Mr Forsyth involved themselves
in the prisons' inquiry being conducted by Sir John Learmont, which has
led to the sacking of Mr Lewis who is now suing the Home Secretary for
wrongful dismissal.
Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, yesterday
claimed that Mr Forsyth was directly interfering.
He said: ''This action might suggest that Howard and Forsyth are
hand-in-glove in this affair.''
The official Learmont report states that during an inquiry Mr Lewis
was ''disturbed on a number of occasions because Ministers required his
advice''.
This may be used by Labour today in the Commons to try to build up a
case against the Home Secretary.
Mr Howard claims that when he told the Commons on January 10 that he
did not interfere in the day-to-day running of the Prison Service he not
was misleading the House of Commons.
The Home Secretary has the personal backing of the Prime Minister and
his Cabinet colleagues and Tory MPs are not in the mood to undermine Mr
Howard. So the prospect of his resignation is small.
His future depends on whether Labour can pin him down as having
seriously misled the Commons. This would need startling new evidence to
shake the Tory Party and last night this seemed unlikely.
However, Mr Howard is ready to issue a ''put up or shut up'' challenge
to Labour over pledges -- so far unfulfilled -- to produce evidence to
back up claims of unwarranted interference.
The potential for embarrassment was significantly heightened by Mr
Lewis aiming a penetrating thrust at Mr Howard's defence against any
personal responsibility for the Parkhurst escapes.
The Home Secretary's strategy -- to distinguish between ministerial
accountability for policy and management responsibiliy for operational
matters -- was undermined by Mr Lewis alleging in his writ that Mr
Howard had exerted ''extreme and unjustified'' pressure on him to
suspend former Parkhurst governor, Mr John Marriott.
However, senior Tory sources dismissed the writ issued by Mr Lewis as
a ''press release'' which carried little weight in law.
Tory sources said the Government had already offered to meet the key
demand of the writ -- compensation for dismissal.
Mr Howard is said to be deeply angry at a series of what he sees as
unsubstantiated accusations made against him by Mr Blair at Question
Time on Tuesday.
The Home Secretary is expected to attempt to knock down one by one the
allegations made by Mr Blair in what was being described as a ''very
robust'' response to his critics.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said Mr Howard's position was
''untenable''.
''We have the clearest evidence that, contrary to what he has told the
House of Commons in the past, he did interfere with one operation
decision and attempted seriously to interfere with another,'' he said.
Mr Howard's resignation was demanded by Liberal Democrat home affairs
spokesman Alan Beith.
Mr Howard could not persist with the line that he kept the Prison
Service at arms length, Mr Beith said.
''There is now such a cloud over Mr Howard's dealings with the Prison
Service and his refusal to take responsibility in the House of Commons,
that it should be clear to both him and the Prime Minister that he ought
not to remain in office.''
A Downing Street spokesman, however, reiterated that Mr Howard had the
full support of the Prime Minister.
The Home Office issued a statement which said the Home Secretary
planned a vigorous defence of his handling of the affair.
''The Home Secretary looks forward to the opportunity of rebutting
allegations made against him this week in tomorrow's debate.
''He will emphasise that he has acted entirely properly within the
terms of the framework document governing the relationship with the
Prison Service agency.''
The statement continued: ''In his writ, Mr Lewis seeks compensation
for breach of contract.
''As the Home Secretary made clear in the House on October 16, the
question of compensation is a matter for negotiation. The letter
terminating Mr Lewis's employment made it clear that lawyers had been
asked to look at the question of Mr Lewis's compensation.
''The extensive paperwork released by Mr Lewis today demonstrates the
ample opportunity he was given to present his response to the Learmont
report.
''The Home Secretary had to choose between that response and Sir John
Learmont's independent report.
''That report contained devastating criticisms of leadership and
management within the Prison Service. Accepting the broad thrust of Sir
John's report, the Home Secretary concluded that Mr Lewis's position was
untenable.''
Now that writs have been issued against the Home Secretary by Mr
Lewis, Speaker Betty Boothroyd will have to decide this morning how far
the Commons can go into the detail of the affair.
Mr Blair will have to take her decision into account before he decides
whether to pursue a demand for the Home Secretary's resignation --
possibly by forcing a censure motion next week.
The pressure on Mr Howard was increased by the resignation from the
Prisons Board, the service's managing body, of non-executive director
Geoffrey Keeys, who said he was going because the Home Secretary had
failed to respond to his backing of Mr Lewis.
Mr Keeys said in his resignation letter to Mr Richard Tilt, acting
director general of the Prison Service: ''I believe strongly that it was
in the best interest of the service that Derek Lewis remain as director
general.''
Another non-executive board member, Ms Urmila Banerjee, said she was
considering resignation.
A third non-executive board member, Mr Bill Bentley, said he would not
be resigning but expressed his support for Mr Lewis.
