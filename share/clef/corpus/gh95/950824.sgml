SCOTTISH Midland Co-operative Society will create more than 200 jobs
in Dundee when it reopens the former Norco Superstore next year.
Commercial services manager Hollis Smallman said the 52,000 sq ft
superstore in Main Street, Hilltown will become Scotmid's largest retail
outlet when it reopens in April.
The supermarket has been closed since its former owner, the Northern
Co-operative Society, was liquidated in 1993.
Mr Smallman said Scotmid was spending ''a substantial sum'' on
acquiring and refitting the superstore, which will concentrate on food
sales.
Scotmid operates a chain of 53 supermarkets in Central Scotland and
made a #2.9m surplus before tax last year on turnover of #130m.

A MAN appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, following a siege
in a house on Tuesday. Mr David Kerr, 30, of Drumby Crescent, Clarkston,
is accused of assaulting nine police officers in the execution of their
duty, by threatening them with an imitation handgun.
He is also charged with assaulting his mother Jeanette Kerr at that
address by punching her on the face, knocking her to the ground, and
compressing her throat with his hands. Other charges allege he conducted
himself in a disorderly manner and committed a breach of peace and that
he was in possession of an imitation firearm with intent to resist
arrest. He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody.

NEARLY 250 years after Bonnie Prince Charlie fled to Skye, the island
is enjoying a new invasion.
Following years of decline, it now boasts the fastest-growing
population in the Highlands, it is revealed today.
It is a complete turn-around from the days when the island was losing
thousands of its young people, attracted to jobs and prosperity in
Scotland's mainland towns and cities.
The population, down to slightly more than 7000 only 15 years ago has
risen to nearly 12,000, according to new figures published today.
Now new companies on the island cannot take on employees quickly
enough.
Writer and historian Dr Jim Hunter said: ''Skye and Lochalsh is no
longer the depopulating and declining locality which it once was.
''It is a place where much is changing for the better -- culturally
and socially as well as economically.''

THE popularity of traditional Highland Games, with the colour and
nimbleness of the dancers, the skill of the pipers in march and reel,
the keen competition in athletics, and the sound and spectacle of the
pipe bands, is not just a Scottish enthusiasm.
Nowhere will that be better illustrated than this weekend at Dunoon,
when the most spectacular games of them all -- the Cowal Highland
Gathering -- enters its second century. The event always attracts a huge
entry from overseas: this year the number of Canadian, American and
Australian competitors is almost double that in 1994.
The two days of the Cowal Gathering are contrasting but also
complementary. Friday, August 25 sees the senior solo piping events but
is otherwise a day for the younger competitors and their families.
Almost 300 young dancers will contest the Scottish Premier Championships
in all age groups from under nine to 15 years.
On Saturday, pipe band competitions start at 9.30am with a record
entry of 153 bands. Grade one bands will be competing for the
prestigious Argyll Shield, designed and presented to Cowal by Queen
Victoria's daughter Princess Louise 90 years ago and one of the most
coveted awards in the bands' world.
On the dancing platforms 140 dancers will dispute the world titles for
juvenile, junior and adult age-groups and with the huge overseas entry
our national stars face a strong challenge.
Cowal always attracts a strong field for the traditional heavy
throwing events. This year -- for the first time since the 1980s --
track athletics are being reintroduced with an attractive programme for
which entries can be accepted on the day.
The climax of Cowal Highland Gathering, which first ensured its
world-wide reputation, is the astonishing sight and sound of the March
Past, assembly and playing of the massed bands, this year almost 3000
pipes and drums, which closes events in the stadium on Saturday. It is
unique to Cowal and, once seen and heard, never forgotten -- as
thousands who pour into the stadium every year to thrill to it will
testify.
Admission is #2 on Friday and #4 on Saturday for adults, half-price
for children: one of the greatest entertainment bargains in the country
for one of the greatest spectacles in the country.

THE Cowal peninsula -- which gives its name to the famous gathering --
is the traditional western gateway to the Highlands. More than that, it
is itself a perfect miniature of the Highlands, just an hour from
Glasgow city centre.
For generations Cowal and its capital Dunoon have been popular holiday
destinations. In the days of the steamer fleets most visitors came from
Central Scotland -- perhaps enjoying a traditional Glasgow Fair
fortnight, perhaps taking the popular day-excursion ''doon the watter''.
Nowadays most visitors travel by car or coach and increasingly they
come from farther afield. A surprising number of our own countrymen just
don't realise the extent or the intensity of the jewel on Glasgow's
doorstep.
Regular ferry services land cars and foot-passengers on the
Argyllshire shore at Dunoon, a bustling, confident town with fine hotels
and guest houses stretching along the shores of the firth to either
side. A few miles inland, past Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore with
its stunning collection of rhododendrons (more than 250 species) and its
magnificent avenues of soaring Douglas firs, lies Loch Eck. This is the
perfect coming together of loch and mountain scenery, a narrow cut of
clearest water mirroring steep summits and tree-clad hillsides soaring
to either side, with a quiet road clinging to the shoreline.
At Strachur the road branches to follow the shores of Loch Fyne, north
towards Glasgow or south through the wild beauty of Glendaruel to the
sheltered waters of the celebrated Kyles of Bute. For long the Kyles
capital Tighnabruaich was the most popular destination for steamer trips
from Glasgow. Today the area is a world-reputed water sports centre.
Experienced yachtsmen come from far afield to enjoy the superb setting,
while novices hone their skills at the Kyles sailing schools.
Beyond Tighnabruaich a newly established ferry service from Portavadie
across Loch Fyne to Tarbert opens up a whole new series of excursions
and offers a variety of round-trip possibilities for day-visitors and
stay-visitors alike.
One of the strengths of Cowal is that it combines a comprehensive and
top-quality range of services with a real sense of the remote, the
unspoiled and the uncrowded Highlands. An imaginative and user-friendly
tourist board is on hand to guide visitors to the most popular
attractions and instil a sense of the community's history, its wildlife,
and its natural beauty.

THE Taylor Report on safety in football grounds was published in 1988
and the face of our national game was changed overnight. The old ritual
of standing at the match was doomed from that moment on, if not from the
tragedy at Hillsborough which, in part, prompted the report.
Recognising this greater emphasis on safety, Celtic Football Club's
concern with its proposed new stand was to commission a building from
which 26,000 fans could enjoy the match, and leave in safety in as short
a time as possible in the event of an emergency.
That Miller Construction's design team came up with a blueprint which
allowed the same number of spectators to exit in around six minutes
speaks volumes about their dedication to the task.
Minimal crowding and ease of access lies at the heart of thinking on
safety in football grounds, and to this end the construction company
built many wide walkways offering plenty of space between groups of
rows, and literally hundreds of entrance and exit doors to and from the
seats and the many executive boxes running the length of the stand. It
also built 12ft-wide access walkways underneath the stand for people to
approach their tier, before ascending to their seats.
Fire doors placed at regular intervals are held open by
electro-magnets which, in event of a fire, are activated to seal smoke
or flames in a confined zone in the same way as a ship's bulkhead, while
still allowing free passage to people leaving the area.
A complex web of security cameras offer complete surveillance and the
attention to detail runs to the multitude of snack bar and refreshment
areas having rounded crash bars to minimise the possibility of an
accident. The same is true of the stair wells, where a minimum height
clearance of two metres is observed throughout.
Working in close conjunction with the ground safety committee; an
amalgam of experts including police and fire brigade officers, ambulance
services, Glasgow District Council Building Control and Architects
Department, and a committee comprised of Glasgow district councillors,
the company took on board advice and directives. The results now speak
for themselves.
Close co-operation and consultation has become something of a byword
for Miller Construction as its preferred method of business is a
partnering technique whereby Miller and its client remain aware at all
times of each other's requirements.
Though the new stand towers above, and is an inspiration to everything
in the entire East End of the city, it is also among the safest in the
country and deserves to become a landmark to a new, more responsible,
game of football in Scotland.
All of which will be a pleasant prospect to site project manager Liam
Hanlon. For the man responsible for keeping the Parkhead project on
schedule, renewed his season ticket in the south stand earlier this
year.
Now he and Miller Construction are hoping for the green light to go
ahead with the renewal of both ends of the stadium, which will put the
finishing touches on Celtic fans' return to their beloved Heaven on
Earth.

REBUILDING Paradise was always going to be a tall order. Dante's
vision apart, more temporal concerns dictated that the rebirth of
Parkhead would be done in the glare of the publicity, on a very tight
schedule, and be of the highest quality. The Celtic faithful were
acutely aware of another superb stadium in the west of the city. Only
the best of design, materials, and finish would satisfy.
But Edinburgh-based Miller Construction had already designed and
completed the all-seated McDiarmid Park for St Johnstone to praise from
all comers in the construction industry and football fans alike. Nor is
the company unused to media attention, its civil engineering arm is
currently completing the Skye Bridge. Elsewhere the Miller group, as a
whole, has gained a reputation for bringing a project in ahead of
schedule and on budget, as recent contracts with IBM near Greenock and
the Royal Mail testify.
Perhaps unsurprisingly then, the group is heading for a very healthy
turnover of #360m this year.
Miller had had a weather eye on developments at the stadium in
Glasgow's East End for some time and had submitted a speculative
feasibility plan for an all-seated ground while it was being run by the
previous regime at Parkhead.
With the club now under the control of Fergus McCann, the tendering
process gathered momentum and it became clear that Miller was the
preferred company whose bid met the tight parameters required by the new
powers that be at the club.
In March 1994 a further feasibility study was drawn up and submitted,
this time to Fergus McCann, and the ball was swiftly rolling.
Miller proposed to design and build a new all-seated stand on the site
of ''The Jungle'', the old enclosure which was home to many of the most
vocal and vociferous of the Celtic support.
Having gone through detailed design and planning applications, work
actually started on-site only in November last year. And, having
demolished both ends and the enclosure, some serious preparatory work
was called for before construction could begin.
It was already known that old mine workings existed underneath
Parkhead. This meant driving nearly 2500 bore holes into the soil before
pumping in 25,500 tonnes of grout to stabilise the site.
That completed, 13.5 miles of pre-cast concrete foundation piling was
sunk before the first of the steel and terrace units could arrive at the
ground.
The pace of construction and the sheer height and angle of the stand
meant that pouring in-situ concrete was out of the question. Instead
Miller employed pre-cast concrete units to build upon the remaining
first few feet of the original enclosure.
Half-a-dozen huge cranes were called in to lift the first few units
into place. Slowly at first, then gathering momentum, the giant jigsaw
puzzle began to take shape.
In all, some eight miles of pre-cast concrete seating units went into
the stand and, despite working through one of the wettest winters in
recent years, followed by this summer's freakishly hot weather, the team
managed to stay on schedule.
Perhaps the worst of the weather was the high winds during the winter
months. These affected the operations of the big cranes on which the
project depended. But despite the gales, work continued wherever and
whenever possible. Miller was further challenged by a constraint arising
from the surrounding area.
The company was contractually bound to avoid any interference with the
Eastern Necropolis cemetery lying behind Janefield Street, the narrow
road running behind the new stand. With the design of the cantilevered
roof overhanging the cemetery by some nine metres, scaffolding had to be
suspended from the structure itself, rather than built up from the
ground, to allow work on the roof to proceed.
Apart from its impressively clean lines, the cantilever design of the
roof minimises the need for props underneath the roof, meaning very few
seats with a restricted view of the pitch. This vista is further
enhanced by a guttering system employing two downpipes in the entire
stand. Miller used a system where syphonic action actively sucks
rainwater from the gutters to either downpipe and down to ground level,
in much the same way as petrol is drawn from a car tank.
While the roof decking and guttering was being fixed into place, a
mammoth plumbing and electrical job was taking place within the
structure.
Almost 1600 seats in the middle of the stand are electrically heated
to allow fans to brave the worst of winter. Coupled to this are the
miles of cabling for security cameras, interior lighting, and
floodlights on to the park, plus facilities for the snack bars placed at
regular intervals under the stand.
Tony McGuinness (Contracts) Ltd were delighted to be called in to
carry out the joinery work to the new stand. A deal which delighted both
parties, as McGuinness had previously carried out alterations to the
south stand in 1988.
After a final brush down and tidy up, the stand was officially opened
on August 5, and Celtic's managing director Fergus McCann's thoughts on
the project are testimony to the quality and pace of both Miller
Construction and the club's achievement at Parkhead.
''Celtic Park opened on August 5 for the match against Newcastle with
a capacity of 31,000. We are delighted with the progress of the work
achieved by Miller Construction, so much so that we have invited the 300
workers on the project to attend as guests of the club in recognition of
their good work. Miller Construction has to be commended for achieving
what is a 15-month project in the space of 40 weeks. An additional 3340
seats will be opened before the first competitive match, which may be
August 30.''

GLASGOW'S prime office rents are set to rise in the near future, warns
a leading property consultant. Although work has started on three major
new schemes which will bring more than 300,000 sq ft of new space to the
city by 1997, the acute shortage of current top-class accommodation
means that short-term rental increases are inevitable, according to
property consultants Grimley.
The firm's latest quarterly market bulletin says that some sectors of
Scotland's property market are performing well, particularly central
belt office developments.
The three new Glasgow schemes will provide 85,000 sq ft at Ashley
House, 100,000 sq ft at Alhambra House, and 130,000 sq ft at the second
phase of Atlantic Quay.
Development is also firing ahead in Edinburgh, but is mainly led by
occupiers such as Scottish Widows, Standard Life and Scottish Equitable
who are building new accommodation for their own use.
Outside of the city centres demand for business park space ramains
strong, with recent lettings at Cumbernauld's Broadwood scheme,
Glasgow's Academy Park, and Bellshill's Strathclyde Business Park. Rents
are moving upwards, with the latest lettings achieving around #13 per sq
ft.
Grimley's regional managing partner, Andy Carswell, says: ''The
Scottish property market is beginning to show certain optimistic signs,
particularly in the office sector. The scarcity of quality office
accommodation reflects the prices being paid and is making speculative
developments on many of the business parks all the more attractive for
developers.''
The retail warehouse market is similarly buoyant, with tenants keen to
secure premises before new planning guidelines from the Scottish Office
restrict out-of-town retail schemes. The most recent lettings have
achieved more than #18 per sq ft.
In contrast, the industrial market is still sluggish, and the
investment sector has been inactive for the last three months. ''With
the possibility of increased interest rates, developers may be wary and
this might have a dramatic impact on the Scottish property market,''
warns Carswell.
Meanwhile, there has been a strong revival in new bank lending to the
commercial property sector, according to Money Into Property 1995,
published by property advisers DTZ Debenham Thorpe.
The report estimates that, excluding clearing banks, around #3 billion
of additional lending will be available for pumping into property
projects, some of which will be available north of the border.
Richard Kwiecinski, chairman of DTZ Debenham Thorpe (Scotland) said:
''Scotland has seen an increase in property lending by banks over the
last year due to relaxed lending criteria, coupled with a reduction in
medium to long term interest rates. These changes should encourage
investors, particularly property companies.
He believes that banks have put the worst experiences of the recession
behind them and are actively seeking to renew their relationship with
property developers.

'This was a night when the Rangers players had to dig in for victory,
and carry the clock forward to an autumn of expectation.'
Anorthosis 0, Rangers 0 (Agg: 0-1)
RANGERS are back where they, and their support, believe they belong --
among the elite of European football.
This 0-0 draw watched by a crowd of 12,000 on a heat-laden Cyprus
night was enough to carry them into the Champions' League and confirmed
the view of manager Walter Smith that not having conceded a goal to the
Cypriot champions was vital in the first leg two weeks ago.
This was a night ridden with nerves, fraught with tension, and the
Scottish champions aimed for the #6m jackpot which is guaranteed for all
Champions' League qualifiers.
It was not a night for glamour, not a night which will be remembered
for glorious football or brilliant skills.
This was a night when the Rangers players had to dig in for victory,
and carry the clock forward to an autumn of expectation.
They did so.
And now the Ibrox support can look forward to the real glamour of
Europe when the draw is made for the Champions' League tomorrow.
There were dangerous moments -- as there always are in Europe -- but
goalkeeper Andy Goram, obviously mentally attuned, dealt superbly with
the Cypriot attempts on goal.
And there were moments at the other end when Rangers could have killed
the match by scoring the away goal which would have ended the Cypriots'
fading hopes.
It was a controlled performance from the Scottish champions. Goram had
two splendid saves, Richard Gough was superb at the heart of the
defence, Gordan Petric made a convincing European debut, and the night
may be remembered as the one when young Charlie Miller grew up.
The Castlemilk kid tackled fiercely, might have scored twice, and,
while he failed to provide a final lethal touch, he demonstrated that he
was in the team by right.
Yet, this Ibrox side had been struck by injury beforehand, and then
cruelly hit once more in 25 minutes.
Brian Laudrup had been left at home, and suddenly out of nowhere, Paul
Gascoigne was forced to limp off to be replaced by Ian Durrant.
It was clearly the last thing manager Smith needed, a problem they
could not have anticipated. Yet, out of all the adversity, came the
result the club desperately wanted.
There is no doubt that Rangers would have liked to have scored, and
they went forward to do just that. However, their organisation and their
discipline were enough to thwart the Cypriot side.
They left the small stadium still questioning the decision of the
Hungarian referee, Laszlo Wagner, after only six minutes when Georgios
Panayi bodychecked Miller as he moved in menacingly on to a header from
Gordon Durie.
It was a foul, it was in the penalty box, but somehow the referee
ignored the claims, and waved play on. Rangers were left to try again.
Six minutes later, they were close when Stephen Wright found Gordon
Durie with a deep cross from the right flank, but the striker's header
dropped over the crossbar.
In 21 minutes Miller was unlucky when Hateley laid off a ball to him
and his shot was stopped by the keeper.
Gascoigne went off after 25 minutes, with Durrant taking his place,
and for a short spell Rangers lost some of their composure.
It was then that Goram restored the confidence to the side. In 29
minutes Demetrios Assiotis fired in a vicious low shot which the keeper,
with perfect timing, blocked with his right foot.
Before half-time, Gordan Petric hit the defensive wall with a free
kick from 35 yards which flew for a corner as Mark Hateley almost
reached the ball.
In 54 minutes, Miller volleyed the ball over the bar and Rangers
continued to look comfortable despite the backing the Cypriots were
receiving from their support.
The Cypriots tried to change things as time began to run out on them.
Two substitutes appeared, Pounas for Assiotis and Thoma for Ignatov. It
made little difference to the flow of the game.
And as the end approached, it looked as if it was time for Ally
McCoist to come on in his super substitute's role. Walter Smith had left
him on the bench, knowing that he was Rangers' ace in the hole, if
things were not going right.
There was a moment when it seemed he would replace Gordon Durie as the
game edged towards injury time. But, by then, Durrant was limping and he
came off and Neil Murray went on.
Then, the game was over, and Gascoigne, who had suffered a groin
strain, danced on to the pitch to hug his team-mates, with a special
accolade for Goram.
Gascoigne clearly knew how much depended on this result last night. So
did the fans who had packed the terracing behind Goram's goal in the
second half.
And these same fans were praised for their behaviour. There were no
reported arrests before or during the match among the near 3000
contingent.
The mood among the fans was one of relief and joy as they began a
massive all-night party in the main resorts of the holiday island.

PARTICK Thistle chairman Jim Oliver has dismissed a radio report that
a take-over bid for the club was imminent as ''cheap, speculative talk''
and insisted that he had every reason to believe he would be in control
for the next four years at least.
''I am in the sixth year of a 10-year plan and we are going into the
next stage very excited at the prospects,'' he said.
The report suggested that a group of Asian businessmen had approached
Oliver, using MP George Galloway as their go-between, but Oliver said:
''I have not spoken to any Asian businessmen or any other businessmen
for that matter. The fact is that Partick Thistle is not for sale.''
But a Glasgow restaurateur said on BBC Radio Scotland that the Asian
community had approached the MP.
Galloway said: ''I have been in discussion with a number of Asians who
have been successful in business about the idea of taking a stake in the
club. There are willing buyers and I believe there may also be a willing
seller.''

BELGIUM'S star team Anderlecht were knocked out of the Champions' Cup
when they could manage only a 1-1 draw with Hungary's Ferencvaros after
a 1-0 home defeat two weeks ago.
Ferencvaros barely let Anderlecht out of their half in the first 10
minutes as they sought to boost their lead, but the Belgians weathered
the onslaught and the game became more balanced.
But only four minutes into the second half, the home team's two
Serbian strikers, Kuntic and Kopunovic, confused Anderlecht's defenders
and Kopunovic fired into the middle of the goal from six metres.
Anderlecht responded with a series of high-powered attacks. In 65
minutes de Bilde took a pass from outside the box and amid confusion in
the Ferencvaros defence rifled a shot from six metres into the net over
the head of keeper Attila Hajdu.

ENGLISH ROUND-UP
ENGLISH champions Blackburn Rovers suffered their first defeat of the
season when at Hillsborough last night, they were beaten 2-1 by
Sheffield Wednesday.
Former England midfield player Chris Waddle scored his first goal of
the season to give Wednesday the lead. Alan Shearer, with his second
goal of the season, levelled the scores right on the hour mark, but Mark
Pembridge scored his first goal since joining Wednesday in the summer
for the winner.
Blackburn's Mark Atkins was sent off on the final whistle for dissent.
In London, the kick-off in Tottenham's match against Aston Villa, who
defeated Manchester United on the opening afternoon, was delayed for 15
minutes at White Hart Lane due to crowd congestion.
The game ended in a 1-0 win for Villa, with Ugo Ehiogu doing the
damage.
In the capital derby at Loftus Road, Oydind Leonhardsen gave Wimbledon
the lead after 29 minutes against Queen's Park Rangers.
Dean Holdsworth netted the second and then close to time, Jon Goodman
added a third. But the night ended on a sour note for Holdsworth when he
was sent off after 59 minutes for a second bookable offence.
Paul Telfer put Coventry into the lead after 12 minutes against
Manchester City at Highfield Road, and the Midland's side hung on for a
2-1 success.
Manchester United striker Paul Scholes lifted the gloom surrounding
the club after their summer of discontent by putting them 1-0 up against
West Ham at Old Trafford.
Steve Bruce wiped the smile off United's faces when he scored an own
goal after 56 minutes, but Roy Keane netted United's winner in 67
minutes.
* MIDDLESBROUGH must wait until tomorrow before knowing if their first
home match in the Premiership can go ahead.
A final decision on the safety certificate for Boro's new #16m Cellnet
Riverside stadium will be made just 27 hours before Saturday's opener
against Chelsea.
Cleveland County Council's safety of sports grounds advisory group put
back the decision after having heard that nine safety conditions have
yet to be met. They include the need for unconditional approval of
stadium structure and the electrical installation safety.
Council chief executive Bruce Stephenson said: ''We recognise a
tremendous effort is being put in by all those working at the stadium
and that the club is confident it can meet the requirements.''

* BELGIAN police detained about 300 unruly German fans before last
night's friendly to inaugurate a new stadium on the site of Brussels'
ill-fated Heysel arena.
The disturbances were an unwelcome echo of the night in 1985 when 39
people died in rioting before the 1985 European Cup final between
Liverpool and Juventus at the Heysel.
The new King Baudouin stadium, named after Belgium's late king, was
opened by his widow Queen Fabiola in a ceremony before the game between
Belgium and Germany.

EASTERN European teams won berths in the Champions' League last night
while the more fashionable sides, Anderlecht and IFK Gothenburg, crashed
out of the tournament.
Ferencvaros, of Hungary, who reached the Cup-winners' Cup final in
1975, beat the Belgian champions with a 1-1 draw in the second leg of
their preliminary round tie, winning 2-1 on aggregate.
Legia Warsaw eliminated the Swedes. Jesper Blomqvist levelled the tie
with a goal after 25 minutes. But goals by Leszek Pisz and Jacek Bednarz
in the final 17 minutes saw the Poles through.
Steaua Bucharest, who won the trophy in 1986, went through by a
solitary goal against Salzburg following a 0-0 draw in Austria two weeks
ago, while Dynamo Kiev, of Ukraine, like the Romanians, qualified for
the Champions' League for the second season in succession after having
beaten Aalborg, of Denmark 4-1 on aggregate.
Panathinaikos, losing finalists in 1972, defeated Hajduk Split, the
winning goal coming from Argentine internationalist Juan Jose Borrelli.
The Croatians, played the match in Rijeka near the Italian border
instead of Split for security reasons because of the war in the Balkans.
Rosenborg, of Norway, survived a late onslaught from Turkish champions
Besiktas, who scored twice in the last five minutes, to go through 4-3
on aggregate.
Veteran former German international Stefan Kuntz reduced the arrears
after eight minutes, but Besiktas failed to capitalise and Harald
Brattbakk equalised in the 68th.
The tie seemed over, but Kuntz again narrowed the deficit with an
85th-minute penalty and two minutes later Mehmet Ozdilek made it 3-1,
setting up a nail-biting finale.
Grasshopper Zurich won 1-0 away to Maccabi Tel Aviv with an early goal
by Alexandre Comisetti to qualify 2-1 on aggregate.
* A GOAL from by Fredi Bobic seven minutes from time gave Germany a
2-1 victory over Belgium in a friendly. It was the first event in
Belgium's new national stadium, built on the ruins of the ill-fated
Heysel ground in which 39 people died in rioting in 1985.
But the festive event was marred by incidents with German hooligans
before the kick-off. Belgian police detained nearly 300 German fans and
about 30 of them were arrested for vandalism, drug possession or
violence and faced criminal charges.

DAVID Platt's first goal since his move from Sampdoria set Arsenal on
their way to a 2-0 Premiership victory against Everton at Goodison Park.
Ian Wright added the second.
Manchester United secured their first three points of the season with
a 2-1 win over West Ham at Old Trafford. But despite strikes from Paul
Scholes and Roy Keane, United were far from inspiring in front of a
reduced-capacity crowd.
Defending champions Blackburn had a man dismissed -- Mark Atkins for
dissent -- and to add to their misery, Rovers were were beaten 2-1 by
Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.
Wimbledon and Aston Villa joined Newcastle and Leeds as the only sides
with 100% records with away wins against QPR and Tottenham respectively.
In the Coca-Cola Cup, Sunderland came back from 2-0 down at half-time
to clinch a dramatic win at Roker Park against Preston.

RUGBY:
HERIOT'S have become the second Scottish first division club this
season to agree a sponsorship deal with McEwan's. The announcement
follows the revelation last week of a new link between the giant brewing
firm and Boroughmuir and it is expected that two further first divison
clubs will make public similar agreements to complete the McEwan's
quartet.
The Edinburgh club will sport the McEwan's logo on their shorts and
kit bags for the period of the three-year agreement, but significantly
will leave the famous blue and white jersey untainted.
It is not because of sentiment, but is part of the condititions laid
down by the Greyfriars Trust, set up by a consortium of former pupils to
help Heriot's financially over a three-year period. The Goldenacre club
is now in its last year of the #100,000 benefit from the trust.
McEwan's refused to put a figure on the value of the agreement, but
commercial director John Griffiths indicated that their involvement in
Scottish rugby was on a financial par with their input to the national
league.
''We will be maintaining the same investment level in Scottish
rugby,'' said Griffiths, who added: ''We will be announcing further
initiatives later in the season and possibly looking at extending our
support to clubs lower down in the leagues.''
George Shand, Heriot's club president, said: ''The sponsorship money
will help us with a number of projects. ''But it is certain that this
will help us with our pre-season tour to South Africa next August.''
In addition to sponsorship, Heriot's have attracted a number of new
players this season. The most significant could be Fraser McMillan, the
strong former Musselburgh scrum half. Other newcomers include David
Officer (Edinburgh University), Tam McVie and Martin McCLuskie (both
Edinburgh Academicals).
Fraser Dall, the Heriot's director of coaching, is hoping that the
six-foot, eight-inch Andy Macdonald is fit to resume playing after
having recovered from a back injury that put paid to much of his rugby
last season.
Most of Heriot's new players will be tried out on Saturday when they
play a series trial games against Stewart's Melville FP at Goldenacre at
senior, under-21 and second XV levels.
Their first league match is against Boroughmuir at Goldenacre on
September 2 which should provide a double bonus for sponsors McEwan's.

THE fear that UEFA's decision to stage preliminary-round ties in early
August would be a serious drawback to Scottish clubs has been fulfilled
with a vengeance. Motherwell's defeat by MyPa 47 of Finland was a
classic example of the consequnces of the gap in match fitness between
home teams and others already in harness.
Given a few more weeks, Motherwell would have left the Finns trailing
in their wake, but that is not much consolation, nor financially any
help, when the team has already been dispatched to the sidelines until
next season.
The 3-1 defeat in the first leg at Fir Park, albeit an abysmal
performance by Motherwell, would never have happened if the Scottish
players had been a little nearer competitive sharpness, although manager
Alex McLeish would insist that there is no excuse for bad defending, and
they proved as much by outplaying MyPa in the 2-0 return on Tuesday
night in Finland.
McLeish admits that he and his assistant, Andy Watson, pondered long
and hard about how to prepare for the tie. ''There is absolutely no
doubt that they were streets ahead of us in match fitness at Fir Park,
but I don't want to gloss over Motherwell's faults in that game.
However, the fitness factor is a real problem for Scottish clubs. Andy
and I are wondering if we should have brought the players in a month
earlier, or even two weeks earlier.
''Maybe if we get there next season, that is what we will do. We might
have to try something different, but it is difficult to see what can be
done.''
The Motherwell manager refused to accept that his team's exit was
another example of the poverty of the Scottish game. ''I knew we were a
better side than MyPa, but it was a big concern going into the tie with
only pre-season matches behind us. I could see we were short of
sharpness before we played them.''
* CELTIC are almost certain to be seeded in the first-round draw for
the European Cup-winners' Cup tomorrow, although the ratings will not be
announced until after the preliminary-round games are completed tonight.
Celtic, as Scotland's representatives, look set for the sixteenth spot
and should thus avoid an early clash with some of the big names who are

Livingston 1, Morton 0
BACK at Meadowbank for the first time this season, Jim Leishman's
Livingston continued their fine recent run with this Challenge Cup win
against Morton.
The Greenock side started well, with McInnes, Laing, and Lindberg all
going close, but in 35 minutes they lost an unlucky goal and from there
on grew more and more frantic.
Callaghan was the man who took advantage of a collision between Morton
keeper Wylie and defender McCahill as they went for a cross, and the
veteran nipped in to shoot into an empty net with McCahill still
prostrate and requiring attention.
McInnes should have equalised three minutes from the interval when he
headed past with home keeper Stoute well beaten. But Stoute played a
hero's role in the second half as the visitors' fought hard for an
equaliser.
After having tipped out a corner in 52 minutes he made a brilliant
reflex save from Rajamaki's return volley.

BOROUGHMUIR suffered a 45-21 defeat at the hands of Pontypridd in
their opening match of the Euro Cup '95 competition in the Dutch town of
Leiden.
Flanker Neil McCallum and winger Derek Stark scored tries for the
Edinburgh club, who without specialist jumpers, were unable to secure
sufficient line-out ball against Pontypridd's big pack.
Top performance for Boroughmuir came from their No.8 Stuart Reid, who
outplayed his opposite number Dale McIntosh, the former Scotland B cap.
The Scottish side's other points -- three penalty goals and a
conversion -- were scored by stand-off Bryan Easson, who also missed
three shots at goal.
In the other matches last night, Blackrock College and Wasps had easy
wins over their respective opponents, Diok and Dutch Select.
Boroughmuir now will play their next match tomorrow when they face
Diok.

RAITH Rovers are prepared to abandon Stark's Park in favour of a
bumper crowd should they be handed a glamour tie when the draw is made
for the first round of the UEFA Cup tomorrow.
The Kirkcaldy club, who saw the capacity at Stark's Park cut to just
more than 5000 for their preliminary tie against Gotu IF, of the Faroe
Islands, already have made provisional arrangements with both St
Johnstone and Hibernian.
Club chairman Alex Penman said Easter Road would be the venue if Raith
are drawn against one of the biggest clubs. McDiarmid Park is being set
aside if the draw brings less glamorous opposition.
Penman said: ''I will speak to the opposition as soon as the draw is
made and try to find out all I can about the size of their travelling
support, and any problems there might be.

the 20-year-old Brechin City striker.
Price, who joined Brechin from Meadowbank last season, has signed a

for Brechin in their 1-0 win over Dumbarton in the League Challenge Cup

' The thought ran through my mind that maybe we would be taken into
extra-time '
RICHARD GOUGH
RELIEF was the dominant emotion at the end of a long, sapping evening
for Rangers in the Antonis Papadopouolous Stadium, when they finally
made it once more into the Champions' League.
They can look forward to earning millions of pounds as they mix with
the game's elite, but if they are to earn more than hefty cheques they
will have to examine what is required to succeed at the top.
Against a humble but proud club they struggled throughout, giving
their supporters palpitations. Their problems stemmed from an inability
to retain possession and produce a creative touch when needed.
Indeed, the Cypriot champions, Anorthosis Famagusta, will look back on
this European Cup preliminary tie and consider themselves unfortunate.
They will lament missed chances, not so much last night when they ran
out of fuel in the second half, but two weeks ago in Glasgow, when Andy
Goram's reflexes protected Rangers from embarrassment.
The keeper did it again last night, with one excellent, side-foot save
in the first half, and then a touch over his bar from Michalis Shiemitra
in the second period. In fact, that save seemed to dredge the remains of
Anorthosis's resolve away and they gave way, allowing Rangers to go on
to the big show.
It might be justified to present a critical analysis of Rangers'
performance, but any examination would have to be balanced by the fact
that they were without their playmakers, Brian Laudrup, who was too
injured to travel to Cyprus, and Paul Gascoigne, who survived only 25
minutes.
The Englishman seemed to turn awkwardly and he knew he had damaged
himself and it was later disclosed that he injured his groin and will
miss the opening premier-division match on Saturday against Kilmarnock.
However, the problem won't be long-term.
Even before he went, however, Ilias Kiriakov, who had marked him out
of the game at Ibrox, was all over him again, but the midfield player
had indicated to his captain, Richard Gough, that he was toiling after
five minutes.
The evening would have been more comfortable had Rangers not been
denied what appeared a penalty, when Charlie Miller was body-checked by
Georgios Panay inside Anorthosis's box after only six minutes.
The referee's body language suggested he had felt the young midfield
player was play acting, which was a bizarre interpretation of what had
happened, and while dealing in the ridiculous, it would be appropriate
to bring in both Walter Smith and Gough.
Looking drained at the end, the manager spoke of the injustice of
forcing his players to qualify at this stage for the Champions' League.
''At the end of last season we won another league championship, but we
could have been out of Europe before the next season started,'' he said.
''It is an unfair pressure to put on coaches and players or a club
deemed to be in the top 24 in Europe. That should be good enough to
ensure a number of matches in the Champions' League.''
His captain took up the cause and said: ''The pressure was
unbelievable. It is ridiculous that we should have to qualify. Near the
end of the game I looked over to the dugout, and Ally McCoist signalled
a minute left, but even at that time the thought was running through my
mind that maybe we would be taken into extra-time.''
David Robertson was booked for the second time in the tie and won't be
able to play in the first Champions' League match, but by then Smith
should have his genuinely gifted performers available.
The draw will be made tomorrow in Geneva, and UEFA also will be
relieved because their competition is for the elite who own impressive
facilities like Ibrox which again will be the scene of some special
evenings like those three seasons ago when the club last played at this
level.
No-one outwith the club can begin to understand the pressures which
are brought to bear on teams who simply have to get into the big league,
but perhaps now that they are through, they will be able to relax and
make an impact.
The atmosphere last night was tense long before the players appeared
to look at the pitch or begin their warm-ups, and there was a
five-minute spell when the riot police, who were to be seen sitting
around the ground, might have thought they would be pressed into action.
First, the Anorthosis fans penned in behind a huge fence at the back
of one of the goals, produced a tri-colour, the sight of which didn't go
down to well at the opposite end of the ground. Rangers fans, around
2000, got hold of a Greek flag which they proceeded to set alight, and
the Cypriots were appalled and some of them leapt on to the fence.
A draw was called when the locals got their hands on a Union Jack
which also went up in flames.
Around the stadium were various banners, mostly blue, which is also
Anorthosis's colours, and many of them proclaimed that Famagusta should
be free again from Turkish rule. Anorthosis -- which means reviving --
or Death was typical of the messages shown by the refugee club's
supporters who are a fairly political lot and never miss an opportunity
to tell outsiders of their plight.
The capacity was supposed to be 9500, but there at least 13,000 people
inside and not all had tickets. Many had scaled the walls and dropped in
while the club's guest list was also extensive.
However, while Gascoigne seemed to be crying as he hobbled off the
pitch, the evening did not end in tears.

Stranraer 0, Dundee United 2
STRANRAER, for the second time within five days, went out of a cup-tie
to first-division opposition but at Stair Park last night they gave
Dundee United a tough match, and manager Alex McAnespie had nothing but
praise for his players at the final whistle.
United had almost all the pressure but faced a defence which was hard
to crack.
The visitors' pressure had to tell and in 19 minutes it was no
surprise that it was Craig Brewster who made the scoresheet. Skipper
Dave Bowman swung over a deep cross from the left and the big striker
came charging in behind the defence to head powerfully to the net.
Stranraer had their best chance in the opening minute of the second
half when Ian McAulay worked a clever pass into United's area but Jim
Hughes stumbled and the opening and the chance was lost.
With eight minutes left, United finished the tie. A Winters cross was
deflected in the Billy McKinlay and the substitute from close range
prodded the ball in.

* UNITED manager Billy Kirkwood and Cowdenbeath's Tom Steven have both
been reported to the SFA after their row at Central Park last Saturday
when United won 4-0 in the Coca-Cola Cup.
Edinburgh referee Tom Brown, who sent the pair to the stand after they
were involved in a flare-up in stoppage time, has stated in his written
report to Park Gardens that they used foul and abusive language towards
each other.
Now United manager Kirkwood and Cowdenbeath's Steven could be called
before the next meeting of the disciplinary committee on September 11.
An SFA spokesman said last night: ''The two managers will be asked for
their written comments on the referee's report. A decision will be made
over a possible appearance after these comments have been examined.''
Kirkwood has refused to speak about his part in the row, although it
is understood he is angry with himself for having become involved after
Cowden manager Steven had accused United star Billy McKinlay of making a
coward's challenge.

CLYDE'S Gordon Parks will not play again this season.
The youngster, stretchered off after only 45 seconds of Tuesday's
Challenge Cup defeat by St Johnstone, has a double leg break.
Manager Alex Smith said yesterday: ''Gordon will be out for 10 months
to a year. He will be operated on to get the bones reset, but it is the
two big bones in the leg which are broken.''
Smith had been upset after the incident in which Parks and St
Johnstone's John O'Neill had clashed. He said yesterday: ''It was an
awkward collision and I am willing to give the Saints player the benefit
of the doubt.
''However it is a tragedy for Gordon who has just fought back from a
cartilage operation.''
Clyde officials are also upset that midfielder Kenny Gillies was sent
off for two innocuous offences -- a hand ball and an obstruction. He
will not be fined by the club.

BOXING
IT is a waste of time mentioning the word, defeat, within earshot of
Gary Jacobs. The 29-year-old Scot refuses to understand its meaning in
the final days before his attempt to take the World Boxing Council title
from 1-8 favourite Pernell Whitaker in Atlantic City on Saturday.
Jacobs is in great shape, having added a steely dimension to his
already super-determined mind, and Jacobs has no doubt that he will pull
off one of British boxing's biggest modern-day shocks by defeating
Whitaker, owner of one of the most impressive CVs in world boxing.
''I'm 100% convinced I am the man,'' said Jacobs. ''Every round is
going to be fought as if it's my last. I'm not interested in people
giving me no chance. I'm here to do what I can.
''I have total belief in myself. When I get in the ring, it's just
another guy in the other corner. I never go in there with respect for
anyone -- when you are in their it's evens. It's down to who wants it
most.
''I have come to take Whitaker's title, and to do that I've got to win
by stoppage and leave nothing to chance. I wanted Whitaker because he's
the best, and beating him would give me the right recognition.''
However, the critical American fight fraternity remember Jacobs most
for being outscored and out of his depth against Buddy McGirt in a New
York fight in 1989.
After initially thinking that a Whitaker fight was a good move for
financial reasons and prestige, Jacobs' manager Mickey Duff is moving
towards the fighter's kind of mental wavelength. ''He really does have a
chance,'' said Duff. ''He can be proud of what he's done, win or lose.
I'm happy that Whitaker will probably underestimate Gary. If things go
right, I think he's capable of out-hustling him and out-bustling him.''

Australian citizen, Bugner says he will fight Australian champion Vince
Cervi on the Gold Coast on September 22.
The fight has been sanctioned by the Australian Boxing Federation and
Bugner, who twice went the distance with Muhammad Ali, said: ''If people

SAILING
SCOTLAND'S Glendronach and Lord Inverforth, skippered by Jon
Fitzgerald and Paul Jeffes respectively, have taken a few small steps
towards a respectable result on the second leg of the Teacher's Round
Britain Challenge.
With just over 200 miles to go to the finish line at Rothesay
yesterday evening, the Scots boats had picked up three places apiece off
the Dublin coast over the past 24 hours.
After buoying down the tail of the 10-boat, five-nations fleet on
Tuesday, they now lie in sixth and seventh places.
They, and the second to fifth placed boats, have little chance of
catching the runaway leader, David Harte of Ireland. Skippering Dream of
Erin, he was first to breach the cold front which yielded 15-knot
breezes, and with the 19-mile lead yesterday, he was making 6.8 knots,
three times the speed of the back markers. Dream of Erin is expected at
Rothesay this afternoon.
The winds are forecast to increase over the next 36 hours, but this is
likely to continue to favour the boats at the front of the fleet,
although Fitzgerald and Jeffes both have extensive knowledge of the
approaches to the Clyde and Bute, and should be able to capitalise and
maintain their progress up through the fleet. Positions:
1, Dream of Erin (D Harte, Ireland) 179 miles; 2, Pride of Cardiff (R
Tudor, Wales) 198; 3, Sprit of London Docklands (V Cherry, England) 211;
4, Positively Belfast (D Gomes, Ireland) 213; 5, Celtic Dragon (C Lyons,
Wales) 215; 6, Glendronach (J Fitzgerald, Scotland) 216; 7, Lord
Inverforth (P Jeffes, Scotland) 218; 8, Belle Helene (J P Saliou,
France) 223; 9, Coeur de Paris (D Nicholas, France) 223; 10, Jacksons
Landing (D Alan-Williams, England) 230.

ROWING
FOLLOWING yesterday's repechages at the World Rowing Championships in
Tampere, Finland, Britain now has 12 crews taking part in today's
semi-finals with, from an original entry of 20, a further four already
qualified for finals over the weekend.
Britain's women's four, with Scottish internationalists Gillian
Lindsay and Kate Templeton aboard, qualified from yesterday's racing for
the finals, taking fourth place in their repechage, behind USA,
Netherlands and Australia, but crucially ahead of the Czech Republic, to
make it through to tomorrow's finals.
Scottish Commonwealth bronze medallist Karen Marwick also was
successful in the women's pairs and, despite losing out to South Africa,
this crew also did enough to qualify.
Meanwhile, the men's coxed four, with Cal MacLennan in the crew,
became the first British casualties of these championships. Their third
place behind Germany and Yugoslavia was not good enough to put them into
Friday's main final and relegated them to B final action.
After four days of heats and repechages, the action hots up
substantially today with all the semis.
Once again, the draw has been kind to Peter Haining, Scotland's world
lightweight sculling champion, as he chases a record-breaking third
successive title. He has been put into the easier semi-final, avoiding
both of his main rivals, Ireland's Niall O'Toole and Michael Banninger
from Switzerland, and looks to have a relatively straightforward passage
to tomorrow's final.
Also in action in today's semi-finals are the British pair of Steve
Redgrave and Matthew Pinset -- any failure by them at this stage seems
unthinkable.

SWIMMING
CAMERON Black, who made his Scottish senior debut in last month's
Canadian Championships, and British youth caps Ian Edmond and Teresa
Davies head a new Scottish youth squad who will benefit from #75,000
funding over the next three years.
Drew Gordon has been appointed coach of the 16-strong group who will
gain from weekend training camps and international competition.
The squad ranges in age from 14 to 17, with Lynn McLaren, Ruth Leaver
and Steven Kidd, all Scottish Age Group champions the youngest members.
Lynn underlined her potential by claiming five titles in the
14-year-old section at the Scottish championships, while Ruth took the
100m breast-stroke in the same section.
City of Glasgow has the strongest representation with Craig Miller,
winner of five senior titles at the Scottish age group event, joining
Ruth and Steven in the squad. For Cameron Black sights are set higher
than youth level. The Arbroath 17-year-old has already decided to take
time off from a college course to concentrate on preparations for the
Olympic trials in Sheffield in March.
He burst on to the scene with victory in the 50m and 100m butterfly at
the Scottish Open Championships in June and his progress promises to be
a feature of the coming season.
The youth squad selection is part of the Scottish Amateur Swimming
Association's determination to improve the sport's development
programme. Squad:-
Boys -- C Black (Arbroath St Thomas), B Morgan (Carnegie), S Bonnar
(Perth), D Polo del Vecchio (Kirkcaldy District), C Miller, S Kidd (both
City of Glasgow), I Edmond (Reading), M Cole (York), D Leith
(Warrender), K Anderson (Carlisle). Girls: R Leaver (City of Glasgow), L
Kent (Cumbernauld), T Davies (Coventry), S McNeilly (Bristol), L McLaren
(Carnegie), S Mitchell (Arbroath St Thomas).

THE SIXTH TEST:
ENGLAND go into the final Test against the West Indies seeking a
victory which would give them the Wisden Trophy for the first time in 26
years.
The sudden change in the weather yesterday indicated that the
elements, along with The Oval wicket, may well have an influence on the
make-up of the final eleven for today.
The closely shaven pitch is not expected to be quite as pacey as those
in the three previous years when England's fast bowler Devon Malcolm
claimed 21 wickets at 19 runs apiece.
But his hopes of getting the nod for inclusion in the team today,
ahead of left-arm seamer Mark Ilott -- who was severely treated by the
West Indies batsmen in their match against Essex at the weekend -- were
enhanced after England's net session at The Oval yesterday.
The practice took place in overcast conditions which prompted captain
Mike Atherton to say: ''If the weather is the same tomorrow morning, it
will probably favour the inclusion of an extra seamer.
''The Oval is a 'swingy' ground in any case. If we had been playing
today, for instance, it's hard to think that there would not have been
movement in the air.''
If Malcolm does win his place back in the England side, having lost it
after the first Test at Headingley, he will be keen to display the form
he has shown on the county circuit since then. He is the leading
wicket-taker for Derbyshire, with 52 this season, and that includes a 10
for 179 performance last week on a pitch which gave him little
assistance.
The Oval seems to be his happy hunting ground when he turns out for
England. Against Pakistan in 1992, he took five for 94 in the only
innings, and the following year in the Ashes Test, he claimed three in
each innings.
Last year against South Africa, he finished with match figures of 10
for 138. His second innings spell of nine for 57 was responsible for the
tourists being shot out for 175 and gave Malcolm the sixth-best return
in Test history.
However, should England decide to play two spinners, as seemed likely
before the overcast skies yesterday, then Phil Tufnell will have his
opportunity to resurrect a fading Test career.
Having been brought into the squad of 13, in place of the injured
left-armer Richard Illingworth, Tufnell will be hoping to repeat his
performance against the tourists in the corresponding Test on their last
tour in 1991. Then, too, he had been recalled to the England team and he
responded with brilliant figures of six for 25 in the first innings,
which included a devastating spell of six for 4 in 33 deliveries. And
only a month ago, he had six for 111 in an innings against the tourists
in their match against Middlesex.
He has been in excellent form for his county with 51 wickets,
including a match haul of nine for 149 last weekend against Kent.
No doubt, he will also be keen to repair the damage done to his
reputation by his own misdemeanours and on-field tantrums. In the past,
it was the 32-year-old Tufnell's attitude, disregard of authority, and
surly manner that upset England.
Alan Wells, at nearly 34, seems set to make his Test debut in the
England middle order after having been included in the squad for the
previous Test and then omitted.
Mike Atherton will be hoping to give England a similar start as in the
first innings at Nottingham, though this time in partnership with Jason
Gallian, who was injured in the third Test at Edgbaston.
Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe have been in fine form and England's
confidence is high with some remarkable performances this summer from
Cork, Fraser, and the off-spinning all-rounder MikeWatkinson.
If England decide to have six specialist batsmen in the side, then
John Crawley will keep his place at No.3. But should an extra front-line
bowler be preferred, then he is most likely to be the one to be dropped
although that would leave the batting dangerously thin.
For the West Indies, Carl Hooper returns to open the innings, with
Stuart Williams making the way for him and Curtly Ambrose (replacing
Dhanraj) is also fully fit to add further strength to the tourists'
formidable pace attack.
The stage is set for the final showdown in a series, sitting at 2-2,
which has generated more interest than any other in England since the
exploits of Ian Botham in the Ashes of 1981.

ENGLISH COUNTIES
AN UNBROKEN ninth-wicket partnership of 46 between Darren Thomas and
Neil Kendrick saved Glamorgan's blushes after Gloucestershire's Javagal
Srinath and Martyn Ball had torn the middle order to shreds.
Glamorgan closed the opening day of the Britannic Assurance County
Championship match on 249 for eight, with 30 overs lost to rain.
Only three balls were possible before an early lunch, but this proved
long enough for Indian paceman Srinath to trap Alistair Dalton leg
before without a run scored.
Hugh Morris (67) and David Hemp (71) put on 145 before Morris was
second out, lbw to off-spinner Ball when trying to sweep against the
spin.
Matthew Maynard became Ball's second victim on 163.
Tony Cottey, Adrian Shaw, and Robert Croft all fell to Srinath in the
space of 10 balls. That left Glamorgan at 191 for six. Hamish Anthony
and Hemp were caught off Ball before Thomas and Kendrick halted the
slide.

HOCKEY
THE element of surprise may have been missing from the early games in
Dublin at the Nissan European Nations Men's Hockey Cup, but that
certainly wasn't the case in the concluding stages.
On Tuesday, it was Holland, the world cup finalists, who were left
eating humble pie in a 1-1 draw with Belgium. Yesterday it was England.
They were already assured of their semi-final place before their
concluding group match with Switzerland, but they did require both
points to enable them take pole position in the group and subsequently a
semi-final tie with dark horses Belgium.
Switzerland refused to be intimidated and deservedly took a point from
the 4-4 draw after being in the lead on three occasions. In dropping
this point, England now go in against Holland and so their progress to
the final on Sunday is no longer a foregone conclusion.
Germany in beating Ireland 2-0, leap-frogged England to take top
position on goal difference. They now play Belgium, but Scotland, who
had a rest day, suffered another disappointment.
France provided a minor upset in salvaging a point with a 1-1 draw
with Wales to leave Scotland propping up the group. In the first of
their classification matches on Saturday, Scotland's opponents in the
play-off to decide positions nine to 12 will be Switzerland. Results:
Group A -- France 1, Wales 1.
Group B -- Switzerland 4, England 4; Poland 3, Belarus 2; Germany 2,
Ireland 0.

SCOTLAND v MCC
SCOTLAND'S cricketers flattered to deceive on the opening day of their
three-day clash at Mannofield, Aberdeen, yesterday.
Jim Love's side were restricted to a total of 281 on a pitch which
offered some assistance to the bowlers.
No fewer than six batsmen reached 30 but only George Reifer went on to
pass the 50 mark, his 58 coming off 140 balls and including six 4s. The
Uddingston man then fended off a lifter from Kelvin Williams and was
caught by Parker.
Stand-in skipper Iain Philip set the tone with a typically
swashbuckling 44, including four boundaries and a 6 over square leg.
However, the Stenhousemuir batsman mis-timed a drive off Irish skipper
Alan Lewis to give Paul Parker the first of four sharp catches.
At the other end, debutant Dougie Lockhart showed the class and
temperament for the top level until an ill-advised drive off Gordon
Harris sent him packing for 31.
Greig Williamson also looked capable of taking control, but rued one
bad shot when he gave Peter Hepworth a simple return catch, before
Edinburgh pair Alec Davies and Jim Govan carried the Scots beyond the
250 mark with an entertaining stand of 48.
The new ball gave Williams a new lease of life, and the Trinidadian
ripped through the tail, as the last four wickets fell for just 11 runs.
Coach Jim Love admitted: ''It could have been a lot better, but I'm
not too unhappy. The pitch may have played its part in some of the
dismissals.'' Scores:
Scotland 281 (G Reifer 58, I Philip 44, A Davies 44; K Williams 4-56,
P Hepworth 3-46).

ATHLETICS:
AN ANGRY Peter McColgan yesterday criticised British athletics
officials for under-valuing his wife, then using her name to promote a
meeting in which she has never intended to appear.
Liz McColgan is one of the first UK athletes to take a stand against a
new payment structure in UK athletics, electing to race elsewhere in
Europe instead.
Since the world event in Gothenburg, the former 10,000 metres champion
has competed in Cologne and Linz, and she confirmed yesterday that she
will be in the field for a 5000m world-record attempt tomorrow in
Brussels.
''We discussed racing against the USA on Sunday at Gateshead, and at
Crystal Palace next weekend, but Liz is being offered peanuts here,''
said Peter. ''Liz is earning less on the Continent -- in fact she would
prefer to run in the UK, where she gets great public support, and it is
less trouble. But it has become a point of principle with us and the
British Athletics Federation.''
But they remain happy to deal with Brendan Foster's company, Nova, who
aim to bring together McColgan and fellow Commonwealth 10,000m champion
Yvonne Murray in the Great North Run, for what would be the latter's
debut half-marathon.
The Herald, in revealing exclusively earlier this month a new BAF
payment structure, predicted it would inevitably drive leading
competitors abroad. This is the first obvious instance.
McColgan also was critical of attempts to market Sunday's McDonald's
Games, in London, by hyping up a 3000m rematch between his wife and her
Scottish rival, Murray.
''Liz has never at any time been confirmed for the McDonald's Games,''
said her husband. ''The next thing they'll be saying is that Liz has
withdrawn from a race against Yvonne -- in fact, she will run against
Yvonne in Brussels.''
The Scottish pair will add substance to a race in which Ireland's
world champion, Sonia O'Sullivan, will attempt to break Fernanda
Ribiero's world 5000m record, and which also features another Briton,
former world junior cross-country champion, Paula Radcliffe, who already
has beaten both Scots this year.
Murray's coach, Tom Boyle, confirmed yesterday that she would run in
Belgium, while McColgan, who ran her fastest 3000m (8-50.52) since 1992,
in Linz on Tuesday night, declared herself ready to try to regain from
Murray the Scottish 5000m record which the Motherwell woman took from
her earlier this year.
Murray, meanwhile, will run at Crystal Palace on Sunday, in the 3000m
which also includes O'Sullivan. McColgan remains adamant she will not be
there.
The main attraction of the meeting will be the triple jump in which
world record-holder Jon Edwards faces the silver and bronze medallists
whom he beat to take gold in Gothenburg.
Mel Neef, who narrowly failed to break the 15-year-old Scottish 400m
record last night in Copenhagen (she won in 51.76), has another chance
in London. She faces five of the Gothenburg finalists.

DARING Destiny, Scottish-owned winner of the Ayr Gold Cup 12 months
ago, is among the 138 entries for this year's race.
Owned by Ann Wright, the four-year-old has been allocated 9st, ten
pounds less than top weights Hard To Figure, third last year, and the
Irish-trained, The Puzzler.
Only 29 will line up for the six furlongs sprint on Saturday,
September 16, the last day of the Western Meeting.
As in previous years there also will be the Ayr Silver Cup, a
consolation race for those eliminated from the big event.
Ladbroke's, the sponsors, had made Mark Prescott's Espartero joint
favourite with Henry Candy's Top Banana, but Prescott said yesterday
that Espartero may not run. ''At the moment, Espartero is more likely to
run in Ireland where his target would be the Flying Five, said the
trainer.
Mark Johnston's Double Blue, 4-1 favourite to win last year's race,
showed himself in form at Ripon on Saturday when taking the Great St
Wilfred Handicap with a late run. He is third favourite at 16-1.
Johnston's other entry, Branston Abby, who has raced four times in
Germany this month and won a Listed race two weeks ago, is given a 20-1
quote.
Perryston View represents the best prospect for keeping the Cup in
Ayr. The three-year-old, trained by Peter Calver, is owned by Janis
MacPherson, wife of an Ayr hotelier. The three-year-old has won three
times this season including twice at Newmarket.
Jack Berry's horses are back in form and he has promising entries for
Scottish owners, including Amron -- Roy Peebles, Goringsky -- William
Robertson, and Garnock Valley and Best Of All -- Robert Aird.
Of the Scottish-based trainers only Linda Perratt has entries --
Mister Westsound, Diet, and Leading Princess.
Diet and Mister Westsound are in great form but they are well down the
handicap, and if they get a run it will almost certainly be in the
Silver Cup.
Horses drawn with low numbers on the far side of the course are said
to have an advantage. Horses drawn 1-9 have won eight times since 1980.
The exceptions included Lochsong, in 1992, and Daring Destiny last year.
* UTTOXETER are looking forward to their first meeting in two months
next Tuesday after an easing in the long, dry spell. ''We have had five
millimetres of rain and that's the first since early July,'' said clerk
of the course Major David McAllister.

GOLF AWARD
MICHAEL Bonallack's contribution to golf was honoured in America
yesterday when he received the Ambassador of Golf Award in Akron, Ohio.
The award is designed to honour an individual who has fostered the
concepts and ideals of the game on and off the course.
Announcing the honour on the eve of this year's NEC World Series,
Thomas Knoll, president of Akron Golf Charities, paid tribute to the
Royal and Ancient Golf Club secretary.
''Michael Bonallack's playing accomplishments as an amateur, his
contribution to the international development and appreciation of golf,
and his reverence for the history and tradition of golf, uniquely
qualify him to receive the Ambassador Award,'' he said.
The R&amp;A secretary now joins a list of past winners who include golfers
such as Gene Sarazen, Arnold Palmer, and Nancy Lopez, as well as
entertainers Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.
In an outstanding amateur career, Bonallack won the Amateur title five
times, the English championship five times, and the English strokeplay
title four times as well as a host of other titles.

WORLD SERIES
ANDREW Coltart makes his first appearance on the US Tour at the $2m
World Series of golf which starts in Akron, Ohio, today.
Coltart joins Nick Faldo and defending champion Jose Maria Olazabal in
the 47-man field which includes the year's four major champions -- Ben
Crenshaw (Masters), Corey Pavin (US Open), John Daly (Open), and Steve
Elkington (US PGA).
The event is restricted to winners on the US Tour and selected
overseas tournaments over the past year.
Former Scottish boys champion Coltart qualified to play here at
Firestone Country Club by winning the Australian PGA title in November.
''My game isn't great but I'm trying to get it back on track,'' said
Coltart, who has had a solid season on the European Tour.
Coltart, 25, said he would like to join the American Tour one day, but
was in no rush: ''I have to establish myself in Europe before I do
anything like that,'' he said.
Olazabal will be under the spotlight in his final appearance before
the Ryder Cup team is selected.

GERMAN OPEN
IT will be a disgruntled Ian Woosnam who tees off this afternoon in
the Volvo German Open in Stuttgart. In fact, the little Welshman
probably wishes he was somewhere else and the week was over.
The reason for his mood is perhaps a little surprising to some. ''I am
sick of the Ryder Cup,'' said Woosnam, one of 19 players battling for
five places going into the final counting event for Europe's Ryder Cup
team. ''You wonder if it's worth it. It does not matter where you go,
people keep mentioning it.
''I would have preferred not to be here and I didn't particulary want
a course like this which is so up and down it's going to wear you out.
I've just played six weeks in a row.''
The former world No.1 is playing rather than resting because he is
trying to get Europe out of a hole they dug for themselves by changing
from three to two wild cards, with the top 10 in the points table
qualifying automatically instead of nine.
However, the wild-card system may not be the only questionable aspect
of the selection process. The basic team choice format also is flawed,
writes Raymond Jacobs.
The system of a point earned for every #1 of prize money has never
been a balanced method of deciding the automatic places. Far better to
award, as the Americans do, points for the place gained confined to the
first 10 finishers.
To illustrate how unbalanced the existing scheme can be, last year
second place in the Czech Open was worth #55,550 but last week, the
total prize money having been increased by #250,000 to #750,000, Howard
Clark, in the process of beating a retreat from victory, nevertheless,
earned as runner-up #83,330, in 1994 the winner's prize.
As a result Clark vaulted from eighteenth to seventh place, virtually
assuring himself of his sixth appearance in the match, six years after
the last one. There is everything to be said for striking while the iron
is hot -- for instance, Clark's prize for being third in the Catalonia
Open was only #18,780 -- but the method is too open to distortion.
Again, as in the American system, bonus points could be awarded in the
four major championships, and to encourage the itinerant mercenaries
occasionally to transfer their loyalties home from abroad any other
event agreed to be above the ordinary, doubling up in the year of the
match itself.
Revision will be all the more necessary in the near future since Nick
Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Woosnam, and Severiano Ballesteros, all major
title winners, are growing old together. Apart from Colin Montgomerie
and Olazabal, who is there coming along who looks to have the drive and
the staying power to reinforce these thinning ranks?
However, one bright spot on the horizon is the from of Germany's
Bernhard Langer, who made a winning return to competitive action after a
back injury.
Langer, who missed the US PGA event and has not played for nearly a
month, won the 10-man Canon Shoot-out, part of the build-up to the
German Open. Langer, who missed the last Ryder Cup two years ago because
of a neck injury, said: ''It was my lower back this time and it started
bothering me at the end of June.
''I have been having treatment and have also taken a complete rest for
two weeks.''

WOMEN'S STROKEPLAY
SPANISH internationalist Ana Belen Sanchez carded a three-under-par 69
for a two-stroke lead after the opening round of the British Women's
Amateur Strokeplay Championship at Sandwich.
Highlight of the day for the 19-year-old came at the fifteenth when
she chipped in from 20 yards for an eagle 3.
Sanchez and second-placed Irish champion Eileen Rose Power (Kilkenny),
who had four birdies and three bogeys in a round of 71, were the only
players to finish under par.
Felixstowe Ferry's Joanne Hockley, who won the title three years ago,
is in third place after a level-par 72, leaving her three strokes ahead
of club colleague Julie Hall, the British matchplay champion, who is
seeking to complete a double of both championships in the same year.
Milltown's Suzanne Fanagan, one of four Irish players in contention,
shot a useful 74 to celebrate not only the selection of her brother,
Jody, to the Walker Cup but her own inclusion in the Irish team for the
home internationals at Wrexham in October.

''UP to a point, Lord Wakeham,'' is, with apologies to Evelyn Waugh,
not an unsympathetic reaction to Lord Wakeham's words yesterday on the
need for the press to protect Prince William from intrusion into his
private life as he starts school next month. A young child, regardless
of his or her social status, needs to be left out of public scrutiny as
much as possible. Lord Callaghan, when Prime Minister, was wont to say
''as the twig is bent, so grows the tree''. The press has to take care
that Prince William is allowed to develop without too much intrusion
into the efforts of his parents and teachers to deliver a sound
education. A prince can never be exactly what is meant by ''normal'',
but he needs as much opportunity as possible to be nearly that, and grow
without much bending.
At the same time, however, the very fact of being royal focuses public
attention. There remains an element of magic attached to monarchy -- the
pomp and circumstance of great ceremonial occasions alone ensure that
royal children play special roles from an early age and indeed have to
become accustomed to them. Interest is unavoidable, unless there is to
be no monarchy at all. Within the poles of complete disregard and
excessive interest, however, there is a vital role for the press, which
is mostly played rather well, but which has recently seemed damaging to
the institution of monarchy, partly because some members of the royal
family itself behaved badly. It cannot be insulated from public
attention or even the public interest, and it should not be; but it is
not too much to hope that a schoolboy will be allowed to enjoy his youth
even though he may someday be king.

<HEADLINE>Low &amp; Bonar shares plunge on surprise departure. Leng moves to Laporte</HEADLINE>

NEWS of the imminent departure of Low &amp; Bonar chief executive Jim Leng
took the City by surprise yesterday and prompted a 22p plunge in the
Dundee-based packaging and materials group's shares to 496p.
Shares in chemicals company Laporte, which head-hunted Leng, leapt 30p
to 821p, reflecting the high esteem in which the 49-year-old Geordie is
held in the City.
Laporte, which revealed it had been in discussions with Leng for
several months, was so impressed by his record at Low &amp; Bonar that it
was unperturbed by his lack of experience in the chemicals industry.
Leng will be replaced when he leaves on October 1 by Jim Heilig, 59,
who is credited with turning around Low &amp; Bonar's North American
subsidiary, Bonar Inc. Leng brought Heilig to Low &amp; Bonar in 1992 from
flexible packaging group James River Corporation, where he was
vice-president of operations.
It is Heilig's intention to remain at the helm of the Dundee-based
group until he is 65.
Leng took over the running of Low &amp; Bonar's principal UK subsidiary,
Bonar &amp; Flotex, in 1984, when he moved from sector stablemate John
Waddington.
He subsequently gained experience throughout the group and was heavily
involved in its acquisitions.
Leng, who became a main board director with responsibility for
European operations in 1989, was appointed chief executive three years
ago.
Between 1992 and 1994, under the leadership of Leng, pre-tax profits
before exceptionals doubled from #22m to #44m.
Leng's basic salary will double from #175,000 to about #350,000 when
he moves to Laporte's headquarters in Luton, Bedfordshire. Assuming he
does as well as he has at Low &amp; Bonar, he will be entitled to a
performance-related bonus of about 30% of his salary (#105,000).
In the year to end-November, Leng's remuneration package at Low &amp;
Bonar, excluding pension contributions, was boosted by hefty
performance-related payments to #351,535. The previous year, he earned
#178,363.
Commenting on his move, Leng said: ''It is a decision I have made with
some regret. I have run Low &amp; Bonar for over three years and we have
made tremendous progress. It wasn't a very easy decision to make.''
However, Laporte's #1600m market capitalisation is three times that of
Low &amp; Bonar. Laporte made pre-tax profits of #124m in the year to
January 1 and has a workforce of about 7500, compared with Low &amp; Bonar's
4200.
Although the two groups have completely different products, Leng
believes they have a similar philosophy.
He said: ''That is what has attracted us to each other. It was
something I found irresistible at the end of the day.''
Low &amp; Bonar and Laporte, which both have a strong presence in the UK,
Continental Europe and North America, have devolved management
structures. Both have strong market positions in some specialist
products.
Laporte, which employed external consultants in its search for a new
chief executive, has been keeping tabs on Leng for some time. It has
been looking for a replacement for Ken Minton, 58, for more than 12
months.
He is succeeding Roger Bexon, 69, as part-time chairman of Laporte.
Minton said the requirements to recruit a chief executive able to
embrace Laporte's culture and aggressive in generating shareholder value
were more important to the company than a background in the chemicals
industry.
Referring to Laporte's share price advance, he added: ''I think the
message we have been receiving from the market-place is that the market
feels very comfortable with what we have done and sees it as a
substantial addition to Laporte's strength.''
Bill McCall, an Edinburgh-based director of stockbroker Tilney, said:
''We are shocked by the move, given that everyone associates the success
of the last two or three years with him (Leng). You can obviously see
the disappointment in the share price.''
However, Tilney, which believes Low &amp; Bonar has sufficient momentum to
take it through the next two or three years without any radical changes,
is sticking with its profit forecasts.
It still expects pre-tax profits of #54m for the current year to
end-November and #62.4m next year.
McCall said Tilney would have to look at the situation again if Leng
was going to take any of his management team with him to Laporte.
However, Low &amp; Bonar chairman Hugh Laughland said: ''That is something
he (Leng) wouldn't do and the understanding is that he won't.''
The board agreed to release Leng from his three-year rolling contract,
thus easing his move to Laporte.
Low &amp; Bonar said yesterday that trading had continued in line with
expectations since it announced a 22% increase in interim pre-tax
profits to #24.8m.
It remains confident that it can make further progress in market
conditions which it describes as ''challenging''.
Low &amp; Bonar shares, which have outperformed the sector by about 15%
over the last 12 months, were hit recently by gloomy news from the
re-named Bowater packaging group, Rexam. Volume in Low &amp; Bonar yesterday
was a hefty 3.9 million shares.

MARLEY has dealt shareholders a double blow of such severity that the
shares at one point plunged 13p to a year's low of 113p with City
sentiment damaged by the forecast that the closing six months will be
unlikely to match that of the second half of last year at #29m. That
points to full year profits falling at least #9m below earlier
expectations at perhaps #49m and with little respite in sight.
Although Marley can do virtually nothing against the downturn in the
building and construction industry, there is undoubtedly a big question
mark over the #104m acquisition of the Syroco plastic garden furniture
business in the US which includes the initial #88m purchase price.
There is a decided risk of a credibility gap emerging over management
ability to develop a clear strategy. It is quite apparent that there are
not enough executive directors -- just two compared with four
non-executives, including chairman Sir George Russell and the
highly-regarded Gary Allen of IMI.
Chief executive David Trapnell will have to struggle to save the
Syroco situation, inevitably spending much time in the US and so leaving
finance director Chris Beenham having to do far more than his
traditional task as chief bean counter.
The Syroco deal was done in April and even then there was some
questioning as to whether the timing was right as it seemed to coincide
with the top of the US housebuilding cycle. But it was also hit by bad
weather, no repeat orders and no price increases with over half sales
going to just three major customers who can turn the screw with
comparative ease.
This was at a time when resin prices were soaring. That material
accounts for a third of manufacturing costs. So rather than the 33%
gross margin seen in 1994, the figure has now dropped to 20% leaving the
operation trading at just break-even and with Mr Trapnell indicating
that it will not be until 1997 that adequate profitability will be
achieved.
The credibility problem is that Syroco has turned down so soon after
its coming into the group and with at least two years now lying ahead
before it can be expected to turn round.
The more traditional Marley products such as roof tiles and aerated
concrete breeze blocks did perform well overall in the first six months.
But in recent weeks, demand has fallen rapidly with declines of 15% by
volume in the UK.
There was some success in pushing through price increases last year
which were responsible for a 68% increase in divisional profits and the
worry now is the extent these will come unstuck with housebuilders faced
with sharply falling unit sales and nary a hint of inflation to help
bail them out.
Fortunately, the automobile plastics side has turned in a respectable
performance if one includes the joint ventures. The combined overall
contribution was small in group terms but has substantial potential in
increasing market share in both the UK and German industries where a
#1.5m hit was taken on a new contract start-up but which is quite
acceptable on a five-year agreement.
There is little prospect of Marley raising its full-year dividend
above last time's 4.7p except perhaps by a token amount. But with the
shares closing at 116p, the yield of just 5.1% is not adequate to
support the stock even in a sector where the dismal news about to come
from the housebuilders and construction companies over the next few
weeks will be one of blighted hopes and prayers for the Chancellor to do
something in his November Budget.
There is not even a realistic hope of takeover as it is difficult to
think of anyone who would want it in its present form.

CD-ROMS and toys are to lead WH Smith's fight-back against growing
competition from the major supermarket operators who are muscling in on
its traditional magazine, book and stationery patch.
The group already has multimedia sections in 33 stores, and by the
vitally important Christmas trading period it expects to have these and
children's departments in 100 of its larger stores, which account for
half its turnover.
The shops chain as a whole is being revamped to clarify the in-store
layout and produce a brighter image. It is hoped to instal the new look
in 400 of the 547 outlets within a couple of months at an initial cost
of #5m. Promotional activity is to be more aggressive, with spending up
to #10m this year.
At the same time the group has a cost-cutting operation in hand with
some 1000 job losses already flagged out of a total workforce of 30,000.
The group is to shake up its board to increase the number of executive
directors to eight against six non-executives. At present there are
three executives, eight non-executives and chairman Jeremy Hardie, who
will remain in his post.
The heads of the major divisions will join the main board, creating
younger directors who are at the sharp end of the businesses. Chief
executive Sir Malcolm Field will step down in a year, and the group is
already looking for a successor.
The extent to which Smith was losing out to the superstores was driven
home when it made a profits warning in May. The actual results for the
year to the beginning of June are in line with this. Profits were 7.6%
down at #115m before exceptionals, despite sales a tenth up at #2689m.
The final dividend is held at 10.4p.
The main retail chain saw a 16% decline to #65m in operating profits
on a marginal contraction in sales, though the group believes the peak
of competitive pressure from the superstores has probably passed.
The other retail operations, Virgin Our Price music shops and
Waterstone's bookshops, performed better. Do-It-All, the DIY chain
half-owned by Boots, trimmed losses from #24.4m to #17.4m, with sales
down 6%, though those in refitted units moved ahead.
Smith shares edged up 1p to 371p but analysts are sceptical about
whether it will see off the competition which they consider can only
increase, for example through the discounting of magazine cover prices.

Clare Henry meets John Bellany, whose retrospective exhibition at the
Festival confirms his status as one of the great printmakers of the age
JOHN BELLANY is in great form. His Festival exhibition opening at the
Talbot Rice Gallery was a success. He relishes the Festival, ''so many
things to enthrall; we must be the luckiest people in the world! Take
Yo-Yo Ma. Fabulous! Two hours of magic. He just oozed talent. Walked on,
sat down, took the bow and drew it across the strings with a lovely
languid movement. He knew -- we all knew -- he just couldn't go wrong.''
Bellany can empathise with that. ''It happens to an artist once in a
blue moon. You concentrate, focus, and then relax. You're on peak form.
It's almost spiritual. It's a fabulous feeling.''
Drawing on copper with an etching needle is, Bellany believes, similar
to using a bow. ''An etched line is sensual, it can be gentle yet
piercing and concise. I've always made etchings, right since I visited
Rembrandt's Amsterdam studio as a postgraduate.
''His copper-etching plates made my mouth water. Printmaking's bonus
is that you can produce multiple copies. But that's not why I do
etchings. I make them because of the lovely sensual way you draw into
the wax ground on copper. The line has a quality you can't possibly get
with pencil or brush, and the acid and copper give beautiful effects,''
he says.
His two-part Festival show demonstrates the importance of printmaking
in his career with a major retrospective of half his 120 prints made
over 30 years, plus some humdinger oils, never seen in Scotland before,
and big and bold as befits the big Talbot Rice Gallery.
It's rare that a painter's reputation is matched by his prints, but
this exhibition confirms Bellany as one of the great printmakers of the
age.
Bellany's prints echo the themes of his oils: his lifelong obsession
with the sea, its drama, fishing boats, and gutted fish; the puritanical
ethos of his Port Seton upbringing; his love for wife and family; his
guilt about sex and religion: all transposed into symbolic, universal
images delineated with wiry line in stark, graphic, and ominous
simplicity.
One print, made just last week, is a ''beezer'' according to his
master printer at Edinburgh Printmakers, Alfons Bytautas. ''We have an
excellent 13-year artist-printer relationship, and 'beezer' is his top
mark!'' laughs Bellany. It's called Wanton Bride. ''Isn't that a
wonderful title? There's a painting in the Talbot Rice also called
Wanton Bride. Not the same image. I just like the name!''
Bytautas says Bellany turns up like a whirlwind, gets fired up, and
it's all systems go. ''He loves it! His is a very pure kind of etching;
a painter's approach. He doesn't rely on any gimmicks. The technique is
as simple as you can get -- with some pretty amazing results,'' says
Bytautas.
Bytautas first editioned for Bellany with the Celtic Quintet in 1982.
''I introduced him to sugar-lift technique which facilitates textures
and washes. Picasso used it in his Buffon prints. John said 'Bloody
hell, this is really great! Give me another six plates!' He's so fast
and prolific.''
Bellany believes in draughtsmanship: ''You can be taught all the fancy
techniques in the world. If you can't draw, it's no good. Drawing is the
rock. Look at Titian or Poussin. You have to learn to draw first; then
you can extemporise.''
We are in Bellany's Edinburgh home drinking aqua libra. A reformed
drinker, alcohol never passes his lips. The room is lined with his
pictures and has fantastic views over the Firth of Forth. ''You can see
the boats going to and fro, and the sunsets are magnificent! It all
feeds into the paintings.''
On the wall is a huge 1964 oil done at Inverleith, in his postgraduate
year. His wife, Helen, supplies drinks then leaves us to talk. But her
almond eyes are all around, in every painting Bellany has ever done. She
is his muse, his constant subject. Yet in his work, unlike reality, she
rarely smiles. Seductive, yes, but solemn, stern, even grim. Calvinism,
his other driving force, still guides his brush.
We reminisce about Glasgow Print Studio's Ingram Street days back in
1977 where he had his first west-coast show. He was not yet a household
name. It was also the inauguration of the Print Studio Gallery. ''It was
a major, major exhibition for me. That private view will go down in
history! We had roast pig and it went on till 5am. Remember?'' I
remember.
The wild Scot from the south with a prodigious appetite for the booze
-- and for fun. ''I work hard, but I was always very fond of fun.'' His
eyes twinkle.
He has managed to avoid what he calls ''the Bamber Gascoigne disease''
--intellectualising. ''If you're not feeling it with your eyes and your
heart, what's the point?'' he says.
Bellany sees etching as lyrical, ''like creating a poem instead of
writing a novel! You just pick up a plate and do it. Beethoven composed
string quartets as well as symphonies. Shakespeare wrote love sonnets
along with tragedies. And you've got all that great printmaking
tradition to build on, to expand, and enliven. Etchings come direct from
the artist's hand. You can see my touch.''
As far as Bellany is concerned, no mistakes are allowed: ''You can't
alter anything on an etching; you can't 'rub out'. Some people use
endless rubbers when they draw. I've never used a rubber in my life.
Rubbers should be thrown in the bin!'' he says.
In Glasgow in the seventies, his prints were editioned by John Taylor,
Elspeth Lamb, and John Mackechnie. In the mid-1980s he was lured to
Aberdeen where Arthur Watson and Beth Fisher printed for him. Or more
accurately, for he was mortally ill then, plates were brought to the
London house where he somehow found strength to work on them. He's
always happy to hand over the plate, once drawn, for processing and
printing by experts.
Old Man and the Sea 1987, inspired by Hemingway's novel, also contains
colour screenprints printed in Aberdeen and recently he's made colour
carborundum etchings based on his watercolours -- which sadly lack his
direct touch.
There were a few lithographs with Ken Duffy, now director of the new
Northern Print Studio, early on. ''But that's secondary. Etching was
always my favourite,'' says Bellamy.
Cataloguing his prints is a nightmare. Many were never editioned and
some exist in one copy only. There was no market then. Copies were just
given to friends.
His Calvinistic upbringing ensures he works every day. ''I can't help
it. It's like breathing. I've been lucky. It's such a gift -- I have to
make the most of it. As you get older time is precious.''
It was his only oblique reference to his near-miraculous survival
after alcohol abuse resulted in an emergency liver transplant. A new
liver has delivered a fairy-tale life, reunited with his first wife and
his three offspring.
One lyrical oil, a hot mass of red and yellow blooms, dates from the
time of his operation. ''I was making an emotional, not an intellectual
statement. I'd never ever painted flowers, but folk kept bringing them.
I learnt a lot about colour from those bouquets -- more than from
swotting up a book on colour theory. What's creativity? That's the
dilemma. But for sure, you learn with your eyes.''
Bellany's very latest etchings use the new ecologically sound methods
being pioneered by Edinburgh Printmakers. ''There's been a palace
revolution in the etching world,'' explains Bytautas. ''John's putting a
toe in the water and has done a couple of spanking images. It points the
way ahead.''
Bellany's eternal optimism shows in his parting shot. ''You have to be
like a snow plough and keep on going. Artists always take a lot of
buffeting. But it's not about commercialism, it's about fruitful
labour.''

YOU could call it painting by numbers. The Government used to have six
neat pigeonholes to put us all in, ranging from ''professional'' to
''unskilled''. Now, it seems, the great giveaway is not your job but
your postcode. Could six letters and numbers hold the key to your
persona or even your wallet? ''Yep'' yelped the girl at CACI Information
Service. In return for my postcode, she'd fax me a detailed description
of myself in a couple of minutes.
I loitered nervously by the office fax machine. It was like waiting by
a photo booth for your still damp and pungent pictures to curl down into
view, afraid to turn your back lest someone else grabs them and runs off
sniggering.
You share your code with about 15 of your neighbours. The first thing
to say about the residents of G63 9BP is that they are all truly
wonderful people. (After all, some of them might read this.) But we're a
very diverse lot. We include a physiotherapist, a plumber, an
electrician, a policeman, a lollypop lady, a professor of gynaecology, a
flautist, and two mewling and puking infants. White collars, blue
collars, collars smeared with regurgitated baby rice. I'd got as far as
remembering that the plumber and the prof were both dab hands on the
bagpipes (honestly) when the fax started spewing out the real us.
Or was it? We're much posher than we thought. ''Type 1'' in fact out
of 54. We like ground coffee, mineral water, and fresh fish. We drink
port and gin. We're 2.8 times more likely than average to own National
Savings Certificates. We read the Telegraph and the FT and we're into
gardening, French restaurants, stately homes, ski-ing, sailing, and
10-pin bowling. We're ''very happy with our standard of living''.
Those familiar with us in G63 9BP may find these two-dimensional
images of affluence and dynamism rather difficult to square with the
more motley reality.
The whole business reminded me of an encounter with a clairvoyant who
is uncannily accurate in half what she tells you and unimaginably wide
of the mark for the rest. In general, alas, we were diagnosed as
considerably more affluent than we are, which may explain the
extraordinary preponderance of junk mail, doorstep salesmen, and pest
calls from fitted kitchen companies in our neighbourhood.
Out of interest we asked CACI to diagnose a colleague's postcode too.
Anvar lives in the West End, not a million miles from Glasgow University
but in an area of traditional tenements inhabited by a diverse group
ranging from affluent Asians to hippie types. She came out as ''Type
22'', which may sound like a frigate but is ''students and young
professionals''. Type 22s aren't rich but they are oh so trendy. They're
into bottled lager and the Guardian/Independent. Lots of vegetarians.
Favourite purchases include computers and tumble dryers.
''We're much more normal than this,'' protests Anvar. ''This makes us
sound like academics, running off our latest book on the computer before
popping out for an ethnic dinner after filling the tumble. I've never
plugged mine in. This reeks of something fake.''
I put some of this to Greg Bradford, the MD of CACI. ''It's based on
the premis that birds of a feather flock together. People in the same
neighbourhoods have similar purchasing habits,'' he said.
It's precisely because consumer markets have become more complex and
fragmented that traditional classifications are no longer relevant, he
purrs. His system, Acorn (a Classification of Residential
Neighbourhoods) uses information from the 1991 Census to identify six
broad categories ranging from A (Thriving), through B (Expanding), C
(Rising), D (Settling), and E (Aspiring) to F (Striving). All very pc.
The categories are subdivided into 54 types (eg, partially gentrified
multi-ethnic, well-off suburbia etc). Small areas covering 150
households, or around 10 adjacent postcodes, are given a type number
which is used for ''understanding'' the people there.
Companies go to CACI and rent your name and address because research
has shown your type is interested in what they sell. ''It's just a way
of making companies more efficent and successful,'' croons Greg.
Are these the velvet tones of Big Brother, not the Orwellian voice of
the state but the subtle intrusion of a market economy that got too
clever for its own good? I'd be more worried if ''my type'' was more
like me. As it is, the most I have to bear is the nuisance of people
trying to sell me lots of things I don't want.
Besides, I have a couple of weapons of defence. The Mailing Preference
Service (Freepost 22, London W1E 7EZ) guarantees to stop most direct
mail. Earlier this year a similar service was launched for phone users
(0800 398893). But cold callers on the doorstep are more of a challenge.
Now where's the Rottweiler?

HEAVEN knows, a football team like Ayr United needs an attraction to
keep the fans entertained. The diversion, against Celtic last weekend,
came in the form of the local top cop.
The boss of Strathclyde polis Ayr division is Ms Sandra Hood, who
manages to combine being the very epitome of efficiency with an
attractive demeanour. Despite her imposing high rank, some of the
terracing tams at Somerset Park showed definitely sexist tendencies by
directing some comments at Ms Hood.
The top copette, no stranger to dialogue with the public, responded
that if the chaps did not behave they might be ''getting a bed for the
night''. Perhaps her message was not clear enough, but the bears were
immensely cheered by this suggestion.
Money down drain
TALES of empty reservoirs prompt the Rev E R Marr of Uplawmoor to pass
on a story of another hot summer when a Scottish town council, which he
chooses not to name, met in full session to discuss the issue of public
water supplies. The burgh engineer reported that the town reservoir was
less than half full.
He said the council had to face up to building a new reservoir at a
cost of #500,000. An enraged councillor intervened: ''What are my
constituents going to say when they hear we are spending all that money
on a new reservoir when we can't even fill the one we've got?''
Recipe for fear
FROM the Tramway artistic hot spot in Glasgow we receive the programme
to Dark Lights -- an exhibition of new work from Scotland. It is, we are
told, a ''daring investment into the future'', and it is recommended
that we ''leave our preconceptions at home and bring along open minds,
willing hearts and a sense of adventure . . .''
And who could suppress such feelings when the list of performances
include artists such as Jonathan Monk, whose previous video works
include drinking a yard of ale, walking a dead chicken across the road,
and watching paint dry. Yes, really.
Also included in this menu of artistic delights is Crush's Bloodbirds,
who offer a performance called Recipe For Survival. The recipe runs as
follows: ''Take heavy water and some coagulated fear. Bring to the boil
with sharp light and tar. Beat vigorously until there's a noticeable
bruise. Filter pieces of a crash into some melted lipstick and poach
over a little betrayal.
''Beat a sharp breath into five wet trees, 10 measures of wasps, some
dark glasses, and a tequila slammer. Test the stamina with three
different forks and push down too deeply. Slap for the duration of Dolly
Parton's It's All Wrong, But It's All Right and take time out for a
little cry.
''To the sound of horses, skin three friends, salt them, and leave
them to dry in the sun. Serve wildly as Bloodbirds swoop from above.''
Or you could stay at home and order a Chinese takeaway.
Tartan nuptials
EDINBURGH'S lucrative tartan-for-tourists industry -- never backward
at coming forward to find a clan connection for the eager and monied --
has this year excelled itself. Honeymooning Japanese couples are jetting
in to Scotland for mock weddings in full Highland rig: the kilted grooms
an oriental silhouette of the Young Pretender, bedecked in the tartans
of the Hunting Yamaha and Dress Suzuki, their brides in Flora Macdonald
white but without the oars.
From the heart of the capital Masahito Sakamoto of Jascot Travel Ltd
woos his fellow countrymen and women to his adopted land, enticing with
brochures offering the never-to-be-forgotten tartan thrill of a ''Royal
Scottish Wedding''.
The starry-eyed Japanese couples can create their own Brigadoon and
plight their troth all over again as party of a #6000 10-day trip which
takes in such delights as a stop at the Falls of Lenny, the odd woollen
mill or five, and Fort William's coastal bypass.
The wedding ceremony is carried out amid peacocks at an Edinburgh
hotel with a form of words uttered by an 83-year-old retired Church of
Scotland minister. Thrown in is a hurl in a carriage, a piper, flowers,
champagne, and that most traditional of Japanese festivities -- a video.
Buckfast fliers
LOCAL MP Helen Liddell won't like it, but the Airdrie team which
competed last weekend in the Scottish mountain bike championship was
called the Buckfast Valley Club. The chaps, we are told, appeared
horribly fit and undamaged physically or mentally by any exposure to the
famous Monklands jungle juice.
Drop of nostalgia
AT a time when traditional measures such as pints, gallons, and quarts
are under attack from European bureaucrats, it is good to see the pony
make a comeback. The pony is a measure of beer much favoured by wee
Glasgow men in bunnets.
The bunnets were out for the evening to drink whisky but needed the
odd drop of beer to help the hard liquor down. But not too much. The
pony, either a third of a pint or a quarter of a pint depending on
location, was the answer.
With the demise of pubs full of wee men in bunnets, the pony had
virtually disappeared from the pub scene. Full marks to Tennents Taverns
for bringing the wee horsey measure back in a special offer, open even
to those not wearing bunnets, of a whisky and pony for #1.35.
Now, where's that skip hat?
Greek to us
INTERESTING banner at the Rangers game in Cyprus last night. ''Don't
forget 1619'', it said. No, not a bunch of numerically dyslexic Gers
supporters but Greek Cypriots making a political point about compatriots
still missing after the Turkish invasion of the north part of their
island.

of Edinburgh, Norman Irons.
It has increased its workforce by 50%, now employing more than 1700
people at its Edinburgh base, and has increased exports by 72% since it
won the same award five years ago.
At the end of its last financial year, the company reported a turnover
of #90m, exporting to 110 countries.
International sales and marketing director Derek McCracken said
yesterday that he was delighted Ethicon had increased exports in a
difficult market situation, and that it was a ''tremendous achievement''
by all concerned.

WITH the eighteenth century's most famous chaconne as its climax, the
second of Thomas Zehetmair's late-night Bach recitals had a clear-cut
destination. Yet in no sense has he been making a marathon out of these
demanding sonatas and partitas for solo violin. Confining himself to two
works per programme, he has proved that what may seem short in duration
is amply long in physical and spiritual reward.
The sheer integrity of his playing on Tuesday, indeed, was such that
he did not treat the D minor partita's closing chaconne as some
spectacular mountain peak. His was not the hit-'em-for-six approach
adopted by so many virtuosi today. Without the massive gear changes and
heavy accents whereby other players draw attention to each section of
this long movement, he performed it quietly and intensely, thus
compelling his large (and notably youthful) audience to listen to the
music.
Not that there is much risk of inattention when an artist of this
calibre stands alone in front of an audience. Being the most meticulous
of performers, he ensured that not a single detail of Bach's writing
went for nothing. Yet there was no hint of pedantry in his precision,
because it was invariably placed at the service of a profound yet
instinctive musical understanding.
From first note to last, therefore, each movement was shaped with an
unerring sense of form and direction. The huge fugue that is the heart
of the A minor sonata was vividly and tirelessly defined. Even in the
fine-spun slow movement of this work, Zehetmair permitted himself no
expressive laxness but was happy to let the music speak for itself. This
it did with a wonderful soft buoyancy and with the eloquent simplicity
of art concealing art.

<TEXT>
A FORMER sea captain who ''ruled with a rod of iron'' was sacked as
harbour master after he upset clients at a Scottish port, an industrial
tribunal in Inverness was told yesterday.
The head of Scrabster Harbour Trust, at Thurso, Mr Geoffrey Minter,
53, told the tribunal: ''It's easy to order people about in a ship but
not so in the business world. You have to take regard of people.''
The laird of a nearby Caithness estate and director of several
companies described how he was showing around representatives of an
international fish-processing company, which was thinking of setting up
in the harbour.
He said he was appalled to hear Captain Alex Madden, 55, tell them:
''It's a shame you don't pay your bills on time.'' The firm's managing
director was insulted and the company declined to set up their
development at Scrabster.
Mr Madden, now of Culduthel Road, Inverness, who is claiming unfair
dismissal, had confused the firm with another of a similar name.
Mr Minter said: ''The harbour master's technical skills were good but
his way of handling people was not. He adopted an aggressive attitude to
customers.''
The tribunal was also told by fishing boat agent Jim Cowie, 45, that
Mr Madden had a rule about road tankers coming on to the pier to fuel
boats. When Mr Cowie managed to circumvent this, Mr Madden arrived to
see him ''speechless with rage''.
He added: ''He had a confrontational approach. He ruled the harbour
with a rod of iron.''
Trust development consultant Craig Anderson, 39, said he was
''dumbstruck, gobsmacked'' when he discovered the captain had advised
the harbour's best customer, P &amp; O Ferries, to make contingency plans to
use another port if part of the cliff above the harbour collapsed.
Mr Anderson said: ''The cliff was not even a potential problem.''
The tribunal was told that customers who stopped using the port
because of Mr Madden had returned since his departure last November and
that, now, it was run in a much better manner.
The tribunal continues today.

SCOTLAND'S bottled water manufacturers are experiencing an
unprecedented boost in sales because of England's water shortage.
Companies are working flat out, with overtime and weekend working for
everyone, in a bid to keep pace with orders from south of the Border.
Mr Bob Watson, production manager of the Forfar-based Strathmore
Mineral Water Company, said: ''We have never known anything quite like
it before. This is normally the busiest time of year for us but this
summer the demand has been exceptional.
''It's a case of working night and day, seven days a week, turning out
several hundred bottles a minute.'' The company takes its water from the
Vale of Strathmore.
Findlays at Stenton, East Lothian, bottlers and suppliers of Findlay's
natural mineral water, is turning out 2700 bottles an hour.
Mr Marcus Findlay, a farmer and managing director of the two-year-old
enterprise, said: ''We are normally busy at this time of year when the
Edinburgh Festival visitors are filling the hotels and restaurants. But
this year we have also had a big demand from England. Many of the wells
down south have dried up.''
Findlays takes water from the Pressmennan Well and Mr Findlay said:
''It never dries up. Two years ago, it was analysed by council officials
and came out top in terms of purity. I then decided to bottle it and
sell it.''
At Oldhamstocks, south of Dunbar, East Lothian, it is the same story
with Scottish Border Springs, whose Purely Scottish has been turned out
in a number of flavours for the past year at a rate of 9000 bottles an
hour.
Mr Stair Brown, managing director of SBS, said: ''I came to this part
of Scotland to retire and have a quiet life. But having discovered this
water which we take from a 400ft bore-hole, curiosity got the better of
me.''
He said that the hot spell had been good for business and the only
problem had been finding an adequate supply of bottles in which to send
the water to England.

TELLING teenagers what's good for them is a tricky business. They have
a strange habit of ignoring adults' advice. And, as yet another
Government-driven health campaign targeting Britain's youngsters gets
underway, health promoters face the familiar problem of how to break
through the boredom barrier with healthy home truths.
Their record down the decades has been far from imposing. From those
embarrassing and patronising ''personal hygiene'' films of the sixties
and seventies, shown to squirming school pupils by po-faced teachers, to
the terror-tactics of today's anti-smoking TV ads and the
over-enthusiasm of ''we're all pals together'' leaflets, health messages
have proved a massive turn-off to the average teenager.
It's a fact reflected in the latest official survey, which found 12%
of Scottish youngsters aged 12 to 15 were regular smokers in 1994 -- the
same percentage as in 1986.
But in Grampian a strange phenomenon is taking shape. In a region
where nearly 25% of 11 to 17-year-olds are smokers, and where less than
half take the recommended amount of exercise every week, teenagers are
now openly admitting they are signing the slogans, collecting the
leaflets and thoroughly enjoying the hype of the latest, innovative
youth health campaign, which has pipped the Government's new nationwide
initiative by three months.
Compact Health, the brainchild of Grampian Health Board's pioneering
Health Promotions team, is going down a storm with its target audience.
The concept is breathtakingly simple: the campaign, like much of
today's consumer-orientated advertising, uses youth culture to deliver
the goods. But this is no adult's-eye view of what young people want --
the ideas have come from teenagers themselves and the campaign materials
are already showing signs of achieving cult status among 11 to
17-year-olds.
Designed to look like psychedelic CD covers, Compact Health's two
debut leaflets feature the hilariously-doctored lyrics of bands such as
Teenage Fag Club, Bake That and Simply Dead. Greatest Eats (Volume One)
contains a sickly-sweet Kylie Meringue's I Shouldn't Be So Tucky,
warning over-indulgent youngsters about the dangers of pigging out,
while role models, the rough 'n' ready Bran Jovi, croon about the cool
''high-fibre cowboy'', with starch in his shirt and ''lots in his chow
(boy)''.
Volume Two -- Cigs, Sweat and Rock 'n' Roll -- warns about the dangers
of smoking, with Stingk's unforgettable Ten Smokers' Tales (''Every
breath and hair, all the clothes you wear, I'll be smelling you . . .
''), and extols the benefits of exercise through Sweat, Sweat, Sweat's
Sweat Little Mystery. Both leaflets come with detachable (fake) compact
disc, bearing short, positive messages about choosing a healthier
lifestyle.
The fun materials appeal to Aberdeen chums Joanne Sim, 13, Emily
Freeman, 14, and Kirsty Bishop, 15, who describe them as ''ace'',
''cool'' and ''a good laugh''.
The girls talk confidently about healthy eating -- although it's a
means towards thinness, rather than fitness, in their opinion -- but
they admit to eating junk food when away from home.
''I know what I should eat, but we all tend to meet up in burger bars
and it's difficult to find anything there that's not fattening'' says
Emily.
The anti-smoking leaflet is particularly important to the teenagers,
who say most of their girlfriends smoke.
''They think it looks cool and will attract boys, but it makes you
smell awful and most of the nice boys are fit non-smokers who don't want
to go out with a girl who smokes, anyway,'' says Kirsty.
Uniquely, the leaflets have not been distributed through schools or
health centres (although they are available for distribution on
request), but can be had at major record stores, including HMV and
Virgin. By taking hip and humorous health messages to young people in
their own territory, the campaign cleverly avoids the
''voice-of-authority syndrome'' common to traditional campaigns.
Ironically, however, some teenagers would like to see Compact Health
come to school. Kevin Paterson, 15, from Westhill, in Gordon District,
says it would brighten up personal and social education classes no end.
''It's far more fun than sitting with a text book in front of you.
More young people would pay attention to what's being said about smoking
and healthy eating if they had leaflets like these to look at,'' he
says.
Louie MacAllan, managing director of Health Promotions, is more than a
little relieved by the response to the campaign.
''Health promoters have been rightly criticised for having failed to
reach young people and make good health attractive to them, mainly
because campaigners have been patronising, or have used scare tactics
about illness and death, which in fact have little effect on the young.
''It's rewarding to see that Compact Health has been received with so
much enthusiasm. Although a formal evaluation will not be done until
later in the autumn, the feedback we've received so far has been very
encouraging.
''Music and humour are the key elements of the campaign, and happily
for us, they attract teenagers from all types of background, which means
we're reaching everyone.''
Louie says she will be interested to see how the Government's new
campaign will be promoted. With so many health authorities in the UK
approaching her team for advice, it remains to be seen whether the
Department of Health will take a leaf out of Grampian's book, or stick
to a more traditional format.
Compact Health's success so far has prompted plans for follow-up CD
leaflets, dealing with the more tricky topics of sexual health and drug
and alcohol abuse. To help boost funding, the Health Promotions team
hopes to attract partners from businesses and organisations with an
interest in young people. Once again, they will ask local youngsters for
ideas -- and Kirsty, Emily and Joanne already have a suggestion:
''They could make a video with lots of cute guys singing the songs --
we'd pay even more attention to that!''

PACING relentlessly in front of a map of the USA that's almost as big
as the USA, master-satirist Will Durst provides a minutely-informative
dissection of American socio-political mores.
You will laugh. You will also learn. Why the state of Wyoming is
square. In which town you can purchase a drive-through daiquiri. Where
toad-licking is illegal. The differences between Senate and Congress.
How America is both awe-inspiring and hideous. Most importantly, you'll
learn how an expert practitioner of slow-burning comedy induces
cumulative face-ache in an audience sated with smiles and laughter.
Roused by Will Durst: a mighty fine state to be in.

PEEPOLYKUS really delighted Fringe-goers last year with their
marvellously ingenious mime piece No Man's Land. There's considerably
more dialogue in their current show, Squid, but the sight gags and
tomfoolery are still to the fore.
Set in a lonely lighthouse, Squid brings together the eccentric old
hand, Eddy (John Nicholson) and new boy Norvik (Philip Bogli) in a
scenario which looks beyond the expected -- and highly comic -- tensions
of their relationship to the more serious relationship each has with the
sea.
Actually, there isn't a fiercesomely tentacled critter as suggested by
the title -- maybe that's down to Emma Powell not appearing -- but there
are lots of clever touches both in the design and in the performances.

DUNEDIN Income Growth Investment Trust, boosted by a good first half,
is forecasting an increase in its full-year dividend.
Net asset value of the #232m trust rose 16.3% to 725.2p per share
during the six months to July 31, outperforming a 15.0% rise in the FTSE
Actuaries All-Share index.
This prompted the Edinburgh-based trust to raise the interim dividend
by 2.2% to 9.1p and promise a higher full-year payout than the 26.6p
declared last time.
''I think the interim should give a good guide as to the minimum the
board would feel able to pay for the full year in terms of percentage
increase,'' said fund manager Alan Clark.
Earnings per share rose 8.5% to 16.55p in the first half as the trust
benefitted from high gearing at a time of rising share prices.
The trust has #41m of debenture and preference stock and #45m of
short-term borrowings in the form of commercial paper, giving it a
gearing of 37%.
It sold #11m of gilts during the first half in line with its policy of
gradually running down the fixed-income portfolio to reduce borrowing.
The trust ended the six-month period holding #239m of equities and
#79m of fixed-income investments.
It took profits in the best-performing sectors of the stock market,
such as pharmaceuticals and food retailing, and increased its exposure
to under-performers such as general retailers and electricity companies.
The trust also boosted investments in smaller companies with high
earnings and dividend growth prospects.
Looking ahead, Dunedin Income said its portfolio was well placed to
benefit from an expected increase in company dividends in the second
half of the year.

MORE disputes within one of Britain's richest families could be
triggered as a result of a takeover approach to Littlewoods, the
privately owned football pools, mail order and stores company.
Littlewoods belongs to 32 members of the family of Sir John Moores,
the autocratic founder of the company who died aged 97 in 1993. The
younger shareholders, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, are
thought to be eager to turn their holdings into cash rather than having
their wealth locked up in a private company. However, older family
members remain more loyal to Sir John's legacy.
Each member of the family is worth more than #30m on average. But
there is evidently no offer on the table as yet.
''An interest has been shown and an approach has been made but it does
not constitute what any business can consider a formal offer,'' declared
a Littlewoods spokeswoman.
Despite tensions in the family, its senior members have tightened
their grip on the business over the past year by ousting top managers
brought in from outside. Barry Dale was sacked as chief executive in
May. His deputy, Prodip Guha, has also gone, as has former vice-chairman
Sir Desmond Pitcher.
Mr Dale did not take his removal lying down and is suing for wrongful
dismissal. Reports suggest that it is he who is now trying to come back
through the front door by leading a bid, worth some #1100m. Mr Dale is
believed to be on holiday and was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Littlewoods' pools business has received a hard knock from the
National Lottery. The group blamed expected job losses topping 500 at
its offices in Cardiff, Liverpool and Glasgow on competition from this.
But the shops and mail order activities are expanding, with the
creation of 2000 jobs announced earlier this year. Littlewoods owns 20%
of the new Costco Warehouse Club in Glasgow, which will employ 200
people.
Nevertheless, the Littlewoods shops chain lags behind the competition
in the High Street, and revitalising it would be the major task facing a
new owner.

THE pundits were split last night over the chances of a cut in key
German interest rates after a meeting of the Bundesbank council later
today, but the majority still thought the central bank would stay its
hand on rates until next month.
Hopes that a reduction in the discount rate, which has been held at 4%
since March 31, would come this week instead were boosted by a sharp
fall yesterday in the Bundesbank's money market repo rate and an
unexpected contraction, revealed on Tuesday, in the main measure of the
German money supply in July.
The central bank allowed the repo rate to fall to 4.39% from 4.45%,
but the drop was not a great surprise to most Bundesbank watchers.
German inflation has picked up over the summer months, but dropped
back to 2.3% in July. Many economists take the view that the Bundesbank
would want to see further signs of falling inflation before conceding a
reduction in key interest rates.
In London, James Capel's Adam Cole made the point that the recent
volatility in currency markets, where the dollar has been gaining ground
on the mark and the yen, might steer the Bundesbank away from an early
cut in rates.
But comments by the central bank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, that
lower rates could not be ruled out kept the speculation alive.
Tietmeyer told a Japanese newspaper that further rate cuts would
depend on developments in inflation and the money supply creating the
scope for a reduction.
''If all the information is going in the right direction, I am not
excluding some room for manoeuvre in reducing interest rates,'' he said.
Signs of a slowdown in the pace of activity in Germany, where
manufacturers have been hit by the strength of the mark, have put
pressure on the monetary authorities to loosen policy as quickly as
possible. But the Bundesbank does not have a reputation for rushing its
fences.

THE knee-jerk reactions to the Scottish Constitutional Convention's
developing proposals for the financing of Scotland's future, though
predictable, totally fail to understand the position.
Our scheme, outlined in Towards Scotland's Parliament five years ago,
stated a fundamental principle and set out a mechanism to achieve that.
The principle was ''assigned revenues'', defined then as ''revenues
assigned to Scotland's parliament as of right''.
The method then was the identification of income tax and VAT collected
in Scotland, followed by the assignation of a further sum on the
principle of the long-established ''equalisation'' formula based on a
needs assessment -- a formula accepted by all parties, and which Michael
Forsyth has commendably sworn to defend with his political life.
The principle remains totally unchanged. The method has been
simplified, but the result will be exactly the same -- namely that
Scotland's parliament will have not only full democratic power over its
expenditure but real and entrenched shared power of its income, based
not on a block grant at the whim of Westminster, but on an assigned and
defined proportion, laid down in tried and tested formulae based on the
principle of equalisation and needs.
We have not retreated one inch from our fundamental moral principle --
that the Scottish people are sovereign, and that through their
democratic parliament they have, within the United Kingdom, real power
over both expenditure and income.
We are still in the midst of a process. We are not designing a
toolshed. We are preparing for a major change that will offer a higher
quality of life to every man, woman, and child in Scotland, and will
give a new confidence, hope, and purposive vision to our nation. Nothing
less will do.

IF this Government, or any other for that matter, had put forward a
proposal to change our well-tested and useful imperial measurements to a
heap of European metric ones, at a vast expense of course, there would
have been such a tide of public opinion against such a proposal that it
would have died the death.
As it is, decisions are made in Brussels by an unelected body of men
that affect us all, in every walk of life, and we have absolutely no
redress.
It is not as though the metric measurements are used world-wide, they
are not. It is a needless imposition, red tape for the hell of it, and
Brussels showing us who is boss.
And it is to be a criminal offence, for goodness sake, if we use what
we are used to -- good imperial measurements. What will they think up
next?

WITH no previous acting experience, Carol Clewlow's dramatisation of
her novel One for The Money could have been a spectacular failure.
Instead, she has an audacious Fringe success on her hands, a nicely
tempered, lunchtime show.
Clewlow sticks to relatively straightforward narration, distilling her
tale of rock star Joanie into tasty chunks. Director Piers Ibbotsen
cleverly elides these passages with stunning acoustic sets by Pete Scott
-- haunting songs of longing and despair -- and complements the words
and songs with a series of moody, arresting images by Simon Veit-Wilson,
projected onto a back screen.
It's a familiar story -- Clewlow acknowledges this with nods to Janis
Joplin -- but spiky humour, ironic insight, and a dazzling array of
colourful images keep it fresh and compelling. At first hesitant,
Clewlow's performance soon asserts itself as spirited and absorbing, as
sparkly as her spangled rock chick's jacket.

CRITICS of the farm subsidy system who claim that farmers get too much
money are failing to look at the wider picture, Scottish Office
Agriculture Minister The Earl of Lindsay said yesterday.
''To take a snapshot view of an industry like farming which is so
cyclical is very misleading,'' he said. ''I can remember some of the
grim times arable farmers have had. We are only a few years past the
last disastrous harvest.
''The way prices are moving just now is not to be seen as a static and
permanent return coming to the arable sector. It is merely part of the
curve. Whether you are in livestock or arable farming, circumstances do
change. Farmers, possibly more than readers of the press, do understand
how farming goes in very long cycles.''
Lord Lindsay, who was speaking after a visit to the Ingliston
headquarters of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, indicated,
however, that arable farmers would be ill-advised to push their claim
for a larger base area as a means of avoiding penalties for overshoot.
The Scottish Office Argiculture Department remained convinced that the
base area was correct, he said, although it would be possible to have
another look at the figures if circumstances justified this.
He pointed out that the penalty for this year's overshoot of 3.8% was
being reduced by 50%. Against the background of the returns arable
farmers were achieving it was a small issue.
But the NFUS is not prepared to shrug it off. It points to the example
of Germany which had a similar problem and now seems poised to achieve
an increase in its base area. ''It was right to do this and the case in
Scotland is just as strong,'' said NFUS president John Ross.
The Minister's fear is that any attempt at renegotiation could result
in more disadvantages than advantages. The perception of agriculture in
some parts of the wider community is that it already attracts too much
money.
He warned that there would be too many people involved in the future
of agriculture who knew little about the industry. That included
politicians, Euro officials, nature conservation experts and those
seeking to introduce different management practices to the countryside.
The challenge to the farmer was to ensure that these groups understood
his needs and the contribution he made to the countryside.
On the burning issue of the day -- the revision of the rules
concerning the allocation of sheep quota from the National Reserve --
there was little sign of movement towards an agreed solution.
The NFUS believes the simplest answer would be to seek additional
quota from Brussels to cover those producers who were previously
rejected under regulations which have since been ruled unlawful by the
High Court in England. The Government line so far has been that Brussels
would not entertain such an approach.
Alternatively, said NFUS chief executive Tom Brady, the Government
could finance an outgoers' scheme to buy up quota and reallocate it to
those who now qualify. The Government response is that there is no
provision in the European regulations for such a scheme.
John Ross said the NFUS would continue to work with the minister to
find a solution but the issue was very complicated. ''We have to protect
our members' interests,'' he emphasised.

SCOTTISH Enterprise yesterday acknowledged that a successful outcome
to ScottishPower's hostile bid for Chester-based Manweb would benefit
the economy north of the Border.
However, it shied away from taking a stance on the regulatory rights
or wrongs of the Glasgow-based electricity company's #1000m bid.
Scottish Enterprise's support was significantly weaker than that given
by The Scottish Council Development and Industry, which has written to
electricity regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild arguing against a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission referral.
A spokesman for Government agency Scottish Enterprise revealed that it
had not made a formal submission to Professor Littlechild.
He said: ''We don't believe we have a role in this matter.''
However, he added: ''Scottish Enterprise fully recognises and supports
the wider economic benefit of having a strong company operating on a
UK-wide basis from headquarters in Scotland.''
Meanwhile, Glasgow Development Agency has also urged the
director-general of Fair Trading to recommend that ScottishPower's bid
for Manweb be allowed to proceed without a reference to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
GDA chairman Michael Lunn has written to the OFT saying he believes
there are no competition issues raised by the offer.
''No market distortion will arise in England and Wales because, as we
understand it, ScottishPower has to sell the electricity it generates
and sends down the interconnector to England via the England and Wales
pool. In any case, ScottishPower's exports are physically limited by the
capacity of the interconnector to a tiny proportion of the England and
Wales generating market,'' he said.
Mr Lunn added: ''We believe that the efficiency gains ScottishPower
has already demonstrated in its own area will be of benefit to the
Liverpool area which currently has a local utility who have virtually
withdrawn from the competitive market. It is an area with which we can
readily identify.''
* JOHN BRIDGEMAN was yesterday named as new director-general of Fair
Trading by the President of the Board of Trade, Ian Lang.
Mr Bridgeman, managing director of British Alcan Aluminium and a
visiting professor of management at Keele University, will take over
from Sir Bryan Carsberg as head of the Office of Fair Trading.

TRAVEL agent AT Mays is launching a special Business Direct service
for Scottish companies that spend less than #50,000 a year on business
travel, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The scheme, launched in conjunction with Diners Club, includes a
special telephone booking service, credit facilities of up to 60 days,
and personal credit cards for key executives to charge expenses on.
Jill Henderson, business development manager of AT Mays, said the main
advantages of the new product were personalised service, flexible
payment facilities and centralised billing. She played down the
potential for special discounts on air fares, car hire and hotel bills,
saying users of Business Direct would mainly gain from improved
efficiency.
Users of Business Direct will phone AT Mays business travel
specialists in Clydebank and Ayr to discuss their needs and make
reservations.
The Business Direct staff will have instant access to computer files
showing the particular needs of each firm and its key travelling staff.
In theory, a non-smoking vegetarian who likes a window seat and an extra
gin and tonic when flying should be automatically catered for.
Business Direct clients in the Western Isles will even be able to
discuss their travel needs with a Gaelic speaker in Stornoway.
Tickets and vouchers will be sent out by post and all billing will be
done centrally via a special arrangement that Diners Club will negotiate
with each client.

District Council, which takes in the town hit by the disaster in 1988,
is acting in a liaison capacity and said: ''The invitation is open to
anyone from the town who wants to attend. The council is trying to

More than 2000 relatives and friends from both sides of the Atlantic

Dumfries MP Sir Hector Monro will officially present the cairn, built
of stones from a quarry near Lockerbie, to President Bill Clinton as a

NOT a good night for the lads, this. A city merchant, a collier and a

brewer could console himself. The merchant, in paying more attention to
his business than his beautiful young wife, loses out to Lord Elgin --
and promptly loses his marbles.
Sheila Douglas, from Perth, and Fifers Irene Riggs and Tom Polytello
were our guides through this latest dip into the Greig-Duncan

odd wobble. But there's more to singing than just learning a song (feat

despite some promising story lines, this was the first time I've left

it do you any good? Which? Way to Health magazine concludes in a recent
article that most people do seem to feel better after it, though at #20
a session, it could be an expensive form of de-stressing.
You can obtain lists of reflexologists in your area by contacting the
British Complementary Medicine Association -- 01242 226770 or the
Institute for Complementary Medicine (Reflexology), PO Box 194, London,

health problems.
It wants people to take responsibility for themselves and complete a

* WOMEN who have recently been discharged from a psychiatric hospital
are three times more likely to commit suicide than they were 30 years
ago.
Studies carried out at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital reveal that the
pattern for men is the reverse: their suicide rate fell by 40%. The
researchers say: ''If the increase is due to earlier discharge with
inadequate community support, community services need to be developed
before beds are reduced further.''
* HAVING children protects against breast cancer. A Norwegian study
reported in the British Journal of Cancer in August reveals that the
chances of developing breast cancer is 37% lower among women who had
given birth 20 years previously.
* NICOTINE patches do help heavy smokers quit, even if they have tried
them once and failed. A report in the British Medical Journal found that
6% of people in a trial of 300 smokers of 15 cigarettes or more a day

FARMERS who are planning to save some of this year's grain harvest for
use as seed have been warned to take particular care in making their
selection.
The exceptional summer weather has significantly increased the risk of
micro-cracking and, therefore, the potential for grain infections and
consequent loss of germination, according to Paul Rooke, seeds manager
with the UK Agricultural Supply Trade Association.
His advice is that farmers planning to use farm-saved seed should
submit samples to a seed-testing laboratory for a germination test.
''This will add a little cost to the process, but it could also prove to
be the best possible investment in next year's crops,'' he said.

SUBSIDIES to Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric cut profits of
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) by #180m in 1994-95, the state-owned
company has revealed. The subsidy related to backdated price concessions
in the #14bn fuel contract signed between the nuclear power companies
and BNFL in the spring. Scottish Nuclear's share was #4000m.
BNFL said its pre-tax figure of #74m compared to #81m in 1993-94 does
not accurately reflect the underlying growth of its business. Underlying
profits in fact grew by 7% to #292m if exceptional factors are removed.
The accounts also reflect a further #38m for continuing funding of UK
Nirex, the organisation responsible for investigating nuclear burial
sites.
The 1993-94 results were depressed by some #191m due to delays in the
start-up of the Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield and an
exceptional provision made against loans to UK Nirex.
Reflecting BNFL's belief its profits will continue to grow, it is
increasing the dividend paid to the Government by 70% to #45m.
BNFL chairman John Guinness said: ''The conclusion of the Government's
nuclear review and waste review have provided a strong basis for BNFL to
pursue its commercial aspirations, by re-affirming support for the
company's range of products and services.
''I welcome the Government's proposal to transfer responsibility for
all of the Magnox stations to BNFL subject to a satisfactory conclusion
of the liability and provisioning issues.''
It already owns Magnox stations at Chapelcross and Calder Hall.

THIS performance by The Shamans (from Hungary) has the feel of a
classic forties weepie -- one of those black and white affairs where an
elegant, hatted woman (Bette Davis for preference) falls headlong in
love with a Mr Right who turns out to be Mr Terminally Wrong.
Eva Magyar's choreography is dramatic, yet subtle in the way it
suggests the loneliness of both parties, the avid, delighted passion of
their brief relationship, the bleak totality of their parting.
Her own dancing -- sinuous, sophisticated -- hints at the pent-up
yearning that delivers her to the equally disillusioned, needy fellow
Peter Kovaks portrays in fits of restless, stormy footwork.
Highly-accomplished, atmospheric stuff -- but what an overbearing
score, full of painful gratings and drummings which add nothing useful
to the on-stage tensions.

YOUR leading article, Archbishop's lesson, emphasises quite rightly
the importance of the present and the future (August 21).
However no reference is made to what would have happened had the
atomic bomb not been dropped in 1945 nor was this important point
mentioned in the sermon preached by the Archbishop of St Andrews and
Edinburgh at the VJ-Day remembrance service in St Giles' on August 20.
It is generally accepted that had the war continued for an unknown
period of time against a brutal and fanatical enemy, millions more lives
would have been lost, including of course very many Japanese lives.
Also more prisoners of war living under appalling conditions, some
under sentence of death, would not have survived.
Understandably there are strong and emotional views held in regard to
the use of the atomic bomb but members of the Burma Star Association in
Scotland to whom I spoke after the service at St Giles' were not at all
happy about some of the points made by the Archbishop in his sermon.
This is hardly surprising for some of them could well not be alive if
the duration of the war had been prolonged.

Premier clubs have not only bucked the recession by doubling turnover
but are set to generate even more income once they have met meeting the
costs associated with Taylor Report
THE financial state of Scottish premier division clubs is
''surprisingly healthy'' despite having total net borrowings of some
#13.75m in the financial year ending in 1994.
For the first time in the six years that Price Waterhouse has reviewed
their financial position, clubs have recorded an aggregate profit before
taxation -- albeit, of just #200,000.
However, that contrasts with an overall loss of #1.3m the previous
year -- and it is likely the trend towards reducing debts and reporting
profits will continue.
Premier clubs have not only bucked the recession by doubling turnover
in the past five years, but are set to generate even more income once
they have met the substantial costs associated with Taylor Report
strictures on improved stadium safety.
But chartered accountants Price Waterhouse warned that the clubs
cannot afford to rest on their laurels, despite the overall 9% increase
in turnover during 1993-94.
They must address the lack of quality and entertainment on the field,
otherwise supporters will stay away and become armchair fans content
with a diet of games from home and abroad broadcast by satellite TV.
Partner Mr Ian Dewar said there was a danger that people's
expectations were being raised too high, and that they would no longer
be satisfied with the fare served on cold, wet Wednesday nights in
Scotland.
He added: ''Clubs have to improve the product and not just what is
served on the field for 90 minutes. The days of standing on terraces are
dying. A new generation has moved into seats and football now needs to
be packaged and presented as a whole, starting with a build-up.''
Mr Dewar also warned that the perilous state of first division
finances ''cannot go on forever.''
Having looked at the first division for the first time, he discovered
that Airdrie was the only club to have net current assets in season
1993-94 -- thanks to selling its stadium.
The review, published today and covering season 1993-94, also reveals
that Rangers are, in every sense, in ''a league of their own''.
Rangers' extraordinary financial clout is best illustrated by
turnover, which stood at some #15.8m -- even after failing to reach the
lucrative European Champions' League.
The Ibrox club's turnover had actually fallen by #4.1m on the previous
year -- some 20% -- yet was still far above that of rivals in the
premier division, at the time 12-strong.
Celtic's turnover stood at #8.7m, while the others could be described
as also-rans with turnovers ranging from #6.6m to just #906,000.
Indeed, Rangers' share of the total turnover -- which increased from
#47.1m to #51.4m -- stood at a staggering 30.9%. Celtic, the other half
of the Old Firm, lagged way behind, clawing in just 17% of the cake.
Dundee United, ironically now relegated, were the only other side to
achieve a share of total turnover in double figures, at 12.9%. Most
teams had to make do with less than a 5% share.
In money terms, Rangers were ''head and shoulders'' above the others,
according to Mr Dewar, who added yesterday: ''The gap is again huge in
terms of turnover . . . while spending continues to be significantly
higher than anyone else.''
Price Waterhouse suspects such immense spending power could change
unless Rangers repeat the European run of 1992 as quickly as possible.
Mr Dewar, speaking just before the club's preliminary round European
Cup with Cypriots' Anorthosis Famagusta, which saw them go through with
the prospect of a possible #10m bonus to the club from the champions'
league, said: ''Everything in football derives from success on the field
and sooner rather than later that fact catches up on finances.
''Rangers would feel the pressure if too many years pass without
success in Europe -- from the fans who have great expectations, from
players who come to Ibrox to play in Europe, and from those who meet the
club's corporate hospitality rates to watch exciting matches.''
The period under review showed encouraging signs for the clubs when
the premier division was taken as a whole, according to the accountants.
It was significant that turnover is approaching double that of five
seasons ago, when it stood at #27.7m. It was also notable that the
latest increase in turnover was achieved in a year when the two largest
clubs -- Rangers and Celtic -- experienced a drop in turnover.
The figures were better than expected, according to Price Waterhouse,
with the premier division owing less to the banks despite having
invested enormous sums on stadia.
The pessimism of a few years ago, when the Taylor Report was seen as a
potential albatross around the necks of clubs, has gone.
Mr Dewar said of the doubling of turnover in five seasons: ''It is a
remarkable achievement by 'Scottish Football plc' and there are grounds
for optimism.''
Club management was improving and he credited owners for working hard
to increase revenue. However, transfer fees remain a significant element
in the financial state of the game.
For example, Dundee United's impressive turnaround from loss to profit
can be traced to Duncan Ferguson's #4m transfer to Rangers.
The transfer can also virtually account for the division's total
increase in turnover but Price Waterhouse stressed that the general
pattern in turnover was upwards and healthy.
Transfer fees -- and wages -- continue to account for more than half
the total turnover, with #25.2m paid out in the period under review, an
increase of almost #2m on the previous season.
Mr Dewar believes that wages and transfers are the ''biggest
challenge'' that clubs now face if the financial improvements are to
continue.
Despite ''enormously high'' wage bills in relation to turnover, it was
unlikely that owners would meet the challenge head on. There was a
limited number of skilful players around and they knew their worth.
It was more likely that clubs would try to bring young players through
the ranks, although transfers would continue because of the fans' demand
for big names and personalities.
Pointers in the review to the state of Scottish football include
Rangers being ranked top in terms of attendances and turnover -- yet
placed bottom of the league on a comparison of profits and losses of the
12 clubs.
In other words, Rangers -- whose losses amounted to #2,232,000 --
remain committed to spending large proportions of their massive turnover
to underline their status as the most powerful club in Scotland. Some
#5.1m went on buying players during 1993-94.
Nevertheless, the financial imbalance between the Old Firm and the
rest of the division actually diminished during the year with their
share of total turnover falling to 48%, compared with 62% the previous
year.
That drop emphasises the encouraging signs of recovery by premier
clubs from deep financial troubles of recent years.
Between 1990-94, some #47.5m was spent by the clubs on stadia, with a
further #33.7m committed for developments at the end of season 1993-94.
However, the accounts studied by Price Waterhouse suggest that many
clubs are now nearing the end of expenditure related to redevelopments.
Aberdeen, Dundee, Hibs, Raith Rovers, Rangers, and St Johnstone were
shown to have committed nothing on stadiums after 1994.
Any departure from such substantial investments will help boost
coffers in future years. New stadiums should prove money-spinners on
their own, with facilities available for use on non-match days.

IN deploring the atrocities in Bosnia we could be taking a
short-sighted view and be less humane than otherwise.
In another civil conflict, a distinguished general said war is hell,
and the more hellish it is the quicker it will be over. In implementing
that he burned the city of Atlanta and laid waste much of Georgia. His
victory led to reunification of the States although bitterness between
them was just as bad as in Bosnia.
If ever Sherman's views needed vindication, it came 50 years ago when
the atom bombs were dropped on Japan.
Possibly what Bosnia needs is more violence, not less. That way the
war may be more quickly over, and in the long run, more humane.
The worst prospect for these unfortunate people is perhaps the present
attrition protracted indefinitely. Escalation is unlikely to change the
outcome.
Either way, in the absence of interference, the weaker side will be
the one to capitulate.

Alan Campbell remembers when the byeline was more of a target than the
bottom line and investigates how football is marketing itself
ONCE upon a time, in the far off days when Scottish clubs used to
progress beyond the preliminary rounds of European competitions, it was
different. Football supporters would have a couple of pints before a
match -- well, several actually -- buy a programme which exhorted them
to buy full-strength cigarettes and draught beer, watch the game armed
with a carry-out amid a swaying, inebriated sea of humanity whose
members relieved themselves at the point at which they stood and then
retire back to the pub to reminisce about the game before lurching home
with a fish supper to abuse the family.
How simple life was in that golden age. Up to 12 hours of
entertainment and still change from a ten-bob note. Them was the days.
Until fairly recently, most of us defined football as a sport. Then we
started hearing about the ''bottom line'', and it wasn't a reference to
the ever-increasing number of defenders who were strung out in front of
the goalkeeper. Now, as any self-respecting commercial sales executive
will tell you, football is part of the ''leisure business''.
There are many who feel all this is marketing-speak for keeping the
unemployed and the low-paid at arm's length from the game, and it is
certainly true, almost for the first time, that affluence is becoming a
factor in who watches Scottish football. Whereas, historically, clubs
took almost all their income from the gate, the ratio between attendance
money and commercial income is now 50-50, with the emphasis increasingly
shifting towards corporate hospitality and sponsorship as clubs try to
keep pace with rapidly escalating overheads.
All the premier division clubs, and an increasing number of first,
second, and even third division ones are now offering sophisticated
match-day packages to local and national businesses. When you think of
corporate hospitality you think about Twickenham, Wimbledon, and Henley,
but while many of these blue-chip events have felt the chill of the
recession, the feedback from Scottish football is that this is an
untapped market for which there is a demand that is expected to grow
apace.
Having contacted a random selection of clubs and asked them to mail
out their corporate hospitality brochures, the quality of the sales
material sent back has been an eye-opener. So have some of the prices.
As the only club in Scotland which can claim to be financially among
the top in Europe, you would expect Rangers packages to be in a
different league. As Bob Reilly, the club's commercial manager, states:
''From five-star catering, beautifully presented and prepared by master
chefs, to our own range of wines and spirits, our attention to detail is
paramount. I'm sure you'll find we've set the standard for corporate
entertainment.''
Top of the range, at #27,000 plus VAT, is an eight-seat box in Argyle
House. The package includes the obligatory champagne reception, a
five-course lunch or dinner with wines and liqueurs, half-time
refreshments, and a complimentary bar at full time. It would be a brave
man or woman who drove to this event but for teetotallers, free car
parking is thrown in. All Rangers domestic league and cup matches at
Ibrox are included in the package, as well as the preliminary round of
the European Cup (as we dinosaurs still call it).
For #3520 plus VAT per person for a table seating 4-8 people, the
delights of the Thornton Suite await. Here the customer has to slum it
in an executive seat in the main stand but, in compensation, there is a
tour of the trophy room between the champagne reception and the
five-course lunch (or dinner) where you will be warmly welcomed by your
host for the day -- ''the legendary John Greig, MBE''.
The main stand club deck offers a similar package at #3750 plus VAT
(minimum booking two places) but here clients may use their club deck
suite on non-match days also. There are also cheaper packages elsewhere
in the ground at #1990 plus VAT, and #2100 plus VAT.
A noticeable feature of Rangers sales material is the use of past
players and past glories to market today's matches. Not too far away
across the city, Queen's Park are also playing the history card to
increase their income.
As you might expect, however, that is where any similarity between the
two clubs ends. Well, not quite. You also have to pay VAT when you take
up Queens Park's offer of ''A Day Out at the National Stadium''.
For #300 and the excise duty, companies are invited to look at the
fixture list and pick out the game(s) which suit(s) them best. Then,
having selected, they can look forward to:
1 -- A four-course meal before the game; 2 -- a full guided tour of
the national stadium, including the dressing rooms; 3 -- pre and
post-match drinks in the oak-panelled boardroom; 4 -- six seats in the
directors box to watch the game; 5 -- half-time tea and sandwiches; 6 --
free car parking; 7 -- a mention for the company in the match programme;
8 -- free match programmes; 9 -- a set of Queen's Park glasses in a
presentation box for each member of the party.
While it is easy to mock, for Queen's Park versus Albion Rovers (or
whoever) at #50 a head it is perhaps not a bad investment for a small
company wanting to give its clients or staff a good day out. On the
other hand . . .
Audrey Bastianelli, Dunfermline Athletic's commercial manager,
concedes that on a strictly pound for pound basis it would be better
value to eat at a restaurant on the way to the ground, pay your money at
the game, buy a programme, and purchase some of the ghastly fare which
passes as food at most grounds, than to take up many of the hospitality
packages on offer.
However, as Bastianelli points out, what you are really paying for at
first division football grounds is the opportunity to mingle with the
players and soak up the atmosphere.
Dunfermline offer a variety of match day and season hospitality and
sponsorship packages to suit most pockets. The cheapest are basically
season tickets with private facilities thrown in, while the expensive
packages offer deals somewhere in between those of Rangers and Queens
Park.
According to Bastianelli, being a successful first division club -- as
Dunfermline are -- can be just as viable a commercial proposition as
being a mediocre premier league outfit. ''The reason most clubs are now
offering corporate hospitality is that there is pressure from supporters
and businesses to provide it.''
The disproportionate importance of corporate hospitality to clubs'
income is illustrated by statistics from Pittodrie. When full,
Aberdeen's stadium seats 21,604, of whom ''only'' 850 are participating
of corporate hospitality.
Yet, Aberdeen's commercial executive, David Johnston, estimates that
35% of the club's annual income comes from this source, with 15% coming
from sponsorship and the remaining 50% from the gate.
Small wonder then that, no matter how much resented by the ordinary
supporter, the big and small clubs alike are keen to build up their
corporate clientele.
With just about every Scottish premier division club reporting record
season ticket sales, it would seem that -- almost by stealth -- the
time-honoured tradition of turning up at the gate and paying your money
is becoming a thing of the past.
Financial score
* Total wage bill for premier clubs amounts to some 45% of turnover.
Celtic's average wage to its 292 employees in 1994 stood at #15,000 --
compared with #27,000 for the 238 people at Rangers and 93 employees at
Aberdeen.
* The first division must put its financial house in order, according
to Price Waterhouse. They found that in 1994 only Airdrie was in profit
-- thanks to selling its stadium, Broomfield.
* Total net borrowings of premier division clubs in 1994 fell to
#13.8m, compared with #21.2m the previous season -- primarily due to
Celtic raising #12.2m from a public issue of shares.
* Some #47.5m has been spent on facilities and stadia developments
between 1990 and 1994, with a further #33.7m committed by the end of the
season under review.
* Premier division turnover increased by #4.3m -- 9% -- to #51.5m.

WITH mandatory drug-testing for prisons currently under consideration,
may I, as an insider, contribute to a clearer understanding of the
prison drug problem?
It would be unrealistic to expect that there would not be drug-takers
in prison when the level of drug-taking is at an all-time high. The
reasons are manifold but the prison regime must bear some of the
responsibility.
Drugs are a time-killer -- an antidote to boredom -- and if anything
characterises today's prisons it is boredom.
Prisons have a duty to provide work which benefits the prisoner to
earn a living on release, but this is given lip service only. Out of a
population of 360, only 50 men are engaged on vocational training, and
14 on full-time education, although the demand is very much higher. The
remainder are employed on, for the most part, mind-blowingly repetitive
and boring work. Indeed, full-time education has recently been curtailed
in this prison.
The workshops are geared solely to fulfilling contracts and no effort
is made to provide work which challenges the prisoner or improves his
sellable skills.
Jobs are deliberately de-skilled so as to ensure a steady work flow
when prisoners are transferred. Last year saw this prison lose over
10,000 man-days in sickness, and prisoners will happily lose remission,
wages, recreation, etc, rather than go to the worksheds.
It would be foolish to suggest that this was the only reason for
drug-taking but it is a significant contributing factor and once
prisoners have a drug problem they find it almost impossible to get help
to tackle it.
I recently conducted a survey of the Methadone programme for an Open
University assignment. The results clearly indicated that prisoners felt
a need for treatment for drug addiction yet the programme is available
to only 4% of the population here.
The medical department want to help but just don't have the resources.
Since intravenous users are given priority some prisoners have pierced
their arms, or even injected, just to get treatment.
Many who would like treatment simply do not apply since to do so
identifies them as drug-users without bringing any hope of treatment.
The way forward is clearly to put in place more drug-treatment
programmes but no doubt the punitive model will win the day and cost the
taxpayer more in custody costs while leaving the underlying problems
unaddressed.

IT seems deeply mean-spirited to knock a play with the laudable aims
of bringing together a Scottish and Bosnian actress and examining the
complex issue of the giving and receiving of aid . . . but sadly,
there's very little to commend Alan R Jones's production.
From the cliched camouflage netting which drapes the set, to the
ploddingly-paced intercutting between the two women, the play runs
through a series of well-worn observations and arguments. A script which
refused to trust the audience's intelligence, spelling out every
embarrassingly clumsy metaphor it employed, gave the struggling
performers little opportunity to evoke empathy or instil insight.
Theatre-aid for Bosnia? Send the baked beans.

ONCE upon a time there was a stunningly inventive new-wave circus
called Archaos . . . What's left of it is currently trading on our
goodwill and fond memories with a half-hour show at The Meadows.
The solitary idea that constitutes Fauve is quite a neat one. Imitate
a traditional animal act -- Archaos never, in fact, used animals -- but
used bikers instead. What materialises, however, is thoroughly
disappointing.
A couple of guys in tiger togs (think Mud and Tiger Feet) give a
reasonable impression of bored beasties, throttling their machines into
roars of showy energy and rearing them up as if aiming to pounce. But
despite glimpses of skill, the stunts are few and much repeated. Fauve
is definitely not the cat's whiskers.

THE man at the door said: ''Here's the price-list.'' For salesmanship,
not art, is what Vettriano is about. His slick over-varnished oils with
their derivative, stereotypical figures lifted straight from 1920s
posters and photographs are as flat as cardboard cut-outs -- but they
sell.
They sell because they are easy viewing, voyeuristic, slightly
salacious, rich man's soft porn. Posed profiles, all exactly the same,
and glimpses of titillating suspender seemingly go well with the Colefax
&amp; Fowler. But #9000 is a lot to pay for interior decoration.
What do these pictures say about their owners? More money than sense?
A fool and his credit card are soon parted? Nothing complimentary,
that's for sure.
Hype is a dangerous thing. Duncan Macmillan spoke for many when he
publicly punctured Vettriano's balloon. ''He's welcome to paint like
that, as long as no-one takes it seriously,'' he said. Here, here!

Theatre
IN the beginning was the electric fan. And verily it did hum. Yet Paul
Alexander made the noise of the fan become as silence, such was the
relaxed concentration and well-measured articulation of his delivery.
And lo, the audience paid attention. For Alexander looked more like a
well-loved English teacher than an actor, and his performance was
neither showy nor melodramatic. Though perhaps it was a little sincere.
Like when Jesus spoke and his eyes were unflinching and his gaze intense
and every word was uttered solemnly.
And the audience saw that it was good. But perhaps not brilliant.
Though it was more fun than going to church. And verily they clapped.
With some gusto.

IN reply to Dr Neil Maclean's letter taking issue with some of the
points raised in my article in Weekender on business-class travel, I
would like to point out that while seat pitches are obviously important
to Dr Maclean and other travellers, there are other factors to be taken
account of when considering the whole business-class product.
These include quality of service, food, check-in facilities, airport
lounges, etc. Surveys consistently agree with my findings and rate
British Airways as one of the top providers of business class.
The difficulty of getting discounts off business-class fares on BA
perhaps is the best evidence of the demand for them.
I did not imply in my column that North West still fly from Glasgow. I
discuss the demise of transatlantic departures from Glasgow, but the
fact still remains that anyone flying with this airline is still
eligible for a free limo service if they live within a 65-mile radius of
Glasgow.

largesse to bring hush when the airport's main runway was swung through

No grants were received in Cramond for double-glazing. They only went

SPECIALLY commissioned for their 10th anniversary tour, A Knot
Annulled is just about the best present Union Dance Company could have
given themselves.
American choreographer Doug Elkins has an exceptional way of kicking
hot 'n' sweaty street dance into the coolest of moves. Here he fits
snake hips, Capoiera kicks, a little camp come-on from the sidewalks of
Queens and some hard, fast and gorgeous contemporary dance against a
clever sequence of songs (everything from Luscious Jackson to Wolfgang
Amadeus himself) that say ''goodbye'' to fidelity. The company really
snap into top gear with this one, looking good, looking feisty and ready
for anything.
Unfortunately the Elkins piece makes the opening work, Arroz con
Mangos (by Isabel Bustos) look tediously anaemic in its movement
vocabulary. The attempt to bring alive the atmosphere of times past (in
Bustos' Cuba) eventually feels like a travel ad for Nostalgia Holidays

I READ with interest Gerry McSherry's letter concerning German in
Roman Catholic schools today, or rather no German or at best very
little.
I remember a lecturer at Hamilton College of Education (pre-private
school) telling us the reason for this mystery and I pass it on as I
remember it. Others may well have more accurate details.
The ''good old days'' in Lanarkshire in the 1950s. Catholic boys from
throughout Lanarkshire had one school to attend where they could sit
Highers -- Our Lady's in Motherwell. Ask any Roman Catholic male
teacher, lawyer, or doctor over 50 where they were educated prior to
their university.
The one German teacher left to take up another post. The post was
advertised but a Roman Catholic teacher of German could not be found.
Eventually, a teacher was appointed who offered French and Italian.
Pupils then studied Italian as their second language instead of German
and, when these pupils filtered through to Glasgow University the most
popular choice in this area, the Italian department burgeoned from its
very few students.
On graduation many of these Roman Catholics went back into the Roman
Catholic schools to teach and of course they offered French and Italian
instead of the ''Protestant'' German, and the Italian language gradually
replaced German over the years in Roman Catholic schools, a situation
which persists to a large extent even today.
I pass this story on ''simpliciter''.

I would like an explanation of an equally unexplained situation. Why
is Spanish, which is spoken by many more people than either French or
German, taught in only a minority of non-denominational secondary
schools in Scotland?

I READ with horror the Archbishop of St Andrews' criticism of Allied
actions in the war years (August 21). Has he forgotten who started the
whole horrible business? Has he forgotten the misery that civilians of
London, Plymouth, Coventry, and Clydebank went through long before any
bomb was dropped on Dresden?
The use of the atom bomb (a ghastly weapon which would have been used
by our enemies if we had not used it) was a last stroke after six years
of ghastly war in which Germans and Japanese did disgraceful things, and
it did bring the war to an end.
Those people who lost six years of their young lives helping to bring
about a victory are astonished that such stupid remarks can be made by a
high member of the Church.

AS Bill Speirs of the Scottish TUC reminded us (August 11), special
pleading on behalf of one side or another is a prominent feature of
comment on the wars in former Yugoslavia. It's a pity that few people
seem to be heeding his advice.
The article by Mladen Grbin (August 16) contains a completely
uncritical reference to ''continually repeated assurances to the
Croatian Serbs by the Croatian Government''. Whatever assurances may
have been given, they appear to have had no effect on the Croatian air
force which dropped bombs on refugees from Krajina, the Croatian police
who shot Serb refugees, or the Croatian soldiers who celebrated victory
with Nazi salutes.
This economy with the truth is surpassed by two correspondents (August
19) who have taken astonishing liberties with the facts. Neil Craig
claims that ''the Serbs are easily the largest ethnic group in Bosnia''.
It is true that Serbs were once the largest group in Bosnia and
Herzegovina but they no longer are. The 1981 and 1991 census results
show many more Muslims than Serbs.
Ahsan Mustafa states that ''no Muslim country has ever treated
Christians in Asia and Africa as the Christians have treated Muslims''.
If this were true, there would still be large numbers of Armenians and
Greeks in Turkey.
It has to be remembered that Muslims, Serbs, and Croats have all been
victims, and have all been perpetrators of war crimes. Muslims have
clearly suffered the most but attempts to portray any side as completely
blameless are part of the problem not part of the solution.

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council plans to leave its inhabitants with an
expensive legacy -- the Strathclyde Tram. If it goes ahead, the first
line of this project will link Maryhill in the north-west of Glasgow,
with Easterhouse in the east. It will run on streets in the city centre
and in Easterhouse, and on disused railway trackbeds, or alongside
existing lines, for most of the rest of its 24km route.
It promises high-quality, high-speed, comfortable, accessible public
transport, which will reduce congestion and parking problems. But will
it deliver these? Will it get cars off our crowded roads? And will it be
value for public money?
I recently visited Manchester, and took the opportunity to sample
Metrolink the first of the new generation of supertrams to run on
British streets. A second is running in Sheffield, and more systems are
planned.
Metrolink is indeed superb. It is comfortable, quiet, accessible, and
has been successful in getting commuters out of their cars on the route
from affluent Altrincham into the city centre. But the minimum fare is
70p, a price for which you can travel a long way by bus, though only a
few stops by tram. Premium-quality public transport carries premium
costs. Does the Manchester experience have any lessons for Glasgow?
I believe it does, and the principal one is that the proposed
Maryhill-Easterhouse route of the Strathclyde Tram is an expensive white
elephant. Why?
First, and most important, all the communities served by it, with the
sole exception of Kirklee/Botanic Gardens, are relatively poor, and some
are very poor indeed. So the tram will not get commuters out of their
cars, because most of those it will serve don't have cars, and many
don't have jobs to go to either.
Secondly, the corridors to be served by the tram are already well
served by frequent bus services, virtually all of which run commercially
(ie, without subsidy). If the tram fares are competitive -- which will
inevitably require considerable revenue subsidy, paid for by council-tax
payers -- then the principal consequence will be to take passengers from
buses.
Result? Less revenue for bus operators. Likely consequence? Less
investment in new buses, which has already suffered as a result of the
''bus wars'', caused by the Government's deregulation and privatisation
policies. There will also probably be cuts in frequencies on
unprofitable bus routes, which include many services serving areas of
high car ownership.
So will the Strathclyde Tram, like its Manchester cousin, reduce car
commuting? Regrettably the answer is on the contrary, it will probably
increase it.
Thirdly, many of the communities to be served by the tram already have
heavily-subsidised rail services. (Strathclyde has the most extensive,
and the most heavily subsidised, provincial suburban rail network in
Britain.) If the tram takes passengers off trains, it will either lead
to less frequent train services, or even higher levels of subsidy.
Dear readers, if any among you can make any sense of Strathclyde's
transport proposals, I would like to know, because I've wrestled with
them for years, and they still seem daft. The only explanation I can
arrive at is that the region simply hasn't done its homework.
Recently, in connection with the Maryhill-Easterhouse tram route, a
Strathclyde spokesman was quoted in the media as saying: ''(The route)
was chosen because it makes the best use of railway lines.'' (Scotsman,
June 14, 1994).
Astonished at this totally bizarre explanation for a #160-200m public
investment, I decided to check the records. What market research was
undertaken to justify this expensive proposal? As a Maryhill resident,
living less than half a mile from the proposed terminus, neither I nor
any of my neighbours had encountered market researchers asking
penetrating questions about our commuting habits.
I have now examined all relevant Strathclyde Transport
publicly-available documents I can lay my hands on, and nowhere is there
any evidence of market research. The region has not attempted to
establish how many commuters and other travellers may use the tram, what
premium fare they might be prepared to pay to use a premium service, or
what changes the introduction of the tram might be expected to have on
the use of other modes of transport.
The publicity material produced last autumn did not mention fares,
although there was a rather disingenuous picture of a tram ticket on the
front priced #0.00.
So, are we committed to paying for this white elephant, and are there
any more sensible ways to improve public transport in Glasgow, and other
major centres of population?
Fortunately, the answer is yes -- spend money to improve the speed and
reliability of bus services. Modern technology, combined with a bit of
paint on roads, and efficient policing of parking offenders, already
opens the possibility of much faster, more reliable, accessible, and
environmentally friendly bus services. In Edinburgh, Lothian region is
planning a ''Guided Busway'' from the airport to the city centre, which
will give a 12-minute journey time from the city boundary to the centre.
Cost? #30m.
Traffic will certainly choke our cities unless motorists can be
encouraged out of cars and on to public transport. The Strathclyde Tram
proposal, as it stands, will do nothing to improve the situation, and
may indeed worsen it.

IT wasn't just the plethora of first show hiccups and general air of
uncertainty that had me reaching for the ''work-in-progress'' stamp. The
play's central metaphor has much potential for absurd and cutting social
comment, in the vein of Balzac and the nineteenth-century satirists.
It's a piece, not lacking in humour and intelligence, but, as yet,
messy and unsure of its target, with a sense of the half-digested idea.
Some highly-effective set pieces in the company's physical staging
style, which owes much to the grotesquerie of Theatre de Complicite, are
let down by clumsy and intrusive scene changes. A clear focus and some
serious pruning might well weed out the clutter and imprecision which
leaves the production short of the mark.

MOMENTS into this production and the point is in danger of being lost
completely as far as the audience is concerned. Not because of the
acting, which is lively and engaging. Or because the ideas explored in
Fool's Paradise are hard to grasp. It's simply because the ideas are
hard to hear.
There's a totally uncaring acoustic in the hall where the Soweto
Paradise Artists are performing. And while it can't diminish the
wonderful energy of the music -- and it certainly can't dampen the
exuberance of the dancing -- it depresses any speech with boomy
distortions.
The piece, a modern morality play dealing with such issues as poverty,
violence and crime in the townships, has humour as well as noble
intentions. It really could do with a fairer hearing than it gets here.

CANVAS is the pun here for a collection of pictures of ships in sail,
with a fair wind behind them, captured in oils on canvas over two
centuries. Inspired by the Tall Ships Race, this Festival show has
proved very popular. I guess we all have a sentimental corner for
beautiful vessels.
Clark of Greenock specialised in portraits of ships, like the John R
Worcester 1869. His beautiful Sunset by the Cloch Lighthouse, the Clyde,
was the first to sell.
The Bass Rock is a recurring motif while Sam Bough's stormy Calais
Packet shows how rough the reality of Victorian Channel crossings could
be. This spectacular watercolour is keenly priced at #1250.
Other fine pictures include Cadell's Mull and Robert Allan's Wind &amp;
Sea. From stevedores at Leith to the Fleet at Scapa Flow, from yachts to
clippers and paddle steamers, even felucca's on the Nile, all ocean life
is here.

FINANCING a separate Scottish Parliament, whatever its precise
constitutional relationship with Westminster, ought not to be an
insuperable problem. An age of computers and the main tax mechanisms,
PAYE and VAT, ensure that the prevailing system will require little
modification, any more than lump sum transfers from the UK Treasury to
the Scottish Office; though Petroleum Revenue Tax may give scope for
disagreement, it would be good humoured. The real difficulty which could
be beginning to worry some politicians, mainly Labour, is the pledge to
allow a Scottish Parliament a degree of independent fiscal authority to
impose a (smallish) additional tax for purely Scottish purposes. The
idea may worry Labour, more than those opponents who otherwise support
the devolutionary moves, because Labour is most likely to have the task
of implementing any additional tax and because the party still feels
vulnerable on the issue of income tax.
There is the obvious possibility that the proposal could exist in a
kind of grandeur which was honoured in the breach. That is to say the
power could exist, but not be exercised. Yet that misses the advantage
extra income would give a separate Parliament as well as the opportunity
to make its own particular impact on all our lives. The best solution
would be that Labour should stick to its guns, provide for the tax, and
declare a willingness to use the ability it confers should it judge it
necessary. That said there are all sorts of the problems. Who should pay
is not absolutely obvious. The status of people employed in Scotland but
domiciled in England or Ulster is unclear. Even Scottish MPs who are at
present payed in Westminster would escape: though all who support
devolution would probably pay voluntarily, less exalted individuals
might seek addresses of convenience beyond Hadrian's Wall to avoid an
impost which could be as much as 7% extra for a top taxpayer. It is a
great issue for Tories, and they will play it, though we are now more
heavily taxed (except on direct incomes) than at any time in our
history.
Scottish people will have to decide as they vote. If we want a
separate Parliament, and every opinion poll shows we do, although still
wanting to retain the Union, it will have to be paid for. Direct
taxation is not popular but it is acceptable where seen to be fair. It
will have to be argued for, but that is what politics is for and about.
Scottish Tories will be able to advertise their own distinction by
demonstrating their opposition to the whole notion, which only involves
individuals and so avoids the economic distortions which would affect
separate corporate arrangements. The three other parties, collectively a
large Scottish majority, should stick to their guns, and trust those for
whom they seek to speak.

THE band name reflects itinerant musicians' relish for an early start,
but the music is redolent of nothing more than late Saturday night. And
though Jim Hunter writes these songs by the lochside in Glenuig, one
piece of instrumental pastoralism aside, we could be sitting in downtown
Tulsa.
Anyone who wanted to go for Hunter's jugular would have any easy
target because when he sings of crazy days, communication breakdowns,
and the phantom reappearance of an old friend long dead, he does so with
such bluesy passion that that vein takes on telegraph-pole dimensions.
His band plays with admirable consideration for each song's dynamic,
with Pearlfisher Brian MacAlpine's liquid piano solo is the perfect
partner to Hunter's nimbly-picked guitar patterns.

FLAT and lacking fizz. That was the majority verdict among insiders
following yesterday's announcement of the short-list for the annual
Perrier Award for Fringe comedy.
Five acts have been chosen to contest the Perrier's #3000 first prize,
which will be announced at midnight on Saturday. The full listing is:
Australia's rubbery-limbed Umbilical Brothers; Scott Capurro, the acid
imp from San Francisco who was last year's Perrier choice as top
newcomer; Liverpudlian Japan-enthusiast Simon Bligh; Boothby Graffoe, (a
Lincolnshire town?), and Fringe veteran Jenny Eclair. In addition, two
as-yet-unnamed Fringe newcomers will be honoured.
My verdict on the short-list? It's an overly safe one, though the
chosen fivesome have a fair bit of sparkle about them. Seek them all
out; you will not be disappointed.
* A PERRIER nominee in 1992, Bruce Morton has practical words for
yesterday's lucky quintet: ''Enjoy it. Your fees will go up.''
His Mortfulness then looked forward to his forthcoming show at the
Traverse.
It doesn't have a name. ''No name; no themes. Back to basics . . .
it's just me spouting a bunch of irregular tosh.''
For the record, Bruce's entry in the Fringe brochure reads: ''For
every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When helicopter
blades rotate anti-clockwise, the fuselage will rotate clockwise. This
tendency is called torque. Got it? You have control.''
Pilot yourself Mort-wards at the Traverse from Monday.
* HAS Martin Scorsese been in Edinburgh trawling the Fringe this year
for new faces to star in a re-make of his pugilistic epic Raging Bull?
You'd think so to judge by the number of rammies involving stand-up
comedians.
A full listing of all the combatants is impossible, as at least one of
them has secured a post-Edinburgh booking for an appearance in court
following a full and frank exchange of views with a police officer
(allegedly).
Suffice to say that there have been a couple of instances of full-fist
comic-on-comic action.
Yet the oddest altercation between comedians was the one which
thankfully didn't result in blows being traded. Stand-ups Mike Hayley
and Alan Francis are the two-man cast of their own drama, Jeffrey Dahmer
Is Unwell. One night Francis's dad announced his intention to pop in,
inducing all manner of nervous on-stage fluffs in Francis junior.
In short, the show was going badly. It got worse when a latecomer
severely disrupted the intimate atmosphere of the Gilded Balloon II's
studio theatre by arriving 10 minutes into the performance. His route to
his seat involved him disturbing an entire row of drama-lovers, and was
punctuated by bangs, thuds, and muffled curses. Then the latecomer
realised he needed a pint of lager, necessitating the disruptive
procedure being repeated twice more.
You'll have guessed the latecomer's identity, of course, and you can
see why Mike Hayley was extra miffed afterwards.
* NO Fringe comedy report is complete without mention of bare-faced
scallywag Malcolm Hardee. Troubled by heart-palpitations, Malcolm
checked himself into an Edinburgh hospital last week.
Some weeks before, it should be noted, Malcolm had appeared at
Glastonbury Festival alongside a New Age juggling troupe whose bodies
were adorned with luminous paint. Long infamous for his occasional bouts
of on-stage nudity, Malcolm had thus borrowed some paint and applied it
to his private parts.
So when the Edinburgh doctors told Malcolm that while his heart was
OK, they were most concerned about his genitals, he had a ready riposte.
''Oi, oi! I'm in showbiz!'' he cried. Every Fringer is, of course, but
some are more committed to it than others.

THE fine weather is proving too much of a good thing for some water
companies, which suspect increasingly that they will not be able to meet
their obligations. They deserve some sympathy -- the records are being
examined for up to 300 years in some districts to find parallels. And
standpipes, bans on garden hoses, and so on, are not sudden features of
our own time. Nor have leakages been invented since privatisation,
though very large sums of money were available to the privatised
companies to address them. Yet consumers are right to be angry at the
way those companies most directly affected have responded to the
challenge. The notion that they have no responsibility to compensate
users whose access to water is being restricted seems arrogant, not
least because they have been so financially prodigal elsewhere, and not
just in their outrageously inflated salary awards to their top
management. Their share ratings, very high for utilities, derive from
very generous dividend payments: they can well afford to forgo revenues
they have not actually earned. If the Regulator, who is behaving
robustly, does not have his way with them, customers will have recourse
to the courts.
But that is the short-term response. Longer term the companies have to
address the leakage problem, which is derived from relative capital
investment neglect and the fractured structures of UK geology, at least
in certain regions (it is significant that geologically uncomplicated
East Anglia has a low leakage rate: though not nearly as low as the
Netherlands, it is comparable with Flanders Water, the well-managed
Belgian company). The industry might also turn its attention to a
national water grid to move what is now recognised as a scarce as well
as immensely valuable resource, from the north and west to the south and
east. (This need not involve immense new constructions, though some will
be needed, but can often use the older canal system and make direct
transfers between rivers, as is common at the moment.)
Demands for water are growing by leaps and bounds. Fifty years ago
most houses did not have a bath, there were not millions of cars to be
cleaned, nor millions of suburban gardens with thirsty flora. This
problem will grow even in moderate summers. We shall have to educate
ourselves to be considerate consumers (and may even be forced to do so
by meters, for which the companies should pay as well as making special
provisions for poorer consumers). It is a cause which will wax all
summer and will not wane easily because the new water companies have
shown themselves to be as greedy as the electricity suppliers.

Sydney, Wednesday -- The shares of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation were savaged today as analysts downgraded recommendations on
the global media group and cut profit projections after a disappointing
annual result.
News Corp's shares plunged 4.9%, or 39 cents, to $A7.61 on heavy
volume of 11.5 million shares, representing about 16% of the Australian
market's total volume today.
In one swoop, the sell-off chopped $A86m from News Corp's market
capitalisation.
''The market was expecting a better result. They weren't that keen for
News Corp's result at all,'' said Eric Gale, director of institutional
trading at Ord Minnett Securities.
Brokers blamed virtually static fourth-quarter earnings which produced
a worse-than-expected 11% rise in annual profit to $A1340m as a reason
to sell the group's shares, which had surged 58% since January before
today's sell-off.
The selling followed a pummelling in News Corp's stock on Wall Street,
where the media group's stock slid 5.7% as US investors took a bearish
view of News Corp's fourth-quarter earnings performance.
Brokers said the swift fall in News Corp weighed heavily on
Australia's market barometer, the All-Ordinaries index, which slipped
2.7 points to finish at 2101.6.
Gale noted, however, that the market held up well considering the
depth of News's plunge.
The results, released after the market closed yesterday, were shy of
analysts' forecasts and prompted downgrades by several brokers,
including James Capel and NatWest Securities.
Salomon Brothers analyst Lanny Baker, however, said the bearishness
surrounding the stock and soft fourth-quarter performance at News Corp's
fast-growing Fox television unit should provide an opportunity to buy as
others sell.
But most analysts expected to trim projections for News Corp's 1995-96
earnings to around $A1600m.
On average, analysts had expected a $A1670m profit for 1995-96.
James Capel downgraded News Corp to a ''sell'' from a ''hold'' and
slashed his 1995-96 profit estimate to $A1600m from $A1660m.
NatWest analyst Andrew Melinek reduced his rating to a ''hold'' from
''accumulate'' and said he expected Murdoch's media machine to report a
disappointing first quarter.
Melinek said the major culprit was a lacklustre fourth-quarter
performance at Fox Broadcasting, Murdoch's fast-growing US television
business. He said operating profits at Fox were 30% lower than expected.
''We now look for first-quarter results to be disappointing as well as
at Fox Broadcasting, as new programming is not expected until late in
the quarter,'' Melinek said.
Analysts said the Fox Television Stations (FTS) division, which
fuelled growth in US television earnings over 1994-95, appeared to run
into problems with audience levels and programming costs in the final
quarter of the financial year.
''I would guess that the ratings performance in the final quarter was
pretty low,'' Lachlan Drummond, media analyst at broker CS First Boston,
said. -- Reuter.

I THOUGHT the Arches Theatre company's Mayfest adaptation of Anton
Chekov's short story The Bear was wondrously over the top . . . until I
caught Theatre on Podol's version. This is theatre-come-cabaret, a
wildly ebullient, totally involving drama, which creates a communal,
uplifting theatrical experience, with hilarious audience involvement,
and a masterly command of an array of emotions -- grief, anger, love and
romance.
The dramatisation of the story of the green merchant Smirnoff, at
first arguing with the widow Popova, challenging her to a duel, and then
wooing her, is performed in an eclectic mix of English and Russian,
occasionally interrupted by a bizarre deadpan English synopsis, and is
completely accessible throughout. Smirnoff is a sexy brute, Popova a
chilly beauty, and Luka, the servant, is a comic to the nth-degree. It's
a lightweight but winning performance; you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll
be enthralled. Tell all your friends.

IT WILL all depend on Blair. Whatever the Scottish party thinks,
whatever the Shadow Scottish Secretary says, whatever the Constitutional
Convention recommends, the fate of an Edinburgh parliament is in the
hands of an ambitious Old Fettesian with other fish to fry.
This may be accounted a pity, not least since it does for any brave
hopes that the sovereignty of the people might once again be recognised
as a constitutional principle. Blair, as we know, continues to regard
Westminster as sovereign in all things, not least since he intends to
run the place.
Equally, he continues to view proportional representation with
disfavour, cannot be bothered to pursue the idea of regional government
for England, is less than keen on efforts to bring more women into
politics, and -- follow the money, as Deep Throat used to say -- would
sooner buy a used fax from Bryan Gould than be seen to tax anyone,
anywhere.
But that's the truth of it: Blair alone will decide the issue of home
rule and all of Labour's promises will count for nothing if the leader
takes it into his handsome head to renege. Given his habit of changing
his policies with his shirts, many people are growing increasingly
nervous, and rightly so.
This is good news for the other parties, of course. For the SNP an
ideal world would be one in which Labour is installed at Westminster and
busy rewriting (for which read ''betraying'') the home rule prospectus.
The Tories will revel in any confusion over tax. The Liberal Democrats,
meanwhile, will enjoy presenting themselves as keepers of the
devolutionary faith, the people who kept their word while all about were
shredding the evidence.
But would Blair really renege? The received wisdom has been that he
wouldn't dare. The ''Scottish people'', a kind of Platonic entity
distantly related to Scottish voters, wouldn't stand for it. There would
be uproar, outrage, rebellion, and all those other species of dudgeon
high and low which Scots are forever promising and never actually
performing.
Did someone say ''doomsday scenario''? Two things must be borne in
mind. First, suspicions as to Blair's real intentions remain, for the
moment, just that. Secondly, anyone who doubts he has the nerve to shrug
off Labour's commitment to real home rule is either loyal as Lassie or
living on Rockall. For the Komsomol of New Labour, devolution looks very
like the last of old Labour's sacred cows. We all know, having seen the
mince on the menu, what happens to those.
So what are the signs? First, a reluctance to spell out what, if any,
degree of entrenchment would be afforded to an Edinburgh parliament.
Secondly, a move to circumscribe its fiscal powers by means of what
George Robertson calls an ''assigned budget'' -- in other words, some
sort of block grant that would render the promised right to vary income
tax by up to 3p utterly meaningless.
Whether he has willed it or not, this suits Blair. If he thinks about
a Scottish parliament at all it is in terms of hostages to fortune. An
assigned budget controlled by a paternalist Westminster will help to
kill Conservative taunts that Labour plans a ''tartan tax'' and ensure
the parliament doesn't do anything daft, like instituting socialist
policies. It will thus have less real power than a district council.
Representation without taxation is not much of a slogan. Given the
number of people, some of them on Labour's front bench, who remind us
that Scots care more about real issues -- jobs, housing, education, and
health -- than they do about constitutional reform, it might seem ironic
that the leadership would move heaven and earth to prevent a parliament
doing anything about those issues, but that's the nature of the game.
Even now, Scottish Labour divides into two factions: those convinced
of the need for real home rule and those who hate the whole idea but
know when it is politic to shut up. Until recently the former group had
the upper hand. Now, just as the Tories experienced in the transition
from Heath to Thatcher, the tide may be turning.
You will notice that in all of this the expressed wishes of the voters
is of little consequence. Labour will soften them up by asking if a few
concessions over devolution are not a price worth paying to win the next
election. Conservatives will tell them their country is too economically
puny, too politically piddling, even to look after the bits of business
handled by the mighty morphin Scottish Office team. The SNP, meanwhile,
will continue its theological disputations over chickens and eggs,
independence first or independence second.
Do rogues still arrive in parcels? Is the momentum towards
self-government to be stilled just because Labour has chosen another
keen student of precipitation in the Himalayas as its leader? Are we
once again to be suckered into bombast, fear, and cultural cringe? Blair
wants Downing Street. Everything else is secondary. Those loyal to him
suggest this is because of the wonders he will perform once he gets
there; others of us believe, with history on our side, that the
Westminster machine is merely asserting its primacy once again.
Besides, if promises are being broken before Labour even has the
chance to keep them, what are they worth? The heart of the matter
remains, irrespective of any manoeuvring on the part of the leadership.
If Scotland has a problem with Westminster, that problem cannot be
solved by Westminster alone. The advantage, and the self-interest, will
always lie with London.
Central to the Labour leadership's calculations, meanwhile, is the
belief that the Scottish vote will hold up no matter what. Central to
Scotland's humiliation is that they are probably right.
So will Blair sell us out? To paraphrase Comrade Stalin on the papacy,
how many divisions has the Constitutional Convention?

POLICE searching for the torso of murdered ex-convict Michael Doherty
yesterday admitted they were ''baffled''.
However, they vowed to keep digging until the dead man's remains were
unearthed.
''We're still searching bogland area,'' Detective Chief Inspector John
Sherry said. ''But at the moment we don't really have a clue to the
body's whereabouts, or to the clothes Mr Doherty was wearing.
''Investigations are going reasonably well but we still feel people
are too scared to come forward with information.''
A murder investigation was launched last week after human remains were
unearthed in a woodland bog close to the A761 Port Glasgow to Kilmacolm
Road.
Mr Doherty's head, legs, and arm were retrieved from the bog which was
half a mile from the victim's home in Port Glasgow.
Detectives yesterday described the case as being the most brutal
murder they had investigated.
New evidence suggests the 36-year-old was shot in the head at close
range before his body was dismembered and dumped in the muddy pit.
Detectives suspect drug barons were behind the killing, possibly
because Mr Doherty crossed them on a deal.
It is believed at least three men were involved.
Mr Doherty's body was dismembered and the parts buried in a bid to
destroy evidence, detectives said.
DNA testing and dental records revealed the identity of the victim. Mr
Doherty's family had reported he had been missing since June 9.
The search began after a person walking a dog found a human hand in
Craigmalloch Woods.
Mr Doherty had served three years in an English prison for armed
robbery.

CHARMING and perceptive, Ang Lee's first feature, Pushing Hands, is
about the clash between cultures which occurs when Alex, a Chinese
American businessman brings his elderly father, Mr Chu, to New York to
live with him, his American wife, and their small son. It is a long way
from Beijing, and Mr Chu resolutely refuses to alter his ways which
drives his daughter-in-law to distraction. Their joint predicament is
revealed in a long, wordless opening scene as they go their respective
ways. It is very funny.
Although Lee takes no sides, the actress who plays the
daughter-in-law, Deb Snyder, is hard to like which slightly unbalances
things by making one more sympathetic to Mr Chu than the bloody-minded
old man deserves. A tai chi master, he teaches at a Chinese night school
where he meets a charming widow, Mrs Chen, a cookery instructor. Their
wooing is delicately done, but Alex, seeing in Mrs Chen his salvation --
his marriage is under stress -- tries to matchmake.
Mr Chu, embarrassed by the debacle, leaves home and finds work as a
dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant.
The title refers to a tai chi exercise which allows practitioners to
keep their balance while throwing their opponent off balance, a skill Mr
Chu uses to rescue himself from life at the restaurant kitchen sink. The
film has taken four years to reach a European screen -- Edinburgh is its
European premiere -- and it is four years too long.
The Taiwanese director went on to score huge international success
with The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink Man Woman, but Pushing Hands, a
lovely film, has no need to ride on their backs.
In Loved Up (directed by Peter Cattaneo, written by Ol Parker) Ian
Hart, plays Tom, a young toy shop salesman who works by day and takes
Ecstasy by night. He refuses to accept responsibility for anything or
anyone until he meets a pretty waitress, Sarah (Lena Headey).
He introduces her to the drug scene and his bed in that order. Sarah
has a drunken mother and seizes the opportunity to leave home to live
with Tom. She revels in his endless party-round until she loses her job,
starts working for a drug pusher and discovers what a creep Tom really
is.
The risks of the drug scene are clearly enough set out, but the rave
scene looks about as boring as any scene could possibly be. A thoroughly
depressing film.
Films aimed at children are all too often what adults think they want
to see and A Little Princess, based on the Frances Hodgson Burnett book,
a sumptuously designed fairy-tale, is a case in point.
Sara, the little princess of the title, is stranded penniless at Miss
Minchin's school for young ladies in New York where her British officer
father has placed her for safety when he goes missing in action in the
First World War. Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron ''doing'' Mrs Danvers)
promptly removes Sara from her luxury bedroom, her father's money having
been seized by the British Government, and makes her skivvy for her
keep.
Alfonso Cuaron's film may well delight adults, but I would like to
have seen it with an audience of children. Liesel Mathews is a charming
Sara, the production designer, Bo Welch, has had a field day creating
the Minchin school and Patrick Doyle has written a suitably syrupy
score.
* Loved Up, run ended yesterday.
* Pushing Hands, today, 1pm, Cameo 1.
* A Little Princess, tomorrow, 11am, Filmhouse 1.

In the drawing room of a des res in Hillhead.
MRS McSTATUS: Archibald, will you come in from the garden at once and
stop hosing the plants -- there's a drought in the Costas don't you know
and we stand to make a few bob out of it if we've any water left.
Anyway, that's your brother on the telephone from Washington. He's
calling long distance.
Archie: (under breath) Aye, well it is a long distance from America
right enough. Coming dear, I'll take it on the extension . . . Bill, how
good to hear from you. Is your weather as hot as ours?
Bill: Well, it's about 90 degrees if you were walking outside which,
in this town, would be a pretty stupid thing to do. I mean, what do we
have air-conditioning for? Listen, I didn't call you to talk about the
climate. Tell me, how are things in Scotland? What's the political buzz
-- 10 years away from home and I need an update. Are you guys still in
the SPD party, or whatever it was called, the one where you helped put
in that English Lord with the lisp and the capacity to polish off the
red wine?
Archie: No, no, that particular party was wound up. We've joined the
Labour Party, actually.
Bill: You've done what? Operator, there's something wrong with this
line, I thought I was talking to my kid brother, you put me through to a
socialist.
Archie: Very droll, Bill. I'll have you know there are few socialists
in the new Labour Party. It is not a term we are encouraged to use.
Bill: ''What -- you mean this new boss Lionel Blair has ditched all
that left-wing crap, like they don't sing the Red Flag any more?
Archie: ''It's Tony, actually; Lionel is a dancer. And Jerusalem is
our favourite song these days. We sing about England's green and
pleasant land and we all wear red roses.
Bill: Jeez, and we think Newt is a bit of a screwball! Have you taken
the kids away from the Academy -- you haven't spoiled my nephews'
chances of becoming rich lawyers?
Archie: Not at all. The boys have just brought home glowing report
cards. In the new Labour Party you don't have to send your children to
some crummy local school -- Tony doesn't. And almost all the rich
lawyers, like Mrs Blair, are Labour Party members. Changed days,
Billy-boy, and when the Scottish Parliament comes we will see the Tories
off for good.
Bill: I thought it was that strange woman Dolly Ewing and her family
who wanted independence. Wasn't she in favour of prohibition or
something like that?
Archie: It was Winnie Ewing, and she was not advocating prohibition,
it was just claimed that everybody in her family was TT. Anyway, we
don't want anything to do with independence -- my God, that could be the
death of the Labour Party in England. What we are in favour of is
devolution.
Bill: Oh, yeah, I remember all the chat about that 10 years ago and 10
years before that; nearly bored the electorate to death. You'll have all
the plans worked out now, eh?
Archie: Well, not exactly worked out, but we are talking about it,
almost constantly in fact.
Bill: How many members will it have?
Archie: That's one of the things we are chatting about.
Bill: Will there be the same number of women as men?
Archie: Well . . .
Bill: What will it actually do? Will it raise taxes, pass laws, run
the NHS, declare war -- what's its job, Arch?
Archie: Nit-picking details, Bill. Why only the other day Mr Donald
Dewar, no less, was called into HQ to help them out with some of the
more difficult questions.
Bill: Big guy, speaks like and auctioneer, seen wounds better dressed
-- yeah, I remember him. But tell me this, Arch, are some of the Scots
MPs coming back from Westminster to the new Parliament?
Archie: Well, no, at least none of them has said so, as yet, though
one of our Glasgow lads is about to get his P45. In any case, we need a
full complement of Scottish members at Westminster. We have no plans to
reduce the number.
Bill: Run this by me again, Arch. Your party is going to give Scotland
a Parliament of its own, subsidised by all the Brits, including the
English, but you still have all your MPs taking part in the London show?
Is there something I missed here? Like, what do the English say about
it?
Archie: Well, the discredited Conservatives are against it, of course.
Bill: And the English Labour MPs -- they are going to vote for this
cockamamie scheme? What's in it for them? Why should they support it?
Archie: Because in the new Labour Party, brother, whatever Tony wants,
Tony gets.
Mrs McStatus: Will you come off that telephone, Archibald -- we have
leaflets to deliver for nice Mr George Galloway who got such a wonderful
write-up recently in the Baghdad Times. We've no more time for idle
chit-chat.
Archie: Bill, you will have to excuse me. There's no time for slacking
in the new Labour Party. Yes, I will give your best to Harriet. And just
think, by the time you next come to visit us, Tony could be in no 10,
Gordon in no 11, John Prescott in no 12,589, or at least as far away as
possible, and our very own Scottish Parliament could be up and spending.
Is that not worth coming home for?
Bill: Well, yeah, I'll have to look at my schedule, touch base, make
some quality time, see what the dollar is against the pound, but I sure
will see what I can do.
Archie: You'll be welcome.
Bill: As someone once said: 'It's good to talk.'

SHE'S tiny, has a waif-like slenderness and fragility, and, when she
walks on to the concert platform, has a lost look about her as though
she's unconsciously wandered into the wrong room. The elfin Portuguese
pianist Maria Joao Pires is one of those towering musicians who -- a bit
like John Lill in this country -- is fully appreciated by connoisseurs,
but who has not achieved the full international recognition she
deserves.
Pires has poetry, power, and passion at her fingertips, as she
demonstrated consistently throughout a superb Festival recital yesterday
morning. But all of these, and everything she does so stupendously well
at the keyboard, are governed by one of the most remarkable brains in
the business.
Here was a pianist who can really interpret the classics, who sees way
below the surface of music, and is unafraid to challenge preconceptions
of what it should sound like. By the interval of her concert yesterday,
folk were already talking about some of the finest Mozart playing they
had heard in years.
She took the deceptive Piano Sonata in B flat (K333), which can sound
so refined, elegant, and charming, turned it inside out, and revealed a
dark side with a melancholy drama at its core. And all of this was
achieved with a clarity of touch and articulation which must be just
about unrivalled in the business.
And in the Romantic music of her recital -- Schumann's Three Romances
and nine of Chopin's Nocturnes -- she swept away clouds of sentiment,
notably in the Chopin where exquisite sensitivity rocketed into volcanic
passion, and all without a trace of perfume or artificial sweeteners.
The little lady with the big sound has incredible maturity of insight
and fingers like steel.

NORMAN McBain had a public image of a model career in psychiatric
nursing.
He began his studies as a teenager in the early years of the Second
World War and later, breaking off only to serve in the Army in Burma.
He quickly rose through the ranks of the nursing profession and
dedicated his career to psychiatric patients.
He held posts in Scotland and England, helping to look after patients
who were at various levels of learning disability.
In 1969, aged 44, he was promoted to senior nursing officer and given
charge of Kirklands Hospital, in Bothwell, Lanarkshire.
According to McBain, the hospital had mostly ''closed'' wards he took
over.
However, his programme of reforms opened it up and allowed patients
greater freedom and expression.
The post of senior nursing officer involved McBain and his wife Ena
being given a flat at the hospital.
Witnesses at his trial said he had free and easy access to all areas
of the hospital, and because of his duties, could be in any part of the
complex at any time of the day.
When McBain retired in 1979, his career could be held up as an example
to all in the caring profession.
However, the public image hid an appalling breach of faith. For years,
McBain had satisfied his lust by forcing himself on vulnerable patients.
Yesterday, Lanarkshire Health Board, which is in charge of the old
Kirklands Hospital, publicly apologised for what had happened.
A spokesman said: ''We deeply regret the incidents and the grief it
must have caused to the patients and their families.
''However, there is now machinery in place to make sure this never
happens again.''
He was unable to go into any further explanation of how the rapes had
gone unnoticed by staff at Kirklands during the 10 years McBain picked
his victims at random.
The old hospital was demolished and a new one, looking after 232
patients, is on the site.
Mr David Parr, chief executive of the hospital's governing body,
Lanarkshire Healthcare Trust, said: ''It is obviously a matter of deep
regret that such allegations were founded.
''However, it is testimony to increased staffing, better training, and
multi-disciplinary working that a case as historical as this was
identified and appropriate action taken.''
According to Mr Parr, the rapes were uncovered during routine
counselling with residents.
He said that, once staff had been alerted, senior managers worked
closely with the procurator-fiscal in Hamilton, police, and social
workers to interview every female resident in the hospital around the
time of the incidents.
It is known that up to 60 patients in all were interviewed.
The first patient to speak about McBain's deeds spotted him at a party
when he had returned to the hospital long after his retirement.
From then on, the woman's mental state deteriorated and it was only
when she was counselled by a nurse about why she was behaving badly and
had become so upset that the truth was revealed.

A GUEST who arrived at a wartime victory ball dressed in German
uniform was unrepentant yesterday.
Mr Jim Phimister insisted that his Luftwaffe pilot's gear was quite
acceptable for the VJ anniversary event.
''It was a VJ-Day celebration ball. I could understand it if I had
come dressed like a Jap but Germany was a defeated army by then,'' said
Mr Phimister.
One veteran at the event in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, said he was deeply
offended by Mr Phimister's appearance.
''The last thing I expected to see was someone wearing a German
uniform and giving the Nazi salute,'' said the man, who did not want to
be named.
Secretary of Ellon British Legion, Mr George Rennie, also condemned Mr
Phimister's dress. He said: ''I think it was meant as a joke but he has
found that it has backfired on him in a big way.''
''The idea was that people should wear dress appropriate to the 1940s.
Some people thought it could be fancy dress and this man thought he
would cause a bit of a stir.
''It has definitely rebounded on him. A lot of people took offence at
it and complained to the organisers, saying it was in bad taste.''
He said Mr Phimister, 55, a British Legion member, would not be
disciplined because the ball was held in a public hall and organised by
an independent VJ-Day committee.
One of the ball organisers, Mrs Gillian Alchin, said some old soldiers
at the event thought Mr Phimister's prank was in poor taste.
''There were old soldiers who could not see the funny side of it. They
have the memories of what happened in the war.''
She said she did not see Mr Phimister giving the Nazi salute.
However, Mr Phimister, who also denied giving the salute, was
unrepentant yesterday.
Visitors to his country cottage near Ellon are greeted with a novelty
doorbell playing the German national anthem, Deutschland Uber Alles.
''This has been blown out of all proportion. People are making me out
to be very insensitive for wearing a German uniform. It was done with no
malice, just as a bit of harmless fun,'' he said.
Mr Phimister hired the joke uniform for the occasion from a costume
hire shop in Aberdeen ''because it was the only 1940s uniform that
fitted me''.
''I am a member of the British Legion myself and I know quite a few
Legion members there who thought it was good fun. If there were people
there who were offended by it, then they never said anything to my face.
''If somebody had come over and said, 'Jim, I think your uniform is a
wee bit offensive', I would have taken my jacket off or something.
''I am old enough to know what happened during the war. I would never
do anything to upset the Legion.''

THE general secretary of the Trades Union Congress yesterday backed
Labour leader Tony Blair in resisting pressure to set a national minimum
wage figure before the next election, raising the prospect of a
confrontation with some unions at next month's TUC congress.
Mr John Monks said he had ''no grumble'' about the decision to
postpone setting a figure until Labour is in power. However, some trade
unions are demanding that a figure be set now to give voters an idea of
where Labour stands.
Mr Monks was joined in his support for Mr Blair by the leader of the
biggest Civil Service union, who warned his trade union colleagues not
to risk Labour's chances of victory at the next election by pressing Mr
Blair to set a figure.
With the publication of the TUC congress agenda revealing, as
expected, union support for a pre-election commitment to a figure, Mr
Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services
Association, said unions should not indulge in ''sabre rattling''.
Some unions want Mr Blair to commit Labour to introducing a minimum
wage of #4.15 an hour, about half of average male earnings. However, Mr
Blair wants to set up a special employer-union commission to agree a
figure once Labour is in power.
Mr Reamsbottom said: ''I hope unions will reject any call to try and
impose on a future Labour Government an hourly minimum rate of pay for a
policy that is unlikely to be in place before the end of 1997.''
He called on trade unionists not to give ammunition to Tory Party
chairman Brian Mawhinney in the Government's campaign against Labour.
''If ever there was a time for the trade union movement to show some
discipline, that time is now.''
Mr Monks endorsed Mr Blair's pledge to establish a Low Pay Commission
to examine a minimum wage. ''I have no doubt about Tony Blair's
commitment to bring in a legal minimum wage. And I have no grumble about
his determination to decide what figure to put on the minimum wage after
the election following discussions with employers and trade unions,'' he
said.
At its conference last April, the Scottish TUC passed resolutions
backing a call for a #4.15 minimum wage, to rise eventually to
two-thirds of average male earnings. It stopped short of calling on the
Labour leadership to decide on a figure before the election.

<HEADLINE>Retired psychiatric hospital staff member is jailed for ''disgraceful'' abuse. Seven years for nursing officer who raped patients</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A RETIRED senior nursing officer, now aged 71, was jailed for seven
years yesterday for the ''disgraceful'' rape of four women patients
under his care in a psychiatric hospital.
Lord Gill told Norman McBain that but for his age, his poor health,
and the fact that he was a first offender, the sentence would have been
much longer.
The judge was told at the High Court in Edinburgh that McBain still
vehemently denies raping the women at Kirklands Psychiatric Hospital,
Bothwell, Lanarkshire, where he worked between 1969 and 1979.
The offences came to light when McBain returned to the hospital for a
Christmas party years after he retired.
Lord Gill told him: ''This is a particularly disgraceful conviction.
It involves the rape of several victims and in the case of three of
these women it involved rape upon a number of occasions.
''It also involves, in each charge of which you have been convicted,
the rape of a patient who was mentally defective. Worst of all, it
involves on your part a repeated abuse of trust.''
The sentence was welcomed by Enable, formerly the Scottish Society for
the Mentally Handicapped.
Depute director Hugh Stewart said: ''The severity has sent out a clear
message that the rape or abuse of a person with learning difficulties is
every bit as unacceptable as any other rape.''
McBain, of Hilton House, Hilton, near Banff, was convicted at the High
Court in Airdrie last month after a three-day trial.
Giving evidence at the trial, McBain described his victims, now aged
62, 59, 50, and 37 as ''sub-normal and apt to fantasise''.
However, his victims, three of whom are no longer patients at
Kirklands, told the jury that McBain had forced them to have sex at
various places in the hospital over the years.
The jury of 10 women and five men took an hour-and-a half to find
McBain guilty on all four charges of rape, all unanimously.
McBain, who had been promoted to senior nursing officer at Kirklands
in 1969, retired at the age of 54 in 1979.
The allegations of rape did not come to light until 13 years later.
One of his victims, still a patient, saw him at the CHristmas party and
suffered a breakdown.
When hospital staff tried to find out what was wrong, she accused
McBain of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.
Former patients who had been at Kirklands at the same time as McBain
were interviewed by the procurator-fiscal at Hamilton and the
convictions depended solely on their evidence.
Psychiatric reports showed that although they all had learning
disabilities each knew the difference between the truth and a lie.
Yesterday, Mr Murray Macara, solicitor-advocate, appearing for McBain,
told the judge his client still maintained the stand he had taken at the
trial -- that he had not committed any of the offences.
''He vehemently protests his innocence.''
Mr Macara said this made it difficult to present a plea in mitigation
and anything he said had to be looked at against the background of the
dreadful crimes of which McBain had been convicted.
He submitted that there were a number of fairly compelling mitigating
factors. McBain found himself in the High Court as a first offender at
the age of 71 and the offences had taken place a very long time ago.
His health was indifferent. He had suffered a heart attack five years
ago and had undergone a hip replacement operation.
His other hip was giving him trouble, not helped by his time in
Barlinnie, which he had taken to extremely badly.
Mr Macara said there were also a number of character references from
people who held McBain in high esteem and found it impossible to believe
he could have committed these offences.

MICHAEL Barrymore went on radio yesterday to confirm: ''I am gay.''
He said that revealing his homosexuality was ''the best thing I've
ever done''.
In an interview on a London radio station with gay presenter Jeremy
Joseph, he said the reaction he had met was overwhelming.
Talking on the 2am GAY (Good As You) programme on Spectrum Radio,
Barrymore said he had previously worried his career might suffer if the
news came out.
He said: ''I'll have to start again. I'm not a campaigner but perhaps
some good will come out of it. I feel calm.''
The entertainer first came out during an appearance at a gay pub in
London's East End.
''I didn't think about it,'' he said. ''I just stood up on stage and
it went from there. The reaction was so enormous they wouldn't let me
down and the warmth that came across was unbelieveable. I just went
along with it.''
After revealing he was gay, he announced the end of his marriage to
Cheryl, his manager.
He told radio listeners he had concealed his homosexuality for the
sake of his career.
He continued: ''I decided it was time I wanted to take control of my
life and think about me for five minutes.''
Barrymore's drinking binges had become legendary, with his collapses
being caught on camera in various clubs.
He had checked in to clinics to beat his problem, while at the same
time submitting himself to a punishing work routine for his TV shows, My
Kind of People and Strike It Lucky.
Speaking about the break-up of his 19-year marriage, he said he and
Cheryl loved each other from the day they met.
''We started off as best mates and we got married with the best
intentions. Everybody does and I thought, like a lot of people, that the
other feelings would go away. Nineteen years ain't bad,'' he said.
''Having said that, the situation with myself doesn't change what I
owe her. We're too entwined really.''
* Grampian Television will serve up a showbiz scoop next week.
Barrymore and his wife are planning to stage a show of strength at the
National Television Awards in London on Tuesday -- and the event will be
broadcast nationwide by the Aberdeen-based station.
Barrymore, who has been nominated as most popular entertainment
presenter, has confirmed he will attend the black-tie event at Wembley
with Cheryl.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE police have asked the Attorney-General to examine a
forthcoming BBC drama series because they fear the opening episode could
bear a prejudicial similarity to the Rosemary West murder investigation.
Backup, a new police procedural series which centres on the work of a
specialist support unit in Birmingham, is scheduled to start its run on
September 3, just a month before Mrs West is due to stand trial for
multiple murder. However, when the officers investigating the case
discovered details of the programme, they asked to see a synopsis of the
first storyline because it dealt with a serial killer of six teenage
girls.
Fred West, the Gloucester builder at the centre of police
investigations into the discovery of a number of bodies at a house in
the town's Cromwell Street murders, was found hanged in prison. on New
Year's Day. The case against his wife, Rosemary, accused of killing 10
girls, one of them her own daughter, will go ahead at Winchester in
October. Police fear the timing and the content of the new drama could
prejudice the case.
A spokesperson for the Gloucestershire force said yesterday: ''We
contacted the BBC and obtained brief details of the programme. The
information has now been passed on to the Attorney-General.''
The Attorney-General's office declined to comment yesterday on the
basis that the investigation was current. However, it is understood that
no decision has yet been taken on whether or not the programme would
come under the contempt of court rules.
A senior official at the BBC's Pebble Mill studios, where the series
was made, said the episode in question had been scrutinised by their
lawyers and it was its intention to go ahead with the full series. It
did not consider it to be prejudicial to the West trial. Indeed, the
series was written long before the case came about, she said.
''It's true that the police did express concern some weeks ago, though
I was not aware that any information had been passed to the
Attorney-General. As far as I know, there were discussions with the
police and we understood that there was not a problem with it.
''The programme does not focus on the psychology or on the particulars
of a case. Or even on the criminal. It always focuses on the police
officers' reaction to the job they are doing -- which is being sent out
to a farm where it is believed bodies have been buried.''

AS the Edinburgh Festival's music programme yesterday reached the
halfway point, the emphasis began to swing from Dvorak to Schubert, with
a survey of the latter composer's music that began last night in the
Usher Hall and which will embrace, in the next week and a half,
symphonies, song cycles, and piano sonatas.
Alas, last night, the Schubert theme was launched with an inauspicious
and shaky concert. One of the great strengths -- on paper -- of this
survey will be the linked double concerts of the three magisterial song
cycles and the great, final, three piano sonatas, to be staged on
alternated nights.
Each of the cycles will be sung by German tenor Peter Schreier with
the accompanist, Hungarian pianist, Andras Schiff. Schiff will then,
later in the same evening, perform one of the sonatas. The proceedings
opened last night with Schreier and Schiff performing the 20 songs that
comprise Die Schone Mullerin -- The Miller's Beautiful Daughter.
Alarm bells were ringing from the outset. Immediately, the Usher Hall
felt like the wrong venue (though the audience was so large there was no
other suitable hall). Its vast, cavernous maw -- never apparent when a
symphony orchestra is on stage -- seemed wholly inappropriate for this
most intimate of musical forms.
More worrying than that (you can adjust to a space) were the speeds
that Schreier and Schiff adopted for the cycle. Schiff launched in at a
hair-raising pelt. The first five songs ran continuously, hard into each
other, with Schreier alternating between a light head voice and a more
declamatory tone.
That first sequence was not so much at speed as in haste, not so much
fast as rushed. Vocal characterisation was thrown away in the dash to
get through the words. The piano, too, is crucial to the
characterisation of the song cycle. There was little of that: Schiff was
powering at such a rate of knots that the rippling music which depicts
the brook, whose imagery haunts the song cycle, was more piano
figuration than pictorialism.
In that fifth song, too, came the first signs of vocal strain, showing
in stretched intonation over the next three songs. Then, increasingly
and alarmingly through the second half of the cycle, Schreier's tone and
voice began to fray. A discernibly ragged edge began to permeate the
tenor's performance, and undermine any concentration there might have
been. The overriding question became: would his voice last till the end?
It did, just, and with enough control to generate the absolute
stillness of atmosphere required at the end. Schreier has two huge
cycles to go, with a day's rest in between each. He needs it.

MORE than two million Britons have switched on to the Internet and the
number using the global computer network will soar in the next 12
months, a survey revealed yesterday.
The study by the NOP Research Group showed that 2.35 million people
used the Internet last year and 50% more are planning to use it next
year.
More than 13,000 people in Scotland, England, and Wales were
interviewed to provide the first indication of how many people have used
the information superhighway.
The survey revealed that 5% of those interviewed used the Internet
last year, equating to a nationwide figure of 2.35 million.
A third of people intending to buy a personal computer in the next
year also planned to use the Internet, the researchers claimed.
Londoners were the most switched-on with 13% of adults planning to use
the Internet in the next 12 months.
NOP spokesman Mr Robert Lawson said: ''The rise in PC ownership is not
slowing down. Plugging into the Internet is going to become the norm.
People will have access to the Internet in the same way as they have
access to teletext.
''It's going to be another 12 months before the Internet becomes a
major commercial market place but a lot of companies are already having
a serious look at it.''

THE LDA entrepreneurship programme successes come in many shapes and
sizes over a wide spectrum of activities. At one end is a firm which now
employes more than 700 people. At the other, a husband and wife team
have a small but growing telecommunications firm and a woman candidate
has developed a bespoke computer software package.
Two men who met for the first time when they joined one programme,
David Cairney and Ross McBeath, set up Fluidic, a control systems
manufacturer, now operating in a 2000 sq.ft unit within the Honeywell
complex and employing seven people.
They manufacture products for Honeywell as well as supplying a number
of other major companies. Fluidic is the authorised Scottish distributor
for Dwyer Inc., the US manufacturer of low pressure instrumentation and
also distributes level sensors for another leading manufacturer, KSR
Kuebler. With the help of LDA they will exhibit at the prestigious
Offshore Europe exhibition in Aberdeen in September.
''When you want to start up your own business, you definitely benefit
from the advice of people who have done it before,'' said David Cairney.
''That part of the support provided was invaluable. The programme itself
opened our eyes to the opportunities available even in these so-called
tighter times and convinced me that the risk was worth taking.'' Another
success story is of Digital Animations, based in Strathclyde Business
Park. Former architects Mike Antiff and Colin McNab left highly paid
jobs to start up their own business in the world of computer animation.
Two years ago they took part in the Lanarkshire programme and their firm
immediately started to flourish. It now employs 12 people.
Digital Animations produces 3-D computer generated graphics and images
for markets such as construction, engineering, property developers and
graphic designers. Its latest development is to create interactive
multimedia titles for both corporate and entertainment clients,
including the Bank of Scotland, Royal Mail, the Scottish Football
Association, British Gas and British Telecom.
For the Scottish Football Association's promotional video on the new
revamped Hampden Park, they turned architects' drawings into 3-D
computerised film of the stadium.
''The Entrepreneurship Programme helped us to refocus the business and
allowed us to understand where we should be going,'' said Mike Antliff.
''We realised that to make Digital Animations work we had to attract
bigger customers. It gave us a great deal of confidence and we knew that
we had a special product to offer.
''The fact that the programme also had outside consultants to help us
with various aspects of the business such as marketing, financial
matters and day-to-day management of the business was a real benefit for
us.''

THE corridors of a unit at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary are covered
with posters, showing couples in various stages of intimacy. It's a bit
like being surrounded by Haagen-Dazs adverts, but with two differences
-- there is no ice-cream, and the couples are all men.
The Steve Retson Project, the largest of its kind in the country,
offers health care to the city's homosexual population. It is open every
Tuesday evening and serves around 80 patients a month, not only from
Glasgow, but from outlying areas as well, some travelling from as far as
the Western Isles.
Steve Retson was the co-ordinator of the Scottish Aids Monitor (Sam)
in Glasgow, who died last year. He laid the groundwork for the service,
which was set up after consultation with the gay community and testing
the need for the project through a questionnaire.
According to consultant genito-urinary physician, Dr Richard Hillman,
the project has several aims -- to promote a community-led, healthy
life-style for gay men, boost their self-esteem and provide a range of
medical services.
However, one factor remains the driving force behind the project.
Despite the fact that there are an estimated 8500 drug injectors in
Glasgow, three-quarters of all new cases of HIV are among homosexuals.
While that augurs well for the work of the needle exchanges and the
associated health education messages, it begs the question: why are gay
men still having unsafe sex?
Dr Hillman cites the lowering profile of the Government's anti-Aids
campaign in the nineties. ''Added to this is the fact that a new
generation of teenagers, of all sexualities, is becoming sexually active
at a time when Aids is no longer such a pressing issue.
''After all, for most people sex is more enjoyable than smoking -- and
if 40 years of health warnings can't stop people smoking, how can you
expect them to change their sexual habits?''
One in 20 gay men who attend a genito-urinary clinic will be HIV-
positive while only one in 400 heterosexual men will be in the same
situation. Those who come to the project can register under any name,
and are thereafter seen under their registration number. As Hillman
observes: ''We have to guarantee total anonymity, or the project
wouldn't work.'' He estimates that the service costs around #1000 a
night to run. ''Financially, however, the project is a sound idea;
compare the cost of providing advice and free condoms with the
requirements of the NHS to provide a person with one course of Aids
treatment.''
Hillman is keen to play down the image of the project as an HIV-only
clinic.
''One of our key aims is to raise gay men's self-esteem; when anyone
doesn't value themselves very much, they're much less likely to take
care of themselves enough to practise safe sex.
''That is why we believe that the project isn't just about HIV
counselling and diagnosis but covering a much wider remit. Patients can
come for a general check-up, and we have volunteers on hand to offer
counselling on anything from relationship problems to rent arrears.''
David Wharrie, who works at Gay and Lesbian Switchboard, acts as a
sexuality counsellor at the project. He says: ''I often have to convince
people that there's nothing wrong with their sexual orientation; that
it's not sick or perverted as they've been brought up to believe. Some
of the men who come in here are much better at beating themselves up
than any queer-basher.''
Talking to the patients it is easy to get the impression that they,
like many others thrown together because of their particular health
interests, feel that their sexuality and interests are a large part of
their lives.
Andy, who is 28 and has been attending the project for seven months,
says he prefers this to going to his GP. ''I feel I did not get the
confidentiality I needed from my family doctor. For example, I had some
problems with my insurance company, which wanted to know the results of
an HIV test I had undergone. With the project I can receive such health
care completely anonymously.''
Tonight Andy is attending to have a hepatitis vaccination. Project
nurse, David Wilson, a midwife in his other professional life, offers
advice on a full range of sexually transmitted diseases, such as
Hepatitis A and B. ''Both of these conditions are overshadowed by the
profile of HIV, yet both are easier to catch, and Hepatitis B can kill a
lot more quickly than Aids.''
Another patient, Chick, is 50 (''But I don't look it, do I?'') and
this is his second visit to the project. ''I only heard about this
through word of mouth. There should be more advertising for a service
like this.''
Chick says he'll keep coming back, as he's been learning more about
his health than just the risk of HIV. Ross Wright, who is a volunteer
helper at the project adds: ''People are often unwilling to come if they
think they're going to be subjected to HIV tests; the service is about
looking after your health in general.''

Transporting Chekov to the Antipodes may seem an outrageous ploy, but,
finds William Russell, all works out well down on the ranch.
Country Life (12) directed by Michael Blakemore.
GFT from tomorrow.
Before the Rain (15) directed by Milcho Manchevski.
Cameo, Tollcross from September 28.
EVERY now and again a film comes along which totally confounds
expectations. Country Life is such a film. Chekhov's Uncle Vanya set on
an Australian sheep ranch in the years after the First World War? One
recoils at the prospect. Yet a truly great play can be translated from
one age to another, one society to another, and retain its essential
message. Shakespeare is a case in point, although for every triumphant
interpretation offering fresh insights there is one which reduces the
Bard to a director's plaything. But, when it works fustian becomes
new-minted. Sir Ian McKellen, for instance, is currently filming a
Fascist Richard III which will be miles away from Olivier's great film.
Such rethinking is not, of course, confined to Shakespeare. Many very
different dramatists have benefited from a fresh eye. Design for Living,
Coward's daring comedy about two men and one fascinating woman, Gilda,
the perennial temptress, was given fresh life by being set in its most
recent production in the present day. The period change allowed the
relationship between the two men who love Gilda, and each other, to be
played to the hilt. In the cinema there is the additional problem of how
to open out something constructed for the proscenium stage.
Michael Blakemore has used Uncle Vanya as the basis for Country Life
and solved all the problems brilliantly. His film also makes a
fascinating contrast with Louis Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street, which was
set in an abandoned Broadway theatre where a group of actors were
rehearsing the play. The translation was by David Mamet, who took an
essentially American view of Chekhov. Blakemore, who wrote the
screenplay of Country Life, has reset the action in Australia just after
the end of the First World War, an inspired decision which takes Vanya
out of the dacha and places the story of a family living on dreams whose
happiness is destroyed in a closely observed and relevant social
setting.
The decaying world of the sheep ranch with its run-down house, its
ruined English country garden, the clinging to the standards of the Old
Country by the elders, creates a perfect setting for Chekhov's story.
Hard times and an alien climate have combined to undermine the carefully
nurtured world of the family whose foundations are about to be
completely destroyed. Blakemore's witty, elegiac, and civilised film
demonstrates how to take a play out of the theatre and and turn it into
a film true to its origins.
As Alexander, the elderly mountebank critic and rentier, who has
returned from London to the family sheep farm with his young wife, he
also reveals himself a formidable actor. Alexander intends to persuade
his brother-in-law, Jack (John Hargreaves in the Vanya role) to sell up
so that he can enjoy his share of their inheritance.
Jack, a dreamer trapped in a life he detests, is enchanted by
Alexander's pretty, discontented wife, Deborah (Greta Scaachi) while she
in turn is tempted by the doctor (Sam Neill) who is loved by Alexander's
daughter Sally (Kerry Fox), whom he left behind when he went to London.
As the doctor Max Askey who comes a-philandering Neill gives one of the
best performances of his career, matched by a truly touching one from
Fox as the girl who realises at the end that she has no hope of
happiness with him. Shallow Grave is not Miss Fox's finest hour,
although it may have made her name familiar to people who will never
bother going to see this film. Greta Scaachi makes Deborah an innocent
destroyer of dreams, Googie Withers provides some ripe comedy as the
dragon cook, whose menu of boiled mutton, roast mutton and more mutton
drives the visitors berserk, while Blakemore's Alexander is a monster to
be pitied and hated.
There are films which arrive laden with prizes. What is one to do?
Agree with the juries who awarded them? Or wonder whether they lost
their collective minds? The temptation to go with the flow is all too
easily succumbed to. In the case of Before The Rain, showered with
awards last year at Venice, one is tempted to opt for the latter
explanation because it does not live up to the critical fanfare.
Directed by Milcho Manchevski it undeniably opens well, but the
brilliance is not sustained and the middle section is truly appalling.
The story, set in Macedonia, opens in a starkly beautiful landscape
beside an azure sea. Two Orthodox priests are gardening, one an old man,
the other a young boy of great beauty who, for reasons never explained,
has taken a vow of silence. They return to the monastery and the boy
finds that a young Albanian Muslim girl is hiding in his cell. She is
fleeing from a band of villagers after having killed a local farmer. The
boy is fascinated. He cannot turn her out. The villagers arrive, and
search the monastery, but do not find the girl. They leave, the abbot
finds her and the pair are cast out. The boy tells the girl that they
will go to England to stay with his uncle, who is a famous photographer,
but, as they head across country, they meet her family and the sequence
ends with her death.
The film then makes its disastrous shift to London, where we met
Katrin Cartlidge, a married woman pregnant by her husband, whose lover
is the famous photographer. Manchevski's intention appears to have been
to use London, a supposedly safe world, to show that terrorism today is
everywhere. The trouble is that the eruption of Macedonian passions into
the lives of these woefully badly-played, and equally badly-conceived,
Londoners does not work. Cartlidge has nothing to do but whine, while
the photographer is played as a macho lout.
But things do improve. In the third section he turns out to be the
story's central figure. He goes back to his village, the one from which
the man killed in the opening section came, apparently searching for his
roots. But this is juggling with time, because the events of the opening
sequence have yet to take place. The film turns out to be about loss of
objectivity, that moment when the observer becomes a participant and
loses his purity, his right to observe brilliantly examined in Under
Fire. The photographer has ceased to spectate and has come to repent.
The Venice accolades were undeserved, and fashion may well have played
a part in their being accorded. But Before the Rain is not a film to be
dismissed out of hand for all that it is glib and flashy. It has
something serious to say about how thin the veneer of civilisation
really is, how easily we lapse into anarchy.

<TEXT>
ONE of the men accused in the Scottish National Liberation Army trial
admitted that he made telephone calls about a hoax bomb left at a court
building, a jury was told yesterday.
Mr Terence Webber allegedly said he called the Samaritans and two
newspapers with hoax warnings because the man who built and planted the
device had a severe stammer and could not make the calls himself, the
High Court in Stirling was told.
Mr Webber, 30, was arrested on September 9 last year, a few hours
after a bomb scare at a court in Aberdeen.
Detective Sergeant Kenneth Park said he and another officer
interviewed Mr Webber, who said in a statement that a man called Darren
Brown had used an Epigas cylinder, two metal tubes, a wire mesh
washing-up pad, and wires to make up the device the previous night.
Mr Park said Mr Webber said in the statement that the tubes, part of
an old shower, were under the sink, and the wires were just lying about.
The device had also included a dimmer switch and nuts and bolts.
Mr Brown wore gloves while he constructed the device, Mr Webber said.
Asked what Mr Brown did with the device, Mr Park said Mr Webber had
replied: ''He put it in a box and walked down the road and put it at the
court.''
He alleged that Mr Webber had admitted in the statement that he
telephoned the Samaritans, the Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal, and the Daily
Record in Glasgow, after Mr Brown contacted him by radio.
Asked by police why Mr Brown did not make the calls himself, he had
replied: ''Have you no' heard Darren's stutter?''
Mr Park said that during the interview, Mr Webber told him he had
mentioned the Scottish National Liberation Army in his telephone calls
and that a device had been placed outside the court in Union Street,
Aberdeen.
Mr Park said that the walkie-talkies used by Mr Webber and Mr Brown
were traced to a housebreaking which had taken place a short time
before, and Mr Webber was charged with receiving stolen goods.
Mr Webber, of Farquhar Road, Aberdeen, and Mr Kevin Paton, 27, of
Charles Gardens, Inverurie, both deny conspiring together and with
others to further the aims of the SNLA and an organisation called Flame
by planting hoax bombs, issuing death threats, and sending hoax letter
bombs.
Mr Webber has lodged a defence incriminating Adam Busby of Dublin and
Darren Brown, address unknown.
Mr Park told the court that Mr Brown stuttered ''very badly''.
Sergeant Leslie Fyvie said he was one of several officers who searched
a house at Charles Gardens, Inverurie, on September 9 last year.
The householder was the mother of Mr Paton's girlfriend. Mr Paton
shared a bedroom with his girlfriend in the house.
Police found a full-face balaclava with holes for the eyes and mouth.
They also found two IRA T-shirts depicting figures holding automatic
weapons.
One had IRA in large letters on the front and the other portrayed a
woman holding a gun and had the words ''forward to freedom'' on a green
white and orange background.
Three photographs were found during the search. Two showed a figure
wearing military-style camouflage clothing and a balaclava. The third
showed a man who appeared to be Mr Webber lying on a bed.
A search of a flat in Farquhar Road, Aberdeen, where Mr Webber lived,
turned up an Epigas bottle, scouring pads, a chrome pipe, and two
walkie-talkies.
The trial continues.

Kirsty Scott gauges feelings on Shetland about the Eastern factory
ships amid calls for tighter regulation.
SOME time this morning, a massive ship registered in Cuba will slip
into the waters off Lerwick and drop anchor. It will join 43 other
vessels as the klondike fleet gathers, as it has done for years, for the
herring and mackerel season. This time, however, the klondikers face an
uncertain reception.
No-one doubts that they play a crucial role in the islands' economy --
half of the fish landed make their way on to the factory ships for
processing and distribution -- but some are asking if the price, in
terms of pollution and safety, is now too high.
Rats, rustbuckets, refuse and rowdiness, the state of many of the
factory ships and the crew conditions have become the stuff of local
legend, but the grounding of the Kaliningrad-registered Pionersk last
year was, for many Shetlanders, the final straw.
The vessel broke up on rocks near Lerwick in October, two months after
Government safety inspectors found a catalogue of defects during an
offshore inspection. The incident highlighted Government impotence over
the issue. If the inspection had been carried out in port, the Pionersk
could have been banned from leaving until the faults had been rectified,
but at sea the Marine Safety Agency inspectors have no powers of
enforcement.
Last year alone, the MSA inspected some 180 klondikers and found that
50% of them were in a ''detainable state''.
This season, some 20 inspections have been conducted on the gathering
fleet but the MSA says it is too early to examine the figures properly.
By October, there could be upwards of 80 to 100 vessels off Shetland,
most of them from Russia and Eastern Europe. ''We can't give any
indication about the standard,'' said MSA spokeswoman Ruth Evans, ''but
it's fair to say that not all of them are in good condition.''
Despite that initial, somewhat gloomy, assessment, however, some
observers on the Shetland islands say the standard of ship has improved
this year, thanks to tighter controls on licences.
''In the past, klondikers were able to come and the only thing that
regulated them was market forces,'' said a Scottish Office spokesman.
''There was nothing to stop them getting a trans-shipment licence which
allows them to take fish on board to process. They got this as a matter
of routine. There were calls from the industry that there should be a
level of regulation and now, for this klondiking season, they are being
asked to register in advance that they are coming and we are putting a
limit on the number of klondikers that are allowed to trans-ship fish.
''We will be restricting the number of boats to the amount of fish
available, but it may be that the number of boats is similar to previous
years because of the fish available.''
At the offices of the Shetland Fishermen's Association, assistant
secretary Brian Isbister thinks he has already noticed an improvement in
the state of this year's fleet.
''The fleet this year is a good bit smaller than it was last year for
a number of reasons, and the standard of the ships is better. This year
there are tighter licensing conditions and the ships now have to prove
to the Government that they have a quota of fish which can be supplied
to the boat. In previous years ships turned up on spec hoping to buy
fish.''
For Captain Keith Radley, depute director of Shetland Islands Council
Marine Operations, however, there are still worries about the state of
the fleet and the ability of the British authorities to control them.
''I think our main concern is the way in which the ships have been
maintained, or not maintained, but we also have concerns about the
standard of crewing. The Government is certainly taking some action on
it but I think we would feel that the action has not been quick
enough.''
The Scottish Office spokesman, meanwhile, said it had to look at
controls carefully and bear in mind the impact on the local economy.
''The main thing is that half of the herring and mackerel stocks are
landed on the klondikers. If the controls are too tight, we've got a
very significant part of the fishing industry affected.''
Down at the Port Control Office in Lerwick Harbour, a spokesman said
few would want to see the klondikers go. ''There will always be someone
who resents them, but they are just an accepted thing now for a lot of
people. Most of the vessels are getting to look much better. I hope they
continue to be here.''
Brian Isbister, likewise, believes the klondikers are now an integral
and accepted part of the Shetland scene.
''They have been coming here since the seventies and have been an
important part of the fishing industry.''

ALREADY regarded by the DTI as a model of its kind, Lanarkshire
Development Agency's outstanding business start-up Entrepreneurship
Programme has now passed another milestone of success. Since its start
in l991 it has helped to launch a total of 30 firms who now employ more
than 1200 people.
''Companies created through the programme are now generating a
turnover in excess of #15m,'' said Mr Andy McNab, Lanarkshire
Development Agency's development manager. ''Our aim has been to
encourage and support high-calibre people, many already in managerial
roles, who want to launch their own companies.'' The programme consists
of six month long courses for carefully selected groups of applicants
who usually attend two evenings a week plus a residential weekend. Few
if any have ever met before. Divided into small teams, they are guided
through an outline of the various skills required in running a
successful business then further guided to identifying a business
opportunity and its market potential.
''We can offer support and introductions as well as advice from
experts,'' said Andy McNab. ''Then we continue our support as they take
the first steps in setting up on their own. We have, for instance,
'incubator units' -- fully equipped office rooms we can make available
as a base where they can start trading while still setting up their own
premises. That is followed by an extensive after-care programme for at
least the first year that follows.'' The programme is based at the
Scottish Enterprise Development Park at East Kilbride. It is funded by
LDA, East Kilbride District Council and the Strathclyde European
Partnership.
''This is all about creating new high-growth indigenous business for
Lanarkshire, Scotland and the Scottish economy,'' said Andy McNab, who
came to his post from a training agency background when the Lanarkshire
Development Agency first took shape in 1991 and who has been at the helm
of the entrepreneurship programme ever since.
''We look to assist new businesses, predominantly in the fields of
manufacturing or manufacturing support. They don't have to be hi-tech,
but they should be in technology that is progressing and which will
create jobs for tomorrow.
''We are not about job creation, more about wealth creation. The
people who join our programmes can be located anywhere -- currently we
have two candidates who travel up from Dorset and others who journey
from the Manchester area. Our obvious hope is that the majority will
establish their businesses in Lanarkshire but that is not a
prerequisite.'' All candidates pay their own expenses throughout. Most
continue in their existing employed roles while they attend the evening
programmes.
''We are not talking about any kind of classroom situation,''
emphasised Andy McNab in his office at Strathclyde Business Park. ''This
is about people who as managers or technologists have already proved
they have substantial skills and who hold senior positions. We look to
see if they have a business flair and to assess what we need to do to
give them a commercial edge.'' No special qualifications have to be
possessed by any candidate -- a dedication and drive is considered more
important. The agency describe a typical candidate as most likely male
-- that described as disappointing although a growing number of women
candidates are gradually coming forward. Most are aged around 40. Almost
70% possess a degree or some other high level qualification and most are
currently holding down a senior management position.
''Most come to us feeling that they can't go any further forward in
their present position,'' said Andy McNab. ''Most also soon admit that
their biggest surprise as they continue with our programme is finding
how difficult it is to get into business. There is no easy route.
''Any number have said to me that they think they can be set up and
ready in two months time and I say I am prepared to take a bet they
won't. I haven't lost yet. It usually takes betwen four and five months.
''A few of our candidates fall by the wayside but as they are still
employed they simply return to that role. We have had others who have
gone away but who have come back later for another attempt and have
succeeded.'' The programmes are held under the guidance of expert
leaders and many of the candidates already possess a new business idea
of their own. Others come together as strangers, find that a joint
approach can suddenly develop, and together identify an opportunity with
market potential.
The scheme, the first of its kind in the UK when it began, has running
costs of about #250,000 a year. To quote Andy McNab, the results have
been ''tremendously successful. ''Candidates come to us looking for help
in assessing the potential of what they have in mind. They are people
with skills but don't know how to use them properly in a business
background.
''We can give them the information, show them the pitfalls that lie
waiting, give them aid and introductions, and we have the facilities to
assist with a launching equity up to #50,000. We can give introductions
forward from there -- a new business may need up to #120,000. Our
on-going support ensures we keep in close touch and assist in how that
new business is developing.
''Our aim is to encourage new team-managed high growth businesses in a
broader based economy. We believe we are fulfilling our task of
encouraging and supporting high-calibre people who want to launch their
own companies.''

EVERY medicine we take, whether prescribed, herbal, or bought over the
counter, has some side effects. The possible exception is homeopathic
medication where the amounts of active drug available are so small that
they are almost untraceable. Even the humble aspirin can kill. In small
doses it makes our blood less likely to clot and can prevent heart
attacks or strokes. If we take it in the long term we risk inflammation
of our stomach lining causing gastric bleeding which may be acute or so
slight that only in a few years do we begin to feel the effects of
resulting anaemia.
Is its benefit worth the risk? Doctors may advise, but it is the pill
swallower who must make this decision.
Easier is the decision to take a couple of aspirin for a headache. We
accept the slight ringing in the ears and occasional heartburn, and are
just thankful to lose the pain in our head. In this case, a single dose,
taken with food, seems to carry little risk of gastric bleeding compared
with the benefit it brings. An asthmatic who knows that aspirin makes
his wheeze worse might decide differently.
Now take sulphasalazine. This is often given in the long term for
rheumatoid arthritis and, when given in these circumstances, the
Committee on Safety of Medicines' report tells me that the
blood-cell-making ability of the bone marrow in six out of every 1000
patients may become seriously affected.
Some, or all, of the cells circulating in normal blood, whose origin
is our bone marrow, become deficient. Stop the medication quick enough
and our blood may return to normal. In some cases it does not and
patients may eventually succumb.
To me, the risk of being one of the six in every 1000 affected would
seem quite alarming. I would have to be very sure that there was a
marked improvement in my rheumatoid condition to make taking this
medication worth the risk. I could put up with a bit of pain in order to
avoid the worry of whether each unexplained bruise, or rash, or sore
throat, or fever, or malaise presaged a serious condition.
Not all patients would agree with me. Whether to take medication or
not is, in the final event, the responsibility of the patient. Do we
doctors make the risks clear to them? In these litigious days we
certainly tell patients what the side effects are. My experience is that
patients discount what we tell them. I should like all my patients to
say to me: ''Would you take it if you were me?''
Seldom heard of, but behind our knowledge of drug-caused illness, is
the Committee on Safety of Medicines. Reports from all over Britain go
to it when patients report, or doctors notice, side effects. If the
number of reports on any one medication become significant, doctors are
informed. This early-warning system has saved many people from trouble.
A recent report suggests that the newish quinolone antibiotics may be
associated with tendon damage or even rupture. As a single occurrence in
one patient, who would have believed that an antibiotic given for an
infection could cause tendonitis? Because enough quick-thinking patients
and doctors have noticed the relationship and reported it, we know to
look for it and warn patients to discontinue treatment at the first sign
of tendon inflammation.
Blind acceptance of a prescription is not sensible. We must all make a
clear decision that taking any medicine is worth the risks attached to
it. In addition, with so many new drugs sweeping on to the market, we
should stay awake to the possibility of new side effects from new
medicines and report any unusual feelings which seem to start after
beginning a course of the medicine, especially if they disappear when we
stop it.

ARE the plans of the pro-Home Rule parties for funding a Scottish
parliament in terminal disarray? You might have thought as much, had you
glanced at the front page of the Scotsman on Tuesday and, again,
yesterday.
You might have been reinforced in that view by a stridently partisan
version of events in yesterday's Scottish Daily Express and by some of
the coverage in the electronic media.
The Scotsman first had former Shadow Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar
on a crucial mission, since vehemently denied by Dewar himself, to break
Labour's ''Home Rule deadlock''. By yesterday it had ''tax question''
delaying Scots devolution proposals. The Express jumped in with ''Blair:
I hold the purse strings.''
New Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was on the trigger in a flash,
reinforcing his attacks on Labour's plans for a ''tartan tax'' with the
charge that the Opposition is now ''beating a retreat'' on its whole
devolution commitment.
By August standards this is heavy stuff. But is it even remotely
connected to the reality of the debate within the Constitutional
Convention and the parties which are contributing to its work? I suspect
it owes more to the gapingly empty news agendas which, inevitably,
accompany a sun-baked summer.
The truth is that mainstream Labour has never wavered from one central
principle in deciding how it wants to fund a Scottish parliament. Since
the last abortive exercise in the late 1970s, the party has consistently
clung to the belief that, even after a parliament is created in
Edinburgh, its main source of funding should be from pooled Exchequer
revenues, collected right across the United Kingdom, then redistributed,
in spending programmes, according to need.
The alternative model -- allowing a Scottish parliament to do all its
own taxing and raise its own revenues and, thereafter, make a
contribution towards UK functions like defence -- may have appealed to
some other convention participants and even to some in Labour's own
ranks, like the Hillhead MP George Galloway, who hanker for a ''grown-up
parliament'' freed of the need to negotiate with London for its ''bag of
swag''.
But that has never been the Labour leadership's approach. For them,
that kind of grown-up parliament, raising all its own taxes, means only
one thing. It takes the debate firmly into independence territory. It
pushes the concept down a slippery slope before the devolution Bill has
even been enacted. It is a gift to Labour's other enemy, the SNP.
Labour's consistent hostility to a devolved parliament with full
revenue-raising powers is not simply founded on fear of the argument
slipping towards the nationalists. It is also based on the party's
pragmatic awareness that, if a devolved Edinburgh parliament did raise
all its own taxes at currently prevailing rates, total revenues would
fall well short of the money which currently passes annually to the
Scottish Office in what is known as the Scottish Block.
This year that block makes up 96.3% of total expenditure within the
Secretary of State for Scotland's range of responsibilities. Labour
leaders know that taxing Scots differentially to make up the difference
between the block and taxes currently raised here would be deeply
unpopular with voters.
For George Robertson, and for Donald Dewar before him, the whole point
of devolution has been to subject the spending of that money (#13.8bn on
this year's plans) to the democratic scrutiny of an elected body here in
Scotland.
The present arrangements are quite clear. The Scottish Secretary is
largely a bystander in the annual spending round conducted between the
Treasury and the main spending departments. Territorial departments,
like Scotland, then automatically receive a pre-determined proportion of
the changes agreed in these other spending programmes.
For Scotland, that percentage -- the so-called Goschen, later the
Barnett formula -- was reduced in the 1992 spending round, in the light
of new census data, to 10.66% of spending changes in England and 10.06%
of changes in programmes covering both England and Wales.
In its 1993 defence of the union document, Scotland in The Union : A
Partnership for Good, the Government says: ''The Secretary of State for
Scotland is able to allocate the resources within his block according to
his perception of the needs and priorities of Scotland.''
The democratic case for devolution has always rested on the fact that
the his in question -- as has been the case for the past 16 years -- can
have questionable electoral legitimacy within Scotland in deciding
precisely what these perceptions should be.
So, whether you call the core funding for a Scottish parliament
assigned revenues, block grant, Scottish block or whatever, the
underlying principle remains the same -- the main resources for the
devolved Scottish parliament have to be agreed with London.
For a time Labour went along with what was, in effect, a convention
fig leaf. The main funding would consist of a sum equal to the revenues
raised from VAT and income tax within Scotland, topped up by a
negotiated grant to preserve present funding levels.
But, although assigning Scottish VAT and income-tax revenues in this
way creates the illusion of devolved tax-raising, in practice its
political impact is indistinguishable from some variant of a
formula-based or negotiated block grant. A Scottish parliament would
have no control over the rates at which these taxes are levied. A deal
would still have to be done with Westminster on what the size of the
overall settlement should be.
That deal has to be struck, whether Scotland has Home Rule or not. In
his rush to rubbish Labour's devolution plans, Mr Forsyth might care to
reflect on the implications of his own pledge, since becoming Scottish
Secretary, that he will fight to preserve Scotland's current share of
the UK spending cake.
When can we expect him to engage, in public debate, with the growing
chorus of voices on his own backbenches, calling for the Scottish Block
to be reduced to a strict per-capita allocation, taking no account of
relative need in any shape or form?
Of course, both Labour and the Constitutional Convention are committed
to one more funding power for a Scottish parliament -- the ability, once
the core funding is in, to vary the basic rate of income tax in
Scotland, up or down, by up to 3p in the pound.
That commitment is there, I suspect, because even the humblest
district council has revenue-raising powers of its own. A devolved
parliament with extensive legislative powers, shorn completely of
revenue-raising powers, would be an exceptional -- some might argue,
unaccountable -- body.
Labour, I suspect, knows only too well that its commitment to that
supplementary power to tax is a gift to a pugnacious propagandist like
the present Scottish Secretary, who has already branded it the tartan
tax. But, despite all the media hoo-ha elsewhere this week about
deadlock, there is a determination, which stretches right into Tony
Blair's inner sanctum, to see that pledge through.
The question is not whether Labour is doing a U-turn on its funding
plans for a devolved Scottish parliament. The real question is whether
the plans as proposed are likely to be politically popular and
constitutionally sustainable in the longer term.
LABOUR: George Robertson
* IN recent weeks, substantial progress has been made towards getting
an up-to-date all party agreement on secure and stable financing for a
Scottish parliament in the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
Firstly, the convention has agreed the principle of equalisation will
continue. This means resources will be pooled within the UK (from
wherever or however they are obtained) and distributed according to
needs.
Scotland will continue to receive its fair share of UK tax revenues
based on its assessed needs.
Secondly, the parliament will have the power to vary its own revenues
thus providing it with a crucial element of flexibility -- the power
which the debates in the 70s saw as vital for real devolved authority.
Michael Forsyth insults the intelligence of the Scottish people when
he tries to pass this power off as a Tartan Tax.
As he well knows, there is a world of difference between having the
power to raise or cut taxes and actually doing it. After all, the
Chancellor theoretically has the power to take every penny we earn in
tax.
Finally, once calculated, the budget for government in Scotland will
be assigned to the Scottish parliament. That means that Scotland will be
able to determine its own priorities without interference from
Westminster.
The Scottish parliament will be accountable to the Scottish people and
not to Whitehall.
There will still be hard choices to be made but it will be the people
of Scotland who will make them.
CONSERVATIVE: Michael Forsyth
* THIS week the Labour Party has agreed to finance its proposed
Scottish parliament through a Westminster block grant -- the same way
Scotland's local authorities are funded. To give its toothless tiger a
bit of bite, Labour has promised to levy a Tartan Tax of three pence on
the pound.
Thanks to Labour's grandiose plans, Scots will become the highest
taxed residents of the United Kingdom. Many arrogant socialists argue
that it is a price worth paying, but lower income earners, young
families, and the business community would take a much different view.
How many jobs would the Tartan Tax cost Scotland? Surely even George
Robertson must concede that a higher taxation level would stifle the
recent record levels of inward investment into Scotland.
George Robertson has argued that a Scottish parliament may be able to
lower taxes but this is a complete nonsense. Firstly, when has a Labour
Government ever lowered taxes? And even if Labour could make way for a
tax reduction, Mr Robertson is living in a dreamworld if he thinks
English MPs at Westminster would vote to send a generous grant north to
finance a Scottish tax cut.
Scottish Conservatives believe Scotland is best served by remaining
within the United Kingdom.
Labour's fudged proposals for devolution will hammer the Scottish
taxpayer, stifle Scotland's economic prospects and will only be a
benefit for the failed socialists who would populate a Scottish
parliament.
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT: Jim Wallace
* THREE fundamentals for the finances of the Scottish Parliament have
been agreed within the Constitutional Convention, and are approved by
the Scottish Liberal Democrats as positive steps towards our own, more
radical, proposals for a federal system.
We continue to support the principle of equalisation of government
expenditure , based on an objective assessment of needs.
The Scottish parliament will have autonomy over its expenditure and
income. It will be able to set its priorities for public expenditure,
and its income will be legislatively guaranteed on the basis of the
principle of equalisation, avoiding the problem of financing the
parliament through a block grant wholly or partially in the gift of
Westminster.
Starting with the Barnett formula the two parliaments will have to
participate in a process of agreeing how the principle of equalisation
is put into effect. Within this process both parliaments will need to
know what the Scottish parliament's budget is to be, but also how much
of it comes from the Scottish tax yield, and how much of it is
''topping-up''.
Thus, all taxes collected in Scotland will effectively be ''assigned''
to the Scottish Parliament, and a psychology of fiscal responsibility
will be created.
The Scottish parliament will have the power to vary the rate of income
tax by 3p in either direction. Without this power the parliament would
be a ''toothless tiger'', unable to improve the conditions of the
people.
SNP: Alex Salmond
* NEW Labour has taken devolution back to the 1970s.
By switching back to the Barnett formula -- although calling it an
''assigned budget'' to humour the Lib-Dems -- Labour is proposing a
puppet parliament on a Westminster string.
A block allocation directly ties the Scottish budget to changes in
comparable English programmes.
In order to change any item of Scottish expenditure, the assembly
would have to rob Peter to pay Paul: for example, cut health to spend on
education, or vice versa.
This straitjacket is in addition to the existing weakness of
devolution in having no access to oil and gas revenues, no power to end
the waste of resources on Trident, no ability to restore benefits to 16
and 17-year-olds, and no right to representation at the top table in
Europe.
Recent history shows how vulnerable Labour's assembly budget would be.
For example, in 1992 the Barnett formula was clipped -- reducing
Scotland's allocation from 11.76% to 10.66% of changes to English
spending, and cutting the Scottish Office's budget by #60m in one year.
Labour is now in the absurd position where the only power to gain
necessary funds which an assembly would have -- raising income tax -- is
one which Labour politicians insist they would never use!
Scotland more than pays her way within the United Kingdom. That is a
reality which Labour is desperate to hide, because its political future
depends on the myth of the ''subsidised Scot.''

A PICTURE of Scotland's motorists embroiled in small-town traffic jams
as by-pass plans gather dust on the shelves was painted by one of the
country's largest roads pressure groups yesterday.
Nearly two thirds of Scotland's by-pass schemes have been delayed,
some indefinitely, causing misery for residents and damaging the
economy, according to a survey by the British Road Federation.
It predicts that, at the present rate of progress, it will take more
than 35 years to finish the current tranche of by-passes. Mrs Maureen
Orde, regional secretary of the Scottish Committee of the BRF, who
compiled the report, warned that, apart from environmentally
unacceptable levels of traffic congestion, the knock-on effect for
Scotland's economy included reduced access to the Channel Tunnel and the
European market.
''The lack of progress cannot be allowed to continue and the
completion of certain planned by-passes would dramatically improve the
quality of life for many people.
''The main reason for the delays is cash, so we need more Government
will to progress the schemes.''
The report details Government and regional councils' plans for
by-passes and analyses progress over the past two years. It shows 63% of
schemes in Scotland now have later start dates than in the previous
survey. There are 41 planned by-passes in Scotland but only seven have
opened or are under construction since the 1993 report, and 26 schemes
have had to be delayed.
Seven by-passes in Strathclyde and 12 in Central region are among
those which have slipped behind projected completion dates.
In Strathclyde, those include the A71 Newmilns by-pass, programmed for
1996 and rescheduled to 1998-1999; the A814 Yoker by-pass, moved from
this year to 1998/99; the A814 Bishopbriggs by-pass, moved from 1995/96
to 1997/98 and the Eaglesham by-pass outside Glasgow, originally due to
start this year, which has not yet been programmed.
Councillor Charles Gordon, convener of Strathclyde Regional Council's
roads and transportation committee, said lack of money was the key
element in most, but not all, of the projects. On the Eaglesham by-pass,
he said opposition from one local authority had damaged the project and
alternative schemes were being proposed.
''Generally, the money we are allowed to borrow for capital projects
has declined in real terms by about 50% since the late 70s and early 80s
-- which were the the heroic years in terms of capital projects.
''It has been a case of needs must in some locations and we have come
up with intermediate traffic management solutions. There is also a
factor in small towns where traders find they get a loss of business and
are therefore a bit ambivelent towards by-passes.''
In Central region, the delays in by-pass building had been prompted by
a redirection of policy which had meant the budget for road building
being slashed dramatically from 80% to 32%, said the region's
transportation manager, Mr Larry Henderson.
''The basis of the new strategy is that we are seeking to spend less
money on building roads and more on the provision of public transport
whether it be by bus, rail, bicycle, or foot.
''The decision was taken in recognition of the fact that we were not
going to keep up with demand. Some of the by-passes listed are a victim
of that policy.''
The consequences of a delay in by-pass building were spelled out by
housewife Mrs Lesley Fleck, 28, of Montgomery Street, Eaglesham.
''They're are going to have to do something about the traffic,'' she
said yesterday. ''It's been about 20 years since this all started. My
baby keeps wakening up because of the vibrations from the lorries at
night.
''I can't get her to sleep during the day because of the noise and my
husband is the same. He is a baker and has to sleep in the afternoon but
he can't. It makes me really angry.
''Chloe is our first baby and all we can think about now is that we
have to move because if she goes out to play she could get run over by
one of these huge lorries. There's also the pollution. I don't like to
leave the baby out in the garden because of the exhaust fumes that come
off the lorries. I can't leave our windows open either because the
exhaust comes in, especially in the hot weather.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''Ministers' priorities have
always been the upgrading of the A74, the central Scotland motorway
network, and the A1. Ministers continue to examine the roads' programme
regularly and allocate resources, which are inevitably constrained,
where they will do most good both for the needs of business and the
community at large.
''Several by-passes on the A96 and the Dalkeith by-pass on the A68 are
in the long-term programme and will be brought forward as soon as
resources will allow.''

A MONEY advice centre, which claims to have brought at least #1m into
a deprived Glasgow estate, has been given a financial lifeline following
the threat of closure.
The seven-year Urban Programme funding for Castlemilk Money Advice
Centre expired earlier this month. A bid has been submitted to the
National Lotteries Board for continued funding over the next three
years.
However, the centre does not have the resources to remain open until
that application is considered after October 23, so other organisations
have come to its rescue by offering donations to keep it open
temporarily.
Glasgow District Council has provided #12,000 and the Halifax Building
Society has offered #1000.
Mrs Julia Slater, chairman of the management board, said it was vital
that the service was retained. Closure would mean the loss of five
full-time jobs and the increased use of loan sharks by local people, she
feared.
She said: ''The centre deals with hundreds of inquiries each year
involving debts from hundreds to thousands of pounds. The centre's money
advisers negotiate with creditors affordable repayment programmes and
ensure that their client's income is fully maximised via the uptake of
welfare benefits entitlement.
''Castlemilk Advice Centre also represents its clients at small claims
courts and appeal tribunals. Last year alone, the centre brought more
than #1m back into the pockets of the community.
''There is no other local agency at present which has specialist money
advisers to cope with the demand. Without the centre, we fear that
people will turn to high-interest loan companies and loan sharks as
poverty remains on the increase and people find it more and more
difficult to survive without incurring debt.''
A spokesman for Glasgow District Council said the authority had paid a
portion of the annual #130,000 costs, with the bulk coming from central
government coffers.
He added: ''Unfortunately the project's seven years have run out and,
due to constraints on spending, we are not able to meet the costs of
continuation.''

Peshawar
AN Islamic court in Pakistan today sentenced two Irishmen to flogging
and 10 months' imprisonment with hard labour for trying to smuggle 1.5
tonnes of hashish to Western Europe.
The court also ordered Brian O'Loughlin and Oliver Byrne to each pay a
fine of 20,000 rupees (#415). They were granted six-month remission on
their jail sentences, equivalent to the time they had already spent in
custody.
Magistrate Yar Said Khan ordered each man to receive five lashes as
prescribed by the Islamic law under which they were tried.
They pleaded guilty at the start of the hearing after being brought to
the court handcuffed and shackled.
The Irishmen, still to be tried in a criminal court for the same
offence, could appeal against the sentence but not the conviction, legal
sources said.
O'Loughlin and Byrne were arrested on February 13 for trying to
smuggle 1.5 tonnes of hashish out of Pakistan's tribal area behind false
panels of a caravan in which they were travelling.

A MAN flew into a rage in court yesterday when he was found guilty of
shooting and murdering his lover.
As the foreman of the jury announced the verdict at the High Court in
Glasgow, John Hemphill, 30, began struggling with his police escort in
the dock.
They tried to calm him as he shouted: ''I never done it. I never done
it. I never done anything.''
It was only when Hemphill had been hustled from the courtroom that the
jury foreman was able to say that the guilty verdict was by a majority.
The judge Lord Cowie then told the court that he would delay
sentencing Hemphill until this morning.
During the uproar, Hemphill's brother Christopher, 24, who had claimed
the accused was with him at the time of the murder, ran from the court
in tears.
At the end of a six-day trial, the jury found Hemphill guilty of
shooting and murdering Sally Cannon, 20, at their home in Kelburn
Terrace, Port Glasgow.
The Crown withdrew other charges which had alleged that Hemphill had
been concerned in the supply of heroin and cannabis resin.
During the trial, the court heard that Ms Cannon had gone to live in
the flat two years ago and Hemphill moved in with her. She began taking
drugs, including heroin.
One witness, Ms Anne Marie Williams, 26, said Ms Cannon had told her
she hated Hemphill, wanted to get away, but felt trapped.
Mrs Fiona Reith, prosecuting, told the jury that it was Ms Cannon's
decision to finish with Hemphill, which was the probable motive for the
murder.
One neighbour said he heard the sounds of arguing from the flat, he
saw Hemphill leave, return and then the shout: ''You are f...... getting
it, you bitch'' followed by a high pitched female scream.
Later, Ms Cannon was found on the first landing. She was later found
to have a bullet lodged under her tongue and two more on the right side
of her head behind her ear.

In her first major interview since the death of her husband John,
Elizabeth Smith talks to Ruth Wishart about life as a champion of the
arts.
THE Baroness kicks off the shoes with no little relief and takes to
the sofa, while her companion clambers into the welcome embrace of a
decently squidgy armchair. When you are, respectively, the chair and the
director of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, putting the feet up at half
time is not so much self-indulgence as physical necessity.
They've taken time out to look at the fruits of a relationship which
began last February when the Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill -- more
usually known in the trade as Elizabeth -- was persuaded to take over
the Fringe chair from Jonathan Miller.
And that persuasion process, Hilary Strong reminds me, took some six
months before the new incumbent was successfully wooed into the Fringe
fold.
For Elizabeth, besieged with invitations from assorted boardrooms,
charities and public bodies since the death of John Smith in May of last
year, the proposition was both attractive and mildly terrifyng.
''The thing was, I was unsure what it would entail. Unsure of whether
or not I could handle board meetings, and certainly nervous about the
public aspects of the job.
''On the other hand I was coming to the conclusion that whatever I
decided to do with the rest of my life it was logical to root much of it
in the arts where I already had a serious interest.''
In the event, her first board meeting, peopled by user-friendly
characters like Simon Fanshawe, Christopher Richardson from the
Pleasance Venue, and Eddie Jackson from Borderline Theatre, became more
of a party than an ordeal; Hilary's analysis of which is that the board
takes its job seriously enough -- the Fringe is very big business -- but
unlike boardroom equivalents in the corporate world, doesn't think that
getting through an agenda and having fun need be mutually exclusive.
Now, with her second board meeting coming 24 hours before the annual
meeting, Elizabeth has rather a clearer idea just what she's taken on.
''I've never been the kind of person who goes into anything trying to
make immediate changes or dominating meetings. I very much need to take
my time, to learn as much as possible about what's involved, and to get
a feel for how the job might be done well. And already I can see that
I'll have to have a very different attitude next year. I hadn't really a
clue about the sheer volume there would be to get involved with, and
it's clear to me now that you shouldn't be chairman of the Fringe and
expect to do anything with the rest of your life for August. Next time
I'll be more disciplined about clearing the diary.''
And the trade-off the two women have agreed is that while Elizabeth is
more comfortable with Hilary doing much of the front-of-house stuff for
the media, she's happy to function as a combination of agony aunt and
intermediary when there are staff problems, or the organisation falls
into the odd elephant trap.
The fact that they quickly became friends as well as colleagues has
been a bonus, not least for Elizabeth who is having to reinvent herself
in all kinds of ways.
''I suppose what I've been trying to do is find a new role for myself,
one which makes use of the skills I already had. Before John died I
obviously had all kinds of commitments involving his work. I would try
to split up the month into Edinburgh weeks and London weeks so that I
could be available when he needed me to attend various functions. Now I
find myself in charge of my own life and, to be honest, that's sometimes
a pretty scary thought. But I feel now that if I can think positively
about the things I'm doing then I can gain confidence and start to look
on this period as an opportunity.''
Happily for the new Fringe chair, her family are already paid-up
Festival groupies; eldest daughter Sarah has been in town on holiday all
week, and Catherine, the youngest, is still sufficiently in love with
the idea of having passed her driving test to be doubling as family
chauffeuse.
Later in the year the Festival experience will inform some of what
Elizabeth hopes to say in a maiden speech about the arts in Scotland.
And later in the year too she and Hilary hope to expand the Fringe's
off-season endeavours. Hilary says what she saw as the plusses someone
like Elizabeth could bring to the Fringe were her political and social
contacts and the fact that, unlike Jonathan, who tended to parachute in
and out, she is still resident in Edinburgh and ready and willing to
promote Fringe interests on a year-round basis.
The Fringe director, who's evangelical about giving the smaller
companies visiting the Fringe as much advance back-up as is feasible, is
keen that Elizabeth uses her extensive experience in the former Soviet
Union to encourage more participants from that area. And Elizabeth, who
spends part of her life as a consultant to organisations involved in
joint ventures in that neck of the Eastern European woods, is equally
enthusiastic that Russian theatre skills in particular are given a wider
and higher profile in Scotland. Keen too that new faces and new blood
help enrich and enliven a cultural organisation which, like others in
the same field, often has had to rely on a small, committed, but
inevitably somewhat incestuous cast list of enthusiasts.
Of all the jobs Elizabeth Smith has taken on -- she's now on the board
of Scottish Television and sits on the Press Complaints Commission --
the Fringe chair has the potential to be the most fulfilling.
It presses so many of the right buttons for a woman who has lived most
of her life in the shadow of a successful husband. It's based in her
adopted home town, yet invested with national and international
importance; intellectually stimulating, yet sheer good fun.
There is too, both Elizabeth and Hilary cheerfully admit, a game to be
played.
A game where you need to be streetwise enough to work a room, shake
down a sponsor, sweet talk your way into useful situations, and bluff
your way out of trouble. And you don't spend half your life with the
likes of John Smith without learning a few tricks of these trades.

Jerusalem
IN A severe blow against the Muslim militant group Hamas, Israeli
agents today arrested the mastermind of the two latest suicide bombings
and 29 of his accomplices.
Security forces also raided a bomb-making factory in the West Bank
town of Nablus today and found assembled fertiliser bombs and
bomb-making equipment.
Disguises apparently intended for future suicide bombers, including
wigs and skullcaps worn by observant Jews, were also found in the raid.
Agents also seized a car rigged with explosives ready for use in a
suicide attack.
The discovery of the laboratory and the arrests of activists involved
in planning attacks was a breakthrough for the Israelis.
In the past, sweeps have picked up political activists and those
loosely connected with Hamas's military wing, but not the bomb-makers or
their facilities.
The announcement of the arrests was made by the head of the Shin Bet
security service, who told a news conference that the captured Hamas
militants ''represented the infrastructure of the military wing of Hamas
in the West Bank''.
The Shin Bet chief identified the mastermind of the two bombings in
Ramat Gan on July 24 and in Jerusalem on Monday as 27-year-old Abdel
Nasr Issa, a university student from the Balata refugee camp in the West
Bank.
Nasr was trained in the Gaza Strip by Yehiya Ayyash, known as ''The
Engineer''. He heads Israel's most wanted list and is suspected of
masterminding at least six suicide bombings that have killed 76 people
since April last year.
Ayyash remains at large, and Palestinian officials said today that PLO
chief Yasser Arafat had ordered a manhunt for him in the Gaza Strip.
Issa was arrested Saturday, two days before the bombing in Jerusalem,
but investigators from the Shin Bet secret service were given permission
to use tough interrogation measures only after the blast.

THE mother of black teenager Stephen Lawrence broke down in tears
yesterday as she arrived at the court hearing the family's private
prosecution accusing four men of the race killing of her son.
Mrs Doreen Lawrence arrived at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court, south-east
London, with husband Neville to be greeted by supporters.
The case follows an 18-month campaign following the stabbing of
18-year-old Stephen in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.
In July that year, the Crown abandoned the case against four people
after it said there was insufficient evidence to secure a conviction.
Reporting restrictions were not lifted as the case opened against Mr
Luke Knight, 18, Mr Neil Acourt, 19, his brother Jamie, 18, and Mr David
Norris, 18.

THE Scottish National Party appears to be the main winner from changes
to the boundaries of Scotland's eight European Parliament constituencies
proposed yesterday by the Boundary Commission.
Labour-held Mid-Scotland and Fife is to lose its safe areas of Falkirk
East and Falkirk West, replaced by Nationalist stronghold North Tayside.
If the voting patterns in the last General Election are repeated at
the next European election, Labour Euro MP Alex Falconer could be pipped
by an SNP challenger.
Such a claim has to be qualified, of course, as the next Euro
elections are not until 1999, and voting patterns could vary.
Nevertheless, SNP chief executive Mike Russell said the recommendations
gave the party confidence of further success in the Euro elections.
''The SNP needs a swing of only 7.5% to win Mid-Scotland and Fife, and
the inclusion of North Tayside would certainly alter the picture in our
favour,'' he said.
Scotland's eight European seats are made up of a combination of
Westminster parliamentary seats, to reflect as much as possible the same
number of voters in each area. The Boundary Commission, because of a
population growth in the north, wants to reduce the size of the SNP-held
North-East Scotland seat by moving North Tayside down into the next Euro
constituency -- Mid-Scotland and Fife.
Glasgow, with its falling population, has the Rutherglen seat inserted
from Strathclyde East. To balance these changes, the commission proposes
moving the two Falkirk seats into Strathclyde East.
Finally, Strathclyde East, because of its new geographical
configuration, will be called Central Scotland, and Strathclyde West
would become West of Scotland, thus removing the final use of
Strathclyde from any form of government.
The proposals can be objected to and there may be a challenge to the
Falkirk shift, especially as moving two seats into Strathclyde East, and
only taking one out, will make it the most densely populated seat with
552,230 voters. The national average is less than 500,000.
However, the Highlands and Islands seat, because of its geographical
spread, will always be below the national average, and the commission is
not allowed to split parliamentary seats -- so it will always be
difficult to match remaining seats exactly to a fair division of the
electorate.
Objections from either a local authority or a body of 500 or more
electors have to be submitted to the commission in Edinburgh by
September 25.

Hastings,
DETECTIVES from the Rachel Nickell murder team were today checking the
alibi and other information given by a man interviewed in New Zealand.
The 31-year-old man, a former barman, spent two-and-a-half hours
talking to Scotland Yard detectives who flew 12,000 miles to see him.
The officers who went to New Zealand, Detective Chief Inspector Allan
Jude and Detective Constable Russ Norval, are expected to interview the
man's girlfriend tomorrow.
The two detectives will remain in New Zealand while inquiries are made
in London, said a spokeswoman at Scotland Yard.
Miss Nickell was murdered in July 1992. She was stabbed 50 times while
walking with her young son on the common at Wimbledon, London.
The man and his girlfriend have issued a joint statement through their
lawyers stressing their willingness to help the police inquiry.
Mr Steve Manning, the lawyer acting for the man, said his client was
''upset by the allegation'' but was prepared to co-operate with police.
Mr Manning, who was present during the interview, refused to discuss
details of the ground covered.
The man, who arrived in New Zealand in 1993 and has been living with
his girlfriend in the North Island town of Hastings, has acknowledged
that he was in the area on the day Miss Nickell, 23, was killed.
He told one newspaper: ''I didn't do it -- I'm not their man.''
He said he remembered the day of the killing as he was going for a
game of golf with friends, adding: ''The police had set up roadblocks
and we got caught in the jams around the common.''
The man lived on the Roehampton estate, near Wimbledon Common.
Mr Colin Stagg, who also lives on the Roehampton estate, was cleared
of Rachel's murder.
The detectives flew to the Hastings on New Zealand's North Island
earlier this week after a new witness reported spotting a man with a
blood-soaked shirt on the day of Miss Nickell's death.
Carole Wood, 29, said she had been out at a launderette and had
returned to her home on the Roehampton Estate.
''When I got home there was a lot of shouting and kicking and
swearing. I said 'Who is it?' I looked through the letter box. All I
could see was a man in a white shirt with stripes, dark trousers, and
shoes. The blood was all over his stomach,'' she said.
''When Wimbledon police came to visit me in Holloway they asked me
what type of blood. I said. . . it was fresh blood on his clothes.''
Ms Wood was recently released from Holloway Prison where she served a
sentence for credit card fraud. She recognised the man as her neighbour,
who later moved to New Zealand. ''I'm positive it was him,'' she added.

Rome
ANTI-MAFIA agents plucked turncoat Tommaso Buscetta from a cruise ship
in the Mediterranean today after alarmed passengers complained about
sharing their holidays with a man the Mob have sworn to kill.
A spokesman for the cruise company said the agents collected him and
his family from the vessel before dawn. They whisked him away by
helicopter to a secret location after a journalist on the liner had
blown his cover.
Politicians expressed outrage that the country's Anti-Mafia
Investigative Division, the DIA, allowed Buscetta to board the
600-passenger liner Monterey on August 14 for a holiday with his wife
and two sons.
Tiziana Parenti, president of the Italian parliament's anti-Mafia
Commission, said: ''This is disconcerting. It put the lives of other
passengers at risk.''
Buscetta, 67, had been travelling under a false name, dining with
other passengers, and enjoying the swimming pool.
He was the first leading Mafia boss to break the deadly code of
omerta, or silence, when he agreed to testify against his associates in
1984.
He has been living mainly in the United States under a witness
protection programme. His whereabouts when he is not in court have been
kept secret for fear the Mafia will kill him.
Thirty-seven of his relatives, including two sons and a brother, have
been killed by the Mafia since 1984.
''The passengers were worried. Most of them are Italians and they know
his story,'' said Antonio de Rosa, a spokesman for the Naples-based
cruise ship company, Starlauro.
''He was really enjoying the cruise, mingling with the other
passengers,'' De Rosa said.
The liner was heading for Catania, the eastern Sicilian port, where
she is due to arrive tomorrow.
De Rosa said the DIA told the cruise company only two days ago that
Buscetta was a passenger.
Piero Grasso of the government commission in charge of Mafia informers
said no state funds were used to pay for Buscetta's holiday and agents
had the situation under control.
''The DIA was perfectly aware of the cruise and could have retrieved
him almost immediately had there been any threat to his security,''
Grasso said.
Italian newspapers ran front-page photographs of Buscetta lounging by
the ship's pool in striped bathing trunks.
The photographs were taken by a reporter for the Italian magazine Oggi
who was a passenger on the cruise and who recognised Buscetta and was
granted an interview.-- Reuter

Goma,
MORE than 130,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees have fled camps
in Zaire to escape Zairean army troops moving in to deport them, but a
Zairean general insisted the refugees should go home.
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Peter
Kessler in Nairobi said some 133,000 Burundian and Rwandan refugees
plunged into forests and parks to escape deportation with no water or
food. They included about 100,000 in the Uvira area, 20,000 in Goma, and
13,000 in Bukavu.
''When the refugees first came, we asked the international community
to give assistance. They have not done enough,'' said Baramoto Kpami,
deputy chief of the Zairean army. ''We now believe that conditions are
in place in Rwanda for the refugees to go home.''
Nearly 15,000 refugees have been expelled this week.
Baramoto said journalists were banned from witnessing the expulsions
and denied reports that Zairean troops had mistreated the refugees: ''We
have been victims of our hospitality,'' he said.
Asked if the mass deportations would continue, he added with a smile:
''The military does its task to the end and finishes when it is told to.
If the UNHCR arrives at a compromise with our government, then we will
have our orders fixed.''
Carrol Faubert, special UNHCR envoy to Rwanda and Burundi, said his
agency was receiving signals from refugee leaders that they would go
home voluntarily if Zairean army troops pulled out.
''What we'd like to do is to change totally the character of what is
going on here and to transform this into a genuine voluntary
repatriation programme,'' he told reporters in the Zairean border town
of Goma, where thousands of refugees have been dumped in no-man's land
by Zairean troops.
More than one million Rwandans of the majority Hutu tribe flooded into
Zaire a year ago, fleeing civil war in their homeland.
Many of the ''refugees'' were soldiers and militiamen who took part in
the genocide of an estimated one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. They
refuse to return to Rwanda, fearing retribution from the now
Tutsi-dominated government there.
The defeated ex-government army is still in uniform, their weapons
hidden from view.
Some 70,000 Burundian Hutus are also in eastern Zaire, fugitives from
ethnic blood-letting in neighbouring Burundi.
A statement from the UN in Rwanda said its operation to receive the
refugees from Zaire was going smoothly and the Rwandan Government was
screening the new arrivals.
Faubert said negotiations were under way in the Zairean capital
Kinshasa, in Goma, and in refugee camps near Bukavu.
Security Council President Nugroho Wisnumurti of Indonesia said in New
York that members wanted ''the Government of Zaire to honour its
obligations to the refugees and to halt its declared policy of the
forcible repatriation of refugees''.
He said the body was working on a formal statement that would also
acknowledge Zaire's help in accepting the refugees.
Yesterday, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, to go to Zaire urgently in
an effort to stop the expulsions.
Zaire, whose own people are not much better off than the Rwandan
refugees, last appealed to Boutros-Ghali in a letter this month asking
the UN to take the refugees off its hands.
The letter was not even answered, diplomats said.
They feel that Zaire will not go all the way to kick out hundreds of
thousands of refugees and see the expulsions as a gesture to draw
international attention to the refugee problem.
Baramoto expressed sympathy for the former Rwandan army government
soldiers among the refugees.
''Have you seen anything bad in their camps? That's only your own
thinking. You must know that they are not our enemies. We are still
brothers,'' he said.--Reuter.

AN off-duty policeman was hailed as a hero in the Ayrshire town of
Girvan after he rescued an unconscious man from a smoke-filled house
last night.
Constable William Young, 42, crawled into the ground-floor flat,
across the road from his own home, and dragged Mr John Ingram, 59, by
his ankles to safety.
''There was fire and debris falling all around him and the heat and
smoke were terrible,'' Constable Young said.
''I grabbed his legs but because of the burns they were wet and
slippery and I wondered if he was going to survive this.''
Mr Ingram was transferred from the Davidson cottage hospital to Ayr
Hospital for specialist treatment of extensive superficial burns to his
back, legs, and arms.

Margaret Vaughan explains why pleas to allow Prince William to enjoy
his Eton education without being ambushed by the paparazzi are destined
to be ignored.
SEEING the oceans of smiling faces and waving hands whenever he left
his home led the young prince to believe that the world was full of
friendly, happy people.
Only later, Prince Charles confessed, was he disabused. His son would
never make that mistake. For him the cheering crowds are to be treated
with caution, the cameras and reporters viewed as potential enemies
waiting to pounce on any indiscretion.
It's a long way from a cherry brandy in a Stornoway pub to the playing
fields of Eton. About the same distance in time, probably, as it's taken
for sometimes grovelling respect for the institution of royalty to
evolve into something like morbid fascination with the doings of its
motley membership.
The heir to the throne must have been relieved, then, at the warning
issued yesterday by Lord Wakeham. He might imagine that the
repercussions kindled by his one act of princely folly, as a naive
schoolboy, in escaping the attentions of popping flashguns by nipping
into a bar in Lewis and ordering up an unlikely drink will not be
visited on Prince William when he arrives at Eton. If so, he is deluding
himself.
The plea for compassionate treatment of Prince William might have been
enough to bring a tear to the glass of eye of any of the foreign
paparazzi who gave it a cursory glance. But it won't work. Not when the
most mundane activities of young royals can make a millionaire of the
most humble hack with contacts overseas. Not when the UK press already
thinks it obeys self-restraint about the royal children.
Self-regulation should begin at home. No more forcing the royal
princes into confusing changes of gear: leather and jeans for Her,
tweeds and kilts for Him. Get the whole lot of them right out of the
limelight: no Disneyland rides with mum, no Alpine snowball fights with
dad.
These are supposed to be unbuttoned, irreverent times when privacy is
a bauble and deference is dead. Yet what is demanded of the media is a
one-sided contract. Stay away, or else.
Unfortunately, the symbiotic nature of the relationship that exists
between royalty and the media ensures that the demand to leave Prince
William alone is unlikely to be met: it is, probably, far too late.
Think about this: the photographs of the royal children plastered
across front pages around the world have not -- with extremely rare
exceptions -- been intrusive paparazzi-style stolen snaps. They have
been set-up stunts: using press and PR contacts, pictures began to
appear of mother and sons splashing in the waves of faraway beaches,
followed by pictures of father and sons romping in Scotland, or
play-fighting on the snowy slopes of Lech.
Much has been made of the royal couple's insistence on giving their
offspring ''normality'' but no amount of Tex-Mex lunches, baseball caps,
or white-water rafting rides can offer normality when your parents make
lurid headlines every day.
Consider for a moment the ordeal of being William. Not only is he
pushed and pulled between two homes and the two lifestyles of his
famously embittered parents, not only is he used as ammunition in the
War of the Wales' Marriage Breakdown, but he is bred to believe in his
destiny as king.
There is, for the Wales children no comforting hinterland of
normality, no time when they are not the object of public fascination,
and more recently, pity. The future can hold no retreat into privacy,
only the inexorable call of more public appearances.
How can they be rendered safely invisible from prying eyes or prurient
attention when the princess talks on and on at official functions about
hugging and snuggling and bedtime cuddles, while her husband rolls them
out in counter-offensives on the grouse moors?  When they exist in a
world of salacious gossip, of Squidgy and Camillagate, of official books
and television interviews which disclose a father who whines about his
dad, sets out an account of his failed marriage, his adultery and his
soul-baring journey round a life he could not cope with?
It could be argued that the biographies of their parents were the
ultimate myth destroyers. That no monarchy could survive the revelations
unharmed. And, of course, we have been complicit in the spectacle of two
spoiled people intent on destroying each others' image. Public interest
is shamelessly engaged with public curiosity. It is fed with helpful
titbits to favoured reporters and writers.
Perhaps there is literally nothing they can do. Lord Wakeham quoted
Bagehot's writing 130-years ago about the public's fascination with a
peek into the king's wardrobe: he did not repeat his warning that
daylight should not be let in on the monarchy for fear it would destroy
its magic.
Maybe their only hope is that somehow we will become bored by the
various twists and turns of their lives in estrangement, and begin to
ignore them. Maybe they just want to revert to being boring.
Other royal families, it's argued, do not suffer the intrusive
attentions that ours do. Ah but. Neither do they seek to manipulate the
media in the same way that ours do. Whether it is by rendezvous in cars
with Daily Mail reporters, or  ''friends'' dropping details of informal
photocalls on remote sun-baked beaches. These are not all, entirely,
accidents.
It would take a strangely hard heart not to believe that Prince
William should be allowed to grow through the painful adolescent years
with a measure of privacy. It may be far too much to hope it will
happen.
For such constraints on intrusion to work there has to be an
acknowledgment on both sides that the children should not be further
exploited. Self-regulation has to cut both ways. Prince William should
not be fought over either as the spoils of a broken marriage or as the
passport to a juicy cheque from foreign magazines with no scruples, and
no fear of the Press Complaints Commission.
The legitimate and important function of a free press, the
investigative activities of newspapers, should not be hobbled by privacy
laws which hinge on the rocky premise that royalty deserves to preserve
its privacy, when it has colluded, and encouraged, its intrusion.

LOTHIAN Regional Council said yesterday it would not enter into
agreements to provide community care unless adequate funding was
provided.
It said there was a #3.7m shortfall in Lothian Health Board's plans
for the mentally ill which were due to be transferred to the local
authority.
Vice-convener of the council's social work committee, Councillor John
Russell, said it backed the strategy but there were insufficient funds.
''We have to be confident the resources are there and we will not be
signing up to any agreement where we feel there is a shortfall. They
need to go back and look at their sums,'' he said.
The issue will be the subject of further talks between the health
board and the council and is further complicated by the fact that
implementation will be carried out by new authorities and not by the
region, which ceases to exist in April next year.
Meanwhile, the Government is giving health chiefs three months to
improve treatment for the mentally ill in the community. The move will
be announced by Ministers today as two damning reports on community care
are published by the Clinical Standards Advisory Group and the Services
Inspectorate.

THE Royal Welch Fusiliers and Ukrainian troops were granted the
go-ahead by Bosnian Serb forces today to quit the besieged Muslim
enclave of Gorazde.
However negotiations were still under way with Bosnian government
forces.
It had been hoped the remaining 170 British troops in the safe area
would start to withdraw tomorrow, but UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel
Chris Vernon said they would have to wait for a small observer force to
move in.
''Clearly there must not be a dislocation -- a gap, if you will --
between the British coming out and the replacement force getting in,''
he said.
''It has been decided there will be a UN military observer force
retained in Gorazde, but the exact size and composition of that force is
still under consideration at UN headquarters in New York.''
He said the UN still intended to withdraw the British force by the end
of the month.
The UN is stressing it is not abandoning the enclave, where 65,000
Muslims are surrounded by the Bosnian Serbs.
Instead it says Nato air power will now be used to deter Serb attacks
on the so-called ''safe area''.
Britain's UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Rupert Smith,
secured the agreement of Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic to allow
the remaining 90 Ukrainian and 170 British peacekeepers to leave at a
meeting yesterday.
In their place will be some 20 unarmed observers, backed by a few
tactical air controllers who could spot targets and co-ordinate Nato air
strikes.

Washington
THE trial of the century resumed in Los Angeles today -- not O J
Simpson in the dock, but the Menendez brothers.
This was the first case to blanket the news and make Court TV a
premium channel in 1993 and 1994. The brothers were on trial for killing
their parents, and all America watched. After nine months, the two
juries failed to agree on their guilt.
Now they are up for trial again, but things are different. They are
being tried together with one jury; they spent all the fortune they
inherited from their parents on the first trial so are reduced to one
prominent lawyer, instead of a whole pack; and the Simpson trial
continues to hog the spotlight. Court TV is not going to broadcast the
drama this time and CNN is ignoring it completely.
It all means that their second trial will be much quicker, have much
less publicity, and might produce a verdict.
The murders were six years ago, when Erik was 18 and Lyle 21. The
brothers offered the defence that they had been bullied and abused by
their father and feared for their lives. So they bought a couple of
guns, and shot their father and mother in the back as they were watching
television at their Beverly Hills mansion.
The young men then went out on a spending spree. Police arrested them
months later and they confessed.

TWO men were last night being sought by Strathclyde Police after a
young mother from Maryhill, Glasgow, was seriously injured in a shotgun
blast. The police are working on the theory that the wounding was
accidental but were yesterday receiving little assistance.
The victim was 26-year-old Lorraine McAree, who had been at home at
the family flat in Cottar Street, Maryhill, with her husband, Matthew,
28, and their two children, Matthew, seven, and Mark, six months.
Two other men, friends of the family but unrelated, were also present
in the flat on Tuesday evening and fled the scene after the incident
which apparently took place in a bedroom where the younger child was
asleep.
Although there was no immediate explanation yesterday why two men
should arrive at the house and be given permission to assemble a shotgun
in a bedroom, it appeared from early accounts that that is what took
place and that Mrs MacAree was shot in the groin when she walked into
the room.
The injured woman was taken to Glasgow's Western Infirmary where her
condition was described as serious.

JORDAN'S King Hussein today accused Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein of
contemplating a second invasion of Kuwait, but said he would not close
the border that links Iraq to the outside world.
The king said in a televised speech that the recent defection of a top
Iraqi general and son-in-law of Saddam had revealed the nature of the
Baghdad government.
He said that Iraqi leaders had discussed attacking both Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia.
''There were plans that were discussed days before his defection and
on the highest levels of Iraq to attack Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and our
view is that only to think of such an act and the possibility of
executing it forms a catastrophic disaster,'' the king said.
Lieutenant General Hussein Kamel Hassan, the mastermind of Saddam's
secret military programmes, defected to Jordan on August 8 with other
members of the ruling circle. King Hussein gave them asylum.
The king said UN sanctions against Iraq would not be lifted until
Saddam honoured demands well beyond eliminating weapons of mass
destruction.
However he said Jordan would not close the border because it would cut
off food and medicine: ''This is a matter that we do not contemplate
because we are with the people of Iraq as much as we can until the long
night of their suffering ends.''
* Rolf Ekeus, the UN official in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, said that Baghdad's new policy of co-operation had
advanced the date for ending the ban on Iraqi oil sales imposed after
the Gulf war.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Bungle clears three of birds' eggs charges</HEADLINE>

THREE people, who faced fines of up to #50,000 if found guilty of
possessing the eggs of protected birds, were freed yesterday following
an administrative error.
The trio were accused of illegally being in control of shells of 105
different species but the case was dropped by the Crown midway through
their trial at Dumbarton Sheriff Court.
The court was told by Constable Ronnie Sewell, who specialises in
wildlife matters for Strathclyde Police, that he had been tipped off
about a possible illegal collection of eggs in a house in Bonhill,
Dunbartonshire.
He and a colleague then obtained a search warrant signed by Dumbarton
Justice of the Peace George Bonar, and raided the property and seized
the eggs.
However, yesterday, solicitor Tom Brown, representing Mr Allan
Cameron, 25, claimed in court that the warrant was dated wrongly.
Later, after prolonged behind-the-scenes legal debate,
procurator-fiscal Bernard Abblett admitted he was forced to drop the
whole case because of the bungle.
It was claimed the handwriting on the vital document looked more like
it had been issued in 1974, instead of 1994, and Mr Abblett said: ''The
details are at the very least ambiguous, and therefore incomplete.
''The Crown cannot look behind a warrant and cannot cure any defect,
and I propose to lead no more evidence as a result.''
Sheriff Marcus Greene declared: ''The case must fall.''
Mr Cameron, of Broomhill Crescent, Bonhill, his sister Margaret, 22,
and her fiance George Voisey, 20, both of Pappert Estate, Bonhill,
denied two charges under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
They pleaded not guilty to being in control or possession of the eggs
of 96 British wild birds and nine specially protected species.
These included shells from an osprey, peregrine falcon, marlin, little
tern, and barn owl.
If convicted, they faced a maximum total fine of #50,000.
The outcome was greeted with amazement and anger by Mr Keith Morton,
Scottish inspector of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
He said: ''It's all very unfortunate. A lot of people have put an
awful lot of work into bringing this case to court. Now it has all gone
down the drain because of a stipid mistake.''
He added: ''In effect, the seizure of the eggs did not happen because
of the mistake. I suppose also, that in effect, the eggs didn't exist
either.''
The court was told that Mr Morton had spent weeks identifying each
seized shell, and had investigated where the specially protected eggs
had been taken from.
Mr Cameron said as he left court: ''I'm glad it's all over. I don't
know anything about the eggs.''
At the same court last year, a friend of the three, Mr Brian Forsyth,
24, was fined a record #16,000, later reduced to #2000 by the Appeal
Court in Edinburgh, for possessing eggs and stealing them from nests.
Mr Bonar admitted he was surprised when told of the unexpected outcome
of the case.
He said: ''I certainly remember signing the warrant but I'm sure I
would have put the right date on it. I just can't see me making a
mistake like that.''

<HEADLINE>Authority faces #300m shortfall</HEADLINE>

THE new East of Scotland Water Authority faces a shortfall of at least
#300m for capital projects over the next five years, according to
figures supplied by the councils whose services it is taking over.
A large increase in private sector investment will be needed to bridge
the gap between total planned spending by the outgoing councils on water
and sewerage projects and the funding likely to be agreed by the
Government.
At the water quango's first meeting in Edinburgh, chairman Dr Ian
Preston said it would be seeking the investment under the Private
Finance Initiative, as the Government was anxious to relieve pressure on
public borrowing levels.
Chief executive Mr Rod Rennet said what was needed was a substantial
transfer of risk to private contractors who would build, own, and
operate new water and sewerage facilities for the authority.
A number of projects along these lines have already been developed by
councils in the area including the Seafield sewage treatment works in
Edinburgh.
But officials warned that using private finance would not provide a
magic formula to pay for the cost of meeting rising standards.
Next April, the new authority will take over services currently run by
Central region, Borders, Fife, and Lothian. Water charges currently vary
from an average of #95 a year for domestic users in the Borders to #46 a
year in Central.
Speaking after the meeting, Dr Preston, a former chief executive of
ScottishPower, refused to speculate by how much water charges would rise
next year. But he indicated that the board was unlikely to move
immediately to harmonise bills throughout the area -- the Government's
ultimate aim.
A code of practice was being prepared for all customers, who would
continue to enjoy high-quality water provision, he said.
Commenting on the authority's funding problems, the Labour president
of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Councillor Rosemary
McKenna, said: ''This is what we knew was happening with regard to water
and sewerage services. This underfunding is just what we have been
warning about for years.''
In order to compensate, the new quangos would have to turn to the
private sector, which was exactly what the Government wanted them to do,
she said.
Meanwhile, water companies south of the Border were last night locked
in confrontation with the industry watchdog, Ofwat, over whether they
should compensate householders for hosepipe bans.
Mr Alan Booker, Ofwat deputy director general, said: ''We're asking
companies to take a customer-caring attitude and consider whether there
are grounds for compensating all customers who have suffered loss of
service during the current drought.''
One in three Britons, around 18 million people, are currently subject
to hosepipe bans but water companies claim there are no grounds for
compensation.
Garden centres, landscape gardeners, and other non-domestic users were
also complaining that their business was being affected.
''Quite frankly, this kind of situation is not acceptable to
customers,'' he said.
Mr Booker said companies signed an agreement in April to offer refunds
or rebates to customers for poor service and for consequential losses.
But a spokesman for North West Water, where seven million people are
hit by restrictions, said: ''The agreement concedes that it's not
reasonable to expect us to pay for restrictions imposed on us by
exceptional weather conditions.
''We can't believe that Ofwat is saying that the hottest summer on
record doesn't fall under that heading.''
A spokesman for Severn Trent, where a similar number are affected,
said: ''We believe compensation is payable when we fail to live up to
the levels of service which we set ourselves. That's to ensure water is
available at the tap.''
Ofwat has the power to punish water companies for poor service when it
sets price limits, but the next opportunity will not come before 1999 at
the earliest.

Los Angeles,
ACTOR Larry Hagman, who found fame as the villainous J R Ewing in
Dallas, underwent a successful liver transplant today.
A Cedars Sinai Medical Centre spokesman, Mr Ron Wise, said
''everything went fine'' although the 16-hour operation took longer than
expected.
Hagman, 63, who was diagnosed in 1992 with cirrhosis of the liver, was
placed on a waiting list for a donor organ on July 19 after doctors
detected a cancerous tumour on his liver.
He has publicly acknowledged drinking heavily for years.
Hagman waited just over a month for his new liver.
Doctors said his tumour was the size of a golf ball and in the early
stages of development, making him a good candidate for a successful
transplant.
He received intense chemotherapy earlier this month to reduce the size
of the tumour.
Hagman made his name in TV in the 1960s playing light comedy roles.
He found international fame in the soap opera Dallas as the Texas
oilman who schemed to destroy his worst enemies and betray his best
friends.
The popular series ran from 1978 to 1991. CBS is reportedly
considering a Dallas reunion film in which Hagman would recreate his
role as J R.--Reuter.

THE fight against drugs in Scotland's jails will continue, Home
Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton promised yesterday when he
toured the drug rehabilitation unit of Saughton Prison in Edinburgh.
The Scottish Office Minister, a former Oxford Blue in boxing, could
not resist the temptation to have a swing at a punchbag in the prison
sports hall during his tour.
He said later that he was impressed with work being done, pointing out
that the number of positive Aids cases had reduced from 50 last year to
12.
Prisoner governor John Durno added that increased close-circuit
television surveillance had been installed, random drug searches carried
out, and sniffer dogs brought in.
Lord James said it was important to tighten up as much as possible
moves to stop drugs reaching prisoners and lockers had been installed at
Saughton where visitors had to leave their belongings.
The Minister also visited the recently criticised D Hall, which is
undergoing a #1.4m refurbishment. Referring to prison suicides, he said:
''Safety netting is being installed and extra surveillance points are
being put in, where prisoners, perhaps emotionally stressed and at risk,
can be checked.''
He praised the 430 staff, who are responsible for 650 prisoners, for
coping during the upheaval of refurbishment.
Asked about his joust with the punchbag, Lord James said he had no-one
in mind when he was laying his punches. ''It is rather like self defence
at the dispatch box,'' he added, denying that his nickname in the
Scottish Office was ''Tyson''.

ONE very lucky cat was counting the remainder of its nine lives last
night after surviving a 10-mile journey under a car bonnet, jammed up
against the fan belt.
Edinburgh motorist Dennis Farquhar's Metro was purring perfectly when
he set off from Gilmerton for Wallyford, near Musselburgh, on Tuesday.
It began to overheat and, on investigation, he and the crew of a passing
fire engine he had waved down, discovered a ginger and white tom trapped
in the engine compartment.
The firefighters freed the animal and called out an SSPCA inspector,
who took it to a nearby vet for treatment.
After an overnight stay with the vet, the cat was transferred to the
SSPCA's animal welfare centre at Balerno. It is hoped it will be
reunited with its owner as the result of publicity.
Mr Paul Anderson, SSPCA inspector, said yesterday: ''It must have been
attracted by the heat of the engine and climbed in from underneath.
''It was bruised and has lost a few patches of fur.''
Leading firefighter Gillies Crichton, one of the Tranent-based crew
who freed the cat, said: 'This is the first time I've come across a cat
trapped in a car engine. The driver told me that he'd been doing up to
70mph.''

CYCLIST Bruce Bursford pedalled his way into history yesterday by
setting a world speed record of 207.9mph.
The 37-year-old designer from Dereham, Norfolk, collapsed after
half-a-minute of sheer effort at Brooklands, Surrey, on his Lola
Ultimate cycle.
Bursford, whose machine cost #1m and took four years to develop, broke
the old record of 152mph on a rolling road inside the Malcolm Campbell
building at the birthplace of British motorsport and aviation.
The bike, which weighs only 11lb and has a theoretical speed of
250mph, hit 60mph in two seconds.
At the end, Bursford -- watched by wife Tracey and their daughters
Samantha, six, and Jade, two -- slumped exhausted, oblivious to the
cheers of his organisation team.
When he had recovered, the elated rider said: ''I knew I would have to
hurt myself to do it.
''Now I want to set a record of 200mph on a road. The bike can do
it.''
He said the attempt had been in doubt after problems with the bike's
tyres and the rolling road.
''We were up until 1am working on it but I've achieved an ambition.
All the sacrifices my family have had to make have been worth it.''
The high-geared superbikes are now on the market at #10,000 each.
Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman wants one and the American Olympic
team is also interested.
Bursford trained for four hours a day to build up his stamina. His
trainer, Cefyn Lloyd, from Barnham Broom, Norwich, now plans to ride
pillion on a tandem version of the bike to set another record with
Bruce.
Mr Lloyd said: ''We've had to do a lot of work to get him fit but he
was always incredibly strong. He has put a tremendous effort into this
record . . . I'm proud of him.''
Mrs Bursford said: ''I'm so proud of him. All the sacrifices, doing
without holidays and so on, have been worthwhile. He has lived and
breathed this bike and this record. I couldn't believe it when he
managed it.''
The bike is fabricated by a process of ''cooking'' under pressure in
an oven. Metal components such as wheel axles and gear teeth are
machined from titanium and aircraft-grade aluminium.
Ceramic bearings, producing 30% less friction than conventional
bearings, are used and a specially developed ''Friction Killer'',
developed by Anglo-American Oil Company, cuts friction by almost 90%.

A WOMAN with only one arm and one leg has been told she is
''insufficiently disabled'' to qualify for mobility allowance.
Mrs Frances Park, 32, who lost an arm and a leg in a road accident
when she was two, has had her claim for a car rejected by the
Government's Benefits Agency.
She said: ''They've never even sent a doctor round to see me. I just
filled in the form and someone decided I wasn't disabled enough for a
mobility car.''
The mother-of-two, who has now had her claim for Disability Living
Allowance rejected five times, was shocked by the latest reason given.
She said: ''This letter says that I can still walk without any help --
but I have to get my children to tie my own shoelaces and I have to get
taxis to the shop or to the doctor.
''It seems that some people have no problem getting a mobility car but
the only thing I'm entitled to is a wheelchair.''
Mrs Park, of Dundee, currently receives #82 per week income support
and Family Allowance for her two children. Her boyfriend, Mr David Kemp,
26, stressed their complaint wasn't just about money.
He said: ''We're not after a brand new car. We just want what Franny
is entitled to. She doesn't sit around and sulk about her handicap. But
the DSS aren't treating her fairly.''
The mobility scheme has also been criticised by Dundee MP Ernie Ross,
who said: ''The scheme should be widened so that people like this young
lady get the help they need.''
A Benefits Agency spokeswoman said: ''To qualify for the mobility
component of the Disabled Living Allowance the person must have severe
difficulty in getting around. They must be unable or virtually unable to
walk.
''Anyone who has an application rejected and wishes to question a
decision has rights of review and appeal.''

A STRATHCLYDE detective will make a regular check on his son's house
to make sure that he remains drug free, a court heard yesterday.
This is one of a series of stringent conditions imposed on Chief
Superintendent Harry Bell's son Ian, who was shown mercy by Lord
Coulsfield at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The judge placed Ian Bell, 22, on probation for two years and ordered
him to carry out 240 hours' community service.
Bell, whose father was one of the team who investigated the Lockerbie
disaster, was appearing for sentence after he admitted making #1500
worth of counterfeit notes at his home at Quarry Street, Hamilton.
He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of 43 fake notes,
passing counterfeit money, and the reset of two cars.
At an earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow, the judge was told
that Bell was caught after buying a soft drink in a Lanarkshire chip
shop with a #10 note. The shop owner contacted police and Bell was
arrested.
He had bought a large number of items, all of small value, with the
forged #10 notes, and when police searched his home, they found a
photocopier capable of producing high- quality counterfeit notes.
When asked what the copier was for, Bell replied: ''For making
money.''
Lord Coulsfield had deferred sentence until yesterday for background
reports.
Mr Herbert Kerrigan, QC, defence counsel, said that, because of Bell's
lifestyle, there had been a major rift with his parents.
Relations between Bell and his father had now improved and the son had
agreed to abide by five stringent conditions if Lord Coulsfield did not
send him to jail.
His father would find him suitable accommodation, he would end his
previous involvement with drugs, he would get a job, and maintain
regular contact with his family.
The fifth condition was that Bell accepted that his father would be in
a position to look around the house and make sure that there was no
suggestion of any involvement in drugs.
Mr Kerrigan informed the court that Ian Bell was receiving daily
treatment for drugs abuse.
Lord Coulsfield told Bell the offences were very serious and prison
was an option. However, he had been persuaded by a plea by Mr Kerrigan.
In the case of co-accused, John Horne, 21, of Kemp Street, Hamilton,
the judge placed him on probation for two years and made a community
service order for 150 hours.
Horne also admitted making and possessing forged notes.
Mr David Burns, QC, defence counsel, said the offence was completely
out of character.

AN obsessively jealous man who stabbed his former fiancee 124 times
was jailed for life yesterday.
A jury took 30 minutes to find William Brown, 34, guilty of murdering
Linda Marshall, 31, in her home.
The High Court in Glasgow had heard how the couple's bloodsoaked
two-year-old son, Alexander, was found cradled in the arms of his
mutilated mother. A neighbour found him desperately trying to wake her.
The killing happened in Ms Marshall's home in Skye Court, Ravenswood,
Cumbernauld, in April 21 last.
Outside court, her brother, Gordon Marshall, 29, said the boy had had
nightmares since his mother's murder.
He said: ''He wakens up screaming in the night and calling for her. He
is completely inconsolable but he is too young to be given psychiatric
help. All we can give him is a lot of love to help make the memory of
his ordeal disappear.''
Mr Marshall said a legal dispute had started over the boy involving
both sets of grandparents.
He said: ''Linda's mother, who has been caring for Alex since the
tragedy, is already seeking custody, and I believe Brown's parents have
also seen a lawyer.''
Brown, a part-time St Andrew's first-aid attendant, killed Ms Marshall
in a ''frenzy of unparalleled ferocity'' after she ended their
relationship.
He claimed in court he could remember nothing of the attack, although
a policeman told how he had confessed to killing her in a fit of rage.
He told the policeman: ''Please forgive me, I don't deserve to live.''
Despite the fact she had broken with him two months beforehand, Brown
apparently still loved Ms Marshall to the point of obsession.
Brown and Ms Marshall had lived together for some time in her home but
after the birth of her second son, Alexander -- she had another son,
Gary, 10, by a previous relationship -- she began to cool on him.
In February, Brown moved out because of a combination of their poor
relationship and an investigation by the Department of Social Security
into benefit claims, and went to stay with Ms Marshall's mother.
When Ms Marshall announced she was going with a girlfriend for an
Easter weekend visit to Wales, Brown began to brood.
He wrongly believed she was going away for a dirty weekend and asked
her friend, Ms Agnes Rutherford, 28, the deputy commandant of the local
St Andrew's Ambulance Association unit, to spy on her.
Ms Marshall did meet another man to whom she was very attracted,
24-year-old brewery technician Philip Jackson from the town of Undy,
near Newport.
Their relationship, however, was no more than a kiss and cuddle on her
last night in Wales before travelling home.
Ms Marshall arrived home on Easter Monday night and the next day told
Brown she had met another man.
Over the next couple of days, even hours before her death, Brown told
friends he was going to knife her -- because if he couldn't have her,
nobody else was.
He stole a slip of paper with Jackson's name, address, and telephone
number on it from her purse, and made two anonymous phone calls to him.
However, Ms Marshall remembered Jackson's address and wrote a last
letter to him, telling him how she felt physically attracted to him.
She also wrote that Brown was hounding her because he could not accept
that they had split up and how she suspected he had stolen the slip of
paper with his address.
She added: ''Willie, I reckon, is mentally sick,'' and ended by
telling him: ''I love my children more than life itself and I love life.
I, too, am going to enjoy life now that Willie and me are finished after
a hellish four years.''
On the Friday morning, Brown went to visit Ms Marshall, persuading her
mother, Mrs Dorothy Marshall, with whom he had lived following the
separation, that she should not accompany him.
Sitting in the living room while Ms Marshall was out hanging washing,
Brown rummaged through her handbag, found her photo album, and saw a
snapshot of her and Jackson together.
The innocent picture was the catalyst for the bloodbath.
At the end of the trial, Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, defending, asked the
jury to find Brown guilty of a reduced charge of culpable homicide.
He said: ''There is a temptation for you to act like a lynch mob and
say that hanging is too good for him.
''You have heard how Linda was stabbed 124 times and how her son was
found climbing over her dead body.''
Asking the jury to accept that Brown suffered from diminished
responsibility, he added: ''He snapped and was not fully responsible for
what he did.''

HIGHLANDS and Islands Enterprise yesterday published its annual
report, claiming record levels in job creation and private sector
investment in the Highland economy but conceding that the Western Isles
are still falling behind.
Launching the annual report in Inverness yesterday, HIE chairman
Fraser Morrison and chief executive Iain Robertson said the figures for
1994-95 pointed to the beginning of a renaissance in the Highlands and
Islands.
The population was rising; 20,000 more people were in work today than
a decade ago; 3383 jobs created or retained; 1026 business projects
assisted; 336 new small businesses started up; #61.5m of private sector
investment attracted; 8557 people taking up training opportunities; and
421 community projects backed.
This all compared favourably with the previous year. Record levels of
activity and record inward investment won, the latter expected to bring
more than 300 jobs. The level of private sector investment, up by #6.7m
on the previous year, and levered by #21.2m of network funding, showed
that businesses in the area were willing to invest for the future.
Meanwhile, unemployment in the HIE area fell from 9.8% to 8.8% in the
1994-5 period, and latest figures for July showed it down to 8.1%.
Mr Robertson put particular emphasis on the growth of population,
which had always been taken as a yardstick of Highland prosperity. In
1961, it had been 322,000 but, for the latest figures for 1994, it stood
at 372,000.
He said: ''The 1994-95 result show the people of this area are
steadily confounding critics and armchair economists by responding to
challenges with energy and innovation, replacing products and markets of
the past with those of the future, and by demonstrating the real value
of cultural and community strength.
''People here have long borne the image of powerless victims of
economic and social circumstance but these same people are bystanders no
more. The past is another story but the present and the future are
increasingly being fashioned by their own capable and confident hands.''
Mr Morrison had a similar view: ''Today, the people of the Highlands
and Islands are more assertive and quicker to take a pride in their
achievements and what this area has to offer. These are all positive
traits of character. New industries are broadening and strengthening the
economy, and community and cultural confidence has burgeoned.''
Both, however, said the economic facts of life in the Western Isles
were still hard. Unemployment in July was 11.3% which, along with Wick,
was second only to Forres, at 14.7% in the high area. However, the
Western Isles was the LEC area which still suffered worst from the
age-old Highland problem of depopulation.
Mr Robertson said the Western Isles continued to be a problem, with
Harris a prime example: ''We are trying to create as wide a range of
jobs in the Western Isles as possible. Particular efforts these last few
years have been on new projects, such as Callanish Pharmaceuticals and
Harris Tweed.
''But we're also working on the new croft entrance scheme, tourist
schemes such as the Callanish Visitors' Centre and now, with the new
boat on the Stornoway-Ullapool run, we would hope to see more tourists
coming to the islands and going through them. Particularly as next year
there will be the new car ferry running between North Uist and Harris.
It's continuous effort.''

A PROPERTY developer who stole a colleague's pet cat as a ''foolish
prank'' during a row over money was jailed yesterday for three months.
Nigel Bass, 33, had exploited Miss Ilona Szekere's affections and
emotions when he catnapped William the Persian Blue from its home in
Clapham, London, the Old Bailey heard.
Miss Szekere had pleaded: ''All I want is my cat -- please don't hurt
him.'' Bass demanded #10,000 for the cat's safe return.
''Blackmail in its very essence strikes at the vulnerability of the
victim,'' the judge, Recorder Ann Curnow told Bass.
''Her profound anxiety is painfully clear from the evidence. You were
playing throughout on her emotions.
''She was a friend and colleague and you knew of her love and devotion
for her cats, especially William.''
Bass had told police afterwards that for Miss Szekere, her two cats
were like children.
She once told him: ''If you ever want to get anything out of me --
kidnap my cats.''
Bass, of Shepherd's Bush, London, admitted blackmailing Miss Szekere
last January after he became irritated that she had not paid him what he
thought he should have received at the end of a second property deal he
had worked on for her.
The two were good friends. He often visited her flat and they
sometimes went out to dinner and talked on the telephone regularly.
There was no sexual element in their relationship, said Bass's counsel,
Mr John Ryder.
The taking of William ''was conceived in jest but ran quickly out of
control and he is genuinely sorry'', he added.
''But the escalation from what he calls a foolish prank into something
more serious is not exclusively of his making,'' said Mr Ryder.
Bass had meant no harm to William or its owner, said Mr Ryder. During
the cat's incarceration, the pet was given his favourite cat food and
bought cat milk from a pet shop.
He told Miss Szekere: ''The cat is being treated like a princess.''
Bass's wife Prue wept as he was taken to cells. She said outside
court: ''I cannot believe it has happened really.''
Miss Szekere, who was not in court, first discovered William was
missing when she received a call from Bass claiming she should pay him
more money.
He asked: ''What do you love more than anything else in the world?''
When she went to prepare lunch for the cat, she found William was
gone. She alerted police, withdrew money, and went to the Hilton hotel,
where Bass had arranged to hand over the cat.
As cat and owner were reunited, police moved in.
Bass had been remanded for reports before sentence yesterday.

Srinagar
TWO Britons and two other Westerners held hostage by militants in
Kashmir were today heard saying they had ''no problems'' as hopes rose
that they could be freed.
Indian officials released an audio-cassette of the men's voices along
with five black-and-white photographs. They had been demanding proof
from the kidnappers that all four were unharmed and well.
In the latest pictures, Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, and the
American and German held with them, appear unkempt but healthy. In the
recording their voices sound clear and strong.
A spokesman for the Jammu and Kashmir government warned that because
both the tape and photographs appeared to date from August 18 there was
no way to be certain they were still safe and sound.
However the willingness of the Al-Faran militants who are holding them
to provide the evidence and continuing contacts raised hopes of winning
the men's freedom through negotiations.
A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was found beheaded
in an isolated forest 10 days ago near a note in which Al-Faran
threatened to kill the four others unless India freed 15 jailed
guerrilla hardliners.
The five photographs included a group picture showing the four men
seated in a room with a low ceiling, holding a newspaper written in
Urdu.
In each of the individual photographs, a hostage is shown holding a
sheet of white paper on which the date August 18 is written in Urdu.
The brief tape starts with American Donald Hutchings, who says: ''I am
fit, well, and have no problems.''
German Dirk Hasert and the two Britons follow, saying they have ''no
problems'' and sending love to their female companions, each mentioned
by name.
Mr Mangan asked that his love be passed on to his family. Mr Wells
finished his section with the words: ''See you soon.''
Buoyed by the tape and pictures, officials said they were pinning
their hopes on a negotiated solution that could involve the release of
the hostages and a number of jailed Kashmiri separatists.
However they said there were no plans to bow to the Al-Faran group's
demand that three hard-line militants be freed.
''Perhaps ordinary people could be released in the normal course of
events,'' an official said. ''This is a possible option.''
Since the beginning of the hostage ordeal early last month, India has
said it would not swop jailed criminals for the men.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE AA warned drivers of an unusual road hazard yesterday -- rain. The
organisation reported dozens of extra call-outs to accidents caused by
light showers and blamed the crashes on the ''wrong kind of rain''.
An official said: ''I know it sounds like a British Rail excuse but
light showers are the most dangerous thing of all after weeks of
sunshine.
''During the heat, a thin film of oil, diesel, grit, bits of old tyre,
and dirt covers the road surfaces and sets hard.''
She went on: ''A heavy downpour would clear the film away but a light
shower would have no effect. The water would have nowhere to seep into
and so would remain.
''It makes the road greasy and, more dangerously, unnoticeably so to
many drivers until they have to brake suddenly. It's as bad as ice.''
The AA and emergency services advise drivers to slow down in areas
where it is raining or has recently rained, and to double braking
distances.
The AA official added: ''Roads could turn into skidpans so if you are
going at 50mph leave 100 metres braking distance.
''It is an extra problem for the English Bank Holiday when we would
normally expect more call-outs anyway. A light shower will not stop the
exodus.
''Rain is obviously a relief for many people after the weather we have
had recently but it will take a heavy downpour to get the roads back to
normal.''
Motorists should also make sure they have plenty of tread on their
tyres.

Plymouth
AUTHORITIES ordered the southern half of this tiny Caribbean island to
be evacuated today after scientists warned there was a 75% chance that a
rumbling volcano would erupt.
Forty extra marines from the Plymouth-based 42 Commando will fly out
by Hercules transport aircraft from RAF Lyneham tomorrow morning to help
with evacuees, traffic management and public order tasks.
Scientists told civil authorities they could no longer assure six
hours notice of a major eruption, said Montserrat Governor Frank Savage.
About 6000 people, including the entire population of the capital,
were told to move to the north coast, where they will be housed in
public shelters and a tent city.
Montserrat's Chances Peak volcano, which last had a major eruption
more than 100 years ago, has been spewing ash and hot gases since July
18.
Tourists and residents jammed the single-runway airport on the eastern
side of the island today after Chief Minister Reuben Meade said chances
were increasing that the volcano would blow soon.
A platoon of Royal Marines directed traffic along narrow roads as
residents loaded cars with belongings.
''It has taken a while but I think there's some sense of urgency
now,'' said Lance Corporal Robert Henderson.
HMS Southampton remains on standby in case a full-scale evacuation of
the former British colony is required.--Reuter.

ANGRY Scottish National Party leaders got hot under the collar
yesterday when it emerged that a London shirtmaker is putting Made in
England labels on Scots-manufactured garments.
Hilditch &amp; Key, the Jermyn Street makers of top people's shirts, has
all of its hand-made shirts made north of the Border but gives them
English labels, despite the strength of Scotland as a quality brand
image overseas.
Defending the labels, a company spokeswoman failed to endear herself
to Scots patriots when she declared that ''everyone abroad thinks that
England means Britain anyway''.
Ms Danielle Smallberger, merchandise director for the firm, added:
''We feel that the Scots should just be very happy that we have a
factory up there employing 100 people.''
SNP vice-president Andrew Welsh attacked the company's ''patronising''
attitude and called for a change in the law to make labelling of
products more accurate.
Hilditch &amp; Key employs about 100 people at its Glenrothes factory,
where 250 top-quality, hand-made cotton shirts are produced each day.
Ms Smallberger said: ''Shirts made for export are labelled Made in
England even though they are made in Scotland. We have checked the
legality of this and it is perfectly legal. We are a Jermyn Street
shirtmaker with our registered office in England.
''We are enitled to label these shirts Made in England because
everyone abroad thinks that England means Britain anyway.''
However, she revealed that the company was re-labelling its shirts
sold in the UK ''in the interests of accuracy''.
She said: ''Our shirts for the domestic market were labelled Made in
England but we are in the process of changing that to Made in Britain as
we prefer to be more accurate.''
Mr Welsh, MP for Angus East, said: ''It is outrageous that products
which are made in Scotland can be wrongly marketed as Made in England.
If it is indeed lawful to do this, then the law is an ass and must be
changed.
''This just adds to Scotland's problems as an invisible nation on the
international scene. Our economy suffers because of it. Without a strong
image overseas, we will never be able to cash in fully on our potential
to market Scotland and Scottish products.''
He added: ''I will be writing to the trading standards authorities as
a matter of urgency, challenging them to justify the current rules.''
According to representatives of organisations involved in promoting
the export of Scottish goods, a Made in Scotland label can be a strong
selling point.
Mr Iain McTaggart, trade development executive with the Scottish
Council Development and Industry, said yesterday: ''The Scottish label
is a distinct marketing asset in many instances. It gives a cachet to a
lot of goods, particularly in textiles, food, and drink.''
''There has been quite a bit of research done into the perception of
Scottishness in other markets and Scotland does seem to be associated
with perceptions of quality, natural environment, purity, and
cleanliness. We would encourage people to address any Scottish elements
that could help them in their marketing endeavours.''
One textile company that most people would associate with a quality
Scottish image is Pringle of Scotland. Speaking at its Hawick HQ
yesterday, deputy managing director Peter Williams explained that its
shirts were made in various countries, but all its knitwear was made in
Scotland and labelled as such.
He said: ''The Scottish connection of the Pringle brand is certainly
an asset in overseas markets.''

THE housing charity Shelter (Scotland) yesterday described as a
''myth'' surveys which claimed there were 100,000 houses lying empty in
Scotland.
New figures published by the charity estimate that a more realistic
assessment would be between 30,000 and 40,000. It also claims many of
those would require significant investment to make them habitable.
Mr Gavin Corbett, the charity's research and information officer,
insisted that surveys which showed there were 100,000 empty properties
north of the Border took no account of the reasons why properties were
empty at a particular time.
He said houses which were lying empty which could be made available to
the homeless were a waste of a ''valuable resource'' and a ''betrayal''
of the people most in need of help.
Mr Corbett said: ''It is simplistic and misleading to imply that, if
homeless people and empty houses could be brought together, homelessness
in Scotland could be eradicated. There can be no excuse for neglecting a
radical programme of building and repair.''

REPORTED cases of fraud in Scotland increased by more than 20% in the
first six months of this year, according to figures released yesterday.
However, despite the apparent upsurge, the value of the frauds was
down significantly.
Statistics released by accountancy firm, KPMG, showed the number of
cases increased from 46 in the second half of last year to 58 in the
first six months of this year.
The actual value of frauds was down from #5,980,000 to #1,620,000,
according to the accountants' fraud barometer which tracks all press
reports of fraud or alleged fraud over #1000.
Scotland's fraud total is minuscule compared with figures for the rest
of the UK involving cases of more than #100,000 which were also released
yesterday by the firm's UK forensic team.
A total of #86m of frauds were recorded in the UK, of which #32m
occurred in south-east England, #30m in the Midlands, and #16m in
north-west England.
Only three cases in excess of #100,000 were recorded in Scotland, with
a total value of #1m, placing the area firmly at the bottom of the big
fraud league, along with Wales, where #1m of frauds were recorded.
The most common types of fraud in Scotland were obtaining loans or
credit under false pretences. These accounted for 28%, around #450,000,
while the fraudulent sale of assets accounted for 28%, #455,000.
In the event, lenders and businesses suffered most, losing #715,000
and #680,000 respectively, 44% and 42% of the total losses.
Almost 50% of all frauds reported during the first six months of this
year, accounting for #775,000, were perpetrated by the general public.
This compared with #233,000 in the previous six months.
While statistics in previous reports have recorded a number of
high-value frauds involving several million pounds, by contrast the
highest reported case recorded in the six-month period to June was a
leasing fraud amounting to #425,000.
KPMG said a ''discouraging increase'' had been recorded in smaller
frauds, many involving cheques and credit cards. Fourteen cases in this
category, together valued at #154,000, compared with half a dozen cases
valued at #70,000 in the previous six months.
Mr Robin Crawford, Scottish forensic accounting partner with KPMG,
said: ''Fraud remains an endemic part of our society and only through
constant attention by businesses and other organisations to financial
controls can it be kept within bounds.''

#30,000 from Standard Life's offices in Thistle Street and #10,000 worth
of computer chips from British Telecom in Gorgie Road.

<HEADLINE>Revival for Ayrshire brewing industry</HEADLINE>

THE brewing industry is set to be revived in Ayrshire within the next
couple of weeks for only the second time since its demise almost 50
years ago.
The industry was once vibrant in several parts of Burns country with
about six private operators. But the advent of the major brewers and
increasing costs incurred by the independent breweries spelled the death
knell for the industry in Ayrshire soon after the Second World War.
There was an attempt to revive a brewery in Stevenston in the
mid-1980s but this failed after about six months.
However, the brewing process is about to be resurrected this weekend
with the fruits from it expected to be on sale to customers by the
following week.
The process, however, is not, as one may have thought, being run from
the area's main commercial centres of Ayr or Kilmarnock. It will all
happen in the basement of a former coaching inn in the rather unlikely
setting of the village of Lugton, which boasts 17 houses, two public
houses, and a telephone box.
Mr Chris Lynas is behind the plans for the brewery and owns the Lugton
Inn, which lies on the A736 Barrhead to Irvine road, four miles east of
Beith.
He rejected a suggestion that setting up the Lugton Brewery, which has
cost about #120,000, did not make economic sense given that his hostelry
already sells six real ales and that the major brewers control more than
90% of all beers consumed.
''Drinking habits are changing with customers becoming much more
selective in their choice of beers,'' he said. ''They are drinking more
these days for the taste rather than the effect.
''Generally speaking if a customer is going to have two pints he wants
them to be memorable.''
1 Mr Lynas has sought the advice of Professor Geoff Palmer, a
professor of brewing and distilling at Heriot-Watt University,
Edinburgh, and will be assisted by two master brewers, Mr Bob Denholm, a
retired head brewer with Scottish Brewers, and Mr Bruce Williams, who
has worked extensively in producing the Heather Ale or Leann Fraoch --
which is made from Scottish heather flowers.
Mr Lynas said traditional brewing methods using an open-flame copper
would be used to produce the Lugton Brewery's own ales.
The brewing process will begin this weekend with the first ale, which
is likely to be called Ayrshire's Pride, expected to be on sale by the
following weekend.
Mr Lynas said: ''It will be a learning curve for us. We hope to
produce several beers as time goes on.
''There hasn't been a brewery of any note in Ayrshire for almost 50
years. Hopefully, this venture will be successful and will help to
encourage other independent publicans to do the same.''
The venture has been commended by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra).
Mr Mick Lee, chairman of its Ayrshire branch, said: ''We would welcome
any new breweries, especially the ones that are challenging the monopoly
of the big operators.''
He pointed out that several breweries had been opened in Scotland in
recent years by smaller, independent operators but said they found it
hard to get their beers into public houses because the great majority of
them were tied to the major brewers.
Mr Lee added: ''Perhaps the way forward for the smaller, independent
brewer is to follow the example of the Lugton Inn by brewing on the
premises.''

A CANINE star of the Fringe was last night back on stage after being
posted missing for two days in Edinburgh.
Six-year-old ''hypno-dog'' Oscar made his bid for freedom during a
walk with owner, Mr Hugh Lennon, on the Meadows on Monday.
He was reunited with the 49-year-old performer after earning a #5000
reward for student Ronan Smith in Craiglockhart.
Mr Smith, 24, was returning home when he spotted the lost dog in the
middle of a busy road. He said: ''I called him over to the pavement. I
was eating a sandwich at the time and he seemed to be more attracted by
the food than anything else, so I gave him half. He just followed me
home.
''I didn't know anything about him. It wasn't until my girlfriend saw
him and said 'I think that's the missing dog' that we realised it was
him and got in touch,'' he said.
Mr Smith will now receive the reward from Premium Pet Foods, a
London-based company which provides a special diet food for the hypnotic
hound. Owners of the Physician and Firkin bar, where the Fringe show is
held, also offered 18 gallons of beer.
Mr Smith said he planned to split the cash with his girlfriend and use
it to pay off student debts. The beer would come in handy for a
celebration party, he added.
Mr Lennon, of Leeds, had cancelled his show after the
labrador-retriever cross, which hypnotises members of the audience, ran
off.
He said: ''He's run off before, but he usually always comes home. I
think he got lost pursuing a female dog in the unfamiliar surroundings
of Edinburgh. I won't be letting him run off again.''
* American comic Steve Martin was in Scotland yesterday for the UK
premiere of his latest movie at the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival.
Martin, who will also be taking part in a special workshop tonight, is
understood to have arrived in Scotland earlier this week and spent
several days holidaying in the Highlands with friends.
Meanwhile, Angelene Ball caused a bit of a stir after disappearing
from the festival.
The 26-year-old Commitments actress was in the capital to promote her
movie Brothers in Trouble and had been booked into a hotel for two
nights. Early on Tuesday, staff called the festival to say she could not
be found, although she was due to check out. All her belongings remained
in her room.
Ms Ball finally called festival staff to say she was in London, had
had a great time, and would be returning to collect her luggage.
* Erotic books have been snapped up by eager readers at the Edinburgh
Book Festival.
A series by Benedict Taschen has proved one of the unexpected hits at
this year's literary showpiece.
With titles such as Erotic Universalis, 1000 Nudes, and Bunny's
Honeys, the books have been selling alongside the work of top authors.
* A challenge to the broadcasting laws is to be made in Scotland with
transmissions from a new unofficial TV station.
The Edinburgh Television Trust claims it has found a legal loophole
which would allow it to go ahead with local transmissions without the
approval of the Independent Television Commission.
The confrontation over official restrictions on local broadcasting
coincides with the launch of the Television Festival today as more than
1000 delegates arrive in Edinburgh.
The ''pirate'' station is due to broadcast to an audience of 20,000
across Edinburgh's New Town from a television studio at Observatory
House on Calton Hill, provided by Edinburgh District Council after cable
company United Artists turned down requests to carry festival coverage
provided by students for the community station.

A FAIRGROUND boss has unveiled plans for a multi-million pound theme
park outside Ayr, his home town.
Mr David Moore has described his project as the Alton Towers of the
North and predicts the #8m park could create up to 300 jobs.
He is to submit a formal planning application to Kyle and Carrick
District Council next month.
It is hoped the park will be built on disused farmland between the A77
bypass and Dalmilling golf course and completed by June 1997.
The park is to be based on a medieval theme, with a log ride,
jousting, and ''Britain's biggest pirate ship ride''. It is also to
feature a 175ft covered roller coaster, a ''tower of terror'', dodgems,
and a ghost train. It will also contain 70 different rides, a picnic
area, a fun pool, and a rare animal breeds farm.
Mr Moore, 25, is the proprietor of Moore's Amusements, parent firm of
the Blackpool-based American Carnival, which travels extensively around
England.
Mr Moore says his Ayr venture is backed by drinks giant Schweppes and
the TSB. He said yesterday: ''This will be Scotland's theme park and Ayr
is the ideal site for it. It won't just benefit Ayr but all the
country.''
Councillor Robin Reid, Kyle and Carrick District Council's planning
committee chairman, said yesterday: ''We look forward to seeing what the
developer has in mind. The application will be given very careful
consideration.''
Iris Howatson, who owns the proposed site at Tilekiln Farm, off
Mainholm Road, Ayr, said: ''This would be good for the area and for the
creation of jobs. It would also mean something for local youngsters as
well as visitors. There's nothing for them to do here. The proposed new
roundabout would slow up the traffic on the A77 and I would strongly
advocate some kind of road-crossing facility.''
However, SSPCA inspector Bill Hainey, 34, whose home would be barely
200 yards from the proposed theme park, said: ''I'm pretty shocked to
hear about this. I don't think any kind of leisure facility is a good
idea when it's next to a road as busy as the A77. I'll be submitting my
objection as soon as the application goes in.''

CELTIC footballer Mike Galloway was still critically ill in hospital
in Leicester last night after being injured in a head-on car crash on
Monday.
The former Scottish international player has not regained
consciousness since the accident, after which he required lengthy
surgery to treat head, leg, and internal injuries, and remains in
intensive care.
Mr Galloway's parents, who travelled from their home in North Berwick
on Tuesday, were at the player's bedside yesterday with his girlfriend,

A SCOTTISH Episcopalian Church minister has admitted there are some
personal links between a group that worships in his church and a group
run by a controversial New Age vicar in Sheffield.
The Sheffield vicar has been suspended over allegations including
sexual and psychological abuse of members of his congregation.
However, the Rev David McCarthy, of St Silas Episcopal Church in
Glasgow's West End, insisted there were no structural links between the
two groups and that the Scottish-based group operated independently of
the Episcopal Church.
He admitted that the ''ecumenical community'' of about 50 people
associated with the Late Late Service had ''personal links of a
friendship kind'' with the controversial Nine O'Clock Service run by the
Rev Chris Brain in Sheffield.
The group has been holding services, beginning at 9pm on Sunday
evenings, since November, 1990, at St Silas and occasionally at
Woodlands Methodist Church, in Glasgow.
Scores of people are said to be receiving counselling after attending
the services in Sheffield run by Mr Brain who is claimed to have wielded
''sinister powers'' over his congregation. It is alleged that more than
20 women have been sexually abused.
It was alleged he fondled and indecently assaulted women during
healing sessions at his home. It is also claimed that many others may be
suffering from psychological abuse and may need months of therapy.
A telephone helpline has been set up by the Sheffield diocese, which
has suspended Mr Brain, who ran the radical New Age church in Sheffield
known as the Nine O'Clock Service.
Yesterday, the priest was at a secret address in the north of England
with his wife Winnie and five-year-old daughter. Church leaders in
Sheffield are understood to be trying to persuade him to undergo a
psychiatric assessment.
The Rev McCarthy spoke to The Herald shortly after the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Dr George Carey, told of his sadness at events. He said he
was praying for alleged victims as calls continued to flood the
telephone helpline set up by the Sheffield diocese for bewildered
churchgoers.
Mr McCarthy explained that the Late Late Service in Glasgow was an
ecumenical group, some of whom were members of local churches but who
worked very closely within ACT -- Action of Churches Together.
Asked about the possibility that similar sinister powers had been
wielded at services in Glasgow as allegedly happened in Sheffield, Mr
McCarthy said: ''Absolutely not. The Late Late Service is run by people
with complete integrity. Under no circumstances would they do that kind
of thing.''
Ms Rachel Ross, 31, a social responsibility officer for the Sheffield
diocese, is one of scores of people receiving counselling after
attending the weekly Nine O'Clock service. She told yesterday of the
''sinister power'' wielded by Mr Brain.
''First he would build people up, telling them they had lots of skills
and gifts. Then he would reject them, causing them to suffer an
incredible sense of loss,'' she said.
''When anyone is rejected they have a desire to become accepted again.
It was at this point people would do what he asked of them.''
The Archbishop of Canterbury, who is holidaying overseas, said he was
''saddened to hear of the disturbing allegations'' and was thinking of
the victims.

A PUBLIC meeting is to be held in Ayr next week as concern mounts
about the future of next year's Burns International Festival.
The meeting has been called by Mr David Roy, the recently appointed
general manager of the Burns National Heritage Park, which includes
Burns's Cottage and Monument and the new Tam O'Shanter Experience, where
the meeting will be held next Tuesday.
While he was playing down talk of a split with the festival company,
Mr Roy made it clear he was determined that Ayr would gain the maximum
benefit from 1996, the bicentenary of the Bard's death.
Mr Roy said: ''This meeting has been called so that people who have an
interest in celebrating the bicentenary can air their views and put
forward any ideas they have for events.''
Meanwhile, Councillor John Dowson, chairman of economic development on
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council, has spelled out the reasons
behind establishing a special fund for the bicentenary year.
The council has set aside #100,000, with the hope that this will be
doubled by EU grant, to assist schemes in Dumfries and Galloway which
directly reflect aspects of the life of Robert Burns and be of a lasting
nature beyond next year.
He confirmed that the grants would be for projects in Dumfries and
Galloway only.
Festival director John Struthers said yesterday that work was
continuing in securing sponsorship for next year's events, and that he
was confident this would be found.

A SCOTTISH travel company chairman last night accused large holiday
companies of short-changing tourists from the east coast of the country
by forcing them to fly from Glasgow rather than Edinburgh Airport.
Mr John Boyle, 43, chairman of Direct Holidays, said about 100,000
people a year were made to bypass Edinburgh Airport in favour of
Glasgow.
Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Boyle accused the big operators of being
devious and putting the operational convenience of their aircraft before
the preferences of clients.
He said people on the east coast would prefer to fly from Edinburgh
but were not given the chance because of the limited holiday service
from the airport.
About 5.5 million people a year use Glasgow airport, 45% of that
figure flying out to international destinations, the rest on domestic
flights. About 3.1 million people flew from Edinburgh during the same
period, with 80% on domestic flights.
Mr Boyle said: ''Here in the capital, despite having an airport which
has consistently invested and improved its facilities, the number of
holiday flights has been reducing year after year.
''It has reached the point that the number of holiday flights has been
reducing to the point where Edinburgh holiday capacity is now a small
hotch-potch of overseas-based airlines flying at odd times, increasingly
in the middle of the week, often at night. Unbelievably, most of the
flights from Edinburgh carry exorbitant supplements.
''The result has been that the Edinburgh and east-coast travellers,
because of contrived cost and inconvenience, have been shoved and
shunted to Glasgow.''
Mr Boyle's comments came as he announced his company would be starting
flights from Edinburgh to 11 holiday destinations including Florida,
Turkey, Spain, Majorca, Greece, Ibiza, and Tenerife. He said they would
be opening a new office in the capital, creating 20 new jobs.
He will also be launching a new #200,000 advertising campaign to
encourage people to fly from Edinburgh. One of his slogans is ''Next
Time You Go On Holiday, Don't Go To Glasgow''.
Mr Boyle was at pains to point out that Glasgow would continue to be
the main departure point for his company and that the new flights from
Edinburgh were an attempt to redress the balance for travellers.
Mr Roland Gunn, deputy manager of Edinburgh Airport, said he was
delighted at the new holiday services and admitted that, up until now,
his airport had been looked on as the poor relation of Glasgow.
A spokeswoman for Scottish Airports Limited, which takes in Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Aberdeen airports, said they were delighted at the move by
Direct Holidays.
* AIR UK has announced they are to increase the frequency of flights
between Edinburgh and London from next month. An extra service will
operate from September 3 from both Edinburgh and Gatwick.
Scottish general sales manager, Mr Alex Donald, said the additional
services would provide more flexibility for business travellers
throughout the week.

THE possibility of bringing charges of manslaughter against diving
company personnel are likely to be considered for the first time next
month as investigations into the death of a North Sea diver continue.
Mr Bradley Westell, 29, of Portlethen, near Aberdeen, died shortly
after midnight on July 31 while involved in cable laying operations from
the diving support vessel Stena Orelia on Shell's Baroque extension, 60
miles off Norfolk.
According to his employers, Coflexip Stena Offshore, Mr Westell, who
was working out of a diving bell, became detached from his life-support
umbilical cable near the Clipper complex.
He had suffered severe injuries, apparently from one of the thrusters
which hang below the mother vessel. His body was found on the surface.
The Health and Safety Executive and Norfolk Police are working on
parallel investigations.
An inquest is expected to be held in the second week of October and
any decision about criminal charges will be made by the Crown
Prosecution Service. Any prosecution under Safety at Work or Diving
Operations at Work legislation will be by the HSE.
The HSE investigation is understood to have centred on how Mr Westell
and the umbilical support cable could have reached one of the Stena
Orelia's thrusters given the industry's diving advice and comprehensive
legislative guidelines.
The Stena Orelia is designed to hold in position without anchors. A
sophisticated computer plotting system also activates and de-activates
the powerful thrusters or propellers which keep the vessel in position.
A memorandum, issued in the 1980s by the then-Department of Energy,
and guidance notes by the Association of Offshore Diving Contractors
(AODC) warned companies to ensure that, when divers were working from
surface vessels, there was no possibility of the diver or his umbilical
reaching a thruster or propeller.
The warnings were prompted by the increased deployment of vessels
using the DP computer systems in the North Sea in the 1980s.
The advice from the AODC, which is customarily accepted by operators,
has been updated since the early 1980s to cover divers working from
bells at shallow depths, such as Mr Westell was doing.
The industry currently advises contractors to ensure umbilicals keep
divers at least 5m from the nearest thruster or propeller.
If this is not possible, then other measures should be taken, the
industry advises.
The support staff on board the mother vessel are responsible for
monitoring currents and for calculating the distance between the diver
and the nearest thruster or propeller.
If the diver is working from a bell with a companion, the diver
remaining in the bell is instructed on how much umbilical to pay out.
Following the death of Mr Westell, the HSE issued Coflexip Stena
Offshore with a ''prohibition notice'' preventing similar operations
from the Stena Orelia until the company could demonstrate an umbilical
management system which ensured divers' safety.
The company complied and diving was able to restart within a few days.
A Norfolk Police spokesman yesterday confirmed they were preparing a
report which would be put before the coroner. The HSE investigations are
continuing.
A spokesman for Coflexip Stena Offshore said there were procedures to
avoid such incidents and the investigation was to discover what had gone
wrong. Coflexip managers could make no comment until the investigation
was complete about what changes, if any, they might require to make, the
spokesman said.

THE dry weather has created a new and unusual attraction in the West
Highlands -- orange sheep.
Tourists are flocking to photograph the sheep grazing beside the A82
Fort William to Inverness road, a popular tourist route in the West
Highlands.
The lack of rain in Lochaber, normally Britain's wettest area, has
meant the prizewinning year-old tups are still covered in orange and
brown dye, which is used to highlight their fleeces at shows and sales
across the country, and which is usually washed out by rainfall within
days.
Mr David Macleod, 54, who owns the 8000-acre Glen Gloy Estate,
Letterfinlay, near Spean Bridge, said: ''They are sticking out like
Belisha beacons at the moment. They are usually back to their normal
colour before we put them in a field by the roadside.''
He added: ''We have noticed the tourists stopping to take pictures.''
Mr Macleod, who lives with wife Kirsty and daughter Kirsty-Anna, 3,
began breeding prize tups six years ago when he bought the estate, which
rises to 2400ft and stretches over a nine-mile area from the River Loy
to Laggan, Inverness-shire.
He has 2050 sheep, and pedigree tups, which can sell for tens of
thousands of pounds for breeding purposes, are a major part of his
business.

THE West Coast main line between London and Scotland will not be sold
this side of the next election as originally intended, the Government
confirmed yesterday, heightening the sense of disarray surrounding the
future of rail privatisation.
Labour called it a severe embarrassment for the Government and blamed
it on delays in arranging the financing for the #1000m modernisation
programme planned for the line's track and signalling.
Potential bidders have told the Department of Transport privately they
are not prepared to invest in the West Coast franchise, the largest of
the 25 passenger franchises up for sale, until the financing question is
resolved.
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising said plans to sell 51% of
British Rail's passenger services by next April remained unchanged,
despite mounting delays. None of the first seven franchises due for sale
last year -- including ScotRail -- has so far been sold.
A spokesman for Opraf said: ''There's no change to the Government's
published targets. We will be reordering the timetable, bringing forward
some of the franchises in the later groups for an earlier sale. An
announcement will be made probably next month when the minimum passenger
service requirements for ScotRail are announced.''
The postponement of the West Coast sale, widely anticipated within the
industry, comes just days after The Herald revealed that ScotRail has
been removed from the list of franchises to be put out to tender next
month because of complications over the future of the Strathclyde
commuter rail network.
The West Coast passenger franchise was never expected to be an easy
sale because its success as a business is inextricably linked to the
state of the line's ageing track and signalling systems, which are in
urgent need of repair.
The fragmentation of British Rail into separate competing businesses
has not eliminated the dependence between those who run passenger
services and those who own, maintain, and operate track and signalling.
The operations of InterCity West Coast, the BR company currently
running passenger services along the line, are hampered by the constant
engineering works required to keep the line open.
InterCity West Coast is the largest of the 25 train operating
companies due for sale. It earned #221m in fare revenue in 1993-94,
making it a potentially attractive investment for the private sector.
However, continued confusion over the Government's billion-pound
refurbishment programme for the line and the role of track-operator
Railtrack has dampened any private sector enthusiasm.
Late last year, the Government asked for expressions of interest.
Yesterday a source said: ''Because of the modernisation, we weren't sure
what the market would think of it. They gave us an indication that this
wasn't the right time.''
Railtrack, which owns the line's infrastructure, has refused to rely
on the Government's Public Finance Initiative -- designed to involve
private finance in public projects -- to raise the money, so as not to
threaten its own planned privatisation.
Last night, Railtrack refused to comment but a Transport spokesman
said: ''It is not true that Railtrack has failed to raise #1 billion --
they haven't even attempted to raise #1 billion.''
In addition to refusing to participate in the PFI, Railtrack has also
demanded a 15-year guarantee of track access charges from the West Coast
franchise in exchange for raising the repair money privately. The
Government wants to privatise Railtrack before the next election.
West Coast main line management last night played down the news. One
source said: ''There's no shock, no horror, no consternation here. It
didn't cause any eyebrows to be raised because of the peculiarities of
the massive infrastructure investment needed. It was always going to be
a long-term franchise.''
Labour transport spokesman Henry McLeish described the Government's
failure to find the money to modernise the line as a disaster for
Scotland.

CRITICS of the proposed financial basis for a Scottish parliament were
accused last night of ''seeing ghosts'' by Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson.
He insisted that there had been no interference from party leader Mr
Tony Blair and no retreat of any kind. There would be tax-raising
powers. The parliament's rights and powers were guaranteed.
''If the conspiracy theorists were right and the party nationally
wanted to retreat, it would have been on the 3p in the pound income tax
power or on proportional representation,'' he said. ''But people are in
a situation here of seeing ghosts where none exist.''
He pointed out that Liberal Democrat partners on the Scottish
Constitutional Convention had no quibbles about the idea of an
''assigned budget''. The criticisms were coming from Tories and
Nationalists hostile to devolution and a ''tiny number'' from within his
own party's ranks.
Mr Robertson had believed that, by reaffirming support for Edinburgh's
power to raise or lower income tax by 3p, Labour would silence doubters
inside and outside the party who questioned Mr Blair's commitment to
home rule.
Instead, he found himself beleaguered yesterday over the assigned
budget proposals.
This scheme, which would guarantee Scottish funding under the existing
Goschen/ Barnett Formula rather than under the original ''assigned
revenue'' proposal, was widely interpreted as a retreat.
That original plan envisaged Scotland being given all income tax and
VAT raised north of the Border, comprising about two-thirds of current
expenditure, and then a regular negotiation to agree the remaining
''top-up''.
The new system would differ in that none of it would have its spending
specified by the Treasury.
The SNP kept up the pressure on the concept, claiming it confirmed the
subordinate status of a devolved assembly. ''If Westminster cut spending
for England, cuts in Scotland would automatically follow,'' said SNP
leader Mr Alex Salmond.
He pointed out that in 1992 the Goschen/Barnett formula was amended,
cutting Scotland's share from 11.76% or UK spending to 10.66%. What had
been done once could be done again, he said, adding: ''Labour's
so-called powerhouse parliament would be nothing more than a Westminster
poodle.''
Mr Robertson said: ''Criticism from Tories and Nationalists is from
people who oppose devolution anyway. Whatever we agree they will attack,
either Michael Forsyth for the powers being too strong or Alex Salmond
saying they are too weak.
''We are not going to be put off by that. There is going to be a
Scottish parliament. Labour's commitment to its powers is firm and
rock-solid.''

THE scourge of Highlanders and holidaymakers alike may finally have a
useful purpose -- if you can believe that midges are able to cure a rare
skin disease.
Mrs Marjorie Matthews, who suffers from scleroderma morphoea, says her
life has been transformed ever since she was attacked by midges during a
holiday in Wales.
For years, Mrs Matthews, 63, suffered from the form of hardening of
the skin which, in severe cases, can affect mobility and be extremely
painful.
Treatment from a Harley Street specialist helped halt the progress of
the disease but much of her body was covered in unsightly and
uncomfortable blemishes.
''I was on a caravanning holiday in Gwynedd when I was really badly
bitten by midges,'' said Mrs Matthews.
''Almost instantly there was a remarkable improvement in my condition.
One by one the blisters started to disappear and the skin returned to
normal.''
Now only a small section of her stomach is affected. Mrs Matthews, of
Rhyl, Clywd, added: ''The swiftness of the recovery really was
remarkable.
''My Harley Street specialist is convinced that the midge venom had an
active part to play and is encouraging further research into it.
''For many, midges might be monsters but for me they have been
marvellous.''
Her specialist was not avaialable for comment yesterday but Dr Frances
Humphreys, a dermatologist at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary, said it was
not impossible that the insect bites could have had a positive effect.
Around 2500 people in the UK currently suffer from scleroderma.
Mrs Pamela Webster, chairman of the Scleroderma Society said: ''Venom
from other insects has been used for a variety of treatment so it may
not be stretching the imagination too much to conclude that midges may
do some good after all.''

GLASGOW MP George Galloway is acting for a group of Asian businessmen
who want to take over Partick Thistle.
Mr Galloway, Labour MP for Hillhead, said yesterday: ''I have been in
discussion with a number of Asians, who have been successful in
business, about the idea of taking a stake in the club. There are
willing buyers and I believe there may also be a willing seller.''
The Asian group is said to include Mr Charan Gill who is involved in
the Ashoka chain of restaurants which includes outlets in Glasgow's
Argyle Street, Clarkston, and East Kilbride.
However, Mr Jim Oliver, chairman of the premier division club, last
night dismissed a radio report that a takeover bid for the club was
imminent as ''cheap, speculative talk''. He insisted that he had every
reason to believe he would be in control of the Firhill club for the
next four years at least.
He said: ''I am in the sixth year of a 10-year plan and we are going
into the next stage very excited at the prospects.''
The BBC Radio Scotland report suggested that a group of Asian
businessmen had approached Mr Oliver, using Mr Galloway as their
go-between, but Mr Oliver said: ''I have not spoken to any Asian group
of businessmen or any other businessmen for that matter. Partick Thistle
is not up for sale.''
However, Mr Oliver acknowledged that every club has a price and if he
received a ''ludicrous'' offer he would have to consider it.
However, he added: ''We have a new young management team, a
redeveloped stadium at Firhill, and now we want to see development on
the field.''

<HEADLINE>Kynoch orders inquiry into water HQ brief</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Office Minister George Kynoch has told his officials to
investigate how the Morrison Group was given the brief for the new North
of Scotland Water Authority headquarters in Inverness weeks before its
competitors.
As The Herald exclusively revealed yesterday, this allowed Morrison
Development Ltd, chaired by Mr Fraser Morrison, who is also chairman of
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, to lodge a planning application on
August 11 which was identical to the brief proposed by the water
authority.
The water authority is chaired by Mr John Robertson, who is also an
HIE board member and chairman of Highland Health Board. Other Highland
competitors did not receive the brief until August 14.
Morrison was the only construction firm promoted by Highlands and
Islands Enterprise. Subsequently, the water authority entered into
discussions with Morrison over a period of months while refusing to meet
other Highland firms to discuss their accommodation needs.
HIE and the North of Scotland Water Authority were told yesterday to
prepare reports on the matter for the Scottish Office.
This followed calls from Labour for the Scottish Office to act. Shadow
Secretary of State George Robertson wrote to Secretary of State Michael
Forsyth yesterday demanding an immediate investigation.
''It is vitally important that tendering for all public contracts is
seen to be fair and open. This is especially so in this case given the
size of the contract,'' he said.
Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said conflict of
interest was inherent in Mr Morrison's chairmanship of HIE and Mr
Robertson's chairmanship of the water authority and his membership of
the HIE board. He called for an inquiry and for the two men to consider
resigning.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP MP for Fife and Kinross, which falls
within the water authority area, said: ''Before they have even properly
dipped their toes into Scotland's water, the new super-quangos have
provided us with proof that all quangoisation means is big business
scratching each other's backs.
''This is the old chums' network in action with consumers' money being
poured down the drain and into private pockets to provide brand-new
offices for an organisation that the Scottish people did not even want
to see coming into existence.
''John Robertson, the quango chairman, has some serious questions to
answer, the least of which is why the quango is turning its snout up at
perfectly good premises already in existence, such as the brand-new
development at Invergowrie, custom built to house Tayside region's water
services department.''
Mr Morrison told a press conference in Inverness yesterday he had no
intention of resigning and stressed: ''It is necessary to point out that
I have at no time approached Mr John Robertson with a view to gaining
competitive advantage in securing this project. Our approaches to the
water authority have been directly from our business development teams
to staff in the new authority.''
However, he went on to state that his company had been given the brief
by the water authority. ''In an effort to secure the project, we
submitted a speculative planning application for offices for the North
of Scotland Water Authority to a specification which was provided by
that organisation in response to approaches from ourselves and others
across Scotland over the last few months . . .
''I would like to stress again that Morrison has pursued this proposal
in a totally proper manner and I have not used personally my position as
chairman of HIE to secure any advantage on behalf of Morrison.''
It is not clear whether Mr Robertson is considering his position. He
could not be contacted yesterday as he is on holiday. A spokesman for
the water authority stressed that Morrison had no advantage in the full
tendering process. He admitted it had been given the brief but so had
two other firms. He refused to name them but they are understood to be
based in Aberdeen and Dundee.
''They were given the specification so that they could produce some
indicative figures for costings. But a line has now been drawn under
that and the normal tendering process will now proceed. There will be no
continuum with Morrisons, who will be competing on an equal basis with
those other companies tendering.''
HIE chief executive Iain Robertson, who faced the press alongside Mr
Morrison yesterday, refused to accept that his agency had exposed its
own chairman to charges of conflict of interest by promoting Morrison
alone among Highland building firms.
''We get inward investment inquiries and we have hundreds to deal with
at one time, each different, but there are certain principles to follow.
We get an idea what a company wants and we put together an indicative
package. At the time the query came from the water authority, there was
no-one else with an office with outline planning permission in
Inverness.''
As a result, HIE had put together an illustrative bid for the water
authority HQ stressing HIE offices in Alness and the Morrison site as
one that would have had advantages.
Mr Ewan Dow, the SNP leader of Tayside Regional Council, yesterday
called for an urgent meeting with Mr John Robertson.
Mr Dow told The Herald last night: ''We didn't even know the water
board was going to decide on August 8 where to locate the HQ. Now they
have decided on Inverness, I suppose we must accept it but we certainly
want to know what criteria were employed, particularly in light of The
Herald's revelations.''

THE Queen has chosen to take a scheduled service flight to New Zealand
for the Commonwealth Conference in the autumn. The Queen normally
charters airliners for her official trips but in October she and the
Duke of Edinburgh will travel to and from Auckland on an Air New Zealand
jumbo jet.
Final details of the trip are still being worked out but it is thought
the Queen and the royal party will take over the upstairs section of the
Boeing 747 aircraft, which would normally be occupied by first class and
business class passengers. Tickets in economy class will be available
for the flights with the Queen.
The tickets will cost about #292,000. The cost of chartering a jumbo
jet would have been about #687,000. The Queen will attend the opening of
the Commonwealth Conference in Auckland and will fly back to Britain for
Remembrance Day services over the weekend of November 11 and 12.
The cost of the flight for the royal party will be met by the New
Zealand Government. It is the custom that the country hosting the
Commonwealth Conference pays the bill.

A BANK manager who stole almost #64,000 from the account of an elderly
woman was jailed for one year yesterday despite a plea for leniency
because, since committing the offence, he has suffered permanent brain
damage as a result of an assault.
Jim Harper, 40, appeared for sentence at Aberdeen Sheriff Court,
having previously admitted the offence, which he committed while office
manager of the Clydesdale Bank's Mastrick branch in Aberdeen.
The money was taken from the account of an elderly woman, over which
he had control, and transferred into what was nominally a business
account in his wife's name.
Depute-fiscal Alastair Carmichael said that Harper's wife, from whom
he was separated, was unaware of the transactions.
The offences came to light when the elderly victim of the theft died
and her estate was being wound up. The transfers were made possible
because of the position of trust Harper held at that time. The money was
not recovered.
Appearing for Harper, of The Spittal, Aberdeen, Mr Bill McVicar told
Sheriff Alexander Jessop that the money, taken between April 1992 and
June 1993, had been spent by the accused.
He added that Harper was supporting two homes at the time.
He said the beneficiaries of the dead woman had not suffered as the
Clydesdale Bank had made good the losses.
Mr McVicar said Harper considered his actions unforgiveable but
appealed for leniency in the circumstances of the case, which were that
since commmitting the offence, Harper had suffered injuries which were
''devastating'' and had left him ''a shadow of his former self''.
He said that, given the severity of the offence, it would normally be
preposterous to seek a community service order but, in the
circumstances, a custodial service would not serve the public any
better.
He had suffered a brain injury which was described as ''extremely
severe'' in medical terms, which was the worst category. He was
receiving outpatient treatment and would do so indefinitely.
The prognosis was he would not recover from the injury, although it
was hoped he would be assisted by a rehabilitation scheme to take some
form of useful employment.
He said Harper had suffered a very significant punishment and appealed
to the sheriff to leave him at liberty but to impose the maximum
community service order.
However, Sheriff Jessop said he had read the reports of the
neuro-psychologist and art therapist treating Harper, and also examined
the social inquiry report.
Having weighed the reports and the evidence, he felt he would be
failing in his public duty if he did not impose a custodial sentence for
such a gross breach of trust, and imprisoned Harper for 12 months.
Harper had appeared to be a pillar of society until the offences came
to light. He was married with three children, including a severely
handicapped son, who is now six.
He had split from his wife and was living with a man in the city, when
he was the victim of a severe beating at the end of 1994, which caused
his brain injury. No-one was prosecuted as a result of the assault.

<HEADLINE>Lord Wakeham bids to pull the shutters down over Prince William's schooldays. Behind closed doors at Eton</HEADLINE>

THE chairman of the Press Complaints Commission was last night accused
of acting as a public relations officer for the royal family.
The accusation was made after Lord Wakeham had warned journalists not
to treat Prince William as a soap star or football hero when he goes to
Eton on September 6.
The Queen gave her immediate blessing to the initiative. Buckingham
Palace described it as ''timely''.
While palace officials last night declined to name those family
members that were adding their weight to the statement, the Prince and
Princess of Wales might have had some say.
Lord Wakeham's remarks outraged the royal press corps. They
immediately demanded to know whether there had been any evidence of
serious intrusion into the privacy of Prince William at his two previous
schools.
Neither Lord Wakeham nor Buckingham Palace could produce a case.
Nevertheless, Lord Wakeham insisted that Prince William's years at
Eton would be the test to prove that the press had grown up and was able
to regulate itself.
He said a story involving Prince Charles during his school years at
Gordonstoun would be outlawed under existing rules.
In 1963, Prince Charles, then a schoolboy, popped into the Crown Hotel
at Stornoway Harbour and ordered a cherry brandy. It was paid for by his
personal detective, even though the prince was then well under the legal
drinking age.
The incident made headlines but Lord Wakeham yesterday said drinking
under the legal age limit was not a serious crime. If Prince William was
involved in something similar, it should not be reported, he ruled.
This was immediately condemned by Mr Jake Ecclestone, assistant
general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, who accused Lord
Wakeham of acting as a public relations oficer for the royal family.
He said of the statement: ''I think it is an extraordinarily foolish
and hypocritical piece of work by Lord Wakeham.''
Editors confirmed that they had no intention of intruding into the
privacy of Prince William at Eton and expresed surprise at Lord
Wakeham's address.
All agreed that the prince should be allowed the same freedom as that
of any other schoolboy. However, they did express concern over the
seemingly new restrictions being placed on them.
Mr George McKechnie, editor of The Herald said: ''The industry will
play close attention to Lord Wakeham's statement.
''It is important we pay regard to the code of conduct and I see no
reason why we cannot properly cover the royal family, including the
development of Prince William.''
He said he was sure that Lord Wakeham did not intend to imply that
members of the royal family were entitled to greater privacy than anyone
else.
Nevertheless, Mr McKechnie, who served as a member of the Press
Complaints Commission for two and a half years until December, added:
''While I respect Lord Wakeham's views, I cannot agree with him over the
cherry brandy incident. If the heir to the throne, while under age,
enjoys a naughty drink in a Stornoway hotel, then some of us might argue
this is in the public interest and should be reported.''
Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers which publishes
the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, and London's Evening Standard, said: ''I
have no doubt that every paper will be able to fulfil its obligations of
royal coverage without breaking the code. I very much hope that this
will be the case.''
Sir David sits with Lord Wakeham on the PCC and is chairman of the
Editors' Code Committee.
Mr Stuart Higgins, editor of the Sun, said: ''We have no intention of
publishing any story or photographs which would be harmful to Prince
William during his years at Eton.''
But he added: ''There is enormous interest among Sun readers about
Prince William and we will report certain events and milestones in his
education without any detrimental effect to the Prince.''
Mr Piers Morgan, editor of the News of the World, said he took the
royals' concern for Prince William's education ''very seriously'' and
did not want to publish anything that would adversely affect him at
school.
Lord Wakeham told the press that Prince William was little different
from any other schoolboy -- except one day he would be king.
However, Prince William was not an institution, nor a soap star, nor a
football hero.
''He is a child. In the next few years -- perhaps the most important
and sometimes painful of his life -- he will grow up and become a man.
''Prince William is entitled to the same protection from media
intrusion as any other child,'' said Lord Wakeham.
He should be allowed to run, walk, study, and play at Eton -- free
from the prying cameras.
''He must be allowed to make mistakes and learn the way we all did --
without our constantly reading of his successes and failures in the
columns of our newspapers.''
Lord Wakeham added:''This is an opportunity -- on an issue of
importance to public and Parliament -- for the newspaper industry to
show it really has grown up.''
