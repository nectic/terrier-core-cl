CHICAGO: Japanese scientists reported that traditional Chinese
medicines such as horse chestnuts, angelica, or camellia seeds seem to
give the capacity to drink without becoming drunk. The medicines appear
to have the ability to grab alcohol and route it through the digestive
system before it can be absorbed into the bloodstream, experts say after
testing the effect on rats.

WILLIE Carson reached 100 winners for the twenty-third season in the
last 25 when he partnered Muktabas to victory yesterday at Nottingham.
Fittingly, the winner carried the colours of his retaining owner,
Hamdan al Maktoum, when scoring by threequarters-of-a-length in the
'Childrens Day' Conditions Stakes.
The 52-year-old was cheered into the winner's enclosure and was
presented with a bottle of champagne to mark his achievement.
Carson failed to hit a century in 1984 when he missed part of the
season after a heavy fall in Milan and he registered only 87 successes
last year.
But the Scot, at present fourth in the jockeys' table, has reached
three figures consistently otherwise since he first achieved the feat in
1971.
He has no immediate plans for retirement, particularly with Alhaarth
currentlyclear favourite to clinch him a fifth Derby triumph next June.

With Famagusta
CLOUDS of dust billow up around your feet as you cross the bare,
parched patch of land outside the Antonis Papadopoulous Stadium. It
would be completely featureless were it not for the wrecked cars which
have been abandoned there.
It is to be hoped the European dreams of Rangers are not to be added
to the pile of broken things come tomorrow night.
Already the Ibrox side's supporters are gathering -- approximately
1000 are to make the trip to Cyprus where their number is expected to
swell to 2500 when joined by fans serving in the British Army stationed
here and also Scottish tourists -- and just for a moment it seemed as
though Paul Gascoigne had arrived in Larnaca ahead of his team-mates for
the conclusion of Rangers' European Cup preliminary-round tie against
the Cypriot champions, Anorthosis Famagusta.
Perhaps Gascoigne was so anxious about the return leg that he had come
to familiarise himself with the humble ground, but on closer inspection
the figure turned out to be one of those ridiculous look-alikes with the
cropped, bleached hair. This one was wearing a T-shirt, across which was
emblazoned the declaration: ''I'm back'' above a photograph of the one
and only Gazza.
The groundsmen looked bewildered by the creature in their midst who
was casually strolling across the pitch, which will do Gascoigne and the
rest of Walter Smith's team no favours. The surface is baked and solid
and is far from smooth, which means there will be an element of chance
when long passes are played.
It is a tight pitch with basic concrete structures and scaffolding and
rickety wooden grandstands. They will house 13,000 supporters tomorrow
night when, thankfully, the temperature will have dropped from 38[DEG]
to 25.
Anorthosis played a Croatian team in a UEFA Cup tie here two years ago
when the game kicked off at 2pm and with the sun still high. The
Cypriots scored six times against opponents who could barely stand at
the end, but the heat should not be too much of a factor this time,
which is just as well because Rangers might need to concentrate hard
when they arrive at the ground.
''When the game starts and everyone is in the ground this can be a
very noisy, passionate place,'' said club spokesman Lakis Avraamides.
''These fans are committed and they believe they are coming to see
Anorthosis win the biggest match they have played in.''
The stadium, built seven years ago mostly by volunteer, refugee
labour, sits in the Kokkines area of Larnaca, which was set aside for
those who fled the Turkish soldiers in 1974, and before and during the
game it will be patrolled by the Cypriot police and also the military
police from the British Army bases.
''We do not, however, expect trouble,'' said Avraamides, who was
caught up in frantic telephone calls to the electricity authorities. The
power supply had been cut off for some reason and preparatory work in
the stadium had ground to a halt.
''Don't worry. It will be different tomorrow and it will be alive when
the game starts,'' he added.
Unimpressed, Gascoigne's double was gone before Georgi Vassilev
brought his players out for a late afternoon training session -- just as
well since Ilian Kiriakove might have tackled the wrong Gazza, although
the Bulgarian said: ''I am not sure if the coach wants me to do follow
Gascoigne again. He may want me to be more creative, I don't know yet.''
Dimitris Assiotis, who missed the game at Ibrox because of injury, is
fit and has taken full part in the build-up work, and he might win back
his place from Panikos Poynas, who supported Kiriakov in taking care of
Gascoigne. Vassilev will later reveal which of these defenders will
start. Yesterday he was concentrating on his attack.
''I was pleased with the way we played at Ibrox, but I would have
liked Sinima Gogic and Nikolai Todorov to have made more of the chances
we created,'' he said. ''But we know we can make chances against Rangers
and I'm sure we will have scoring opportunities again.''
Gogic, who is one of the highest-paid players in Cypriot football,
although his #4000 a month is paltry compared to what Rangers' players
earn, is regarded as the star of the team, and the supporters are
convinced he will not let them down.
''This is such a big game for all of us and we know we have a chance
to do something that a Cypriot club could never have contemplated only a
few years ago,'' Gogic said. ''To beat Rangers and play in the
Champions' League would be a huge triumph.''
The 32-year-old knows he should have scored on a couple of occasions
at Ibrox, but he shrugged and added: ''There are always other chances
for strikers. Wednesday perhaps.''

With Rangers
THE worst weekend fears of Rangers manager Walter Smith were realised
yesterday morning when Brian Laudrup failed a fitness test at Ibrox and
was left behind when the team departed for Cyprus.
Now the Scottish champions must face Anorthosis Famagusta without the
man who was their most influential player last season, a player who
could have been looked on as a potential match winner in Cyprus.
''We wanted to see how Brian was this morning before travelling,''
said Smith. ''There has been very little improvement to his injury and
there's no point in having him with us.
''It's much better for him to stay at home, avoid a five-hour flight,
and receive treatment to the ankle at home.''
It was a blow Rangers had feared since Laudrup was injured in training
for Denmark before his country's European Championship clash in Armenia
last week.
And it was the kind of injury problem which forces Gordon Durie into a
situation where he may have to go through the pain barrier to help the
Ibrox club in their European Champions' League bid.
It is not a prospect that Durie welcomes, and not one he would always
accept. But to help his club overcome Famagusta, Durie will do so if the
club medical staff believe it necessary.
He said so yesterday as Rangers jetted to the torrid sunshine of
Cyprus.
Durie pointed out: ''This game is so important for all of us that I
will take an injection if the manager and the doctor say I should do so.
It isn't something I would always want to do. But this game is so vital
for everyone connected with the club.
''We know that we let ourselves and the supporters down last season
when we were expected to defeat AEK. We don't want a repeat of that
now.''
Durie's goal gave Rangers their 1-0 victory at Ibrox in the first leg.
It remains the goal which can carry the Scottish champions into the
next, lucrative stage of the tournament.
Rangers desperately want to be in the Champions' League next month and
Durie insists: ''People have been acting as if we had lost the first
match. But we didn't. We won 1-0 and it was always more important that
we did not lose a goal to them at Ibrox.
''There is a lot of pressure on clubs in the preliminary games. I
believe it is easier to play in the Champions' League itself. Getting
there is the hardest thing.''
Rangers, of course, go into this game with several injury worries --
hence the probable need for playing Durie even if an injection is
required.
The player says: ''I am running okay, and I have been working in the
gym, so general fitness is not a problem. I just have this pain in my
left foot from a knock I had in the first leg. But I'll be ready for
this one.''
That decision will be made closer to the match along with similar
decisions over Alan McLaren and Stuart McCall.
Manager Smith is likely to give them as much time as possible to be
ready.
Laudrup is a major loss as Durie agrees. ''All of us hoped that Brian
would be ready because he is a player who could have won the matches for
us,'' said Durie.
''However, we still have quality players available to come in. The
gaffer has been buying class players to provide cover in situations like
this. In the game itself I think they will come at us in the first 20
minutes. If we survive that opening burst, then we can frustrate them
and we will find gaps for ourselves.
''I don't think any of us doubt that we have the players who can score
away from home in Europe. We have done that in the past. This is a bit
of a tightrope for them because if we score, they must know their
chances are over.''
It is that away goal which haunts the Cypriot champions.
The man who marked Paul Gascoigne at Ibrox, Bulgarian World Cup player
Ilian Kiriakov, admits as much. ''Just one goal, only for the Scots
would end our dreams,'' says the 28-year-old. ''We would then need to
score three times and that would be very, very difficult. Probably
impossible.''
Kiriakov, however, is ready to battle with Gascoigne in the midfield
once more, in a role with which he is unfamiliar.
He shrugs: ''It was a job the coach asked me to do. Normally I play
full back but he wanted Gascoigne man marked, and told me to do it. I
think I won the battle in Glasgow and I want to repeat that this time.
''Gascoigne is one of the biggest names in Europe but I believe I can
mark him as effectively this time as I did before.
''Our only problem is if we concede a goal. Rangers know that too.
That is why Smith's strategy for the game will call for an organised,
disciplined defence, but with players who will look for the breakaways
that are always available to any team playing away from home in a
European competition.
''The strikers who are here will recognise that need. They will also
recognise that the increased competition at the club means they must be
ready to do something special, particularly here.''
Grins Durie: ''We all know that the competition up front is very
difficult. Mark and Ally are still there, still scoring. I want to be
involved and now the gaffer has brought Oleg Salenko. We cannot afford
to let our standards slip, otherwise we will be out. But that is only
good for the club.''
How good it is we may find out in Larnaca tomorrow night.

PLANS for the formation of an association to represent the interests
of Scotland's 70 national league rugby sides are at an advanced stage,
and a meeting of all interested clubs will be staged in Perth next week.
The new association, to be called the Scottish Rugby Clubs'
Association, will perform virtually the same functions as the
three-year-old Premier League Clubs' Association which represents 25 of
the 32 clubs in the Tennents Premiership -- the seven Border League
clubs still declining to become involved.
The fact that many clubs feel the need for an organisation which is
devoted to their interests reflects feelings expressed at the Scottish
Rugby Union annual general meeting in June that the SRU was becoming
remote from the clubs.
At that meeting, retiring president Ken Smith declared that there was
no need for additional organisations to represent the clubs, and that
the SRU's district apparatus was the forum through which concerns within
the clubs could be expressed.
That view was underlined yesterday by SRU chief executive Bill Hogg,
who said: ''We don't see that there is any requirement for additional
associations but neither do we see a problem with it if that is what the
clubs want. The premier league clubs already have their association and,
by that token, there is no reason why the national league sides
shouldn't have one as well.''
All national league sides now have received a letter from Linlithgow
RFC president Ian Gibson inviting them to attend an exploratory meeting
at Perthshire RFC club on August 30.
Among the other clubs involved in the formation of the new
organisation are Cartha Queen's Park, Leith, Forrester FP,
Hillhead-Jordanhill, Annan, Allan Glen's, and Livingston.
The new Scottish Rugby Clubs' Association is envisaged as a national
organisation with threeregional components -- Lothian and Borders, North
and Midlands, and West.
''There is a general feeling that the new league structure will create
a club elite and the other clubs, who often provide the players for
them, want to be listened to as well,'' said Gibson.
''The meeting has been called for next week and if nobody turns up
then the concept won't happen but, if it does, then I don't see it as
being a rival to the SRU. We would be very much a self-help group.

* STAN Collymore, Britain's most expensive player, limped out of his
second competitive match for Liverpool at Leeds last night, a game in
which Leeds won 1-0 thanks to a great goal from Tony Yeboah after 51
minutes.
The #8.5m striker, signed from Nottingham Forest, hobbled off with a
sore ankle after just 20 minutes of the Premiership match, after having
taken heavy challenges from defenders John Pemberton and Tony Dorigo.

RAITH Rovers were today recovering from a catalogue of disasters which
has disrupted preparations for tonight's UEFA Cup tie with Gotu
Itrottarfelag.
First, the club was forced to change airlines -- and endure an 11-hour
delay -- for their flight to the Faroes, as the original company did not
have a pilot who was qualified to land on the island.
Then bad weather around the Faroes delayed the departure even further.
The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that the club also
faced a hefty fine from UEFA, as competition rules demand that they are
in the host country 24 hours before kick-off.
The first problem cropped up at lunchtime on Friday, when Titan
Airlines faxed the club to say that they had been denied landing
permission at Vagar Airport because their pilot didn't hold a special
licence qualifying him to touchdown at the cliff-top airfield.
The Coca-Cola Cup holders, who kick off against GI in the second leg
of their preliminary round tie at 6.30 this evening, quickly fixed up a
flight with another airline -- but it wasn't due to leave Edinburgh
until eight o'clock last night.
Worse followed when the airline called Stark's Park at lunchtime
yesterday to report that, because of heavy fog around the Faroes, the
plane wouldn't leave until 11.55 -- and wasn't expected to touch down at
Vagar until 2.30.
But there was some good news for Rovers when a spokesman for UEFA
revealed that they would not be punished for their late arrival. He
said: ''This matter has been discussed by the committee and it has been
decided not to fine Raith Rovers.
''This is because the club contacted us very quickly to let us know
about the difficulties they were having. We recognise the Faroes is a
very difficult and awkward place to get to.
''We also know that there will be no further problems and are happy
with the new travel arrangements.
''It is fair to say their prompt action in reporting the matter has
helped them escape any financial punishment.''
Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl said: ''When I discovered we wouldn't
arrive until the day of the game I thought we would be thrown out.
''My first move was to phone Andy Roxburgh at UEFA and he spoke to
match secretary Rene Eberle, who said not to worry because they had had
problems with the Faroes before.''

SUCH is the determination of Roy Aitken to restore the fortunes of
Aberdeen that he could threaten the place of Scott Booth who had scored
twice in his return from injury after an eight-month absence.
Booth, who sustained that injury while scoring in the draw against
Russia which sustained hopes of a place in the European Championship
finals, had, not unnaturally, hoped his feat might attract the attention
of Craig Brown.
Instead, his Pittodrie manager warned: ''Strikers are there to score
goals. That's what I expect of them. I'm delighted Booth and Billy Dodds
got among the goals in our first game. But I'll have Duncan Shearer
available after Saturday and he will be breathing down their necks. It
is healthy to have such competition in attack and this is what I want in
every department.
''Booth is a proven goalscorer who has the capabilities to do well in
the international arena.
''If he gets it right with Aberdeen then obviously he will bring
himself to Craig Brown's notice and get into contention with Scotland.
But he's got to produce his best form consistently.''
Aitken is committed to ensuring there will be no repeat of last season
when the Pittodrie club required a play-off to save their premier place.
He has promised that players must maintain their standards or they will
be axed from his plans.
However, he was full of praise for the the competitive debut of
teenage defender Craig Ireland and promised: ''There are first-team
places waiting for any youngster who convinces me he is worthy of a
call-up. Ireland is a hungry, willing lad with a lot still to learn. But
he has the desire to do well and that is what I'm looking for.''
Injured defenders Gary Smith and Colin Woodthorpe re-started training
yesterday and should be ready for Falkirk on Saturday.

'We can't play any worse than we did that night. In fact, I think we
will do an awful lot better this time.' DOUGIE ARNOTT
MOTHERWELL'S Tristar trek to Finland as they try boldly to do what no
Scots team has done before was surprisingly upbeat despite the 3-1
deficit they face from the first leg of their UEFA Cup preliminary round
tie.
No team from Scotland has ever recovered from defeat at home in the
first leg of a European tie and it is long odds against the Fir Park
side being pioneers in this department.
However, at least the squad who flew to Helsinki then made the 75-mile
road journey to their base in Kouvola were in positive, albeit
realistic, mood. The feeling that an aggregate victory is too much to
expect is tacitly conceited but the belief that some Scottish pride can
be retrieved is unanimously held.
After that, the most used phrase is: ''Who knows?''
Unfortunately, the answer probably is ''everybody'' but such cynicism
is not likely to encourage the kind of ambition that lurks in Motherwell
breasts.
Manager Alex McLeish's view that MyPA-47 will have to play badly to
allow his own team any serious chance of going into the first round is
as honest an appraisal as you could expect in the circumstances. His
players would like to think that they could become unique by achieving
what seems well nigh impossible but a win of any sort is perhaps the
only target worth contemplating.
Even that may be very difficult against a team that looked, at the
least, competent at Fir Park.
Certainly, the presence of Dougie Arnott, who was under suspension for
the first leg, will lend a different dimension to the Scottish team's
attack. His darting, annoying energy could test the composure of the
Finnish defence.
Arnott suffered in the stand, along with the rest of us a fortnight
ago and can scarcely wait to put his boots on. He, too, was brutally
honest.
''One thing is for sure,'' he said. ''We can't play any worse than we
did that night. In fact, I think we will do an awful lot better this
time.
''For some reason we played a long ball game all night and that is
just not us. We will be doing it differently tomorrow.
''Our big hope is that they will take it easy, thinking the job is
done, and if we get an early goal, who knows?
''Realistically, we lost the tie at Fir Park but we will have a real
go here and take it from there.''
McLeish would go along with that view. But what he wants as much as
anything is to see his team as they can be.
He was upset that they allowed the ever present impatience of Scottish
fans to get to them in the first leg.
''I know how the fans felt and if I had been one of them I would have
been snarling, too,'' he said. ''But players have to handle that and
stick to the game plan, I want to see us passing the ball as we can. If
we do that I believe, as I have from the start, that we can win here.
But the Finns are an above-average side and are full of confidence.''
That was borne out by their manager, Harri Kampman, and defender Sami
Hyypia, both of whom said the usual diplomatic bits but clearly are
utterly convinced their team will go through.
''We have no injury problems and are in good form, after winning 3-0
on Saturday,'' said the manager.
For Hyypia the chance to stake his claim for a place in the Finnish
team against Scotland next month is his incentive to do well tonight.
The under-21 defender, who also has six full caps to his name,
believes that if he subdues such as Tommy Coyne again he would do his
prospects a lot of good, especially as the places in the Finnish side
are open following the nation's 6-0 defeat by Russia.

DUNDEE United manager Billy Kirkwood yesterday refused to comment on
the weekend incident at Cowdenbeath which is likely to land him in
trouble with the Scottish Football Association.
Kirkwood was involved in a row with rival manager Tom Steven at the
end of United's 4-0 Coca-Cola Cup win.
Later, Steven gave his version of the incident, revealing that it had
been sparked by a challenge by United's Billy McKinlay on one of his
players.
Kirkwood would not discuss the incident, although it is understood he
is angry at having become involved.
The SFA still have to receive their report from match referee Tom
Brown and the supervisor who was present but it seems certain that both
Kirkwood and Steven will be called to explain their actions.
Meanwhile, although Dundee manager Jim Duffy was delighted with Neil
McCann's four-goal show in the victory over East Stirlingshire, he
wasn't happy to read reports saying that the under-21 internationalist
still was a Celtic target.
Duffy said: ''These reports have been going on for more than a year.
The fact is that Celtic made a general inquiry and that is all that has
happened as far as we are concerned.
''But we have had formal bids for the player from other clubs.
''For instance, everyone knows we have turned down two offers from
Luton Town.
''Based on that, it would be more appropriate to describe him as a
Luton target.
''This could get more ridiculous. Would people still describe him as a
Celtic target if he happened to sign for Liverpool?''
One man staying at Dens, at least for the time being, is midfield
player Morten Wieghorst, who has renewed a one-month contract with the
club.
Defender Dusan Vrto could accept a fresh one-month deal when he meets
Duffy this morning.
Dundee will play their third-round Coca-Cola Cup tie against
Kilmarnock next Wednesday night at Dens Park.
United will meet Motherwell at Tannadice 24 hours earlier.

FEELINGS could run high tonight as Lanarkshire rivals Airdrie and
Hamilton clash in their opening tie in the Scottish League Challenge
Cup.
Hamilton are still upset by a transfer tribunal decision last week
that awarded them only #135,000 for striker Peter Duffield, who moved
under freedom of contract.
But manager Iain Munro will emphasise to his players that this should
not concern them and that their job is to win on the pitch.
Airdrie are intent on retaining the trophy they won last year when the
tournament was known as the B and Q Cup.
Assistant manager John McVeigh said yesterday: ''We do not intend to
give up our hold on the trophy lightly. We know the benefits of a good
run in this competition, for, last season, we got a spin-off in our
league form.''
Sean Sweeney, a recent buy from Clydebank, will make his debut and
Kenny Black returns after suspension.
Stirling Albion manager Kevin Drinkell knows what it feels like to be
a winner of this tournament as a player and he wants to repeat that
feeling.
Drinkell, as he looked forward to the tie against Queen's Park, said:
''I won a medal when I was a player at Falkirk and would like to repeat
that now as a manager.
The former Ranger could make a couple of changes from the side which
beat Hamilton on Saturday and points out: ''We have a busy programme and
it is important to keep everyone involved.''
Charlie Nicholas will make his home debut for Clyde as they face first
division St Johnstone.
Recent signing Charlie McLean, Steve Florence, and keeper Gordon Dunn
will be included by Arbroath as they visit Clydebank, who will freshen
the side after their penalty kick shoot-out defeat against Motherwell on
Saturday with striker Craig Flannigan in line for a return after injury.
East Stirling manager Billy Little will make a late team selection to
the side who lost six goals to Dundee on Saturday when they face St
Mirren, who again will be without Norrie McWhirter.

SCOTTISH COCA-COLA CUP
CELTIC have switched their Coca-Cola Cup third-round tie against Raith
Rovers at Parkhead to Thursday, August 31.
The match, a repeat of last season's final, is being moved because
there are no games the following Saturday due to Scotland's crucial
European Championship clash with Finland at Hampden on September 6.
A spokesman for the Parkhead club explained that the Scottish League
had given them a choice of playing either on the Tuesday or Thursday.
They opted for the latter date to give players more time to prepare
for the match, which will kick off at 7.45.
Rangers, meanwhile, will play their tie against Stirling Albion the
previous day at Ibrox with a 7.45 kick-off, as will the Falkirk v
Aberdeen encounter. Other ties that night are scheduled for 7.30.
The matches between Dundee United and Motherwell, and Airdrie and
Hibernian both will take place on Tuesday, August 29, at 7.30.
* THE Andrei Kanchelskis transfer saga could finally end this week,
with Everton confident they will eventually get their #5m man.
The Russian international winger has been forced to train alone after
the collapse of his move from Manchester United following the demand for
a #1.1m cut of the fee from his Ukrainian former club, Shaktyor Donetsk.
Kanchelskis is not allowed to train with his would-be Goodison
team-mates while he has refused to return to Old Trafford.
But Everton director Cliff Finch said that behind-the-scenes moves
aimed at salvaging the deal were still proceeding.
''I cannot do any more than I am doing to get that player in a blue
shirt,'' said Finch.
''United have acquiesced in so much as allowing Andrei to train, but
not with us, so he is working on his own at the moment.''
Everton have already asked the Football Association to arbitrate in
the dispute, and FA spokesman Mike Parry said that United had responded.
''We wrote to United last week to inform them that the arbitration
process was underway and we have now had their response,'' he said.
''They acknowledged our letter and said that we would be hearing from
them very shortly.''
Parry added: ''United have already agreed that they will not negotiate
with any other club over the sale of Kanchelskis until the situation
with Everton is resolved.''

ROWING:
UNPERTURBED by a delay to his opening race caused by a technical
problem on the boat of his Cypriot opponent, Peter Haining, Scotland's
world lightweight sculling champion, started the second defence of his
title here in Tampere, Finland, with a comfortable victory, booking a
place in Thursday's semi-finals, despite a sustained challenge from
Thomas Kacovsky of the Czech Republic.
Joining him in the semi-finals is Ireland's Niall O'Toole, last year's
silver medalist, who looks like being Haining's main threat.
This race marked Haining's competitive return to the single this year.
It was the first time he had raced over the championship distance of two
kilometres since his world title win in Indianapolis last year, and was
just the confidence booster he needed. The semi-final will be the first
real test for him here.
Altogether, four of the 13 British boats racing yesterday qualified
for semi-finals, while the lightweight eight, with Scottish
internationalists Jim McNiven and Ben Helm aboard, went straight to
their final, thanks to an impressive victory over Germany and Argentina.
The day started with an exhibition performance by the reigning Olympic
and world champion coxless pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent
who raced at something like full power till the halfway mark, only to
cut back from then on to paddle home in control of their race. Now more
than before they look simply unbeatable here.
All other Scottish internationalists racing yesterday must depend on
tomorrow's repechages. They include Carl MacLannan (second in men's
coxed fours), Gillian Lindsay and Kate Templeton (last in women's
fours), and Kareen Marwick (along with Phillippa Cross (last in women's
pairs).
Also dependent on repechages are Britain's women's eight, with former
Edinburgh University captain Dot Blackie aboard. The three remaining
British boats -- men's eight, lightweight four and lightweight double
scull -- start today.

BOXING
PRESSURE could be mounting on promoter Don King to thrust Mike Tyson
in with WBA champion Bruce Seldon sooner rather than later. After
Saturday's 89-second fiasco against Irish-American Peter McNeeley at the
MGM Grand, blasted by TV stations across America, the paying public will
want vastly better value for money when Tyson climbs through the ropes
for phase two of his comeback campaign on November 4.
Buster Mathis Jr has signed to fight Tyson on that date, says his
promoter Cedric Kushner, but Tyson's co-manager John Horne has insisted
Mathis was only a ''consideration''. Mathis will probably be seen as
more cannon fodder for the former undisputed world heavyweight champion,
and MGM moguls will hardly want to host another McNeeley-type farce.
MGM will be competing with the Caesars Palace attraction of the
Riddick Bowe-Evander Holyfield third fight, which is due to take place
on the same night just a mile away down The Strip -- unless boxing
business commonsense prevails and one of the heavyweight attractions is
switched.
Seldon could now fit conveniently into the Tyson picture for November
4, or on the next scheduled slot of March 16, and pay-per-view
financiers Showtime will want something several leagues better to beam
nationwide for a #30 fee. Promoted by King and unscathed after his
clinical 10-round demolition of native American Indian Joe Hipp on the
Tyson card, Seldon would be ready -- and definitely willing -- to set
himself up for life by going in against Iron Mike. Seldon boxed Hipp as
if he was holding something back in reserve.
Meanwhile, McNeeley's manager Vinny Vecchione awaits his hearing
before the Nevada State Athletic Commission for the hotly-controversial
ring intrusion which rescued and disqualified McNeeley. The commission
have withheld Vecchione's #119,000 share of McNeeley's purse pending the
inquiry -- cash which Vecchione planned to use to buy his mother's house
from his three brothers.

HOCKEY
SCOTLAND contrived only a 1-1 draw against France in the Nissan
European Nations Men's Hockey Cup in Dublin yesterday in the penultimate
round of group matches.
In the first half Scotland played their best hockey of the tournament
and by the break could have established a winning lead.
David Leiper converted their first corner in 10 minutes and this
appeared to boost their confidence even although Ledovic Tissier forced
the equaliser when he hit the target from France's first setpiece.
In between, Richard Freeland squandered a great opportunity by not
releasing the ball to Gordon Shepherd when the pair were in a two-to-one
situation with the French goalkeeper. Then Shepherd failed to put the
final touch to a well-worked routine and Michael Starling hit a post
from a penalty after Freeland had been fouled while shooting for goal.
Scotland's play deteriorated in the second half. In the end France
outscored Scotland 10-9 on shots at goal but Scotland had the advantage
on the corner count 8-6.
This point keeps Scotland in fifth place, a group ahead of France. If
they can retain this position after today's contest with Spain they
would have the easier opening classification match in the play-off for
places nine to 12 at the weekend. Results:
Group A -- Scotland 1, France 1; Holland 3, Wales 0; Spain 2, Belgium
2. Group B -- Germany 7, Switzerland 0.

SAILING:
DAVID Harte, the former Irish coach, maintained a slender lead on the
second day of the second leg of the Teacher's Round Britain Challenge as
light breezes and strong tides continued to make progress intermittent
en route from Cardiff to Rothesay.
Harte, skipper of Dream of Erin, had a lead of just one mile yesterday
as the wind faded once more and the fleet compressed, many taking to
anchor in a strong tide.
''We've been stopped in more than 40 metres of water and have had to
tie everything together but the kitchen sink to cope with the depth of
water,'' said England's David Alan-Williams, who skippers Jackson's
Landing Spirit of Hartlepool, lying second.
Scotland's Jon Fitzgerald and Chris Nichol were sailing conservatively
in third place in Glendronach, secure in the knowlege that so far they
have been one of the quicker boats in the 10-strong five-nations fleet
when the wind blows.
An end to the 10 days of doldrums is believed to be in sight.

GOLF: RYDER CUP
BERNARD Gallacher will wait until the last moment before deciding
whether he wants Jose Maria Olazabal in his Ryder Cup team next month.
Olazabal has been troubled all season by a foot injury and indicated
from America last week that he might ask to be left out of the match.
That was before he finished joint sixth in the Sprint International in
Colorado yesterday and Gallacher, Europe's captain, wants to see the
outcome of this week's Volvo German Open, the last qualifying event,
before making up his mind. Olazabal, Nick Faldo, and Ian Woosnam are
outside the top 10 who automatically gain selection.
Of the three only Woosnam, No.13 in the table, plays in Stuttgart --
Olazabal and Faldo are at the World Series in Ohio -- but even if the
players above him all miss the halfway cut the Welshman would still have
to finish in the top five.
Gallacher said: ''Jose Maria might not be able to play every match in
the cup, but I do have to consider his relationship with Seve
Ballesteros. They have been wonderfully successful together. It will
come down to whether Jose Maria and I think that he will be hindering
the team if he was there.''
Gallacher knows only five of his side -- Colin Montgomerie, Bernhard
Langer, Sam Torrance, Costantino Rocca, and Ballesteros. For the
remaining five automatic spots there are 19 in contention.
David Gilford and Howard Clark, runner-up in the Czech Open yesterday
after bogeying two of the last three holes, look almost home and dry at
sixth and seventh in the table.
But Mark James, Per-Ulrik Johansson, and Philip Walton -- eight, nine
and 10 -- are separated by less than #2500 and Spaniard Miguel Angel
Jimenez is right on their heels.
Nick Faldo is guaranteed a wild card. If it comes down to Woosnam or
Olazabal for the other, Europe will be seen as having shot themselves in
the foot by changing from three to two wild cards.

TOM Hanlon, so impoverished by paying medical bills that he had to
borrow money to represent Great Britain last night, made a dramatic
winning return against the USA -- in a match sponsored, ironically, by
BUPA.
The forgotten man of UK athletics, racing on the track for the first
time since the European Championship final 53 weeks ago in Helsinki,
Edinburgh's Hanlon won the 3000 metres steeplechase in 8min 24.37sec,
helping Britain win the men's match at Gateshead by 203 points to 182.
Though 10 yards off the pace with two laps remaining, Hanlon clawed
his way back relentlessly, then surged into the final water jump, going
on to win by 12 metres.
Behind him were two Britons -- Keith Cullen and Spencer Duval -- and
an American. All had competed earlier this month at the World
Championships in Sweden.
Hanlon applauded the crowd on his lap of honour, showing real delight
at his successful return. ''But it wasn't that good,'' he confided.
''After all, these guys are tired. I am pretty rusty, and my head is not
up to scratch.
''I've had my problems physically -- my back, and an Achilles tendon.
I have spent a fortune on medical fees. It is #23 every time I go to the
osteopath to get myself sorted out, and I would go twice a week if I
could afford it. But I can't. I'm skint.''
Hanlon's right calf muscle is clearly much more wasted than the left,
but he is convinced his physical problems are over. ''Financially
though, I'm pretty hard up. I borrowed money to come here. The British
Athletics Federation is prepared to pay just #100 in physiotherapy
bills. That's gone in no time, and the form-filling and medical
referrals before getting the money takes ages.
''Your condition is chronic before you are treated. There is supposed
to be a system, but it is pointless if you can't get help, especially
treatment needed to prevent injuries. You can only get the money once it
is too late.''
Peter Fleming, the Scottish marathon internationalist who quit
Scotland for the USA yesterday, cited similar reasons for his departure.
Hanlon, however, makes no such threats. This was his third
international win for Britain -- one against the supposedly invincible
Kenyans, and the other two against the USA, both at Meadowbank.
The 28-year-old Scottish record-holder is just praying for an
injury-free winter, consistent training, and the chance to attune his
mind for a serious Olympic bid next year.
Yvonne Murray stayed on her feet for an encouraging win in the 3000m,
though in a modest 8-59.80. ''No scars this time,'' she smiled, perhaps
for the first time since her 10,000m fall in Gothenburg. The
Commonwealth champion broke clear with more than 600m to go and won by
nearly five seconds.
The field included three-times world cross-country champion, Lynn
Jennings, who was second. But the USA team overall, though containing 35
of their world squad, had not one of their nine individual gold
medal-winners.
It was seven-and-half hours after the meeting began that America's
only individual world medal winner appeared -- Jearl Myles -- to run a
relay leg. Even then the depleted US women won their match easily,
210[1/2]-156[1/2].
Murray, having done all that was asked of her on her return, admitted:
''I needed to get back with that win, and throw off my fall. You can't
dwell on it. I could have acepted a bad performance -- but I didn't even
give a performance.''
She will decide today whether to run the Brussels grand prix on
Friday. ''I'll see how my legs are -- but I will definitely run the
3000m in London next Sunday,'' she added.
David Strang almost made it a hat trick of Scottish wins. The
Govan-born European indoor 1500m champion took the lead at the bell in
the 800m, but had victory snatched from his grasp on the line. Rich
Kenah, his US training partner, lunged past close to home, winning in
1:46.52. Strang, who races again at Crystal Palace next weekend, was
second in 1:46.68.
Melanie Neef, having switched from her preferred 400m at the team
management's request, to the 200m, was frustrated by the calmest night
the normally wind-assailed Tyneside track fans can remember.
Neef, warming up for a 400m run in Copenhagen tomorrow, then the
Berlin grand prix next week, clocked 23.42, finishing fourth, seven
hundredths outside her best. Then she watched the 400m won in a time
which, had she matched it, would have broken the Scottish record.
Edinburgh's Lorna Jackson reached 52.86m, for fifth in the women's
javelin, and Blackpool-based 22-year-old Anglo, Vikki Lawrence, though
sixth in the 800m, clocked 2:04.77, fastest by a Scot this year.
The inspirational impact of world triple jump record-breaker Jon
Edwards was in evidence even before the local hero showed his face in
his home stadium, to tumultuous applause. But a tired Edwards managed
only one legal jump, 17.49 metres -- good enough to win, well short of
his world best of 18.29 -- though it would have been a personal best for
him before this season.
Others took a leaf from his book, however. US-born Ashia Hansen twice
broke the UK and Commonwealth record in the women's triple jump, first
with 14.57m, and then reaching 14.66m in the final round.
It was the third time this week, and the ninth this season indoors and
out, that she had improved the women's record. ''I feed off Jonathan's
jumping,'' she said.
Steve Backley took the javelin with 83.00m and Jamie Baulch set a
Welsh record with 45.15 in the 400m, but John Regis needed the
disqualification of US rival Anthuan Maybank to take the 200m in 20.63.
Colin Jackson made a winning hurdles return, in 13.18, then revealed
he would be having two operations under the same anaesthetic at the end
of the season -- on a cartilage and tonsils simultaneously.

RARELY, if ever, have two young amateur golfers, Gordon Sherry and
Janice Moodie, had such an impact on Scotland's national psyche.
If they weren't household names before the summer, they are now
following 21-year-old Sherry's barnstorming campaigns in the Scottish
Open at Carnoustie, where he was fourth, and the Open at St Andrews --
which included outscoring former champions Greg Norman and Tom Watson
over the 36 holes he was in their company -- and 22-year-old Moodie's
feat in finishing top Scot, seventh overall, in the women's Scottish
Open at Dalmahoy.
The meeting, at Moodie's home club of Windyhill, was at the behest of
the Bank of Scotland, who, as part of their tercentenary activities, had
granted sports awards to both under an elite scheme run by the Scottish
Sports Aid Foundation. They are described as ''potential high-fliers,''
but patently they already are stars of today, and if they are becoming
role models for Scotland's extreme golfing youth, then parents have
little to worry about.
Moodie is studying psychology and business at San Jose State
University in California, where she won a golf scholarship, and is
waiting until she graduates in 1997 before having a tilt at the American
LPGA Tour.
Improvisation, however, is required and her lifestyle is almost one of
''have books will travel.'' This week she returns to university for all
of a week, to register for classes and collect the required reading
material, before jetting off again to Australia to represent Great
Britain and Ireland in the Commonwealth tournament at Royal Sydney Golf
Club, a pattern which will be repeated regularly during the collegiate
golfng season.
Sherry has almost completed his BSc degree at Stirling University,
where he also is on a golf scholarship. The Kilmarnock Barassie player
has 13 of the 15 units he needs and expects to have the remainder by the
time he turns professional after playing in the US Masters next April,
having been invited there as Amateur champion. Finding the hours to
combine studying and golf has been hard, but he is in no doubt the
effort, which will have to be made for a few more months, has been
worthwhile.
Following his campaign in the Canadian Amateur championship at
Toronto, where he reached the semi-finals last week, he will play in the
North of Scotland Open at Royal Dornoch this weekend in preparation for
the Walker Cup at Porthcawl, Wales, on September 9 and 10. This will be
followed by the home internationals at Royal Portrush, the European Club
Cup in Portugal, a trip to South Africa in spring, and a spell at
Valderrama prior to Augusta. One of his first pro tournaments may be
Jack Nicklaus's Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village, Ohio, in May.
For two golfers who have evolved separately, their careers have
similarities. Sherry has great faith in coach Bob Torrance, with whom he
has worked since 1991, while Moodie has stuck with Cawder's Ken Stevely,
her mentor since she was 15. Both believe in the principle of one coach
only. Now they have made their breakthrough among the world's top
players at the same time, achievements which both believe have given
them higher confidence levels.
There are still differences, not just the obvious one. Sherry is 6ft
8ins and 18st while Moodie is 5ft 9ins and just under 10st. In the
''what might have been'' stakes, Sherry would have won around #40,000
for the Scottish Open and Open had he been a pro, while Moodie's cheque
would have been only #2500.
Yet the expenses are still the same. Sherry came to the global total
of #10,000 for 1994 and more this year, while Moodie reckoned she was
not far short. So such awards -- #2000 to Sherry and #2500 to Moodie --
from the Bank of Scotland, who have pledged #70,000 to elite and
grassroots schemes over a three-year period to various sports is an
important contribution.
Sherry, whose handicap is plus 3, and Moodie, who plays off plus 5,
were meeting each other for only the second time, having bumped into
each other briefly three years ago. With both playing almost exclusively
in scratch events, their plus handicaps are effectively badges of
honour.

PARBUSTERS
IT might well come as a relief to all those sharpshooters that there
is no outright bandit-of-the-season now that the dust has settled from
the 16 qualifying weeks of Parbusters and the finalists are declared for
the seventh annual final at Haggs Castle on October 4, writes Douglas
Lowe.
The lowest net score was only minus 13, compiled by five players,
three men and two women. Only? Well, previously they have been as low as
minus 18 and this season has been the tamest so far, though the
qualifying cut-offs have been remarkably consistent over the seven
years.
Scratch scores, however, are going down. Minus 4 in the past has been
good enough for the men as has plus one for the women. Not now though.
Ballots were required on minus 5 for men and level for women, and
similarly on minus 11 for men's handicap. Strictly, there also should
have been a ballot on minus 11 in women's handicap, but as there were 11
players on that score or better, it seemed harsh for one to be denied.
However, an alternate will be invited from among the minus 10s only if
there are two call-offs. Alternates will be contacted in the other
sections as and when places are available. The qualifiers are:
HANDICAP
Men: -13 -- I Pettigrew, Troon Welbeck (22); J Connell, Rothesay (24);
I McFarlane, Easter Moffat (27). -12 -- W Adair, Prestwick St Nicholas

Level -- (after ballot 1 out of 9) L Robertson, Ranfurly Castle.
Note: scores based on CSS for men, SSS for women; handicaps given are
those at the time score was submitted.
* IN the Parbusters final a competition also will be held for match
secretaries as a gesture of thanks to those who send in returns. The
draw for the eight places resulted:
Men -- Ranfurly Castle, Falkirk Tryst, Colville Park, Glenbervie.
Women -- Crieff, Craigie Hill, Cowglen, Milngave.

THERE can come a point in the lives of elderly people, struggling to
cope with the mental and physical stresses of running a home too large
for current needs, when it all becomes too much.
For growing numbers the answer has been found in the purchase of a
sheltered or retirement home, specifically built to cater for the needs
of the older generation.
The two descriptions, sheltered and retirement, are somewhat confusing
since they are basically one and the same thing -- namely flats or
bungalows -- which are offered for sale with a number of services.
In these days, when many people retire early, ''retirement''
accommodation is increasingly directed towards this younger and more
able group.
However, for those who require the reassurance and safety net of a
resident or non-resident warden, or an emergency call system, sheltered
accommodation with features such as grab handles in bathrooms, perhaps
electric sockets placed more conveniently higher on the wall, and
possibly communal facilities such as a lounge, guest flat or laundry,
can be ideal.
Age Concern Scotland's factsheet two covers the subject in great
detail and is well worth getting, by sending a SAE to them at 113 Rose
Street, Edinburgh EH2 3DT.
As Age Concern points out, prospective purchasers need to ask
themselves many questions including:
* will the housing you are considering meet your needs now and in the
future?
* what sort of further care options might be available if necessary in
the time ahead -- or would you have to leave the development?
And on costs:
* can you afford (a), the capital cost; and (b) the ongoing (and
consistently rising) service charges which will be levied?
What sort of control will you have over your initial investment, and
the annual costs in the future? What are the obligations involved in
living in a communal setting? What options are at your disposal should
you feel that the management isn't meeting all its obligations? And can
an unsatisfactory management be removed?
The National House Builders Council (Scotland) is the guardian of the
quality of private housebuilding north of the Border. It has produced a
draft Code of Practice which covers new private sheltered and retirement
housing in Scotland. The NHBC keeps a membership register of those
builders who follow the set standard of construction, and therefore have
a Buildmark warranty.
The code also lays down guidelines for the management of private
sheltered and retirement housing. It had been hoped that builders
wishing to continue to use the NHBC Buildmark for sheltered or
retirement developments would have to comply with this section too, but
sadly it appears likely that the sellers of the property may be able to
pick and choose the parts of the ode that they wish to adopt.
It is advisable when considering buying a new home in this area of the
market place, that you send for a copy of the draft code of practice
from NHBC (Scotland) at 5 Manor Place, Edinburgh EH3 7DH.
Compare it with what is contained in the purchaser's information pack
which you will get from the organisation selling the flats or houses.
This, along with Age Concern (Scotland) factsheet, will offer valuable
guidelines along which your thinking should run.

LONELINESS and isolation in old age can be hard to overcome. At home,
alone, without the companionship of others and with little to enliven
the week, life can be sad and empty.
And for those who are fortunate enough to have family or friends to
care for them on a full-time basis, the carers themselves have a great
need also, to get the occasional break, secure in the knowledge that
their charge is being looked after.
Since 1948, Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association has done a
sterling job, running a large number of clubs throughout the city,
mainly in church halls, schools or community centres. Today these number
around 130, and along with other projects run by the association, mean
that the Old People's Welfare Association is in touch with between
10,000 and 12,000 elderly people in a year.
''In addition to our clubs which normally meet on a weekly basis, we
have two purpose-built day centres, one on the south side of Glasgow and
one recently opened in Yoker,'' says Jock Stevenson, the association's
director.
''These bring in people who have carers at home, and therefore
relieves him or her, in addition to giving all sorts of activities for
the elderly to take part in during the day. Lunch is also available at
the day centres.''
One worthwhile project initiated by the association is neighbourhood
visiting. It recruits volunteers via paid coordinators, to visit elderly
people within a small geographic area to see they are alright, and give
advice. Coordinators have community flats, which serve as drop-in
centres for pensioners in the area.

THE management buy-out of the JH Dewhurst butchers' shop chain from
receivership, announced yesterday, has saved 13 Alex Munro outlets on
this side of the Border.
Property group Asda Property Holdings has linked up with the
management team, which is led by joint Dewhurst managing directors Roger
Reeson and Eugene Lines.
Asda Property has purchased the freehold premises occupied by
Dewhurst, the largest chain of its type in Britain, and will lease them
back to the new MBO company, Dewhurst Butchers.
No financial details of the buy-out, or the purchase and lease-back of
the freeholds, were revealed.
Asda Property's involvement secured the future of about 80 of the
200-plus outlets which will be operated by the MBO firm under the
Dewhurst, Baxters, Matthews, Cobb of Knightsbridge and Alex Munro names.
In Scotland Dewhurst trades exclusively as Alex Munro. The number of
Munro outlets has declined in recent years, in line with the chain
nationally. The 13 remaining employ about 50 people.
Mr Reeson said Munro was a significant part of the deal and believed
it might ultimately be possible to increase the number of shops north of
the Border.
He added: ''We are proud to retain a very strong hold in Scotland with
Alex Munro, and we look forward to driving the business forward.''
Mr Lines expressed the company's view that there was an exciting
future for specialist High Street retailers.
The deal, announced by receiver Ernst &amp; Young, will safeguard about
1000 jobs throughout the UK. However, about 150 jobs will go as a final
wave of 35 shops not included in the transaction are closed.
Dewhurst and its parent company Union International, owned by the
Vestey family, went into receivership on March 22.
Union subsidiary British Beef, which has abattoirs and meat-processing
plants at Preston, Wakefield and Peterborough, was sold on March 31 to
Irish company Kepak (UK) for an undisclosed sum.
Terry Robinson was brought in from Lonrho in 1992 to revive the
family-dominated business headed by Edmund Vestey. By 1993, the number
of Dewhurst outlets had been cut from 1100 to 400.
Dewhurst owned 360 shops, employing about 1800 people, when it went
into receivership with debts of about #35m.
The buy-out transaction was led, structured and negotiated by Foreign
&amp; Colonial Ventures. NatWest Markets (acquisition finance) provided the
bank funding and the management team was advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand's
corporate finance arm.

ABEL Eastern, the Scottish supplier of Asian nan bread to supermarkets
throughout the UK, is rising from the ashes of a factory fire as a new
company backed by venture capitalist 3i.
3i is providing the lion's share of a #10m financing package to launch
Abel Eastern International, but Mike Pacitti, the negotiator involved,
declined to say how much.
This new company will take over the business of Abel Eastern Foods,
which went into liquidation after a fire at its Livingston factory on
June 30. Managed by husband-and-wife team Shazia and Wazir Gallam, it
aims to start production at a brand new site in Cumbernauld at the end
of September.
The Gallams founded Abel Eastern Foods in Livingston in 1988 and built
it into a thriving business employing 280 people.
The firm sold #15m worth of nan bread and other Asian food produce a
year to supermarket chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury.
But its factory was destroyed by a fire on June 30 only hours after
insurance cover had run out, sending it into receivership. The Gallams
are suing an insurance broker, who they claim was responsible for this
oversight.
Meanwhile, they have lost no time in starting up a successor company
with a #10m package of equity, loans, grants and leasing finance.
Scottish Enterprise and accountancy firm Rutherford Manson Dowds are
helping launch Abel Eastern International, as well as 3i.
The Gallams hope many of their former employees in Livingston will
work at the new Cumbernauld plant, which is only 25 miles away.
''It's a blow that we couldn't start again in Livingston, but
Cumbernauld was the only place which offered the right facilities,''
said Mrs Gallam, who is managing director of the new firm. Her husband
Wazir is sales director.
Abel Eastern International will move in to a brand new factory shell
supplied by Scottish Enterprise at the Orchardton Woods development in
Cumbernauld. This offers plenty of space for future expansion.
Initially, the new firm will recruit about 100 employees who will
start producing nan bread as soon as the necessary machinery is
delivered in September.
Abel Eastern International plans to double this workforce by March and
achieve an annual turnover of #18m within three years. It has received
assurances from many former clients of Abel Eastern Foods that they will
buy nan bread from the new company.

MANAGEMENT at the HarperCollins book printing operation is understood
to be still hopeful of concluding a sale of the closure threatened plant
by the end of next month.
A circular distributed to staff has confirmed that negotiations are
continuing with two potential investors.
Morale among the 470 employees at the loss-making plant at
Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow, is said to be at an ''all-time low'' given
the uncertainty that has surrounded the operation since The Herald
revealed last November that a search was underway to find a buyer.
The London-based merchant bank Robert Fleming has been working with
senior management to secure a buyer and has contacted about 40 potential
purchasers who might take over the plant as a going concern.
Of the 40, 28 requested a summarised information memorandum on the
business, and 11 of those asked for detailed information.
However, staff have seen the expiry of several sale deadlines come and
go with no firm news of a buyer.
In his latest brief statement to staff, Eddie Bell, HarperCollins'
executive chairman, apologised for the uncertainty during what he
recognised had been a ''prolonged'' and ''difficult'' period.
While he could give no guarantee that any deal would be concluded, he
said negotiations were continuing with two potential investors with a
view to saving as many of the jobs in manufacturing as possible.
He was hopeful the matter could be concluded ''one way or the other''
by the end of next month.
HarperCollins said yesterday that Mr Bell was on holiday and no-one
else was available to comment in his absence.
A management source dismissed reports that the loss of more than 400
jobs at the plant was now inevitable and said the company was ''fairly
optimistic'' a sale could still be achieved.
He said: ''One never sets a deadline when you are in this position.
These matters progress very slowly. The time of events is not in the
hands of the vendor but is dictated by the purchaser. I am sure that
something will be sorted out as suggested in the letter.''
The source declined to reveal the identity of the two potential buyers
although he said it was ''extremely unlikely'' they would include a
management-buy-out team. He also ruled out interest from the Far East.
Gareth Ward, editor of Printing World, the UK's leading printing
magazine, said the identity of the potential buyers remained a mystery
among industry sources, although the giant German publishing giant
Bertelsmann had been touted.
This assertion constrasts somewhat with a fax received by the Herald
in June from Dr Horst Benzing of Bertelsmann, which stated that it had
''no interest'' in purchasing ''either parts of HarperCollins or the
company in total''.
Mr Ward added: ''As I understand it little interest has been shown by
UK-based publishing firms.'' On a slightly more optimistic note, he
added: ''The fact that the manufacturing plant is still operating,
despite several apparent sale deadlines passing, perhaps indicates that
a buyer of some description is lined up in the next few weeks.''
It is understood that any deal could involve up to 100 permanent
redundancies at the plant, which is said to be losing #4m a year.
The deal would also involve the remaining employees being made
redundant and re-employed under fresh terms and conditions set by a new
employer, a move the Graphical, Paper and Media Union may oppose.
David Munro, Scottish branch secretary of the GPMU, said he had
requested a meeting at the ''earliest opportunity'' with Mr Bell to
discuss the contents of the staff circular.
He said the union was quite happy that the company was still trading
and that it had done nothing to break any agreements.
However, he suggested that it was not satisfactory that staff were
merely being given a stay of execution each time a deadline passed and
added: ''This will have to come to a head some way.''
Last November Mr Bell warned of the possibility of closure at the
Westerhill plant if a buyer was not found.
He said a sale would not affect 700 other workers employed at
Bishopbriggs in distribution, finance and administration, although some
employees have privately expressed fears that any sale of the
manufacturing operation could put the entire Westerhill complex at risk.
A sale would bring to an end Collins's 175-year link with book
manufacturing in Glasgow. The company was bought for #400m by Rupert
Murdoch in January 1989 after a bitter takeover battle.
Although it is associated with several best-selling authors,
management has conceded it has failed to attract enough business for the
manufacturing side, which can produce about 60 million volumes a year,
because other publishers regard it as a competitor.

MICE chairman Mike Curley may soon be able to offer shareholders an
unusual perk -- free admission to the Nubian Museum in Aswan where the
exhibition design company has a three-year #7m contract to present
Egyptian artefacts at their most compelling.
The work is about one-third completed and accounted for a fair
proportion of half-time turnover, which rose 8% to #5.83m. It employs
160 people, which is more than the rest of the group put together.
The full Museum Interiors, Conferences and Exhibitions contract is due
for completion in two years. Then the results will be appraised by
developing countries such as those in Central and South American as well
as in the Far East, which have history and culture to sell via the
tourist industry.
Shorter term, Mice's prospects look good. It also has a #1m contract
to design a display lasting for just four days for the Sony Play Centre,
as well as the Foreign Office input into the World Trade Fair in Lisbon
and the subsequent one in Berlin.
Mice is, therefore, looking for German acquisitions and it seems
almost certain one will be achieved over the next couple of months.
There is net cash of nearly #1m in hand at the Bank of Scotland and a
total of #3m available for deals.
For the immediate future, it has also designed the Scottish and
Frankfurt Motor Shows.
Against the trend, its in-store display activities have performed
well. New customers include Wedgwood in the foreign tourist oriented
retailers.
At the half-way stage, there was a swing round from losses of #99,000
into #85,000 profit, and the City now expects an increase in the
full-year total from #450,000 to at least #750,000. There is a maiden
interim dividend of 0.032p, with a 0.096p total forecast for a 3% yield
with the shares at 4p.
Those looking for a penny stock with potential -- it was floated at 3p
last December -- may like to take a punt. Unfortunately, they will have
to find their own way up the Nile.

A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD mare won the supreme championship at the 24th annual
Dumfries and Galloway Horse Show held at Wheatcroft Farm, Castle
Douglas.
John Smith from Speddoch, Isle of Whithorn, was showing for the first
time at South-west Scotland's biggest horse show. His Camford Yvonne,
which was sired by Millisle Footprint, was Clydesdale champion before
being judged the best horse on the showfield.
She was female champion at Wigtown earlier this month, and Mr Smith
said he was delighted with the result. ''I was pleased when she was
picked out as Clydesdale champion, but it was tremendous to win the
champion-of-champions award, especially on my first time at the show,''
he said.
It was a successful day for Helen Mair from Holywood, Dumfries, and
seven-year-old Just Kylie who won the JL Taylor Cup for small hunters
and then took the President and Vice-President's Trophy for the hunter
championship.
The Copeland family from The Piggery, Motehill, Glenluce, had a highly
successful day with three winners. Ruth-Mary Copeland, aged eight, and
Luce Bay Gentleman James won the John Hunt Memorial Trophy for the first
ridden pony, and she also collected the Brown Trophy for the leading
rein pony on Springs Minuet. Her sister, Angela, won the Corrielaw
Trophy for any age in-hand Arab with four-year-old Craigwell Starlight
Express, who has clocked up nine championship wins.
Anne Howard of Castle Douglas was showing her four-year-old registered
Dales Wath Freestep Teddy for the first time, and together they won the
Barncrosh Cup for the best registered pony in the mountain and moorland
classes.
Well-known Palomino exhibitor Tommy Thorburn from Eastriggs took the
championship once again and also won the McMaster Trophy for in-hand
ponies with his yearling Woodhall Trena.
Trophy winners were:
Honeyman Trophy for ridden hunters -- Pat Baird, West Linkins, Gelson
and Ben Tudor; JL Taylor Trophy for small hunters and President and
Vice-President's Cup for hunters -- Helen Mair, Holywood, Dumfries and
Just Kylie; Kirkland Trophy -- Mary Moore, Dinwoodie Green Farm,
Johnstone Bridge and Poetic Promise; Trophy for best rider 12 and under

THE Government is preparing to meet substantial claims from sheep
farmers who, in the light of an English High Court ruling, have been
wrongly refused sheep quota from the national reserve.
Quota allocation is the key to claiming sheep annual premium payments,
which are currently worth #21 per breeding ewe.
The English High Court ruling means the criterion laid down by the
Government -- that ''developers'' had to show documentary evidence of a
plan for increasing their flock -- have been declared unlawful.
With the easing of this criterion more producers will qualify for
quota and may claim they have suffered loss as a result of being
rejected when they made their initial application in 1993. The total
amount of quota remains unaltered, however, so the Scottish Office
Agriculture Department and the Ministry of Agriculture south of the
Border face difficult decisons on how to re-dress the balance.
The 1993 allocation has to be revised so those who can now claim they
should have received an allocation from the national reserve will
receive either quota or compensation.
Indications are that the Scottish Office is unlikely to recall all
categories of quota allocation and redistribute them according to the
new rules. While spreading the pain over a wide area, this would require
EC legislation.
A preferred option could be to confine the revised allocation to what
is known as category three -- which covers people who had declared an
intention of increasing the size of their flock, those who took over
land from which quota had been removed by a departing tenant, and new
entrants who were seeking a quota allocation for the first time in 1993.
Some 300 sheep farmers currently receive their quota, totalling about
30,000 units, under arrangements for ''developers''. A further 400 were
rejected in 1993.
Although the current problems arise from the rulings of an English
Court, the Government has made clear that it will operate on a UK basis.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland has indicated, however, that it
may seek recourse to the Scottish courts if it feels the rights of quota
holders here are being usurped in the implementation of the English
ruling.
In a briefing note to NFUS members, chief executive Tom Brady said:
''We have told the Government that it is their responsibility to get
whatever quota may be needed to sort out the mess they have made. If it
means going to Brussels for more quota, or obtaining authority to open
an outgoers scheme, that is what they should do.''
Civil servants and NFUS officials have been involved in detailed
discussions on the quota problem and Scottish Office Agriculture
Minister the Earl of Lindsay has said he hopes to find a solution
acceptable to both sides.
Meanwhile, existing national reserve quota holders have been told to
submit their 1996 claims for sheep annual premium as usual. These will
be paid subject to the normal requirements. ''They need not consider
purchasing or leasing additional quota as a precaution,'' Lord Lindsay
said.

<TEXT>
SUPERMARKET group Asda has concluded its agreement to buy out its
joint venture partner British Aerospace from their Burwood House retail
property company.
It will pay #88m cash and take over Burwood's #265m debt, giving a
total funding requirement of #353m.
Both parties welcomed the deal, which gives Asda control of 34 of its
own stores -- and four shopping centres -- and helps British Aerospace
exit from an ill-fated flirtation with property development that started
six years ago.
The acquisition would be broadly neutral for earnings in the current
financial year.
Rent paid from Asda stores located on properties owned by Burwood was
enough to pay for all the interest charges on Burwood's total debt.
BAe finance director Richard Lapthorne said the sale was the last
significant step in BAe's strategy to focus property interests in
Arlington Securities.
Burwood achieved a consolidated profit before tax of #430,000 for
1994.

<HEADLINE>NIESR predicts #5000m income tax cut in Budget</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRIS STONE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>27</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976764968</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IN its economic forecasts in the August quarterly review, the
independent National Institute of Economic and Social Research assumes
that income tax cuts costing some #5000m in revenue will be announced in
the coming Budget.
It also suggests, in contrast to the May review when it advocated a
rise in base rates to 8% by the end of this year, that interest rates
will be held at their present level throughout this year and next.
This change of assumption reflects both the indications of slower
output growth and also a change in emphasis in the statement of policy
objectives by the Government, although not by the Bank of England.
The NIESR itself believes that if taxes were to be cut in the Budget
it would be appropriate to raise interest rates at about the same time.
This, it says, would improve the odds on a reduction in inflation while
reassuring financial markets that the Government is not simply guided by
considerations of political popularity.
The tax measures could be designed to help the construction sector in
particular, since a further rise in interest rates might otherwise hit
too hard.
The other obvious option is to do nothing since the state of the
economy remains quite satisfactory after a very good year in 1994, an
option the NIESR favours, although it accepts that between now and
November new information will no doubt become available which could
point to a different conclusion.
Its forecasts, as stated, are based on tax cuts and no increase in
interest rates. This involves a risk to the strict interpretation of
inflation objectives. Given the very public differences of view between
the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor that risk is a
serious one to contemplate.
''It is nevertheless a risk which we think that the Chancellor, for
essentially political reasons, may well decide to take,'' says the
review.
The NIESR is now forecasting that inflation will rise later this year,
but that it will then slow down again and will be around 2.5% at the end
of next year with interest rates unchanged from current levels.
The latest Treasury forecast is inflation of 2.5% at the end of 1996,
though it does not say whether it believes interest rates need to be
raised to achieve this.

<TEXT>
Tokyo, Monday -- International credit rating agency Moody's issued a
harsh assessment of the health of Japan's banking industry today, rating
the financial strength of many of the country's banks as no better than
adequate.
Moody's Investors Service for the first time assigned ''financial
strength'' ratings to 50 leading Japanese banks, which were hit hard by
the collapse of Japan's ''bubble'' economy of inflated land and asset
prices in the early 1990s.
Most of the banks were rated between the lowest possible grade 'E',
meaning very weak intrinsic financial strength, and 'D', or adequate
strength. Only one bank, Shizuoka Bank, was rated 'B' or in strong
financial health.
''The 'E' ratings on the banks were due to a lack of profits and their
bad loans, based on a comparison with the financial system worldwide,''
said Masaru Kakutani, a director at Moody's office in Tokyo.
Japanese authorities estimate bad loans in Japan's financial system
total some 40 trillion yen ($412bn), and private analysts say the real
figure could be much larger.
The ratings were considerably worse than Moody's assessments of the
banks' bonds, issued previously. Unlike the bond ratings, the financial
strength measure does not include the possibility of aid to the banks
from Japan's financial authorities.
Most internationally operating banks have their own set of standards
and ways to assess other banks, which have already been applied, the
analysts said.
But the Moody's assessment could have a negative impact in the long
term by making it harder for the weak banks to trade derivative
financial instruments with foreign banks or by creating liquidity
problems at banks' overseas branches, economists said.
A Bank of Japan (BoJ) official said that the central bank would keep
careful watch on the liquidity of Japanese banks' overseas branches --
although he stressed that he was not referring directly to Moody's.
The official said that the central bank was prepared to provide help
if necessary to ensure that the overseas branches did not face financial
problems from worsening credit standings.
Several analysts in Tokyo said the Moody's ratings could push Japanese
authorities to take stronger action to solve the problems of bad debt
plaguing the financial system.
This year, authorities have intervened to limit the impact on the
overall financial system of the failures of three Tokyo credit unions,
including one last month.
However, political controversy and bureaucratic wrangling have so far
prevented the government from promising large injections of public money
to resolve the bad loan problem.
''When you're confronted with these kind of ratings, I hope this will
become a kind of springboard for the Japanese to act,'' said Richard
Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute. -- Reuter.

FROM a children's nursery rhyme to intimations of holocaust, Andrew
Kelm takes us on a deconstruction of Sing A Song of Sixpence which
spirals into ever more bizarre imagery. Directly addressing the audience
in the manner of a stand-up, with occasional magician-like flourishes,
he muses over the implications of the symbolism of the rhyme, marvelling
at the horror of the maid who has her nose pecked off, conjuring up
mutilation and blood-splattered laundry.
His rigorous questioning takes in biblical and historical references
and a spot of Freudian analysis, all delivered with witty aplomb. He not
only strips the rhyme bare, he strips himself, standing bollock naked as
he muses over the queen inside him. But despite his wry command of the
well-written material, it's a dispassionate piece which leaves you cold.

But David is no ordinary piscine playmate. And Lynn Ferguson's deft

It's a touching, funny, and perceptive play which allows Lynn to
display the full range of her acting abilities, from gutsy to prim, from
combative to defeated. And when Lynn does the play's central sad bit, it

THE tabloids have done Portfolio a service by stirring up a
shock-horror outrage over Serrano's glossy cibachrome photographs taken
in a morgue. The Pavlovian reaction is thus for ''experts'' to rush to
Serrano's defence. I have no intention of doing this.
Why? First, one must be convinced of what one is defending. I too
found these images difficult to look at, but that is not an proof that
they are great photos. Anyway, I am squeamish. And secondly, my response
to ordinary police photos would be just the same.
In fact I believe Serrano's less controversial Budapest pictures, the
young Sailor, the old life Model, are perhaps more interesting. They
capture the pose, glance, nuances of a personality. They also speak
volumes of a society at a particular time in its political development.
A corpse is a corpse.
Making work of rotting bodies is bound to shock. But it needs to do
more than that to be art.

MIRJAM has survived Auschwitz. So why has she slashed her wrists . . .
?
Memories, that's why. Memories that come milling on to the stage in a
rapid, stark collage of terror, death, brutality, and unexpected
sisterhood -- as she says herself ''the worst cruelty and the greatest
beauty''.
The women who people her memories are different ages, different
nationalities, different creeds. Only Mirjam (strongly played by Lynne
Livingstone) is a German Jew. Their one bond is the death camp.
Gradually the hostility of self-preservation gives way to a supportive
comradeship, the circumstances and the shifts of attitude finely
conveyed through the choreography that is central to the piece.
Elizabeth Marshall, Karen Coleman, and Katie McDonald give able
support, their characters reminding us of the courage shown during --
and after -- the Holocaust by those whose memories form the harrowing
basis of Mirjam.

BBC Radio Scotland's Dave Batchelor based this production on his
much-admired Radio 4 series about British life during wartime. It richly
deserves another outing, if only to let lunchtime audience see two fine
professional actors at work, using only their voices and facial
expressions.
Crawford Logan and Gowan Calder are both superb, creating a cast of
characters with accent and impersonations -- and both can sing well too.
With pianist Ralph Laing accompanying, it is Batchelor who provides the
bulk of the vocalese on songs familiar and obscure. He also takes credit
for what is an exquisite compilation, alternately hilarious and moving,
albeit still basically a radio show.

Role models offered range from Virginia Woolf and Viv Eliot (wife of T
S and alleged coiner of the title The Wasteland) to Van Hek's
grandmother, an outback woman who discovered lesbianism at the age of
40.
Van Hek seems to be a versatile and talented performer, but the show
has difficulty escaping from the lecture mode. There is however some
pretty good music, especially Joe Dolce's harmonica version of The

TORSION Theatre Company have choppped up the Bard and elongated bits
of themselves. Thus, we have a hilarious Romeo and Juliet where the
nurse dashes around, in wonderful Joyce Grenfell mode waving around arms
that come down to the floor, a Mercutio who cheerily strides about on
stilts, and a priest with a ballooning belly which he uses to fend off
the sodden nurse's unwanted attentions.
Romeo and Juliet are white-faced, red-nosed nerds, sick with puppy
love in the midst of all the chaos. It's gloriously energetic, hilarious
nonsense.
Their half-hour Hamlet, in stylish frock coats, was more sombre, with
elegant dance sequences condensing much of the action. Followed by a
dynamic, nightmarish 15-minute rendition of Macbeth this is one
thrilling, anarchic programme.

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with the non-EU countries widened from
#759m to #856m in July, the highest since December, confounding market
projections which had centred on a shrinking in the deficit to around
#630m.
Adverse factors included a continuing low level of oil export volumes
in recent months due to North Sea maintenance work which has also
boosted imports.
Stripping out oil and erratic items, defined as ships, aircraft,
precious stones and silver, leaves the deficit little changed at #650m
compared with #645m in June.
However, the Central Statistical Office said that the latest estimate
of the trend suggests than the non-EU visible balance is widening. In
the three months to July, the deficit was #2300m compared with #1100m
because of the reduced exports of oil and an increase in the total value
of imports.
The trading picture up to May -- for which the last global figures are
available -- showed that trading with the EU countries has been
reasonably encouraging with exports growing. But there are now definite
signs of a slowdown elsewhere and particularly in the US which is
hitting UK exporters.
Virtually all the non-EU areas showed a widening of the size of the
trade gap last month with North America increasing from #239m to #276m.
Taking the three months to July, the value of exports to North America
has fallen by 11.8% while imports have grown by 7.5%.
For July alone, the value of total imports to non-EU areas was
unchanged from June at #5115m while imports were a record #5971m, an
increase of 1.5% on June. In the three months to July exports fell by
2.5% while imports rose by 4.5%. Estimates of the trend in value show
imports rising and exports virtually flat.
Excluding oil and erratics the volume of both exports and imports rose
by 3.5% in July compared with June. But taking the three months to July,
exports fell by 0.5% while volumes were up 5%. And estimates of trends
show export volume flat and import volume rising.
The July outcome made little impression in share and currency markets
although analysts expressed their disappointment, suggesting that the
deterioration in net exports could dampen third-quarter GDP.
The UK's economic recovery has of course been export led. If the EU
countries were to follow North America, it would have worrying
implications for the economy. The global visible trade figures for June
are due on September 1.

SHARES in Eurotunnel plunged 28p a new all-time low of 138p as concern
mounted that there would have to be yet another re-financing within the
next few months as the company is failing to meet its revenue forecasts.
However, the Midland Bank, which is heavily exposed to the
cross-Channel tunnel company, did not make any extra provisions in its
half-time figures during the recent banking results season.
As usual, most of the action took place in Paris as French small
shareholders control the majority of the equity. There, the minority
shareholders' association suggested last week that Eurotunnel would lose
the equivalent of #1000m, compared with the company's own forecast
earlier this year of about #610m.
There is increasing pressure for state action to help it, although
that would raise a political storm from the ferry operators, who so far
have managed to withstand the competition with relative ease helped by
much better than expected bookings, particularly for one-day trips to
Calais.
Eurotunnel repeated yesterday that it would issue a revised 1995
profits forecast along with its interim results in October. However,
that is a considerable time ahead in stock market terms and there will
be pressure to bring forward the announcement.
Next month, it is due to meet its banks for talks about the terms for
financing the second tranche of its #693m senior debt, while debt
analysts argue that it needs #3000m of fresh equity to replace debt
before it can see light on the horizon.
It will be difficult to persuade shareholders to subscribe to a new
rights issue given that the last was in May 1994 at 265p or almost twice
the current share price.

WHEN I first saw Horse play I was still in school and Glasgow still
admitted to having a club called the Mayfair. The then-suited Horse had
a five-piece band behind her. She rocked until she collapsed, she sang
until she was hoarse.
On Friday, however, I saw a Horse in a completely different field.
There she stood, visibly older, more confident, dressed casually with an
acoustic guitar hung over her shoulder and only long-term friend Angela
McAlinden for accompaniment.
Her unmistakable voice rang through the old church like that of a
sweet bird. Songs new and old, fans new and old. And although she
commented on her nervousness, it was obvious she is much happier in a
smaller, more personal environment, swapping innuendo and chatting with
the audience who have all followed her long enough to believe they are
her friends.
A standing ovation said it all. Who could help but be won over?

<HEADLINE>ScottishPower dismisses defence document for #1000m bid. Manweb plans cashback</HEADLINE>

MANWEB has confirmed earlier hints that it is planning a financial
package for shareholders, including a cashback, as part of its campaign
to see off ScottishPower's #1000m bid.
Its formal defence document says substantial value will be released to
shareholders through the package which will include cash and its 5%
holding in the National Grid, the #4000m business due to be privatised
this autumn.
ScottishPower dismissed the document, with chief executive Ian
Robinson declaring: ''Manweb has failed to address the key issues raised
by our offer.''
Manweb has also confirmed that it will release a profits and dividend
forecast for the year to next March and will reveal further cost-cutting
moves. However, there is no mention of several years of special
dividends, which formed part of Northern Electric's defence against
Trafalgar House.
Manweb is keeping the powder dry on its financial package until later
in the battle, the latest time it can reveal it being mid-September. It
is hoping that by then the bid will have been put on ice through a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
However, at the rate ScottishPower is buying up shares on the market
-- it now has 14.4% -- it will soon be in a commanding position.
The defence document is the usual mix, rejecting ScottishPower's
criticisms and drawing attention to Manweb's successes, while attacking
the bidder's own record. But it fails to make a convincing hit on the
Scottish group.
In comparison to Hanson's agreed offer for Eastern, which valued the
target at 13 times adjusted earnings, ScottishPower's offer of 10.5
times Manweb's earnings ''looks mean'', according to Manweb chief
executive John Roberts.
The document accuses ScottishPower of mounting its bid to offset the
failure of its diversification strategy, with its retail and non-core
activities providing only 2% of operating profits and showing a return
on capital of only 7.7%.
''ScottishPower has diversified into market sectors which are highly
competitive and where the potential returns to shareholders are
questionable,'' Manweb states.
The group refutes criticism of its industrial and commercial supply
business, pointing out that it made profits of #41.7m in the last two
years from this within its own region, while ScottishPower lost #11.9m.
Also rejected is the bidder's assertion that Manweb's costs are high.
They are said to be in line with those of other electricity
distributors, while the distribution costs of the Scottish power
companies cannot be directly compared because they are allocated
differently.
Manweb claims to have managed costs in its distribution and supply
businesses more successfuly than its opponent, whose costs in these
areas ''have increased by 15.7% in real terms since 1990-91''. This was
rejected by ScottishPower as ''spurious'' last night.
Manweb also maintains it has lowered its domestic tariffs by 8% in
real terms between 1991-92 and 1994-95 against ScottishPower's 5%. But
the latter dismissed these figures as incorrect.
The cashback to shareholders will be financed through raising
borrowings and Manweb's document draws attention to its level of gearing
of ''only'' 21% even after its #92m share buy-back.
In Northern's defence its gearing was projected to rise to 175% as a
result of its shareholder package. This was widely considered excessive
and it is unlikely Manweb would want to go above 150%. Even at this
level shareholders could be paid more than 650p per share. If gearing
was limited to 100%, it would still come to 400p.
The payout would be largely offset by a corresponding reduction in the
share price, unless the dividend was raised sharply. Dividend cover
currently tops three times. If it came down to two the dividend could be
increased 1[1/2] times to 46p. In this case the rump of the company
would after a, say, 400p payout probably be valued at some 700p, giving
a total of around 1100p against the 973p offered by ScottishPower.
This gives an idea of the options available to Manweb and shows that a
sweetener will undoubtedly be required for ScottishPower to succeed. But
then it probably budgeted for that before embarking on the bid.

ON first consideration the new-look Ceolbeg doesn't seem so different
from the old model. Instrumentally, the band still has a tendency
towards making bonnie sounds with no great purpose, a kind of MacMuzak,
and is at its best by far on pipe-tunes such as the bold, stirring and
nicely named Mother Farquhar or the nimble Sleepy Tune with its loping
drum pattern.
With the introduction of Rod Paterson, however, Coelbeg now has a
commanding vocal presence, albeit under-utilised at the moment. A
long-time Burns' devotee, Paterson's Deil's Awa' Wi' The Exciseman,
smacking more of the Mississippi than the Afton, his terse, reggaefied
Ah Widnae Gie A Button For Her and the aptly titled The Presence
certainly boded well for the new partnership.

FIRST come first served. Sheeran Locke is quick off the mark when it
comes to Festival venues. She has two shows running, one at the College
of Surgeons, another at the British Council in Bruntsfield Crescent.
Both have exemplary catalogues.
Bernard Dunstan's Aspects of the Royal Academy -- a didactic display
on lithography -- explains the process in a series of preparatory
sketches, proofs and photographs.
Dunstan's four lithos, made over 10 months in 1994 at the Curwen
Chilford Studios with master printer Stanley Jones. They feature typical
views of the Royal Academy: a private view, musicians in the courtyard,
the Friend's room and last, the life room of the RA Schools where
students draw the model.
The show is linked to the RA Schools' appeal which gets a quarter of
proceeds to help restore their litho room. I suggest a similar project
for Glasgow School of Art for next year.

THE Prime Minister being Margaret Thatcher. The son being Mark -- a
natural figure of fun not only being the most treasured offspring of a
ruthlessly ambitious parent, but also being not very good.
That's where actor Richard Hallam, starring in James Poulter's one-man
play, scores most laughs. The over-privileged toff falling flat on his
face, failing his accountancy exams (three times), getting lost in the
desert, is a character-type we all love to hate.
But there's a more sinister side to the life of Mark Thatcher,
multi-million pound arms dealer, that this easy-going satire treats too
lightly. We can chuckle over his shortcomings -- and Hallam gives us
much opportunity to do so -- but should we be so blase about the power
he wields?

<TEXT>
AT last the FTSE-100 share index has attained a fresh closing record
after more than 18 months during which the stock market has been under a
cloud.
The previous closing peak was 3520.3 on February 2 last year. The
following day it lost ground after recording an all-time peak of 3539.2.
Yesterday's jump of 25.9 points to 3535.7, agonisingly short of a
proper breakthrough, came at the end of a summer rally which has added
over 200 points to the index.
Just as the rise in US rates, which began in February last year and
was replicated in the UK seven months later, caused share prices to
collapse last year (the Footsie fell below 2900 in June last year), so
this year's more benign interest rate environment has boosted share
prices on both sides of the Atlantic.
US interest rates were cut in July. UK rates have been on hold since
February and may be close to their peak. Gilts have joined in a
worldwide bond rally, and equities have risen on the back of this.
Takeover activity has provided the icing on the cake. Institutions are
becoming cash rich as a result. Ratings in the UK are not demanding,
certainly compared with the US, where the Dow-Jones index has built up
an 1100-point lead on the FTSE-100. The average yield on UK shares is
just below 4% against about 2.5% on Wall Street.
So far this year the Footsie has advanced by 15%, well short of the
Dow's 21%. On the face of it London has been left behind by New York.
However, the economy is slowing and margins are under pressure in some
areas.
It has been a long haul back to record-breaking territory. Even
allowing for fund managers' holidays, volumes have been low this month.
The market may have further to rise, but this is not a raging bull
market. In fact it is rather tame. So investors should not expect too
much more too quickly. If they get it takeovers will be a crucial
factor.
Points victory
THE downward revision to the second-quarter's gross domestic product
figures has given the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke,
victory on points in his long-running dispute with the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, over interest rates.
The two men have been at odds since May, but the argument has been
moving in Clarke's favour, especially in the last week. Inflation was
lower than expected in July, the pound has been given a leg up by a
rally in the dollar, and now there is evidence that the economy has
slowed down to a sustainable rate.
Second-quarter growth has been revised down from 0.6% to 0.5% against
0.7% in the first quarter. Its onshore component was restated at 0.6%
(0.7%), the same as the first quarter. Growth peaked in the second
quarter of last year when total GDP rose by 1.4% and onshore GDP by
1.3%.
The Central Statistical Office, which compiles the figures, said most
of the downward revision to the second-quarter figures was due to weaker
air transport and lower North Sea output. The latter fell by 3%, and
construction by 1.1%. However, manufacturing grew by 0.5%, electricity,
gas and water by 1%, agriculture by 2.5%, and services by 0.7%.
The key question is whether the slowdown in activity will prove
durable or there will be a bounceback in activity. Strong figures for
consumer spending, accompanying the GDP data, suggest the latter.
Consumers' expenditure grew by 0.8% in the quarter with the National
Lottery contributing about 0.2% of this. In the first quarter consumer
spending fell by 0.1%, but this now looks to have been an aberration.
Capital spending, which grew by 1.3% (disappointing at this stage in
the economic cycle), also reversed a first-quarter drop of 0.2%.
The rebound in consumption (and investment) suggests that activity
will pick up again, but the timing of this could be delayed by a stocks
overhang.
Stocks increased by #1600m in the quarter, the biggest rise since 1988
and equal to 0.6% of GDP. But stocks figures are notoriously unreliable
since they include residual errors and omissions and are subject to
massive revision.
Yesterday's CSO figures show a big deterioration in net trade, which
reduced GDP by 1% in the second quarter after increasing it by 1.4% in
the first. James Capel's Adam Cole questions this. In particular he
suspects that import volume may have been overstated and with it
stockbuilding.
Precipitate Fed
THERE is not much money going on the US Federal Reserve Board
delivering another cut in rates when its open market committee meets
today.
It last met on July 6 when the Fed funds rate was cut by a
quarter-point to 5.75%. The American banks followed with reductions in
their prime lending rates from 9% to 8.75%. But the US authorities left
the discount rate on hold at 5.25%.
At the time it was feared that the US economy would return negative
growth in the second quarter and Fed chairman Alan Greenspan did not
want to be accused of sparking off a recession. In the event the economy
turned in sharply lower growth of 0.5% in the second quarter, but since
then it has perked up again with the monthly indicators pointing to a
pick up in activity after a brief pause.
So there is no economic case for the Fed to ease rates again,
certainly not at this stage. The dollar is at last staging a useful
rally against the Japanese yen and the German mark. A rate reduction
would cut it short. Indeed many independent observers have criticised
the Fed's earlier move as precipitate.
The Bundesbank council meets on Thursday. The pundits are betting on
no change in the key discount and Lombard rates. But an easing of
inflationary pressures could enable the German authorities to justify
lower rates in the autumn.

LIZ AGGISS has an instinct for being unconventional. Some people have
to work hard to break rules, others rebel because they fret about going
unnoticed. Aggiss simply goes her own way, makes work that feels right
to her -- and leaves audiences thrilled by her audacity, her wit, and
her utter freshness.
It was this untrammelled individuality that led one London reviewer to
dub her 'The Vivienne Westwood of avant-garde dance'. The comparison
was, she says, ''The most wonderful thing ever said about me. Because it
places us, and the work, in a really nice niche. Gives audiences a right
good clue about us!''
Her latest venture is a solo event. ''It's just me,'' says Aggis
merrily. ''A radio mike. No music. Lots of text, lots of dance. And it's
quite visual too. What's more, it works! We've toured it around
different places and -- so far, anyway -- it's worked. It's kind of like
stand-up comedy, only it's dance. There's no equivalent word for it, so
I've started calling it stand-up dance.''
Absurditties, as the show is called, is about performing. It's about
the sudden, shifting relationship that exists between the on-stage
performer and the audience. It's an unpredictable affair, a one-sided
one even, with the performer exposed and vulnerable while the audience
chooses whether to become engaged or not.
Her collaborator in all this is musician/composer Billy Cowie. It's
his text that runs through her performance, a text full of puns and
wordplay where comedy intermingles with tragedy. ''It's that thing,''
says Aggiss, ''where the audience is moved between laughter and tears.
And often it's the music that manipulates the audience, you know --
prods them in the emotions. Here we're using words, word associations,
wordplay, instead of music.''
As we finish chatting, Aggiss muses -- ''I wonder what Vivienne
Westwood would feel about being called the 'Liz Aggiss of avant-garde
fashion'?'' I reckon she'd be well chuffed.
Divas presents Liz Aggiss in Absurditties at St Bride's Centre until
Saturday.

THE title might invoke saucy speculation but while this adaptation of
Denis Diderot's novel includes evocations of lesbian love this is
certainly not the stuff of nudge-nudge, wink-wink.
A deeply felt, scintillating performance from Maria Mamona, a Polish
actress performing in English, explores the full harrowing experience of
a young girl walled up in a convent against her will by a mother who
wants her to sacrifice her life to atone for her bastard birth.
Badly lit but beautifully staged, with a silvery bedstead and
high-backed chair becoming the bars of Mamona's prison, this is a
precious piece, tracing phases of frustration, torment, and flickering
sexuality. Gently erotic and fiercely passionate, it is played by Mamona
with luminous intensity.

FRAMED within the traditional context of courtroom flashback, John
Constable's one-man show is a fantastical yarn which has him explaining
how he worked as a cook in a Little Chef in Colwyn Bay, became an
undercover agent for the North Wales Drug Squad, experimented with the
chemicals under investigation, and experienced a subsequent
''revelation'' from David Bowie that ''when you and I come together the
earth moves''.
There follows lots of mystical references to the Land of the Dead Cat,
gratuitous decadence with a desultory striptease in Berlin, manipulation
by an alien dictator and a near-cataclysmic sexual union with Bowie.
Sounds absurd? Sounds contrived? It is. It's a badly acted, thinly
veiled argument against anti-drugs legislation . . . Just say no.

NOT five years since Scots Tories astounded us all by dodging General
Election wipe out, we again predicted their ruin. In April 1992, in
fact, the party emerged with a credible quarter of the poll and a net
gain of one seat from 1987 yet, only yesterday, we read of Jim Wallace
laughing to scorn any prospect of the Conservatives matching that
performance next time; indeed, he thought they would do well to win a
tenth of the poll.
Well, we shall see.
Why do Scots increasingly hate the Tories? For one, it is felt they
have been in power far too long, should they win the next election --
and, after 1992, it would be a brave man who unhesitatingly wrote them
off -- our country will seem perilously close to a one-party state.
The Tories are unpopular in Scotland because they are seen as
culturally alien. They have also, of course, set their faces as flint
against any measure of home rule, still vigorously hostile to
constitutional reform. This makes Scottish politics boring. Many a
scribing pen, many an important radio voice, yearns for an Edinburgh
parliament and some northern arena on which to carve their own
reputation.
As recently as 1979 the Tories actually won a Scottish election: in
the first direct European poll, they took more votes and more seats than
any other party. In 1995 they hold no Euro-seats, only nine
parliamentary seats, and control not one of the new single-tier local
authorities. The looming prospect of a Tory-free Scotland tempts us to
gloat. In truth, however, it might prompt the thoughtful citizen to
worry.
Progressive Conservative annihilation is, in many ways, a sign of
sterility in the Scottish body politic. A healthy nation votes, in its
elections, on the issues before it. But too many of our polls, since
1979, have been debased into party political beauty contests. Elections
for local government are more and more referenda on affairs in London.
There is also, of course, the prevalent obsession with the
constitution; a debate in which the Tories have nothing new to say. But
too many political chatterers show a fervour on home rule unmatched in
the public at large. Most Scots agree that an Edinburgh parliament would
be a Good Thing. Few, however, immediately mention it when asked to rate
the important issues of the day. Like any sensible folk, Scots list
rather employment, housing, inflation, education, health care.
Michael Forsyth is one of our more interesting politicians. He is an
original thinker, a competent Minister -- held in some awe by civil
servants -- and not from the standard Tory mould. He is also very brave.
He deservedly won re-election to his Stirling seat in 1987, and again in
1992, against prediction and against a peculiarly personalised and nasty
campaign. He is hated by the left because he is young and articulate and
not in the least afraid of them. Sir Hector Monro, and that ilk, are the
favourite Tories of such as Brian Wilson -- old, decent, paternalistic,
unthreatening. Forsyth is in a different league, a match for any of
them, and so they loathe the man.
Forsyth's principal difficulty is that, while leading a party of the
right, -- committed to minimal government, low taxes, sound money, and a
general distrust of the public sector -- he cannot call on the emotional
power of patriotism -- in England the Tories can drape themselves in the
Union flag. In Scotland such ballyhoo is impossible. Scottish
nationalism is for others, an exuberant Britishness comes over as
English and alien. Political nationalism, as the 1992 election proved,
is much overrated in Scotland. Cultural nationalism is a different
matter entirely.
There are two or three useful things Forsyth might consider.
One is to change his party's name, and return to the old banner of the
Scottish Unionists: that would detach them from their English brethren,
and grant a distinct Scottish identity. The name has a certain ring to
it. Around a quarter of Scots remain hostile to home rule in any shape
or form, and allegiance to the Union is the cornerstone of Scots Tory
identity. Since the seventies the Conservatives have refused any truck
with devolution schemes.
Another, however, is to ponder realistically what saving the Union
might mean. Is it merely to fight and fight and fight again for the
status quo? That battle has cost the Conservatives dear. They have lost
their local government base, lost their last European seat, been driven
from the Highlands, the Borders, and Glasgow, and forfeited the support
of most of the Scottish press. Some flexibility is called for here.
There are signs that Forsyth is toying with a ''Scottish senate''
scheme, as outlined by Bill Walker.
The big question is, of course, if the Tories have in their hearts
given up all hope of retaining power at the next election. If they have,
then Forsyth and his colleagues must consider their approach to the
Scottish parliament which the Blair Government will be committed to
creating. In opposition, Conservatives will be sorely tempted to seize
upon it as a handy club to hit the Government about the head; it will be
much more difficult to steer the measure through the Commons than many
at present think.
But, if Forsyth and his friends look to regaining power early next
century -- as they should be favourites to do; Labour governments always
collapse in economic crisis -- then a Scottish parliament might be worth
keeping. Under a fair voting system, there could be a substantial Tory
presence. And a good price for preservation might be exacted: a
substantial reduction of Scottish seats at Westminster.
Still we bay for a Tory-free Scotland. Do we really want it? There is
an unpleasantly cosy consensus between the Opposition parties --
principally, a belief in the unfailing usefulness of Government
intervention, a delight in throwing lots of public money at every
problem, an unhealthy ''intellectualism'' that uses power to pursue
ideological social ends, feminism and gay rights and so forth.
At present only the Tories, in their weary and time-served way, sing
another song. A brief rest from the chorus might be welcome. But killing
the choir could cost us all.

year by three musicians who most definitely can, the Tiger Lillies,
whose vocalist is an arresting blend of Jimmy Somerville, Tom Waits and
Shane MacGowan.
He sings of choosing between heroin and cocaine, plus what it night be
like to be a down-and-out schizophrenic with a messiah complex.
The Men Who Know address the more taxing everyday questions which
attend every male's shuffling passage from cradle to grave. Haircuts:
which is best? Sex: where to get it? Women: why? The pair's every
utterance is an adventure; their words joyous truths. To know The Men
Who Know is to love them.

TO make Bach's music for solo violin sound technically easy is always
said to show a failure to grasp the fact that it is meant to sound
extremely difficult.
But if Thomas Zehetmair, in the first of his three late-night Bach
recitals, revealed no more strain than a Mercedes negotiating an Alpine
pass, he made clear in other ways that these sonatas and partitas remain
among the supreme challenges of the violinist's repertoire.
The challenge for this Austrian performer lay beyond the notes.
Getting these right, as the adagio and fugue of the G minor sonata
quickly demonstrated, was no problem to him. But the perfection of flow,
the clarity of articulation, the delicacy of tone were simply the means
whereby he was able to explore such matters as exactly how beautiful the
music should sound, how energetic it should be, how rigorous its rythms,
how dance-like its pulse.
Speed, too, was an issue, though not in the ostentatious sense -- for,
once again, these were performances that went beyond ostentation. Yet
they certainly moved. Seldom has one felt less conscious of time passing
than in these keenly integrated performances, which allowed no room for
self-indulgence, for phrases sentimentally shaped or unfurled with
slippery smoothness. Everything seemed to have been scrupulously
weighed, studied, polished, then delivered with an intenseness that
avoided all hint of glibness.
Yet there was also an appreciation of the romance of Bach's music, of
the sort that divides perceptive Bach playing from the dryly competent.
In the first movement of the B minor partita, the sudden switch from
jerky rhythms to flowing semiquavers was the marvellous moment Bach
surely intended it to be. The music became airborne. Then in the
flickering presto of the succeeding courante it flew even higher. This
was Bach playing of both authority and nuance whetting the appetite for
tonight's instalment.

SOME disappointing playing yesterday from the Panocha Quartet in their
second appearance at the Queen's Hall, where their programme was devoted
to the last two string quartets by Dvorak.
Part of the Panocha style -- and indeed, part of their attraction --
has been their tendency to play with restraint and reserve.
Characteristically, they sound as though they are having a private
conversation, in which the audience are onlookers, hearing every word.
Yesterday -- at the outset -- that discretion became something more
retiring, with the effect that the performance of the A flat Quartet was
merely tentative. Intonation and direction were unsettled, and busy
contrapuntal passages -- not the strong point of the Panochas anyway --
became a bit of a scramble, with sometimes a complete loss of harmonic
and tonal focus. Rapid changes of mood -- such as the change from serene
to ardent music in the third movement -- were conducted impetuously,
leaving the group sounding ill at ease.
Maybe it was the intense heat in the hall, who knows? Anyway, after
the interval, the players seemed to draw themselves together, producing
something more like their familiar, relaxed form in the G major Quartet,
notably in the great, slow movement where the first violin melody
entered on a bed of gorgeous string sound provided by the rest of the
group.

INTRODUCING a programme of themes common to Highland and Lowland
cultures, the grand old man of Scottish folk music, Hamish Henderson,
stopped just short of accusing Highlanders of procuring Lowland tunes in
the same way as they procured cattle.
Just as well because there was enough fighting going on. Battles at
Killiecrankie and Harlaw, to name but two, raged as Norman Kennedy, in
splendidly weighty Doric tones, and Margaret Bennett, a clear Gaelic
singer if prone at times to over excitability, joined in.
From one F-word to another, both implicitly and explicitly, Kennedy
sang of amateur gynaecologists metaphorically stabling their stallions
before Henderson offered a more robust version. Whether Bennett's Golden
Cave continued this theme, I can't say, but it was a smashing song well
sung in another entertaining and well-subscribed trip to the Festival
Theatre's high-altitude folk club.

IN Edinburgh to catch some theatre before hurling back to London for a
gig with husband Julian Glover, was actress Isla Blair, star of the
final saga in the dramatisation of Michael Dobbs's House of Cards. Mr
Dobbs, you will recall, has already passed through the Book Festival,
loudly lamenting changes to the denouement of his yarn, and proclaiming
the state funeral of the Baroness Thatcher on television to be in bad
taste. (Speak for yourself, ducks.) However, the mini-series has
presented rather different problems for Ms Blair as she recounted over
much merriment during lunch with mutual pals.
She plays the PM's parliamentary private secretary, but is also having
an affair with the Foreign Secretary. And no, that's not her problem.
Parts for ladies of a certain age which include on-screen bonking with
fetching men are enough of a rarity to send female actors rushing to the
gym rather than the censor.
The problem transpires to be American coyness. Yes, you heard right.
For while US movies are not notably sensitive over matters sexual,
American television as screened by the Public Broadcasting Service is
quite another kettle of complexes. This series having been co-produced
with PBS, it therefore had to be scrutinised to make sure there was
absolutely nothing to offend network sensitivities. And on PBS, no nudes
is good nudes.
So Isla and co-star Paul Freeman had to reshoot a bedroom scene -- she
in hastily acquired black negligee and he in his undies. So far, so
silly. But wait. There is another problem, the actors are informed. They
will need to come back and redub the sound for the scene in question.
Apparently their orgasms topped the legal US sexibel count!
And aren't you glad you'll be seeing the version made for good old
raunchy Britain.
* AS we all know, do we not, Irish playwrights are a breed apart.
Hellraisers to a man. Think then of the damage being done to the
collective reputation by Frank McGuinness, author of the much-acclaimed
Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme. For while
Edinburgh heaves with blithe spirits doing joined-up partying, your man
has left town for a few days. To go, bejasus, to Iona.
* ALAS poor Bluefest, we never knew you well. But as the ill-fated
Lesbian and Gay Festival quits this parish clutching a Herald Devil by
way of compensation, at least one solo performer will be seen again in
Scotland this year. Gerry, sometimes known as Jenni Potter, is Chloe
Poems or alternatively Paddy Fields. Confused? You certainly will be. So
perhaps I should add that Gerry/Jenny is a Scouser whose character,
Fields, is a Tory MP by day metamorphosing into Chloe, transvestite
socialist poet by night, and known to her legion of admirers as The
Gingham Diva.
I'd like to tell you that it's unmissable but it closed before I got
there. However, Gerry with Jenny and Paddy and Chloe have now been
booked for Glasgay! this autumn and will be at the Arches from November
1.
* STRIDING manfully at the head of 3000 pipers on Sunday afternoon,
the square-jawed figure of Gavin Hastings heaving a thigh for Marie
Curie. Trotting along apologetically at the rear, Fringe press officer
Alison Forsyth who was really just trying to get to Fringe Sunday in the
Park. It took her two-and-a-half hours but then again she's now note
perfect in five reels and a Strathspey.
* DURING his appearance at the Book Festival, BBC diplomatic editor
John Simpson guessed that the way things were going he could be back in
Bosnia in a few days.
In fact, the way things went, he would end up in Amman. Which was very
bad news for one little old lady in Sarajevo. A Serbian resident in a
housing block whose other residents have no reason to love her
countryfolk, she is largely ignored by her neighbours and has no means
of support. Which is why Simpson always visits her with what supplies he
can.
Proof that journalism is not entirely peopled by folk selling their
grannies for stories.
* AND now, an important SOS. James Clapperton, the Aberdeenshire-born
composer and pianist, had his new work Elrich Fantasyis played by the
Hebrides Ensemble on Sunday as part of the Scottish Premiere Series
sponsored by my own dear Radio Scotland. Unfortunately such home games
are a novelty for Mr Clapperton. Although he'd love to come back and
work in his beloved North-east, all his employment opportunities emanate
from the deep south where he is currently exiled with his Canadian wife.
So perhaps out there somewhere is an oil multi-national with the wit
to commission half-a-dozen concertos or sponsor a residency.
Listen, the boy can't find anyone in Sussex with the Doric.

FASTER and faster the authority of Ireland's Catholic hierarchy is
unravelling. But the composure of the men who wield the croziers has
been shaky ever since those incidents, three years ago, when official
subterfuge was seen to have compounded the sin of paedophilia among
certain errant priests, and Annie Murphy ousted a bishop by venting an
abandoned lover's wrath.
Now more turmoil is being visited on the Catholic establishment by
another of their own as Brendan Comiskey, the Bishop of Ferns, almost
daily urges the church to listen to the questioning voice of the laity
and not denounce its desire for a debate on priestly celibacy. There is,
perhaps, an element of opportunism here.
Comiskey, after all, has never been a notable liberal although there
are those who now describe him as Catholicism's Martin Luther, a man of
spirit resolutely challenging the orthodoxy of Rome.
But more quickly than most of his brother bishops, Comiskey has
grasped the fact that much of the faithful already regard the Irish
hierarchy as obsolete. ''A huge reservoir of goodwill is being lost,''
he says, ''by a perception among major sections of our population that
they are not being heard.''
Such reflection is hardly the stuff of heresy but, coupled with
Comiskey's implication that marriage should not be outlawed for priests,
it has been sufficient to mark him down as an agitator deserving of a
clip around the mitre from Ireland's conservative Cardinal, Dr Cahal
Daly, and its papal nuncio.
Not that this has silenced the bishop. Instead the initial rebukes
only brought to the surface the high level of support for his opinions,
persuading the Cardinal that a measure of appeasement might be better
than outright war.
So, contrary to rumour, when Brendan Comiskey is summoned to the
Vatican next month to explain his views there will be, in the words of
one Rome-watcher, ''no chopping off of the head, or anything else'', but
a low-key mannerly discussion with Cardinal Bernardin Gantin of the
papal court.
Even so the malaise in the Irish church -- so outwardly unthinkable 10
years ago -- can no longer be disguised, its root cause being the
xenophobic fundamentalism which has maimed religious practice in the
past. Today with the old nationalist party Fianna Fail in disarray, and
Europhile politicians in the ascendant, De Valera's snug alliance
between church and state is finally over.
As evidence the coalition government, the other day, allocated a
#500,000 budget to promote a Yes vote in November's divorce referendum.
Meanwhile a recent international survey indicates that compared to the
rest of Western Europe Irish Catholics are ignoring the church's
teaching on social issues in greater numbers than elsewhere.
As to the issue of sexual abuse, the sense of betrayal among people
remains profound, and for those victims directly involved it is
difficult to see how any recompense will ever fully heal wounds hidden
by fear for so long. But on the subject of married priests there is no
public shock or horror at the proposal.
Significantly it was not Dr Eamonn Casey's affair with the American
divorcee, Annie Murphy, which scandalised people but the fact that he
rejected her when she became pregnant, then secretly siphoned off church
funds to support their child.
All this, of course, gave the Casey episode a Faustian dimension,
forcing his resignation as Bishop of Galway, and redemptive exile as a
missionary in Latin America. But if nothing else Casey's mortal frailty
exposed the cruel puritanism of the celibacy rule. The real concerns
were that he, like other priests, had been driven into aberrant
behaviour by a terror of the truth, and had also been able to cover his
tracks because others of high rank colluded to ensure nothing tarnished
his public image.
Yet braver priests wishing to marry were, and still are, pleading for
Rome's blessing only to be drummed out of the church as subversives,
often forced to suffer the whisperings of sanctimonious bigots. But
among radical clergy there is an acceptance that anyone trying to divert
the timid steps already taken towards cultural pluralism in Ireland is,
at last, on a loser. Ireland, semper fidelis, always faithful . . . not
even those who hear the sins of the people can be sure the ancient
incantation still holds sway. In this, the last five years of the
twentieth century, that old gravitational pull towards the confessional
is also in decline.

WILLIAM RUSSELL applauds a sensitive Irish film about family bonding,
a short Scottish films tackling issues of male sexual fantasies, and an
unusual story of alienation.
SCOTTISH cinema has been putting up an unusually strong showing at
this year's Film Festival, so Cathal Black's captivating Korea, based on
a short story by John McGahern, is a timely reminder of how good Irish
cinema can be. It draws on Ireland's past to great emotional effect.
Although only 75 minutes long, it is too slow for its own good, but a
little cutting would do the trick.
Ravishingly photographed by Nic Morris, it is set in the early 1950s
before the EC bonanza transformed rural Ireland into the Promised Land.
The story centres on village life round a lake in Cavan where Eamon
Doyle, sensitively played by Andrew Scott, lives with his embittered
widower father John -- a beautifully judged performance from Donal
Donnelly.
Eamon is helping his father while waiting for his exam results on
which his future depends. John is a freshwater fisherman whose
livelihood is at risk, the authorities preferring to keep the fish stock
for the tourists.
Eamon is in love with Una Moran (Fiona Molony), whose father, Ben, is
the water bailiff. John Doyle detests him for reasons that go back to
the time of the Troubles. Ben's son Luke, who emigrated to America, has
been killed in Korea, hence the title. John insists that Eamon, who has
''got the education'', must go there too, a ploy to get him away from
the Morans.
It is a mood music piece, and Black has used the waters of the lake,
the eels struggling in their traps, the rain streaming down, the
sunshine piercing the clouds and catching the water's surface, and the
greens of the countryside to enhance this tale about a sorrow purged as
father and son come to understand one another at last.
Scottish cinema is represented by The Contract, a short film written
and directed by Ewan Morrison. A sharp-edged black comedy, it tackles
male sexual fantasies without actually indulging in any on-screen sex,
which does make a change. A young man, obsessed with the philosophy of
Leopold Von Sacher Masoch, goes to a sex therapist, played with style by
Jacqueline Pierce, a born Madame Whiplash, for help.
They make a contract -- she is to abuse him in the hope this will cure
his fantasies. Shot in black and white by Kathleen Friend, it makes
highly imaginative use of its Glasgow locations, notably the City
Chambers, to suggest an ornate, exotic world in which perversions can
occur quite naturally.
Another interesting Scottish film was Morag McKinnon's 3, a 75-minute
feature made for a mere #40,000. A story of myth, magic and alienation
it is visually astonishing, but suffers from some dreadful acting and a
script which, when it is not unspeakable, is highfalutin rubbish.
Carl, a graphic designer, haunted by a mysterious figure, The Elder
(Tam Dean Burn), seeks the help of a fey girl singer called Sri to do
something or other, find himself I think. The highly imaginative opening
sequence in which Carl is born augurs well, and some good songs follow,
but the real achievement was getting it made at all. Given a decent
script and more money, Ms McKinnon should go far.

I HAVE, I suppose, for a West of Scotland fiftysomething male, an
ambivalent -- some might say deviant -- attitude to competitive sport.
The desire to participate is fast slipping away. But neither it nor the
will to compete, in my case, was anything like turbo-charged in the
first place.
Contemporaries who still play serious five-a-side football or pull on
a veteran's rugby jersey seem to me near-certifiable. My early
scientific training baulks at a recently reported academic finding that
baseball-playing countries enjoy economic growth rates 123% higher than
those which prefer the more leisurely pace of cricket. Sport can't be
that important, I reassure myself.
I enjoy watching football and rugby, golf and athletics, but only up
to a point which is, as often as not, reached long before the final
whistle has blown or the winning putt has dropped. Team tribalism or an
encyclopaedic knowledge of the personalities and performances involved
in this sport or that leave me, for the most part, in a state of
marginalised indifference.
Last week's orgy of Ally McCoist worship on the sports pages for
putting one past the Greeks had me thoroughly bemused. Wasn't Super
Ally, according to those same pundits, a yard or two off the pace not so
long ago after breaking a leg, a charmer dogged by injury, in the
twilight of his competitive career?
But I'm not so much of a sporting curmudgeon that I can't thrill at
McCoist's chutzpah, marvel at the diminutive Ethiopian Gebreselassie
slicing 11 seconds off the world 5000 metres record, or revel in Brian
Lara's effortless stroke play. It's just that, in my life, sport is of
distinctly secondary significance.
I still try to swim every week and may soon, thanks to the brimming
enthusiasm of a newly teenage son, be lured back on to the tee to
address a little white ball I last seriously confronted in the deep
rough of the Whinhill public course high above Greenock, in my own
teens. Ewan's already got me back to the snooker table although I've
left it to his granda to introduce him to the bowling green.
I bought a bike last year, but have used it almost exclusively for
undemanding family outings. Ten years ago I ran a couple of marathons
within six weeks of each other (3hrs 47mins and 3hrs 36mins
respectively, for the statistical omnivores among you), lured into the
experience by a Stewart McIntosh campaign in this newspaper to bring
fitness through running to the over-forties.
McIntosh's big sell to guinea pig friends like me was the chance to
train and get fit under the supervision of cardiologists at Glasgow's
Western Infirmary. McIntosh has much to answer for. The reality was
that, after the trauma of the tests the medicos inflicted on us,
pounding round 26 and a bit miles of Inverclyde or Glasgow was a breeze.
How would you like to be sat on a monocycle, clutching a large steel
sphere (enclosing a gamma camera) with both arms, pedalling to
exhaustion against a wickedly rising braking strain, while assorted
white-coated technicians draw blood every few minutes from one arm and
inject a gold isotope into a cannula in the other, just so they can take
pretty coloured snaps of a heart near bursting point? Sad to say, I've
hardly run the length of myself since. Swimming, they tell me, is less
punishing on the knee and ankle joints.
But, no matter how hard I try, I can't quite manage a complete divorce
from competitive sport. It's not just the expectations of our resident
sports-mad teenager. It's not just the social hospitality whirl which,
occasionally, catches journalists like me in its eddies.
It's the fact that I'm supposed to know something about business. And,
as business and competitive sport become more and more enmeshed, I get
dragged in professionally, from time to time, to dissect the
balance-sheet implications of, for example, booting a ball around a
football pitch.
My own modest financial relationship with sport has never wavered from
a bright red deficit. A recent afternoon at Hamilton races left me #20
the poorer, with not one winner to my credit. I should have known
better.
But I can read a balance sheet. So, when editors or newsdesks get
excited about this sporting business deal or that, I tend to get
involved. I try, as I always try to do in mainstream business stories,
to get at the facts.
When David Murray first took control of Rangers, I was the only person
in the newsroom who had ever met him or knew anything about him. I wrote
a lot of the background copy. When, a few years later, I carried out a
critical investigation of Murray's involvement in property development,
you would have thought I had personally planted land mines all over the
Ibrox centre circle.
Those property interests were rapidly restructured. But, in the way
that competitive sport can distort normal human behaviour, I stood
accused of waging some sort of personal vendetta against the Rangers
chairman. I am not, as it happens, much into vendettas.
More recently, in an even-handed sort of way, I helped to carry out a
critical assessment of the Celtic share prospectus. I was summoned to
Parkhead for a three-hour re-education programme by Fergus McCann's
financial advisers. I stuck to my downbeat analysis. The fans plunged in
anyway and left the issue hugely over-subscribed.
I've been back to both Ibrox and Parkhead since. David Murray chooses
not to speak to me. Recently, at Parkhead for the Liverpool friendly, I
met Fergus McCann again. ''Yes, you're the journalist who thinks
football is a business,'' he greeted me, with a twinkle in his eye. ''I
used to think that when I first came here.'' And off he went, chuckling,
to shake other hands.
I recommend to both of them an interview with Chelsea director Matthew
Harding in yesterday's FT. Harding has put #24m of the #125m fortune he
has made from the insurance market into the team he loves.
''I don't want it back,'' he says. ''I also don't want to turn it into
#48m by virtue of a stock market flotation. But I would be bloody
mortified if the effect of that #24m was worthless.'' There speaks the
wealthy fan who knows that the only real profit earners in sport are the
elite sportsmen and women who were a lot further up the queue than I was
when the right genes were being handed out.

IT was always going to be Boris Pergamenschikow's night. Anyone who
heard the Russian cellist last weekend playing with Andras Schiff's
quintet was immediately struck by the huge, rounded sound he made, his
fabulous technique, and the rock-solid playing that poured from his
gorgeously rich, eighteenth-century Montagnana cello.
And apart from all that, in last night's marathon concert featuring
all three of Dvorak's concertos, Pergamenschikow, with the Cello
Concerto, quite simply had the best material to play. And he made the
most of it, piling in with a big, impassioned sound and phenomenal
articulation. He's a real lyricist of the instrument, completely
eschewing all the fancy tricks like half-breathed sounds and effete,
pseudo-poetic musical gestures.
Pergamenschikow, one of the most formidable cellists of the day, is
robust. That's the word for him. Everything he does is characterised by
a ruggedness. It's not insensitive -- far from it; in the slow-movement
beauties, or the ravishing moments at the end of the concerto, he was as
delicate as any master cellist. But what he has, and never lets slip, is
the ability to imbue everything he plays with a soulful intensity. It
marked every bar of his performance.
And the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras at the
helm, added their own layer of intensity with some magnificent playing,
and a fierce concentration that suggested they had been waiting most of
the night to get their teeth into something.
Not that there hadn't been some good things earlier. Andras Schiff,
opening the concert, had squeezed as much juice and sparkle out of the
Piano Concerto as there was to be had. His performance -- amazingly
dexterous in the face of Dvorak's torrential keyboard writing --
revealed an infectiously amiable piece, for all its longueurs and
gaucheries.
Less happy altogether was Yuuko Shiokawa's performance of the Violin
Concerto. It was almost as though she stood back from the piece, playing
it without identifying with its warmth. This was harsh, bright, and
soulless playing, with no lilt to its rhythms, no tenderness at its
core.
The SCO and Sir Charles Mackerras, accompanying stoically throughout
all this, had their own brief chance to shine -- which they did not miss
-- in an atmospheric and highly charged account of the incident-packed
symphonic poem, The Noonday Witch.
A long night, and not for the faint-hearted, though it has to be said
that the Usher Hall, steamingly hot, was packed to the rafters,
continuing to reflect very high sales this year for the orchestral
series. This, evidently, is a festival audience that is scared of
nothing. Bravo to them.

A company with Rimsky in its bones brings conviction to this tale of
bards and sea nymphs.
IF Sheherazade contains Rimsky-Korsakov's most enduring orchestral
seascapes, then Sadko is its more massive operatic equivalent. Why,
then, is it so rarely staged outside Russia? The answer -- well, one
answer -- was provided by the Kirov Opera last night in a performance
that demonstrated how utterly Russian the piece undoubtedly is. A
production of it by Scottish Opera would be unimaginable.
Only a company with Rimsky in its bones could bring conviction, one
suspects, to this tale of bards and sea nymphs, in which singers and
dancers intermingle in a series of spectacular tableaux.
But there is another answer to the work's general neglect and that is
the sheer voluminosity of its structure. Because, in a very Russian way,
so many advisers got in on the act, what could have been a simple
fairy-tale ended up mixing elements of Swan Lake, Peer Gynt, and The
Odyssey in a four-hour epic whose slenderness of material became more
and more evident as it proceeded.
Conviction, however, the Kirov performance -- there will be another
tonight -- certainly possessed. Big tableau-esque operas are tailor-made
for big Russian companies, and Sadko, with its quayside and underwater
scenes, was predictably splendid.
Colour was employed with a vibrancy that made you wish someone would
do the same for Wagner's Ring -- a work by no means distant in intention
from Rimsky's Russian epic. Vladimir Galusin's portrayal of the tenor
hero certainly stressed the point, as also did Evgenia Tselovalnik and
Valentina Tsidipova in the roles of wife and seductress.
But the galvanising force, as in last week's performances of Kitezh,
was Valery Gergiev as conductor of the rough-edged but grandly sonorous
Kirov orchestra.
Rimsky, often dismissed as a cold technician, emerged as a composer
poetic and fanciful. And the biggest stage in Britain -- in spite of too
many offstage bangs and thuds -- showed that it could successfully
accommodate opera on the largest scale.

EVEN in this oxter-searing hot weather, golf course gauleiters are
immovable in their dress code rigour. The hon. sec. of Balmore Golf Club
near Glasgow has seen fit to write to members ''following upon numerous
complaints regarding the deterioration in dress standards''.
We presume that golfers at Balmore have been going around the
clubhouse with top buttons on their shirts shamelessly undone. Some of
them may even have been exposing their legs.
The letter warns of seriously sweaty consequences: ''In the event of
the decline in standards continuing, Council will have no alternative
but to re-introduce a dress rule of jacket, collar, and tie at all
times.''
The hon. sec. reminds members that jacket, collar, and tie must be
worn in the lounge and dining room of the clubhouse after 7pm on
Saturdays and Sundays.
Tee-shirts, denim-style trousers, and trainers are a definite no-no
anywhere at any time. Shorts are permitted but only if tailored and worn
with top hose, as favoured by the British district commissioner in those
Somerset Maugham films set in the tropics.
Rising to the bait
THE scene is a small loch above Plockton where Hughie, a friend of a
friend of the Diary, turns up at 5am for a spot of fishing. He notices
there is a ground sheet and a collapsible stool occupying one of the
better spots on the lochside.
But there is no sign of any angler. Where is he? Has he drowned? The
mystery is solved when the angler turns up to claim his spot at 8am.
Yes, he was a German.
Splash hit
MORE tourist tales. This time the scene is the top of a sight-seeing
bus parked near the Scott Monument. An American lady asks her husband:
''Who was this man Scott anyway?'' He replies: ''You know, honey. He was
the guy who put his kilt in a puddle for Queen Victoria.''
Losing number
JUST one digit has prevented an exodus of staff from the Scottish
Conservative Party Scottish headquarters. The winning numbers for
Saturday's National Lottery were 5, 8, 23, 24, 28, and 48. The Tory
party staff had five of the numbers but 29 instead of 28.
The syndicate, including campaign director David Canzini and press
officer Bill Shaw, won a #1500 third prize instead of the #3.8m jackpot.
Captive audience
THERE has always been something exotic about the names chosen by
Rangers supporters clubs. Like the Bellshill Chosen Few, the Honest Toun
Loyal, the Hull and Grimsby True Blues, not to mention the Mark Hateley
(Sunderland) Loyal. To this proud legion of clubs we can add a new name,
Her Majesty's Prison Shotts Rangers Supporters Club.
According to the fans' notes in the Rangers News, ''interested
supporters must be season tranny holders''. We presume this is a
reference to transistor radios which would be the true blue inmates'
method of access to Rangers matches. They certainly will not be getting
out to many games.
The contact for the Shotts prison club is Jim Baillie, prisoner 1046
in C Hall. The supporters' notes contributed by Mr Baillie to the Gers
newspaper are pretty cryptic but it appears he relies on videos made by
fans on the outside to keep the blue flame burning while he is an
enforced, and we presume entirely loyal, guest of Her Majesty.
Service resumed
THE ceasefire in Northern Ireland has brought a small but welcome
peace dividend to visitors to Edinburgh. During the Troubles, the Tattoo
was recognised as a prime terrorist target. Thus the Royal Mail
letterboxes on the Royal Mile were traditionally blocked up and put out
of service for the duration of the military entertainment at the castle.
This year it is different. The peace process has brought literally a
chink of light. The letterboxes have been adapted to incorporate a slit
in the metal just wide enough for the tourists to pop in their
postcards.
Recipe for success
WE should know better than to rely on the publisher's blurb when
writing about new books. Keeping up with Magda we said was a bit of
bodice-ripping debut of a novel by Isla Dewar, laying bare the seething
sexual undercurrents of a fishing village not a million miles away from
Anstruther in the east Neuk of Fife.
We have had a chance to read it and, while there is a high-hormone
factor, the book is mainly notable for its acute observations of
small-town life. The motor mechanic who spots that a car belonging to a
newcomer to town needs a new exhaust. He slips under the car and does a
temporary repair with some string. Not out of any sense of a friendly
welcome. He didn't want to risk the exhaust finally breaking down
elsewhere.
The eponymous Magda is a wonderfully strong female character. Asked by
the town Mary Whitehouse if she is against sex before marriage, Magda
replies: ''Absolutely. It rumples your wedding frock and your veil goes
all askew.''
Asked her opinion of men she replies that, on balance, she is in
favour of them: ''They're one of my favourite sorts of human being. I'd
let my daughter marry one. But I wouldn't want to be one.''
What the publishers missed in their blurb was the sheer sensuality of
Magda's cooking -- the duckling with baby turnips, smoked fish
omelettes, pesto-topped baked salmon, buttered brioche spread with
bitter marmalade dipped in fresh orange juice and baked in a creamy
vanilla custard. Now that's the stuff to get the juices flowing.

Sydney
A STUDENT who fired a track starter's pistol at the Prince of Wales
during a royal visit to Australia last year went on trial in Sydney
today.
David Kang, 24, denied threatening unlawful violence to the heir to
the throne.
The incident happened in a central Sydney park on January 26, 1994,
during a ceremony to mark Australia's national day.
Kang was arrested seconds after he lunged on to a stage where Prince
Charles was standing. The prince was unharmed.
Prosecutor Patrick Power told the court that Kang struck after he
wrote a letter complaining about the Australian Government's detention
of Cambodian boat people.
Kang, who is of Korean origin, had psychiatric treatment for months
after his arrest.
The prosecutor said that in a videotaped interview, Kang told police
he had been surprised that no guards had shot him as he ran towards the
prince.
At earlier hearings Kang's lawyers argued that he never intended to
harm the prince. If convicted he is likely to receive a brief prison
sentence or fine.
* High Court Judge William Deane was today appointed Australia's next
governor-general until the end of the century, when the Labour
Government hopes to end formal links with Britain and create a republic.
Deane would replace Bill Hayden as the local representative of the
Queen on February 16, Prime Minister Paul Keating said.
He added that Sir William would end his appointment the day before
January 1, 2001, Keating's target date for the Australian
republic.--AP/Reuter.

Pupils can't get enough of the creative challenges offered by a new
joint supported-study scheme, reports DICK LOUDEN.
A GREAT deal of favourable publicity has been generated recently by
supported study schemes, under which pupils from areas of priority
treatment come into school after normal hours and study in a pleasant
environment with support from teachers and access to resources.
While Strathclyde region was developing these innovative schemes, the
Prince's Trust, a registered charity, was funding others in Belfast,
London, Bradford and Liverpool. Now the two have come together and
expanded their focus by offering one-week summer supported study
schemes, whose aim is to develop pupil skills in areas such as drama,
music-making, graphic arts and video production.
At Linwood High in Renfrewshire 20 pupils from first year upwards
produced the first issue of a school magazine and set up a pupil
committee to oversee future editions. The youngsters were involved in
writing, editing, desktop publishing, layout, design and advertising --
and also enhanced their social skills through working within the
framework of a team.
They were guided by three teachers -- Lesley Hinde, Eddie Mack, and
Shirley Jones, the project co-ordinator, whosaid: ''The pupils were
volunteers. Before the summer we held lunchtime meetings and divided
them into three groups -- design, content, and technical. We then
sub-divided them into news, features, sport and public relations. We
have decided on the name -- PA3: Linwood High School magazine. It will
be produced twice a year and the first edition will be issued free to
all our parents and sponsors.''
She was delighted by the children's enthusiasm -- ''Some of them turn
up at half past eight and they won't even take their full lunch hour.''
For second-year pupil Ian King it was ''far better than sitting at home,
wondering what to do. I'm doing telephone calls to find advertisers at
#5 for up to a half-page. We're getting plenty of adverts -- some
businesses are getting them free because they've given us competition
prizes.''
Emily Brook, entering sixth year, wants to do a general degree before
becoming a journalist. ''I've been working on contents and PR,'' she
explained. ''Apart from preparing thank-you letters to sponsors, I've
done an article on the Bon Jovi concert in Sheffield, which I attended.
I might also write an opinion piece on our school uniform and what
changes might be made to it.''
Second-year pupil Johanne Paton was enthusiasm personified. ''I love
English, I love to fantasise, I love to speak my mind,'' she said. ''I
want to be an actress. The first morning was excellent. I phoned Asda
and this woman called Patsy gave me two #5 vouchers. I know the
shopkeepers, so I've written to them all. I just love this -- reading,
writing, going out to interview people, being part of a team, knowing
something will come of it.''
Now the Prince's Trust has expanded its sponsorship of supported study
to Lothian, in collaboration with the regional council and
ScottishPower, by running a summer school, based in Leith Academy, for
more than 200 third-year pupils from across the region.
The initiative was designed to focus on investigation and project
management skills as well as personal and social development. Andrew
Gibb, Scottish fund-raising director for the trust, hopes that the
summer school will be the catalyst for introducing supported study after
school hours into many Lothian secondaries this session.
This view is echoed by Anne Marie Carrie, project co-ordinator of the
summer school and Lothian's principal officer in charge of secondary
schools. ''Thanks to the trust and the region, we have funding to
establish evening supported study in three Edinburgh high schools --
Castlebrae, Craigroyston and Wester Hailes,'' she said, ''and we hope
that feedback from youngsters and staff involved in the summer school
will provide the impetus for other schools to start their own schemes.''
Forty teachers, all from different Lothian schools, were selected from
numerous volunteers and given a training programme. ''We looked for the
ability to work collaboratively,'' explained Anne Marie Carrie, ''and to
take a generic rather than subject-based approach.''
The pupils were nominated by staff of their own schools, usually on
the basis that they could obtain positive benefit in the approach to
next year's Standard Grade exams, or because they were not fulfilling
their potential through lack of social advantages at home. They were
invited to attend full-time for a week, selecting from several
activities, but such was the enthusiasm that many asked to return for
further weeks.
Kirsty McEwan, from Deans Community High in Livingston, admitted that
it had been ''better than I thought. Among the activities I chose were
confidence-building techniques -- like relaxation and role playing --
and roller-blading. I thought we'd have to write all the time but we've
had workshops, projects and group presentations.''
Another Deans pupil, Mandy Chan, who like Kirsty returned for a second
week, enjoyed ''working with pupils from other schools. We did a drama
workshop about teenagers stealing from shops. I also selected face
painting, the Internet and writing skills, to help me with my stories.''
David Skene from Castlebrae High joined the summer school because his
PE teacher told him he would get help on how to go about his PE Standard
Grade investigation for the new session. ''It was good,'' he said. ''I
was told all about the content, the layout and the amount of material to
put into it.''
An evaluation of the Leith Academy initiative is being undertaken by
Dr Brian Boyd, associate director of the Quality in Education Centre at
Strathclyde University. ''We issued the pupils at the start with a
questionnaire about their attitudes and we shall be conducting a
follow-up exercise in September to assess how attitudes have changed,''
he said. ''At the request of the Prince's Trust I shall also be
producing a handbook which can be used in connection with future summer
schools.''

The Quantity Surveyor: It's a profession that can take you far, learns
Eric Kennedy.
THESE days you don't have to join the Navy to see the world. How about
the unlikely profession of quantity surveying? ''A large proportion of
quantity surveyors have been involved in overseas work at some time or
other,'' says Keith Gourlay. And he should know -- he has worked in
Qatar and Tanzania.
He was abroad for two years and over four years respectively, handling
large-scale projects and enjoying a fairly high-flying lifestyle. ''But
even if you are working in dreary old Britain, you normally get out and
about a bit, meeting people,'' he says.
Quantity surveyors are responsible for the measuring and valuing of
building or civil engineering work. Those working for contractors act on
their employers' behalf, and those working on private contracts act on
behalf of the building or project owner.
Keith Gourlay entered the profession on leaving Falkirk High School in
1978, taking a job with a local private practice and attending Napier
College (now University) in Edinburgh one-and-a-half days a week. The
firm paid for that, and this was the accepted way into quantity
surveying at that time.
Nowadays about 95% of people take a degree course, at Napier,
Caledonian, or other college or university, graduating BSc. Some,
however, still take the day-release route. Either way, it entails a
great deal of hard work and home study.
Keith's way meant a five-year slog. He left his original employers,
who were encountering difficult times, just before completing his
studies and becoming an Associate of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors. He was a qualified surveyor, but to become a chartered
surveyor one must take a Test of Professional Competence.
This has to be preceded by the keeping of a diary of professional
experience for three years, under supervision.
Keith Gourlay sat and passed this in 1988, as it had not been possible
to do so earlier as the types of jobs he had meanwhile undertaken did
not offer access to this professional supervision. But meantime he
gained some terrific experience, taking jobs with another Falkirk firm
for two years before heading for Qatar to become involved in top-secret
Ministry of Defence projects for a further two years. He also had a year
out, in between times.
It was in 1987 that he returned to Britain, working with a major
contractor and concentrating full-time on a major refurbishment of
Perth's Salutation Hotel, the oldest in Scotland. His firm won a #30,000
bonus for completing the project ahead of time.
It was also, however, running into problems as the construction
industry continued to decline after the boom years of the seventies; so
he left to join a major building and engineering contractor, involved in
the #1.6m refurbishment of high-rise flats in Glasgow.
Then it was time to go abroad again, and 1989 saw him in Dar-es-Salaam
as project manager for a #5m multi-storey office block. In April last
year he came back to Glasgow, and to a senior position with Scotland
Track Renewals Unit, an emerging company formed by the privatisation of
British Rail.
At present he is involved in drawing up contracts for renewing track
in different parts of Scotland, and the company might soon be spreading
its wings further afield. But no real competitive tendering has taken
place in the railway environment before, so Keith Gourlay finds the work
challenging and enjoyable.
He would recommend quantity surveying to anyone. ''It's interesting,
demanding and rewarding,'' he says. ''You can't ask for much more than
that.''

Great minds are being concentrated on the appliance of science to the
real world -- to see that lab developments are quickly transformed into
sales potential, reports Bill Magee.
SCOTLAND's expanding cluster of biotech companies is rapidly becoming
more market-led in its approach towards training up key personnel.
Further talks are being staged this month with a view to developing a
new approach, to ensure that any new bio-technological product develops
rapidly from laboratory and into the marketplace.
The industry, comprising more than 100 firms in Scotland alone, has
for years been responsible for a series of revolutionary technological,
chemical and medical studies in the fields of health care, food,
engineering and the environment. Yet it is still hampered by a
now-outdated image of white-coated lab-bound boffins.
Now, however, individuals with a career portfolio combining expertise
backed up by business knowledge, especially in marketing, are
increasingly in demand by companies as they bid to display more of a
sense of the marketplace and now the gap between innovative laboratory
work and bringing much-needed products to market faster.
John Bremner, head of Scottish Enterprise biotechnology unit, says a
great future lies ahead for the sector. ''Scotland has an established
cluster of biotech companies in the UK. As we progress, we are
increasingly relying on technical knowledge. If we can marry that to
business and commercial knowledge, we will be stronger and more able to
concentrate on opportunities that undoubtedly exist.''
One such company is Aberdeen-based Biovation, which concentrates on a
core technology of DNA and antibody manipulation, with special emphasis
on cancer research.
Enjoying close technical support from the city university, the firm
continues to seek assignments from pharmaceutical companies for contract
work.
Gavin Don, partner in Equitas, small-company finance specialists,
says: ''Anyone nowadays displaying scientific academic success coupled
with a business edge represents a doubly valuable asset to a biotech
company.''
Now a new training programme for the industry is being introduced.
Talks with varous interested parties to help companies become more
product-to-market orientated are currently being staged by the Advanced
Centre for Biochemical Engineering at University College London (UCL).
Programmer manager Dr Tony Bradshaw is a former Heriot-Watt University
graduate.
Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish Biomedical Association and Scottish
Biomedial Trust are high on his list, with the centre having recently
been awarded a major grant by the Sciences Research Council to develop
training for industry.
The UCL programme is part of an integrated graduate development scheme
and directed by leaders in the industry through the centre, which is now
well established in a new #12.5m facility.
Tony Bradshaw says: ''To remain competitive in what represents one of
the fastest growing manufacturing sectors in the UK, staff needed
continuous and flexible training to keep pace with rapid developments in
bioprocessing.''
His centre's programme does not necessarily offer a panacea for the
centre; it is, however, designed to provide scientists and engineers
alike with training to enhance their ability to translate novel
bioscience into industrial processes. This can ultimately lead to
getting a new bio-product to market faster.
The training is both integrated and based on a high-quality modular
approach to address the industry's immediate needs. ''Modules can be
taken individually or as a sequence leading to three levels of academic
achievement which includes and MSc in Bioprocessing.''
Training courses cover the areas of fermentation together with
biotransformation, downstream processing, bioprocess design, monitoring
and control, the impacts of DNA technology, biosafety and environmental
and validation issues.
Gavin Don of Equitas says: ''Society is currently involved in an
incredibly exciting period and biotech is going to do for industry what
personal computers did, but more so. There are revolutionary processes
in health care, food, the environment and engineering in the offing.
''The works in fact, as huge tracts of industry completely change
their methods of production with the next 10-20 years.''
However, biotech is not necessarily renowned for having a hard
business edge and this is where Equitas comes in: developing business
strategies for those small companies that found it far from easy to
separate the lines between finance and marketing.
Meanwhile, the UCL training programmes are all about the development
of multi-skilled fexible personnel, to enable the efficient and safe
design, operation and scaling-up of bioprocess sequences.
This would lead also to the speed-up of transfer of these processes
from laboratory to pilot stage and on to manufacturing scales, while
keeping those involved at the forefront of bioprocess technologies.
Dr Bradshaw says: ''Also addressed are improvements in the
collaboration between engineers and scientists, research, development
and production, and bioprocessing companies and their suppliers.''
Furthermore, the UCL training increased personnel motivation through
an enhanced professional status, the new MBI programme, to facilitate
the adoption of best practice in the biotech industry.
Candidates from Scottish biotech firms are being sought for the new
UCL training programme.

Vicki Speedie knows why. It gave her a remarkable degree of
confidence. And this Glasgow University initiative continues to be a
positive inspiration to those who call on its special kind of help,
writes Dick Louden.
IT HAS been a good summer for Vicki Speedie. She completed her Honours
degree at Glasgow University in physiology and sports science. Now, in
pursuit of her ambition to become an accredited sports psychologist, she
is going on to take a Master's degree at Exeter University. She is still
looking around hopefully for financial support but this talented young
sportswoman -- captain of the university swimming team -- is heading for
Exeter, come what may.
Vicki has shown this determination since she left Blantyre High School
four years ago. Her Higher passes were not quite good enough to gain a
place on her chosen university course, so she enrolled in the annual
summer school which was started by Glasgow University in 1986, enjoys
strong financial and professional support from Strathclyde region, and
now involves all higher education institutions in the West of Scotland.
The summer school is aimed principally at pupils from areas of
deprivation who may have little knowledge of university life and in many
cases, like Vicki, do not quite possess the qualifications for entry.
Though may not have achieved their full academic potential at school,
the summer school offers lecturers the chance to assess whether they
have the qualities to undertake a degree course. If they impress, they
could be offered a place.
This happened to Vicki Speedie and she returned to the summer school
this year to talk to the 230 youngsters who had enrolled. ''I told them
why I went and what I got out of it,'' she said. ''When I came to summer
school, I had only once been here before -- at an Open Day. The school
boosted my confidence. I was taught learning techniques, made new
friends, and came to terms with the hugeness of the place. I advised
pupils to stick at it and reassured them that there is no working-class
stigma in the university.''
Another who shared her experiences with the summer school students was
Gillian Brown, a former pupil of Possilpark Secondary in Glasgow, now
closed. Made of the same strong stuff as Vicki -- injured for two and a
half years, she came back to play basketball for Glasgow and the West of
Scotland and now coaches -- Gillian was the first pupil of Possilpark
for seven years to go to university, where she is just one archaeology
pass short of graduation in social sciences.
''My Highers weren't quite enough,'' she said, ''so I went to summer
school; but I would have gone anyway -- I wanted a head-start. I got
used to the volume of people and my nervousness disappeared. I talked to
this year's summer school about social sciences -- don't buy all the
recommended texts and be prepared to get a good seat in the library,
because there's a lot of research to do.''
The school runs for ten weeks from mid-June. The first week introduces
students to the university and its ways. Thereafter four subjects,
including English language, are studied at first-year university level
until the final week, when those students requiring a good report to
gain admission see their tutors for interviews, tests and assessments.
For William Dunn, the senior lecturer in education who has directed
the school since its inception, it is ''all about social justice. It's
pure philanthropy -- we are on moral high ground here.'' He feels that
''our reports can be more accurate predictors of performance than
Highers -- we're talent spotting''.
He sees the summer school offering other advantages. While it is
running, one-third of students change their planned courses. It also
acts as a clearing house -- students who can't be placed on their chosen
course may be offered alternatives. Moreover, summer school is not just
about school pupils. Places are allocated to adults with non-traditional
qualifications who can be deemed to be socially or economically
deprived, and to others who have already embarked elsewhere on science
or engineering courses.
One of the most popular subjects at summer school is psychology. This
high level of interest continues to be reflected in degree choices, with
around 900 students following psychology courses. For summer school
purposes, lecturer Margaret Martin has widened the focus. ''We don't
just stick to the first-year curriculum or restrict it to clinical or
abnormal psychology,'' she explained. ''This year we are concentrating
on memory. The students do applied work in the labs and have full access
to the Internet.''
Graeme Baillie from Gleniffer High in Paisley already has a place at
Strathclyde University to take a BSc in computer science and psychology.
''I came here for a good start,'' he said. ''I have gained an insight
into different subjects, learned about exam procedures and the structure
of courses, met a lot of people and found out where everything is and
how the system works.''
Helen Nicholas from Blantyre High, who wants to teach English, came to
summer school still needing an A and a B pass for admission to an
English Literature course. ''I never knew what university life was
like,'' she said, ''and I had never visited the campus. The psychology
we are getting is magic -- it really opens your eyes. I love it here,
though some might find the essays and research a bit forbidding.''
Joanna Mulvaney, from John Ogilvie High in Hamilton, originally wanted
to be an actress but now her ambition is to be a political researcher or
modern studies teacher. She has just completed fifth year but already
knows that she wants to attend Glasgow University -- ''It's the one you
hear about all the time and it feels like what a university should be''.
Hoping to study politics and sociology, she found summer school highly
enjoyable. ''The first week I wondered if I'd like it. Now I feel at
home -- it's flexible, you're not spoon-fed.''

ANDREW POPPLE refuses to mince words over the family diet.
WHAT creates in us our likes and dislikes about food, our addictions
(mine is chocolate, given the chance) and our
would-not-touch-it-with-a-bargepole phobias? They can develop very early
in childhood, and are very individual, with no obvious reason -- except
perhaps as with an uncle of mine who will not touch a roast potato. As a
child he was forced to eat all his Sunday dinner; he saved the best bit
-- roast potato -- until last, but on one occasion was too full to eat
it all. The resultant anguish over something he wanted to eat but
couldn't has stayed with him for 60 years.
Watching our two children eating, it is interesting to see the
preferences. Our girl will want mostly vegetables, will eat them first,
and is utterly adamant that she does not like animal fat of any kind. As
long as the fat is taken off, she is quite happy with white meats. Red
meats are very reluctantly taken. In total contrast, our son is the
family carnivore. Anything is fair game, but in the event of a temporary
lack of cow, dinosaur, giraffe etc, he will gaily tuck into the rest of
the dinner, vegetables (in moderation) included.
I am happy not to push the issue too far. Few meats are free from some
doubt over additives, what the creature was fed on, what disease it
might pass on to us, what nasties are living on it or in it. Similarly,
fruit and vegetables seem to owe more to chemical warfare than
horticulture -- genetically engineered, sprayed, treated, picked
immature and aged rather than ripened. Which will do you less harm? You
pays your money and you takes your choice.
So far our daughter's preference is based on taste and is not
emotional or political. It is not a reaction to the production of meat
-- relating to the animals, being against possible cruel living
conditions and so on. She knows where our meat comes from, relates to
the animals in the fields as its source but is sanguine about their
fate. On television it is not uncommon to portray families with
vegetarian children. Preparing individual meals to cater for each
preference is seen as funny. Tedious would be my word for it. Perhaps we
have this to come, but as it is, we have no need to resort to parallel
meals. I slant the ratios of meat and vegetables, and everyone is happy.
Neither of our children has a diet so unbalanced that it is of concern,
and mealtime battles are rare.
However, it is essential to keep one step ahead in this game. I am
currently researching interesting vegetables and ways of serving them
for my forthcoming opus The Courgette and I.
Meanwhile, the kids have a saying: ''Flap, flap, splat, dinner is
served.'' This relates to an episode a few years back when one morning
we found a dead pheasant at the foot of our sitting room windows. The
poor beast had flown, or been blown, into them and had broken its neck.
They were intrigued to find we could cook and eat the bird -- it had
been dead no more than an hour before we found it -- and we did! It was
delicious.
The townie dad had a whole new experience plucking and so on, and the
children had an ''as it happens'' anatomy lesson, identifying, and
examining the various organs and where they fitted. Did it put them off
the roast pheasant? Not in the slightest. Having the head as a table
decoration just about did it for my wife, however.

As the parent of a Down's syndrome child, Brian Wilson has welcomed
recent debate on testing for the disease, but stresses there is more
than one choice for those determining the fate of unborn babies
THE Lord works in mysterious ways. If He had wished to elevate the
debate about testing for Down's syndrome, even unto the pages of Hello!
magazine, then there was no surer course than to bestow an extra
chromosome upon young Domenica Lawson.
Dominic, the proud dad, is a magazine editor with strong opinions and
impeccable social credentials. To his credit, he has used both to
attract an enormous amount of attention to the ethical questions which
have been crying out to be asked about the presumed desirability of
pre-empting the birth of the great majority of children with the same
condition as his and mine.
By dint of being godmother to the new arrival, the Princess of Wales
has entered the drama. Hello! breathlessly reports: ''The Princess could
transform attitudes to the thousands of babies born in Britain each
year, suffering from Down's syndrome.'' Presumably by a wave of her
magic wand.
Hello! somewhat exaggerates the client group which may benefit from
the Princess's powers to influence. New arrivals of Down's children are
not counted in thousands, but in a steadily diminishing number of
hundreds. In England and Wales the number has dropped between 1982 and
1992 from 513 to 383. The trend in Scotland is similar; with just 58
born last year.
There is a very straightforward explanation for the reduction in
numbers which has nothing to do with ''cure'', of which there is none.
The simple fact is that more than 90% of suspected Down's pregnancies
are terminated. Medical science continues to devote much brain-power and
substantial resources to improving upon this remarkably high
strike-rate.
The debate which has developed in recent weeks is, I believe, healthy
and welcome -- not least because people with differing views have felt
moved to join in. Ethically or pragmatically, it is not a
black-and-white issue and nobody should pretend that it is.
I do actually believe in choice and certainly have no wish to
interfere in other people's right to exercise it. But choice without
balanced information is a false concept. And if all the information
coming at prospective parents of a Down's syndrome child is based on the
thesis that this is a disaster which can and should be avoided, then the
degree of ''choice'' involved is actually very limited.
Few people give much thought to the possibility of having a Down's
syndrome child, and the dilemmas it may give rise to, until the reality
is upon them. Why should they? My wife and I certainly didn't and all
the views which we hold on the matter have been formulated in the light
of subsequent experience.
We didn't know until Eoin was born that he had Down's. That cut out
any dilemmas. But we can now testify that it has, in our case, been far
from a disaster and we think that people in the same situation should
have access to some such positive thoughts and images before making a
difficult decision. It really is as simple as that. Who can argue
against it?
Quite a lot of people, actually. For an industry is growing up and
based on the demand for earlier and more sophisticated tests. As things
stand, the only point of these tests is to identify in order to
eliminate. If fear of the unknown is replaced by a more balanced
understanding, then the demand is inevitably going to diminish.
At the moment, frankly, that is a pious hope. The heavy pressures are
in the other direction. Science is looking for earlier, easier, more
accurate tests to identify ''risk'' or certainty of Down's syndrome. And
why stop at Down's syndrome? Well they don't, of course.
It was reported last week: ''An advertisement is about to be launched
by a British company telling readers of a women's magazine that they may
be among the two million people in this country who carry the gene for
cystic fibrosis, a chronic disorder of the lungs and digestive system.
''The advert, by University Diagnostics based in South London, urges
them to buy a test that establishes, on the basis of a mouthwash sample
sent off in an envelope, whether their future children may develop the
disease as a result of 'quirks of inheritance' if both parents are
carriers.'' The growth of such tests over a whole range of conditions
has prompted the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and
Technology to demand a regulatory body covering companies that offer
genetic testing.
That would be an advance. There has to be some control exercised over
companies and other interests -- which include the more commercially
minded wings of some NHS Trusts -- which are essentially trading in the
manufacture of irrational fear; a product which can always be disguised
behind a smokescreen of concern for the anguish and concern which the
poor parents might otherwise suffer.
With Down's syndrome, ''progress'' has moved faster and further
without any select committee hitherto interesting itself in the
implications. Perhaps that is because people with Down's syndrome are
identifiably different. It has been easier to sell the idea that, to put
it bluntly, getting shot of them altogether is a great mercy for all
concerned. That strategy, remember is now more than 90% effective.
The debate generated by Dominic Lawson's article has thrown up a lot
of interesting sub-plots. The mere fact that he and his wife are not
short of a few bob has encouraged some writers, including Clare Rayner
-- who should know better -- to take the populist line. It's all right
for the Lawsons, she wrote in essence. They can afford it. But what
about the poor people who have to bring up a Down's kid? And what about
society which has to carry ''the burden'' after mum and dad are gone?
Here indeed is a pernicious line of argument -- that the less well off
you are, the greater the irresponsibility of bringing a kid with Down's
into the world. Society, we are thereby invited to conclude, has no
obligation to redress the economic balance in favour of that child, from
the cradle to the grave. On the contrary, it is the parent's duty to
spare society a potential burden. Swallow that line of thinking and you
are on a dangerous journey, which certainly does not end at Down's
syndrome.
I decline many requests to write articles or take part in programmes
on this subject, because I have no wish to become a professional Down's
parent. There is always the danger of appearing to wear on my sleeve
something which I certainly do not feel belongs there. I suspect that
Dominic will also, quite soon, decide that he has done enough
campaigning on this matter to last for a while.
During the past couple of weeks, however, I have written and spoken
about it quite a lot. For this was indeed an opportunity, perhaps for
the wrong reasons -- Princess Di and all -- to put across that simple
message which I think we owe to our children and to people who might
face a choice that they have not at this moment ever contemplated.
The aim is not to preach or cajole, but simply to suggest: Check out
the 10% before joining the 90%. There are two sides to the story and I'm
very glad that we ended up on the one we did. For the time being what
matters is that at least the debate exists.

The help of young people has been enlisted to enquire into the health
of the Moray Firth and raise awareness of it, reports AILEEN LITTLE.
A PROJECT which was underway on the shores of the Moray Firth this
summer should help answer the plea made by Magnus Magnusson in the
foreword to his book The Nature of Scotland. All those concerned with
the future of Scotland's natural heritage, he urges, should ''take
better care of it for the sake of the unborn future''.
Writing specifically about Scotland's rich coastal waters, the
chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage goes on to acknowledge that modern
times put traditional marine resources under increasing pressure --
which is why, as an important habitat for cetaceans such as dolphins and
porpoises and birds including guillemots, razor bills and eider duck,
the Moray Firth is the focus of a three-year SNH project.
But Scotland has another resource -- children. Towards the end of the
last school session, SNH formed a partnership with the Scottish Museums
Council and the Crown Estate to enlist the help of young people
inquiring into the health of the Moray Firth. They were invited this
summer to take part in a co-ordinated recording project.
''Using schoolchildren as well as members of the public fits in with
our own educational materials; we hope our resources will encourage
schools to join in,'' explains Inverness-based SNH project officer
Rachael Harding-Hill. Called Ocean Watch, this short-term project is
designed to raise awareness about the need for wise usage of the Firth.
For its part, the Scottish Museums Council is keen to become more
actively involved in promoting environmental awareness. ''People think
of museums as final resting places, but they have a significant role to
play in their community's perception of the local environment.
''In the seventeenth century museums were investigating places, going
beyond the limits of the building,'' points out Stephen Mora, assistant
curator of Inverness Museum and the person responsible for co-ordinating
the involvement of 10 museums and historical centres along the 250-mile
Firth.
Each centre -- such as the The Buckie Drifter Fisheries museum and
Groam House in Rosemarkie -- has mounted a ''starter'' exhibition about
the shoreline, including a handling collection and books on
identification. In addition, members of the public are invited to choose
from five surveys dealing with such issues as human activity, evidence
of dog whelks (numbers indicate the extent of toxic anti-foulants
painted on the base of boats) and marine debris.
''We want fishermen, the sailing fraternity, school classes and
families to share their environment with us,'' explains Stephen Moran.
''We all have a degree of knowledge which are are trying to formalise.''
Ultimately, copies of results will be sent to the Marine Conservation
Society for inclusion in its national shoreline database.
Sadly, delay in procuring funding has meant that surveys were not
available until a few weeks before the end of last session -- and
returns are due by the middle of next month. Teachers keen to
participate were faced with the choice of cramming an outing into busy
end-of-term schedules, organising an outing over the holiday, or
tackling a survey immediately on their return next session.
Tony Thornton, head of science at Raddery School for children with
special needs, chose the first option and set out to investigate marine
debris. ''Here in Fortrose, we're only three minutes from the beach. By
doing a survey of the beach, the boys can learn more than by simply
walking along it. My main criticism is the bad timing.''
One of Thornton's pupils, 14-year-old Alex Watson, reports finding
''mostly cans, plastic bags, balls and a pair of shoes. The beach isn't
very clean''.
Crown Primary School in Inverness has a nature club led by parent and
local dentist Richard Castro ''We made a start and plan to continue
after the holidays,'' he says. His group studied a section between
Alturlie Point and Fort George measuring strips of sand and gravel. This
work was repeated elsewhere on the shore during the vacation by David
McAllister, head of biology at Tain Royal Academy.
A founder member of the Highland Biological Recording Group, he
devoted a day to helping children conduct surveys. His afternoon party
carried out pollution surveys, while the morning group of 32 five- to
eight-year-olds searched for marine life. Eight-year-old Theo Watssman,
from Tain's Craighill Primary, is proud of his contribution: ''I found a
crab in seaweed, some dog whelks, winkles and a mussel. It's a very good
idea.''
At Groam House, curator Susan Seright is enthusiastic about the
educational implications of the scheme. ''It's extremely worthwhile.
There are seals, dolphins and porpoises in the Moray Firth, so it is
relevant for us to be involved in natural history. I'm keen on the
community aspect, too -- we have visitrs from oral history groups.''
At the end of last term, she admits that she failed to foresee the
difficulty posed by secondary school classes taught in 40-minute blocks.
''I had hoped the surveys would fall into the Friday afternoon 'leisure
activity' category.''
Not withstanding a number of problems, however, the Scottish Museums
Coucil is pleased to have launched what it believes is the first
environmental initiative in the field of education -- a good example of
schools working for the wider community.
New threats (such as the infamous PCBs) face Scottish wildlife on land
and sea and it is not known if the environment can be rid of them. One
important safeguard is to encourage the next generation to protect
habitats, while appreciating, using -- and benefiting from -- Scotland's
heritage.

Am I alone in feeling an utter lack of sympathy with the manner in
which Alison Hargreaves met her death?
Should I pretend not to notice the unnatural way her husband talks
unemotionally about the wife he'll never see again? Can there be a flaw
in my character as I walk round a hole in the road acknowledging the
obvious danger?
If my wife walks up the centre lane of the M8 then tells me next week
she'll attempt the Kingston Bridge at four o'clock on a Friday
afternoon, how do I react? Tell my children she's a heroine? Aye,
that'll be right!
Selfishness belongs to the immature, for life with your children is
far too important and exciting in itself to be bothered with mountains
and potholes.

IT completely baffles me how a woman columnist for The Herald cannot
''understand'' Alison Hargreaves's need to climb over-riding her need to
be with her children (August 19).
Has Margaret Vaughan absolutely no idea that some women have a burning
desire to achieve feats outwith the conventional role? Even in 1995 very
few women have the talent or are allowed to achieve ''great things.''
Alison Hargreaves wasn't a wife and mother who liked to climb, she was a
climber first.
This must be a very difficult time for those who loved her and who
will not see her again, but she had what most men, gifted or otherwise,
take for granted, a supportive partner who makes it possible for them to
lead a happy domestic life and who is understanding enough to give them
the freedom to achieve what they will.
Instead of questioning Alison Hargreaves's priorities, surely women
should number her as one of the special members of their sex.
Mr Ballard must have understood very well the kind of partnership he
was entering into and in my opinion the children are with the parent who
is best equipped to cope with their needs.

FOR all the brave futuristic talk about the Internet and the
information superhighway, most of us still get our news and background
information from newspapers. That Scotland still has four daily
broadsheets which combine international, national, and local news is one
of its great blessings.
As Alf Young argues (August 18), no good would come of the Scotsman,
the Press and Journal, or The Herald being bought by London operations.
If they agree on nothing else. Scots of all political persuasions must
surely concur that Scotland, with or without an assembly, is
sufficiently different to require the services of an independent quality
Scottish press.
The traditional rivalries of the four city states must not be allowed
to obscure the seriousness of the issue.
I do not know enough of the economics of newspapers to understand why
the staff of the Scotsman and the P&amp;J are not contemplating management
buyouts or whether the Scots Tory group led by Professor Ross Harper can
mount a serious bid for the Scotsman.
But I know enough about the centralising tendencies of the British
state, the ignorance and arrogance of London ''medians'', and the
difficulties of maintaining a quality press to be fearful of yet further
erosion of Scottish intellectual and cultural life. A few pages of
tartan tack-on to an essentially London product will not suffice.
How are we to preserve an autonomous Scottish press? There are obvious
reasons to be concerned about one Scottish publisher owning three of the
four serious dailies (and the one quality Sunday paper) but if a single
company will allow those titles to be controlled by people who know and
care about Scotland then it is an opinion that should be seriously
entertained.

THE Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the
Right Rev. James Harkness, yesterday launched an appeal to raise #1.5m
for church-based community projects in needy areas.
The Priority Areas Renewal Foundation has been set up, despite
criticism of the church's refusal to accept National Lottery funding.
At yesterday's launch in St Paul's Parish Church, Provanmill, Glasgow,
Mr Harkness denied it was a ''gamble'' to try to raise such a large sum
when the church had already turned down the opportunity of lottery cash.
Last month, the Rev. Dr William Morris, Minister of Glasgow Cathedral
and one of Scotland's senior churchmen, questioned the Kirk's stance,
and said it was up to individual congregations to decide if they wanted
to apply for money.
The General Assembly voted to veto lottery money earlier this year
when it was decided it would be ''inappropriate'' to apply for
Millennium Fund money to mark a celebration of Christ's birth.
Mr Harkness said yesterday: ''We are not taking a gamble, we are
presenting a challenge to the church and the whole community and they
will respond. This way we can help people to help themselves rather than
doing so from the top down.
''There is no confusion over the church's official stance on the
lottery. The General Assembly has spoken and it is not for me to
contradict it.''
Announcng the new scheme, Mr Harkness said: ''The General Assembly
gave a very clear direction requiring the appeal and those directly
involved to address the material needs of communities wherever they are,
but also remember there are spiritual needs as well.
''This partnership should be for the good of the community,so that the
community can in turn be good for itself.''
It is hoped the #1.5m target will be raised by congregations and
adminstered by a central fund committee, which will include
representatives from Methodist, and possibly, Roman Catholic churches.
The appeal was started with a #1200 donation from Dalgety Parish
Church.

You devoted three full pages, including front-page headlines, to the

She did no more than succumb to an egotistical drive which led her
onward and upward to her death. This addiction-gone-wrong scenario isn't
fair on Alison Hargreaves's children. As for her husband, all we get
from him is some stupid Tibetan ''she died a tiger'' saying.
All in all this sorry story serves as a timely reminder that for

ALF YOUNG correctly describes recent attacks on Caledonian Newspapers
as vituperative and his analysis on the need for some form of Scottish
media control of the Thomson Regional Newspapers titles up for sale is
similarly accurate (August 18).
However, there are two predominant strains to this issue -- the
editorial independence of the newspapers, preferably under progressive
Scottish ownership, but also the jobs and conditions of the employees
involved.
Any merger between Caledonian and TRN would immediately put under
threat jobs in all departments across the six titles involved. There
would also be a long-term threat to the wage levels of journalists
employed in The Herald and Evening Times.
While running the risk of accusations of fronting a self-interest
group, I believe both of the aforementioned strains can and should be
protected in this so-called Scottish media Sale of the Century.

CHEESE maker Humphrey Errington was fuming last night after a food
hygiene expert claimed his company had been prosecuted for selling
contaminated cheese. He said: ''This is just not true and I will be
seeking legal advice.''
The outburst came on day six of Mr Errington's court battle with
Clydesdale District Council, which is seeking an order to destroy
#27,000 worth of Lanark Blue, made from unpasteurised ewe's milk.
In court Mr Errington had heard Dr James McLauchlin give evidence that
he had sent his personal CV ''around the world'' to back up his claims
that he was an expert.
The CV describes how he had been called in February to give evidence
in the ''prosecution of the manufacturer of Lanark Blue because of
contamination by listeria monocytogenes''.
Mr Michael Jones, QC, acting for Mr Errington, pointed out that this
was not true.
In February a JP sitting in private granted the council the power to
destroy a batch of the cheese because it allegedly contained
unacceptable levels of listeria. But Mr Errington fought a legal battle
to win a fresh hearing. He has never faced prosecution in connection
with his cheese.
Dr McLauchlin is a clinical scientist in charge of the Food Hygiene
Reference Unit at the Public Health Laboratory Services in London. In
evidence, he said yesterday: ''I apologise to Mr Errington.''
The case continues.

I FEEL sorry that the 50-year anniversary of the end of the war is
being sidetracked by the squabble over Japan's responsibility to the
former prisoners of war.
Of course Japan should apologise and pay compensation, but after 50
years I cannot see her ever doing that.
I would prefer to celebrate the end of the war by remembering our
Servicemen with pride. We seem to forget that the 14th Army in Burma
soundly defeated the Japanese. They took them on in their own ground,
held them, stood up to them, and then completely defeated them. There
was no other theatre of war where the Japanese were so soundly beaten.
I would therefore like to remember all those involved in the war
against Japan with pride and with honour. They all did a fine job, in
very difficult circumstances and came out of the conflict with honour.

Paris
A SUSPECTED Algerian Muslim militant was detained in Sweden today for
questioning over bombings in Paris that have killed seven people and
wounded more than 100 in the past month.
Abdelkrim Deneche, believed by French investigators to be a leading
member of Algeria's Armed Islamic Group (GIA), was detained in Stockholm
at the request of visiting French anti-terrorist magistrate
Jean-Francois Ricard.
On July 25, a bomb killed seven people and wounded 86 in an
underground train in the Saint-Michel station in central Paris, the
bloodiest attack in the capital since 1986. Last week, a new blast
wounded 17 people by the Arc de Triomphe.
Investigators are concentrating on theories that Algerian extremists
were responsible for both attacks.
Meanwhile, an opinion poll shows that most French people fear for
their safety after the two Parisian bomb attacks, but trust the
centre-right government to combat terrorism.
The poll for Le Parisien newspaper showed that 58% of French people
were either very or fairly afraid for their safety.
The survey also indicated that 69% had confidence in the government of
Prime Minister Alain Juppe ''in the struggle against
terrorism''.--Reuter.

Glasgow University offers a new degree of hope to those who missed
out, reports Geraldine Abrahams.
FOR the first time ever, the University of Glasgow is to offer people
who lack conventional higher-education qualifications the chance to
study part-time undergraduate courses which could lead to a
university-level award.
The initiative is the result of a project set up with funding supplied
by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) and is based on
a policy perception that there should be greater availability for people
to take university degrees.
One way of achieving this is to increase the types of delivery offered
so there would be more flexibility, allowing people to study for degrees
on a part-time basis out of normal hours.
The University of Glasgow has always had a flexible system for people
doing full-time degrees, allowing the transfer of subjects, but anyone
who wanted to do a part-time degree -- while it was theoretically
possible -- could only attend through the day.
There is nothing new in part-time degree courses, but the programme of
study starting this year is the first stage in introducing courses
largely for evening study, and providing courses that are either the
same or equivalent to existing undergraduate studies.
A large proportion of these will be recognised as qualifying courses
for degrees. They include Astronomy and Physics, Classical Greek
Civilisation, Computer Studies, English and Scottish Literature,
European Languages, Psychology, and Geography and Geology.
''In a sense they are 'access' courses because there is a minimal
entrance qualification -- you don't need Highers,'' explains Dr James
MacDonald of the Department of Adult and Continuing Education. ''In many
instances the applicants will be interviewed so that they know what they
will be taking on and so that they can be advised as to the benefits for
them. A conventional pre-university access course might be suggested if
they do not have a sufficient background or educational base to cope.''
The programme, starting in October, should appeal to people who
achieved their Highers some time ago and have retained an interest in
theoretical or practical learning, as well as those with a strong
informal background in a subject but who have no Highers.
The courses taught in the evening will have Scottish Credit
Accumulation and Transfer Scheme (SCOTCAT) credit ratings. In many cases
they will be the same courses taught to full-time students during the
day. One obvious drawback is that, where it takes one year to achieve 40
credits in one subject on the daytime course, the evening equivalent
will take two years.
Also, while full-time students will study three subjects
simultaneously, it is unlikely that a part-timer would be able to
consider more than two courses at a time. Recognising that this
timescale might deter some would-be students, the university has built
in further flexibility. ''We understand that some may want to exit
before completing the whole degree but would like something to show for
their study, so we have introduced 'sub-degree' qualifications,'' says
Dr MacDonald. ''Having achieved the equivalent of first-year
qualifications, the student would receive a Certificate in Higher
Education.''
Even if they do not complete the certificate, part-time students will
be able to ask for a transcript of the passes they have achieved and
could use this on their CVs.
One advantage of this new part-time study is its interchangeability.
Because it is the equivalent of the daytime undergraduate courses, a
student who has completed 90% of a full-time ordinary degree study
programme and has difficulty in finishing on that basis, will be able to
complete it part-time.
The converse is also true. Where others might start the degree on this
part-time basis, they may choose to complete it full-time, during the
day.
Unlike full-time students, those choosing to study part time will
generally have to fund the study themselves. The assumption is that most
people who choose part-time evening study are in work; but fees are
relatively low, generally between #120 and #200 per course, per year.
Accepting that not everyone can afford the fees, the university will
provide bursaries to meet the needs of some.
''We appreciate that there are people who are out of work or on
benefit who would have difficulty in meeting fees and incidental
expenses like buying books and travel,'' says Dr MacDonald, ''so the
university has some money set aside -- a part time incentives grant --
for supporting part-time work.
There may be room for some cynicism in all of this, given that SHEFC,
the Government-run funding body, has been involved in this project from
the early stages. Running part-time, self-funded undergraduate courses
will increase the numbers of graduates in the country without a
proportionate rise in the funding budget.
Whatever the motive, there can be no doubt that increased flexibility
and wider opportunity must be of significant benefit not only to
individuals but to society as a whole.

A SCOT involved in the arms-to-Iran affair, questioned last month by
Customs and Excise in Glasgow, last night expressed his anger at the
refusal by his interrogators to hand over tapes of his interview.
Mr John Anderson, a 64-year-old former banker in Glasgow and London,
said he was bemused, and believed the inquiry could end in a
''whitewash''.
At the end of July Mr Anderson, from Balloch but now living in the
north of Scotland, was called to Glasgow by the Investigation Branch of
HM Customs and Excise. For the period of questioning he was placed under
arrest.
When it was over, he was told he was ''unarrested'' and he returned
home to Fort Augustus.
Around the same time, his former business colleague, Mr Gerald James,
was undergoing similar questioning in London.
The two men claim their interrogators were interested in two lines of
inquiry.
One was whether they possessed evidence that proved one of their
companies, British Manufacture and Research Co, a firm based in Baroness
Thatcher's home town of Grantham, traded illegally in arms with Iran.
The other centred on the role of former Chief Secretary to the
Treasury Jonathan Aitken, previously a BMARC director.
No charges were levelled against Mr Anderson and Mr James, a merchant
banker, at the end of the interviews.
In a letter to Mr Anderson's solicitors, Customs and Excise said that
because the case potentially involved multiple defendants, it was not
general policy to provide copy interview tapes to the defence until such
time as a specific defendant had either been charged, or informed he
would be prosecuted.
The letter added: ''As neither of these circumstances currently apply
to Mr Anderson we will not be providing copies of the tapes to you at
this stage. If Mr Anderson's circumstances change then you will be
provided with the copy tapes forthwith.''
Last night Mr Anderson said: ''It was explained to me how the tapes
worked and I was promised copies -- the custody officer even offered to
do them there and then. The Customs and Excise investigators then said
they would take care of it and I cannot help feeling this has resulted
in a total whitewash.
''Perhaps they decided we named too many names and I am very angry
because I believe we are being picked on for telling the truth.''
He felt he had now reached ''a state of limbo''.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said he was
concerned the emphasis still seemed to be on suppressing the
significance of what the two men had to say, rather than investigating
it.
''I don't understand why it took Customs and Excise all these years to
interview two men who have never sought to disguise the fact they were
involved in contracts with Iran.
''The crucial point is that if Ministers had initiated these inquiries
at the proper time, the Scott Inquiry would inevitably have been about
Iran and BMARC as well as Iraq and Matrix Churchhill.''
Last month's detention of Mr Anderson was his second encounter with
the authorities.
He had previously been taken from Fort Augustus by two police officers
and driven to Glasgow and put on a plane to Gatwick. A police car taking
him to Ramsgate was involved in a collision with another vehicle.
The next day, shaken and injured, Mr Anderson, who served in the RAF,
was questioned before being put on a flight home. He is still pursuing a
settlement from the police in connection with the incident.
No one at Customs and Excise in Glasgow was available for comment.

I would like to congratulate you on your editorial, Challenge of the
mountains (August 18).
As a climber and hillwalker of 45 years' experience I don't think I
have ever read a more sensitive and thought-provoking account of a
mountain accident and of the attraction of the mountain scene to an
ever-increasing number of people.

I MUST agree with what Gordon Graham says about the achievements of
the XIV Army being forgotten once again (August 15).
It should be remembered that General Slim welded together an army
containing British, Gurkhas, Indians, and Africans of all religious
beliefs, but serving the British Crown.
As far as possible their own type of food was supplied along with
ammunition, etc, by air drops on sites arranged by radio,
The XIV Army was scattered over hundreds of miles with battles raging
from the Arakan to Kohima or Moqurg and the crucial one of Mandalay and
Meiktila in March, 1945. No wonder General Bill Slim's victory in Burma
is recognised as one of the greatest of the Second World War.
During the campaign men of all religions fought together for the cause
of peace. How sad it is that 50 years after VJ Day we still have men of
different religions disturbing the peace of the world by fighting among
themselves.

THE VJ-Day commemoration has been overshadowed by two important
factors, the atomic bombs and the treatment of POWs.
Gordon Graham brings to the attention of the public the fact that the
14th Army fought in terrible conditions and completely crushed the
Japanese Armies in Burma (August 15).
The Indian forces in the 14th Army have been recognised and praised
but I have seen no mention of the two West African divisions and
one-and-a-half East African divisions. Their part in the victory cannot
be ignored.
Bill Slim's book, Defeat into Victory, gives due honour to our British
soldiers and their comrades in arms.

WHAT a footering, bletherskite to go looking for bike or byke in a
Concise Oxford Dictionary (August 18). That's a fushionless thing to do.
One book to turn to is Chambers Scots Dictionary where bike and byke are
shown -- W E Thornley from Helensburgh would have found both words and
meanings.
We had a wasps' bike in the back here a week or so ago and the council
mannie came out to see to it for us. In conversation we used the phrases
a wasp-bike and a wasp-bink. No-one tried to do any spelling, but we all

ROBBIE Dinwoodie is wrong on a point of fact when he states that
persons who died before polling day in the 1979 referendum on Scottish
devolution counted as having voted No (August 12).
The number out of which 40% said Yes had to be obtained to pass any
amendment to the Scotland Act was reduced below the number on the
electoral role specifically to avoid this effect, as Robbie Dinwoodie
would have learnt had he bothered to ask me about this point.
I have long ago ceased to expect accuracy in British journalism, which
seems to me to bear the same relationship to journalism proper as
British sherry does to the real thing.
But I still cannot get used to the fact that journalists and their
editors and sub-editors have so little sense of shame in getting facts
wrong.
My old professor, Sir Lewis Namier, was proudest of the tribute
someone paid to him as a historian: ''Lewis, when all the facts are
known, you will need to add but you will not need to correct.''
Is it too much to hope that our journalists should seek the same
tribute?

JOE CARLIN is now rightly enjoying the chance to put across his case
(August 15). The difference is that those -- and there are many in
Monklands -- with a different opinion can have their views made public
as well, something the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser had stopped
practising until its new editor arrived.
If Mr Carlin concedes that letters are ''invariably biased towards the
author's opinions'', how can he justify the non-publication week after
week of scores of letters, including mine, which challenged the
Advertiser's bias and yet which never saw the light of day?
How can he defend the dropping abruptly of the MPs' coloumns -- again
happily restored -- precisely when John Smith became Leader of the
Labour Party?
Mr Carlin wonders ''Who might have been frightened?'' by these
letters. I would have thought that those who watched the hideous
behavour, amounting to open hatred, outside Airdrie Town Hall on the
night of the Monklands East by-election would have no difficulty in
answering the question.
Such fears were not lessened when the Advertiser, admittedly less so
again under the new editor, published pages of photographs of sectarian
marches. Mr Carlin would no doubt defend this on the grounds that
marches are almost ''invariably biased towards the marchers' opinions''.
What did the Advertiser think this was doing for the image of
Monklands?
If we are to believe that Mr Isdale, Ms McAuley, and now Mr Eric
Wright, have just been ''promoted'' would it not be wise for those now
running this paper to ''promote'' Mr Carlin as well? Readers would then
perhaps believe that the stable had been truly cleaned out and that the
real ''Monklands Mafia'' had been removed.
The most startling part of Mr Carlin's letter was the assertion that
''the reason why the Black Report and the Advertiser's original
accusations remain unanswered is that they are true''. How partisan can
he be? Not even Professor Black claimed that everything fed to him was
true.
Finally, Mr Carlin says I should have declared an interest. The
reality is that I was not a member of Monklands District Council during
the three years of damaging and distorted journalism that I have
described, nor was I a member for the period covered by the Black
Report.
The interest I do have is as a citizen concerned about the future of
my community, a concern which is clearly not shared by those who have
done so much to besmirch its reputation.

I ACKNOWLEDGE my indebtedness to Andrew Brocklehurst for his amendment
of my estimated Scottish population without emigration from 1981 to 1991
(August 18).
The amended figure is 15.7% of 5,103,935 (805,525) plus natural
increase of 60,000 and 612,597 born outside Scotland. With a reasonable
economy, the population of Scotland would be over 6,612,598 with a
labour force of 2,705,679 instead of 2,407,188.
Scotland is a country with relatively no racial or religious
prejudice: an addition to our labour force of 298,491 workers born
outside Scotland is more than welcome in the context of full employment,
it would reduce taxation and improving services.
Since the Scottish people has no interest in policing the world and
competing in the arms race, our contribution to the family of nations
would be positive: full employment without emigration would enable us to
ensure a more peaceful world by financing projects of human development
in the Third World.
An economy with 27% of the workforce unemployed or underemployed and
805,525 emigrants seeking work elsewhere as proved by the 1991 census
fuels my sadness at the continuous destruction of the Scottish economy
since 1707.

IT has been a long, long time from May to now. They have been
lengthiest months. Ageing is how they have been. Sometimes the V days
have felt like yesterdays from a nearly new calendar. Oftener they have
seemed to belong to another aeon in a different place. At other times
there has been a wonder whether they happened at all.
There have been so many old faces recounting the deeds of young faces,
except they are the same faces.
Nearly always were fags sticking out of them. Nicotine was a staunch
ally. How to explain that to anybody who wasn't there and to whom l945
might as well be halfway back to medieval times is a teaser.
Even language is a barrier. Reminiscence has to run a blockade of
terms which have become as ancient as the spear and the pike.
Doodle-bugs, displaced persons, demob suits . . . What are you on about,
greybeard? Gie's peace.
Even more dating is to relate everything in the past half century to
how it occurred after what young people abbreviate to WW2, meaning what
some of us insist on calling the war.
''That would be just after the war,'' you say to them. They looked at
you askance, if anybody does look that way any more, or ever did.
Whatever else the V celebrations have done, they have ended the way of
looking back that made l945 into a year dot. There can be no more of
that. As for trying to label events as having taken place before the
war, the gum does not stick. Pre-war is practically pre-history. Popular
memory is so short now.
But VJ Day remains extra epochal when it coincides with a big-little
and bright-black day in your own life. This year's bumper amount of
looking back has been laid on top of what it is hard not to kid myself
may be feelings of maturity.
Old age, they say, just comes. You wake up one morning and you've got
it. You know so because kind people insist on saying how well you look.
You should reply that if a year had l5 months in it, you'd be one fifth
less ancient than the record books show.
But it slips the mind to say so, as much else slips. You are reduced
to following the rule that if you can't remember something, then forget
it.
One wartime memory that had escaped the memory was the expression for
the duration. Rationing and other joys of the six years were often
imposed ''for the duration of the war''. They'd last until it was all
over.
Echoes of the phrase have been stirred by a new little book, World War
II In Renfrewshire, whose publication brightened the weekend's
fireworks. In a glossary Moira Burgess, the author, revives the
expression, while she exhumes also demob suits for young readers. They
were clothes supplied to service personnel to go home in. ''They were
not high-fashion items,'' the book observes coolly.
Moira Burgess, novelist and short story writer, recalls how it became
a catch phrase in general use. For an instance she quotes: ''Are you in
that bathroom for the duration?''
If Renfrewshire's slice of the global conflict may seem thin, it was
rich. Erskine Hospital is in the old county. Hess landed there. It was
the fledgling nest of the RAF's 602 squadron. At Lobnitz's shipyard in
Renfrew the floating piers for the Normandy landings were created.
Greenock deserves much attention for the battering it took.
For one day in May after an air raid in l941 the Greenock Telegraph
had to be produced by hand. Its one-page edition was pasted around the
town on walls. ''Greenock is thought to be the only place in Britain
where this was done,'' Moira Burgess writes.
Her World War II in Renfrewshire (#4.95; Renfrew District Council)
uncovers that even Lochwinnoch had its war secrets and keeps some of
them. An unexplained number of air crashes happened on its surrounding
hills. Wreckage of a Wellington bomber that hit Box Law on an
undisclosed mission was later blown up and buried.
After another crash on Queenside Hill, white heather was said to have
grown on the site for two years.
Two other shire mysteries have still to make print 50 years after.
They have to do with the rumoured parts played in Renfrewshire's war by
Lord Haw-Haw, whose whimsical broadcasts from Germany were meant to
demoralise the nation, and by Randolph Scott, the square-jawed hero of
many cowboy pictures.
Haw-Haw is said to have put Paisley into the front line. Allegedly, he
made it a primary target of a German invasion for the strategic reason,
he claimed, that Paisley had seven women for every man. And according to
county folklore, Randy Scott was the officer in charge of a negro
battalion encamped outside Renfrew.
True or false, both tales sounded worth a look. But however long, long
a time it has been since May seems not to have been long enough. Now
battle fatigue has set in and it is only sensible to let well alone for
a while, or even for the duration.
My new maturity says forget it. For last week, otherwise not half bad,
had a birthday in it, another birthday. For the first time the thought
occurred that the candles would cost more than a cake. But thanks for
the unsigned card with the sweet violet on it, whoever you are.

Srinagar
A DEAL to secure the freedom of two British hostages held in Kashmir
could be on the table, following reports that India is ready to make
concessions.
Three of the 15 jailed militants whose release has been demanded by
the extremist Al-Faran group holding four Westerners could be freed,
according to an Indian Government source.
Two other militants could be released with them, said the source,
quoted by the BBC.
The news appears to be the most positive development in the seven
weeks since Keith Mangan and Paul Wells were kidnapped from a camp site
while trekking in the troubled mountain region.
The move would represent a climbdown by the Indian Government, which
until now has constantly refused to meet the kidnappers demands.
A BBC correspondent said the release would be made to look like a
routine event and it would take at least a week before the men were out.
A spokeswoman at the Indian High Commission said they had no
confirmation of the BBC report.
''We've always said that no militant will be released in exchange for
the hostages,'' said Mrs Hema Bhagirath.
She said the government had been conducting a dialogue with the
kidnappers to persuade them to release the hostages safely.
Fears for the Westerners' lives became acute after Al-Faran murdered a
fifth hostage and threatened to execute the rest unless their demands
were met within two days.
However the deadline passed with no new horrors, and Indian officials
say they have been assured by the kidnappers that the four men are safe
and well.
The governor of the state of Jammu and Kashmir has ruled out use of
force to free the hostages, saying diplomacy was the best hope for their
release.
''The government has no plan to launch a military operation to secure
the release of the four abducted tourists,'' said Governor K V Krishna
Rao.
Officials were optimistic that the four would be freed unharmed.
''It looks hopeful, but it has had its ups and downs,'' a spokesman
for Jammu and Kashmir state told reporters.
He said the government talked with Al-Faran guerrillas holding the
hostages last night.
''We have been maintaining contact with the kidnappers,'' the state
government spokesman said. ''We have made repeated appeals to them to
set free the hostages.''
He said the government believed the four were safe, but had not yet
received the photographs and tape recording it had requested as proof of
their well-being.
India has repeatedly ruled out swopping jailed militants for the
hostages.
Asked today to comment on speculation in Srinagar that an exchange was
being considered, the state government spokesman said: ''I wouldn't like
to comment on a swop at this stage.''
In December, 1989, separatist guerrillas abducted the daughter of a
former Indian home minister. She was released five days later in
exchange for five jailed separatists.
However officials said Kashmir's separatist revolt, in which police
and hospital sources say more than 20,000 people have died, had not
erupted at that time and New Delhi was now under greater pressure to
refuse such a swop.--Reuter.

DAIRY clerkess Janice Wilson had every reason to feel like the cat
that got the cream yesterday.
She collected a cheque for #3.8m from the organisers of the National
Lottery at its Glasgow office.
At her side was husband Alan, a fishing boat skipper, who had cut
short a trawling trip to join her for the cash catch.
The couple, from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, were clearly stunned by
the size of their haul, which makes them the biggest named National
Lottery winners in Scotland.
Mrs Wilson, 26, said: ''I have not had time to think about it yet. It
has all come as a bit of a shock.''
The couple have played the Lottery since it began, and Mrs Wilson
staked #5 on Saturday's rollover jackpot game, choosing the numbers at
random.
''I checked the winning numbers on Teletext at about ten past eight
and my initial reaction was total disbelief.''
She contacted her husband who was on the fishing boat Cardiva in the
North Sea, north-west of Shetland, to try to give him the good news.
Mr Wilson explained: ''We spoke on the ship-to-shore radio link, but
the line was very bad. She said that something very nice had happened.''
It was not until he took the boat into Orkney and called her from a
payphone that he finally confirmed they had won the big one. Instead of
sailing with the boat on the final leg home from Scrabster to
Fraserburgh, he hired a helicopter.
The couple have known each other since schooldays and married a year
ago.
Mrs Wilson was one of five people who shared Saturday's #19.1m
jackpot.

card designs depicting scenic landmarks, offers a top prize of #10,000.

THE object of yet another bus bomb in Israel is the destruction of the
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. That much is obvious,
especially as yesterday's incident is the latest in a long line of
outrages which have killed scores of people since the peace agreement
was signed in September 1993. The key question is whether the Israeli
public will be so angered by the violence that they will exert
sufficient political pressure on Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to force
him to delay the process indefinitely. The other part of the equation is
whether the Labour Government in Israel will be so damaged by
association with a discredited peace process that it will lose the
general election due in November of next year to a Likud coalition which
is hostile to the peace process and does not feel bound by the
agreement. Interestingly, the caller who claimed responsibility for
yesterday's bus bomb for the Islamic militants of Hamas said that their
campaign would last until the Israeli elections. These are fairly basic
calculations, but there is nothing more basic or brutal than a bomb.
The stage of the peace process which is being negotiated at the moment
is significantly behind schedule. The many delays, which have added more
than a year to the timetable, are largely because of the complexity of
the issues involved, although there is no doubt that a small proportion
can be ascribed to the aftermath of terrorist attacks. After the last
bus bomb at the end of July the talks were postponed for six days, yet
the wider context illustrates the fact that Israel has been tardy in
reaching agreement on an expansion of Palestinian control in the West
Bank precisely because of security fears. The agreement reached in Oslo
in 1993 provides for a redeployment of Israeli troops out of some
Palestinian towns and from certain areas of the countryside around them.
This will be followed by a Palestinian election, hopefully before the
end of the year. The irony in all this is that both sides, after
fretting over the security issues and other aspects of the agreement for
so long, suddenly realised in recent weeks that if progress was not made
quickly the entire edifice might tumble. The resulting accelerated talks
have now been brought to a temporary halt because of the latest bombing,
which is in itself a clear acknowledgment by the militants of progress
in the talks.
The basic realities remain simple. People are dying because militants
want the peace process to fail. The reaction by both the Israeli
Government and by the Palestinian peacemakers is heartening. Both sides
appear determined to ensure that the talks will continue and that they
will succeed. Israeli Government spokesmen have made clear the fact that
the suspension in talks which was imposed after yesterday's bombing will
be very limited. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres underlined this approach
when he said that time was needed for mourning. He might have added that
time will be needed for the shock of this latest attack to fade.
Yet, whatever the level of determination to press onwards, both
Israelis and Palestinians know that total security is a myth and that
further attacks are certain. The Israeli people know this too, and it is
to their credit that throughout these assaults on their society a
majority of Israelis questioned for opinion polls have spoken in favour
of the peace process. Israel is a very small country and the pain which
these talks cause is not easily apprehended by us. What is clear is that
the process must continue; without it the future will be even worse.

THE first fruit of Mr Michael Forsyth's attempt to open a dialogue
with other sections of Scottish opinion -- other than the Conservative
Party and business community, that is -- is a paper from the STUC which
will be presented to the Secretary of State this Thursday. It is a
cogent and reasonable document which deserves a serious response and
will probably get one, even if all of its recommendations are unlikely
to be endorsed. It really is, for example, most unlikely that the
Government would establish a new Scottish investment bank. This has been
a constant proposal, in different contexts, from left-wing groups since
1945 and some have been created -- the giant Investors in Industry,
floated only two years ago, was an early example of this sort of
institution which succeeded on an enormous scale. Others were less
successful; but the key point is that Scotland is already awash with
financial institutions anxious to lend and with the capital to do so. If
the STUC really means state-subsidised capital for new enterprises, that
could be another matter (though it might encounter difficulties with
Brussels) but cheaper money generally could be even more beneficial. The
paper's opinion that the Secretary of State should be backing the
Chancellor's stance on interest rates is a good example of where they
might enjoy a joint effort. Scotland's economy would be a major
beneficiary of cheaper money.
It is probably easy for the two parties to agree on such general
points, and on the STUC's declared view that the Scottish economy is too
narrowly based and dependent on too few industries, even where the
latter are successful, like whisky and electronics. It will be harder on
specifics such as the need to protect the National Engineering
Laboratory at East Kilbride (where the STUC is broadly right) and the
Tate and Lyle sugar refining business at Greenock where prospects for
survival are slim. In both cases there are fundamental disagreements of
principle involved. There ought to be none, however, to prevent Mr
Forsyth endorsing the suggestion of a Scottish Labour Market Research
and Development unit -- there is a need for objective data in this, and
indeed other areas of Scottish economic life. The same degree of
collaboration surely also applies to training where unions have special
knowledge as well as interests in encouraging improvement.
On taxation there is little chance of the difference between the two
being bridged. The STUC's views about the role of taxation in investment
are not likely to command much acceptance outside the Labour movement
(and not always even there) and a shift back from indirect to direct
taxation would be a non-starter even if this paper were being presented
to a Labour Secretary of State: Governments throughout the Western world
are encountering ever-growing resentment to higher direct taxes on
income, even though there is plenty of demand for the services taxation
funds. The switch to indirect taxes is irreversible (and vital to the
running of the EU, for example) but it should still be possible to
protect the poor from their worst effects (by continuing zero rating VAT
on essentials like food).
Yet apart from the obvious areas of disagreement there is something
refreshing about this report -- it represents a genuine attempt at
discussion. It is not a mere string of declarations and assertions
expecting to meet a similar response; and it would be a pity if that
were its fate. Mr Forsyth's new departure was intended to address the
unavoidable weakness of a Government which speaks for only a minority of
the Scottish people, and a small minority at that. It has to persuade
and it has to compromise. That is admitted in theory; Thursday's talks
may show how far it can work in practice.

Bombay
BOMBAY, home to 12 million and India's financial capital, has been
renamed Mumbai after a Hindu goddess.
The name change was ordered by a Hindu party, the Shiv Sena, that in
March won control of Maharashtra state.
''Mumbai harks back to a past that is glorious, '' said Bachi
Karkaria, the Bombay Times editor. ''Bombay, on the other hand,
represents grit, gumption, and a go-getting spirit that's perfectly
suited to the present and future.''
It is not clear whether the change requires approval from the federal
government.
The change really applies only in English. The city always has been
Mumbai in the Marathi language of this region. The word Bombay was first
used by the British in the late 17th century.--AP

ABOUT 70 jobs are expected to be lost at Littlewoods Pools' operation
in Glasgow, because of competition from the National Lottery.
They are among 520 redundancies announced by the company yesterday,
and come on top of nearly 600 job losses announced six months ago.
It is expected that most of the 70 staff affected at the company's
base in Hillington will be casual employees. The firm says it hopes many
of the redundancies will be voluntary.
In addition, the company intends to close its Cardiff operation in
November, with the loss of 320 jobs, and to reduce its workforce on
Merseyside by about 130.
Managing director Colin Thwaite said: ''The National Lottery has had
an adverse impact on our business. We have had to fight on unequal
terms.
''Although the Government has made some concessions, it has been too
little and too late, with the consequences we publicly predicted more
than a year ago.''
He added: ''These have been very painful decisions, and we will give
the employees affected every help to find new employment.
''Our employees have given us their full support in all our business
initiatives, and we deeply regret that some of them will not be able to
share in the continuing success that we confidently predict for
Littlewoods Pools and its customers.''
Despite intense competition from the lure of big multi-million pound
National Lottery prizes, Littlewoods still receives about 6,500,000
coupons each week.
Public affairs spokesman Mick Casey said: ''We estimate that
12,000,000 people have a regular interest in the Saturday football
results. But faced with the reduction in income caused by the National
Lottery, and our commitment to maintaining the same level of prize
money, we have reluctantly been forced to shed jobs and cut costs.''
The limited concessions from the Government had included allowing TV
advertising for the pools -- several months after the National Lottery
enjoyed this advantage -- and a slight cut in betting tax.
''Since the launch of the National Lottery, we have been making
repeated representations to the Government to get fairer competition. We
shall continue to lobby Ministers on this crucial issue,'' added Mr
Casey.
The job losses announced yesterday will cut the company's workforce to
about 2200. The latest redundancies are in addition to almost 600 job
losses announced in February, about 80 in Glasgow.
Camelot, operators of the National Lottery, said it was sorry to hear
of job losses, but had always believed there was enough room in the
market for both pools and lottery.
A spokesperson added: ''Indeed, the National Lottery has been good
news for the pools, in that there have been a number of changes in the
law which have benefited them.''
Meanwhile, Camelot plans to increase its top scratchcard prizes to
#100,000, or more, and sell its cards in every pub and club. Trial sales
have started in 75 licensed premises throughout Britain in a bid to
increase flagging turnover on scratchcards, now down to #29m a week,
compared to around #63m to #65m spent on the National Lottery.

Goma
Thousands of Rwandan refugees among them the blind, lame, and infants,
fled camps in Zaire today to avoid forced repatriation while Zairean
troops expelled more than 2000 by dumping them on the border with
Rwanda.
Cheering and waving rifles, Zairean soldiers made no secret of their
joy at seeing the Rwandans go, dragging a man on crutches over the
border as terrified refugees watched and barefoot children scattered in
panic.
Peter Kessler, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), said 26,000 Rwandan refugees had abandoned three camps near the
eastern Zairean town of Uvira and fled into the hills to avoid being
forcibly repatriated.
Zairean troops in the Uvira region forced 400 refugees into Burundi
and 100 into Rwanda, while soldiers in the border town of Bukavu forced
200 more back into Rwanda.
Further north, refugees were forced out of Mugunga camp near Goma town
to a border crossing, where they were manhandled off buses and trucks in
no-man's land leading to the Rwandan town of Gisenyi.
UN officials said 400 Hutu refugees crossed from eastern Zaire into
north-west Rwanda this morning and by late afternoon 1600 others were
abandoned in no-man's land.
Zaire said it would ignore a letter from the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, Sadako Ogata, asking it to stop expelling Rwandans.
''Tomorrow we hope to speed things up,'' said Mutiri wa Bashara,
refugee adviser to Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, who is under strong
opposition pressure to resolve the refugee crisis on Zaire's borders.
Some one million Rwandan Hutus fled into Zaire a year ago after the
Hutu-led government and army -- responsible for the genocide of a
million Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- were defeated by rebels of the
minority Tutsi tribe.
Defeated Hutu soldiers are also holed up in the Zaire camps, refusing
to return out of fear of being arrested or attacked in revenge for last
year's massacres.
Zaire began to deport the refugees on Saturday, expelling more than
200, and said it would keep doing so daily until the United Nations took
responsibility for their return.--Reuter.

DAVID GAHAN, leader of the top-selling British band Depeche Mode, is
recovering in hospital today after trying to commit suicide.
Police responded to an emergency call at the singer's Los Angeles home
last Thursday and found he had slashed his wrist with a razor blade.
''He sustained a in laceration to his wrist,'' said Detective Joel
Brown. ''It wasn't like he was dying.''
Gahan, 33, is being evaluated for mental competency at Los Angeles'
Cedars Sinai Medical Centre, Brown said.
Depeche Mode, best known for songs such as ''Just Can't Get Enough''
and ''Personal Jesus'', have sold millions of records and packed

Ferozabad
THE death toll in India's worst-ever train crash rose to at least 335
today as Prime Minister Narasimha Rao blamed human error for the
disaster.
Rescue work outside Ferozabad station was continuing 36 hours after
the Purushottam Express smashed into the back of the stationary Kalindi
Express while travelling at 60mph early yesterday.
Army rescue workers sifted through the twisted steel strewn around the
railway embankment, collecting remains from the wreckage.
A railway official said 320 bodies had so far been recovered from the
crash, and another 15 to 20 bodies remained inside the mangled shell of
a carriage still to be cleared.
Rao, in charge of the railways in the absence of Minister C K Jaffer
Sharief, who is in London for medical treatment, ordered an inquiry into
the crash.
''Prima facie, it is a human error but the real cause will be known
after the inquiry,'' he told Parliament.
Angry opposition MPs demanded Rao's resignation in a six-hour debate
on the crash.
Senior railway officials said a signalman had given the Purushottam
Express a green light without checking whether the other train had left
his sector, and the guard of the Kalindi Express had failed to switch on
a flashing light to indicate his train had stopped after hitting a cow.
The Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted Northern Railways general
manager V K Aggarwal as saying the signalman who gave the green light to
the express had fled.
Parliament passed a motion of sympathy for the relatives of the
victims and stood in silence as a mark of respect for the dead.
Several coaches on the Purushottam Express from the pilgrim town of
Puri in eastern India were filled with soldiers, and officials said
there were at least 68 army personnel among the dead. Sixteen young
athletes returning from a training camp also died.
India's previous worst train accident was in 1981 when 270 people were
killed after a train plunged into the Bhagmati River in the northern
state of Bihar.--Reuter.

THE large oil terminal at Nigg on the Cromarty Firth is to get a new
lease of life transferring crude oil from the Alba field between
tankers.
Oil from the North Sea field, which lies 124 miles north-east of
Aberdeen and is operated by US firm Chevron, will be taken to Nigg in
small tankers where it will be loaded into larger vessels for export.
The Nigg terminal was built in the late 1970s to handle oil coming
through the pipeline from the nearby Beatrice field.
However, its output has declined to just one tanker-load each month.
An additional twelve tankers a year will use the terminal for exporting
Alba's output.
A similar number of vessels use Nigg for exporting oil from the
Gryphon Field in the Moray Firth, in a deal struck last year.
BP said yesterday it was confident that the trans-shipments, which
will start next month, could be done without risk of pollution, after it
had commissioned independent safety reports.

TOUGHER entry requirements for teacher training courses were announced
yesterday by the Scottish Office.
From the year 2000, candidates for places on the BEd or postgraduate
certificate of education courses to become primary teachers will need
Standard Grade mathematics at the top credit level.
Presently they need a credit or lower general level Standard Grade in
the subject.
Ordinary degree graduates seeking admission to the one-year,
postgraduate course to become secondary school teachers will need to
have studied the subject they plan to specialise in for three years at
university, rather than the two years presently specified.
The announcement came after an extensive consultation exercise on the
main proposals for the entry requirements for teacher education courses.
The deputy general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland,
Mr Fred Forrester, said: ''Improvements are always to be welcomed but
the practical implications have to be looked at.
''We want to know how many existing entrants to teacher training would
be excluded under these arrangements but we have not had an answer from
the Scottish Office.''
The number of teacher training places is controlled each year in an
effort to match demand for courses with vacancies in schools.
* Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson yesterday announced a
#750,000 training package for careers teachers aimed at improving the
advice and information schools provide to youngsters.
Careers teachers and librarians in secondary schools will benefit from
the initiative, which is part of an #8.5m funding package for careers'
education and guidance.
Mr Robertson said: ''Poor information or advice from teachers can lead
to school leavers choosing the wrong jobs or education and training
courses.
''A poor choice when leaving school can leave a young person
demoralised and dispirited.''
Over the next three school sessions careers teachers would be able to
receive training to update their knowledge and skills, he said.

A MEMORIAL to one of the bloodiest atrocities in Scotland is to be
unveiled nearly 200 years after the event.
Twelve people were killed and up to 20 injured by regular cavalry
units during the Tranent Militia Riot of 1797, which was sparked off by
the Government's decision to introduce a militia -- a form of compulsory
military service -- into Scotland.
Regarded as ''Scotland's forgotten massacre'', it will be remembered
on September 2 with the unveiling of a 10ft bronze statue, commissioned
for Tranent by East Lothian District Council, in the town's Civic
Square.
It depicts local woman Jackie Crookston who is said to have led a mob
through Tranent before the riot, beating her drum, and calling on people
to stand up for their rights.
Local councillor Tom Ferguson said yesterday that this was ''a
politically important as well as bloody episode'' in Scotland's history
and the subject of a cover-up at the highest level.
''It is now fitting that the events surrounding the massacre will be
remembered and the lives lost marked in such an appropriate fashion,''
he said.

<HEADLINE>Council warns US not to ship waste to Dounreay</HEADLINE>

HIGHLAND Regional Council has written to the US Department of Energy
warning it not to consider shipping nuclear waste for reprocessing at
Dounreay until sources of radioactive contamination at the Caithness
plant have been properly identified and remedied.
It also warns that any move to send waste would become a source of
considerable political conflict.
The region's director of law and administration, Mr Harold Farquhar,
wrote to Washington following reports in The Herald on July 20 that a
consultation process was being conducted by the Department of Energy
over 60 days into what should happen to highly radioactive waste from
research reactors across Europe and elsewhere.
The American public have been asked to consider three options:
acceptance and management of the foreign reactor spent nuclear fuel in
the US; facilitating such management overseas, most likely at Dounreay;
or a combination of the two.
The consultation period ended last month but the Department of Energy
agreed to accept comments from Highland Regional Council after the
closing date.
In his letter to Mr Charles Head, of the Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel
Management at the Energy Department, Mr Farquhar says Highland Regional
Council has concerns about Dounreay, as the planning authority and in
its wider political role.
He writes: ''Concern has, for example, emerged with regards to
standards of waste accumulation and management, with particular
reference to the feature known as the 'Dounreay Shaft' and to the Low
Level Waste Pit System.
''There has been further recent adverse publicity regarding the
identification of instances of environmental pollution which may also be
linked to the issue of the shaft.
''Such concerns have been raised as a matter of business before the
full council and are the subject of further investigation by the
appropriate regulatory bodies.
''The uncertainties in respect of the shaft and environmental
pollution have led the council to conclude that no negotations on
further reprocessing at Dounreay should take place until all such
matters are properly investigated and remedial actions put in place.
''The council will be seeking assurances from the UK Government that
remedial work will be started as soon as the most appropriate options
are ascertained.
''It must also be said that, in addition to the council's basic
concern at the prospect of continuing reprocessing, many members have
strong reservations regarding the whole question of the importation of
foreign fuels.''
Mr Farquhar adds that the council hopes to have an early meeting with
the appropriate regulatory bodies. It had also resolved to examine the
planning issues.
He continues: ''It is not at this time clear that Dounreay has all the
necessary statutory permissions to undertake the work that may be
offered and obtaining such necessary permissions will almost inevitably
attract the closest public scrutiny and debate, with the possible
prospect of potentially lengthy public examination of the issues and, at
this stage, no guarantee that such permission can be obtained.
''Even if the permissions were obtained, all the evidence is that
political activity at a local and national level would continue, making
the matter one of open, public conflict over a protracted period.''
A spokesman for the Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay told The
Herald last night that he could not comment on a letter he had not read.
He stressed, however, that the reprocessing work that was being
considered had been a feature of the plant's activities for nearly 40
years.

DOGS do not scare off burglars, according to a bank, and it has
scrapped plans to bring in cheaper house insurance for owners.
Research by Barclays shows that there may be a sign saying beware of
the dog, but thieves seldom do.
Barclays already gives lower rates of home contents insurance to
security-conscious householders with window locks, alarms and those who
are members of neighbourhood watch schemes.
It decided to investigate whether households with dogs are broken into
less often in order to become the first insurance firm to extend the
discount scheme to dog owners.
Its study found that the burglary rate for homes with dogs compared
with those without was negligible: just 2%. Twelve percent of dog owners
have been burgled, compared with 14% of households without dogs.
A bank spokesman said: ''We do offer discounts on home contents
insurance for a variety of reasons, so we decided to see if having a dog
might also lead to a cheaper rate.
''However, we found there was no real difference to speak of, just 2%
which is not enough for us to offer doggie discounts.''
The bank is warning people who may buy a dog simply for security.
''Dogs make great pets and can truly be man's best friend. But people
should think twice about getting a dog just for protection,'' the
spokesman said.
''A dog is not a substitute for good locks on all doors and windows
and an approved security device.''
Mr Alan King, assistant marketing director of Barclays Financial
Services, reinforced the warning. ''There are people who believe that
Fido is a good alternative to installing an approved security device and
taking out a home insurance policy.''
Its research also disclosed that 41% of Britain's 22 million
households have a dog or have had one in the last five years.
The most popular are mongrels, kept by 26% of dog owners.
Preferred pedigree breeds include collies, labradors, alsatians,
Yorkshire terriers, Jack Russells, and golden retrievers.

THE Scottish Office is to make it easier for councils to set up
special zones where planning procedures are simplified to help promote
local business development.
There are at present only four Simplified Planning Zones -- in
Coatbridge, Dingwall, Grangemouth docks, and Alness/Invergordon. The
complicated procedures which have been needed to establish such zones
have been identified as the main disincentive.
SPZs grant planning permission for specified types of development
within a zone, rather than for each individual development.
In future, councils will not be legally bound to hold a public local
inquiry when a zone is set up. Instead, they will be able to consider
any objections themselves or appoint a person to consider the objections
for them if they think a full local inquiry would not be appropriate.
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch said the new SPZs could make
planning procedures easier for businesses and could be a useful tool for
councils to promote particular areas for development.
They were often used as part of a package of measures to help urban
regeneration.
Mr Kynoch said the new procedures aimed to encourage both local
authorities and developers to bring forward planning proposals.

Charles Kennedy finds himself in strangely familiar surroundings in a
little corner of Estonia.
THERE is part of a far, foreign field that is forever -- Scotland. As
the former Soviet Baltic state of Estonia prepares to commemorate the
fourth anniversary of its independence, another celebration is being
planned in the country's capital, Tallin, to mark the second birthday of
the city's popular Scottish Club. Soti Klubi, it seems, has captured the
mood of the new, self-confident Estonia.
''Estonians just love your whisky,'' explains the club president, Awar
Ravam, a real-estate dealer. This summer he will lead his second
planeload of intrepid Estonians on something of a ''whisky pilgrimage''
to Scotland. Toivo Lepik, the Klubi's managing director, confirms the
attraction of our greatest export, detailing with pride the 75 different
whisky brands arranged around the agreeable bar.
It seems that some healthy collaboration between the president and the
MD (whose architect wife runs a high-profile building restoration
business -- projects including the presidential palace and the national
parliament building) has helped achieve the quite remarkable outcome
which is this cosy, secluded, but highly popular venue. The club is set
in an attractive strip of land adjacent to the ancient fortified city
walls; it's rather like securing planning permission for a bistro
beneath Edinburgh Castle. A small putting green with St Andrew's flags
in the holes is under construction.
The club has certainly been attracting the movers and shakers of the
capital city. The Prime Minister and the British ambassador feature as
members. On my afternoon visit I came across an Estonian member of
parliament.
Clearly the club has God on its side. It was blessed on day one by His
Holiness the Pope. The Pontiff's Baltic excursion took the Popemobile
past the front door of Soti Klubi.
The club and its rapid success are testament to the growing links
beween old Scotia and the new Estonia. Post independence, a division
from the tartan army turned up in town a couple of years back to see the
Scottish football team triumph; more than a few still seem to be here.
Independence in Europe and the Scottish team winning have proved an
irresistible elixir for diehard nationalists like Phil Lawrence from
Buckie (exploring publishing opportunities regionally) and Chris McLean,
the SNP's former head of communications, now engaged to a local lass and
developing a travel business. I hope that Alex Salmond is pursuing an
Estonia foreign registration drive.
I was amused to learn that the Estonian national musical instrument is
the bagpipe.
The Scottish input is also apparent on a more official level. Scottish
Enterprise is represented here by Stephen Hall -- his role being to
advise the Estonian Investment Agency. Strathclyde Police have been
helping with some law and order training locally.
Her Majesty's Britannic Ambassador, the majestically titled Charles R
L De Chassiron, tells me that the only serious headaches he's had over
the Scottish-Estonian link have come when some of our number have kicked
up a rumpus over a refusal to accept Scottish pound notes. Since I could
take you to shops in Westminster where a similar complaint could be
made, this seems not too fundamental a problem.
I also took our man in Estonia's advice over that formidable gantry of
whisky around the bar. Soti Klubi may constitute Scottish soil
spiritually, but even the visiting political drinker does not enjoy
subsequent diplomatic immunity. Still, at least my self-control leaves
all the more whisky for the second birthday party, which club members
seem unlikely to be able to remember.
* Charles Kennedy is the Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and
Skye.

<HEADLINE>Blair faces renewed fight over all-women shortlists</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976765079</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night faced pressure to retain the
controversial women-only shortlists after the next General Election.
His plans to drop the idea could face opposition, the Shadow Minister
for women, Ms Clare Short, warned.
Ms Short insisted that there was ''a chance'' that the shortlists
could remain in place, and said it would take more than one attempt to
transform the face of Parliament.
Mr Blair said in an interview with PA News last month that the process
had ''not been ideal'' and claimed it was strictly a one-off experiment.
The shortlist is designed to ensure that women candidates are selected
to fight half of all marginal seats, in an attempt to increase
dramatically the number of women MPs.
The system, already under threat in the courts from disgruntled
would-be male candidates, has been strongly backed by leading women MPs.
Ms Short appeared to add to the problems facing Mr Blair over a long
summer in which restless Labour left-wingers have accused him of
adopting Kremlin-style tactics in party management.
She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One there was a worldwide
recognition that democracies were incomplete and political parties
distorted through a lack of women representatives.
''Mr Blair must speak for himself. He is not backing away from it now
-- we are going through it for this cycle -- what he has said in one
interview with the PA is we might not repeat it in the next cycle and we
may not. We will look at it again.
''The failure to have women in Parliament in equal numbers is part of
the inadequacy of democratic representation in the world,'' she said.
''What we are saying is we should have an equal chance for men and
women, half and half in different regions of the country, so that in our
next round we will have equal numbers of men and women coming in, and if
we do that a few times it will transform and improve the British
Parliament.''
A spokesman for Mr Blair made it clear that, although the policy would
be reviewed formally after the election, the leadership remained opposed
to continuing it.
Mr Blair told PA News last month: ''It was always seen as a one-off
process and these arguments are by and large being settled and we are
manging to work by consent.''
The Labour leader yesterday resumed the holiday he broke for VJ Day
commemorations, leaving his deputy, Mr John Prescott, to warn of the
danger of too much open dissent and ''unhelpful criticism'' of the
leadership style.
He said the party did not want to ''shut down debate'' but warned that
the Tory high command was waiting to seize on every show of disunity.
''We do want to say to some of our colleagues: do remember we are in
the propaganda season and the Tories clearly intend to use their
remarks, however unhelpful or perhaps not intended in that way, to best
propaganda effect,'' said Mr Prescott.
However, the thinly-veiled dispute over women's shortlists once again
highlighted the simmering discontent over the pace of change in party
policy that could yet undermine Mr Blair at the Labour conference in
Brighton in October.

CUSTOMS officers and police yesterday seized spirits and beer worth up
to #200m, and made more than a dozen arrests, in what they believe to be
Britain's biggest excise duty fraud.
Around 250 Customs officers, aided by police -- some armed -- raided
38 premises, including cash and carry outlets, bonded warehouses, and
private addresses across London.
Officials believe the drink, marked for tax-free export only, was
destined to be sold on the domestic market without taxes having been
paid. The potential loss in duties to the Inland Revenue is estimated at
more than #100m.
The operation, codenamed Fluke, was the culmination of a
two-month-long surveillance exercise.
Transport companies were also targeted and several commercial vehicles
were seized. It is understood the drink was destined for distribution
through a chain of cash and carry spirits outlets around London.
The alleged fraud involves drink being purchased from legitimate
producers and stored in bonded warehouses. Documents are then falsified
to indicate it has been exported. In fact, the goods are moved around a
succession of warehouses before being channelled to outlets across the
capital.
It is then sold on at normal prices without duty being paid by the
distributors.
Commenting on the investigation, Mr David Heathcoat-Amery MP,
Paymaster General and the Minister responsible for Customs, said: ''This
successful operation underlines our determination to crack down on those
carrying out such frauds against, not only the taxpayer, but also
legitimate businesses.''
The inquiry is continuing, a Customs spokesman said.

AMBITIOUS plans by the Edinburgh International Festival to convert
this nineteenth-century church into its headquarters were yesterday
unveiled to a wider world audience.
Taking advantage of the global media in the capital, festival
organisers organised a tour of the grade-A listed Highland Tolbooth,
only a stone's throw from Edinburgh Castle.
The festival is to seek lottery funding of #3m towards the #7m cost of
converting the kirk, once the home of the General Assembly of the Church
of Scotland. It is in partial use as a cafe and souvenir shop but
organisers hope to create a round-the-year arts attraction, which could
also be used as a conference centre, and provide administration and
ticket offices and a home for the Festival Club.
It is hoped to begin work next year with the building reopening in
1997 to mark the festival's 50th anniversary. Lothian region and
Edinburgh district councils are to be asked for #250,000 and some
#500,000 has already been pledged by Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise.

THE GRIEVING mother of catering assistant Deirdre Kivlin, whose
decomposed body was found last week dumped in a drain behind an
Edinburgh tenement, yesterday branded her killer ''a cruel, vicious and
twisted person''.
Mrs Ruth Kivlin sat calmly at St Leonards police station -- a few
hundred yards from where her daughter was found -- and sent this message
to the killer:
''I don't know how you can live with what you've done. You are a
danger to other people, and for your own sake you ought to give yourself
up.
''There was absolutely no reason to do this to her and leave her in
such an appalling way.''
The body of 24-year-old Ms Kivlin -- well known for her community work
as well as her role as a karaoke singer under the stage name, The Voice,
at clubs and pubs -- was found by workmen last Thursday in a drain
beneath a manhole cover behind tenements in South Clerk Street.
Ms Kivlin left home in Greendykes Drive, Craigmillar, on July 8, and
it has now been established that the last sighting of her was around
1.40am the next day, about 30 yards from where her body was found.
She was seen standing alone at the corner of Newington Road at West
Preston Street, close to the Goodwill Chinese restaurant.
Her mother, 56, accompanied by her son, David, 29, told a news
conference on the fourth day of the investigation that her daughter had
loved life and was always smiling.
''She just wouldn't do a bad turn to anybody. She loved her drama,
music and karaoke and she was only happy when she was helping in the
community.
Mrs Kivlin, who said her daughter had helped in nurseries and play
schemes, said: ''I knew either someone was holding her against her will
or she had been murdered.
''We were very distressed when she went missing, but for this to have
happened is horrible and very hard to come to terms with.''
Urging the public to help the investigation, she said: ''If you know
anything at all, please tell the police, so the person who did this to
my daughter can be brought to justice before another horrible crime is
committed.''
Detective Chief Inspector Ian Cowden, who is heading the
investigation, said that when last seen Ms Kivlin was alone and at that
stage wearing a beige and fawn anorak -- which had been recovered -- a
short black dress, a black blouse knotted to the front, black tights and
black, high-heeled shoes.
She was carrying a black shoulder bag, which detectives are still
trying to find.
''Deirdre seemed to be quite fond of jewellery and we have not
accounted for it all. That is a very strong line of inquiry at the
moment,'' Mr Cowden said.
He said that the young woman had died of head injuries and there was
no indication of sexual assault.

Christopher Dobson explains why Hamas and Jewish militants have common
cause in seeing the Israeli-PLO peace agreement fail
THE euphoria which greeted the Israeli-PLO agreement two years ago has
virtually vanished under the series of suicide bomb attacks mounted by
Hamas militants. Now, with each bomb, the survival of Yitzhak Rabin's
Labour government and the entire peace process becomes increasingly
questionable.
One has only to look at the fury on the faces of the Israelis,
overwhelmed by anger and grief, as rabbis pick through the wreckage of a
bus to find pieces of what were once human beings, to appreciate the
dangers faced by the peacemakers.
''Murderer,'' shout the demonstrators -- not at Palestinians but at
their own Prime Minister. He reacts in the only way he can by shutting
off Gaza and suspending, but not cancelling, the peace talks. ''We shall
continue,'' says Foreign Secretary Shimon Peres, architect of the Oslo
agreement. But for how long will they be able to do so?
There will be a General Election in Israel next year and if the latest
opinion poll is correct the Labour Party will be overwhelmingly defeated
by the far-right Likud. Well aware of the danger, Rabin is hurrying to
conclude as many agreements as possibly with the PLO leadership before
time runs out.
Only three days ago the Israeli Cabinet approved the handing over of a
range of civilian powers in the West Bank to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
authority. They include responsibility for transport, labour, mail, fuel
and agriculture and the Ministers were told that a full agreement
extending Palestinian rule throughout the region could be reached within
the month.
Then came yesterday's bomb, with the threat of more to come. If the
talks are suspended every time an atrocity is carried out, then Prime
Minister Rabin will not achieve his objectives by the time he goes to
the country. And, of course, the temper of the country will grow more
ferocious with every outrage.
Hamas, deliberately, is playing into the hands of those Israelis who
believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab. These are Israelis who
are just as fanatical as the Islamic fundamentalists. These, curiously,
are not very often the ''sabras'', the Israelis who have lived all their
lives alongside the Palestinians -- and fought against them -- but
religious theorists from America who believe that the whole of Palestine
should belong to Israel.
They were always going to oppose the peace settlement, but stood
little chance of destroying it until the suicide bombers struck. Now
they are gaining support from many who gave cautious approval to the
settlement but under the impact of the bombs have begun to fear that
they and their nation could never be safe with militant Palestinians
controlling the West Bank and Gaza and with Syria in reoccupation of the
Golan Heights.
Among them are respected men like David Bar-Illan, executive editor of
the Jerusalem Post who wrote of his doubts about the peace accord when
it was signed: ''One would have to believe . . . that the Middle East,
where there is not one democracy except Israel, can turn into a European
Community, with Jordan, 'Palestine' and Israel forming a Benelux of the
Levant. It is the kind of leap of faith which would make Scheherazade
green with envy.'' Now he has even more cause to be doubtful. It is this
ground-swell of fear among the moderates which poses the greatest danger
to Rabin.
The man who would take over if that ground-swell sweeps the Labour
government away next year is the hardline leader of Likud, Benjamin
Netanyahu. He has personal reasons for hating the Palestinians; his
brother, Yoni, led the Israeli special forces in the raid on Entebbe and
died rescuing the hostages.
He accuses Rabin of leading Israel towards war rather than peace,
arguing that the army's planned withdrawal from the West Bank would
create a base for Islamic terrorism, second only to Iran. As for the
Golan Heights, he says there has been no trouble there because the
Israeli guns are within spitting distance of Damascus and while they are
there President Assad ''does not have the option of making war''.
He is contemptuous about Gaza. He says that if Likud wins the
election, ''we will not re-enter Gaza on a permanent basis. Arafat can
keep Gaza''. His implication is that if there were any further trouble
from terrorist organisations operating from Gaza, they would be severely
dealt with.
What would Likud's policy be?
He spelt it out in a Knesset press conference: Israel would break off
talks with the PLO, reinstitute the right of ''hot pursuit'' into Gaza
and Jericho and offer the Palestinians a modified form of autonomy
limited to municipal affairs that would not give them any control of
security or territory. They would have less power than a British local
authority.
Obviously, no Palestinian leader could accept such conditions. It
would be tantamount to signing his own death warrant. Under such a
regime the peace process would inevitably collapse, which is precisely
what Hamas -- and the Israeli hawks want.
Middle-Eastern politics has thrown up many strange bedfellows, but to
have Hamas and the hawks working together for the same ends is bizarre.
Both want the peace process to fail and both are prepared to use extreme
methods to bring about that failure.
It would only be after it had been achieved that their aims would
differ. The Israeli hawks would rely on the power of the Israeli armed
forces to crush Palestinian opposition. Hamas would seek the removal of
Israeli settlers still living in the Gaza Strip, withdrawal from the
West Bank and reoccupation by the Arabs of East Jerusalem. Meanwhile,
according to Hamas leader Aymad Fallouji, the divinely ordained armed
struggle against Israel must go on.
Earlier this year General ''Arik'' Sharon, a former Defence Minister
and a leading member of Likud, outlined a draconian plan for dealing
with the Islamic terrorists. He would deport the families of the human
bombs, take action against terrorist leaders living abroad, and mount
security sweeps to seize ''wanted terrorists'' in Gaza and Jericho and
take them back to Israel for trial. Sharon, always the advocate of the
iron fist, left no doubt that he would use it if he came to power.
Asked if he was concerned that such action would destroy the
Israeli-PLO accord, he replied: ''This agreement is supposed to provide
security, but instead it brings bloodshed and many more casualties; who
needs this peace?''
The only answer to that question is: the rest of the world.

* HAMAS, the Palestinian group which has claimed responsibility for
yesterday's suicide bombing in Jerusalem, is in the long line of Islamic
secret societies stretching back to the eleventh century when Sheik
al-Jabal, The Old Man of the Mountains, sent his hashish-eating
assassins out from his mountain fortress of Alamut to impose his will on
the Middle East by murder. They were deadly because they were not only
prepared to die for their cause but welcomed it as a step towards
paradise.
Today, the shadowy leaders of Hamas send out their assassins from the
slums of Gaza to wreck the Palestinian peace process. They too go
willingly to their deaths. And when these ''living martyrs'' die, their
families celebrate, for they have achieved immortality and their
families are honoured.
Hamas is an acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement and in Arabic it
means Zeal. The organisation came into being in the late 1970s as a
religious and cultural organisation and it did much good, providing
nursing and educational facilities in the West Bank and Gaza, obtaining
much credit among the poor, dispirited people of those areas.
At first it was tolerated by the Israelis as a counterbalance to the
secular PLO; but when the Palestinian revolution, the ''intifada'',
broke out spontaneously on the West Bank and Gaza without the help of
the PLO, Hamas provided an increasingly militant leadership for the
young stone-throwers.
With its roots in the mean streets and the villages, unlike the big
hotel and diplomatic life of the PLO leaders, it talked the same
language as the fiery young men who battled on the streets with the
Israeli army. And it was the intifada as much as any other factor that
led to the handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat.
When the PLO made peace with Israel, Hamas became more political and
more religious. It is totally opposed to any agreement with Israel.
The Israelis are finding Hamas an elusive enemy. In the old days when
a PLO-affiliated organisation such as the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine carried out an operation, the Israelis knew
where to find them. Within hours, Israeli warplanes would hurtle over
the Lebanese border and pound a PFLP headquarters.
They cannot do that with Hamas, for it has no established
headquarters, no camps with big guns and equipment to destroy -- all
Hamas needs to carry out its acts of terror are a few pounds of
explosives and a young man willing to die for the cause. It is that most
deadly of terrorist organisations: fanatical but with no infrastructure
and no expense accounts.
The ''living martyrs'' are sent to Iran and Sudan for their training
and then infiltrated back into Gaza where security is now in the hands
of Yasser Arafat's police. It is a simple matter for them to join the
thousands of Palestinians who cross into Israel every day to work.

PARENTS' anxieties about their children's safety have reached
unprecedented levels, to the detriment of parents and children alike,
according to a report published today by the children's charity
Barnardo's.
A survey conducted for Barnardo's presents a bleak picture of confused
parents who think their children spend too much time watching
television, too much time on their own, and less time outdoors. Yet most
of them are unwilling to let their children go out more often without
adult supervision.
Barnardo's says that two-thirds of parents it surveyed say that
children being approached by strangers is a big worry for them when the
children are outside.
Yet the official statistics show their fears are unfounded. Between
1983 and 1993, an average of 86 children were killed every year in
England and Wales. However, the number murdered by strangers is an
average of five a year.
The truth is that children are far more likely to be killed by their
parents or people looking after them.
Yet because of fears about strangers, many children are kept shut
inside houses, possibly arresting their development, while play areas
outside are left empty.
Other parents attempt to compensate by taking their children to
paid-for activities such as sports centres and swimming pools -- but
these activities are often too expensive for poorer families.
As Mr Hugh Mackintosh, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said
yesterday: ''Today's children, particularly those from poorer homes, are
not getting enough freedom to play independently.
''In addition, in Scotland, we found that where there are play areas,
parents don't want to let their children go to them unsupervised for
fear of bullies, strangers, and traffic.''
He says it is fundamentally wrong if children's chances of playing
safely are affected simply because of where they live. ''Children need
to be able to play independently in order to develop physically,
emotionally, and intellectually.''
Mr Mackintosh pointed out that it was not just a question of parents
spending money on their children. It was important that they also spent
time creatively as a family outdoors, which did not have to involve
expense.
While parents believe they are protecting their children by keeping
them indoors more, the opposite may be happening. Child psychologist Dr
Ned Mueller, interviewed on the subject for tonight's Public Eye
programme on BBC, states that children deprived of the freedom to play
unsupervised often fail to develop vital social and language skills.
''Our survival depends on social development,'' he says. ''We have to
take play and use it in the service of joining with other people or we
are doomed.''
One indoor play venture in Essex is even introducing electronic
tagging of children using the centre to reassure worried parents.
Apart from what is called ''stranger danger,'' parents also have fears
about traffic, drugs, and bullying. Children from poor backgrounds are
nearly four times at risk of being knocked down and killed. Some of this
may be due to them being more likely to be on the streets. Parents with
cars are more likely to drive them to where they are going.
Over drugs, parents expressed worries about children playing in parks
where there may be discarded needles lying about, or drug users around.
The survey for Barnardo's shows that 60% of parents believe that
children spend less time outdoors than they did; 93% believe their
children watch more television than they did; 85% believe safety of
children playing outdoors has decreased; and 41% believe the amount of
time a child spends alone has increased since their day.
As one parent told Barnardo's: ''Years ago, we would play outside all
the time. We played netball and hide-and-seek. We used to tie ropes
around the lampposts and use them as swings. But things have changed
now. Kids can't go outside. The traffic is terrible here.''
How much of the risks to children is real or just imagined by parents
is open to debate. However, as the Barnardo's report, Playing It Safe,
states: ''A climate in which parents and children themselves feel uneasy
about their place in the world -- their right to roam freely, even in
their local neighbourhoods or nearby parks -- is clearly not good for
children's development and independence, nor for adult piece of mind.''
Mr Mackintosh says that play schemes, after-school clubs, and holiday
clubs must be considered a priority, particularly in the poorest
communities. Local authorities should work with voluntary agencies to
help nurture a sense of community.
He also believes the business community, which spends an estimated
#30bn a year targeting children, should plough some of its profits into
communities by funding play areas.

GRETA GARBO'S confidante and live-in best friend for 31 years now
lives in poverty after being all but left out of her employer's will, it
was reported yesterday.
Claire Koger, 89, is surviving in a small fourth-floor flat without a
lift on East 66th Street, the New York Daily News said.
Garbo had promised that after her death, the Swiss-born immigrant
would be taken care of, Koger's legal guardian, Mr Richard Schmidt, told
the News.
However, the reclusive actress reportedly left Koger only #2000 from
her #20m estate, and the rest went to Garbo's niece, Gray Reisfield.
By the end of this year, Koger will be totally out of money, Schmidt
said.
Calling himself ''a huge admirer of Garbo'', he says he's not being
paid for taking on the financial dealings and emotional well-being of
the person he claims knew the Swedish-born actress better than anyone
else.
Koger reportedly screened Garbo's calls, did her tailoring and helped
the ailing star get around.
Schmidt has asked Garbo's niece and her husband for help through their
lawyer, requesting they pay half of Koger's monthly expenses. Schmidt
has received no answer to his letters, he said.
The Reisfields moved into Garbo's apartment overlooking the East River
after she died in 1990. Schmidt entered Koger's life shortly after, when
he sent her a sympathy note.--AP

WITHIN minutes of the suicide bus bomb in Jerusalem an anonymous
caller to Israel radio claimed that ''The Engineer'' had struck again.
The nickname sends shivers down Israeli spines. It belongs to Yahya
Ayyash, the master bomb-maker who has repeatedly slipped through the
fingers of Israel's army and Shin Bet secret police.
He is top of a very long wanted list. Israel says he is behind the
wave of bombings which have killed 77 Israelis and foreigners since the
1993 PLO-Israel peace accord.
He has eluded capture for more than two years and narrowly escaped
death. Not much is known about him. He is thought to be 29 years old.
At his native Rafat village, in the West Bank highlands between the
towns of Ramallah and Nablus, relatives believe Ayyash is under God's
protection and speak of him as a mythical figure.
They tell reporters fantastic stories of how he is saved by divine
intervention.
In one story, relatives describe how Israeli soldiers kidnapped Ayyash
when he was a student at Bir Zeit University. The soldiers took him to a
deserted settlement road where they tried to kill him. Suddenly,
however, three women in white clothes came down from heaven and
protected him.
Convinced that he was under God's protection, Ayyash had since
dedicated his life to what Hamas calls its holy war against the Jewish
state.
Israeli security sources say Ayyash, an electrical engineer by
education, prepares his own explosives and plans his attacks carefully.
The most notorious attack attributed to him was the suicide bombing in
Tel Aviv in October last year, in which 22 people were killed.
He has earned the name ''the man with seven souls'' for his ability to
cheat death.
Hamas activists say that his last scrape with the Grim Reaper was in
April in PLO-ruled Gaza. He left a building just half an hour before it
blew up, killing senior Hamas activist Kamal Kheil. Hamas blamed Israeli
agents for the explosion. The Palestinian Authority said it was a bomb
factory accident.
Since then, Hamas activists said Ayyash had left Gaza for an Arab
country and that his wife and child had joined him there.
However Israeli security sources say he is still hiding in Gaza.

POLICE are investigating the misuse of public funds within a community
network in a deprived East End district of Glasgow.
This follows a move, earlier this year, by the city council to suspend
Cranhill Community Council and to send in a team of auditors.
Mr Iain Drummond, senior legal adviser, confirmed yesterday that
police had been informed of the findings and that the inquiry had now
spread. ''There are various other matters now under investigation,'' he
told city councillors.
The investigation covers many thousands of pounds of funding over the
last five years. It is now believed to involve the financial affairs of
three other organisations with links to the local Easterhouse
Initiative.
The auditor's report on Cranhill was tabled yesterday at a meeting of
a city council sub-committee which each month meets to monitor community
councils.
However, there was consternation when, without prior notice, a report
from the Community Councils Resource Centre was handed round the table
to committee members. This was a response to criticism in the auditor's
report that the Resource Centre had failed to provide active monitoring
of Cranhill Community Council.
Militant councillor Charles Stevenson, who originally raised the
matter of irregularities, was refused permission to address the
committee. He lost his Queenslie ward last spring to new councillor Gail
McCann who is a prominent figure in local community organisations.
The auditor's report revealed that about #4000 of grants received by
Cranhill were ''inappropriate''. In one instance, the same amount was
duplicated, by mistake, by two funding sources.
Meanwhile, according to the auditors, much of the money flowed out
without receipts, records, or proper documentation.
The report disclosed: ''The auditors were particularly concerned by
the introduction of a second bank account for no justifiable accounting
reason and by the withdrawal from accounts of significant sums in cash
without any supportive information.''
The city-wide supervision system was criticised for a ''lack of active
monitoring''. The report said there were no attempts by council officers
to meet local office bearers or attend management meetings at Cranhill.
Indeed one city councillor who raised concern in March 1994 about the
community council was given assurances and told it was still
functioning. ''This was misleading,'' said the report.
Councillor Ken Gibson, SNP, told the meeting: ''I think it is bad that
Councillor Stevenson is not being allowed to speak. He was the man who
first raised this matter last winter.''
He then asked whose names were recorded as the bank account holders.
But Mr Drummond advised that it would be unwise legally for councillors
to go into details in public. Members he said should simply note the
report.
Councillor Christine Devine, chairing the meeting, advised him to
forward any new information to the town clerk.
In light of the information submitted at the last moment by the
Community Councils Resource Centre, the matter was continued for further
consideration.

Washington
THE American peace plan for Bosnia is in trouble. The Secretary of
State, Warren Christopher, has cut short his holiday and returned to
Washington, where he will meet Richard Holbrooke, the US official who
has been plugging the plan in the Balkans.
Three of Mr Holbrooke's colleagues were killed on Mt Igman on
Saturday, and he returned with their bodies today. Mr Christopher and
other senior officials went to the airport to meet them, and President
Clinton will return from vacation for their funeral in Arlington
Cemetery.
The accident occurred as Mr Holbrooke and the others were travelling
to Sarajevo to put their plan to the Bosnian Government.
However, the key to the failure was in Belgrade. Mr Holbrooke was
unable to persuade President Milosevic to make peace with Croatia when
they met in Belgrade last week.
Mr Milosevic refused to recognise Croatia. The essential element of
the American proposal has been that Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia should
recognise each other. If they don't, the war will continue.
The first snag the American plan encountered was that the Bosnians
were reluctant to agree to exchange the last Muslim enclave in eastern
Bosnia, Gorazde, for land around Sarajevo, which the Americans had
suggested as part of a redrawing of the partition of Bosnia.
The Serbs would be allowed to keep most of their conquests, including
western Bosnia around Banja Luka and the Drina valley, with its formerly
Muslim towns Srebrenica and Zepa. The Muslims would get the hills around
Sarajevo.
As for Serbia and Croatia, the Croats would keep the Krajina, which
they recaptured early this month, and the Serbian refugees would have to
make a new life for themselves elsewhere. The status of eastern Croatia
and its main city, Vukovar, which Serbia captured in 1991, would be left
to the future.
There were signs that the Bosnian Serbs might accept the plan, and it
was assumed Mr Milosevic would be delighted with the proposal. The war
would end and sanctions against Serbia would be lifted. The Americans
expected trouble from the Croats, who want Vukovar immediately, and the
Bosnian Government, which hopes to reconquer its lost territories by
war. The US hoped, perhaps wrongly, that pressure from Washington and
Europe would bring Croatia and Bosnia into line.
But now apparently Serbia has balked. The defeat in Krajina means Mr
Milosevic can make no more concessions for the moment.
This would be a severe blow for President Clinton, whose efforts in
Bosnia have failed constantly. A new failure would mean Congress will
insist on lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia next month.
It might also mean trouble for the British contingent of 180 in
Gorazde. The Serbs are preventing a Ukrainian unit there from leaving,
and the British hoped to follow them later this month. If the war is
about to resume, the Serbs will keep these troops hostage.
Nato proposes to defend Gorazde with air power but did nothing when
Serbian artillery shelled the town today. It may be inhibited from
launching a full-scale attack on Serb positions if British and Ukrainian
troops are trapped there.

Los Angeles
IN WHAT could be a serious blow for O J Simpson's defence team, Judge
Lance Ito today ruled that taped interviews allegedly portraying a
police investigator as a racist may not be introduced as evidence.
Ito said the defence motion to allow into evidence tapes by retired
detective Mark Fuhrman was ''incoherent'' and would not be considered.
However, he left open the possibility that the defence could refile the
motion in the double-murder trial.
Ito rejected the defence motion because it was poorly presented rather
than ruling on the substance of the request to bring the tapes into
evidence.
Simpson, a former US football star, has pleaded innocent to killing
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, in
June last year.
Fuhrman, who found a bloody glove at Simpson's estate, is a key
witness in the long-running trial and has become a centre of attention
as the defence attempts to portray him as motivated by racism.
As part of this effort, the defence has fought to introduce the taped
interviews Fuhrman gave to a screenwriter over several years which
allegedly demonstrate Fuhrman is a racist policeman capable of planting
evidence to frame Simpson.
Ito singled out 10 instances in which the defence alleges Fuhrman made
racist comments or described police misconduct on the tapes, but said he
could not find the comments at the places the defence said they were in
the transcript.
The question of Fuhrman's credibility is seen by court observers as
crucial to the outcome of the case.
Ito's wife, police Captain Margaret York, is mentioned in the
recordings, but any reference to her was edited out of the tapes he
reviewed.--REUTER/AP

Kirsty Scott examines the row focused on Archbishop O'Brien and his
sermon at a VJ Day service.
IT HAS been a time of conflicting emotions: remembrance,
recrimination, rage and forgiveness, so no-one should have been
surprised at the outcry on Sunday over a VJ-Day speech by the Roman
Catholic Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh.
Standing in St Giles' Cathedral, the Most Rev Keith O'Brien spoke at
some length on the subject of man's inhumanity to man and talked himself
on to the front pages for condemning the attacks on Nagasaki and
Hiroshima.
Yesterday, the Catholic press office was quick to defend the
archbishop, who was said to be uncontactable all day.
''If you take it out of the context it becomes political, and it was
not political,'' said spokesman Father Tom Connelly. ''I spoke to him
last night and I told him about the controversy. He is naturally sorry
about that but he didn't set out to offend anybody.''
In the address, the archbishop started with the Japanese and asked:
''How could they do it? How could so many people in Japan inflict such
suffering on those whom they were fighting, such cruel indignities on
those whom they captured, such ill-treatment and degradation of
thousands of so-called comfort-women . . . those of us who did not
suffer cannot ignore or forget the cry of those whose memories are
indelibly filled with thoughts of horrors and evils which they can never
forget.''
He then moved to the Allies: ''Yes, as we reflect on that question
directed to the action of the Japanese forces, so too must we direct it
to the Allies, to the American forces when we think of the introduction
of atomic warfare into our world, our global village.'' He touched on
current conflicts, nuclear weaponry and ended by calling for us to learn
from the past and look to the future.
Father Connelly said it was wrong to pick on one aspect of the sermon
and try to develop it as the key theme. ''In the first part of the
speech he said it was horrific what the Japanese did, it was cruel and
it was wrong. But he was saying we need to be reconciled and we need to
forgive one another, and if you are going to seek true forgiveness it
has to be based on truth, and the truth of the matter is that we, the
British, weren't without blame. We bombed innocent people in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, that was equally wrong. Now we've set the record straight,
let's move on.''
Archibishop O'Brien has been the focus of controversy several times
since he was appointed to replace Cardinal Gordon Gray as archbishop in
1985.
He made the headlines for an apparent dispute with then Archbishop
Thomas Winning over the location for Scotland's seminary for training
priests. At the time the split was characterised as an East-West divide.
In 1988, Archbishop O'Brien attacked the film The Last Temptation of
Christ, labelling it blasphemous and saying he would advise people not
to see it. The same year he also spoke out about poverty, blaming
long-term unemployment and reduced social security benefits.
The key to the archbishop's sermon on Sunday was reconciliation and
looking to the future, but it has brought him head-to-head with those
who felt VJ Day should have been given over to looking back, and, more
importantly, looking back from the Western point of view.
While acknowledging the ensuing uproar, the Catholic press office has
been keen to underline the fact that the role of an archbishop is not
always to soothe troubled waters or avoid controversy.
''A prophet will not be popular in the marketplace, not ever,'' said
Father Connelly. ''The truth will set us free, but the truth will hurt .
. .''

Jerusalem
TAMARA ROSENBERG missed death by seconds.
She and a friend had just got up from their seats and moved to the
front of a Jerusalem city bus when an explosion ripped through back of
the vehicle today, turning it into a charred, twisted cobweb of metal.
''We are lucky to be alive,'' said Rosenberg, 19, who had arrived in
Jerusalem from Lyon, France, to study Hebrew for three months. She was
wounded in the right foot by flying glass.
Hadassah Segal, 27, from New York City, said she fainted after the
explosion, woke to see bodies next to her and jumped out of a window.
''My father said when you come to Israel, don't get on a bus,'' she
said.
Israeli Orli Ben-Yamini, 20, said there was panic after the blast.
''People yelled and trampled over each other. I was injured from pieces
of glass that were flying all over.''
London-born Esther Chipman, 44, who was watching from her flat across
the street, said: ''We heard screams coming from the bus, people
shouting 'Mummy, mummy'''.
Police suspect the bomber boarded the bus as it made its way across
town toward the Ramat Eshkol neighbourhood in northern Jerusalem.
The driver, Ronen Shmuel, said many of his passengers were students en
route to summer school at the Hebrew University campus at Mount Scopus
as well as policemen riding to work at police headquarters.
When the vehicle moved alongside another bus outside the Rene Cassin
High School, the bomb made up of several kg of TNT detonated.
Spontaneous protests erupted within minutes of the blast, and border
police and riot police were deployed to prevent revenge attacks on
Arabs.
Hundreds of demonstrators jeered and threw stones when Police Minister
Moshe Shahal visited the bomb scene under heavy guard.
President Ezer Weizman was forced to cut short his visit to the scene
after he was mobbed by angry Israelis.
''We want revenge,'' the protesters chanted. However the crowd's main
target was Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was denounced as a
''traitor'' and ''murderer''.
Weizman, ringed by police for protection, grabbed a bull horn from one
of the officers to address the crowd. ''I came here to be with you, I
can also leave,'' he said testily.
Later, after visiting the wounded in hospital, he said: ''I have never
felt this anger from the public before.''--Reuter.

THE lover of the EastEnders actress Gillian Taylforth was released on
bail yesterday following a weekend in the cells after claims that he had
disobeyed bail conditions.
Mr Geoffrey Knights was warned to keep away from the actress until his
court case on a charge of assault on her driver, which is expected to
take place in October.
Judge Myrella Cohen, QC, also warned Miss Taylforth not to speak to
the press.
Harrow Crown Court was told that Mr Knights and Miss Taylforth were
photographed by a newspaper outside the BBC's Elstree studios on August
9.
At the time, Mr Knights' bail conditions said that he must not meet
Miss Taylforth.
In court, Miss Taylforth said the meeting occurred only because she
could find no-one to look after the couple's three-year-old daughter,
Jessica.

Allan Laing reprises the trials and tribulations of the comic genius
Michael Barrymore, now being pilloried for declaring his homosexuality
THE damnable thing about cliches is the fact that they are usually
true. Take the old one about the tears of a clown, for example. Michael
Barrymore is one of the funniest men in showbiz but this morning he
probably won't find very much to laugh about. His marriage is in tatters
and his personal life has been laid bare in the pages of the tabloids.
Whatever he may or may not be guilty of -- and there's nothing to
suggest that he's done anything more than be enormously talented and
successful -- he doesn't deserve the merciless hounding he has received.
He's this year's target. It's his turn to eat the hamster.
You might say that, well, serves him right for being famous. It's
always open season on famous people. How dare he try to live what
society deems to be a normal life (he has a wife) when all this time he
has not been prepared to admit openly that he prefers to go to bed with
men? Peter Tatchell, for one, will be rubbing his hands with glee now
that Barrymore has, apparently, publicly declared his homosexuality.
Of course, if it had been someone like Kenneth Williams or Larry
Grayson who'd come out and confessed then no-one would have batted an
eyelid. After all, they were limp-wristed stereotypes. But Barrymore is
different. He doesn't look the part. He might camp it up occasionally on
stage but, when you get down to it, he looks straight -- and that's what
makes his story so damned sexy for the tabloids.
He's also the most popular entertainer in Britain -- everybody's
favourite -- and when you're up there on top then you're automatically
in the line of fire. We can make 'em and we can break 'em.
The sad truth is that Barrymore's roller-coaster life now begins to
make a kind of sense. On the one hand, it has been one of enormous
professional success (with Barrymore and Strike It Lucky two of the
hottest shows on UK television, regularly attracting 13 million viewers;
comedy awards by the barrowload; and voted personality of the year for
the past two years in succession) while, on the other hand, there has
been this tortured private life, a struggle to come to terms with his
sexual identity.
Now we know the burden he had to bear.
Personal problems have been his constant companion. For a start, he
found it difficult to come to terms with his family; he was always at
odds with his mother (his father, a violent drunk, left home when he was
a child). And then there was his battle with drink and drug addiction.
Last year, at the height of his success, he booked himself into a
Baltimore clinic to rid himself of the demon drink. Champagne was his
weakness as well as painkillers, Valium, and marijuana. The
ever-vigilant tabloids, of course, had been alluding to his problems for
years. Gosh, they said, wasn't he looking tired? And so thin. What on
earth could be wrong with him?
Stress and exhaustion, said his army of publicists. Then Barrymore
bravely admitted to his drink problem. Faced it head on. Apparently
conquered it and even joked about it in his show.
He returned to strength, a new man. Leaner and fitter, and maybe even
funnier than he was before. But lurid suggestions about his sexuality
continued to dog him. Was he gay? Bisexual perhaps?
There was the story, resurrected long after the alleged event, about
him stumbling the worse for wear into another male star's hotel room and
making a fumbling pass. Then there was the one about him having sex
(twice) with a former associate. And another about him being spotted
groping a man in a gay bar.
Though he strenuously denied the rumours, the situation placed an
enormous strain on his marriage. At one point he separated briefly from
his wife (and personal manager) Cheryl. Three days later they were back
together, holidaying in the south of France; the panic over.
Now, it seems, the marriage is over. After newspaper reports yesterday
that Barrymore, attending a gay pub in London, had joined a drag artist
on stage, thrown off his wedding ring, and (to the tune of New York, New
York) declared: ''Start spreading the news, I'm gay today.''
Hours after the reports were published, Barrymore's agent released a
statement saying that the couple had parted.
Now the 43-year-old entertainer must wait and see if this latest bout
of adverse publicity will affect his popularity. Providing he does not
despair and seek solace in a bottle, the chances are that it won't. For
a start, once he's picked up the pieces and returned to work, he'll make
a joke of it. That's his way.
Barrymore has built his comic reputation on honest human emotion. His
is an act which at once is surreal and manic and yet it still retains
good, old-fashioned, family entertainment values. That's why his appeal
is almost universal.
It seems unlikely that, in this day and age, his sexual preference
would affect the loyalty of his many fans.

MARY BRENNAN encounters a dance company tackling the tacit prejudice
which faces the disabled.
EVER thought what it might be like if you were in a wheelchair? How
the rest of the world would react to you? PSSST! -- performed by Company
Pyke -- will give you a bit of an inkling.
David Toole, from Pyke, explains why: ''Actually it all comes from
things that have happened to us, things people have said or done when
they've seen us.'' Us refers here as much to CandoCo Dance Company as to
any individual. The Pyke performers are all part of CandoCo -- the
highly acclaimed integrated dance company -- and PSSST! is what they're
up to on their holidays.
The ideas started coming together, says Toole, almost as a reaction to
a reaction. ''There's this piece in CandoCo's repertoire -- it's by
Emilyn Claid -- that really used to shock people, upset them badly. And
what it was, was the sex. The sex and the violence. Because disabled
people aren't supposed to have that kind of anger, or those kinds of
relationships. And that set us thinking about all the other things we're
not supposed to want or do. And the way people behave towards the
disabled.
''PSSST! is just our way of saying 'take a look at yourselves'. It's
not out to get people, but it is realistic. It's us saying how things
are. And sometimes they're awful and sometimes you just have to laugh,''
says Toole.
Toole himself has been on the receiving end of widely differing
reactions all his life. Born without legs, he had learned how to move
not just in a wheelchair, but -- with speed and grace -- on his hands.
He was working for the Post Office in his native Leeds, when CandoCo
came to town with a weekend workshop. That chance encounter changed his
life.
Parents and close friends inevitably expressed concern when he elected
to join the group. The mail room in Leeds offered security, CandoCo
offered what seemed like a very public exposure. But Toole had tasted
something vital that swept all those considerations aside. In dance he
had found a way of being his own person.
At the time, however, the rest of the company were unaware of the
extraordinary power he had in his arms. He laughs as he tells what is,
by now, an oft-repeated story. ''We were rehearsing, and I had been
lifted out of my chair. When we stopped, I was being held on the other
side of the room. So I just dropped down and charged across the room on
my arms . . .'' Since then, Toole has dazzled audiences, and critics,
with the expressiveness of his dance. It's led, in fact, to a subtler
form of discrimination!
''People always tend to congratulate me backstage about Please The
Desert and totally ignore Kuldip'', he says with a wry grin. Kuldip
dances superbly in the duet -- but he happens to be able-bodied! It's
reactions like this, moments of well-intentioned condescension or
cavalier insensitivity, that Company Pyke has decided to make fun of in
a very serious way.
It's all a question of how you look at things and at people. Pyke had
decided to let us know how it feels like when the looks are sometimes
curious, not always kind.
* PSSST! is at the Pleasance from today until September 2 (except
August 30).

Diana Rigg shot to fame as a leather-clad Avenger -- but these days
she gets her kicks out of helping theatre at the grass roots. John
Fowler gets an earful of the new tune as she launches a new season at
Stirling.
SOOK, blaw -- surely there's some mistake. Diana Rigg playing the
moothie? She who was Emma Peel, the long-limbed, leather-clad Avenger?
It's not part of the dream that we males of a certain age cherish from
our tele-viewing in the sixties.
But times change and we all grow older. Young lithe actresses mature
and take up the challenge of the great classical roles.
Still, the moothie! But here she is telling me: ''I've got to learn to
play the harmonica,'' with scarcely a crinkle of amusement round her
hazel eyes.
Soon she's going to pay a visit to a music shop in Stirling where she
will buy a no-nonsense basic mouth organ and a
teach-yourself-the-harmonica primer. If that doesn't work she's got to
find a teacher. Whichever, she's got to be able to get some kind of
wheezing tune out of it in the next two and a half months for a play at
the National Theatre in London.
It won't be, I dare say, a virtuoso rendition, but then it needn't be
a Larry Adler, for the role which calls for this musical contribution is
Mother Courage, the loud-mouthed camp follower and provisioner of the
troops in Brecht's play about survival in savage bygone wars. The
production opens at the National at the end of October.
She is telling me this at the MacRobert Arts Centre, set among the
lakeside lawns of Stirling University campus, where she is soon to
appear, for one night only, in her own theatrical compilation of
theatrical reviews called No Turn Unstoned. This gala evening has been
arranged as a launch-pad for the MacRobert's ambitious autumn season.
There will be some black ties around, but it doesn't sound like a
starched-shirt affair. On the contrary, she says it's going to be fun
and a celebration, and she intends to mingle with the audience before
and after the show, which flouts theatrical convention. ''I very much
believe in mixing. There will be time for a drink and some talk before I
do the show, so the mystique is swept aside.''
Rigg has been chairman (no gesture to feminism here) of the MacRobert
for some years, invited ''out of the blue'' by a previous principal of
the university when she lived in the neighbourhood. At that time she was
still married to local landowner, businessman and former Guards officer
Archie Stirling, and though she divorced him later, she still visits and
retains an interest in the area.
Though this will be her first appearance on the MacRobert stage, she
is an enthusiastic supporter of all its activities.
''I have a passionate interest in the survival of the theatre,'' she
says, ''not only in the capitals and in the centres, but also throughout
the country. So I thought, here's my chance to put my shoulder behind an
arts centre in Scotland.''
Her own tastes chime with the MacRobert's function: ''I go to theatre,
opera, musicals, cinema. All the art forms, as far as I'm concerned, are
part of the whole.''
It was for her services to theatre that she was officially honoured
last year. Diana Rigg is now a dame.
As a girl of 11 she saw her first stage play -- it was a touring
production of Shakespeare's Henry VIII -- and she was so overwhelmed by
the experience that she persuaded her parents to take her to see the
Saturday matinee the following day. From then on her ambition was
settled. Now in her mid-fifties, tall and slim and fair-haired, she is
still devoted to the theatre, though it took second place when her
daughter Rachael was young.
She has also had plenty of experience in film and television. Some
eyebrows were raised when the promising young actress, fresh from a
successful stint with the Royal Shakespeare Company, jumped at the offer
of the leading role alongside Patrick Macnee in The Avengers on TV,
which in those days some people thought was debasing her art.
She had no qualms about it and is blunt about her motives. ''I wanted
the job,'' she says.
If she didn't exactly go in with her eyes closed, she was pretty
unaware of the medium: ''I didn't even possess a television. I'd no idea
what was involved.
''I pitched along with hundreds of other hopefuls and did my test. I
played a scene with Patrick and then I had to do a bit of fighting with
the stunt man. The poor stunt man was black and blue -- he'd been fought
all day by these actresses desperate to get the job.''
Sitting face to face with her, she appears as no shrinking violet, but
not what I'd call a natural born scrapper. ''I don't suppose my fight
scene was very good,'' she confesses, ''but they got better.''
She could have stayed on in the black leather gear, getting Steed out
of fixes with her new-found judo expertise, but after 51 episodes the
novelty had worn off and the formula was beginning to pall.
Week after week the outline was the same: ''Somebody gets killed, Pat
and I find the body, we go in opposite directions to investigate, we
touch base again about halfway through, then we go out again and one
gets into trouble and is rescued by the other. In a nutshell, that's
what happens.''
It wasn't enough. ''I was young and I wanted to learn some more. I
knew I wanted to go back to the theatre.''
Since then she has appeared on stage (in musicals as well as straight
theatre), screen and on the box. Most recently she has appeared on
American television in an adaptation of the Henry James story The Turn
of the Screw, and her last stage role -- as Medea in a new version of
the classical Greek tragedy -- was a huge success both in London and New
York.
She is modest about her films -- a career, she says, ''not glittering
in any respect. Which is partly my fault, because I prefer to work in
the theatre. The human contact with an audience means a lot to me, and I
love the collaborative business of the theatre.''
The trouble is, theatre doesn't pay well enough, and like others in
the business, she finds she has to take work which may not have the same
appeal but which delivers a fatter cheque.
I asked how she saw Diana Rigg in comparison with other leading ladies
of our time. It's not a comparison she was prepared to make, or at least
admit to. ''We've got wonderful actresses -- Maggie (Smith), Vanessa
(Redgrave), Judi (Dench) -- and I think it's entirely for other people
to decide where I am. I'm not in competition. We are completely
different, and I admire their work hugely and I go to see their shows.''
Her performance piece, No Turn Unstoned, emerged from a collection of
theatrical reviews, a selection of critical demolition jobs, which she
had put together as a book. She started off by writing to fellow actors
and actresses asking for their worst reviews, and then dug out some
examples from past history. The proceeds went to a home for elderly
actors and for a children's theatre, which pleased her as a contribution
to both ends of the theatrical spectrum.
The idea of a performance piece came during a spell out of work --
''everyone assumes that if you're famous you don't have periods out of
work. The only thing to do seemed to be something on my own.''
She consulted her friend, the actor Vincent Price, made a lecture out
of the juiciest bits of the book, and took it on the circuit round the
American universities ''who pay very well for out-of-work actresses.
Also I did it to the Library of Congress, which was quite a hair-raising
occasion, at Harvard, and various other places.
''Here I do it for students (for free) and I also do it to raise
money.''
All actors get bad notices from time to time, she says, and it always
hurts. The worst is when the critic gets personal. She remembers her own
anguish when the play Abelard and Heloise transferred to Broadway and
she was on the receiving end of a particularly offensive notice.
In one scene she was required to play nude (''hated doing it, but none
the less'') which elicited the following piece of prose: ''Diana Rigg is
built like a brick basilica with insufficent flying buttresses''.
It's hard to imagine what the man meant. But for a woman not yet 30,
having just had a huge success in the part in the West End, it was a
bitter blow to self-esteem. ''You get the drift,'' she says. ''You're
hurt. A total stranger says something very personal -- how would you
feel?'' She says that No Turn Unstoned has a lot of laughs in it -- but
I suspect a little of that pain may shine through.
* The gala evening with Diana Rigg at the MacRobert Arts Centre,
Stirling, is on Friday, September 8. Tickets at #25 include champagne
reception, performance of No Turn Unstoned, followed by canapes.

A MAN who raped a five-year-old girl and molested three other young
girls was jailed for eight years yesterday at the High Court in
Edinburgh.
James Smith, 37, of Ness Drive, Arbroath, admitted the rape and using
lewd, indecent, and libidinous practices towards three young girls, aged
12, seven, and eight.
Lord Caplan said Smith's conduct ''was disgusting, dangerous, and has
to be severely discouraged by the court''.
Mr Scott Brady, prosecuting counsel, told the court that matters came
to light when one of the girls went home and told her mother ''something
had happened to her''.
Mr Brady said that some of the indecent assaults took place when Smith
played a game of ''ghosties'' with the younger girls.
Mr Hugh Matthews, QC, defence counsel, said Smith was a man of limited
intelligence who had had an unhappy childhood and had been the victim of
abuse as a young boy.
Mr Matthews claimed Smith had been subjected to terrible treatment
while on remand.
Because he had been charged with sexual offences against young girls,
other prisoners threw urine and scalding water over him.

IN WHAT is believed to be the first case of its kind to come before a
Scottish court a Scottish schoolboy international hockey player was
yesterday cleared of severely assaulting a rival player with a hockey
stick during a match.
Steven Vidgen, 16, of Templon Cottages, Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, was
found not guilty of assaulting Neil Richardson, 16, on October 8 last
year at the Meadows, Ellon, by striking him on the face with a hockey
stick to his severe injury.
Vidgen was also found not guilty on an alternative charge of culpably,
recklessly swinging a hockey stick in Richardson's direction in such a
manner as to place him in danger of suffering injury, resulting in him
being struck on the face with the hockey stick to his severe injury.
Richardson, of Earlswells Road, Bieldside, Aberdeen, told the trial
that he was a member of the Milltimber Bieldside and Cults Hockey Club
taking part in a ''very aggressive'' league match against Peterhead
Academy with tough tackles and lots of swearing.
He said he was playing as sweeper and had just hit the ball when he
was hit in the face by Vidgen's hockey stick in a swing more associated
with baseball than hockey. He suffered a depressed fractured cheekbone
under his eye, a cracked nose bone and swelling and lacerations.
Richardson claimed he was hit by a wild aggressive swing and denied a
defence suggestion that the incident had been ''an unfortunate
accident'' when Vidgen struck the ball. The court heard that when
charged Vidgen told police: ''I took a swing and mis-hit the ball, the
follow through hit him on the face, he fell to the ground. I walked
forward and said 'Are you all right?' . . . my captain said it was only
an accident.''
Defence agent John McRitchie described the incident as ''an
unfortunate accident'' involving a schoolboy game of hockey.
Returning his verdict Sheriff Alexander Jessop noted there had been
conflicts of evidence from various witnesses involved and said he was
not satisfied the injuries had been deliberate and intentional.

<HEADLINE>Fishermen claim Navy mine plans threaten livelihood</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FISHERMEN in Applecross, Wester Ross, claim their livelihoods are
threatened by a Royal Navy proposal to explode mines in a prime fishing
area.
They are to meet officers of Commodore Clyde in Faslane on Saturday at
the British Underwater Test and Evaluation Centre (Butec) in Kyle of
Lochalsh to discuss the plans for minesweepers to explode 88 kg live
mines within a ''buffer zone'' in the Inner Sound once a month.
Fisherman Alfie Edwards, 40, of Camusterrach, Applecross, says this
area represents the best local fishing ground and that, because fish
take up to three weeks to return after an explosion, the zone will
become a virtual no-go area for the whole year.
He claims the Navy is reneging on a guarantee it made 25 years ago
when the base was set up for no live fire in the buffer zone or outer
sea area which surrounds a restricted six-mile inner sea area for
torpedo testing.
Mr Donald Matheson, vice-chairman of Skye and Lochalsh Fishermen's
Association which represents trawlers and fishing boats, said the
explosions would have a knock-on effect for members if Applecross
fishermen were forced into their fishing zone.
''First trawlers were to be banned from the buffer zone, now there is
going to be this -- they will take over the whole area,'' he said.
Mr Matheson is also concerned about the repercussions the explosions
would have as the last explosion was felt in Gairloch 12 miles away.
''Fair enough once a year, but 12 times a year will have a detrimental
effect on the seabed,'' said Mr Matheson, of Kyle.
Butec commander Tony Grattan-Cooper said that, with the defence cuts,
it was important to keep a level of business going at the range
otherwise the local community would suffer.
He knew of no promise not to use live fire in the buffer zone and
asked how fishermen could know that fish would not reappear soon after
an explosion when there had been no underwater explosions in the area.
However, a spokesman for Commodore Clyde said the meeting was to
formalise the frequency of controlled explosions, ''which we have done
informally on frequent occasions without any objections''.
''We are not doing anything that we have not done in the past,'' he
commented.
''We have used the zone for trials on a regular basis and, while I
don't have figures, it has been fairly habitual over the past three to
four years.''
He added that the meeting would discuss the limits and objections and
explore the best solution to the problem for all parties concerned.
Mr Donald Cameron, 52, of Applecross, who has been fishing the area
for 32 years claimed there had been only one explosion in the Inner
Sound last year when he was given two hours to quit the area and lost a
day's fishing.
''We had a meeting with the commander when we reminded him about the
promise made when the range started, but he said circumstances have
changed,'' said Mr Cameron.
''They always do as they like and now this will become a virtual no-go
area.''

<HEADLINE>Survey shows decline on terrestrial channels. Stations' watch on TV violence</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976765101</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE major broadcasters have pledged to set up a study of TV violence,
despite new figures showing it has declined by almost half on
terrestrial channels.
The BBC and Independent Television Commission will be joined by BSkyB
and the Broadcasting Standards Council in an investigation into how much
violence appears on our screens.
A survey published today by the BBC and ITC showed violence accounts
for 0.61% of the output of BBC1, BBC2, ITV, and Channel 4, compared with
1.1% in 1986.
If satellite TV is included, violence occupies 1.07% of programming
time on all channels.
The study, carried out over the past year by the University of
Sheffield Department of Journalism Studies, was the most comprehensive
ever undertaken in the UK.
Set up in the wake of the murder of James Bulger, it monitored the
four terrestrial channels and most-watched satellite channels -- Sky
One, Sky Movies, the Movie Channel, and UK Gold -- for four separate
week periods over six months.
Broadcasters were not told which weeks those were to be. The study
found:
* Violence occupied 1.07% of programme output time on all channels,
0.61% of terrestrial channels, and 1.53% of satellite channel time.
* Most violence occurred in feature films, 53% of all output. Other
drama accounted for 17% of the total, and home-produced series were less
violent than those bought from abroad.
* Most violence occurred after the evening watershed.
* Just a few programmes contained most of the violence portrayed. That
is, 1% of shows accounted for 19% of all violent acts and 2% of
programmes accounted for 47%.
The new joint study will follow much the same pattern, but will
monitor 28 separate days out of a six-month period.
The BBC and ITC are also carrying out a three-year study on the impact
of television on children.
Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley welcomed the newly-launched
study, saying: ''I am pleased that both the BBC and ITC have given this
issue a high priority.
''I applaud their decision to continue to monitor output and to carry
out further research, particularly the impact of television on
children.''
She wanted broadcasters to innovate but also to be responsive to
audience concerns, she said.
BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey said: ''The BBC governors take policy in
this area very seriously and we believe the BBC's showing in the
monitoring report shows this.''
The subject of violence would be on the agenda at a corporation
seminar on taste and decency in November.
ITC chairman Sir George Russell, representing the ITV companies, said:
''The fall in the total amount of violence on terrestrial channels from
comparable research in 1986 is a move in the right direction.
''However, there is no room for complacency.''
BSkyB defended itself from charges that more violence featured on
satellite channels.
It said the four channels monitored were ''clearly unrepresentative''
of all 26 available, because they featured a high drama content, and 70%
of violence occurred in films or drama.
''Comparisons between thematic satellite channels and generalist
terrestrial channels will remain unrealistic,'' it said.
There were very few complaints to the ITC about violence on satellite
programmes, it added.
Mrs Mary Whitehouse, of the National Viewers' and Listeners'
Association, said: ''Because of technology and special effects, the
effect of violence now is definitely more than it was five or 10 years
ago. We are feeding ourselves with violence as entertainment.''
Labour media spokesman, Mr Graham Allen, said: ''It is encouraging to
see that the proportion of violence on terrestrial television has been
reduced in recent years and I hope that broadcasters and regulators will
keep up the good work.''
Developments in media technology would make regulation increasingly
important, he added.

CASH-starved schools in the Highlands are reaching crisis point with
many in an ''intolerable'' state of repair, the chairman of the region's
education committee claimed yesterday.
Councillor Val MacIver wants Scottish Office Ministers to persuade the
Treasury to release extra funds for school upgrading and has invited
Education Minister Raymond Robertson to come and see for himself the
results of chronic Government under-funding.
She has also called on Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to press
home the message in the annual funding talks with the Treasury. She
said: ''These talks offer the Scottish Office the chance to prove their
commitment to Highland education, which, like other Scottish
authorities, is being starved of money.
''Sound education is significantly diminished when physical
surroundings are grossly inadequate and decaying.''
Three of the area's worst schools are Portree High School, Ullapool
Academy, and Glenurquhart High School, near Drumnadrochit. It will cost
#19m to solve their problems with the construction of new schools to
remove the need for temporary accommodation.
Portree High School has had hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on
repairs but Educational Institute of Sotland officials say there are
still dangers facing pupils.
Ullapool and Glenurquhart's main buildings are surrounded by temporary
classrooms, which are cold in winter and unbearably warm in summer.
Depute director of education with responsibility for buildings, Mr Jim
Stevenson, said: ''Our priority is to get children out of temporary
accommodation and into proper modern buildings. But we don't have enough
money to do it and we need more cash from the Government to solve a
problem which is growing every year.
''This authority had made repeated pleas to Government for extra
funding but so far we have been unsuccessful.''
Mr Stevenson said the problem was inherited from bad planning design
in the sixties.
''We are having to plough money into repairs rather than investing in
new schools,'' he said. ''Over the next four years, we have urgent
projects costing #26m requiring to start. But we will only get around
#9m of Government money.''
The EIS spokesman for Highland region, Mr Stephen Dowds, said: ''There
is the potential for health and safety problems for pupils in some
schools, notably Portree High School. Highland Regional Council don't
have enough money to build new schools or keep up with the growing
number of emergency requests for maintenance work.''
The depute headmaster of Glenurquhart High School, Mr Eddie Broadley,
praised Highland Regional Council's commitment to education in the area
but admitted the authority was fighting a losing battle. He said: 'Our
buildings are falling apart. It's as simple as that.''
Some 85% of Glenurqhart High School's classroom accommodation is
temporary huts and Mr Broadley added: ''Quite apart from the poor state
of repair, we have been trying to teach pupils in temperatures of about
32C this summer. And in winter it can be absolutely freezing.''

A MYSTERY sponsor flew a local football hero back to the Western Isles
from the United States to play in a league clincher.
When Kevin Murray, 22, from the village of Back in Lewis, got the call
in Maryland last week Hurricane Felix was wreaking havoc.
It had closed his nearest airport at Salisbury.
The Glasgow University engineering graduate, now working on a student
scheme as a waiter in Ocean City, Maryland, dashed 300 miles to
Philadelphia airport.
He then jetted to Glasgow and on to Stornoway to play for Back against
local rivals Point.
But it was all in vain. Point won 1-0 in a hard-fought match.
A disappointed Mr Murray said yesterday: ''The ball just wouldn't go
in.'' A big crowd turned up at the match on Back's home ground on Friday
for his homecoming.
The former islands' under-21 player of the year dismissed the intense
pressure that he must have been under.
He said: ''It was well worth the hours of travelling. It was brilliant
to hear the roar of the Back crowd again.'' The blond striker revealed
it was a sponsor, who does not wish to be named, who stumped up the
hundreds of pounds for him to dash back across the Atlantic.
''I honestly have no idea who it was. I can only guess but I'm not
sure at all,'' he said.
It now needs a miracle for Back to win the local league as leaders
Ness, who have just clinched the Highland Amateur Cup for a record
fourth time, have a huge points lead.
On Thursday Mr Murray will have to fly back to Maryland, where he has
applied for an engineering job.
''But I'll be keeping in touch with the league results back home by
phone,'' he said.
* Mr Murray's father, Murdo, a champion sheepdog handler who won the
Grampian TV Sheepdog Trials screened at the weekend, was a star of the
Back side when they last won the league 20 years ago.

SOCIAL work chiefs last night launched an immediate inquiry after a
young girl in foster care suffered scalding after allegedly being left
in a bath with the hot tap running.
Lothian Regional Council officials yesterday said they were ''very
concerned'' about claims in a Sunday newspaper that the youngster had
been left in the hot bath by a foster mother they had appointed.
But they refused to comment further on the allegations, including a
claim that the two-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons,
was in pain for two days before being taken to hospital.
Last night, the youngster, was being treated at Edinburgh's Sick
Children's Hospital for third degree burns.

TWO men alleged to be supporters of the Scottish National Liberation
Army mailed a communique to an Aberdeen newspaper containing detailed
designs for a home-made gas bomb and threatening to attack English
colonists, the High Court in Stirling was told yesterday.
The letter, which the prosecution alleges was sent by Mr Terence
Webber, 30, of Farquhar Road, Aberdeen, and Mr Kevin Paton, 27, of
Charles Gardens, Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, arrived at the Press and
Journal newspaper on March 5, last year.
Assistant news editor John MacDonald said the letter -- postmarked
Perth, Dundee, Angus on the previous day -- claimed to be from an
organisation called Flame, which was described as a paramilitary group
formed to oppose the English colonisation of Scotland.
It threatened to disrupt the lives and property of ''English
colonists'', and warned that estate agents who continued to advertise
Scottish homes for sale outwith Scotland would be targeted.
Mr MacDonald said the letter contained bomb-making instructions which
the organisation said were being circulated to activists throughout
Scotland.
The ''recipe'' for what was described as a home-made explosive device
involved a butane gas cannister and a dustbin full of petrol.
Mr MacDonald said he contacted the police after reading the letter.
Several weeks later, on April 18, Mr MacDonald said he received a
telephone call from someone who said he was representing Flame, passing
on a ''communique'' claiming responsibility for eight ''attacks'' using
inert letter bombs.
It said inert bombs had been mailed to Grampian Regional Councillor
Terry Penny, a man described as ''the colonist Roxborough'', lecturer
Malcolm Dickson at Dundee University, and Persimmon Homes, a company in
York.
The caller added: ''The police will confirm the devices used, only the
explosives were excluded. In future, they will not be excluded.
''We also have firearms and are just about to use them. The people
mentioned here have 30 days to quit Scotland or face death.''
Mr Webber and Mr Paton are accused of making threats and mailing fake
letter bombs in a campaign to force the Government to grant Scotland
independence, and of conspiring between January 1 and September 9, last
year, at Charles Gardens, at Union Grove, Aberdeen, and elsewhere, to
further the purposes of the SNLA and Flame by criminal means.
They are further accused of sending a letter to the Press and Journal
newspaper on March 4, 1994, containing instructions for the manufacture
of an explosive device, and threatening to attack English ''colonists'',
and threats to estate agents not to advertise Scottish homes for sale
outwith Scotland.
The pair are accused of sending letters on April 27, 1994, to the
Labour and Conservative parties, various newspapers, and the Press
Association, containing a threat that Mr Tony Worthington, Labour MP for
Clydebank and Milngavie, would be killed unless he left Scotland within
30 days.
Mr Webber and Mr Paton are charged with posting hoax letter bombs on
April 8, to Malcolm Dickson at Dundee University, Mr Terence Penny at
Grampian Regional Council, Mr Derek Roxborough at the Old Police
Station, Gairloch, Persimmon Homes, of Fulford, York, and Exchange and
Mart magazine in Poole, Dorset.
They are also accused of placing a hoax bomb at Aberdeen Sheriff Court
on September 8.
Both men plead not guilty. Mr Webber has lodged a special defence
claiming that if any of the offences were committed, they were committed
not by him but by Mr Adam Busby, of Upper Gardiner Street, Dublin, and
by Darrin Brown, address unknown.
The court was told by Councillor Penny, 47, a former Scottish Militant
Labour councillor, and Mr Derek Roxborough, 59, a Tynesider who has
lived in Wester Ross for 26 years, that they received Jiffy bags through
the post containing hoax bombs.
Earlier, the court was told that Sun journalist Allan Muir and
photographer Andy Barr met Mr Webber in a Glasgow public house on
February 9, 1994.
The journalist said Mr Webber told him the SNLA wanted Scotland to be
free of the shackles of England, and without the English being here
taking the jobs. He claimed Mr Webber said there could be a campaign of
disruption. He said the interview became ''sticky'' at that point, but
Mr Webber used the phrase ''take up arms''.
The trial, before Lord McCluskey, continues.

THE husband of climber Alison Hargreaves is preparing to visit
Pakistan to see the mountain which claimed her life.
Mr Jim Ballard, speaking at Nevis Range ski centre near the family
home at Spean Bridge, close to Fort William, said he planned to take
their children, Tom, six, and Kate, four, within three weeks.
The weather would dictate how close he would be able to get, but he
hoped to reach the foot of K2, he said.
Ms Hargreaves, 33, the first woman to conquer Everest alone and
without oxygen, died on Sunday last week when she and six others were
caught by bad weather as they descended the 28,250-ft K2.
Mr Ballard said: ''When I get to K2, and when I have said my words to
Alison, and Tom has, and Kate has had a little cry, that will be the
shutting of a chapter. But I suspect it's only the first chapter in the
story of Alison Jane Hargreaves.''

THE heatwave is taking its toll of wild salmon and sea trout stocks,
with large numbers of fish dying while trapped in shallow pools baked by
the sun.
Concerned anglers in Renfrewshire have reported several incidents over
the weekend as temperatures soared, with dozens of salmon killed on
stretches of the Black and White Cart rivers.
The fish, victims of thermal stress or oxygen starvation, were unable
to survive the combined effects of low water and hot conditions.
Mr Bill Gibb, secretary of the Abercorn Angling Club, who described
the problem as ''disastrous'', has reported the incidents to the Clyde
River Purification Board.
He said last night: ''It seems the fish have been unable to survive in
these stressful conditions. The temperature of the water in some of the
pools over the weekend was 23 degrees.
''The fish are literally being cooked.
''In the Black Cart, behind the old India Tyres factory at Inchinnan,
the problem has been exacerbated by the rapid growth of weed upstream,
which is blocking the river bed as the water level is so low.
''At low tide, the level in the stretches downstream drops so low that
the fish are trapped in shallow pools. It is tragic.''
Mr Gibb, who fears that without rain thousands of fish may die over
the next few weeks, added: ''We are all extremely concerned that we
could lose all of this year's fish.
''It is a disastrous situation, as both the White and Black Cart
rivers had recovered dramatically in recent times, with both showing
reasonable runs of salmon.''
The area officer for Clyde River Purification Board, Mr Keith
Johnstone, confirmed that water temperatures had been recorded at the 23
degree mark over the weekend, and said inspectors and a biologist were
to carry out an examination of the dead fish to confirm the exact cause.

COMPANY heads should be selected by committee in consultation with
employees, investors, suppliers, and any relevant regulators, and
limited to an eight-year term of office, a leading economist said
yesterday.
The radical proposals, put forward by Professor John Kay, are designed
to improve the system of corporate governance, under fire after a series
of recent scandals, including the collapse of the Maxwell empire, Asil
Nadir's Polly Peck, and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
and allegations of boardroom greed in the privatised utilities.
Professor Kay, writing in the National Institute Economic Review,
challenged the widely-held view -- advanced by the recent Greenbury
report into executive pay -- that the best way of improving the way big
companies are run is to develop mechanisms to make them more accountable
to shareholders.
These include an enhanced role for non-executive directors, more
extensive involvement of shareholders in major decisions, and fuller
information about corporate affairs.
Professor Kay, head of the consultancy London Economics, said the idea
that shareholders owned large companies was a myth. Firms like BT and BP
were social institutions, owned by nobody.
Corporate managers were not the agents of the shareholders, many of
whom had little if any interest in monitoring the way a company was run,
he said, but trustees of the businesses' assets.
''Moreover, there are dangers in an attempt to breathe artificial life
into a model of accountability that has little practical reality,'' he
said.
Professor Kay's solution is a new Companies Act with several key
elements.
It would:
* Require all big companies with a widespread shareholding structure
or in a particular area (schools, water supply), as well as very large
private firms with few shareholders, to register as a public limited
company.
* Directors would be under a statutory duty to promote the business of
the company and to balance the claims of investors, customers, suppliers
and employees.
* Boards should be made up of an independent chairman and at least
three independent directors, none of whom should receive ''substantial''
remuneration in either salary of dividends from the company on whose
board he/she sits.
* Chief executives, who should not be chairman as well, should be
selected by a committee, appointed by the independent directors,
comprising independent business and professional advisers in
consultation with employees, investors, and suppliers and any relevant
regulatory agencies.
* The chief executive's appointment should be fixed for four years
with salary and bonuses determined at the beginning of that period.
* Like US Presidents, only one renewal of their contract would be
permitted.

<TEXT>
A 25% INCREASE in mental illness among young people in Renfrewshire
since 1990 has been attributed to distress caused by bullying, exam
pressure and problems at home.
Based on a three-year study, a report published yesterday by the
Renfrew Association for Mental Health is the first in the UK to question
secondary schoolchildren about their experience and awareness of mental
illness.
Of 1800 questioned, 31% of girls and 15% of boys knew someone who had
been mentally ill, but almost half of all pupils wrongly equated mental
handicap with illness and 87% wrongly understood the nature of
schizophrenia.
Mental illness among the young is often confused with teenage mood
swings, said the report's author, Mr Peter Grafton, who added: ''Society
finds it difficult to accept that the young can become mentally ill in
what is seen as 'the best years of their lives'.''
He said parents should look for sleeplessness, severe appetite loss,
and truancy as indicators that children may be suffering mental illness.
The report calls for a national strategy involving school visits by
mental health professionals and ex-patients and for promotional
campaigns to be mounted in schools, similar to those involving drug
awarenss.
Mr Grafton said that, while school resource packages already were used
in Northern Ireland and were under development in England and Wales,
there was no corresponding provision in Scotland.
The survey was launched yesterday at the Out of Sight, Out of Mind
mental health exhibition at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, which has
attracted more than 500,000 visitors since its launch in February.

A LEAKED document shows British Rail will have to pay the management
of Red Star to take over the parcels business when it is privatised,
Labour claimed today.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said managers planning to
buy the business had bid a nominal sum, thought to be #1, for the
loss-making organisation but would receive a first-year rent subsidy
from BR worth #1.5m.
In addition, BR could be left with a redundancy bill of up to #7m for
700 Red Star staff, he claimed.
Mr Meacher said a confidential ''information memorandum'' from Red
Star on the sale showed ''a business being savagely cut ready for
privatisation''.

POLICE in Strathclyde yesterday presented Scotland's most majestic
bird of prey to highlight the latest stage in its drugs initiative,
Operation Eagle.
Annie, an 18-year-old golden eagle, helped to launch a campaign
involving the force and Safe Greater Easterhouse which will see the
area's 16,500 households receiving a drugs identification guide.
The guides, which will be delivered over the next two weeks in the
Glasgow estate, aim to:
* Provide education and raise awarness of Operation Eagle;
* Highlight the national drugs helpline number, 0800 77 66 00, which
provides assistance, encouragement, and harm reduction for drug users.
* Highlight the local number, 0141 771 3456, where information on
drugs dealers can be left in confidence.
Assistant chief constable Crispian Strachan yesterday stood nervously
as the bird was placed on his arm at the Shandwick Shopping Centre in
Easterhouse.
After his brief encounter he said he believed the protected bird,
which is kept in captivity by Clyde Valley Hawks in Crossford,
Lanarkshire, provided an active image for use in the campaign, pointing
out that the purpose of the anti-drugs drive was contained in the
acronym: eagle -- education, awareness, guidance, legislation, and
enforcement.
Mr Strachan rejected a suggestion the problem of drugs was more
serious in Easterhouse than other areas of Strathclyde.
''I would hesitate to say that anyone here has any worse problems. It
is individual choice very much with drugs.''
He said he had been greatly encouraged by the surrender of drugs at
police stations since the force introduced its amnesty last week.
This involves 79 stations binning then burning prescribed tablets and
capsules brought in by the public on a no-questions-asked basis.
He said: ''Some of the bins at the stations are absolutely full. We
are doing what we wanted to -- getting in any and every drug just to
take them out of circulation and take them away from people.''
The enforcement phase of the campaign, which has already resulted in
more than 2000 arrests including almost 800 dealers since June 1, begins
in earnest on September 1 and will run for three months.
Asked how many arrests could be anticipated by the end of the
campaign, Mr Strachan replied: ''Numbers are not the be all and end all.
What matters is taking drugs out of circulation, stopping dealers, and
stopping young people from falling into the trap of using drugs.
''If we could do it with six arrests we would. If it takes 6000
arrests we will do it.''
Mrs May McLeish, chairperson of the Safe Greater Easterhouse Project,
said locals were becoming increasingly concerned about drug abuse and
dealing. She said the effort to combat drugs would have the full support
of the community.

IT is a classic case of physician heal thyself -- the physician in
this case being the Government which for 16 years has lost no
opportunity to hector us on healthy living.
Who can forget the advice of the former Junior Health Minister Edwina
Currie about the dangers of black pudding and chips and going to work on
an egg? Most famously she told businessmen travelling abroad the best
way to avoid catching Aids was to take the wife.
However, while such prescriptions are flying about it appears the body
politic itself is none too healthy.
According to figures released yesterday by Labour, it appears civil
servants in Whitehall top the league for days lost through sickness.
And, yes, the worst for sick leave appears to be the Department of
Health, where 69,363 days were lost last year, amounting to 6.2% of the
total number of working days.
The Government claims it cannot estimate the cost to the taxpayer of
more than 3.5 million lost working days -- a rate of absence
outstripping public and private sector averages.
The huge Department of Social Security alone accounted for almost a
third of all days lost in central Government.
The Confederation of British Industry said absence for sickness ran
nationally at 3.4% of total working time last year, which breaks down
into 9.7 days a person in the public sector and 6.9 in the private.
An analysis of figures released by Labour and gathered from Government
departments showed the average in 11 leading Whitehall ministries was
closer to 10.6 days.
Labour also claimed not a single department was able to provide the
cost of sickness absence.
A spokesman for the Health Department explained its figures did not
take into account time taken off in bank holidays by its 7500 staff, and
said they could be further skewed by time lost through preparations for
a far-reaching redundancy programme announced last autumn.

<HEADLINE>Call for 'suicide free' cells</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976765113</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SHERIFF yesterday called for prison cells to be made suicide free
following the deaths of three inmates at Barlinnie Prison.
John Grant, 50, and William Hallford, 43, hanged themselves from
ceiling light fittings, and Alan Scott, 23, from a bar on a window. All
used bed sheets.
The recommendation follows a nine-day fatal accident inquiry at
Glasgow Sheriff Court into the three deaths within a four-week period
last summer.
Sheriff Eric Galt returned formal verdicts on the three deaths. He
said the message of the inquiry was that cells must be provided where
suspension points were not available.
''This would at least reduce and hopefully, in time, eliminate deaths
by hanging,'' the sheriff added.
Grant, of Spey Court, Grangemouth was serving three years for wilful
fire-raising, and Mr Scott, of Carmuirs Avenue, Camelon, Falkirk, was on
remand facing a charge of rape.
Mr Hallford, of Birrens Road, Motherwell was on remand on charges of
robbery, drugs, and firearms.
Sheriff Galt found that, in the cases of Grant and Mr Scott, a failure
to observe them was due to a defect in the system of passing information
from the prison hospital to the halls.
Medical staff had put them on the ''ordinary observation'' category,
which meant they should have been looked at least once every hour.
This had not been done and the system had since been changed.
The sheriff found that Mr Hallford died in the Royal Infirmary on June
28 last year from heart failure and brain damage, eight days after being
found hanging in his cell.
He had been under ordinary observation and was found hanging from a
light fitting after a prison officers' tea-break.
Sheriff Galt said the furthest he could go regarding defects in the
system was to say that it raised ''at least a possibility that it
contributed to the deaths of John Grant and Alan Scott''.

COMEDIAN Michael Barrymore last night admitted that he had separated
from his wife of 18 years.
A statement issued through his solicitor said: ''Michael and Cheryl
wish it to be known that they are presently separated and leading their
own personal lives. Cheryl will continue to act as Michael's manager and
continue to give Michael her full support in his career.''
The statement ended months of speculation about the marriage of the
television entertainer, who has been dogged by drink problems and
allegations that he had gay affairs.
Last night, Barrymore said nothing as he left his #750,000 Stanhope
Terrace home in London's Lancaster Gate to get into a chaffeur-driven
Volvo.
The comedian's health has been a problem for some years. He suffered
weight loss and spent time in an exclusive Baltimore clinic last year
when he admitted he was an alcoholic.
His wife has always been supportive and was by his side two weeks ago
as he auditioned members of the public for his new ITV show, My Kind of
People, at a shopping centre in Croydon. They had just returned from a
weekend break in Cannes where they tried to patch up their differences.
Barrymore gave her a kiss to cheers from thousands after singing:
''Smile though you heart is breaking.''
To add to the pressures on the star, there have been allegations that
his friends and relatives have been featured on his TV game shows.
Barrymore, 43, allegedly confessed to being homosexual in front of an
audience of more than 200 gay men in an East End pub after being
introduced by a drag act.
According to reports, he sang a saucy version of the Frank Sinatra
song, New York, New York, featuring the words: ''Start spreading the
news, I'm gay today.''
He was later pictured in an argument with a photographer outside the
White Swan pub.
His 44-year-old wife masterminded his career from being an
end-of-the-pier, bottom-of- the-bill comic to the millionaire star of
shows such as Strike It Lucky and Barrymore.
He headlined at the Royal Variety Performance two years ago when he
cuddled an Army sergeant-major and sang Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow
to loud applause.
One friend said last night: ''Michael's fans have been amazingly loyal
and he has had so many letters of support but it has been a great
strain. It is a great tribute to his professionalism that he has managed
to make the new show while going through all this pain in the
background.''
Mrs Barrymore, who is staying in an apartment attached to the
Athanaeum hotel where a double room costs #190 a night, refused to speak
about the state of her marriage. The couple have no children.
It had been claimed that Barrymore threw his wedding ring off at the
White Swan pub and invited customers back to his house for a party. His
brother, Mr John Parker, said nothing Barrymore had done would lead him
to think he was gay.

THE South Lanarkshire unitary council has offered the Belt Up School
Kids (Busk) campaign the chance to shape road safety measures, including
school bus contracts.
The offer was made yesterday at a meeting between the new authority
and the Carnwath-Biggar branch of Busk, which was set up as a national
organisation just over two years ago, after a series of minibus and
coach accidents claimed the lives of 16 children.
The Carnwath-Biggar branch was formed after the Biggar bus crash, in
which two schoolboys died last February.
Busk had asked to meet council leader Tom McCabe to discuss plans for
school transport safety when the new council takes control next April.
After the meeting, Busk secretary Helen Mackenzie said it had been its
most constructive talks with either national or local government.
She said South Lanarkshire's offer to become involved in the planning
of school bus routes and pick-up points ''was the best news we have had
in two years''.

THE Israel-PLO talks were suspended last night after a suicide bomber
from the Islamic Hamas movement killed five people and wounded 100 in a
morning rush-hour bus attack in Jerusalem.
Hamas's military wing said in a statement signed by ''the students of
the engineer, Yahya Ayyash'' it also vowed to carry out more attacks to
derail the Israeli-PLO peace process.
Ayyash, known as the engineer, is top of the Israeli army's wanted
list. He is believed to have made or trained the makers of many of the
Hamas bombs.
Despite the blast, and threat, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the
talks would be suspended ''for a few days'' but this would not affect
the timetable for reaching an agreement. PLO chief Yasser Arafat
denounced the bombing and called Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to express
his condolences.
Both sides said they were determined to sign an agreement on extending
Palestinian self-rule to the West Bank on schedule in Washington next
month.
US officials said one of the dead was an American woman, Joan
Devanney. The bomber was also believed among the dead.
There were two unidentified bodies, one a woman.
The Jerusalem police chief said the condition of the woman's body
suggested she could have been holding a bomb. However, the Hamas
statement referred to the bomber as a man.
Thousands of right-wing Israelis and Jewish settlers demonstrated
throughout Israel and at the scene of the blast. Some were arrested as
they tried to block traffic.
Mr Rabin sealed Israel's border with the occupied West Bank after the
explosion.
The bomb exploded in the back of one bus as it passed another. The
explosion set fire to the second bus and blew out its windows.
Passengers on both buses were among the wounded.
Most of the passengers were students. Some were foreign students
attending summer Hebrew language classes.
UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and US President Bill
Clinton condemned the attack, and Mr Clinton promised that ''these
enemies of peace will not succeed''.

<TEXT>
SECTARIAN arson attacks on Catholic and Protestant churches and
loyalist Orange Halls and the petrol bombing of private homes in
Northern Ireland were strongly condemned yesterday by the Government.
Security Minister Sir John Wheeler said that the attacks damaged
everyone who had been enjoying the initial fruits of peace.
They took the province ''back towards days we hoped we had left
behind,'' he said, adding that inflaming sectarian tensions jeopardised
the peace.
''Why are some people putting that at risk by their actions? Northern
Ireland, disfigured by sectarian attacks, can never be a stable society
at peace with itself.''
He challenged those who had influence to ''put an end to this risk to
peace''.
The Minister spoke out after three Catholic churches and a Baptist
church were damaged in arson attacks.
At the same time, an 80-year-old man was in hospital after petrol bomb
attacks on three houses in an east Belfast terrace and another on a
house in Lisburn, County Antrim.
The son of the elderly Catholic man said he believed the attack on his
father was a reprisal for the extensive damage caused to the Baptist
church a few hours earlier.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein President, called for a halt to the
attacks, saying that the irresponsible and unnecessary behaviour added
to the fears and tensions which already existed.
Meanwhile, Mr Adams was yesterday snubbed by the Orange Order after
seeking a meeting to discuss the attacks which have seen some 30 Orange
Halls damaged by Republicans in recent weeks and other reprisal attacks.
It was revealed that Mr Adams had twice written to the Rev Martin
Smyth, the Orange Order leader and South Belfast Ulster Unionist MP
seeking talks about the attacks.
Mr Smyth wrote back yesterday refusing to meet Mr Adams and accusing
Sinn Fein of stirring up sectarian tensions. He told Mr Adams he had
failed to use his position to influence those responsible for attacks on
Orange Halls.
A meeting would be possible only ''if you turn from using violence as
a political weapon,'' he wrote.

A FORENSIC scientist described to a court yesterday a trail of blood
where a woman was found shot dead.
Mr Alastair Burt, 35, told the High Court in Glasgow that Ms Sally
Cannon, 20, of Kelburn Terrace, Port Glasgow, had been shot in the mouth
and twice in the head.
Mr John Hemphill, 30, her boyfriend, denies shooting her and murdering
her. Mr Hemphill claims alibi.
He further denies being concerned in the supply of heroin and cannabis
resin between August 1992, and April last.
Police Constable Cameron Baillie, 27, told the court he found Mr
Hemphill at a car park with blood on his face, hands and jeans and that
he became emotional and asked: ''What kind of beast would do that?''
The policeman said Mr Hemphill told him he had left Ms Cannon in their
home on Saturday afternoon, April 22. He found her early on the Sunday
morning on the first floor landing.
Constable Baillie said Mr Hemphill told him she had been ''calling at
doors for help''.
Mr Burt told Mrs Fiona Reith, prosecuting, he went to the scene early
on April 23 and found blood on the stairs. There was heavy blood
staining on the carpet in Ms Cannon's ground flat house and a finger
print in a blood stain low down on a wall.
Mr Burt said it was the deceased's fingerprint and had probably
happened when she was scrambling about on the floor after being shot in
the mouth.
The forensic scientist then told of blood staining going all way to
the top flat and then heavier staining when she had come down to the
first floor landing.
Mr Burt said she had probably been ''down'' when she was shot twice on
the head behind the right ear.
He said he later examined a jacket and jeans belonging to the accused
and found stains of blood which could have come from the deceased.
Mr Burt agreed smears of blood could have been caused when the accused
held the dying woman in his arms, but in his opinion droplets on the
jacket and jeans had happened at the time she was shot.
He said: ''You require energy to break up blood.'' And he added the
force of the bullets striking the girl would propel the blood in
droplets.
Asked by Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, if all the spots on the
jacket and jeans were caused the same way, Mr Burt replied: ''I could
not tell.''
Mr Findlay suggested that the spots could have come from a last
violent attempt by Ms Cannon to clear her airway and asked: ''Did the
spots result from a gunshot?'' Mr Burt said: ''I could not say for
certain.''
Re-examined by Mrs Reith he said: ''It was likely they were.''
Acting sergeant Ronald Withers, 50, of the police firearms section,
said he was given three bullets after a post-mortem examination on the
woman. He described them as .38 lead bullets and all had been fired from
the same gun.
Mr Withers said the gun used had not been found but in his opinion it
was an Enfield revolver of the type issued during the Second World War.
He said this type of gun was often used in target practice.
The trial continues.

THE distraught father of the pilot of an Army Lynx helicopter who died
along with three other British soldiers when it crashed into the
Adriatic Sea off Croatia said yesterday that his family had always
feared such a tragedy might occur but were still ''utterly devastated''.
Corporal Pilot Ian Macdonald, 29, whose parents live at Appin in
Argyll, was named as one of the victims when the helicopter from 3
Regiment Army Air Corps ditched into the sea on a regular training
flight on Sunday.
Yesterday his parents, retired Metropolitan policeman Derek Macdonald,
58, and his wife Josephine, 53, were being comforted by relatives and
friends at their home overlooking Shuna Island, Loch Linnhe, after
learning of their son's death from his 30-year-old widow.
Speaking as arrangements were being made to bring home the bodies of
the dead soldiers, Mr Macdonald told how two telephone calls within
weeks of each other brought great pride and grief to his family.
One was to say their son had at last been awarded his sergeant's
stripe; the other meant he would never wear it. He had received his
navigator's ring five years ago and his pilot's two years later.
Mr MacDonald said: ''He got the award for being the most improved
pilot on the course, near Andover, and we were told just recently he was
to be made up to sergeant. We were very proud but now we will never see
it.''
He added: ''I think obviously all parents, when their sons are in an
active duty environment like Northern Ireland and Bosnia, fear the worst
but we are still utterly devastated and very distraught by the news.''
Ian Macdonald had been married for five years. He met his wife,
Jeanette, in 1987 when she was a civilian clerk to the forces in
Germany. The couple had no children and lived in quarters in Gutersloh,
Germany.
Mr MacDonald said: ''When she phoned to tell us what had happened, she
was beside herself with grief. We are assuming she will return to
England to her parents' home in West London.
''We know no more about the crash than we have heard on television or
read in the papers. An officer came to see us, but he couldn't tell us
much though the indications are that Ian was flying the helicopter
though there was a more senior pilot on board.''
0 Ian Macdonald had wanted to be a soldier ''since he knew such things
existed'', according to his father, and became a junior leader in the
Army Air Corps at 16.
He went into the regulars at 18 and had completed seven years in
Germany and nearly three in Northern Ireland.
He was also in the Falklands and took part in Nato exercises
throughout the world before his secondment to the British contingent of
the multi-national Rapid Reaction Force.
He was an all-round sportsman and proficient in squash and ski-ing to
Army instructor standard.
The family's other son, Douglas, 31, who is in the Metropolitan Police
in London, was yesterday travelling north to be with his parents and the
local Church of Scotland minister, the Rev Douglas Robertson, was
planning to visit them last night.
Mr Robertson, of Appin Parish Church, said yesterday: ''This is a
small community which has been saddened by several fatal accidents in
recent years and I know there will be a lot of concern and support for
the family.''
The father of one of the other victims of the crash, Air Trooper Roger
Willingale of 7 Regt, Army Air Corps, said yesterday that he had ''got
his wings'' just weeks before he died and had ''the heart of a lion''.
His son had done two tours of duty in Northern Ireland and one in
Canada, which finished just before the regiment was posted to Croatia.
''He had seen his fair share of action,'' his father said.
The other casualties were Sergeant Martin Charles Osbourne, 30, of
Wattisham, Suffolk, and 20-year-old Air Trooper Graham Shane
Witherstone, from Scunthorpe.
The sole survivor of the crash was Air Trooper Ian Brain, 21, from
Loughborough, who was with 3 Regt Army Air Corps, said Major Gerry
Bartlett of 24 Air Mobile Brigade, based in Ploce, Croatia.
It was believed the bodies of the four soldiers, retrieved from the
sea on Sunday and taken to Ploce, would be flown home next week to RAF
Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, said Major Bartlett.
A spokesman for the brigade at its base in Colchester said it was
''pretty shocked'' by Sunday's accident, which happened five miles off
the Croatian coast.
It would ''continue as normal'' despite its first losses since the
brigade deployed in Croatia a month ago.

THE Scottish economy is suffering ''deep structural problems'' caused
by a dependency on electronics, chemicals, and whisky exports, the
Scottish TUC is to tell Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth when they
meet on Thursday.
The STUC will challenge Mr Forsyth to show he is a listening Minister
by adopting policies to help industries outside the core sectors which
it warns are still in recession.
This would include setting up a Scottish Investment Bank, giving full
support to blocks on further interest rates rises, and arguing against
an imposed incomes policy for public sector workers.
Mr Forsyth will also be urged to drop plans to take water services out
of local authority control. The STUC concedes it would be a bold move,
but believes that this one act alone would make a tremendous difference
to the Government's standing in Scotland.
The meeting will be the first between the executive of the STUC and Mr
Forsyth since he was appointed. Union leaders are keen to discover
whether Mr Forsyth is willing to listen to, and act upon, other points
of view, rather than simply following his own agenda irrespective of
whether it has public support or not.
Mr Campbell Christie, the STUC general secretary, concedes there are
issues where the STUC's approach will be at odds with Mr Forsyth's, but
he hopes to find some areas of agreement -- such as the need to reverse
the growth of local quangos in Scotland.
''Much has been made of the contrasting style of Michael Forsyth and
his predecessor, but the real test will be if there is a contrast in
substance.''
An STUC paper, to be presented to Mr Forsyth on Thursday details union
officials' concerns over the Scottish economy. It states that although
current economic performance appears relatively healthy, this position
is reliant on large electronic and chemical industries and that any
growth has been ''jobless''.

<HEADLINE>Yard set for extra submarine work. Rosyth finds silver lining in loss of refit</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>JAMES MCKILLOP</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE refit of the Type 42 missile destroyer HMS Glasgow, which was
intended to be carried out at Rosyth as part of the core programme of
surface ship work to compensate for the loss of Trident submarines, is
now certain to go to arch-rivals DML in Devonport.
However, the decision is good news for Scotland. It now makes it
certain that Rosyth dockyard is set to win contracts for two additional
nuclear submarine refits.
Under the Government's original proposals, all nuclear submarines were
to go to Devonport after 1997. However, serious nuclear safety problems
there have made a nonsense of the programme.
In the meantime, the Babcock management would rather win two submarine
refits at the expense of a Type 42.
If this is good news for Rosyth, conversely it is disastrous for
Devonport. There is no doubt the yard is in a desperate situation.
HMS Glasgow, currently in the Adriatic on operation Sharp Guard duties
off the coast of former Yugoslavia, is not due for refit until next
year.
However, the ship's company already has been told that, despite the
original plan, it was now almost certain that the refit would be carried
out at Devonport.
Two of the Glasgow's sister ships -- Edinburgh and Newcastle -- are
being refitted at Rosyth as part of the core programme.
A Ministry of Defence official said yesterday that the final decision
had yet to be taken over the Glasgow. However, it was true that the
ship's company had been given an early warning of a likely change in
plans.
There were two reasons, he said.
The first was that the refit for each of the Navy's hunter-killer
S-class nuclear submarines had been extended from 80 to 95 weeks.
As two of these boats -- Sovereign and Superb -- were currently under
refit at Rosyth -- that meant the Scottish yard now had 30 additional
weeks of work.
A second reason concerned the report currently being finalised on
nuclear safety at the yards.
This report is likely to be published soon after MPs return to the
House of Commons after the summer recess. This in turn will allow an
announcement to be made that Rosyth has been awarded additional
submarine refit contracts.
A Babcock spokesman confirmed yesterday that additional submarine work
being awarded to the yard meant it would be unable to complete the refit
of HMS Glasgow on the time scale required by the Navy.
Nuclear safety concerns at the Devonport yard had already led to hints
from Mr Roger Freeman, when Minister for Procurement at the MoD, that
nuclear submarine refits would have to continue at Rosyth beyond the
previously planned date for the switch to Devonport.
Neverthless, the MoD has steadfastly refused to confirm reports in The
Herald in May that Rosyth would win at least two additional submarine
contracts.
Even yesterday officials would not admit that Rosyth had won the
additional submarine orders. However, a source admitted last night that
all that was waiting was a formal announcement.
Within months of the promise of the core programme of surface ship
refits for Rosyth, a spokesman for the Scottish Office said on behalf of
Mr Ian Lang, then Scottish Secretary, that the MoD had made it clear
that ''the allocated programme for work is a very clear and unequivical
commitment by the Government to Rosyth''.
If that was true for Rosyth, then promises made to Devonport over
submarines were also being seen by the Government as a firm commitment.
However, yesterday an official at the MoD said: ''What was said in
1993 was not meant to be read as the likely end result. I don't think
people took it as carte blanche. Clearly things were likely to change.''
It was not the impression given at the time.
During a visit to Scotland, Mr Freeman said: ''We are going to start a
process of discussing with Babcock whether they can take some more SSN
refits beyond 1997.''
He then conceded that while Rosyth would welcome additional work, he
was aware the management would not see the programme of refitting
surface work jeopardised in any way.
That might have been the company's view then. However, it was obvious
last night that events had moved on. As far as the company was
concerned, two firm submarine orders were more than compensation.
It is obvious that the nuclear safety problems at Devonport are worse
than originally anticipated. However, last night the MoD remained
adamant that the yard still would refit Trident submarines.

MORE and more Edinburgh home-owners are cashing in on the Festival by
renting out their homes and heading off on holiday.
Letting agents said yesterday that increasing numbers of residents
were escaping the city's crowded streets, pubs and restaurants by
leasing out their homes during the three-week event.
Mackay's Property Agency, one of the biggest leasing agents in
Edinburgh and the Lothians, said that about 20% of the property it
handled at this time of year was for the Festival.
General manager Ms Patricia Balharrie said the average rental ranged
from between #400 and #1200. However, even luxury accommodation, costing
thousands of pounds each week, has been snapped up by Festival visitors.
Chestnut House, at Melville Castle, Midlothian, which had a weekly
rental of #3000 during the Festival, was one of the first to be leased,
said Ms Balharrie. The property, which includes its own swimming pool,
sleeps between 10 and 12.
Ms Balharrie said: ''We do advertise for properties for the Festival,
but quite a number of people actually come to us, having been suggested
by word of mouth.''
Leasing agents believe many residents use the opportunity to take a
break -- paid for by letting out their homes.
Ms Balharrie added diplomatically: ''I do think Edinburgh residents
participate quite extensively in the Festival. There are many who would
be taking a summer holiday anyway. No doubt their holiday is paid for by
leasing their homes.''
* Comedy acts on the Fringe said yesterday they planned to disrupt the
Perrier awards, after claiming they had been barred from taking part.
Groups from Chicago claimed they had been banned from the annual
awards, made to the best comedy acts on the Fringe, because their
improvised shows were ''unscripted''.
Talks are now taking place between a number of Fringe acts and the
soft drinks company, Fruitopia, over the possibility of setting up rival
awards. Final approval for the move has still to be given by Fruitopia's
parent company.
A dozen companies from Chicago are taking part in the comedy aspect of
the Edinburgh Fringe, under the Chicago Mafia banner, with many of the
shows heavily improvised.
Mr Kevin Mullaney, producer of one of the shows, Harold on the
Hollyrood, said: ''Apparently Perrier believe that improvisation is
somehow inferior to scripted comedy. If our show is inferior, then why
not simply consider us and not give us the award?''
He said a ''peaceful protest'' was planned by improvisers from around
the world at the Perrier ceremony this week.
The French mineral water company later denied the groups had been
barred from the awards.
Perrier spokeswoman Ms Mica Burns said: ''The Perrier awards are so
highly regarded they are now treated as a benchmark by the public when
they want to see comedy acts, and when improvisation is involved it can
be good, or not so good. There is no guarantee of quality.
''We work very hard to make sure that everyone who can possibly be
included is eligible.''

<HEADLINE>Strathclyde boost as curbs spread. Scottish water in pipeline for Spain</HEADLINE>

AS hundreds of thousands of Scottish consumers begin to be affected by
hosepipe bans, Strathclyde is getting ready to export between 15 and 20
million gallons of water a week to Spain.
The region has been in negotiations with an international shipping
company to transport excess capacity from Loch Katrine to Majorca and
the southern mainland.
Strathclyde's acting director of water, Mr Donald Davidson, yesterday
disclosed that negotiations on exporting water to Spain had been in
progress for many months, long before the current hot weather. No deal
has yet been struck.
Despite the hot spell, there is still plenty of spare capacity in Loch
Katrine, currently 20 million gallons a day.
It is actually easier to ship the water to Spain than to supply other
areas of Scotland or England that are suffering shortages. This is due
to the absence of a pipe network to take the water, for example, to
Fife, while there is one to the Glasgow docks where it formerly supplied
the yards and foreign ships.
Mr Davidson explained: ''We have spare capacity in the Katrine system
and we have the infrastructure available. The trunk main goes down to
the dockside where it would be loaded on to tankers. These would carry
the water into the firth and then load it on to a much bigger vessel
further west.''
The move was revealed as the Government was coming under attack for
controversial new plans for saving water in England and Wales where the
supply is in the hands of private companies. Measures being considered
by Environment Secretary John Gummer include urging the water companies
to press ahead with metering.
The chairman of the new water watchdog body in Scotland, former Labour
MP Dick Douglas who is now prominent in the SNP, last night made it
clear that any attempt by the Scottish water authorities to introduce
similar measures would face close scrutiny from him. Three new public
boards will take over water and sewerage services from regional councils
in April next year.
Meanwhile, Strathclyde water levels are holding up well and there is
still no prospect of a hosepipe ban in the region.
At the end of last week, levels in the three main reservoirs serving
Strathclyde were:
* Loch Katrine (Greater Glasgow's main supply) -- 103 days;
* Loch Bradan (Ayrshire's main supply) -- 85 days;
* Daer Reservoir (Lanarkshire's main supply) -- 84 days.
However, the use of hosepipes is to be banned in more parts of
Scotland.
Fife became the first regional council to impose a hosepipe ban
throughout its area, which covers 150,000 homes; a ban in parts of
Highland region is to be extended; and Dumfries and Galloway is to
introduce a ban unless there is a dramatic change in the weather.
Fife Regional Council said the move was necessary because consumption
was still running at 10% above normal, despite an appeal to the public
to use water sparingly. It had left the region's reservoirs at 42.6% of
capacity.
Residents caught breaching the ban could be liable to a fine of up to
#1000.
Although it applies only to domestic hoses and sprinklers, with
businesses not affected, the council's engineering services committee
chairman, Councillor Bert Turpie appealed to all industrial consumers to
cut back on consumption and waste wherever possible.
The council also revealed although it is spending #2m a year replacing
water mains, 25% of supplies still leaks away. But half of the loss is
not within the council's control as it happens on consumers' premises.
Strathclyde's Mr Davidson said that the country's largest region also
lost an average of about 25% of supplies through leakage, but stressed
that this did not cost the council much because Strathclyde has a very
cheap supply of water.
''We do search for leakage in particular areas but we balance what it
costs to find with the volumes we have. Obviously, if we were short of
supplies we would increase our efforts to make sure we weren't losing
water.''
A spokesman for Highland Regional Council said: ''In principle, the
argument is that in Scotland we are so well resourced that it is very
rare that we would ever get excited about leakages. But every authority
checks for leakages and takes them seriously because of the consequences
of damage to other people's property from water escaping.''
Highland region, which imposed a ban on the use of hosepipes and
sprinklers in the Dingwall and Black Isle areas last Tuesday, yesterday
decided to extend the ban to the Strathspey area, which includes
Grantown-on-Spey, Aviemore, Newtonmore, and Kingussie.
The council said the action was necessary because outflow from the
local source of water, Loch Einich above Glenmore Lodge in the
Cairngorms, was depleted because of what the council takes from the
loch.
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council also decided at a special
meeting to impose a ban on the use of hosepipes from next Wednesday
unless there is a significant break in the weather or a change in
demand.
Water manager Donald Darrant said: ''Reservoirs are not yet at a
critical level but because of the increased demand we are having
problems with treating the supply and getting it into the mains network.
It looks as if the only way to cope with the situation will be to impose
the hosepipe ban. There will be no exemptions and it will be
region-wide.''
Mr Darrant said demand had increased by between 30% and 40%, due
mainly to increased agricultural and domestic use.
So far Scotland has escaped the worst of the drought, with only small
and localised problems. In some areas, officials say the problem is not
a shortage of supplies but sheer pressure of demand, with people wanting
to use water faster than supplies can be treated.
Meanwhile, Mr Gummer came under fire over controversial new plans for
saving water. Opposition parties, consumer groups and water companies
all attacked the Environment Department's Water Conservation: Government
Action report.
Mr Gummer is considering prescribing a maximum flow rate for showers
and pondering the wider use of toilets that use less water. He is also
urging water companies to press ahead with metering.
Labour said the Government was failing to make water companies tackle
the problem of leaking pipes, the Liberal Democrats said the report was
a ''mind-boggling example of ministerial buck-passing'' and the
Consumers' Association said the public was being burdened with an unfair
share of responsibility.
The water companies said the report lacked any long-term conservation
plan and put too much emphasis on metering.
Mr Gummer defended the report, which has taken three years to produce,
insisting ''sustainable use of water required action by everyone''.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said 80% of wasted water
leaked from company-owned pipes.
''This 71-paragraph document devotes 56 paragraphs to talking about
customers saving water and it devotes just nine paragraphs to talking
about leakages from company pipes,'' he said.
''And at the end of those nine paragraphs it says the Government won't
intervene, won't set the company's targets, it will leave everything to
their judgment.''
Mr Dobson said he was opposed to compulsory metering, adding: ''I
think it's quite unnecessary and it's vastly expensive.''
Liberal Democrat MP Paul Tyler, secretary of the Commons' all-party
water group, said attempts to pin the blame on consumers were adding
insult to injury given the problems people were facing during the
current drought.
''The statement from the Department of the Environment this morning is
a mind-boggling example of ministerial buck-passing,'' he said.
''For 25 years some of us have been urging that priority should be
given to supply leakage rather than hoping that domestic meters would
solve the problem. Clearly, that is where the biggest savings can be
made.
''Is John Selwyn Gummer really as complacent about this as he sounds?
He sounds as if he is trying to wash his hands of the whole debacle.''
The director of the National Consumer Council, Ms Ruth Evans, said:
''Leakage control is a sensible way to spend consumers' money to save
water. Introducing widespread metering is expensive to instal and
maintain. Metering brings with it hardship, especially for large
families and those with particular medical conditions requiring large
quantities of water.''
However, industry regulator the Office of Water Services (Ofwat)
welcomed the report, saying it contained a ''useful framework''.
Ofwat was pleased by the report's endorsement for metering, saying it
would ensure that people who used garden sprinkers paid for the
privilege.
Mr Douglas said of the water-saving measures proposed for England and
Wales: ''We are a long way from considering such things in Scotland
because the Lord has blessed us with plentiful water and our forefathers
have blessed us by being sagacious in what they did.''
He added: ''If any such proposals came from the authorities in
Scotland, I would want to take a long, lingering look at anything like
that. My responsibility is to protect the consumers.
''The ethos of the water industry in Scotland has a different thrust.
Water is still in the public domain here. South of the Border, it has
been privatised: that would happen in Scotland over my dead body.''

MEMBERS of the new City of Glasgow Council were told yesterday that
the #79m shortfall in its finances could result in some departments
exceeding Government guidelines by between 20% and 33%.
The #79m shortfall between the Government's estimate of grant-aided
expenditure and the city council's notional budget could in theory send
council tax bills soaring by up to 70% unless the Government provides
more resources.
Every department of the new authority would exceed the Government's
estimate if current levels of service were to be maintained, but some
would find their budgets going right through the roof.
Worst affected would be leisure and recreation, whose notional budget
of #46m would be 32.76% above illustrative grant-aided expenditure --
the amount the Government considers a local authority should spend on
relevant services.
Libraries, museums and art galleries (#22m) would be over by 31.92%,
cleansing (#30m) by 25.67%, while the strategically vital roads and
transportation budget (#49m) would be 20.12% over.
The biggest spending departments -- education (#284m) and social work
(#175m) would be over by 8.23% and 9.52% respectively, while the police
(#117m) and fire (#22m) budgets would exceed the guidelines by 4.85% and
9.9%.
Leader of the new authority that assumes power next spring, Councillor
Robert Gould, said the Government had to be reminded of its promises
that the reorganisation of local government would be carried through
smoothly without detriment to services.
He said: ''We're not arguing for someone else's money. We're arguing
for Glasgow's money. We're asking for fairness. We're arguing in terms
of needs to provide the services that's required.''
Deputy leader, Councillor Des McNulty, explained: ''We're running an
#80m gap between the services presently provided in Glasgow and the
notional allocation, which is a formula that the Government has
produced.
''All we're saying to the Government is that this formula doesn't
reflect the actual cost of services as they stand in Glasgow. It's not
something the Government should have any problem in altering if they
follow their own logic.''

THE mother who lost five of her children in a house fire earlier this
month was married yesterday in an emotional ceremony.
Ms Mandy Davies, 34, who broke both legs escaping the fire, sat
weeping quietly in a wheelchair decked with satin bows as she married Mr
Dennis Deverey, 63, at Wrexham Registry Office.
Although she cried during the eight-minute civil ceremony, Ms Davies
smiled afterwards and said: ''I am happier now. We had planned to marry
next month but, because of the horrible things that have happened, we
needed to be closer together.''
Mr Deverey said: ''After this tragedy, we decided to get married here
and now. We shall benefit from being bonded closer together.''
Ms Davies was injured when she jumped from a bedroom window as fire
engulfed her home in Hightown, Wrexham, on August 10.
The blaze claimed the lives of Philip Foulkes, seven, and his
eight-year-old brother Matthew, both from her first marriage, and her
three-year-old twins, Stephen and Robert Davies, by Dennis.
Sarah Foulkes, 12, suffered severe burns in the blaze and died in
hospital last Thursday. Sarah's best friend, 12-year-old Louise Jones
from Hightown, Wrexham, also died in the blaze.
The other victim, 18-month-old Heather Davies, remains critically ill
in hospital after a five-hour skin graft operation. Arrangements are
being made for the couple to stay at the hospital where Heather's
treatment could last six months. Mr Deverey said: ''Our thoughts are
with her now.''
After a small family reception in Wrexham Miners Institute, Mrs
Deverey returned to hospital at Wrexham.

LEADING Scots Tory Brian Meek, a part-time adviser to Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth, has been dropped from a think-tank set up to
study constitutional change.
Mr Meek, who has never made a secret of his pro-devolution views,
received a letter from the Scotland Consultative Group of the
Constitution Unit telling him his services were no longer required.
He was invited to join three months ago but had yet to attend a
meeting.
It is believed the unit decided to drop him because it was worried
that his appointment would have given the discussion group a political
flavour.
Mr Meek, a Herald columnist, described the decision to remove him from
the London-based group set up with the financial backing of the
charitable Nuffield Foundation as ''a little cowardly and slightly
insulting''.
However, he said he would not be losing any sleep over the decision.
Mr Meek was one of several public figures invited to join the group.
Among the others approached were Gavin McCrone, of Glasgow University,
and Sir William Kerr Fraser, a former Permanent Secretary at the
Scottish Office.
Last night, Mr Meek said: ''The decision is a little cowardly. Also I
find it slightly insulting that one day I am acceptable to be part of
the group and the next day I am not.
''I have been political all my life and they knew that when they
appointed me.
''I didn't think there was anything particularly secret about the
discussions and I believe they could have benefitted from an alternative
voice.
''In the letter they sent me telling me I wasn't needed, they asked me
to recommend somebody else. Suffice to say, I will not be recommending
anybody, not even my worst enemy.''
No-one from the unit, set up to work on details of constitutional
change in the expectation of a change of government, was available for
comment last night.

A SCOUT leader was badly injured yesterday when he fell more than
150ft down a steep mountain in the west Highlands.
Mr David Holt, 47, of Hastings, Sussex, was leading a troop of 11 Boy
Scouts, including two of his sons, up the side of Beinn Alligin, Wester
Ross, when he slipped and fell.
Torridon Mountain Rescue Team rescued the leader and a Sea King
helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, on a training detachment at Kyle of
Lochalsh, was diverted to the scene and winched the man to safety.
He was flown to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, where he was treated and
detained suffering from serious head and back injuries.
The Scout leader fell on a well-known route up the mountain to the
Horns of Alligin.
His Scout group are camping half a mile from Torridon Youth Hostel.
Beinn Alligin, the mountain of beauty, has three summits, all above
2800ft, the largest peak being Sgurr Mhor which is at 3232ft.
The Scout group last night stayed in Glen Torridon with two other
Scout leaders. They are due to return home on Thursday.
