ANTHONY PERKINS:
A Haunted Life
Ronald Bergan
Little Brown, #17.50
I MET Anthony Perkins once in 1964. He was in London to make the
comedy A Ravishing Idiot with Brigitte Bardot. Aged 31, he was at the
height of his boyish beauty. At a reception to promote the film a group
of adoring women critics were gushing happily. One asked who was his
favourite leading lady. The star paused. ''Yourself,'' I said. If looks
could have killed I would have been felled among the canapes. ''In
Psycho,'' I added hurriedly, realising I had said something out of
place. Ronald Bergan's biography of Perkins, subtitled A Haunted Life,
reveals just how fools can rush in.
I must have appeared dreadfully knowing, when I was only trying to be
smart amid the flattery, because Perkins was a closet gay. Bergan spends
much of the book trying to justify the subtitle's claim. Certainly the
role of Norman Bates in Psycho haunted Perkins' career. Norman was
mother dominated, and so was Perkins, but there the resemblance ends,
and Mr Bergan's parallels between this and other roles and reality are
wildly over stretched.
The Hollywood gays' reputations were well protected by their employers
who had a vested interest in ensuring their stars' female admirers were
not disabused about their availability. Perkins may have been haunted by
his sexual orientation, but he enjoyed a long running relationship with
the dancer Grover Dale and succeeded, as have most Hollywood gays then
and now, in having and eating his cake.
At 40, while making Judge Roy Bean, he was introduced to the joys of
hetero sex by the actress who became Pam Ewing, Victoria Principal, and
subsequently married the photographer Berry Berenson. By all accounts
the marriage worked, and when he occasionally reverted to his earlier
habits she understood.
The saddest story comes last. He discovered from The National Enquirer
that he had the Aids virus. He had been suffering from Bell's Palsy,
when an employee of his doctor tested his blood sample for HIV on the
sly and sold the story. A disbelieving Perkins threatened to sue, but
Berenson suggested he take an Aids test first. It proved positive.
The title is catchpenny, but the book, with its useful filmography, is
a reminder that Perkins was more than a one-role actor, although as a
star he never quite made it to the height of the Hollywood heavens.

Renate Stendhal (ed): GERTRUDE STEIN IN WORDS AND PICTURES (Thames &amp;
Hudson, #14.95).
* THERE are three ways to be immortal. Best is by simply not dying;
after that comes living through one's work; after that, living through
the work of others. Gertrude Stein, patron of the Lost Generation of
American writers who hung out in 1920s Paris, enjoys immortality of the
last kind, which gives this reverent collection of pictures and
quotations an appealingly Pooterish air. Blissfully devoid of humour and
serenely convinced of her own genius, she nevertheless attracted to her
generous salon writers such as Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Ezra Pound, and
in return they shone a kindly light on her. Moral: genius is the best
thing to have, but a nice private income ain't so dusty either.
Nigel Forde (ed): A MOTLEY WISDOM: The Best Of G K Chesterton
(publisher etc t/c).
* LEAVING out the Father Brown detective stories, there can be few
pre-war literary giants as little read nowadays as Chesterton. Like his
atheistic, science-minded sparring partner H G Wells, the mystical,
Catholic Chesterton wrote too much and too diversely -- novels, poetry,
polemics, stories, essays -- for much of it to be remembered. Yet his
bluff, bufferish Englishness, his gift for paradox, his
anti-authoritarianism and his generosity of mind are well worth
rediscovering. Like its subject, this anthology spreads itself too thin,
but makes a useful introduction to literature's most lovable Fat Owl.
Fay Weldon: AFFLICTION (Flamingo, #5.99).
* ONE of the best things about being a novelist must be that, no
matter what injustices you suffer in real life, you can always vindicate
yourself in fiction. The world and his ex-wife know that Affliction, the
story of a woman whose husband goes into therapy and breaks up his
marriage for the sake of his alleged personal development, is largely
Weldon's own. But whatever its source, this is a vitriolicly funny and
defiantly rationalist satire upon the cult of personal growth, New Age
mysticism, and all sorts of selfish navel-gazing indulged in by people
with too much money and not enough to worry about.
D M Thomas: EATING PAVLOVA (Sceptre, #5.99).
* HAMPSTEAD, 1939: Sigmund Freud, exiled from Vienna, lies dying in
rented rooms as London nervously gears itself up for the newly declared
war. As he dies he dreams, performing upon himself in waking and
half-waking moments his last session of analysis, calling up every
shameful act and thought of his life, hardly able to tell the difference
between them. Ferociously sexual in parts yet astonishingly tender, this
is a moving and resonant novel of sorrow and forgiveness, worth reading
by anyone who doesn't expect to live forever.
Alan Hollinghurst: THE FOLDING STAR (Vintage, #5.99)
* A HOT but unsuccessful contender for last year's Booker Prize,
Hollinghurst's melancholy novel of sexual obsession and exile may have
suffered in the judging by its uncompromisingly gay sexuality. Like
Thomas Mann's Death in Venice, whose theme of besotted middle-aged
longing for a teenage boy it shares, it presents a challenge of
emotional engagement to the most sympathetic heterosexual reader --
especially as, in this case, sex actually happens, and explicitly. There
is, however, something universal in the story (bathetically set in a
grey Belgian town) of how each man kills the thing he loves; and it is
beautifully, elegiacally written.

Mark McLellan discuss
the prospects for
skygazers in May
HOW high is a cliff? Think of the biggest precipice on earth and
multiply it many times -- then you may have an inkling of the scale of
the cliff Mark McLellan has pictured on this page.
You'll never see this wondrous natural feature. You will never sit at
its base and gaze out into space towards the planet Uranus, as we do
here in our imagination, thanks to Mark's graphic flight of fancy.
This towering cliff is the outstanding feature of Miranda, one of at
least 15 moons that attend Uranus. Until recently we knew of only five
Uranus moons, but the journey of the space probe Voyager 2 altered that.
As it drew near to distant Uranus, the planet seventh furthest away from
our sun, its cameras revealed the existence of ten more moons -- and
there may be still more to be discovered in due course.
Miranda is the smallest of the five moons visible from earth, but it
rejoices in a multiplicity of natural features, of which Mark's cliff is
the most remarkable. To put it bluntly, she's a bit plooky, is our
Miranda. Craters, canyons, cliffs -- you name it, Miranda's got it. Two
of everything? -- more, more!
Uranus, on the other hand, is a bit of a disappointment. Stuffy, you
could say. Even Voyager 2 detected only the merest wisps of turbulence
rippling its apparently featureless surface. Uranus is a yawn.
Well, not quite. Its colour is a dreamy turquoise, for one thing. And
Uranus, apart from being very big (more than 14 times the mass of the
earth) is so tilted that during its long orbit first one pole and then
the other is pointed towards the sun. This circuit round the sun takes
84 earth years to complete.
When Voyager 2 passed by in 1986 the planet was so placed that its
rings could be seen as a full circle rather than an ellipse. When the
rings come full circle next -- it happens every 42 years -- we shall be
looking at their other side.
Think of a planet with rings round it and you're likely to have Saturn
in mind. Oddly, on May 22 Saturn will appear nude, apparently having
shed its spectacular rings. On that date the earth moves into the same
plane as Saturn's rings, which will therefore be angled exactly edge-on
to us. The ring band is so thin that we shall be unable to detect it.
It's a temporary aberration. The rings will return to view on May 23.
Mars will still be visible in May, but not at its best. Towards the
end of the month it will pass close to Regulus. Jupiter, too, is not
ideally placed for observation, being low in the southern sky.
The brightest star in the northern hemisphere will be Arcturus, one of
the Bootes constellation. Arcturus is welcome as a harbinger of spring.
Close observation shows it to have an orange tinge -- and it is in fact
a red giant.
Red giants are elderly stars which have used up all their hydrogen in
a lifetime's chemical reactions. Because of this they expand to an
immense size, cooling rapidly as they do so. A reverse process follows
in which the red giant shrinks drastically and becomes a white dwarf.
First a giant, then a dwarf -- that's the future for our sun, too.
Worry not. We'll not be around to know it.

Environment
IF YOU'VE ever eaten a ''bad'' oyster, mussel, or other shellfish,
you'll know the consequences can be devastating. Brevetoxin B is the
culprit, and it belongs to a family of neurotoxins responsible for
massive fish kills and human poisoning around the world.
The bacterium is produced during ''red tide'' incidents when marine
algae suddenly multiply to form vast coloured rafts of phytoplankton.
Sea creatures eat the plankton, carrying the poison through the food
chain resulting in diarrhoea, breathing problems, and even memory loss.
Researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego,
California, have been investigating the notorious killer for more than
12 years and have now succeeded in synthesising the ladder
like molecule. Their work will help scientists understand how these
poisons work, how to treat victims, and how to control red tides caused
by algae blooms.
European incidents of red tides, with associated shellfish poisoning,
include a large bloom in the Northern Adriatic in 1988. Blooms found
around the British Isles can lead to outbreaks of mussel poisoning. Red
tides, though, can actually provide an environmentally friendly way of
removing heavy metal contamination from water. The Japanese Government
Industrial Research Institute  has discovered that phytoplankton is very
efficient at removing metals such as cadmium and copper.

* Although laptops can be a boon to those who work on the hoof, a
major drawback is the cost of replacement batteries and the fact that
the little sods usually go phut when you've no spare pack and you're
right in the middle of a report for the CEO.
A new device on the market plugs into a car's cigarette lighter and
its main advantage, the makers claim, is its capability of powering up

Military body armour can protect the wearer against many types of
bullet injuries, but it is not stab resistant nor is it appropriate for
people such as doctors, ambulance crews, and police officers.
Researchers at Glasgow University are working on the development of
knife-resistant armour that could offer protection to both military and
civilian personnel.
* The University of Dundee has established Scotland's first Chair in
Gender Relations, funded by AT &amp; T Global Information Solutions
(Scotland) Ltd.
* IBM (Big Blue to the cognoscenti) is adopting a new worldwide
approach to the marketing of its computer technology and three Scottish
companies are at the forefront of the strategy. Campbell Lee in Falkirk,
Quorum Systems of Livingston, and Dunedin Systems of Glasgow have been
appointed as the first IBM Business Centres in the UK.
* Scotland's biomedical industry is offering opportunities to school
leavers and graduates who are interested in a career in this growing
sector. Further info from Pat Cairney, 0141 945 1934.
* The proliferation of home PCs, faxes, modems, and high speed
telecomms is having a direct impact on the number of Scottish people who
choose to work from home. According to Scottish Homes, 60,000 Scots
worked from home in 1981; by 1991 the figure had jumped to 105,000, and
it has been increasing ever since. Copies of the report will be
available to the public in the autumn. Contact Karen Watt on 0131 313

* Professor Alan Newell, Deputy Principal of the University of Dundee,
has been awarded the Lloyd Kilgerran Prize -- an honour recognising the
application of science to the benefit of society -- by the Foundation
for Science &amp; Technology.
* Britain's Natural History Museum, which houses the largest
biological research institute in the UK with more than 800 staff and an

Education
WHAT IS nanotechnology, how does a particle accelerator work, can you
find out if new and emerging technologies will have an impact on your
business or home life, and where on earth do you find an expert who is
capable of explaining complex theories in language we can all
understand?
The British Association for the Advancement of Science has an
excellent scheme called Talking Science+ through which companies,
schools, and community groups can access a national database of speakers
in every field of science, engineering, technology, and social sciences.
Everyone on the database has been selected for an ability to communicate
science subjects to a non-specialist audience, and some speakers need no
payment other than travelling expenses.
Jane Mole at the association usually tries to match requests to a
local speaker, but she can also find an international high-flyer for
major events or conferences. ''It is important that we take science and
technology out of the universities and research centres and into the
workplace, schools, colleges, and community groups,'' she said.
For more information call 0171 287 0980, or write to Jane Mole,
Talking Science+, British Association, 23 Savile Row, London WIX 2NB.

Predictions
BY THE year 2010, queues at train and bus stations could be a thing of
the past. A personal digital assistant (PDA) in your pocket will let you
plan and book travel without going near a ticket office. It will also
provide up-to-the minute information on delays and suggest alternative
routes.
This is just one of the predictions identified by the UK Technology
Foresight Programme which deliberates on how technology will impact on
our everyday lives. Their Delphic Oracle also predicts we will all have
a ''virtual bank'' in our home or office through which we will pay
bills, manage investments and debts, conduct tax affairs, organise
insurance and pensions, and cash will be provided electronically via a
smart card.
In 2010 we will all be wearing a device for monitoring air pollution,
pollen and ozone levels, and doctors will have our whole genetic make-up
on file. At home, there will be central locking, smart sensors will shut
off gas and electricity and act as intruder alarms when we're out, and
the only missing link in a fully automated lives will be a device to
teach the cat how to open the tin or pour itself some milk.
Summary leaflets on five sectors -- Chemicals, Construction, Financial
Services, Health and Life Sciences, and Transport -- are available from
the Office of Science and Technology, Albany House, 84-86 Petty France,
London SW1 9ST. Full reports, priced #15 each, are available from HMSO.

Humour can be the key when translating technical
gobbledegook into something the masses
will understand, as Yvonne Wightman explains.
WRITING about science and technology can be as difficult as reading
about science and technology. Yawn-inducing tomes of gobbledegook rank
alongside colonic irrigation in the pleasure stakes, yet millions of
pounds are spent encouraging learned bodies and bods to convey their
cerebral content to us, the great unwashed, in user-friendly language.
Trouble is, though, many researchers, scientists, and academics spend
years locked in their eyries investigating conceptual difficulties on a
balance of probabilities, with the sole goal of seeing their name in
print in some obscure journal.
Mind you, bodies such as the Institute of Physics, The Royal Society,
The Office of Science and Technology, and the American Association for
the Advancement of Science all appear to have discovered the knack of
transferring gigabytes of knowledge from genii into the lesser cortex of
society's drones. Humour is the key.
If it can be explained in words of one syllable, made pertinent to our
everyday lives, and has an element of rib-tickling, we're off and
running down the superhighway of information, with the grey matter
accelerator pedal to the floor. I am indebted to Paul Dougan, editor of
Catalyst Magazine, published by the University of Glasgow, for the
following examples of scientific journalistic excellence:
Electricity is actually made up of extremely tiny particles, called
electrons, that you cannot see with the naked eye unless you have been
drinking. Electrons travel at the speed of light, which in most Scottish
homes is 110 volts per hour. This is very fast. In the time it has taken
to read this sentence, an electron could have travelled all the way from
San Francisco to Cumbernauld, although God alone knows why it would want
to.
The five main kinds of electricity are alternating current, direct
current, lightning, static, and Edinburgh. Most Scottish homes have
alternating current, which means that the electricity goes in one
direction for a while, then goes in the other direction. This prevents
harmful electron build-up in the wires.
And on the subject of the rather risque reproductive cycle of birds:
When birds want to reproduce, they fly up and stand on telephone lines,
where they monitor telephone conversations with their feet. When they
find a conversation in which people are talking dirty, they grip the
line very tightly until they are both highly aroused, at which point the
female gets pregnant.
On a serious note, folks, if you have a science question that's
keeping you awake at night, write to us and we will pass your
correspondence to a tame academic. Alternatively, you can fax your
question to Glasgow University on 0141 330 4206.

FOR those who can't bear to be away from their PC for more than a few
nanoseconds, the Timex Data Link watch could prevent them from
experiencing RAM withdrawal syndrome -- many IT people suffer from this
debilitating inability to converse with anything other than a screen.
Developed in conjunction with Microsoft, the Windows-compatible watch
downloads information from a PC by simply pointing the device at the
screen -- the sensor reads a flashing bar code and, in seconds, up to 70
entries can be stored on your wrist.
Functions include appointments, phone numbers, anniversaries, to-do
lists, time zones, and alarm settings. It even tells the time so users
can calculate how long until their next gigabyte fix.
The watch retails for around #120. For local stockists tel: UK Time on

Software
THE information highway promises a continuous flow of information
gleaned from many sources. However, the reality is often a sea of data
with islands of non-integrated text, images, and other materials that
co-exist but do not work together, resulting in an ocean of information
that threatens to drown the user.
A new software product from Oracle, TextServer3 with ConText, offers
what the creators claim is a ''landmark breakthrough in integrated
information management''. The software uses its ''intelligence'' and a
600,000-word dictionary to smart-search, analyse, and understand the
meaning of millions of documents, weeding through gigabytes of
irrelevant text until it identifies the precise result required by the
user.
''Today's businesses require a quick response, but the sheer volume of
information is overwhelming, rendering much of it useless because it's
difficult to process,'' said Farzad Dibachi of Oracle's New Media
Division.
In traditional text retrieval systems, a search for ''terminal'' would
retrieve all documents containing the key word, regardless of the
context, but ConText ''understands'' word connotations and can
distinguish when terminal is used in the sense of computer terminal,
train or bus terminal, or terminal illness. In fact, users don't even
have to specify a key word, as the software has the ability to detect
themes in documents.
This thinking data-bank can even do its own writing and editing, as
users can access varying levels of summarisation from the original
WYSIWYG (what you see, is what you get) version and the speed-read
facility can then edit the copy by 50% or red-pencil it down to 10%.
This little electronic worm even has the cheek to delete anything that
doesn't directly contribute to the reader's understanding of the
writer's intention.

COMMUNICATIONS
SCOTTISH company Linburg Ltd of Dunfermline has moved one step closer
to the days when we will be able to phone home and instruct our house to
get ready for our arrival.
Linburg has linked with Philips to launch a revolutionary
telephone-based system that has the potential to turn our dumb homes
into smart homes. Initially, the new ''intelligent'' phone will be used
to control domestic energy systems, but in the future it could be
extended to incorporate numerous functions such as home shopping,
restaurant bookings, and theatre tickets, with everything being carried
out interactively from the phone.
The phone is on the market now, but its price of #500 probably means
that it will appeal to the commercial sector -- companies involved in
new house building, for example -- but over time the price should come
down, making it more attractive to the general public.
Details from: Hugh Smeaton, Linburg Ltd on 01383 732231.

In the shadow of bustling
Spanish holiday resorts
lies a largely undiscovered
gem, protected by a rugged
coastline from the invasion
of tourism. Jill Crawshaw
goes off the beaten track to
unveil a secret land steeped
in tradition and romance.
THE Costa Brava may have some of the brashest resorts in Europe, but
much of it is still the Continent's best-kept holiday secret. It runs
from the French border to Blanes, 90 miles of rugged and deeply indented
coves that illustrate the world ''brava'' used by the proud seafaring
Catalans to mean craggy, wild, and even dangerous.
In the north, still unspoilt and very Spanish, still very brava, the
area is protected from mass tourism by the freaks of geography, the
steep cliffs and twisting corkscrew bends. It is further south, where
the land flattens, that the popspots begin. However, much of those first
rugged 90 miles contain holiday hideouts with every ingredient for
superb vacations.
The scenery is some of the finest in Europe, with deserted coves and
clear water backed by olive groves and pinewoods, almond, fig, and cork
trees, craggy mountains that sweep almost to the jagged inlets.
The resorts -- 20 or so of them -- each have a character of their own.
The dignified San Feliu; the exclusive and elusive S'Agaro, where the
wealthy Spanish (and even a few Brits) sip chilled sherry on the
balconies of their luxury villas; Tamariu, named after the feathery
tamarisk trees, a great favourite with families whose children can play
safely among the lobster pots; or Aiguablava, round the next bay, with
its state-owned Parador, although the most famous hotel in the area (and
one of the finest in the world) is the Hostal del la Gavina, where the
rich and famous meander among priceless antiques and lush gardens.
For those seeking the traditional fishing village there is Cadaques
near the French border, all white and dazzling. Salvador Dali built his
home in nearby Port Lligat -- but even without his recommendation,
British visitors have described the place as the most beautiful in the
world.
Behind the resort is a hinterland of stupendous hilltop medieval
villages such as Pals and Peratallada, with golden walls and narrow,
secretive streets. In Figueras there is the most loved and visited
museum in Spain after Madrid's Prado -- the jokey, surreal Teatro Museo
Dali.
On a day trip behind the Costa lies the inland lake of Banolas, which
offers waterskiing and sailing, and there are some 2000 monasteries and
Roman churches scattered around the mountains.
REACH FOR THE BEACH
THE Costa has the beaches to end all beaches, the finest in the
Mediterranean -- the Playa de Mitjorn is five miles of flat, golden sand
with the odd flurry of holidaymakers at either end and huge, empty
expanses in the middle. The beaches of Illetas and Levante stretch even
further down a long sandy spit, some only reached by boat; no-one will
bother you if you swim topless, bottomless, or fully dressed.
Cala Sahona is the perfect family beach in an exquisite horseshoe of a
bay, lined with boathouses, where the fishermen come down with their
families on Sundays and cook huge paellas on open fires. The main resort
of Es Pujols has a series of fun beaches separated by breakwaters,
backed by cafes, boutiques, and small bars.
Formentera is about an hour's bouncy ferry ride from Ibiza, a fifth of
the size, and you can drive the whole length in half an hour. It takes a
little longer by bike, the favourite form of transport on this eccentric
little island with its grand name, from the Latin word for granary --
the population cultivated grain for Roman soldiers.
Today there are about 4000 locals who still make their living fishing
and farming, producing wine and cheese. It certainly isn't standard
package-holiday material, since there is no airport, only one main road,
a few night-clubs and discos certainly, but a lot more saltpans,
photogenic windmills, flat fields, drystone walls, and huge cacti.
Hippies are almost indigenous, mainly of the 1960s vintage when they
came for a song to the tiny capital of San Francisco -- they couldn't
afford the fare to their real mecca. They look somewhat older now but
blend in, many still making a living selling jewellery at the daily
market in the capital's streets.
There's little that's trendy about San Francisco -- a lot of it seems
to be made up of repair garages and banks -- but there is a chunky
eighteenth-century church, a clutch of tapas bars, and a thoroughly
pleasant little square in which its inhabitants while away the day. It's
that sort of island.
GREEN FOR GO
IT'S not true that the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain -- it
buckets down on the mountain villages of Asturias and its aptly named
coastline, the Costa Verde, on the Atlantic north coast of Spain.
But if you're prepared to pack your brolly and walking boots, you'll
discover a Spain that is a world away from its stereotype, where they
drink cider instead of wine, eat beans (fabadas) instead of paella,
trout and salmon from mountain streams instead of Mediterranean seafood,
sing soulful laments instead of the fierce flemenco of the south, and
where Spandiards spend their holidays fishing, walking, canoeing, or
mountaineering instead of sunbathing on the beach.
Even the coast is a revelation; round every bend there's a promise of
a genuine fishing village where the catch counts before tourists, in
coves with a sweep of yellow sand washed clean by the Atlantic rollers
-- some of the best around Llanes.
Or a craggy, rugged stretch of coastline like the Cabo Penas, west of
Gijon (pronounced ''He-hon''). This is cave country too -- base yourself
at the resort of Ribadesella or the medieval gem of Santilla del Mar
further east, and you can gaze on historic cave paintings of animal
hunters, some uncovered only a few months ago.
Wind your way along the little roads through meadows full of wild
flowers and little storage barns on stilts called ''Horreos'', past
limestone foothills until you reach the tortuous winding roads that lead
to Nothern Spain's National Park, the Picos de Europa. It is austerely
beautiful, with dramatic gorges, bizarre crags, shared by wolves and
chamois, wild boar, eagles and vultures alike and any number of huddled
mountain villages -- the reconquest of Spain from the Moors, for
example, began in 716 AD at Covadonga. The little market town of Potes
is surrounded by the loftiest peaks in the Picos and from it there is
one of the most spectacular drives in the range, with the sheer walls
and the cable car on Fuente De giving a view that defies description.
CAPITAL CHOICE
MADRID is Europe's secret capital, even within its own country, far
less known than passionate Seville or exuberant Barcelona. It is a city
that doesn't flaunt its attractions. To get the feel of the real
heartbeat of the city, you need to head away from the great boulevards
planned by the Bourbon kings, towards the old tiny, cramped medieval
quarter, the Puerta del Sol. From here all distances in Spain are
measured, tiny shops still specialise in fans and mantillas, and locals,
the most insomniac in the world, throng the streets until the early
hours.
They spend many of these hours in the tascas of streets such as the
Calle Echegeray, where just about every building has a tiny bar on the
ground floor. Sawdust on the floor, smoked hams hanging from the
ceilings and the dishes on the wooden bar include squid, tripe, snails,
mushrooms, prawns, artichokes, huge olives and red-hot peppers and
Spanish omelettes. It's almost obligatory that you throw down your paper
napkin (they're actually a quarter of a paper napkin) on the floor after
each course.
If the Prado is well documented with its staggering collection of
Goyas, Velasquez, El Grecos and Murillos, and its most recent
acquisition, Picasso's Guernica, the little Museo Galdiano has few
crowds, great Spanish painting, even a Leonardo da Vinci portrait.
Despite its frequently grandiose architecture, Madrid can present a
very human, even earthy face.
In the great Plaza Mayor, the main square built by Philip III in the
early seventeenth century as an act of one-upmanship, where the cream of
Madrid society used to scramble for seats for mounted bullfights and the
auto-de-fe, the burning of the heretics, the elegant colonnades now play
host every Sunday to philatelists and numismatists, browsing, selling
and swapping the stamps and coins of hundreds of countries, many no
longer on any map.
There's noisier bargaining at the nearby Rastro Flea Market, also held
on Sunday mornings. Much of it is pure junk, but entertaining
nevertheless as its thronged clientele search for a long-lost Goya among
the stalls of bicycle sprockets, army surplus gaiters, and pirate
cassettes.
Goya himself lived in Toledo, just one of the fascinating towns within
easy reach of Madrid. The eleventh-century walled city of Avila is
another. Perched like a crown of golden stone on the top of the hill, it
lours over the countryside, immense, impregnable, defiant.
In Segovia, an enormous Roman aqueduct strides across the sky and
beneath its huge granite arches, which were constructed without cement
or mortar, the townsfolk scuttle about their business. High above is the
Alcazar fortress, another almost inhuman extravaganza seemingly
suspended in the sky, like the prow of an Armada galleon.

It takes all kinds, they say, and William Russell
certainly encountered a plethora of colourful
characters as he patrolled both sides of the tracks
in Barcelona. The vibrant, beautiful Spanish city
has everything for the tourist, from superb
eating places to a clutch of astonishing buildings.
THE camera can lie. The reason I decided to go to Spain this spring,
to a country never before visited, was Whit Stillman's film, Barcelona.
Managing to avoid the usual tourist brochure cliches of a film set in a
beautiful city -- think of the times you have seen Edinburgh Castle or
Tower Bridge, invariably cheek by jowl with some other monument several
miles away -- Stillman's camera portrayed a vibrant and beautiful city
that I just had to see. When I got there I didn't recognise a thing.
That is the bad news. The good news is that Barcelona is a vibrant and
beautiful city, provided you avoid backstreet bars recommended by Mr
Doug Gillon, who writes in The Herald's sports pages. I happened to be
in Barcelona at the same time as Mr Tom Shields and the lovely Miss
Melanie. Tom, being a man of parts, had been told by the aforesaid
Gillon about this wee howf behind a splendid restaurant called Los
Caracoles, both of which had been patronised by sporting hacks during
the Olympic Games. Having dined well on suckling pig, we set forth in
search of afters.
The bar's faade was unprepossessing, and it was only at Miss Melanie's
insistence and against our better judgment that we went inside. It was
not exactly empty, but nearly so. Business was patently slack. There was
a large table of Spaniards at the back, and opposite the long bar a
smaller group -- a lady of uncertain age with a missing front tooth in a
black jump-suit, a man with a guitar, another man who looked like
Liberace's older brother, and a fourth who was nondescript -- huddled at
a table. We ordered three brandies, which were large. The group roused
itself from its torpor, the guitarist started to strum, and the lady in
the jump-suit and Liberace's older brother went into their dance. Then
Miss Melanie joined in the clapping.
It was all very jolly, and after some minutes it was suggested we
should buy our companions a refreshment. Scotsmen always stand their
round, so we obliged. When we got the bill, we left. Mr Shields, who
speaks the language, queried the total, but the owner shrugged his
shoulders, said that the four -- even the nondescript, do-nothing man
got a drink -- had had whisky, and that was how much it cost. We went to
another bar to recover, ordered three more brandies, and nearly drowned
in our sorrows -- they cost what one drink had cost in the other place.
We had fallen victim to the curse of Hola!
But don't let me put you off. Barcelona has everything -- splendid
restaurants, tapas bars to tempt you to gorge on pieces of this, that,
and the next thing, a medieval area called the Barri Gotic with narrow
streets like the calles of Venice, and a main drag, the Ramblas, down
which everyone walks, lined with trees and shops and living statues. It
runs from the Placa de Catalunya, the heart of the city, to the
waterfront. Beyond the Placa Catalunya lies Eixample, the
nineteenth-century town centre, a grid pattern of streets as elegant as
Paris.
The city's treasures include some truly astonishing buildings, many
designed by Antonio Gaudi, any one of which would give Prince Charles a
heart attack. Gaudi's cathedral, La Sagrada Familia, has to be seen to
be believed, a masonry wedding cake in the throes of a nervous collapse,
while Domenichi i Montaner's Palau de la Musica will astound from the
outside and dumbfound once inside. It is a case of anything goes.
You can eat tapas, drink wine, have your pocket picked, dance until
dawn -- the night-life starts around midnight, so a siesta helps -- and
dine at prices that mean you can eat twice as much the next time.
Rip-offs do happen, as we found out, but value for money was just as
prevalent. Barcelona is also easy to get round. The Barri Gotic and the
Ramblas are a pedestrian's paradise, while for the longer trips the
metro system is a piece of cake.
The best bit came last. We decided to try the night-life proper and
went to the Bodega Bohemia, which is just off the Ramblas behind Gaudi's
glorious Palau Guell, a townhouse built for a textile baron whose
art-nouveau splendours are a bit like Charles Rennie Mackintosh meets
Dracula. This one-room cabaret bar is just on the edge of the red-light
district, so venturing deeper into the mesh of streets behind it is
maybe not a good idea. For #5 entry, including one drink, we found
ourselves in a low-ceilinged room full of bric-a-brac, stuffed with
small tables covered with red cloths at which were seated a clientele
best described as louche, being served by waiters who looked like
Quentin Crisp.
The entertainers sat along one side of the room awaiting their turn.
They were an amazing collection of singers, comedians, and drag artists,
all of uncertain age. We had only one drink, because every drink cost a
fiver, but nobody seemed to mind that we sat happily for nearly two
hours over that one beer each. Miss Melanie did, actually, but we
shushed her up.
We did not understand the jokes, which was probably just as well,
because the ladies in the audience who did were quite doubled up with
laughter, which means they must have been filthy. But we did enjoy the
music, some of it to backing tapes, some provided by a pianist strumming
at a rackety old upright. I might tell Mr Gillon where it is, should he
ever go back to Barcelona. The only awkward moment came when one of the
romantic ballad singers, having murdered something Spanish, chose for
his second number Strangers in the Night. Luckily, Miss Melanie could
not remember the English lyrics or who knows what would have happened.

APRIL snow had dipped the Cuillin of Rum in icing sugar. We left the
castle at dawn and peched and sweated up to the snowline. Below the
crags the talus slopes were snow-covered and the snow was marked with
tramples, slides, scuffs, and prints, as if a battle had been fought and
the warriors had vanished. Then, returning that night along the cliff
path after dark, the air above was riven with loud eerie cries -- ''ca
ca cow ooh'' suddenly, then silence. Again, further away -- and then
loudly, close overhead. A disorientating sense of invisible movement. No
wonder the Norsemen called the next mountain Trollvall.
What had left the chaos in the snow 2000 feet up? What were the
trolls, that had gone by first light? Manx Shearwaters, lean and
graceful wave-skimmers who are related to the albatross. They slide over
the wave tops, flashing black and white as they turn, and seem to shear
the water as a ploughshare shears the earth -- both words have the same
Saxon origin. Another old name for Shearwaters in the northern islands
is ''lyrie'' as in the saying ''to gan as licht as a lyrie''. Now in
April here they were, back from Brazil to nest in the remote Hebrides:
150,000 pairs of them on the one hill on Rum.
They gather in ''rafts'' offshore and come to land after the gloaming
ends to escape the talons of golden eagles and the beaks of the big
gulls. On still silver Hebridean evenings a boat will put up thousands,
like leaves kicked gently from the sea's surface and with the same
rustling patter. They nest in burrows and in September the starved young
creep out alone to take off for the sea and the south. Those who have
not plucked up the courage by daylight are sometimes eaten for their
calcium by their strangest predator: red deer.

When Herald man Stephen McGinty's sister and a young Scots friend went
to India on a work placement, little did they realise that they were
about
to enter a hell on earth for those who suffer from leprosy. The girls
were to find the experience both heartbreaking and uplifting
THERE are no lepers in Sumana Halli. The name of the clinic in the
Indian city of Bangalore means the Village of Good Will. There is little
good will in the word ''leper'', a squat, ugly, small word that inflicts
a deeper cut than the disease it describes. In a country of castes,
leprosy sufferers are castaways, cast out, adrift, despised. The Leper
Act, law until 1992, prohibited sufferers from seeking employment.
Begging, too, was banned and carried a two-year sentence in special
leprosy prisons. India is a country that cherishes the sanctity of
marriage, yet discovery of the disease remains grounds for divorce.
So there are no lepers in Sumana Halli, only leprosy patients,
workers, clergy, and my little sister. For six months Alison, 21, from
Clydebank, has worked with another young Scot, Katrina Dougan, 18, from
Larbert, at the Rehabilitation and Training Centre down the deep and
dusty end of Magadi Road, which rolls out from Bangalore city centre. As
I travel along it from the airport, in the jeep with the girls, Thomas
Mathew, the administrator, and Father Peter D'Souza, the centre's
director, India assaults the senses.
Car horns are the Indian brakes used to avoid collisions, and from the
back of a speeding jeep the view is of rising dust, buses packed to
capacity, rinky-dink rickshaw scooters, garish movie posters, and
giant-rising statues to Hindu gods. Ragged beggars, cow-drawn carts, and
commuters dressed smartly in shirts and trousers, women in bright saris
and coloured salwars, troop past the open flaps.
The evening rose with the road up through the gates of Sumana Halli
towards the complex and a night of all-round introductions, talks,
bottles of Pepsi, and beer. From the concrete cell with the shuttered
windows, a bucket for a bath and a hole for a loo, where I dumped my
gear, the girls toured me round to the Franciscan sisters of the
Immaculate who sat me on a sofa that should have been sodden. ''This is
where they came to weep when homesick,'' they laughed, one holding
Katrina's hand.
In India, contact is often close: women hold hands and kiss each
other, men walk hand in hand, teenage boys drape an arm over a pal's
shoulder without a second thought. Greetings are equally effusive.
Katrina, Alison, and I nod and say namaste, a greeting in the Kanada
language. You raise your hands as if in prayer while nodding. It was in
this manner, outside in the evening gloom, that I met my first leprosy
sufferer.
It was while walking to the hut on the hill where dinner was being
served that I encountered Krisinappa, the Grand Old Man of Sumana Halli.
Seeing a figure in the dim light, I moved forward with my practised
greeting. He, too, smiled and raised his arms to reveal not hands but
stumps, worn smooth and slightly pointed. No shock, or surprise, just a
glance, then back to his smile. It is not the stumps, wounds, growths,
or distress you remember from Sumana Halli, but the beaming toothpaste
smiles.
LEPROSY afflicts more than 14 million people world-wide, four million
in India alone, where it concentrates in the states of Karnataka,
Maharashtra, and the northern states of West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.
Medical books from 1400 BC mentioned the disease, a statue of a man's
face afflicted with leprosy was found in China, dated 1411 BC. The
biblical references to ''lepers'' are a strong source of people's
prejudice.
It is not a curse, but a disease caused by the microbacterium leprae,
also called Hansen's Disease after the Norwegian physician who
discovered it. The image of rotten noses and clawed hands comes when the
disease is untreated for many years. The infection spreads by close
contact through saliva, coughs, and sneezes. The natural body defences
of 95% of those infected overcome the infection. The remaining 5% show
symptoms such as numb skin patches, weak fingers, and oily, reddish
skin.
Like mercury in a Petri dish, the disease subdivides again into
infectious and non-infectious strains. In the early stages, a
six-to-twelve-month drug programme of Dapsome and Riamicipin will cure
non-infectious patients. Infectious patients are treated with an extra
drug, Clofazimine, and examined for three to five years in a bid to
catch the 3-5% who relapse.
Untreated leprosy results in patches rising above the skin, the nerves
in the face and limbs thicken, sensation is lost in the feet, and ulcers
develop. Nerve damage results in clawed fingers and foot-drop. Limbs are
lost through amputation as they become rotten with infection. Rats have
often gnawed away fingers and toes as the sufferer sleeps unaware.
As yet no vaccine exists to prevent leprosy. Scientists until recently
were unable to grow cell cultures outside the human body. However,
successful tests have been carried out on the nine-banded armadillo.
Bacteria has been grown and development of a vaccine is now a
possibility. Alison and Katrina knew nothing of this when asked by
Scottish Churches World Exchange to work in Sumana Halli, over one
weekend last May.
Alison, in her final year tackling biochemistry and pharmacology at
Strathclyde University, and Katrina wanted to work abroad for a year and
contacted the Edinburgh-based organisation that arranges suitable
placements. It was at a training weekend that they were asked to go to
India.
I remember the phone call.
''They want me to work in a leprosy centre.''
''Oh!''
''I don't think I can handle it.''
Dad didn't want her to go; mum thought she should. The rest of us,
Claire, Paul, and I, thought it was a holiday. Katrina, then a
17-year-old at Dollar Academy, was more pragmatic. She had diagnosed
herself too immature for university and wanted to work abroad. Though
worried, they both went through with it.
IT'S just after breakfast, and Katrina is wielding a scalpel, cutting
infected skin from the soles of a smiling 13-year-old's feet. The sun is
burning through the clinic's side door and on to the faces of those who
smile and wait. Among the collection of middle-aged women, elderly men,
and schoolchildren is Krisinappa. Without hands he picks roses with his
teeth to sell outside, but thorns infect his stumps, which must be
cleaned and bound.
After years of the disease destroying the nerve ends, many patients
have little sensation in the soles of their feet and so cuts become
infected. It took two months before Katrina, under the guidance of
Sister Raja and Fatima, could handle the scalpel and face the sights she
saw. ''The worst was having to pick maggots out from someone's foot. I
thought I was going to faint. I managed one, then the doctor took
over.''
The doctor comes twice a week to monitor the patients' progress and
handle difficult procedures such as planing stumps. Dr Sreekantaiah
tells jokes about leprosy. As one of Bangalore's top humorists, a
regular on radio and TV talk shows, he wields laughs to make serious
points.
''In India,'' he said, ''if you are a man it is considered lucky to
have a white mark appear on your right arm. If you are a woman, it is
lucky if it appears on your left arm. Now a white mark is an early sigh
of leprosy. But instead of getting it checked they will go out and buy a
lottery ticket.''
The occupants of the wards behind the clinic lost in the lottery. On
eight thin metal beds and under draped mosquito-nets elderly patients
sat or lay. They have been afflicted by the disease for decades. One old
woman sat on her cot staring blindly, hands gnarled, head almost
hairless. Alison explained that they have nowhere else to go. But on the
hill there was a little hope -- a new home for the elderly, now close to
completion.
In the simple huts that house many of the patients, one man was raging
as he sat on his porch. He had no legs. ''They have no pity, five years
I have walked on my bare hands, and they call themselves Christians.''
WHEN the Christians came first in 1976, the site of Sumana Halli was a
beggars' colony and the dormitories were lock-ups for leprosy sufferers
who broke the Beggary Prohibition Act. The Chief Minister of Karnataka
State had appealed to the Archbishop of Bangalore to set up a relief
centre. So various religious congregations pooled resources to convert
the 63 acres of land into a little hope in hell.
Huts were built to shelter the old and crippled, driven by the disease
from their homes and on to the streets. To preserve unity, whole
families were taken in while one member was treated on the new drug
programme. Education and re-training in leather goods, knitting, and
printing were provided. ''Many were leprosy beggars and it was essential
to motivate them away from accepting easy money,'' said Thomas Mathew,
the centre's administrator.
''You cannot understand their feelings. They cannot go and visit their
own family, who do not want to know them. They have had to beg. We try
to teach them the dignity and self-respect of work.'' Human contact is
also precious to the patients, and the visits of student doctors,
seminarians, and the Scottish volunteers are important.
''When they see people from other cultures and other places they feel
they are worthwhile, they are given a second boost of self-esteem and
they then go one step forward . . . When people at sales conventions see
Alison and Katrina selling the goods the patients make it's a prick to
their conscience.''
Father Peter, the centre's director, is pleased with the girls'
progress. ''They have made a strong effort with both the patients and
staff and are well liked.'' His work extends beyond Sumana Halli to the
city office of the Urban Leprosy Control Unit, staffed by paramedics and
nurses who travel into slums and residential areas to detect the early
stages of the disease.
PHOTOGRAPHY is a contact sport at Sumana Halli. I learned this at the
printing press and leather workshop where Alison prepares orders,
accounts, and the syllabus for trainees. After taking pictures, I was
press-ganged by wide smiles to pose for a group picture. As I was
pressed and squeezed between the patients there were arms all around my
shoulders and waist. It felt great, but was over in a flash.
That night, over dinner, I talked with Alison and Katrina about their
arrival and work since September. After the culture shock of a night in
Bombay it took weeks to settle in Sumana Halli. Both were homesick. ''We
just made a pact. We couldn't go back home, we couldn't quit, not after
our churches and so many people had raised so much money,'' said Alison.
There had been a few culture clashes, but the girls realise they are
guests in a foreign land. The hospitality and generosity of everyone
they have met more than made up for restrictions. The poverty, though
painful, had to be accepted. And both do the best they can to help.
But both have felt helpless.
Katrina: ''There was one little boy who had a bad reaction to the
drugs and he was in agony. I was just rubbing his arms and talking to
him. There wasn't much you could do.''
Alison: ''There is a boy who had a club foot through leprosy and he
went to stay with his uncle, a man who had leprosy, and had been cured
at Sumana Halli, but he wouldn't take the boy because of the disease.
That's hard to accept.''
SISTER Mary is a cannonball of goodwill who, the next morning, rolled
right over me. The recipient of various awards for her work in Sumana
Halli through the Sisters of St Joseph of Tarbes, she breaks down
barriers of prejudice in her work as an employment placement officer. As
an antidote to the depression of the disease she sings Sumana Halli's
successes.
''Jesus was the one person to heal the leprosy patients and integrate
them back into society. He said go to the temple!'' Instead, we visit
Sadanada in his leather workshop and home in a little cluster of huts
outside the gates at Magadi Road. ''He came to Sumana Halli in 1980 like
a dying duck.'' Highly infectious leprosy had crippled him with
foot-drop, and the Bangalore hospital could do nothing.
Drug treatments, reconstructive surgery, and physiotherapy have
restored him to a strong, middle-aged man. The only reminder of the
disease was one knotted hand and the loss of his parents' love. Though
employing other patients in his own leather factory, married and with
his dignity restored, Sadanada cannot go home. His brothers and sisters
visit him, his parents will not. ''I have learned to harden my heart,''
he said.
Other successes include Ramesh, Erappa, Savithra, and Ghuni, who all
won government awards as Best Employees in various jobs. ''What we are
fighting for is full social status, rights, and privileges.'' It is a
long, hard fight with setbacks and heartaches, but those in Sumana Halli
know it is just.
On my last night I met Nurilinga.
Throughout India, Hindus were celebrating Holee, the festival of
light, by dousing themselves in paint and dancing through the streets.
As I stood on the porch waiting with the girls for Father Peter and his
jeep, a dark figure waved and was suddenly illuminated by the
approaching headlights.
Nurilinga, though crippled and on crutches, was covered in red paint.
The festival would not be denied to him.

Chosen at random, Il Grappolo had an unpromising pedigree but a
delightful personality all of its own, as Conrad Wilson discovers
AS A Glasgow-based Italian wine shop and grocer, Fratelli Sarti, at
the top of Wellington Street, is a bit like Edinburgh's long-established
Valvona and Crolla. But there is one big difference. Whereas both places
are packed to the rafters with wine, olive oil, salami, prosciutto,
coffee, pasta, panetone, and every conceivable Italian delicacy, Sarti
has somehow found space for a cafe restaurant occupying every
conceivable inch not already filled with enticing things to take home.
When the promised extension opens (probably this weekend) round the
corner in Bath Street, some of the pressure will be lifted. But if you
enjoy a bit of Italian chaos, this evocative recreation of a
stand-up-or-sit-down enoteca in Lucca, where the Sarti brothers come
from, is well worth a visit even as it is. Unlike one or two other
places of its kind in Scotland, it has an air of Tuscan authenticity.
While swallowing an espresso, you can wait for the right moment to
approach the wine counter and distract the busy Sandro and Piero from
their other duties. Since there is no printed wine list (not yet,
anyway) you will be dependent on their advice or on your ability to read
a wine label from a distance. Hastily grasping the nearest bottle last
week, I found it was a 1993 Bosco Nestore, a wine I'd never heard of,
and, at #12.50, a bit steeply priced for an Italian white. Would it be
the tall, elegant, wide-lipped designer bottle I was paying for, or the
wine itself?
I asked if they recommended it. They certainly did, in terms
convincing enough to make me take the risk. Because of its delicate
flavour, they said, I should cool the bottle rather than chill it. If I
did what they told me I would not be disappointed. Later that evening I
obeyed instructions. While the wine was cooling, I researched its
origins.
It came, I discovered, from the Abruzzo, the mountainous region
between Rome and the Adriatic. This seemed unpromising. ''A backward
region,'' sniffs Hugh Johnson in one of his wine books, ''with simple
ideas about wine.'' Its famous red Montepulciano is a bargain much
favoured by Scotland's Italian restaurants, but it can be rough and it
varies considerably from vineyard to vineyard. Its whites, being based
on what British wine writers tend to dismiss as the tedious trebbiano
grape, are not worth mentioning.
HOWEVER, my bottle was not based on trebbiano. Its contents were a
mixture of chardonnay and sauvignon -- grapes that Australia's flying
wine makers have recently been exploiting in Italy, to the delight of
British supermarkets. Would it, therefore, turn out to be just another
Australianised Italian white? My hopes, by then seriously dwindling,
were raised by the first taste. This was a wine which, to my palate, had
nothing Australian about it at all, but which was the sort of white you
are likely to be served in an exceptionally good Adriatic restaurant
around Pescara, along with a portion of the best fresh seafood.
It was certainly delicate, with hints of violets and biscuits, and
with a roundness that put it in a class apart from the neutral whites
generally favoured in Italy. At #12.50, of course, it was reaching into
the price scale of good burgundies, but I would not insult it by
weighing it against a Chablis or Meursault. This was a wine with its own
delightful personality. It is called Il Grappolo -- ''the bunch'' -- and
I'll be buying it again.

PHYSIOLOGY
THE sound of silence may at last descend on bedrooms throughout the
country, as researchers at the Royal Oldham Hospital in Lancashire
believe they have found a ''cure'' for snoring. Snoring is caused mostly
by the fluttering of the snorer's soft palate; the muscle relaxes during
sleep and vibrates with each breath.
Since the 1980s, the treatment used to shut up snorers has involved
radical surgery and, although effective, it can result in side effects.
The latest technique uses a hand-held carbon dioxide laser to remove a
minimal amount of tissue and stiffen the soft palate. Forty patients
have so far been treated at the hospital. ''The snoring sympton has been
greatly reduced or eliminated in virtually all the patients,'' said Dr
Virendar Sharma.

In Oxford, perceived as the ultimate bastion of upper-class university
life, there still exists
alongside the dreaming spires a massive, tense schism between town and
gown. John MacLeod, who
once hankered after a place there, experiences at first hand a campus
that is more
like a citadel and discovers back-street pubs that students dare not
frequent.
OXBRIDGE: the cosy club of England's great universities -- indeed,
almost into a living memory, England's only universities -- is an elite,
a magic circle, a communal myth slowly throttling to death the United
Kingdom. Graduates of Oxford and Cambridge still exert disproportionate
influence in our affairs. They dominate leadership in business and
banking. Our senior politicians are drawn largely from their fold; the
present Cabinet is full of Oxbridge graduates, and John Major is only
the third Prime Minister since the war not to rank among them.
Oxbridge writers such as Evelyn Waugh, Louis MacNeice, and John
Betjeman crown the recent history of English letters. Oxbridge wits --
from John Cleese to Stephen Fry via Rowan Atkinson -- decide what we
laugh at. Even the quality end of the Scottish press has been headed by
Oxbridge spawn. In certain London newspapers, the cachet of an Oxbridge
education is de rigueur.
A random scoop of 250 entries in Who's Who uncovers 106 Oxbridge
degrees; 43% of the House of Lords are Oxford or Cambridge graduates;
82% of all judges appointed to the Bench in 1993. Slowly, of course,
this hegemony is being eroded. But even as the seed of redbrick and
Scottish universities claw painfully to the top of affairs, the magic of
Oxbridge pulls in the brains of abroad. John Major did not ''come up''
to study. But Bill Clinton came across. It was at Oxford, as a Rhodes
Scholar in the late sixties, that the 42nd President did not inhale.
Meanwhile, as we thrill to mellow sun and old stone and hum the theme
from Brideshead Revisited, Britain's decline continues and the nation
goes to ruin. And the land will continue to decline, in wealth and
standing, until the whole Oxbridge nonsense is overthrown and we start
putting serious value on real education rather than on a certain social
cachet; that droll, sardonic way of speaking, that unruffled nostalgia
for a past young summer of black tie, evensong, and cool white wine.
That is the thesis of Walter Ellis, whose book The Oxbridge Conspiracy
-- an enjoyable, Whiggish hatchet-job on the establishment's Twin Peaks,
much in the tradition of Jeremy Paxman and Piers Brendon -- was a minor
best-seller in 1994. (But the Establishment recovers fast; Ellis was
recently invited to debate his thesis at the Oxford Union, and, I'm
told, did not acquit himself well.)
Still, could it be true? There was only one thing for it. I begged the
return fare from The Herald and went down to see Elysium for myself. I
chose Oxford, partly because -- at least in our recent political
leadership -- it has been dominant; partly because it inclines rather
more to the Arts than Cambridge, and I am an Arts graduate; and partly
because, had it not been for the want of #16 and my father's absence in
Australia during the autumn of 1983, I might well have won that degree
in Oxford.
I wanted to at the time -- very much. Snobbery was undoubtedly part of
it, the ruthless instinct of the young but upwardly mobile. Then there
was that strange Highland pride, that curious aspect of character which,
even today, is more at ease with the average upper-crust Englishman than
with the average Lowland Scot. And then -- I blush to tell -- I had an
intense political ambition in those days, and convinced myself that if I
could be at Oxford at 18 I could be Prime Minister at 40. As I was then
rabidly attached to the Scottish National Party, the nation's loss is
minimal.
But beyond that, there was the magic. The dreaming spires. The punts.
Old halls echoing to young life. The murmur of poplars, willows, and
river water in an English summer. Bizarre rituals, ancient customs,
quaint dress codes. It seemed to me another world, a world worth
experiencing and worth sharing; a world from which, once bonded, you
could never be cast out.
(Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, and friends devoted their Cambridge days
to sodomy and their adult lives to treason: but, even exposed, now
shamed and dead, they are still held in indulgent regard by
contemporaries.) I didn't make it. I wasn't allowed to try to make it.
And then, one February afternoon, a decade and more later . . .
Most of us know Oxford from television, and we know it largely from
two programmes: Granada TV's celebrated adaptation of Waugh's Brideshead
Revisited (1981) and, more recently, the much-loved adventures of
Inspector Morse, whose retirement in 1993 attracted bitter comment in
the Commons. The first epic, baroque, centred largely on vast homes,
romantic friendship, and Roman Catholicism. The second was big on
cynicism and Corelli. But even Inspector Morse does not prepare you for
the most striking aspect of Oxford to the Scots visitor: it is a
bitterly divided city.
Nowhere in Scotland, I think, is town and gown tension so palpable.
The university itself is less a campus than a citadel, a community
within a community, marked by a sudden broadening of streets and a
riotous symphony of stone. But it is a fair walk from Oxford's railway
station to the groves of academe. And the town centre is cramped,
jammed, ugly. The appalling Cornmarket Street is a heaving thoroughfare
of tacky shop fronts and common plebs that makes Fort William seafront
look like Britain in Bloom.
I thought Aberdeen was the most dangerous place I knew for
pedestrians. But the traffic of Oxford roars -- or crawls, depending on
the time of day -- with scant regard for human life; safe crossings
appeared to be scattered at intervals of several miles. I thought
Edinburgh had one of the worst begging problems in Britain, until I saw
the homeless of London -- but Oxford easily caps both; there are parts
of Oxford, thick with bag-ladies and dossers, that seem to have
harboured beggars since the Peasants' Revolt.
There are two communities in Oxford, and there is precious little love
lost between them. There are pubs where students dare not go. Even in
the academic hub of the city there are streets where you cannot walk
alone late at night. ''Since time Immemorial,'' writes James Erskine in
the Fresher's Guide 1994, ''there have been two warring factions in the
City of Oxford . . . Relationships between the university and townsfolk
are at best tolerable.''
There are little tribal details: townies' bus, gownies' bike. Oxford
is full of bikes -- and, I might add, it is full of wrecked bikes. You
cannot pass a rank on the railings without seeing at least one cycle
that some wretched yob has kicked and bent to junk. But there is nothing
new under the sun. On St Scholastica's Day in 1355, a student's
complaint about the wine at a local howff sparked a riot. Within days it
was a full-scale war, both sides taking to arms. ''The townies invaded
the city, yelling things like, 'Slea, Slea. Havock, havock. Smyt, fast.
Give gode knocks . . .' ''
Several lives were lost on this occasion, drawls Erskine, who has
learned Oxbridge understatement awfully well. But the villains were
punished. For the next 500 years townsfolk were compelled to attend an
annual penitential service. By the look of them, the beauties yet could
use it.
One can sympathise with the commoners of Oxford. (Having your tranquil
sleep repeatedly ruined by drunken upper-class hoodlums spilling out of
some function in perfect tuxedo does little to foster goodwill.) But it
is alien to a visiting Scot, used to Glasgow's ''homebody'' student
tradition, or the legendary tolerance of Marchmont matrons.
Beyond this, you still have to cope with the general, if muted, class
war underlying normal social life in England. Simply put, everyone who
helps you in town-Oxford crawls. Be they waitresses, shop assistants,
newsagents or whatever, they refuse to treat you as an equal. They are
either icily polite -- which I find irritating -- or downright
grovelling, which I find disturbing; either way, they make their dislike
very plain. It is a servile, divided, feudal world, and it is quite
beyond Scots comprehension.
There was once a day when enormous walls -- a good stretch still
survives by Magdalen College -- used to be built to keep them out. And,
even in 1995, even as a visiting Teuchter, within 24 hours of residence
in the University you are loath to step out among the Hun beyond.
Oxford, and Cambridge, are not universities as we understand them in
Scotland. They have unique admission procedures: you must apply
directly, not through the notorious UCCA system, and you cannot apply
simultaneously for both. Further, they are collegiate. You don't apply
to Oxford per se. You apply to one of its colleges -- Merton, Oriel, St
Hugh's. As your chances of admission to the sacred portals may be
heavily coloured by your choice -- each college has its own distinct
character, is more or less inclined to favour Scots or state-schooled
applicants, is more or less competitive in a particular academic field
-- this can make your choice of college a matter of much anxiety.
Classically, you entered Oxbridge by way of an interview, an entrance
examination, perhaps a conditional offer based on A-level results. (Both
universities hold our Highers, or Sixth Year Studies qualifications, in
mingled incomprehension and contempt.) The entrance exam is widely open
to abuse and was abolished by Cambridge some years ago; Oxford announced
its abolition last month. Not only, with its strong emphasis on written
fluency and a classical background, did it favour private schools, it
was also readily passed with the aid of a good ''crammer''. The demise
of the entrance exam threatens a lucrative business in tutoring monied
dunderheads for the hurdle.
The interview survives, and of this interview anecdotes are legion.
''At Oxbridge, certainly in the humanities, 'giving good interview' is
more than ever the conclusive indicator of brilliance . . . based as
much on confidence and wit as cleverness,'' writes Ellis, quoting
Camille Paglia's shrewd observation that ''the Anglo-Saxon world tends
to identify intelligence with verbal facility or aggressive wit''.
I have heard of one Oxford don who conducted all his interviews lying
on his back on the carpet -- no doubt eager to see how sixth-formers
would respond. I have heard of another who called candidates into his
room, only to bury his head in the Daily Telegraph and refuse to utter a
word. One feisty girl at length whipped out her Zippo and set the paper
on fire. She was accepted.
At university in Edinburgh, I went to lectures every day and tutorials
once or twice a week: this is true, I think, of arts courses around the
land. But not at Oxford. At Oxford, the ''alternative prospectus''
advises bluntly that lectures are a waste of time, given largely for
vainglory or to plug some academic's book. The prime teaching device is
the tutorial: you meet your tutor regularly, read him your prescribed
essay, sip brown sherry, and fight for your rights. Then he gives you
another essay assignment, and so on. This, for the right kind of
student, is the best teaching possible. But it is very expensive. It is
also why the university is very small; there are fewer than 10,000
students at Oxford.
The colleges of Oxford are built to foster loyalty, clubbability, and
tribal identification. They are characterised by quadrangles,
magnificent wrought-iron gates, mighty oak doors, panelled rooms, august
halls, rather ''high'' chapels, and all the glorious excess of English
architecture down the centuries. Each has its own charm. And each has
its own ridiculous English character.
Much of the public-school atmosphere that this engenders has been
diluted. Oriel, the last boys-only college, went co-ed a few years ago;
Somerville, the last exclusively female establishment -- it gave the
world Shirley Williams and Margaret Thatcher -- now has its first male
undergraduates. Nor do the protectors or ''bulldogs'' -- the strange,
servile, brutish, bowler-hatted servitors of advanced age and uncertain
temper -- enjoy the prefect-style police powers of a generation ago.
But certain features survive.
For one, there is eccentricity . There are bizarre twists of
nomenclature or pronunciation. Magdalen is not pronounced Magdalen, as
any normal human being would pronounce it; it's said exactly like
''maudlin'' -- way up there in hokum with Althorp, Beaulieu, and
Cholmondeley. No member of Christ Church calls it Christ Church for fear
of sounding non-U; you're supposed to call it ''the House''.
There are tortoises. Corpus Christi, where I dined one night, is
self-billed as the ''centre of the Oxford tortoise scene'', and is the
venue of the annual tortoise race. How can they stand the excitement?
Most colleges at Oxford have a tortoise mascot. The custom appears to
have survived the virtual ban on live tortoise imports to the United
Kingdom.
There is ''sub fusc''. Sub fusc is formal academic dress; at
Edinburgh, I had only to wear it the day I graduated, but in Oxford
there are innumerable occasions when its use is compulsory. It consists
of black suit, black socks, black shoes, white shirt, and white bow-tie,
with gown appropriate to your course and standing, and a mortar board
that you are never meant to wear, but merely to carry in your hand. Sub
fusc must be worn for matriculation, for all examinations, and for a
wide variety of seasons.
But -- abundantly -- there is sheer, shining beauty. Those buildings!
The Bodleian Library, with its glorious glass and panelling, and the
ancient ceiling of vaulted stone in the Divinity Hall, held by many as
the most beautiful room in Europe. Then there is the Sheldonian Theatre,
the Wren-conceived arena for formal Oxford occasions, with its glorious
baroque ceiling -- all the disciplines personified and painted, trompe
l'oeil fashion, as Truth descends upon the Arts and Sciences, and
''Envy, Rapine and Brutish Scoffing Ignorance'' are cast out behind the
organ-pipes.
There are tiny, ancient Norman churches. There are tracts of parkland:
the grounds of Magdalen College boast a thriving herd of deer. The Isis
and the Cherwell, mother-tributaries to the Thames itself, glide below
inclining trees as new daffodils and crocuses bob in fragility. Your
feet knock on cobbled stone, and you push open a door and find the
chapel. At Merton, an organist was in full flight, practising, and the
majestic notes floated high round the columns. At Christ Church --
sorry, ''The House'' -- a string quartet was immersed in Haydn.
Walls sprout comic gargoyles. Steeples, towers, and spires of every
description rise in the evening sky. Bells chime, ring, toll. Everywhere
is proportion, symmetry, loveliness. Everywhere the grass is green, the
stone is warm, and everywhere you are within ready reach of silence. You
can rise from your studies, go out, stand in the cloister by the edge of
the quad, and be transported into timeless serenity.
The food! I had meals beyond description -- wait you. The music!
Choral evensong, with the most famous choirs of the world, is free every
night; concertos, symphonies, glees, and madrigals are advertised around
the city.
You want books? I was in Blackwell's, one of the biggest bookshops in
the world, certainly the biggest I have ever seen; it takes up most of
Broad Street, and I found volumes -- cheap, too -- I had been seeking
for years, and left with groaning bags. You want a pub? Not one of your
ghastly Scottish drinking dens, all smoke and iniquity, but a real
English hostelry, of food and fellowship and hospitality? Well, I
lunched in the King's Arms, on splendid bread and cheese and noble
coffee, the sort of place where Izaak Walton and John Owen might have
dropped in after a hard night's fishing, to quaff goodly ale and argue
over the fine points of Hooker on episcopacy.
I had not been in Oxford a morning when I realised I had developed a
fixed, goofy, childlike smile in the midst of a truly overwhelming
aesthetic experience. All this is part of the magic. And it is powerful
magic.
I was in Oxford four days -- walking, touring, wining, dining,
mingling, talking, listening. After a day I asked my host about
post-graduate courses. After two days I wanted to know how to apply for
a post-graduate course. And after four days, when I found myself
considering membership in the Church of England, holding forth on the
merits of tawny port and nightly more adept in the tying of a bow-tie, I
realised I had to make good my escape before my goofy, childlike smile
was welded as if by plastic surgery.

Travellers may have rested at Inn Moine on their way across the moor,
but, believes Bruce Sandison, they had little reason to be thankful to
the man who built it, for he was also responsible for many callous
clearances in the Highlands
THIS is the story of Inn Moine, built by ''the mannie on the hill'';
unlamented George Granville Leveson-Gower, Marquis of Stafford and First
Duke of Sutherland (1785-1833). His monstrous statue stands on Beinn a'
Bhragaidh (1293ft) above the town of Golspie on the shores of the cold
North Sea. The duke stares seaward, his back turned forever on the
people he betrayed.
Leveson-Gower was one of the richest and most influential men in
Europe and he married Elizabeth Gordon, Countess of Sutherland
(1766-1839). From 1810 onward, through their agents, William Young,
Patrick Sellar, and James Loch, the pair set about ''improving'' their
vast landholdings in the far north of Scotland.
Their purpose was to clear the land of people to make way for sheep
and in the execution of this policy they were unconscionably ruthless,
demonstrating an almost complete disregard for those evicted. Little or
no provision was made for the destitute, and the perpetrators, supported
by local ministers, claimed that the clearances were in the people's
best interest.
News of what was happening gradually filtered south and James Loch
rushed to defend his master, publishing a ''full account'' of the
''improvements'' in 1820. This fuelled the fire of public concern,
expressed by a Staffordshire farmer, Thomas Bakewell, in a 145-page
rebuttal of Loch's whitewash job, and by General David Stewart of Garth,
who wrote: ''It is certain that there is no recent instance in which so
much unmerited suffering has produced so little compassion.''
Inn Moine was, in my opinion, built as an attempt to redress the
balance of public opinion. The tiny structure, measuring barely 24ft by
12ft, still stands by the lonely track between the Kyle of Tongue and
Loch Hope; a ruin now and bypassed by the realignment of the present
A838 Tongue/Durness road, but in its day it was an exemplary
public-relations stunt.
The duke financed the construction of a road over the Moine and the
inn was erected for travellers crossing the moor. Ironically, the inn's
only guests now are sheep, but a fading plaque on the east gable,
written by loquacious Loch, reminds us that the inn and road were made
at the sole expense of his illustrious master, and for purely altruistic
motives.
Inn Moine looks south towards Ben Hope (3040ft), Scotland's most
northerly Munro, and the crenellated towers of Ben Loyal (2504ft),
''Queen of Scottish Mountains''. To the north lies the modest, gently
rounded summit of Ben Hutig (1339ft) and this little hill offers a
splendid viewpoint of the surrounding countryside and an invigorating
moorland tramp.
Start the day by the bridge of Strath Melness Burn at Lubinvullin,
close to the white sands of Strathan beach. A good track leads
north-west up the hill from the road reaching Loch na h-Uamhachd after
approximately one mile. From there the going gets rough and should not
be underestimated. Find the best route you can among the broken peat
hags and heather banks.
Follow the inlet stream of the loch to little Loch nan Clach Geala,
then trudge up to the triangulation pillar on the top of Ben Hutig.
Leave the hill by descending the long, south-east ridge. After a stiff
walk of one-and-a-half miles you should pick up the line of an excellent
peat road which leads easily back to West Strathan and the start point
of Lubinvullin.
Choose a fine day for this expedition because its real joy lies in the
mountain and moorland panorama along the way, and the outstanding array
of wildlife: golden plover, curlew, greenshank, dunlin, red-throated
diver, buzzard; sphagnum moss, tormentil, butterwort, sundew, bog
asphodel, bog myrtle, spotted orchid. Spare a thought also for the
people who used to live and work here, and for their sad fate.
End your journey with a visit to a more robust, thriving inn, The
Craggan at Melness, one of Scotland's best-kept secrets. The Craggan is
perfectly situated on a hill overlooking Tongue Bay and Rabbit Islands
and offers good food, good company, and a relaxed welcome. Gaelic is the
preferred language and don't mention ''the mannie on the hill''. In
these airts, to this day, he is still very much persona non grata.

Forget the codes, a lesson in cheesespeak is the only way to take the
chance out of choosing a Cheddar, discovers Catherine Brown
SEARCHING out the Cheddar with ''bite'', the gamble is between six at
the supermarket deli counter. All claim they are mature. Some are also
traditional or farmhouse, while others have a local tag or are named
after the cheesemaker. For supermarket deli counter read betting shop.
Should I risk the one at a snip (#1.99 lb), or go for the top price
(#3.25 lb)? They both say ''mature''. So what's the difference? Does the
assistant behind the counter know? No, they're just different, she says.
And there is no offer of a trial taste run.
Britain's most popular cheese, once simply a choice of ''red'' or
''white'', has moved into the speciality cheese cabinet and become
high-risk. The only way to suss out the best bets is to study the form
-- if possible buy small samples and do your own tasting. The choice at
Sainsbury's is between one Scottish and five English.
The ''bite'' and long-lasting flavour which you would expect in a
mature Cheddar was missing from three, including the most expensive. The
cheapest, with a more rounded flavour, was much better value. Two were
rich and buttery, with a West Country creaminess, interesting
well-balanced cheeses, but sweet rather than strongly tangy. To my mind
the only one with any real Cheddar ''bite'' was Scottish.
Another six samples (pre-packs which I bought at the same time) not
only claimed maturity but also a cheese strength number. This idea was
first introduced by Safeway, then taken up by Tesco about a year ago,
and last month introduced by Sainsbury. The number aims to indicate the
strength of flavour in a Cheddar corresponding to its maturity, starting
with 1 for mild and going up to 5 (Sainsbury and Safeway) and 7 (Tesco).
Traditional English farmhouse Cheddar, at flavour strength 5 (very
strong), had a mild tang and a well-balanced, rounded flavour. The other
strength 5 was Canadian and the tang was sharper, the flavour less
rounded. Sainsbury's own brand, described as strength 4 (strong), lacked
the tang factor entirely and had a lactic smell and aftertaste of
sourish milk. Of the pre-packs, it was also the cheapest (#2.29 lb).
In contrast, Sainsbury's own-brand Scottish Matured Cheddar at
strength 4 (#2.59 lb) was a much more lively cheese with a mild tang and
a rounded flavour.
Not all cheese experts go along with the idea of labelling cheese for
strength. ''It may be a strong flavour,'' says Robin Gilmore, director
of McLelland's Cheese Market in Glasgow, ''but what we look for in a
mature Cheddar is not strength of flavour but a 'clean' maturity.
Strength is only one aspect, and it can be misleading.''
''Cleanness'' -- in cheesespeak -- is the level of acidity balanced
against other flavours. In a well-matured Cheddar, acidity should not be
too dominant. But at the same time there should be enough to provide a
refreshing tingle in the mouth.
A badly matured cheese will have a dull, muddy flavour or a sharpness
at the first taste with no follow-through.
Gilmore manages cheese-maturing in a large
temperature-and-humidity-controlled cheese store which markets a
brand-named Cheddar with a consistent flavour. He begins by grading
Cheddar by age: mild (6 months old), medium (8 months), and mature (12
months plus).
Like whisky tasters who judge the development of flavour throughout
the period of its maturing, he must keep his palate tuned constantly to
the way flavours are developing. He sells off, as mild or medium, those
which he judges will not mature successfully, storing the more
characterful cheeses in the hope that they will develop depth and body.
Tom Langdon-Davis, who makes Quicke's Traditional Farmhouse Cheddar on
a farm in Devon, agrees with Gilmore about the dangers of believing that
strength of flavour will tell you everything you need to know.
''It's a crude flavour level,'' he says, ''which may be fine as a
first step, but it says nothing about the length, balance, and
individual characteristics of the cheese.''
Quicke produces Cheddar with its own milk from a herd of 300 cows. Not
all farmhouse-labelled cheese, by the way, is necessarily made from
own-farm milk and no legislation exists to prevent large-scale factory
creameries, sited on farms, producing plastic-wrapped block Cheddar and
naming it ''farmhouse''.
At Quicke's, however, all cheeses are made in the traditional round
shape, wrapped in cloth rather than plastic, since the company believes
it is important to allow the cheese to ''breathe'' while it matures. It
aims, like Mclelland's, to sell a mature Cheddar with a consistent
flavour, thus lowering the odds.
Specialist food shops, self-confident in their limited choice of one
or two ''mature'' cheddars, also lower the odds. Of the supermarkets,
only Tesco helps with more information than the strength numbers.
''We have taken up the idea of wine-tasting notes for cheese,'' says
Sheila Gregory, Tesco cheese buyer, ''giving a few descriptive details
which indicate that there is more to it than just strength of flavour.
We want customers to experiment more with Cheddars because there's such
a wide range now, so they must have more information to understand the
types of flavours, textures, and aromas.''
In addition to the tasting notes on each cheese label there is a
leaflet which explains the ''cheesespeak''. Learn the lingo, and picking
a winner becomes a less risky business.
Catherine Brown is this year's winner of the Glenfiddich Award for the
best regional food writing in Britain.
Seasonwatch
MARKING the ''first of'' a new spring crop of Jersey Royal potatoes,
growers took April 26 as the official opening of ''the season''. Prices
for these high-premium potatoes are likely to hit #2 per lb which makes
them, like most ''first of'' foods, an expensive luxury. Less pricye,
however, are the ''first of'' the Scottish tomatoes from the Clyde
Valley at around 99p per lb. Look out also for new Scottish leeks, and a
new crop of Swiss chard, grown under glass by Scottish growers.
Partans, black velvet crabs, and scallops are the best shellfish to go
for. Plentiful are the small princess scallops farmed off the west
coast. Brill from the Solway is good quality, while grey witch sole and
lemon sole are a better buy than plaice that is spawning.

Liz Taylor looks at some of Scotland's splendid collections of
'commercial' art
WHEN Bob Cratchit worked in Ebeneezer Scrooge's counting house he
would have been astonished if his employer, even when he became most
benevolent, had decorated the walls with pictures. Today, however,
office workers are often surrounded by splendid works of art, and their
employers reckon that better work is done in well-decorated
environments.
Companies, both large and small, often delegate a senior staff member
to the enjoyable task of buying pictures. Not only is the ambience
improved but, with any luck, the art collections also prove to be
valuable and appreciating assets for the shareholders.
One of the best collections of art-in-the-office in the United Kingdom
belongs to the merchant bank, Robert Fleming, in the City of London.
Visitors to its glass-walled building are stunned by the riot of colour
revealed as they ride up in a glass-sided lift through floor after floor
lined with spectacular paintings, many of them by Scottish artists --
for Fleming is proud of its north of the Border origins.
In Scotland, many businesses, large and small, also adopt the
art-in-the-office policy on varying scales. Murray Johnstone, the
finance house in West Nile Street, Glasgow, has a particularly good
collection of paintings built up over several years by previous chairman
Sir Raymond Johnstone -- whose portrait, by John Byrne, hangs in one of
the upper halls -- his successor, Nicolas McAndrew, and an ex-company
director, Ross Peters. The present chairman is Giles Weaver.
Murray Johnstone's entrance hall is dominated by its most recent
acquisition, a large painting by Alexander Goudie called Villa Rose,
showing a beachside house in the South of France, which was bought this
year. Adjacent to it is an older and contrasting picture by Ernest Hood
of the firm's former premises in Hope Street, showing crowded pavements
and Glasgow buses in a drizzly atmosphere.
Murray Johnstone owns almost 50 pictures, which are displayed in
spacious, well-lit offices with magnificent yew-veneered doors and
woodwork. A few of the works were acquired before 1986, but the majority
have been bought since then and the policy of selective acquisition is
still going on. Large sums of money have not been spent in building up
the collection, but today it must be worth a considerable sum as the
selection has been made with care and discrimination. Preference is
given to Scottish artists, and most of the best-known names are on
display.
Among the pre-1986 pictures is a collection of six studies from 1931
of women in court dress by Sir John Lavery. The Hope Street picture is
also an early purchase, as is a still life by David Martin, a harvest
field by John Halliday, and an atmospheric study, After the Storm, by
William McTaggart.
It is a surprise to walk along the office corridors and realise that
the walls are lined by a still life by Lesley Hunter and a study of
tulips, a black scarf, and a fan by F C B Cadell. Not far from them is a
view of Royan by S J Peploe, flowers in a yellow vase by Anne Redpath,
and Poppies by Sir Robin Philipson.
One of the upstairs halls is dominated by a large canvas, Girl with
Spilt Wine by R Scott Duff, and nearby hangs Govan Ferry by Donald Bain,
Chivalry by Louise Annand, and Sunrise over a Lake by John Houston. The
office art tour continues through individual rooms where can be found a
Joan Eardley of a little Glasgow boy, and another by her of her studio
at Townhead. They make a strong contrast with Plants by the Pool by Una
Shanks and Peter Howson's Wee Willie Winkie, the least favourite among
the people working at Murray Johnstone's and so has been relegated to a
conference room.
Every now and then paintings are switched around to give the workforce
something different to look at and, of course, people have their
individual likes and dislikes, but the consensus is that being
surrounded by such individual works of art is stimulating and very
pleasant.
Another Scottish company that has bought, and continues to buy,
paintings is John Menzies, which maintains a good collection in its
offices overlooking Edinburgh's Princes Street. F Noel-Paton, group
managing director, is the person doing the current buying and in recent
months he has been able to add a Gemmel Hutchison, a Joseph Milne, and a
Shona Barr to the collection, which also boasts a strong Scottish
painter theme although he does not deliberately set out to buy from
local artists.
''I think the notion of specialising in Scottish art is a strange
one,'' he said. ''After all, a good work is a good work, but as a
Scottish company, and because of the tremendous surge of creativity and
skill in Scotland, one is inevitably drawn to that.''
Menzies' collection is strong on paintings of Edinburgh and the
Scottish landscape, and also boasts works by Anne Redpath, Joan Eardley,
Archie Soutar, Alexander Goudie, David Rose, Sheila Macmillan, and Joan
Renton.
A more modest art collection is on display in the Atholl Crescent
offices of Edinburgh lawyers Brodies. It was started because of a family
connection between one of the partners, Jim Henderson, and the painter
Chris J Fergusson, who was his grandmother.
She was a contemporary and friend of the Scottish Colourists -- though
not to be confused with J D Fergusson, who was not a relative -- and she
helped Jessie M King, E A Taylor, and E A Hornel to found the Dumfries
and Galloway Fine Arts Society in the 1920s. In her own right she was a
very skilled artist, specialising in striking landscapes, and her
grandson brought several of her canvases into the office and displayed
them on the boardroom walls, where they were much admired.
Henderson, who held the position of secretary of the Society of
Scottish Artists until 1983, then started buying more paintings to
display and also took part in the Scottish Arts Council's scheme of
lending works of art to offices. Today, Brodies owns about 45 pictures
and also displays 20 more from the Arts Council. Henderson doubts if he
has spent more than #4000 on the collection.
There were already some pictures in the office, mainly old portraits
of people associated with the long-established firm, which was started
by Ludovic Brodie, grandfather of the notorious Deacon. Two of them are
of women, Helen and Margaret Brodie, Ludovic's daughters, and another is
an engraving by Faed of Sir Thomas Dawson Brodie of Gairloch, a partner
in the firm, who died in 1896.
More recent acquisitions include pictures by Molly Bullick, Ivan
Polley, a screenprint of Glencoe by Tom McKenzie, a Penelope Beaton
still-life, Edward Gage, and a sunset by Ken Fleming. The most
expensive, bought by Henderson, was by Marysia Donaldson and cost #1200.
On display at the end of a corridor is a view of a seashore by J H
Bruce-Lockhart, the grandfather of Karen Bruce-Lockhart, another partner
in Brodies. He has lent it to the office, so the family connection is
maintained there as well.
''It is a surprise to walk along the office corridors and realise that
the walls are lined by studies by Cadell.''

Greedy tourist firms are
being accused of ruining
some of the world's
naturalbeauty spots and
destroying local culture,
as Kirsty Scottdiscovers
THE increasingly devastating impact of tourism on the environment is
explored in a new book, Preserve or Destroy by Jonathan Croall, which
argues that the tourist trade has turned beauty spots into honeypots,
ruined precious landscapes, polluted coasts and countryside, and
destroyed communities and their culture.
Croall says the mushrooming demand for tourist facilities across the
globe has been exploited by greedy, unscrupulous, or unthinking
governments, developers, and tour operators and has led in many places
to massively inappropriate development. He names the Mediterranean, the
Alps, the Lake District, and the mountains of Nepal as regions that have
reached crisis point.
With tourism the world's fastest growing industry, he says efforts
must be made to promote a different type that recognises the fragility
of the environment and the need to sustain local cultures. Croall says
he has been encouraged by the growing realisation that tourism is
hurting the environment and cannot remain unchecked. He argues that a
major shift in thinking is required by tour operators if real headway is
to be made.
''This is highly problematic,'' he says, ''since most companies are
driven entirely by commercial considerations . . . yet if the operators
continue to consider their own interests alone, they're likely to end up
destroying the very places on which their industry depends.'' Croall
also says that as individual tourists we need to face the fact that we
will be asked to pay for places previously free to visit.
''As tourists, we will also be increasingly asked to contribute to the
cost of protecting and maintaining those precious places that hungry
generations are relentlessly treading down. This seems a small price to
pay to preserve them for our children and for future generations.''
* THE pit-stop hotels springing up at the edge of major roads continue
to make their mark on the accommodation scene. What they may lack in
aesthetics they make up for in accessibility and affordability,
providing a comfortable bed for the weary traveller for as little as #17
per night. They are also ideal low-cost stopovers for special occasions
such as weddings, birthday parties, or simply a budget weekend away. If
your stay is unexpected, many supply toiletry packs, hair dryers, irons,
and ironing boards.
Travel Inns have 68 hotels around Britain, from Aberdeen to Exeter,
most with family rooms with a double bed and sofa bed -- designed to
sleep two adults and two children up to age 16 -- and a cot. Rooms cost
#34.50 per night and no extras unless you want them. Specially adapted
rooms for disabled travellers are available, as are no-smoking rooms.
Campanile, better known on the Continent, has 15 hotels in the UK, all
run by husband-and-wife teams. Rooms sleep at least three, with en suite
bathroom, phone, drinks facilities, and satellite TV. Each hotel has a
French-style bistro. The newest, the Dartford Campanile, has its own
lake and landscaped grounds. The weekend rate is #29.95, weekday #33.75.
Pavilion Lodges have seven sites with rooms offering en suite
bathroom, hospitality tray, trouser presses, hair dryer, and satellite
TV. Twin, double, triple, family, disabled, and non-smoking rooms are
available. Continental breakfasts (#3.95) can be delivered to rooms.
Dining facilities are shared with motorway service areas. Prices are
#34.95 for one person, #38.95 for two adults and up to two children
under 18.
* THE English Tourist Board has a new man-in-the-moon logo to tell
travellers which facilities to expect at the various lodges. The more
blue and white moons, the better the facilities, up to a maximum of
three. The grades indicate the quality -- approved, commended, highly
commended, or de luxe.
* MAINTENANCE crews are continuing to work on the leaning Tower of
Pisa. Workmen are using liquid nitrogen to freeze the ground around the
tower as they try to install cables designed to pull the structure just
a fraction more upright. Hundreds of people watched columns of white
vapour from the super-cold material rise from holes around the 180-foot
tower.
* MOROCCO, which is beefing up its tourism trade in all sectors, is
now billing itself as an alternative destination for climbers. The Atlas
Mountains offer some challenging peaks, including the 11,000ft Jebel
Siroua. Explore Worldwide recently led a week-long expedition to the top
of the mountain which cost #390 for flights, meals, local guides, and a
tour leader.
Explore is also running a new cultural tour to the old Silk Road,
which follows in the footsteps of ancient traders across Uzbekistan,
from Khiva to the Tien Shan Mountains. The trip takes in Samarkand and
the Kalyan Minaret in Bokhara, once the world's tallest building.
Leaving on June 23. More information from 01252 319448.
* THE gondoliers of Venice should be a little more knowledgeable in
future. All new trainees now have to attend school and take exams
showing a knowledge of at least two foreign languages, the history and
traditions of Venice, and the geography of the canals. Citalia is
offering Venice city breaks to commemorate 100 years of the Biennale
Festival, which covers art, music, and architecture and runs from May to
October. Details on 0181 686 5533.
* FOR those who can't bear to be parted from their pet on holiday,
Headwater Holidays is offering dog-walking breaks in Killarney,
south-west Ireland. Dogs can stay free in the accommodation, but there
is a #15 kennel fee each way on the ferry. Details on 01606 48699.
* LOUDON Castle Park, near Kilmarnock, was opened at the end of last
month as a major theme park and tourist attraction for the west coast.
Loudon, which has historical associations as far back as William
Wallace, has played a major role in Scottish history, but a disastrous
fire in 1941 and financial pressures had taken their toll.
The new facility, covering 500 acres, includes a walled garden
amusement centre with Britain's biggest carousel, woodland walks, a
playground and pets' corner, restaurant, shop, and museum. The centre
was officially opened yesterday by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.

Margaret Hughes
is a loser in the
name game but
a winner in the
eating stakes
Round Table restaurant
RESTAURANT names intrigue me. Do owners want to convey a message about
the food served? Or the atmosphere that the name creates? Do they choose
the name of their first-born? Or is it just a case of something that
sounds good and, more importantly, will stick in the customer's memory?
Scotland has no shortage of restaurants with interesting names, some
more simple than others. For instance, Glasgow's Stravaigin has a
memorable name because it sounds unusual, and is easy to get wrong.
Malmaison is an attempt at rekindling memories of fine dining in the
good old days, while the city's new restaurant, Yes, is surely a
positive statement for the nineties.
The Round Table in Edinburgh suggested several things to me. First,
that the dominant theme of the surroundings would be linked to the tales
of Arthurian legend. Second, that there would be a lot of round tables.
I was wrong on the first assumption, but there were probably enough
round tables to justify the name.
I scanned the walls and curios that littered the premises in some
attempt to find even the most subtle hint that the restaurant was named
after the legendary ''round table''. I did not even come up with the
slightest glimpse of a knight in shining armour or the mighty Excalibur.
And the small round tables were lucky to seat two, never mind a knight
in full military regalia.
The tables, however, were attractive. Made from chunky wood, they
would probably have looked quite at home in the large dining-hall at
Camelot. The chairs were very comfortable, and the pews positioned
around the larger tables looked equally enjoyable. Wood is a wonderfully
tactile medium, and the tables offered such smoothness and aesthetic
pleasure that it seemed a pity to cover them with mats.
The menu comprises traditional Scottish dishes and includes haggis,
venison, mussels, salmon, beef, and a couple of vegetarian options. To
start, I chose haggis in a whisky sauce. It was a huge portion -- I
would have been happy to have it served as a main course. The haggis
came with a sizable dollop of mashed potatoes and turnips. The potatoes
were light and creamy, but, like the turnip, a little bit of seasoning
would have improved them.
There are so many bad examples of our so-called ''national dish'' that
it is encouraging when you happen upon a good one. This was a fine
specimen of spiciness and meatiness. The sauce was lightly flavoured
with whisky and tasted superb when mopped up with hunks of brown bread.
My companion chose a salad to start, and was served a huge bowl topped
with croutons. The salad was made up of lettuce leaves, carrots, onions,
bean sprouts, cucumber, all topped with a smooth vinaigrette dressing.
It was declared very good.
For my main course, I chose the delightfully named Auld Reekie's Fowl,
chicken and wild mushrooms in a creamy malt whisky sauce, served with
carrot-garnished rice. The chicken was tender and juicy, but the sauce
was the highlight of the course. The flavour of the malt whisky was very
apparent, and although made with cream, the sauce was not too stodgy.
The rice was served garnished with carrots and red onions, which gave
the whole dish a sharpness and sweetness.
Vegetables came on a sideplate: a typical selection of potatoes,
broccoli, carrots, and swede -- although the small serving of spinach
did make a pleasant change. My companion's choice was a simple tomato
and pesto sauce served with spaghetti. A sizable portion, ''very fresh,
as good as anything I've eaten in either a vegetarian or Italian
restaurant''.
As is often the case in small restaurants, dessert was made a few
home-made specialities and a selection of mass-produced ones. I chose
the fresh strawberry ice-cream meringue, an amalgam of both.
The strawberries were fresh, and there were lots of them: highly
enjoyable. The strawberry coulis was vibrant in colour, slightly tart to
taste, but a welcome accompaniment to the disappointing meringue, which
was too sweet and too hard. The vanilla ice-cream lacked flavour.
Indeed, I would have been just as happy to have been served the
strawberries on their own. It is often only when something comses in its
simplest form that it is most enjoyable. As far as I am concerned,
nature did a wonderful job on strawberries and there is no need to tart
them up.
Diners at another table had chosen bananas served in crepes and
covered in bubbling hot butterscotch sauce -- this looked and smelled
delicious. Judging by the relish with which they ate it, I wished I had
followed their lead.
Dessert was followed by a cappuccino, which has to be the worst I have
ever tasted. It resembled a very bad mug of instant hot chocolate;
indeed, I would guess that it was simply a very bad mug of instant
cappuccino. Definitely to be avoided at all costs, unless of course you
ensure that you are being served ''real'' cappuccino.
The thing that will stick most in my memory about the Round Table,
besides the name, is the huge portions. After my starter I would have
happily gone straight to the sweet. I was glad I did not, because then I
would have missed out on what was probably the most enjoyable of the
three courses.
Another attraction of the Round Table is its location, directly across
from the Scottish Office and Calton Hill. On a fine spring evening it is
most pleasing to watch the changing sky and the setting sun's patterns
on the buildings of St Andrew's House.
Service was friendly and brisk. The waiter was happy to spend time
explaining what the dishes were made of, and offering suggestions on
choice. The restaurant has both a la carte and a fixed-price, two-course
menu. Often when a choice is given, restaurants are reluctant to allow
you to chop and change. However, this did not appear to be a problem
with the Round Table.
* The Round Table restaurant 31 Jeffrey Street, Edinburgh. Tel: 0131
557 3032. Open for lunch, Monday to Saturday, 12 noon until 5.30. A
two-course lunch menu is available at #4.95. The restaurant is open for
dinner Monday-Saturday from 6 until 10. There is a fixed-price menu at
#11.50. A three-course meal chosen from the a la carte costs around #15,
including coffee.
RECOMMENDED RESTAURANT
Le Marche Noir, 2/4 Eyre Place, Edinburgh. Tel: 0131 558 1608.
YET another restaurant to marry good Scottish produce with the
culinary traditions of France.
Recent highlights have included pork served in a Cointreau and orange
sauce: simply wonderful. Desserts are most definitely French in flavour
-- the apple and almond tart is worth a try.
* Le Marche Noir is open for lunch from Monday to Friday, 12 until
2.30, and for dinner from 7 to 9.30. Lunch is not served on Saturday or
Sunday. Dinner on Saturday from 7 until 10, on Sunday 7-9.

They come in all shapes and sizes but Lady Claire Macdonald doesn't
care how her aubergines look, she loves them anyway
WHEN I first came to live permanently in Skye, 23 years ago, it was
pretty well impossible to buy fresh fruit and vegetables with the
exceptions of potatoes, carrots, onions, and turnip, and apples,
oranges, and bananas. In the then shop in the village of Ardvasar, on
the southernmost peninsula of Skye, you couldn't buy a tomato in a tin,
never mind fresh. Now, I feel amazed at the complete turn-around in
supplies here, and when I write recipes I always reckon that what I can
get in Skye must be available to anyone wherever they live in Scotland.
Never mind fresh tomatoes, we can now find not only green peppers for
sale, but yellow and red ones, too. Not only peppers, but also
aubergines. Aubergines are most often thought of in association with
Southern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. I must declare my
hand here and say how much I love aubergines, in whatever way they are
cooked.
There are two types -- the fatter, rounder-shaped ones and the longer,
thinner type. The rounder ones are the ones sought out for use in
moussakas, apparently -- I am so grateful to find them at all, I'm not
fussy about their shape myself.
They are regarded in the Middle East as a recognised antidote to wind
-- and that is what their name means in one of the Middle Eastern
languages.
There is something so visually appealing about their colour, of a
shade of rich purple that I long to find accurately reproduced in silk
or velvet. They do have a dark green top which can be prickly and
therefore you need to be a bit wary when handling them.
There are two slight drawbacks to aubergines -- one is that they need
to be cut, sliced or chopped half an hour before you cook them. Sprinkle
them with a little salt, and as they sit you will see beads of dark
moisture appear. After 30 minutes or so pat them dry with absorbent
kitchen paper -- to absorb this bitter juice.
Their other problem is that when you see a recipe which calls for them
to be fried you end up using at least a bottle of oil in the cooking.
They absorb oil like blotting paper. This can render a dish containing
aubergines very rich indeed. But I've discovered a way around this.
Once you have patted dry the sliced or chopped aubergines, mix them
well with two or three tablespoonsful of oil -- I use olive-oil when I
am cooking aubergines -- and put them on an oiled roasting tin. Roast
them, spread thinly on the baking tray, and turn them from time to time
as they cook. This way you use a fraction of the oil in cooking.
When I serve them as a vegetable to ourselves, the family, as opposed
to the hotel guests, I just slice each aubergine in half lengthways and
sprinkle each half with salt. After its sitting time I pat it dry, stick
a knife into the flesh at intervals, and push slivers of garlic in -- no
need to do this if you don't like garlic -- and brush each
garlic-studded half with olive-oil. Bake in a fairly hot oven, about
400[DEG]F, gas mark 6, 200[DEG]C for about 20-25 minutes, or until the
largest half the flesh feels quite soft when pricked with a fork.
If you slice the aubergines and brush the slices with olive-oil then
barbecue or chargill them, then marinade the grilled slices in olive-oil
and chopped fresh herbs (and chopped garlic, if you like), well seasoned
with salt and freshly ground black pepper, it makes a most sumptuous
first course or vegetable accompaniment.
The recipe today is for aubergine stuffed red peppers. The original
idea for this recipe was that of Anna del Conte, the wonderful Italian
food writer, whose recipes make me drool just to read them. These
aubergine stuffed peppers need to sit for 10-15 minutes once cooked --
somehow the flavours of the filling combine and settle down together so
much better than serving them immediately. They can be served warm, or
cold.
If you serve them cold, trickle a small amount of extra-virgin
olive-oil over them as they cool. They make a perfect accompaniment to a
main course, and as they are fairly filling I never think there is need
for anything else to go with cold roast lamb, beef, or chicken.
AUBERGINE STUFFED RED PEPPERS
6 firm large red peppers (or yellow and red peppers)
8 tablespoons good olive-oil
4 slices baked white bread, crusts removed
1 large juicy clove of garlic, skinned and finely chopped
4 anchovy fillets
4 teaspoons capers
2 good handfuls of parsley, chopped
about 18 good quality black olives, stoned and chopped
freshly ground black pepper
2 large aubergines, diced into [1/2]cm cubes
DICE the aubergines and leave them, sprinkled with salt, to ooze their
indigestible juices, for about half an hour. Then rinse them, and pat
dry with kitchen paper. Brush a baking tray with olive-oil and toss the
aubergines in olive-oil on the baking tray. Roast them, turning them
from time to time with a fish slice. Roast until they are soft -- they
will shrink quite considerably as they roast.
Grill the peppers evenly until they form great black blisters on their
skin, then leave them in a large poly bag for 10 minutes. Cut each in
half, remove the seeds and core, and peel off the skins. Oil a large
ovenproof dish and put the pepper halves into this. Brush each crustless
slice of bread on both sides with olive-oil. Then cut the slices into
fine cubes and roast them on a baking tray. Shake and turn them with a
fish slice so that they brown evenly. When browned, mix together the
croutons, garlic, parsley, chopped capers, and chopped anchovies and
season with pepper. Mix in the chopped olives and spoon into each pepper
half. Cook in a hot oven, 200 C, gas mark 6, 400 F for about 15 minutes.
Keep them warm until you are ready to serve -- they improve with
''sitting''.

WITH Michael Heseltine's gloomy warning that German companies are
beating their British rivals in too many of our top export markets
ringing in my ears, I went this week to talk to the chairman of a German
family-owned company with plants in Scotland supplying the
semi-conductor industry.
Before meeting Dr Jurgen Heraeus, I read what he calls his editorial
in the accounts of the main group company, Heraeus Holding GmbH. Under
the headline Germany: Industrial Nation without Industries? he noted it
was 10 years since German economic experts had had a vision -- to leave
mundane jobs to workers in other countries.
That vision, he went on, was bowing to the obvious in conceding that
things like cameras, watches, ships and textiles could be produced at
much lower cost elsewhere. But it contained a comfort factor, a
widespread belief that the rest of the world would not find replacements
for German ingenuity and perfection, where these still commanded a
premium in the marketplace.
If Germany was not to make the things which could now be made more
cheaply elsewhere, the vision dictated that it would become a country of
intellectual workers, supplying the world with ideas and services.
''However, the concept failed,'' Dr Heraeus writes. Not every German
was up to intellectual work. The world did not want all the ideas or
services offered. ''It was destined to fail. . . When simple tasks are
left to workers in other countries, the base for employment will be
taken away. . . The visionaries ignored one major element in their
decision making process: surprisingly it is sometimes the rather simple
task that will lead to an increase in value. This fact, and not just low
production costs, is one of the secrets behind the success of Asian
countries.''
Dr Heraeus goes on to warn that Germany must get back to the mundane
task of producing simple, useful and affordable products. He cautions
that sky-high wages negotiated during the period of flight from making
things others could make more cheaply must be reduced. He chides his
country's politicians for maintaining the belief that welfare can be
held at previous levels.
''In the tough years ahead, Germany does not need a confusing tax
jungle that rewards innovations in the area of tax reduction more than
innovations in the area of product development. . . No-one wants to
return to child labour, but many provisions of the work protection law
are aimed directly against those it is supposed to protect. . Only the
concerted effort of all forces will help Germany to become an industrial
nation that is creating values once again.''
Some of these words, written in 1993, could readily be transposed to
the lips of senior British industrialists. But the sentiments which seem
to me to diverge from the current consensus are those focussing on what
industrial future, if any, mature manufacturing economies such as
Germany (and Britain) can expect.
To explore that, it is worth considering the historical evolution of
the group Dr Heraeus now chairs. It was founded in 1851 in Hanau, a town
east of Frankfurt, a centre of the country's jewellery industry. Chemist
and pharmacist Wilhelm Carl Heraeus created the first German platinum
melting house.
It has maintained that involvement in precious metal technology to the
present day, working in gold, silver and platinum as well as other
exotics such as palladium and rhodium. But to work precious metals
required high temperatures and heat resistant crucibles. That took it
into oven technology and the varied applications to which quartz glass
could be put. Each step, process by process, has taken the burgeoning
group into a widening range of sectors from dental technology to tanning
lamps, fibre optics to thermocouples.
Dr Heraeus bristles slightly at the suggestion the group is a major
player in a series of niche markets. ''We don't want to be in a niche.
That's where you are in a corner and can't move. We want to be a big
worldwide business.''
Indeed, Heraeus's involvement, since the 1890s, with quartz glass is
what brought it to East Kilbride in 1977. And that is a good example of
how a family-owned company -- albeit one with 9500 employees, sales of
DM5700m (#2530m) in 1994 and after-tax profits of DM71m (#31.5m) in the
same year -- can take on American multi-national rival GE in an emerging
technology and come off best.
In wafer fabrication plants in the semi-conductor industry part of the
processing involves new wafers being cured in ovens at temperatures
around 800[DEG]C. Quartz glass is the preferred material for the
carriers, the tubes and so-called boats which, like glass CD racks, are
used to both stack the wafers in the oven and protect them from
contamination.
When semi-conductor technology came on the scene in the sixties,
Heraeus could have limited its involvement to supplying the raw tubes
from which such carriers are fashioned. That is what GE did in the US.
But it decided to move into the emerging technology and not only supply
the glass, but also manufacture and repair the carriers and other
specialised glassware.
That is what the East Kilbride plant -- which this week celebrated its
fourth expansion into a 2700 sq m facility, minutes away from the
Motorola semi-conductor operation -- and a small satellite operation in
Greenock were designed to do.
''Today, we have five shops in the United States, seven in Europe,
five in Japan and one each in Taiwan, Korea and mainland China,'' says
Dr Heraeus. ''GE decided to stay as a raw material supplier. Only the
Japanese went down the route we did. So today, in the US, only ourselves
and the Japanese offer the full quartz glass service. And in Japan we
have our joint venture with Shin-Etsu, the world leader in the field.''
The new East Kilbride facility represents a #2m investment and takes
the workforce to 50, from just two when Heraeus arrived 18 years ago.
One of them was Hans Baumbach, who is still in Scotland, as the man in
charge of manufacturing. The sophisticated carriers -- priced at up to
#17,000 a piece -- East Kilbride is now making involve welding, cutting
and grinding a glass which is notoriously difficult to work.
So how did Mr Baumbach find the necessary skills? ''I went to the
local engineering training centre, got some young apprentices and
trained the first batch myself. Then, eventually they took over and
trained others. But it was hard work and there's always a shortage of
these skills,'' he says.
''It is a bottleneck in developing this side of our business,'' admits
Dr Heraeus. ''We have Russians and Chinese working in our shops in the
US. We have Germans in Japan and Japanese in the US.''
''This technology has developed enormously in the past ten years,''
adds Heinrich Ollendiek, since 1991 general manager at East Kilbride.
''We've moved on from glass blowing to glass engineering, so
increasingly we take on people with a metalwork background and retrain
them.''
He believes the way Heraeus Silica &amp; Metals, as the UK company is
known, does business with UK-based semi-conductor subsidiaries of
Japanese and American multi-nationals is very different from the way
that business is done, say, in the US.
Everywhere there is a demand for quick response, particularly to
repair work on existing carriers which dictates a local presence, near
the chip plants. But Mr Ollendiek contends there is more of a sense of
loyalty and partnership between supplier and customer here than persists
across the Atlantic.
However, Dr Heraeus warns: ''If you are not competitive, that sense of
partnership soon goes.'' The business, he continues, involves constant
juggling of wage costs and productivity levels against the fluid demands
of mobile customers.
''Hourly wages here in Scotland are probably half what we have to pay
glass blowers in Germany, but productivity here is not as high. In the
US we achieve very high productivity, but, thanks to the strong mark
against the dollar, wage costs are only 60% of those in Germany. In
Korea, wage costs are even lower, but productivity is not so good. But,
in our bonding wire business there, productivity is now as high as in
Germany. In Europe we have to keep up with productivity elsewhere or
there is no future.''
That's a pretty stark warning. But the even bigger lesson for CBI
Scotland, the political parties and everyone else in Britain wrestling
with the future role and shape of our competitive industrial base is his
contention that we can't just seek small niches or depend on our
collective brainpower to survive in the global economy. We need to find
new ways of being world class at long-established technologies too.
We don't want to be in a niche. That's where you are in a corner and
can't move. We want to be a big worldwide business

After analysing the facts, William Russell finds that Sir William Kerr
Fraser has managed to define the question until there is just one answer
NEVER put an unconsidered question to a top civil servant, past or
present. The analytical mind will leave you both feeling humble and
humbled. Always be sure of the meaning of your question, because you
will be asked to explain it.
Sir William Kerr Fraser, Principal of Glasgow University since 1988,
retires later this year, so it seemed a good idea to tackle the man who
was a most distinguished Permanent Under Secretary at the Scottish
Office from 1977-88 before returning to the rarefied academic heights of
Gilmorehill, from which he came -- Sir William is a Glasgow graduate --
about his heroes and heroines.
''The more I thought about it, the more I decided I did not have
heroes and heroines in my life,'' he said. ''I looked up hero in my new
Chambers Dictionary and it talked about courage in the face of
adversity,'' he continued. It was like being back in a history tutorial.
Was he going to decline to reveal his selection? No, he was merely
defining the terms of reference, which is what all academics and civil
servants do as a matter of course. Not for them the unconsidered phrase,
the inelegant question or answer. All was soon clear.
''I do have role models,'' he said. ''I can think of a whole galaxy of
unsung heroes and unidentified heroines, people about whom I say --
There, but for the grace of God, go I. They are the carers of this
world.
''I suppose, when I was young, my heroes were people like the first
transatlantic fliers, men like Alcock and Brown, but to give them as one
of my heroes sounds a bit old hat today. Maybe a hero can pass his
sell-by date?
''I have been ruminating all week about who to chose. Prompted by all
the publicity about Auschwitz I think of the heroes in the camps, men
like Dietrich Bonhoeffer. That would be the kind of person I would think
of as a hero, but I prefer role models.
''There is an old man living in Edinburgh, Sir Charles Cunningham, who
was my role model as a civil servant. He was the head of the first
department I was in at the Scottish Office, and became head of the Home
Office from 1957-66. I admired his sheer intellectual grasp and
capacity, and his integrity.
''In the job I am in at present I certainly have as a role model the
principal who was here when I was a student. You know who that was.''
This is a reference to the fact that I too once lingered on Gilmorehill
more or less about the same time as Sir William. His choice was, of
course, Sir Hector Hetherington.
''I admired him as an administrator, as a public servant and a man of
immense quality, he said. ''I have already mentioned Bonhoeffer for his
courage and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice. Think of all the
people I have offended by forgetting about them, but if you mean by
heroes people who have displayed courage and integrity and bravery then
I would start off by thinking about carers. I admire people who go and
work in places like Rwanda, people who have the courage to face dealing
with things I am not sure I have the courage to face. It can be physical
courage, but it is also moral courage.
''I suppose I have been influenced by preaching, having been a sermon
taster for a long time, but they could not be role models as I never saw
myself as a minister of the Kirk.''
I wondered about heroes from literature, but Sir William said that
while some people were good at retaining heroes from books, he read for
recreation in the same sense that he went for a walk. Unless it was
outstanding he tended to forget about it afterwards. ''I think I am
unusual in that respect, and certainly different from my wife and
family,'' he added. As for authors, as far as style went he liked Evelyn
Waugh and Graham Greene, but he was not sure he greatly admired what
they wrote about. ''It is their craftsmanship, their way with words that
I admire, just as I admire the people who put the King James Bible
together, and regret the extent to which we have departed from it. But
maybe that is a sign of age.''
Sir William then revealed he has his Walter Mitty side, by confessing
that his hero would be a great international organist like the Italian
teacher, Fernando Germani, author of one of the definitive manuals for
organists. ''He could have been an absolutely dreadful person, but it is
as a musician I admire him,'' he said, clearly confessing to
day-dreaming about sitting one day at the organ.
He also confessed to being a broken reed when it came to sportsmen and
sportswomen, but then, he said, sporting heroes and heroines seemed to
be so transient. He admired the dedication of the man in the Lucoazade
ads, but he could never be his hero.
At first he said he intended to ''leave politicians out of it'' --
civil servants tend to remain totally discreet to the end of their days
-- then went as far as to admit he admired Rab Butler as Home Secretary,
not only for the Education Act, but for the way he bit the bullet over
immigration at a time when everyone was saying it was racist to suggest
some controls were necessary.
As for military people, it was difficult to think of anyone who had
not turned out to have feet of clay among those represented as heroes 50
years ago when he was young. ''Montgomery, Eisenhower, Alexander have
all been the subject of rubbishing biographies,'' he said. ''And since
they were not in peril themselves, although they carried very heavy
responsibilities, I am not sure they fit into the category of hero.
''As far as the visual artists are concerned I am not going to get
into that,'' he said. I wondered why? ''Because of the Principal's
portrait. I retire in September, and the problem is selecting the artist
to paint it. Should it be a portrait which is recognisable, or should it
be a great painting. Preferably it should be both. So -- eliminate the
politicians, the military men, the artists and my relatives -- be sure
and mention the relatives -- and I am stuck with the musician.''
Which all seemed fine, and it wasn't until I had written this
interview up that I realised Sir William, while having provided some
substantial male role models, had left his heroines unsung.

ARE women millionaires different from men? Yes, says motivational guru
Colin Turner, who was speaking at a conference last weekend at
Gleneagles Hotel to launch the Scottish branch of the British
Association of Women Entrepreneurs.
He maintains research shows the average male millionaire goes bust
twice before he makes it, while women do so less than once.
So, what are the qualifications for joining this new and exclusive
club? Well, you've got to be prepared to put your own capital at risk,
says Marilyn Orcharton, newly elected chair of the British Association
of Women Entrepreneurs (BAWE) Scotland and founder of Denplan, the UK's
leading dental health plan. A former dentist she now runs Kite
Consultants, a Glasgow-based company providing services to firms seeking
registration.
Meanwhile, Colin Turner, author of Born to Succeed, doesn't hold with
the view that entrepreneurs are born not made. ''We've all got the
potential within us. Tap into it and learn to focus.''
Millionaires, whether men or women, tend to share the same
characteristics: total dedication, single-mindedness and refusal to take
no for an answer. They also have another and that's the ability to
relate to people at all levels.
The lack of formal qualifications is no deterrent to becoming a
millionaire. After all, Richard Branson doesn't have a university
degree. Indeed, a degree may lull some people into thinking it
automatically gives them the right to a job.
Tina Knight, a millionaire with her own computer company in Essex,
tells the story of one young woman interviewed by her personnel
department who expected to be given a job in marketing at #25,000, even
though she had absolutely no work experience.
''Determination, not a degree is what is needed,'' says
multi-millionaire Vera Wiesfeld of What Everyone Wants fame. ''I have a
degree from the university of life and that's more important.''
Many women at the conference were clear who they saw as their mentor:
Margaret Thatcher. Even though they might not share her political
beliefs, they were unashamedly pro-Thatcher for the simple reason that,
as one woman put it, she ''broke the mould. It's easier for the rest of
us to get where we are today.''
Today's business women, many delegates maintained, give short shrift
to positive discrimination policies and are particularly scathing about
the Social Charter which offers minimum rates of pay and rights for
part-time workers, seeing this as a recipe for disaster. Tina Knight is
vocal on this issue: ''The choice for many small companies is between
offering part-time work or no work at all.''
Oh yes, here's a tip from Colin Turner for potential millionaires: do
the unexpected. He should know, he is one twice over.
Finally, the newly elected chair of BAWE Scotland Marilyn Orcharton
advised delegates: ''Work hard then anything is possible. Go for it.''

GLASGOW Jazz Festival has released details of the artists who will be
appearing this summer. Predictable as always, I'm afraid, and it is left
to Edinburgh again to promise the sound of surprise -- that so-vital
element in the music.
The programme has not been finalised by Edinburgh's jazz festival
director, Mike Hart, but I do know that the immensely gifted Dick Hyman
will be giving an organ recital in St Giles' Cathedral using the church
instrument that was rebuilt at enormous cost seven years or so ago.
The church outing will give Hyman an opportunity to pursue his love
for the organ which has surfaced at regular intervals throughout his
varied career. When the pianist is not writing music for one of Woody
Allen's movies or playing at festivals across the world or recording
duet albums with other keyboard giants such as Ralph Sutton, he is
liable to be playing a giant theatre organ for a group of enthusiasts
somewhere in the United States.
It's clear he loves the sound he can coax from the instrument and,
equally, he is able to adapt the instrument to jazz without any great
difficulty. There has often been antagonism shown towards the organ,
although Wild Bill Davis and Jimmy Smith did much to popularise the
Hammond organ.
Davis even spent some years playing with the Duke Ellington Orchestra
towards the end of Ellington's life, and recordings with Johnny Hodges
and Lawrence Brown, distinguised Ducal sidemen, remain as a testament to
how well the instrument could fit in. Hyman, of course, does not use the
Hammond. Clearly, he fell under the sway of Fats Waller's early
recordings on pipe organ and that is the route he has taken in frequent
concert appearances and on two glorious albums made with cornettist Ruby
Braff.
The title and content of the first album, recorded for the Chiaroscuro
label in the late seventies, give the game away. It was called Fats
Waller's Heavenly Jive and featured Hyman on his own Baldwin organ,
duetting with Braff on tracks that Waller had also recorded on pipe
organ.
There is Soothing Syrup Stomp, first cut by Waller in 1926, Sugar, and
I Ain't Got Nobody, and I'm Gonna See My Ma, made a year later and
lovingly restored by the two men who adored Fats and all his music. The
other group of Hyman-Braff duets came in 1984, when Hyman was invited to
play a giant theatre organ in Pittsburgh and Ruby went along to join in.
He did so to great effect, particularly on a hauntingly moving America
The Beautiful, an anthem you might think an unlikely vehicle for jazz
musicians but which has also been recorded by Al Cohn, among others.
The basic truth about Hyman and his organ-playing is that he can make
the ponderous, often clumsy-sounding instrument dance and swing with a
grace and invention of which Waller would have approved. Now, in August,
Hyman will parade his ''organic jazz'' in St Giles'. I'm certain the
lure of the instrument itself, originally built in 1878 before being
massively reconstructed, at enormous cost, has attracted Hyman back to
Edinburgh.
ONE thing is certain, Hyman will approach the St Giles' organ with a
loving care and a genuine respect and I would be surprised if the music
did not include some of that ''Heavenly Jive'' mentioned earlier.
Meantime, we have the Braff duets to whet our appetites for Edinburgh
and get our ears accustomed to the swelling surge of the organ.
If you simply want to listen to Hyman, then a double CD, where the
pianist celebrates the music of Gershwin, Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, and
others, is available. It is classic jazz piano playing, Hyman at his
impeccable best as he works his magic on some of the greatest of
American popular songs.

IMAGINE that you run a substantial Scottish company. It may be in
cars, IT, financial services, paper or a host of other markets. That
doesn't matter: the bottom line is that your customers are primarily
other businesses up and down the land and maybe overseas, too.
Naturally life is tough these days. The competition just gets hotter,
the multi-nationals are biting at your tail and the pace of change in
markets and technology is phenomenal.
In turn it is becoming ever more difficult to sell to the companies
that your supply, normally the medium to larger players. So many
products are now mere commodity items where the lowest price gets the
deal and refinements such as excellent service are taken for granted and
no longer provide a competitive advantage despite the costs involved.
In short, business ain't looking great. What's the answer? Simple.
Just refocus your company on the huge and largely untapped market on
your doorstep -- your local entrepreneurs.
All around Scotland are these energetic, committed people striving to
build substantial businesses. As a matter of fact, there are more
high-growth companies (defined as achieving annual sales increases of
25% and more) today than at any time in the past 20 years. Research we
are carrying out with the help of Scottish Enterprise and Ernst &amp; Young
has so far identified more than 400 in that mould. Behind them are a
considerably larger number of businesses still growing ambitiously even
if not so fast.
These people all have quite specific requirements across the spectrum
of business products and services. They usually want them yesterday,
don't want any hassle and would rather deal with one reliable,
imaginative supplier.
Yet more often than not I hear horror stories from such entrepreneurs
about the difficulties of trying to persuade large bureaucratic
companies to consider supplying what they might actually require.
Take IT, the classic nightmare for any fast-growing company. Despite
what is said by the manufacturers and their resellers, it is remarkably
hard to buy a system that is capable of almost infinite expansion in
line with a business's growth. This is particularly so when -- as is
common -- the entrepreneur has no clue where the business will be in
three years time so cannot provide an accurate spec.
Big companies specialise in selling to each other. Their marketing
strategies and campaigns are orientated to that end. Few of them
appreciate that not only the largest single market overall but the
fastest growing one for a vast range of products and services is
represented by Mr and Mrs Entrepreneur.
The programmed salespeople who have the misfortune to work for these
behemoths focus only on meeting their ever higher targets. All they know
is trying to sell standard products to the larger customers who buy
hundreds and thousands at a time. Any other type of customer is lumped
into the ''small'' category and told to take it or leave it -- which, of
course, they often do.
In America they call this entrepreneurs' market the Third Market and a
growing number of multi-nationals including IBM, AT&amp;T and Merrill Lynch
are seeing the light and developing specialist products.
Incidentally, the man who named this market, one Wilson Harrall, a
typical US entrepreneur who has become the breed's national champion
through his campaigning columns in newspapers and magazines, is coming
to Scotland. On June 19 he is due to address the first national
entrepreneurs' conference to be held here, at the Royal Concert Hall in
Glasgow organised by Scottish Enterprise with ourselves. Other speakers
include Gio Benedietti and Jack Black.
While on the entrepreneurial tack, let me reiterate my firm belief
that we are right on the verge of a substantial revolution in the
Scottish business economy. Entrepreneurs in the true sense of the word
-- people who are utterly committed to building their companies -- are
surfacing everywhere I look. I know of a growing number of businesses
that expect to double or even treble their sales over the next year, and
that is a new phenomenon.
Not only do we have this new breed around that is instinctively
capable of managing rapid growth, but there is a fast developing network
of like-minded people working as non-executive advisers and business
angels. Perceptibly, the culture is changing.
There is still a long way to go. And it would help if large companies
picked up the message. But a powerful engine of growth is now turning
over with increasing force. At last!

THE Bank of Scotland, which celebrated its 300th anniversary this week
with record annual pre-tax profits of #450m, has done things in a
certain way since it was established in the final years of the old
Scottish Parliament.
Things do not alter quickly on The Mound but the bank's current
Governor, Sir Bruce Pattullo, did change a centuries-old tradition when
he was appointed to the post four years ago.
On June 11, 1991 Sir Bruce, 57, became the first professional banker
to hold this mighty position. He is also the first ever executive
governor of Scotland's oldest surviving bank.
However, his attitude to the tercentenary celebrations of the Governor
and Company of the Bank of Scotland (to give it its full title) would
seem to reflect his appreciation of the value of tradition.
He decreed that the party should not last for the entire 12 months --
instead it should begin no earlier than Burns' birthday on January 25
and end by St Andrew's Day on November 30.
It would, therefore, appear there is no danger of the Bank of
Scotland's headquarters being rocked to its foundations as a result of
the decision to instal a professional banker in the top job.
A spokesman confirmed that the proper name for shareholders was
proprietors. And it would be unthinkable to hear Sir Bruce, who joined
the bank in 1961, referred to by his dual title of group chief
executive, rather than governor.
This respect for tradition seems to have done the Bank of Scotland no
harm at all in the cut-throat modern world of banking -- the rise in
operating profits it announced this week has proved elusive to the
English clearers.
Walk on the
wild side
THOSE nurturing the belief that actuaries are dull might change their
minds if they met Harvie Brown, a partner at the Glasgow offices of
employee benefits consultant William M Mercer.
Mr Brown, who is still wiping the snow off his skis after a week on
the pistes in the French Alps, jets out to Toronto today for the annual
conference of Mercer's international partners. He and Bruce Rigby, his
Edinburgh-based colleague, will represent Scotland at the 100 delegate
meeting.
The conference is normally held in the US but this year Mercer is
going back to its Canadian roots to celebrate its 50th anniversary.
Mr Brown is undoubtedly burdened with heavy actuarial responsibilities
-- he was a member of the Goode Committee which investigated the future
of UK pension provision. But he still finds time to pursue other
challenges.
The day after returning from Toronto, he will set off to tramp the
West Highland Way with colleagues Andrew Crawford and Tom Cuthbert.
Mr Brown said: ''We just like the challenge and want to show that men
in their forties can still walk 100 miles.''
Measure of
amazement
EUROCRAT Peter Wilmott is a man who speaks his mind -- regardless of
who is paying for his meal.
And Mr Wilmott, guest of honour at The Scotch Whisky Association's
annual slap-up lunch at Glasgow's Moat House this week, was not shy
about telling the 120 guests, who represented virtually the entire
industry, exactly what they didn't want to hear.
Before the civil servant, who advises the new commissioner responsible
for the excise duty regime in the European Union, Italian academic Mario
Monti, stood up to speak, some of those present were preparing
themselves for a bland but diplomatic speech.
And he certainly started uncontentiously enough -- whisky chiefs
seemed to accept his view that there was no quick fix to the disparity
in the tax treatment of whisky and wine by member states.
However, the shaking of heads and tutting began when Mr Wilmott
started to argue for a majority voting system on excise duties, to
replace the current unanimity arrangement which allows the UK Government
to defend whisky if it is so minded.
Surprise turned to astonishment when Mr Wilmott boldly confessed that
he would advise Mr Monti not to make a case for continuing the duty-free
regime beyond 1999. Duty-free sales within the European Union are worth
between #60m and #80m annually to the whisky industry.
Perhaps it was lucky that he was speaking in Glasgow, where clear
heads and cool tempers are the order of the day. If he had been
addressing excitable Latin wine producers in Southern Europe in such a
manner, he might have been lucky to get back to Brussels.
Badly tied in
legal knots
EIGHT years of looking at Edinburgh University legal eagle Alan Barr's
colourful ties caught up with his co-author at a lunch this week to mark
the success of their book.
Hugh Stevens of Edinburgh solicitor Brodies could not restrain himself
from introducing Mr Barr as a sufferer of RTS.
Puzzled guests were making up their minds whether or not this should
evoke their sympathy when they realised he was staring at Mr Barr's tie.
Mr Stevens, fellow Brodies' partner Andrew Dalgleish and Tods Murray
partner John Biggar had to get used to the bright ties favoured by Mr
Barr during eight years of work on Drafting Wills in Scotland.
RTS, Mr Stevens explained, stood for Repulsive Tie Syndrome. Mr Barr,
who has about 150 brash ties, gets them from his wife, who has a shop in
Arran which sells them.
The director of the legal practice unit at Edinburgh University said:
''When you do a lot of lectures on tax, you need something to brighten
things up.''
Trustworthy
work history
LYNDON Bolton has retired as joint managing director of Alliance Trust
after more than three decades with the Dundee-based firm that has #1300m
of funds under management.
''He has been with us for 31 years and our retirement age is 60,''
said Alliance Trust's other managing director, Gavin Suggett, after a
farewell bash on Thursday. ''He is planning a move down to Norfolk and
is looking forward to a peaceful retirement.''
But Mr Bolton is not withdrawing completely from the financial scene.
He will remain a director of the General Accident insurance group, which
has its headquarters just up the Tay from Alliance Trust in Perth.
Alliance Trust has not appointed a new joint managing director to
replace him. His work on the investment side will be largely taken over
by Alan Young, 49, who is one of the trust's two executive directors.
The other is Mr Suggett.
''Alan Young has been with us for eight years and has wide experience
in many areas of the market,'' Mr Suggett said.
In tune with
the Chinese
SCOTTISHPOWER set China humming this month, but not with the surplus
energy that limited capacity on the interconnector prevents it exporting
to England.
The Scottish electricity generator launched a charm offensive on the
power-hungry Chinese by sending its 22-member pipe band to an
international festival of marching bands in Beijing.
Gordon Laidlaw, a ScottishPower public relations officer who went with
them, said that although Scottish culture is seldom seen behind the
bamboo curtain, Chinese audiences were certainly well acquainted with
Auld Lang Syne.
This traditional farewell song is mainly used as a welcoming number in
China and proved a big favourite at the ScottishPower concerts.
''Whenever we played it they hummed along quietly to the tune,'' Mr
Laidlaw said.
Despite this low-key response, they made clear that they expected full
entertainment value from these strangely dressed Scots. ''If you are
wearing a kilt they expect you to be able to dance at the same time as
you are playing,'' he explained.
Another complication was the extremely dry climate in the Chinese
capital. ''One of our biggest problems was the that the pipes dried up.
We had to keep adding water to the sheepskin to keep them in tune.''

* I have just retired with an index-linked pension of #15,000 plus a
state pension. I wish to create a medium-risk investment portfolio to
complement my existing savings and will have #57,000 in cash available.
My present savings are: building societies #17,000, PEPs #16,500 (plus
a further #12,000 to be invested), unit trusts #4500 (plus #10,000 to
come), Prudential with-profits bond #10,000 (plus #10,000), Tessas
#12,000 and #15,500 National Savings Certificates. I intend to put
#25,000 into a Sun Life distribution bond and invest my #15,000 AVC in a
with-profits annuity with Equitable Life. I have no major liabilities,
and my wife is already retired and has her own pension and investments.
Do you find the above a reasonable balance and spread? I shall be
rather cash heavy due to developments at Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society and Leeds Permanent, the economic situation and the
possibility of moving into a smaller house this summer. Is having
#45,000 in only two insurance companies an acceptable risk? Is a
with-profits annuity likely to provide a larger return than a level
annuity over a 15-year term?
* Your portfolio appears soundly based. There is very little risk in
limiting yourself to two insurance companies, given the regulatory
protection and the standing of the two companies concerned. The income
from a with-profits annuity will start off a lot less than a
conventional annuity but the total return over 15 years should be
considerably superior.
* I took early retirement five years ago, aged 57. At the time I was
advised by the financial consultant appointed by my firm to invest the
majority of my lump sum in a Norwich Union capital plan (with-profits
section). I took this advice and invested #30,000. My original
investment has now grown by 50% over the five years. In addition, there
will be a terminal bonus.
While I am reasonably happy with this return, I continually read about
the wisdom of investing in PEPs, unit trusts and investment trusts, and
the danger of having all your eggs in one basket. The more I read about
the above, the more concerned I become about continuing with the capital
plan.
I would appreciate your advice on whether I should stay with the
capital plan, or would I be better to transfer some or all of the money
into the other areas and in the process spread my investments?
* Share prices were all over the place during 1990, the year you
invested your money. This was because of the onset of recession and the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which led to a sharp jump in the oil price. The
FTSE-100 share index traded in a range of 1990 to 2463. Recently it has
been on either side of 3200.
Undoubtedly you have done well out of this investment, though the
performance may be no better than the market indices. Your own
inclination is right. You should reinvest some of the proceeds of your
bond in unit or investment trusts, which are ideal for the small
investor. Having too many eggs in one basket is one of the biggest
unnecessary risks an investor can take.
* I have two with-profits endowment policies with Friends Provident,
which I started in 1981 and which are due to mature in mid-1998. I pay
#44 monthly for the two. Taken together the guaranteed sums are
approximately #8000 and bonuses to date are about #8500.
I have asked Friends Provident for an estimate of the likely final
value of these policies in 1998 but it will only quote the usual
illustration figure based on 5% or 10% growth. However, it did tell me
that the current terminal bonus for policies like mine maturing now is
118% of declared bonuses.
Am I correct in figuring that if the present rate of bonus is
maintained the policies would be worth approximately #30,000 in 1998,
made up of #8000 guaranteed sum, #11,000 declared bonuses and #13,000
terminal bonus?
This sum of #30,000 seems very large for such an investment over 17
years. Have I done my sums correctly, and if so what would be the return
on the investment?
* Friends Provident calculates that on your figures a maturity value
of #30,000 would equate to a return of 11.5% on your gross monthly
premium of #50.42. This is consistent with the current maturing Friends
Provident policies, where the yield ranges from 10.9% for a 10-year
contract to 13% for a 25-year policy.
However, neither Friends Provident nor anyone else can predict future
investment returns and it is hazardous to project past returns forward.
In fact, the eighties were an exceptional period for equities and
returns are likely to be less in a low-inflation world. Current bonus
rates are on a gently declining path and likely to remain so for some
time. So it would probably be wise to assume that you won't quite get
#30,000 at the end of the day.
* I own a furnished property which I currently let to my daughter and
grandchildren for #350 pcm. She works full-time and receives housing
benefit and family credit. If I allowed them to live rent free what, if
any, would be the tax implications?
I wondered when I advised the Inland Revenue that I was no longer in
receipt of this income if my daughter would be deemed to be receiving
#350 pcm as a gift or if it would be treated as unearned income and she
would have to pay income tax on this sum.
* Your daughter will certainly have no income tax liability if you
allow her to live in the property rent free. It is likely that the
amount of rent you forego will be considered a gift for inheritance tax
purposes and this will be quantified as the amount you could expect to
receive if the property was let at a commercial rate. This may or may
not be the #350 a month you mention and could be decided on the rents
charged for similar properties in the area.
If foregoing the rent has no effect on your current lifestyle, you
should be able to persuade the Revenue that the gifts are made out of
income and are, therefore, exempt. It will be necessary to do this over
a number of years before this exemption could be established.

The Herald's team of reviewers guides you to listening pleasure
Verdi Requiem/Four Sacred Pieces (Philips)
* HERE it is, freshly unwrapped, still settling onto the record
shelves, and already the most talked-about recording of the season. A
fiver says that, in specialist magazines' annual awards at the end of
the year, this double CD will walk off with the Oscars in at least one
category.
John Eliot Gardiner's period instrument band, the Orchestre
Revolutionnaire et Romantique (who recently produced the most
astonishing set of Beethoven symphonies in decades) are joined by the
Monteverdi Choir and a largely stellar set of soloists in a performance
of the greatest of all Requiems that is stunningly sensitive and
electrifyingly dramatic.
Three of the soloists -- soprano Luba Orgonasova, mezzo Anne Sofie von
Otter, and bass Alastair Miles (heading for greatness, this man) -- give
the most commanding performances of their careers. Tenor Luca Canonici
(sorely stretched at points) is the weak link.
The performance -- the first Verdi Requiem on period instruments -- is
a stunner. Never will you hear such explosive thwacks in the Dies Irae
-- you'll be out of your seat. The breathtaking clarity of choral and
orchestral performance (wonderfully characterful French woodwind and
rasping brass) is vintage Eliot Gardiner.
Nothing, of course, will ever displace the great 1964 Giulini
recording (a miraculous version, plugged straight into God) but this one
immediately demands a place beside it in the rankings. Coupled (only on
CD version) with a heavenly performance of the Four Sacred Pieces. Go
buy. Now.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Picture This, Wet Wet Wet (Mercury)
* TWELVE medium-rated, mid-paced slabs of fair-to-middling
middle-of-the-road melodicism, including Yon Big Hit of Ninety-Four,
Love Is All Around. Mr Pellow's voice ululates pleasantly. There are
many happy instances of instrumental dynamism. From time to time one
laments the absence of an up-tempo belter. As we all know by now, the
album's sleeve is the work of an assembly of top Scottish visual
artists. And jolly visual it is, too. But unfortunately, in between the
artwork you can still read the Wets' own hand-crafted lyrics. Dear dear
dear. Instead of getting the painters in, it would surely have been
better to enlist the talents of a bunch of clued-up wordsmiths to pen
oor Wetties some song-lines that made sense for once. ''Honed like
cherry wine.'' No, never. ''But words don't age for me to turn to
gold.'' Eh? ''And the fire slowly grooves.'' Whit whit whit, ya eedjits?
For the next album, Wets, sign up James Kelman.
Dig In!, Huevos Rancheros (One Louder)
* IN the wake of Dick Dale and oor ain dear Beat Poets, yet another
heap of blazing-hot twang-o-rama de luxe! As well as being a piquant and
nourishing fast-food treat, Huevos Rancheros are a tasty three-piece
from Calgary. Their tunes are boss. They crank it up real high.
Devolution 1, various (Big Life)
* SUBTITLED Alternative Rock Classics 1975-85, this collection
actually focuses on 1980-81 and reveals some of the tragically few
heart-warming things to have been born amid the icy tundra of the first
Thatcherite era. Chief among the album's dozen 12-inch mixes is New
Order's insistent Temptation; the angular urgency of Once In A Lifetime
by Talking Heads; the B-52's cheesily-eerie Planet Claire, and the
hectoring punk-funk which propelled p.i.l's This Is Not A Love Song. The
stand-out, however, is Pete Shelley's timeless electro dance-anthem,
Homo Sapien, the quintessential song for all shy boys and coy boys;
cruisers and losers; me and you, sir.
Swimming In The Horsespool, Sugartown (Marina)
* ATMOSPHERIC; melancholic; woozily wondrous in a
lonely-chimes-at-midnight kinda way. And by cracky, it's made in
Scotland by loin-girders, native talents who are brave and true. Tammies
off to gutsy chanteuse Gwen Stewart and plucky axeman Douglas MacIntyre,
nobly assisted by the McCluskey Brothers, James Grant, Paul McGeechan,
Gordon Wilson, Mick Slaven, Iain Harvie and David Crichton.
DAVID BELCHER
Carry the Day, Henry Threadgill (Columbia)
* MUSIC, for Threadgill, has always been a voyage of discovery, and
here his sometimes pleading, sometimes nostalgic, occasionally caustic
alto saxophone travels through baptist churches, Greek tavernas,
Argentinian brothels, and heavy metal thrashes, passages of total
serenity and blasts of glorious near-mayhem. Very Very Circus Plus, he
calls this multi-cultural ensemble of tuba, accordion, fiddle, french
horn, guitars, and percussion, and certainly there's never a dull
moment.
More &amp; More, Rock Salt &amp; Nails (Iona)
* THE young Shetlanders' second album captures the spirit of
knockabout fun central to their live performances. Quicksilver fiddle
and guitar tunes, with nods towards both their homeland and Bluegrass
music, are played with their distinctive brand of reckless elan.
ROB ADAMS
Shorty &amp; Doc, Shorty Baker and Doc Cheatham (Original Jazz Classics)
* EXCELLENT reissue of the 1961 album featuring two unjustly
overlooked trumpet-playing sidemen from the big band days. Here they
prove themselves as frontliners, co-leading a rhythm section through a
sextet of numbers that combine classy unison playing and funky solos.
Witness the downright grooviness of Good Queen Bess and the quite superb
Night Train -- a slowed-down, divided-up version of classic piano boogie
woogie.
The Ralph Sharon Trio Swings the Sammy Cahn Songbook (DRG)
* ELEVEN of the fourteen tracks on this CD suffer from a kind of
blandness that occasionally afflicts piano trio albums. Ralph Sharon is
perhaps best known these days as Tony Bennett's accompanist -- and, on
the evidence of this collection, that is perhaps a part he plays better
than front-liner/tune carrier.

* I have opted to take early retirement from my company when I will be
54 years of age. I am married with two student children. My wife does
not work.
I have three options under my pension scheme: a pension of #18,000 a
year, a pension of #15,000 and a tax-free lump sum of #40,100, or the
opportunity to increase my pension to either #19,200 (option one) or
#16,000 on condition that it is reduced by #3000 at age 65 when I
qualify for state pension. In addition, whatever option I take I will
receive a tax-free compensation payment of #8000.
I have a mortgage of #30,000 which is supported by a Standard Life
low-cost endowment which qualifies for tax relief and matures in 2001.
The interest rate is fixed at 5%. My house is worth around #130,000.
Which option would you advise me to accept, and should I clear my
mortgage with part of the lump sum?
* To preserve some flexibility it is usually better to take part of
the pension entitlement as a lump sum which can generate almost as much
income as the pension given up. As for the option of increasing the
immediate pension in exchange for a reduction when you reach 65 this
really has to be a personal decision, though you are lucky to have such
a possibility.
Your mortgage appears to be on such advantageous terms that it would
be better to maintain it provided you can afford to do so.
* I have a question on National Savings Certificates. In all the
leaflets I have read it is stated that these are free of UK taxation.
Can you say if this exemption applies to inheritance tax so that these
can be left out when calculating the amount of an estate liable to tax?
* National Savings Certificates are free of UK income and capital
gains taxes but can, however, be liable to inheritance tax. IHT is
charged on value transferred either by chargeable lifetime gifts or
under the provisions of a will.
Many assets which are not chargeable to other taxes are liable to IHT,
for example an individual's main residence is exempt from capital gains
tax but on death is part of that person's estate and potentially liable
to IHT.
It is the same with National Savings Certificates, and the value of
these taken into account for IHT purposes includes accrued interest,
although this is not considered to be income of the deceased or the
executives.

THE FIRST steps towards Basile Boli's exit from Ibrox might well be
taken today when Turkish club Fenerbahce watch him in action against
Motherwell.
There may be nothing certain in football, but it is very nearly
guaranteed that the French defender will be plying his trade in another
part of the world next season, and the Turks are making the running to
take him abroad.
Rangers manager Walter Smith admitted yesterday that the Turkish club
had been in touch about the former Marseille player, but added that this
was as far as it had gone. Fenerbahce are managed by the ex-Marseille
manager, Tomislav Ivic, who has been reported recently as eager to
persuade his former star turn to try his luck in Turkey.
The Turks are wealthy enough to offer Boli the terms he would require
and can well afford the fee Rangers would expect, which would not be far
away from the #2.7m paid by the club last summer.
He and Brian Laudrup, who cost #2.3m from Fiorentina of Italy, arrived
at the same time but, while the Dane has made a massive impact on the
game in this country, Boli has been short of expectations. It is no
great secret that Rangers would be very willing to see the Frenchman
head for pastures new.
Smith said yesterday that another unnamed club had made inquiries
about Basile, but no bid had been forthcoming. The Turks could win the
race before it begins, however, if they get down to serious discussions
after today's match.
Boli is one of four players who will be added to the pool from the
squad that was on duty in the win over Kilmarnock in their last game,
Trevor Steven, Mark Hateley and Billy Thomson being the others.
Motherwell, who lead the fascinating race for second place, need the
points even if Rangers don't, and that place in Euorpe should be a
powerful incentive for the club that have chased it with such admirable
determination all season. They have a doubt about Miodrag Krivokapic,
but otherwise are in good fettle for whatb should be an open contest.
Their manager, Alex McLeish, has no doubts that Rangers, despite having
nothing left to play for, will be as keen as ever to win in front of
their full house of demanding watchers.
One of their challengers for the runners-up spot, Celtic, need to put
an end to the run of the surprise team of the year, Falkirk, if they are
to take advanatage of any slip-up by Motherwell at Ibrox. The Brockville
side have lost only once in their last 10 games, and know that the
outrageous dream of a European place has been tansformed into a genuine
possibility. ''If we beat Celtic and Motherwell fail to beat Rangers, we
would then be in the position where we could only lose second place by
our own efforts.'' said manager Jim Jefferies who, to his credit, seems
as awestruck by the reality as the rest of us.
Celtic could have Dutch striker Pierre van Hooydonk on the bench as he
recovers from the injury that has kept him out for some weeks, but Tosh
McKInlay has a good chance of playing following his hamstring problem.
Paul McStay, who had to call off from the international in San Marino,
is fit to return.
''It is a very big game for us,'' said manager Tommy Burns: ''Falkirk
ahave done tremendously well and, like us, they are chasing second place
along with others. It will all be down to who is the most determined and
it is up to us to show that we are the ones. We have to look at our
league games as five cup finals before the cup final.''
Falkirk will be without Paul McGrillen, who has had to have a
cartilage operation, but they have had to cope with injuires most of the
seaosn adn at their own patch, where they and Celtic have had some
memorable recent encounters, will be formidable opponents.

Have a happy holiday: using credit cards is now part and parcel of any
trip abroad, whether for business or pleasure. Soon we could be a step
closer to knowing the real cost.
KRONAS, kroons and kinas on your credit card probably mean you've been
splashing out in Iceland, Estonia or Papua New Guinea -- and very soon
you could be one step nearer finding out how much it has all really been
costing you.
Using plastic cards is now part and parcel of any holiday or business
trip abroad. Last year British Visa cardholders alone used their cards
more than 38 million times, spending almost $4000m in places as far
afield as Sri Lanka and Brazil.
The great advantage of using plastic is that you don't have to pay out
for foreign money before you go -- as you do with travellers cheques and
currency.
You can pay for goods in shops, restaurants and hotels in exactly the
same way you do at home, as well as withdrawing cash from dispensing
machines, using the same PIN number you would in your High Street, while
the locals are having their siesta. You can also obtain over-the-counter
advances from banks.
Another advantage is that you usually get a much better exchange rate
than if you use some other method of swapping your pounds for pesetas or
your fivers for francs. The big names such as Visa and MasterCard get
large discounts on quoted exchange rates because they are processing so
many transactions each day. The rates might typically be around 5%
better than the local tourist ones.
But there are costs involved which eat into the savings you would
otherwise make from these competitive exchange rates. If you use your
credit or debit card to obtain currency abroad there is a 1.5% handling
charge (minimum #1.50) although this doesn't apply when you're making a
purchase.
Also, you may not be aware of the charge your card issuer imposes when
it converts foreign currency into sterling. This could be as high as 3%
but is not always spelt out. You pay this by getting a worse exchange
rate than the one quoted by the big card companies to the banks and
building societies which issue their cards.
At present many card issuers give a pretty vague explanation of how
they arrive at the sterling equivalent of your overseas spending, simply
saying that foreign transactions will be converted into pounds at a rate
determined by them. However, from June 1 Visa is requiring all banks and
building societies issuing its cards to say exactly what charges are
made when the conversion takes place.
Some issuers already do this, usually in the information book that
comes with your new or replacement card. For example, the NatWest Access
booklet says: ''An administration levy of 2.75% is added to the
converted sterling amount.'' And, every year, Barclays sends customers
information about using its Barclaycard or Connect card abroad which
mentions an additional fee of 2.65%.
Some banks charge more than this -- at Midland the levy is 3% --
others charge less. Among the cheapest are the Bank of Scotland at 1.75%
and Yorkshire Bank at 1.69%. The most usual charge is 2.75%.
It is up to individual banks to decide how much extra revenue they
take when they convert your foreign purchases or cash withdrawals into
sterling. The chances are though that, if your bank or society
previously kept this charge well hidden, competition will force it down
once the figures are out in the open.
And card competition is certainly hotting up. No less than four new
cards have been hitting the headlines this week. The more you spend with
the new Midland Bank card the bigger discount you qualify for on a
Peugeot car, while cards from the TSB and Barclays are aimed at
customers wary of building up high debts and have credit limits of only
#500 or less.
The new American Express credit card, on the other hand, offers the
lowest interest rate to the highest spenders -- 1.3% a month (16.7% APR)
if you spend more than #1000 a year. It carries a hefty #20 annual fee
however. If you clear your bill each month you can easily pay less --
Barclaycard charges #10, S&amp;P/Robert Fleming #12 and has a lower interest
rate. The N&amp;P building society, the TSB and the Co-operative Bank are
among a handful of organisations making no yearly charge at all.
If you do borrow money regularly on your credit card, then the Royal
Bank of Scotland's MasterCard beats them all, with no annual fee and a
monthly interest charge of just 1.14% (an APR of only 14.5%).
Although explicit information about the commission charge will help
you work out if your pieces of plastic really are the cheapest way of
buying anything from an agarot to a zloty, you're still unlikely to see
the actual exchange rate used quoted on your statement.
S&amp;P/Robert Fleming is the only large card issuer already providing
that information for the majority of customers -- and from Monday all
its cardholders will be be able to see the exchange rate that has been
used to convert foreign transactions to sterling on their statements.

I feel very good about this and I see no reason why I can't win on
Sunday. That's what I'm here for. It's the reason we do this
DAVID COULTHARD
San Marino
DAVID Coulthard turned the wheels of his car in the Imola countryside
yesterday taking part in the first of the qualifying sessions for the
San Marino Grand Prix and served notice that he is ready to emerge from
the shadows of Michael Schumacher, Damon Hill, and Nigel Mansell by
claiming his first win. The Scot finished the day as third fastest after
a session which had the spectators, and even the seasoned Formula 1
writers, on their feet throughout.
Earlier in the day during warm-up sessions, Coulthard was first to
break the 1min 30sec barrier and then clocked 1:27.685, a time which
made the expressionless German world champion, Schumacher, raise an
eyebrow.
In the qualifying laps Coulthard again had the fastest lap before his
team-mate, Hill, and then Schumacher pushed themselves to greater
efforts, but Coulthard went back out before the end of the one-hour
qualifying session, and despite a steering problem, he managed 1:27.459
which was 0.185sec behind Schumacher. Gerhard Berger thrilled the crowd
by driving his Ferrari between Schumacher and Coulthard.
Hill finished the afternoon in fourth place, but Coulthard, who was
second in the first Grand Prix of the season in Brazil, appears to be
growing in confidence with every drive, and he said he was confident of
winning his first Grand Prix in his eleventh outing when the real thing
begins tomorrow afternoon.
While there are many around the pit lane who would say they too could
win, with them it is more bravado than anything else. The Scot, however,
drives, looks, and behaves like a champion-in-waiting.
None of the other drivers have gone out of their way to assist him in
any way -- ''Michele Alboreto, I think, was the only one who said
anything, and that was simply welcome to Formula 1,'' Coulthard recalled
which suggests they are wary of the new kid, and with good reason.
Coulthard has driven well over the first two days.
''I had an understeering problem this afternoon and, because of that,
I was more defensive and unable to attack as much as I would have
liked,'' he said. ''My fastest lap was not the cleanest, but it was
close and I think there is more to come from the car.
''I feel very good about this and I see no reason why I can't win on
Sunday. That is what I'm here for. It's the reason I do this.
''I love battling it out wheel to wheel and I want to experience the
feeling of standing on the winner's podium at the end of as many races
as possible and be able to look down on the other drivers and say,
'Today I was the best'.''
There is no arrogance about Coulthard when he talks this way, it is
simply that he loves driving and, for one so young, he a balanced
approach to his job. His fear, if he has any, is kept locked away during
a race, forcing its way out only when he is involved in a spin or
slithers too much on a bend.
''Then I get a feeling in the pit of my stomach, but as soon as I know
I have managed to get away with it I carry on trying to go faster all
the time. It's a weird business I'm in,'' said Coulthard who is charged
with upholding a strong and successful Scottish connection in Formula 1,
even if he is reluctant to be hailed as the successor to Jackie Stewart.
Although he refuses to be pursued by ghosts of the track or carry the
extra weight of memories of the sports real heroes, he does admit to
being extremely patriotic, although his fervour is never manifested
loudly. If you look for it, however, you will find it all around him.
The St Andrew's Cross is displayed on his helmet and there is another,
more subtle one on the side of his car. ''Also, when I first started, I
had the British flag on my overalls and Frank Williams used to kid me
about that,'' Coulthard said.
''Now, the St Andrews Cross is on the suit. I think Frank has a soft
spot for Scotland because he went to school in Dumfries.''
Coulthard then leans in a little closer as though about to impart the
secret of what goes on behind the closed metal doors of the Rothmans
Williams Renault paddock. ''I've also got a rather large St Andrew's
Cross on the balcony of new flat in Monaco,'' he said, ''but it's only
where I can see it.''
The residents of the principality might be just a shade disappointed
in their newcomer if they saw the Scottish flag flapping over the
balcony.
Coulthard is too cultured and respectful of others to be too
self-indulgent, and he suggests that perhaps he would have been better
driving 20 years or so ago. ''I think I would rather have driven 20
years ago, when I think it was a more gentlemanly sport,'' he said.
Nigel Mansell was to be found way back in the distance after
yesterday's qualifying which he finished 2.243 seconds off the pace and
provisionally No. 7 on the grid in his McLaren. He, Schumacher, Hill,
and the Ferrari drivers, Berger and Jean Alesi, took most of the
attention again yesterday. But that doesn't bother Coulthard, who gives
the impression he is waiting for tomorrow, which might just see the
emergence of a new, soft-spoken and cultured champion in an
ostentatious, noisy, adrenalin-charged sport.

MAYBE it's just that being used to having a king on the throne who
talks to the trees makes people more open-minded about unconventional
behaviour and unlikely stories, but if the true story of Princess
Caraboo (rental, cert 15) is anything to go by, then Couch Potato
reckons the late Georgians must have been an incredibly credulous lot.
Picture the scene: you're an exotic-looking female vagrant (a crime in
itself), wandering through the idyllic Devon countryside, and when two
local yokels on a cart discover you you're standing in a field praying
to some unknown god in some unknown language. Normally, what your
average early-nineteenth-century Englishman would do in such
circumstances would be to haul off and hang you on suspicion of being a
Frenchman -- gender could have been no alibi to that charge in the
context of an age that, according to folklore, regularly hanged escaped
monkeys on broadly similar grounds during the Napoleonic Wars.
Instead of which, they offer you a lift, which is the only thing this
story has in common with what would happen if you tried the same sort of
schtick on a couple of Glasgow coppers on a Saturday night. And, by and
by, after surviving the local squire's enthusiasm for throwing you into
the pokey, you find yourself a haven of social superiority with the
local gentry as a shipwrecked Oriental princess, greatly helped by a
local sailor who claims to know your language and explains what you have
to say.
Even a professor of oriental languages brought down from Oxford
proclaims himself baffled but convinced by your line of talk, and
eventually you become quite a celebrity, on nodding terms and better
with the Prince Regent. Unfortunately, a cynical-minded journalist
called Gutch thinks you're a phoney. And you are, of course. Or are you
. . . ?
Such is the storyline of Michael Austin's lavishly filmed and
generally likable costume comedy-romance, starring Phoebe Cates as the
mystery girl of 1817 England. It's a gently witty and always
good-looking rehash of an obscure old story whose entertainment value
for Couch Potato was only slightly diminished by the fact that, as a
connoisseur of tall tales and historical oddities, we knew the obscure
old story already.
If you don't, you'll find surprises in it that we've held back from
our outline of the plot, and, according to taste, you may find its
careful historical background -- bread riots, royal shenanigans, the
whole queasy contrast of England's period of greatest elegance and
greatest poverty -- interesting too. Kevin Kline, Stephen Rea, and Wendy
Hughes fill out the supporting cast in some style, but on the whole it's
one of those mild British films of which the best one can say is quite
nice, dear. All right for a quiet night.
If you want a good laugh, however, we can recommend nothing better
right now than Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (rental, cert 15), which
would have been better titled Kenneth Branagh's Folly.
No harm to ould Ken: he's far from the first star and/or director to
have failed to improve upon James Whale's 1933 Universal classic with
Boris Karloff, but there are some films that just stay made and refuse
all attempts at improvement.
This version, seeking to have the best of both worlds -- the spectacle
and simplicity of the 1933 film and the melancholy, existentialist
second half of Mary Shelley's book --is far from the worst ever made,
but suffers from the fact that, when we watch modern versions of
Frankenstein, we don't extend them the same licence for high-pitched
period melodrama as we do those of the 1930s.
What would have been eerie and exciting in primitive old
black-and-white looks merely self-conscious and unintentionally comic.
Things are not helped by Robert De Niro's look-at-me-mammy-I'm-acting
performance as the Monster, nor by his fanciful make-up, which looks
like Jake La Motta after 15 losing rounds in Raging Bull.

A BIT of boat rocking could liven up the investment trust scene over
the next year or so if Peter Walls, the trusts guru at Credit Lyonnais
Laing, has his way. And investors should benefit.
The broker's latest Investment Trust Yearbook says bluntly that the
sector has something in excess of #3000m of ''dead wood'' which ''will
have difficulty in justifying its place in the investment trust sector
of the future.''
Tantalisingly, he declines to name names, but his advice to management
groups which see themselves as serious players is to look around for
those which could be vulnerable to a takeover bid. He does not point the
finger at the likely predators either, but he does give them a prod with
the comment: ''We are saying the sector has a very bright future indeed,
but there is nothing like a bit of cannibalisation to sort out the men
from the boys and allow the sector to enter the next millenium in a
healthy state of mind.''
He predicts the next 12 to 18 months will see ''the simple hostile
takeover bid whereby an existing trust will offer its own paper in
exchange for the shares of another (not necessarily smaller) trust''.
The remark that a high-performance bidder does not always have to be
larger than its victim highlights the particular importance of
management skills in the investment world.
It would be very difficult for, say, a small engineering company to
mount a successful bid for a much larger rival no matter how brilliant
its management (although behind the scenes institutional pressure might
persuade the big one to buy the small one for its management). However,
the besieged management of an indifferently run investment trust would
be unlikely to be able to put up a credible defence based on well used
slogans such as ''opportunistic asset stripping'' employed in industrial
defences.
The year book also reminds investors that ''we are at a point in time
when wind-up resolutions have a part to play''. A lot of trusts launched
in recent years have sought to discourage deep long-term discounts on
assets by naming dates for possible wind-up. The book lists well over
100 of them, and Mr Walls points out that between now and the end of
1999, ''there are currently 58 potential wind-up situations''. Nine come
this year and 18 next.
The broker says it accepts many of the 58 are unlikely to result in a
winding up, but asks: ''Why not? If a trust has performed poorly or
consistently stood on a large discount then why shouldn't investors get
their money back?''
Mr Walls, who is unhappy about the timing of some of the investment
trust launches, says: ''Shareholders must become more critical in their
treatment of investment trusts. At the very least wind-up votes should
be a time when boards realistically assess the future of the trust. If
the raison d'etre of a trust is out of sync with market sentiment at
that time, then the trust should be re-launched or wound up.''
And he predicts that at least some of those trusts with potential
wind-ups will not continue in their present form. With this in mind, he
comments: ''There will be numerous opportunities over the next three
years for investors to take advantage of anomalous discounts on trusts
that are approaching wind-up votes. Significant out-performance could
thus be achieved as discounts narrow prior to a potential winding up.''
Even if a potential winding up is not yet on the cards, he expects
shareholder discontent with disappointing trusts will become more
audible. ''We would like to see more shareholders realising that it is
their company and that the management and directors are answerable to
them. When this finally happens, we will see disgruntled major
shareholders becoming pro-active in lobbying for changes of management
and/or unitisations.''
So far not much has happened in the way of corporate activity. The
reason, he suggests, is that ''investors, stockbrokers, boards and fund
management groups are generally all too afraid to rock the boat''.
Having done his best to set this process in motion, he tells managers,
fearful for the future of their funds: ''The best defence against
aggression in any form is good performance. Those trusts that have
performed well and have loyal shareholders need not worry. It is only
those trusts that have not met shareholder needs that should be prepared
to tread very carefully in the future.''
And he sees the prospect of ''several trusts either restructuring or
reassessing their investment objectives'' as a means of heading off any
unwanted attention.
Despite the element of boat rocking, the overall message of the year
book is not a gloomy one. He makes the point that the anonymous #3000m
of trusts that he classified as ''dead wood'' only account for about
7.5% to 8% of the sector, and if similar comments were made about an
industrial sector the proportion would probably be higher. ''We are
positive long-term believers in the virtues of investment trusts,'' he
says.
On the good news side he adds that after average dividend rate growth
of 2.5% last year -- against 11% for the FTSE All-Share index: ''The
sector looks set to capitalise upon what we anticipate being another
good year for equity market dividend growth. We expect that dividend
growth for the sector will be in the region of 9% for both 1995 and
1996.''
Turning the crystal ball on to discounts, he predicts a discount
trading range of 4% to 11% over the next 12 months, providing
opportunties for nimble investors.
Still looking for positive news and finding it, he believes the UK
authorities are close to ringing the bell to signal an end to interest
rate rises, and comments: ''Once investors accept that the last UK rate
rise is out of the way, the scene will be set for another leg of a true
bull market.''
Let's hope he's right.

MARTYR or monster? Mary Queen of Scots polarised public opinion in her
lifetime and has continued to do so in the 408 years since her execution
by her Tudor cousin, Elizabeth. The romantic tendency is definitely in
the ascendancy these days, abetted by Lady Antonia Fraser's adulatory
biography. This little paperback volume of Mary's collected poems will
delight her admirers -- and give her harshest critics pause for thought.
For, whatever her faults as monarch or woman, she was an accomplished
and sophisticated turner of words -- in French, needless to say. The
great Ronsard was a tutor, and admirer, of her efforts.
The first notable poem was written by the 17-year-old Mary in 1560 on
the death of her husband, Francis II of France. There is a moving
simplicity about the grief it describes. But it is the sincerity of a
bereft child rather than that of a woman. What a contrast with the dozen
sonnets that Mary, guilt-ridden, sexually obsessed, jealous, poured out
on that most unfortunately chosen of lovers, Bothwell, seven years later
-- though even here the craftswoman of words, the lover of puns,
coexists with the one in torment.
Her self-abasement is complete: ''Entre ses mains et en son plein
pouvoir / Je mets mon fils, mon honneur et ma vie'' (Into his hands and
wholly in his power / I place my son, my honour and my all.) It was all
bound to end in grief, particularly with the spectre of the assassinated
Darnley haunting the pair and the conscience of the nation. In the years
of her self-precipitated English imprisonment, Mary's poetry moved from
the carnal to the spiritual. In the Sonnet Written at Fotheringhay
Castle, 1587, Mary seems to have found again the searing simplicity of
her youth, but this directness is not naive but informed by a lifetime's
pain. ''Que suis-je helas? Et de quoi sert ma vie? / Je ne suis fors
qu'un corps prive de coeur'' (Alas what am I? What use has my life? / I
am but a body whose heart's torn away.)
Robin Bell, who has edited as well as translated the poems, manages
most admirably to retain their essence as well as formal design. Perhaps
in the last lines of this last poem something is lost by not emphasising
the element of sufficient punishment before Mary can have her portion of
eternal bliss (''ma part en la joie infinie'').
Can anyone, incidentally, throw light on a poem -- not included here
-- attributed to Mary (but perhaps by Ronsard) and taught in my Ayrshire
school by a French teacher? The youthful Mary's farewell to France, it
started: ''Adieu, charmant pays de France / que je dois tant cherir /
Berceau de mon heureuse enfance / Adieu, te quitter est mourir.''
For a little paperback, the book is exquisitely illustrated. Not that
the visages of most of the players in the Marian tragedy are appealing.
Bothwell, Burghley, Buchanan, Morton, look as unpleasant a set of
sixteenth-century miscreants as one would care to avoid on a dark night.
Elizabeth is a dolled-up icon. Authentic pictures of Mary show her as a
young girl in a carnation-coloured dress and as the widow in white.
The most flamboyant illustrations are Victorian. Damn authenticity
when they convey such drama. Here is Riccio serenading a dreamy-eyed
queen, Riccio being dispatched, Mary trying to humour a petulant
Darnley, enduring a Knoxian onslaught, and awaiting execution.
* Bittersweet Within My Heart: The Collected Poems of Mary Queen of
Scots, translated and edited by Robin Bell, are published by Pavilion at
#4.99.

THIS week, war widows won a substantial victory in their fight for a
better deal on pensions. From October those who have remarried and lost
their widow's pension can have it restored if their second marriage ends
in death, divorce or separation.
The proposal, which will affect 16,500 pensioners and cost around #40m
a year, first surfaced as a Lords' amendment to the Pensions Bill
earlier this year.
With the VE Day celebrations looming, the Government would have faced
a major politial row if it had held out against the war widows. As it
is, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley was able to claim that the
Government had demonstrated ''this nation's recognition of the debt we
owe to so many''.
However, war widows are not convinced. They say that while they may
have won this battle, there are others to be won and major injustices
still to be righted.
Jenny Green, whose husband, Tornado commander Group Captain William
Green, was killed during preparations for the Gulf War thinks the
Government may be hoping war widows will now stop campaigning.
Their pension provision is complicated and the system is different for
those widowed after 1973, when the Ministry of Defence introduced a
contributory pension scheme for servicemen and women. Those whose
husbands died or were killed before 1973 get a state pension of #76.35 a
week, a Ministry of Defence top-up allowance of #49.77 a week, and an
age addition which starts at #8.70 a week at 65, rising to #16.75 at 75
and #24.95 at 80. This means a widow aged 75 gets a total of #142.87 a
week.
At the moment if they marry again they lose it all forever. After this
week's announcement they can apply to have all these pension payments
restored from October if any subsequent marriage ends or has already
ended.
Widows whose husbands died or were killed after 1973 are treated
slightly differently. They get the state war widow's pension of #76.35 a
week and any age addition. They don't get the MoD allowance; instead
there is a pension from their husband's MoD pension scheme.
Like the pre-1973 widows, they lose all their pensions if they
remarry. Under the new rules they can apply to have the war widow's
pension and age addition restored if any subsequent marriage ends.
However, the restoration of the MoD occupational pension is
discretionary and means tested.
Sandy Ellis is a war widow, originally from Aberdeen. Her husband,
John Leeming, died in the Falklands war. She is one of very few
post-1973 widows to have remarried. ''I lost all my war widow's pensions
when I married again. I had to choose between financial independence and
marriage. Most wives of servicemen are forced to follow their husbands
around the country and they don't get the chance to build a career of
their own.''
Jenny Green explains why post-1973 widows feel so strongly about their
plight: ''The whole system prevents war widows from getting married
again. They have too much to lose financially and they are forced to
give up their financial independence. Many war widows are still young
when their husbands are killed and these rules are preventing them
making a new life with a new partner. Our research shows that fewer than
one in a hundred of these war widows choose to marry again.''
War widows' organisations think the MoD occupational pension scheme
should provide a pension for life. Ms Green says: ''Most occupational
schemes don't cut off widows' pensions when they remarry. I don't see
why a serviceman who has contributed to the scheme and who has
sacrificed his life for his country should be treated any differently
from someone working in industry.''
The Government compares the MoD scheme to that at the civil service,
which also cuts widows' pensions when they remarry. According to Ms
Green they have been told that of 60 public sector schemes, only 21%
offer benefits for life. ''I am not sure this research isn't out of
date. After privatisation, I find it hard to believe there are 60 public
sector schemes left.
''The Bett committee enquiry into sevice pay and conditions recently
recommended that the MoD occupational pension should give benefits for
life, so we are not asking for the impossible.''

IVORY &amp; Sime's flagship, British Assets Trust, yesterday proclaimed
that its radical reconstruction -- which followed three years of poor
performances -- was on track.
In the six months to March 31, consolidating the results of 65%-owned
subsidiary Investors Capital Trust, net asset value fell 0.9% to
101.10p. This compared with a 1.83% rise in the benchmark All-Share
index.
Taking the #591m British Assets Trust on its own, net asset value
declined 2.8% to 96.11p. A negative total return of 0.5% compared with a
positive figure of 3.6% on the All-Share.
British Assets announced a second quarterly dividend of 1.095p -- the
same as its first interim payout.
It was confident that Ordinary shareholders, who received a total
payout of 4.38p last time, would be rewarded with real growth in income
for the current financial year.
British Assets itself was hurt during the period by a widening of the
discount between the share price and net asset value of the domestic
Investors Capital.
The strength of sterling relative to the greenback impacted on British
Assets' dollar-related investments. Restructuring costs, which are being
written off against capital, had a lesser impact.
Non-dividend growth shares, mainly held by institutional investors,
have replaced some of British Assets' Ordinary shares.
This has allowed the trust to dramatically reduce the yield on its
portfolio and switch to investments offering better capital growth
potential.
Gradually, British Assets intends to reduce its holding in Investors
Capital to zero by 2001.
The basis of valuation of British Assets' investment in Investors
Capital has been changed to market price from net asset value.
British Assets yesterday stressed it was in no hurry to sell Investors
Capital and that price considerations would be important.
The investment trust gained the necessary approval for a controversial
change of its capital struture in December. It now aims for a greater
total return than that on the All-Share.
Ivory &amp; Sime's business development director, Gordon Neilly, said
British Assets' performance had improved dramatically during the last 12
months.

THE tenor of the Office of Fair Trading's long-awaited report on
mortgages supports the belief among commentators that repayment
mortgages are cheaper and safer for most people than endowment
mortgages.
However, this does not mean that existing holders of endowment
mortgages should be panicked into ditching them and opting for the
straight repayment method. The cost of surrendering most policies would
outweigh any gain there might be from switching to repayment.
The only exception to this might be where a high value could be
obtained from selling the endowment to one of the specialist purchasers
of with-profits policies.
The OFT reckons that even on a worst case most borrowers with a
#50,000 endowment loan lasting until maturity would only be some #3000
worse off at the end of the day, which would represent a very small
percentage of the overall cost of the mortgage.
The extra cost would be greater had the borrower on moving house been
persuaded to take out a new policy and scrap the old, an infamous
practice known as ''churning'' in the trade.
The report echoes the advice that observers have been giving for some
time, that endowment mortgages are considerably less attractive than
they were because of the reduction in tax relief on mortgage interest
and lower investment returns, which reflect lower inflation.
The OFT plans to publish a consumer booklet setting out the pros and
cons which every prospective homebuyer should read. This will contain a
number of conclusions and they point the way towards the repayment
method being more suitable for most people.
If the endowment policy is surrendered early the great majority will
be more costly than repayment loans. If it goes to maturity -- and only
about 30% do -- policies with high charges are still likely to be more
costly. Only policies with very low charges would show advantages on
most scenarios.
The best strategy on moving house is to increase the policy or take
out an additional one, or opt for the repayment method to cover the
increase in the mortgage.
Sensibly, Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Fair Trading,
suggests that repayment mortgages are safer for those for whom the cost
of buying their home takes up a large slice of their disposable income.
Those of greater means can take the higher risk/reward ratio of taking
out an endowment mortgage, though the policy must have low charges.
However, personal preference has to come into it. Some people may want
to reduce their debt as fast as possible, in which case a repayment loan
is better. Others may have a low income now but are on a fast-track
career and so may prefer an endowment.
The industry would also say that an endowment makes more sense for
people likely to move often because in the early years of a repayment
loan little is actually paid off. However, in a low-inflation world such
people would be better off renting.
Buying a house is the largest transaction most people do in their
lifetime and it pays to do some research into understanding the various
types of mortgage and how they work. Then they will not be bamboozled by
salesmen.
Fortunately the bad old days when even major lenders were guilty of
churning in order the reap the commission paid by life companies is
over. And customers can see for themselves how much of their money will
be swallowed up by commission and other expenses now that these have to
be published, and most lenders allow a variety of repayment methods.
This is where shopping around comes in.
However, it is naive to pretend that a salesmen or adviser will
suggest a repayment mortgage when he will derive no commission from this
and it is disturbing that 60% of new mortgages are still of the
endowment type.
The key test is whether the investment return will exceed the interest
rate on the loan plus the policy expenses. Twenty-five-year policies
maturing now have done this but 10-year policies generally haven't
because investment returns have been less. This does suggest that the
more flexible repayment option is now the best bet for most people,
particularly as mortgage interest tax relief is being scaled back,
thereby increasing the effective interest rate.
With-profits endowments have their place as a low-risk method of
long-term saving but not as a means to repay mortgages. The new PEP
mortgages may give a higher (though riskier) return than endowments but
PEPs are still also best regarded as straight savings plans.

SURSUM CORDA! THE COLLECTED LETTERS OF MALCOLM LOWRY, Volume One:
1926-46
Edited by Sherill E Grace
Jonathan Cape, #35
LIFE and fiction merged in the career of Malcolm Lowry, and nowhere
more clearly than in his turbulent masterpiece Under the Volcano. The
book evolved, over many years of constant revision and refining, from
Lowry's traumatic experiences in Mexico in the late 1930s, when he was
often drunk, sometimes in jail, and his short-lived first marriage was
on the point of dissolution.
Both the horrors and the exhilarations of this episode find their way
into the novel, the story of one day -- the last -- in the life of a
former British diplomat gone to seed, told with dizzying, imaginative
power and verbal richness. Many of these letters chronicle the painful
genesis of the book and illuminate its inspiration.
Plain matter of fact had only a small place in Lowry's imaginative
world, and no doubt that is what makes his letters so readable. You envy
those who received them, except that deciphering some of them must have
been a trial, his handwriting being ''half crabbed, half generous, and
wholly drunken . . . the words themselves slanting steeply downhill,
though the individual characters seemed, as if resisting the descent,
braced, climbing the other way''.
In fact, that quotation, lifted from Under the Volcano, refers to the
consul's hand. But, as Sherill Grace points out in her admirable
introduction, it could well describe the author's. Facsimiles show a
tiny, tightly-packed script that starts off orderly enough and then
succumbs in a welter of additions, insertions, notes, comments, all
wheeling and darting about the central text. The form seems a perfect
image of the context, for Lowry could hardly contain himself on the
page; the ideas tumble out, head over heels, jostling for ever richer
expression.
Lowry's letters remain a puzzle in spite of Grace's diligent
searching. How near were the pencilled notes, often all that remains, to
the final form? Even when apparently finished versions, were they ever
sent?
Grace speculates over the validity of letters in Lowry's fiction,
notably the consul's despairing plea to the wife who has left him. Was
this a version of something Lowry wrote to his own first wife Jan
Gabrial, who had left him in Mexico in similar circumstances? It is not
a wildly fanciful concept, considering Lowry's habit of recycling
material, both his own and other people's.
Some of the letters have appeared before in various selections, but
this edition is both much more comprehensive and meticulously edited.
Even so, it is not complete, in particular lacking a significant number
of extant letters which Jan Gabrial has withheld. Grace regrets the
letters that got away, yet it seems all of a piece with Lowry's short,
chaotic life that the collection is not and can never be complete.
Lowry had an extraordinary life. Born into a well-to-do English
family, he went to sea for a year on leaving Cambridge, took to drink,
seems to have been chronically short of money (in spite of an allowance
from a conscientious father), and survived lurid escapades in Mexico. In
the 1940s the home he shared with his second wife, Margerie, was a
timber fisherman's shack in British Columbia. When fire destroyed the
first, along with precious manuscripts, he built another with his own
hands. And at last, back in England with Under the Volcano in print and
more books on the way, he took his life before he reached 50.
So many troubles, and yet the charm, ebullience, and good nature of
the man shine through along with his fierce intelligence. Letters give
the reader leave to eavesdrop on a life. You look over the writer's
shoulder, and in Lowry's case you might want to put your arm round his
shoulder, too.
One reservation: ''The letters speak for themselves,'' says Grace,
before hedging them thickly with notes and exegesis. Does Jack and the
Beanstalk need explanation? The scholarly apparatus, the length (nearly
700 pages, with volume 2 still to come) and the price may well deter the
general reader. That would be a pity. Persevere. Sursum corda! (lift up
your hearts).

RICHARD Corsie stayed on course for a place in tomorrow's semi-finals
in the Mazda International Jack High event in Sydney when he defeated
Norfolk Island's Carmen Anderson in straight sets.
The Scot won 9-2, 9-4 after 14 ends and goes into his concluding group
match today against South Africa's Neil Burkett requiring to win just
one set to assure himself of a place in the last four.
Burkett completed his section games with a defeat, beaten in three
sets by Cameron Curtis.
Ian Schuback, winner of the world indoor pairs title playing alongside
Curtis last year, also is assured of a semi-final spot, against
countryman Steve Glasson.
Title-holder Andy Thomson, who was without a win until yesterday,
broke his duck with a 3-9, 9-5, 9-6 win over Glasson and if he can
defeat Ireland's Ian McClure, it is possible that Thomson could scrape
through. Results:
Group A -- I Schuback (Australia) beat D Shaw (Australia) 9-0, 3-9,
9-1; A Thomson (England) beat S Glasson (Australia) 3-9, 9-5, 9-6; I
McClure (Ireland) beat Shaw 9-8, 9-3.
Group B -- C Curtis (Australia) beat R Johnston (Australia) 9-5, 9-2;
R Corsie (Scotland) beat C Anderson (Norfolk Island) 9-2, 9-4; Curtis
beat N Burkett (South Africa) 4-9, 9-1, 9-6.
* SCOTLAND'S makeshift four strengthened their position at the top of
the Atlantic Rim fours championshp league table at Durban yesterday. Liz
Dickson, Eleanor Allan, Betty Forsyth, and Frances Whyte have won seven
of their eight rounds, but their successes against Argentina and Spain
still left them only one point ahead of South Africa and England with
only three rounds left to play.
Scotland's double came as a relief. Argentina were dealt with
comfortably, but Spain were a different matter. They led 9-8 after 10
ends, but the Scots hit back with a 3 and a 5 to lead 16-9, but Spain
narrowed the gap to just one shot over the next three ends, before the
Scots stamped their authority over the last six to win 26-16.

SCOTLAND AND IRELAND IN THE AGE OF REVOLUTION
Elaine McFarland
Edinburgh University Press, #35
SCOTTISH Ministers, it seems, have always had a way with protesters.
In 1793, the Lord Advocate, Robert Dundas, was challenged to a duel by
Archibald Hamilton Rowan, an Irishman visiting Edinburgh to lend a hand
in the democratic agitation of the time, and especially to visit the
Scottish reformer, Thomas Muir, in jail. Rather than reach for the
nearest pickaxe, Dundas had Rowan arrested while he was sitting in
Muir's cell, though he was released on bond. Sensibly, Rowan left
straight for Dublin.
Contacts between Scotland and Ireland have always been close and
lively. They reached a particular pitch, and took a particular turn, at
the end of the eighteenth century. Elaine McFarland's study presents
this as critical for both nations.
In Ireland, fast-moving events culminated in the rising and French
invasion of 1798, out of which the development of modern nationalists
accelerated. In Scotland, the received interpretation has been that the
period saw a ''political awakening of the people from their previous
deference, indifference, and torpor. Henceforth, they advanced with a
bright and dauntless eye towards modern democracy.''
The author starts off from the admission that such a simple view is no
longer tenable. Scotland after 1745 may not have been as quiet as we
thought, yet even those historians who hear most clearly a background
rumble of discontent must for this reason concede that it was not
changing much through time.
It cannot be argued that the Scottish people then moved into a new and
higher stage of political consciousness. What was new was the appearance
of bourgeois dissent, generally moderate but with some hot-headed
elements. The questions whether and how it was linked to the feelings of
the mob remain in dispute.
Still, McFarland sets out to save the received interpretation in the
sense of recasting it on a wider and more convincing basis. The original
impetus to political change arises from nothing less than the
Enlightenment itself, especially as represented in the liberal views of
Francis Hutcheson, the Ulsterman who became professor of moral
philosophy at Glasgow University and taught Adam Smith.
The condition of Ireland allowed those views to spread fast,
especially in his own Presbyterian community. But not only there; by the
end of the century a broad movement might embrace everyone from an
aristocrat to wretched Roman Catholic peasants.
What could they teach the Scots, a nation neither so divided nor so
oppressed? To the bourgeois reformers they gave example and
encouragement, as Rowan did to Muir. To the people they revealed new
methods of conducting politics, for which there had been neither
occasion nor opportunity in the close Scottish system.
The methods, though defeated at the first assay, proved useful and
durable. In particular, the ''oath-bound secrecy'' copied straight off
the Irish allowed Scots workers to organise for the first time. All this
came into its own after 1815, when reformers could no longer be
pilloried by the Government as lackeys of the revolutionary French, and
united a broad popular movement behind them.
The great virtue of this book is its painstaking analysis of the
process of diffusion. Less satisfactory is the evaluation. The author
concedes that Scotland was, in the 1790s, a far more united society than
Ireland, with a ruling class at once stronger and more intimately
connected to the life of the people. To my mind, this offers a better
explanation of the reformers' failure than the small doses of
repression, exaggerated by later Whig historians in accounts that
McFarland usually, despite a cautionary word or two, accepts at face
value.
We have, in the end, merely a variant on an exploded Whig
interpretation of Scottish history if we set out the Irish model as
progressive and see Scotland as deficient in not following it.

ALL THE SWEETS OF BEING: A LIFE OF JAMES BOSWELL
Roger Hutchinson
Mainstream, #17.50
ON the evidence of his Life of Johnson (1791), Boswell was long
regarded as a Scottish lawyer whose literary judgment made him the
greatest of all English biographers. Yet Boswell was even better as an
autobiographer: Yale University's 13-volume Trade Edition of his private
papers, completed in 1989, told the twentieth century the naked truth
about bawdy, boozy Bozzy.
Life of Johnson presented the public with a Boswell who identified
with a subject supposedly driven by his ruling passion of piety, ''his
piety being constant''. The biography ends with a vindication of
Johnson's virtues, so readers assumed Boswell was also an honourable
man. Boswell's journals show a man driven by the ruling passion of
prurience, a man more interested in vice than virtue. Boswell invaded
his own privacy by agonising over his lust for women of the night and
his love for drinks of the day.
A Calvinist who briefly converted to Catholicism at the age of 18,
Boswell was nothing if not confessional as he struggled to save his soul
from his body's appetite for wine, women, and wrong. Fortunately for the
rest of us, he was a journalist of genius, writing brilliantly about his
dark nights of the soul and his days of trial and trauma.
Sunday, October 29, 1780, was Boswell's fortieth birthday and he
celebrated by going twice to church in Edinburgh. A few weeks later he
summed up his life so far: ''How insignificant is my life at present!
How little do I read! I am making no considerable figure in any way, and
I am now 40 years of age.''
By 1780, Boswell had befriended Johnson, met Rousseau and Voltaire,
married Margaret Montgomerie, practised as an advocate in Edinburgh,
published several works including An Account of Corsica (1768). Still,
he felt he was a failure. He was a manic depressive or, in the
terminology of the time, a hypochondriac -- he contributed a column to
the London Magazine as ''The Hypochondriack''.
He was also a hypocrite. In his 1780 summary of his life so far he
claimed: ''I am very well at the Bar for my standing. I lead a regular,
sober life.'' Not so. The night before his birthday he ''drank hock and
claret with pleasure''. The day after his birthday he ''toyed with a
young lady'', and the day after that he ''drank too much, so as to be in
some degree intoxicated''. Boswell is an easy man to attack.
Roger Hutchinson comes to the defence of Boswell in a brief life he
considers only an ''extended essay''. He honours Boswell as ''an honest
mortal'', an odd assessment of the immortal Bozzy going about his
careerist business. On first meeting his master in 1763, Boswell kept
quiet about his Scottish origins and, when he was outed as a Scot,
apologised: ''Indeed I come from Scotland, but I cannot help it'', hence
Johnson's celebrated reply: ''That, I find, is what a very great many of
your countrymen cannot help.'' By contrast, knowing Rousseau was a
Scotophile, in 1764 Boswell sent the philosopher a letter of
introduction beginning: ''I am a Scots gentleman of ancient family.''
Hutchinson claims ''alcohol never held full dominion over James
Boswell'', but the journals are dominated by Bozzy's boozing. On March
29, 1776 (this seven years after his marriage), Boswell described a
typical evening in London -- ''I madly drank a bottle of claret by
myself . . . and this, meeting what I had taken at dinner, made me
brutally feverish''.
The morning after he went to a tavern to taste a tart. The morning
after that Boswell ''drank hard'' and ''went away much in liquor'' to
find ''a wholesome-looking, bouncing wench'' to help him sleep it off.
During this bawdy, boozy bout, Bozzy told himself his devotion to
debauchery did not interfere with his devotion to his long-suffering
wife. Margaret died of consumption at Auchinleck in 1789, Boswell
continued to consume copious amounts of alcohol until his death in 1795.
You need not agree with Hutchinson to appreciate his book. I
especially enjoyed the chapter on the Corsican Boswell -- ''James
Boswell, gentleman spy, shady diplomat, blade on the loose, homme
mysterieux''. Boswell championed the cause of the patriot Pasquale Paoli
and for this is remembered by Corsicans in a plaque praising a ''British
writer and friend of Corsica''. Inspired by the Corsican episode,
Hutchinson salutes Boswell's qualities of courage and idealism. In
Corsica, Boswell had the courage of his convictions about justice. In
Corsica he was a lover of liberty. Away from Corsica he was a lover and
a libertine.
On returning to Edinburgh from Corsica, in 1766, Boswell re-created
his character. He began to drink heavily for the first time in his life.
He embarked on sexual adventures that threatened his mental and physical
health. He decided, for his sins, to consider Margaret Montgomerie as a
suitable partner who could help him concentrate on a legal career. He
wrote An Account of Corsica, hoping to make a good impression as an
author.
When the book was published, David Hume and Johnson were suitably
impressed, although Horace Walpole, who received a complimentary copy
from Boswell, warned his friend Thomas Gray: ''The author, Boswell, is a
strange being (who) has a rage for knowing anybody that was ever talked
of.'' Hutchinson rejoices in Boswell's strange being: ''Take him, bright
eyed, plumply gauche and plucking urgently at your arm, or leave him.''
Hutchinson loves him too much to leave him.
Hutchinson's biography blames the sins of a period for the
peccadilloes of a person: Bozzy, as an individual, is seen as an
innocent at large in a loutish world. I am not convinced by the case
Hutchinson makes for Bozzy's honest character, but take my wig off to
the eloquent way he presents it.

ERIC Cantona signed a new three-year deal with Manchester United
yesterday and said: ''I hope to spend the rest of my career here.'' The
controversial French star believes he can handle the flying boots and
terrace taunts next season when his worldwide ban ends on September 30.
United chairman Martin Edwards ended months of speculation by
announcing the player had signed a new contract, which retains his
services until June 1998.
The news came as a massive blow for Inter Milan, who were waiting in
the wings with a #5.5m bid if he had decided to quit England.
Cantona said: ''I have never thought about leaving Manchester United,
but maybe some people thought so. We are bigger than the people who have
been so hard and so wrong sometimes.
''I am very pleased to get the opportunity of another three years at
the club and to continue winning trophies.''
''I have found it a compliment when so many people have said good
things about me.'' Cantona is currently doing community service -- as
well as being banned from the game worldwide -- after his infamous
kung-fu kick on a Crystal Palace fan.
Asked whether he could handle further provocation Cantona, dressed
casually in jacket, jeans and tee-shirt, smiled and said: ''Easy.''
Manager Alex Ferguson is convinced Cantona's dark days are behind him
and that he is a changed man.
Ferguson said: ''It is not going to be easy for him with the
provocation he could get.
''Nobody in the history of football has been punished as hard as Eric.
But he has never said a word about it or complained. He has been
tremendous and has handled the situation so well.''
Inter Milan officials reacted bitterly to Cantona's decision, claiming
they had been misled by his representatives.

PROVISION for major refurbishment of the exterior of Jenners
department store in Edinburgh saw pre-tax profits fall by nearly
two-thirds to #1.39m in the year to end-January, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The accounts contain a one-off charge of #2.17m for the external work
-- #110,000 of which relates to money already spent. This accounts for
the vast bulk of the fall in profits from #3.85m.
Turnover at the prominent Princes Street store, however, rose 5% to
#40.6m.
In spite of the profits setback, Jenners increased its total dividend
by 8% to 71.5p, after a final payout of 37.5p.
Jenners has had a varied corporate career, dating back to 1924 and
alternating between public and private status.
The capital structure and voting control, quite properly in a private
company, is tightly secured among founding family interests.

THE UK construction industry is not enjoying the fruits of economic
recovery that would normally be expected at this point in the cycle.
The Government's road-building programme has been scaled back, the
housing market remains sluggish and there are still too many companies
chasing too little business which means that margins remain under
intense pressure.
Against this background it is perhaps not surprising that construction
group Costain reported a deteriorating trading position last year.
In 1994 it made a pre-tax loss of #180.4m compared with a profit of
#67.1m previously. The loss was made after an exceptional writedown of
#103m relating to the group's remaining US mining operations.
The company warned last month that the provision would be made in the
absence of any acceptable offers for the business. Although the US
coal-mining business benefited from investment Costain is still cautious
on its prospects and said that an improvement in results from this
business will be a key factor in deciding its future within the group.
City analysts expect the business to make a loss in 1995.
Turnover was down 5% to #974.2m. The loss per share was 36p against
previous earnings per share of 18.8p. Disposals helped Costain to reduce
some of its large debt pile and further asset sales should benefit the
balance sheet in the current financial year.
The interest bill for 1994 was more than halved to #11.3m.
Its net assets have fallen to a level where it must call an
extraordinary general meeting to consider a restructuring of its share
capital, including a share consolidation and resolutions to facilitate
the future payment of dividends. It has not paid a dividend since 1991.
Shareholders' funds dropped by #125m to #100m.
Market conditions in construction and engineering are said to remain
extremely difficult but a widening contract from the Government for the
M5 close to Bristol has boosted order books. Reorganisation has made its
engineering and construction business more focused which it believes
could produce improved results. In addition there are also said to be
several good opportunities overseas, particularly in marine civil
engineering.
The company, which has been the subject of intense bid speculation,
said that it recognised that rationalisation in the construction
industry was overdue and was prepared to consider approaches which might
benefit the business. But it added that its clear priority was ''to
deliver an improvement in performance which preserves the option of
continued independence''.
Costain shares have derived some periodic support from bid speculation
with Hanson mentioned as a possible suitor. However, the annual results
were worse than the City had expected and yesterday the shares dropped
1[1/4]p to 12[1/2]p compared with a year-high of 25p.

GRAMPIAN TV chalked up a 15.7% increase in pre-tax profits for the
financial year to February 28, despite heavier-than-planned start-up
costs at its new radio station Scot FM.
The Aberdeen-based media group said group pre-tax profits rose for the
seventh straight year to #4.4m from #3.8m in 1993.
But they were dented by a #425,000 post-tax loss on Grampian's 58%
stake in Edinburgh-based Scot FM, which began broadcasting in September.
The directors recommended a final dividend of 7p per share, making a
total of 9p for the year, up from 7.5p previously.
Grampian attributed its growth in profits to a 4% increase in
advertising during the financial year and a good performance by its real
estate subsidiary Glenburnie Properties.
Group turnover rose to #21.3m from #20.5m in 1993.
Grampian spokesman Mike McLintock said advertising revenue had risen
despite the disruption caused by a transfer of the Grampian TV's
advertising business to sales house TSMS from Time Exchange in the last
quarter of 1994.
Advertising revenue improved sharply at the start of 1995 and this
gave income for the full financial year a last-minute boost, he added.
Tom Hunter, managing director of Scot FM, which covers most of central
Scotland, said the original estimates of start-up costs for the radio
station had proved ''unrealistic.''
Speech programmes had proved particularly expensive, he noted.
But Mr Hunter said the radio station, with studios in Leith and
Glasgow, had cost ''well under #1m'' to launch and was on course to make
a profit in its first full year of operation ending on February 28 1996.
''The station has cost more to put on air than we originally imagined
but there is a big prize to be gained,'' he said, referring to its
potential audience of nearly 2.8 million people.
Mr Hunter said audience figures for the first quarter of this year,
due to be published on Tuesday, would show ''a quite remarkable
improvement'' on the previous set.
Richard Andrews, an analyst with Edinburgh stockbroker Bell Lawrie
White, said Scot FM had gone through a painful birth and high early
lossess were to be expected.
''It had a very difficult start and a heavy turnover of personnel in
the first three months . . . but it seems things have picked up a bit
since then,'' Mr Andrews said.
Mr Andrews described the Scot FM losses revealed by Grampian's results
as ''a little higher than expected''.
When Grampian first bid for Scot FM's radio licence in 1993 it
projected pre-launch start-up costs of #291,000 and a first-year loss of
#156,000 -- a total of #357,000.
But Grampian's results show the radio station lost twice this sum
during its first six months of operation -- about #737,000.
The high start-up costs of Scot FM failed to cloud the overall
improvement in Grampian's finances and the group's shares closed up 16p
at 290p.
Scot FM's other main shareholder is Carlisle-based Border Television,
which has a 35% stake.

AIRDRIE keeper John Martin, who will celebrate 15 years with the club
this weekend,
has set his sights on a double this season by helping Airdrie into the
premier division and back into Europe with only the club's second
Scottish Cup triumph.
And Martin hopes his side will take another step towards promotion in
the clash with Dunfermline at East End Park this afternoon.
Airdrie manager Alex MacDonald, whose side is just four points off the
top, said: ''We have played Dunfermline three times this season and
drawn the lot, but one point is no use to us now -- we must win.''
Dunfermline captain Norrie McCathie, who was forced to watch Airdrie
dash his club's hopes of promotion at this time last year, believes the
shoe will be on the other foot tomorrow.
''Alex MacDonald can say what he likes,'' he said, ''but I guarantee
every Airdrie player will have the cup final on his mind. He will know a
yellow card or injury could prevent him playing in the final, and I
believe that will give us an edge.''
Marc Millar, injured in a recent car accident, is out and will be
replaced in the Dunfermline side by Ivo Den Bieman.
Third-placed Dundee, who will be without Kevin Bain and Dusan Vrto,
will head for St Mirren, and while promotion is on the minds of the Dens
Park side, the wish to avoid relegation will be taking up the attention
of Saints.
Raith Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl has never varied from the wish that
his side play skilful football, but even he has had to admit in the
final weeks of the season that results are all important. The league
leaders will have that attitude against St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park.
Ayr United, battling against the drop, will have player-manager Simon
Stainrod leading by example at Hamilton, while Clydebank travel to
Stranraer.
Tom Currie comes in with both Sean Sweeney and Derek Crawford
suspended, while Stranraer could have striker Billy Ferguson back after
a 17 weeks absence following an operation.

SCOTTISH-registered engineering firm James Dickie has announced a #4m
deal to buy auto parts manufacturer Belcot Holdings, a move that will
reduce its present dependence on producing parts for Caterpillar.
James Dickie is registered in Glasgow and manufactures components for
commercial vehicles at two plants in the English Midlands.
The firm will pay Belcot's present owners #1.7m in James Dickie
shares, but #700,000 of the payment is dependent on Belcot reaching a
1995 pre-tax profit target of #475,000.
James Dickie, which currently sells about half its total production to
Caterpillar, said it would also raise #1.9m of working capital through a
share placement with seven institutions. Its shares closed up 13p at
230p.

ALTHOUGH Huntly need only one goal at home against Fort William today
to reach the 100 mark in 30 league games this season, assistant manager
Willie Lawson has urged his side to net five to beat the 103 notched by
Elgin City three seasons.
''We would like to see that record surpassed,'' said Lawson, ''because
it hasn't been matched for something like 25 years. With respect to Fort
William, five goals are not outwith our capabilities.''
Despite the scoring target, Marco De Barros may find his thoughts
drifting south. The 22-year-old is set for a trial with Motherwell next
weekend, and another with Grimsby Town the following week.
Elsewhere, Clach, who shocked Huntly in a 3-3 draw last weekend, will
be without Stuart Mackay against second place Cove Rangers.
The Edinburgh-based student heads back to Bramall Lane after having
impressed Sheffield United manager Dave Bassett in a trial, and will
line up in midfield for the Blades' second string.
Brora Rangers, still vying for second place with a game in hand, are
without striker Ian MacDougall and suspended Jimmy Anderson. They will
also check on midfield doubtfuls Gary Morton and Gordon Robertson before
they travel to off-form Lossiemouth.

THEY have had many momentous days in their recent history, but nothing
quite like today's scenario has been Aberdeen's lot. If they fail to
beat Hearts at Tynecastle and two other sides, Dundee United and Partick
Thistle, win, the Pittodrie club will be relegated for the first time.
Not many people would have envisaged such a situation when this season
started but as poor result followed poor result, the manager Willie
Miller, perhaps inevitably, lost his job, and the slide down the chute
continued, despite a couple of inspired performances under caretaker
boss Roy Aitken, it became clear that the unthinkable was thinkable.
Now demotion beckons and with it the financial problems -- something
in the region of #4m loss as a result of playing in the first division
and the likelihood that the proposed share launch would have to be
shelved -- the departure of players and the requirement to dust
themselves down and start all over again, unless they can extricate
themselves from the most desperate of situations at the bottom of the
premier division.
As their fortunes have dipped so, too, have those of their most
exciting young player, Eoin Jess, who has lost his place in the team and
also his international recognition, but maybe the moment has arrived for
the striker to prove the man of the hour.
Aitken brings him back into the spotlight against Hearts with the
reasoning as follows: ''We need that little spark of inspiration to get
a result and I see Jess as the man to provide it. He has a major role to
play.
''He has had to prove himself, but he has been pushing himself hard
and playing well in recent reserve games. I have been happy with his
overall performances.
''It is a challenge for him, but having spoken to him, he is very
positive that he can deliver.''
Aberdeen have a couple of injuries and have not named their squad, but
keeper Theo Snelders is not considered quite fit enough to return.
Aitken added: ''This is such a vital game that I cannot afford to play
anyone who is less than 100% fit. The injuries are a worry we could do
without, but there is still enough quality in the squad to see us
through.
''It is understandable that we have been written off. We must rely on
events elswhere to work in our favour, and we have been the most
inconsistent team in the league, but I believe we are still very much in
the race to escape relegation.''
Hearts striker John Robertson has a difficult decision to make. He
will make up his own mind whether or not he should play with his broken
arm strapped up after taking part for one half of a reserve game with it
protected.
Hearts will give fitness tests to John Millar and Fraser Wishart, but
it may be a bit early yet for Dave McPherson to come back.
Three prominent Dundee United players will begin a tortuous watching
brief today as they fulfil their supsensions for the rest of the season.
Brian Welsh, Billy McKinlay and Dave Bowman will be suffering in the
Tannadice stand as United take on Hibs in a match crucial to their
survival hopes.
The team captain, Maurice Malpas, knows how they will feel. Malpas,
who was banned for the last home game against Kilmarnock, said: ''That
was easily the longest day of my life, and I know the three of them are
going to really suffer tomorrow.''
Manager Billy Kirkwood adds Robbie Winters, Grant Johnson, Jerren
Nixon and Brazilian striker Sergio to the squad to cover for the
suspensions.
Hibs, still chasing the second place spot, will have skipper Gordon
Hunter back, but Darren Jackson is suspended for the rest of the season.
Partick Thistle, who need one more big push to complete the escape of
the year, will have a hard job at Kilmarnock, but they are used to tough
assignments. They will be without five players, three of whom, Wayne
Foster, Rod McDonald and Greg Watson, are suspended, and two, Tommy
Turner and Derek McWilliams, injured.

IT had not been a good day for Peter Nicol. After 24 unbeaten squash
appearances for Scotland in more than three years, he had finally
surrendered his perfect record, losing to a Finn in the opening round of
the European team championship in Amsterdam. Then he watched Stephen
Hendry's snooker maximum.
''Brilliant,'' enthused Inverurie's Nicol, world No.5 in his sport.
''What does he get for that?''
''#147,000? And he's in line for a Ferrari?''
Cue sharp intake of breath.
The rewards in Nicol's sport are more prosaic. Though he is the only
man to have eliminated the world No.1, Jansher Khan, from a Professional
Squash Association event for more than a year, and this month beat the
Pakistani again, Nicol's most tangible asset is a recently-purchased
flat, in Chingford.
''I've also landed a sponsored car, a VW Golf. No, not a GTi, nothing
flashy. But it is a big deal for me. I no longer have to run my own car.
I was paying #2000 a year just to insure my wee Metro -- and that was
with a 35% no-claims bonus.''
Lean pickings indeed from a game so brutal that Sir Noel Coward once
described it as flagellation, not exercise.
But the Scot, 22 this month, admits to no regrets in passing up the
other sporting careers which he might have pursued, or the chance of
university into which he could comfortably have walked on the strength
of five Higher passes in his fifth year at Inverurie Academy.
''I love the life and I love the game,'' he says, ''though I'm not
nuts about the travel. The money's not that important. I count myself
really lucky that I don't have to get up and go out to work in the
mornings.''
And the other sports?
''Badminton was my first love, followed by tennis,'' he said. He
played with his mum, dad, and sister, but when squash became available
at the tennis club, all other games became secondary.
''The main attraction was its accessibility,'' says his father, Pat,
head PE teacher at Alford Academy. ''You can play squash 365 days a
year, but tennis for only about two-and-a-half months in Inverurie -- no
indoor courts.
''Peter was eight when he started squash. I began at the same time.
I'd never been on a court in my life, and didn't even know the rules.''
Yet he coached his son up to the age of 17, funded him when he opted
for a squash apprenticeship rather than university, and has made his own
impact on the sport, managing the Scottish team this week in Holland.
''Peter could have gone in a number of directions, sport wise,'' says
his father. ''He was an excellent tennis player, and was offered terms
by Aberdeen Football Club -- he played in midfield. He was off 11 at
golf before he went south, and on his debut for Inverurie second XI,
scored 113 runs.''
Pat played junior football for Scotland in the early sixties, and
turned out as a semi-professional for Peterhead and Keith in the
Highland League, as well as batting at No.3, ''and bowling medium fast
rubbish'' for Aberdeenshire.
Peter gladly acknowledges how much he owes to parental influences. The
death of his mother, Sigrid, was a devastating blow which seemed to
threaten his form. He had one bad tournament, then buried himself in a
frenzy of furious training. ''Afterwards I was run down. I felt tired
all season.''
But thereafter he leapt 200 world-ranking places in 18 months, and
when the new rankings are announced, on Monday, he is likely to be
fourth, the highest placing by a Scotsman.
He has recently seen off Khan for the second time, and remains the
only man to have beaten him in a PSA event for more than 14 months. He
also has logged five victories in six meetings against world No.2, Brett
Martin.
Nicol's left-handed, double-handed style raises occasional doubts, but
his mentor, Neil Harvey, the former England No.1, remains convinced the
Scot can go all the way.
He has steered him up the rankings with a brutal regime. Off court,
Nicol faces sessions which would do justice to a quality endurance
athlete: 8 x 800 metres in under two-and-a-half minutes with a
two-minute recovery, or 8 x 400m, then onto the court.
There Harvey elbows him, obstructs his vision, even fouls him. He
calls lets when they do not occur, and simulates the referee shouting
the wrong score, in the belief that such mental conditioning will raise
his psychological skills to match his physical ones. Even among squash
players, he is regarded as exceptionally athletic.
Nicol is confident that one day he will be world No.1, ''otherwise I
would stop playing . . . Hopefully, I will be able to get out before I
do myself permanent injury.''
And despite disappointment over the Scottish team's failure to match
expectation in Holland this week, that is likely to prove just a blip in
the career of Peter Nicol.

THERE is a bit of friendly competition in the Falkirk area this
season, with four local football teams all in the hunt for honours and,
while it can be a source of solidarity and encouragement, there is also
just a little pressure.
No-one wants to let the community down by being the only locals to
miss out, whether it be Falkirk pursuing a European place in the premier
division, Camelon with their eyes on the Scottish Junior Cup final on
May 21, or the promotion-chasing Stenhousemuir and East Stirlingshire.
'Muir would be most disappointed if they were miss out on a place in
the first division after a season in which they had that spectacular cup
win over Aberdeen. However, an injury in last week's goalless draw
against Dumbarton has ended Adrian Sprott's season, and the Warriors
also have manager Terry Christie's son, Max, on the sidelines as they
visit Clyde at Broadwood.
The top two have still to play each other at Greenock next week, but
it will be a surprise if the leaders, Dumbarton, fail to beat Queen of
the South at home today. However, second-placed Morton have a difficult
fixture away to Berwick, who are just one win behind them.
Stirling Albion will finish their programme with a home game against
Dumbarton, but first must win today at East Fife.
At the foot, Jim Leishman's Meadowbank must beat the doomed Brechin to
retain any hope of catching Queen of the South.
The new third-division champions, Forfar, visit Queen's Park at
Hampden, but there is more interest in the match at Montrose, where the
second-placed club are hosts to East Stirlingshire, who are three points
adrift.
Third-placed Ross County, who will visit 'Shire in a fortnight, should
keep the points at home against Cowdenbeath. There is nothing at stake
in Alloa's visit to Albion Rovers, but Arbroath and Caledonian Thistle,
who meet at Gayfield, are in a a battle to finish sixth -- or, if you
like, top of the bottom half.

STEPHEN Hendry last night reached the Embassy World Championship final
for a fourth year in succession, setting new Crucible milestones along
the way.
The 26-year-old Scot defeated friend and rival Jimmy White once more
to set up a best-of-35-frames final with his stablemate Nigel Bond.
After his 16-12 triumph, Hendry paid tribute to six-times world
runner-up White, who must wait at least another year to fulfil his
dream.
''With Jimmy's talents he should have won 50 titles, let alone one
world title,'' said Hendry, who now is the hottest world championship
favourite of all time.
''My job is to win matches, not to feel sorry for Jimmy on the table.
But what he has done these last couple of weeks shows tremendous
character.
''I am a natural sort of player, but Jimmy and Ronnie O'Sullivan are
the most naturally gifted I know.
''I know people want me to lose,'' admitted Hendry, who is quoted at
12-1 on -- Bond is 6-1 against -- to take home the #190,000 first prize
to go with his #1000-per-point for Thursday's maximum 147 break.
''I would love to be as popular as Jimmy White. But I wouldn't swop
what I've achieved for being popular.''
When the 32-year-old left-hander reduced the gap from 13-9 down to
trail only 14-12, a sympathetic crowd sensed a major comeback victory.
But the four-times world champion is in a different league. His
response was to finish off with breaks of 72 and 100.
That was his fifth century in the match and his ninth during the
championship, topping the mark of eight previously held by himself,
Steve Davis, and John Parrott. This was also his nineteenth match win in
a row since losing to Steve James in the 1991 championship.
Commenting on his match with Bond starting at lunch-time today, Hendry
said: ''I can't wait to get started. I would have been confident
regardless of who was sat in the other chair.''
White's consolation was a cheque for #57,000 -- his best of the season
-- and the knowledge that his form is almost back to its best.
''I'm going to work hard over the summer because I don't want to go to
tournaments next season with just a week's practice,'' he said.
''Stephen is a fantastic cueist and if you don't punish him when he
misses, he just destroys you.
''I'm pleased to get my game together and it's nice to be involved at
the right end of tournaments for a change.''
Bond required only one frame out of a possible nine to clinch his
final place but found it anything but a formality as Devon's Andy Hicks
recovered the kind of form which had accounted for Steve Davis, Willie
Thorne, and Peter Ebdon.
World No.11 Bond, at one time 14-4 ahead and with a 15-7 overnight
lead, eventually completed a 16-11 success. But he had to be patient as
Hicks produced a break of 136 -- which has been bettered only by
Hendry's maximum on Thursday -- in reeling off all four frames before
the interval.
Twelve months ago Bond produced one of the greatest escapes at
Sheffield, beating 1980 world champion Cliff Thorburn 10-9 after having
trailed 9-2. ''It crossed my mind that the same thing was going to
happen to me,'' he said.
''It was nice to make that 54 clearance after the final interval,
because I wouldn't have liked him to get much closer.''
Bond insists he will be a match for Hendry in the final. ''If I play
the snooker I am capable of, I can beat anyone,'' he declared. ''I
certainly don't fear anyone. I realise I'll be the underdog, but I'm
just going out there to get stuck in.''
Hicks left for Devon with a cheque for #57,000 in his pocket. He has
also rocketed up the rankings to start next season at 17 after having
started this campaign at No.33.
The Mayor of Tavistock is planning a public reception when he gets
home.

THE sometimes outspoken Colin Montgomerie was the perfect diplomat in
Paris yesterday when discussing the respective merits of Ian Woosnam and
Nick Faldo as golfing partners.
Montgomerie and Woosnam, playing together in the Perrier Paris Pairs
tournament, shot a five-under-par 65 in the foursomes stage to take the
lead after two rounds on 129, 11 under par.
They lead Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal, and Richard Boxall
and Derrick Cooper by one shot. Montgomerie, who played regularly with
Faldo in the 1993 Ryder Cup match, was full of praise for Woosnam's iron
shots to the green.
Asked how Faldo and Woosnam compared as partners, Montgomerie smiled
and said: ''Ian is so much more relaxed. With Nick it's not a relaxing
form of golf, but you get the same result with both of them because they
are both great players.''
Montgomerie and Woosnam, beginning at the tenth, had eight birdies on
a card marred only by a double bogey at the thirteenth and a bogey at
the fourth. The Scot said the 5 at the 183-yard thirteenth was his
fault. ''I hit a No.6 iron and it flew 200 yards, over the back of the
green into a bush where it was practically unplayable,'' he said, ''and
we three putted from 40 feet at the fourth.''
But the duo birdied the twelfth, sixteenth, seventeenth, third and
fifth before finishing with three successive birdies from the seventh.
Ballesteros and Olazabal shot 67. ''We could not putt,'' said
Olazabal. ''We had 33 putts and that is far too many.''
Rookie Scots pair Dean Robertson and Craig Ronald (70) are on 133,
four behind.
Today is the greensomes round. Leading scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
129 -- C Montgomerie and I Woosnam 64, 65.
130 -- R Boxall and D Cooper 62, 68; S Ballesteros and J M Olazabal
(Spain) 63, 67.
131 -- R Burns and C Mason 63, 68; J Bickerton and D Lee 59, 72.
132 -- G Levenson and I Palmer (S Africa) 66, 66; M Mackenzie and D
Ray 63, 69; D Clarke and P McGinley 63, 69; P Baker and D J Russell 64,
68; R Alvarez and J Coceres (Argentina) 66, 66; S Cage and I Pyman 63,
69.
Other score: 133 -- D Robertson and C Ronald 63, 70. Non-qualifiers
included: 144 -- B Longmuir and M Stokes 70, 74.
* HOLDER Chris Kelly, of Cawder, reached the semi-finals of the
Glasgow Matchplay championship with a 2 and 1 at his home course over
William Campbell. Results:
Quarter-finals -- C Kelly (Cawder) beat W Campbell (Cawder), 2 and 1;

DOGBOY
Gillian White
Orion, #15.99
FINGLES Pond in summer. A sort of zoo/park/fairground/shopping complex
encircled by chainlink fence and motorway that seeks to interpret a
child's insubstantial dream spaces in concrete and fairy lights. One of
four in the West Country owned by Zak Oliphant. This is one visited, on
this day, by sister single-parents Kirsty and Sheralee Maggs.
All porky-pink polyester and wobbling, sweating flesh, they cram,
push, and tug five small children -- ''See that bloody peacock after
Jason? Get off you bugger, sod off'' -- between polystyrene-peppered
flowerbeds and through the My Little Pony wallpaper outlet, losing
four-year-old Jason, who has found a little hole under the security
man's compound. Lying down, at one with the earth, forcing his arm
through the hole while watching a wasp drown in a lager can -- ''he
thinks he can hear the roar of its wings and its heartbeat'' -- now he
senses something on the other side (''there is the sound of something
heavy listening'') then feels ''the grip of a red hot vice on the end of
a vicious, slathering breath''.
He ''hears his skin ripping open. He hears the gnawing on bones that
crack.'' It is the ban-dog. The sky is an unwinking blue, page eight is
barely turned, and Jason has no right hand.
What sort of writer is this? A mother of four with six previous
publications. And what does she do for a day job? On her dust jacket she
calls herself a journalist.
So . . . Jason is not Dogboy. Nor is the night security man who lives
in the squalid compound with four Alsatians and the prized secret
killer-dog, shipped out of America when it grew too hot for its
handlers. That tabloid title goes to Fergus Johnson, now approaching
Fingles Pond by long-distance hitch from Durham jail. (It was coined
from his habit of messing the houses he breaks into.) Fergus is on a
mission. He is seeking the lovely village home, its sweet peas and
Habitat druggets, of beautiful, blue-blooded Jemima, his one-time social
worker, whom he loves and wishes to kill.
You might, if you wished, describe Dogboy as an apocalyptic vision of
a morally and intellectually bankrupt society, but that would be to
align yourself with the abstractionists that Gillian White's work so
effortlessly mocks. Her writing goes down like a slider on a hot day.
It eschews all those special effects -- futuristic hints of Droog-ish
anarchy or global warming, heavy-handed symbolism, lofty over-view --
which, in this voice, would come across as cheating. Her horrible (and
moving and gripping and funny) story is assembled, like a nature table
in the schoolroom of the society of the chronically unbiodegradable,
from the things around us.
Fergus's fixed, doom-laden course is interspersed with the running
life story of the unfortunate Maggses, perpetual victims -- Sheralee,
out for fags while visiting Jason in hospital, is knocked down,
inevitably, by Zak Oliphant's trophy wife -- and with the life of his
chosen victim and her perfect family. A burlesque parade of characters,
every one a stereotype, stumbling from cause to effect, cradle to grave.
But -- and this is the source of White's peculiar artistry -- every
one is winkled out of his neat, tight shell and given the breath of life
and the dignity of other possibilities. Nothing in this black comedy is
as serious and telling as Jemima's loathing for the orphaned, snotty
Fergus, disguised for all the years of her patronage behind effortful
idealism and simulated caring.
How Fergus got to be the way he is has much of the dramatic load taken
off by the parallel tale of the ban-dog, flung out in puppyhood from a
Ford pick-up on a West Virginia road verge. This is clever, clever
writing, to mix tragedy and comedy and present it as easy reading. When
a whiff of the Martin Amis of London Fields clings to Fergus, it is a
Martin Amis with heart.
Black comedy has a slack zone somewhere after the middle when the
writer has to backpedal on either the laughter or the empathy. White
goes for the heart and invents a tangential fairy-tale in which the
Maggs sisters and their mum are taken up by some well-born male hippie
students in a squat.
For Kirsty, the gift of perfect sex; for Sheralee, a guy who likes
children. This is not even barely credible -- I guess it is political,
the equivalent of the bit that women skip in airport novels where the
girl takes six pages to undress. A pleasant blip, it doesn't distract
from the power of the ending.
None of this, of course, can be accomplished entirely
naturalistically. A breezy narrative voice -- ''all the little brown
birds of England chirp and flit from tree to tree'' or ''with her pale
colouring, Sheralee Maggs should probably use a sun block'' -- sets the
scenes and contexts and hints at an agenda for future problems. This
voice is brisk, but benign and faintly familiar -- a Glenda Slaggish
mid-market magazine pundit, perhaps -- distant but not unconcerned and
vital to the mood of the piece.
Gillian White is quite new to me. What sort of prodigy is she? One we
shall hear more of. Television adaptations of two of her books are
coming up on the BBC, the first Rich Deceiver, at Easter, the second,
Mothertime, at Christmas. I can hardly wait.

THE absence of the Scottish team preparing for their match against
Sweden at Loch Lomond on Monday and Tuesday, has diluted the strength of
today's Edward Trophy field at Glasgow Gailes. Gordon Sherry, last
year's winner, and the runner-up, Scottish champion Hugh McKibbin, are
the most notable absentees.
Three members of last year's home international side still are
competing -- Craig Watson, the mid-amateur champion, who won the
Craigmillar Park tournament last month, Alan Reid, third last year when
he also was runner-up to McKibbin, and the left-hander, Ben Collier.
Along the coast at Troon the challenge for the Helen Holm Scottish
Open Strokeplay Championship is nothing like so seriously affected.

EDINBURGH Monarchs kept their fans on the edge of their seats last
night before beating Cradley Heath 50-46 in a British Premier League
match at Powderhall.
Fourteen points from Jan Andersen helped Monarchs to victory, but
there was a touch of good fortune in the success, with Greg Hancock
suffering engine failure while leading heat No.11, letting Monarchs in
for a 5-1. Scores:
Edinburgh -- J Andersen 14; K McKinna 9; M Faria 8, S Lamb 7; L
Collins 6; L Hare 5; R Larsen 1.
Cradley -- B Hamill 15; G Hancock 9; S Cross 8; S Smith 6; J Forsgren
3; S Knott 3; J Wilson 2.
* A POOR finish cost Glasgow Tigers dear last night when they were
beaten 55-41 by Arena Essex in Purfleet.
Te Scots were two points behind, 40-38 after heat 13 but then only
gathered three points in the final three races, with Mick Powell taken
to hospital with a suspected broken ankle.
Glasgow captain David Walsh looked out of touch two days before be
bids for the British Championship in Coventry.
The Englishman scored just six points last night and must improve
greatly to stand any chance of glory tomorrow.
Edinburgh's Kenny McKinna might also make the final, but prior to the
action proper getting under way must face Bradford's Garry Stead in a
match race to determine the last place at the meeting.

SPOTTING the top managers of the future has been a favourite, if
difficult, exercise for football folk over many years and not one in
which to invest the bingo money, but if there is an extra dimension that
determines the ones who will rise to the very pinnacle, Mark McGhee
might just have it.
An earnest young man who thinks deeply about the game but who is also
not afraid to tell the truth, to himself as well as others, McGhee has
quietly mapped out his own route to what he hopes will be ultimate
success.
That has included leaving a team with whom he had been an
inspirational leader, albeit in a lower division, to join a club that
seemed, and proved to be, destined for relegation. The fact that
Leicester City have been demoted and will play in the first division is
one part of the game plan that has not worked out.
''I came here convinced we could stay up but once I saw what we had, I
realised it was going to be very difficult,'' he said. ''I had no
trouble raising morale and team spirit and that is still high, despite
the relegation, but the simple truth is I didn't have players good
enough to do the job.''
His situation, although it included major differences, has had some
similarity with that of his old friend and foe, Roy Aitken, caretaker
manager at Aberdeen. When McGhee took over at Leicester the signs were
that the team was on the way down and so, too, were the portents about
Aberdeen when Aitken was persuaded by the board and by sacked manager
Willie Miller to stand in.
Unlike Aitken, however, McGhee knew his job was long-term and he could
tackle the task with an eye for next season.
Mark has much sympathy for Roy. ''In a way, it might have been better
for him if the board had sacked Roy as well as Willie. I know he
wouldn't look at it that way, and it was impossible for him to walk
away.
''Even so, from his point of view, with so many people thinking the
club was on it was down anyway, it might have been the best thing that
could have happened. But Roy would never shirk the issue. He has been
determined to put it right and has worked hard to try and do that.''
His own experience with Leicester, all four months of it, has taught
him that in this situation all you can do is influence morale. ''It is
about all I have been able to affect. I have already sussed out who are
the ones I can trust, and those I can't. I know who are the good players
and who aren't and I just have to live with the rest for the moment.''
McGhee admits that he underestimated how serious the Leicester
position was -- ''I had only seen them on the telly'' -- but nothing
that has happened in the short time has been there has altered his view
that he has made the right decision.
He acknowledges that, even though he did a lot of homework about the
squad, and talked to many people, there were ''exaggerated'' reports of
some of the qualities on site.
''None of that means I did the wrong thing. Far from it. I had reached
the stage where I wanted to move on. I was very disillusioned with what
was happening at Reading. Regardless of how well it has gone since I
left, and whatever other people might say,I know the only reason they
are still winning games is because of the team I left them.
''They have a great set of lads who know how to go about their
business but the club itself, for me, was very short-sighted and lacking
real ambition.
''Even if Reading get promotion this year to the Premiership and will
be in a higher league than Leicester, I know that ultimately they can
never be as big a club as Leicester.''
Mark's conviction about these matters is such that his answers leave
little room for further questions on the subject. No-one has thought out
his position more analytically and it is that meticulous attention to
the minutiae of it all which could be instrumental in hoisting him up
the managerial ladder.
He believes he can make Leicester City a bigger, more successful club
than it hs ever been. ''I am not here to emulate Jock Wallace or anybody
else. I am trying to take them the next step, to compete with the bigger
clubs.'' He already has made plans to change the personnel at Filbert
Street, where they can expect radical alterations before the new season
begins. My suspicion is that quite a few of the current staff will be
seeking pastures new.
His only disappointment has been accepting the fact that he has had to
bow out of the Premiership after only a fleeting glimpse of its demands.
''To have had a taste of it was exciting but frustrating. The difference
between it and the other divisions is quantum, in terms of the quality
of the play, the quality of the stadiums, and, in general, the quality
of life in that league. The media attention, the coverage, it is all far
greater.''
The man, who was wanted by Motherwell as their manager early this
season, will still not rule out returning to this country one day but
his strategy does not include a move here at the moment, which may
explain why he turned down the Fir Park option.
''My mind is never closed to the idea of coming back to Scotland. I
would never say 'never'. I think there is a lot to be improved in
Scotland but there is also a lot to be enjoyed. But at the moment I
couldn't say that there was anything that would draw me away from
Leicester.''
He recalls when he was pondering the Leicester job a lot of people
advised him to hold on -- ''there are bigger jobs than Leicester'' --
but he answers that this way: ''Given the deal I was offered at
Leicester and the future I could see there, I couldn't agree about there
being that many better jobs. There are probably four or five jobs that
are in a different league but I would say that by coming here and doing
well, I could put myself into line for these jobs.''
It is that kind of uncluttered, honest thinking that gives the
impression that McGhee not only knows what he wants but has every chance
of getting it.
If you ask him if the ambition to manage one of the major clubs lies
deep in his heart, he will tell you that is not so deep. ''It is up
front. That is why I am here. I believe it is my best route to get to
one of the big clubs.''
He was not always inclined to take the direct route as a player,
either, but McGhee was no less dangerous a striker for that. A career
that, oddly enough, began at Bristol City, meandered through Morton,
Newcastle United, Aberdeen, SV Hamburg, Celtic, and Newcastle again,
encompassed a multitude of goals and success at a high level, including
the Cup-winners' Cup with Aberdeen.
His years at Aberdeen were probably peak time in every sense for Mark
but he had some exciting times at Parkhead, too.
Ironically, one of the most significant games he can recall is the
Scottish Cup final of 11 years ago when Aberdeen beat Celtic 2-1. That
was the day Aitken was sent off for a foul on McGhee, but it was also
the last game he played for Aberdeen, he scored the winner and it was
his birthday. ''I don't have much trouble remembering that one.''
He later became a team-mate and friend of Aitken at Parkhead and will
wait for news of the Aberdeen score with some trepidation today. ''I
desperately want them to stay in the premier division, like all
ex-Aberdeen players will, but more for the sake of the Aberdeen people
and especially Roy -- and Willie, too -- I would love to see them
escape. It is unbelievable that they are in this situation.''
McGhee keeps his interest in the Scottish game alive through the
papers but his motivation for just now is in the Midlands. ''My
ambitions are not short-term with Leicester. I hope to sign another
contract with the club and get them into the premier league.''
Once that is done, the man who took Reading from the second into the
first division after being recommended for the job by his old mentor at
Pittodrie, Alex Ferguson, will be ready for the next stage. Fergie
himself might have to watch out.

THE Scottish Claymores face one of their toughest tests tomorrow when
they return to Murrayfield to take on Amsterdam Admirals.
The Claymores are on a high after last weekend's big comeback win in
Germany when they defeated Frankfurt Galaxy 20-14, showing a depth of
character of which head coach Jim Criner was justly proud.
''We hung in there against a very good football team,'' said Criner.
''We've had our share of disruptions, but we're up and running now.''
Coming back from 14-7 down, quarterback Matt Blundin threw two
game-winning passes, the first to receiver Tim Barnett for a touchdown
and then a crucial lob to Darrell Mitchell with just 59 seconds
remaining set up half-back Siran Stacy to run in the match-winning
score.
The Claymores, now with a 1-2 record, had to win last weekend to stay
in touch with the rest of the league, led by Amsterdam with a perfect
3-0 standing.
Tomorrow's test will be considerable. Last weekend the high-rolling
Admirals defeated London's Monarchs 17-10 to add to a 17-13 victory over
the Barcelona Dragons in week one, and a 14-12 win over Frankfurt the
following week.
Not regarded as one of the league's best outfits at the start of the
season, the lowlanders have, so far, found a way to edge out their
opponents, mainly in the form of running back Ralph Dawkins.
Dawkins leads the league in rushing and has the added threat of
breaking open the big play on kick-off and punt returns. Last weekend he
crippled the Monarchs, almost single-handedly, accounting for a World
League record 161 yards on 40 rushes and two touchdowns.
Amsterdam also boast one of the league's top-rated quarterbacks in
Jamie Martin, who is dangerous when given time to throw to his receiving
corps of David Jones, Sanjay Beach and his Glasgow-born tight end Craig
McEwan.
But the Scots are on a roll and have been revitalised by their
born-again running game, led by Stacy and Markus Thomas. They accounted
for a combined 164 yards in rushing on 38 carries against Galaxy.
A major reason why the Scots showed such an improvememt in Frankfurt
was the introduction of former Cleveland Browns' giant tackle Andre
Hewitt.
The 6ft 7in, 296-pounder, who played at Clemson college, has
rounded-off an offensive line which now looks like a cohesive unit.
That, allied to the continued heroics of the defensive line led by
linemen Mike Brandon and Alan Young, will make the Claymores a different
proposition to the one the Admirals may have expected.
The Claymores are a fourth-quarter team -- leading the league with 20
points scored in the final period -- while the Admirals prefer to strike
early and sit on a lead. It should prove an interesting and exciting
contest.
Also of interest will be the kind of crowd the Claymores pull in. The
team's directors hoped to build on the 10,346 souls who turned out three
weeks ago to see them fall to Rhein Fire.
General manager Sandy Waters hopes that the big win in Frankfurt will
cause a rush for the turnstiles.

Writing is to do with rules. The more you apply, the more freedom you
have
John Banville, a novelist of rare and complex elegance, shares his
thoughts on writing and doing the twist with John Linklater
THE prize was 250 untipped cigarettes. In these days of pressurised
jealousies in the literary world, of controversial advances and
apoplectic rages over Booker winners, it is refreshing to meet an author
who will risk declaring a past success. John Banville has nothing to
conceal. He was 16. He won.
Now, it should not be imagined this was the only high point of his
career, and we shall return to the triumph in a moment. First, it should
be made clear that the Wexford novelist has scooped his awards: the 1976
James Tait Black Memorial Prize (always a useful pedigree for future
success) for Doctor Copernicus; the 1981 Guardian Fiction Prize for
Kepler, and the 1989 Guinness Peat Aviation Award for The Book Of
Evidence, which was also shortlisted that year for the Booker.
His latest book, Athena, completes a kind of trilogy, slightly oblique
in the way that chameleon narrator Freddie Montgomery keeps resurfacing
through different aliases and guises, which began with The Book Of
Evidence and continued with Ghosts.
We met in Glasgow, and it was there that the presence of haggis on the
lunch menu set up a series of bizarre associations that led to Banville
recalling his first competitive win. He ordered the haggis. It was the
first time he had tried it. Previously, an editor at Secker &amp; Warburg
had presented one at the end of a book promotion tour, and it had gone
into the Banville deep freeze in Howth, outside Dublin. It stayed there
for six months. Janet, his American wife, pulled it out. ''This is a
scrotum,'' she declared. ''I'm not cooking a scrotum.'' It got chucked.
And here was the connection with his first prize. It turned out that
his brother had a problem with his own deep freeze. It was always
stuffed with turkeys that he had won in raffles and draws. This was the
cue for the alert interviewer. Were you a winner, John? What did you
win?
''I once won a twist competition,'' he reveals. ''I didn't even know I
was in it. Someone came along and tapped me on the shoulder and said:
'You've won'.'' This was back in Wexford. Banville, by his own
confession, could never dance. ''I was one of those people who welcomed
the twist with open arms -- and legs. I didn't have to touch anybody.
Couldn't stand on anybody's feet. Didn't even have to move my feet.''
So, this was the young Banville's moment of success. Like the author he
would become, he had found the perfect form for his individual artistry.
''Imagine giving 250 cancer sticks to a 16-year-old,'' he marvels. ''The
girl got a big box of milk chocolates with a bow across it.''
A YEAR after this he was starting to write the stories that would
appear in his first book, Long Langkin, eventually published when he was
24. He left school in 1963, declining the chance to go to university.
''I thought I could go out into the world,'' he recalls, ''to do a job
for a while, to write and become James Joyce. I was very arrogant.'' He
regrets that decision now. It is not the education he misses. It was the
freedom of being a student in the sixties, the chance to get drunk, make
a fool of himself and plan revolutions. Instead, he was slaving away as
a clerk. He worked for Aer Lingus, enticed by the prospect of free
travel.
''I found it harder and harder to get out of that job,'' he reflects.
''It's ludicrous to look back. But I would have written fewer books. It
might have been better in the end to wait a few years. Teaching yourself
to write is a long, hard business. It takes forever. People think that
they speak in what they imagine to be prose, they think that writing is
relatively easy.'' Not as easy as dancing without moving your feet.
He made a few breaks. There was spell in Berkeley, California, where
he met Janet. They set up on neutral ground in London, and he had a
three-year go at full-time writing, but now he admits it would be
difficult to leave Dublin. There is also his commitment to his
profession, and this comes as a mild surprise. I knew that Banville had
been literary editor of The Irish Times since 1988, but had always
imagined this to be a dilettante sideline, a part-time source of a
writer's income support. He corrects me firmly. He is a newspaper man
through and through, full-time since 1968, and with The Irish Press
before that.
''I love sub-editing,'' he declares. Back at The Irish Press it was a
rewrite tradition. Reporters flung down facts. Subs made it into sense.
His favourite compliment came from the experienced correspondent who saw
a piece under his own name and confided: ''That's exactly what I meant
to say.''
As literary editor he asks only for concise, decent English. Of
himself he demands more. He writes with a rare elegance, a playfulness
that is quiet rather than showy, implanted ironies that sometimes take a
while to spot, little chimes and echoes, and with a beautiful compacted
quality. He is not difficult to read, but he is difficult to read
fleetingly, or just once. His crafted fictions deserve re-reading. There
is a ready audience for such a careful prose, and it is difficult at
this stage to discern if it is dwindling (because attention spans are
getting frazzled) or building (because easier fiction fails to satisfy).
He doesn't know either. He doesn't even know if he's on the right track,
not that he will be changing as he reaches his fiftieth birthday.
Banville explores his position: ''To me writing and art are to do with
rules. The more rules you apply, the more freedom you have. You can only
work within limits. Composers like Mozart and Bach were working within
very strictly confined limits. But within those limits they were doing
absolute wonders. When you have complete freedom you don't know where to
start. That's a problem for all art at this end of the century.
''People like me, and others like me, we know that whole modernist
adventure is at an end, and we know there's something new coming, and we
can see it coming, but can't see it clearly enough to do it.
''I think popular culture's grand. But there always has to be high
culture. I don't like saying it, I don't like being quoted, but there
always has to be high art. I'm not against popular culture, but I'm
against the confusion with art. This happens in the book trade now.
Popular writers have always been popular. It's no new phenomenon. What
is new is the way academe and book supplements cave in to the 'popular'
and the 'best-seller', it's really quite frightening. But when I hear
myself talking like this I can't decide if I've just become an old
fart.''
* John Banville: Athena, Secker &amp; Warburg, #15.99.

IT SEEMS to me that top level sport is going through a battle for
high-level ground, the like of which has never been seen before, and
football, bless it, is going to suffer.
Rugby League is being lured by the mighty Australian dollar and Rupert
Murdoch's millions. Some of the clubs involved don't like it because the
whole of their history, as well as the reasons they are playing the
game, is being turned on its head. I have no time for those in Rugby
Union who scoff at League's appeal.
League is a good game and getting better. Snobs often have their faces
rubbed in the dirt.
American football has arrived for real in Europe, with the Scottish
Claymores making an imprint on Murrayfield that goes deeper than their
name sprayed boldly on the grass. Anyone who doubts that Grid Iron has
any value should take a trip through to Edinburgh to see top-level
action, sky divers and cheerleaders, and listen to some pretty groovy
rock music at the same time; To say nothing of the cheerleaders.
The game may not last, but by God it's trying to.
Rugby Union sets itself up for this summer's World Cup, almost
unbelievably only three weeks away now, and my pulse quickens at the
very thought of watching the best in the world tangle on the high veldt.
Even Union, though, is not immune to the magnet of money and ever
larger profile. Union is the fastest growing sport in the world, and
Super Twenties, Super Tens, a Euro Rugby 95, and various potential
matches among the top teams of the world are not just pie in the sky any
more. They will happen. An Edinburgh businessman is openly trying to buy
a club.
Lions tours may now be a thing of the past. Short, sharp, mega-profile
action is for the future.
Only football is stuck in a rut.
The reason the likes of Rupert Murdoch, Kerry Packer, Carnegie, John
Connor, and the rest want into sport is, of course, that they want to
make money. But to make the kind of cash they need to recoup their
initial investment means that other sponsors, advertisers, pay-TV
channels, and you and me -- punters -- have to want to part with their
own cash, in our cases to go and see games.
In other words, all of this sudden fight for profile for each of these
physical contact sports means that we will now, undoubtedly, see a
headlong rush to make all of them attractive.
Attractive with a capital A. They will have to look good, they must
have an edge to them, and they will need to make us shudder with
delight.
Which is why I think that football is on a loser.
OK. Football is an easy game to play. All you need is a ball, some
space to run in, and two sets of posts. In that way it is truly the
peoples' game, and accessible by millions who don't have to be too fit
or too skilled or too strong to take part.
But, and I don't think I'm alone in thinking this, football is too
much all of one aspect -- passing a ball with your feet or heading it --
to be much more than absorbing. It's the meaning behind a game that gets
people pumped up by football in this country, not the latent
watchability of the product. Rangers v Celtic in a howling gale and mud
will still get them screaming.
I find the infantile addiction to a bad product in this country quite
funny.
All I hear on radio is people mumping about how bad Scottish domestic
football is. That Scottish game against San Marino on TV the other night
was utter bilge, as was the England-Scotland rugby game of March 18, and
they had a flipping cheek to charge the poor fools that went along to
watch it.
I find it funny, and very revealing, that Murdoch, Packer, Connor, and
even Murray's Carnegie are choosing one sport to ignore when looking for
somewhere to sink their money. And that sport is football.
They do not deem it of sufficient potential perhaps, or maybe they
think that there are no clubs to buy, or maybe, just maybe, they think
that football has found its level, or is even on the slide.
Leaving aside the Blackburn Rovers of this world, there isn't money to
rival Murdoch and co. being ploughed into football.
All I hear about now in rugby is how the lawmakers want to make the
game more attractive. The same will be true of League, and very probably
American Football, who have actually changed their rules slightly to
make the game more spectacular for the European audience.
I took my Rangers-daft nine-year-old son to see the American football.
He loved it, and joined the fan club.
He's still mad on football, but will he, and the next generation of
spectators, always be so? Especially if football continues to serve up
the kind of garbage that was on TV the other night?

CAR insurance should be renamed con insurance. That is the conclusion
I have come to after 30 years of paying same. No, I haven't recently had
a bump and been refused a claim. Nor have I acquired my dream car and
found it is a bad risk (I suspect all my dream cars would be viewed by
insurance companies with the same enthusiasm as Free Kirk elders have
for disco dancing). In fact I have recently found a reasonable deal via
a broker with the company I had been with for years until I forsook them
two years ago. My complaint concerns the events which led up to this
divorce and remarriage.
Having had the same broker for 20 years and no claims for 15, I was
not pleased when my premium was suddenly hiked by a large amount -- like
#200. The trouble, the broker ruefully explained, was that my wife's 15
years of driving in Russia did not count over here. And of course there
had been a sharp increase in car crime. And it didn't help that I lived
in G51 -- Rab C Nesbitt's postal area.
So I did what everyone was being encouraged to do by little red
telephone commercials on television. I phoned around. Some companies
still considered Rab a bad chap to live next to. Never mind that I live
well away from his end of G51 and that I am 50 yards from G41. They
didn't want to know. Others were oblivious to this handicap and were
more interested that I had a garage and a car alarm. At last I thought I
was getting somewhere when in came a quote for about the same amount as
I had been paying before the hike. ''I can't better that,'' said the
broker dejectedly, and so ended a fruitful partnership.
My new company was more anonymous. I had spoken originally with Amanda
but now everything came by computer. A green card was extra (a lot
extra) and had been included with my previous deal. Still, never mind, I
had saved #200. A year passed. Funny, I thought -- I'm due a renewal
notice. The computer had not forgotten but Auto Direct had failed to
direct, and not sent it on.
It came a week before renewal was due. Three hundred pounds had been
added to the premium. I had had no accidents, no claims. My wife by now
could not be described as a novice and the five-year-old car was worth
less than a year ago, and yet the premium had been increased by 60%.
There was a catch. If I agreed to increase my excess (they didn't say
by how much), they could keep me at the same premium. It was a form of
coercion and I reacted against it. Hence I am now with a recommended
broker who got me back with GA at the same premium as I left them. My
experience prompts me to reflect on the changed nature of the motor
insurance world. Of course the insurance companies have to compute the
risk, and also try to make a profit. But in supermarkets if they charged
people more because there were too many shoplifters, the customers would
soon complain.
When insurance companies hike our premiums to pay for car thieves and
hot-rodders who live at the other end of town, we are effectively being
taxed for someone else's misdeeds. The whole point about insurance is
that it is taken out on a personal basis and thus personal
responsibility should be a prime factor. If I keep denting my car, then
I should take responsibility. If someone else reverses into me and dents
it, then they should take responsibility for the claim which their
insurance may have to pay out.
If I reduce the risks of theft by keeping the car in a garage, with an
alarm or a steering lock, then am I to be treated the same as someone
who does none of these things? Is my postcode more relevant than the
circumstances in which I keep my car? Does the fact that I write at home
make me the same risk as a full-time journalist reporting fires and
driving in and out of the city each day?
What I see happening is that insurance companies put the worst
possible scenario on all these situations and increase charges
accordingly. What about the free market, I hear you say? Can I not shop
around? As I have outlined above, some companies are using lower quotes
to get business and then squeezing them for higher premiums which are
not justified by the circumstances. Furthermore, there is not a free
market in motor insurance. It is compulsory by law and has become like a
motor tax which is levied by insurance companies on the hapless and
helpless public. Worst still, the Government, instead of regulating this
pimping by premium, has decided to get its nose in the trough by taxing
us on our insurance premiums.
Of course the cheapest will seldom be the best where insurance is
concerned, but this is no excuse for the legalised robbery which has
been going on over car insurance in recent years. Of course there must
be a requirement for third-party insurance or innocent victims will find
themselves doubly damaged by accidents, but the rates should be subject
to independent scrutiny as long as they are legally binding.
We are learning (the hard way) that there are many areas where it is
not appropriate to apply a free market. This is an instance where a
mixture of monopoly and market are detrimental to the consumer. Is there
perhaps a case for increasing the road fund licence to create an
insurance fund administered by an independent body for third-party
cover? Or putting up the cost of a driving licence to contribute also?
Motor insurance would then be a matter of optional cover and truly a
free market in which the customer is not turned into a supplicant to be
punished if the computer does not like his postcode.

HERE comes that sound again -- part electro-bagpipe, part swarm of
flies -- a sound deemed worthy of regular exploitation by one band and
one band alone. Yes, Big Country are back.
Launching a new album, Why The Long Face (to be released in June), in
the cramped confines of the Borderline does nothing to deter Stuart
Adamson and his cohorts from shovelling on the crass clinker of stadium
rock. As a result, the volume rarely dips below 11 and a succession of
quite startling axe-hero poses are unselfconsciously adopted.
The proto-grunge check shirts may have been eschewed in favour of
muted High Street chic, but on this evidence at least, Big Country's
ever-popular cocktail of Celtic-tinged fretwork and salt-of-the-earth
positivism remains untroubled by considerations of fashion of stylistic
development. Indeed Adamson's unpretentious everyman anthems have been
such frequent visitors to the charts partly as a result of this wilful
ordinariness. So we get singalong bombast on the new single I'm Not
Ashamed, careening guitar solos on One In A Million, and relentlessly
upbeat optimism on all the others -- the rhythm section breaking into
conspiratorial smiles at the rampant rockist finale of God's Great
Mistake.
The album's curious title is said to be derived from an Emo Phillips
gag and Stuart Adamson, for all his grimly determined bluster, wears the
look of a man used to laughing all the way to the bank.
Here comes that sound again . . .

SOUTH African Test batsman Daryll Cullinan made history as Derbyshire
piled on the runs against Sussex on the second day of their Britannic
Assurance County Championship match at Derby.
Cullinan became the first man to score a century on his championship
debut for Derbyshire. The 28-year-old Transvaal batsman was eventually
caught for 134.
Chris Adams (111) and Kim Barnett (164) also grabbed centuries and
Dominic Cork hit an unbeaten 84 as Derbyshire amassed 603 in reply to
Sussex's 111. The visitors were left staring at an innings defeat when
they were 68 for four at close.
South African bowler Allan Donald, returning to fill the gap left by
record-breaking West Indian batsman Brian Lara, took six for 56 as
Middlesex were reduced to 224 in reply to Warwickshire's 282.
Hampshire's James Bovill took six for 29 in Durham's second innings to
finish with match figures of 12 for 68.
At Chelmsford, former England stars Graham Gooch (139) and Nasser
Hussain (100) helped Essex to 404.
All-rounder Robert Croft put Glamorgan in command with a career-best
143 at Taunton. He hit twenty-three 4s and two 6s as his side made 405
-- a lead of 128 over Somerset whose Richard Harden scored 113.
Richard Montgomerie and David Capel ran up championship-best scores of
192 and 167 respectively at Canterbury before Northants declared on 561
for eight. Kent were faced with making 412 to avoid the follow-on and at
close had reached 257 for five.
Mike Atherton, on the verge of being confirmed England captain for the
summer, scored 129 of Lancashire's 271 in the non-championship Roses
clash at Headingley.

SCOTLAND'S Miles Maclagan helped Britain back to respectability
yesterday by playing well in a Davis Cup match against Slovakia in
Bratislava.
Maclagan and Tim Henman failed to end Britain's four-year run without
a ''live'' singles win in this competition, and although Britain ended
the first day having lost both rubbers, team captain Billy Knight was so
excited by his proteges, he refused to dismiss Britain's victory
chances.
''If we can win the doubles and the lads can play singles again like
they have, I believe we still have a good chance.''
Henman was beaten 5-7, 3-6, 6-4, 3-6 by Jan Kroslak, while Maclagan at
times extended Karol Kucera, ranked 226 places above him on the world
list, before going down 6-3, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.
* ROSS Matheson bowed out of the men's singles at the LTA Spring
Satellite tournament at Craiglockhart yesterday as teenager Jamie
Delgado continued to upset the seedings.
Matheson, the No.3 seed, was beaten 6-1, 6-1 by Britain's top junior.
The match was all over in just 70 minutes as Delgado continued where
he left off against No.5 seed Andrew Foster in the previous round to
reached today's semi-finals.
Scottish interest in the singles is over. Edinburgh's Michele Mair
lost 6-4, 6-2 to Olga Barabanschikova from Belarus in the women's
quarter-finals.

WE know we are being taken for mugs, of course we do. We stand
clutching our coins in the lottery queue and we are so sophisticated,
really, we can laugh at ourselves. Odds of one in 14 million? No real
disincentive. I mean someone has to be the lucky one. Who's to say it
won't be us? Irrational? Uhuh, but whoever said dreams had to be bounded
by rationality.
A tax on our stupidity? Sure. A gigantic racket aimed at relieving the
ignorant of their money? Hmm. Greed, well I suppose so. But I mean we
don't want to win the big one, dearie me no, just enough to pay off the
mortgage and the debts and a holiday for the kids, and maybe put a bit
by for security. Nope, we'd be happy with a wee win for our flutter.
Come on, it's just a bit of fun, after all, and it is in a good cause .
. .
Good cause? To make Winston Churchill the lesser and his direct family
multi-millionaires at a stroke? And he didn't even have to buy a ticket.
Unlike the rest of us 30 million lottery punters, Winston Lesser clearly
is no mug. This is his finest hour. Not only does he get #12.5m of
lottery money for his grandfather's archive, he hangs on to the
copyright over all 1.5 million bits of paper. So Churchill will be
entitled to claim a fee whenever a quote or photograph is used.
It's right that the nation should acquire and exhibit the papers of a
potent wartime leader. It's just that some rancid questions arise about
who owns them anyway. A check with the Public Record Office at Kew
establishes that the bulk of the papers are already public property. Are
we paying for something we already own? The Churchill Trustees insist
that items such as personal letters to Cabinet colleagues, many hand
written, were not state papers.
Yet legislation passed in the inter-war years required retiring
ministers to surrender their public papers to the Cabinet Office.
Churchill refused to do so, and continued to remove documents to the end
of his political career.
Like most aristocratic families, the Churchills have more pretensions
than wealth. But they are hardly impoverished -- unlike those who invest
most in the lottery. It is those with no real hope in life who gamble
most, in hope against impossible odds.
The material in ministers' papers is produced in the course of public
service. As such it should be public property. Most past ministers have
donated their papers to the nation. Ministers are your servants. The
important documents produced in the course of their political careers
should remain public property. To privatise this public material then
sell it off is a fabulous swindle on the country.
Of course, there are private letters which Winston minor could sell to
whoever he likes. He might, though, have followed the lead of his
grandfather's widow in handing them over to the nation free of charge,
but then he does have a Chelsea flat and a Kentish estate and a divorce
to keep up.
For sheer tackiness, this whole nauseating business degrades not just
the name of Churchill but the sacrifices made by almost every family in
this country. And I don't mean lottery players.
Lord Rothschild, who chairs the trustees of the heritage fund, didn't
see why the state had any right to assume the lesser Churchill should
sacrifice his inheritance. Stop carping, wheezes the backbench Tory Toby
Jessel: if it hadn't been for Churchill's leadership inspiring the whole
nation, Britain would have lost the war.
It's a memory lapse, obviously, but they seem to forget that it was
the sacrifices made by almost every family in this country that defeated
Hitler. By his grasping actions, Winston the Lesser has besmirched the
memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice of their lives.
In the publicity material handed out on the heritage grant, we are
informed that of special interest in the archive are Churchill's wartime
speeches, including ''We shall fight them on the beaches . . .'' and
''This was their finest hour''.
It is appropriate, trills the hand-out, that the acquisition coincides
with the VE Day anniversary celebrations; for it includes the VE Day
radio broadcast which is to be read out at a special VE Day concert. The
supreme irony seems to be lost on the PR honchos.In an age when
everything is for sale, perhaps we should not be suprised.
So far, Winston minor is the only charity case to receive a penny of
lottery funds. Maybe he has done us all a favour. Maybe we've woken up
from the Camelot dream to find we are all losers in the establishment
game.

SCOTLAND reached the women's semi-finals for the first since 1986
yesterday with a whitewash win over Sweden in the final group match at
the European championships in Amsterdam.
But the Scottish men, bronze medallists last year, failed to recover
from the opening round loss to Finland and crashed out of the top four.
A draw with Germany in the morning, in which Peter Nicol fought back to
beat Hansi Wiens and level the match, had kept hopes alive.
But the Germans then beat Finland, leaving a Scottish win over the
Netherlands as nothing more than a warm-up for the 5/8 group play-offs
in which they meet Switzerland.
The Scottish women were in rampant form in earning a semi-final with
the Netherlands. Edinburgh Sports Club's Alison Bowie, aiming to
celebrate her 100th cap with a medal tomorrow, continued her comeback
just seven months after giving birth to daughter Robyn with a 9-0, 9-1,
9-0 win over Jenny Akervall.
Senga Macfie then clinched the place in the medal play-offs with a win
over Eva Svenby.
Men: Scotland 2, Germany 2: P Nicol bt H Wiens 6-9, 9-8, 9-1, 9-4; M
Heath lost to F Possl 5-9, 1-9, 0-9; D Gordon lost to C Bernard 10-8,
9-2, 0-9, 8-10, 4-9; S Cowie bt J Arndt 9-1, 9-3, 9-0.
Scotland 3, Netherlands 1: Nicol bt L Buit 9-2, 9-1, 9-2; Gordon lost
to R Schaeffer 9-4, 4-9, 9-5, 9-4; Cowie bt E Smit 3-9, 3-9, 10-8, 9-2,
9-2; B Sutherland beat P Scherder 8-10, 9-4, 0-9, 10-8, 9-5.
Women: Scotland 3, Sweden 0: S Macfie bt E Svenby 9-4, 9-6, 9-4. C
Waddell bt L Olssen 9-4, 9-1, 9-2. A Bowie bt J Akervall 9-0, 9-1, 9-0.

STILL
Adam Thorpe
Secker &amp; Warburg, #15.99
ADAM Thorpe's first novel, Ulverton, threaded together 300 years of a
fictional village's history, beginning with the story of a Cromwellian
soldier who returns to find his wife has remarried and ending with the
script of a television documentary that discovers his skeleton.
It was a meditation on history and time that challenged the
established concepts of durability and change. By making the place his
central character, Thorpe gave the narrative a permanence and cohesion
it may otherwise have lacked.
His second novel takes us beyond place; indeed, a central location is
incidental. It opens mid-sentence in a 747 airliner midway across the
Atlantic, where Ricky is talking to himself.
Or maybe not; for such action as there is takes place mostly in
Ricky's head, making history personal, far less definite, and dependent
on an individual's friable memory rather than a series of verifiable
events.
Ricky Thornby is an unsuccessful film-maker who now teaches film
studies in Houston, Texas. He knows, or has known, everybody and is a
relentless gossip who is coming home to show his masterpiece at a party
to launch the new millennium. His masterpiece has neither sound nor
moving pictures. The audience, of which we are part, is shown a series
of words and still pictures of important moments in Ricky's family
history.
Because we eavesdrop on his interior monologues, the central story
fades and reappears interspersed with memories and anecdotes, jokes,
gossip, and the unedited, unformed ponderings that seem to comprise
mental activity. It also takes time to establish the voice and tone,
which may leave some readers floundering at first, but Ricky is such a
domineering, entertaining companion that the story is often incidental.
The pace of the narrative occasionally alters, is breathless at first,
but settles into something more laconic, moving in and out of recall.
The voices are entirely compelling and realistic, especially in the way
they overlap and demand attention. The difficulties lie in following a
thought pattern rather than a narrative.
There are continual interruptions, surprise beginnings, protracted
endings, storylines are established, developed, and left unfinished. But
at last we have a novel that attempts to take on cinema by fighting
back, by doing more than borrowing the short scene and the close-up, an
often funny and moving attempt to redefine the mutual territories they
occupy.

Picture: PAUL HACKETT
The present Hamish Macbeth series ends tomorrow. George Hume discovers
how it collared the country
DRUNKARD and fornicator, dabbler in exotic substances and happy to
pervert the course of justice, Hamish Macbeth is a bobby to boot. His
uniform seldom with benefit of a tie, police Land-Rover an apparent
stranger to wash leather and elbow grease, PC Macbeth is law and order
on his patch -- the vaguely placed Lochdubh, somewhere above the
Highland Line.
''May The Force Be With You,'' goes the saying, but just where does
BBC Television's teuchter cop throw his blue-serge weight about when not
pleasuring the young lady from the Big Hoose on police premises assigned
for more arresting affairs? The people of one Highland community whose
rugged idyll is seen by 10 million viewers each Sunday are delighted to
tell all who will listen: ''Plockton is the place, Hamish is our hero,
and may the Force come again -- soon.''
Not a soul can be found among the 300 folk who make up Plockton's
year-round community to pitch in to the polis who has brought nationwide
exposure to their Gulf Stream village. Palmy days. But far away in
Inverness the man who would be the real-life boss of PC Macbeth, if he
were a real-life policeman, is not amused.
Northern Constabulary's Chief Constable, Hugh Macmillan, QPM, after
just one episode of Hamish Macbeth's rampage in the heather made it
officially known -- apparently more in sorrow than anger -- that:
''Discerning viewers will appreciate that the programme is light
entertainment and should be regarded as such. It will be obvious to
anyone that it is far removed from the realities of policing,
professionally and in many other ways.''
Asked for further official comment after PC Macbeth had settled fully
into his idiosyncratic and anarchic style of policing -- for example,
employing blackmail to persuade the local bar manager who had bounced
his cheques not to stand in the way of true love -- a Northern
Constabulary spokesman declined to say more, remarking: ''A very firm
line has been drawn under Hamish Macbeth.''
Put another way: get your tie on man, tidy that Land-Rover and behave
. . . which is not the way they see it in Plockton. Douglas Hamilton,
proprietor of the Plockton Stores, keeps in touch over the baked beans
and says with the certainty of one who knows: ''The overall view of most
people is that the Hamish Macbeth series is good. I have not heard a
negative remark.
''The stories are very tongue-in-cheek, very lighthearted. It is dry
humour but with a point. Anyone with a grain of intelligence knows the
action is grossly exaggerated in order to be overtly funny. And besides,
the West Highland view of things is amusing.''
The chairman of the community council, Charlie MacRae, a postman and
barometer of Plockton's reaction to the PC with attitude, says: ''We are
all very pleased with the programmes -- certainly 95% of the folk here.
I would not say that there is any downside at all.
''Tourism is the biggest thing we have here, and already Hamish
Macbeth has had a knock-on effect, with some visitors this Easter
telling us they were on their way to Skye when they saw the sign for
Plockton, associated it with Hamish Macbeth, and came here instead.''
These visitors, their touring itineraries apparently determined by
television ratings, may hae been disappointed not actually to have been
booked for parking, litter-louting or vagrancy by the BBC's big-hearted
Rottweiler in blue serge, Hamish Macbeth . . . their expectancy of a
face-to face on the beat scored, presumably, against the real Chief
Constable's anxious hope that, away from headquarters, there is a
discerning viewing public.
Every viewer of television crime capers knows that the usual basic
minimum prerequistes in the make-up of anyone driving a ''jammy dodger''
Land-Rover and coming on heavy in the glens with a warrant card is that
they be able to accept discipline and responsibility, demonstrate a
willingness to learn, show personal integrity, intelligence, common
sense and work as part of a team. So, at any rate, says the Scottish
Office in police recruitment literature published before BHM . . .
Before Hamish Macbeth.
As his millions of fans are joyfully aware, their favourite Highland
bobby has none of these attributes, which just goes to show that on the
casting couch at any rate PC Macbeth -- aka Robert Carlyle, a thespian
who can do for police forces in just 50 minutes more than most chief
constables dare contemplate -- must have been a wee miracle at
bamboozling the selection board even if he did pass the medical: fags,
booze and loose living notwithstanding.
However, despite his manifest shortcomings, for all that a better deal
can normally be wrung from the Mafia, Hamish Macbeth has his admirers.
Proprietress of the Plockton Hotel, Dorothy Pearson, stopped cooking
lunches long enough to give Hamish Macbeth a five-star rating. ''The
series just gets better and better. The English visitors are raving
about it, and on the whole the locals are very pleased -- just as long
as people take it very tongue-in-cheek.
''The scenery has been shown very well, magnificent really, and what
has come across to good effect has been the local people. The local
children were given parts and that was very good. The TV crew will be
welcome back for a second series.''
But timing is of the essence. Film crews spend in bars and shops, but
a summer invasion of cameramen, grips, clapper loaders, sparks,
soundmen, thespians, and Hamish Macbeth is unlikely to win hearts and
minds in Plockton's packed car-park.
Douglas Hamilton of the Plockton Stores says: ''If they come here in
the summer the economic effect will be negative. They will occupy the
cottages and take the hotel rooms that ordinary visitors would have
taken. They were here the first time from September to December, and
that was certainly a plus. They do spend, but it is difficult to say
overall what the effect has been -- they even had their own catering.''
Pearson adds: ''The fact is that they will not be able to get into the
hotels and cottages they used the last time because they are already
let.''
Anna Rowe, who runs a bed-and-breakfast business and had parts in the
first three programmes of the series, reckons the film crew will not be
put off from capturing Plockton at its summer best. Not that she is
bothered . . . if it isn't TV technicians enjoying her Highland
hospitality it will be visitors anxious to plod the beat in Plockton.
Thanks to Hamish Macbeth, TV copper and Jack-the-Lad, business is
booming. ''I have already had calls from as far away as Essex from
people who booked purely and simply because they had seen Plockton on
television,'' says Anna Rowe. ''One man, an architect, is absolutely
taken by the place and he cannot wait to tell his friends he has been
where Hamish Macbeth was filmed. The series is going down very well and
we are all very happy with it.''
So, too, is the BBC. A second six-part series on the trials and
extra-constabulary triumphs of Hamish Macbeth has been commissioned from
the joint independents Zenith Productions and Skyline. It will appear on
our screens next spring. But when will it be filmed? Fliss Combes for
Zenith says: ''Filming late on last year gave us a lot of problems, so
this time we are starting the 12-week shoot in late July.
''I don't know yet what we are doing about accommodation, but I think
it's likely we will film away from Plockton for the first six weeks
while the summer visitors are still there.''
For potential visitors to Plockton, wooed by the scenery but perhaps
disconcerted at the thought of having their collar felt by PC Macbeth, a
note of virtual reality: there is no police station in Plockton. Those
in need of Chief Constable Macmillan's uniformed finest will find the
nearest police station at Kyle.

When the chips are down, it's a poke in the eye for American crisps.
I CAN remember the first time I ever bought anything. I was about four
years old, and after taking forever, I finally decided on a packet of
cheese and onion Golden Wonder crisps. In those days things were so much
simpler. Four-year-old children could wander the streets without their
parents getting worried.
Crisps were thought to be bad for you, and the restriction in flavours
meant that, having decided you wanted crisps, the rest of the purchasing
process was quite uncomplicated. We now have almost as many crisp
flavours as we have Tory scandals.
Any time I go abroad, I realise they don't actually share our
enthusiasm for flavoured potato-based snacks. On mainland Europe, crisps
are merely snacks that interfere with the consumption of ''proper
food''. This is but one of the reasons why I'm not too keen on the idea
of European unity, and although crisp decline might not seem as serious
a matter as border control, it is something the Eurosceptics should bear
in mind as a possible vote winner.
It is well known you will never get an honest-to-goodness poke of
crisps south of Dover. On mainland Europe the best you will get is an
anaemic, mildly salted, thick, stale product. Not anything near as
punchy as we expect.
Nowadays you could be forgiven for thinking that companies like Golden
Wonder are more interested in selling gambling opportunities, which is
rather sad; life is disappointing enough without being reminded that
you're a loser every time you open the Ready Salted to find that,
contrary to the hints on the packet, there isn't a cheque for half a
million pounds inside.
Even if they're not involved in some cheap giveaway gimmickry, the
whole ethos surrounding the crisp has become distinctly odd. Now any
self-respecting crisp has to be seen to be ''Foil Packed For Extra
Freshness''. How fresh can a crisp be? Anyone knows crisps are either
fresh (in which case you eat them) or stale (in which case you've just
bought them in the pub, and you still eat them if it's after 10
o'clock); there is no middle ground. As with many aspects of society,
the crisp is a phenomenon which is being slowly mutated to fit
expectations of what we think Americans would want.
Americans are certainly an odd breed: smart enough to invent
Disneyland and the chilli-dog, but too dim to realise that the people
who claim ''an inalienable constitutional right'' to bear firearms are
exactly the kind of psychopaths who shouldn't be allowed to touch metal
cutlery, never mind an AK-47.
During the week I saw an interview with the Michigan Militia, and one
man, while shooting armour-piercing bullets from an automatic rifle,
stated he needed this standard of weapon for (I'm being serious)
''hunting''. I didn't realise America was so economically successful
that the deer can afford body armour.
Don't get me wrong, having been to America once, I can testify to its
good points; but you've got to be wary of a country that considers red
Smarties more dangerous than a psychotic Vietnam vet with a shotgun.
Further proof of their lack of sense is their attitude to both beer
and crisps. Beer, as anybody knows, should be a brown liquid with a
strong taste of, well, beer. Americans, however, think it should be a
very cold yellow liquid lacking both discernible taste and alcohol
content. It's no surprise that their ''football'' games are family
events. One way to make sure dad doesn't get pissed is to get him to sit
drinking chilled coloured water all afternoon. There'll be no fighting,
because everyone's too busy stuffing popcorn into their mouths to take
away the taste of the beer!
They don't understand the crisp, either. Their crisps, sorry chips,
are rotten -- but that doesn't stop companies making our crisps into the
kind of product that they think Americans would want. These ''Lifestyle
Crisps'' tend to get bought by the same people who put red lettuce in
salads because ''it looks nicer''. The fact that it tastes like
something I wouldn't want to read about on a Saturday morning overrides
any cosmetic benefit, surely.
Admittedly, the ''American-Style'' crisps taste a lot better than red
lettuce, but I'm still a bit suspicious of Kettle Chips, which seem to
be as much about Taste as about taste. Their flavours suggest, in the
typical Kettle Chip consumer, a drive for excellence in all aspects of
life. This pursuit of excellence is a dangerous thing, as it can lead to
the purchase of German cars and designer jeans, and we know how stupid
that can be -- eh readers?
Kettle Chips don't just come ''cheese flavoured'', they're flavoured
like a particular type of cheese -- Monterrey Jack. No onions, please,
let's have some Jalapeno Pepper instead. You get the impression that if
Mr Kettle ever deigned to produce a salt and vinegar flavour, they could
only be made with genuine sea salt from the Dead Sea and vinegar
produced from oxidised claret.
Image is all. Top of the pretentious pile must be Salsa and Mesquite.
Like me, you too may have thought that the latter is a small pest you
encounter on foreign journeys. That's not mesquite, that's Carol
Smillie.
Striking a blow for true Scots everywhere, Highlander crisps produced
a bunch of Scottish flavours. Caledonian Tomatoes (a good start) and the
classic Bacon with Brown Sauce. A good crisp, but I did wonder why they
didn't go the whole hog and bring in a Cholesterol flavour, or a Roll
and Black Pudding and Potato Scone flavour.
I've nothing against exotic snacks, but I reckon tortilla chip-makers
lost the place when they tried to tell us we should eat them because
they're a healthy snack food. The last thing you want to do is spoil a
food's image by telling people it's good for them. What you want to do
is tell people it will kill them slowly and painfully. Look how much
good it's doing for the tobacco industry!
What would happen to heroin sales if some idiot found out it was good
for you? Exactly. The dealers would be struggling to part with it. In
the estates around Glasgow, it would be as popular as Quorn. We should
start an anti-drugs campaign, featuring recommendations from Mr
Motivator and Will Carling. That would be an effective deterrent.
You can tell a lot about a man by his crisps. Eating Wotsits shows
you're still at an adolescent phase of emotional development. Big fat
blokes eat big, thick-cut crisps, and only the totally neurotic eat
Pringles in the sealed tube, most probably as they count their stamp
collection. People who eat plain crisps are never to be trusted. I mean,
the last thing a normal person wants to taste when eating crisps is
potato!

The land that had given us Goethe and Beethoven, the Brandenburg Gate,
and the sweet wines of the Moselle now gave us Adolf Hitler. He might
have been born in Austria, but geography had little to do with it.
Hitler was a German by blood, tongue, and pride, writes John Macleod.
ADOLF HITLER died 50 years ago tomorrow. With him died the Third Reich
and the Second World War in Europe and German pride in the German
nation.
When this evil man was born, Germany -- united not two decades before
-- was still a political infant. Long after the French, the Spanish, the
English, even the Americans had formed nation-states, Germany had
remained a hodgepodge of dukedoms, baronies,and electorates. It fell to
Prussia, under Bismarck and the first Kaiser, to smash the Germans into
a cohesive land. As a political community, it failed. The last Kaiser
presided over a mere facade of liberal values, and launched a terrible
war. The Weimar Republic, which succeeded him, was a republic without
republicans; a democracy in a land without democrats. It perished
unmourned and unloved.
This land had given us Goethe and Beethoven; the Brandenburg Gate, the
sweet wines of the Moselle. It now gave us Adolf Hitler.
Hitler was, in fact, Austrian. But this is to miss the point. So
infantile was this Germany, so vague her psychological frontiers --
there are ethnic Germans in Holland, Italy, Poland, Russia -- that
geography has little to do with it. Hitler was a German. German by
blood, tongue, and pride, one of the German volk.
Germany was sustained by that mythology of race. Hitler ignited it.
And burned half the world.
******
THERE are two difficulties in discussing Hitler and his war. One is
the scale of his infamy. What words can you find to sufficiently defame
the Austrian corporal? Hitler bombed, shelled, fired, and terrorised
nation upon nation -- Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, the
Balkans, the Nordic lands, the North Sea coast. He razed Rotterdam,
wasted Warsaw, sowed the seas with destruction and fired the night with
death.
All around us, even here, are the traces of his era. Our old folk
recall Hitler's war, their memories of it, their part in it. You cannot
visit an island cemetery without finding the graves of the war dead. You
cannot fly south to Glasgow without passing over Clydebank, and seeing a
few sad blocks of old tenement standing in an ocean of tile and stucco
-- all that remain of the district Hitler flattened 54 years ago.
Fire, terror, death, tortures of unimaginable savagery, technology
applied to the calculated extirpation of all who opposed this man, his
vision, his will. How many died in the Second World War? Unthinkable
millions. Six million Jews, and eight million others, were also murdered
by this man, Slavs, gipsies, homosexuals, Christians -- not done to
death in war, but eliminated as one exterminates rats. In that 14
million died 1,600,000 children. Most were gassed with ''Zyklon B''
crystals, a proprietary disinfectant that hissed cyanide on exposure to
air. German companies solemnly tendered to build ovens for their mass
cremation.
One million, six hundred thousand children. Afterwards, some killers
calmly admitted that many smaller children, not quite dead, were simply
burned alive.
Why? Because Hitler hated Jews. Why? No-one knows.
''Evil'' is a word we all use lightly. The most evil person I ever met
was a student from Easter Ross: a vicious, self-absorbed youth entirely
devoid of natural empathies or kindness. Nevertheless it is hard, in all
seriousness, to frame in the same sentence with that ''Face of Evil''
beloved of tabloid caption-writers, the chill blonde features of Myra
Hindley.
But if she was 10 leagues beyond my student for wickedness, Adolf
Hitler was a millennium beyond her; never, perhaps, has one man's
fantasy slain so many, flung chaos so wide, or been so universally
execrated.
The other problem is the drama of it all.
It is so easy to glamorise Hitler. Too readily our minds envision his
age as he loved to envision himself -- a great opera of flame, blood,
and fanaticism. He speaks to vast six-figure audiences -- and not by
radio either, but in the flesh, at Nuremberg rallies. All boys are fair,
all girls buxom, all parents honest and humble. All is smiles and love.
The great Fuhrer has given them peace, bread, circuses; standing in the
world, little Volkswagens to drive on the new autobahns. So they love
him.
Hitler reviews column after column, legion upon legion of troops. And
so he launches the Gotterdammerung of world war. He speaks, and a city
dies. He loathes the Jews, and so six million die. He feeds on weakness,
as a hyena feeds on carrion, and so he triumphs. He tells stupendous
lies, and so overwhelms the truth. All is melodrama, all is big, loud,
tremendous. To the end, raving in the bunker, he is terrifying in his
fantasy, majestic in the mania. As the Russians close in, a street or
two away, he wills himself and the German race to suicide.
Nonsense, of course; but powerful nonsense.
Hitler still has his cult. Even in Scottish cities there are tacky
little shops selling Nazi memorabilia -- SS daggers, Swastika crests,
Wehrmacht uniforms. In Germany there are still hoodlums by the hundred
-- weasel-like youths, skinheads, thugs -- who boast Hitler's crazed
ideas. Parties of the extreme right can take a fifth of the French vote.
Basil Liddell Hart, the great historian of war, idolised Hitler as a
military genius -- though he abominated his ideas. An absurdity like
David Irving can argue, with apparent seriousness, that the Holocaust is
myth: that the organised extermination of Jews never really happened,
and that if by some mischance a few thousands were gassed, then surely
Hitler never authorised it.
Much more dangerous -- more socially acceptable -- are such writers as
John Charmley and Clive Ponting. Britain, they argue, destroyed herself
in the Second World War -- her empire, her wealth, her glory. It was a
conflict from which she had nothing to gain (what was Poland to us?),
and in the end won nothing (for where was Poland in the decades after
the war, but in Soviet bondage?) -- but did, on a platter, hand Stalin
the mastery of Eastern Europe.
A really good Prime Minister, like Lord Halifax -- so such men argue,
belittling Churchill -- would have rapidly made peace with Hitler in the
West. And left the crazed dictator free to savage another crazed
dictator -- Hitler versus Stalin, Nazism versus Bolshevism -- and so
they would have consumed one another, and left the rest of us in peace.
So Stalin and Hitler are lightly esteemed.
It is a moot point, I suppose, which of those two wicked men was the
more depraved, or wrought more misery, or shed more blood. (In the West
we readily forget how many citizens of the Soviet Union Stalin had
slaughtered, or suffered to starve, before a shot was fired in the
Second World War.) But of the ideologies they represented, there can be
no real comparison. In the name of Marx much evil has been done. Yet
Marxism is, essentially, humanistic: avowedly rational, godless,
scientific.
Nazism? Nazism was a mad blend of black magic, Masonic symbolism,
perverted Roman Catholicism, addled Nietzschean philosophy, extreme
German nationalism, the cult of sex, war, and blood. Because man is
naturally superstitious, naturally violent, naturally ruthless -- we
vary only in our degrees of social conditioning, and are largely
tempered by cowardice -- Nazism, for real, was far more dangerous than
Communist ideology. The Marxist-Leninism of Stalin's USSR was vicious,
brutal -- in practice. In theory, it preached peace, love,
self-sacrifice, and brotherhood.
Nazism was entirely different. It gloried in slaughter, exalted
violence, exulted destruction. Beside even Soviet Communism, Nazism was
demonic. It had flowered in the pit of hell.
**************************
HITLER was such a brilliant propagandist -- and, in a TV world hungry
for moving imagery, his own film material is still unwittingly
rescreened and reviewed -- that we are too keen to take him at his own
face-value. Hitler took himself very seriously. But he was consistent,
through his life, in only one thing -- telling enormous, barefaced,
cynical lies.
Let us coldly lay forth the truth.
Hitler, the physical man, was small, weedy, unprepossessing. He had an
odd gait and a strange empty stare. For most of the Reich his every
appearance was carefully stage-managed and groomed. By its end he was
seldom seen. Few Germans saw Hitler after 1943. If they had, it would
have ruined for ever their trust in his invincible vision.
Hitler, by April, 1945, could hardly see, walk or talk. He was
crippled with Parkinson's disease, unable to write legibly, unable to
stand for any period, scarcely able to feed himself. He was in the hands
of quack-doctors and a brutish valet. He was not even clean. Generals
were nauseated by the sight of a Supreme Commander who stank of urine
and sweat, who dribbled from the corners of his mouth, whose clothes
were stained with soup and chocolate.
Few now believe Hitler died as popularly retailed -- shot by his own
hand, as he simultaneously took cyanide. He was probably murdered by
companions in the bunker. Dr Hugh Thomas has suggested -- and it's by no
means improbable -- that the shambling, senile leader of the Third Reich
was finally throttled by his manservant.
As an artist, Hitler was a barely passable painter. (But he took
notorious interest, on assuming power, in rapidly obliterating what he
called ''degenerate art'' and filling Germany with wall-to-wall
fantasies of blond hunks and butch women.) As a writer, he was awful.
Mein Kampf -- My Struggle -- is an embarrassing, meandering tract, with
sinister clarity only on the outlined war aims; Hitler devotes thousands
of words to a clinically obsessive tirade about syphilis. (The book
would have been utterly unreadable, had it not been finally polished by
a Jesuit priest.)
Hitler the orator is mystifying to us. Even Germans, seeing the
sound-films today, find his hold on their grandparents quite baffling.
His delivery is red-faced, hoarse, screaming, spit spraying in all
directions. Our Queen Mary famously dismissed the Fuhrer as an upstart
-- not for what he represented, but because he spoke such execrable
German.
What of Hitler the military genius? Even this is largely myth. For a
time he had wonderful good fortune. But his 1940 triumphs should not be
overrated. Many of the lands he overran were neutral, or peace-loving,
lacking the armed forces sufficient to stop determined Boy Scouts.
French morale, that summer, was rotten and defeatist. He had conned
Stalin into a non-aggression pact. Hitler was embarrassed only by
Mussolini's damaging plunge into conflict. And, never seriously
expecting Britain to fight, the Fuhrer had failed to make any plans for
a seaborne invasion.
At his best, Hitler had two good attributes -- a sense of theatre, and
a willingness to hold his own counsel while experts talked. So he fitted
dive-bombers with banshee-like sirens, the better to terrorise the
enemy. He delighted in civilian bombing. It is easy to win, for a while,
when one is utterly without scruple. It is easy, for a while, to succeed
if one acts slowly after much chewing of wise advice.
How nearly, for all his blunders, he won!
Yet, having the British Expeditionary Force before him, he ordered his
forces to halt -- and in these critical hours, trapped but not
destroyed, the BEF made Dunkirk and a remarkable evacuation. Throughout
the summer, things hung in the balance. But the Reich opted for
terror-bombing, not the strategic bombing of radar stations and
aerodromes, and so lost the Battle of Britain.
Granted double the number of U-boats, the German Navy could have
starved these islands out in months. But they hadn't, and they didn't.
The military genius invaded Russia -- and so opened a needless second
front. The gamble nearly succeeded. The Nazis could have taken Moscow,
or Leningrad, or Stalingrad -- in succession. But Hitler wanted them all
at once. Then he diverted forces to the Ukraine. The timetable lagged,
and winter fell. The Wehrmacht found themeselves without adequate boots,
fuel or clothes. Thousands perished of cold. Like Napoleon, the military
genius had forgotten the Russian winter.
By year's end, he had locked himself in a war to the death with
Britain, the Soviets, and the US -- a battle no Germany could ever at
the last have carried, which no responsible leader would have begun.
Atomic weapons? They came close, so close, the gangsters in charge of
this criminal state. But Nazism defeated itself. A junior officer
insisted, correctly, that only graphite could control a safe and
workable nuclear device. Seniors silenced him and pulled rank. Heavy
water was the thing. But heavy water was unworkable. And the Allies
rapidly bombed all the supplies the Nazis had.
Germany would have no Bomb in that war. But if, by some devilish
horror, she had wrought one even by 1945, our world would be a very
different place today -- if we had a world at all.
After 1942, Hitler stopped listening to anybody. By the end of 1944,
he was paranoid of all about him. He was surrounded, and had been
surrounded for more than a decade, by flattery and sycophants. By 1945
it had reduced him to psychosis. He was a sick old man -- crippled,
insomniac, living on cream cakes, deaf, practically blind. Bunker or no
bunker, even victorious, he would never have lived to see 1950.
We cannot ascertain exactly how this abominable man died. He died,
anyway, did Hitler, and his empire died, not in the glories of fire and
battle, but in the squalor of a fetid, bombproofed basement. It was
flooded in parts, starved of fresh air, awash in alcohol and vomit and
men slumped in drunken despair. All but one of its 12 lavatories were
blocked.
Fifty years ago. Do you celebrate? Or do you marvel? Rather, perhaps,
you feel strange fear: the fear of the occult and the unknown, of some
Hitler rising again; the dread of that of Hitler abiding in us all.

FROM the phrase in your editorial that the defeat of the planned rise
in VAT on domestic fuel was ''easily and relatively painlessly made up
elsewhere'', it is obvious that the BBC is not alone in ignoring the
Scottish dimension (April 22).
Part of the shortfall was recouped by increasing duty on spirits. In
particular I am concerned about the effect the mini-Budget had on the
Scotch whisky industry.
Today there are fewer than 14,000 employed in the industry compared
with 26,000 in 1979, and it is worth noting that every job in the
industry is estimated to support four more outside.
Demand for Scotch whisky is price sensitive and in the face of the
fast-falling UK market for Scotch the two Budgets in 1993 set no
increase in excise duty. In 1992 the fall was estimated at 12 million
bottles a year and the loss to the Exchequer was #80m.
The absence of an increase in 1993 was followed by a reversal of the
market decline and a recovery of #45m in revenue receipts. The Budget of
November 1994 again set no increase on Scotch whisky (or other alcoholic
drinks) as the Chancellor recognised the continuing difficulties faced
by the industry in its home market, but his mini-Budget of December 1994
threatens the fragile recovery of 1994.
With the 26p a bottle increase in tax, all the benefits from his
previous decisions were thrown into reverse.
The tax levied on Scotch in the UK is virtually twice the rate per
unit of alcohol of that applied to wine and beer and by adding 4% across
the board to alcoholic drinks taxes the Chancellor actually worsened
discrimination in the UK against whisky.
The last time an increase of that magnitude was introduced was in 1992
(25p) and the result was a catastrophic collapse in the market and
consequential loss of revenue receipts.
The increase of December 1994 also sends the wrong message to the
European Union and other overseas markets where the tendency to
discriminate in favour of home-produced drinks remains strong.
So much for relatively painless!

THE humble bicycle is silent, non-polluting, and more energy-efficient
in motion than any vehicle -- travelling 1600 miles on the
energy-equivalent of one gallon of petrol (April 25).
It is cheap to manufacture, purchase, and maintain, making it
affordable to most people.
It saves parking and traffic space and also gives door-to-door access.
Separate cycle paths cost a fraction of those for trunk roads and
motorways. Investment in them should have priority.
The British Medical Association recommends cycling as a form of
healthy exercise available to all ages.
Surely, with that pedigree, the bicycle must rank as one of mankind's
best inventions and deserves a prominent place in British traffic
systems.

JOHN BRYANT and John Robins show a startling grasp of statistics in
order to justify their respective positions on field sports (April 22
and April 24).
By utilising 1% as a median figure, from the range of figures quoted
by your correspondents, 1% of five million lambs equals 50,000 lambs
killed by predation. Do your correspondents ask the hard-pressed farmer
simply to write off the 50,000 lambs as acceptable casualties?
To spare your readers from being subjected to claims and
counter-claims on the relevant statistics and their merits, I simply
conclude with Artemus Ward: ''It ain't so much the things we don't know
that get us in trouble. It's the things we know that ain't so.''

There are no categorical imperatives in education because children are
different, and there are constraints of cash, staff, managers, parents,
and rules (often foolish).
Mr Wilson (April 22) may be right about primary schools, but only in
the round. Even there, the ablest (if there are enough) are better
taught together, by the ablest teachers.
Secondaries do best by the ablest when they are collected together to
be stimulated and inspired by the knowledgeable, rigorous, enthusiast,
often, but not always, the head of department; sometimes the department
has no-one of this calibre.
Dividing 40 kids into two classes merely deprives half the able of the
best stimulus. It would be better, even with 60 who are able, to make
one class if there is only one genius to teach them.
Marking is less of a problem than it seems. No genius from Clerk
Maxwell downwards has ever wasted time commenting on mediocre work.
Society has a genius for getting rid of its best teachers. A friend,
with a genius for teaching English (30 annual A's at Higher was usual;
his plays were a national treasure) was forced out at 50; first by a
head, knighted in post, who listened to the resentful murmurs of a
colleague and caused him to leave; then driven out of his next school by
a Church of Scotland moderator.
Finally, he was forced out of the profession by the head of a
community school wherein, to make education available to a handful of
adults, English was only taught once a week in the morning, physics in
the afternoon, etc. Thus anything learned was forgotten seven days later
and no progress could be made.
And so a teacher of genius fought his last battle and retired,
depriving our children of 15 years of inspiration. And the people
responsible were as ''able'' as you will find.
This shows that education is bedevilled by an inability to manage
ability in its own staff for the best of whom school is hell, even
though they are ecstatic about teaching; for they are continually
frustrated by the fools with the power to hinder the process, and the
envy of those without their flair.
The management of excellence in schools ought to be a required study.
Sadly, most of those in place will think they know it all already. I
doubt our knightly head ever did realise what he had lost; for he once
complained at all the A's as if they were a sign of spoon-feeding.
Not so, inspiration of an exceptional kind, rather. No spoon ever
provided anything but content, an inadequate tool for Higher English.

IT'S rarely my first instinct to trust John Pilger. Nothing whatever
to do with politics, you understand, and everything to do with his
gale-force self-righteousness and a couple of anecdotes too defamatory
to relate. In print or on screen, Pilger always knows who are the good
guys and who the bad, and never leaves you in much doubt about which he
is.
That said, his Network First, Vietnam -- The Last Battle (ITV,
Tuesday) marked the twentieth anniversary of the liberation of Saigon
with a lucid and powerful explanation of how America has won in the
boardrooms everything it contrived to lose on the battlefield. It was
the story of a country systematically bribed and bullied into
surrendering its ideals and its future. A triumph, no less, of free
enterprise.
Vietnam once had free schools and a free health service. Not so long
ago its co-operatives flourished and no one went hungry. Now its laws
are drafted by the World Bank, and something called ''market socialism''
-- a camel designed by a clique -- is assisting the world's
entrepreneurs to reduce the country to a puddle of cheap labour.
It was a fascinating human study to watch the successors of the people
who dropped on Vietnam six pounds of defoliant for every man, woman and
child in the country -- and left it with more deformed children than any
nation in the world - talking up their golf clubs and resorts. Pilger
reminded us that Kissinger's promise of $3 billion in reparations was
never kept, while observing that only Bangladesh has more underweight
and stunted infants than Vietnam.
He was best, perhaps, on America's mythologising of the conflict after
the fact. All those movie heroes -- and if they were so tough, how come
they lost? -- who have become history in the American mind. Nixon the
war criminal is almost forgotten; Rambo was the real thing. As one US
vet put it, for the folks back home ''Vietnam is a war, it's not a
country''.
The tunnels at Cu Chi are now a tourist attraction; My Lai isn't
mentioned, lest that discourage US investors; rice is exported while
people go hungry; and Uncle Ho's dream has been transformed into an
''export processing zone'', a slave state in all but name. Bear this
important documentary in mind the next time someone extols the
''partnership between public and private sectors''.
Rather less interesting was The Life and Times of R D Lang (BBC2,
Wednesday), another cautionary tale of the sixties. It gave clues
aplenty to the sources of Ronnie Lang's ability to screw up a sizeable
chunk of an entire generation using only shiny Penguin paperbacks, but
it failed properly to explain why the King of the Loons was, first and
always, the quack himself.
Lang had charisma, a bedside manner that couldn't be beat, and a
talent for carelessness on a global scale. He managed to persuade far
too many dopes that ''with psychosis came wisdom and understanding''.
Having contributed a couple of useful thoughts on the nature of family
dynamics, he went on to become the very worst sort of parent.
At no time did the piece divulge how Lang got away with it. Clearly,
most of his ''insights'' were made up as he went along, yet people could
still be found prepared to argue in his defence that the poor drunk was
''expected to play the guru'' and really had no choice.
From old footage alone the truth became obvious: a major egomaniac
realised very early in his career that the world is full of suckers, and
that only a few of them are certifiable.It was a patchy, voyeuristic
study that made few useful connections.
Lang's Scottish roots received scant attention and contemporary
interviews were shot, irritatingly, in black and white, as though that
alone conveyed serious intent. We never did discover precisely what it
is a psychotherapist does. As though in compensation, however, we were
given the chance to remember that Ronnie was one of the worst poets of
the twentieth century. Always a giveaway.
Channel 4's Without Walls (Tuesday) is another patchy affair. Some
weeks it can be wonderful; at other times it makes you want to ram a
designer armadillo through the screen. This week, thankfully, it made
room for a clever, witty essay by Pete McCarthy on the eternally vexed
subject of children.
Bloody Kids was the study of a nation that pretends to love its
offspring but in reality finds them at best a nuisance, at worst a kind
of Satanic curse -- Damien with a Megadrive, a baseball cap, and an
attention span of 9.5 seconds.
For most of the piece, McCarthy simply allowed the nuts to come out of
their shells. One devout old man who finds local kids a nuisance was
filmed sitting beneath a sign which stated: ''And they overcame Satan by
the blood of the lamb Jesus Christ'' while he advocated birching. The
British Association of Non-Parents said kids were fine in their place,
but not on beaches, in supermarkets, at the cinema, or on buses.
The association is not, its members insisted, anti-children, merely
''anti'' the people who don't ''control'' them -- rather like careless
pet owners.
Meanwhile, Professor Desmond, a loveable children's entertainer, was
explaining how he handled the difficult sprogs: ''I might just pull
their hair gently . . . I feel that's quite in order''.
Next up were maniac dads brutalising tiny footballers from the
touchline, while McCarthy noted that children are captive consumers in
the ''amoral hell'' of kids' TV. ''Maximum security'' private schools
are, he stated bluntly, and correctly, ''evil'', before going on to
note: ''As a nation we are inordinately fond of the physical
chastisement of children''. It can't be said too often.
McCarthy has come a long way from travel shows, and deserves to go
much further. This was an economical, crafted and telling little piece.
At the very least, anyone who has ever tried to feed a child in a public
place would have recognised ''crispy-crumbed corporate chunder'' as the
average children's menu.
So what, her daughter wanted to know, does the Absolutely Fabulous
Eddy (BBC1, Thursday)  actually do for people? ''PR! PR! I PR them!
People, places, concepts . . . Lulu! I PR them! I make the crap into
credible''. Sometimes you know exactly how she feels.

I ASKED a supplier in Oxford to send me details of distributors of
their products in the Aberdeen area.
They sent me two addresses: one in Aberdeen that didn't stock what I
wanted, the other in Kilcreggan, on the Firth of Clyde, more than 200
miles from here.
In spite of my doubts about their knowledge of the geography of the
''United Kingdom'', I decided to order direct from Oxford. I wonder when
(and if) the goods will ever arrive.

I AM the chairperson of Gingerbread Scotland and I can fully empathise
with Mrs Neill (Charity blames the Lottery, April 20) in many respects,
but where the Multiple Sclerosis charity is staffed, Gingerbread is a
voluntary organisation.
We get no funding and we rely on public donations to keep our
organisation afloat, and the drop in our collections has had an adverse
effect on us. Some weeks we barely have enough to pay our volunteers'
travelling expenses, so you can imagine what it is like trying to keep
up with payments for rent, etc, on our premises.
We cannot get any money from the National Lottery as they do not
donate money for running costs and, while we feel that many worthy
charities are receiving money from the lottery, surely it is time to
stop and look at the effect the lottery is having on the many registered
charities which are finding it increasingly hard to make ends meet.
Members of the public are under the impression that if they buy
lottery tickets they are helping many charities, and indeed this would
be an ideal solution. But the charities are the real losers here and I
would urge everyone not to forget charity collectors when they see them
standing on some draughty street corner with their cans. Any money put
into cans goes directly to the charity and saves a lot of time and
trouble.
We don't go out in all weathers for the good of our health but for the
necessary funding to keep our organisations running and because of our
commitment to our communities.

THERE has been much talk about equal opportunities for women in
education, in the workplace, and in politics.
I visited Glasgow University's recent celebration of the centenary of
the first degree award to a woman and I learned that 50 years on, in the
1950s, women made up only a small percentage of the undergraduate
intake.
It is much better today, with women making up almost half the intake.
Similarly in the workplace, in spite of equal opportunities
legislation, only about 10% of senior managers and 3% of head teachers
in Scotland are women.
Inequality is now a political issue. So perhaps it is the politicians
who can do most to influence the attitudes of people and reflect the
growing impatience over this issue in society.
After all, our legislative body is the mother of democratic
parliaments: but sadly, even there, only a small percentage of MPs are
women.
Although women make up half the electorate, little has been done to
redress the imbalance. The blame for this is usually directed at
constituency party selection boards. Of course, there has been talk of
positive discrimination but, in my view, discrimination of any kind only
perpetuates discrimination and does not solve anything.
Surely the way forward could be a straightforward halving of the
number of constituencies and the election of two candidates (ie, one man
and one woman) for each seat. That surely would be a fair answer to the
problem and perhaps remove the gender gap for the 21st century.

THE HERALD scooped it wrong when it reported Malmaison would be the
first people in Glasgow to serve Ben and Jerrys (Ben and Jerry bring
their ice cream to town, April 26).
At The California Gourmet we, and hundreds of ecstatic customers, have
been enjoying the delights of cherry garcia, chocolate fudge brownie,
and seven other ''euphoric flavours'' from Ben and Jerrys, the renowned
ice-cream makers from Vermont, for over six months.
As the first independent retailer in Scotland and indeed Glasgow to
sell Ben and Jerrys we were consulted and were instrumental in finding a
distributor for them, as acknowledged by their personal visit to our
store.
We have the ice-cream spoons they used to prove it and will shortly be

Spoken in the best Brooklyn accent, an American film comedian Leo
Carillo many years ago commented: ''I am a man of very few words but
when I speak I say a whole lot.''
Would that your today's contributors (April 20) follow Leo Carillo's
example.
Regretfully this now monotonous section is a no-go area for this
reader who has purchased The Herald for over 50 years.

WE should not be naive. Every decision taken by Government at the
moment has an element of political calculation. It is not cynicism to
say that there are precious few signs of disinterested politics visible
in Downing Street, and by that we mean politics which are politically
neutral and which result in policies which will bring benefit to no
political party, whether they work or not. This is a roundabout, but
necessary, way of saying that Scottish Nuclear, Scottish institutions
and industries, and Scottish workers need expect no favours as the chain
reaction leading to the privatisation of the nuclear electric generating
industry crackles merrily along. There is still a measure of
astonishment abroad that the Government has brought itself to
contemplate this privatisation. There were no signs of it as recently as
two weeks ago, but now we find ourselves in the throes of the most
ridiculous and potentially dangerous privatisation of all. The reason is
clear: the Government desperately needs to raise some revenue so that
tax cuts can be delivered before the next General Election. Again, this
is not cynicism. Privately, few Tories can be found to deny this
interpretation, and even fewer appear to bear any feelings of guilt over
it.
This is a shame, for it says something about our political system and
method of governance which is deeply depressing. The consequences will
be heavy. The Government has proposed a devious device in the form of a
holding company under which both Scottish Nuclear and English Nuclear
Electric will be privatised swiftly. Scottish Nuclear's leadership
believes, as we reveal this morning, that this form of privatisation
will lead to job cuts and a transfer of control to England. Skilled jobs
will follow. Scottish institutions and manufacturers appear to be as
appalled as anyone else at this prospect and nobody has been comforted
by Mr Lang's assurance that Scottish Nuclear would retain a ''distinct
Scottish identity'', whatever that might mean. Sir Donald Miller, who
rightly describes the affair as a breach of faith by the Government,
believes it translates as a shiny brass plate on a nominal, but
emasculated, office in East Kilbride. On past form he is almost
certainly correct.
Having said party political calculation is all these days, how will
the Scottish Tories, rubbing their eyes in disbelief at their local
political representation in Scotland, deal with this affair? Today Mr
Lang will meet senior West of Scotland Tories to find out what went
wrong in the elections, and Lord Fraser will conduct the same exercise
in the east. Do they really need to ask? Mr Bill Walker believes the
party needs to listen to what people are saying and then bring forward
proposals to deal with the credibility gap. He is right, though his
solution, which consists of more of the policies espoused by Mrs
Thatcher and Sir Teddy Taylor, could hardly be wider of the mark. But he
has put his finger on one point with accuracy. Mr Major promised us a
government which would listen to what people were saying. This is a
favourite politician's trick, for though all can listen, there is no
requirement to act. This time there is a requirement. From vigorous
trumpeting of the benefits of the Union, Mr Major appears determined to
pursue policies which will endanger it. Again, we must not be naive. He
is driven by political imperatives which have little to do with
Scotland. But if he really wishes to retain the Union he must start by
both listening and acting, and the best place to begin is by heeding the
dangers of his nuclear plans.

IN your coverage of the opening of the new Scotstoun Leisure Centre by
the Prince of Wales you gave considerable prominence to the views of a
small group of demonstrators from Whiteinch Swimming Club (April 21).
We are trying to respond to the needs of that club and do indeed
provide extensive access for swimming clubs in our pools throughout
Glasgow. Scotstoun Leisure Centre is an outstanding new facility, one of
the largest community leisure facilities in Scotland, and our primary
concern is to make it accessible to all the people of Glasgow.
To do that we have to manage carefully the periods when facilities of
the centre are closed to the general public because of exclusive club
use.
We will continue to do what we can to assist Whiteinch Swimming Club
but it is important that its needs are balanced within the context of
our objectives for the widest possible access by the whole community to
this exciting new facility.

A NEW #160,000 poultry research unit was officially opened yesterday
at the Scottish Agricultural College at Auchincruive, near Ayr.
The facility has been partially funded by the Marshall Food Group and
is named the D B Marshall building in memory of the company's founder.
Auchincruive already claims to be the leading centre in the UK for
research and teaching in the poultry industry and the new development is
regarded as the most significant initiative of its kind in Europe in
recent times.
The official opening was carried out by Muir Russell, secretary of the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department, who expressed the
hope that it might the first of many such joint ventures in the
agricultural industry world. The SOAFD provided two-thirds of the
funding and the balance was made up by Marshalls.
The new facility would give the college a means of setting up the
right environmental conditions for looking at welfare issues such as
skeltal abnormalities, he said.
Referring to the need for top-quality research, Wilson Marshall, chief
executive of the Marshall Food Group, said: ''It is a tough commercial
market place and it is important that we strive for higher standards,
improved efficiency and better value.''
He also stressed the importance of systems and practices which, from a
welfare point of view, would be acceptable to the consumer.
The new building is currently conducting trials for 10 different
companies, including Marshalls, who are the college's biggest clients in
terms of repeat business.
One recent trial has concentrated on a comparison of four different
strains of commercially available broilers, looking at their ability to
convert feed into meat and the efficiency with which breast meat is laid
down as opposed to leg meat.
The best strain returned 17.3% breast meat and the poorest 16.2% --
which is regarded as a significant difference. In financial terms the
top strain returned a grower income of #685 per 1000 birds and the
lowest #616.
Among those touring the site yesterday was Clive Holands of the Farm
Animal Welfare Council who described the facilities as very impressive.
One of the problems in the broiler industry was control of the
environment, he said.
The computer-controlled systems allowed for the creation of the
perfect environment. One of the major welfare problems was leg weakness,
he said, and the new facility was capable of doing a lot of work in that
field.

JOYCE McMILLAN reflects on more than a decade of agitated and frenetic
changes as radio stations have grown in number, noise but not
necessarily nous
CHRIS EVANS arrives, I leave; and although it's pure chance that the
eruption on to the airwaves of BBC Radio 1FM's new, ginger-headed,
super-expensive breakfast presenter coincides with this last column of
mine as The Herald's radio critic, it seems somehow fitting that I
should make my farewells to the sound of a rammy, a cross-media
publicity circus, and a babble of frantic gossip about the value of
Evans's eight-month contract.
He was hired for anywhere between #500,000 and #1m, by most accounts
-- and the fuss so perfectly sums up the radical changes that have swept
through British radio in the past 11 years.
For what makes 1FM's breakfast show such a keen subject of concern, to
media folk across Britain, is that fact that it lies right at the point
of maximum conflict between the embattled BBC -- which has spent most of
the past decade fighting to hang on to audiences against ever-increasing
commercial competition -- and the burgeoning independent radio industry,
which cannot help casting a lustful eye on the 12-million-strong
audience that still remains loyal to 1FM, despite half a decade of
decline.
When I sat down to write my first radio column, in December 1983,
there were perhaps six major radio stations -- before BBC networks,
Radio Scotland, Radio Clyde -- that a Herald radio critic had to contend
with; today, with the splitting of Radio Clyde, and the coming of Radio
5 Live, Scot FM, Atlantic 252 and the three new UK commercial networks
(Virgin, Talk Radio UK, Classic FM), there are at least a dozen, and the
number continues to rise.
Throughout the whole of the eighties and nineties, in other words, the
development of radio in Britain has been driven by a powerful
ideological assumption that our radio industry should and must
deregulate, to allow a vast expansion of the commercial sector; and that
the BBC must adapt to this new environment by changing, marketing,
putting aspects of its work out to tender, learning to live with the
loss of frequencies and an ever-diminishing audience share.
So if Chris Evans and his team can halt the long stampede of audiences
away from the BBC's flagship popular network, they do more than boost
1FM's chances of survival; they challenge the whole orthodoxy of
inevitable BBC decline and marginalisation, and perhaps signal the
beginning of a period when British radio begins to stabilise again,
after a decade of frenetic change.
From the audience point of view, though, the issues look slightly
different. Listeners care less about who owns radio and makes money from
it, more about the range and quality of what they can hear; and here,
the evidence about the benefits or otherwise of the last decade's
changes become immensely confusing.
One hand, there are vastly more radio stations on air, some of them --
like Talk Radio UK -- exuding a kind of raw popular energy unlikely ever
to emerge either from the BBC, or from a comfortable public-private
broadcasting ''duopoly''.
But low-cost radio -- which commercial radio usually has to be -- does
tend to come in one of two standard-issue formats, either loud,
back-to-back music with minimal rent-a-voice presentation, or endless,
rambling phone-ins and interviews without serious factual back-up; and
there are times, therefore, when we seem to be slipping dangerously
close to the Bruce Springsteen nightmare of ''57 channels and nothing
on''.
Indeed, it's no accident that the programme that has returned most
often to haunt this column, during the past 11 years, is Derek Cooper's
great Food Programme on Radio 4; it's because Cooper, in a different
context, has been charting exactly the same kind of shift from a big
state-organised industry designed, however clumsily, to meet basic human
needs, to a modern commercial operation designed to maximise profit by
persuading people to buy an ever-wider range of garishly-packaged,
value-added goods, almost regardless of their nutritional content, or
the fact that beneath the bright wrappers, the packages mainly contain
the same kind of junk.
And, of course, the fierce competition among the new galaxy of
stations exerts a powerful pressure on the whole culture and voice of
British radio.
Already, presenters like Chris Evans -- whose show is a lively, noisy,
vacuous and cheeky affair with a good wakey-wakey atmosphere, held
together by the slim thread of Evans's not-quite-concealed intelligence
-- are resorting to an oddly smutty line of chat in order to shock
listeners into paying attention.
Some of the newer talk stations, particularly in London, are drifting
down the reactionary shock-jock route. So if British radio is to avoid
the gradual slide towards an American nightmare of wall-to-wall trash
radio, screaming shock-jocks and a tiny public-service sector, it seems
to me that both the industry and Government must move, and soon, away
from the 1980s myth that radio audiences can fragment indefinitely, into
ever smaller groups, without any negative effect on the quality of radio
produced.
Of course, big money is no guarantee of good radio production. But
without some concentration of resources, in big producing organisations
like the BBC and its long-time duopoly partner in central Scotland,
Radio Clyde, it seems to me that several destructive things begin,
slowly, to happen to radio.
First, its standards of technical presentation begin to deteriorate;
there are more hitches and unprofessional mistakes, a loss of the
craftsmanship that underpins real quality.
Then it begins to lose its cultural diversity, to drift towards a
homogenous transatlantic cultural norm that will maximise its
acceptibility. It loses the power, still so strongly expressed in public
networks like the revitalised Radio Scotland, to explore distinctive
areas of culture, to produce nuggety little built programmes on the
fishing business, the Mar Lodge estate, Scottish women writers of the
1900, or the art of the pibroch at the same time.
Paradoxically, it also loses its power to unite people, to draw a
community or nation together; it panders to the reactionary myth that
modern society is too ''diverse'' to hold any values or interests in
common, while in fact expressing, internally, a lack of any real
diversity at all.
It loses its capacity to act as a patron of the arts, to commission
highly-crafted and expensive forms of radio like drama, live musical
performance, complex features; where now, for example, are all the fat
tapes of original Radio Clyde dramas that used to drop on to my doormat
in the less competitive climate of the mid-1980s?
And, more important than all the rest put together it loses the
ability to produce high-quality, well-resourced international news and
current affairs coverage, without which there can be no intelligent
public life in the global village we all now inhabit.
If I look back over my decade of radio listening, of course I remember
hundreds of wonderful moments from every kind of programming. But the
life-blood of that experience, in one of the great global news decades
of the century, has been the voices of those tough, intelligent,
highly-trained, experienced, and no doubt expensive-to-run BBC
correspondents -- the Mark Tullies and Fergal Keans, the Colin Blaines
and John Simpsons -- coming to me out of Africa and Russia, Bosnia and
Romania, Baghdad and Berlin, giving me their eyewitness accounts of how
the world was changing, what those changes might mean.
And if our broadcasting system ever fragments to the point where
journalists of that quality can no longer be trained and sustained, if
Mark Tully's angry resignation from the BBC last year turns out to be a
harbinger of deeper change, if the canker of cut-price, second-hand news
produced by under-paid young journalists begins to spread, and if the
public service element of our broadcasting system withers away until
there are no more big news-gathering operations without their own
commerical axes to grind and owners' interests to serve, then our whole
broadcasting culture will have lost a benchmark.
It will have lost a concept of broadcasting whose first purpose is not
to make money but to tell the truth that we in Britain often take for
granted and curse for its shortcomings; but without which we would be so
much the poorer that we would scarcely recognise ourselves at all.

IS Mr Blair dancing? Is Mr Ashdown asking? This may be a variation of
an old Glasgow dance hall chat-up line, but it could have political
relevance for the next two years before the General Election and,
indeed, the succeeding years. The subject is the state of relations
between the new Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, and specifically
the strategic positioning of Mr Ashdown and his party. Traditionally,
and apparently with the full acquiescence of the party, Mr Ashdown has
found himself shackled by the policy of ''equidistance'', which means
simply that the Liberal Democrats see themselves at an equal distance
from both Labour and the Tories. There is no doubt that this policy has
had its uses. It can be argued that it is impossible to present clear
and distinctive policies which will attract and convince an electorate
if your party is too close to another. Why vote for the Liberal
Democrats when they are so close to a much bigger party? The old jibe
about a wasted vote takes on extra meaning here. There is, though, a
certain dissonance in this policy, as any voter with the most minimal
political awareness must have an inkling that the Liberal Democrats, in
style and in policy, are nothing like equidistant between the two main
parties, but hang a good deal closer to Labour than the Tories. The
temptation to make reality out of a general perception is not just
overwhelming in political terms, it is also simple common sense.
There are signs that both Mr Ashdown and Mr Blair appreciate this
fully and that they might just be prepared to hint at it in public and
work towards it in private. In an interview this week Mr Blair was
remarkably relaxed about the possibility of co-operation with the
Liberal Democrats. Nothing institutionalised, of course, but he sees
areas of overlap and is clearly not hung-up on notions of Labour first
and the Devil take the hindmost. Mr Ashdown is also popularly supposed
to yearn to rid himself of equidistance, not least because he
appreciates its illogicality. Convincing his party members of this will
not be an easy task. While there are some, particularly among the
younger members, who see nothing wrong with it (one young Liberal
Democrat activist at a Scottish university was agreeably astonished
recently to be approached by an official of the much bigger Labour
organisation with a request to ponder joint action), other Liberal
Democrats will disagree. Mr Ashdown touched on the issue yesterday in
his speech in Perth and gave cautious approval, along with many words of
warning about the lack of facts accompanying Labour rhetoric and the
tendency of Labour in power locally to emulate Mussolini.
Mr Blair might just have the bigger problem. Despite his repeated
warnings that nothing should be taken for granted, many Labour activists
are convinced they will form the next government. They have worked hard
and suffered much in the past two decades and there is an inevitable
tendency to deny the need to share the triumph with anyone. On that
question Mr Blair is careful to point out that any Labour government
must work to achieve the broadest possible basis of consent. This is an
attractive concept but it will not enthuse all local Labour activists,
nor those who remember the farcical and unlamented Lib-Lab pact. Despite
his relaxed attitude, Mr Blair may yet need the support of the Liberal
Democrats in one vital area. He has promised to deliver constitutional
change and a devolved parliament for Scotland in the first year of a
Labour administration. Depending on the electoral arithmetic, and the
enthusiasm or otherwise of some on his own side, this may be difficult
to fulfil. The Liberal Democrats are committed to these policies, but
can they, will they, dance?

I APPRECIATED the letters from Michael Nugent and Hugh McLaughlin
(April 26). I, too, have been puzzled and appalled at why you continue
to publish the self-indulgent, bigoted, wicket, and boring nonsense
penned by John Macleod. He's a disgrace to himself, his parents, and The
Herald.
Other writers make buying the paper very worth while -- Ian Bell,
Joyce McMillan, Julie Davidson et al.
However, I really must take issue with Michael Nugent when he suggests
John Macleod is after Jack McLean's position as the Prince of Diatribe.
McLean is never narrow, frequently puzzled and brave, and so very often
amusing.
He can say when he is wrong and is to be relied on to amuse. Macleod
aspires to none of this.
If I were marooned on a desert island, seriously lonely and in dire
need of company (preferably male, for reasons I don't need to burden
this page with), and McLean and Macleod came ashore, I'd throw Macleod
back and welcome McLean.
Who needs an opinionated, humourless, inexperienced, narrow chap
fixated on himself? Not I.

Ruth Wishart examines the travails of Scottish Ballet which led to the
departure of its chief executive and the break-up of a formidable double
act.
OFFICIALLY he leaves Scottish Ballet tomorrow after seven years. But
Peter Kyle's tenure as chief executive effectively came to an end three
weeks before, when the board met to take some crucial decisions about
the future direction of the company.
Before them were two choices -- to continue largely as before with an
essentially classical repertoire and an unchanged structure, or to adopt
a strategy document drawn up for them by Kyle which would have broadened
the focus and incorporated a commitment to more innovative and
experimental work alongside that core product.
Board members were already familiar with the detail of that strategy.
Indeed, they had approved it in principle over the months of its
development, following a detailed analysis of previous productions and
future prospects. So in theory the meeting that day could have been seen
as nothing more than a formal acceptance of what had been discussed
before.
Instead, for reasons which might never be entirely clear, the board
appeared to suffer a late and fatal bout of cold feet, and rejected the
planning document. So we must assume that it was at that moment that
Peter Kyle decided his future must lie elsewhere. But it is also
legitimate to wonder just how the board envisage the company's future
based largely on the status quo.
Those people inside and outside of Scottish Ballet who have listened
to Peter Kyle over the past few years know that he saw great dangers in
the company not being prepared to diversify. His contention always was
that the market-place for large companies specialising in the fairly
small repertoire of classical work still regularly performed, was both
small and overcrowded.
And he thought that if Scottish Ballet wanted to bring in new
audiences, new clients, and, crucially perhaps, new sources of funding,
then it had, to some extent, to reinvent itself and become distinctively
different.
It is an argument which other successful companies have certainly
taken on board, not least outfits like Ballet Rambert, now much lauded
after its second reincarnation. Nor should anyone suppose that a company
prepared to give an important platform to modern and challenging work
need jettison its classical base, nor the level of training that
implies. Hugely successful operations like the Mark Morris group rarely
employ dancers without that classical training.
But there are other imperatives outside the need for ballet companies
to anticipate the future and embrace it with enthusiasm, rather than
suspicion. Scottish Ballet, like all Scotland's national arts companies,
is endlessly seeking more funding from the Scottish Arts Council, and
endlessly being told that the major players in the game cannot be
allowed to gobble any more of the cake.
But there is considerable evidence to suggest that a differently
structured Scottish Ballet, offering a broader product range, would have
been viewed by the SAC in a much more flattering light.
Looking back over the Kyle years at those productions he introduced,
you get a preliminary flavour of the mix he would have favoured for the
future: Petrushka as well as Midsummer Night's Dream, Pretty Ugly as
well as Peter Pan; works like Forgotten Land, Overgrown Path, Wildlife
One and Concerto Barocco.
Given that his role became increasingly administrative, it is perhaps
easy for some people to forget his own background in dance and
choreography; perhaps easy to forget, too, that when he first arrived
Scottish Ballet was substantially in the red to the tune of over a
quarter of a million pounds.
Making the books balance proved a painful process, and probably did
very little for Kyle's street credibility among the dancers. Yet the
most damaging dispute over the past few years -- the row over payment
for classes -- which almost resulted in full-scale industrial action,
probably had more to do with the attitude of the artistic director than
the chief executive.
Galina Samsova was brought up in a hard school. When she trained in
Russia classes were viewed as a privileged opportunity for further
tuition, rather than an imposition eating into leisure time. It was
undoubtedly difficult for Galina to make that cultural transition in her
own psyche.
And it is going to be difficult for her in the immediate future, given
that Peter Kyle seems to be going to be replaced by a general manager
style figure who will not be part of the creative process. Neither does
it seem likely that Galina, without the urgings of Kyle, will see any
particular reason to push the company in new directions.
Galina Samsova brought a great deal to the company when she arrived
four years ago; not least a sprinkling of stardust from a woman with an
international reputation and a superb pedigree. But when her current
contract comes to an end in December 1996, she will not be far off 60.
The company will have to face the prospect of constructing a
transition to her successor which will recognise her immense
contribution, yet establish the right connections with dancers and
choreographers who will be the most marketable commodities, five and 10
years down the line. Given the disastrously managed departure of Elaine
MacDonald, the company should realise it cannot afford another public
relations horror on that scale.
From the outside, it seems one of the simplest ways of managing that
transition would have been that proposed within the new strategy
document. That would have allowed a resident choreographer to take on
the modern dance strand working with Galina and, if successful,
ultimately succeeding her.
That plan has now comprehensively unravelled. Since the board have
declined to comment and Peter Kyle, it would appear, has been prevented
from doing so, we can only speculate about the motivation of those
people who have had such a sudden and comprehensive change of heart.
Perhaps they were scared of change itself, given the recent and
lucrative success of Swan Lake. After all, classical blockbusters make
good box office. Perhaps they took fright at the thought of a
restructuring which might have meant a technical demise, then formal
rebirth, of an organisation barely finished with its silver jubilee
celebrations; or perhaps, more mundanely, it was nothing more original
than a bit of boardroom power broking.
The chair of Scottish Ballet,  the normally energetic Countess of
Dalkeith, has sat out most of this drama, having been laid low by a
viral infection. In her absence her deputy, Oona Ivory, has been in
charge, and accompanied Peter Kyle and another board member to Hull to
tell the company of his resignation.
Who knows what might have happened without these unpredictable twists
of personal fate. What is certain is that over the past few  years,
Elizabeth Dalkeith and Peter Kyle have proved a formidable double act. I
rather suspect they may again.

AMERICANS remain obsessed with the Vietnam War, which ended 20 years
ago tomorrow. For them, it is the defining national trauma of the past
50 years: notice the slightly sick coincidence that they are
commemorating simultaneously the 50th anniversary of the greatest of
victories, and the 20th anniversary of America's sole, unequivocal
defeat.
Things look different from Hanoi. For the Vietnamese, the American
intervention was one episode in a long calvary. Their war began when the
Japanese marched into the country in 1941 and continued, with one brief
interruption, for 34 years. Three years later, they began a nine-years'
war in Cambodia.
The Americans lost 55,000 men. Vietnam lost 600,000 between 1945 and
1954, in the war with France, and something between one and two million
between the resumption of the war, in 1962, and its end in 1975 -- and
another 50,000 in Cambodia.
It looks different in Cambodia, too -- the country that has suffered
more than any other in the contemporary world. No-one knows how many
were slaughtered by the Khmers Rouges between their victory in 1975 and
1978, when the Vietnamese drove them into the jungle, but estimates
range from one to two million. The second figure would be a quarter of
the population.
Americans who return to Vietnam now discover, with surprise, that the
Vietnamese do not appear to harbour any extreme bitterness against them.
On the contrary, they are as eager to adopt American ways and enjoy
American prosperity as the recently liberated citizens of Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
Perhaps it is a matter of Oriental fatalism, their natural resilience,
or the self-inflicted sufferings of Stalinism that reduced Vietnam to
one of the poorest countries in the world (its per capita income is
about a third that of Haiti). Perhaps it is simply that they won. They
defeated the greatest power on earth and can afford to forget the past.
Meanwhile, in the United States, the hostility between those who
supported the war and those who opposed it erupts periodically, and the
memory of that signal defeat still presses upon American consciousness.
American involvement in Indochina began with Eisenhower. His Secretary
of State, John Foster Dulles, wanted to use the A-bomb to save the
French from defeat. Eisenhower turned down the idea.
When the new Vietcong insurgency against the South Vietnamese
Government, headed by President Ngo Dinh Diem, began in the early
sixties, President Kennedy sent ''advisers'' and limitless supplies of
arms to help.
Diem was killed in a coup on November 1, 1963. Kennedy was
assassinated three weeks later: at the time of his death there were
about 21,000 American soldiers in Vietnam and there has been a long
debate ever since whether he would have withdrawn from the quagmire, or
plunged further into it.
Lyndon Johnson plunged ahead. It was clear that Saigon must fall
unless there was massive American intervention. In 1964, there was a new
coup nearly every month. In the election campaign in 1964, Johnson
promised to keep American boys out of Vietnam, while preparing to break
the promise.
The occasion was provided in August, 1964, by the Gulf of Tonkin
incident, a murky episode in which Communist gunboats apparently fired
on the American fleet. Johnson pushed a resolution through the Senate,
the nearest approximation to a declaration of war (just two senators
opposed it), and sent the Marines ashore at Danang in the spring of
1965.
There were a few battles: at Khe San, in the north; along the border
with North Vietnam; in the Tet Offensive in February, 1968.
The Americans won them all -- and lost the war. Short of invading and
occupying the North, they could not stop it sending supplies (obtained
from China and Russia) to the Vietcong. They built up the South
Vietnamese army and Government into something resembling coherent
institutions and a fighting force, but they were never strong enough to
withstand the northerners.
The ''best and the brightest'' of the Americans all supported Johnson
and the war, to begin with. So did the great majority of Americans; but
the tide turned quickly as American casualties mounted and the Pentagon
could promise only more of the same, and demanded ever larger numbers of
soldiers. The war became a Moloch, devouring America's youth.
Johnson retired from politics, defeated by the war's rising
unpopularity. His successor, Richard Nixon, claimed that he could
withdraw from South Vietnam with honour and dignity, leaving behind a
government that could defend itself against the Communist North.
The Communists signed an agreement to that effect in January, 1973,
after a last frightful American air assault on Hanoi. The South
Vietnamese protested that they were being abandoned. Nixon promised that
the B-52s would return if the North broke the treaty, and attacked. The
withdrawal, and the return of prisoners, was completed in the spring of
1973.
Immediately afterwards, Nixon himself was engulfed in the Watergate
scandal. Early in 1975, the Communists began their last offensive. By
then, with Nixon driven from office, there was no chance of America
rushing to the rescue. On April 12, the American ambassador to Cambodia
escaped in a helicopter from his embassy carrying the flag in a plastic
bag.
On the 29th, while Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, was playing golf in
California, it was the turn of the ambassador to Saigon. He, too, had to
be rescued from the roof of his embassy -- one of a terrified mass of
refugees who fled the North Vietnamese.
Early the following morning, the last Marines were lifted off the
embassy roof by helicopter, and then a North Vietnamese tank, after
losing its way in down-town Saigon, found the presidential palace,
blasted down the gates and arrested the last president of South Vietnam.
It was a melodramatic end to a long and painful conflict.
Vietnam had been divided by the Americans and Chinese, in 1954, to
prevent Ho Chi Minh's Communists from conquering the whole country.
After defeating the French at Dien Bien Phu, they had occupied Hanoi and
were ready to march south. They completed the operation 21 years later.
The Chinese role in the Geneva conference of 1954 was particularly
noteworthy, though most people missed it at the time. The Korean War was
barely over, but they were already prepared to cut a deal with the
Americans, at the expense of their Vietnamese allies.
The British, who still counted for something in the world, and the
Russians, played supporting roles at Geneva. By the time the war ended,
Britain had subsided into irrelevance, and the hostility between the
Soviet Union and China was one of the key factors in world politics: at
the height of the Vietnam war, Brezhnev consulted the Americans about
using nuclear weapons against China, to stop it developing nuclear
weapons of its own.
That was part of the diplomatic story of the war. It was always
obscure and badly understood. The fighting was only too easy to follow.
It was the first televised war. Camera crews accompanied the soldiers
into the field and on patrol, and their reports were broadcast within 36
hours in the United States.
Americans in their homes, for the first time, saw the true face of
war. Would the Germans still have supported Hitler if they had seen film
from Stalingrad, or would any of the warring nations have continued the
war in 1916 if they had seen film of Verdun or the Somme? At any event,
the sights and the reporting from Vietnam sickened America with war.
There has been a strong opposition to foreign entanglements ever since.
In another respect, it was a conventional enough conflict: the
Americans applied overwhelming technical superiority, hoping it would
bring them victory. The same correlation of forces succeeded in the
Persian Gulf war. It failed in Indochina.
The Americans bombed military targets in North and South Vietnam. They
used defoliants to kill the vegetation so that they might see their
enemies, reducing a third of South Vietnam to a brown, rotting wasteland
of dead trees.
They poured billions of dollars' worth of equipment into South Vietnam
and Cambodia, to arm the two governments, and at the peak of the war, in
1968, there were about 540,000 American troops there or in the Navy
off-shore. The war came home to the Americans in 1970. On April 30 that
year, American and Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in an attempt to
clear out the North Vietnamese military ''sanctuaries'' just across the
border.
The demonstrations against the war reached their paroxysm at Kent
State University, a small institution in Ohio, where a nervous governor
brought in the National Guard to control the scene on May 4. They opened
fire on the demonstrating students, killing four of them.
It looked as though the country was on the verge of collapse. There
was a huge army of demonstrators in Washington, closing down the city,
laying siege to the Pentagon. President Nixon went out in the middle of
the night to talk to some of the student demonstrators, camped around
the Lincoln Memorial. He learned nothing from that bizarre encounter.
The war continued for another two years and the opposition continued to
demonstrate.
The argument persists. Bill Clinton is the most prominent of those who
refused to be drafted -- or, in his case, successfully used the system
to escape the draft. Newt Gingrich, Republican Speaker of the House,
Senator Phil Gramm, who is running for the Republican presidential
nomination, and a great number of other prominent Americans, did the
same thing.
Robert McNamara, who was Secretary of Defence from 1961 to 1968, has
just published his memoirs, admitting at last that he knew the war was
unwinnable, as early as 1966, and that the only right course for the
United States was to get out.
Mr Clinton has noted that the revelation vindicates him: why should
young men go to war, and die, at the behest of old men who know that the
war is unwinnable, and will be lost? The huge number of veterans,
conservatives and Republicans, who detest Mr Clinton for a variety of
reasons, have yet to assimilate the argument.
The war had profound repercussions abroad. It stirred a frenzy of
anti-Americanism in Europe, which fuelled the left-wing terrorist
groups. The Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany, Action Directe in France,
the Red Brigades in Italy and lesser-known groups in other countries,
were all enraged by Vietnam and attacked American targets.
The movement reached a frenzy in France in May, 1968, when the
students in Paris took to the barricades against General de Gaulle --
even though he always opposed America's involvement in Vietnam.
The country was sick of the general, but the intellectual impetus for
the students' revolt was anti-Americanism. In Britain, the left wing of
the Labour Party used the Vietnam war as a rod to beat Harold Wilson's
Government.
Even though Wilson resolutely refused to send any British troops to
join Lyndon Johnson's crusade,he defended the Americans, and tried to
preserve good relations with Johnson because it was in Britain's
national interest to do so. Johnson's Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, a
passionate Anglophile, lamented in public that all he needed was a
battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to demonstrate
Britain's support.
Johnson never forgave Wilson's refusal, and the Prime Minister's
left-wing critics never forgave him for defending Johnson verbally while
resisting him in practice. The party shifted left afterwards, with
disastrous effect to itself.
So far, Americans have not become reconciled with history or with each
other. They are still fighting the war, mourning the defeat, blaming the
government, or liberals and Democrats, for corrupting the ancient
American verities.
They could learn something from the Vietnamese, who are following
China's example and abandoning communism -- and in the process of
preparing for the twenty-first century, have no time to look back in
anguish.

With their leather jackets and mean machines they may look like Hell's
Angels to the uninitiated. But they're not. These are members of a
growing band of custom bikers whose idea of heaven is to spend dark
winter days stripping down and rebuilding their bikes and the long
summer days out on the road. Peter Evans finds out what gets their
motors running
IF THEY walked into the bar where you were drinking you'd probably
leave. At the very least you'd flinch and think about it. After all,
ripped jeans, leather jackets, shaven heads, ponytails, and dark glasses
hardly suggest that the characters you're looking at are there for a
quiet game of dominoes in the corner, sipping halves of lager.
Yet appearances can be mightily deceptive. John Maughan recalls being
escorted out of Callander by the police, who had arrived in two vans
with dogs.
John and his mates had been in and out of the pubs, mingling with
visitors, when the boys in blue turned up. ''They realised there were a
lot of bikers in town and they just presumed there was going to be
trouble, but there wasn't,'' says John.
He's one of a growing band of custom bikers who will be taking to
Scotland's roads again now better weather has arrived. Winter will have
been spent making the desired conversions to their lovingly cared for
machines. Summer is the time for display; for attending rallies and
having a good time -- generally without serious incident.
''In most cases there's less trouble than you would see at a rave,''
says Maughan, a member of the Minehoff Club, based in Haddington, East
Lothian, where he lives, but drawing members from as far afield as
Northumberland and the Borders.
The club's custom-bike contingent tends towards ''older'' riders,
typically in their mid-twenties and upwards. Custom bikers have outgrown
the desire for speed alone, and those who own ''choppers'', as they call
their machines, contemptuously refer to the speed merchants' standard
models as ''plastic superbikes''.
Maughan, 28, originally from Mull but brought up in Edinburgh, has
always had a passion for motorbikes. He started work in a bike shop and
eventually bought his first ''chop'' in the mid eighties.
Now he runs his own business connected mainly -- you've guessed it --
with motorbikes. He specialises in powder coating -- an industrial
process which applies a durable coloured finish, much harder than paint,
to metal. It's ideal for custom bikers who want to give their machines a
distinctive colour. Some paint elaborate murals on to their bikes;
others hate the sight of them.
This is a complex world of likes and dislikes in all things, not just
the colour of the bike, and in the course of researching this article I
only scratched the surface. There are enough subcultures and divisions
on the main theme here to keep a sociologist happy for years. You can
see the book title now: ''Deviance and Social Control Among Users of
Two-Wheeled Mechanical Devices''.
The intriguing thing about these characters is that they are on a fine
line between nonconformity and the complete acceptance of societal norms
which goes along with families, mortgages, jobs, and the rest. The
impression of anarchy created by their outward appearance belies
reality.
''Members in my club don't want to conform totally, but they are not
the sort of people who can walk out of their jobs and go away and do
things without a care in the world,'' says Maughan. As a young
businessman, he is a case in point.
The air of semi-respectability that pervades the biking scene is not
universal. There are the ''outlaw'' clubs, whose standards of behaviour
are much more fearsome. They are, however, in a minority, and feared as
much by the majority of bikers as by the general public. Custom biking
is all about obsession with the machine -- making it look the way you
want; individualising it. Starting with a frame, other parts are added,
including the engine, until the desired effect is achieved. Those with
the necessary skill even make the frame itself.
But it doesn't end there. Modifying and changing the appearance of the
bike is a constant process, with riders going as far as taking the whole
thing to pieces again during the winter and starting over to create a
new bike. The averaged finished article can be worth anything from #2000
to #2500.
Fuelled by the raw edged, raunchy magazines that cater for it, like
Back Street Heroes and AWOL, the interest in custom biking has grown,
says Maughan, while the number of motorbikes sold in general has
declined since a boom period in the 1970s.
From June 23 to 25, ''Beyond the Golf Ball'', the biggest custom-bike
show in Scotland will be held at Balado Airfield, near the Tayside
village of Milnathort.
It's right on the doorstep for Brian Richmond, who lives in the
village and epitomises the obsession dyed-in-the-wool enthusiasts have
for motorcycles. Richmond, who takes pictures and writes for the
custom-bike magazines, has suffered a catalogue of accidents which have
left him badly disabled.
Like most youngsters leaving school with an interest in motorbikes,
Richmond, now 31, wanted one that would go as fast as possible. To begin
with, he had to make do with a 50cc moped, used to travel to and from
work as an apprentice mechanic in Perth. ''It was so boringly slow I
fell asleep on it a couple of times and ended up in a ditch,'' he said.
Once turned 17 he was old enough to ride a 250cc machine.
''These things can do 115mph,'' said Richmond. ''Up to 100mph it would
outdo a Porsche 911 on acceleration. For somebody who had just left
school it was absolutely ridiculous.'' The first accident came inside a
week, before the bike had clocked 500 miles. Richmond got off lightly
with hurt pride. Then a second incident left him with his leg in plaster
after colliding with a car near Bridge of Earn.
Worse was to come. With the leg still in plaster, negotiating a bend
on the way home to Milnathort, the bike's front tyre blew out at speed.
Richmond was catapulted 100 metres down the road and into a fence. His
injuries included a broken neck and he had a blood clot on the brain.
''I was out of hospital in two months and it took a year to get back
to full fitness,'' he said. Another survival story and his parents
forbade him from having another motorbike.
Ironically, it was a car accident which left him permanently disabled.
He was on the way to a party with friends when the car skidded off the
road and Richmond was thrown from the back seat through the windscreen.
A second broken neck left him a quadraplegic for a month after the
accident. Movement to his arms and legs returned, but the limbs had been
injured badly enough to leave him disabled.
Although unable to ride motorbikes, however, his passion for them
remains undiminished and he owns and rides two very powerful motor
trikes, one of them worth #5500.
In America they have been popular for some years, says Richmond, and
they are ''all the rage'' south of the Border it seems, but in Scotland
they are few and far between.
''They are the ultimate posing machines,'' says Richmond, whose zest
for life and custom bikes is undiminished by his experiences.
''It makes a much more determined person of you,'' he says. Like John
Maughan, he's looking forward to a summer of enjoyment with like-minded
companions in a social world that remains a mystery to the uninitiated.
* Scotland's biggest custom-bike show, Beyond the Golf Ball (named
after a local landmark), takes place at Balado Airfield, near Kinross,
from June 23-25.

HELEN Mirren and I go way back. It's just that she doesn't know it. A
few years ago they were filming a scene from Charlie Gormley's romantic
comedy, Heavenly Pursuits, in the cuttings library of this very
newspaper. During a break Helen, with co-star Tom Conti, popped
downstairs to the pub for a drink. And we watched.
The lady picked up her glass of white wine, took a solitary sip,
grimaced, and left it lying on the bar. Not to her cultured taste,
obviously. Seconds after her departure a Herald journalist, a very sad
man who's name would be familiar to you, casually wandered over, drained
Helen's glass and pocketed it. It sits atop his filing cabinet, unwashed
and with the lipstick stain still around the rim. A trophy of sorts.
It is not the only one. Lying in some storeroom of this building is a
huge wooden table (formerly used by the library staff) which, for a
while, became something of a shrine to Ms Mirren. Its greatest claim to
fame is the fact that, in the aforesaid movie, it was the very spot
where Helen and Tom consummated their relationship. Not to put too fine
a point upon it, they made love upon the cuttings edge. As you have
probably gathered, the lady made something of an impression during her
brief visit to The Herald.
Helen Mirren is the kind of women of whom a chap's dreams are made.
Not only is she as fine an actress as Britain has produced in many a
long year, she is also a wonderful object of desire. Not classically
beautiful, you understand. But possessed of certain qualities --
intelligence, sexuality, sensuality, and a tangible attraction for any
hot-blooded male -- which make her rather special in the scheme of
things.
This week she is back as Superintendent Jane Tennison, the testy and
determined crime squad boss, in a new series of Prime Suspect (Sunday,
ITV). So all is well with the world. Granada, riding high in the drama
stakes these days with the enormously successful Band of Gold just
finished, and a new series of the Bafta award-winning Cracker in the
pipeline, have boldly gone and changed the format somewhat.
Past Prime Suspects have been one-off dramas of four-hour duration,
split over two nights. This time we have three separate two-hour
episodes shown over three weeks, each a self-contained story but with a
running theme. Not a series and not a serial, really, but a loose
trilogy of crime thrillers.
The theme is essentially Tennison herself. The dramas concentrate more
upon her private life . . . her career problems, her personal dilemmas,
her romantic relationships. Behind this tough, ice-cold, ambitious
police chief lies an emotional woman. In the past she has kept these
emotions in check (for fear that, in the predominately male world in
which she works, they will be regarded as a feminine chink in her
armour), but in the new series they come more to the surface.
Tomorrow night's opener is a powerful, sometimes harrowing, story
which involves paedophilia and child -- no, baby -- abduction. It is
compulsive but it does not make for comfortable viewing. It is a strong
drama with a palpable sense of purpose. It is, however, somewhat
predictable. Even I (and in our household I am infamous for failing
miserably with whodunnits) guessed the solution early on. The villain is
just a tad too obvious and the problem is that, once you eliminate him,
there is but one other possibility.
Nevertheless, the drama has a great deal going for it. The acting is
impeccable, the direction perfectly-paced, and the narrative superbly
unnerving. A few weeks ago, in its annual review, the Independent
Broadcasting Authority (with some justification, it has to be said)
counselled the network against ''playing safe''. ITV, it said, should be
prepared to take more chances with new drama instead of relying too much
on the usual tried-and-tested serials.
Well, they do not come more tried-and-tested than Prime Suspect -- but
long may it continue. It is arguably Granada's most successful drama to
date. In addition to its critical acclaim, it has achieved astonishing
commercial success. The first four series have been sold to 56
countries, most recently Russia and China; it has picked up 10
international and 15 domestic awards, winning an Emmy Award two years in
succession for best mini-series.
At a time when ITV (and the BBC, for that matter) show a slightly
worrying trend towards the making of designer drama simply as product,
it is comforting to know that the programme makers can still produce a
cutting edge, thought-provoking, series like Prime Suspect. Quite
simply, no-one does it better.
There is irony in the first taut episode, The Lost Child, which opens
low-key with Superintendent Tennison admitting herself to hospital for
an abortion. In an excellent piece of understated acting, Mirren's
expression displays the pain caused by her decision to terminate the
unwanted pregnancy.
On her (indecently hasty) return to work she is thrust into the
disturbing case of a single mum's infant who has disappeared after an
apparent break-in. As Tennison's team investigates the abduction, making
links with paedophile organisations, the finger of suspicion falls upon
a child sex offender (Robert Glenister). The more the detective becomes
involved with the distraught mother, the more she is forced to consider
her own personal loss.
The new trilogy also sees Tennison develop a romantic relationship
with criminal psychologist Patrick Schofield (Stuart Wilson) which,
eventually, is brought into conflict between her obsession with her job
and the new demands of her private life.
Helen Mirren explained: ''I was very keen that, rather than it being a
series of whodunnits, there should be some kind of sense of continuum of
the life of Jane Tennison running through the three stories.
''People say that Tennison does not exist in the police force -- and
I'm sure that's true. But she will. I think she is a clarion call for
the future. The great importance of this kind of drama series is that
you constantly broaden perceptions of what either the sexes or the races
are capable of. I think, as far as women are concerned, that Prime
Suspect has done a great service.
''I never wanted it to be a propaganda feminist piece. I think that's
always boring. It's much better to do it through the characters and the
subtlety of the writing.''
She genuinely believes that, since the first series in 1991, Prime
Suspect has affected the way women are perceived in Britain today. ''It
came out at the perfect time. It was right on target in people's
consciousness. Already, four years later, people's attitudes have
changed a lot, but I think the same problems still exist at a
grass-roots level -- a lot of which has to do with childcare.
''It's an important issue that we have to come to grips with, because
the reality is that women are working; they want to work and they are
not going to stop. I think people have got to really think seriously
what childcare is. Company and governmental attitudes have got to change
as well.''
Her character's romantic relationship with Schofield, the criminal
psychologist, develops through the three stories. ''It's the first time
that she's really been wrong-footed in a relationship,'' explained
Mirren. ''Through him she questions the obsessional nature of her
attitude to her work and whether that's really such a great idea. In
actual fact, all she does is behave like a man. She's not obsessional;
she just behaves like all men do with their work -- which is to put it
before any relationship, basically.''
* FUNNY business, comedy. Then again, sometimes it's not. Personally,
I'd rather get my teeth out without anaesthetic than watch The Smell of
Reeves and Mortimer (Friday, BBC2). God knows I've tried, but I cannot
for the life of me find anything remotely amusing in the surreal antics
of this pair of very sad Geordies.
Humour of an infinitely superior variety can be seen earlier the same
night on BBC1 with the first in a quirky new series, Paul Merton's Life
of Comedy, in which the the comic indulges his life-long obsession with
British funnymen. Now you're talking humour.
What you have is essentially a short history of British television
comedy, cunningly disguised as a sitcom. Merton has trawled the archives
for legendary clips -- everything from Arthur Haynes to Pete and Dud --
and linked them with comic scenes from his fictionalised childhood.
* THE excellent Michael Elphick makes a welcome -- though sadly final
-- return as ex-fireman and self-styled private detective Ken Boon this
week. The series started in 1986 but ended three years ago when Elphick
moved on to Harry, Neil Morrissey (Rocky) to Men Behaving Badly, and
David Daker (Harry Crawford) to Crown Prosecutor.
Now, as if by magic, ITV have searched the vaults and found an episode
which has never been seen before (it wasn't edited in time for the last
series). In Boon -- The Last Episode (Monday, ITV), Crawford Boon
Security are asked to prove the innocence of a jailed man. They also
find themselves handling the security for a country fair while
investigating the theft of some priceless porcelain.

Wellington, Friday
FOURTEEN people plunged 100ft to their deaths today when a cliffside
viewing platform collapsed in the remote West Coast region of New
Zealand's South Island.
The victims were dashed to death on rocks at the bottom of a deep
limestone shaft where water flows into an underground cavern at the
Paparoa National Park.
Police said four people were taken to hospital in the nearby town of
Greymouth suffering serious injuries after an arduous rescue operation.
The victims were from a party of students, accompanied by national
park rangers, who were visiting Cave Creek on a geology field trip in
the rugged coastal park.
''Once it tilted, the platform then collapsed on top of those persons,
who'd fallen 100 or so feet and landed on rocks,'' senior police
sergeant Phil Deazley said.
A police statement said 17 students and one ranger were standing on
the platform when it gave way.
Five other people, lagging slightly behind the main group, heard ''a
loud crash and thump, followed by screams''. They rushed to the scene
and saw that the wooden platform had tumbled into the chasm.
Prime Minister Jim Bolger expressed his condolences to the victims'
families and announced an independent inquiry into New Zealand's worst
disaster for nearly 30 years.
Officials at the Department of Conservation said the wooden platform
was about 10ft square, overhanging the edge by about a yard and secured
by beams.
The tragedy happened in rugged, thickly forested country, hindering
access for emergency services.
Rescuers rushed to the scene after a witness ran several miles to
raise the alarm.--Reuter.

A SCOTTISH-based doctor who performed an autopsy on a Palestinian
prisoner held by Israel claimed yesterday that it was clear the man's
death had been caused by torture.
Dr Derrick Pounder, Professor of Forensic Medicine at Dundee
University, told The Herald in an exclusive interview last night: ''As
far as I know this is the first absolutely clear-cut case where there
can be no debate that this is a death as the result of torture and
nothing else.''
Abd a-Samed Harizat, a 30-year-old Palestinian from Hebron who died on
Tuesday, was the first Arab to die in detention since Israel relaxed
interrogation rules for the Shin Bet secret police last year.
Palestinians in Hebron said he was known to support the Muslim militant
Hamas movement.
The autopsy was performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel
Aviv by two Israeli pathologists and Dr Pounder, 46, who was brought in
as an independent pathologist by the family.
Police have declined to comment on a charge by a human rights group
that Harizat suffered blows to the head while in Shin Bet custody.
Dr Pounder, who has long had an interest in human rights work, said
Israeli pathologists who attended the autopsy agreed with his findings.
Speaking from his hotel in Jerusalem last night, Dr Pounder said of
the autopsy: ''At the present time, we haven't released details of the
findings at the request of the Israeli authorities because there is an
ongoing criminal investigation into the interrogators, Shin Bet.
''But there is absolutely no doubt that natural disease played no part
in the death, that he died as a result of physical injury, that injury
was the result of torture, and that the method of torture is one
commonly used by the Shin Bet.''
Last November, a ministerial committee gave the Shin Bet more leeway
in questioning suspected Islamic militants after a rise in attacks on
Israelis.
An Israeli security source said Harizat was a senior member of Hamas's
military wing and connected to three Hamas guerrillas killed last week
by Israeli forces in Hebron.
Dr Pounder, who is orginally from Pontypridd in south Wales but has
lived and worked in Dundee since 1987, travelled to Israel yesterday and
returns to Scotland tomorrow.
He added: ''My ultimate hope is that the Israeli Government will
outlaw torture. The government has extended the rules of interrogation
under which the security services are able to use physical pressure and
this pressure has led to what myself and others believe to be simple
torture, affecting thousands of people.''
Dr Pounder's trip to Israel is being funded by Physicians for Human
Rights, an American organisation which promotes human rights worldwide
using the skills of the medical profession.
He has been to Israel twice before and also to South Africa, Nepal,
and Azerbaijan to carry out similar work.

Cincinatti, Friday
POLICE have launched an investigation into a television videotape that
shows a white police officer kicking and punching an 18-year-old black
man.
Police say the tape shows events taken out of context and does not
tell the whole story, but black leaders say the police response may have
been excessive.
''None of the information we have at this time suggests that the
beating we saw on that tape was appropriate,'' said Milton Hinton,
president of the Cincinnati branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP).
Police Captain Walter McAlpin said the tape was misleading, for
example, by not showing the crowd of 50 to 75 who saw the incident as
well as what went on before or afterwards.
The tape begins with a young black man in custody on a busy town
centre street on Tuesday. A police officer sprays mace on the suspect as
several other police cars arrive. The suspect is then wrestled to the
ground by a group of four or five officers who direct punches and kicks
at him.
A white police officer, who threw most of the punches, moves toward
the crowd on the pavement and shoves one bystander who had been yelling
at him over a planter, the film shows. The suspect is then handcuffed
and thrown into the back of a police car.
One officer has been transferred to a desk job while police
investigate. The 18-year-old high school student was charged with
disorderly conduct, felonious assault, and resisting arrest.

EXCLUSIVE
SERIOUS structural cracking has occurred in reactors belonging to
Nuclear Electric.
An independent expert has claimed they were caused by the company
running them at full power in the run-up to privatisation.
However, the English-based company -- which faces a likely merger with
Scottish Nuclear and then a sell-off -- denies that cracks in welds in
the pipework of both reactors at Heysham 1 in Lancashire and Dungeness
in Kent are due to operating beyond safe limits.
Last week, both Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGRs) at Heysham 1 were
shut down after the discovery that cracks in the high-pressure steam
pipework on one reactor had grown at a rate greater than expected.
A confidential report by Nuclear Electric's director of technology,
dated October 17, 1994, and handed to The Herald, identifies the
company's own fears.
The director reports his concerns over ''reheat cracking in thick
section butt welds in the steam headers'' at Heysham 1.
He says: ''More importantly, the same phenomenon has been observed at
Dungeness B R21 and this is leading to concerns that such cracking is
occuring in non-inspectable pipework for which incredibility of failure
is claimed. This is a serious threat to continued operation.''
Last night, independent nuclear consultant Dr John Large claimed the
cracking in both reactors was due to Nuclear Electric operating them
beyond safe limits to gain maximum output and profitability in the
run-up to privatisation.
''The company has admitted the cracks in the thick welds but they
didn't expect cracking in the thin-walled tubes entering the header,''
he said.
''There is now the real possibility that these cracks extend into the
tail pipes which are encased five feet inside a concrete lining in the
reactor -- referred to as 'the non-inspectable pipework'.
''Nuclear Electric have been trying to persuade the Nuclear
Inspectorate that this has not happened, as the result would be a
complete shutdown and dismantling of the entire boilers which would cost
the company mega-bucks.''
Dr Large claimed the cracking was due to the company running the
reactors at full power for 18 months.
Dr Large's claims were supported by a Nuclear Electric technician, who
told The Herald the company knew about the cause of the cracking but
kept quiet about it to the sensitive nature of the privatisation and
merger process.
Mr Tony Benn MP, the former Labour Energy Secretary responsible for
overseeing the commissioning of many British nuclear facilities, last
night warned that safety of all reactors was at stake under
privatisation.

A POLICE constable told a murder jury yesterday how he broke the news
to his parents on Christmas Day that his younger brother had been
arrested in connection with a man's death.
Constable Edwin Mackie, 25, said he was on duty when he learned that
his brother Iain, 24, had been detained.
Mr Mackie has denied murdering Mr Hewie Noble in his home at Broomhall
Drive, Edinburgh.
He is alleged to have seized hold of Mr Noble by the neck, repeatedly
punched him, and repeatedly struck and stabbed him on the head and body
with knives.
Constable Mackie said he had seen his brother, who worked in a
hospital pharmacy, at about 7pm on Christmas Eve at their parents' home
in Victor Park Terrace, in Edinburgh, before he himself went for a night
out.
The policeman told defence counsel Neil Murray QC that he was
surprised when police searching his brother's bedroom after his
detention found a Gay Scotland magazine and a gay mail-order catalogue.
He said that if his brother had homosexual leanings he had kept them to
himself.
Their father, Edwin senior, a 49-year-old projects manager, said he
and his wife went out on Christmas Eve and Iain was still at home when
they returned about 11pm. He did not see his younger son the next
morning but thought he was still at home.
Shortly after 10am on Christmas Day, however, his son Edwin arrived
with another police officer. They told him that a man called Hewie Noble
had been killed and it was in that connection Iain had been detained.
The trial, before Lord Milligan, continues.

A FORMER Gulf war hostage, taken prisoner when her plane landed in
Kuwait hours after the Iraqi invasion, has lost a #100,000 damages
action against British Airways.
At the Court of Session, Mrs Judith Abnett, who lives in Tadley, near
Basingstoke, Hampshire, said her flight landed in Kuwait early on August
2, 1990.
She alleged that on the day of the flight's departure from Heathrow to
Kuala Lumpur via the middle East, British Airways advised 15 members of
the Kuwait Royal Family to cancel their seats on the aircraft.
She also claimed that 32 members of the SAS, bound for a covert
operation in Kuwait, boarded the plane two minutes before it took off
and that other passengers should have been given a chance to disembark
at Heathrow.
BA denied SAS men were on board and said it was advised by British
Embassy staff at Kuwait on August 1 that there was no imminent risk of
an invasion.
Mrs Abnett was one of a number of passengers taken prisoner by the
Iraqis and was claiming damages for nervous shock and mental distress
she says she suffered as a result of her capture.
In December 1993, Lord Marnoch dismissed the case against BA.
He said the situation was governed by the 1929 Warsaw Convention on
international carriage by air which was now incorporated in the 1961
Carriage By Air Act.
This stated that an airline was liable for damage sustained in the
event of death, wounding, or bodily injury suffered by a passenger and
it could not be said that Mrs Abnett had suffered any bodily injury as a
result of an accident.
Mrs Abnett, who was held captive for about a month, argued that Lord
Marnoch was wrong in ruling the Warsaw Convention was the exclusive
source of legal remedies for airline passengers injured in transit.
Yesterday, however, Lords Allanbridge, Mayfield, and Clyde, rejected
her claim that she was entitled to sue at common law for injuries
arising outwith the areas covered by the convention.
Lord Allanbridge said the convention applied to all international
carriage of people by air and it was clear that where the convention
applied it excluded all claims at common law.

Washington, Friday
ONE casualty of the Oklahoma bomb is likely to be 20-year-old controls
on government excesses.
In the 1970s, President Nixon's counter-intelligence programme for
infiltrating and spying on left-wing groups became known, and the FBI
was subjected to new and rigorous controls.
The bureau now says that it is handicapped by these rules in
monitoring the activities of the right-wing militias who are obviously
the greatest threat to the country at the moment.
President Clinton and Republican leaders have announced new
anti-terrorism legislation and Washington is now heading back to the
days of J Edgar Hoover, the bureau's first and longest-serving director.
For many years, FBI agents infiltrated the American Communist Party,
the civil rights movement, and, later the anti-Vietnam War movement.
When Nixon's teams started infiltrating the Democratic party and
breaking into its offices, the Congress set up new rules for the bureau
and all other police agencies.
Mr Clinton wants the bureau to hire 1000 new anti-terrorism personnel
and to bring in the armed forces to help monitor the militias. He also
proposes that explosive materials be tagged with trace materials to
enable police to analyse the residue of explosions and discover where
they came from.
Mr Clinton insists that his proposals will not alter the rule that
police must be able to prove ''probable cause'' before tapping
telephones and instituting other means of surveillance against a
suspect. All the same, the administration wants to amend the 1986
Privacy Act to give police greater latitude in phone tapping.
The Republicans support the president's plans in general, though they
will write their own Bill to submit to Congress.
Some members want to liberate the FBI entirely from the shackles
imposed in the 1970s (they were partly lifted in 1983), and permit it to
infiltrate suspicious organisations as once it infiltrated socialist
discussion groups.
The opposition to the loosening of the rules comes from the
traditional civil libertarians, and also from the extreme right,
including some members of Congress, who want to protect their friends in
the militias from too close scrutiny.
Meanwhile, in the search for survivors of the blast today, volunteer
and firefighter crews were forced to abandon the area dubbed the ''pit''
when tons of concrete began caving in on them. The death toll stands at
110 and the number of missing was today lowered from an estimated 100 to
between 73 and 79.
Yesterday a judge said there was an ''indelible trail of evidence''
linking Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh to the crime. McVeigh, a
supporter of extreme right-wing militia groups who is being held without
bail, is the only suspect so far in custody.
* BARONESS Thatcher, speaking at a university in Arkansas last night,
criticised a meeting last month between President Bill Clinton and Sinn
Fein leader Gerry Adams, comparing Mr Adams to suspects in the Oklahoma
City blast.
''You can imagine how we felt when President Clinton received Gerry
Adams. You can imagine how he'd feel if we accepted the people who did
this in Oklahoma City,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>Chevron's #60m move</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978649283</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
OIL company Chevron is asking for a redetermination of the equity of
one of the world's largest offshore oil fields. The move could net
Chevron, Conoco, and BP more than #60m.
The three UK shareholders in the Statfjord field had a total equity of
14.5% in 1994 but believe they are entitled to a minimum increase of 1%.
Chevron has made the request in the light of extensive new data from a
3D seismic survey and 39 new wells since the last redetermination in
1991. It now believes there are substantial discrepancies from previous
interpretations of the field.
The field is operated for the owners by Statoil. Any new agreement
must be approved by both the UK and Norwegian Governments.
If owners fail to agree with the operator's results, an independent
expert can be appointed to evaluate the data and make a ruling.

THE first oil to come ashore from the West of Shetland will be shipped
to the Flotta terminal in Orkney -- a bitter blow to the islands whose
name has been adopted by the new province.
The announcement by BP that the oil from its Foinaven field would be
shipped to the Elf Enterprise Flotta terminal comes as a clear warning
to Shetland Islands Council and the Government that if they do not
reduce charges to make Sullom Voe competitive the terminal could have a
very short life expectancy.
The final decision by BP, itself one of the partners in the Sullom Voe
terminal, was based on cost. Sullom Voe could not compete with Flotta.
Also unable to compete was the Nigg terminal.
The announcement comes only two weeks after Shell/Esso announced that
they were spending #500,000 on a study to confirm the feasibility of
offshore loading to serve Brent and other fields when the current
contract expires in the year 2000.
Chevron, which operates the Ninian field and uses the second pipeline
into Sullom Voe, is also looking at the costs of using offshore loading
as opposed to a pipeline.
Oil analyst Tony Mackay, of Mackay Consultants in Inverness, said:
''This is excellent news for Flotta because Sullom Voe is nearer and was
the strong favourite. For Sullom Voe, it is a relatively small contract
and is not a serious blow in financial terms, but it must be worrying in
the long term.''
Sullom Voe currently handles around 832,000 barrels of oil a day from
the Brent and Ninian pipelines, while Flotta handles around 235,000 from
10 fields, including Piper and Claymore. Foinaven will reach peak
production in 1997 of around 85,000 barrels per day.
Last night, the convener of Shetland Islands Council, Canon Lewis
Shand Smith, said they had made progress in discussions with the
Scottish Office over the past three weeks and, although they had not won
the Foinaven contract, they were confident they could be competitive
enough to win future contracts.
BP's announcement yesterday said it was in the final stages of
negotiations with Elf Enterprise to sign a contract for a minimum of
five years.
0 Foinaven, which lies 190km west of Shetland, was discovered in 1992
and Government approval for its development was given late in 1994. The
project is now 40% complete and the first oil is scheduled for
production early next year.
The amount of oil so far discovered to the West of Shetland, or North
of Orkney as it may now be called, is insufficient to merit a pipeline
to a landfall so BP essentially had two options for shipping it from the
field.
The ''Rotterdam Option'' was for the dedicated small tankers to take
the oil direct to market, which would primarily have been north-west
Europe. The alternative was to shuttle it to one of the existing
terminals for short-term storage before subsequently transporting it by
much larger tanker wherever in the world it was required.
BP calculated that the opportunities offered by access to a global
market made the second option the best. The choice was then between
Flotta, Sullom Voe, and the Nigg terminal.
Mr Tom Fyfe, BP's deputy asset manager for the frontier province, said
all three terminals demonstrated they were technically capable of
providing the service and all were able to demonstrate an excellent
health and safety record.
''The decision therefore was primarily a commercial one and Flotta
clearly demonstrated to us it offered the best solution,'' he said.
Orkney Islands Council convener, Mr Hugh Halcro-Johnston, said: ''This
really is tremendous news for Flotta and for the Orkney community as a
whole. The super facilities we have in the islands have been
recognised.''
He said a pipeline to handle oil from the Atlantic fields was still a
priority.
A further 100 jobs are to be lost at Shell Expro as it reduces manning
levels in what it says are efforts to remain cost-effective and ensure a
long-term future in the North Sea. Over the past five years, staff
numbers have fallen from 5500 to 4300.
Meanwhile, a union leader claimed yesterday that a second big North
Sea oil contract had been lost to southern Europe in as many weeks.
The loss of a key BP multi-million pound fabrication order to Italy
comes on the heels of a major job going to Spain, claimed Mr James Gray.
Mr Gray, representing around 7500 workers in British fabrication
yards, said BP was using an Italian yard to build a key rig for
developing a cluster of four major oil and gas fields in the central
part of the North Sea, dubbed ETAP.
Two weeks ago, Mr Gray claimed that the Dragados yard in Spain would
build a 19,500-tonnes steel platform for the Britannia, the North Sea's
biggest undeveloped gasfield.
Both BP and US-owned Conoco, partners inBritannia with Chevron, deny
that the contracts have yet been placed.
Yesterday, BP's Jamie Jardine said in Aberdeen: ''No decision has been
taken over the award of orders for the Eastern Trough Area Project.''
More than half of the UK's 7500 oil-yard workers are employed in
Scottish yards but 1000 jobs are due to be shed at the two big yards at
Nigg and Ardersier in the Highlands over the next six weeks.

ONE of Scotland's most deprived housing schemes yesterday made its bid
for a slice of the lottery cake. Residents living in Easterhouse,
Glasgow, are asking for #13m from the Millennium Fund to build a
multi-use arts, education, and leisure centre.
In an attempt to ensure that as much of the money as possible stays
within the scheme, their submission emphasises that the centre would be
built by the long-term unemployed who would receive training and
apprenticeships under the supervision of Glasgow District Council.
Miss Marian Keogh, director of the Greater Easterhouse Initiative,
said: ''One of the problems we have here is that there are not enough
skilled people able to get jobs elsewhere. It is a problem for many
areas.
''The city council has a very good apprenticeship scheme and we hope
to put between 75-100 people on that. The majority of these would be
adult apprenticeships.''
The proposal, drawn up by the initiative, has already made it past the
first stage of the Millennium Commission selection process: ''Around
1500 competing projects from all over the UK have been whittled down to
800 who are now allowed to submit a bid,'' Miss Keogh said.
Miss Keogh described the Easterhouse bid as ''unique'', saying it had
the backing of all the leading agencies, Glasgow District Council
departments as well as support from the local community.
''Groups are struggling to get facilities and places to meet and
train. We know that people here want this centre and we want to change
the notorious image of this area.''

THE home-loans industry was warned yesterday it could face tighter
regulations over endowment mortgages.
The criticisms follow the pensions mis-selling scandal, where
commission-hungry salesmen sold inappropriate products to consumers.
Director General of Fair Trading, Sir Bryan Carsberg, questioned in a
new report whether mortgage choice ''might be unduly influenced by sales
commissions'' given that 60% of new mortgages were still
endowment-linked, when the balance of merit has shifted away from them
towards straight repayment mortgages.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) indicated that lower tax relief on
mortgage interest and reduced investment returns in a low-inflation
climate had lessened the attractions of endowment mortgages, which were
riskier than repayment loans. Endowments were more suitable for people
who already had some wealth behind them.
Sir Bryan called on mortgage lenders and financial advisers to provide
advice more tailored to the particular circumstances of homebuyers.
''We want to see advisers accepting an obligation to give a neutral
presentation to their customers of the advantages and alternatives,'' he
said.
Mortgages are not covered by the Financial Services Act. Sir Bryan
stopped short of recommending new legislation to protect homebuyers but
called on the mortgage industry to improve its practices or face tighter
regulation.
Lenders and advisers can receive #800 of commission from selling a
#50,000 endowment policy, and have in the past strongly pushed borrowers
to take out policies, though this pressure is less pronounced now. Sir
Bryan commented: ''I do detect a change in attitude in the industry.''
The OFT says the key points to bear in mind when considering an
endowment mortgage are likely investment growth, mortgage interest
rates, charges and early surrender penalties on endowment policies, and
the borrower's individual circumstances.
The report was welcomed by the Consumers' Association, though it still
considered mortgages should be legally regulated.

THE first people in Scotland to face prosecution under the Criminal
Justice Act were acquitted at Fort William Sheriff Court yesterday.
Three travellers were charged with illegally camping on
privately-owned land at Dengin, near Invergarry, between November 23 and
December 5 last year.
They denied forming a group for the purpose or failing to leave the
land when directed to do so.
They faced maximum charges of a fine of #2500 or three months in
prison.
However, there were cheers when Sheriff Frederick Levine accepted a
submission by defence solicitor, Mr Frederick Main, that Ms Marie Ann
Nicol, 22, Mr Paul Rhodes, 30, and Mr Gary Frost, 30, all c/o Dengin,
had no case to answer.
Mr Main pointed out that doubt existed as to whether Forest Enterprise
or the Dawson family of Invergarry owned the land on which the
travellers were camped, or whether either party owned it. It was the
subject of an ownership dispute.
As such, Mr Main argued, the Crown had failed to satisfy the Sheriff
as to the occupier of the land as defined in the Act as the person
entitled to ask the accused to quit the land.
0 Ms Nicol, who earlier this year was admonished after being found
guilty under the Trespass Scotland Act 1865 of illegally camping at
Dengin, said she was ''totally surprised by the verdict but absolutely
delighted''.
She said most of the campers had left Dengin and she too would be
moving this weekend.
Procurator-fiscal, Mrs Agnes Neizer, later confirmed she is to proceed
to trial with five other travellers who are facing the same charges
under the Criminal Justice Act.
As the trial began yesterday, a group of 30 members of the Scottish
Defiance Alliance staged a demonstration outside the court. Alliance
convener, Mr Nicky McKerrel, said the organisation had been formed to
support anyone who was charged under the Criminal Justice Act anywhere
in Scotland.

MAINS OF COUL, a courtyard house just outside the village of Contin
some 19 miles from Inverness, is a type of Georgian building rarely
found in the Highlands. The farmhouse comprises part of the attractive
south-facing frontage, with the entrance to the courtyard garden passing
through a central arch.
Dating from 1795, it was built as a model farmhouse and steading round
a square courtyard by the Mackenzies of Coul, who owned the local estate
and were noted agricultural improvers.
The farmhouse was extensively restored in 1983 by the present owners
and has been transformed into a comfortable and easily-run home, while
retaining its character. It has two reception rooms, a kitchen/living
room, five bedrooms and two bathrooms.
On the eastern side of the archway there is a self-contained flat. The
rest of the buildings provide extensive garaging, storage and workshops,
and there is considerable scope for conversion into more self-contained
dwellings, subject to planning permission.
Mains of Coul is set in about 4.5 acres on a hill above the village,
and there is an uninterrupted view across a 25-acre field to
Strathconnon in the distance. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in conjunction with
Finlayson Hughes in Inverness, are inviting ofers of over #230,000 for
the house.
The 25-acre field, part of which has been planted with hardwoods under
the Farm Premium Woodland Scheme, is available at offers over #35,000.

TV presenter Kirsty Young tells Ann Donald what's on her bedside table
I'M ACTUALLY really bad on novels so I tend to choose books that I can
just pick up and put down as I go along. So right now I'm reading the
Alan Clarke Diaries, which is good because I can dip in and out of them.
I've not read many political biographies but I'd be astonished if they
were as honest as this. The thing I really like about them is that he's
obviously not trying to make himself come out of it well, with the
exception of one or two, but he lets his own faults shine through and
his own pettiness and attempts to make it up the greasy pole.
He's never been a political favourite of mine, it has to be said, but
I do think people deserve respect for being that honest.
I'm a huge Alan Bennett fan so I've been reading his autobiography,
Writing Home. I'm also a big Woody Allen fan and I think that Bennett is
almost a British version of Allen. I love his observations and the fact
that the minute I read or hear things he's said or written, they strike
a chord, though I would never have thought of them myself and I think
that's the big appeal. I understand exactly what he's talking about, but
I'm not nearly as perceptive as he is.
Last year I took the Ben Elton book, Stark, on holiday and spent my
time rolling around on the sand laughing. I like his style and I'm a big
fan of his also. One of the first books I really loved was The
Peppermint Pig by Nina Bawden. I used to run home from school so that I
could read it. When I was at secondary school I had a very good English
teacher who was great at teaching poetry and Shakespeare and that
instilled a great enthusiasm in me. Nowadays I don't pick up the
classics and re-read them as I probably should, though I still love
poetry.
When I can, I dip in and out of Raymond Carver's poetry book, A New
Path to the Waterfall. It was the last and most spectacular book he
wrote. I think my enthusiasm for poetry started at school, and that's
maybe symptomatic of not having the time to read for three hours, but 10
minutes of poetry is OK.

WORK on the world's first lung cancer research unit is due to begin
this summer in Liverpool, Roy Castle's widow revealed yesterday.
Mrs Fiona Castle and the late entertainer pioneered the appeal which
will fund the new centre.
Mrs Castle, 55, a mother of four, was addressing the annual business
meeting of the Woman's Guild of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh.
The appeal now stands at #4m, she said.
She told how her faith had helped her survive the trauma of her
husband's illness and his subsequent death. Her 61-year-old non-smoking
husband died of lung cancer last year.
Mrs Castle, a church member for 20 years, said: ''I'm not scared of
death at all. I can't wait to get there.''
She said her husband had not been frightened either and, although he
still felt he had things to offer, ''he knew it was God's will''.
She revealed her distaste for smoking and advertising posters.
''If smokers went into a lung cancer ward in a hospital, it would put
them off for life.''
She said she had no plans to sue tobacco companies over her husband's
death: ''He chose to work where he did. It wasn't known that passive
smoking could do any harm.''

THE topic of religious relics will be to most folk, I fear, dusty,
drab and, dare I say it, dry as a bone. Yet the crazy world of
three-footed saints, many-headed martyrs (most remarkable feature of the
relics was their ability to endlessly reproduce), miracle-working
shoulder blades, sacred semmits, and restorative toenail clippings, has
always produced a rich source of anecdote -- and occasionally mystery.
Breaking an unwritten rule of this column we return (for one week
only, seats in all parts of the house) to the subject of one of
Scotland's most treasured and enigmatic relics, the Black Rood, said to
be a piece of the True Cross set in an ebony crucifix. Here's the story
to date.
The Black Rood is said to have been brought to Scotland by St Margaret
who fled north in the years after the Norman Conquest and married
Malcolm Canmore, Malcolm III. A bit of Margaret's background is
relevant. She is said to have been born in Hungary but was in England
during the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042-1066) who was her
grand-uncle.
On her death in 1093, Margaret is reported to have left the Rood,
described by contemporary historians as a ''great national palladium'',
to the Scottish people. It is recorded as having been taken south along
with the Stone of Destiny in 1296 as part of Edward I of England's booty
from his Scottish ''tour''. Its significance for the Scots is indicated
by the fact it was only restored by special treaty.
Almost half a century passes before it surfaces again, this time as
one of the relics carried by the Scots army in 1346 to the Battle of
Neville's Cross near Durham where we were soundly drubbed and David II
was taken into captivity.
The English considered the acquisition of the Black Rood almost as
important as the victory itself and it was kept for the next 200 years
in Durham Abbey ''on the pillar next to St Cuthbert's shrine in the
south aisle''. During the chaos of the Reformation, like so many other
religious artefacts, it disappeared .
But perhaps, thanks to a sharp-eyed correspondent of this column who
spends more time immersed in dusty tomes than is good for her, we can
take the story on a stage further. The year is now 1688 and James VII's
world is falling apart about him. William of Orange has arrived, James
feels the nation has turned against him, his wife, Mary of Modena, and
the infant James VIII have fled to France, and James himself sets off on
a voyage to exile on the Continent.
On December 11, however, his boat was forced to take refuge from a
storm in the Thames at the Isle of Sheppey and James, mistaken for a
Jesuit in disguise, was hauled off as a prisoner to Faversham.
Eventually he was rescued by the Lord Lieutenant of Kent, Lord
Winchelsea, but not before he was seized by a fit of weeping over the
''loss of a splinter of wood, asserted to be a piece of the True Cross
which had belonged to Edward the Confessor''.
Was it the Black Rood of Scotland, missing since the Reformation? It's
unlikely. Reformer John Calvin thought there were enough pieces of the
True Cross floating around to build a battleship. And yet the link with
the Confessor is tantalising. Could Edward have gifted this relic to
Margaret on his death? Did she bring it to Scotland? Could it have found
its way back into the royal household in London after five centuries via
Neville's Cross, Durham, and God knows where else? Does it lie today in
the silt at the bottom of the Thames? Answers on a jawbone, please.

GONE are the days when a trip to the local garden nursery could only
mean shopping for one of two things -- you needed some potting compost
for your seedlings, or some extra seedlings to use up your compost.
But the leisure revolution in the sixties and seventies put paid to
the hard-working notion of getting some colour into and some enjoyment
out of the garden.
Leisure is the key word here. Today, few gardeners have the time or
inclination to grow their own plants from seed, or even seedlings.
Instant results are the order of the day, which is why the market for
flowering pot plants has mushroomed in recent years.
From the days when the business plan was to supply the would-be
gardener intent on relaxation at his own back door, garden centres are
now directly in the frame as leisure complexes in their own right.
Hence the rise of the garden centre coffee shop, already a mainstay of
many a shopping complex -- witness any large supermarket.
Typically, displays of dried flowers, silk flowers, ornamental bowls,
pots, planters, candles, bird boxes, garden pools, figurines, tropical
fish, not to mention the ubiquitous garden gnomes, surround the coffee
shop/tearoom allowing families to browse rather than a dash in and out.
Once again the key word is leisure and the steadily expanding range of
goods on offer means you don't have to be a garden enthusiast to enjoy a
garden centre.
Not that you'd be let down if you go looking for that unusual shrub or
flower you spotted in the neighbour's garden or on holiday abroad.
Excellent supply lines with Holland, Europe's plant and flower centre,
mean buyers can choose from an incredible range of hybrids from all
round the world. To support this staggering choice of flowering plants,
peats, soils, and potting composts to suit the most exotic bloom's taste
are stacked on pallets.
Trolleys similar to the supermarket variety take the ''lift and
carry'' out of the exercise, as do the raised benches which the
flowering shrubs and blooms sit on.
At this time of year, when most people are rediscovering what lies
outside the back door, the centres are already geared up to meet the
demand for all manner of lawn mowers, hedge cutters, and electrical
appliances.
But for that first cut of the year, many find the long grass a tall
order for their machine -- one reason plant and garden hire companies
and garden centres report an increase in demand for petrol-driven mowers
and strimmers in the spring months.
A product doing particularly well on the hire market, is the ride-on
mower (which, again, just about qualifies for inclusion as a leisure
item). Priced between #900 and #2000, they are the last word in
labour-saving grass cutting, some are even equipped with a gear box to
allow the driver to zip round his lawns.
The picture is similar with scarifiers, rotovators, and tiners. Too
expensive to contemplate buying when they are only needed occasionally
through the year, they are popular hire items.
But the burgeoning garden centre market doesn't stop at hiring plant
either. Some outlets have embarked on the business of taking in
franchisees into their complexes, and golf shops, saddleries, and the
like, now stand side by side with displays of pot plants and shrubs.
With leisure time at a premium in the nineties, the continued rise of
the garden centres seems a certainty.
They may well continue to broaden their outlook and take in other
non-gardening interests -- angling and hill walking are already being
discussed as possible markets -- but as long as the garden outlets stays
true to the notion of serving the leisure market, they will remain
centres of great attention.

THE two most elderly Scottish judges announced their retirement
yesterday.
Lord Murray, 72, and Lord Mayfield, 73, retire tomorrow.
The announcement -- following the death from cancer of Lord Morton of
Shuna earlier this week at the age of 65 -- means the Scottish Bench is
three short of its full strength of 26.
It is expected that three new appointments will be made soon. Senior
QCs in line will be Mr Arthur Hamilton, Mr James McGhie, Mr Donald
Macfadyen, and Mr William Nimmo Smith.
Mr John Horsburgh QC, currently a temporary judge, must also be in
line for a permanent appointment and the elevation of Hazel Aronson QC,
also a ''temp'', would make her Scotland's first woman High Court judge.
Lord Murray, the former MP for Leith, was appointed to the Bench after
serving as Lord Advocate in the last Labour Government (1974-1979). He
was called to the Bar in 1953 and took silk in 1964.
In 1989, he issued a dissenting judgment in the case in which Rangers
players Terry Butcher and Chris Woods were convicted of breach of the
peace on the pitch at an Old Firm game. It was the first prosecution of
its kind in Scotland.
Lord Murray took the view that although the behaviour of the players
had been deplorable and infringed the laws of the game, it did not
amount to a criminal offence.
Lord Mayfield, formerly Mr Ian MacDonald, became a Court of Session
and High Court judge in 1981 and was called to the Bar in 1952. He
became a QC in 1964 and between 1973 and 1981 served as president of the
Industrial Tribunals for Scotland.
In a 1989 case, Lord Mayfield issued a landmark ruling that it was
competent for a husband in Scotland to be charged with raping his wife
even though the couple were still living together.
The announcement yesterday came as a bench of 17 judges convened to
pay tribute to Lord Morton.
A packed courtroom at Parliament House in Edinburgh heard Lord Hope,
the Lord President and Lord Justice General, praise the late judge's
lasting contribution to the Scottish legal system.
Lord Hope said: ''His influence was, I think, more effective in
promoting reform than he himself perhaps realised. Certainly, his
influence will continue and the points made by him in his last speech in
the House of Lords, where he was such an effective advocate for
Scotland, will not be lost sight of.''
In his Lords' speech last November, Lord Morton criticised procedure
in the Court of Session, Scotland's supreme civil court, as outdated,
slow, and expensive.
He called for a ''cards on the table'' approach to justice, with
judges playing a much more interventionist role to speed up cases.

<HEADLINE>Crack trio jailed after record haul. Gang leader 'still at large'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978649294</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO drug dealers, caught with the world's largest haul of crack
cocaine, worth more than #1m, were jailed yesterday for 20 and 16 years
respectively.
Judge Geoffrey Rivlin at Southwark Crown Court said the pair, along
with a third man who was sentenced to five years, had been part of an
efficient and massive ''family-run'' conspiracy to flood Britain with
crack.
The judge said crack dealers caused ''untold fear and misery to many
thousands of people, both users and their families''.
Andre N'Guessan, 34, said to be in charge of drug distribution, was
jailed for 20 years.
N'Guessan had assumed the name of an Ivory Coast magistrate and his
real identity remains a mystery.
He was said to have made #1.5m from trading in crack. The court heard
that, over 18months, he had handled 23kg of the drug, making #5.3m in
profit.
The alleged gang leader, described as a relative of N'Guessan, is said
to be still at large.
N'Guessan was ordered to surrender #750,000 of ''realisable'' drugs
profits within 12 months or face an extra three years in jail.
Mariame Keita, 30, was sentenced to 16 years for her part in the
conspiracy.
The mother-of-four, who had her last child in prison, was said to have
earned #1m from dealing in drugs and had led a life of ''utmost
extravagance''. She was said to share a #450,000 New York apartment with
the alleged gang-leader.
She was ordered to pay #500,000 to the court within 12 months or face
an extra two years' jail.
The judge accepted Keita had played a lesser role in the conspiracy.
She had also concealed her true name.
The third defendant, Charles Oppon, a 36-year-old father of one, was
described by the judge as N'Guessan's ''dog's body''. He was given five
years in jail, with an additional three months if #3000 was not paid
within the next 12 weeks.
The judge told all three that he would be making recommendations that
the Home Secretary should consider their deportation upon their release.
The conspiracy was broken in an undercover police operation in June
last year.
By the time officers swooped, the gang leader had allegedly used drug
profits to buy an ice-cream factory, a cannery and sweet-making
machinery for an industrial estate he hoped to set up in Ghana.
The jury heard that N'Guessan and Keita had made frequent trips to
West End branches of Thomas Cook travel agents to send huge sums out of
the country in a money laundering exercise that involved at least #4m
and accounts in America, France, Denmark, and Ghana.
The court heard the drugs trail probably started in Bangkok with
heroin being smuggled out of Thailand to New York. There it was swapped
for cocaine, which was then brought into Britain -- often by Keita --
where she converted it into crack in a process involving a microwave
oven.
During his sentencing, the judge, who praised officers involved in the
case, said police had been ''greatly assisted'' by surveillance cameras.
All three defendants were convicted of conspiracy to supply.

SO far as the outside of your house is concerned, you have only one
worry. The weather wants to get in: you want to keep the weather out. So
what's the problem?
At one of those dinner parties to which I am so frequently invited as
a radical thinker, I found myself placed next to a woman who writes for
a home improvements magazine. This was deliberate on the part of our
hostess. She likes a ''lively discussion''. She would have placed John
Major next to Teddy Taylor, or Mother Teresa next to Joe Stalin, except
that they didn't RSVP.
We were only an inch into the soup when my neighbour started laying
down her theories for exterior house finishes. Her thinking was that you
shouldn't choose a colour that clashes with those of your neighbours.
You should take your cue from your environment. In rural areas, choose
colours that tie in with local bricks or the tones of the soil; in
towns, look for a subtlety that blends rather than stands out.
''Bollox,'' I said.
''Pardon?'' she said.
''Sorry,'' I said. ''I'm trying to cough up a crouton from my
windpipe.''
Through fish, flesh and pudding, I tried as gently as possible to
demolish her case. She was, after all, quite good-looking. I asked why
it was a good idea to choose an exterior house colour that didn't clash
with those of your neighbours if you didn't like the colours they'd
painted their houses in the first place. Take my neighbours, I said. One
one side, the house in puce, and other side magenta. What the hell am I
supposed to do?
''Paint yours white,'' she said sweetly, ''maybe with a pinkish
undertone.''
I objected strongly. If I did that, I said, that would give my
neighbours absolute licence to paint their house exteriors next time in
any sort of revolting shade they chose. My function, as
pig-in-the-middle, would be to supply the negative foil to their abysmal
choice. I didn't see that as my role in life.
''My reaction,'' I said, ''would be to paint my house in a sort of
deep violet colour, and wait for them to make their play next time
round. And that bit about blending your house-colour to the local soil.
Where I live, the local colour is mud.''
Mud is a very useful tone, she said. ''We'd had a few glasses by this
time but she wasn't daft. Later, when I asked if it was to be my place
or hers, she said it certainly wouldn't be mine. She had a headache
already.

Hundreds of young men have benefited from the bequest
of a Perth shoemaker and, centuries after his death, the
windfall that once came in kind now has a more sterling
ring to it, finds James Robertson
The boy who will be
selected has, most
likely, been registered
as being a potential
beneficiary on his birth
The fortunate youngster will be due #1750 per year over a decade
ROBERT Maxwell, had he taken a leaf from Charles Cairnie's book, could
have left his pensioners and his progeny in a more secure state.
Cairnie, a Perth shoemaker and bailie, who died in 1744, shrewdly and
conscientiously saw to it that his estate would continue to provide for
at least some of his blood for centuries after his demise. It is still
paying out, and some fortunate schoolboy with the proper credentials
will collect thousands of pounds over the next 10 years to help finance
his education.
They were stirring times -- a turbulent era when a man's possessions,
whether they amounted to a treasure or simply the family bible and his
father's sword, could so easily pass illegitimately into the wrong hands
when he departed this world.
In Scotland in the early 1740s and particularly in and around Perth,
rebellious whisperings -- or, in like-minded and trusted company, bold
boasts -- could be heard wherever men gathered. And a canny man was well
advised to confide in a good lawyer if he was keen to ensure that the
fruits of his labours would reach the desired destination on his demise,
which might be all too imminent considering the fast-gathering storm
that was threatened.
Charles Cairnie was certainly one such canny man. The ghost of a
military man from Glasgow, located in a part of the recently united
kingdoms that came to be saddled with the postal address ''North
Britain'' four decades after Culloden, would bear witness to that, if he
could. So too would the wraiths of a string of other long-dead folk,
including a seafarer, a missionary to India, sons of men of the cloth,
and others of varying rank or with no standing or trade at all.
Remarkably, there are also folk who are not yet dust, nor near that
stage if they are to be allowed the allotted span, who could provide
corroboration.
To those in both categories, the dead and the quick, Charles Cairnie's
concern that his wordly possessions should not be at risk of being
dissipated in a single generation after his own death, and the
perspicacity which he demonstrated in his effort to achieve that goal,
qualify as worthy of the most ingenious twentieth-century
arch-capitalist who, with an army of lawyers to translate his last
wishes into inalterable legal form, leaves his fortune to his closest
flesh and blood.
A recent public notice, buried among the intimations carried in the
columns of a newspaper that reaches fewer eyes than does The Herald, and
aired only once in every five years, bears current testimony to
Cairnie's canniness and set this reporter's nose a-twitching enough to
investigate the tale it promised.
It appeared on February 27, under the cumbersomely off-putting title
''Cairnie Mortification''.
Its message is best conveyed as it reads: ''In the year 1743, Charles
Cairnie, Shoemaker in Perth, and sometime one of the Bailies of Perth,
mortified part of his lands of Scones Lethandy, on consideration that
certain portions of the Rents thereof should be paid for Ten Years to
Two Young Men nearest the age of fourteen (whether below or above that
age), of the descendants of any of his five brethren, and failing the
descendants and posterity of his said brethren, to any other young men
of the name of Cairnie.''
The notice gave forth the information that a vacancy in ''this
Mortification'' had occurred, and that all persons deeming themselves
entitled to the above-described right and privilege were requested to
lodge their claims -- ''with the necessary documents in proof thereof''
-- in the hands of George Maitland, Clerk to the Trustees, King James VI
Hospital, Perth, before April 3.
Fascinating stuff. But more fascinating still when elucidated by the
man who placed the public notice, George Maitland.
He tells about Charles Cairnie the shoemaker, a prospering trade in
days when a man and armies of men moved on foot, with only the select
few enjoying the luxury of a mount, and drovers covered hundreds of
miles, goading on cattle that were sometimes shod themselves, not with
metal horseshoe-like protection, but with leather to ensure that they
did not fall crippled by the wayside en route to lush Sassenach pastures
for fattening and sale in the London meat market.
Maitland relates how this man Cairnie, with no direct heirs of his own
to endow, provided -- down two centuries and more to present times, and
beyond, even -- generous bursaries to help finance the education of his
brethren's descendants.
The successful respondent to the public notice will become the 54th of
the Cairnie brothers' blood to benefit from his conscientious concern
for generations Charles could not even know would be born.
Cairnie, who dictated his bequest in 1743 -- and might have been
called upon to supply his best buckled shin for the Young Chevalier
himself when the Bonnie Prince called in at Perth on his mission to
regain the crown for his family, but died in 1744, a year too early to
be considered for such a contract -- has left the latest beneficiary of
his Mortification the best part of #20,000.
It will be dispensed by George Maitland and his fellow trustees, all
elders of Perth's St John's and Letham St Mark's kirks, who are charged
with the administration of the Cairnie Mortification in favour of
schoolboy descendants of the five brothers -- Thomas, John, Colin, Hugh,
and Alexander, who became a shoemaker in Edinburgh.
The boy who will be selected has, most likely, been registered as a
potential beneficiary on his birth. For there are Cairnies and their
connections who are aware of the windfall a son could enjoy if his
birthdays happen to coincide with or come close to a certain, vital
date. He will be the one out of a number of applicants whose fourteenth
birthday falls closest to November 11, Martinmas Day. The fortunate
youngster will be due #1750 per year over a decade -- half of it
received in annual payments and the other half in a lump sum when the
period expires. Another vacancy will arise in five years' time, for the
trustees have staggered the exercise of Charles's wishes.
The money comes from the rent which the King James VI Hospital
collects from Scones Lethandy, 500 acres of prime, arable farmland and
130 acres of forestry. The amount is related to the proportion of the
land owned by Charles Cairnie at death. Cairnie had one-and-a-half
fifths of the ground, near Scone. Two-thirds of the rent value from his
share goes to his beneficiaries and the remaining one-third to the
hospital for its charitable work.
Cairnie made no stipulation to restrict the benefit to a needy twig on
the family tree. It can go to rich or poor, so long as the recipient
fits the bill in his relationship to the Cairnie brothers.
The names of the recipients, at least while still alive, are not
broadcast, out of normal courtesy. It can be mentioned, however, that
for some time the beneficiaries have not been lads with the Cairnie
surname. The male lines from the brothers has been exhausted, and the
benefits now go to sons of women who can establish their place in the
family tree.
So there is little point in a Cairnie who cannot prove his pedigree
going to the bother of applying -- at least yet. When, or if, the family
tree fails to produce sons on the distaff side, that will be the time
for ''any other young men of the name of Cairnie'' to chance their luck.
Secret though the recipients' identities are meant to be kept, it can
be told that the young man who was a 14-year-old about 10 years ago and
who is now about to complete his decade as a payee, coming up to age 24,
is from a family of high social standing. He is son of a Knight
Commander of the Order of the Bath who has done sterling service for his
country in senior posts abroad, including at least one African state and
Washington DC.
Another recent beneficiary is a professional photographer. However,
those who ignite most curiosity for this reporter are the earlier
beneficiaries, to whom their canny ancestor's concern for their welfare
must in most cases have seemed God-sent.
Naturally, the first to benefit were Charles Cairnie's nephews. His
namesake Charles, son of Colin, and John, son of John, qualified in the
year of their uncle's death. Another nephew, Alexander, came into his
fortune in the year of Culloden, 1746. In those early stages, the
benefits were dispensed in kind, not cash, as products from the late
Charles's lands.
Another early beneficiary was a soldier, a corporal in the Third
Regiment of Foot Guards, stationed at Knightsbridge Barracks, with a
Glasgow, ''North Britain'', connection.
Surely, he and the other characters who populate the list of Charles
Cairnie's brothers' offspring were men around whom tales could be woven,
and one wonders how their good fortune affected their lives. Were those
who drew cash, when that came about, spendthrifts? Did some use their
inheritances to become benefactors themselves?
Just as among today's pools and National Lottery winners, both
categories would be represented, no doubt.
It is not George Maitland's job to probe for the answers to those
questions. He has enough to do following the command of Charles Cairnie,
Perth shoemaker. He is 81, and has been involved in the task since he
retired from his job as district clerk with the old North of Scotland
Hydro-Electric Board.
''It keeps me going,'' he told me, and launched into the fascinating
origins of King James VI Hospital in Perth, established in 1569 when the
king was still in infancy and during the regency of the Earl of Moray --
the start of a lengthy and honourable history that these pages could not
contain.
Its charters dictated that it could provide ''by all honest ways and
means, an Hospital for the poor, maimed, distressed persons, orphans and
fatherless children within the burgh'', a sentiment which it continues
to fulfil from its incomes from various trusts and its investments down
to the present day.
Not everyone has a forebear like Charles Cairnie.

Now that the old fireplace is hot again, it's not easy to put it out,
reports Brian McGlone
BACKED by evocative advertising -- remember the cat, the dog and the
mouse snuggling up by the hearth when the family's gone to bed? -- few
home features have staged such a dramatic comeback as the fireplace.
The victim of the dash for gas in the seventies, it is once again a
focal point of modern housing developments, and thousands of chimneys
are being ''opened up'' in older homes, says the Solid Fuel Association.
So it's all the more remarkable that a homeowner should force a public
inquiry, at a personal cost of #2000, over taking a fireplace out.
The case of Ferrier v Edinburgh District Council could become a
landmark for owners of listed buildings if its outcome influences
council policy on internal alternations.
Planning officials have a statutory right to enter and inspect listed
buildings, and after an anonymous tip-off, they visited Miss Elizabeth
Jane Ferrier's B-listed tenement flat in Royal Crescent. She was ordered
to replace a slate surround (or chimneypiece) and cast iron inset,
removed from a bedroom to create more space for furniture.
Mr Michael Armstrong, a senior planning officer with Edinburgh
District Council, said: ''This bedroom has happily received furniture
for over 100 years. Removing the fireplace, although it was not unique,
has had a significant effect on the room and the overall character of
the building.''
However, Miss Ferrier's improvements to cornices, shutters and doors
compensated for the ''insignificant impact'' of the missing fireplace,
said her solicitor, Mr Neil Collar. He condemned ''bureaucracy gone
mad'' in the appeal against a council enforcement notice requiring
reinstatement.
Mr George Pease, the reporter, was urged to regard the notice as a
knee-jerk reaction to the flat's New Town location whereas, said Miss
Ferrier, ''it is not a particularly attractive building, and the flats
are not of outstanding architectural merit''.
The fireplace, she said, had been in poor condition, with a broken
grate and cracked tiling, and made it difficult to place period
furniture in what was an awkwardly shaped room. After ''forming the
view'' that she could dispose of the fireplace, it was taken away, and
she did not know what had become of it.
If the the enforcement notice is not quashed, the council can insist
on a suitable replacement -- estimated at less than a quarter of the
amount Miss Ferrier has spent challenging the planners by a process
usually associated with issues like the Channel Tunnel rail link.
While the reporter's recommendations, expected in June, may not have
any binding effect on future appeals, precedent is often cited, and
officials will be studying the findings closely.
One way or another, Miss Ferrier's fireplace has brought into the open
a burning issue about the right to order our homes as we choose.
* Historical note: Royal Crescent was planned by Reid and Sibbald in
1802 as part of the first extension to the New Town. It was completed by
James Lescelles between 1884 and 1888.

COUNCILLORS in Stirling have approved #40,000 for emergency remedial
work after a consultants' report revealed last week that cliffs beneath
the Wallace Monument were crumbling and represented a serious hazard to
life and property.
In a confidential document accepted by the council's executive
committee, recreation officer Bob Calvert recommended the money be set
aside to carry out ''essential corrective measures'' to deal with the
areas of greatest concern on the Abbey Craig cliffs.
A council spokesman said yesterday that the first priority would be to
stabilise rock structures above the threatened Acre Wood nursery below
the monument. A fuller report by geologist George Matheson on the state
of the cliffs is expected in the middle of next month.
Meanwhile, children from the nursery will move this week into safe
premises at the Stirling Indoor Bowling Centre.
The safety of the Abbey Craig cliffs was first called into question
last November after two huge boulders crashed on to the road beneath the
monument, one narrowly missing a woman at a bus stop and the other
ploughing through a garden wall.
A report commissioned by the council from Professor Matheson revealed
the problems were far more serious.
Prof Matheson, director of the Transport Research Laboratory's
Scottish resource centre, said few areas of the Abbey Craig were free
from instability, which presented a major hazard to road users and
people using the woods beneath the monument.

NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday agreed that
the decommissioning of IRA arms was not the only item down for
discussion with Sinn Fein next week.
However, he hoped for early progress to a position where weapons were
permanently ''no longer available for use''.
Sir Patrick, after four hours of talks with Irish deputy-premier Dick
Spring at the intergovernmental conference, said of the ministerial
meeting with Sinn Fein: ''Decommissioning is not the sole issue.
''But it is an important one, and will be the first to be examined.''
He added: ''It is hoped we can make progress at the exploratory talks
with Sinn Fein.
''That includes a willingness to decommission in principle -- and that
there shall have been some tangible decommissioning, which only means
making arms no longer available for use.''
The long-awaited talks between Sinn Fein and Northern Ireland Office
Minister Michael Ancram are expected to be under way by midweek.
Exactly how arms were decommissioned was a ''matter for discussion'',
said Mr Spring.
Sir Patrick and Mr Spring, together with Ministers and police chiefs
from both sides of the border, took time off from the conference
mid-morning to attend an unprecedented ceremony in Dublin to honour the
victims of the Second World War and the Holocaust.
The event -- at the Irish War Memorial Park, Park Island Bridge,
Dublin -- was also attended by leading Sinn Feiner Tom Hartley and
Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis.
Afterwards, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton praised the ''courage''
of both men for their attendance.
* At yesterday's ceremony, Mr Bruton confirmed that the Prince of
Wales would visit Dublin in early June and a visit from the Queen was
expected to follow.

LIZ TAYLOR on The Wormery Experience
IT was the ad that did it. Such clever words -- ''foolproof, unique,
odourless, something for nothing . . .'' They persuaded me to buy a
Wormery. Now it sits at my back door, a grey wastebin two-and-a-half
feet high with a label showing a cartoon worm under the edge of the lid.
Visitors always comment: ''Oh, you've got one of those! How do you find
it?'' The answer is ''unique, odourless, something for nothing'' but
certainly not ''foolproof''.
The theory of the Wormery is that you put in your household waste and
a team of happy little worms chomp it up into miracle-working compost.
Lured by the prospect of luxuriantly flowering plants thriving on old
potato peelings, I bought my Wormery a year ago. Everything went well at
first. Mostly I tipped the bowl of household waste into the bin with
eyes averted but when I could force myself to look inside, I saw plump
pink worms crawling up the sides in what looked like a mass escape
attempt. I prayed I wouldn't wake up one morning and find them invading
the house.
But one day I looked in and found a scene of desolation. Nothing
moved, nothing squirmed. I rang the supplier for advice and the girl
said cheerfully: ''They've probably all drowned. Have you been running
off the liquid?''
Of course I hadn't. I'm one of those people with a very short
attention span as far as instructions are concerned. I'll read the first
paragraph and take the rest for granted. Staring into the tomb-like
interior of my Wormery, I felt sorry for my once fat and happy worms,
drowned in a sea of liquid fertiliser of their own making. The suppliers
were very helpful. They advised me to drain off the liquid and start all
over again, making sure to interleaf my layers of waste with wodges of
shredded newspaper.
When it looked as if the cold weather was over (worms can't take
frost) they despatched another squashy plastic bag of the little things.
Suppressing a feeling of nausea, I snipped it open and tipped it in,
hoping that the worms liked a mixed diet of The Herald, The Financial
Times and several Sunday newspapers.
The rotted matter that was to be excavated from the tub -- ''nutrient
rich organic compost'' -- was carefully spread along the back of the
herbaceous border and, after several anxious weeks, I see that my
delphiniums are pushing their way through it, apparently none the worse.
The drained-off liquid filled several buckets and, in a fit of
optimism, I mixed some with water and poured it on to the cherished
plants in my sunroom. My passion flower promptly died but that wasn't
the worst. I hadn't reckoned on the stink. Day and night for a week I
burned smell-obliterating candles and sprayed lavishly with room
deodorants, but nothing worked.
The stench was so bad that I had to work in the sunroom with a hankie
over my nose and mouth -- and it was worse when the sun shone. Like an
insidious infection, it spread through the entire house and I had to
cancel a bridge party in case my guests were gassed.
The moral of this story is: Always read the instructions and don't mix
liquid fertilisers with too-generous a hand. Otherwise, my Wormery is
just about worth the money (#49) as a perpetual focus for free-ranging
anxiety if nothing else.

THE LAWN is the first focus for people venturing back into the garden,
writes IAN WALLS. In 50 years in this business, I have heard more
mumbo-jumbo talked about lawns than . . . well, here is part one of a
simple two-part summary of the problems -- with answers.
Moss: Some types favour dry conditions, some wet. A fortune is
awaiting someone with a long-term moss cure. In the meantime, we are
left with available chemicals which may do the job for the moment, but
moss is kept at bay only with constant application -- and effective
scarification or raking.
I have little moss on my own lawns this year. It has taken nearly two
years of regular application of Fisons moss-kill extra in spring and
their autumn extra, coupled with regular use of an electric lawn rake,
to get on top of things.
Thatch: This layer of dead grass, mowings and old grass plants which
accumulates on the surface makes some lawns very prone to moss attack
and it has the effect of reducing the vigour of the grass plants, to the
extent that you may find you have brown patches. Conditions are so
crowded at the lawn surface that new plants can't develop properly.
The only answer is severe scarification with a rake, manually or
electrically -- and I advise the latter. It leaves a thin, weak-looking
lawn, but you can get a quick-developing seed mixture to thicken things
up.
Feeding: Keeping your lawn in vigorous growth is a vital key to
success. Regular feeding encourages grass at the expense of moss. If you
neglect to feed a lawn, the grass will get thin. In will come moss.
I feed my lawns three or four times a season -- spring, early summer,
late summer and autumn. With slow-release fertilisers, summer feeding is
not now really so necessary. If your lawn does get thin and
yellow-looking, there are quick-acting fertilisers which will soon green
it.
Cutting: It's debatable whether it is better to collect mowings or
leave them lying. Modern views tend to the latter view. Some modern
mowers make a feature of cutting up mowings into fine size, to be left
as a thin mulch on the surface. This is undoubtedly is common sense.
Perhaps still more important is how keenly you cut the lawns. If you
try to cut the average lawn too keenly, you end up skinning patches and
moss will appear in a flash. Far better to set up the cutting blades to
a reasonable level, even if it means cutting more frequently.
* Next: weeds, diseases and drainage.

THE WEEK'S WORK: How far have you got on? asks IAN WALLS. Looking
round Glasgow's West End, I note that most gardeners seem to be
reasonably on top of things, with roses pruned, grass cut, edges trimmed
and gardens looking generally quite tidy.
It is behind-the-scenes work in greenhouses and vegetable sections
that keep people busy these days. Finding enough room for everything in
the greenhouse is a problem. Seedlings grow at a great rate, and
whatever you do, don't let things spoil because of overcrowding. Don't
be afraid to use cool conservatories or porches as plant-holding
quarters.
In the fruit garden there is not a lot to do if you have kept up.
Getting round with a weedkiller is a must. I have been using Murphy
Weedmaster, which is one of the environmentally friendly ones, breaking
down when it hits the ground.
There is real activity in the vegetable garden. I planted early
potatoes after a period of sprouting, and I was rather cross to see
quite a few had rotted. Next job will be to plant the main crop
potatoes, Golden Wonders in my case.
Then there are peas and beans, and almost a full range of direct-sown
vegetables to get in. Fortunately the ground has dried out nicely.
I have been using some Chempak calcified seaweed, which has a lot of
lime and trace elements. I hope it has some effect on the fusarium foot
rot which my peas suffer from. Time will tell.
All brassicas, and especially the cabbage family, should be coming on
now, under cover. They can be set out as soon as they are large enough,
but remember to take precautions against root fly.
Another priority task in the unseen sections of the garden is to clean
up paths. I have noticed weeds encroaching over the winter months and a
hoeing session will pay dividends here.

<TEXT>
PRISON officers and doctors servicing Perth Prison were cleared
yesterday of failing to give adequate supervision to a killer who
committed suicide in his cell.
The decision came after a fatal accident inquiry into the death of
Daniel Ward, 29, one of seven of the prison's inmates who have been
found hanged in the past 15 months.
Ward, from Livingston, West Lothian, died on July 13, two years after
starting a life sentence for murder.
During the inquiry, depute-fiscal Sandy Mitchell suggested that Ward
should have been identified as a suicide risk and claimed that there
were features of the prison system that contributed to his death.
After finding that Ward had hanged himself from a nail screwed into a
ceiling beam, Sheriff John McInnes said: ''For a considerable period
prior to his death, he had been receiving treatment for depression. He
was depressed because he was serving a life sentence and was HIV
positive.''
The sheriff said: ''Although staff and the two doctors in the prison
were aware that he thought or spoke of suicide on occasions, he had
reassured those who asked that he did not intend to commit suicide.
''In particular, he reassured Doctor Daniel Carlin that that was the
case on July 11. On the basis of the evidence led at the inquiry,
neither prison officers nor medical staff had sufficient reason to
suppose that he would take his own life at about that time.''

From MURRAY RITCHIE European Editor Brussels
THERE was unexpected support from Germany yesterday, for Mr John
Major's effort to protect Britain's veto powers in the changing European
Union.
One of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's senior Christian Democrats backed the
British view that important decisions in the EU Council of Ministers
should in future be taken by a so-called double majority.
A double majority would mean that the national veto -- seen as vital
to Britain's continued sovereignty in Europe -- would remain unless
there was agreement in the council backed by a majority of member states
and reinforced by votes representing a majority of the EU population.
The issue is the overriding concern of Mr Major in next year's
inter-governmental conference (IGC) being called to revise the
Maastricht treaty. Britain is determined to resist the growing voting
power of the increasing number of small states in the EU -- a threat
which the British see as the ''tyranny of the tiny''.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, a foreign policy spokesman in Dr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, said the 1996 Maastricht 2 conference should also
agree to allow the European Parliament to initiate EU legislation. Mr
Major has pledged to block any moves to give the European Parliament
substantial new powers.
Several of the 15 EU member states have said they would rather
increase the role of national parliaments in controlling Brussels than
give the European Parliament more power, Mr Seiters said.
''That is not our view,'' he said.

WHO said gardening was a restful pursuit? Certainly not Mrs Pat Jordan
who has much to occupy her energies at the moment. She's preparing for
this year's new rush of admirers to her garden at Kittoch Mill,
Carmunnock. Its three acres house a national collection of hostas (and
hopefully, before long, ligularias) and, not surprisingly, she is kept
busier than the bees they attract -- despite occasional help from
husband Harold. The garden will be open to view the collections on June
11 and June 25 (between 2 and 5pm on both days) under Scotland's Garden
Scheme.

By FRANCES HORSBURGH Local Government Correspondent
EXECUTIVES of Cosla met the leaders of most of the 29 shadow councils
for the first time yesterday.
Before the private meeting in Edinburgh, Mrs Rosemary McKenna, the
Labour president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said
it would be a two-way discussion as they were eager to hear what the new
councils wanted from Cosla and their views on its future.
''We will be asking what Cosla can do to help them in the transitional
year. How they want us to operate and how they want us to respond to
their demands,'' she explained.
One of the most important things Cosla would be doing was to discuss
with the Scottish Office the level of funding for the new councils when
they take over full control of services next April.
In addition, said Mrs McKenna, Cosla could offer training in all
aspects of local government for councillors elected for the first time.
She said the convention is in the process of reinventing itself to
cope with the impact of reorganisation. As a result of the move to
single-tier councils, Cosla's membership will be reduced and it is
planned to replace its present 15 committees with six wider ranging
bodies.
A new chief official of the convention will also be appointed
following the decision of the present secretary general, Mr Roy MacIver,
to retire.

MANY people harbour a burning desire to save and refurbish an old
property, restoring it to former glory and creating for themselves a
house of substance and character.
Since 1990, finding possible buildings has become easier, as the
Scottish Office's Historic Scotland set up a separate Buildings At Risk
Register within the Scottish Civic Trust offices in Glasgow (tel: 248
3398).
Deborah Spencer, the Buildings At Risk Register officer, twice
annually compiles a bulletin highlighting, area by area, 100 of the
current 1080 buildings at risk with details of their condition, contact
names, telephone numbers and price (if for sale). When the price is too
high, potential interest is often killed off. But, generally, interest
is growing . . .
''We've had a lot of publicity over the last few months,'' says Ms
Spencer. ''The people who ring us are so excited and say they never knew
we existed. We've had to double our print run of the bulletin. Our
success means our funding gets gobbled up more and more, but it's good,
because there are people who are interested and committed and would like
to save a building.''
Also available is a print-out of the areas of interest to inquirers,
and the type of property they seek. ''Far and away, most want a rural
building like a steading, farmhouse or mill, with a little bit of
land,'' she explains.
With few grants available to help -- Historic Scotland's are pretty
well restricted to A-listed buildings and even they have no guarantee --
restorers have to be pretty well-heeled to even consider such a venture,
which can be enormously expensive and take years.
Deborah Spencer can also provide information on sources from which
grants may be available, but she says, ''People have got to know what
they are letting themselves in for. To begin with, they probably got a
fair battle just trying to acquire the building, most on the register
aren't on the market, so the owners probably aren't keen on selling.
Sometimes, they'll consider it if they like the person and they aren't
likely to cause them any trouble and will do the building some good. But
if it's an estate building, people don't want to sell off pockets of
land, a gate lodge for instance, which guards the entrance to the whole
estate.
Even if you don't succeed in buying, some owners will consider a
restoring lease. One Scottish professor is currently restoring a former
mill in this way, having negotiated such a lease which allows him use of
the building for the rest of his life -- as long as he does it up.
''That's one way of getting owners to part with their buildings, and
we're trying to encourage that,'' says Ms Spencer. ''Leases are variable
-- some are far to short to interest anyone, but one in the bulletin is
on offer for 99 years.''
But restoration needs not only investment of money, but faith, hard
work tenacity -- and not a little luck. WENDY JACK looks at a couple of
cases in point . . .
The Pearsons and their rejuvenated castle in Gourock
WHILE most people probably regard their homes as their castles, few
can claim to live in the real thing. But for the past decade, David and
Sheila Pearson have been among that tiny elite, after restoring their
home, Leven Castle at Gourock, from a ruin uninhabited for 300 years to
a house of great beauty, character and tranquillity.
Leven Castle's position is enviable, overlooking the Clyde Estuary
with panoramic views around the Firth, Kilcreggan and Coulport, Loch
Long and the Holy Loch, with a backdrop of the Argyll Hills.
Although there is modern private housing within the building and its
one-acre garden, there is a feeling of being in another world, away from
the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
As castles go, Leven is on the dinky side of the spectrum, there's
plenty of space, but it's not one of those vast, draughty houses with
endless, lofty ceilinged rooms and an all-pervading chill which reaches
the bone marrow.
David Pearson, who has restored a number of interesting buildings, has
lavished his usual tender loving care, employing meticulous research,
and not a little money, to recreate as faithfully as possible Leven
Castle's crow-stepped gables and three turnpike stairs, while discreetly
incorporating concessions to contemporary needs.
The house was built in 1430 for the Morton family. After remaining in
their possession for a century, Leven was bought by Lord Semphill of
Lochwinnoch, passing after his death to his third wife, Marion
Montgomery, a woman notorious for her inhumanity towards her tenants.
She was eventually sentenced to death for murder, thanks to the
intervention of her stepson Lord Semphill. However, her sentence was
reduced to one which inhibited her movements to within a ten-mile radius
of Leven Castle for her lifetime. Despite all this, she remarried the
owner of Skipness Castle, and presumably lived happily ever after. In
1676, Leven was sold to Sir James Stuart of Blackhall and Inverkip, and
lay unoccupied from then until the Pearsons bought it in 1984.
It's hard to imagine today that it was an ivy-clad wreck only a few
years ago. Helped by his architect, Ian Begg of Edinburgh, David Pearson
set about his major restoration, faithfully reproducing as much
authentic detail as possible through the skills of craftsmen from
stonemasons to blacksmiths and workers in wood. The result is a fine
building of high quality.
In the great hall, a generously but not hugely proportioned room,
which the Pearsons use as their sitting room, astragalled windows with
discreet secondary glazing are recessed in six-foot deep walls.
There are nooks and crannies with window seats from which to enjoy the
surrounding scenery, a vast fireplace with a multi-fuel burning stove,
and a wonderful painted ceiling created by Norman Edgar, a member of the
Royal Scottish Academy and a painter of some renown. It has been painted
in the style of many 16th-century ceilings, carefully researched by
David Pearson and Norman Edgar.
This room, like the rest of the house, has been brought to life by
Sheila Pearson's skills in interior design. Fine furniture from the
couple's previous homes have fitted in well, their art collection is
perfectly displayed against the white walls, and lamps, flowers, and
ornaments complete the picture.
The dining room and kitchen are also at first-floor level, while the
Pearsons' bedroom with four-poster bed, their bathroom and dressing
room, and a laundry room are on the floor above.
''It would be perfectly feasible to make two more bedrooms at this
level,'' said David. ''We have made our rooms very generous.'' On the
top floor there's a bedroom-sitting room, a small galley kitchen and
bathroom for guests, and a parapet walk, where an owl spends the winter.
''There are many joys in living here,'' said David. ''The views,
security, insularity, the sound of running water in the garden, which
has a waterfall with about 12 falls from it; there's birdsong these
spring mornings and our pet owl up top, who keeps us company.''
Three years ago, the Pearsons added a conservatory, built on a
cantilevered platform overlooking the burn and waterfall. ''It's been
wonderful and because it's not connected to the house, we don't have the
noise of rain others complain of,'' said Sheila, who keeps a profusion
of plants there. One of the barrel ceilinged vaults at ground level has
been turned into a drying room for her flowers, and at the same level
there's a cloakroom and David's study.
Now it's time for the Pearsons to move on. Time to put Leven on the
market and leave younger people to further develop the garden. ''It's a
lovely place,'' said Sheila, ''a tremendous place to live. I don't think
we'll ever, ever be able to find another home that has such wonderful
lighting and shadows and curves. To me it's a visual delight wherever
you look.''
The Gilberts and the art of living in Crail.
NEW life and change breathed into an old building, can also bring a
totally different lifestyle to those brave souls who have invested time,
money and effort on the venture.
George and Lesley Gilbert's Courtyard Gallery at Crail in the East
Neuk of Fife, is an excellent case in point. Believed to date from 1708,
the delightful, welcoming gallery which embraces paintings, sculptures,
pottery and glass is topped by their attractive flat above.
This combined place of work and home represents, say the Gilberts, ''a
whole new generation of active wrinklies who, now in their fifties have
the chance of doing something they always wanted, combining life's
experiences with entrepreneurial drive, and an urgency heightened by the
passing years''.
Both former teachers -- he having taught art for 25 years, she working
in special education -- George and Lesley Gilbert moved to the east
coast with their three young sons in the early seventies from Glasgow,
whose art school George had attended. They lived for 10 years in St
Andrews, until the children grew up -- to promptly return to university
in the west -- but George was keen to spend more time on his painting.
''Lesley was earning much more than I was,'' he explained. ''She said
if I was going to paint I'd have to do it properly and give up teaching.
That made me feel insecure. People didn't ever get to be painters when I
was a child, certainly not in Glasgow -- Sandy Goudie is an exception.''
When Lesley got the chance of early retirement, they jumped at it.
''However,'' says her husband, ''since I don't make much from my
paintings, and she was the main earner, we had to look for something
else.
''We always had the idea of selling paintings, perhaps from a room in
the house; selling through galleries means you lose some money in
commission. What we had in mind, though, was a very simple plan. We'd no
notion that it would become an ambitious project like this.''
A few years and moves elapsed before they bought their present home
and business. Strangely enough, they had passed it over when it had
previously been on the market, but fate clearly saw to it that it was
available once more second time around. By then, an American couple had
refurbished the flat, although the shop area on the ground floor was
derelict, with a dilapidated joiner's shop beyond and a concrete yard to
the rear where once, wash-houses and an outside lavatory had stood.
''Armed with a retirement lump sum and our personal savings, we
naively launched into the unknown,'' laughs Lesley. ''Initially we
envisaged the gallery simply as a place for George's work, but as holes
were knocked through walls and the plans transformed into a physical
reality, we began to consider an exhibition programme which would enable
us to show the work of artists we admired, both young and not so young.
''We wanted and artist-friendly gallery based in a most attractive
area where a good number of established professional artists already
lived, and where there was an interested public.''
First plans for a spring 1994 opening were thwarted, what with the
planners and a builder who stalked off in high dudgeon when his
workmanship was questioned. But, last August, Marketgate experienced
traffic jams as people streamed into the pretty village with its
memorable buildings and atmospheric seascape, to visit the Courtyard
Gallery.
''The Marketgate itself,'' explains Lesley, ''with its distinctive
Tollbooth painted by W Y Macgregor among others, bears a passing
resemblance to a French boulevard -- broad with ample free parking
adjacent to the gallery.''
House, gallery and the charming garden beyond, created by the
Gilberts, where sculptures are displayed, are havens of tranquillity.
The main exhibitions cover spring, summer, autumn and Christmas, with
three month-long group shows in between.
The flat is full of character with fine pine woodwork, and windows
facing to all but the northerly aspect. Rear views sweep across pretty
gardens, bright with spring flowers, to the shifting vista of the sea
beyond.
Despite all their hard work, the couple agree that their venture has
been a good idea. ''I've been totally amazed at the number of people who
get a kick out of looking at paintings, it's absolutely delightful,''
smiles Lesley. ''People don't feel intimidated coming here and we take
pleasure from their enjoyment. It's nice for painters too, it's a very
isolated life, so this is a great meeting point.''
The Gilberts' ''little bit of Paradise'' is well worth a visit . . .
and a guaranteed West of Scotland welcome in the East.

THE political war in Perth and Kinross broke out in earnest yesterday,
as the Tories and SNP fired on each other, as the Scottish Liberal
Democrats gathered in the city for their annual conference.
The SNP used the visit of Social Security Minister Peter Lilley to
Perth yesterday to attack the Government for turning Scotland into a
part-time economy. SNP leader Alex Salmond taunted the Tories over their
failure to move the writ for the by-election, saying: ''If the Tories
are sending someone to Perth for a by-election style campaign visit,
they might have the courtesy to call the by-election first.''
He said eight out of 11 modern by-elections had been called by this
stage and said Mr Lilley's presence was a signal from the Tories that
for them the by-election had effectively started. He also urged Mr
Lilley to come clean on the ''statistical scams'' used to massage the
unemployment figures.
Mr Salmond said: ''Every month, the unemployment figures are published
and we are treated to rhetoric from Tory Ministers about green shoots of
recovery and feel-good factors.
''The Tories are determined to maintain that the country is undergoing
economic recovery and they use their fiddled figures and sham statistics
to create an illusion of prosperity.''
However, he insisted that people weren't fooled and realised the
mismanagement of the Scottish economy which was hitting small businesses
hard, time and again.
The Tories hit back with the claim that an independent Scotland could
not possibly afford the level of pensions and benefits paid now.
Mr Lilley said that, as a partner in the UK, Scotland benefitted from
the existing system. ''You don't need a crystal ball to see that this
would all change if the SNP ever succeeded in breaking up the UK,'' he
said.
Mr Lilley said the SNP had failed to spell out how they would achieve
their promise of improving the system, restoring the link between
pensions and earnings within four years. He said: ''That promise alone
would cost over 5p in the pound on Scottish income tax. Think what that
would do for Scottish jobs as employers moved South of the Border.''
0 Meanwhile, a motion condemning the renewed Government interest in
national identity cards came surprisingly close to defeat at the
Scottish Liberal Democrat conference in Perth.
On a day of fairly predictable consensus, debates went largely as
expected -- the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill and rail privatisation
were bad things, it was agreed -- but on the hardy civil libertarian
annual of identity cards the consensus came close to coming unstuck.
A call from the Scottish Young Liberal Democrats, in an amendment,
expressing concern about a national DNA database, was actually voted
down.

PLANS to do away with 170 jobs were last night attacked by union
chiefs.
The threatened employees work for defence firm GEC Marconi Avionics in
Edinburgh.
The firm blames lack of orders and fierce competition in the declining
international defence market for the planned jobs cuts among the
1200-strong radar systems division at Crewe Toll.
Mr Andy Matson, regional officer for the Manufacturing, Science, and
Finance union, said: ''Everyone has been taken aback. It is a body blow
to workforce, given the effort and overtime they have put in to secure
and complete front-line contracts.''
''They are gobsmacked. It is their holiday weekend and now they are
given this news.
''We are not convinced at all that the company has got its figures
right and we will be meeting managers next week when we expect them to
come up with more information.''
The planned cutback is the latest in series at the former Ferranti
plants in Edinburgh which have halved the workforce to around 3000 in
the space of five years as it changed first to GEC Ferranti and now GEC
Marconi.
If the firm proceeds with a cut of 170, it is expected that most will
be achieved through voluntary redundancy, early retirement or transfers
between its other divisions in Edinburgh.

CABINET heavyweights yesterday mounted a sustained attack on Labour's
approach to spending and taxation and its links with the unions.
The onslaught came on the eve of Mr Tony Blair's expected success
today in rewriting his party's Clause 4 commitment to full-scale
nationalisation at a special conference in London.
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, speaking in
Nottingham, said Labour still did not really believe in a
free-enterprise economy. It might drop the old Clause 4 but it still
believed that Government should direct business.
He said: ''Labour used to think that the man from Whitehall knew best.
Now it thinks the man from the regional development agency knows best.
''When private sector companies read in the new Clause 4 that
'undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the
public or accountable to them','' said Mr Clarke, ''they should start to
get worried.''
Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, speaking in Brize Norton, said
Labour's refusal to say whether it would raise taxes or not would ''dish
them''. Its spokesmen denounced alleged ''cuts'' and promised to put
them right while studiously avoiding any commitment to higher taxation.
''They are all in favour of higher spending provided Father Christmas
comes down the chimney and fills the stocking. But apparently -- and the
emphasis is on apparently -- they have no intention of filling it
themselves through heavier taxes.''
Mr Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, produced
what he called a Labour strategy report -- The Next General Election:
Labour's Competitive Advantage, the Unions -- at a Tory local government
elections news conference.
He said it had been commissioned for ''a secret meeting between Tony
Blair and the union bosses last month'' and showed the unions would have
a major role in organising and financing Labour's next General Election
campaign with full- time union co-ordinators appointed in all key
marginal seats.
''In public,'' said Mr Heseltine, ''Tony Blair turns his back on
yesterday's Labour party. In reality he sees the trade unions -- those
rocks of ages past -- as his stepping stones to power.''
A Labour Party spokesman said Mr Heseltine's presentation of the
document as ''secret'' was hysterical. It had been produced by the
unions and circulated around hundreds of branches. It had not been
discussed at the Labour party trade union liaison committee meeting.
Meanwhile, Labour last night accused Chancellor Kenneth Clarke of
hurriedly removing a defence of the salaries of privatised utility
leaders from a speech he was delivering to business chiefs.
According to journalists, in a draft of Mr Clarke's speech circulated
on Thursday by the Treasury -- which apparently described the speech as
the approved version -- Mr Clarke referred to top pay in privatised
companies, saying world-class companies required world-class managers.
''This means inevitably that higher salaries will have to be paid to
attract and retain the best people,'' he said.
One of the journalists said he later received a call saying Mr Clarke
was rewriting the speech on the overnight plane home from the Finance
Ministers' meeting in Washington, making it a more political attack on
Labour's attitude to state industry.
Both The Times and the Independent carried reports today that Mr
Clarke was expected to defend pay in privatised companies at a speech to
the Nottingham Chamber of Commerce.
Mr Andrew Smith, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said:
''Kenneth Clarke says one thing one day and another the next. Yesterday,
he was defending the salaries of top bosses in the privatised utilities
but today he has changed his mind and is dismissing pay as a side
issue.''

THE purchase of Sir Winston Churchill's papers with #12.5m of National
Lottery money was defended strongly yesterday by President of the Board
of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine.
Mr Heseltine reacted after it emerged that the family -- including Sir
Winston's grandson, Tory MP Winston Churchill -- had retained the
copyright to the papers.
Mr Churchill will be entitled to claim a fee whenever material from
the 1.5 million papers lodged at Churchill College, Cambridge, is
published.
However, Mr Heseltine dismissed as ''nonsense'' the suggestion that
the disclosure cast further doubt on the wisdom of using money from the
National Heritage Memorial Fund to buy the papers.
''If you were to find a Rubens in your attic . . . would you suggest
that the state should have the power to expropriate because of the
national interest when you owned the Rubens? Of course you wouldn't,''
he told a news conference at Tory Central Office.
According to reports, the Churchill family will retain the copyright
to the private papers for 20 years and to the papers relating to his
public duties until 2039.
Labour has called for an independent panel of historians and experts
to assess which of the papers are already state property.
The all-party Commons Heritage Select Committee is to hold an
investigation.
Mr Churchill rejected the criticism as ''misconceived'', adding the
archive could have fetched #25m in the world market. He said: ''I think
this is probably a very fair deal all round.''
* The MP was involved in a fresh row yesterday with an attack on
immigrants on his local Manchester BBC radio station. He said ''selfish
immigrants'' were flocking to Britain in ''banana boats'' or on 747s,
''legally or illegally''.

THE 83-year-old Earl of Wemyss marries for the second time today at
Aberlady Parish Church.
However, he shrugged off comments about the age gap between himself
and his 50-something bride, art historian and property manager of
Edinburgh's Georgian House, Shelagh Kennedy.
''There is a precedent,'' he said yesterday. ''My great grandfather
was married for the second time at the age of 82 to a Miss Grace
Blackburn, a much younger lady. They were extremely happy together and
he lived to be 96.''
By his first marriage, Lord Wemyss has a son, Lord Neidpath, who lives
at Stanway, the family's Gloucestershire home. Lord Wemyss' daughter,
Lady Elizabeth Benson, lives at Peebles.
The management of the Wemyss and March Estates has nowadays been
largely handed over to Lord Neidpath and Matthew Benson, Lord Wemyss'
grandson.
The first Lady Wemyss died in 1988. Since February, Lord Wemyss has
been supervising the repointing and masonry at Neidpath Castle, a
thirteenth century fortified tower overlooking the River Tweed.

A POLICEMAN yesterday denied smashing a student's front teeth by
ramming his face on to concrete.
Constable Graham McKee, 34, also denied kicking Glasgow University
student Mohammed Anwar, 27. He also said he never told Mr Anwar:
''That's what happens to black boys with big mouths.''
Mr McKee told a historic action at Glasgow Sheriff Court how he chased
the student after seeing him illegally fly-posting.
Both of them fell and rolled down a grass banking, coming to rest on
concrete, he claimed. He said Mr Anwar was lying face down. ''I saw
blood at his mouth. I was horrified and I radioed for an ambulance,'' he
said.
Mr McKee said he charged Mr Anwar with an offence under the
Environmental Protection for Scotland Act for fly-posting in Ashton
Lane, Hillhead, Glasgow.
Earlier, casualty surgeon Dr Alistair Ireland, 32, of the city's
Western Infirmary, said Mr Anwar's injuries were consistent with his
story of being assaulted.
Mr Anwar, of Liverpool, is suing Strathclyde's Chief Constable for
#15,000 in the first civil action in Scotland which alleges a racist
attack by police. The incident took place in 1991 when Mr Anwar was an
arts student at the university.
Mr McKee was accompanied by trainee policewoman Lisa Fitzpatrick at
the time. She told Sheriff George Evans: ''He was showing me how to deal
with the public.''
The hearing continues next Friday.

THE Prime Minister was asked yesterday to order the Scottish Office to
reverse its decision to sanction tendering for medical services for the
two NHS hospitals in Stonehaven.
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish Secretary, reminded Mr Major that
he gave an unequivocal pledge at the 1991 Conservative party conference
that ''there will be no privatisation of health care, neither piecemeal
nor in part, nor as a whole. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not after the next
election. Not ever, while I'm Prime Minister''.
Mr Robertson asked: ''If private health care companies are to be given
health care responsibilities, how can this be anything other than
piecemeal privatisation?''
He said that although Grampian Health Board had not yet produced a
detailed sepecification of the services to be put out to tender, it
appeared they would include responsibilty for GP acute beds and long
stay geriatric beds.
''If this isn't piecemeal privatisation, what on earth is?'' he asked.
He also referred to reported remarks by Lord Fraser of Carmylie, the
Health Minister, that he ''would not wish the board to be prescriptive
about the nature of the design, the services to be offered, or the
manner in which they are to be delivered''.
That, claimed Mr Robertson, meant the Scottish Office was ''offering
carte blanche to any private operator to run medical services''.
If Mr Major failed to intervene, he said, ''it will only demonstrate
that your party's promises on the NHS are as worthless as your promises
on tax''.
In a speech in Nottingham last night, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Mr Kenneth Clarke, said: ''Dozens of privately financed health projects
have been either completed or are in the pipeline. All will bring the
best expertise from the private sector to the way we run our hospitals
without compromising in any way our commitment to free treatment for
every patient.''
However, Mrs Margaret Ewing, SNP Parliamentary leader and MP for
Moray, called the Stonehaven move an ''incredible proposition''.
She said: ''Nowhere in the UK do I know of an area where hospital
building and service delivery is being put out to competitive bids in
the private sector.
''Whatever the local board may say about 'new and imaginative'
suggestions it is a clear demonstration that health provision is
expected now to move from trusts to the private sector.''

A LOVELORN American lawyer has flown thousands of miles to Scotland in
a desperate bid to find his girlfriend -- so he can propose.
Romantic Anthony Penoso is frantically trying to track down his
Russian love Vera Plaxina before she leaves for Moscow on Tuesday.
Mr Penoso, 36, has plastered posters of 27-year-old Miss Plaxina on
lampposts all over Edinburgh and is spending his days tramping the
streets with a photo, asking passers-by if they recognise her.
He carries around a #1500 diamond engagement ring in his pocket,
waiting for that special moment when he finally finds her. He knows he
faces a massive race against time if he is to find her and declare his
everlasting love.
Mr Penoso, who owns his own law firm in Jacksonville, Florida, first
met Professor Plaxina when they were both on holiday in Copenhagen 18
months ago.
The first time their eyes met, he knew it was love. He said: ''We got
on really well from the start and there was definitely something there
from the moment we met.''
They wrote to each other for more than a year before he visited Moscow
for the first time last November.
He said: ''We decided then that what we had was special and we wanted
to make a firm commitment to each other. When I flew back I knew I had
to ask her to marry me. She is the only one for me.
''The problem was that she was in Moscow and I was on the other side
of the world, so it was a question of how I was going to ask her.''
His chance came at Easter when Miss Plaxina, who teaches at the Moscow
Commercial Institute, telephoned out of the blue to say she was going to
Scotland for a seminar for two weeks.
He said: ''I thought to myself 'Great, this is it, now's my chance',
so I told her I would meet her in Edinburgh.
''She said she would fax over the details of where she was staying so
we could meet but, on the day she was due to do it, my machine was
turned off and when I phoned her in Moscow her parents told me she had
already left for Scotland.''
The determined Romeo decided to come over anyway to track his
sweetheart down and surprise her by popping the question.
He arrived in Edinburgh on Thursday and has spent the past 48 hours
scouring the streets.
He said: ''I have phoned everywhere I can think of but so far without
luck. But there's still time yet. I only put the posters up today but
I've already had a call saying someone saw Vera in a shop in Princes
Street.''
Mr Penoso remains confident love will win the day.
He has even prepared a job for her at his law firm.
He said: ''I'll track her down no problem. I've got two days and I'll
do it. She'll see the posters or someone who knows her will. There's
time yet. I'm turning this city upside down and no stone will be left
unturned.
''When she does see me she'll get a hell of a shock but it will be the
most romantic proposal ever.''

FARMER Humphrey Errington has claimed a partial victory in the legal
battle to prevent a batch of his Lanark Blue cheese being destroyed,
after a court ruling that he had been denied natural justice.
Mr Errington, 50, of Walston Braehead, Ogscastle, Carnwath,
Lanarkshire, welcomed yesterday's Court of Session decision.
A judge ruled that he was denied natural justice when a Justice of the
Peace condemned 44 batches of his unpasteurised cheese, worth around
#27,000.
Clydesdale District Council took action against the cheesemaker
because of the presence of the food bacteria, Listeria Monocytogenes, in
samples of the cheese -- reputedly a favourite the royal family.
But at a private hearing the JP, Mrs Elizabeth Wilson, refused to
allow Mr Errington's lawyers to cross-examine witnesses on controversial
scientific evidence in the action in February this year.
Lord Weir set aside the JP's decision and said that because of the
complex issues involved in the case it would be desirable for any future
legal proceedings over the cheese to take place before an experienced
sheriff.
He was critical of the attitude adopted by Clydesdale District Council
in opposing cross-examination of expert witnesses at the hearing before
the JP.
He said: ''It is difficult to understand the reasons for such
opposition and I hope that if any further attempt is made to have Lanark
Blue cheese declared unfit for human consumption, the district council
will have full regard to the requirements of natural justice.''
Mr Errington said: ''This is a victory on a point of principle, which
will affect the way in which any local authority can or cannot ride
roughshod over a small person's rights.''
Clydesdale director of environmental health, Mr Bob Russell, said the
legal action would continue. ''We are disappointed that Lord Weir has
chosen to set aside the JP's decision but that in itself is not material
to the environmental health department's case.''
Mr Russell also questioned the Food Safety Act 1990 -- the legislation
under which the case was brought -- and said the role of JPs in hearings
would now have to be clarified.
Mr Russell said he would meet with legal advisers on Wednesday to
discuss the next step.
But Mr Errington dismissed the director's comments as ''brushing aside
something of fundamental importance''.
And he promised that the legal contest would continue. He said: ''We
are confident that there is no evidence the cheese is unfit to eat and
we want to try and prove that at a fair hearing in front of a sheriff.
But it is not going to be easy.''
Mr Errington said he was relieved that they had won the first stage
but admitted he still had a mountain to climb, despite maintaining that
the cheese was perfectly safe.
But Mr Errington said the huge public backing he had received -- which
included a #15,000 fighting fund and hundreds of supportive letters --
had not only made the judicial review possible, but also encouraged him
to continue the fight.
The next step, he said, would be to make a complaint to the Local
Government Ombudsman over alleged maladministration by the council for
not following procedures laid down in the 1990 Act.
He is continuing to make the cheese, now with a voluntary health
warning to people who may be vulnerable to listeriosis from any blue
cheese, such as pregnant women and the elderly. But he admits a council
victory in the future would leave him bankrupt.

<HEADLINE>Bamber fails in 'life' appeal</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978649330</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAN serving a life sentence for murdering five members of his family
has lost his High Court bid to challenge the Home Secretary's ruling
that he should die in prison.
Jeremy Bamber's plea for the right to a judicial review hearing was
seen as a test case affecting other multiple killers who have been told
their life sentences literally mean life, but a judge ruled yesterday
was ''doomed to failure''.
He was jailed in 1986 for murdering his adoptive parents Neville and
June Bamber, his stepsister Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twins at
the family's farmhouse in Essex.
His counsel, Mr Richard Clayton, said he did not shrink from
acknowledging the enormity of the crimes of which Bamber was convicted.
However, he said others convicted of heinous crimes, including the
killing of police officers, terrorist bombings, and other mass murders,
had not been given ''whole life'' sentences: Bamber had been unfairly
and unjustly denied the right to know why he had been treated
differently.
Rejecting the application, Mr Justice Popplewell said no material had
been hidden from Bamber.
The reasoning given by the Home Secretary in a letter last December,
and backed up by a second letter sent this week, why the killer had to
remain in jail until he died for his ''horrifying'' crimes was ''quite
ample''. It was quite unnecessary for further reasons to be given.
''If leave were to be given, this application would be doomed to
failure,'' said the judge.
Bamber had claimed Mrs Caffell, who had a history of mental illness,
shot her family before turning the gun on herself.
The trial judge, Mr Justice Drake, recommended that Bamber serve a
minimum of 25 years and Lord Lane, then the Lord Chief Justice, agreed
but added that ''for my part I would never release him''.
That recommendation, the court heard yesterday, weighed heavily when
Mr Douglas Hurd, then Home Secretary, decided to fix a sentence tariff
which meant that Bamber would remain in prison for his ''natural life''.
Last December, Bamber and 14 other mandatory life prisoners were told
by Home Secretary Michael Howard that, for them, their life sentences
would mean life.
He was obliged to tell them and give them a chance to make
representations following a House of Lords ruling that the tariff system
should be more open.
Bamber's legal team wanted to argue at a full court hearing that the
''whole life'' system is arbitrary and almost impossible to challenge
because it is still subject to unwarranted secrecy, with no clear
indication of the Home Secretary's policy and reasoning.
Mr Neil Garnham, for the Home Secretary, told the court Bamber's
application for judicial review was ''misconceived'' as the Minister
would look at his case afresh after receiving his representations.
''The correct time to consider a challenge will be after he has made
representations,'' said Mr Garnham.
A renewed application before the Court of Appeal is being considered.

<HEADLINE>Industrial tribunal rules that nine must get the cash for doing the work of principals Equal pay win for women teachers</HEADLINE>

NINE female secondary school teachers in Strathclyde region have won
equal pay claims.
The women were responsible for running a subject department but were
not paid as principal teachers.
Through their union, the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association,
they claimed equality of pay with a named male principal teacher.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow found that they should be paid a
PT's salary from the point at which they took on the duites.
The judgment does not, however, mean that the women will be appointed
principal teachers.
SSTA general secretary Alan Lamont said there were claims from other
members and he hoped pay agreements could be reached without resort to a
tribunal.
The women came forward after another SSTA member, Ms Dorothy Tedman,
successfully claimed in 1990 that she carried out the duties of a PT,
although she had not been one.
A Strathclyde region official said: ''We are considering the judgment
and will be deliberating on whether or not to appeal.''
* In another industrial tribunal hearing, a senior further education
college lecturer with an ''excellent'' record of service has been
awarded the maximum compensation for being unfairly dismissed.
Mrs Sandra Lewis, who had worked at Borders College in Galashiels for
10 years before her dismissal last year, has been awarded #11,000 by an
industrial tribunal.
Upholding her complaint, the tribunal in Edinburgh said Mrs Lewis'
redundancy was ''manifestly unfair''.
Her union, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Association,
called on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to act on the results of a board
of management investigation into the management of the college.
SFHEA general secretary Graham Alison said Mr Lang had asked the
college board to investigate complaints sent to him by members of staff.
He said: ''The board had been required to respond to the Scottish
Office by the end of January but now, at the end of April, the outcome
is still awaited.
''Now that Mrs Lewis' complaint has been unanimously upheld, perhaps
the Secretary of State will be moved to act.''
Mrs Lewis has been looking for a job since being made redundant last
July. She said last night: ''The chances in an area like the Borders,
where there is only one FE college, are very limited, so I will be
looking to change direction in my career.
''I am glad about the tribunal judgment for my own sake, because I
felt I was unfairly dismissed, but also because I hope it will encourage
other members of staff who are unhappy about the style of management at
the college.
''The atmosphere is not particularly pleasant,'' she said.
Mrs Lewis was employed as a senior lecturer in health studies but she
was verbally offered a part-time job after the college decided to change
the emphasis in her teaching remit -- towards social care and away from
nursery nursing, the area in which she had particular expertise.
Mrs Lewis was made redundant after she turned down the offer. The
tribunal agreed with her reasons for turning it down.
It criticised the college for failing to provide sufficient evidence
that it had applied the relevant redundancy procedures, and for leaving
Mrs Lewis ''in limbo'' about her future for six months.
There were other criticisms of the way the college handled the case.
No-one from senior management was available to comment.

<HEADLINE>Minister hits out at Kirk's own 'Clause 4 situation'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978649333</RECORDNO>

THE Clydebank minister who challenged his presbytery in the Court of
Session has hit out at the justice of the procedures under which he will
now be tried.
The Kirk, he said, now had its own constitutional ''Clause 4''
situation to resolve.
He has, however, accepted his suspension following the ruling this
week by a judge that he had no jurisdiction in the internal affairs of
the Kirk.
The Rev Tom Logan, charged by his presbytery with disobedience of
their instructions regarding his activities with a sales networking
organisation, will be suspended on full pay until a new date is fixed
for his trial by the Presbytery of Dumbarton next Tuesday.
Mr Logan's solicitor, Mr Colin Cameron, yesterday issued a statement
in which he said Mr Logan would strenuously maintain his innocence at
the trial and regretting the presbytery had sought a suspension.
Mr Cameron's statement said that the judgment by Lord Osborne in the
Court of Session on Article 4 of the Kirk's constitution had highlighted
a ''Clause 4'' situation for the Kirk.
''It might take a leaf out of the Labour Party's book and face up to
the issue by redefining it (Article 4) to ensure that matters which
would in 1995 be regarded as temporal are treated as such.''
By dealing itself with the matter the Kirk could avoid them being
taken out of its control and tested in courts outwith Scotland.
The statement criticised the procedure by which Mr Logan will be
tried, the 1935 Act for Trial by Libel. While acknowledging that the
presbytery has correctly followed the procedures, Mr Cameron contends
that apart from two assessors, those who will hear the case -- Mr
Logan's presbytery colleagues -- will be judge, jury, and prosecutors.
''The presbytery is a court of the land and its provisions under the
1935 Act would be untenable in any other civil or criminal court in the
country. This patent denial of natural justice and human rights to its
ministers should be a matter of concern to ordinary members of the
church.''
The Rev Alastair Symington, who will chair the tribunal that will
decide Mr Logan's fate, was unable to comment on the case but is
understood to have asked Mr Cameron to explain previous published
remarks comparing Kirk courts to the Mikado.
The minister who will conduct the case against Mr Logan, the Rev John
Cairns, was also bound to silence on the case but after the Court of
Session ruling on Wednesday commented: ''I can understand why people
outside the church might think the Court of Session had jurisdiction,
but cannot understand why a minister or lawyer who had read the (Kirk's)
constitution would think that it had.''
Proceedings against ministers under trial by libel are rare and it is
possible that, because of all the controversy over procedure, the
presbytery will decide that Mr Logan should be tried for the alternative
offence of contempt of his presbytery, which would be simpler to effect
but carry the same penalty.

ROCK singer Rod Stewart was given permission yesterday to hold a
concert at Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen on June 8.
More than 400 people had objected but promoter Barry Marshall assured
the council's licensing committee that noise levels would be bearable to
those outside.
There was no objection by the police.
The concert is the start of a world tour and is expected to be a
25,000 sell-out.
The singer was also successful at a hearing involving his local
council, when he was given retrospective application for planning
permission after constructing a full-size football pitch at his mansion
in Epping, east London.
He built it at a cost of #50,000 five months ago at his grade two
listed nineteenth century mansion, The Wood House.
It has already been used for matches by Stewart and teams from local
police and fire brigade.

A MAN has appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court charged with two of the
firearms offences which helped spark a major police offensive in the
town, codenamed Operation Dragon.
Mr John McLaughlin, 26, of Gockston Road, Shortroods, Paisley, made a
brief appearance in private before Sheriff Ronald Smith.
He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody.
It is alleged that while acting along with others on March 12 in a car
park in the town's Storie Street, he attempted to murder Mr John
Kennedy, c/o police, by repeatedly striking him about the head with a
firearm or similar instrument, forcing it into his mouth, and shooting
him in the leg to his severe injury.
A second charge claims that he attempted to murder Mr John Kelly by
repeatedly discharging a firearm at him and shooting him in the head to
his severe injury, permanent disfigurement, and impairment in the Park
Bar, Thomas Street, on March 12.

THE leader of the Scottish National Party, Mr Alex Salmond, last night
attacked sectarianism in Scottish society and promised to end
institutionalised discrimination against Roman Catholics in his party's
Scottish Constitution.
''With the current public standing of the royals, it may seem a matter
of little import that no Catholic can assume the throne or marry the
heir to the throne,'' he said. ''But for a country to maintain such a
prejudice at the centre of its structures in the last decade of the
twentieth century is a scandal of immense proportions.''
Mr Salmond added: ''The barriers against Catholic participation in
public life were erected in very different times but their remnants
still litter the archaic British State.
''Until very recently, because of the intertwining of the established
Church of England and the supposed British governmental system,
Catholics have had difficulty in fulfilling the duties of the great
offices of State, and we have never had a Catholic Prime Minister of
Great Britain.
''Whilst it is technically feasible that such an appointment could be
made, it is practically difficult.''
He was speaking yesterday at Stirling University where he delivered
the Williamson Lecture, given in memory of student Andrew Williamson who
died in a road accident in 1981.
Father Danny McLoughlin, spokesman for the Catholic Church in
Scotland, last night welcomed Mr Salmond's comments.
''We are very pleased that Mr Salmond is addressing the discrimination
which is enthroned in law in this country. We feel that it is long
overdue,'' he said. ''It really has been a quiet insult to the loyal
Catholic community of this country.''
He added: ''We would like to see all discrimination against Catholics
in this country removed. I think most Catholics are aware that for high
political office there is a prohibition on Catholics, and most are aware
that a monarch cannot be, or marry, a Catholic.
''Clearly, the possibilities of it affecting a Catholic are pretty
slim but the very fact that such a prohibition exists has to be seen as
an insult to the loyal Catholic community of this country . . .''

FOR Alex Malcolm, who has looked after the world-famous flock of geese
which guard Allied Distillers bonded warehouse at Newtown, Dumbarton,
for the past 17 years, it is time to take a gander at the world of
retirement. Yesterday he handed over the Head Gooseman's Staff and Ring
Book to his successor, Arthur Carroll, in a ceremony which involved
piper Peter MacInnes playing a special Gooseman's Piobairaechd to mark
the changeover.
The Gooseman has a unique position with the Scotch whisky industry,
and is responsible for the welfare of the flock, for supervising new
hatchings, and for ensuring that the geese perform their guard duties
properly. The geese guard 500,000 casks of single malt and single grain
whiskies at the bonded warehouse. They were introduced in 1959 by
manager Tom Scott as a reminder of the flock of geese which, according
to legend, were used by the Romans to guard Antonine's Wall at Old
Kilpatrick nearby.

THE appointment of a senior Strathclyde official as chief executive of
the new Glasgow shadow unitary authority has infuriated Glasgow district
councillors.
The decision yesterday caused such shock at the City Chambers, serious
consideration was being given to challenging it in the new council's
Labour Group, despite the selection panel having been empowered to make
a selection.
The #96,000-a-year post went to Mr John Anderson, 47, depute chief
executive at Strathclyde region, with the selection panel dividing 5-4
between him and Glasgow's town clerk, Mr Thomas Monaghan, 48.
The fury of district councillors was largely directed at Councillor
Jean McFadden: she broke ranks with her current district council
colleagues to swing the vote in favour of the regional candidate.
There was also anger from some of her faction who have supported her
through the years in her long-running struggles against the current
district council Labour leader, Councillor Patrick Lally.
Mrs McFadden, who recently defeated Mr Lally for the convenership of
the new shadow authority, was one of five current district councillors
on the selection panel. The others were Councillors Robert Gray, Gordon
Macdiarmid, Susan Baird, and John Young -- a lone Conservative.
From the current regional council there were Councillors Robert Gould
(Labour leader of the shadow authority), Des McNulty, Gerald McGrath,
and Bob Marshall.
The four regional councillors voted for Mr Anderson and four district
councillors voted for Mr Monaghan. There was a distinct sense of shock
among the current district councillors when Mrs McFadden swung the vote
in favour of Mr Anderson.
Informed sources at the City Chambers were claiming afterwards that
Mrs McFadden's action may well cost her support should she run for the
Lord Provostship of the Glasgow Council when it assumes full powers next
April.
With calls for the matter to be raised in the Labour Group gathering
strength, calmer voices were warning, however, that any action to
overturn the selction panel's decision could land the new council in
serious legal difficulties, given that Mr Anderson would not now be
seeking interviews for any other posts.
It is understood the main objection to Mr Anderson's appointment is
based on fears it will lead to the development of a strong chief
executive's corporate section which would have all the departments of
the council cascading down from it and acting as an intermediary between
councillors and service departments.
The current district council system lays more emphasis on service
departments being directly responsible to their committees.
There is also disquiet over a procedural technicality in his
application form.
Although not forming any part of a potential objection, district
councillors were further concerned that the decision would almost
certainly damage, or even terminate the career of an official who played
a crucial part in Glasgow winning the right to be City of Architecture
in 1999.
However, Mr Monaghan, who was appointed Glasgow's Town Clerk under the
aegis of Mr Lally's current Labour administration in the district
council, wasted no time in phoning Mr Anderson and promising him full
support during the transition period.
He said: ''John Anderson and I were both credible candidates and the
councillors had to make a choice. I've got no beef about that.''
Mr Monaghan did concede he had a problem in that the Glasgow job was
the only one he applied for since he had wanted to end his career in the
city. He would now have to consider his future, but emphasised that many
other officials were facing this dilemma.
Mr Anderson said he was looking forward to the challenge of his new
post. One of his first tasks would be to develop some kind of corporate
management structure for the new council.
Meanwhile, other shadow councils in Scotland were appointing chief
executives.
South Lanarkshire chose Mr Alastair MacNish, a depute director of
social work with Strathclyde region.
Mr Keith Yates, assistant chief executive of Central region, takes
charge of the new Stirling Council.
Mr Ian Fraser Smith, chief executive of Dumfries and Galloway Regional
Council, is to be chief executive of the new Dumfries and Galloway
Council.
Mr Bob Allan has been appointed chief executive of the new Clackmannan
Council. He is chief executive of Clackmannan District Council.

THE volunteer charity, Edinburgh Direct Aid, yesterday pledged to
continue its missions to war-torn Bosnia and Croatia, despite the
group's chairman being hit by a sniper.
As Dr Denis Rutovitz was recovering from a gunshot wound in hospital
in Zagreb last night, and fears grew for the safety of aid workers
operating in the battle zone, Dr Jeanne Bell, his wife, said:
''Edinburgh Direct Aid will continue as long as there is need in Bosnia.
''How we actually do things and run convoys in future is not clear to
me at the moment.
''There is no way that we will stop supporting and helping the
Bosnians.''
Dr Rutovitz, 66, was hit in the shoulder by sniper machine gun fire on
Thursday night as he led a convoy of nine trucks into Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital. They were heading for Hrasnica, a ''safe'' suburb,
travelling over Mount Igman, an area thought to be a frequent scene of
skirmishes and gunfire.
In an interview screened by the BBC, Dr Rutovitz said: ''I was lucky.
It was a heavy calibre bullet and it got mostly stopped in the flak
jacket. It went on into the chest but not apparently into the lung,
fortunately for me.
''I am sure I will go back. Obviously I have to take into account the
worries and concerns of my wife and my children. I think my wife Jeanne
understands. We can't just fold our tents and go away just because we
have run into trouble.''
In July 1993, an EDA volunteer, schoolteacher Mrs Christine Witcutt,
52, was killed by a bullet while a passenger in an aid convoy leaving
Sarajevo.
Dr Rutovitz was taken to the UN first aid post in Sarajevo where he
underwent surgery on a flesh wound and was flown out of the city
yesterday to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, where he is expected to
convalesce for a few days.
Dr Bell, who is vice-chairman of the charity, said the news of her
husband had been broken to her when she returned home to Edinburgh from
business in London on Thursday night.
She said the remaining members of the party of 12 were still in Bosnia
and en route to their base in Split, but stressed their work had not yet
been completed.
''The plans for that obviously will be reviewed,'' she said.
Dr Bell emphasised the volunteer helpers were made fully aware of the
dangers before leaving for Bosnia.
''It's never been without risk. It is clearly a risk now but that has
been very real to us for a long time and was brought home to us by
Christine Witcutt in July 1993. If we needed a lesson in how dangerous
it was, that was it,'' she said.
''Everybody on the convoy goes out with that knowledge.''
She said she did not plan to fly out to the Balkans to join her
husband.
''If Denis was the only person concerned, I'd be straight on the
plane, but the rest of our team are still in Bosnia,'' she said.
The 23rd convoy from the Scottish-based charity group left Edinburgh a
month ago to deliver 11,000 food parcels on behalf of the Soros

CONSERVATIVE leadership came under fire yesterday from two very
different sources in Perthshire.
While the Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, was addressing
his party's Scottish Conference in Perth and declaring the Government to
be in terminal decline, up the road in Dunkeld local Tory MP Bill Walker
was telling his constituency annual meeting that party leaders should
either shape up or move over.
The Tayside North MP declared party leaders ''should go and let others
take on the task'' if unable to fill the gap. The time had passed for
slick, easy answers.
Mr Ashdown said the Conservatives were destined for a period in
Opposition, during which they would tear themselves apart and re-emerge
as an anti-European party.
At the same time, he gave a cautious welcome to overtures from Labour
leader Tony Blair about possible future co-operation between the
parties.
The strategy for survival presented by Mr Walker goes much further
than the outburst by former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart, who
last week also used the AGM of his constituency party to break ranks.
The Eastwood MP was at pains to avoid direct attacks on the Scottish
leadership, although suggesting policies were suspect.
However, in Dunkeld last night, Mr Walker clearly indicated his
striking dissatisfaction with the party hierarchy's failure to be
believed by the electorate. The timing of his criticisms proved
particularly embarrassing.
The Tory offensive in the neighbouring Perth and Kinross constituency
-- involving Social Security Minister Peter Lilley and local candidate
John Godfrey -- immediately ran straight into Mr Walker's harsh words.
In addition, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and his deputy, Lord Fraser
of Carmyllie, face tough talking from Tories at private meetings today
in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Mr Walker said: ''The disturbing truth is that our leaders here are no
longer believed . . . the situation is now desperately serious. We
simply cannot sit back and wait for something to turn up.''
He was especially critical of party leaders in Scotland, unidentified
in the speech -- arguing the local election results could not be blamed
on mid-term blues or party divisions over Europe.
Unless they listened, and brought forward proposals to deal with the
massive credibility gap, then they should go and let others take on the
task.
He believed continuing economic good news would probably restore Tory
fortunes in England, and might also be enough to secure victory at the
next General Election.
However, the improvement in the economy ''would not be enough in
Scotland''. The chickens had come home to roost, with warning signals
staring the MP in the face for years.
Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat leader, in a cautious welcome to
co-operation with Labour, said: ''If this is the parliament to change
the culture of our politics so that people with different views can work
together, then I welcome that,'' he said.
Mr Ashdown also indicated a degree of scepticism, pointing to Labour's
''bullying, monopolistic attitude'' on local authorities and saying:
''The message to Tony Blair is that people will judge him on his
actions, not his words.''
0 However, Mr Ashdown reserved his harshest words for the
Conservatives.
''The break-up of the Tory Party is now almost inevitable,'' he said.
''This is a party at war with itself. There will be moves in Opposition
to remodel it as the anti-European party. It will go through what Labour
did in the seventies and eighties.''

<HEADLINE>Two in hospital have flesh-eating disease</HEADLINE>

EXPERTS in necrotising fasciitis warned yesterday that the
flesh-eating disease is on the increase in Scotland after two people
were admitted to a hospital suffering from the bacterium.
One person was admitted to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee on Thursday
night while the other was taken in last week.
A hospital spokesman, asked for condition reports, said: ''We can't
give any because the news has come from a consultant and he is away for
the weekend.''
With three deaths and six cases in Scotland in the past year,
microbiologist Dr David Parratt and surgeon Richard Holdsworth, both
based at Ninewells, said doctors should not regard the disease
''flippantly''.
The two doctors have written a paper to be published later this month
in the Scottish Medical Journal. They state that the infection ''appears
to be an increasing problem'' and they stress: ''There should be an
increased awareness of all the potential manifestations of this
organism, but particularly an increased vigilance regarding soft-tissue
infection.
''Most importantly, the severity and rapidity of the onset of
infection should not be underestimated. These infections can develop
rapidly and prove fatal within 24 hours.''
Against a background of three of the cases occurring within a 30-mile
radius of Stirling, they say: ''There is a requirement for a central
registration of all infections to classify clusters of cases.''
Dr Holdsworth said yesterday: ''We need a central register of these
cases so that we can find out more about their epidemiology. It is a
matter for the Scottish Office to consider.''
However, last night the Scottish Office said that such a facility
already existed. A spokesman said: ''Such a data base already exists at
the Scottish Centre for Infections and Environmental Health at Ruchill
Hospital in Glasgow.
''They have developed a comprehensive surveillance system in
collaboration with colleagues at the Communicable Disease Centre in
London.''
* Only two weeks ago scientists claimed they had made a major
breakthrough in the battle to beat necrotising fasciitis. They said that
tests on animals showed the drug clindamycin was effective.
