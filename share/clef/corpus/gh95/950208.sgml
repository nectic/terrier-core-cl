ABERDEEN believe their decision to sack Willie Miller was the correct
one, and having placed their faith in his assistant Roy Aitken to see
them through to the end of the season, they can do no more than hope and
pray. Somebody up there had better be listening.
The spectre of relegation has the club by the ankles.The place below
beckons and the next 12 league matches will determine whether or not the
Pittodrie side will survive.The first division is a difficult
environment from which not many escape.
Aberdeen are only one of three Scottish League clubs never to have
been relegated -- Rangers and Celtic are the others -- but there is a
devious, almost malicious side to football which occasionally claims as
victims the biggest names.
Aitken has much to do, beginning with the game against Rangers at
Pittodrie on Sunday. The Sabbath would be as good a day as any to start
if he is going to halt the decline, but can he do it? Does he have the
managerial experience? Does he possess the credibility?
The dismissal of Miller, I suspect, may have taken Aberdeen only half
way towards safety. If, as has been suggested, he lost the dressing
room, then we are entitled to wonder if Aitken can provide the impetus
required to drag the club away from relegation.
After all, the former Celtic and Scotland captain has been working
closely with the players for many months, yet they have failed to
function to their full capabilities. It could have been because Miller
was calling the shots, making the final decisions, but if the players
were on the same wavelength as Aitken, would they not have responded?
If he can't engineer their escape, the decision to get rid of Miller
will have lost any significance. When it became clear to the directors
that he had to go, perhaps they should have resolved to appoint a new
manager as quickly as possible. Perhaps they ought to have looked to
Jimmy Nicholl.
The Raith Rovers manager has an agreement with his employers which
would allow him to move on if a bigger club wanted to take him as
manager, and there is little doubt Nicholl would relish an opportunity
to lead a club like Aberdeen. However, the most appealing quality about
Nicholl is that he has management experience, and has shown himself to
be a winner.
The former Manchester United, Rangers, and Northern Ireland player
took his first-division side to a remarkable Coca Cola Cup triumph
earlier this season, beating two premier-divison sides -- Kilmarnock in
the third round and Celtic in the final -- and he has also managed the
Stark's Park side in the premier division.
Nicholl has demonstrated he has an ability to tempt the best from
players and to make the most of limited resources.
In short, he is precisely the kind of manager Aberdeen need, and they
should have been brave enough to approach Stark's Park.
It just might be that Aberdeen are reluctant to make the kind of
changes, which I believe are required because they have probably had
give Miller a pay-off of more than #100,000 and Nicholl could cost them
as much as #100,000 in compensation to Raith Rovers. Also, a new manager
would want his own people around him, and Aitken and Drew Jarvie might
have had to be paid off.
In all, it would have been a tidy sum, and one Ian Donald and his
directors might have been loathe to pay because the club is still
heavily in debt after having built the Dick Donald Stand.
The price of relegation will be much higher.

WHAT do the following have in common: Rugby, Eton, Harrow and
MacNabbs? No, that's not right. What about: Rugby, Eton, Harrow and
Dollar? That's better. And the answer, of course, is that they are all
schools which are better known than the places they take their names
from.
Dollar Academy, the private school in the small Hillfoots town 13
miles east of Stirling on the A91, was set up in 1818 with a bequest
from John MacNabb (1732-1802), a local herd-boy who had risen to wealth
as a sea captain and settled at Mile End in London. He left half his
fortune 'for the endowment of a charity or school for the poor of the
Parish of Dollar'.
In its early days it was known as MacNabb's Institution, and by 1882 a
principal and 20 teachers were giving instruction to 402 paying and 110
free scholars.
Today, the families of the Academy's staff and pupils account for
about a third of the town's population, and there is no denying the
effect the school has on the local property market.
A recent factor is the decrease in the number of boarders and the
relatively higher proportion of the 1100 girls and boys of all ages who
are day-pupils.
Dollar also has a good primary school, Strathdevon. The local State
secondary is Alva Academy.
The area manager for Allen &amp; Harris, Malcolm Cordwell-Smith, says: 'In
February and March there is a window in the market. There's usually more
activity when parents know their children have been accepted for Dollar
Academy.
'In the last 20 years new homes have drawn people to the area, though
there is a lack of properties for the first-time buyer.'
Martin Turner, manager at Clyde Property, says: 'There is a marked
social divide in the town, and there is a heavy demand for the older
part of Dollar, with the top end of the market in stone villas around
the Academy, Manor House Road, and Back Road.'
As well as the traditional property, Dollar has a good selection of
quality new-build by Wimpey, starting at around A55,000 for a
semi-detached house, and detached 'executive' bungalows and villas by
Richmond Homes at The Ness.
Gloria Gauld is selling the four-bedroom Carbisdale villa within the
established Richmond Homes development at a fixed price of A127,000, and
the Sordale four-bedroom bungalow-style home with integral double garage
at A123,000 fixed.
Brian Moran at Gloria Gauld says: 'Each of the Hillfoots villages has
its own loyal following, and they all represent good value for money.
Dollar is slightly more expensive than some, and on a par with Lower
Bridge of Allan, Blairlogie (another Hillfoots village) and
Cambuskenneth (on the outskirts of Stirling). Traditional property in
Stirling is sought-after and can be very expensive. Dollar and the
Hillfoots can meet this demand.'
Dollar and the other Hillfoots villages, Tillicoultry, Alva and
Menstrie, grew up beside the pure, soft-water burns flowing down from
the Ochils and, with good hill-grazing, strong links developed with the
woollen industry.
Janice Graham, joint office manager at Slater Hogg &amp; Howison, says:
'Dollar is more exclusive and more popular than other Hillfoots
villages, though still representing good value for money.'
The town is well placed for commuting to Glasgow and Edinburgh via the
Kincardine Bridge and the motorway network. Stirling, Alloa. Falkirk and
Dunfermline are within a 16-mile radius.
Dollar has an 18-hole golf course, tennis and bowling clubs, and
excellent local pubs, restaurants and hotels some serving the real ale
of the local Harviestoun Brewery. Among the local shops there is a small
supermarket. Mill Green Park, the cherry-tree lined Dollar Burn and the
fairytale Dollar Glen offer appealing walks.
From 1493 to 1605, most of the parish of Dollar belonged to the Earls
of Argyll, and a mile north of the town, high above the wooded ravines
of the Burns of Sorrow and Care, lies the romantic, fifteenth-century
Castle Campbell.
The castle, which looks down the glen and over the town to the flat
land beyond, was once called The Gloume, from an old Gaelic word, and
the hill across the glen is called Gloom Hill. Today, however, the
outlook for Dollar's property market is far from gloomy.

ROY Aitken will be the new manager of Aberdeen if he saves the club
from relegation and makes an impact in the Scottish Cup.
And he revealed yesterday that Willie Miller had helped persuade him
to accept the challenge of succeeding him at Pittodrie.
Aitken, who had been Miller's No.2, agreed to go on trial as caretaker
manager until the end of the season to prove his credentials.
He said: ''Willie Miller brought me to this club and it is sad to see
him leave. But he went with his pride and integrity intact.
''I have learned a lot from him as he was an outstanding professional
and, in fact, I spoke at length to him about the job and he encouraged
me in making my decision to accept.
''I have now been given the opportunity to step up in a caretaker
capacity. The fans know how committed I am to this club.
''I have already turned down moves to other clubs to remain here. I
have shown commitment on and off the park. Now, I'd like to take that
commitment a stage further.
''I will do my best. Results and performances will dictate my future.
But I am hoping that my future will be long-term with Aberdeen.''
But Aitken admitted that he faces the toughest challenge of his career
to clinch the Pittodrie post.
With Aberdeen still #2m in debt through building the Richard Donald
stand, it has been made clear there is no money available to buy his way
out of trouble.
Aitken, who refused an offer to manage Motherwell during the close
season, will begin his 12-match run for survival on Sunday against
Rangers at Pittodrie.
He added: ''We are in a very difficult position in the league where we
will have to fight tooth and nail to escape.
''But there are 36 points still to be played for. My approach will be
to take as many as possible and go as far as we possibly can in the
Scottish Cup.
''Willie Miller felt that the players had not responded in the way he
expected. I will be looking at their commitment between now and the end
of the season but I am sure they will react positively.
''I believe we have the quality of players here to get us out of
trouble. But everyone must come together and do their best.
''We can do all the talking we like but we must do it on the park by
getting results.''
And the man who captained Celtic and Scotland welcomed the fact that
it is Rangers who will be in opposition in his first game in charge.
''They are the top team but I am certain that players and fans alike
will respond to the challenge.
''I know that if we play to our capabilities we can cause them
problems. We have done that in the past and can do so again.''
Aberdeen chairman Ian Donald, announcing the appointment, said: ''We
have faith in Roy, otherwise we would not have asked him to take on the
job.
''He will be in charge until the end of the season. Beyond that, he is
now in a position where he can prove to us that he is the man to manage
Aberdeen FC.
''We are delighted that he has expressed the wish to stay here and
battle for our cause.''

Clyde 1, Dundee United 5
THE first ever Scottish Cup tie played at Broadwood, and Dundee
United's first visit to the Cumbernauld ground, will not be remembered
fondly by Clyde, who found the gulf in standards between themselves and
the Tannadice side as wide as their astute manager, Alex Smith, had
feared.
The second-division squad recovered well after an early setback, but
it was only a matter of time before United made their superior skills
and conditioning tell, although their manager, Ivan Golac, could not
have been pleased with the number of errors made by his side.
The holders never appeared totally secure at the back, but they did
ease into a Tennents Scottish Cup fourth-round tie away to Huntly even
if the scoreline flattered them.
As you would expect, however, Golac is talking his side up and before
heading back to Dundee last night, he said: ''I'll see you all at 4.45pm
on May 27 at Hampden.''
Smith is more concerned with leading Clyde out of the second division,
and he took heart from some performances in the tie which would have
remained much closer had his defence not been naive enough to allow
United to score the second and third goals.
Reality first tugged at Clyde in 11 minutes when they fell victims to
a carefully structured goal which ended with Billy McKinlay nodding in
his fifth goal of the season.
Clyde, to their credit, responded swiftly and when Keith Knox darted
into United's box four minutes later Maurice Malpas used illegal means
to obstruct him. Ian Angus sent Kelham O'Hanlon the wrong way from the
spot.
However, when Gordan Petric headed the ball against the bar in 36
minutes and was allowed to make contact with the rebound, Smith's
instincts told him his side were about to go behind again. Petric's
second attempt was helped on by David Craig.
In the dying moments of the first half United put the issue beyond
reasonable doubt when David Hannah scored. The fourth was a spectacular
shot from 20 yards by Dave Bowman, and substitute Jerren Nixon scored a
sweet fifth.
CLYDE -- Fridge, O'Neill, Angus, Nisbet, Thomson, Brown, Dickson,
Watson, Parks, Knox, MacKenzie. Substitutes -- Neil, Prunty, Hillcoat.
DUNDEE UNITED -- O'Hanlon, McInally, Malpas, Hannah, Petric, Dailly,
Bowman, McKinlay, Brewster, Ristic, Craig. Substitutes -- Welsh, Nixon,
Jorgensen.
Referee -- J Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).

PETER Dods, the Gala coach, has called for the Scottish Rugby Union to
compensate all senior representative-level players for lost wages.
The 1984 Grand Slam full back was speaking as he confirmed that two of
his side's brightest stars, younger brother Michael and Scotland centre
Gregor Townsend, have signed provisional forms with the English first
division side Northampton.
He declared: ''We have to do something to stop our top players
drifting South. What's wrong with the SRU paying lost wages for players
in the A side and even the Under-21s? These guys are having to take huge
amounts of time off work, and it really eats into their regular holiday
entitlement.
''Even an A game means three days off work, and last week, the U-21
player, Matt McGrandles, had to leave his job because he couldn't get
time off to play against Ireland.''
However, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said last night: ''Under
International Board regulations, we are permitted to compensate only
members of the full side who lose wages to a maximum of #40-a-day.
''The Union is aware of the problem of players moving to England,
although every year we see names mentioned in the media, and in most
cases nothing comes of it. However, it is a potential problem which our
president, Ken Smith, addressed initially at the last agm, when he
appealed for rugby-supporting employers to give job preference to rugby
players.
''I can't go into detail at the moment but I can assure you that we
are aware of the problem, and the committee is actively looking at ways
and means whereby Scottish players could be helped,'' he added.
Townsend and Dods Jr, who won his first cap as a temporary replacement
against Ireland last season and played two more games during Scotland's
summer tour to Argentina, are just the latest in a line of top Scottish
players attracted to the English game.
Last week it was revealed that GHK's Shade Munro and Rowen Shepherd,
of Edinburgh Academicals, had signed provisional registration forms for
the West Hartlepool club, where they would be joining Scottish
internationalists Rob Wainwright and Derrick Patterson.
If Dods and Townsend decide to take up their option with Northampton
then they would be joining forces with Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam coach
Ian McGeechan, who is now the club's director of rugby.
Brian Renwick, the Hawick No.8, also confirmed yesterday that he had
turned down an invitation to join London Scottish immediately so that he
could play for them in their crucial Courage League Division 2 game
against Fylde on Saturday.
Renwick said: ''I signed provisional forms for them last season and so
I could have gone and played in the league right away, but I have
decided to stay with Hawick in the meantime as we try to secure our
top-eight place so that we get into the new first division next season.
''I have told London Scottish that I might be available next season
but not just now. The Scottish rugby grapevine is buzzing with
approaches from English clubs. I would reckon that 20 or 30 of
Scotland's top players have been approached,'' he said.
Renwick, 27, who played for Scotland at schools and under-21 level
before a bad knee injury sidelined him for two years, said that rugby
was undergoing a revolution, and that the days when a player would
remain at a single club for life were over.
''The big English clubs are desperate to put together strong squads,
and because the game in England is financially healthy they are able to
put together attractive jobs packages for Scots who want to go south,''
he said.
Peter Dods, who has said that he would quit the game if the drift of
Scots to England became a mass exodus, added: ''Michael signed for West
Hartlepool last season but we put together a sponsored-car deal with a
local garage, and he was made captain so we managed to keep him.
''I don't know whether we'll manage to hold on to him this time.
Gregor will be finishing university soon and, obviously, for both of
them the attraction of playing top-grade rugby in England with a good
job to go as well is very attractive.
''At the end of the day guys have got to make a living, and eventually
it comes down to money. I'm not saying that English clubs are paying
wages but because of the better employment situation down south, and the
sponsorship deals that the clubs can negotiate they can made very
attractive offers to our players,'' he said.

NOT an hour had passed since the end of the international at
Murrayfield on Saturday when a man instructed me: ''Get stuck into that
fussy Welsh referee in your piece on Monday,'' or words to that effect.
I wanted to tell him that Mr Derek Bevan is one of the finest refs in
the world -- that is why he has had charge of more internationals than
anybody else -- and that in my opinion he had just performed well. But I
couldn't be bothered staying around for the aggro.
In rugby grandstands all over the country, red-faced men roar out:
''Get him on side,'' with monotonous regularity and usually from
distances where the imaginary offside line is invisible. ''Wake up,
referee,'' another firm favourite, wins no prizes for originality or
constructive criticism.
It may be, though, that our rugby whistlers should count themselves
fortunate. After English soccer referee Rodger Gifford had sent off
Blackburn Rovers goalkeeper Tim Flowers last week, a supporter
physically attacked him.
The control of Rangers' manager Walter Smith, not normally one of the
game's hotheads, appeared to snap when Hugh Dallas denied his club two
penalty claims. He now awaits the wrath of the SFA to descend upon him.
The most popular booking offence is for dissent, for disputing a
referee's decision. Yet this is the craziest self-inflicted wound of
all, because the original award is almost never reversed.
So what is the truth?
Are referees in both our major sports failing to keep pace with the
times and, if so, what can be done to improve the situation?
I honestly do not believe the modern referee is inferior. His fitness
is checked more often than ever before, his work is constantly under
supervision, not just by his peers, but by the television cameras.
Having said that, it is a great pity in both football and rugby that
there are not more referees with experience of playing at the highest
level. If a top player does take up the whistle, there is certainly a
case for accelerated promotion.
I also think the football cut-off at aged 50 is far too rigid. We all
know men well into their sixth decade who could show the back of their
bootsoles to a lot of young officials. There is not so much talent about
that we can afford to dispense with any. Managers have no retirement
age, club chairmen wouldn't hear of such a scheme being applied to them.
On Saturday night, I was able to ask Derek Bevan a question about an
arguable incident earlier in the afternoon. He was happy to reply ''on
the record,'' and I have never met a rugby referee who refused to do so.
The SFA should think again about the gag they place on their refs.
Post match explanations might not defuse tension on the park, but they
certainly would do so off it.
But I also believe everyone associated with sport -- players,
supporters, managers, officials and, yes, even journalists, have some
responsibility in coming to the assistance of referees. Because, without
them, there can be no games. We might start by accepting that there will
be differences of opinion, that the referee will make mistakes, and that
these will have to be accepted. For what is the alternative?
Is it really proposed that a cup final or rugby international be
temporarily suspended until we can all check if the filmed rerun tells
us what actually happened? I must have seen it hundreds of times, but I
am still not sure whether Geoff Hurst's shot crossed the line in the
Wembley World Cup final.
What I can tell you is that Scotland were robbed in last season's
Calcutta Cup match because the referee thought Rob Andrew's hand
belonged to a home player. What are we going to do about it?
There is a prop I know who is convinced he scored a try at Twickenham;
he didn't because the ref did not award it. That's life.
Of course if a referee makes too many mistakes, he should be shown the
red card. I also believe television evidence should be available to
settle claims of mistaken identity.
Yet clubs of both codes have a duty to try to educate their supporters
in some basic points of sporting law. They could print a few simple
rules in a match programme.
The most important of them all would be to stress that the referee is
the sole judge of fact.

THE Rugby World Cup organisers have sent tender documents for the 1999
tournament to the Argentinian, Australian, English, French, and Welsh
Unions, each of which has expressed an interest in hosting the
tournament.
Detailed tenders for the 1999 competition have to be back with the RWC
board by the middle of this month, and a decision on the venue that year
will be made on March 13.
Following a meeting of RWC directors in the Isle of Man last week,
Marcel Martin, chairman of RWC (Licensing) BV, said yesterday that
accounts for 1994, which were in the process of being audited, indicated
that this year's competition in South Africa was on target for the
projected #30m income.
''As I said in 1993, just before the first RWC Sevens at Murrayfield,
the surplus in 1991 was bigger than the turnover of the 1987 World Cup.
In 1995 we aim to repeat the feat, in other words, to have a surplus of
about #20m which was the turnover of the 1991 RWC,'' he added.
ITV's Rugby World Cup cameras will bring some refreshing coverage this
summer after the independent channel signed a #2m sponsorship deal with
Heineken.
Broadcasts from South Africa begin on Sunday, May 21, and end with the
final on Saturday, June 24 -- and Heineken are guaranteed around 60
minutes of credits during some 60 hours of ITV coverage.
It is the first ITV deal where the broadcast sponsor is also a sponsor
of the event, with Heineken the official World Cup beer sponsor.
* BATH lock Andy Reed should be fit to challenge for a place in
Scotland's World Cup squad after having a successful operation on his
back last weekend.
Reed, who has struggled against back problems all season and last
played in a cup tie on December 17, could return to action next month.
Philip Bliss, the club surgeon, said: ''I operated on Andy on Sunday
for a prolapsed disc and his condition is very satisfactory. He will be
discharged at the end of the week and should be back training in two
weeks' time.
''There is no reason why the operation should interfere with his World
Cup preparations.''

Stenhousemuir 4, St Johnstone 0
STENHOUSEMUIR routed their first-division opponents at Ochilview last
night to win a money-spinning fourth-round tie at home to Aberdeen.
The Warriors opened the scoring in the fourth minute when Adrian
Sprott swept the ball home from 10 yards.
'Muir scored again after 35 minutes with a strike that would be a
candidate for goal of the season.
Sprott played the ball out to Hutchison, who, in turn, fed Christie,
who played the ball to Jimmy Fisher and the midfielder's driven cross
from the bye-line was spectacularly volleyed home by John Clarke, who
had replaced the injured Tommy Steel 10 minutes earlier.
Stenhousemuir began the second half where they left off and went three
up from a penalty eight minutes after the restart.
Davie Irons brought down Mathieson in the box and Sprott slotted home
his second and the Warriors third goal.
Euan Donaldson added a fourth after 76 minutes.

Berwick Rangers 3,
Meadowbank 3
(after extra time. 90min. 2-2)
Meadowbank won 7-6 on
penalty kicks
* THIS marathon tie was eventually settled by penalties at Shielfield
Park last night.
The match was locked at 3-3 after extra time, Tommy Graham having
fired Meadowbank into the lead after 16 minutes. Then Willie Irvine
equaised midway through the second half.
However, two goals in quick succession, from Berwick's Martin Neil and
one from the visitor's Lee Bailey put the tie into extra time, and after
107 minutes Warren Hawke struck his side's third. And Meadowbank's
Stuart Wilson made sure that a shoot-out would be required when he
netted a spot kick after 120 minutes.
Meadowbank's cause was not helped with the sending off of Stewart
Williamson just after the hour mark for deliberate hand ball.

Hearts 2, Clydebank 1
IT was not impressive, but Hearts did enough to remove Clydebank from
the path which now leads them to a jackpot meeting with Rangers on their
own ground in the next round of the Tennents Scottish Cup.
Considering that jackpot, the Edinburgh team could have made a more
professional job of winning this replay, but they at least were never in
danger of losing.
John Robertson was in his dangerous, impish mood. His future with the
club may be uncertain, but the striker continues to lead the way for
Hearts in putting the ball in the net. And he was again in at the sharp
end after only nine minutes.
The move that brought the goal was started by John Colquhoun, who
passed the ball to Kevin Thomas, and when his cross came over, Robertson
met it at pace to send it out of Gary Matthews' reach.
Hearts continued to press near half-time when Robertson stole the ball
from Matthews, but when he managed to turn on the bye-line and send in a
cross, the defence cleared the danger.
The home fans were unhappy when Colquhoun missed a chance to end the
match as a contest early in the second half. A run down the left by
David Hagen was followed by a cross, which Matthews caught but dropped,
and Colquhoun somehow managed to hit a post.
Robertson was unlucky soon after when he started and almost finished a
fine move. His pass to Thomas on the right was well judged, and when the
return ball came in, he hit it firmly enough but was defied by the
Bankies keeper.
But Hearts finally extended their lead in 65 minutes, and again
Robertson was a key player. Hagen did well on the left, sent the ball
into Robertson, who held it up cleverly until Thomas ran into space, and
when the ball was delivered, the young forward squeezed it in from an
acute angle.
Bankies enjoyed some consolation when Ken Eadie scored in the last
minute.
But it was not all joy for Robertson, because he was booked and will
now suffer a one-match suspension.
HEARTS -- Nelson, Frail, Berry, Levein, Bett, McPherson, Colquhoun,
Hamilton, Thomas, Robertson, Hagen. Substitutes -- Mackay, Miller,
Smith.
CLYDEBANK -- Matthews, McStay, Crawford, Murdoch, Sweeney, Currie,
Cooper, Lansdowne, Eadie, Flannigan, Jack. Substitutes -- Grady, Bowman,

OUTPUT bounced back in December after an unexpected fall in November,
leaving City pundits unsure whether activity would accelerate again
after an apparent slowdown in the final quarter of last year.
The stock market took heart from the figures and from a sharp fall in
commodity prices on Monday as speculators took profits. Slower growth
could postpone the next rise in interest rates, expected at any time
from April onwards, and more stable commodity prices could take the heat
off factory gate prices.
At one time the FTSE-100 share index was nearly 25 points higher, but
share prices fell back in the afternoon when Wall Street moved into
negative territory. The index closed only 10.7 points higher at 3072.7.
Industrial production rose by 0.8% in December after a revised drop of
1.4% (1%) in November. Output was 5.3% higher than in the same month of
the previous year against a year-on-year increase of 4% in November.
In the final quarter of last year industrial production was just 0.5%
higher than in the third quarter, but a major element in this slowdown
was a 3% quarter-on-quarter decline in electricity, gas and water
output. This was mainly due to lower demand for power because of the
exceptionally mild weather in November.
Taking 1994 as a whole, industrial production was 5.2% higher than in
1993, stronger than the heady rate recorded in 1988 before boom turned
to bust. A 27.5% increase in oil and gas output to record levels was a
major boost.
Manufacturing output rose by 0.5% in December after a revised fall of
0.6% (0.7%) in November. The year-on-year growth rate perked up from
4.8% in November to 5.3%.
In the final quarter manufacturing grew by 0.7% and was 5.2% higher
than in the fourth quarter of 1993. The 1994 growth rate was 4.1%, the
best for six years.
The modest fourth quarter growth in both industrial production and its
manufacturing component contrasted with quarterly increases in excess of
1% earlier in the year.
This led some independent economists to hail the data as a sign the
economy was slowing down. There was speculation that the Central
Statistical Office would tone down its initial 0.8% estimate of
fourth-quarter growth in gross domestic product when it published
output, income and expenditure figures on February 22.
Another school of thought found yesterday's output figures difficult
to square with the bullish tone of last month's CBI quarterly trends
survey, which suggested activity had strengthened in the latest four
months and that expectations of future growth were firm. The implication
was that the output figures could be revised upwards.
The Treasury said the figures confirmed strong manufacturing growth
last year with a slowdown to a more sustainable rate by the fourth
quarter.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, said the figures
vindicated last week's increase in interest rates, the third half-point
rise since September.
''The data shows growth being sustained very strongly in the fourth
quarter of last year. Manufacturing remains very buoyant in this
economy,'' he added.
James Capel's Adam Cole thought talk of a slowdown was premature. The
November data had been a blip, he said, but the underlying trend was
strong. In the manufacturing figures, engineering had dropped
erratically in November and then bounced back in December.
He expects activity to pick up in the current quarter as the growth in
manufacturing is sustained across the board and the weather-related
effects on industrial production disappear.
Mr Cole was also sceptical about the apparent signs of a slowdown in
the US, which he thought were largely seasonal. An unexpected rise in US
employment on Friday, reversing the trend of a steady decline, prompted
speculators, mainly on the other side of the Atlantic, to pull their
money out of world commodity markets.
The price of everything from copper to cocoa was driven sharply lower
as investors switched their attention to equity and bond markets.
Speculators have been blamed for adding froth to buoyant commodity
prices over the last 15 months.
The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report will be published at
the unusually early hour of 10.30 this morning, giving City economists
all day to digest its contents instead of the usual practice of taking
it home on the evening train.
Interest rates have risen by a full 1% since the last report in
November, and analysts are keen to probe the Bank's current thinking on
inflation and monetary policy.
With the effects of the mini-Budget coming through in January, next
week's inflation figures will suffer. Capel economists are forecasting
headline inflation of 3.5% against 2.9% in December and an underlying
rate of 3% against 2.5% in December.
The figures will be scrutinised for signs that retailers no longer
feel the need to engage in heavy discounting to sustain sales volumes
and may hold the key to how soon rates will be raised again.

PHARMACEUTICAL companies are facing a challenging time as many of
their blockbuster drugs come off patent, new market forces emerge,
particularly in the US, and government pressures on spending grow across
Europe. To improve their position in this dynamic environment, they have
developed a variety of strategies.
After carefully evaluating the options over the course of the past 18
months, Glaxo has chosen to follow the horizontal growth route, relying
on expanding its research and development and broadening its drug
portfolio. This is the rationale behind its hostile #9000m bid for
Wellcome.
Speaking at the group's interim results meeting yesterday, Sir Richard
Sykes, Glaxo's deputy chairman and chief executive, said there was no
question that the pharmaceutical industry was consolidating. ''We want
to be leading the process,'' he said, rather than being carried along or
left behind.
He believes the Glaxo/Wellcome merger will enable the enlarged company
to better compete in the world market. ''It will give us global power,''
he said, as Glaxo posted its final offer document for Wellcome. The
final offer values each Wellcome share at 1044p, representing a premium
of about 52% to the middle market quotation of 688p prior to the bid
announcement.
Sir Richard said he was disappointed the Wellcome board would not
agree to a merger. However, he added that he understood John Robb,
Wellcome's chairman and chief executive, and his board had a
responsibility to shareholders to get the best price.
Glaxo has traditionally had a very strong balance sheet. In the six
months to end-December it had net liquid funds of just over #2300m.
Following a Wellcome merger, its balance sheet would show a marked
deterioration with gearing at 400%. However, the company said borrowings
would be reduced steadily through cash generation in the business and as
the benefits of rationalisation fed through. Interest cover is expected
to settle down at around seven times earnings.
The total cost of the bid is expected to be little short of #80m, made
up of #30m of professional fees for merchant bank advisors, public
relations consultants and the like, and #47m of stamp duty should the
deal go ahead.
Sir Richard's remarks came as Glaxo reported interim results in line
with City expectations. Pre-tax profits rose by 10% to #1097m. Sales
growth was just 2% at #2852m. At constant exchange rates, growth was 3%,
comprising volume up 4% and net prices down 1%. This reflected bigger
discounts given to large healthcare buyers in the US.
Internal cost control enabled trading margins to improve by 2.5% to
35.5%. Growth in earnings per share was held back to 4% because of a
higher tax charge, but the interim dividend was raised by 11% to 10.0p.
Newer drugs are increasingly taking up the slack of slower growing
mature drugs such as ulcer treatment Zantac. Recently published industry
data shows that, in terms of products, digestive tract drugs continue to
grow strongly. The bad news for Zantac is that much of the growth is
coming from Losec, a relatively new drug produced by Astra of Sweden.
This group of drugs was out-paced only by those for the nervous
system, including the increasingly popular anti-depressants such as
Prozac.
In the first half, Zantac sales fell by 4% to #1137m but still
accounted for 34% of the world market. Long-term US contracts at
discount prices coupled with pricing pressures in France and Italy were
to blame for the decline in sales value. Growth was strong in the rest
of the world, particularly in emerging markets in Latin America.
In the respiratory market sales rose by 14%, driven mainly by new
products such as the asthma treatment Serevent. Its sales more than
doubled to #103m.
Elsewhere, sales of Zofran, used to treat nausea associated with
chemotherapy, dropped by 2% following increased competition from cheaper
generic drugs and a trend towards lower dosing to save hospital costs.
Glaxo's spending on research and development was held steady at #410m
but is expected to reach #900m by the year-end. Sir Richard said
stricter evaluation of compounds in the research pipeline was already
taking place. Any products which looked as though they would not add
value to the market were being scrapped.
Commenting on Glaxo's results, Wellcome's John Robb said they showed
little improvement in sales or earnings per share ''and highlight its
desire to acquire a company with a record of strong growth''.
Glaxo's EGM is on March 6 with the final offer closing on March 8.
With the clock ticking on the bid, Wellcome shares dropped 7p to 1011p
while Glaxo's were 12p cheaper at 649p.

THORN EMI had good news for shareholders yesterday with higher profits
and earnings, but not such good news for staff of Rumbelows, the
electrical retail chain, which is to be closed with the loss of 2900
jobs.
With the third quarter 25% ahead, operating profits on continuing
activities before exceptionals were a like proportion up at #358m for
the nine months to December. Earnings per share were 19% ahead. The
pre-tax figure advanced 39% to #344m.
Rumbelows, which has no outlets in Scotland, has been losing money for
years and is thought to be badly positioned in the market. It is about
half the size of rivals such as Comet or Dixons, and has poorly sited
outlets. The group spent some #15m trying to reformat the shops, with a
trial of 36 under the FONA label. It then looked for a buyer without
success.
The 285 shops are to be closed by the end of April at a gross cost of
#116m. This will be reflected in the final quarter as an exceptional
item.
Thorn EMI chairman Sir Colin Southgate said the cash impact would not
be significant in the context of the group's financial strength. The
move is expected to benefit profits by #15m in 1995-96 and by more in
subsequent years as managers concentrate on the main retail operation,
Radio Rentals.
This is going strong with profits of all the UK retail activities up a
quarter despite Rumbelows, driven by efficiency gains and an expanded
product range. The decline of the rental base has been arrested, with a
2% rise in 1994.
Continental European activities are developing well with a 29% gain in
operating profits on a 4.5% increase in the rental base. America saw
good volume gains, but margins were affected by spending on marketing
and training. Overall, the division raised its contribution by 12% to
#100.5m.
The largest activity, EMI Music, raised underlying operating profits
by 14% to #241m. The third quarter saw strong international demand for
the Beatles' album Live at the BBC, Garth Brooks' The hits in the US and
for two artists in Japan.
Other artists selling well include Frank Sinatra, Megadeth and
Queensryche, and under the Virgin label, the Rolling Stones, Smashing
Pumpkins and compilation albums such as The Best of Rock. Music
publishing reported record profits.
The industrial activities of defence, sensors and microwave devices,
which the group is aiming to sell eventually, cut their losses from
#21.6m to #9.4m as a result of restructuring.
Sir Colin said the full-year growth in profits would be in line with
that achieved in the fourth quarter, pointing to operating profits of
#452m. Strong before the results, Thorn EMI shares slipped 10p to 1039p,
where they are a firm hold, selling at 16 times likely earnings.

EVEN in the most serious court case there is room for the odd laugh.
During the trial of poisoner Dr Paul Agutter, the jury heard a
fascinating taped interview between the accused and detectives at
Haddington police station.
There were regular sounds of what appeared to be hammering, banging,
and sawing in the background, at times almost drowning out the
conversation.
Advocate-depute Mr Andrew Lamb persevered with his questioning of DCI
Brian Doneghan then, as he was about to sit down, said: ''One last
question Detective Chief Inspector. Just what were you building during
the course of the interview?'' An example of gallows humour perhaps?
Agutter, who left poisoned tonic at a Safeway supermarket, admitted
that he had put two bottles on the shelves. He explained this away by
saying he had found them lying on the floor and was just putting them
back where they belonged. Mr Lamb asked the jury whether that
explanation appealed to their common sense, adding: ''You may think that
explanation doesn't hold water, tonic or otherwise.''
Mr Lamb is also an early runner for the High Court question of the
year award: ''Tell me Mrs Agutter, when do you last recollect having
made marmalade?'' One of Mrs Agutter's screwtop marmalade jars had been
used to take away the remains of her gin and tonic which her husband had
spiked with the deadly poison, atropine. ''I wondered what had happened
to it,'' said Mrs Agutter. ''I take it you are now one jar short,''
sympathised the advocate-depute.
Mrs Agutter herself contributed to the humour, albeit outwith the
hearing of the jury. As she left the witness box having been questioned
for some time about details of her ''open'' marriage, Dr Agutter was
being led from the dock as the court broke for lunch.
''Nosey buggers aren't they?'' Mrs A remarked to her husband.
As a Radio Three listener, Agutter himself was literally on a
different wavelength from the rest of us. At one point during the police
interview he denied owning a purple V-necked jumper and added: ''I used
to have a purple sweatshirt but it died.''
Sante
FUNNY how international law suits over scientific matters can also
impact on everyday supermarket shopping. A new Californian brandy,
mysteriously called E and J, has appeared on the shelves with labels in
both French and English, an unusually generous concession to Gallic
tipplers.
Since 1984, however, a rancorous legal battle has been raging between
the US and France over who first discovered the Aids virus, threatening
diplomatic relations and the future of international scientific
co-operation. On the one side is Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur
Institute, who gets the Diary's vote, and on the other is Robert Gallo
of the US National Cancer Institute. Which is maybe why you have to look
to the small print to find E and J's surname on the brandy . . . um, er
. . . Gallo.
Pay as you learn
TO describe the law as ''an ass'' sometimes seems like a wildly
generous compliment.
Take the case of an English doctor who, no doubt after taking legal
advice, sued his GP partner for slander after she accused him of sexual
harassment at their Northampton surgery.
Dr Malcolm Smith was awarded #320,000 in damages and costs, but never
recieved a penny after the GP he sued declared herself bankrupt in the
wake of the court action.
Now Dr Smith himself is being sued by his solicitor for fees of
#181,000, the balance of a total legal bill of #270,000. He has already
forked out #90,000 after remortgaging his own and his father's house,
using all his savings and taking out loans.
Justice, Who needs it?
Bastions of the law (No 70)
DR Smith might have reason to feel miffed, given the sums doled out in
legal aid by the taxpayer to Robert Maxwell's sons (#4m) and others
living in #500,000 houses with children at private schools.
Similar cases have not yet materialised in Scotland, but there is
nothing to stop them in the future, according to Alan Douglas, chief
executive of the   Scottish Legal Aid Board.
He retires at the end of this month, after keeping charge of the
board's purse strings since its inception in 1987. In that time, annual
spending, which is geared to demand for legal aid, has nearly tripled to
more than #124m.
It has not been the easiest of jobs, trying at the same time to ensure
both access to the law for the needy and keeping enough food on the
tables in lawyers' houses.
Hitherto the system was administered by courts which led to
inconsistencies, particularly during the 1983/84 miners' strike. Some
sheriffs were sympathetic to applications by strikers on breach of the
peace charges, others would have willingly flung them down the nearest
pit along with Arthur Scargill and the rest of the NUM leadership.
The legal profession's initial hostility to this chartered accountant
upstart has since been replaced by a reasonable measure of mutual
understanding and respect.
''I think the board has achieved a lot and I have been proud to be
associated with that,'' Mr Douglas told the Diary.
''But there will always be individual circumstances where a solicitor
will believe we have not got it right.''
He believes the board offers a fair and efficient service within the
rules which govern its procedures, but there is always scope for
improvements and achieving better value for money. He also acknowledges
that spiralling costs may be just as much the result of delays and
defects in court administration rather than the fault of the profession.
But the big test will come if policy shifts towards putting spending
caps on a service which has always been demand-led and thus without
overall restriction. Moves on this front in England are expected in the
Lord Chancellor's forthcoming green paper. If Scotland follows suit, it
will land on the desk of his successor Dr Richard Scott, who joins the
board from the Scottish Office where his responsibilities have included
advising Ministers on legal aid.
For Mr Douglas, however, retirement offers a more relaxing literary
pleasure he shares with the Prime Minister -- reading the novels of
Anthony Trollope.

High-profile lawyer Alan Dershowitz has joined others in his
profession in writing a celebrity novel.
THERE is a new breed: the celebrity lawyer. The most famous of these
is surely Alan M Dershowitz. Not only did he represent Mia Farrow in her
much-publicised action against Woody Allen but is one of O J Simpson's
so-called ''dream team'' of defence lawyers.
Dershowitz first came to celebrity prominence with his book on which
the Academy Award-winning 1990 film Reversal of Fortune was based. The
book and movie was a courtroom drama centring on the case of Claus von
Bulow who was accused of attempting to murder his wife. Dershowitz
managed to win an appeal against the original conviction. During the von
Bulow trial Dershowitz names his legal squad after his favourite
television programme, Mission Impossible.
Alan Dershowitz's choice of high-profile clients helped him make a
name for himself. He represented the heavyweight boxing champion Mike
Tyson in his rape case. Tyson went on trial for allegedly raping an
18-year-old contestant in the 1991 Miss Black America contest.
In 1992 Dershowitz acted for the disgraced broker and hotelier Mrs
Leona Helmsley, the woman who once infamously said: ''Only the little
people pay taxes.'' Helmsley was known as ''the Queen of Mean'' by
employees and colleagues for her greed and arrogance.
She became so unpopular as the details of her penny-pinching
management techniques were exposed in court during the trial that her
lawyers based an eleventh-hour appeal for mercy on her likely prison
victimisation as a notorious, widely reviled, New York Jewish
millionairess. In the end she served 18 months and had to pay fines
totalling $8m.
Forbes magazine recently put the Helmsley fortune at around $1300m.
Dershowitz, regularly described as ''the flamboyant Harvard law
professor'', also advised Marlon Brando when Brando's son Christian was
accused of murdering his half-sister's boyfriend in May 1990.
At the age of 28 Dershowitz was Harvard Law School's youngest tenured
professor. According to Peter Collier, writing in the magazine Vanity
Fair: ''Dershowitz had been expected to write a classic legal textbook
-- on the intersection of psychiatry and the law but his son Elon
developed a rare brain tumour, and to make extra money Dershowitz began
taking the criminal-defence cases which would soon make him into a sort
of court of last resort for such people as convict-essayist Jack Abbott
and CIA whistleblower Frank Snepp.''
Now Dershowitz has written a book, but it's anything but academic.
Clearly, Dershowitz would have many a rip-roaring, gossipy,
star-studded tale to tell. However, instead of spilling the beans he has
written what has come to be known in the publishing world as ''the
celebrity novel''. The Advocate's Devil (Headline, #16.99) published
last week tells the story of Joe Campbell, a basketball star who is
accused of rape and the growing doubts experienced by his brilliant
defence lawyer as the case develops. The story has clear links to the
Tyson case.
Not content with his novel, Dershowitz published non-fiction. His most
recent book is called The Abuse Excuse -- and Other Cop-Outs, Sob
Stories and Evasion of Responsibility. The book includes recent causes
celebres including those of Tonya Harding, the Menendez brothers, Lorena
Bobbitt, and O J Simpson.
According to Tim Carroll in his book Woody and his Women: ''One of the
most important precepts of Dershowitz's 'campaign strategy' when faced
with a public battle is to present the best possible image for his
client, particularly when that image has been tarnished.'' Indeed,
Dershowitz has gone on record as saying: ''In America, you cannot win
your cases unless you win them first in the court of public opinion.''
It is obvious that writing a novel circumvents the problems of awkward
disclosures and potential libels in true-life cases. Now the
best-selling lawyer novel, thanks to the likes of John Grisham, is
edging the detective story off the crime novel shelves of bookshops.
What is the fascination for the legal thriller? ''There are several
reasons, I think,'' wrote John Grisham in the New York Times Review of
Books back in 1992 during the first wave of legal thrillers. ''First,
every lawyer has a good story. We lawyers get involved with people who
have messed up their lives, and their mistakes make fascinating stories.
Second, most lawyers would rather be doing something else. Most of the
work is terribly boring and there is tremendous dissatisfaction within
the profession.''
Novels by lawyers, of course, are nothing new. Names like Louis
Auchincloss, George V Higgins, and Scott Turow have recently helped
popularise the genre. But even before that in the 1930s Erle Stanley
Gardner wrote more than 80 Perry Mason novels. In the fifties Robert
Traver wrote Anatomy of a Murder and Agatha Christie penned one of the
all-time classic legal thrillers Witness for the Prosecution.
It was Turow's Presumed Innocent which began the current wave. The
movie rights were later sold and made Turow rich and famous in one fell
swoop. After the publication and success of Grisham's first novel, The
Firm, in 1991, ''an epidemic of sabbaticals hit American law firms
across the land as budding writers left their offices to finish their
books,'' says Grisham.
Maxim Jakubowski, writer and proprietor of Murder One, the London
crime bookshop, feels that the legal thriller will not take over from
the detective novel. ''There are about a dozen areas within the crime
story field, they all come and go. A couple of years ago it was feminist
private eyes, then there was a series of serial killer novels after The
Silence of the Lambs.''
If the legal thriller is just a phase, what is the next big thing in
terms of crime novels? Says Mr Jakubowski from his Charing Cross Road
bookshop: ''If I knew that I wouldn't be here, I'd be at home writing
it!''

Too many lawyers take on specialist cases when they do not have the
expertise to deal with them. And they should know better, says Mike
Dailly
A SWAB left deep inside; a misdiagnosis of cancer; an excessive dose
of antibiotic. Any one of these mistakes might be medical negligence --
but can the victim prove it? If their case falls into the wrong hands,
probably not.
Most High Street solicitors who encounter complex medical negligence
claims refer clients on to specialists, who can deal with cases
expertly. However, a small number of non-specialist firms prefer to
dabble in claims themselves.
The organisation, Action on Victims of Medical Accidents (AVMA) has
provided specialist medico-legal training to solicitors in England for
more than ten years. Yet they still come up with badly managed cases.
Keith Miles, Assistant Director of AVMA says: ''Cases are still taken
on by the High Street lawyer with little knowledge or experience of
medical negligence who can take a long time getting nowhere. It's a
problem within the legal profession because it's a very specialised
field which is different to the normal personal injuries work that most
lawyers do.''
Of course, problems are not confined to England. Speaking on BBC Radio
Scotland's Lawful Business, an unnamed Fife woman revealed her bitter
experience of pursuing a claim for medical negligence. When she was
pregnant doctors gave her a radioactive isotope which, she claims,
caused her daughter to be born with physical abnormalities.
A local firm of solicitors said she had a good claim for damages, but
the case never progressed: ''At the beginning of the year I got in touch
again to find out what was happening and that's when I discovered nobody
seemed to know what was happening. They said that the senior partner had
gone off sick and then I was told that he'd retired -- I didn't know
what they were doing. I assumed they were the experts.''
Although her case appeared to be static the legal bills kept coming in
-- despite the fact that her daughter had been entitled to legal aid all
along. Seven years later the case is now being dealt with by
specialists. The Fife mother only wishes her local firm had said at the
outset they could not help.
So what mistakes can be made? According to David Sandison of Lawford
Kidd, a solicitor needs to know what questions to ask and who to ask.
''The problem is that inexperienced solicitors can get the run-around
from Scottish Health Service solicitors, who are very skilled, know what
to do and know the right doctors to choose. If you pick the wrong doctor
he can give you an entirely wrong view of your case, while another
doctor can come to a completely different conclusion.''
When medical negligence cases do go wrong it is the specialist
solicitor who must pick up the pieces, Fred Tyler of Edinburgh lawyers,
Balfour &amp; Manson, Nightingale &amp; Bell is one such specialist: ''I have
taken over quite a large number of medical negligence cases in the past,
often having to start again from scratch. You do get a non-specialist
solicitor instructing the wrong expert and asking the wrong questions.
The non-specialist tends not to query the medical reports.
''I think the problem has been addressed to some extent by The Law
Society introducing specialist accreditation for medical negligence,
although it is not a requirement that you have to be accredited before
you do a case.''
So who pays for a specialist to re-do a case? If the person is legally
assisted it will be the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB). However, a
local spokesperson for SLAB says this is not a significant problem:
''There will be local solicitors who will have a difficulty with medical
negligence, but this area is not as difficult as some areas of law. Most
of the bigger medical negligence cases go to the Court of Session, so
Edinburgh agents will be involved and they may have a breadth of
knowledge that a local practitioner might not have.''
Then again, if specialists are redoing the work that other firms have
been paid for the client or SLAB must be paying twice. As there is no
record of the number of legal aid certificates transferred from firm to
firm, how could the problem show up? Duplication of work may not be a
significant problem simply because medical negligence represents a tiny
fraction of the overall civil legal aid budget.
Clearly non-specialists have to be dissuaded from taking in cases.
Although as Aberdeen solicitor David Burnside suggests, this may be
difficult as temptation is not restricted to medical negligence: ''It is
also true, for example, that employment law is seen as fairly accessible
and many solicitors think 'I'll have a shot at that'. But solicitors
need to decide what areas of the law they will offer a service in. If
they can't do something, they can refer it on.''
There is a perception that medical negligence is something that the
High Street practitioner can do, like a personal injuries action. But
these cases require considerable thought and investigation. Unlike an
accident at work which will generally result in some sort of settlement,
medical negligence claims will always be faced with repudiation of
liability.
In recognition of these difficulties, AVMA have recently branched out
into Scotland with the creation of a Scottish support group for
solicitors. As Assistant Director Keith Miles explains: ''In Scotland
we're trying to do what we've been doing in England for the last 10
years -- that is train lawyers to treat and investigate medical
negligent cases in a different way.
''There are complicated medical issues that solicitors need to get to
grips with. For example, some solicitors send off medical reports to an
expert without understanding them. It's now established in England that
this should not be done. It is not sufficient to simply rely on the
medical expert's report.
''I think there is less coverage of awareness of medical accidents in
Scotland in comparison to England. It seems to be somewhat hidden in
Scotland. I doubt the difference can be explained by the fact that our
hospitals are worse than yours. It's more likely that people who are
dissatisfied are just unaware of the options available to them.''
* If any claimants are dissatisfied or require help in finding a
solicitor the Law Society of Scotland can supply an accredited list of
specialist solicitors.

TODAY'S news that the Highlands and Islands Enterprise network has
attracted almost 35% of the Objective One money in the first nine months
of the programme's operation has confirmed some in their belief that the
distribution of #250m of European aid by the end of this century will
have to be very closely watched. The pork barrel has already been
mentioned.
It has certainly served to refocus attention on the programme on which
so many Highland hopes have been pinned, many unreasonably. It is now
some 20 months since the European Commission was finally persuaded that
the Highlands and Islands, along with Northern Ireland and Merseyside,
were among the poorest areas of Europe and deserving of priority aid
under Objective One.
Here was a chance really to achieve something lasting. The Highland
and Islands councils, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish
Office had worked surprisingly well together, not least when it looked
as though Argyll and West Moray might be excluded. And the way the
European Commission was thinking, there was the prospect of real money
coming: the #250m from Europe was to be matched by #250m from the public
sector here; with a target of getting the same from private sector
sources.
If it all worked it could mean #750m for the Highlands and Islands
over six years. Surely some lasting improvement could be won from that.
Six months later the first serious mistake has been made, siting the
Objective One management team in HIE's Inverness headquarters. Temporary
at first, it saved any money being spent on setting up an office, but
this was a mistake on two counts.
First, it was inevitable that when the cake was being divided up,
others in the partnership would come to suspect the close visible
proximity of Objective One to HIE, which already enjoyed a changeable
relationship with the councils.
Such suspicion was bound to undermine the close working relationship
which had marked the campaign to win Objective One. It was an omen to
those who believed that since it had been the economic plight of
communities on the west coast, in the islands, and Easter Ross which had
won Ojective One status, it was they who should immediately benefit.
That should start with the location of the Objective One project team.
Its workers should experience the very problems which had led to their
jobs being created. After all, HIE had spent several years lecturing
companies about how advanced telecommunications in the Highlands now
meant they could relocate with little difficulty.
It was all slightly reminiscent of those Scottish Office civil
servants who argued in the 1960s that the Highlands and Islands
Development Board could be located in Edinburgh.
The issue of the peripheral areas reappeared last October when Western
Isles MP Calum MacDonald reacted with anger to the news that #320,000
had been awarded to Highlands &amp; Islands Airports Ltd to upgrade
Inverness Airport's control tower. In December he returned to the attack
after a draft report recommended the preferred minimum of 50% of
Objective One being targeted to the areas of greatest need.
He wrote to Mr Dennis Malone, Objective One programme director: ''The
whole purpose of Objective One is to target areas of particular
disadvantage within the EU. That must be the guiding principle for the
programme partnership. It cannot possible stick true to that principle
if it only allocates 50% of funding according to criteria of
disadvantage and allocates the remainder according to what it vaguely
terms 'competition', but which everybody else will recognise as the pork
barrel.''
Mr MacDonald told the press that the partnership was trying to hide
''a sell-out of the poorest and worst-off parts of the Highlands and
Islands''.
Not surprisingly Mr Malone did not and does not agree. When he spoke
to The Herald he said he had no trouble with the Inverness Airport
award: ''The justification for that lies in Inverness Airport being the
gateway to the Highlands and Islands. It is part of a programme of
improvement works to airports across the whole area, it was a project of
regional significance and not something we could avoid.''
He also robustly defended the system of targeting. ''I think it is
worth noting that the EU appeared quite impressed by our systems. They
haven't seen anything like it because there isn't geographical targeting
anywhere else.
''We have taken 50% as the floor mechanism for targeting, it is a
financial management tool to ensure that 16 areas are guaranteed some
minimum level of support from the programme. You will reach the floor if
you submit good quality projects.''
The remaining 50% is open to ''competitive bidding'', but Mr Malone
stressed that the figures were not set in tablets of stone. ''If there
was a really good project idea in the Western Isles, for example, there
would be no problem, they could go over the floor.''
Even in the competitive bidding there would still be geographical
considerations: ''If there were two projects of equally high quality but
one was in Inverness and one in Harris, Harris would get approval
because of the impact it would have. We must get value for money.''
It won't be easy. The real need is for lasting employment, and few of
the training programmes or infrastructure projects can ensure that. The
#6.44m Scalpay Bridge would never have happened without Objective One.
It is much needed, but in the long term it will mean job losses on the
ferry and at the school. It will cost the Western Isles Council #1.5m a
year from its roads and transport budget, money that will not be
available to spend on other island roads for a couple of years.
There is a feeling, rightly or wrongly, in some areas that things have
begun to go wrong. What is needed now is for everyone to sit down again
and work out where exactly the programme should be going; how to get the
private sector involved meaningfully; and what happens in areas where
the private sector hardly exists. It will be too late to do it in 1999.

IT'S twenty-odd years since I first went to Belfast, and I've always
found it a fine city, full of friendly people. This week was the first
time I've been there without soldiers on the streets and barbed wire
round the police stations.
Their absences are symptoms of the peace process, but it's the whole
atmosphere of the place which is so different and impressive. The city
is alive. People are not looking over their shoulders or worrying every
time they hear the door-bell ring. And they love the change, as any of
us would.
That is the cardinal fact which some politicians and commentators
seemed to underestimate last week. I heard interviews in which assorted
Unionists were almost being begged to say that this was more than they
could take and that the peace process was now in tatters. Fortunately,
none of them went that far.
The idea that this precious peace, which had taken 25 years to
acquire, was going to dissolve in the face of a leaked document in the
Times simply does not accord with the human reality, which is that
hardly anyone wants to see this process fail.
Repeatedly, the point was made to me this week -- by industrialists
and trade unionists, nationalists and unionists -- that this is the one
chance. ''The one chance.'' In such a context, these words have a heavy
ring to them.
Most of us, mercifully, have never known what it is like to live in a
society where politically motivated murder and callous bombings are
endemic. Fifty minutes flight from Glasgow, people talk with grim
conviction about ''the one chance'' to escape from just such conditions,
and to build something better. The stakes are almost incomprehensibly
high.
In spite of all that there is no carte blanche on either side for the
plans which are being drawn up. The balancing act between nationalist
and unionist aspirations is still mighty difficult to achieve. But,
again, I suspect that people are forging ahead of politicians because
there is such a vested interest in not countenancing failure.
On the Unionist side, there is a general recognition that there are
going to be closer links with the rest of Ireland and that this will be
accompanied by an increasing number of cross-border organisations. So
far, so good. The stumbling block comes at the point of transferring
sovereignty or sharing power with the Republic.
I doubt if that concept can, or should, be sprung on them out of any
document on which there has not been open participation and consultation
from the start. The idea that such a document, at any stage of
preparation, could be kept secret when there are such partisan interests
at stake, was surely naive.
Of course, it's difficult to generalise, but it seems that all shades
of nationalist aspirations have also been tempered by realities, now
that there is actually a peaceful future to envisage. Nobody now
disputes that unification could only come through consent, or that
building all-Ireland bridges will be a painstaking process, based on
consent.
Within these broad outlines, there is room for a vast range of useful
developments which don't threaten anyone and which strengthen the
transition towards long-term peace. Crucially, everyone is talking to
everyone else. Fianna Fail is visiting Ulster Unionist headquarters. The
former paramilitaries are emerging as creative political thinkers.
If democratic institutions can be established around an assembly and
along lines that are broadly acceptable to all, then it is these which
must determine the rate of progress thereafter. There would be a natural
evolution of relationships, at a pace which cannot be legislated for in
advance or from outside.
But the other recurrent message which I heard is that substantial,
tangible benefits of peace have to be felt quickly, if the devil is not
again to find work for idle hands. That means jobs and investment on a
very large scale. It means grass-root participation in planning the
future of ghetto communities, with the money to back it up.
As one leading businessman told me: ''Nobody should start thinking in
terms of saving money because there is peace in Northern Ireland. The
money which has been spent until now on security must, for the next few
years, be committed to economic development instead.''
Not all the news in Northern Ireland is good. There are still
incidents happening which, anywhere else, would be the stuff of
front-page headlines. A teenage joy-rider who is imprudent enough to
steal a Provo's car has his legs broken and rammed through a railing.
One the same day, a rural pub is raided by masked men and smashed up.
Businessmen say protection money is still being demanded.
There are two interpretations of such events. The gloomy one is that
the Provos are merely taking a break, regrouping and making such
political advances as they can. It would be naive to write off the
possibility, and vigilance is justified. But it would be desperately
over-pessimistic to work on the assumption that this is all a cynical
manoeuvre.
Undoubtedly, the more that happens soon to consolidate the process,
and to confirm its worth in the eyes of the communities from which the
paramilitaries draw their support, the less likelihood there is of
violence making a comeback. The economic and political initiatives need
to emerge quickly, openly, and convincingly.
It was a timely reminder that few of us will ever fully understand the
nuances of Northern Ireland politics, but I was mildly encouraged by a
huge Loyalist mural in praise of the hero of Celtic mythology, Cuchullin
''who protected Ulster from the Irish more than 2000 years ago''.
Maybe the quick route to consensus is for everyone to agree that
Cuchullin was a great guy! In the meantime, it was just great to share
briefly in Belfast's sense of liberation. Long may it continue.

Alf Young, Economics Editor, talks to man-of-many-parts Ian Preston
about his 'big package' -- three new jobs within a week.
IAN PRESTON calls it ''the big package''. On Friday it was announced
that he had become a non-executive director of one of Scotland's largest
privately owned industrial groups, Motherwell Bridge. On Monday, he was
revealed as chairman of one of the three new Scottish water authorities.
Yesterday he was confirmed as chairman of the newly-privatised Scottish
coal company.
Add in non-executive directorships at Clydeport and Morgan Grenfell
(Scotland) and the chairmanship of the Scottish Council Development and
Industry and it is clear that, when he leaves the chief executive's
office at ScottishPower for the last time at the end of this month,
Preston will not, as he himself puts it, be entering ''a mouldering
state of retirement''.
''It's meant to be an independent, objective businessman's portfolio
of appointments,'' he argues. ''A spread of interests in both the public
and private sectors.'' Then, acknowledging the raw political
sensitivities involved, he adds: ''I haven't got strong allegiances. I'm
just one of the hired hands.''
Short-term, it is Preston's water authority chairmanship which is
likely to draw the most flak. The #24,000 a year he'll get from spending
a day and a half a week on the affairs of the new East of Scotland Water
Authority has already helped trigger a new round of quango bashing. But
that kind of criticism will hardly perturb a veteran of the ongoing rows
over the levels of rewards enjoyed by senior executives in the
privatised utilities, like ScottishPower, where Preston's basic salary
runs at #255,000 a year.
The really intriguing thing about Dr Preston's big package is the way
in which a former nuclear physicist and a man who was instrumental in
developing, in the 1970s, the programme which gave Scotland one of the
heaviest concentrations of civil nuclear power anywhere in the world,
now emerges as the champion of Scottish coal and an outspoken critic of
the costs and inflexibility of nuclear power.
The issue which really calls for ventilation is not salary but the
implications and ethics of one man moving from the senior executive post
within by far the dominant buyer of coal in Scotland one day to the
chairmanship of the near-monopoly domestic supplier of that coal the
next.
Ian Preston readily acknowledges that the invitation, last year, to
follow Professor Ross Harper as chairman of Mining (Scotland), the
rainbow alliance of interests poised to buy control of the Scottish
coalfield from the Government, raised a substantive conflict of
interest. ''I went to the ScottishPower board and told them I'd been
approached. I told them I would like to do it and asked the board if it
considered the move appropriate.''
Until then the plan had been that, once Preston's successor at
ScottishPower, Ian Robinson from Trafalgar House, arrived this March,
Preston himself would become deputy chairman and run in tandem with
Robinson until he retired in July. Now the SP board decided Preston
could only say ''yes'' to the Mining (Scotland) offer if he was to leave
ScottishPower first.
After all, in November 1993, ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric
had concluded a #400m five-year base-supply deal with British Coal to
purchase 2,000,000 tonnes of Scottish coal a year for burning in the
Longannet and Cockenzie power stations. Only last December a
supplementary deal to purchase a further 710,000 tonnes of Scottish coal
was announced. These supply contracts have now been taken over by Mining
(Scotland).
''The conflict of interest wasn't a major one because the main coal
contract was in place long before I was approached,'' says Preston.
''The issue was really about marginal supplies. I think we've resolved
it in a way which is both positive for ScottishPower and positive for
me.''
That said, he is in no doubt about his main priority in this new role.
''The key element in my new job is winning contract capacity when the
present supply contract comes to an end. The number one target is to
convince ScottishPower to continue to buy Scottish coal after 1998.''
Mining (Scotland) could hardly have found a more inspired choice of
advocate in that highly competitive task. And, even before Preston's
appointment was made public, when he was still being referred to in code
by those in the know as Dr Volt, he was launching a public broadside at
one of coal's main rivals as a fuel source -- nuclear power.
On January 26, in London, at the Power Generation and Supply Forum he
hit out: ''Nuclear is an expensive source of generation. Its present
share of the market owes nothing to its price competitiveness and
everything to Government intervention . . . Nuclear could not survive on
its own two feet in the market-place if it had to follow the same
financial criteria as the privatised companies.
''Nuclear power is also inflexible, demanding baseload running at the
expense of other cheaper plant. This leads to additional costs to the
system as other stations flex to meet customer demand. Nuclear could not
be privatised in the future without guaranteed baseload running,
otherwise it would not be profitable.''
Like the man he replaces, Professor Harper, Dr Preston had been upset
by Scottish Nuclear's recent publicity campaign, seen as knocking coal,
because of the damaging gaseous emissions from coal-fired power
stations. ''I spoke out because I felt that Scottish Nuclear's
advertising campaign had gone over the mark,'' says Preston now.
''The debate doesn't benefit from slanging matches and in this
instance they've pushed it a bit far and infuriated the coal lobby.''
But, hold on a minute; how does one of the prime architects of the
Hunterston and Torness nuclear stations, in his days as chief engineer
of the old SSEB's generation design and construction division, end up as
a major voice for that coal lobby?
''I'm still a nuclear supporter,'' counters Preston. ''I believe it's
safe and I believe it's got its place in the fuel mix. But I don't want
the public to think it's cheap or to have selective claims made about
it. The nation has to decide what proportion of each energy source it
wants and, in my view, that's a political decision.''
And what of the charge against coal -- that burning it emits damaging
oxides of sulphur and nitrogen and that main contributor to the
greenhouse effect, carbon dioxide? Preston points out the sulphur
problem is being dealt with by a combination of low-sulphur Scottish
coal and sea water scrubbing, while ScottishPower is leading the way, at
Longannet, on a demonstration gas-burning technique, to reduce emissions
of oxides of nitrogen by up to 70%, supported by the EU's THERMIE
programme.
And what of carbon dioxide emissions, where nuclear claims its
greatest advantage against coal? Preston admits it's a big issue hanging
round coal's neck. But he insists the jury's still out on the impact of
greenhouse gases on climate change. ''The real danger is that we could
go overboard about it when big nations in the Far East are doing nothing
about it at all.''
He talks approvingly of more action on vehicle emissions and stronger
energy efficiency drives. But beyond that, Preston's only counsel is
that, in the real world, it's never wise to push ahead of the pack.
Ross Harper's early role at Mining (Scotland) has been cast as the
charioteer, trying to keep a number of wilful horses -- ranging from the
NUM to venture capitalists and commercial mining interests -- on a
common course. Ian Preston acknowledges the scale of the task. ''I would
be kidding myself if I thought it was simple.''
He recalls an encounter with Frank Chapple, the legendary
electricians' leader, in Preston's time with the CEGB in the late 1970s.
Chapple slapped down one of his own members thus: ''If you've got a
product nobody wants to buy, very soon you won't have anything to make.
So wrap up.''
That kind of market realism, Preston believes, will drive Mining
(Scotland) forward. And having the man who used to run its biggest
customer in the chair should help too.

As a result of Ann Shaw's article (February 2) about Gloria Hunniford
and the herbal remedy obtained from Ginkgo biloba, readers may be
interested to know that this unusual tree may be seen at two sites in
Hamilton.
A much older specimen is to be found in the grounds of Drumlanrig
Castle, and there are probably others around the country in addition to
those mentioned in the Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardens.
The maidenhair tree, as it is commonly known, is the sole survivor of
a family of trees that flourished 200 million years ago. It has
fan-shaped leaves resembling in shape oversized leaflets of the
maidenhair fern.
Male and female flowers are borne on different trees and the yellow
fruits are seldom seen here. Regarded as a sacred tree and originally
planted in the vicinity of temples in the Far East, it was not
introduced into Europe until 1730.

MIAMI: A Florida woman let her quadraplegic husband rot to death, a
court was told yesterday. Police entered her home in 1990 and found her
husband Scott Mickler, 31, barely alive in a bed covered with excrement.
He had bleeding cuts, lesions, and rotting skin, and died hours after
arriving in hospital. A jury found nursing assistant Cheryl Mickler
guilty of neglect and abusing a disabled person. She faces up to 15
years in prison. Prosecutors said Mickler was an extravagant, greedy
woman who knew exactly what she was doing when she let her husband die,
sacking his nurses and barring family contact. Scott Mickler had been
awarded #2.3m after a 1978 car accident and the couple married in 1985.

ALMOST 35% of all the money awarded under the multi-million pound
European Objective One Programme last year went to Highlands and Islands
Enterprise or one of its 10 local enterprise companies.
The news will fuel speculation that HIE, whose Inverness headquarters
houses the Objective One office, has some inside track to winning
approval for its projects in the race to lay claim to the #250m that
will come to the Highlands and Islands from Europe over the next six
years.
The allocations were attacked last night by senior council figures and
Western Isles MP Calum MacDonald, who said they could result in areas of
greatest need not receiving the necessary funding.
According to previously confidential figures now released by the
Highlands and Islands Partnership, which administers the Objective One
Programme, some #20,997,968 was committed to projects up to the end of
1994.
Of that total, #7,235,146 went to the HIE or its Lecs. The total
awarded to HIE itself was #5,754,154, which covered projects ranging
from #12,200 for vocational qualifications infrastructure development to
#1m for ''HI Ventures (Provisional) -- capital''.
Argyll and the Islands Enterprise was granted #41,097 for three
projects, Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise #30,000 for one, Inverness
and Nairn #136,555 under three headings, Lochaber Ltd #1,216,350 under
three, Moray, Badenoch and Strathspey Enterprise #11,641 for one, Ross
and Cromarty Enterprise #28,325 for two, Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise
#10,974 for two, and Orkney Islands Enterprise #6050 for one.
At first sight, the councils have fared better than the HIE network
with a total of #10,369,657 approved by the partnership. But if
#4,186,000 for the Scalpay Bridge is taken out of the equation, it
leaves the total the councils have won at just over #6m, considerably
less than the HIE network.
The vice-convener of the Western Isles Council, Councillor Angus
Graham, said: ''I find these figures really quite surprising given the
partnership covers so many different bodies. The three islands councils
and Highland Regional Council must have combined budgets of around
#500m. They are the biggest employers and are huge players in the daily
lives of Highlanders and islanders -- far more so than HIE or the Lecs.
''I think the figures certainly bear out the suspicion that the
Enterprise Network is exerting far too much influence on the Objective
One programme. This was always going to be a danger after they decided
to site the Objective One office in the HIE headquarters.''
Mr MacDonald said: ''My complaint all along has been that too much of
the money is being distributed on an ad hoc basis, instead of being
targeted on the areas of greatest need.
''As long as Objective One is run by officials and bureaucrats, with
no local democratic input, we cannot have confidence that the money will
be spent on the right priorities.''
However, Mr Dennis Malone, programme director of Objective One, denied
the HIE network was receiving preferential treatment. He said: ''You
must remember that of the HIE total some #2m is for government training
schemes but, yes, they are doing well. They are doing exactly the sort
of things that the programme is seeking to do.''
A HIE spokesman said: ''I think the figures reflect the scale of our
spending on economic development, most of our #78m budget.''

I read with interest the article on ''Tait's Tower'' (February 2), and
would respectfully point out that the tower was not the Tait Tower but
the Tower of Empire.
Tait was the architect of the 1938 Empire Exhibition at Bellahouston
Park. The Tower of Empire was supplied and constructed by the Glasgow
Steel Roofing Company. I have both press cuttings from the time as well
as cine film which has been transferred to video. It shows the
construction and various footage of the exhibition.
My late mother was the first lady to climb the Tower of Empire, some
300ft on staging and ladders. Interestingly, when word got out about my
mother, the guest lady aviator cancelled her visit to the exhibition.
I am further annoyed at the inaccurate reporting on the demise of the
tower. The Glasgow Steel Roofing Company offered it as a gift to the
Glasgow Corporation. This offer was turned down, the Labour-controlled
Corporation stating that it had insufficient funds to maintain the
tower. It was then unfortunately demolished.
You report that the original tower was demolished because it would
have been an invaluable landmark for German bombers. The exhibition
ended in 1938 and war was not declared until 16 months later. Did the
councillors of the time have psychic foreknowledge that war was going to
be declared in September, 1939?
The reported #30,000 to be spent on a feasibility study seems a waste
of public money as there are people with detailed information of the
Tower of Empire. My late father was greatly involved in this during 1937
and 1938, and I have ample documentation.

The restrictions placed on Dee rod-and-line salmon anglers rely
heavily on figures recorded by the Banchory-Devenick fish counter. Last
summer the improvement association noted: ''Over the past two months
exhaustive tests have been carried out on the counter to check its
accuracy. These have proved that there is no fundamental problem with
the counter.''
They said: ''The information revealed by the counter is of such a
serious implication that it would have to be seriously malfunctioning
for there to be any room for a change in our conclusions.'' Using the
huge rod-exploitation rates thrown up by the counter to justify
delcaring a crisis, they stated: ''Without the fish counter we would
still be in the dark.''
Well, it's ''lights out'' time again for the board because their fish
counter is flawed: a more than huge margin of error, as much as 10:1,
has been found. Colonel Campbell, board chairman, said: ''As a result,
it has not been possible to proceed with a formal application to the
Secretary of State for a variation of the season . . . pending further
investigation.''
Further investigation has disclosed that 10,000 spring salmon entered
the river -- bringing the rod catch element into line with that which is
normal for most other rivers. Given these figures it is ridiculous to
maintain that rod-and-line catches are a threat to Dee salmon stocks.
Nothing the board has done will affect the real issue: devastation of
sand eel stocks in the North Sea and indiscriminate, interceptory
netting -- Dee nets take 6000 salmon. By deflecting attention away from
these running sores the board simply delays the inevitable, continuing
decline in Dee salmon numbers.

John McFall's Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill has its second reading on
Friday, March 3. This Bill seeks to prohibit certain acts of cruelty
including snaring and the use of dogs to hunt and kill wild animals such
as foxes, deer, and hares.
It is important that as many people as possible write to their MPs
urging them to be present in Parliament to support the Bill.

In the recent correspondence about musical tributes to the city of
Glasgow, no mention has been made of The Glasgow Suite, written in 1986
as a commission from the first Glasgow International Jazz Festival by
its composer in residence, the legendary Benny Carter.
Also, far from the city's political masters failing to support the
commissioning of a ''Glasgow piece of music'' (Harry Diamond, January
23), Glasgow District Council has been the principal benefactor of the
jazz festival from its inception and, with several senior councillors
and the Lord Provost on its board of directors, there has certainly been
an awareness among them about the earmarking of funds by the festival
for commissioning works from its composers in residence.
The city's support may appear indirect, but is no less real and has
been crucial in the creation of such new works. Many of these works then
become available to the Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra and enable
tomorrow's generation of young musicians to benefit from the opportunity
to perform unique works written by some of the world's leading jazz
composers.
While public benefactors are being mentioned, the contribution of
Strathclyde Regional Council should not be overlooked. As well as
funding SYJO, it has given financial support to the jazz festival by
involving its composer in residence in educational projects. It is to be
hoped that the forthcoming changes in loval government will not result
in the loss of such support to a seriously under-funded music.
After the 1986 jazz festival there were informal discussions with
Benny Carter about extending his 20-minute work with a view to recording
an album so that his Glasgow Suite might stand alongside his Kansas City
Suite, recorded earlier by Count Basie.
These did not reach fruition due to a combination of funding problems
and management changes at the festival. Nine years Benny Carter has fond
memories of his stay here and, as a very active 87 year old still at the
peak of his profession (he is currently nominated for two Grammy
awards), would be enthusiastic about any possibility of completing the
task.
Funding of such a venture would provide a fitting climax to the
existing local authorities' support of jazz in Glasgow and Strathclyde
before they are consigned to history, as well as offering Benny Carter
an opportunity to remind us all why he is one of the most respected and
gifted of twentieth-century musicians.

Stewart Lamont asserted that ''the problems of Blackhill are not about
lack of money, they are poverty of spirit'' (January 28). My experience
as parish minister in that area is quite the opposite. I can only
express admiration for what I have seen of the community spirit.
Before recent demolition was carried out, a survey showed that more
than 90% of people wanted to stay in Blackhill because of the sense of
community support. This was in spite of the many problems of the area.
Good people have worked very hard to produce an imaginative housing
development plan which would keep the sense of community. One of the
major problems is most certainly lack of money.

How ironical it was to see your editorial on the lack of Japanese
compensation for war victims alongside the pro-Japanese letter form
Jennifer Jarvie (January 30).
I make no comment on the letter but recommend that she read Lord
Russell's book The Knights of Bushido. It is about two inches thick and
catalogues Japanese atrocities during the war, from China through all
the Far East countries overrun by them.
She castigates the Americans but the only mistake they made was
helping the Japanese to achieve by chicanery what they couldn't achieve
by savagery.

As a senior house officer who has run the gauntlet of a busy Glasgow
city casualty, I felt I had to respond to some inaccuracies (February
2).
There is a staffing crisis in accident and emergency (A and E) because
of the appalling working conditions and poor salaries. Pay rates for
most junior casualty officers are closer to #8 an hour than #10. There
is no pay differential between A and E and quieter and safer jobs within
the hospital.
A and E is no longer regarded as training for any other speciality,
which means few people regard it as a grounding for a career in
medicine.
The press and conservative senior doctors have identified the
reduction in junior doctors' working hours (down to 56 per week in A and
E -- almost part-time) as the culprit. Is this based on fact or
research? It would be better journalism to compare the figures before
and after the new deal.
In my experience reduction in hours is achieved mainly by increasing
the workload for those on duty. The trusts are actually benefiting by
reducing their medical wage bills in direct contradiction of the spirit
of the reduced hours.
There is a high level of despondency in junior doctor ranks (confirmed
by a BMJ survey). Being a consultant is no longer the be-all and end-all
it used to be, so we are less inclined to put up with poor conditions in
the training grades on the way up.
I feel that the crisis is due to the fact that vast numbers of my
colleagues are fleeing these shores in search of professional respect
and reasonable working conditions.
The Australians, for example, have a really revolutionary idea -- they
pay overtime at more than the usual hourly rate! This inspires managers
to fill posts rather than to rely on cut-rate overtime.
Another interesting line of journalistic investigation would be to see
how many British doctors are overseas.
Perhaps we would see the end of the crisis if professional people were
treated as such and compensated for enduring war zones on Friday and
Saturday nights.

The Prime Minister's attempt to appease the Euro-sceptics on Friday
night is yet another twist to his already tortuous European policy. His
actions are reminiscent of John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar, who, by his
frequent change of sides in the political machinations of the early
eighteenth century, earned himself the sobriquet of ''Bobbing John''.
However, if he is attempting to be all things to all men, perhaps
''The Vicar of Bray'' would be more appropriate.

MUSING elegantly over the olives, the solitary woman in the
Travellers' Bar is secretly worrying that everyone is staring at her,
pitying, wondering if she has been jilted or, indeed, has any friends at
all. The head barman, meanwhile, is bracing himself with a few stealthy
vodkas and a jigger of prejudice before politely insinuating that she
might care to move elsewhere. Ancient conditioning commands him to be
suspicious of women alone in public places. He thinks this wistful
sophisticate might just be on the game.
Five years off the new millennium and still hotel managements are
disconcerted by the vision of single women in their midst. Yet it is
part of the Equality Package that women today have more opportunities
than ever before to circle the universe. Like the men queuing at the
reception desk, they are most probably checking into the hotel for
legitimate business, or as a spin-off from hard-won independence. They
are not prepared to be treated as a nuisance, but if that is their lot,
why is similar suspicion not directed at single males?
The other day London's Atheneum Hotel released a survey conducted
among 500 women in which three in four respondents complained of ''low
quality'' service when staying alone in British hotels. The study noted
that employees were often patronising, flirtatious, or rude to female
clients, and in some cases women guests were accused of prostitution
when they returned to their hotels late at night.
Such problems are not exclusive to this country. Not long ago a
fashion colleague covering the designer collections in New York arrived
back at her hotel room to discover the entire place had been gone over.
Mocking her from the bathroom shelf was her one remaining possession, a
large jar of vitamin pills. After the usual unsatisfactory session with
the house detective, then the police department, she told the hotel
management that, because of the incident, she was not prepared to pay
the bill. They in turn shrugged in that manner which, within
half-a-second, changes from nonchalance to menace, and said that if she
did not settle her account they, too, would be obliged to call the
police. And anyway, for all they knew she could have been a deranged
person who had arrived with empty suitcases and invented the whole
affair. After all, they smirked, this was New York. It had happened
before.
Hotel security is an especially urgent matter for women. A friend
visiting Rome last year recalls that when she checked into her hotel the
desk clerk called out her room number as he handed over the key. ''He
signalled to everyone present that I was a woman alone, staying in 309.
This shouldn't happen anywhere but it does repeatedly, and it is the
kind of unthinking behaviour which makes even an experienced career
woman apprehensive.''
Once tapped the subject of hotel security yields a haul of angry
anecdotes. The other week I booked into a Liverpool city centre hotel
and inadvertently went to the wrong door, trying key 905 in room 908. It
opened, but as soon as I stepped inside I could see the room, although
empty of life, was already inhabited. Retreating in shock, I tried the
key in the correct lock, where it worked equally well. The management
were horrified. I could not fault their concern and although they moved
me to a suite, such incidents do little for the equilibrium. If this can
happen in one case, how many others? There are more than 200 bedrooms in
this particular hotel.
Recently female flight attendants with Northwest Airlines in America
were routinely accompanied to their hotel rooms by a porter or male
colleague who carried out a security sweep, checking wardrobes, the
bathroom, and under the bed for any intruder. To outsiders such
precautions may seem neurotic to the point of melodrama but there was
sound reason for such attention. In 1991 one of the airline's employees
was found gagged, raped, and fatally stabbed in her room at the Hilton
Hotel in Romulus, Michigan. The killer had lurked in a stairway,
overpowering her as she arrived to unlock her door.
At least 25% of business travellers now are women, and while many
hotels have improved their in-room facilities (hairdryers, shampoos, an
iron as well as a trouser press, and sometimes a bowl of fruit), still
too few have peepholes in the doors or proper security bolts, an
essential when electronic key systems are often so faulty. Experience
has also taught some women to insist that hotel switchboards identify
telephone callers before they are transferred.
But in old, aristocratic hotels no-one casts a more watchful eye over
female guests than the powder room vigilante. Amid the rococo splendour
of that perfumed salon, the attendant presides as guardian of a
hierarchical coven. There are her regulars, the residents with whom she
exchanges intimate gossip: ''The last I heard, he had sent a bouquet of
gardenias, always a sign of desperation.'' There are the arrivistes in
their new-money Versaces. And to those who might be up to mischief there
is the curl of a reprimand on her old vermilion mouth.
But her real scorn is reserved for that solitary woman who dodges in,
seeking refuge from the Travellers' Bar. In the mirror this woman is
unnerved to see the vigilante's gaze beamed on her squalid make-up purse
as she tries to restore her public face with a stump of broken lipstick.

LIKE the head of any other business, the Scottish Prison Service chief
executive receives mailshots offering the opportunity to improve
efficiency and performance. Thus he found in his in-tray recently a
communication from a business service company called Taylor Nelson who
''help clients measure, monitor, and improve customer satisfaction
levels''.
''Dear Mr Frizzell,'' the letter began. ''Would you like to know which
customers you are at risk of losing?''
This at a time when Mr Frizzell was still somewhat exercised after an
attempted escape at Perth Prison. He scribbled a one-word answer --
''Yes'' -- before consigning it to the out-tray.
Gastronomic raise
BRITISH Gas chairman Cedric Brown has been in Scotland on a mission to
explain. Why, for instance, the company can afford to raise his salary
by #205,000 to #475,000 but at the same time introduce pay cuts for the
workers at the bottom end of the British Gas pay scale.
The morale-boosting trip involved a meeting over a bite to eat with
his senior Scottish management. The venue for this bash was the
appropriately-named Versailles and Trianon function rooms at the
Caledonian Hotel.
The next day Cedric told his tale to selected ordinary employees from
all over Scotland. The difference was they got nothing to eat. Not even
cake.
Lally's world
GLASGOW city boss Pat Lally, quoted on the front page of the council
newspaper The Bulletin on the subject of the proposed 300ft landmark or
folly, investment or waste of money (delete whatever suits your
prejudices): ''Just as Eiffel Tower is synonymous with Paris and the
Golden Gate with New York, Tait's Tower would automatically be
associated with Glasgow.''
Frankly, we're worried about Pat. For a district cooncillor, he's
obviously not travelling the world enough.
Zen and the art of
food preparation
COMING soon to Glasgow, a Japanese restaurant which promises customers
that Scottish experience -- a good tightener.
Clive Schmulian, the man behind the concept, told the Diary:
''Japanese food is not all about tiny portions of raw fish at high
prices.'' Apparently our average man in the street in Tokyo is more
likely to be found tucking into hearty meat and chicken broths and
large, filling portions of noodles.
In short, Moshi Moshi, which opens in Buccleuch Street at the end of
March, will be offering food the way your Japanese granny might have
made it. (Moshi Moshi is not a reference to the game involving marbles
that we used to play on the streets of Glasgow when we were wee. It is
what a Japanese person says when answering the phone. Like ''Pronto!''
in Italy or ''Digame!'' in Spain. Or ''I'm sorry, he's in the pub'' when
people phone the Diary.)
But back to the Japanese restaurant, where Clive is telling us about
the concept of the Bento box, which he will be introducing to Glasgow.
It is a meal in a lacquered wooden contraption with four or five
different sections, like a TV dinner, housing your noodles, grilled
chicken yakitori, or carrots and green beans wrapped in beef and sauteed
in shoyu and minh.
We think the Zen Bento, a ''taste of a Zen Buddhist temple, shojin
style suitable for vegetarians'' should go down well with your right-on
citizens. The food is washed down with plum wine, sake, and Sapporo
Japanese beer.
But, according to the TV adverts, don't the Japanese smart set all
drink Tennent's lager? During his many months of research in Japan,
Clive avers that he never once saw a drop of the stuff.
Clive is a dentist to trade but has decided to swop the drilling and
filling in favour of shuffling sushi. ''I'll still be working as a
dentist two days a week,'' he told us. ''Just like Sir Paul Beresford,
the Tory Housing Minister who is allowed to work as a dentist three days
a week?'' we asked.
''Don't mention my politics,'' said Clive. Don't worry, your secret is
safe with us.
Out of Africa
THE Disney cartoon Lion King appears to have made an impact on the
language. The eponymous hero and his chums are to be heard saying the
phrase ''Acuna mattata'', which, it is explained, means ''No problems''.
Two medical types at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, aficionados of
the film, have taken to using the above-mentioned phrase. Thus a
colleague of Zimbabwean origin was surprised to overhear a consultant
say of a straightforward case that it was ''Acuna mattata''.
''I didn't know you could speak Swahili,'' he said.
Nuts in Barcelona

IT is a pity that Mr Allan Stewart has had to resign his ministerial
position at the Scottish Office. He has always been a strong and able
defender of what is left of the Conservative and Unionist position in
Scotland, and in the interests of effective political pluralism a
Minister who is willing and able to fight his corner is worth a great
deal to the whole community. Nor is it absolutely certain that he needed
to resign. He has not been charged with any offence arising from the
alleged affair in Pollok Castle woods. If charges are laid, a
resignation would be inevitable; if they are not, the loss of office
seems a high price to pay for what was an indiscretion which does not
bring with it a heavy burden of embarrassment. It is true that Mr
Stewart was always a reluctant Minister. He had office thrust upon him
rather than actively seeking it, largely because of the desperate
paucity of suitable candidates for the position among Scotland's
shrunken band of Conservative MPs. Nevertheless, his resignation after
discussion with Conservative Whips will do something to redeem the image
of a political party whose offenders have had to be forced screaming and
kicking from office in the recent past. In this respect Mr Stewart has
taught his colleagues a lesson.
These expressions of regret do not, however, absolve anyone from blame
for the events of the weekend. Mr Stewart is an opinionated and
headstrong man. His visit to the site of the motorway took place in the
company of members of his family and friends and he was accompanied by
representatives of the construction company working on the project. It
cannot be said emphatically enough that this is not the way in which a
Minister should conduct his business. It was only too likely that Mr
Stewart and his party would meet the protesters who are encamped there.
Of the allegations against Mr Stewart's son and another youngster in his
party we can say nothing, save that if proved to be true they represent
the uttermost stupidity. There is a history of Scottish Office folly in
respect of ministerial visits and security. Mr Lang set an unfortunate
example when he visited flood-damaged areas in the aftermath of the
torrential rain in December. On one memorable occasion he drove his own
car and had no security or police representative with him. Following
that incident this newspaper asked the Scottish Office repeatedly
whether this was a sensible idea, and for a description of the
guidelines offered to Ministers on their personal security. Scottish
Office officials declined to explain.
It is clear that on security grounds alone these guidelines must be
tightened and Ministers must be told that they are required to adhere to
them. This will not be Mr Ian Lang's only task in the aftermath of the
Pollok affair. He has a new Scottish Office Minister in Mr George Kynoch
who is pleasant, personable, and utterly loyal. He is also very
inexperienced. This is not the fault of Mr Kynoch or of Mr Lang. Both
suffer from the persistent rejection at the ballot box in Scotland of
their party and policies and the shortlist of Mr Kynoch and Mr Raymond
Robertson for the available post was very short indeed. It is most
unlikely that Mr Kynoch will be able to fill Mr Stewart's shoes, or even
the toecaps of them. He will be pleasant, personable, and loyal but
could be utterly ineffective, thereby putting a greater burden on the
Secretary of State. Mr Lang may also be personally disappointed at the
further dilution of ministerial effectiveness in the Scottish Office.
Every departure, and every new and inexperienced Minister, makes his own
tenure of the job more secure. Ironically, this may not be what he wants
as the more indispensable he becomes the less likely his chances of
promotion to a major ministry. Scottish Tories will be unhappy at the
events of recent days. Mr Stewart brought a sparkle, if an eccentric
one, to office. The Scottish Office will be greyer than ever and, in the
declining days of a government, this is not to anyone's advantage.

IT is strange that belief in the Devil and his subordinates appears to
be on the decline. According to some religious authorities, it is no
longer a central article of Christian faith, and even examples in the
Gospels can be regarded as accommodating contemporary tradition. Such a
view would gain little support in Scotland, of course, where the battle
against Auld Nick has been going on for centuries. Nevertheless, there
are disturbing signs that he is no longer regarded as the adversary he
was. Politicians like to attend church, for instance, and freely admit
that their policies are the result of divine guidance. Very few blame
Satan when things go wrong, however, such as the need for higher taxes,
interest rates, etc. They say it is because of global forces.
Fortunately there are centres of stiff resistance to the Devil. His
opponents will welcome the news that the Rev Tom Willis, who is retiring
after 30 years as adviser on the supernatural to the Archbishop of York,
is to train 30 fellow clergymen on how to conduct exorcisms, deal with
apparitions, evil spirits, and suchlike. ''I will teach them how to cope
with everything, from hauntings by poltergeists to messing about with
tarot cards and ouija boards,'' he said. It is to be hoped that as well
as using his ultimate weapon of bell, book, and candle, Mr Willis will
also teach postulants how to deal with the minor sorts of demon --
hobgoblins, pixies, etc.
It is difficult to understand why some people are sceptical. It was
obvious enough to previous generations. Admitting the operation of
malign forces is to solve many of life's difficulties, from toothache
and migraine to mislaying library books and choosing the wrong lottery
numbers. Mr Willis's record of success in the field has been most
impressive. Eight years ago he was even called in by the DHSS to
exorcise a haunted Bridlington trawler. The crew said they were
frightened to go to sea, and kept claiming unemployment benefit.

NEVER before has the public made its feelings about animal welfare so
clearly and vociferously known. Pensioners, students, teachers,
unemployed people, families -- they have blockaded roads, waved their
placards, and shouted slogans, giving voice to a conscience that was
hitherto associated with a rather more lunatic fringe.
If the demonstrations against the transportation of calves have shown
the sharp end of public opinion, recent moves by the supermarket stores
operating in Scotland have shown that they are beginning to respond to a
growing groundswell demanding that proper care is taken from hoof to
plate.
From next month Sainsbury's will stock exclusively meat which comes
with ''product confidence'' -- meat traceable to farms which are known
to operate good animal husbandry. Its beef and lamb will all come from
farms signed up to the Farm Assured Scotch Livestock scheme and its pork
from the parallel Farm Assured scheme called the Scottish Pig Industry
Initiative.
Safeway, one of its biggest rivals, has already met its target of
having 100% of its butchery produce Farm Assured; Tesco has its own
in-house guality assurance label, and along with the Co-op chain is
looking to expand its range of Freedom Food, the mark monitored by the
RSPCA.
The Co-op chain sells Farm Assured pork, but when the FASL scheme was
launched for beef and lamb, it feared there might not be sufficient
availability to meet its needs. That policy may be reviewed in the
future.
But with Safeway, Sainsbury, and possibly the Co-op on board, can FASL
cope with demand? Will Scottish farmers realise that possible short-term
losses to meet the demands of the scheme will be outweighed by long-term
gains?
It was the foresight of an Elgin butcher, Jim Royan, which put
Scottish livestock producers ahead of the game some four years ago.
The then Highlands and Islands Development Board, National Farmers'
Union in Scotland, and Meat and Livestock Commission had set up a
committee to look at how the Scottish meat industry could respond to
animal welfare concerns. As a result, FASL and its parallel pork body
were set up, but it is probably only relatively recently that farmers,
and supermarkets, have caught up with the thinking of the schemes'
originators.
So far, 1700 of Scotland's 10,000 livestock farmers have joined FASL.
Membership requires agreement to an annual fee of #100, an annual
inspection, and adherence to a code covering everything from origin of
stock, stockmanship, and welfare practices, feed composition, and
storage, the prohibition of routine feeding or dosage with steroid
growth promoters or unlicensed prescribable antibiotics, housing and
handling facilities, medicines and veterinary treatment, livestock
loading, and transport, auction market standards, and meat plant
standards.
The managing director of both FASL and SPII, Peter Brown, said: ''For
the farmer, it's a way of saying to the outside world that what they are
doing is competent and professional. We are about good practice.''
Although FASL meat comes with a high specification of tenderness and
leanness, Mr Brown believes that these are not the only considerations
motivating supermarkets.
''One way or another, every retailer I know is trying to find ways of
protecting himself in terms of animal welfare.''
With this in mind, FASL recruitment is growing. John Duncan, an
Ayrshire livestock farmer and a former convener of the NFU's animal
health and welfare group, is about to become a member. Why did he not
join before? ''It is clear that our customers -- the supermarkets -- are
placing more emphasis on animal welfare issues and that is the sign we
have been needing,'' he said.
Yet, if supermarkets really are responding to public demands for
product confidence, why are they not marketing their compassionate
credentials more strongly? Sainsbury claims it will ''certainly be
making announcements once 100% of our meat products are part of the FASL
agreement''. However, Peter Brown remains hesitant. There is a history
of cautiousness in the meat industry.
''There always has been unease about saying an animal has had a nice
life if it has been killed. But we live in rapidly changing times and
retailers will become more upfront about these things.''
From the farmer's point of view, John Duncan said: ''Retailers don't
seem to want to associate the product on the plate with a live animal.''
For welfare groups such as Compassion in World Farming, years of
lobbying are finally beginning to pay off.
''We have been campaigning sine the late 1960s on farm animal welfare.
It has now permeated the population. The live export issue brought it to
a head, and it has reached a critical mass now. Public opinion has been
building and when the major ferry companies responded by pulling out of
the cross-Channel trade, this sparked a sea-change,'' said Philip
Lymbery, campaign director.
That said, he is still uneasy about the plethora of schemes that
abound and would like to see more rigorous labelling -- for example,
reference not to ''battery'' eggs, but ''eggs from caged hens''.
Mrs Deirdre Hutton, chairman of the Scottish Consumer Council,
welcomes FASL. She sees it as ''a system which might raise the quality
of foodstuffs for consumers, which has to be a good thing''.
But she warned: ''It has to be coupled with a good independent system
to judge what is happening and what the criteria are for joining.
''One of the advantages of the Farm Assured original concept is that
it covers all produce and the whole business -- from hoof to plate. It
is clear that consumer anxieties have changed. Now people are going
beyond the farm gate and want to know about animal welfare, crops,
pesticides, and fertilisers,'' she said.

CAUGHT in the middle of the debate, restaurateurs often have to
position themselves between catering for the public's appetite for
certain foods and addressing public taste about certain moral questions.
In Glasgow, the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant does not serve veal on the
menu, principally because of what chef/proprietor Ronald Clydesdale
feels about the whole issue.
Speaking yesterday, Mr Clydesdale said in 23 years the meat had been
offered only once and only because he knew where it came from. It has
not been included as a dish since and he does not see it being included
again.
Up in Stirling, the Italia Nostra restaurant, however, has not noticed
any drop in demand for veal from the public, despite the current public
outcry over the export trade.
''We still have a healthy demand for it,'' said a spokesman for the
restaurant. ''It doesn't seem to be affecting our customers.''
Over in Edinburgh, Mr Malcolm Duck, proprietor of Le Marche Noir, said
the issue should be a matter of choice and restaurants should be free to
offer a range of vegetarian and meat dishes.
Catherine Brown, The Herald's food writer, said in general veal was
not a favoured dish in Scotland, which boasts top quality beef, game and
fish.
''We are not dependent on veal as some other European countries which
don't have these other quality products.''
She said in general the public furore over the veal trade was welcome
because it increased awareness of what goes on behind the scenes.
''In this country we have this big long food chain. Because of the
monopoly of supermarkets, we don't understand how and where our food
comes from.''

SCOTLAND'S top men's badminton player, Bruce Flockhart, could soon be
forced to leave his home country.
That was the bleak news he delivered in the wake of his recent
Scottish title success, admitting that this time next year he would have
to re-think his current plans to remain in the country.
''I have a year and half to finish at Stirling University,'' he said.
''As long as I can continue to travel abroad for extra training and
competition that will be sufficient, but this time next year I may well
be making plans to move away and play full-time.
Flockhart put part of his victory over Jim Mailer in the national
final down to the weeks he spent playing in Denmark before the
championships, and he has plans to play at the Swiss and Austrian Opens,
the All-England championships, and three British Grand Prix events.
Meanwhile, another Scottish internationalist, Craig Robertson, has
started a coaching business which will give him more time to train.

MIKE Atherton has urged England to pin their faith in the future --
whether or not he remains captain. ''I would implore the selectors to
look to younger players and stick with them over the next few months and
years,'' said Atherton at the end of another failed Ashes campaign.
England's bid to turn the tables on Australia after three consecutive
series defeats backfired badly with a 3-1 mauling. And, among the
biggest disappointments, were 41-year-old Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting
(37) who totalled just 427 runs between them.
And still on the subject of statistics, look at those of Craig
McDermott. Three months ago, the Aussie fast bowler put England on the
road to ruin with a six-wicket haul during the first Test in Brisbane.
Yesterday, he finished with another six of the best as Australia won the
final match by 329 runs.
Well as Shane Warne (27 wickets) bowled at times, and brilliantly
though Michael Slater (three centuries) batted throughout, McDermott was
unchallenged as player of the series. His 32-wicket haul came despite a
continuing battle against injury and illness.
England's few successes paled in comparison. Captain Mike Atherton
battled bravely while never quite reaching top form, Graham Thorpe made
good progress on his way to 444 Test runs, and Darren Gough, before
being struck down by a broken foot, confirmed himself as England's most
exciting discovery for years.
Injuries and illness -- starting with Alec Stewart's broken finger on
October 24 and going through to Graeme Hick's slipped disc on January 25
-- undeniably played a part in England's demise.
The difference in class between the two sides was most obvious in the
field. Australia's batsmen added to the pressure by stealing outrageous
runs against an opposition with too many ageing performers.
At least England's catching was commendable until the final Test when
10 clear opportunities went begging. Australia, on the other hand,
pouched just about everything in Perth -- including another three
chances yesterday after the tourists had resumed, virtually out on 27
for five.
Atherton flicked Glenn McGrath down the leg-side for Ian Healy to
pounce before another run had been added.
But at least Mark Ramprakash (42), who has made good use of his one
Test opportunity, and Steve Rhodes (39 no) saved England from complete
humiliation with a stand of 68.
But the match was still over five minutes ahead of lunch with Mark
Waugh having Ramprakash spectacularly caught in the gulley by twin
brother Steve before McDermott polished off the tail. Scores:
AUSTRALIA -- 402 and 345 for eight declared. ENGLAND -- 295 and 123.
(McDermott 6-38, McGrath 3-40).
Meanwhile, win, lose or tie, Alan Wells's England A side will be able
to hold their heads high today after a triumphant three-Test series in
India.
Needing 177 to complete a 3-0 whitewash of India A, England finished a
tense fourth day yesterday on 146 for eight -- a tantalising 31 runs
short of their target.
ENGLAND A -- 209 and 146 for eight. INDIA A -- 229 and 156.

PLAY in the Bank of Scotland junior curling championship starts this
evening at Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre.
As well as trying to prove to be Scotland's best, this weekend's
winners also will gain the right to represent Scotland at the world
junior championships, which wil be held in Perth later this season.
Lockerbie's Craig Wilson, the 1993 world junior champion and reigning
Scottish title holder, should be a strong contender for the men's event,
although his stuttering form in the district playdowns caused one or two
anxious moments.
James Dryburgh, of Aviemore, was world champion in 1991 and will have
something extra to prove on the ice this weekend, following his
controversial non-participation in the Macallan Scottish championships.
The women's event looks wide open, although Fiona Brown, of
Greenacres, has been consistent so far this season and is one of the
favourites.
The event will be played on a round-robin basis through to Saturday
afternoon, and any tie-breakers will take place after that on Saturday
before the semi-finals and finals the following day.

MARTIN Heath has joined fellow-Scot Peter Nicol on squash's wanted
list, having this week signed for Super Squash league champions, Welsh
Back Wizards, while also competing in Germany and France.
Since joining world No.5 Nicol in the stable of coach, Neil Harvey,
Heath has made big strides. He recently defeated England's Jason
Nicolle, took world No.16 Tony Hands to a deciding fifth game, and he
reached the quarter-finals of a world-ranking event in Budapest last
week.
Heath will have another chance to beat Hands in the North of Scotland
Open in Aberdeen, from February 24-26, while he will return to the
Granite City a fortnight later to join Nicol as Scotland's
representation in the British Telesquash event.
Currently No.36 in the world, Heath will then get back on the ranking
trail in the Portuguese Open next month, an event in which Nicol also
will take part
''Unfortunately, I'll have to qualify for Portugal,'' said Heath. ''My
main target is to get into the world's top 24.

THE Scottish Amateur Rowing Association has banned the Clyde club --
one of its founder members in 1881 -- from taking part in the sport due
to what is described as substantial debts to the association.
The club has not paid its affiliation fees from last year nor the levy
due to the governing boby from entries by other clubs at their events
last year.
And the SARA is unable to quantify how much is owed, because Clyde
have not given in a formal return of the number of crews that took part
in their events last year.
Yesterday association secretary Moira Pow said that the club had not
put forward any proposals as to how it will clear its debts.
The ban prohibits the club and its members from taking part in any
competitive event.
Even if an amnesty is negotiated, fund raising will continue to be a
difficulty for the club, as Clyde did not even bother to apply for a
date on the national regatta calendar to allow an event to take place
and monies to be raised.

DREW Docherty, the British bantamweight champion from Condorrat,
yesterday talked of three big incentives for his world title challenge
against Ghana's Alfred ''The Cobra'' Kotey in Cumbernauld on February 17
-- the challenge, the ambition, and the fear of failure.
Both boxers met at the Westerwood Hotel and Country Club yesterday and
while there was none of the hype which often surrounds such occasions,
both are convinced that they will succeed on the night.
We were faced with two little men, who, throughout their careers, have
preferred to do their stuff inside the ring, rather than just talk a
good fight before the event.
They do, however, have strong opinions. Said Docherty: ''I have three
things which will spur me on. For a start, I believe this will be the
toughest fight of my career, and I have trained accordingly. Secondly,
now that I have won a Lonsdale Belt outright, I am desperate to achieve
my next target of becoming world champion. Then, of course, there is the
thought of what will happen if things go wrong.
''Like Kotey, I have lost only once in my professional career. I was
beaten on points when challenging Vincenzo Belcastro for the European
title. I put so much into that fight, and when I didn't get the verdict,
I was gutted. I don't really fear failure for myself, because boxing is
a tough sport and there are so many things which can go wrong.
''What I do fear is letting people down -- my family, my friends, my
fans, and, of course, my country. I felt I had let everyone down when I
lost to Belcastro, and it took me a long time to get over it.
''I also know how my young brother Wilson felt last month when he was
outpointed going for the British featherweight title. I don't want my
family to experience anything like that again.''
Kotey, even though he will be fighting in Docherty's back yard, will
be favourite to retain the title he won in July of last year when he
outpointed Rafael Del Valle in London.
One of his heroes is fellow countryman and former world champion,
Azumah Nelson, who undoubtedly is one of the best fighters at any weight
in recent years. Kotey's Ghanaian trainer is Nelson's father-in-law, and
when he goes home, he works out at Nelson's gym.
Kotey wants to emulate Nelson, and is determined that Docherty will
not stand in his way. ''I have fought a lot of people with more
experience than Drew, and that is in my favour,'' he said.
''I still have the same speed I had when I was boxing at flyweight,
and that lets me do what I want in the ring. Being an African fighting
in this country means that I almost always have to go into an opponent's
backyard, so this job doesn't bother me. Let's see what Drew has to
offer.''
It was Kotey's reference to his days as a flyweight which drew a
response from Pat Clinton, the former world fly champion who is now in
charge of Docherty's training. He said: ''I see from his record that
Kotey was taken the distance by Mexico's Armando Diaz two years ago.
I had Diaz down three times before stopping him in seven rounds at
Cumbernauld a couple of years before that, and nobody could describe me
as being a heavy puncher. I don't think Kotey has taken his power into
the bantam division.
''You've got to give any world champion respect, but I feel some of
Kotey's opponents have given him too much, and let him dictate a fight.
''We have a strategy worked out -- obviously we're not saying what it
is -- and Kotey is in for a big surprise. Drew has nothing to fear.''
All the officials for the fight are from the other side of the
Atlantic. The referee is Wiso Fernandez, of Puerto Rico, and two of the
judges are his fellow countrymen, Ismael Quinones and Cesar Ramos. The
third judge is Gene Williams, from Atlantic City.
On the undercard, Willie ''The Mighty'' Quinn, the super-middleweight
from Tranent, will meet Martin Jolly, of Alfreton, Stirling lightweight
Hugh Collins takes on Paul Wynne, of Newcastle, and Cumbernauld light
welter Alan Peacock faces Kevin McKenzie, of Hartlepool.
A big attraction will be the appearance of unbeaten heavyweight
Richard Bango, of Nigeria, who won silver at the Olympics in Barcelona.
His opponent will be announced shortly.
AMATEUR boxing manager Frank Hendry announced yesterday that Scotland
will face England next Mondayat the Royal Lancaster Hotel, London.
Hendry also confirmed that this season's Scottish Championships will
be contested at three venues.
The preliminary ties on March 4 will be at the Monklands Time Capsule,
Coatbridge, half the semi-finals on March 13 at Fairfields Social Club,
Govan, with the remainder staged on March 17 at Dunblane Hydro.
The finals will be decided on March 23 at the Coatbridge venue.

JOHN Higgins yesterday cracked the #100,000 seasonal prize-money
barrier for the first time in his professional snooker career when he
defeated Darren Morgan 5-2 in the second round of the Benson and Hedges
Masters at Wembley Conference Centre.
The Scot now meets countryman Alan McManus, who along with Stephen
Hendry and Ken Doherty are the only players to reach the #100,000 mark
earlier than Higgins during this campaign.
Higgins, winner of the Skoda Grand Prix in October, looked to be
heading for a whitewash when he dominated the early stages.
While Morgan was missing one simple pot after another Higgins fired in
breaks of 46, 32, 45, and 111 -- his second century of the tournament --
to open a 4-0 lead.
Frame No.5 came down to the final black. Morgan tried to pot it into a
baulk pocket, but he was so far out that the ball rebounded off three
cushions and shot into a middle pocket.
Morgan briefly appeared capable of pulling off a fightback when he won
frame No.6 with a 104 clearance, but Higgins then regained the
advantage. He won a scrappy seventh frame to record his fourteenth
victory in 15 matches this year and guarantee himself a cheque for at
least #20,000.
Later, Jimmy White wrecked Joe Swail's debut in the tournament by
beating the Irishman 5-2.
Amazingly, it was only White's sixth win in nine tournaments during
the campaign and the #20,000 he is now guaranteed for reaching the
quarter-finals has almost doubled his prize money for the season.

CELTIC will have to wait until later today to learn the reaction of
the SFA to their threat not to accept the findings of an arbitration
tribunal which is due to sit next month to decide on a compensation
claim brought by kilmarnock.
The Rugby Park club are still angry at the loss of manager Tommy Burns
and his assistant Billy Stark to Celtic last summer. Celtic already have
been fined #100,000 by the Scottish League for inducing Burns to break
his contract.
The tribunal, under Lord Ranald McLean, is due to come to a decision
after hearing evidence from both parties, but Celtic's latest threat was
discussed yesterday by the SFA's executive committee during a five-hour
meeting in Glasgow.
Later, SFA deputy chief executive Bill Richardson confirmed that the
matter had been considered, but added: ''We would want to contact both
clubs and the members of the tribunal before making public the views of
the committee.''
Meanwhile, Tom Boyd will miss the Scottish Cup fourth-round tie
against Meadowbank or Berwick on Saturday, February 18, and the premier
division visit to Hearts a week later after receiving a two-match ban.

THE servants who once lived and worked in some of Glasgow's grander
Victorian mansions would barely recognise their old quarters today.
The staff who once dusted and polished at No.11 Beaconsfield Road, in
the West End, certainly wouldn't know their former mews accomodation.
They would surely feel at home, however.
No one could visit this charming mews building at the back of the main

just what can be done to a neglected outhouse with a little thought and
an eye for style.
There is even a positive advantage to being ''round the back'' of the
main villa when privacy and a self-contained cottage are the price to
pay for a humble position in life.
It also means an adjacent garage large enough to house two cars, and
room left over for storage, an extra that few West End flats can enjoy.
But the real charm of this mews home is in the way it has been
converted, and that's the achievement of Elaine and Alex Selkirk. Thanks
to Elaine's eye for decoration and the fact that Alex is an
architectural designer, their home is full of character and inspiration.
The ground floor is open-plan, but a small vestibule has been created
with a partitioning wall that has been set with two old stained-glass
panels.
''My mother in law was getting rid of them,'' says Elaine. ''We
rescued them and carried them around for years till we moved here and
decided this was just the right spot for them.''
The pretty wallpaper in the vestibule is carried round to the kitchen
area above natural wood cupboards and cream worktops. Beneath are an
integrated fridge and dishwasher with a hob and separate oven. The
washing machine is plumbed into the garage out of the way.
The kitchen floor is covered in terracotta tiles. A sofa acts as a
divider between the kitchen and sitting room while cream carpet takes
over from tiles. The wooden varnished stairs lead up from one corner of
the room leaving a useful area beneath for tidying away the sound
system.
A window in the kitchen, two windows to the side of the main room
looking on to the courtyard, and another on the stair give plenty of
light. A combination boiler supplies the central heating.
Passing beneath the head of a large stag called Hector, the steps lead
up to a very spacious bedroom which has been created by knocking two
rooms into one. Here the decoration is simple but stunning, and Elaine
has used dark green beneath.
The colours are picked up in her Black Watch tartan curtains and bed
valance. Matching tartan curtains cover a large walk-in recessed
wardrobe, while the cream carpet is echoed in the paintwork of the
timber boarding beneath the two windows.
The carpet has been continued across the landing, where there is room
to stand a chest of drawers, and into the beautiful bathroom.
To save on valuable space and make room for a bidet, the Selkirks have
fitted a ''shower tub''. Set in a conventional tiled shower cubicle, it
has a sit-up bath instead of a full-length one with Victorian-style
shower at one end.
Gleaming white tiles with a patterned tiled frieze contrast with a
pretty print paper. The white classic suite sits alongside more full
length tartan curtains. ''We wanted to keep the decoration in sympathy
with the period of the house without being to heavy or dark,'' says
Elaine.
They have certainly managed this tricky balancing act to perfection.

ONCE upon a time fairy tales were how we learnt about life. You learnt
by the example of Cinderella and her ugly sisters how to behave and what
to expect. The idea was: be good and your prince will come. Be wicked,
and you would shrivel up and be forced to live in Basingstoke. Of
course, as we grew up we started to suss that the good did not always
end happily and the bad had a dispiriting way of reaching their first
million in the fast lane.
So what has Lindsay Kemp's version of Cinderella got to teach us?
Wondrous, painful things aplenty, served up with such rampant
imagination and flair that one leaves the theatre as lit up as
Cinderella's magic shoes.
Kemp has looked at the familiar tale and he has woven into it some of
the darker elements of not just the nineteenth century (where it is
located) but of our own times. The tropical colony where Cinderella is
born is a hotbed of racial prejudice, material greed, tyrannical
excesses, and prodigal decadence. Cinderella herself is born of a white
father and a black mother who dies just as the child takes her first
breath. Neglected by her father, abused by her sisters, the child grows
into a pale, feral creature who has never known love or kindness. Little
wonder, then, that she mistakes wealth and power for happiness.
While her dead mother exerts voodoo charms to guide Cinderella to a
happy ending, another mother -- the dowager empress -- is looking for a
wife to prise her son away from his bower of boys and other aberrations.
This headlong collision of brittle, wilful, misguided people
precipitates all kinds of believable horror: revolution, slaughter,
violence, and betrayal. What else can one expect from a material world?
All this is presented in images that pulse with dark, exotic
undercurrents of voodoo culture, gothic horror and -- this being Kemp --
outrageous camp. Carlos Miranda's sumptuous score sends shimmering
atmospheres coursing through scene after scene while Nuria Moreno is a
pearlescent, predatory innocent who, in a well-judged quirk of
story-telling, finds her destiny in nursing Kemp's monstrous Prince.

ELECTRICAL cables stockist and distributor GET is planning to make its
market debut towards the end of this month.
Yesterday its management were in Glasgow for a meeting with
stockbroker Greig Middleton.
The planned flotation -- to raise #5.7m -- will enable the company to
invest further in the development and introduction of complementary
product ranges and to enhance customer support systems.
It is expected GET will be capitalised at #20m.
Founded by chairman John Joseph and his father in 1955 as Great
Eastern Trading, the company has grown steadily in recent years.
It distributes high-quality electrical products to 2600 outlets in the
UK and Republic of Ireland from its national distribution centre in
Birmingham and satellite depots in Glasgow, Newcastle and London.
GET made a pre-tax profit of more than #2m in the year to end August
on turnover up 17% to #33m. The company has achieved an average compound
growth rate in turnover of 9% since 1991.

BRITISH Industry faces an enormous task in increasing its share of the
export market, according to a report from from the Confederation of
British Industry prepared by Ernst &amp; Young.
The aim is to wind an extra 1% of trade from the major manufacturing
countries by the year 2000. But the report, Winning the Export Race,
concludes that, while the European market has grown significantly,
efforts must be focused on fast-growing new markets, especially in the
Asia Pacific economies, if UK companies want to make up some ground.
Douglas Fairbairn, Ernst &amp; Young's managing partner in Glasgow, said:
''The US, Germany and Japan are laps ahead of the rest of the export
race. Fundamental change in the way UK businesses approach international
markets is needed if they want to remain competitive and step up the
pace.''
He added: ''By the year 2020, many successful businesses will have
more customers and more employees in today's developing countries than
in developed ones. If companies in Scotland don't want to be left behind
at the starting blocks, they should sit up and take notice of the need
to change tactics.''
Lex Gold, director of the CBI Scotland, said: ''The circumstances have
rarely been more favourable for more Scottish firms to reap the benfits
of wider world markets. We already export more per head than the rest of
the UK, and we need to re-double our efforts if we are to stay ahead of
the international competition.''
Among recommendations put forward in the report, it suggests the UK
should increase its market share in developing countries and target the
fast-growing markets of Asia Pacific, also that UK companies need to
produce high-quality products to satisfy the domestic market and prevent
new competitors ''eating our lunch''.
The report says industry should take the initiative and develop
strategies for opening, developing and consolidating new markets. It
must continually transform operations to achieve and maintain market
dominant levels of operational competitiveness.
It also says greater attention to the issues associated with
marketing, selling and after sales support is needed. These include
market understanding, setting up aggressive targets and working in the
customer's language. Government should aim for an open trading system
and provide a level of support to business at least as good as that
enjoyed by competitors.
Copies of the study can be obtained from the CBI, priced at #10 for
members, #20 for non-members.

DEAN Robertson must hope, and perhaps expect, not to have to wait as
long as Santiago Luna before he achieves his victory breakthrough.
Joint fourth in Madeira, as Andrew Coltart was by coincidence the week
before in Manila, certainly represents an optimistic start to the
Cochrane Castle golfer's Tour career.
A prize of more than #9000 was a most rewarding way to wet this
professional tournament infant's head. If memory serves, in the 1962 Los
Angeles Open, Jack Nicklaus made his first professional appearance and
earned $33.33. And whatever happened to him?
There is no doubting Robertson's commitment to the furtherance of his
career or his application to ensuring that he makes a success of it. As
to his competitive strength, that was emphasised in the final round on
Sunday -- four birdies in the first seven holes and then, after two
bogeys, nine successive pars, more than one saved by his short game.
It is not difficult to foresee the former Walker Cup player and
Scottish amateur champion earning a handsome living around the
tournament circuits of the world. If he lacks the physical dimensions of
most of the present leading players -- think of the presence of
Montgomerie, Norman, Price, and Couples, for example -- good gear is
often contained in small bulk.
Not many would have placed a bet that, after the first three
tournaments of the 1995 PGA European Tour's programme, the score would
read: ''Fred Couples -- a non-member -- two, Luna -- until now a non
winner -- one. The odds against such an outcome would surely have been
astronomical.
The absence of any of the Tour's major championship and order-of-merit
winners might suggest that the Madeira Island Open merely presented the
opportunity for the mice to play while the cats were away. But that will
largely be the way of it until the Tour makes its landfall in England in
May.
On Sunday, the final groups were not exactly overflowing with
household names, such as they were in Dubai and the Philippines. But
then with prize money of #250,000 compared with #450,000 and #600,000
and not the slightest chance of persuasive inducements being dangled, no
other development was possible.
Anyway, there is much to be said for giving the opportunity to
players, who would seldom have it otherwise, to experience the pressures
of being in contention. The usual learning process for a professional's
victory is to have known the disappointment of defeat.
It also contributes towards stirring the pot in the order of merit and
the Ryder Cup points tables. Of course, there are many tournaments
counting towards both lists with much richer prize funds still to come,
and by the time the spring and summer tournaments are decided the
present standings will be drastically altered.
Still, Luna's first victory has placed him fifth in the merit table
and has promoted him from forty-sixth in the contest for European team
placings into the first 20. If Luna were to disappear without trace
no-one would probably be less surprised than the player himself.
If nothing else, Luna has enjoyed the moment of glory he has pursued
for more than a decade, and that should also be a source of
encouragement to those like him who have struggled fruitlessly for a
success to put against their name.
The ability of more and more players to win events will not make the
task of Robertson, or anyone else, the easier. Admittedly, Couples' two
intrusions were far from typical, but the argument could be sustained
that two of the first three tournaments this winter have produced
first-time winners -- and last year there were seven of them.

DESPITE the interest rate rises and economic uncertainty, one Scottish
household in every ten intends to move home this year. And one out of
every five has plans to flit within the next three years, according to a
MORI poll carried out on behalf of Abbey National. If those people turn
their words into action it will mean good news for house sellers, estate
agents and builders.
The survey was designed to assess the views of the public on whether
they intend to move house, why they move, and how much they will need to
borrow to buy their home.
The results make pleasant reading for anyone thinking of putting a
three-bedroom home on the market, for almost half of those who intend to
make a move this year say that they will be looking for a home of that
size.
While welcoming the news, Scotland's leading estate agents reacted
with caution. ''Many people have aspirations to move, but converting
that aspiration into reality can be difficult,'' says Colvil Johnston of
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison.
Ian Robb of the Robb Agency said that improvement in the market would
continue to be steady, rather than dramatic. ''The results of this
survey have to be good news. The first half of the Nineties showed us
that a lot of people have simply decided not to make a move. But the
next 24 months should be very interesting for the market.
''There will have to be an Election, and before you get an Election
you get electioneering, which means that there will probably be
incentives to encourage activity in the property market.''
The survey lends credence to the theory that there is a pent-up demand
underlying the market. For the last three or four years many people who
needed to make a move have been choosing to sit out the recession in
their current accommodation.
Some 26% of all of those questioned (and nearly half of those aged
under 45) said that they are moving because they want more space, but
while younger people are looking for larger houses, their parents and
grandparents are seeking to trade down.
More than half of those in the 55 to 64 age group want something
smaller next time.
''If your kids are growing bigger, or if your mother-in-law is going
to move in with you, then you'll need a larger house,'' says estate
agent Roy Slater. ''Similarly, if your kids decide to back-pack to
Afghanistan for a few years, then you might need something smaller.
''These changes take place all the time in people's lives, but for the
last four years people have not changed their house to suit a change in
their family needs. Maybe they are going to make a move at last.''
Other reasons given in the survey for flitting include the desire for
a ''better area'' -- cited by 12%, a change in their job -- quoted by
11%.
The poll reveals that moving intentions and size of next home are
virtually the same throughout the UK, but there are regional differences
in the amount that people intend to pay for their new home.
The average price which potential movers expected to pay was #72,000,
with average borrowings of #49,800 required to fund the purchase. In
Scotland and the North of England people expected to pay an average of
#58,600 for their next house, and to borrow #43,800 of that sum.
The message of the recession seems to have been taken to heart by many
people. More than two-thirds of those surveyed said that a house was
primarily a home, rather than an investment.
''This realistic attitude is good news,'' says Roy Slater. ''In the
late Eighties capital accumulation became all-important and it soured
the whole property market. I'm hoping we're getting back to the kind of
market we had in the early Eighties, when people moved when they needed
to rather than for investment purposes.''
Despite the recent rises, Abbey National claims that current interest
rates make houses more affordable than at any time since 1970 (the
survey was carried out prior to last week's interest rate rise).
Purchasers seem to agree, and some 64% of those questioned believe that
this is a good time to buy a house.
Charles Toner, managing director of the Abbey National's retail
division, said: ''Although many of these same people appear cautious
about whether the recession has ended or not, this is not having a
noticeable effect on their desire to move house. Abbey National remains
convinced that we will see a slow, steady and sustainable recovery in
the housing market.''
Almost half (45%) of those questioned predicted that house prices
would rise this year, while 40% think they will stay the same and 6%
predict a fall in values. Interestingly, people in the South were
generally more optimistic than the rest of us.
Of those who thought that prices would rise, the average estimate was
by some 4.5%. Margaret Schwarz, chief economist at the Abbey National,
believes that they are being only slightly optimistic -- her prediction
is for a 4% rise in values over the next 12 months.
While almost four out of ten potential movers favour a three-bedroom
house, other popular choices include: a flat (18%), a two-bedroom house
(15%), and a four bedroom house (14%). One in ten movers fancied a
bungalow, while only one in a hundred was looking for a five-bedroom
house. Around 2% were contemplating a move into a bed-sit.
Of course, not all of those moving will purchase a home. Some 14%
intend to move within the public sector rental stock, while another 18%
of the movers will rent from a private landlord.
Charles Toner summed up thus:''The survey shows steady progress in the
housing market, with most customers buying for family reasons rather
than as an investment.''

JUST when we were thinking that Paisley's claim of four weeks ago to
have a view that few other courses can rival was being ignored,
Tobermory Golf Club on the island of Mull have risen to the bait.
Club president Derek McAdam was not, however, challenging the total of
nine counties which can be seen from various parts of the mainland
course, preferring to concentrate on the breathtaking ruggedness of the
Hebridean vistas.
''We enjoyed the article on Paisley so much that a few of us are
planning a trip to the 'smoke' to try the challenge,'' he said. ''If
there is to be a beauty competition for golf courses, though, we are
keen to put forward our own stunning, hill-top course.''
The president puts his case thus: ''Our photograph shows the view from
the third green looking eastwards across Tobermory Bay, Calve Island,
and the Sound of Mull.
''The wooded hill in the right background rises from the shores of
Aros Park, and beyond are the hills around Glen Forsa on Mull. In the
left background, beyond the yachts, are the beautiful hills of Morvern.
''From the sixth green the view north is of Loch Sunart and Ben Hiant
on Ardnamurchan, with the hills of the 'cocktail islands' of Rhum, Eigg,
and Muck in the distance.''
Could he not see the Cuillins as well, as a map of the area might
suggest? ''No, Ardnamurchan's in the way . . . but a very tall man on
tiptoes might catch a glimpse of the highest peaks,'' he said.
Still, the description almost makes you want to pick up your clubs and
set off to lift your head, which is what the 150 members who pay just
#60 a year in subs seemingly tend to do.
Not once in the club's history has the par of 64 for two laps of the
2445-yard course been equalled, and the lowest handicap is six.
The current record of 65 was set in July by local schoolteacher Graham
Davidson, while GP Dr Jennifer Jack's 72 of three years ago is the
women's best.
For anyone wishing to make a bid, the best occasion is the annual
36-hole open competition for the Caledonian MacBrayne Cup, on August 5
and 6 this year. The solid silver trophy was put up in 1933 when the
existing course was established. The club itself celebrates its
centenary next year.
Access to the course is not as prohibitive as one might think. From
Glasgow, for example, it would involve some two-and-a-half hours by road
to Oban, a 40-minute ferry journey to Craignure (where the island's
other nine-hole course is located), and a further 20 minutes by road.
The main centenary project is to build an extension to the clubhouse
which was built in a new location only four years ago, bringing
electricity to the club for the first time. The cliff-top road to the
old clubhouse had become dangerous.
The club's first full-time greenkeeper, John Wilshire, was appointed
two years ago, and with the help of a grant from the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club, new equipment has been purchased. More tees and trolley paths
also have been introduced.
McAdam concluded: ''Tobermory golf course does not claim to be the
most beautiful in Scotland, but we believe it compares favourably to any
other in the world. If there is to be a beauty contest our course will
don its bikini or evening dress and parade its charms for inspection by
anyone.''
Further claims for the best or most extensive view, with pictorial
evidence, are welcome.

Ross Finlay enjoys a cheering experience when he gets behind the wheel
of a Fiat Cinquecento Sporting.
FIAT usually does well with the smallest cars in its range. The
Cinquecento, designed by Italians and built in Poland, is assembled in
the only factory I have heard of for a while which sometimes -- because
of the pressure of orders -- has to work at more than 100% of its
planned production capacity.
But if Fiat designers like making a small town runabout, they get
noticeably friskier when somebody says: ''How about tweaking it up?''
Hence the Cinquecento Sporting.
There were three choices of exterior colour to pick from when it came
to selecting a test car. And I can tell you that if, for a very
reasonable price, you want to have people staring after you as you whizz
by, a bright yellow Cinquecento Sporting is the absolute jinkies.
To recap on the Cinquecento body style, this is a very short hatchback
with minimal overhangs front and rear. The Sporting has a different
front air dam treatment and chunkier four-spoke alloy wheels. The high
stance means that headroom is fine, and also that, if the front seat
passengers play the game, there is very reasonable room for four people
on shorter trips.
The Sporting comes with stripey upholstery on its more supportive
front seats, a modest amount of concealing trim on the body-colour inner
panels, and those simple but clever Cinquecento door pulls combined with
elbow rests.
Instruments are neat, and there is a three-deck central console design
you also see in other Fiats. A small-diameter padded steering wheel is
fitted. There is an unexpected amount of shelf and door pocket space,
and the specification includes that currently fashionable piece of
equipment, a central picnic cup recess. Electric front window lifts are
standard.
Cinquecento prices start at #5254 for the basic runabout. The Sporting
comes at #6194, and it is substantially more powerful, being fitted with
an 1108cc low-emission engine from Fiat's FIRE range. This peaks at
54bhp, which is no earth-shattering figure but gives a very lively power
to weight ratio.
Despite the more powerful engine, and some extra weight, steady speed
fuel consumption is controlled by the fact that the tuned version has
different gearing. The Sporting's 60mpg at 56mph at 44 at 75 are
identical to the standard car's. At 37mpg, however, it is less
economical around town.
Some people will just putter around in a Cinquecento Sporting --
perhaps 1% of the total ownership. But the whole point of this little
car is that, while the basic Cinquecento is fine for slotting into
narrow traffic gaps, the Sporting will do that a lot more smartly, and
is totally different out on winding country lanes. The rev counter is
red-lined at 6000rpm, a speed to which the engine whisks with no bother
at all. It takes the car to 60mph in about 14 seconds, goes on to a test
track top speed in the middle 90s, and will zap to 70mph with two rather
clonky gear changes still to go in the five-speed box.
Manoeuvrability is excellent, and handling is the Sporting's strongest
suit. It will dart around exactly where you want it, with a chirrup of
wheelspin if you overdo things with the throttle from a standing start
or away from junctions. I took it on some hill roads which had patches
of ice around, and it was always safe and controllable, although I admit
coming down to lower ice-free levels pretty soon.
The tuned car has a sporting but not obtrusive engine note. You have
to make allowances for the very short wheelbase and low profile tyres
when considering ride quality on bumpy roads, but this is much better
than in earlier sporting minis.
There will be people who simply do not understand the point of a
sporty version of a basic runabout like the Cinquecento. To the rest of
us, this instant anti-depressant should be available on the NHS.

A BACKLASH was reported yesterday against the decision of the German
government in Bonn to ease restrictions on British beef imports which
were introduced at the height of the scare over ''mad-cow disease''.
Meat processors and distributors in two German states have decided to
boycott British beef because they still fear it could be contaminated
with BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy).
Agriculture ministers in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia
said that farmers, restaurant owners, and major retail chains had
combined to support the ban, according to a report from Reuter.
Federal Health Minister Horst Seehofer, who has been widely criticised
for implementing the EU guidelines on BSE and ruling that beef from
British cattle born after January 1, 1992, could be sold again, will
make a statement in parliament tomorrow(Thursday).
Mr George Lyon, health and animal welfare convener for the National
Farmers' Union, Scotland, condemned the boycott last night and called on
the British Government to ensure that the terms of the most recent
Brussels agreement, allowing the resumption of exports, be implemented.
At the Scottish Office, a spokesman said that by implementing the new
regulations the European Commission was accepting that British beef was
perfectly safe to eat. It was for the German government to enforce these
regulations. It was appreciated that the decisions of the Lander created
problems for the Bonn government.
In an attempt to reassure public opinion in Germany, the Meat and
Livestock Commission has brought German scientists to Britain to study
scientific data on BSE, and they have accepted the case which has been
put to them.
Mr Thomas Schlier of Germany's Consumer Association said that British
beef posed little risk, although there was no such thing as absolute
safety.

INSPIRATION for creating your dream kitchen abounds -- in fact, you
are likely to be overwhelmed by exciting styles and ideas. Kitchen
design expert Rosa Kerr, whose company specialises in advising
manufacturers on interior design trends, provides some tips to help you
choose the kind of kitchen which will suit your tastes and lifestyle.
''There's never been a better time for experimenting with interior
design -- there are so many companies vying with each other in an
intensely competitive market,'' she said. ''Homeowners benefit by having
a huge range of kitchen designs and finishes to choose from, at value
for money prices.''
She points out that designing and equipping a new kitchen requires
careful thought. ''Creating an interior design for any room in the home
involves the consideration of size and proportions; the available light;
the range of textures, colours and patterns which appeal to you most;
your budget and the tastes of the people with whom you share your life.
Other factors must be taken into account as well, so that you arrive at
a home which is not only practical and efficient, but also comfortable
and sympathetic -- particularly to you. When you design a kitchen, in
addition to all of these other factors, you must also choose materials
which will withstand heat, water and grease, and will go on looking
good.''
Keen cooks will probably want the cooking equipment and food
preparation areas at the heart of as spacious a kitchen as possible. If
your culinary efforts are limited to speedily thawing and heating
pre-cooked convenience foods in a microwave, then a very efficient,
basic kitchen can be fitted in a space not much bigger than a walk-in
cupboard. ''But commuter cooks without culinary skills or aspirations
often want a comfortable country-style kitchen, and expert chefs are
often happiest in a very plain, small, superbly designed working
kitchen,'' Rosa said. ''Decide how important cooking itself is to you,
and also which kind of kitchen will feel most comfortable to work or eat
in.''
If you don't cook, but want a farmhouse-style kitchen, don't waste
money having a large old-fashioned iron stove throwing out steady warmth
all day when no-one is at home. Instead, have an efficient central
heating system which gets the kitchen cosy fast, and recreate the
atmosphere with a huge central pine or oak table, a dresser displaying
blue and white china and a sunny space where the cat can sleep beside
the geraniums on the window sill.
If cooking is your pleasure, consider a central island workstation
with a cooker top and chopping board. The island could also incorporate
plenty of storage space for pots and pans, a wine rack, and a handy
rubbish bin with a door flap. Modular ranges of kitchen units offer many
options, from the usual floor and wall units to finishing touches like
space-filling shelves and plinths, so that it is possible to put
together a customised kitchen which suits of the individual requirements
of the room and the household.
A small working kitchen looks great with white laminated surfaces and
beech edges and handles, which give a clean, sharp look. A stove and
refrigerator will fit snugly into built-in cupboards. Open, easy-access
adjustable shelves instead of closed wall cupboards can display
decorative storage jars and tableware. Everything can be stored within
arms reach for the busy cook, and the result is a warm and welcoming
workplace, rather than a cluttered mess.
Cupboard doors hide unsightly bulky items at a lower level, and the
floor unit plinths, which are usually no more than a decorative panel,
can be heightened and deepened to house drawers and trays for storing
less frequently used items. Smallbone produce a range of unfitted
kitchen pieces, each designed for a specific task, including pastry
dressers, apothecary drawers and corner ovens. Each piece is
individually hand-made from ash placed alongside maple, together with
Cornish granites, stainless steel and painted wood. Gleaming white clay
butler sinks are roomy enought to accomodate the largest of pans. Hand
made willow baskets provide dark and airy storage, ideal for root
vegetables.
''As the concept of the fitted kitchen has become dominant, with its
emphasis on long, unbroken worktops, it is easy to forget that kitchen
tables provide useful worksurfaces,'' Rosa commented. ''They also have
the advantage of doubling up for casual dining once the meal is cooked.
A scrubbed pine farmhouse table is an ideal work space for baking, and
can have an array of cooking equipment suspended within arms reach.
Bleached over its years of use as an additional working surface, the
table will give a traditional air to the most modern hi-tech kitchen --
just choose a large stove and refrigerator if you want to emphasise the
country style.''
A keen cook's kitchen is designed so that family and friends can be
fed vast quantities of delicious food with the minimum of fuss and
clutter. Gadgets, pots, pans and utensils line every available surface,
ready to be put to work. The kettle, scales, food processor, bread
slicer and coffee maker are always close at hand. Open, easy-access
shelves line the room, so there's no need to rummage frantically through
cupboards. Remember to leave lots of worktop space around the cooker.
Many reputable kitchen manufacturing and installation companies offer
a free interior design service, and will help you keep track of all
practical considerations when choosing your dream kitchen.

FOR SOME of the country's medical and veterinary researchers, there
are fears that the fervour generated by the current veal debate will
spill over into the anti-vivisection argument and create an upsurge in
terrorist activity.
Mr Nic Riggulsford, director of the Research for Health Charities
Group, is concerned that radical animal rights groups who employ terror
tactics will take advantage of public support for the issue.
''They have managed to catch up a group of members of the public who
have become involved for the first time -- these are the peaceful
protesters. Now we are suddenly seeing young people in balaclavas
occupying houses,'' he says.
''These are full-time agitators who do not care about animal welfare
at all. They are much more involved in hating humans. We have had
researchers sent live bombs -- people whose only crime is to save the
lives of animals and humans dying of terrible diseases by using tissue
culture, computer modelling, and a small amount of animal
experimentation.''
Compared with the live export of animals, this is a much more complex
issue.
On the one hand you have activists who believe that all species have
equal rights -- that on the scale of rights a dog is a monkey, is a boy,
is a rat.
On the other, you have people like Steve Fleming, a diabetes sufferer
and trained scientist who campaigns on behalf of the group Seriously Ill
for Medical Research. He was nine years old when his diabetes was
diagnosed and he realised he would have to inject himself with insulin
for the rest of his life. He was larking about in hospital, he says,
when a nurse asked him: ''Do you really think you are worth 400 dogs?''
''I felt quite guilty, but then I realised that there were 10 million
other people with diabetes who had been saved by this research. I think
that was a worthwhile use of 400 dogs,'' he said.
John Robins has been campaigning on behalf of Animal Concern
(Scotland), formerly the Scottish Anti-Vivisection Society, for 15
years. He does not support arson or the use of explosives but admits
that his group's biggest successes came after activists broke into a
laboratory, took video footage of experiments, and liberated animals.
He wants the Government to pass legislation banning the use of animal
experimentation for cosmetics research immediately and to allow animals
to be used in medical research for the next five years only. After that,
researchers must have found alternative research methods, or face
prosecution.
''The best an animal can do is give a medical researcher a guideline.
Animals can react totally differently from humans.''
One of the researchers at the Institute of Biomedical and Life
Sciences at Glasgow University, who asked not to be named for fear of
intimidation from activists, maintains that without animal
experimentation, modern medicine as we know it would not exist.
''We should not stop now because by doing that we would deny future
generations the benefits we might find.
''I would say that in the late 1970s we were using something like
five-and-a-half million animals a year in the UK. We are now down to
just a bit more than half of that, so there has been a big reduction,
partly because other methods have come in. Nobody is keener than
scientists to find alternatives. I do not like killing an animal -- but
if it is the only way I can answer a problem I go with it,'' he added.
He rejects the argument that computer modelling and tissue culture can
replace animal experimentation.
Ultimately the argument boils down to a question of whether the
sacrifice of some animals is outweighed by the potential health benefits
to human beings and other animals.
''If you have as an article of faith that all living things are
sacrosanct then that is the end of the argument. I think all biological
scientists have a very healthy respect for all life, but when it comes
down to it, if you have a choice between saving a human life and an
animal life then most scientists would opt for the human life.''
Not everyone would make that choice. Keith Mann, an animal rights
activist who is now serving 14 years imprisonment for terrorist
activities, told a newspaper last month that animal researchers would be
killed.
With extremist activity currently on an upsurge, fears are growing
that scientists are being deterred from entering certain areas of
research.
Steve Fleming says he knows researchers who have received letters
saying: ''I hope your kids turn blind.''
He adds: ''The reason the debate has become sterile is because we
cannot make headway with animal rights activists who believe that one
species should not exploit other species for their own gain. But the
fact is that we do exploit our environment. If you don't like being a
member of the human race, tough.''

Tonight the public consultation on the options for a National Gallery
of Scotland in Glasgow reaches Edinburgh. The meeting, at the Royal
Museum's lecture theatre, promises to be a less consensual affair than
the one in Glasgow. Undeterred, John Fowler offers a guide to the
contents of the new gallery
0
I INVITE you to a preview. Let me guide you round the new national
gallery of Scottish art. Don't be put off by the fact that it doesn't
exist. It will, and it will be in Glasgow.
Those last words are me thumbing my nose at the few diehards who want
no change in the status quo. I shouldn't be so petty, especially on the
day of a public meeting in Edinburgh to air the latest thinking. I won't
do it again.
I find it difficult to believe that now the main point of contention
-- the ill-judged proposal to close the portrait gallery in Edinburgh --
has been dropped, there should be any considered opposition. Now is the
time to look ahead.
In the heat of recent arguments one aspect has had little notice, and
yet it's the key to the whole thing. Ask this question: what will you
and I see when the pictures are hung on the walls, the statues and other
artefacts are installed, and the gallery opens its doors?
In an attempt to answer that question I've been looking at the
national collections, not only at the pictures on the walls but those
out of sight in the basements too, where thousands of works --
paintings, sculpture, works on paper -- masterpieces among them,
languish for lack of exhibition space. I've heard what Timothy Clifford,
director of the National Galleries, and his chairman, Angus Grossart,
have to say, and I've talked to Julian Spalding, director of Glasgow's
galleries, who has made the National Galleries an offer they'd be crazy
to forgo.
Here's what I hope to see.
Forget the pictures for a bit. Let's start by visiting the Mackintosh
tearooms. Not one, not two, but seven interlinking rooms, all created by
one of the great designers of the century, Charles Rennie Mackintosh.
This is the suite of dining-rooms and tearooms he created in Ingram
Street for Miss Cranston during a 12-year period in the early 1900s. In
their heyday they must have been astonishing. Yet for the last half
century they have been neglected, and finally they were ripped out and
put into store.
Their renaissance is at hand. Last week, in the depths of the old
Trinity College (the three-towered Italianate building off Park Circus)
I saw the knocked-down Ingram Street interiors. Most are stacked against
the walls like old lumber, but work has started on recreating the
so-called White Room, originally the ladies' luncheon room. The main
structure, with its big windows looking on to the street, its staircase
and gallery, is complete, though still needing a lot more than a coat of
paint.
The great lead-cased fireplace is ready to go in place -- it was
discovered last year, hidden behind a false wall in the School of Art.
Some of the delicate glasswork has disappeared and will have to be
replaced. The two gesso panels, one by Mackintosh and the other by his
wife, Margaret Macdonald, require restoration. The silver (or, more
likely, aluminium) leaf which is now known to have covered some of the
walls must be renewed.
The White Room is being assembled for the major Mackintosh exhibition
at the McLellan Galleries next year, but that leaves six rooms still to
go, including the so-called Cloister Room and the Chinese Room, a wonder
in blues and greens. The astonishing cage-like pay desk of the Chinese
Room is on show at the moment at Kelvingrove. It whets the appetite for
more.
All this and more (the Mackintosh water-colours, for example) is
available to the new gallery. ''They can have our whole major Mackintosh
collection on permanent loan,'' Spalding says.
The offer is conditional. The rooms, the whole Mackintosh collection,
and the many other items which Spalding is prepared to make available to
the national collection are subject to the proviso that the gallery is a
major presence and not just a satellite outstation. Nothing but the
best.
Clifford and Grossart came to Glasgow last month to explain current
thinking (tonight's Edinburgh meeting is part of the same process) and
in my opinion failed to dispel a feeling that the original grand design
may have been chipped away a bit. At the meeting Spalding made a plea
for the original concept, a gallery setting Scottish art in context with
history and society.
The Clifford/Grossart duo is no great shakes at public relations.
Grossart is dry, Clifford lacks the common touch. He can't help his toff
English accent -- in full flight he sounds unnervingly like Clifford
Minor of the Remove, too clever by half -- but it doesn't help to gabble
on about a Musee d'Orsay as if we all shared his intimate knowledge of
the Parisian arts scene.
But he's enthusiastic and he does make it clear that there is a great
cache of artworks crying out for display. He and Grossart seem genuinely
concerned, too, that adding yet another gallery to the Edinburgh complex
would be irrational and politically indefensible. This is a national
collection.
We should also think of the Glasgow factor. The city's offer is no
mere supplement.
''I'm saying,'' declares Spalding, ''that what the National Galleries
want they can have. They can have as many as they want.''
There is, for example, the unequalled collections of the colourists
and the Glasgow Boys to draw on. Picking out single pictures at random,
Spalding mentions Faed's Last of the Clans, Orchardson's Marriage of
Convenience, George Henry's Galloway Landscape -- all three on show at
Kelvingrove at the moment.
Visiting Kelvingrove last week, I realised that the room currently
named The Scottish Gallery is the perfect model, in a small way, for the
major Gallery of Scottish Art and History first conceived by Clifford
and his masters, and enthusiastically supported by Spalding. It's summed
up succinctly in a printed introduction to the room: ''This gallery
reflects the whole culture of the country rather than its art alone.
Items are displayed according to specific themes which our collection
can illustrate well.'' (Amen! to that for the new gallery.)
So, beside the model of the James Watt engine built by Watt himself
stands a small marble statue of Watt by the English sculptor William
Scoular. To these could be added James Lauder's dramatic oil painting
James Watt and the Steam Engine, at present inadequately displayed at
the Mound -- one of the pictures singled out by Clifford as a prime
candidate for inclusion in the new collection.
To continue the same industrial theme: the Watt statue and model
engine at Kelvingrove are seen alongside an 1818 painting by R Salmon of
a launch at Greenock, John Fleming's panoramic painting of Greenock in
the same era, showing a waterfront crowded with shipping, two fine
engineering drawings from Robert Napier's shipyard at Govan, John Knox's
The First Steamboat on the Clyde, and a magisterial painting by David
Octavius Hill (probably better known as a pioneer of photography) of the
new Glasgow and South Western Railway viaduct at Ballochmyle in
Ayrshire.
This would also be an obvious context for items from the Royal Museum
of Scotland, which -- even though preoccupied with filling its future
new building in Chambers Street, Edinburgh -- has offered to contribute
to the new gallery.
Other themes that spring to mind are landscape and history. In the
basement at the Mound I saw William McTaggart's The Coming of St Columba
-- a small boat in a wide sea. On the wall at Kelvingrove is McTaggart's
Dawn at Sea -- Homewards, a perfect companion piece. And for a
near-contemporary equivalent, what better than the Jack Yeats seascape
from 1950, all windswept blue waves, which is in the cellar at the
Gallery of Modern Art. And -- currently on show in a corridor of the
same building -- Joan Eardley's Seine Boat? The National Gallery has 15
Eardley oils, with room to show at most half a dozen. It has a pile of
Sir William Gillies works, including about 50 oils, few of them visible
to the public.
Some pictures on show in Edinburgh will move to Glasgow. Notably in
Room 11 on the Mound (up the steps and turn right) there are some giants
which could form a spectacular introduction. This is not just my whim.
They have been identified by Clifford as potential material for the
gallery of Scottish art.
Setting the scene for landscape in an international context is the
American Frederic Church's prospect of the Niagara Falls with its grand
sweep of green water, swirling river and rainbow in the misty haze, and
the Scot David Robert's rooftop view of Rome at sunset.
But the granddaddy of the lot in terms of size and impact is Wilkie's
melodramatic Sir David Baird discovering the body of the Sultaun Tippoo
Saib after the siege of Seringapatam, dominated by the scarlet-clad
general, sabre aloft, with the dead sultan lying at his feet. A tour de
force.
Pause and admire. Now walk on. See the show.

A passionate campaign against the veal trade has brought the wider
issue of animal rights to the fore, raising awkward moral, practical and
political questions. Elizabeth Buie and Kirsty Scott report.
AT 70, Bob Phipps had never taken part in a demonstration in his life
until last Thursday. Less than 24 hours after his daughter, Jill, was
crushed to death by a lorry carrying veal calves for export, he was out
at Coventry Airport trying to block the trade that had consumed, and
ultimately, ended, her life.
His motivation was clear, but the current campaign against live
exports has caught the public's imagination in a way that few, if any,
other animal rights issues have. Protesters from all walks of life are
joining the demonstrations, from grey-permed elderly ladies to
dreadlocked youths and side-slicked businessmen.
The incentives are as diverse as the hairstyles. John got involved
years ago after a dog died, in agony, in his arms. The nameless woman in
the lilac headscarf joined one protest out of curiosity last month and
was so affected by what she saw she stayed for the rest.
Behind it all: the moral arguments, the angry or anxious farmers, the
accusations of rent-a-mob tactics and misguided anthropomorphism.
Animal activists have heard it all before. What they have not come
across is such a level of public support for an animal rights cause. The
key now, they say, is to harness this unprecedented awareness and turn
it to a variety of other issues which have been troubling them,
including factory farming, vivisection, and fox hunting.
Bob Phipps is confident they can do so. Jill Phipps, 31, was a
hardline activist committed to her cause and, according to friends,
unwilling to pander to public opinion. Her father believes her death
has, ultimately, galvanised the public in a way that she probably could
not have imagined.
''It has sparked off a little bit of militantism in so many people,''
he said. ''There is a surge of support. You see it everywhere; everyone
wants to abolish the veal trade now. They are recruiting quite a lot of
people now. The general public are not aware of what goes on. This
culture of silence kept the general public from being involved.''
John Curtin, 32, is a former Animal Liberation Front activist, and an
acquaintance of Jill Phipps. He says he became involved after watching a
dog die in agony while he was living in Ireland. ''Something just
clicked in my head about the whole concept of cruelty to animals.''
He started off pouring glue into the locks on a fur shop and moved on
to hunt ''sabbing'' and laboratory raids. He has a string of
convictions.
In 12 years of activism he says he has ''seen what you are never meant
to see'', reeling off a catalogue of alleged horrors. ''The blood and
guts of an animal abuse industry. I have seen terror in their eyes.''
Somewhat perplexed by the current surge in public opinion over the
veal issue, he, like Bob Phipps, believes it can be used to turn the
spotlight on to other animal issues.
''Hopefully this is like a Pandora's box. The lid has now been opened
and it will not be closed again.
''It's been very frustrating to be an animal activist and to watch
what amounts to a holocaust all around you. Maybe it's an idea whose
time has come.''
Many activists believe the graphic photographs and films of veal units
and slaughterhouses on the Continent, which have been used in adverts
and news reports, have been the key to the current outcry.
One undercover investigator involved in recent filming followed a
lorryload of sheep to a slaughterhouse in Spain, and another vehicle
carrying veal calves to a separate destination. Much of his description
of both trips and what happened at the journey's end is too graphic for
publication.
''We watched the veal calves. They were tethered by the neck in the
crate so they could not even turn around, sit down, look back. It was
absolutely horrific,'' he said.
The man, who cannot be named, said the films had brought the
implications of the export trade home to the British public.
''It brought it into their living rooms, and with the protests, people
saw that public pressure, people power, can yield results. They have
realised that they can make a difference.''
All the mainstream activists are quick to distance themselves from the
radical splinter groups who use terror and threats in the name of animal
rights. Compassion in World Farming, which has had a high profile in the
recent live export demonstrations, says it is trying to keep the
protests peaceful and orderly. The last thing it wants is for the
campaign to be hijacked or public opinion to be soured by the fringe
element.
Scotland, meanwhile, has remained somewhat on the periphery of the
current debate following the outcry over veal flights from Prestwick and
the airport's subsequent withdrawal from the trade.
However, earlier this week activists north of the Border said they
were investigating unconfirmed reports that exporters were trying to
ship veal calves to the Continent via Stranraer. Ferry operators say
they banned such shipments months ago.
John Robins, Scottish spokesman of the pressure group Animal Concern,
said there was no reason to believe the Scottish public were any less
involved in the issue than their southern counterparts. ''There is a
general backlash among ordinary members of the public everywhere. People
are demonstrating who have never demonstrated before.''
To their critics, the activists are guilty of anthropomorphism of the
worst sort, seduced by the big brown eyes of young cattle, or the small,
furry bodies of lab rats and guinea pigs.
Dr Geoff Scobie, who teaches psychology at Glasgow University, has
studied anthropomorphism for the PDSA, looking specifically at the issue
of persuading dog owners to get their animals neutered.
''What we discovered was that both men and women were a bit reluctant.
They think of themselves going through the same experience. That's part
of what's happening in this situation. We have veal calves going through
pretty abysmal conditions and we are putting ourselves, as it were, in
this position.
''The problem with that is that we don't know what animals feel. We
are not in a position to know what they experience. I think that's
basically what's going on, because people are projecting their own
feelings and hopes on to the cows then they tend to react in a highly
emotional and charged way. That's over and above the moral question of
whether animals should be treated in this way.''
For Bob Phipps, no cause, moral or not, was worth his daughter's
death, but he hopes that the cause of animal activism generally will
profit from the Phipps's family loss.
''Let's hope she has not died in vain. It has sort of galvanised
everybody; I think people are really aware of it now, and of other
animal issues. I think, you know, we're maybe going to beat this
thing.''

ESTATE agents are calling for a government U-turn on property-related
taxation. The 10,000-member National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA)
wants the cancellation of April's reduction in MIRAS from 20% to 15%.
NAEA chief executive Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy says the Government should
follow its U-turn on the increase in VAT on fuel with a U-turn on its
present stand on MIRAS and other property-related matters.
The agents are demanding that the MIRAS ceiling should be doubled for
first-time buyers for the first five years of a new mortgage, from its
current #30,000 to #60,000. At the end of the five years, the government
could then reduce the increased benefit on a sliding scale to dampen the
effect of its removal.
The NAEA also says the Government should reconsider its proposals for
the removal of Income Support for mortgage interest payments for
homeowners who become unemployed.
Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy ads: ''Having encouraged more and more people to
become homeowners during the Thatcher years, the Government now has an
obligation to protect those very same people -- some of whom are
suffering negative equity, or even the threat of repossession. The
Government can no longer sit on the fence as homeowners suffer one blow
after another.''

Brian Henderson argues that our view of animals has been coloured by
childhood exposure to the cartoon kingdom.
I BLAME Walt Disney! After all, what's the earliest memory most
children will have of animals -- either wild or domesticated?
Is it the less-than-telegenic arrival of a new-born calf, the
inevitable dumping of a new-born lamb on a sleety morning in the hills
by a skeery gimmer, or the counting of dead piglets squashed when a gilt
decides to lie on them? No, it's the rose-tinted, pastel-painted arrival
of Bambi, Prince of the Forest, with all the other sylvan animals
arriving to pay homage in a succession of sycophantic voices.
We follow his first faltering steps and the painful progress of his
first doe-eyed words as he takes in the delights of a benign world where
man is the only threat to his existence.
Then we swallow the lumps in our throats and blink back the tears as
the forest fire catches up with his mother and she yells: ''Run Bambi,
run.''
And so the scene is set for a whole series of pseudo-encounters with
animals throughout the formative years which are as divorced from
reality as the animals of Farthing Wood.
Is it really any surprise that anthropomorphism and sentimentality
have coloured our view of the animal kingdom and become so firmly
embedded in our national psyche?
Compare this with the situation in some other EU states where
bullfighting is still a national sport or periodic burning of British
lamb can be classified as a leisure pursuit.
The picture of little calves and woolly lambs heading for a fate worse
than death on the Continent has been, in propaganda terms, a godsend to
the animal rights lobbies. Battery hens were always an issue for the
welfare lobby but the scrawny-necked fowls simply didn't have sufficient
''awh'' factor to get the general public out on the streets.
But get something with big Bambi eyes or a fluffy coat and you're
dealing with images which tag straight into the emotions, by-passing the
thought centres.
Once the blue touch paper has been lit and these emotions have been
fanned up to fever pitch in a mob, the opportunity for sensible
discussion goes out the window.
And with the media's mind already swayed by animal activists the
possibility of any reasoned public debate is remote in the extreme.
Inevitably, on top of this comes the opportunist politician, keen to
grab hold of any issue uppermost in the general public's mind and then
bend it to his own ends.
It's a black and white picture which is painted. We don't see any
pictures of calf carcases being fed to foxhounds as the result of
stress-induced pneumonia from the delays, unloading and reloading caused
by the demonstrations.
We don't hear that the sum total of animal suffering will be increased
by banning the export of UK stock -- as Eastern European countries, with
considerably less regard for the conditions and time limits on animal
transporation, step in to fill the gap.
We don't hear much about bomb threats, incendiary devices or razor
blades through the post.
But we do get plenty of footage of protesters and of a calf chained in
a veal crate and of a remarkably cool sheep peering out at the camera
lights through the slats in a float.
Being frank, though, the demonstrators may actually have some valid
points and many farmers are not completely comfortable with some aspects
of the export trade.
In fact, it would be easy as a farmer to stand up and voice support
for the ban on exports -- after all nobody goes to greater lengths than
farmers, stockmen and shepherds to care for and do the best they can by
their animals. So to think of our stock being mistreated after they
leave the farm is abhorrent in the extreme.
And, even if recently publicised court cases show that the industry as
a whole isn't 100% squeaky clean on the welfare front, I would be
willing to bet that for every incident of animals being mistreated there
are a hundred instances of their welfare being put before other
considerations such as the profit motive.
As far as hard-nosed business considerations are concerned, the
industry is far more likely to be faulted for being too soft rather than
harsh.
However, we can't just throw up our hands in surrender at the first
sign of challenge to what is a legitimate trade. Nor can we turn away
and hope the whole issue will disappear -- even though we appear to be
stuck in a no-win situation.
The consumer seldom takes his or her convictions into the supermarket
and buys on price rather than principle. Lower prices encourage cheaper
production methods and these, as a general rule, spell less considerate
means.
So we're getting two conflicting signals -- on one hand we're getting
the message that we should be going all out for welfare, while on the
other we're being told ''produce it cheaply or we'll buy elsewhere''.
The farm assurance schemes have been put forward as a possible answer
to the dilemma -- guaranteed welfare standards which will please the
consumer and a market share and level of returns which would suit the
producer.
All that needs to be done is to get the message over to both ends of
the chain and crack the chicken-and-egg situation which has dogged the
schemes for so long.
It's either that or we'll just have to pop down to the childrens'
section of the local video shop with a sharp pair of scissors!

HOW many home owners would relish the idea of returning to their
accommodation to find the three-piece suite dotted with cigarette burns
caused by a letting agent who wanted to know whether the furniture was
fire-resistant?
It's not such a silly question for, according to specialist rental
agents, the new safety regulations which govern the private rental
sector are ambiguous, and involve tests which re difflcuult to carry
out.
The Confederation of Letting Agents in Scotland (CLAS) has expressed
its concern about the way in which the new rules are being introduced.
The regulations consist of an update of the 1988 Fire &amp; Furnishings
Regulations together with the Consumer Protection Act.
Their effect is to make it an offence to ''supply'' in the course of
business any furniture to which the regulations apply, unless that
furniture meets what is known as the the ''ignitability test''. In
short, furniture and fittings have to be fire resistant.
''This is a serious problem for agents. Failure to comply is an
offence and carries a punishment of six months imprisonment or a fine
currently totalling #5000, or even both,'' says Brian Watson of The
Accommodation Company Limited (TACL).
He feels that agents are responsible for the safety of their tenants
-- and that landlords who won't comply with the new rules should be
outlawed.
TACL has taken measures to conform with the new regulations by having
fire blankets, smoke alarms and employing a full-time electrician
qualified to test electrical appliances.
Furthermore, after January 1, 1997, all furniture supplied in a
letting must comply with 1988 regulations which apply to all upholstery
and upholstered furnishings, loose fittings, permanent or loose covers,
and bedding. Curtains are exempt.
Rented accommodation is also covered by the 1989 Electricity at Work
Act. This requires people reselling or hiring out portable electrical
appliances to take adequate steps to protect the users from shock and
fire hazards.
This also poses a problem for agents, since tenants sometimes bring
their own electrical appliances into the rented home, unaware of the new
legislation. Only a thorough inventory can ensure that all appliances in
the property meet the regulations.
There is also the question of liability. Who will be held responsible
in the event of a tragedy? Members of CLAS feel that agents have a moral
responsibility to make sure their tenants are safeguarded.
''All of which may result in an increased supply of unfurnished
accommodation. People will probably want to rent out their accommodation
unfurnished,'' says John Boyle of John C Boyle Property Managers.
This way the onus is on the tenants themselves. The only
responsibility the agent has is to test the electrical equipment which
is supplied with the white goods. Renting unfurnished accommodation will
be less of a problem for letting agents, and there is not a significant
loss in finance.
Meanwhile, new gas safety regulations are much more clear cut. The
regulations, which came into force in October 1994, require landlords
for the first time to have the gas appliances in their properties
checked for safety at least once a year.
The safety check must be carried out by a competent installer
registered with the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI).
In addition CORGI installers are now required to inform both the
landlord and the tenant when a dangerous appliance has been identified.
The landlord must now show the safety checks record to the tenant, if
asked.

A NEW Perth record price of 17,000gns for a Limousin was the highlight
of the second day of the bull sales. In spite of that many breeders left
the ring in varying degrees of disappointment.
However, nothing could hide the joy of 17-year-old Matthew Jones from
Senny near Brecon in Wales at smashing the old 7500gns record. His
involvement in cattle breeding began when he was just three years old
and stemmed from the gift of two heifers from his father. Yesterday was
the first time since leaving school that he had been in Perth, though he
had previously sold bulls up to 5800gns. He said: ''I am just absolutely
thrilled.''
Buying the champion -- the October 1993 Bailea Imij by Greenson's
Gigolo -- were Archie MacGregor, Allanfauld, Kilsyth, and David Baillie,
Calla, Carnwath. Mr MacGregor said: ''He's a tremendous bull and it's
unusual to find one of such scale having these hindquarters.''
Next best at 8000gns was the first prize May 1993 Normand Iowa from
Norman Cruikshank, Cowford, Lanark, which sold to Tom Sinclair, Lyth,
Wick.
Three bulls sold at 7500gns. The first was the senior and reserve
overall champion -- the February 1993 Buick Invincible from Christine
Williams, Lodge Hill, Shifnal, Shropshire, which went to C &amp; J
Henderson, Armadale, Thurso.
At the same bid Robert Graham, Airthrey Carse, Stirling, bought the
first prize May 1993 Balfunning Ivanhoe from Jim McFarlane, Balfunning
House, Balfron, while Milton Schofied, Cheadle Wood, Cheadle, Cheshire,
was the final seller of a bull at this price when he sold his January
1993 Cheadlewood Ivanhoe to Erland Flett, Hirtuso, Holm, Orkney.
At 7200gns Keam Farms, Hopeman, Morayshire, took the second prize,
Ronick Irn Bru from David Dick, Mains of Throsk, Stirling, who had
earlier sold his class winner, Ronick Imri to W &amp; G Strachan, Mill of
Balmaud, King Edward, Banff.
Norman Cruikshank was back in the action selling at 6400gns to W J F
Ramsay, Mid Montlock, Stranraer.
Other leading prices were:
At 6000gns -- J K Goldie, Townfoot, Dumfries to G A and J D Richards,
Trendeal, Truro, Cornwall. W Mitchell and Sons, Clarkston, Doune, to
Ardconnel Farms, Dalmally, Argyll. M T Jones to the Isle of Man
Department of Agriculture.
At 5500gns -- P A Walker, Easterside, Stonehaven to Osborne Farming
Co, Balmaddies, Forfar.
At 5200gns -- Duncan MacGregor, Allanfauld, Kilsyth to Leyland and
Gold, Barmoor, Berwick-on-Tweed. J K Goldie to W McLaren, Muirhouses,
Kirriemuir.
At 5000gns -- N Cruikshank to Little Harle Farms, Kirkwhelpington,
Newcastle-on-Tyne.
At 4888gns -- J &amp; J Gammie, Drumforder, Laurencekirk to A M Common and
Sons, Skilmafilly, Ellon. P A Walker to G Westgarth, Newsham Hall,
Richmond, Yorks.
A Blonde D'Aquitaine bull from I C and J D Archer, Marston Mill,
Coventry, sold at 4200gns to Boreland Farm Co, Cockburn, Balerno,
Midlothian.
Today it is the turn of the Simmentals to come under the auctioneer's
hammer. Despite a good show of top bulls the overall standard, according
to Peter Scott who judged the classes yesterday, is ''decidedly
non-vintage''.
Mr Scott found his champion in the junior section in the shape of
Corrick Dollar from Cecil McIlwaine from Newtonstewart, County Tyrone,
who triumphed on his first attempt at Perth with one from his 14 cow
herd which he runs on 45 acres. The reserve champion was another junior
-- Linross Elliot from Bob Douglas, Linross, Forfar.

ASK anyone to name Scotland's biggest estate agents and firms like
Slater Hogg, Roy Slater, Nationwide, GA, Allen &amp; Harris will trip from
their lips. But few would guess that house builder Barratt is also one
of the biggest estate agents operating in the market at the moment.
The builder buys in thousands of older homes through its Oak Leaf
part-exchange scheme and then offers them for sale again.
In Scotland and the North of England, Barratt bought and sold around
900 older homes worth over #50m last year.
Barratt currently has a wide selection of Oak Leaf homes on offer
ranging from-one bedroom apartments to five-bedroom detached houses --
at prices from under #20,000 to more than #100,000.
The company claims that they are all for sale at low prices -- many
below valuation -- and most come complete with extras included in the
price.
They may be fully redecorated, or include cooker, fridge and washer,
or have fitted carpets.
There is a special no deposit plan for first-time buyers on selected
properties, which means they could move in for #250. Move-up buyers can
take advantage of Barratt's seven-day part exchange service.
On selected properties the builder will pay up to #1000 towards moving
expenses.
Barratt Northern Region chairman, Mike Norton, said: ''We are offering
our customers the best purchase package available if they are looking to
buy an older home.
''Some people cannot understand how we can sell so many properties --
especially if they have been trying desperately to sell their own home
for several months. The answer is simple.
''We pioneered part-exchange in the early Seventies, and since then we
have completed more than 33,000 successful deals.
Our companies have specialist departments dealing solely with
part-exchange properties.
''We have to sell quickly to keep our turnover high, so we put them up
for sale again at very competitive prices.''

DUNFERMLINE, the biggest Scottish-based building society, yesterday
reported a near-repeat of 1993's record year, with mortgage loans of
#144.4m and an 11.6% rise in assets to #906m.
Looking over last year's performance, chief executive David Smith said
the underlying performance was unlikely to be surpassed by any major
building societies given the difficult market conditions.
Pre-tax profits totalled #10.6m, virtually the same as in 1993, and
the society reiterated its commitment to the principle of mutuality
rather than any maximising of profits.
''As a form of ownership where members' interests are paramount, the
society has looked after these interests to the best of its abilities,
including heavy investment in computers, customer service programmes,
and new technology,'' Mr Smith said.
His main concern -- shared with most players in the housing market --
centred on the apparent trend of increasing interest rates, the phasing
out of tax and income support relief, and their ensuing impact on home
buyers.
''I understand the need to control inflation, but with so many in
Scotland contemplating house purchase for the first time, it would be
unfortunate, to say the least, if their aspirations were frustrated,''
he said.
Dunfermline employs around 350 people. It has just opened a #5.5m
headquarters in its home town. Total assets have increased from #170m to
#906m in the last decade.

THE run of good news continues at British Sky Broadcasting, the UK
satellite television company, with interim profits announced yesterday
at the top end of City forecasts at #55m before tax. This compares
favourably with #37.8m previously.
''By any standards this is an excellent result,'' said BSkyB's chief
executive Sam Chisholm.
Operating profits, before tax and interest payments, are now running
at more than #5m a week.
Revenues grew by a better-than-expected 48% to #356.9m with
direct-to-home (DTH) subscription revenue up 53%.
Cable subscription grew by 72%, and advertising sales revenue was 12%
higher. The company expects to recommend a final dividend.
BSkyB's programming is growing strongly, which should help underpin
future revenue growth. During the six months to end-December, it
launched three new channels: Sky Sports 2, Sky Travel and Sky Soaps.
Sky Sports continued to expand its coverage with the acquisition of
the rights to televise Scottish football matches.
Total paying subscribers rose to 3.96 million from 3.48 million in the
first half. Movie subscribers reached three million and there were 2.8
million sports subscribers.
Most Sky viewers -- it is now in more than four million homes --
subscribe via DTH satellite receivers, which account for 71% of its
subscriber base. BSkyB said more than 87% of subscribers now took at
least one premium channel.
Revenues are expected to benefit in the current year from the launch
of the Disney Channel on Sky in October. It agreed the launch of
Europe's first subscription Disney channel with Walt Disney in December.
The news supply contract announced last week between BSkyB's Sky News
channel and media group Reuters Holdings is expected to bring cost
savings of up to #10m a year, starting in the financial year beginning
in June.
City analysts put the cost of running Sky News, which employs around
300 staff, at around #27m to #30m.
Under the terms of the agreement, Reuters will supply and manage UK
and global news gathering for the Sky News Channel. Sky will retain
editorial control of its output.
The group, 40% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, was
part-floated in London and New York on December 8 in an offering that
raised about #825m. This helped strengthen the balance sheet, with total
debt at the half year-end of #925m compared with #1740m at June 30 last
year. The cost of the flotation was #8.2m.
The company is very optimistic about its future prospects given the
strong growth in subscribers over the first half of the financial year
combined with the reduction in overall debt levels.
In the second half, improvements are expected at both the operating
and pre-tax level.
News of the upbeat trading statement pushed BSkyB shares up 4p to
268p.
There is, however, some concern in the market that its share valuation
may prove difficult to sustain in the long term.

RIVAL nursing unions yesterday joined together to oppose any
Government plans to award below inflation pay increases or impose local
pay deals on health workers.
Speaking in advance of the Government's announcement on public sector
pay awards due tomorrow -- expected to be between 2% and 3% for NHS
staff -- leaders of Unison and the Royal College of Nursing said it
would lead to ''chaos and confusion'' and be a ''recipe for disaster''.
Mr Malcolm Wing, deputy head of health at Unison, said that nurses had
already made it clear that they were determined to resist the imposition
of such a divisive and unfair system.
Ms Christine Hancock, general secretary of the RCN, called for a
national framework to decide salary scales.
She emphasised that it would be ''outrageous'' to tell nurses they
could have the locally-negotiated element of their pay award only if
there were further reviews of skills or increases in productivity.
Nurses are backing hospital doctors and consultants in fighting
Government plans to allow trusts to decide pay rates locally, instead of
the Pay Review Bodies which have traditionally set national scales.
Jocelyn Prudence, staff side secretary of the Professions Allied to
Medicine, warned that local pay bargaining would cost the NHS #40m a
year in extra administration against the #500,000 for national pay
bargaining.

GATESHEAD MetroCentre, Europe's largest covered shopping complex, was
put up for sale by its Church of England owners yesterday -- with a
price tag thought to be around #300m.
The church said the sale would help resolve its severe cash crisis and
preserve clergy jobs.
It lost #800m from its #3000m assets in the 1990 slump after the
Church Commissioners, who look after investments, bought heavily in
commercial property.
Congregations were asked to put more in the collection plate each week
to cover overheads, including vicars' pay.
The MetroCentre sale is part of a restructuring of assets aimed at
cutting property investment from the present level of almost half the
church's portfolio to about 20%.
The 350-shop Tyneside complex -- said to be Britain's most profitable
retail centre -- includes three miles of tree-lined malls, a multiplex
cinema and an indoor theme park. Turnover last year was #600m from
nearly 27m visitors.
There is even a chaplain to hold services for the estimated 90,000
Sunday shoppers each weekend.
The Church Commissioners' chief surveyor, Mr Andrew Brown, said: ''We
have taken professional advice and the conclusion is that the
MetroCentre, although magnificent, is simply too large for us to hold
within the size of our property portfolio.
''It represents over 15% of the fund and that, in general terms, is
too many eggs in one basket.''
Selling agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe are courting selected investors or
consortia from around the world prepared to take out a 200-year
leasehold on the centre.
The church plans to retain 10% of the rents, worth #20m a year.
DTZ spokesman Bruce Nutman said: ''They want to keep a foothold,
because they believe there is future growth there.''
The Church Commissioners put two smaller shopping centres on the
market last year -- Marlowes in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, and
Beechwood Place in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, which was sold for #15m
last week.
The MetroCentre was built by developers Cameron Hall and the church at
a cost of #200m in 1986.

<TEXT>
STOCKBROKER Brewin Dolphin is taking a cautious view of immediate
prospects with trading so far this year quieter than last. Managing
director John Hall said January last year was so optimistic that the
market could not possibly live up to it. He is, however, expecting a
major break but voiced concerns over the uncertainty on interest rates.
The broker which came to the market last year at 150p, and closed last
night at 118p, increased pre-tax profits by 26% to #4.03m although
operating profits from trading were flat at #3.35m. That partly
reflected the heavy investment in software.
It had the benefit of a full year's contribution from Bell Lawrie
which now acounts for about a third of the group. Average staff costs at
#25,800 are scarcely in the Warburg league of the #105,000 seen in
1993-94 but have not altered significantly by way of numbers employed,
currently 418.
Mr Hall said that private clients had experienced no problems with
rolling settlement and were happy not to receive share certificates. But
he is concerned, as are they, that the private client is becoming more
separated from the company in which they invest and he is talking to the
Bank of England about this matter.

THERE is the prospect of cheaper pub beer later this year as the
Office of Fair Trading is to investigate the difference between brewers'
prices for the free trade and tied houses, writes ANDREW WILSON.
This can amount to more than #100 a barrel or about 40% off the list
price of perhaps #250 for a barrel of 288 pints.
It has put increasing pressure on tenants of the major brewers who
have to compete not only with the brewers own managed houses but, more
importantly, the increasing number of pub chains which can sell at
substantially lower prices.
The move was sparked off by the European Commission investigating a
formal complaint that tenants of the Grand Metropolitan and Fosters
Brewing joint subsidiary Inntrepreneur Estates have to buy their
supplies at full list price from the Courage brewing division of
Fosters. In contrast, free trade buyers of Courage beer pay appreciably
lower prices.
In 1993, the Commission granted exemption to Inntrepreneur from
competition rules, but it has now reconsidered its position and asked
the OFT to investigate. This will take three months, and if
director-general Sir Bryan Carsberg does decide the current differential
pricing has detrimental effects, he will either ask the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to investigate further or the brewers to give
undertakings.

A SCOTTISH-based Government agency has won part of a major contract to
help develop the Russian economy by converting factories which produced
military vehicles and weaponry during the Cold War to peace-time
applications, writes KEITH SINCLAIR.
NEL, the technology services organisation based at East Kilbride, has
been jointly awarded the #2m contract to convert about a dozen former
military plants to civilian production, with a special emphasis on oil
and gas equipment.
The 18-month project is being funded by the European Commission's
Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States
programme. This was set up to provide support to the former Soviet
Union, to foster the exchange of knowledge and expertise through
partnerships.
NEL, which will receive about 10% to 15% of the funding, was chosen
because it has developed considerable testing and analytical expertise
in oil equipment, much of which is related to the North Sea oil
industry.
The team, headed by NEL's project manager Iain Thomson, is to set up
an oil equipment certification centre. It will provide on-site training
and advice, with the aim of introducing a quality assurance programme
based on Western standards.

Managing director David Sutherland said: ''We've never had such a
healthy workload to carry forward at this stage of the year.''
More than half the new business has been generated by Tulloch's
expanding housing and property packaging divisions, in line with its
policy of moving away from highly-competitive tendering situations.

hears more opinions
on devolution, from the
people of two gritty
'Northern' cities,
as she concludes her
journey through
DISAFFECTED
LITTLE ENGLAND
BLIZZARDS and ice, later turning to slush. All journeys best avoided .
. .
Travelling through floods on the night before that forecast I had
reached Liverpool from Derby, and now here in Toxteth the snow possessed
a luminous quality making even heavy-handed Victorian terraces seem
delicate and beautiful.
All journeys best avoided . . . those words have often tapped out
warnings to strangers about Toxteth. During the early eighties, on the
eve of the Wedding of the Century, Toxteth had erupted in riots,
exposing the rank deprivation of Liverpool's ethnic minorities. Violence
had triggered other insurrection around the country and Mrs Thatcher,
unnerved by the vehement contagion, had despatched her only lionheart,
Michael Heseltine, who promised Toxteth better prospects and, with
genuine concern and finesse, set about rebuilding much of it, wooing the
community to his cause.
But for the Government the timing of the riots could not have been
more damaging as the world's media was focused on Britain for the
fairy-tale nuptials of a Prince and his child bride. Now, that marriage
itself was seething with self-destruction while here was Toxteth,
sepulchral in a milky radiance. And then, as we slithered along Granby
Street, the taxi-driver said: ''We won't stop here because some of the
locals might rush up and open the door and punch you on the nose.''
Such caution seemed too frantic for comfort: other than us there was
no sign of life on the road. Sensing contradiction, he explained rather
irritably that what I had to understand was that the recession had once
more made Toxteth a no-go neighbourhood for outsiders. Despite new
houses and reinforced old ones, there was still enough deprivation to
spill into trouble.
''This is why,'' he said, ''the police go up and down disguised as
taxi-drivers. They're on the look-out for druggies and the barons. If we
slow down and the residents see you taking notes some of the wrong
people will think we're the fuzz and that's when things get nasty.'' It
is chutzpah of sorts that any dangerous finagling takes place under the
eye of Granby Street police station anyway; a kind of urchin daring. Or
else, perhaps, the measure of careless desperation.
Every other year or so Liverpool is saddled with national and
international headlines when monstrous tragedy contorts its spirit, or
some municipal outrage telegraphs a place beyond control. Would locking
Liverpool into regional devolution help its sorry image? The cabby was
aghast: ''Tony Blair must be joking if he thinks that would work in
Liverpool. As it is, we haven't a good record of councils getting their
act together for the benefit of the masses. They either cock it up or
rip us off. And the thought of being lumped in with Manchester, well
that's piling insults on injuries.''
Now we were driving back towards the city centre, sliding through
Chinatown which has shrunk to a few dozen eating houses, with doors
brightly painted and profitable tariffs. As we turned a corner from the
Blackie, a forsaken church converted to commmunity hall, a cream
Rolls-Royce purred before us, looking ridiculously over-dressed and
out-of-scale beside rows of little red-brick houses. Surrounding cars
edged up on the kerb to let the vehicle by as if royalty were passing.
''That's the owner of one of the Chinese restaurants,'' said the
driver. ''They don't go short but they don't get it for nothing. Like
the Asian shopkeepers, they work bloody hard.''
Bad news of a terrible kind last hit Liverpool with the murder of baby
James Bolger. The previous year a garbage strike had brought critical
attention to its battered door. Before that there had been Derek Hatton,
the demon prince of militancy and now reborn towards the Right but still
with his daily haircuts, bright, fidgety eyes, and the swank of
expensive bad-taste tailoring.
Further back there were the ugly dock strikes of the sixties, then
Toxteth, then Heysel and Hillsborough and the football mayhem engulfing
Liverpool fans. An unpromising litany which had brought the unforgiven
wrath of Murdoch's newspapers down on the city, and which had fixed in
the minds of many observers a belief that Liverpool deserved its woes.
But more than that, there was a suspicion that Liverpool cherished
calamity like some ruinous drug lending fitful ecstasy to the grotesque.
During my first evening here I spoke to a group of Liverpool business
people in the cocktail bar of the Atlantic Tower. Of the four, only one
lived in the city. The others had homes in Cheshire at a tasteful
distance from Liverpool's troublesome reputation. Yet each of them loved
the place, its ridiculous swank, its volatile opinion of itself, its
irrepressible humour rammed into the po face of disgust.
''The fact is that Liverpool for some mysterious, genetic reason has
always seen itself as a city state,'' said the lawyer. ''It always goes
its own way, and when it is not making much of a fist of it, it thinks
the world's against it.'' Like the taxi-driver, he couldn't see anything
to be gained by giving Liverpool more control over its affairs. ''It's
too late for that.''
A local journalist elaborated: ''The middle class have washed their
hands of the city and that always makes for instability. They work here
but they don't even come to shop in Liverpool any more. Instead, they go
to Chester or Manchester. I know the end will have come for respectable
Liverpool when George Henry Lee (Liverpool's equivalent of Jenners),
finally pulls down the shutters. It must be one of the few department
stores left in the country where you can still order name-tapes for
school uniforms.''
This feeling that Liverpool is on the wrong side of progress begins at
its port where there has been a grievous decline in westward freight and
passenger traffic. The Albert Dock development -- the area where the
Tate Gallery has put down northern roots -- is a lively, ambitious
scheme which aims to foster the affluent notion of shopping as a hobby.
But business in the boutiques and cafes is slow even on those days when
the wind off the water doesn't carry blades of Siberia in it. ''If I
hear the Government say once more that this recession is over I'll
emigrate,'' said one retailer.
The Tate bustles, though, and folk are proud it chose to make its home
by the Mersey. ''If it had gone to Manchester I'd have really felt
betrayed,'' said one of the attendants. ''Manchester is far too uppity
for its own good. If we had a regional assembly Manchester would just
corner all the action and Liverpool would still be elbowed into the
cold.''
Persistent loggerheads, then, will put the kybosh on any attempt to
expoit the North-west as a cohesive region. If it happens at all
Liverpool will still dangle psychologically and physically on the
periphery. Perhaps it has always known this and hence the obstinate,
to-hell-with-it swagger of its walk.
If any building symbolises those circumstances it is the Adelphi
Hotel, its grandiose Victoriana now mocked by placards declaring rooms
from #12. Once a monument to worldly trading, the Adelphi was designed
to accommodate first-class transatlantic travellers from the great
Cunarders. It lost that business almost immediately when the luxury
trade shifted to Southampton. In his English Journey of 1933, J B
Priestley wrote that it had been ''hot from shame and vexation ever
since''. That night the BBC transmitted Question Time from Liverpool.
Private Clegg, Clause 4, the Holocaust, Cantona . . . these were the
subjects which preoccupied its citizens. There was not so much as a
squeak about English devolution.
People will tell you that Liverpool revels in hollow-cheeked defeatism
and a cloying sentimentality which seems to make one heartbreak a
rehearsal for the next. But at the Tate a commissionaire reminded me
that it was in the blood of the place, in the exotic mishmash of a
seaport's races, to be extravant in comedy and sorry. Liverpool's
detractors might hit out at that, but what its own people had gained
from such responses was the gift of common caring.
Liverpool might indeed sob that it has been systematically kicked in
the kidneys and it hurt, but that wouldn't stop a remarkable city from
staggering to its feet again, and finding a cure in a fast joke.

A FIGHT over three bottles of beer led to the deaths of two young
friends, the High Court in Glasgow was told yesterday.
Andrew Brown, 17, who stabbed the two 20-year-olds, was ordered to be
detained without limit of time. Brown, of Staffa Street, Gourock, who
was 16 when he committed the crimes last October, was found guilty after
a four-day trial.
He was convicted of murdering Mr Brian Roberton, of Albert Road,
Gourock, but the jury found him guilty of the lesser charge of culpable
homicide of Mr Stuart Gray, of Mathie Crescent, Gourock.
Brown, 17, is one of the youngest men to have been sentenced for a
double killing in Scotland. Lord McCluskey ordered him to be detained
without limit of time for the murder and for six years for the culpable
homicide.
Referring to the culpable homicide verdict, the Judge said that, while
the jury held he had no murderous intent when he killed Mr Gray, he
acted with a ''cruel excess''.
Earlier, the court heard how Brown used a 6in-long butcher's boning
knife to stab the two men who died in hospital.
Brown did not deny the killings but in a special defence claimed it
was not murder because he was defending his friend, 17-year-old Richard
Paton, of Burns Road, Greenock, from a potentially lethal attack by Mr
Robertson and Mr Gray.
His defence counsel, Mr Donald Findlay, QC, said that just before they
died the two victims had launched a ''cowardly and violent'' attack on
Paton, raining kicks and punches on him which could have caused his
death.
Mr Findlay said: ''This young man saved the life of his friend. While
he might be physically responsible for two deaths, he is not legally
responsible. Whether he is convicted of murder, culpable homicide, or
acquitted, he will have to live with what he did for the rest of his
life.''
Mr Colin Boyd, prosecuting, told the jury that what Brown did was
completely out of context for a ''scrap'' between two boys. Mr Boyd said
the teenager had used ''cruel excess'' and had gone too far.
The court heard how 30 to 40 Gourock teenagers, some as young as 13,
congregated in an area called The Glen in the hours leading up to the
deaths of Mr Robertson and Mr Gray. The Glen has a reputation as a den
for teenage drinking and drug taking.
Mr Robertson and Mr Gray had bought bottles of Budweiser beer. When
three went missing, they suspected Brown and another youth, and trouble
started.
After one of his friends was assaulted by Mr Robertson and Mr Gray,
Brown went home to arm himself with a knife hidden on top of his
wardrobe. He said he was going to kill Mr Robertson.
Later, when he saw his other friend, Paton, being attacked by the
20-year-olds, rolling himself into a ball, cowering, and screaming,
Brown ran in and stabbed the men with single blows.
At one point, he was seen to be dancing round Mr Robertson with the
knife in his hand. Later, Brown told a friend: 'It's cool, it's cool.''
Then he turned to another and said: ''I've done the two of them.''

'There is a widespread feeling that the
Government has not been sympathetic
to our appalling industrial decline'
'This issue of regional government, of
having more say in our own affairs,
unites chattering classes and workers'
HERE was a bit of a guddle. No sooner had the North-east affirmed a
desire for go-it-alone regional govermment than the Labour leader, the
man who had seemed its most likely master builder, started holding back
the bricks. Tony Blair, in Tyneside for a bundle of keynote speeches,
had whispered exclusively in the ear of the Newcastle Journal that
although he knew there was strong support for a Northern assembly, he
wouldn't commit himself to establishing it at the same time as granting
devolution to Scotland and Wales.
Of course, this was all hypothetical anyway. Devolution for anyone
would require a Conservative trouncing at the ballot box. Even so, it
sounded as if Blair regretted ever floating his proposal for
parliamentary reform now that most polls indicated it was a non-starter
with the English. Yet hostility towards some variant of home rule for
the Scots had waned among them, perhaps as a result of their own
increasing disenchantment with the Government. ''I know there is strong
support for a Northern assembly,'' the Labour leader said, ''but you
just can't impose it and leave the rest of Government as it is.''
So where precisely did that leave the North-east, already boisterous
with regional enterprise objectives? From Darlington to Newcastle, in
Durham, Sunderland and Gateshead folk shouted with one voice on this
matter. Not just tired of centralism, they felt London had bound them
hand and foot, punishing them even for their political solidarity
towards Labour. ''There is a widespread feeling in this community that
the Government has not been sympathetic to our appalling industrial
decline,'' said Howard Elcock, Professor of Government at Northumbria
University.
In his view what wasn't readily understood by Westminster was that not
only had skilled and unskilled employees been savaged by the recession
but also a sizeable tier of management. ''It seems to me that civil
servants in London are unaware of that kind of pain in a society. But I
also think there has been a political bias against the North-east
because the Conservatives have no ground support here. There isn't a
single local authority in the region that is Tory, and that has hardened
prejudice against us.''
There were deep resonances here for Scotland, but while Glasgow was
pulling itself together in the Seventies, through shrewd and effective
clamour for Government funds, Newcastle was still suffering an image
problem from the T Dan Smith scandal and its exposure of civic
corruption. More recently, a new social atlas, compiled by Bristol
University, revealed that the divisions of wealth between the rich and
poor in English cities like Liverpool and Newcastle were more marked
than ever. Of course, no one in either city would be knocked back on
their heels by that disclosure. In both locations over several
generations children had been growing up in households with no
wage-earners at all.
Yet Newcastle on a Saturday morning moved with a purposeful gait.
Effective stone cleaning had lifted that old sombre quality from its
complexion and the wide streets, like Liverpool at its best, possessed
an airy grandeur. But when I was there many shoppers in the town centre
also appeared as if bereaved. Binns department store was closing for
good that night, and while consumers in their fickleness had been taking
their custom to glossier counters and that sleek Gateshead bazaar, the
Metro Centre, they still felt that something of their town's integral
character was now ending in ruins.
''This is the best, most welcoming place I've worked in all my time of
temping,'' said an assistant, a graduate in French, who had not been
able to find a teaching post. ''The staff have always looked after
short-termers like me, and that rarely happens. I've worked in France,
Germany and down south but there's none to beat the Geordies, the truest
folk in the world.''
Things are different in the North-east, affirmed Howard Elcock. ''For
a start this issue of regional government -- of having more say in our
own affairs -- unites both the chattering classes and the workers in a
way which is unusual elsewhere.'' The North-west, he reflected, had much
more difficulty in selling itself to Europe because it lacked Tyne and
Wear's homogenous identity. He conceded that some rivalry might emerge
about where to base a northern parliament. ''I would favour Newcastle
but that would clearly upset Sunderland, so it might be better to go for
Gateshead as a neutral zone.''
That apart, the North-east's wholeness was bound up in its social
history and sense of community, its distinct tribal accent which it wore
proudly, like a buttonhole.
By late afternoon I had reached Hexham, one of those grand, reassuring
market towns with an outgoing personality, a handsome abbey and a fine
respect for toasted teacakes and the disappearing art of mending antique
clocks. Yet the day before, Hexham had found recognition for a more
truculent reason: its magistrates court had become the first in Britain
to convict someone under the new Aggravated Trespass law. Last November
Dermot Morrow had been wrestled to the ground by a hunt steward when he
leapt over a fence and ran towards the fox being pursued by hounds near
Corbridge in Northumberland.
Morrow, who was carrying a whip and CB transmitter when arrested by
police, denied he had intended to obstruct or intimidate the Tynedale
Fox Hunt, under Section 68 of the new, contentious Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act. He was given a 12-month conditional discharge and
ordered to pay #100, a sum immediately settled by an unknown woman, on
Morrow's behalf. On Saturday night, however, Hexham's claim to legal
history was hardly the talk of the Tap and Spile. As in every other pub
in Britain, the National Lottery was comandeering conversation.
But in that court event here again was evidence of a specialised kind
of rancour in English life; not inner city bedlam any longer, but
explosive direct action in glorious countryside. I had seen something of
it at sleepy Brightlingsea in Essex, where this journey had begun. But
the fracas there wasn't just about animal cruelty. Interlining it had
been a determiniation to confront Europe with Anglo-Saxon cussedness,
the bourgeois instinct of Little Englanders who didn't like being pushed
around. In Northumberland, though, the issue seemed simpler: the hunt
sabs versus the toffs.
In fact, the farther north I had travelled Europhobia seemed to
diminish. In Tyneside certainly, and even in Merseyside, there were
numbers of folk who felt that only stronger regional ties with Europe
would give them a better chance of decent jobs and reasonable money in
their pockets.
So, were the provinces now leaving provincialism to the metropolitans?
True provincialism, after all, was self-absorption to a degree oblivious
and patronising to others. And who better practised parochial snobbery
than the smart centralists of London?

TOP-of-the-range housebuilder Bryant has raised half-time pre-tax
profits 47% to #245m by increasing the number of houses sold and sharply
lifting average selling prices.
However, since November there has been a cooling in demand. Chief
executive Andrew Mackenzie pointed out that in December reservations
fell 10% on a year earlier, while there was a slow start in January.
Happily, volume has improved since then -- current reservations are
level with a year ago, although the earlier 3% increase in like-for-like
house prices has been cut by half in some areas.
The build rose 18% to 1745 units, which points to Bryant achieving its
target of 3700 sales for the full year.
There was also an improvement in average selling price due to the
change in mix. This rose from #94,000 to #106,000, with the two
Edinburgh sites selling at around #130,000.
As a result, the operating margin on housing improved from 10.4% to
11.3%. A 13% target is planned for the future. That is partly dependent
upon the cost of the land bank which rose by 450 plots to a total of
10,250 and led to an increase in gearing to 29% with net debt of #68.4m.
Full-year profits look like increasing from #36.5m to about #49m on
the basis of no huge increase in mortgage rates. That would leave the
shares at 108p trading at just 9.1 times likely earnings which does seem
a little on the cheap side.
The interim dividend has edged ahead to 1.45p (1.4p) with a 5.5p total
possible for a 6.4% yield.

Michael Tumelty,the man from the judging panel, reports on how the
financial sharks were left floundering at the Prudential Award for the
Arts
I COULD not believe it. When Sir Brian Corby, chairman of the
Prudential, opened the envelope on Sunday night and announced that the
Vale of Glamorgan Festival had won the overall prize in the Prudential
Award for the Arts -- adding #75,000 to the #25,000 the festival had
already won in the music category last October -- I think my heart
stopped.
Until that moment, I had been sitting in the Olivier Theatre of the
Royal National Theatre, fairly dispassionately taking notes of comments
by this or that celebrity, this or that category winner as they were
presented with their cheques and certificates. Only when Sir Brian
announced the big-money winner as the Vale of Glamorgan Festival did I
realise the level of personal investment I had in the proceedings.
The Prudential Award for the Arts, celebrating innovation, excellence,
creativity, and accessibility, is Britain's richest arts prize. Over 200
arts organisations compete for prize money totalling more than #300,000.
The awards are divided into six categories: music, opera, film, theatre,
dance, and the visual arts. Specialist panels are appointed to
scrutinise the work of companies in each category and three companies
were short-listed in each art form.
Through the autumn of 1994 the judges' decisions were announced at
ceremonies staged throughout the country. Each category winner received
#25,000; the other two short-listed companies received a commendation
and #5000. Each category winner then proceeded to the finals where a new
cross-artform judging panel was selected and investigations began to
determine which company would receive the serious money -- an additional
#75,000 -- and the grand title of overall winner of the Prudential Award
for the Arts.
I had been asked, 18 months or so earlier, to join the panel that
would judge the awards in the music category. My fellow panellists were
the composer Steve Martland and arts administrator Camilla
Whitworth-Jones. When we started work, it looked like a formidable task.
Over 30 music companies, from the best known to the unknown, from some
of Britain's biggest multi-nationals to small, local and regional
organisations, had submitted applications. We were asked to judge
between organisations whose operating turnovers ranged between #14m and
less than #70,000.
Over a number of debates, and rigorous application of the criteria set
for us by the Pru, we uncovered a level playing-field -- which is the
very particular characteristic and the greatest strength of the
Prudential Award. Though, if you are an enormous multi-million pound
organisation -- a big shark in teeming waters -- that fact will not be
held against you, it certainly will not enable you to sweep aside the
work of a relative financial minnow. Size, in other words, did not
count.
Having determined that, we then ruthlessly took apart the applications
one by one. (Fortunately, for the reputations of many well-known British
companies, our discussions were totally secret.) By last autumn, we had
whittled the 30-odd down to a provisional short list of six. Then the
serious arguments started. On one thing the three of us were absolutely
unanimous: that the Vale of Glamorgan Festival was going to be an
outright winner of our category.
The festival is a tiny affair. It lasts for a week in the summer. For
its organisers it's a labour of intellect and love. In the face of
considerable indifference and opposition they have created a very
special festival of contemporary music, one that decides on a particular
focus -- last year Australia's leading (and seriously neglected)
composer Peter Sculthorpe.
The Vale of Glamorgan then seeks out top-class performers and
organisations who have, independently of each other, made a specialism
of this composer, championing his work, and draws them together in a
concentrated and pretty unique cohesion. The result brings a rare
opportunity for a broad and in-depth survey of the composer's music.
There is no padding; there are no sweeteners. It's like an essential
redefining of the concept of a contemporary music festival.
And it's done on a shoestring. The festival has no full-time
employees; it buys in its administration. And in its construction,
philosophically and practically, it is in itself, and in its beautiful
setting, a miniature work of art.
We thought it would be a controversial decision. It was. (There is no
arts organisation more spiteful than a big one, whose peacock-like
strutting has been rejected.) We didn't give a damn. We knew that the 25
grand that we awarded the Vale of Glamorgan at a ceremony in Glasgow
last October, would make a seminal difference to the organisation. The
guys that run it were overwhelmed.
But not as overwhelmed as they were on Sunday night when they pulled
off  the big one and added a further #75,000 to their prize money. And
this was in tough competition, against the Glyndebourne Opera Project,
The British Film Institute Production Board, Dance Umbrella, the West
Yorkshire Playhouse, and the Camden Arts Centre.
This isn't just extra money for the Vale of Glamorgan Festival. It's
not even just the kudos. It has changed forever the perception of the
festival. And the district. I said as much on Sunday night to an
ecstatic Mayor of Glamorgan. He just beamed. He knew it.
And, totally selfishly, I'm thrilled to announce that on Sunday night
it was a clean sweep for the work of the music panel. Each judging panel
had to nominate, for a special Arts Council award, an outstanding
individual in each art form. We nominated the composer Sir Michael
Tippett, 90 last month and his creative energies undimmed. He won it.

RED Nose Day will never be the same again -- the latest model for
Comic Relief turns pink and then yellow after being put on.
Comic Relief founder Lenny Henry showed off the nose yesterday as he
unveiled details of fundraising events for March 17.
Desmond Tutu is to imitate a sheep for a version of Old MacDonald Had A
Farm, written by Phil Collins. The Archbishop of Cape Town is among an
all-star stable of impersonators including Emma Thompson as a pig,
Whoopie Goldberg as a chicken, and Hugh Grant as a cat.
Four Weddings and A Funeral scriptwriter Richard Curtis has written a
sequel to Oliver Twist to be screened on the day. It stars Dame Diana
Rigg, Jeremy Irons, Pauline Collins, Michael Palin, and Oliver Reed.
1 A six-hour TV special on BBC 1, Night of Comic Relief, will include
Harry Enfield, Griff Rhys Jones, Dawn French, Chris Evans, and Mel
Smith.
This year the charity expects to pass the #100m mark in donations
overall -- it is already running at #92m after four events.
Two thirds of the cash will go to Africa. The rest will stay in the UK
for projects which support homeless and disabled young people and those
with drug problems.

AFTER two recent cancellations Michael Chance rewarded his audience's
patience last night with a recital that displayed his counter-tenor
voice in all its facets.
Softly floated lute songs by Thomas Campion launched the programme and
music more lusciously brilliant by Monteverdi continued it. The
contrast, in an auditorium of exemplary size, was striking. Seldom did
the singer have to force his tone. Often, indeed, he was able to reduce
it to a tiny yet wholly audible ribbon of sound, as expressive in the
quiet, confidential despondency of Dowland's In Darkness Let Me Dwell --
with Christopher Wilson's softly plashing lute accompaniment -- as in
the bright, pure declamation of Purcell's Music for a While.
Purcell, three centuries dead this year, was naturally the recital's
primary focus, his harmonies -- with Alastair Ross as harpsichordist --
providing a still, hypnotic support to Chance's exquisitely spun
melismas.
Amid the groups of English songs, the Italian ones were effectively
planted, Caccini's Amarilli mia bella unfurled with unfailing sweetness
and precision, and an aria from Handel's Rinaldo projected with
keen-edged, perfectly gauged, operatic fire.
Anyone who still believes that there is only one way of singing a
counter-tenor song would have found this recital a revelation. As the
first instalment of Song Lines -- a six-part survey of vocal music being
recorded by the BBC in Edinburgh and Glasgow -- it was the best of
aperitifs.

* HALF-YEAR profits at Rupert Murdoch's News International,
wholly-owned by News Corporation, were boosted by gains on the sale of
20% of its holding in BSkyB.
In the six months to end-December, News International reported pre-tax
profits of #561.9m compared with #126.7m previously. There was a profit
on disposal of #403.4m.
Turnover was 15% ahead at #398.1m. UK newspaper profits were 13%
higher. This was largely due to higher advertising revenues both from
circulation gains and a rise of 15% in rates at The Sun, News of the
World and Times. Price cutting by News International's UK titles boosted
circulation.
There is a dividend of 1.62p, up from 0.72p, payable to special
dividend shareholders.

There's no need to shout about it but Paul Costelloe is not a party
animal. In many ways he stands apart from the fashion pack and his
clothes have the same sort of subtle understatement which is the
hallmark of their creator. And, says Anne Simpson, this allows them to
be worn with confidence and style
YOU won't catch Paul Costelloe at many parties where the paparazzi
focus on the hip crowd, with a lens like a mortician's eye. Instead,
free time is mostly taken up with the rumbustious family which spins
around his wife and seven children, and with the rather creaky but
valiant soccer he still plays with pals all over the age of 35.
In fact this tall, craggy figure with sparse, sandy hair carries the
aura of a sports-loving farmer rather than that of garment-maker to the
chic.
None of this, however, can detract from Costelloe's reputation as a
designer of thoroughbred nonchalance and comfort. He is one of those
rare individuals in the fashion industry, who instinctively listens to
what women want, and as a result Costelloe makes the stylish wearable.
He is also a realist, a man aware of his trade's destructive vanities
and who knows that competition comes from everywhere: ''You have to be
reasonably commercial because people are not willing to be fooled by
designer labels any longer,'' he says. ''Quite rightly they will only go
for long-term quality but the vital thing is not to be distracted from
what you do best by the whims of other designers.''
Twenty years ago most people still regarded Irish fashion as a
rudimentary set of items, a coat of Donegal tweed and an Aran sweater
whose only major catwalk was the stands at rugby internationals. If
glamour hung about the look it was usually in a foaming collar of
Carrickmacross lace, for it wasn't until Armani came along that the
world realised tweed could be cut in ways which were exciting,
unexpected, and sexy.
Costelloe has always embraced that challenge. Free of inhibitions
about only employing the cloth in a purist manner, the Dublin designer
and early favourite of the Princess of Wales, works directly with
Ireland's specialist wool and linen mills, gaining also from their
liaison with leading international designers such as Dior, Saint
Laurent, Ralph Lauren, and Donna Karan.
And while the European Union has given the Irish capital a significant
continental coat to wear, opening its shop doors to influential foreign
names, so it has also enabled home designers like Costelloe and John
Rocha to venture outside the boundaries of their own small country. That
means, though, that they must be strong enough in line to stand exposure
at the most critical of trade fairs. But, like Scotland, Ireland is
still hindered by its lack of an internationally known fashion school to
exploit native talent.
That most exotic Dubliner, Rocha, with his Chinese and Portuguese
background, was, for instance, a student at Croydon; Costelloe, the next
most widely known of Ireland's designers, studied in New York which
partly accounts for the casual polish of his silhouettes. Recently he
opened his second ''niche'' shop in Britain, in Glasgow's Princes
Square, the only one in Scotland. The flagship shop opened last October
opposite Emporio Armani in London, and now others are planned for
Belfast and Leicester.
Other than these, of course, major stores, dotted through the country,
carry selections from his Signature and Dressage lines. ''I have to
treat the whole of the UK as my home market because you can't entirely
depend on exports to Europe and America, and the native market just
isn't large enough to provide sufficient support.''
Costelloe steers clear of any structured, frocky look, preferring the
kind of willowy silhouette which fits into a businesswoman's wardrobe
without complications. What he excels at is infinitely easy but elegant
separates.
''I enjoy designing dresses now and then, but separates provide much
more variety. They allow you to place fabric on fabric, colour on
colour, but still with  a unifying theme.'' As seen in his new spring
collections, the effect can be memorably interesting, often inspired by
mannish tailoring but melted  into something feminine and soft.
But there remains out there what Costelloe describes as ''a Joan
Collins  market'', and in his view it is one which is detrimental to
fashion and to women themselves. ''It places a woman in the same context
as a  product, as if she were a car with two shining headlights  and
this season's colour.'' When that happens, he muses, the rag trade tends
to act negligently, forgetting  the consumer is not always some kind of
insatiable machine, but a person of considered taste, a figure of
discernment.
STOCKISTS
All items from Paul Costelloe's new spring and summer collection which
will be on sale at his shop in Princes Square, Glasgow. A selection will
also be available at Jenners in Edinburgh and Frasers in Glasgow.

POLICE yesterday warned a teenage girl following an egg-throwing
incident as alleged mass murderer Rosemary West left court on Monday.
Senior officers also appealed to the large worldwide media contingent
covering Mrs West's committal proceedings at Dursley magistrates court
in Gloucestershire, to help prevent any more demonstrations.
Mrs West, 41, a mother-of-seven, faces 10 charges of murdering young
women, including her 16-year-old daughter Heather, and her
eight-year-old step-daughter Charmaine.
Yesterday, she arrived at and left the courthouse without incident. On
Monday, the first day of the hearing, eggs were hurled at the police van
taking her back to Pucklechurch Remand Centre, Bristol.
A Gloucestershire police spokesman confirmed that a 17-year-old girl
had ''received advice'' about the incident.
He added: ''We are concerned by what we have heard locally, indicating
that the demonstrations were, to some extent, organised to satisfy the
demands of camera crews and photographers. We are appealing to the media
to help us prevent any further incidents.''
Mrs West spent a second day in the dock as prosecution allegations
were detailed to Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary magistrate Peter Badge.
Reporting restrictions have not been lifted, and details of what was
said in court cannot appear in the British media.
The hearing continues.

Graeme Smith profiles
Allan Stewart's successor
IT has taken George Kynoch less than three years to make a spectacular
but not unexpected rise from new boy at the House of Commons to Scottish
Office Minister.
There is nothing ''loutish'' about the Moray businessman who has a
ministerial air and made a considerable impact on his colleagues with
his success in wresting back the Kincardine and Deeside constituency
just five months after the Liberal Democrats borrowed it following the
death of Alick Buchanan Smith.
Politics run deep in the Kynoch blood with both his father and
grandfather involved in the Banffshire scene but until 1992 his energy
was devoted to other matters.
It was a bitter blow to the Tories to lose Kincardine and Deeside
after 27 years but Kynoch, 48, believed that in his first parliamentary
attempt that he could succeed in the General Election where the previous
candidate Marcus Humphrey had failed miserably.
He put his name forward and the constituency party were astute enough
to spot his potential and selected him rather than other well known
local candidates. Their choice was vindicated when almost 10,000 voters
who had not backed Humphrey agreed Kynoch was the man for the job and he
coasted home with a 4495 majority.
His business skills, his confidence, and a touch of arrogance,
equipped him well for the Commons and he settled in immediately and made
a swift impact on his party bosses.
''He took to the Commons like a duck to water,'' said one observer,
''and has performed well.''
His accomplished television performances have also helped boost his
career.
Only six months after his election he took the first step up the
ministerial ladder when he was appointed parliamentary private secretary
to Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad. And just four months ago he
was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Education Secretary
Mrs Gillian Shepherd.
Alick Buchanan Smith won the hearts of many because of his refusal to
toe the party line if he believed it would disadvantage his
constituents. That attitude seriously disadvantaged his career but his
successor's rise will not be interrupted by rebellion.
''He may not be a rebel but that does not mean he is not banging
tables in the background,'' said one political ally.
A measured man, he is not the type to put his career on the line with
a wave of a pick axe; but a year ago he did find himself in hot water
from which he managed to extricate himself with only minor burns.
Both Mr Kynoch and Scottish Secretary Ian Lang had to apologise to the
Speaker Miss Betty Boothroyd for an abuse of Commons procedure.
The reprimand came because a civil servant, the Scottish Office
Parliamentary Clerk, tabled a question on Mr Kynoch's behalf using
pre-signed blank forms which he had provided.
His family's roots go back two centuries in Banffshire where he was
brought up but he has now moved the family home to Dess near Aboyne
within his constituency, a move which meant his wife Rosslyn, a GP, had
to give up her practice.
He went to school in Keith, Edinburgh and Glenalmond in Perthshire
before graduating with BSc Honours from the University in Bristol. He
then worked for several years with ICI at Ardeer in Ayrshire as a plant
engineer before moving back to the family company G &amp;G Kynoch plc in
Keith. It was then a wool textile manufacturing company but in 1990 as
chief executive he was instrumental in restructuring it into medical and
healthcare products and phasing out textiles.
He has held numerous industrial posts and is a past chairman of the
Scottish Woollen Publicity Council and president of the Scottish Woollen
Industry.
He was Grampian Industrialist of the Year in 1988 and was a founder
director of Moray, Badenoch and Strathspey Local Enterprise Co.
He sees many parallels between his business career and his political
career. Both involve ''communications, management and marketing''.
When The Herald suggested to him more than two years ago he was a
rising star, he sidestepped the speculation by saying: ''My aim first
and foremost is to look after the constituents of Kincardine and Deeside
if that doesn't sound too corny.
''If in time further opportunities arise I will cross each bridge as
it comes.''
He is making the most of his political career, having been a late
starter.
He first held office in the Moray Conservative Association in 1980 but
considered standing for Parliament 21 years ago but with a new born baby
to consider decided that his place was at home.
''I then immediately became involved in exporting and spent more time
away than I would have as an MP,'' he said.
That baby, Tara, is now a 21-year-old student in Edinburgh.
The Kynochs also have a son, Michael (18) who, having finished his
studies at Glenalmond, has taken a year out and is currently ''washing
dishes in Switzerland'' before starting university to fulfil his
ambition of following his mother into the medical profession.

THE watchdog body which regulates commercial television has enough
powers to ensure a planned new pornography satellite TV channel complies
with its rules, National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell said last
night.
The Independent Television Commission has given David Sullivan,
publisher of the Sunday Sport and several adult magazines, the go-ahead
to launch his channel, Babylon Blue, in the spring.
Mr Dorrell said in a written reply: ''I am aware of public concern
about the portrayal of sexual condutct in television programmes and keep
this matter under careful review, in consultation with the regulatory
bodies.
''Babylon Blue, which has been licensed by the ITC, has yet to begin
broadcasting.
''If and when it does, it will be expected fully to comply with the
ITC's programme code and the conditions of its licence.

<RECORDNO>979959994</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A HEALTH trust chief yesterday told an industrial tribunal in
Inverness that he was unable to relieve the intense work pressure on his
junior doctors because of Government red tape.
Efforts had been made to recruit more doctors to relieve the workload
but the appointments had been held up because of a delay in getting work
permits for the appointees.
Dr John Machin, the medical director of Raigmore Hospital NHS Trust in
Inverness, said that his junior doctors had applied no pressure to force
change in overtime working.
The tribunal has been called to hear an overtime back-pay demand by
two former registrars in the hospital's gynaecology and obstetrics
department.
Dr Neil Maclean, 30, and Dr Christine Conner, 31, who worked at the
hospital until August 1994 argue that, under a national agreement, their
work pattern should have put them into a higher overtime classification.
That would have given them 70% of the basic hourly rate rather than the
50% they were paid.
Dr Maclean, of Garden Court, Denmore Park, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen, is
claiming #4269 and Dr Conner of Rosslyn Terrace, Dowanhill, Glasgow
#4434.
Dr Machin told the hearing in Inverness that when the doctors accepted
the posting for a year's training at his hospital, they were told that
efforts were being made to recruit more doctors.
It had taken months to fill the vacancies, although funding had been
allocated, and the appointments were not made until after the two
doctors had left because the trust could not get work permits for the
extra staff from the Home Office.
Dr Machin said the shift pattern had now been changed and although he
had sympathy with doctors MacLean and Conner, he could not increase
their banding during their contract because of Government restrictions.
''I understood that pay was directly related to the actual work
arrangements, and we were unable to change that shift system because we
didn't have sufficient staff,'' he said.
The tribunal will issue its findings later.

ASBESTOSIS sufferers have attacked Labour for failing to clarify its
position on the future of a controversial Government scheme designed to
claw back the money paid to victims of work-place negligence.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar is under pressure to
give a clear commitment to scrap the Compensation Recovery Unit, which
is recovering more than #100m a year from individuals who have received
compensation for injuries ranging from bomb injuries to asbestosis.
Representatives of Clydeside Action for Asbestosis today will give
evidence to the Commons Social Security Committee on the work of the
unit. They claim it is unfairly penalising those who have suffered at
the hands of negligent companies.
The CRU was set up in 1989 to recoup from recipients state benefits
paid out while a compensation claim was under consideration. The cash
reclaimed is deducted from the compensation payment, and in some cases
wipes it out entirely.
Although Labour is critical of the scheme, the party is reluctant to
say anything that would be interpreted as a financial commitment two
years before a General Election. A promise to scrap the CRU would amount
to a pledge to spend an extra #100m a year.
However, pressure to address the question of the CRU is mounting. Last
year, asbestosis sufferers lobbied MPs on the issue and highlighted a
number of cases in which terminally ill patients have seen their entire
compensation -- in some cases more than #40,000 -- clawed back by the
CRU.
Mr Dewar said he was examining a number of options, including uprating
the amount above which compensation is clawed back. It is currently set
at #2500, but has not been uprated for more than five years.
He said: ''The current system is far too harsh. It does not take into
account loss and suffering.'' However, he added, he is not prepared to
promise its abolition.
This has angered asbestosis campaigners. Mr Ian McKechnie, a spokesman
for Clydeside Action, said: ''There appears to be no policy. We know Mr
Dewar is not going to scrap it so we don't know how sympathetic he is to
our argument. He is making a lot of ambiguous sounds.''
Clydebank MP Tony Worthington said the system was an injustice to
those who for years had contributed through tax to future benefits only
to see tham taken back. In its first year, the scheme clawed back less
than #4m. This year receipts will exceed #100m.

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond was rebuked yesterday by the Commons Speaker,
Miss Betty Boothroyd, just after his party's policies had been fiercely
attacked by the Prime Minister.
Immediately Mr Major's 15- minute questions session ended, Mr Salmond
asked the Speaker if she did not agree that he deserved the right of
reply she had earlier given Labour leader Tony Blair, ''if the Prime
Minister starts bawling at me.''
Miss Boothroyd told him: ''I think you were really making gestures
from a seated position and encouraging the Prime Minister. I thought it
was rather unfair on the Prime Minister and, if I may say, you got what
you deserved from the Prime Minister.''
Having apparently accused Mr Salmond of inciting the Prime Minister's
attack, she softened the blow by adding, ''try again on Thursday,''
probably indicating that she will call Mr Salmond to ask a question at
Mr Major's Question Time tomorrow.
The Prime Minister's onslaught on the SNP was triggered by a question
from Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for North Tayside, who praised the
benefits of the Union to Scotland.
He said that with less than 9% of the UK population, Scotland had 20%
of the Cabinet places and was well represented in the military, trade
unions and industry. ''That the Scots will not give up,'' he said.
Mr Major emphasised the advantages to Scotland and the rest of the UK
of Scotland staying in the Union adding, ''I do not believe there is
anyone who has studied the problem who doubts that for a single
moment.''
This appeared to sting Mr Salmond into a retort inaudible in the press
gallery.
However, Mr Major told him sharply, ''You clearly have not studied it
because you doubt it.''
He added: ''The reason you doubt it is because you want an independent
Scotland, disunited from the UK, in the middle of a European Union where
it would have little or no influence, where it would damage the
interests of Scots, damage the interests of Scotland and damage the
wider interests of the UK.''
He added: ''That is why your party must never be put in power in any
way in Scotland or elsewhere.''
Mr Salmond said later: ''I was just nodding my head vigorously at the
bits on Scottish independence and I just observed that Bill Walker was
talking nonsense as usual.
''The Prime Minister should really go on Valium. He lost the place
with Tony Blair and then with me when he started bawling and shouting.
''I think I should challenge him to come to Scotland and debate the
issues with me there.''
* Also at Prime Minister's Question Time, the SNP's parliamentary
leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing, accused the Government of ''destroying'' the
north of Scotland's manufacturing industry.
Mrs Ewing claimed that the loss of sleeper and Motorail services north
of the Border would have a similar effect on the tourist industry.
However, Mr Major rejected the accusations and insisted that
manufacturing industry was expanding across the UK and breaking export
levels.
Mrs Ewing said: ''Since the Government's policy has virtually
destroyed the manufacturing base of the north of Scotland, including
industries such as our pulp mills, oil fabrication yards, a smelter and
more recently the mothballing of three distilleries, are you prepared to
sit back and watch the destruction of our tourist industry as a result
of the axeing of rail services to the north of Scotland?''
Mr Major replied: ''Of course I will look carefully at what you have
to say. We are very keen to see the tourist industry be successful both
in the north of Scotland and elsewhere in the UK.
''If you look right across Scotland and the UK, you will see
manufacturing industry is expanding and doing extremely well,

Sarajevo, Tuesday
THE United Nations tonight said food was desperately short in the
embattled Bosnian enclave of Bihac and it warned besieging Croatian
Serbs that Nato would retaliate if they used air power in fighting
there.
The worsening situation in Bihac contrasted with an easing of the
Bosnian Serb grip on the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, where hundreds of
people today flocked to use roads newly opened under a ceasefire
agreement.
They were seizing the chance to journey out of the besieged city
without the risk of being shot, but a civilian was killed when the car
he was driving hit an anti-tank mine on a forbidden road next to
Sarajevo airport.
Rebel Muslim and Serb forces were blocking aid convoys to Bihac and
desperate citizens said they had not eaten for days, said the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees.
Several thousand people demonstrated outside UNHCR offices in Bihac
town on Monday to urge relief workers to help them, said spokesman Kris
Janowski.
Bihac authorities feared riots could break out among hungry civilians
cut off in the government-held pocket, which is surrounded by Bosnian
and Croatian Serb forces, Janowski added.
A ceasefire has held in most of Bosnia since January 1, but not in the
north-western enclave where Bosnian Government troops have clashed with
Muslim rebels backed by Serbs from the breakaway Krajina region of
neighbouring Croatia.
The UN said peacekeepers had spotted increased activity at the
Serb-controlled Udbina airfield and it warned the Serbs against using
airpower in Bihac.
''Such actions would constitute the violation of the no-fly zone over
Bosnia and would inevitably lead to use of Nato airpower,'' said Paul
Risley, UN spokesman in Zagreb.
Nato bombed Udbina airfield in November after Serbs used it to mount
air raids on Bosnian army positions in Bihac but UN sources said the
runway had since been repaired.
Meanwhile, an exasperated US said it was tired of waiting for the
Bosnian Serbs and was cutting off talks with their leaders because of
their refusal to accept a plan to end the 34-month-old war worked out by
the ''Contact Group'' of the US, Britain, Russia, France, and Germany.
In Washington, US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke said
bluntly: ''There's no point in shuttling up the hill from Sarajevo to
Pale to listen to the kind of crap which was dished out by (Serb leader
Radovan) Karadzic.''
In another development, Nato asked Bonn for concrete pledges on the
military support it will provide in any alliance-led withdrawal of
United Nations peacekeepers from Bosnia, the German Government said
today.
The daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Nato commanders were pushing ahead
fast with preparations, fearing that spring could bring a flare-up of
the conflict and force the withdrawal which international mediators are
trying to avert.

FOUR in 10 school-leavers should be entitled to a place in higher
education by the end of the decade, university chiefs have said.
At present 30% go on to higher education, although the proportion is
higher in Scotland.
In its submission to the Government's review of higher education, the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals says the 40% target can be
achieved only if the Government lifts the block on expansion next year
-- and provides adequate funding to meet the increase.
''As a nation, we cannot afford not to expand. Nor . . . can we afford
to compromise on quality as the system expands,'' it says.
Rising school staying-on rates confirm that youngsters have higher
career expectations which, the CVCP says, lead to greater demand for
university places.
Mature students -- undergraduates aged 21 and over -- make up the
majority of those in higher education and the CVCP also expects their
numbers to increase.
It criticised the Government's methods for funding higher education
and assessing performance which threatened collaboration between
institutions because they emphasised competition.
Pointing out that the amount of money provided by the Government for
teaching had been cut by 29% in recent years and was to be reduced by a
further 9%, the CVCP said more expansion in the sector allied to
maintaining quality could not be assured without adequate resources.
It attacked the ''stop-go'' policies of expansion then
financially-driven consolidation which denied the opportunity of
university education to many who could benefit from it.
Vice-chancellors and principals reminded the Government of their
opposition to the Student Loans scheme. They have proposed that working
graduates should contribute towards their maintenance costs and have
argued that, if there is insufficient Government funding, a similar
scheme should be introduced to help meet the cost of tuition fees.

A JUDGE'S decision to free four paratroopers who crippled a Scots
father of two in a drunken attack caused outrage last night.
Judge David MacLaren Webster said he did not want to ruin the
soldiers' careers.
Lance Corporals Stuart Baillie, 26, and Justin Woodcock, 22, and
Privates Craig Harris, 23, and James Collins, 21, all with 1 Para at
Normandy Barracks, Aldershot, Hampshire, attacked Mr James McGuire, 33,
outside a nightclub, kicking him as he lay on the ground.
Mr McGuire suffered two fractured arms, broken ribs and head injuries
and spent 10 days in hospital. He still cannot work and has restricted
use of his arms.
The soldiers were appearing for sentence at Winchester Crown Court.
They had admitted unlawfully wounding Mr McGuire but denied charges of
violent disorder and inflicting grievous bodily. The charges were left
on court files.
But all four soldiers walked free from court after Judge MacLaren
Webster described the attack as a ''moment of madness''.
The sentence was condemned by Aldershot MP Julian Critchley who
described it as ''a shocking case''.
He added: ''I shall take the matter up with the Secretary of State for
Defence and suggest that the sentence was far too light.''
The Judge told the paratroopers: ''It will be of more value to your
country to do some community work than for me to incarcerate you.
''I do not think the public would want all your past service training
thrown over for a moment's madness.''
Judge MacLaren Webster ordered Baillie to complete 200 hours community
service and to pay Mr McGuire #4000 compensation and court costs of
#175.
Collins, Woodcock and Harris were each ordered to complete 180 hours
community service and to pay #3000 each compensation and #100 each
costs.
Glasgow-born Mr McGuire said yesterday: ''Those sentences were
absolutely disgraceful. If the Judge had four civilians in court for
doing this to a soldier they would definitely go to prison.
''Burglars are sent to jail for less than what these four did to me.''
He added: ''Because of my injuries I have been out of work since the
attack -- whereas these four can carry on in their jobs as normal.''

THERE was some dispute at Westminster last night about whether John
Major had ''lost the heid'' or had ''put the heid on'' the other side in
the brutal but fortunately only wordy battlefield that is the House of
Commons.
Needless to say, those on the Opposition side saw him as a rattled man
who lost the place and roared -- or did the best he could as the Major
larynx was not really designed for roaring -- first at Mr Blair, then at
Mr Salmond.
Neither of these are defenceless wee mites and they both chose this
rough trade, so we do not need to weep because someone was nasty to
them.
Mr Major certainly has enough on his plate to make anyone's nerves
twang. There are the opinion polls, a Northern Ireland peace process in
the balance, the refusal of the voters to feel good and, of course,
Europe.
Whether recent unsubstantiated allegations about a youthful love
affair is a negative factor is more doubtful but, as a private man, he
probably hates the publicity, true or not.
When Palmerston, aged 79, was rumoured to have fathered an
illegitimate child, the-then Opposition chiefs decided to hush up the
matter. ''He will sweep the country,'' one reportedly muttered.
Such discretion would be next to impossible under the glare of the
modern media spotlight
Even the House of Commons changes, though slowly, and Mr Major may
have taken the first step yesterday in changing one of the most hallowed
traditions.
After Mr Blair had had fun with the somewhat different European
aspirations which Cabinet Ministers, it seems, cannot help expressing,
he said, in effect, to the Leader of the Opposition ''come on then, tell
us what you would do.''
This flew in the face of the convention that Question Time exists to
make the Government defend its policies and actions.
Speakers regularly crush Tory back benchers who ask Ministers: ''Isn't
Labour policy on X Y or Z absolutely disgusting?''
There are quite easy ways of getting round this, but it does not
perhaps speak well of the IQ of the Tory back benchers that a goodly
number have not yet mastered the trick and are regularly hand-bagged by
Miss Boothroyd.
However, with Mr Blair on the edge of his bench, possibly having lost
count of the number of questions he had asked, the Speaker relented. Mr
Blair could deal with the question.
It could be a historic ruling. We may usher in the twenty-first
century by having Leader of the Opposition's questions.
However, Mr Blair, so radical when chipping away at the stone tablets
of his party's faith, proved a genuine traditionalist on Commons
procedure.
Put in the place of a long line of British Prime Ministers he did what
they did. He didn't answer the question but attacked the other side.
Mr Major, from his point of view, is right to keep on about Labour
divisions on Europe. They are there and at some point will surface
spectacularly.
However, his own side's are more obvious and, as they are the
Government, naturally attract more publicity.
Mr Salmond later complained that Mr Major had bawled at him when he
turned his attention to the dangers of nationalism. The House was even
noiser than usual and had Mr Major spoken dulcetly few would have heard
him.
Also, Mr Salmond put in a few words of his own which ''encouraged''
the Prime Minister -- in the Speaker's rather unusual choice of words --
to have an even bigger go at Mr Salmond's party.
So worked up did he become that he ended with any declaration that the
SNP must not be allowed to take power in Scotland or ''anywhere else'.''
Members of the SNP, fighting or wading their way like the rest of
their countrymen through a Scottish winter might be attracted by the
suggestion.
Opening an SNP branch in the Bahamas, for example, sounds nice.

THE MAN who played a pivotal role in winning the title City of
Architecture for Glasgow yesterday paid the price for his efforts.
Mr Mike Hayes, the district council's director of planning, took the
unusual step of apologising publicly for a delay in handling sensitive
planning applications last year.
He was ordered to appear before the council's development control
committee after it emerged that two applications for the West End of the
city had taken 10 months to reach the committee.
Mr Hayes said he had taken responsibility for them and because of
pressure through his dual role as director of planning and leader of the
successful City of Architecture bid had not dealt with them in time.
''As a consequence of the pressures on me at this difficult and busy
time when I was externally involved in the 1999 bid the applications
were not processed as quickly as they should have been,'' he told the
committee.
''It is with hindsight that I regret that, in the exceptional
circumstances that prevailed, these applications did not receive the
attention they deserved.''
Scottish Office guidelines say planning applications should be decided
within two months. However, in many circumstances the council agrees an
extension with the applicant to allow detailed matters to be
investigated.
Both applications in this case were for licensed premises in Ashton
Lane near Glasgow University. Mr Hayes said that he had decided to take
a personal interest in them because development in the area was a
sensitive issue.
Mr Hayes later confirmed that one applicant has appealed to the Scots
Secretary on the grounds that the application was not dealt with in time
and could be considered a refusal.
However, the council's development control committee will visit the
proposed developments and each is recommended for approval.

BBC Scotland is to take over the BBC2 airwaves for an entire evening
later this month to broadcast a series of programmes which will
celebrate the 700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance.
The night, Saturday, February 18, coincides with the Scotland v France
rugby clash at the Parc Des Princes in Paris.
The apres-match festivities will start with The Cauld Alliance, a
programme about ''the Scottish bits of France and the French bits of
Scotland,'' which will include a special arrangement of the song Je
t'aime (moi non plus) by the Lothian and Borders Pipe Band.
The night will also include a special Tin Tin cartoon in which the
eponymous character and Snowy the Dog find themselves on the Black Isle,
and a live concert from Princes Street by the French Cajun popsters, The
French Alligators.
Other programmes lined up are a Scottish edition of the French
talkshow, Coucou C'est Nous, and a documentary, presented by Oz Clarke,
about the lifeblood of the Auld Alliance, wine.
The highlight of the night will be Words Avec Wark, billed as a
hard-hitting debate about ''the burning issues which divide opinion on
both sides of the Channel.''
Among the topics which Ms Wark will tackle are: * The Scottish
identity in Europe. (While the Auld Alliance is celebrated in Scotland,
do the French treat it as a political and cultural phenomenon of any
significance?)
* Our different approaches to animal welfare. (What do the French
think about our veal protesters?)
* And our contrasting attitudes to sex and morality. (Is Scotland's
perception of the sex-lives of politicians coloured by our virulent and
prurient tabloid press and why have the French no hang-ups about it?)
Mr Colin Cameron, head of BBC Scotland Television, said: ''We decided
to mark the 700th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty between
France and Scotland with this entire evening of special entertainment.
''The seven-hour line-up will provide us with the longest-ever
opt-out from the network schedule.''

His resignation yesterday ended what had not been a good few days for
Allan Stewart. Iain Wilson,chief reporter, and Elizabeth Buie trace back
the countown to his downfall
JUST two days before the woodland pickaxe fracas that led to his
resignation as a Scottish Office Minister, Allan Stewart was busy
handing out good community awards to local pupils.
The prizes were for designing ''Safer Eastwood'' campaign posters.
Subjects covered road safety, crime prevention, and the environment.
These very issues seem to have been turned on their head in Sunday's
extraordinary clash with motorway protestors at Pollok Castle Wood,
Newton Mearns.
Mr Stewart's reasons for seeking an impromptu visit to sites of the
proposed motorway extension -- and his demeanour on the tour -- remain a
matter of conjecture.
His request, according to Wimpey Construction, undertaking the
controversial #54m project, was only lodged by telephone as late as
lunchtime on Sunday -- probably between 11.30am and noon.
Mr Stewart's whereabouts between then and 4pm are not known, but the
motorway protestors allege he had been drinking before his arrival. The
MP confirmed to The Herald last night that he had a gin and tonic and a
glass of wine during a ''normal family Sunday lunch''.
What made Mr Stewart go down that muddy road into Pollok Castle estate
and the lion's den, where his subsequent actions have been described as
bizarre and loutish by the Opposition?
It would appear a growing army of constituents had been pressuring him
to take action against the environmental campaigners who have set up
camp at the site.
Life was so much simpler on Friday, when he had no Scottish Office
engagements.
FRIDAY, 11.30am
* His day began with the presentations at Eastwood High, followed by a
school dinner. He then moved on to Mearns Castle High, to watch an
international volleyball game for the disabled.
On Friday night, he addressed a Conservative Party dinner at Blyth
Hall, Newport on Tay, and stayed overnight in Dundee with his father.
SATURDAY, am
* Mr Stewart drove home to Neilston on Saturday morning. Although he
did not have a surgery, at least four constituents were given
appointments at his house on Saturday afternoon to discuss problems. The
evening was spent at a private dinner, visiting friends.
SuNDAY, 12 noon
* Until the fateful woodland clash, expanded upon later, constituency
secretary Jeanette Muir had believed Mr Stewart's weekend was ''standard
form.''
Miss Ella Rae, the prospective Liberal Democrat candidate for the new
Green Farm ward in Eastwood, claimed yesterday that Mr Stewart phoned
her after lunchtime on Sunday to say he was going to the motorway site.
Her impression from the conversation was that he wanted to be seen in
the area, especially when some people had been making out that he was
never there.
MONDAY, 4.15
* Despite the ensuing rumpus, which by now had hit the headlines, Mr
Stewart attended a news conference on Monday morning before his 10am
address to a Scottish Enterprise conference in the Moat House Hotel,
Glasgow, on financial and business services.
A number of so-called ''political engagements'' followed, before
flying to London mid-afternoon. The engagements are thought to be a
euphemism for taking soundings about his position with close party
colleagues and friends.
At that time, there were still strong expectations that he would
survive as a Scottish Office Minister, especially with no call for his
resignation from the Opposition.
But it is understood Mr Stewart, on Monday night, had meetings with
Government Whips concerned about his conduct.
By then, his son's alleged involvement in the heated exchanges on
Sunday had been made public.
TUESDAY, 12.20
* Mr Stewart had official meetings in Dover House, the London-based
Scottish Office -- where Scots Secretary Ian Lang was also in residence.
His letter of resignation to the Prime Minister suggests the decision
was based on discussions with his family.
On Sunday, he had been accompanied by his son Jack, a friend, David
Clow,and two local Conservative candidates, Richard Cook and Neil
Deerey.
The party had been led by just one Wimpey Construction representation,
roads director Dan Pollard, who claims to have been ahead of the group
and not a witness to the troubles.
Mr Stewart picked up a pickaxe and a protestor claims he was pushed
during the incidents. A police report on the MP has been sent to the
procurator-fiscal.
His 16-year-old son, and a friend of the same age, will be reported to
the procurator fiscal within the next 19 days for alleged contravention
of the Firearms Act.
The teenagers could face charges of carrying firearms, believed to be
air guns.
It would appear that scenario, involving his son, led Mr Stewart's
resignation yesterday. He has insisted all along that he only picked up
the pickaxe, found at his feet ''for his own safety, that of his
companions, and to prevent anyone else doing so''.
Last night, those at the confrontation alleged Mr Stewart had been
aggressive and his language abusive. They were also claims that his
breath smelled of alcohol.
Mr Lindsay Keenan, one of the Earth First! campaigners, said a group
had been sitting in a pre-fabricated building called The Nursery when
one woman shouted that someone was ripping a banner down. He alleged Mr
Stewart was with a seven-strong group, shouting and screaming, and
asking if any of the people were local residents.
Mr Keenan also alleged Mr Stewart was red in the face, and went on:
''He was not falling over drunk, but he had definitely had a couple of
halves -- probably whisky. He was two inches away from my face screaming
at me.
''He started to push me -- two or three pushes in my chest. He gave me
a good shove into the people standing behind me. I instantly turned to
the people on my right-hand side and told them to get the police. He
said: 'Do you think the police will make any difference?' ''
Mr Brian McFadyen claimed Mr Stewart had called the protestors ''manky
hippies'', and had added: ''What are you doing in my constituency? You
don't even belong to Eastwood.''
Miss Heather McMahon said Mr Stewart asked one of the group: ''Have
you never heard of a bar of soap?''
Mr Stewart, in a statement, claims he was rushed by about a dozen
protestors. The situation was ''extremely unpleasant'' until good sense
prevailed and a reasonable discussion with a small group of protestors
ensued.
The protestors' version is that they were confronted by Mr Stewart and
about seven others after a roadside banner had been ripped down. They
claim Mr Stewart picked up the pickaxe and started swinging it around.
They blocked his car and called the police.

A GLASGOW University doctor has claimed the city's programme of giving
out methadone as a substitute drug for heroin abusers may be having a
positive effect.
This is despite the record figure of drugs-related deaths in
Strathclyde last year.
Dr John Oliver, consultant forensic toxicologist, says it is too early
to be definite, but he believes there is a message of hope against the
backdrop of fatalities.
At the same time, nearly half the drug abusers who died were found to
have methadone in their bloodstream -- a significant minority had levels
higher than the therapeutic dosage.
Methadone has been distributed through community pharmacies in
Strathclyde for just over a year by the Glasgow Drugs Problem Service,
with 44% of pharmacists now taking part and more expected to sign up.
Many opponents of the programme say the fatality figures prove it
merely substitutes one drug of abuse for another.
However, Dr Oliver's graph of drug-related deaths in the region stops
considerably short of the number projected for 1994 which was 120.
Strathclyde experienced 95 drug-related deaths, a figure which can be
reduced when the four Ecstasy deaths in Ayrshire -- deaths outwith the
regular drugs scene -- are taken away.
Dr Oliver said: ''We will know if the methodone programme really works
in another two years. But, meantime, we have to ask whether the rate of
increase is slowing down, whether more abusers are living longer.
''It is possible that the programme is working already, but the
message to those who take drugs is -- stick to methadone alone and you
will stay alive.''
Blood specimens from definite drug-related deaths are analysed at Dr
Oliver's laboratory, allowing comparisons to be drawn with the
therapeutic levels of the drugs present.
In 42 of the 95 deaths, methadone was present -- but always with other
drugs and usually heroin.
In 12 cases the methadone was significantly above the therapeutic
level and in a number of these it was present with high levels of
Temazepam. In one case the Temazepam was more than four times the
therapeutic level.

THE Prime Minister yesterday called Labour leader Tony Blair ''a
dimwit'' in unusually robust Commons exchanges on Europe.
Another novel feature was a demand from Mr Major that Mr Blair should
explain his party's policy to the House, reversing the normal order of
things at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Blair sought to exploit Cabinet divisions by quoting differing
ministerial views on British membership of a single European currency.
The Prime Minister made clear that the British Government plans to
require additional criteria to those accepted by its EU partners to be
met before even considering joining.
One, he said, would be comparable flexibility of labour markets.
Britain's comparatively flexible arrangements here look unlikely to be
in line with the continental trend towards greater regulation of
employment law.
However, Mr Major added that, some years in advance of having to take
a decision, ''it is unwise to say yes we will proceed or no, we will
never proceed.''
His answer was a further rebuke for Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan
Aitken, who said in an earlier interview that he would wait an eternity
before joining a single currency.
Mr Blair, cheered on by the Labour benches in an extremely noisy
session, said Conservative Central Office and Downing Street briefings
on where the Government stood had contradicted each other.
If Mr Major wouldn't ''slap down'' Mr Aitken would he say he agreed
with his Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, who was wanted to join a single
currency by the end of mthe century.
Mr Major retorted that 50 Labour MPs had defied their party whip on
Maastricht and 40 did so on the European Finance Bill. Labour had had
''seven twists and turns over recent years'' as to whether it was in
favour of EU or not.
He added that the Chancellor would set out the additional criteria the
Government wanted met in a speech later this week.
Mr Blair sought to pin him down by asking whether, if all the criteria
were met, the Government would join a single currency.
To Labour laughter and jeers, Mr Major replied that if they were ''we
will look and see whether it is appropriate and in the British interest
to join.''
Shouting to make himself heard above the din, he challenged Mr Blair:
''Will you tell us whether you would join -- yes or no?''
He added sharply: ''Do you know whether it would be in Britain's
interest? No, you don't. All you are concerned to do is to trail along
the path behind the Euro-federalists where you feel most happy.''
Although Mr Blair had used up the maximum of three questions the
Leader of the Opposition is traditionally permitted, the Speaker, Miss
Betty Boothroyd, allowed him to respond after observing, ''It is most
unusual for Prime Ministers to ask the Opposition questions.''
Mr Blair said: ''I think it is excellent that the Prime Minister is
getting into the habit of masking us questions rather than answering
them himself.''
He then told Mr Major, ''Until you decide where you stand on this
issue as the Prime Minister of the day, your leadership will remain
weak, your Cabinet divi ded, and Britain effectively disabled in
Europe.''
Mr Major replied: ''It is interesting to ask you questions. It would
be more interesting if you ever provided any answers.
''I have set out for you the conditions that would be right for us to
consider the interests of the UK.
''I am not going to make a judgment that is cruc al to the
constitutional future of this country until I see the economic
circumstances of the day .
''Frankly, only a dimwit would ask me to.''

Scottish Political Correspondent Robbie Dinwoodie
looks at the Scottish Office's new team problems
* Ian Lang
* Malcolm Rifkind
* Michael Forsyth
POLITICAL opponents could scarcely contain themselves yesterday from
scoring points over the demise of Allan Stewart, whose fate was sealed
from the minute a semi-comic confrontation with anti-motorway
campaigners turned more serious with the alleged breach of firearms
regulations by others present.
With the Procurator Fiscal by no means certain to proceed on the
incident as at first portrayed, it might have been possible to ride out
the storm but once the possibility of more serious charges loomed and a
highly publicised court case became likely, the Minister had little
choice but to resign in order to save the Government from further
embarrassment.
Scottish Liberal Democrats' leader Jim Wallace could not resist a joke
about Ministers in the past falling on their swords in contrast to ''the
first one to fall on his pick-axe''. He made a serious point, however,
about the resignation leaving ''a gap in a fairly lacklustre Scottish
Office team'' and highlighting the ''paucity of talent on the Scottish
Conservative benches''.
It has to be said that Mr Wallace had a point. John Major has a
fondness for cricket and its metaphors, and George Kynoch may indeed
bring a safe pair of hands to St Andrew's House.
But there is another set of sporting metaphors which make more sense.
The Scottish Tory XI have a handful of talented stars, but too many
other players are inexperienced, erratic, out of form or injured. There
are no substitutes on the bench. Could they even be forced to go across
the Border in search of Anglo talent?
Of the 11 Scottish Conservative MPs, two are already in the Cabinet,
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind. Home
Office Minister Michael Forsyth has also progressed up the ladder.
Transfer speculation is ripe involving these three high-fliers, but
there are good reasons why such moves are becoming increasingly
unlikely.
Then there is the Scottish Office team under Ian Lang as it now
stands. Minister of State Lord Fraser covers health and home affairs,
including constitutional matters, and covers Scottish affairs in the
House of Lords. Then there are three MPs -- Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
(education and housing); Sir Hector Monro (agriculture and the
environment, including arts and sport); and taking over Allan Stewart's
industry and local government beat, there is now George Kynoch.
The person Mr Kynoch beat to yesterday's promotion was probably
Aberdeen South MP Raymond Robertson, but at 35, thirteen years Mr
Kynoch's junior, he still has time on his side for advancement if he can
cling to his 1517 majority.
That leaves four others now deemed by most observers to be too
colourful or individualistic to be safe for Ministerial office. These
are Sir Nicholas Fairbairn (who, like Sir Hector Monro has announced
that he will not be standing again for Parliament); Bill Walker (the
eccentric North Tayside MP nicknamed Biggles); Phil Gallie (who is
hard-working to a fault but has never mastered the art of declining to
give an interview -- he was first yesterday to leap into regretting Mr
Stewart's resignation); and now Mr Stewart himself.
One of the biggest dangers now for the Government is that Mr Stewart
may revert to type as a Thatcherite, free market Euro-sceptic, true to
his origins in the Right-wing hotbed of St Andrews University. His
natural inclinations would certainly point to him as a Euro-rebel. These
were reined in during his time as a Minister, but he may feel no such
restraint now.
It is known that in recent years, with the Conservatives languishing
in the opinion polls in Scotland, there has been talk in senior party
circles about overcoming the difficulties of the lack of depth of the
pool of contenders for high office. Before support rallied at the last
General Election there were fears that the Tories could be reduced to
just a handful of MPs North of the Border.
There were private expressions of regret at that time that during the
years when Scottish Tory MPs were more numerous, and the move could not
have been attacked as desperation, the opportunity had not been taken to
make use of the talents of Scots serving English constituencies.
Establishing the principle then would have been useful for the future.
Among those who could now have been in the frame if this practice had
been established would have been:
* Michael Ancram (Devizes) who has previous Scottish Office experience
from his days as MP for Berwickshire and East Lothian and for Edinburgh
South, and who is currently attracting praise for his work at the
Northern Ireland Office. If a Member for Wiltshire can serve the good of
Ulster, why not of Scotland?
* David Maclean (Penrith and The Border), a native of Fortrose whose
current seat has geographical proximity in its favour.
* Eric Forth (Mid Worcestershire), a Glasgwegian, educated at
Jordanhill College School, who continues to take an interest in Scottish
matters from his Midlands seat.
* Gerald Malone (Winchester), another Glasgow man, the former MP for
Aberdeen South before finding a safer seat in the South and is currently
joint deputy chairman of the Conservative Party.
These are largely ''what if'' questions now, as the importing of an
Anglo-Scot to shore up the St Andrew's House administration would now be
seized on by opponents as the clearest possible indication that in terms
of political talent the Tory cupboard North of the Border is bare.
For the Liberal Democrats, Jim Wallace hinted at this yesterday, and
Labour's George Robertson made the case even more plainly: ''The likes
of Phil Gallie and Bill Walker would be regarded as a bit of a joke, but
better a joke than a full-blown crisis. If they put in MPs for English
constituencies it would be the clearest possible indication that they
were in such a crisis that they had no choice left.''
Another possible avenue for recycling useable material for a reshuffle
also has a snag. Lord MacKay -- former Argyll and Bute MP -- is another
Scottish political heavyweight sent to the Lords because the voters
rejected him. But he is a former Minister of State at the Scottish
Office and currently holds that post in the Lords, where he speaks on
Social Security matters.
It is impossible to see him taking a step sideways or down to return
to the Scottish Office and the precedent of filling St Andrew's House
with peple ennobled after being rejected by the electors is clearly a
dubious one.
All of this means that, in spite of recent rumours linking Michael
Forsyth with a return North as Secretary of State for Scotland -- facing
if need by the wrath of any Tory activists of whome he made enemies in
the past -- the likelihood of a reshuffle this side of a General
Election to give Ian Lang a fresh Cabinet challenge seem to be receding.
''Events seem to have contrived to box in Ian Lang quite severely,''
said one source last night.

TRACK access charges for the Fort William sleeper disclosed by the
Transport Secretary are an accountancy ''con'' and pose a threat to
rural rail services across Britain, Labour claimed last night.
In a Commons debate on the railways, Labour Transport spokesman Brian
Wilson said the figures were further proof of the damage being visited
on the railways by privatisation.
Dr Brian Mawhinney said on Monday that the subsidy per passenger on
the threatened sleeper service amounted to #540, including #360 in
infrastructure costs.
Last night, the Transport Secretary repeated his pledge to
reinvigorate the railways with private finance, and emphasised that
recently announced minimum service requirements on English routes were
''not cast in stone''.
Mr Wilson questioned the Fort William subsidy figures, and added:
''The really startling revelation is that track access charges imposed
by Railtrack account for two-thirds of the supposed subsidy.
''Inherent in these figures is a threat to every rural service in
Britain, for the simple fact is that none of them can carry track
charges on this scale without being made to look helplessly
uneconomic.''
Track access charges are what private train operators will have to pay
to Railtrack, which owns the infrastructure, to run their trains. The
level of access charges has not yet been announced by the Government.
Critics warn that if they are too high potential operators will refuse
to get involved in privatisation. Labour claims high access charges are
a way of cutting services.
Mr Wilson said: ''It does not take a genius to see the next step.
These costs will then fall disproportionately on the remaining sleeper
services. Within months, they will be made to look as uneconomic as the
Fort William service does now, according to Dr Mawhinney.''
Opening the debate, Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher accused
Dr Mawhinney of breaking a series of promises, including to privatise
Railtrack last -- it has been brought forward -- and to hold private
operators to the existinmg timetable.
Last week, the Government announced that the minimum requirements in
some franchises would be up to 50% less than the current service. Mr
Meacher said: ''It is clear he knew and assented to these minimum
standards.''
The first round of minimum requirements announced last week were only
the first sign of further cuts, Mr Meacher said. ''Today, we have seen
their scalpel. In future, we shall certainly see the axe.''
He added that privatisation was ''marked by almost universal
opposition in the country.'' If it continued, Labour would do everything
to stop it.
In reply, Dr Mawhinney said that privatisation would transform the
railways by introducing private finance, investment and management
skills, and reverse the decline of a nationalised industry.
''I am determined to reverse that sad decline and to see our railways
revitalised; delivering the services that the passenger wants rather
than what the network chooses to provide,'' he said.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Charles Kennedy called the decision to
axe Motorail services and sleeper services to Fort William a ''grotesque
breach of faith''.
He claimed the move was an ''abuse of guidelines'' in the Government's
own legislation and amounted to ''contempt of the consultative
process''.
In closing the debate, Railways Minister John Watts rejected these
claims, saying that Mr Roger Salmon, the franchising director, had
decided to make the announcement last December in order ''to be as open
as possible about our network policy intentions.''
The Labour attack on the Government's privatisation plans was rejected
by 302 votes to 265, a majority of 37.

LABOUR Party officials have ordered a rerun of a candidate selection
meeting in Edinburgh after irregularities in the first process.
Deputy Lord Provost John Wilson failed to get a seconder for his
nomination for the Kaimes seat at a meeting on Tuesday. The sole nominee
for the seat on the new council which will replace the existing regional
and district authorities, regional council economic development chairman
Mr Donald Anderson, was adopted on a 10-3 vote.
However, it later transpired the meeting went ahead 25 minutes earlier
than scheduled. Mr Wilson, who represents the existing Kaimes ward, said
he had queried the result with district party officials who had now
asked for the selection meeting to be recalled.
He said he was denied access to the list of branch members eligible to
take part and was told only four such members could vote.
The majority of votes cast on Tuesday were by executive members of the
Edinburgh South Constituency Labour Party, as is set down in party
selection rules if the branch itself cannot make a quorum of 12.
Mr Wilson, a councillor for the last 19 years, said he was satisified
with the decision to recall the meeting. ''It was agreed that there were
some irregularities and this has given me the opportunity to have
another kick of the ball,'' he added.
''I merely queried the decision. I have not put in a formal appeal and
I don't know if I will or not.''
The selection procedures have led to a number of casualties because
there are far fewer seats on the new councils.
The latest is a former Labour Party chairman in Scotland and former
leader of Edinburgh District Council, Councillor Mark Lazarowicz. He
lost out to Councillor Steve Cardownie, present convener of Edinburgh's
leisure and recreation committee, for the candidacy for Newhaven.

<HEADLINE>Appeal to save the corncrake gets off to a flier</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979960013</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NATURE lovers have come to the rescue of a mysterious little bird
which is on the verge of extinction in Scotland.
Wildlife conservationists were so concerned about the plight of the
corncrake they launched a nationwide appeal for money to help save the
bird's vital habitat and try to restore its dwindling numbers.
After five months, concerned people have donated more than #300,000 to
help put the bird back at the top of the conservation pecking order.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said they were delighted
with the response to the appeal.
The corncrake is one of Europe's most endangered species. With modern
farming techniques largely responsible for its dramatic decline, RSPB
officials introduced cash incentives for crofters to set aside
corncrake-friendly areas to give the remaining numbers a chance to breed
successfully.
The secretive bird is now found primarily in the Inner and Outer
Hebrides, having been wiped out in Northern Ireland where no pairs bred
last year.
A summer visitor, it traditionally breeds in hay meadows and although
rarely seen, is recognised by the male's distinctive ''crek-crek'' call.
RSPB chiefs said it would cost around #250,000 a year to mount the
rescue campaign.
They hope to repeat the success associated with the island of Coll,
where, with a special reserve purchased in 1991, they were able to
increase the number of males from five to 18 last year.
The cash fund will allow the society to encourage more crofters to
help the bird's survival by delaying grass mowing times. Crofters are
paid to delay cutting hay until July 31 to give fledgelings time to
leave the nesting spot.
RSPB chief executive Ms Barbara Young was confident the appeal fund
would help to guarantee the bird's survival.
She said: ''If the corncrake can be saved in the UK, then similar
declines in other countries can be halted too. The success of this work
and the ultimate survival of the species depends of this type of
funding.
''This once common bird is now on the verge of extinction in the UK,
having vanished already from Northern Ireland, but the early results
from Coll give us a ray of hope.''

<HEADLINE>Cunard to 'vigorously' fight Christmas cruise claims</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979960014</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CUNARD said last night that it would vigorously defend a multi-million
dollar legal claim launched in America following the ill-fated QE2
''Christmas cruise from Hell''.
The action, on behalf of more than 120 American and European
passengers, demands that a $50m (#30m) fund be set up to cover potential
health claims.
It also includes individual claims for $100,000 (#70,000) in
compensation for each passenger in the action.
During the transatlantic passage, there were complaints of
''Niagaras'' of dirty brown water in toilets, corridors blocked by
''unsecured materials'' and a fenced-off swimming pool.
The ship was impounded by coastguards in New York who insisted certain
work should be completed before the liner continued her cruise to the
Caribbean.
However, allegations that passengers were exposed to asbestos and
other toxic fumes are central to the demand for the main fund to be
established.
The complaint was brought before the New York State trial court of
general jurisdiction on Monday by leading US maritime lawyer Paul
Edelman.
Cunard spokesman Eric Flounders said half the British passengers on
board had already accepted full refunds for the cruise and the offer of
another trip this year of the same value, plus spending money.
''We have appointed solicitors and will defend it vigorously,'' he
said.
''I think it is generally accepted in this country -- by a lot of
press editorials and the travel industry, as well as the passengers --
that the compensation package we have offered is not only very fair but
very generous.''
Mr Edelman said that half the passengers in the action were from
Britain or mainland Europe.
He said he was working with lawyer Christina Hall from Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, who had been on the cruise, and had been approached
by many passengers who wanted to take the matter further.
''It is our understanding that passengers were exposed to asbestos and
other toxic substances,'' Mr Edelman claimed.
Two British passengers from the cruise had mixed reactions yesterday
to news of the court action.
David Steene described the compensation claim as ''ridiculous,
outrageous and greedy beyond words''.
Mr Steene said he had settled with Cunard, receiving a refund and
compensation for out-of-pocket expenses.
Another passenger, Peter Ludlow, who sailed on the ship to New York
and then on to the Caribbean with his fiancee Merrilyn Wesley, said the
offer of an #8000 refund plus a voucher of the same value to spend on a
future Cunard cruise was unsatisfactory.
He said that because the Christmas cruise was bought at a special
discounted rate, the voucher offer would only pay for ''a much shorter
cruise -- and it pre-supposes that we want to travel with Cunard
again''.

<TEXT>
THE drafting of parts of next year's Budget could be privatised under
plans disclosed last night by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
He said he was giving ''serious thought'' to farming out sections of
the Finance Bill to lawyers in the private sector.
In a speech to the European Policy Forum in London, he emphasised that
all that was being considered was a pilot scheme. However, it could
bring important benefits across Whitehall, widening the range of talents
available to departments and easing the pressures on the existing
draftsmen.
His proposals were dismissed by Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, who
said: ''What we have is more and more lawyers. Mr Clarke would be better
off if he simplified the taxation system and gave people a better
deal.''
Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First
Division Civil Servants, said: ''We take a very serious view of the
proposal and we will be raising the issue at the highest possible
levels.''

<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979960016</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SOILED bank notes continued to reappear in circulation after they
should have been incinerated, the High Court in Glasgow was told
yesterday.
Bank worker Mrs Linda McKechnie, 37, was so concerned that she began
marking some of the old notes being sent for burning.
She told Lord Prosser and a jury these notes also returned to the
Clydesdale Bank in Glasgow. Notes sent from Edinburgh to be burned were
marked with a large cross, she said, but they returned also.
She told the Court how she helped weed out the notes to be
incinerated.
She said: ''I thought there was something wrong and I put my initials
on them, but some kept coming back every month.''
She told her boss, Mr Hector MacGillivray, 54, but she said he told
her there was ''nothing sinister'' about it and to get on with her work.
Mr MacGillivray, 54, a senior bank manager, of Thomson Drive,
Bearsden, denies embezzling #163,000 over 20 years while in charge of
the cash burning centre.
He allegedly confessed to police, during a tape-recorded interview,
that he pocketed the money from the bank's ''burning boxes,'' taking up
to #600 a week.
He is alleged to have made his ''confession'' while police were
investigating an unrelated theft from the bank.
The court also heard how some notes which had holes bored in them
before burning also turned up back in circulation.
Bank worker Mrs Margaret Porteous told how bundles of old notes were
weighed before burning.
She claimed Mr MacGillivray told her to ignore the fact some some of
them were underweight.
She saw him often alone, against the unwritten bank guidelines, in the
vault where the notes were stored, she said.
Up to #40m a week went through the cash centre, the court heard, and
there was a shortfall of up to #14,000 a year.
The jury heard how Mr MacGillivray claimed to have inherited old notes
kept in a wardrobe.
The trial continues.

<RECORDNO>979960017</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SHETLAND councillors have dropped plans to axe a ferry service after
outrage from islanders.
The service to Fetlar was under threat as Shetland Islands Council
considered ways to make huge cuts on future budgets.
More than 40 of the 104-strong population of the island had intended
to be at a council transport meeting in Lerwick yesterday -- but they
were unable to get off the island because their boat was put on another
route to replace a broken ferry.
A handful of former Fetlar residents and other islanders were in the
council chamber.
The message was delivered loud and clear by councillor for North Yell
and Fetlar, Brian Gregson, who told his colleagues that removing the
Fetlar service was an ''outrageous'' suggestion, which would lead to
depopulation.
The islanders have been lobbying hard for the past fortnight, since
the council's ferries sub-committee voted to abandon the Fetlar service.
However, there was not one voice of support for that plan yesterday so
the matter will not go forward to the full council.
Instead, savings will be made by raising charges on the ferries.
Councillors felt it was fairer to spread the burden over all the islands
rather than targeting one service.

<TEXT>
THE Government and Sinn Fein are edging closer to full negotiations.
The two sides will get together to discuss the British and Irish
framework document, provided good progress continues in exploratory
dialogue with senior civil servants at Stormont, the Northern Ireland
Office said last night.
This looks like the clearest sign yet since the start of the IRA
ceasefire that historic talks between Ministers and republican leaders
might not be far away.
The framework document which will form the basis of all-party talks on
the future of Northern Ireland is expected to be published within the
next few weeks.
However, the Government is still demanding the IRA get rid of its
weapons.
Meanwhile, the Dail, the lower house of the Irish parliament, last
night approved the lifting of the country's State of Emergency.
The move permits the proposal to go for ratification to the upper
house today.
Replying to a debate on the move, deputy Irish Premier and Foreign
Minister Dick Spring visibly intensified the tone of Dublin government
pressure on Britain to react to the current terrorist ceasefire in
Northern Ireland.
Apparently referring to Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act, Mr
Spring said: ''We hope they (the British government) will now consider
whether they need -- in the circumstances which now prevail -- to
maintain on the statute book legislation which has proved controversial,
but which was defended on the basis of the exigencies of the
situation.''
Northern Ireland's rival Unionist parties could be preparing to form a
new pact to resist British and Irish proposals for cross-border
institutions.
Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley said he had had talks with Mr
James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, to discuss opposition to
the north-south bodies.
It is believed to be the first time the two have been in official
contact since the parties clashed angrily over the Downing Street peace
declaration.
Mr Paisley, who has asked to see the Prime Minister to protest at the
British and Irish framework document, hinted that some form of alliance
is being considered.
* Irish police yesterday uncovered thousands of rounds of Russian-made
heavy machine gun ammunition that could have been used by terrorists to
shoot down Army helicopters.
The 12,000 rounds, described as the biggest such find since the IRA's
ceasefire declaration, was for use in a number of Russian-made heavy
machine guns which were smuggled to Ireland from Libya in the mid-1980s,
police said.
A number of men were being questioned by police last night.

HOME Office files on the war-time interrogation of British fascist
leader Sir Oswold Mosley are being withheld from the Public Record
Office for reasons of political sensitivity or national security.
Reports on the 16-hour interrogation that led to Sir Oswald's
internment in July 1940 were excluded from archives on the British Union
of Fascists, made available yesterday under Mr Major's open government
initiative.
The released files, originally withheld for 100 years but now
published after pressure -- notably from Labour MPs -- analyse the
support and likely direction of extreme right-wing groups who attracted
considerable backing before the war.
Sir Oswald, who died in 1980, was the founder of the British Union. He
was jailed without trial for his open admiration for fascist figures
Hitler and Mussolini.
Lady Mosley, Sir Oswald's widow, has campaigned for more than 10 years
for the release of the interrogation documents, hoping they would show
his imprisonment -- under the Government's wartime emergency regulations
-- was unjust and unfair.
She says her husband was assured he was being imprisoned not because
it was thought he would help Germany, but because he was in favour of a
negotiated peace.

A REGULAR drugs dealer at the Hanger 13 nightclub had run out of
ecstasy tablets the night two young men took ill and later died, a fatal
accident inquiry heard yesterday.
Yet a visitor who had travelled to the Ayr club from Airdrie for a
rave was able to buy drugs from ''the first person I asked''.
The inquiry at Ayr Sheriff Court was told by Mr Scott Deas, 21, of
Waverley Drive, Airdrie, that he had been a regular attender at Hanger
13 for more than a year, but he had not returned since the deaths of two
men on May 1 last year.
Mr Deas told Mr James Kelman, the procurator-fiscal depute, that he
had wanted to buy ecstasy and had approached a man from whom he had
bought the drug in the past.
''I saw this guy that I knew and had bought ecstasy from before. We
had been waiting in the queue for about two and a half hours and he told
me he had run out,'' he added.
Mr Kelman: ''Did you get ecstasy from someone else?'' Mr Deas: ''Aye,
from just about the first person I asked.''
He said that he had paid about #12 each for two tablets from a man in
the corridor of the nightclub, and he agreed with Sheriff Neil Gow, QC,
that he would have tried to avoid being seen by stewards.
Mr Deas was speaking on the second day of an inquiry into the deaths
of Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and Mr Andrew Dick,
19, from Glasgow on May 1 last year and of Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, from
Rigside, Lanarkshire, on August 21. All three men took ill after
attending raves at Hanger 13 and died in Ayr Hospital.
He said that he had taken one tablet -- known as a white dove because
of its distinctive markings -- and had felt unwell on the way home with
his friend.
Mr Deas added: ''I was feeling sick, my hands and fingers were tingly
and I had hallucinations.'' He was admitted to Monklands District
General Hospital the next day and spent three days being treated.
He said that he had continued taking ecstasy tablets despite his
experience.
Asked by Mr Jack Drummond, uncle of the late Andrew Stoddart who is
representing the family, if he could explain how people could have
supplies of drugs for sale inside the club despite thorough door
searches by stewards, he replied: ''I don't know.''
Mrs Helen Dick, 43, of Auckland Street, Glasgow, broke down in tears
as she told of hearing from police on the Monday after her son's visit
to Hanger 13 that he had died. ''I thought he was with a girl in
Paisley, I had no idea he had gone to Ayr,'' she said.
Miss Jacqueline Brown, 19, of Auckland Street, Glasgow said she had
gone to Hanger 13 on April 30 by taxi with Andrew Dick, her second
cousin, and that she had taken an an ecstasy tablet she bought for #10.
Mr Alan Brown, 16, of Auckland Street, admitted to being drunk on the
night of the rave, but said he did not take drugs. He agreed with Mr
Drummond that there was no check made of his age on entry to the club.
Mr Derek Bryson, 19, of Killearn Street, Glasgow, spoke of seeing
Andrew Dick near the end of the night. Asked about Mr Dick's apparent
condition he replied: ''He was full of it. He was not in a very stable
way. He was full of drugs and staggering about a bit.''
Mr James Colvin, 52, a retired ambulance technician, of Firbank, Ayr,
said that he and a colleague responded to two 999 calls within the space
of two hours at Hanger 13 in the early hours of May 1 last year.
He said that at 2.25am they returned to the club for a second
unconscious patient in similar circumstances. From ambulance records Mr
Colvin confirmed that the first patient was John Nisbet and the second
Andrew Dick.
The inquiry continues.

ABERDEEN District Council might be forced to scrap an #8m contract
awarded to its in-house contract services division and put it out to
re-tender.
The controversy surrounds a four-year ground maintenance contract for
the south of the city which was awarded in September.
Following a complaint from one of the unsuccessful contractors, the
Scottish Office has issued a Section 13 order on the council and it has
until Friday to answer the order's allegation of ''anti-competitive
behaviour''.
The council has denied the allegation.
The council's arts and recreation committee had three tenders which it
said had been fully evaluated with the assistance of external
consultants.
Following the award of the contract to the contract services division,
Councillor Margaret Farquhar, the leader of the council's
administration, said that one of the three had asked the council to
allow them to withdraw its tender and this had been agreed.
She said that the other two bids had been extremely competitive and
very close to each other.
She admitted that the in-house bid was slightly higher than the
unsuccessful tender, but that the difference was less than 1% of the
total cost of the four-year contract.
The committee had taken into consideration the costs to the council
which would be involved in changing contractors and the disruption it
would cause to the service.
In deciding to award the contract to the CSD, it had also considered
the worry it would cause to the existing workforce.
''We also know that the work of our contract service division on
ground maintenance has been excellent over many years,'' she said.
Councillor George Urquhart, the arts and recreation committee
convener, said at the time the committee had looked forward to
maintaining Aberdeen as Scotland's most beautiful city in Scotland.
Yesterday a Scottish Office spokesman confirmed that it had issued a
Section 13 to Aberdeen District Council on January 13, following an
allegation of anti-competitive behaviour.
The spokesman said that the council had to prove that its actions were
not anti-competitive and that, if the tender accepted was not the
lowest, then it had to give good reason for awarding it to the
successful bidder.
A spokesman for Aberdeen District Council said last night: ''We are
writing to the Secretary of State refuting any suggestion that we are in
breach of the rules and therefore we believe there is no case to take
any sanctions against us.''
If the Scottish Secretary does not accept the council's argument, the
contract may be put out to tender again.
The council is also facing problems over another #23m contract awarded
to its contract services division.
The city's binmen are to ballot on strike action, over the loss of 17
of their 210 jobs, which they believed were safeguarded when the
contract was awarded in September, at the second round of tendering.
The council have admitted that proper consultation was not carried out
before the contract was awarded, but that it would be unlawful to change
it.

RUSSIAN human rights campaigner Yelena Bonner told a UN Commission
today that Russia's military had committed massive violations of
international law and accords in Chechnya.
The most serious offence was the disproportionate use of military
force against the civilian population, she told the Commission of Human
Rights in Geneva.
Bonner, a former Soviet dissident and widow of Nobel Peace Prize
winner Andrei Sakharov, said other offences included destruction of
Grozny, bombardment of crowded areas, arbitrary executions, and looting
and robbery by Russian soldiers.

<TEXT>
A DEFENCE witness at the High Court in Inverness changed his evidence
yesterday and admitted handling nearly #48,000 of amphetamine.
Mr Allan Wade, 34, initially denied knowledge of the drugs.
However, after being granted immunity from prosecution on drugs
charges by advocate-depute Iain Bonomy, QC, he changed his evidence at
the trial of Mr Gary Follen, of Glenlia, Foyers.
Mr Follen, 34, who is unemployed, denies being concerned in the supply
of amphetamine at his house and elsewhere between January 1 and March 23
last year. He has lodged a special defence of incrimination, naming Mr
Wade, of Kanachrine Place, Ullapool.
Mr Follen also denies growing cannabis in his house.
The court heard the amphetamines were found in two ice cream
containers wrapped in bags and a bin liner by a track near Mr Follen's
home.
Sergeant Andrew Walker, 36, told the court the amount of amphetamine
found was 3915g with a value of just under #48,000.
Mr Wade said he had known Mr Follen for five or six years and had
arrived unannounced at his house only to find he was out.
Defence advocate Ian Duguid asked: ''Do you know anything about
amphetamine being in the house that night?' Mr Wade said: ''No, nothing
at all.''
Under cross-examination, Mr Bonomy repeated to Mr Wade that he could
give evidence immune from prosecution on drugs charges and possibly help
Mr Follen.
He then asked: ''Did you handle #48,000 worth of amphetamine?'' After
a brief silence, Mr Wade replied: ''Yes.''
He then told the trial he had taken the drugs to Mr Follen's empty
house and used scales to divide it into 56 amounts.
The drugs arrived in Inverness from a dealer in the central belt whom
he was unable to name, he said . He added he concealed the drugs on a
hillock near the house.
Earlier, in his own evidence, Mr Follen said he could not explain how
his own fingerprints were found on one of the ice cream containers, or
on a black bin liner it was in.
He denied the accusation from Mr Bonomy that he had incriminated Mr
Wade as a ''scapegoat'' to cloud the issue.
The trial continues.

Grozny, Tuesday
RUSSIAN forces today said they had seized more of the rebel Chechen
capital Grozny and one rebel said his commanders were on the point of
abandoning their defence of the battered city.
''Our headquarters is now deciding whether or not to give up the
city,'' said Sulman, a 22-year-old fighter in the southern Grozny suburb
of Chernorechiye.
However he stressed that resistance would be waged from other parts of
Chechnya, declaring: ''This is just the beginning. We will fight to the
end.''
Meanwhile, the Russian-led government which Moscow wants to install in
the breakaway republic will decide tomorrow if it can safely move into
Grozny.
Beslan Gantemirov, the former and, if Russia has its way, future mayor
of Grozny, said that the move should take place by tomorrow.
The administration is headed by Nikolai Semyonov, a Russian. His three
deputies, all Chechens, lead the anti-Dudayev opposition in the
Caucasian region.
The administration has repeatedly said it will move to Grozny but the
furious Russian bombardment and stubborn resistance have prevented them
from leaving their headquarters in Znamenskoye, a part of northern
Chechnya untouched by the bitter struggle.
Russia sent thousands of troops to Chechnya in December to crush the
rebel region's independence bid. A massive air and land onslaught on
Grozny which began on New Year's Eve has left the city in ruins and
killed many inhabitants.
In Moscow, Defence Ministry officials told Interfax news agency that
the Russian army, which bore the brunt of fighting over the last two
months, was preparing to withdraw most troops and leave Interior
Ministry forces and police in charge.
Significantly fewer Chechen fighters entered Grozny during the day and
no armoured vehicles could be seen, a clear sign that the defenders were
scaling down their fight.
Some of those leaving Grozny said battles were still continuing around
the crucial Minutka Square, focus of Chechen resistance.
The Ministry said that its troops had liberated Minutka. However
shells were still falling around the area at the rate of two or three a
minute in the afternoon -- still considerably less than on previous
days.
Chechen commanders acknowledge that they have no chance of holding out
forever against the Russians, but Moscow military officials say that the
town of Gudermes, 25 miles east of Grozny with strong fortifications and
an estimated 5000 fighters, is likely to become the next centre of
resistance.
There were signs of increasing frustration in the Russian ranks as a
hard-line Soviet-era general, who helped enforce Moscow's last big army
crackdown in the Caucusus region, blasted the Chechnya campaign, saying
the army had learned nothing from past successes.
Vladislav Achalov, who commanded paratroopers in the Soviet operation
to install a state of emergency in the Azerbaijan capital Baku in 1990,
said the Chechnya operation was poorly planned, badly timed, and
conducted by ill-trained troops.
''I have the impression from all this that nobody has ever taught
anybody anything,'' Achalov told Sevodnya newspaper.
Increasingly bitter by the turn of events, the soldiers are beginning
to speak out and reveal an army that is dangerously divided and
rebellious.
''We are fighting here not for (President Boris) Yeltsin and (Defence
Minister Pavel) Grachev. If I could, I would shoot them myself,'' said a
marine major from Vladivostok. ''We are fighting for the honour of our
army, for the honour of the marines.''
The major sounded a common theme, speaking of soldiers who want to
fight to clear the name of an army humiliated by fierce resistance and
other unexpected problems.
''At first Russia's army was lost, but now everybody wants to fight,''
he said. ''Marines and soldiers come to me and ask me to send them to
Grozny. If we have to, we will kill everybody here in Chechnya we will
fight to the end . . . if the politicians stop us, we will strike the
Kremlin.''
Others expressed anger, disillusionment, and the wish to justify or
avenge the deaths of many of their comrades.
''I have been to Angola and Afghanistan and those were like child's
play compared to Grozny,'' said a lieutenant colonel in the paratroops.
''Here, it's like a slaughterhouse.''--Reuter/AP.

A SHERIFF has called for psychiatric reports on a former Boys' Brigade
officer who took pictures of young boys posing in the nude after setting
up his own boys' club.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard how David Porter, 39, allowed some of the
youngsters attending his camps to drink cider and lager before
photographing them and encouraging them to take pictures of each other.
Porter, a self-employed salesman, had earlier pleaded guilty to
conducting himself in an indecent manner at various addresses in Argyll
and Renfrewshire between 1985 and 1993 by taking or causing photographs
of an indecent manner to be taken of 23 boys aged between 11 and 14.
The court had called for social enquiry reports and a community
service assessment, but when Porter appeared for sentence yesterday, his
case was again continued after social workers claimed in their report
that he was a risk to children.
Porter's defence agent denied the claim and said her client, who had
spent many years working with young people, always had their best
interests at heart.
The solicitor said Porter, who is divorced and lives with his mother,
had only allowed some of the boys who attended his camps to consume
alcohol under his supervision after he discovered they had sneaked drink
in to the camp themselves.
The court heard how Porter had at times taken young people on camps
who had been under social work department supervision.
Sheriff Charles Stoddart said he was concerned at some of the comments
of the social worker who had compiled the background report on the
accused, as there was a stark difference between the author's perception
of Porter and that given by his lawyer.
He said as the psychiatric option had not been examined, the case
should be continued for a further three weeks for a psychiatric report.
Porter was released on bail on the special condition that he did not
have any contact with the boys involved or have anything to do with the
running of the boys' club.
Porter was ordered to return to court for sentence on February 27.

New York, Tuesday
BEFORE Spencer Tracy, actress Katharine Hepburn's great love was
director John Ford, but Ford's Roman Catholic beliefs prevented him from
divorcing his wife, according to a new biography on Hepburn.
Excerpts from the biography Katharine Hepburn, by Barbara Leaming,
also give the most detailed account yet of the suicide of Hepburn's
brother Tom and suggests it affected her relationships with men. The
excerpts are published in the March edition of Vanity Fair magazine.
The author wrote that although it had often been reported that Hepburn
did not wish to marry again after her first marriage, she did in fact
desperately want to marry Ford.
''Mary Ford warned her husband that she would take custody of his
beloved daughter, Barbara, if he ran off with Kate,'' Vanity Fair quoted
from the biography.
''Jack is very religious, he'll never divorce me,'' Mary once said,
according to the biography. ''I'm going to be Mrs Ford until I die.''
The book recalls a history of suicide in the Hepburn family. Her
father's brother jumped from a window to his death and her mother's
father and uncle shot themselves.
It said that Katharine Hepburn had broken open a locked attic door to
discover her dead brother Tom and would sleep in the hallway outside
Tracy's hotel room while he was on drinking binges. The author wrote
that Hepburn believed that that way she would be there if Tracy needed
her, as she had not been to save her brother.--Reuter.

CARDS containing telephone numbers vital to victims of domestic
violence are being issued to women in Glasgow's South Side, backed by
the Co-operative Bank.
The cards have been produced in a partnership between the Strathclyde
Zero Tolerance Campaign and the private sector to encourage battered
women to seek help.
They list the phone numbers of organisations such as Women's Aid and
the Homeless Persons' Unit, and will be given out by voluntary groups.
They will also be available through the Co-op Bank, libraries, housing
offices and local community halls in Govan, Pollok, Cambuslang and
Rutherglen.
An Asian language version of the card is planned.
The cards were the idea of the city council's women's committee and
were produced with the south-west and south-east area management
committees which helped meet the costs.
Councillor Louise Fyfe, convener of the women's committee, said:
''These cards are really a very positive way of helping.''
Katie Cosgrove, an organiser of the Zero Tolerance campaign said: ''We
are 100% behind this idea.''

Washington, Tuesday
A DOZEN witnesses so far have stood up in a Long Island court and
identified Colin Ferguson as the man who killed six people and wounded
at least 20 others on a train in 1993. One of the witnesses jumped on
the gunman and grabbed his gun while he was reloading.
Police then arrested Colin Ferguson, who is now conducting his own
defence. He has refused the services of several prominent lawyers who
contend that he is psychotic, delusional, and incompetent. The judge
disagreed, saying he was competent to stand trial and could therefore
defend himself.
Ferguson claims a white man stole his gun and shot all those people.
He says he was arrested because the police are racist (he is a black
Jamaican).
He has watched a lot of television and knows all the moves.
''Objection, your honour, hearsay,'' he exclaims. ''I put it to you,''
he admonishes a witness, ''that Colin Ferguson was completely
innocent.'' He refers to himself in the third person.
''No,'' the witness replies, ''I saw you shoot a man in the head.''
This has happened with every witness.
The man who jumped on the gunman was certain of the identification. No
witness has the slightest doubt that Ferguson is the murderer, and
no-one in court, except the judge, has the slightest doubt that he is
nuts.
His former lawyers, and a great number of others, too, say that the
trial is a travesty and the judge should never have allowed it to take
place. But this is America, where Jeffrey Dahmer, who admitted to
cannibalism and necrophilia and kept fragments of his victims' bodies in
his refrigerator, was ruled sane.
The rule of who is sane and who is not was permanently biased when
John Hinckley, who shot Ronald Reagan in 1981, was declared insane. He
was in love with a film star and wanted to impress her. That seemed to
the jury a pretty clear sign of lunacy and they judged him innocent by
reason of insanity.
There was an immense public outcry, and the rules were tightened
sharply. It is now very difficult indeed, even for demonstrable
psychotics, to be declared incompetent to stand trial.
So Mr Ferguson is on trial, televised, and may very well take the
stand himself when the time comes to present his defence next week.
Meanwhile, Hinckley is still in St Elizabeth's asylum here.

Houston, Tuesday
THE former owner of a Houston jet fuels company has sued Mark
Thatcher, alleging the son of former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher
helped defraud him out of his company.
John Laughlin is seeking $7m (#4.6m) plus punitive damages from Mr
Thatcher and five other defendants including Mr Thatcher's lawyers,
Dallas-based law firm Akin, Gump, in a state court suit involving the
now bankrupt Ameristar Fuels Corp, founded by Mr Laughlin in 1990.
Mr Laughlin's suit alleges that Mr Thatcher and the other defendants
''have participated in a conspiracy to defraud Laughlin and obtain
ownership and control of his interests in the Ameristar companies''.
The suit alleges that ''this conspiracy has included the use of mail
fraud, wire fraud, tax fraud, bankruptcy fraud, money laundering, usury,
common-law fraud, deceptive trade practices, perjury, theft and assault
to accomplish its ends''.
Mr Thatcher, who lives in Dallas, and the other defendants could not
be reached for comment. However Mr Thatcher denied wrongdoing in
comments attributed to him by the BBC's Newsnight on Monday.
According to Mr Laughlin's suit, investor David Wallace, also a
defendant in the suit, agreed to acquire 20% of Ameristar in 1992 for
500,000 dollars (#333,000) and assumed control of accounting and
finance.
The suit alleges that Mr Wallace had indicated during the negotiations
that Mr Thatcher would merely be assisting him with financing.
''However, the events subsequent to the investment demonstrate that
Wallace was a mere nominee for Thatcher,'' the suit charges, alleging
that ''all of Wallace's actions were taken with the knowledge and at the
behest of Thatcher''.
The lawsuit charges that in the year after Mr Wallace's investment, Mr
Laughlin was excluded from management decisions. It says that payments
were made to a holding company allegedly owned by Mr Wallace and Mr
Thatcher for management services never rendered.
Mr Wallace later raised his stake to 50%, claiming Ameristar was
experiencing financial problems, the suit alleges.
The suit says the alleged conspiracy culminated in Mr Laughlin's
sacking in January last year and the termination of his ownership stake
after a merger of various Ameristar subsidiaries into a holding company.
After he was sacked, according to the suit, Mr Laughlin was assaulted
and removed from Ameristar premises by Mr Thatcher's bodyguard and a
Houston police officer.
Later that day, Mr Thatcher and others rifled Mr Laughlin's desk and
stole papers inside, the suit alleges.
Three Ameristar companies filed for bankruptcy in August 1994, with
bankruptcy papers showing Ameristar's net worth had fallen from $2m
(#1.3m) at the time of Wallace's investment to a negative $6m (-#4m),
according to the suit.
Mr Thatcher told the BBC he was never involved in Ameristar's daily
operations. He and Mr Wallace blamed Mr Laughlin for the losses and said
he deceived them.
The suit comes several days before Lady Thatcher's scheduled
appearance in Houston tomorrow for a fund-raiser with actor Charlton
Heston in support of the American Air Museum in London.

<HEADLINE>Council's #35m 'in reserve'</HEADLINE>

MORE than #35m of cash reserves are sloshing around Glasgow District
Council's bank account, according to senior Tory Councillors.
They accused the city's Labour administration yesterday of creaming
the money off the budgets of various council departments to prepare a
spending sweetener for this year's local government elections.
In a strong attack, Conservative Group leader Bill Aitken said: ''The
Labour administration has systematically ripped off Glasgow Council
taxpayers. By overbudgeting in previous years they are saving for a
rainy electoral day.''
Bailie Aitken said the cash could be used to cut the council tax paid
by Glasgow's citizens in half next year.
''It would be irresponsible to use all the money to do this and we
will recommend no increase in the council tax. But these reserves show
the extent of over budgeting which has existed in anticipation of the
unitary authority elections.
''The Government grant settlement to Glasgow is not generous, but one
has to look at Ian Lang's position. In the city's case he sees #35m in
the current account representing almost 50% of the amount to be met by
the council tax.''
Councillor John Young, honorary chairman of the Scottish Association
of Conservative Councillors, said: ''The Labour administration says the
wicked Tory Government is cutting their grant when in reality the
council has more money than it needs.''
Mr Jimmy Andrews, Glasgow's director of finance, confirmed the
council's accounts showed a surplus of #35m, but said some of the money
had already been reallocated.
''We are going to use almost #9m of that during the course of the
94/95 financial year. On Friday the council will be considering what
level of spending there will be in 95/96.''
Mr Andrews said the auditor in his report to the council had
encouraged the council to consider using the surpluses.
On whether the amount was excessive Mr Andrews said: ''It all depends
on how you look at it.
''It is not unusually high when this council's budget is around
#700m.''
Glasgow Labour leader councillor Pat Lally poured scorn on the
Conservatives attack. ''They know perfectly well that it is not the case
that we have been overbudgeting.
''They know that we have reserves some of which we have used. We have
always considered that it is essential to maintain reserves for
emergencies for example when the Government allows no growth for wage
increases that take place.
''We have bills coming in from Strathclyde Region on the poll tax
which must be met from reserves. Prudent management of the budget
requires you to maintain reserves.''
Glasgow's councillors will set the city's budget for next year at a
meeting later this week. The Conservative group is advocating no
increase in the council tax but suggesting tourists and visitors pay to
enter the city's museums and art galleries.
Bailie Aitken added''Glasgow provides an excellent museum service but
we spend #14m a year providing this service largely to visitors who
contribute nothing to the council tax.
''I do not think there is anything wrong with asking visitors from
overseas or indeed from surrounding areas to contribute towards this
substantial expenditure.''

New York, Tuesday
DEFENCE lawyers for a Muslim cleric and his followers accused of
planning to bomb US landmarks asked for a mistrial today, claiming that
the judge in the case had covered up plea talks with a key defendant.
The move came after a surprise guilty plea yesterday by Siddiq Ibrahim
Siddiq Ali, alleged mastermind of the scheme.
Court records revealed that he had contacted the US Government on
January 23 -- one week before opening statements in the trial -- seeking
to co-operate.
Records show that US district Judge Michael Mukasey appointed a
separate lawyer on January 24 to represent Siddiq Ali in the
negotiations. Opening statements began on January 30.
The defendants are accused of helping to plan the 1993 World Trade
Centre bombing that killed six people and wounded more than 1000.
They are also charged with plotting to bomb the United Nations and
bridges and tunnels to New York City.
The indictment also accuses them of involvement in the 1990 murder of
radical Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York and with planning to kill Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
Siddiq Ali yesterday admitted his role in the scheme and implicated
the other 11 defendants, including his religious leader, Sheikh Omar
Abdel-Rahman. He said the Egyptian cleric had given permission for the
bombings.
Defence lawyers seeking a mistrial argued that it was improper for the
judge to have allowed them to present their opening arguments, unaware
of a co-operation agreement.
Judge Mukasey told them there were no laws granting them the right to
know the status of plea negotiations with another client.--Reuter.

Bill Caven and Elizabeth Buie test the reaction in Stewart's
constituency
SENIOR Tory figures in Eastwood yesterday dismissed any suggestion
that the long-term political future of their controversial MP, Mr Allan
Stewart, remained in serious doubt following his departure from the
Scottish Office.
Instead, they insisted there was no question of Mr Stewart being
dumped and de-selected by the Conservatives during the run-up to the
next General Election.
Despite his decision to resign from his ministerial post at the
Scottish Office in the wake of his much-publicised weekend fracas with
anti-motorway protesters, the party faithful remained staunchly
supportive of their local MP and the unstinting work he had done.
Within minutes of the official announcement being made in London of Mr
Stewart's resignation as Scottish Industry and Local Government
Minister, his constituency chairman, Mr Cliff Hargreaves, spoke of his
disappointment at the move.
He remained adamant that the incident involving the Eastwood MP and a
group of people protesting over the M77 motorway extension at the
weekend should not have resulted in Mr Stewart quitting his ministerial
job and returning to the back benches.
''As far as I am concerned and I know that I speak for many others, I
certainly haven't considered it to be a resigning matter,'' the chairman
said.
''Allan has a high level of support within the constituency and also
the party and I fully expect this to continue. He has been our MP for 16
years during which time he has served this constituency and also
Scotland well in his various capacities.''
Mr Hargreaves continued: ''As far as the MP aspect is concerned, the
fact that he doesn't have Government responsibilities gives him more
time to be with his constituents.
''De-selection is not something that we do very regularly and I can
honestly say in this matter is very unlikely.''
Pointing out that Mr Stewart had risen once before after resigning
from a ministerial post, the chairman said that the Conservative MP was
a ''pretty resilient'' character.
He confirmed that there were no plans by the constituency executive to
hold an emergency meeting to discuss developments. The chairman also
added that it had to be remembered that this road was vitally important
to the residents of Eastwood and that the protesters came from outwith
the constituency.
Overwhelming backing of Mr Stewart was also received at the Tories'
tiny constituency office in Newton Mearns where scores of telephone
callers expressed their disgust and sympathy over what had happened.
Indeed, many of the callers, according to Ms Ann McFadden, the Tories'
constituency agent for Eastwood, were not even fervent followers of the
Conservative cause.
''We have been amazed and quite staggered by the enormous strength of
support which has been expressed for Allan,'' she said. ''What has, in
fact, been even more surprising and encouraging is that not all these
messages have come from Tory supporters.
Near the MP's family home in Neilston, many of the locals felt that Mr
Stewart should not have tendered his resignation over this issue.
Mr Jim McDonald expressed surprise at the move, adding: ''His son was
with him and obviously he reacted when it looked as though the situation
was threatening to become pretty ugly. I don't think he is doing the
right thing by resigning.''
Similar sentiments were expressed by Ms Olive Paterson, who said it
was ''disgraceful'' that Mr Stewart had been forced into such a position
by people, who were only attempting to harm Eastwood rather than enhance
it.
However, local shopkeeper Patricia Thompson said that she was
disappointed by the MP's actions on Sunday when he picked up a pick-axe
during heated exchange with the protesters. She believed that such a
move reflected badly on the people he represented. ''I don't think that
he will gain the respect and support of the constituents in the future
after what happened,'' the trader admitted.
Meanwhile, as the M77 protesters rushed from point to point along the
proposed motorway route trying to chain themselves to security vans to
prevent more trees being felled, they were treating the day of Allan
Stewart's resignation as business as usual.
''We've got work to do,'' they shouted, as they rushed past members of
the media to get to the latest sighting of tree-cutting activity.
''The Allan Stewart circus is an irrelevant sideshow,'' said Mr
Lindsay Keenan, the Glasgow Earth First! activist who claimed that Mr
Stewart pushed him in chest.
''There is only one serious issue here, which is that the M77 should
be cancelled. Last week there was a letter sent by three Glasgow Labour
MPs detailing the complaint to the European Commission with regard to
the fact there has been no environmental impact assessment done for this
motorway,'' said Mr Keenan.
He said he hoped that the publicity surrounding Mr Stewart's
resignation would highlight the issues of their campaign.
He also predicted that Mr Stewart's would not be the only political
head to roll over the motorway issue. Four Strathclyde regional
councillors -- Robert Gould, Bill Timoney, Charles Gordon, and William
O'Rourke -- would also face disgrace for their support of the M77, he
claimed.
Both CBI Scotland and the Federation of Small Businesses expressed
regret over Mr Stewart's resignation.
Mr Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, said: ''We are sad to learn of
Allan Stewart's resignation. He understood the needs of industry and
Scotland's business community.''
Mr Bill Anderson, Scottish secretary of the Federation of Small
Businesses, said: ''Allan Stewart was one of the most approachable
ministers in the Scottish Office and we regret his resignation.
''As Minister for Industry and Local overnment we had regular contact
with him. We found that he listened to what we said, frequently
accepting a reasoned argument and invariably consulted those affected by
policy changes.''

FIFTY years too late, it was yesterday revealed that two notorious
convicted traitors of the Second World War should not have been hung.
William Joyce, 39, -- Lord Haw Haw to those who listened to his
nightly mocking wartime radio propaganda messages to Britain from
Germany -- and John Amery, 33, -- brother of the future Tory Minister
Julian Amery, now Lord Amery of Lustleigh -- were executed within weeks
of each other at Wandsworth Prison in London.
Home Office papers released yesterday make it clear that according to
vital evidence available while both men yet lived neither deserved this
fate,Joyce because he was not a British citizen and Amery because of his
mental state.
Eminent psychiatrists -- including two from Scotland -- along with the
King's personal physician, had testified Amery was a psychopath and had
suffered from mental illness from childhood.
Even the two Home Office psychiatrists appointed by J Chuter Ede, the
Home Secretary in the post-war Labour Government, to examine the
prisoner almost on the eve of the execution, earnestly urged that his
death sentence -- passed after a trial that lasted only six and a half
minutes at the Old Bailey -- should be commuted.
Not even top Government law officers had anticipated the courts would
uphold that William Joyce was a British citizen, and could therefore be
tried for treason.
Joyce was born in America, the son of a naturalised Irish American
father. The papers released yesterday show that the US Government had no
doubt that Joyce was an American citizen until he took out German
nationality before America became involved in the war.
There was no question of him holding joint British-American
citizenship at any time, a fact the Director of Public Prosecution was
aware of, leading him to prepare a deportation order.
After his conviction there was a flood of protest from throughout
Britain and from as far away as Canada.
The Duke of Bedford writing from Cairnsmore, Newton Stewart,
Wigtonshire, added his voice: ''I must say I feel that his execution
would be an act of quite unjustifiable vindictiveness . . . involving a
not inconsiderable degree of hypocrisy.''
There was to be no mercy from the Government. William Joyce, in a
final message from jail, wrote: ''I am proud to die for my ideals, and I
am sorry for the sons of Britain who have died without knowing why.''
John Amery had gone to the gallows before him.
There was little doubt about Amery's treachery from 1942 until he was
captured in 1945 by Italian partisans who had revolted against the
Nazis.
However Professor D K Henderson of Edinburgh University was one of the
psychiatrists who concluded that Amery was not responsible for his
actions, although he had never personally examined him.
Dr A MacNiven, lecturer in psychiatry at Glasgow University,
concurred. ''All his life he has suffered from mental abnormality . . .
he can only be regarded as a person of unsound mind . . . he may even be
suffering from syphilitic infection of the brain.''
Before he was led to the gallows Amery told his lawyers: ''I ask only
that when they hang me, they first allow me to shave carefully.''

EVIDENCE is expected to begin today in the trial of three men charged
with murdering a 63-year-old retired mining engineer and robbing a bank
of #185,000.
Mr Robert Smith, 33, Mr Gerald McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25,
deny presenting a loaded gun at Mr David Dunn, of Dalhousie Drive,
Bonnyrigg, on October 19 last year, shooting him on the body, and
murdering him.
All three are also charged with attempting to murder PC John Duffy by
presenting a loaded gun at him and repeatedly firing it at him with
intent to shoot him.
They also deny that on the same date, they tried to murder PC Duffy,
Mr John Girdler, and Mr Duncan Milliken by presenting a loaded shotgun
at them and repeatedly firing it with intent to shoot them.
All three incidents are alleged to have taken place at Polton Street
car park, Bonnyrigg, on October 19 last year.
The Crown alleges that on the same date all three, with faces masked,
assaulted two Securicor guards and staff at the Bank of Scotland in
Bonnyrigg.
The accused deny that they threatened bank staff with loaded shotguns,
demanded cash, forced them to lie on the floor, and robbed them of
#185,000.
Mr McQuade is also charged with having a CS gas canister and a knife
in his possession in the car park on the same date.

New Delhi, Tuesday
SIKHS living in Britain will gift 1100lb of gold plate to restore
their faith's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple of Amritsar, in the
Punjab, it was reported today.
The temple was the centre of a Sikh separatist campaign for a homeland
and the scene of a bloody siege involving Indian troops and entrenched
Sikh militants in 1984.
Later that year, two Sikh bodyguards assassinated Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi for ordering troops into the shrine.
Sikhs living in Britain felt the urge to replace the worn out plate
that adorns the temple, the Indian Express newspaper reported. It will
cost an estimated #1m.
The original gold-plating of the temple was done by Sikh ruler
Maharajah Ranjit Singh in the early 18th century. It has not been
replaced since then.
Not all the gold will need to be purchased, with current world prices
at around #240 an ounce. The report said much of it would be donated
from personal holdings.--AP.

Warsaw, Tuesday
BOWING to pressure from President Lech Walesa, Poland's Prime Minister
offered to resign tonight and turn leadership of the government over to
the former communists -- partners in his coalition government.
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak offered the leadership to Speaker Jozef
Oleksy, whose Democratic Left Alliance Party are the renamed former
communists who ruled Poland from the end of the Second World War until
1989.
Walesa had attacked Pawlak's government for wasting its large
parliamentary majority with internal bickering, ignoring economic
reform, and tolerating corruption.
Democratic Left Alliance Party leader Aleksander Kwasniewski said his
party accepted the resignation offer.
However, Oleksy still needs to be voted in as Prime Minister by the
460-member Parliament. His party has more than 160 seats and its
coalition partner, Pawlak's Peasant Party, has more than 130 seats.
The move followed weeks of criticism from Walesa, who had demanded
that the Parliament be disolved because of inaction on economic reform
during the 15 months of Pawlak's leadership.
While Pawlak resisted Walesa's attacks, he finally made the offer to
step down in favour of a Prime Minister from the larger of the coalition
parties.
The move was apparently aimed at avoiding new elections, which might
have occurred had the government continued to face Walesa's harsh
attacks.
''I am afraid this change will not end the crisis,'' said Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, Poland's first democratically chosen Prime Minister and
leader of the largest opposition party, the centre-right Freedom Union.
''It is a change within the same coalition,'' he said. ''This
coalition is responsible for the serious crisis in the country.''
Opposition politicians have repeatedly said that the present coalition
has exhausted its possibilities and should be changed.
Mazowiecki said there was a need to cut short this Parliament's
four-year term, which should have run until next year.
It was not immediately clear whether the change would appease
Walesa.--AP.

THE reality of the Scottish justice system is being obscured by TV
images of the O J Simpson trial and programmes such as L A Law, a
leading law professor claimed yesterday.
The message from the USA -- that money can buy justice -- is not the
reality in Scotland, according to Professor Peter Robson of Strathclyde
University Law School.
Professor Robson, who specialises in welfare law, was expressing his
views at the university last night in his inaugural lecture Watching the
Detectives: Law and Popular Culture.
He said that the American way of justice was coming to be seen as the
norm by TV viewers in the UK and Scotland.
''The all-pervading view of a money-orientated justice system will
mean that the public will be more inclined to see any legal aid capping
as a measure to curb greedy lawyers rather than as a measure which will
put justice out of reach for the most needy sectors of society.''
Professor Robson thinks that we are being swamped by the American view
of justice not only through real trials such as O J Simpson's, but also
because of fictionalised books, films and TV programmes such as LA Law.
''The dominance of the American model means that we are being fed a
view of the law courts which paints lawyers -- and how much they are
paid -- as all-important.
''Even in Britain, many programmes depict a lone legal hero swimming
against a tide of corruption and vested interests.
''This misleading picture of general seediness and greed within the
profession means the public focus on the amount paid through legal aid
to QCs acting for the Maxwell brothers, but are diverted from the very
real prospect of legal aid capping, through which there will be a set
limit of financial assistance in any given year.
''When that is up, individuals will get no backing, whatever the
merits of their case.''
Professor Robson is currently vice-chair of Shelter (UK), chair of
Shelter (Scotland) and author of the standard reference book on
Homelessness and the Law in the UK.

THE United Nations tonight said food was desperately short in the

Rebel Muslim and Serb forces were blocking aid convoys to Bihac and
desperate citizens said they had not eaten for days, said the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees.
Several thousand people demonstrated outside UNHCR offices in Bihac
town on Monday to urge relief workers to help them.
The worsening situation in Bihac contrasted with an easing of the
Bosnian Serb grip on the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, where hundreds of
people today flocked to use roads newly opened under a ceasefire
agreement.--Reuter.

Dr Preston, 62, will take up his new post with Mining (Scotland),
which trades as the Scottish Coal Company, in March, when he stands down
from his post with the electricity company.
He will replace Professor Ross Harper, the leading lawyer who oversaw
the company's bid for the Scottish coalfield through to its formal
conclusion at the end of December.
0 It was always Professor Harper's intention to stand down as chairman
once the buy-out was completed. He will remain on the board as deputy
chairman.

THE Princess of Wales yesterday paid her respects at a cemetery for
Commonwealth soldiers who died during the Second World War.
Hundreds of onlookers lined nearby streets as Princess Diana laid a
wreath at the cemetery, where 1738 soldiers and sailors are buried. Most
died as prisoners of war or were killed on their way to Japan.
The Princess's visits to the cemetery in Yokohama, south-west of
Tokyo, came just one week after a group of former PoWs from Britain, the
US, New Zealand, and Australia filed a lawsuit demanding compensation
and an apology from Japan's government.
The group is claiming compensation for ''barbaric acts against
humanity'' suffered at the hands of the country's wartime rulers.
The Princess, on her third trip to Japan, but her first without
estranged husband Prince Charles, arrived in Tokyo on Monday for a
four-day stay.
Plans for her to visit Kobe, which was devastated by a powerful
earthquake last month that killed 5000, were cancelled at the last
minute. Instead, she expressed sympathy for the earthquake victims in a
speech soon after her arrival.
Earlier, a minor tremor which hit the British embassy in central
Tokyo, where she is staying, failed to wake her.
The earthquake, centred on an eastern suburb of the city, measured 3.9
on the Richter scale and made rooms throughout the area shake.
An embassy staff member awakened by the rumbling at 4.23am, said:
''Several of us woke up but the Princess slept right through.''
Today, she is to have tea with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko,
before returning home tomorrow.

POLICE yesterday raided the Glasgow firm ICL Technical Plastics during
an investigation into the sale of electro-shock batons. A number of
items were seized for examination and a report is being sent to the
procurator-fiscal.
The managing director of the firm, which is based in Maryhill, is Mr
Frank Stott who was exposed last month on the Channel Four programme
Dispatches trying to secure a #2m export order for the weapons.
Electro-shock batons have been outlawed in Britain since 1988 and are
claimed by Amnesty International to have been adopted as effective
instruments of torture by unscrupulous governments throughout the world.
Mr Stott claims the police raid was simply an interview which had been
arranged around three weeks ago and denies that any parts were taken
away for examination.
However, a police spokesman said: ''Officers from Maryhill, acting on
the authority of a warrant, searched the premises of ICL Technical
Plastics in Maryhill and seized a number of items which will be subject
to a further examination and a report is being send to the
procurator-fiscal.''
It is understood that Mr Stott is not being charged at the moment and
that the report is for the procurator-fiscal's own information.
In the Dispatches documentary, Mr Stott was shown demonstrating the
effectiveness of an electro-shock weapon to an undercover journalist and
an actor posing as arms buyers. He also claimed Strathclyde police
wanted the firm's operation kept quiet and he operated under the
sanction of the Scottish Office.
Prior to the programme's broadcast on January 11, a spokesman for ICL
said the interview was simply part of a feasibility study and that the
company had never manufactured for sale any electro-shock weapons. The
company's main business is protective equipment such as riot shields.
After the programme's broadcast, Strathclyde police contacted Channel
Four. A spokesman for Channel Four said yesterday: ''In the programme,
Frank Stott said he had a Section Five permit under the Firearms Act to
possess electro-shock weapons. But Strathclyde police said he did not.
They also said that they might want to see our rushes. But they haven't
contacted us again.''
Mr Stott said: ''Nothing was taken. We had some police interviews
which were organised some time ago. I'm not really into discussing this.
We made our press statements at the time to The Herald. We have nothing
more to say on the matter and as far as we are concerned the matter is
closed.''

A JUDGE yesterday expressed his great regret at not being able to
award immediate damages of #150,000 to a 14-year-old girl who is
confined to a wheelchair for life after a 60ft plunge into a quarry.
Mrs Josephine Stone is seeking total damages of #2m on behalf of her
daughter, Allyson, following the accident in May 1993.
She went to the Court of Session seeking an interim award which would
have enabled her to buy a specially adapted house for Allyson.
Allyson, of Golden Acre, Johnshaven, Aberdeenshire, was visiting
relatives in Kirriemuir, Angus, in May 1993 when she went to play with
other children in a field next to a quarry.
She got over a wall dividing the field from the quarry then fell 60
ft, suffering a severe spinal injury which has rendered her paraplegic
and confined to a wheelchair.
Mrs Stone is suing Mr John Mountford, of Easthillbank, Kirriemuir, the
owner of the land containing the quarry. She asked Lord Johnston for an
award of interim damages of #250,000 pending a full hearing of the case.
The Judge said that in essence, Mrs Stone was claiming that the quarry
was shielded by thick undergrowth and the wall was not high enough to
provide a sufficient barrier.
Mr Mountford alleges that the wall was higher than Mrs Stone claimed,
that it was protected by a barbed wire fence, and that adequate
precautions had been taken to discourage children from climbing over the
wall and falling into the quarry.
Lord Johnston said that the information which had been put before him
did not satisfy the test necessary for an award of interim damages, but
that Mrs Stone was ''almost certainly bound'' to win her case.

AN urgent review of hospital intensive care was ordered by the
Government yesterday after serious shortages of beds in some areas
emerged in a nationwide survey.
Health authorities are to be asked to report on how many intensive
care beds they need.
The review, ordered by Health Minister Tom Sackville, is confined to
England and Wales, although Glasgow was one of the 50 centres polled in
a survey by Dr David Bennett, head of intensive care at St George's
Hospital in Tooting, London.
Glasgow was at the lower end of occcupancy rates, which, ranged from
75% to 100%, but last month a fatal accident inquiry in the city heard
of a ''full house'' in every city hospital which delayed a vital
operation on a pensioner..
Last night Dr Ian Gray, president of the Scottish Intensive Care
Society, said that increasing demand was driving intensive care towards
the situation in England, where seriously-ill patients are regularly
shuttled from one hospital to another in search of an empty intensive
care bed.
''In general terms the situation does not seem to be as critical here
but demand is increasing inexorably,'' said Dr Gray, consultant
anaesthetist in charge if intensive care at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee.
''Ourselves, Aberdeen Royal and Perth Royal have always in the past
been able to accommodate our needs by transferring among ourselves when
necessary, but over the past few months there have been spells when all
three intensive care units were full.
''We do not transfer if we can help it. Alternative local arrangements
can be made -- sometimes by maintaining patients in theatre recovery
areas.''
In physical terms Ninewells has seven intensive care beds but the
number of staffed places available averages out at 5.3. Running as they
are at 75%-80% occcupancy, they are now seeking to increase availability
to 6.5 places.
While England has the advantage of a greater number of sites, located
more closely together than in Scotland, this is offset by the larger
number of patients.
Mr Sackville admitted the situation in intensive care was a cause for
concern and there were ''particular pressure points'', including, in
some areas, a shortage of trained intensive care nurses, particularly in
London.
But he said research showed one in six intensive care beds were being
used inappropriately, either for people who did not have a chance of
recovery or for those in hospital for planned operations who should not
be taking up an intensive care bed.
He insisted there was a danger of providing too many beds and thereby
diverting resources which could be used elsewhere.

<HEADLINE>SECC objection to repairs raises doubts for storm-damaged Bell's crossing over Clyde    Wrangle could bring down bridge</HEADLINE>

THE future of the storm-damaged Bell's Bridge, linking Glasgow's
former Garden Festival site and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference
Centre, is in doubt because of a dispute over repair plans.
Glasgow Development Agency apparently wants to carry out repairs to
the bridge structure but officials of the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre want it removed from its present site.
Unless the wrangle is resolved before Easter, the paddle steamer
Waverley will be trapped at her winter berth at Anderston Quay with her
entire spring programme in jeopardy.
The bridge has remained closed since the December floods moved the
quay wall. A massive crack appeared in the north bank quayside running
for several hundred yards. As a result the bridge cannot be swung open.
The Waverley is due to raise steam on March 6 and move to drydock for
the final stages of an extensive #350,000 refit.
The paddler is scheduled to resume public cruising at Easter, but now
faces the prospect of having nowhere to go.
Glasgow Development Agency, which owns the #1.5m bridge, is understood
to be still considering an assessment of the damage carried out by a
firm of consulting engineers with a view to repairing the structure.
However, The Herald has learned that Mr Mike Closier, chief executive
of the adjoining SECC, has objected to the GDA over any refurbishment
arguing that the continued presence of the bridge in its present
location would hinder a #30m planned extension of the conference
facilities.
The bridge was built for the Garden Festival in 1988. The GDA has
taken steps to have it adopted and operated by Strathclyde Regional
Council once the agency finds the money to upgrade it to a permanent
structure.
Mr Closier said yesterday that Bell's Bridge had been designed as a
temporary feature.
SEC Ltd had objected to the granting of a parliamentary order which
would enable refurbishment to be carried out ''because we believe that
the bridge, in its present location, affects the integrity of the SECC
site, especially with regard to the planned #30m conference
development''.
There was some doubt yesterday about whether the objection has been
made within the regulation time scale laid down by Parliament.
A spokeswoman for the House of Commons Public Information Office would
only say: ''It has been reported that a parliamentary order in
connection with Bell's Bridge should proceed but it hasn't started the
process yet.''
Such an order is necessary for any alterations to fixtures across the
Clyde. An official of the London-based solicitors handling the
parliamentary order declined to comment yesterday. He is expected to
visit Glasgow today.
Waverley Excursions said any prolonged problems with the bridge would
be disastrous. Captain David Neill said he had been assured that the
bridge would be ready to swing open by March 6 to allow the paddle
steamer to go to drydock in the next stage of her refit.
A GDA spokesman said: ''Although we believe the bridge itself does not
require a great deal of work, as far as the repairs to the quayside
following the recent flood damage are concerned, we are in the hands of
the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre.''
An SECC spokesman said that structural engineers were assessing the
quayside damage to see whether the quay wall itself or just the capping
stones needed repair.

ONE of Britain's biggest and longest-established medical schools is to
scrap its traditional curriculum from next year.
Student doctors at Glasgow University will no longer have to sit
through hours of lectures every day, being force-fed facts which in many
cases will be obsolete before they can use them.
Instead a new structure will introduce freshers to a core curriculum
of problem-based learning in small groups, allied from the start with
patient contact and the mastery of professional skills.
As the students move through their five-year course the core course
will diminish and be replaced by core clinical learning in hospital and
by study modules which students can choose according to the speciality
they aspire to.

A HIGH-PROFILE campaign to boost tourism in Scotland has succeeded in
outraging hoteliers in one of the country's best known resorts.
Businessmen in Oban claim visitor numbers have slumped because the
town's name has been left out of an advert which appeared in newspapers
throughout Britain.
To add insult to injury, rivals Skye and Fort William both get a
mention in the campaign produced by the Scottish Tourist Board to
encourage people to get more information on Scotland's attractions.
Furious locals in the West Coast town called a meeting and have now
banded together to mount a campaign of their own under the banner Get
Oban Back On The Map.
Local businessman David Webster said: ''We feel we have literally been
wiped off the map. Oban has been left out of this major campaign and
although it only started this year we feel visitor numbers have already
been damaged.''
The advert includes a map of Scotland with 19 areas highlighted.
Members of the public are invited to tick boxes on a form to receive
more information on the area they are interested in.
What has particularly angered Obanites is that the town comes under
the grouping of West Highlands and Islands while neighbouring Fort
William and Skye have their own category.
''It is all very well for us in Scotland to say we know where all
those places are, '' said Mr Webster. ''But if you are advertising down
in the deep south of England to someone who has never been in Scotland a
map which has only lists of districts on it is not particularly good
marketing.''
It is estimated that more than one million people visit Oban every
year and tourism is a vital part of the local economy.
Oban hotelier and former local tourist board chairman, Mr Ian
Nicholson, said: ''Everybody is a bit disillusioned and since Oban has
gone missing from the map a few of us have got together and decided to
market the town ourselves
''If everybody puts their hand in their pocket it will be done. It is
certainly more advantageous for us to market Oban under its own banner.
The Scottish Tourist Board have not done a good job.''
A spokesman for Faulds Advertising in Edinburgh who handled the
campaign for the tourist board said it was difficult to please
everybody.
''The tourist board is representing the whole of Scotland and they
have to be as fair as they can be to everybody. When you look at the
size of the map and what we are trying to do in respect of the resources
available for the whole of Scotland it is impossible to please
everybody.''
To add to the town's problems locals are concerned the advert is just
one more erosion of Oban's identity. Tourism in the area was formerly
handled by the Oban, Mull and District Tourist Board but its name was
changed to West Highlands and Islands of Argyll Tourist Board following
an amalgamation three years ago.

He was the unanimous recommendation of the advisory selection
committee appointed by the Scott Trust, which owns the Observer.
Mr Jaspan took over as editor of the Scotsman from Scotland on Sunday
which he edited for five years.
During his time there the Sunday newspaper won a number of awards,
including Newspaper of the Year in 1994, the same year Mr Jaspan was

THE Carluke murderer, George Beattie, has appeared before the Scottish
Parole Board but will have to wait until next week to learn if he is to
be freed.
His solicitor, Mr Joseph Beltrami, yesterday confirmed that he
expected to hear from the board on Monday or Tuesday but expressed worry
that some sections of the media were putting undue pressure on Parole
Board members to find out if the result was in Beattie's favour.
Beattie, 40, was convicted 21 years ago of repeatedly stabbing
23-year-old Margaret McLaughlin as she walked the short distance from
her home to Carluke railway station. He has maintained his innocence,
backed up by a lengthy campaign headed by BBC's Rough Justice programme.
He served 13 years in jail, was released in October 1986 only to be
recalled to prison six years on after an incident with a social worker.
Last year, after Mr Beltrami's inquiries had uncovered evidence
involving blood groupings which had not been heard by the 1973 jury, the
Appeal Court heard and rejected a new appeal and Beattie was returned to
jail in November.
Mr Thomas Dawson, QC, the Solicitor General, said at the appeal that
had the existence of the blood tests on stones under the victim's head
been revealed at the time they would have given the defence a chance to
''slightly muddy the waters'' but not to any significant extent.
Mr Beltrami said yesterday: ''I worry in case these media attempts may
colour anyone's thoughts against my client. They are not helpful. The
deliberations of the Parole Board are confidential.''
Beattie's parole hearing came up as a matter of course. In December Mr
Jimmy Hood, MP for Clydesdale, was told by Scottish Office Minister,
Lord Fraser, that Beattie would receive a parole hearing ''without undue
delay''.

AN URGENT investigation was launched last night after the RSPCA
revealed new evidence of animals being subjected to ''barbaric cruelty''
on the Continent.
Officials secretly filmed livestock being slaughtered in a Greek
abattoir and said the worst scenes were some of the most gruesome
inspectors had witnessed.
They said it was feared that British sheep were among the animals that
had their throats cut and were left to die in agony.
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave said he was appalled by the
footage and called on the European Union to take action.
Greek ministry of agriculture officials said they were making urgent
inquiries to see whether the practices reported by the RSPCA were
widespread.
An English High Court judge yesterday refused to lift an official
block on livestock shipments through Shoreham, West Sussex, the scene of
violent protests in recent weeks.
However, Mr Justice Smedley warned the port authority the ban amounted
to a breach of contract and could lead to a claim for damages by export
firm International Traders Ferry, which had applied for an order to
force the port to accept its trade.
At a separate hearing, a veal calf exporter won permission to bring a
challenge against a ban on flights of live animals from Humberside
Airport.
North Yorkshire-based Albert Hall Farms was given leave to seek a
judicial review after a judge ruled the company had an ''arguable case''
that the block was in breach of EU free trade rules.
Meanwhile, five people from Yorkshire were arrested yesterday after
small boats tried to block the livestock vessel Caroline returning to
Brightlingsea, Essex, to pick up sheep for export to Belgium.

<TEXT>
LEGIONELLA bacteria went undetected for 16 days at the Time Capsule
leisure centre in Coatbridge while ''routine'' laboratory tests were
carried out, a health expert said yesterday.
Traces of the bacteria were discovered in water samples taken from
shower heads in the Lanarkshire centre more than two weeks ago.
The results of the tests were not known until Monday.
Monklands District Council shut the water sports part of the complex
on Monday within half-an-hour of receiving the results.
In those two weeks, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the
Central belt and the West of Scotland would have used the swimming
complex, inlcuding many elderly people who would be most at risk of
contracting Legionnaires' disease.
The delay was explained yesterday by Dr Syed Ahmed, the public health
consultant for Lanarkshire Health Board.
He said tests would never have taken so long had there been a case of
Legionnaires' disease reported in the area.
The swimming areas will remain closed for the next eight days. Only
the dry sports area and the ice rink will be open.
Experts will use hyper chlorination treatment to kill the bacteria.
Yesterday Lanarkshire Health Board put hospitals and GPs on full
alert.
No cases of Legionnaires' disease have been reported.
The routine tests began when environmental health officers from
Monklands District collected samples from the shower heads. The samples
were then tested by Lanarkshire Health Board, which took 16 days.
On Monday morning the bug was confirmed.
Dr Ahmed said: ''The tests would not have taken so long had there been
a case of the disease reported.
''The delay is probably down to the fact the test was routine.''
Monklands regularly carries out checks in the centre, even though
councils are not required to do so by law.
Dr Ahmed said: ''There is nothing to suggest anyone will have been
infected.''
Usually those at risk are the elderly or those who suffer ill health.
A spokesman for Monklands District Council said yesterday: ''We
routinely test the Time Capsule -- not because we have to -- but because
we think it's best for the public and staff.
''There is no question that we knew about the presence of legionella
before Monday. That's when we got the test results.''
A spokesman for Monklands General Hospital confirmed yesterday that
there were no cases of Legionnaires' disease either reported or
suspected.

MRS Margaret McLeish, wife of Central Fife MP and Shadow Transport
Spokesman Henry McLeish, has died from pancreatic cancer. She was 47.
Her death at Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital came barely a month after
her illness was first diagnosed.
In common with her husband, she was born and brought up in Methil.
They were childhood sweethearts at Buckhaven High School, and married in
1968, when Mr McLeish was a professional footballer with East Fife.
Mrs McLeish was immensely supportive of her husband as he embarked on
a career in politics, first as a district councillor, then as leader of
Fife Regional Council, and finally as the MP for Central Fife in 1987.
The couple have two children, Niall, 20, and Clare, 18.

THE TROUBLES at Europe's largest urban aid agency, Drumchapel
Opportunities, just will not go away even after a #500,000 rescue
package from its local authority and enterprise agency funding partners.
Drumchapel Opportunities now faces losing its headquarters --
ironically, being put on the market by the receivers for another
community-based agency.
Other tenants reputedly at risk in the premises include Anniesland
College, Strathclyde Careers Office, Workwise, and an organisation for
the rehabilitation and training of physically or mentally disabled
people.
DO, itself saved from going bust last year, is now gearing up for a
legal battle over the threat -- although conceding that no written lease
contract exists for the headquarters.
It will argue an implied contract exists on grounds that negotiations
were in hand, made in good faith, and subject only to final details. In
addition, rentals had been paid since January last year.
However, contingency plans are being drawn up if the 60 staff are
forced to quit the premises known as Opengate, a derelict, burned-out
supermarket transformed into offices by Drumchapel Community
Organisations Council with backing from Drumchapel Opportunites.
But DCOC called in the receivers last year after running up debts
reputed to be more than #300,000.
Sales of Opengate -- plus DCOC's own headquarters at Mercat House,
which includes a 300-seat theatre, and the Argo Centre -- would ensure
all creditors would get their money back.
However, Drumchapel Opportunities -- which only survived liquidation
after another financial injection by Glasgow District Council,
Strathclyde Regional Council, and Glasgow Development Agency -- is
determined that Opengate should remain in community control.
It will argue the receivers have no rights to advertise a sale with
immediate and vacant possession rights because of title restrictions on
the property. The conditions involve its use only for educational or
training purposes, it is claimed.
Strathclyde Regional Councillor Charles Gordon, chairman of Drumchapel
Opportunities, formed in 1989 with the aim of relieving poverty among
the area's 18,000 residents, said yesterday: ''It is a matter of concern
that a question mark exists over the DO headquarters.''
He added: ''It had put the bulk of problems behind it, and was
projected to more or less breaking even.''
A spokesman for the receivers was not available for comment.

Brussels.
LABOUR last night accused the SNP's two Euro-MPs of junketing and
causing a ''total waste of taxpayers' money'' by setting off today on a
four-day ''study trip'' to French Guyana in Latin America.
Mrs Winnie Ewing, SNP president and MEP for Highlands and Islands,
will be accompanied by Dr Allan Macartney (North East Scotland) on the
trip led by their political group leader in the European Parliament, Mr
Bernard Tapie, the French socialist bankrupt.
During the trip -- for which a club class ticket costs more than #1000
-- they are scheduled to study fisheries, the plight of indigenous
peoples of Guyana, and the problems of the Amazonian rainforest.
Dr Macartney defended the trip last night. ''It is not a junket,'' he
said. ''We must be the only people to go to this place without being
dragged there in chains. It is, after all, known as Devil's Island. You
might call me the Papillon of the European Parliament.''
Mrs Ewing will make the trip in a wheelchair, having slipped last week
at Brussels airport when she suffered a hair-line fracture of the
pelvis. She will travel alone while Dr Macartney will be accompanied by
his wife who is also his parliamentary assistant. ''I am paying for her
myself,'' he said.
The trip will involve 19 Euro-MPs from the parliament's Radical
Alliance, travelling with interpreters and officials and is the latest
in a series of ''study visits'' causing controversy in the parliament.
The most notorious was last year when Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of
the neo-Fascist French National Front, was prevented by cross-party
Scottish opposition from visiting Edinburgh after a row over his group's
spending on similar visits to Dublin, Rome, Vienna, Venice, London,
Lisbon, Madrid and Nice. He was accused by Labour of ''serial
junketing''.
The group including Mrs Ewing and Dr Macartney will be travelling at
the invitation of Ms Christiane Taubira-Delannon, a French Guyanese
nationalist MEP. French Guyana is technically in the EU because it is
classified as a French dominion.
Dr Macartney said Ms Taubira-Delannon sought independence for her
country just as the Scots did for Scotland. ''It is important we show
solidarity with her. . .''
Mrs Ewing responded to criticisms by saying the cost of flying to
Shetland was just as expensive. She wants the group to meet next in
Shetland.
An SNP spokesman in Brussels said: ''We make no apology for this. Our
tickets are costing less than the price of a ticket to Inverness.''
But Labour's Mr Wayne David, EPLP leader, said: ''This is a total
waste of taxpayers' money. I have asked the president of the EP to
investigate the whole matter. They might not violate the rules but they
violate their spirit.''

<HEADLINE>Hospital looks abroad to solve doctor shortage</HEADLINE>

A SCOTTISH hospital yesterday announced plans to recruit junior
doctors from abroad in an attempt to meet shortages in its casualty
department.
The situation at Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary is the latest
illustration of the severe lack of qualified medical students prepared
to work in accident and emergency units.
One estimate suggests that there are about 150 vacancies for senior
house officers (SHOs) across the UK. The Herald revealed last week that
one English hospital was offering a premium of #50 per hour to attract
temporary staff.
Senior officials of the Falkirk NHS Trust yesterday admitted that they
had managed to fill only two of the five SHO posts in A &amp; E which had
fallen vacant earlier this month.
Advertisements would now be placed in Germany and Holland, Mr Ian
Mullen, the trust's chairman, said. Both countries have surplus junior
doctors.
He did not anticipate any communication problems, given the high
standard of English spoken by most graduates in other European
countries.
Mr Mullen said the shortfall had been exacerbated as junior doctors
were no longer obliged to work a spell in casualty.
However, Mr Mike Kelly, the trust's chief executive, emphasised that
Falkirk's A &amp; E unit continued to operate normally.

A DEFIANT Allan Stewart said last night he was determined to fight on
as the constituency MP for Eastwood and made clear it had been his
personal decision to resign.
Mr Stewart resigned as Scottish Industry Minister yesterday following
a weekend fracas with anti-motorway protesters in his Eastwood
constituency. During the incident he picked up a pickaxe. He said he had
simply been exercising his right to walk legally and peacefully in his
constituency.
He firmly denied any allegations that he had been drinking heavily at
a family party before the incident took place.
Shrugging his shoulders he said in an exclusive interview with The
Herald: ''It was a normal family Sunday lunch -- a gin and tonic and a
glass of wine.''
Mr Stewart bravely appeared in the Commons division lobbies last night
to vote on Opposition motions on education and rail privatisation. After
what must have been the most difficult day of his political life, he
said: ''Of course I am voting tonight and will be at the Scottish Grand
Committee tomorrow.
''I was elected as the MP for Eastwood -- that is my job and I intend
to do it to the best of my ability.''
Mr Stewart, who was constantly interrupted by MPs from all parties
expressing sympathy over his predicament, continued: ''It was my
decision to resign to save the Government any embarrassment. These
things happen. I am not looking now to the past, I am looking to the
future with my family.''
Asked whether he could fight back to be a Minister again, he said: ''I
am not thinking in terms of coming back to ministerial office again. Who
is a Minister is a matter for the Prime Minister. I am thinking about
going on being the Honourable Member for Eastwood.''
Mr Stewart spoke of the timetable that led to his decision. He said:
''I saw the press, talked to my wife, phoned the Chief Whip and said 'I
do not wish the Government to be embarrassed by this affair, I want to
resign.' I saw Ian Lang, told him I was going to resign and showed him
the letter to the Prime Minister.''
Mr Lang, the Scottish Secretary, now faces the revamped Scottish Grand
Committee at Westminster today with a Front Bench team arguably missing
its star performer.
The departure of his right-hand man shocked Westminster and brought
about the promotion to ministerial office of the MP for Kincardine and
Deeside, Mr George Kynoch.
Mr Stewart, in his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, said:
''You will have seen the publicity surrounding my visit on Sunday to a
site in my constituency. I was there solely as the MP for Eastwood.
''However, I do not wish in any way to be an embarrassment to a
Government I have been proud to serve. Having discussed the matter with
my family I believe it only right to resign and now wish to do so.''
He said it had been a great personal privilege to have been a member
of Mr Major's Government, adding that it went without saying that he
would continue to give his support from the back benches.
The PM replied in equally warm terms, stating that while he was sorry
about Mr Stewart's resignation, he understood the reasons behind it.
''You have provided great service to the Scottish Office and the
Government over many years,'' Mr Major said.
''I am particularly grateful for the skilful way you helped to pilot
the Local Government (Scotland) Bill through the House last session and
for the effective and tireless way you have campaigned for the
Government's case in Scotland.''
Mr Lang said Mr Stewart had been an excellent Minister and would be
missed in the Scottish Office. He welcomed Mr Kynoch to the ministerial
team and looked forward to working with him.
Mr Kynoch, who has a business background, will find himself in the hot
seat today when the Scottish Grand Committee, for the first time at
Westminster, holds a 45-minute question time session, followed by a
debate on transport.
The new Minister said last night: ''I consider it a great honour to
have been given the post, but I regret it is in these circumstances. It
is tragic that Allan Stewart had to resign as he was a very good
Minister who always put Scotland's interests first. Sadly, Ministers
come and go, but the important thing is that the right policies
continue.''
Meanwhile, the opposition parties queued up to make maximum capital
out of Mr Stewart's departure. Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson said: ''This resignation is a personal decision by Allan
Stewart and a tragedy for him. It is also a serious blow for an already
deeply troubled Scottish Tory Party.
''It would have been preferable if he had gone long ago on the
political grounds of his responsibility of taking Scottish water out of
local democratic control and for gerrymandering Scottish local
government.''
The Liberal Democrats' Scottish leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said:
''History records many cases of Ministers who have fallen on their
swords, but this must be the first one to fall on his pickaxe.
''Mr Stewart is paying the price of acting thoughtlessly and
foolishly. His resignation will leave a gap in a fairly lacklustre
Scottish Office team.''
The SNP leader, Mr Alex Salmond, said: ''This is a high price to pay
for what appears to have been a moment's indiscretion. As a Minister, he
(Mr Stewart) was probably preferable to the man who succeeds him.
''It is a sign of the poverty of Tory talent in Scotland that the
gruesome twosome from the North-east (Mr Kynoch and Mr Raymond
Robertson) were the only choices available to the beleaguered governor
general in St Andrew's House.''
The resignation of Mr Stewart is a set back for the chances of Mr Lang
being promoted to Foreign Secretary.
Only the controversial Mr Michael Forsyth could now be considered for
the top Scottish job if the Prime Minister needs to reshuffle his
Cabinet later this year.
Mr Stewart, 52, with his first class economics degree and his robust
approach to politics, was beginning to be thought of as a replacement
for the Scottish Secretary. Only his volatile temperament placed a
question mark against him as Cabinet material.
Should the Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, find the Government is
becoming too Euro-sceptic and wish to leave, it seems Mr Lang's avenue
for advancement is blocked by the bizarre fall out of the M77 extension
protest.
The ebullient Allan Stewart, with his Pickwickian muttonchop
sideboards, said last night: ''I have explained to the Prime Minister
and to the Secretary of State for Scotland that recent allegations made
by individuals opposed to the extension of the M77 must be answered.
There have been wild and inaccurate allegations.
''But they relate to my conduct as an individual and I do not wish my
Government to become involved or to be deflected in any way from issues
of greater concern.''
He had actually made his resignation decision by midnight on Monday
after he had talked to close friends and advisers in his Eastwood
constituency, and his wife Susie.
Mr Stewart is alleged to have menaced protesters with a pickaxe. And
his 16-year-old son and another youth have been reported to the
procurator-fiscal over an alleged firearms offence, under legislation
covering the carrying of loaded airguns.
If the fiscal decides to pursue the matter in court, a key element may
concern whether the former Industry Minister and others present were
expecting trouble at the demonstration or just found themselves
confronted by it.
Yesterday, the Prime Minister took the simple decision to replace Mr
Stewart with Mr Kynoch, a rising star on the Tory back benches whose
talents had been recognised with his appointment as Parliamentary
Private Secretary to Education Secretary Gillian Shephard.
But meanwhile, Mr Stewart leaves Government, at least for the time
being, with the reputation of a man who stated in public or private
debate exactly what he believed.
