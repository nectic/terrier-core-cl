A 17-year-old schoolboy collapsed and later died while watching a rugby match
at Loretto School in Musselburgh, East Lothian, yesterday.
Pupils watched as staff and a doctor tried in vain to resuscitate John Kelsey,
a boarder at the school, before paramedics arrived. He was taken by ambulance
to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where he later died.
Headmaster Keith Budge said the boy's parents, who live near Aberdeen, had been
informed and were travelling to Edinburgh. He said John had been studying for
A-Levels, and that pupils and staff were ``in a state of shock''.
``Parents are being contacted to ask them to take their children home early for
the weekend,'' he added.
The public school's old boys include the late MP for Perth and Kinross, Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, and retired judge, Lord Allanbridge.

<HEADLINE>Queen Mother strolls through hip operation</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

THE Queen Mother was recuperating last night after a total hip replacement
operation.
As a steady stream of flowers from well-wishers arrived at King Edward VII's
Hospital for Officers in London, Buckingham Palace declared that she was
``making a good recovery''.
The one-and-a-half-hour private operation was ``completed successfully''
yesterday morning and the Queen Mother is expected to remain in hospital for
about two weeks.
At 95, the Queen Mother is one of the oldest patients in the world to have
undergone the operation.
While the procedure is now considered routine, and has a 95% success rate, the
surgery and anaesthetic pose greater risks the older the patient is. The Queen
Mother expects a longer-than-average recovery period.
The operation comes at the end of a year when, despite suffering evident pain
and discomfort from her hip and leg, the Queen Mother has taken a central role
in national commemorations of the Second World War.
Her simple but moving speech opening May's VE-Day anniversary celebrations
emphasised her continuing place at the heart of the nation's affections.
Although visibly unsteady on her feet and suffering from the heat, she insisted
on taking full part in the hour-long ceremony.
The next day, crowds sang Congratulations to her as she appeared on the
Buckingham Palace balcony.
The Queen Mother's health has been remarkably robust for much of her long life,
and she has never let the physical ailments which come with advancing age daunt
her spirit.
Despite several health scares and a number of operations, she has always
delighted millions by returning to official engagements and meeting the public,
displaying an energy which would be envied by many younger people.
Just four months ago, she underwent a successful operation at the same
hospital, to remove a cataract from her left eye.
In recent months, she has relied on a walking stick or wheelchair, even
appearing in a golf buggy, nicknamed the Queen Mum-Mobile.
At her last public appearance, the annual Field of Remembrance Service at
Westminster Abbey a week ago, she walked with difficulty, using two sticks, and
had to be helped by the Duke of York when her turn came to plant a wooden cross.
She was not present at the Cenotaph on Sunday for the Remembrance Day Service.
The hip replacement, performed by Mr Roger Vickers assisted by Mr William
Muirhead-Allwood, is performed successfully on around 50,000 elderly people
each year.
It involves sawing off the head of the thigh bone and removing the surface
layer of the hip socket.
A metal ball and polyethylene socket are then cemented into place to form an
artificial joint.
Usually patients stay two or three weeks in hospital, but it can take three
months before they can walk unassisted and six months to a year before they
make a full recovery.
Routine post-operative checks on the Queen Mother yesterday were a ``success'',
said Buckingham Palace, which will issue daily bulletins on her progress.
The team of doctors and surgeons are remaining at the hospital and are on hand
if required.
Mr David Murray, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Nuffield Orthopaedic
Centre, Oxford, said: ``The operation often has a dramatic effect. Patients can
be suffering severe pain beforehand and afterwards find the pain has completely
gone.''
Asked if performing the operation on a patient as old as the Queen Mother was
risky, Mr Murray said: ``There is a risk from the operation and the older the
patient the bigger the risk.''

BUCKINGHAM Palace officials, concerned over the BBC's handling of the Panorama
interview with the Princess of Wales, may consider switching the filming of the
Queen's Christmas broadcast to another channel.
Royal aides were shocked when the princess gave the Panorama interview without
informing her palace advisers.
Senior palace officials are now expressing scepticism about the BBC's
explanation of how it scooped the hour-long interview.
A palace spokesman said in a veiled threat to the BBC: ``No institution can
take for granted its relationship with the media, just as the media - and in
this case the BBC - cannot take its relationship for granted with us.''
Meanwhile, National Grid engineers have put the Dinorwic plant in Snowdonia,
north Wales, on stand-by to cope with extra demand when viewers switch on
kettles at the end of the programme on Monday.

TODAY newspaper is to close after its final issue today, News International
said yesterday.
The announcement was followed by the news last night that the owner of Harrods,
Mr Mohamed Al Fayed, wants to buy the paper.
Earlier, announcing the closure, News International executive chairman Les
Hinton said: ``We deeply regret the decision to cease publication but, with a
modest circulation, insufficient growth, and rapidly rising costs, we have no
alternative.''
Mr Hinton said NI had been unable to find a ``credible'' purchaser and had
poured ``scores of millions of pounds'' into the paper ``without the necessary
result''.
A great many staff would be found jobs elsewhere in the group and the rest
would receive their full redundancy entitlements, he added.
Last night, in a remarkable open letter to News International's owner, Mr
Rupert Murdoch, Mr Al Fayed - who two months ago was in negotiations to buy the
ailing title from NI - said he was ``dismayed'' by the closure and revealed
that he renewed his offer to buy in a fax at 2pm yesterday.
He described Mr Hinton's claim that no ``credible'' owner for the title could
be found as

Continued from Page 1
``untrue and dishonourable'' and claimed he had been treated with
``discourtesy''.
Mr Al Fayed wrote: ``I think Today can still be a national asset. It is bad for
democracy when a newspaper is killed off.
``Given the opportunity, I would have made a substantial investment to create a
great newspaper in which the whole country could have taken pride.''
Today revolutionised the British newspaper industry when it was launched in
March 1986 by Eddy Shah. It was the first national paper to use computer
technology, full-colour printing, and to dispense with the traditional printing
unions. However, although it blazed a trail for others, its own sales never
reached the level its editors hoped for.
As recently as May, Mr Murdoch appeared determined to keep the paper going.
``We see a gaping opportunity in the young, middle-class market, and we plan a
multi-million pound promotional and editorial expenditure that will add
substantial extra value and circulation,'' he said at the time.
Labour leader Tony Blair expressed his dismay at the news from Wapping. ``Under
Richard Stott's editorship, the paper ran some great campaigns, consistently
told the truth about the Tories, and became an excellent newspaper,'' he said.
A United Newspapers spokesman denied rumours that it was closing the Daily Star
and that Mr Murdoch had bought a stake in the company, which also owns the
Daily and Sunday Express.

DEBORAH Campbell decided when she left school that she wanted to study art; if
that proved to be impossible, her second choice was geology. Now, 12 years out
of Glasgow School of Art, she is launching her Munro Collection: a group of
Scotland's Munro mountains, painted by her and offered as fine limited edition
prints.
What Deborah Campbell has captured superbly well, is the summits of these
mountains, their uniqueness, their cliffs and corries, and eagle's-eye glimpses
of the panoramas far below. Her rocks are living and vital, capturing the
characters and complexities of the stones.
Her paintings have been sold in shops and galleries throughout Scotland.
However, as a one-woman business, she has pragmatically decided that offering
mail-order limited edition prints - to which she will add a new collection
annually - makes a lot more sense than sorties around her diverse range of
customers.
Ms Campbell started hillwalking and climbing with her father, as a child. ``I
thought I'd done about 65 Munros,'' she laughed. ``People kept asking me how
many, and when I started counting I found it was only about 50. Because I have
my favourites, I tend to go up and down these all the time.''
Ben Nevis, she thinks, is probably her favourite. ``It's a spectacular walk. It
is probably the most-climbed Munro in Scotland, but everybody tends to go up
the tourist path.''
As a Glaswegian, Ben Lomond has always been her local Munro, and therefore
amongst her favourites. ``It's probably the first Munro I ever did - like a lot
of other people. It took me three visits to get the view that I've painted,
which is from the rear of the summit, showing the cliffs towards Loch Lomond.''
Deborah Campbell's limited edition print collection numbers nine. ``Next year I
hope to produce another six, larger and smaller sizes. My panoramic print of
Ben Nevis is a limited edition of 600, for example, while Ben Lomond is 850.''
Who buys the prints? ``Climbers and hillwalkers, generally older men, and I've
sold to people for their boardrooms.''
Her eye is on the American market for her Munro collection. She is regularly
commissioned to paint murals for a firm of architects, and her work features in
such establishments as Yes and the Big Blue. She also paints naive-style
Mexican-inspired theatrical set pictures . . . entrepreneurial, talented and
diverse. Deborah Campbell's is a name to watch.

THE formal launch last week of a trust aimed at attracting #50m of extra
research funds to Scotland in only five years highlights the phenomenal growth
already taking place in the biomedical sector.
Worldwide, the market for the products of bio-technology is expected to grow
more than 25-fold to #76bn by the year 2000 from a base of only #3bn in 1990.
An estimated two million new jobs could be created in Europe in the next five
years through the introduction of bio-technology products. Last year alone
biotech companies raised more than #150m on the London Stock Exchange.
Yet Europe has only 25% of the global market, although still ahead of Japan's
20%. The clear world leader is the United States with 40%.
However, the world's pharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking for
strategic alliances and outside research laboratories as their costs spiral.
The latest estimate of the average cost of bringing a new drug to market is
#250m.
In the US 80 state-funded centres have already been established to develop the
biotech industry, including ``Genetown'' in Worcester, Massachusetts, ``Biotech
Beach'' in San Diego, and ``Biotech Bay'' in San Francisco.
Scotland, which already produces 4000 university graduates in the biomedical
sciences every year, is now setting out to establish ``Biotech Glen''.
The Scottish Biomedical Research Trust - founded by the universities of
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Strathclyde and Paisley - will offer
a single-door approach to research and technology in the sector.
It will search for new pharmaceuticals, immunotherapies, gene therapies,
diagnostic procedures, and biomedical devices.
Among the areas of expertise already identified are research into
cardiovascular conditions, neurosciences, cancer, inflammatory diseases,
respiratory diseases, immunology, infectious diseases, bone disease, diabetes
and gene therapy.
Examples include Glasgow University's Clinical Research Initiative in Heart
Failure and the Cardiovascular Research Unit in Edinburgh which is a national
centre for coronary artery disease.
Edinburgh researchers discovered how cells orchestrate their own death and were
the first to realise that the failure of damaged cells to do so allows certain
cancers to arise and grow.
Aberdeen University's Department of Physics Applied to Medicine is applying a
range of technologies to medical imaging; Strathclyde's National Centre of
Proesthetics and  Orthotics designs and manufac- turers replacement limbs; and
Paisley has a well-developed expertise in biosensor technology.
The pharmaceutical industry is already collaborating with Scottish
universities. Glaxo-Wellcome has established a diabetes research lab within the
institute of Medical Sciences in Aberdeen and endowed a chair of respiratory
medicine at Edinburgh.
And the Fujisawa Institute of Neuroscience is a #5m collaboration between
Edinburgh University and Japan's Fujisawa pharmaceutical company.
``One of the key markets is Japan, whose companies are globalising and putting
research labs into Europe,'' says the trust's chief executive, Dr Stephen
Hammond, who has held senior positions in large pharmaceutical companies such
as Astra, Smithkline Beecham and Glaxo.
``The UK as a whole has a poor record of spin-out companies. There is still a
divide between academia and industry.''
The trust, which is based in Clydebank, is being funded by the Healthcare
Liaison Office (HLO) of Dunbartonshire Enterprise. Any jobs created will tend
to be high-value ones.
``It takes an estimated #67,000 to create one research job,'' says HLO director
David Macauley.
Trust chairman Dr Jim Stewart, who in 1987 became managing director of
Ciba-Ceigy Pharmaceuticals in the UK and is responsible for 1000 staff and
sales of #120m, says: ``World pharmaceutical markets continue to show strong
growth potential.
``Companies in Europe, Japan and the USA are looking increasingly for external
research to help them bring new products to market. The trust will be working
hard to attract a greater share of the spend.
``The more research work we can bring to Scotland, the more jobs we create and
the greater the opportunity for long-term commercial spin-off.''
An example of the potential for commercial spin-off is the Fluosam system,
which combines opto-electronics and immunochemistry to produce a test which
could deliver the results of cervical cancer smear tests within an hour,
eliminating the need to transport the specimens to a distant lab.
This would mean tests could be carried out at local clinics, by GPs or even by
nurses, saving time and resources, and it could eliminate the need for
exhausting visual inspections, so reducing errors.
It was developed by Bio-Medical Instrumentation Ltd, headed by Dr John
Scholefield, based initially at Strathclyde University but now in new premises
provided with the help of Dunbartonshire Enterprise.
When the system underwent trials alongside conventional testing methods, it
performed well. Its potential is enormous: 80 million smear tests are carried
out in Europe and the US every year.

SCOTLAND began their preparations for the European Championship finals in
earnest yesterday. The threat of a play-off had gone, though manager Craig
Brown had never seen that as a real worry, and the plans were being laid for
the cross-Border invasion next summer. Yesterday, the SFA had men in England
looking at hotels where the team may stay once they know the section they will
be in.
Bonuses for players have already been decided. John Collins has already earned
#27,900 as the one player who appeared in all 10 qualifying matches. His match
fees were worth #3000; points bonuses gave him another #6900, and then there is
a share of the #300,000 lump sum which is split among the players on a pro-rata
nature. His share of that came to #18,000.
Now, in the finals themselves, the players will be paid #1500 per game with an
additional #1000 per game for players who did not take part in the matches.
There will also be a share of a #152,000 lump sum.
Similarly, a semi-final situation would involve #168,000 divided among the
players. In the event of them winning the competition, #332,000 would be split
among the squad.
Brown maintained yesterday: ``The money doesn't matter to these players. I
think the SFA have done remarkably well to offer this kind of bonus system for
the players, but you have to remember they are all earning massive amounts of
cash with their clubs. Playing for their country is still a matter of pride.''
However, the increase in match fees alone is a significant move by the men at
Park Gardens, who clearly realise that their payments must be comparable to
those the players receive at club level.
Brown believes his squad's view of the bonuses was summed up when captain Gary
McAllister was still asking after the San Marino victory what the players had
earned.
``He honestly didn't know,'' said Brown, ``and that shows the commitment of
this group. They are not motivated by money. You can see that when you hand
them their caps after a game. You can sense their pride in receiving that
honour from their country.''
The most worrying feature now for Brown is eventually having to tell some of
these men that they will not have that honour in England.
``It will be one of the worst things about this job,'' he said, and added:
``There will be no flannel from me, because professional players see through
that. They will be told, and they will know that it will be done with honesty
and fairness. I have to look at the squad and decide which players will be most
appropriate for the games. I am sure there will be emotion involved, but I will
not shirk anything. I can't do that.''
Aberdeen striker Scott Booth has emerged as the main man up front and Brown was
at pains to point out his scoring record of five goals in nine games. Brown
said: ``That is amazing. If he continues that scoring rate then he will be up
there with Gary Lineker.
``But, remember, we could have Duncan Ferguson back, we can play Eoin Jess
either up front or in midfield, and you can never discount Ally McCoist. He is
such an enthusiast. He came on and scored again and between now and the summer
I'll be watching him. I am sure he'll continue to get sharper and sharper.''
Brown has both a full international and a B international against Denmark in
April. He wants another game, at home, in March and then he will look for a
short tour to hone the players to fitness before they go to England early in
June.
His main concern is the gap between the end of the season in both England and
Scotland and the start of the championships. The season ends on May 4 - the
tournament begins on June 8.
Brown said: ``The only players who will be in training after May 4 are those
involved in the cup finals, which are scheduled for May 18. What we will do is
have everyone together in February, when fitness levels will be checked by the
doctor.
``Then, those who are not playing in the cup finals will be given a special,
individual fitness programme to follow until the squad gets together for the
tour games around May 22.
``We hope to have two matches, one in the United States and the other in
Canada.''

THE proliferation of software and information technology companies in Scotland
makes them an important part of the country's economic regeneration. Glasgow
alone is home to 240 firms, about a third of the Scottish total.
A well-trained workforce and good technical ability means many countries are
already aware of Scotland's reputation in technology manufacturing. Keeping up
that workforce and enhancing that reputation will ensure Scotland's success
continues.
However, Scottish firms are not developing as fast as they might. Glasgow
Development Agency has introduced a number of initiatives to help these firms
become more competitive. It aims to teach companies the importance of marketing
to help them reach their full potential.
``GDA believes that while companies' technical competence is outstanding, the
high-calibre workforce and better use of commercial considerations and
marketing techniques could result in significant growth and development,'' says
GDA spokesman Denny Macgee.
The Software Marketing Scheme provides grants of up to 50% of the full cost of
implementing marketing initiatives designed to help improve overall performance.
Services to Software Ltd is another GDA venture, this time enlisting the help
of Glasgow University, Glasgow Caledonian University, and the National
Engineering Laboratory. Its remit is to help software firms overcome technical
problems.
January of this year saw the opening of the Glasgow Software Centre by the GDA
and BAeSEMA. The centre, at Atlantic Quay, provides premises for growing
software companies almost ready to go on the market. Five firms are currently
developing there.
``This is another important element in our strategy to help software companies
be-come more com-petitive,'' says Jim Johnstone of BAeSEMA, facilities manager
of the Software Centre.
``Marketing is the fundamental missing link in many companies' ability to
develop and grow. This scheme aims to harvest the technical expertise of
Glasgow's software companies, while allowing them to focus on customers and
their needs.''
Scotland is already known for the quality of its workforce. Universities and
colleges provide excellent training in a wide variety of information technology
subjects and qualifications. Strangely, however, the only place in Britain
which offers an SVQ in Software Production - an essential part of the industry
- is based in the West Midlands.
Computeach International Ltd runs a unique training centre providing City &amp;
Guilds, NVQs and SVQs in all aspects of information technology. The difference
is that all courses are run by distance or open learning, which company
chairman George Parkinson believes offers more to people in training than many
Government schemes.
``The Government devotes huge sums of our taxes to the problem of career
development for the unemployed, and incarcerates great numbers of them on a
variety of training schemes and program-mes,'' he says.
``Trainees on such courses are listed as full-time students and so are not
included in the unemployment statistics. If people are available for work while
learning they cannot be used to reduce the unemployment figures, and that's the
very reason open learning is in a political wilderness.''
Parkinson in fact pioneered the open learning concept in the UK. In 1964, when
information technology was just beginning to show its importance, he wanted to
provide training across the country for those who wanted to learn more about
this developing field.
He founded Computeach International Ltd (CIL) at University House in the West
Midlands. Since then it has grown in size, with students not only all over the
country, but all over the world.
The company has re-cently been awarded SVQ assessment centre status by SCOTVEC
and is a recognised examination centre for the City &amp; Guilds of London
Institute, where C&amp;G examinations are held on a monthly basis.
``By awarding us SVQ status, SCOTVEC has given us a vote of confidence,'' says
CIL managing director Paul Harrison. ``It has shown that distance is no object
for people throughout Scotland who want to train for a career in the booming IT
industry.''
CIL helps students find work through its JobSearch initiative. It provides
assistance in compiling CVs, in letter-writing and coaching in interview
techniques. It also provides a free service for employers which matches their
specifications with student qualifications.
Parkinson hopes to show the Government the value of distance learning as an IT
training option. ``With successful students now working in all areas of
industry and commerce, we have shown the Government the way,'' he says.
``Distance learning gets results.''

HEARTS chairman Chris Robinson won the night when the club's shareholders met
for the annual meeting at Ingliston last night.
He took on former owner Wallace Mercer and shareholder Dr Gavin Kennedy, and
received the backing of the majority of the 1000-strong audience.
Afterwards, Robinson said: ``I hope that this lays the ghost of Wallace Mercer.
Now we must go forward.''
Manager Jim Jefferies, who was on the platform with the directors, announced
also that the signings of Italian Pasquale Bruno and Swede Hans Eskilsson are
``ninety-nine per cent certain to be completed tomorrow.''
Two new directors from the new shareholders, John Frame and Ian McCallum, were
voted on to the board.
Mercer had leapt to his feet after the meeting had been going for more than an
hour and demanded to know why he had not been given the opportunity to meet
Robinson since the takeover.
Robinson responded angrily: ``I have met you. I had breakfast with you in the
Balmoral Hotel, and I had to ask you not to interfere with transfer dealings of
this club. ``You ignored me and you spoke to David Murray about Alan McLaren's
transfer to Rangers.''
Mercer then asked: ``Is Colin Wilson, my nominee director, happy with the
business affairs?'' Wilson answered by saying: ``I have had to go to law to get
details. I have been marginalised. I have not had access to the accounts and
this has been wrong.''
Robinson stressed that his fellow director had never once minuted these claims
and, indeed, had been given quarterly access to the accounts which was the
agreement.
Robinson also gave a strong rebuttal to the much-publicised claims made by Dr
Kennedy, who had suggested that the club was facing severe financial problems.
Robinson said: ``We have the support of the bank until May 1996. They are
allowing us the same overdraft facility as we have now.'' The club is almost
#5m in debt.
There was criticism from the floor over the accounts and even a suggestion that
Hearts were ``trading insolvent,'' but the chairman referred to what he termed
a ``hole in the accounts'' when he took over - which meant the Tynecastle side
was more than #1.37m worse off than he and his partner Deans had believed.

<HEADLINE>More and bigger herds could be the key to Aberdeen-Angus dominating quality end of market Macphie aims to beef up business</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND needs another 50 Aberdeen-Angus herds of up to 300 head if the breed
is to realise its potential to dominate the quality end of the beef market at
home and overseas.
That is the view of Stewart Macphie of Glenbervie, near Stonehaven, whose
family business is the largest privately owned supplier of sauces and mixes to
the bakery industry in Britain.
He has followed his own advice on the home farm at Glenbervie where he has,
over the last three years, created a pedigree Aberdeen-Angus herd based on two
outstanding bulls and 200 breeding cows dedicated to commercial purposes.
One of the bulls, Castle of Mey Quartz, bought from the Queen Mother, will be
seen at this year's Smithfield Farm Tech show at Earls Court where Macphie will
be exhibiting for the first time.
The aim will be to show other farmers how the company set out to get added
value for its product. For the Macphie family that means an investment of about
#1.4m which includes the establishment of the herd and the creation of a
butchery unit.
The output from that unit will be aimed at the quality end of the market such
as the Savoy Hotel Group, certain chefs nominated by Egon Ronay, and leading
outlets in the capitals of Europe.
The intention is not to corner a market for Macphie, however. The company
anticipates buying in beasts from other producers provided the quality is
right. It will start off next summer with about 10 carcasses a week but hopes
to build up quickly to 50.
The new butchery unit will create about 10 jobs and will satisfy the most
stringent hygiene regulations. At the same time there will be a return to some
traditional standards such as allowing meat to hang for 14-21 days.
An important part of the strategy will be to get a premium price for
forequarters beef. Here Macphie's food enterprise and farming interests will
combine. Much of the forequarter output will be cooked on site into oven-ready
meals such as lasagne and stroganoff which will be marketed through
delicatessens and private High Street retailers.
Stewart Macphie also promises a pie of chopped beef covered with lattice pastry
of a standard which could be served in a five-star hotel.
Quality is of vital importance to the future of beef, he insists, and he is
scathing about Scottish butchers who ``want to destroy 40% of an animal by
putting it through a mincing machine''. His own aim is to get a premium price
wherever possible.
If he does achieve that target he is prepared to share his success. One of his
declared ambitions is to pay the highest prices in Scotland to farmers for any
stock bought in.
``We will push the price up and cut out the middle man,'' he said. ``After two
years we hope to show farmers a balance sheet which will make the profits of
the North-east co-operatives look skinny.''
John Lohoar, farm manager at Glenbervie, said that the pedigree herd had begun
to be established in October 1992. ``We can trace our animals back for three
generations,'' he said. ``Our idea is to control everything from conception to
consumption.''
Stewart Macphie is resigned to the fact that in order to meet the demand for
``Continental'' cuts he may have to look to Holland for a butcher. ``There are
not too many butchers in Scotland with that kind of experience,'' he said. ``I
would like the job to go to a Scot but it has to go to the best applicant.''

WINTER is fast taking a grip, but there are a few, almost reflex, actions we
take to protect ourselves from the driving rain and icy-cold winds.
Warm coats, boots, gloves, scarves and even hats shield areas of exposed skin -
but what about the face? - probably the area of skin we worry most about
keeping in top condition.
As we wrap our bodies, so there are treatments designed to ``wrap up'' our
skin, keeping it smooth yet strong during the ravages of a Scottish winter.
At Yours Faithfully in Hope Street, beauty therapist Sandra McCafferty works
towards this on the floor above the popular hair salon. This is Yours
Faithfully's first venture into the beauty world, but already Sandra has a list
of faithful clients.
With the comprehensive range of E'spa products, Sandra can help you take the
natural road to relaxation and healthy skin. E'spa is a British company which
uses only plant extracts in its treatments. The versatility of each means that
Sandra can mix and blend to achieve the right balance for each skin type.
``E'spa are also very competitively priced,'' Sandra said. ``They keep the
packaging to a bare minimum and don't use widespread advertising, but
word-of-mouth has already made them a popular choice.''
One of the most relaxing treatments that Sandra recommends is the back, scalp
and face package.
``After a back massage with E'spa oils, we give the client a facial. As this is
left to work, we massage deep into the scalp with clay which nourishes the hair
and scalp,'' Sandra added.
With coughs and colds tearing through the workplace at the moment, E'spa also
have a range of anti-infection treatments. While they can't promise to stop
colds coming, they have helped to keep them at bay, staving off the worst
effects.
Yours Faithfully offers the full range of beauty procedures from electrolysis
to manicures, pedicures, waxing and colour analysis, a computer-generated guide
to the perfect palette of colours to complement your skin.
And, with taking the stress out of Christmas in mind, there are gift boxes and
vouchers available to boost the spirits of a woman or man who may be prone to
the January blues.
``It's a relaxing way of approaching the Christmas rush,'' said Sandra. ``The
treatments have cosmetic and therapeutic benefits, but some clients find just
the process of getting away from it all and chatting on a one-to-one basis a
great therapy in itself.''

SAMANTHA Smith maintained a British presence in the Texaco Women's Challenger
event in Edinburgh when she upset top-seed Sandra Kleinova to book her place in
today's semi-final, writes Judy Murray.
Smith trailed the Czech 4-1 in the first set but after having broken back in
the seventh game, Smith dropped her own delivery in the tenth and Kleinova
clinched the set 6-4.
The Czech looked to have the match under control when she broke in the second
game of the second set, but when the British No.9 reeled off the next three
games to take the lead for the first time, Kleinova's suspect temperament
presented itself, and she received code violation for firing a ball into the
viewing gallery.
Smith's winning run continued as she produced some spectacular forehands to
break Kleinova after six deuces in the vital seventh game and went on to pocket
the set 6-2 when the favourite netted a forehand return.
The 17-year-old, prone to verbal outbursts, dissolved into tears when her first
serve was called out on the second point of the final set, and although she
went on to win the opening game, Smith regained control and won the next six
for a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory.
She now meets Seda Noorlander, from Holland, who beat Paula Hermida 7-6, 1-6,
6-2, while Russian teenager Julia Lutrova, a 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 victor over
Australian Nicole Pratt, takes on third-seed Marion Maruska who recovered from
4-1 down to beat German qualifier Sabine Gerke 6-4, 6-1.

SCOTTISH internationals Bobby Quinn (Kilbarchan AC) and Steve Wylie (Cambuslang
Harriers) are only reserves for the British six-man team for the second
Weetabix European Cross Country Championships at Alnwick Castle,
Northumberland, on December 2. Last weekend they finished third and fourth
respectively in one of the two nominated trial races at Margate and must feel
unlucky not to be selected.
Andrew Pearson (Longwood Harriers) leads the team - with 26 countries taking
part - having finished eleventh last year at the same venue and twentieth
(eighth European) in the World Championships last March in Durham. British
Teams:
Men - A Pearson (Longwood), K Cullen (Chelmsford), J Brown (Sheffield), C Jones
(Eryri), C Udall (Burton), D Taylor (Blackheath). Reserves - B Quinn
(Kilbarchan), S Wylie (Cambuslang), S Barden (GEC). Women - S Bentley (Stoke),
L Elliott (Liverpool), J Shields (Sheffield), E Talbot (Bedford), S Young
(Salford). Reserves - H Heaseman (Invicta), E Foster (Charnwood), A Whitcombe
(Parkside).
American football
SCOTLAND is set for another team, though it is likely to be strictly amateur.
Lothian Raiders hope to join the Scottish Gridiron Association League next
season and have appealed for players. Naveed Akbar, a cornerback with the
Edinburgh Eagles, said: ``We have more than 20 players from the Eagles and we
want to get more. Any player interested can contact me on 01592-782358.''
Ice hockey
FIFE Flyers have signed Great Britain youth internationalist Les Millie from
Sheffield Steelers. The Kirkcaldy-born forward will make his comeback with his
first senior club in tomorrow's Premier Division match against Slough Jets at
the Fife rink.
Squash
SCOTLAND'S hopes of at least repeating the ninth place of two years ago
disappeared in a whitewash defeat from Wales in yesterday's world championships
in Cairo. Alasdair Taylor, despite suffering from a back injury and flu
symptoms, put up a good performance in losing in five games to David Evans in
the top match. Heavy defeats for Dave Gordon and Alan Thomson put Scotland into
the play-offs for places 13 to 16. Details: D Evans beat A Taylor 3-2, A Gough
beat D Gordon 3-1, G Davies beat A Thomson 3-0).
Meanwhile, England stormed into the semi-finals with a 3-0 win against Canada
to set up a clash with host nation Egypt. Egypt lost to both England and
Pakistan in the qualifying rounds but found the inspiration to beat Finland 2-1
in their quarter-final.
Pakistan, who lost their final qualifying match to the English team after
deciding to rest world champion Jansher Khan, beat New Zealand 2-1 to reach the
semis. Second string player Zarak Jahan lost badly to Glen Wilson and today
will be even tougher for the second-seeded Pakistanis as their semi-final
opponents are top seeds Australia, who beat South Africa 3-0 today.
Other results: Division 1 - Edinburgh Sports 3 (15), SSRC 2 (8); Glasgow Accies
0 (2), Bridge of Allan 5 (20); Aberdeen 5 (20), Dunfermline 0 (4).

q WHILE training in information technology will keep Scotland at the forefront
of an expanding industry, training by information technology gets results of
its own, writes JOAN GRADY.
The Scottish Interactive Technology Centre (SiTC) is an independent body, based
in Edinburgh, committed to promoting and supporting the use of information
technology in Scotland. It helps companies with the design, development and
production of interactive multimedia products for use in the commercial and
public sectors.
Among the many products available are interactive training videos. Information
is stored on a videodisk, which can be played back through specialised
equipment linked to a PC. It is accessed by trainees via an on-screen ``icon''
or ``hot area''. Users need simply ``click'' a mouse or touch the screen to
activate the video clip they want to see.
SiTC advises on the equipment needed and program design, and it teaches
companies how to use interactive video as a training tool. The most immediate
advantage is that employers can tailor a program to suit their needs.
As with open learning, interactive video gives the trainee control over his or
her own progress. The disks can fast-forward or freeze-frame just like a
conventional video cassette, so he or she can pick out necessary information or
bypass any which has already been covered.
Disks can be programmed to offer several sets of circumstances for any
particular problem, allowing a more thorough examination of the situation.
As a method of training, interactive video appears to catch the imagination of
trainees. The US army found that training using interactive video increased
retention by up to 40%. It is also suitable for group use, or for tutor-led
sessions.
And it doesn't need a mountain of gadgets or vast knowledge of computer
systems, expensive textbooks or costly training sessions.

SCOTLAND'S Appointments reporters helped Arnold Markson get an answer to why he
lost out on work in a call centre, the fast-growing sector featured last week.
it was our report last month on combating age discrimination which first led
him to contact us. It had quoted TSB Bank as saying: ``We welcome all
candidates, whatever their age.''
In September Mr Markson, 59, had telephoned the TSB in response to an
advertisement in The Herald for telemarketing supervisors at its Glasgow
PhoneBank Centre.
He had been made redundant six months earlier and although his degree is in
chemistry and his experience in the food industry, he is computer literate,
having taught himself desk-top publishing.
Applicants were telephoned to assess their telephone voice after which a phone
interview would be arranged. Mr Markson was telephoned on September 29. ``When
I told her my age, the girl said I wasn't eligible for the job because anyone
over 59 was too old.
``I was told I had been on the interview list but that I couldn't be any
longer.''
An upset Mr Markson wrote to TSB for an explanation, without success, and to
Employment Minister Cheryl Gillian, who publicly supports anti-ageism policies,
before contacting The Herald.
We contacted TSB's Scottish head office in Edinburgh. ``We don't talk about
individuals - it's our policy not to,'' said a spokesman. ``If this person
writes to us we'll certainly write back.''
Last week TSB did write to Mr Markson, explaining that although it encourages
applications from people over 50, it requires all staff to retire at 60 so ``a
business decision has been taken not to accept applications from people aged 59
and over''.

<TEXT>
THE Scottish Football League, concerned by the disciplinary lapses in the game,
yesterday made a bold decision to push for acceptance of television evidence
and pressure will now be put on the SFA, who continue to claim video pictures
should not be used, even though that view is obviously out of step with modern
times, writes James Traynor.
The majority of chairmen of the country's premier division clubs said in The
Herald on Wednesday the time had come to use television evidence, which can be
employed to prove innocence and not only guilt. The chairmen also believe that
by making it clear football will use every reasonable method to improve
on-field discipline, the police might be able to resist the temptation to
enforce the genuine law of the land.
Already some clubs have altered their views. They have come to accept the folly
of turning a blind eye to incidents which are shown on television and realise
now that football's failure to act on such evidence left them open to criticism.
The SFA's council recently rejected overwhelmingly the use of film, but they
are to be pressed again after yesterday Scottish League Management Committee
meeting, at which SFL president Yule Craig, who is a member of the SFA's
disciplinary committee, was instructed to present their views on Monday.
The disciplinary meeting now has a busy schedule, because the members are also
to consider various matters of alleged indiscipline involving Rangers' Paul
Gascoigne, John Brown, and Alan McLaren, and Billy Dodds, of Aberdeen. All four
were involved in scenes, one or more of which prompted intervention from the
procurator-fiscal.
The committee will also be investigating incidents involving Alan Lawrence, of
Hearts, when his side last played Rangers, Sean Sweeney's alleged kick at
Dundee's Morten Weighorst, and the double sending off last week of the
Dumbarton keeper, Ian McFarlane, in a match against Airdrie.
The premier division representatives at yesterday's meeting were Rangers
secretary-director Campbell Ogilvie, Douglas Cromb, of Hibs, Jim Oliver, of
Partick Thistle, and Kilmarnock's Bob Fleeting.
In addition, the Falkirk chairman, George Fulston, was present as
vice-president of the League, but he is not in favour of television evidence.
While the representatives of the first, second, and third divisions did not
take any direct line, it is known that Airdrie's George Peat gave his backing
even though one of his own players, Sweeney, could be punished perhaps because
his alleged kick was seen on television.
The indications are that, when the issue is raised at the SFA's disciplinary
committee, it will be remitted to the executive committee, which is the body
able to recommend changes of policy.

EVERY engaged couple looks forward to their wedding day as something to
remember - a day which is geared to be unique to them and the start of their
lives together.
There are few venues which can guarantee a wedding in the most beautiful of
settings - but Gleddoch House is one. Walking up the gravel driveway toward the
hotel entrance gives you a feeling of being truly ``away from it all'' when in
reality, the hotel is just half-a-mile from the Langbank/Houston exit off the
M8 to Greenock.
In true country house tradition, the grounds at Gleddoch are immaculately kept,
and perfect for stunning wedding photographs.
Although each wedding is tailor made, there is a basic wedding package, which
for 1996 costs #450. This includes private use of the garden restaurant for the
day (depending on guest numbers), personalised Gleddoch scroll menus and
in-house table plans and place cards, table flowers, a changing room for the
bride and groom, the use of a silver cake stand and knife and use of the
hotel's luxurious honeymoon suite, complete with four-poster bed.
Those couples who have already booked their wedding venue may care to consider
Gleddoch's honeymoon night package, which can be tailored to include champagne
and flowers on your arrival. As most newly-weds arrive later in the evening,
accommodation and breakfast are included in this package, which can be expanded
to a longer stay. There is a courtesy car to Glasgow Airport.
Next Sunday is the ideal opportunity to see what Gleddoch House can offer.
There will be a Wedding Fayre at the hotel from 1pm to 5pm on November 26.
Macbee Bridal are the bridal wear specialists at the fayre, who promote the
individuality of the bride. Evidence of their work will be on the catwalk when
they stage a bridal fashion show at 3pm.
For the groom, Houston Menswear will be there to give advice on dress hire,
with everything from morning suits to full Highland outfits. And, for the
mother of the bride, Catherine's of Partick will have some suggestions.
Lightbody's of Hamilton will have advice on wedding cakes, Style Video are
there to explain how best to capture the day on film and Graeme Wilson
photography will have examples of his comprehensive wedding work.
Frasers of Glasgow will explain how their wedding registry operates, and the
store will also have Elizabeth Arden make up experts on hand.
An individual approach to wedding stationery comes from Something Original who
use celtic influences and designs inspired by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for
their range.
Gleddoch have chosen Flower Vogue as an example of inventive but dependable
floristry, and Little Chauffeur Drive for car hire to get you to your venue on
time.
Entertainment is also represented by the Neil Drover Agency, who can provide
bands which will please a whole spectrum of guests.
Gleddoch have made their own extremely special contribution to the day, with a
competition for brides-to-be. There will be a prize draw on the day in which
one bride will win the #450 wedding package explained in detail earlier.
The other two prizes are wedding stationery vouchers from Something Original,
and Elizabeth Arden will give both a trial and wedding day make-over to a lucky
bride along with True Love and Cerruti fragrances.
The memorable surroundings of Gleddoch stem from the fact that it was once a
private house, owned by shipping baron Sir James Lithgow. It is now in its
twenty-first year as a hotel, the tenth under its current owners.
It can also provide corporate golf packages, clay pigeon shooting, off-road
driving and an equestrian centre.
Conferences and meetings are also catered for. The choice of mouth watering
meals on the restaurant menu, the majority of which use local produce, is
enough to make business a pleasure. And, for an outstanding treat this
Christmas or New Year, Gleddoch is the last word in getting away from it all. A
taste of aristocratic living is closer than you would ever think.

THIRTY-seven shopping days to Christmas. Can you bear it? Fighting to find a
parking place - which could well add considerably to your shopping bill - the
hassle of pushing your way through crowded pavements, braving whatever the
elements choose to throw at you . . . lots of legwork getting between streets
and shops.
But The Forge Shopping Centre believes it can offer shoppers all the answers
this festive season. Its glittering glass pyramids cover a mighty 450,000 sq.ft
of retailing space which includes no fewer than 75 High Street names, one of
the largest Asda superstores in Scotland - which has just completed a #4m refit
- a drive-thru McDonald's and a seven-screen cinema.
Before you even venture inside the immaculately kept mall where lavish
Christmas decorations can't help but put you in the festive mood, you'll find
free car parking for 1800 cars, with special places reserved for the disabled,
close to the entrances. Should the weather be inclement, covered walkways will
see you arrive at the Centre dry and unharassed. Once there, you can enjoy the
comfortable temperatures of the bright, airy mall which are well-maintained,
and relax as you browse among the huge range of shops. When you feel like a cup
of coffee or a meal, you'll find a choice of five menus at the Food Fair.
Among the newest names at The Forge, are the Early Learning Centre; Adams
childrenswear; All Sports - a company just moving into Scotland - which carries
a large range of sports equipment and clothing; Holland and Barrett the health
food specialist; travel agents Going Places, and Bodycare. Despite The Forge
being only seven years old, a number of shops - in addition to Asda's major
revamp - have been refitted. Index, for example, has invested #100,000 in such
an exercise, while Stead and Simpson shoes has also updated its store.
What The Forge is aiming to do, is provide a shopping experience which embraces
each member of the family. Christmas epitomises this. November 25 sees the
opening of Santa's Grotto, located on the central concourse's sunken area,
outside Asda.
Here, the younger members of the family can receive a gift (valued at up to
twice the Grotto charge of #1.50 according to the Centre), and have a
photograph taken. There will be animations and lots of fun. Each child visiting
Santa's Grotto will be entered into a competition. The prize? A family holiday
to Lapland, to meet Santa.
All visitors to The Forge will enjoy the traditional carol singing which is
laid on over the festive lead-up, along with street theatre, puppet shows and
clowns to keep everyone entertained. Look out too, for Santa's postbox, where
children can pop in their Christmas lists - those who supply their address,
will get a reply.
From November 27, a free gift-wrapping service for goods bought at The Forge,
will operate in the run-up to Christmas, although it may be impractical to
maintain this during peak periods. All the more reason then, to get there at
the beginning of the week or in the mornings, before business becomes really
brisk.
These more tranquil periods, are the times favoured by the many disabled
customers whose patronage The Forge enjoys, who appreciate the thoughtful
gestures of real support which are offered to them along with consultation on
their needs. Facilities include: easy parking, covered walkways, level access
to malls, wheelchair loan for use in the centre, roomy lifts, drop kerbs,
ramps, automatic doors and toilets on both evels, and low-level direction
boards.
The Forge is open seven days a week, with Thursday late opening night. The week
before Christmas, it is planned that all shops will be open until 8pm daily,
with Asda open certain nights until 10pm. On Boxing Day and on January 2, the
Centre will open from 11am-5pm and there will be plenty of entertainment laid
on, as well as the enticing prospect of sale bargains.
Vincent Lochrie is the Centre's manager. He said: ``It is my aim to ensure that
everyone who comes to shop here has a trouble-free and pleasant visit. We pride
ourselves on the cleanliness of the mall, staff courtesy, and the pleasant
shopping atmosphere that we have strived to create.``Parking in all our 1800
spaces is absolutely free, and uniformed security officers and hi-tech CCTV
cameras cover our carparks to help ensure the safety and security of your
vehicle.''
Compared with many areas, The Forge is a cinch to get to. Simply follow the M8
to Junction 12, then follow the signs for Parkhead. Situated next door to
Celtic Football Stadium, its glass pyramid construction provides a distinctive,
easy-to-spot landmark.

SOME members of the family are no doubt, more enthusiastic about shopping than
others, but Christmas at The Forge means that everyone can find something to
please. The youngsters may prefer to watch a movie - there's a very popular
Saturday morning film club - while their parents shop, and dad may like to
sidle off to watch some of the entertainment . . . then the whole family can
join up for a meal at the Food Fair or McDonald's. Then on the way home, you
can even fill the car with petrol at the Centre's 24-hour filling station.
Altogether, a total experience.
Services such as banking and building society facilities, cash machines, dry
cleaning and photograph processing are also excellent at The Forge. And
promises of customer care at the Centre are not hollow. Every couple of months
or so, meetings are held with customers who are asked a range of questions, to
give feedback on what they think about The Forge, and what they'd like to see
provided. These customer panels as they are called, have proved to be fertile
forums for positive ideas, and the management has not been slow to implement
them. An excellent example, is the latest, free, customer service offered in
the car parks: changing a car tyre for instance, if you return to your vehicle
to find it flat; or jump starting cars which refuse to start.
Trained personnel have been provided to look after this aspect, and Lex
Vauxhall has laid on a car which tours the car parks on a regular basis, driven
by a Forge employee looking out for anyone who has such a problem. The Centre
will also call motoring organisations for members whose vehicles require their
specialist services.
Mark Stangroom, marketing co-ordinator of The Forge considers: ``These days, of
great importance, is the service you provide. The Forge is very clean and
bright, a nice place to be. Bins are emptied every 15 minutes, loos inspected
half hourly - it all combines to make a very pleasant Centre.
``Sometimes, we get customers who can't remember where they left their cars in
the parks. With our CCTV we can locate them quickly, much to their owner's
relief.''
Summing up, Mr Stangroom says: ``Christmas at The Forge Shopping Centre really
will be something special this year - for all the family. Over the past 12
months, The Forge has undergone a great many improvements which are now being
supplemented by some fantastic Christmas promotions.
``Shops; cinema; foodcourt; Asda and McDonald's; free parking; no city-centre
hassle; everything under cover; and all our entertainments, carol singing and
fun mean we believe visitors to The Forge will be delighted.''

THE pre-Christmas period is the season when beef producers can usually
anticipate high prices for their prime cattle. At present those expectations
are being realised as a result of fewer cattle coming forward and a buoyant
export trade.
However, two recent television programmes, Watchdog and World in Action, have
aroused widespread alarm in both the farming industry and the meat trade with
claims that BSE-infected cattle are being sold in markets and then entering the
food chain.
Meanwhile, livestock auctioneers and the meat trade are at loggerheads over the
imposition of a #3.50 per head levy on all cattle going for slaughter. The meat
trade claims that this should be deducted by auctioneers but they in turn say
that they have no authority to act in this fashion.
The NFU takes a similar line as was clearly stated at the council meeting in
Ingliston earlier this month. The union's view is that any extra costs incurred
in removing spinal tissue should be reflected in the price paid for cattle.
On Monday two English auction marts, Gloucester and Rugby, broke ranks from
their professional organisation and deducted the levy. It now seems certain
that those firms will be expelled from their association. So far Scottish
auction marts remain 100% solid behind the policy of the Institute of
Auctioneers in resisting the levy.
Yesterday a meeting was held in Dunblane between the Scottish Association of
Meat Wholesalers and the auctioneers. No statement was made afterwards but it
is understood that the auctioneers remain totally opposed to any levy.
However, John Scott, the president of the SAMW, remains convinced that farmers
have more to gain than lose by agreeing to pay the levy which is half the #7
the trade believe it costs to comply with the appropriate health regulations.
Mr Scott said: ``We feel that the whole issue has been pushed below the carpet.
If the industry comes clean and accepts that there is a problem and shows a
willingness to pay then there could be a chance of attracting funds from
Brussels to eradicate BSE.''
Earlier this week it emerged that in the Irish Republic a slaughter policy has
been implemented to cope with Ireland's reported cases of no more than 15 per
year. The Irish Government compensates farmers on a herd basis where BSE occurs.
Mr Scott is both a farmer and butcher, running a herd of 200 beef cows, taking
the progeny through to slaughter. He commented: ``I do feel there are many
farmers willing to pay the levy. Some who sell deadweight are already doing so
and this cost is shown specifically on their advice notes. There is a problem,
and there is an enormous amount of disinformation which we have to fight
against.''
Consumer reaction on the high streets of Scotland varied enormously yesterday
with the younger element of shoppers being the most concerned. Outside a major
supermarket a student said: ``I never eat beef, in fact everyone in our flat is
vegetarian.''
A housewife, however, took a different view, ``I still eat beef and I've every
intention of continuing. In fact I had an excellent steak last night.'' A male
shopper, though, was more circumspect saying: ``I'm still eating beef but I'm
more aware about BSE.''

<TEXT>
A CONSULTANT surgeon yesterday claimed he had refused to refer patients to an
experimental research project for hip operations because he thought it was too
risky.
Orthopaedic specialist Thomas Scotland told a fatal accident inquiry into the
death of Mrs Phyllis Moffitt, 70, that he felt the benefits to elderly patients
were outweighed by the risks it posed to their health.
Mr Scotland claimed he and a colleague had both declined to take part in the
Aberdeen University-led project, although the university's ethics committee had
approved it.
The inquiry, at Aberdeen Sheriff Court, was earlier told that Mrs Moffitt
became ill and died at the city's Woodend Hospital while undergoing an
experimental operation as part of the project.
A post-mortem examination revealed she had died of a heart attack after being
given a sedative to ease discomfort during the operation.
The project was designed to see if the incidence of elderly women suffering a
second hip fracture could be reduced by means of a revolutionary injection
process.
Mr Scotland said: ``I was concerned that the perceived benefits of the project
were out-weighed, in my mind, by the potential disadvantages.''
He said he was concerned that the injections would strengthen only the top part
of the hip bone, leaving the lower hip more prone to snapping.
He added: ``I was also concerned that the operative procedure may have serious
consequences for the group of patients involved.''
Most patients over 70 were likely to suffer from other serious diseases,
including coronary heart disease, and an unnecessary operation could put them
in a ``precarious'' state, he said.
Mr Scotland also disputed information contained in a letter sent to potential
volunteers, which claimed the operation would be of great benefit.
``They should have included, somewhere, something about the potential
disadvantages.''
Earlier, pathologist James Grieve said an autopsy report revealed Mrs Moffitt
had severe and significant coronary artery disease, which had caused her death.
Even a very slight drop in blood pressure caused by administering a sedative
may have led Mrs Moffitt's heart to stop, he said.
The inquiry, before Sheriff Peter Hamilton, was adjourned until December 27.

A LUXEMBOURG court ruling which appears to have cleared the way for
compensation payouts to creditors of the crashed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (BCCI) was welcomed cautiously in the Western Isles last night.
The Western Isles Council lost #23m in the BCCI crash.
There are 15,000 creditors in the UK who could now receive #433m.Liquidator
Touche Ross is to make an initial payment of 30% of the total owed, under a
compensation scheme agreed by the bank's leading shareholder, the Sheikh of Abu
Dhabi.
Yesterday Mr Brian Stewart the council's chief executive, who was not with the
council when BCCI crashed in 1991, said: ``I have not seen the details of the
proposed settlement and, therefore, cannot comment fully on it. However, if
reports of a 30% immediate payout to creditors are accurate then this would be
welcome news to the council.
``Any payments would, of course, be used to partially offset the council's
increased borrowing requirement, so that the council's capital spending
capability would not be affected. It would, however, have the effect of
reducing our loan repayments which, in turn, would have a beneficial effect on
the council's revenue finances.
``We will be pressing the liquidators for full details of the settlement and
the likely timing of the first payments to the council.''

BP Exploration has awarded a long-term contract for the provision of a new
purpose-built stand-by and support vessel to cope with the severe weather
conditions in the Foinaven Field, to the west of Shetland.
The MV Grampian Frontier will be owned and operated by North Star Shipping, a
member of the George Craig Group Ltd, and a construction contract will be
awarded shortly.
The vessel will provide the most up-to-date equipment for the rescue and
recovery of personnel including an advanced fast rescue craft with a fully
enclosed wheelhouse for the crew to enable it to operate on its own for several
hours.
The craft will be able to be launched and recovered in poor weather conditions.
The stand-by vessel will also have a scoop-net system for recovering personnel
and lifeboats directly from the sea on to its deck and will have accommodation
for 400 passengers in an emergency.
The multi-million pound vessel is designed to be multi-role and will assist in
the shuttle tanker operations, has a dynamic positioning system to keep her on
station and will be able to deploy a remotely operated vehicle for inspection.
It will also carry oil dispersant chemicals and spray equipment.
Production from the field is expected to start in the spring and a vessel of
similar specification will work in the field until the Grampian Frontier is
commissioned a year later.

THE overall cost of refitting Trident submarines could escalate further unless
more Royal Navy work is soon given to Devonport dockyard, unions claimed
yesterday.
They already have asked for an independent inquiry into claims that the true
cost of building the Trident refit complex at Devonport would be double the
successful #236m bid which won the operators, Devonport Management Ltd, the
refit work two years ago.
Ministers should be called to account because there was a ``sorry history'' in
the Ministry of Defence of ``grotesque mismanagement'', said Transport and
General Workers' Union national secretary Jack Dromey at Plymouth yesterday.
However, a current ``serious shortfall'' of work in the dockyard threatened
further major job losses there, which could in turn lead to the Trident work
costing still more, said Mr Dromey.
Major redundancies were threatened unless there was a decision on further work
by the end of January, he said.
Because of delays at Devonport more nuclear submarine refits were expected to
be diverted to Rosyth, and to prevent threatened job losses at Devoport, Mr
Dromey called for the Ministry of Defence to ``load'' the Plymouth dockyard
with unallocated Royal Navy surface fleet work.

<HEADLINE>Dounreay `would be left with foreign waste'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975339546</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A REPORT published by Greenpeace yesterday claimed that Dounreay would be left
with up to two million litres of foreign radioactive waste.
The Government and Dounreay have continually insisted that        such waste
would be returned to the country of origin.
The report claims that the size of the foreign contracts sought by Dounreay
would mean up to 28,000 litres of waste, but because of the cementation process
employed there would be an 85-fold increase in the volume of waste left at the
Caithness plant.
The authors of the report, Dr Frank Barnaby, a nuclear physicist and former
director of the Stockholm Peace Institute, and Mr Shaun Birnie, Greenpeace
International's nuclear spokesman, were in Inverness yesterday to launch their
report.
Mr Birnie explained their concerns over Dounreay's declared intention to seek
contracts to reprocess at least 6000 of the near 15,000 spent fuel rods of US
origin which are currently lying at research reactors around the world.
Mr Birnie read from Dounreay's own literature which stated that any foreign
waste would be returned to country of origin ``or an equivalent in
radioactivity terms''.
He said most of the countries looking to use Dounreay did not have facilities
to store any waste and the US had made it clear that they might take the waste
back from reprocessing. However, the US would not take waste that resulted from
Dounreay's cementation          process.
``The waste will remain at Dounreay because not only is the US unable to take
the cemented waste in, none of the client states with the exception of Germany,
have facilities and they won't get repositories in the 25 years that Dounreay
puts as the maximum for keeping the waste.''
The UK Atomic Energy Authority's spokesman at Dounreay, Mr Ian Shepherd,
insisted last night that the Greenpeace report contained misinformation.
``We are quite clear that the waste will be returned to the country of origin
and that means returned from Dounreay. As regards the volumes produced, the
report doesn't include any information or figures on the alternatives to
reprocessing.''

A 15-YEAR-OLD schoolboy who led police on a 60-mile chase along single-track
Highland roads at speeds up to 90mph in his mother's car, was yesterday
sentenced to a year in residential care and banned from the road for five years.
Officers, who feared he might crash, injuring himself and others, eventually
had to use a metal spiked stinger to halt the car, Dingwall Sheriff Court was
told. Procurator-fiscal David Hingston said the teenager tricked his mother
into handing over the keys of her Ford Fiesta by claiming he wanted to get
something out of the car.
He then took off at high speed and the alarm was raised. Police chased him as
he headed from Dingwall to Lairg and Ullapool. In Ullapool, he drove at 70mph
in the 30mph limit, and up to 90mph on the wet, greasy, and twisting
single-track roads through the hills and glens.
Other drivers had to take emergency action to avoid the car, which swerved from
side to side as police followed it.
The car was finally stopped at Bonar Bridge in Sutherland, when the stinger was
placed across the road by police to puncture its tyres.
Mr Hingston said the boy, who had been home on review from Rossie School secure
unit, Montrose, appears to have a fascination for cars and seems to be
completely beyond control.
The teenager admitted driving dangerously and without a licence or insurance.
He also pleaded guilty to more than a dozen charges, earlier in October, of
taking or attempting to take away cars without the owners' consent in various
Easter Ross towns.

A UNIQUE co-operative venture which will identify dependants should their carer
be involved in an accident was launched yesterday.
For the first time in Scotland, a carers' emergency card has been launched. The
Princess Royal Trust Carers' Centre in Aberdeen, Grampian Health Board, and the
emergency services are all involved in the project.
The card, which is the size of a credit card, is carried by the carer to alert
the police, ambulance, and fire services that they look after someone who is
dependent on them and provides contact numbers of people who will know what to
do. Initially 10,000 cards will be printed for free distribution.
There has been concern for some time that carers find the prospect of accidents
and sudden illness an extra source of worry when the person they care for may
be left alone.

SINN Fein's Gerry Adams yesterday accused John Major of letting a historic
opportunity for peace slip away in Northern Ireland.
Speaking in Washington, Mr Adams said: ``We're now facing the prospect that
this could be the end of the beginning of this new opportunity.''
But Mr Adams said he had high hopes a visit by President Clinton to Britain and
Ireland, from November 27 to Decemebr 3, would help to put the stalled peace
process back on track.
Britain is insisting the IRA give up some of its arms before Sinn Fein can take
a seat at peace talks. Dublin says any weapons handover should be part of the
talks, not a precondition.
Mr Adams said that the prospects for talks had dimmed since the IRA and
loyalists declared ceasefires 15 months ago.
``At the moment, we don't have a peace process,'' added Mr Adams, ``We need to
re-establish the peace process.''
Meanwhile Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble played down the prospects of an
early breakthrough in the stalemate yesterday.
After a 75-minute meeting with Mr Major at Downing Street he was ``not
optimistic''.
He added the Prime Minister had categorically denied reports in the Irish press
that the British Government had put forward proposals that could see an end to
the current deadlock by the weekend.
``Obviously things are a bit sombre, because it does appear, with the threats
Sinn Fein-IRA are making about the breakdown of the situation, it is not
optimistic,'' he said.

PAULINE Collins was once asked how she felt about growing older. She replied:
``I've always liked the age I am when I get there.'' Which, when you think
about it, is sound advice for anyone mindful of the passage of time. Right now
Collins is more than happy to admit that she has just turned 55. And liking it.
She is sitting in a caravan, parked in a gap site off Glasgow's Woodlands Road.
Autumn rain - and a dozen film-crew vans - have ensured that the ground outside
is a quagmire. A friendly production assistant offers the actress a pair of
gumboots - which she is more than happy to accept. It is refreshing to note
that sartorial elegance takes second place to keeping her feet dry and warm.
Collins, who will forever be identified by a generation of women of a certain
age as their role model, Shirley Valentine, is on a rare visit to Scotland to
play a major role in Flowers of the Forest, a disturbing and powerful drama by
Michael Eaton about ritual child abuse in a fictional Highland village.
Her role is a challenging one, more so because it takes her into unfamiliar
territory. She is, I suppose, a villain of sorts. She plays Aileen Matthews, a
self-styled expert in satanic child abuse who is a member of the New Morning
Trust, a fundamentalist evangelical group. The kind of religious busy-bodies
who go poking their pious noses into other people's business.
With no real evidence to back up her claim, she convinces local social workers
that the village is riddled with devil-inspired child abusers. The result is an
unwarranted witch-hunt which devastates the local community.
``She is a member of this fundamentalist group which runs seminars. I perceive
the character as someone who is true to herself but probably misguided.
``The thing is that, as an actress, I can't consider her misguided; I must
believe in what I am doing. The film, I suppose, is the story of what leads up
to children being taken away from their families and how a large group of
people can be influenced by a small group - in this case social workers being
influenced by this evangelical group which believes in the concept of satanic
abuse. Here the signals which could be taken for another type of abuse are
interpreted as being satanic in nature,'' she explains.
Though she was aware of the recent spate of unfounded child abuse cases, not
only in Scotland, but also in England, she admits that she knew very little
about them. ``But when I read Michael Eaton's script I thought it was
absolutely fascinating. I had seen another thing he did for television, Signs
and Wonders, and I thought it was great.
``Increasingly people are becoming more and more interested in real life
stories and drama seems to be moving in that direction. Personally, I like
things which are reality-based though not necessarily true stories.''
Collins in reality, as opposed to being fully made-up for the screen, possesses
a delicate beauty. She really could pass for someone half her years. But 55 she
is (and still liking it). It is, however, a dangerous age for an actress.
She says: ``It is easier for men, of course, but women in their mid-50s, in
life as in this profession, are invisible. Now, whether you accept that or
fight it, is another question. My inclination is to accept it and do other
things with my life. Until, perhaps, I become fluffy and 60 and white-haired.
``It would be wonderful to have great parts coming my way but I look around and
they're not there.'' Her role in Flowers is a notable exception.
Despite these remarks, Collins is clearly not an actress who is ever (or, for
that matter, has ever been) short of work. Born on Merseyside, she caught the
acting bug at the age of eight in a school play. Her first big break came in
1962 when she broke into television with a part in Emergency Ward Ten where she
met her future husband, John Alderton.
Upstairs, Downstairs followed (so did Alderton) and she went on to some
distinguished work in the theatre.
But mention Pauline Collins and it is Willy Russell's Shirley Valentine which
surely springs to mind. Funny to think that the Hollywood producers first
wanted Cher to take the role. Successful though it was, Collins must be fed up
talking about the part by now.
``No, not at all,'' she remarks, eagerly. ``I loved the character, I loved the
play, and I loved the film. I think that two or three times in your life you
find a playwright with whom you have a creative marriage and that is true with
me and Willy Russell. And it's the same with him and Julie Walters.
After Shirley, Collins had many offers from Hollywood - but most of them were,
well, Valentine cards; clone roles. She was offered some television parts -
which were tempting - but she decided against them because they would have
involved five-year contracts.
She believes that one of her professional strengths is the fact that, in life,
she is a normal person.
``I'm not glamorous, I don't play glamorous parts. I play people who are
reality-based,'' she adds.

DETECTIVES investigating the killing of a building society manageress became
suspicious when medical experts found a flaw in her husband's story of an
ambush by robbers, a court heard yesterday.
Oxford Crown Court heard that Mr Gordon Wardell, 42, could not have remained
gagged for 16 hours, after being knocked out by anaesthetic, without choking on
his tongue.
Mr Wardell told police he returned home from a public house to find his wife
being held hostage by a gang.
Mr Wardell, of Bonneville Close, Meriden, Warwickshire, denies murdering his
wife Carol, 39, at the couple's home on September 11 last year.
The prosecution claims Mr Wardell suffocated his wife before dumping her body
in a local lay-by and going to her building society branch, where he faked a
raid.
Mr Richard Wakerley QC, prosecuting, said detectives identified Mrs Wardell's
body and visited the couple's home, where they found Mr Wardell bound, gagged,
and beaten on the lounge floor.
Mr Wakerley said it was incredible that Mr Wardell had not wet himself during
the 16 hours in which he claimed he had been unconscious.
The court was told that a demonstration would show that Wardell could have tied
and gagged himself.
Referring to the claims he had been unconscious from 10pm on the Sunday until
around 9am next day, Mr Wakerley said it was almost impossible.
He said: ``There is no question that any of the blows he received had knocked
him out. If you eliminate the blows, could it have been an anaesthetic?
``It is impossible to maintain somebody unconscious for more than a few
minutes. Their tongue will go to the back of their throat and they will die if
an airway is not maintained.''
Further forensic evidence showed the defendant's claim that Mrs Wardell was
alive when he last saw her being held by the raiders was little more than a
lie, said counsel.
Mr Wardell claimed they had eaten a supper of ham and tomato salad at 7.30pm on
the Sunday but examination of her stomach contents revealed there was no ham or
tomato.
There were still obvious traces of their Sunday lunch, which Mr Wardell said
they had shared before 2pm.
``The stomach completely empties within three to four hours of taking food.
``She could not have been with the robbers at the building society at 5.22am on
Monday. She was already dead and had been for several hours.''
The jury were told that a gang of raiders would not have chosen the small
Woolwich branch where Mrs Wardell worked. Only #14,000 was taken from the safe
and the alleged raiders ignored the cardcash machine. None of the cash was
recovered.
Mrs Wardell had not used her ``duress code'' when allegedly forced to open the
security shutters. Staff issued with this code can alert headquarters to any
possible danger without setting off the alarm systems.
Mr Wardell knew his wife's security code but was unlikely to have known about
the duress code.
Mr Wakerley said: ``In the privacy of marriage, there may be many, many
motives. Motives which may require planning. That he stood to gain financially
from her death is very plain. On her death, he would receive a handsome lump
sum of thousands of pounds and a pension.
``The prosection do not, and do not need to, set out to provide a motive.''
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>Countryside offensive against animal rights brigade Elizabeth Buie examines the new coalition which aims to counter the campaigns against hunting, animal transport and rambling restrictions</HEADLINE>

THE fight-back has begun. Beset by activists - many of them from the
middle-class suburbs of Middle England - about everything from live animal
transport to fox-hunting, the ``country'' interests have decided to take the
offensive.
It is likely to be a highly professional campaign - public relations by
Lowe-Bell Communications, one of London's top firms, and a #3.5m advertising
campaign devised by another market leader, Bartle Bogle Hegarty.
All this to promote a better understanding of countryside issues? To explain
the rural facts of life to children who apparently believe that eggs come from
pigs, and bacon from chickens? Not likely, say the sceptics.
It seems, according to environmental sources, that a wide-ranging market
research exercise has told the country's landowners, farmers and food producers
exactly what they did not want to hear: that the vast majority of members of
the public care very much about farming practices and animal welfare issues and
are critical of both intensive and factory farming techniques.
The Countryside Movement, launched yesterday with Sir David Steel, former
Liberal leader, as its executive chairman, may well be saying that its aim is
to increase understanding of rural issues, and to help solve problems of
unemployment, poor housing, inadequate transport, and misdirected farming
policies. But a number of conservationists believe that the agenda goes much
further, and they point to the board of directors featuring leading hunt
proponents such as Lord Peel and the Duke of Westminster as evidence.
One of the Countryside Movement's main sponsors and financial backers is the
Countryside Business Group, whose spokesman, Eric Bettelheim, wrote recently in
The Field magazine: ``It took British guts and American money to win the last
war and it will take the courage of country people and the wealth of
landowners, sporting tenants and businessmen to win the current one against our
contemporary enemy, the animal rights brigade.
``Irresponsible, sanctimonious, contemptuous of others and full of hatred for
the essential elements of civilised democratic life, they will not be defeated
by reason or compromise.''
Mr Bettelheim draws comparisons with a country sports campaign mounted in
France in the 1980s backed by 50 million francs (more than #6m) with
accompanying media propaganda.
The CBG plans to spend #3m-#4m a year on its campaign, much of it raised by a
levy on landowners, farmers, sporting tenants and countryside businesses.
What has mystified many environmental commentators is Sir David Steel's
involvement. He has said he does not hunt and does not particularly approve of
it. But he is a keen angler, and at the launch defended the right of minority
sports to exist in the face of opposition.
Some anglers are concerned that if hunting is banned, angling will be the next
blood sport targeted by the anti-blood sports lobby.
Indeed, earlier this year, Sir David wrote in the London Evening Standard:
``The various worthy animal lobbies spent about #750,000 on press advertising
before the debate on hunting, and, perhaps as a result, a great many
sympathetic members of the public got swept along by this new hysteria......
And behind these armies of little old ladies come the platoons of new fascists
fuelled by the moral certainty that they are correct and the law should enforce
their view.''
He went on to describe hunting as a source of enjoyment which added to ``the
general gaiety of the countryside and to some rural employment''.
One of the Countryside Movement's first advertisements features a picture of a
hen and an egg, asking which came first, to focus people's interest on the
subject of where our food comes from. But it is understood that a later
advertisement planned for the organisation's national press campaign has a
swipe at the Ramblers' Association, the main proponent of public access.
If so, then the Ramblers in Scotland will be asking some tough questions of the
Scottish Landowners' Federation, which supports the new Countryside Movement,
about its commitment to the public access concordat that the two sides have
been working on for the past two years.
Simon Fraser, the SLF's director, said yesterday the organisation supported the
concept, but added he hoped it would take account of the differences that
marked out Scottish rural life from English.
``We like people generally to understand the countryside, to understand that
farming does involve managing animals and transporting them, and that if you
want to eat them they have to be killed,'' he said.
However, he added: ``Up here we have spent two years on this concordat and we
are right behind it, absolutely. We do not want it spoilt by noises south of
the Border where there is a different problem. ``We believe that the best way
to progress in the countryside is by consensus and agreement rather than
fighting each other from opposite trenches.''
But there does seem to be a feeling among landowning and farming interests that
they have been victimised by activists.
The Countryside Movement's launch literature states: ``It is depressing, in
Britain of all countries, to see the growth of a profoundly unsympathetic
faction which seems to have no understanding of country people and the things
for which they stand. Their vision is apparently a sanitised countryside,
devoid of life as well as death - a theme park for which the urban dweller
takes no responsibility, financial or otherwise, but through which he expects
to wander freely at the weekend.''

. . . in your ear, Michael. Answer this, if you will. What is it about trees,
forests, and general arboreal matters which makes grown politicians ignore
their basic political instincts? Dear Ian Lang suffered from it badly. How
could he, as a Member of Parliament for a seat which is about as solid as a
quaking bog, sanction the sale of enormous tracts of Forestry Commission land
in his own area for no good reason other than political ideology? Now you will
say that there is nothing wrong with political ideology, particularly your own
sort, but the sensible politician, the politician who likes a seat in
Parliament and who wishes to retain it, leavens ideology with common sense. The
Scottish public, you see, likes to imagine itself to be trampers and hikers in
the wilds. Some of them actually do it, but what they all approve of is the
right of access to wooded paths strewn with fragrant pine needles. Access,
Michael, is what they have not got. As The Herald reported, of 801 forests in
Scotland sold by the Forestry Commission through privatisation only one is
covered by a public-access agreement. Frankly, there are plenty of people
shocked to the soles of their thick wooly socks by the news that 801 forests
have been sold, far less that there is no access to 800 of them. Selling off
forests leads to big five-barred gates, all of them shut; it means problems for
wild animals and birds and it does not lead to more jobs. Now that is not good
politics.
People admire the Forestry Commission. It has green vans, builds paths and
tracks, lets people use them and smiles a lot. At this rate there will be no
Forestry Commission left, no access to woodland, and an awful lot of trouble
for the politicians who promoted such a lousy policy. Now might be the time for
a policy review. It wouldn't do for you to be named after the Forestry
Commission's house magazine. What's it called, now? Ah yes, The Slasher.

IT was 10 cold Christmases ago that oor ain Beat Poets first followed the
advice of an age-old firm of instrumentalists - Diddley, Dale, and Jones - and
began dropping the hammer on Silent Night.
``Dear uncles Bo, Dick and Booker T insisted that playing loud was the best way
to fend off Yuletide chills,'' reminisces head Beat Poet Tom Rafferty. While
their contemporaries have all lost their sparkle, the Beat Poets still gleam
with tinselled brilliance - and this year they're doing their bit for a
year-round good cause by recording their rambunctious version of Silent Night
for the nation's homeless.
Available on CD from a Big Issue vendor near you, Silent Night is intended to
provide fundraising cheer for those to whom Christmas Day is, like every other
day, a bleak one. ``Silent Night grew out of a chance meeting with journalist
Andrew O'Hagan, following the Glasgow launch of his book, The Missing, which
considers Fred West's brutal culling of the lost and the displaced. He put us
in touch with the Big Issue after we'd talked about the resonances of Silent
Night for folk who don't have homes and end up dossing on noisy city streets.''
Naturally, the Beat Poets will be adding their own joyous racket to Scottish
streets in the next few weeks. Tomorrow at 1pm they'll be performing Silent
Night in Glasgow's George Square.
In addition, the band will be appearing al fresco during Shine On, Glasgow's
city-centre festive entertainments season. On December 3, they'll be rocking a
Christmas tree in Buchanan Street. On December 10, Shine On's giant cuckoo
clock at the junction of Sauchiehall Street and Cambridge Street will feature
the Beat Poets as rock'n'roll roosters.
Regular gig-goers will be able to enjoy the Beat Poets, plus the Kaisers, on a
mini-tour which visits Glasgow (Archaos, December 7), Aberdeen (Lemon Tree,
December 8), Edinburgh (Music Box, December 9) and Newcastle (Riverside,
December 10).
For Christmas Tom Rafferty would like a box of jellied fruits; warm dry homes
for all; Silent Night in the top 10; and world peace. Buy the Beat Poets'
Silent Night and you'll help at least one of his dreams come true.
n.Silent Night is also on sale from Monday in branches of FOPP, HMV, Tower,
Virgin, Avalanche, Ripping, 1Up and Impulse in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
Motherwell and Hamilton, priced #3.99.

I WELCOMED Arthur Scargill's courageous and honest attempt to instigate a
debate within the labour movement over the future position of socialists within
a Labour Party that has unashamedly shifted to the centre of British politics.
The level of condemnation from some sections of the Labour Party, however,
reflects just how bereft the party has become of ideological discussion.
Indeed, Labour has shifted so far to the right of politics that its activists
comfortably adopt the rhetoric of the Conservatives (Letters, November 14).
Mr Scargill did not destroy the NUM: lest the passage of 11 years has dimmed
some memories, the 1984 strike was the culmination of a struggle between the
free-market economic policies of the Conservative Government, and the
preservation of jobs and working-class community.
The reason the Labour Party finds it difficult to refrain from the vitriolic
personal denigration of Mr Scargill is because it still cannot face up to its
shameful part in failing to support the NUM in its struggle.
To liken Scargill to Field Marshal Haig and condemn him for seeking to split
Labour is hopelessly inaccurate. There are large numbers of people whose
socialist views are no longer represented by a mainstream British political
party, and there are too many younger people who are unable to identify with
any of the mainstream political parties.
Mr Scargill should be congratulated for recognising the political void that
exists today, and ought to be applauded for addressing these very real
challenges.

<HEADLINE>Karadzic and Mladic charged with further crimes against humanity Bosnian Serb duo indicted a second time</HEADLINE>

THE Yugoslav war crimes tribunal today indicted Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his army commander, General Ratko Mladic, for crimes against
humanity and genocide for the massacre of Muslims in the UN safe area of
Srebrenica last July.
It was the second time the two leaders had been indicted. In July they were
charged with crimes against Bosnia's Muslim and Croat population, including
attacks on the capital, Sarajevo.
The UN tribunal sitting in The Hague said today's indictment related to ``one
of the bloodiest acts of the war in the former Yugoslavia . . . involving
crimes of an unprecedented cruelty against the Bosnian Muslim population''.
Meanwhile, an American reporter says he found evidence of two suspected
massacre sites in Serb-held Bosnia before he was arrested and held prisoner for
10 days.
He followed a trail of witness descriptions and information from US
intelligence sources.
Near a school in the small town of Sahanici, where three survivors said they
were held before being blindfolded and driven to a field to be executed,
journalist David Rohde said he found evidence of two graves large enough to
hold a total of at least 1000 men.
``I found two areas of fresh digging on either side of a railroad track,'' he
said. Rohde's report on his findings appears in today's editions of The
Christian Science Monitor.
The 28-year-old journalist was captured at gunpoint on October 29. He was
released November 8 and returned to Boston, Massachusetts, two days later.
In a pile of more than 100 garments near the largest grave, Rohde said he found
three canes and a crutch, personal photographs and Muslim identification cards
- one from the United Nations-declared ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica, which fell
to Bosnian Serb forces in July.
Rohde said he believes the crutch and canes belonged to a group of elderly men
who asked for sanctuary at an enclave of Dutch UN peacekeepers near Srebrenica.
But the Dutch soldiers also were forced to flee, and except for a handful of
survivors who spoke with Rohde, the old men were rounded up and executed, he
said.
The International Red Cross has reported that of 40,000 Muslims who fled
Srebrenica, some 8500 men are still unaccounted for.
Nine men who survived by playing dead told Rohde that thousands of Muslim
prisoners were executed on July 14, 15, and 16 at several different sites.
Bosnian Serbs have said no civilians were massacred; rather, the graves contain
the bodies of Muslim soldiers who were killed during the fighting.-AP

NOSTALGIA isn't what it was. Learning from history is preferable to
regurgitating it, surely. What am I on about? Oasis's much-hyped Christmas
cracker, Wonderwall, the single: it's twisting me melons, man. Oasis, as you'll
know, have been hailed as leading contenders in the ongoing revival of Britpop
plc. Their main rivals, Blur? Too calculated, some might say. Soft southerners:
their problem is they think too much. But oh, them bluff northern Oasis lads.
They must be better because they're evidently more natural, untutored,
instinctive. Oasis? Natural? Instinctive? So's athlete's foot.
But why am I increasingly irked by Oasis? Because it's easy to picture Noel
Gallagher listening to his old Beatles albums, and simply opting to invest the
Fab Four with a bit of post-industrial Mancunian sarky. Getting down to the
nittimost of the grittimost, Wonderwall is a duff George Harrison album.
At least when Blur nick a sixties song title - The Universal was initiated by
the Small Faces - they come up with a gutsy song that's better than the
original.
The fact is that there's tons of stuff better than the Beatles. Fittingly, I am
pondering such matters as I sit inside a small cupboard in an unprepossessing
industrial unit on a tatty west London business park next to a greasy canal.
For this small windowless room is the heart of the Ace reissue empire. In here
Ace musicologists assemble timeless collections of yon Afro-American primal
rock'n'roll gumbo; undying compilations of vintage funk, jazz, and soul.
It was about 20 years ago today, to coin a phrase, that the Ace organisation
began charting the fertile old breeding grounds of rock'n'roll. But it all
began much, much earlier, as Ace co-founder Roger Armstrong reveals.
Armstrong's Belfast childhood was shaped by Buddy Holly and a clued-up elder
brother. ``Thanks to him, when the Beatles appeared, I'd heard the original,
more immediate versions of some of the songs they covered.''
As a teenager, Armstrong made two vital discoveries. ``You could buy three
deleted singles for the price of one new one, and some labels could mean
something, could guarantee quality. Stuff on the red Atlantic label was bound
to be good, whereas in addition to the Beatles, Parlophone meant Ken Dodd,
too.''
Armstrong's philosophy studies at Queen's University, Belfast, led to him and
his student chums in the Esoteric Music Society staging gigs which regularly
drew between 700 and 1500 entertainment-starved people.
Armstrong's first big-name gig featured Arthur ``Big Boy'' Crudup, touring
mainland Britain to 30-strong audiences. That's Alright Now Mama was Arthur's
song. Yon Elvis boy had his first hit with it ..... what would have happened to
him if he'd confined himself to listening to Bing Crosby?
Having left uni, Armstrong went to London and became involved in managing Irish
bands. He secured one bunch a #20,000 recording deal. When he went to tell them
the good news, they looked pained, explaining they'd just broken up. ``I asked
them to reform, if only for one album. For #20,000. They wouldn't. Bloody
musicians. They'd broken up; I was flat broke.''
But if you can't trust bands, you can depend on records.
Ted Carroll was another Irish exile in London. Having managed Thin Lizzy, he'd
retreated to a three-day-a-week record stall at a Soho street-market. Selling
records was fine; making them was more exciting, however. The Chiswick label
was born.
``Our sole capital was the old vinyl we had. Another single at the time had a
line: `It's easy. It's cheap. Go and do it.' We did.''
Chiswick grew to encompass two market stalls selling vintage vinyl and US
cut-outs by cults like the Stooges and the MC5, plus one shop housing the
label's office in a back room. Chiswick's talent-spotting reputation grew
faster. Hopefuls besieged Ted and Roger with tapes - and one such tape altered
the course of Scottish rock history.
BACK in 1977 wee Jim Kerr posted a track, Saints And Sinners, by his band,
Johnny and the Self Abusers. Chiswick liked it. It reminded them of the Sweet.
``But then we lost the tape. They sent us another. By the time we were ready to
release it, the band had changed their name. They wrote asking if it was too
late to reprint everything with the new name. It wasn't, but we told them it
was. Why? Because we'd done wonderful pre-sales figures on the strength of
Johnny and the Self Abusers ..... Simple Minds didn't have the same ring.''
Despite good sales for big Chiswick hits the label was failing financially.
Gradually, as Chiswick withered, the Ace reissue label thrived. It now
encompasses everything from fifties jazz to seventies retro-funk by way of
post-punk quiffabilly and sixties northern soul. Little Richard; Bobby Bland;
Eddie Cochran; boxed sets of Stax singles. The Everly Brothers; Creedence
Clearwater Revival; Isaac Hayes; Link Wray; John Lee Hooker; Ofra Haza.
``We carry 1500 album-titles, much more than any big label. For that reason and
many others, I don't see us as part of the record industry at all. We're
repertoire driven. We make sure our stuff sounds good by working direct from
the original master-tapes, not reprocessed-from-mono rubbish.
``But we're basically a nickel-and-dime organisation with no marketing muscle.
And the mainstream business is principally marketing-driven.''
But what of the big reissue question: if tracks weren't good enough to come out
at the time they were recorded, surely they can't be good enough now.
``On take one of The Wanderer, a piece of history which has sold 50 million
copies, you hear Dion say: `I can't handle these lyrics.' He manages it on
second take, after which he says: `OK, next ..... Kansas City.' Bang. How can
it be bad to have greater insights into the way records were made?''
Are you listening to the Ace credo, Mr Gallagher?

MULTI-MILLION pound Euro-payments which subsidise Spanish bullfighting are to
end following an investigation by the Commission.
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler has told Euro-MPs he has found a way
of cutting out payments for farmers fattening up cattle for the ring without
threatening grants to other types of bull-breeders.
For years, Brussels claimed it was difficult to prevent bull-breeding subsidies
- paid at age 10 months and again at 22 months - from going to breeders rearing
animals for the bullring. However, Mr Fischler's solution is simple - subsidies
will be paid only at slaughter in future.
About 900 Spanish ranchers who produce 30,000 bulls to be killed at fights were
pocketing subsidies designed to help prop up impoverished beef farmers.

THE bill for tackling long-term disrepair in Scotland's crumbling schools
amounts to nearly #500m, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday in a devastating
attack on the Government's spending priorities.
The leader of the party in Scotland, Mr Jim Wallace, said the cost of tackling
the backlog of repairs had risen by 10% since local authorities last returned
figures, 18 months ago, for the funds they needed to bring schools up to
standard.
He said: ``It is an outrage that, time after time, the Government has refused
to give the green light for essential repairs or for new buildings.
``In Central region, for instance, the council estimates it would require about
#9.2m a year over the next 10 years to bring building stock up to a
satisfactory condition.''
The result was teachers and pupils enduring decaying classrooms, he said. Apart
from the nursery vouchers scheme - which Liberal Democrats were sceptical about
- the Scottish education measures outlined in the Queen's speech merely
tinkered with administrative matters.
``Overall, just #70m has been given to all of Scotland's school buildings. The
Government appears to be continuing to squeeze public life to pay for the
inevitable pre-election tax cuts,'' Mr Wallace said.
Several local authorities gave estimates of the funding needed to tackle major
school building repairs and maintenance. They included: Strathclyde (#142m);
Grampian (#72m); Lothian (#69m); Fife (#36m); and Highland (#34m).
Strathclyde region's deputy director of education responsible for school
buildings, Mr David Dunbar, said: ``In some cases, the position is quite
serious and there is no doubt that teachers and young people are working in
conditions that are far from ideal.''
The new unitary authorities, which will operate under severe financing
constraints, will be under increased pressure to make more efficient use of
their resources.
Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson, said: ``Regional councils have
substantial resources at their disposal, and it is for them to decide on their
spending priorities.''

THE Glasgow Cycling Campaign congratulates Edinburgh City Council on its
commitment to spend #300,000 on cycling facilities in its first year and notes,
with concern, the deafening silence enamating from George Square on the subject
of cycling and sustainable transport in Glasgow.
Glasgow City Council's recent decisions to press ahead with the M74 northern
extension and allow the construction of a new 2000-space multi-storey
city-centre car-park as part of the Buchanan Galleries are not part of a
sustainable transport policy.
Glasgow's miles better? Not if you are a cyclist.

BEING on the receiving end of a full-scale campaign launched by Dame Barbara
Cartland must be, one gains the impression, an exhausting business. It is with
an air of bemusement at a force stronger than nature that Robert Smith,
marketing director of a health supplements company favoured by Dame Barbara,
tells the story of how she persuaded his firm to create a new skin-care product
which Scottish women are now clamouring to buy.
Ayesha's Flame, Dame Barbara claimed in a recent interview with The Herald,
smoothes wrinkles, crows' feet, blemishes and even scars. Soon after taking the
vitamin and mineral mix pills for the first time, she told interviewer Phil
Penfold: ``I looked in a mirror and everything had gone. Positively everything.
Even my appendix scar.''
At a stroke, she created a new market for the product in Scotland, a feat she
replicated nationwide on Sunday when she told South Bank Show presenter Melvyn
Bragg about the benefits of Flame.
Since then, the company's three phone lines have been jammed solid with orders;
Dame Barbara can spot a marketing opportunity, even on someone else's behalf,
when she sees one.
``The product actually started with Dame Barbara herself,'' says Smith,
marketing director of Cheshire firm Cedar Health.
``We have another product, basically a calcium supplement called Porosis D
intended to help prevent osteoporosis in later life, and Dame Barbara had been
taking this for some time at the suggestion of her naturopath. After some time
he commented that her nails and hair and skin were looking better, and the only
thing he could put it down to was the supplement.''
Most other supplements, he says, use inexpensive calcium carbonate, whereas
Porosis D uses calcium citrate, the most easily absorbed form.
``Dame Barbara contacted us and said, look, you're selling this product wrong.
Women aren't interested in their bones, women can't see their bones; what
they're interested in is their skin, their hair and how they look, and you
should be selling this product as a beauty product.
``We said no, we really don't want to change three years of marketing on this
one. But she wouldn't go away. She was so insistent, she really believed in the
product.''
There is a pause, as he reflects on the number of calls this belief engendered.
Cedar Health, of course, gave in; further development with the Danish
biochemist who created the original product, the addition of vitamins with
antioxidant properties (the subject of current medical debate; some claim high
antioxidant doses are beneficial in heart disease and some cancers) and
Ayesha's Flame was born in tablet and face cream form. (Ayesha is the name of
an Egyptian goddess who remained eternally young by entering a blue flame of
youth to preserve her beauty.)
The product contains calcium citrate (for soft, supple skin) vitamin A (for
healthy skin cell tissue), magnesium (activates the vitamins and keeps the skin
toned), vitamin C (helps create collagen, the connective tissue); vitamin D
(stimulates the body's calcium use) and vitamin E (strengthens the blood
vessels).
But before you get too excited: ``I can't see any reason why any of these
should have the effects (that Dame Barbara claimed),'' said Dr Wilfred
Turnbull, senior lecturer in human nutrition at Queen Margaret's College
dietetics department in Edinburgh.
``Judging by the composition, basically it is more like a multi-vitamin and
mineral preparation.
``There could be a benefit in taking mineral supplements if you are deficient,
but deficiencies are very, very rare in the UK.''
None the less, sales of Flame have done well over the past three years, Smith
says, although they are now about to go through the roof.
``It was all really down to Dame Barbara, her insistence, and persistence. She
certainly is quite singleminded.'' The company, whose major interest has
previously been in licensed natural medicines, is extremely gratified by the
public interest. ``We have been quite overwhelmed.'' Indeed.
n.A month's course of 120 tablets costs #7.98, as does a 50g jar of cream.
Available from Cedar Health (Pepper Road, Bramhall Moor Lane, Hazel Grove,
Cheshire SK7 5BW, 0161-483 1235, postage free for orders over #10), or from
health food shops, including Forrest &amp; Niven, Glasgow.

MICHAEL Forsyth's decision to introduce a Bill implementing new controls on the
licensing of dance events has received support from all sections of the
clubbing and dance community. However, many believe it does not go far enough
and that testing of drugs for purity should also be introduced.
The Bill will be based on guidelines, due to be published next month, which are
being drawn up by the Scottish Drugs Forum (SDF) following recommendations made
by the Scottish Drugs Task Force report of 1994. In this, concerns were
expressed about the increasing incidence of recreational drug use in Scotland
and the number of drug-related fatalities in Scottish nightclubs.
``It is widely believed and acknowledged that the environment in which drugs
like ecstasy are taken can have a tremendous bearing on the effects of the
drug,'' according to Lee Fawcett who is preparing the guidelines for SDF.
Unlike the tragic case of Leah Bett, who appears to have died after an allergic
reaction to ecstasy, most fatalities have occurred through chronic over-heating.
``The major cause of death associated with ecstasy poisoning is a syndrome
likened to heatstroke, if not from heatstroke itself,'' says Fawcett. ``The
body becomes so dehydrated - through the effects of the drug, through incessant
dancing, through the hot environment and through lack of fluid intake - that it
is no longer able to cool itself down.''
Although Forsyth's statement on Wednesday specifically mentioned ``raves'',
Fawcett points out that the guidelines should apply equally to all kinds of
dance events held on licensed premises.
``The problem with using the word `rave' is that it has become a word which
promoters have become used to dodging,'' she says.
Fawcett claims that unscrupulous club owners turn off water supplies and charge
extortionate prices for water from the bar. They overfill clubs and also give
inappropriate treatment to people who are experiencing an adverse reaction to
drugs.
``These are the things that the guidelines are aiming to address,'' she
says,``plus providing information which will inform people of the risks of
taking drugs, and for those who insist on using drugs, despite the risks, ways
of reducing those risks. Harm associated with drug use can be reduced
significantly by safer clubs and more responsible drug use.''
This emphasis on harm reduction and education diverges widely from the
increasingly rejected ``just say no'' campaigns of the past.
It tacitly accepts that drug use is here to stay. ``We are looking at a youth
culture which has embraced the recreational use of drugs more than any previous
generation,'' says Fawcett. ``I don't think there is any way that anyone can
stop people taking drugs.''
This admission is borne out both by the existence of a Scottish Office funded
project, Enhance, and the attitudes of its volunteers. The Glasgow-based
project uses young people who take ecstasy on a recreational basis to educate
others about the risks.
``The guidelines take the onus off the drug user and put it back on the
clubs,'' according to Justine, who is an Enhance volunteer. ``They are making
money out of our drug use and it is about time they started putting something
back. It has always been seen as the drug user's fault for taking it in the
first place, which should not be the case.''
Caroline, another volunteer, believes the guidelines should be taken one step
further and provide a testing service for ecstasy users. ``People should not be
so elitist and moralistic about drug use,'' she says. ``They must realise that
we can stop a lot of deaths by testing what people are using so they are not
getting dog-worming tablets or whatever. All the worst drugs are imported into
Britain because dealers know that we don't test.''
The volunteers do not believe that the guidelines promote drug use. ``It is
more a case of pro-drug user than pro-drug,'' says Nellie Smith.
Clubs where incessant dancing and drug use take place are rarely run by the
people who own the venues. Young club runners, desperate to promote their
favourite DJs and style of music, are at the mercy of the owners.
Alan Gray, who helps promote clubs in Paisley and Glasgow, welcomes the support
which the Bill will give him in ensuring that his patrons have a safe night
out. ``To make people pay for water is wrong,'' he says. ``We won't let the
Government privatise water so why should we allow venues to do the same and
make a vast profit?''
Fawcett points out that many clubs are already operating in accordance with the
guidelines. In Edinburgh, the regular Rezerection events attract up to 5000
young people to dance all night. The promoters have a close relationship with
the Edinburgh District Council who ensure that health and safety issues are
kept to the fore.
Councillor Dickie Alexander, chair of the licensing board, says it is good to
be able to exercise a form of protection. ``Not to control young people,
because I don't believe in that, but to give them some boundaries that they can
operate within.''

<HEADLINE>Dundee's political parties unite over #18m crisis</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975339569</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN ALL-PARTY appeal was made yesterday for the Government to bail Dundee out of
an #18m cash shortage which could force school closures, job losses and a 50%
increase in council tax.
The situation is so serious that a leading right-wing Tory is supporting the
Labour council's plea for more money.
Mr Neil Powrie, leader of the Tory group on Dundee District Council and
chairman of the Scottish Conservative local government advisory committee,
joined Labour and the SNP in criticising the Government's funding plans for the
new unitary authority.
He is alarmed at the scale of cuts needed to balance the books and the huge
rise in council tax required.
Last night, Councillor Powrie explained his decision for joining an all-party
delegation to lobby Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth: ``Dundee is in a unique
position. The city has a very low tax base and for years services have been
funded by council tax payers in Angus and Perth.
``Only 38,000 out of Dundee's 115,000 voters pay any council tax and, with the
loss of tax revenue from the surrounding areas, a shortfall is inevitable.''
He added: ``The Government needs to review local government funding on a
Scottish-wide basis. Some new councils have been given too much money, while
Dundee has a shortfall.''
The leader of the Labour administration, Councillor Kate Maclean, said: ``The
Scottish Office grant aid is based on a formula which was designed for the old
councils, not the new unitary authorities.
``The fact is that the Scottish Office capping limit of #177 for providing
services in the new Dundee City Council is likely to be considerably less than
is currently being spent on essential services in the city by the existing
regional and district councils.
``So, through no fault of its own, Dundee is looking at a huge budget deficit
and the likelihood of large council tax increases next year.''
Ms Maclean added: ``All the political groups on Dundee City Council, council
employees, the trade unions and the people of Dundee now need to work together
to fight for the city and send a powerful message to the Scottish Secretary.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ``Next year's settlements have not yet been
finalised but Ministers are aware of the problem. The Secretary of State has
asked Cosla for their recommendations on how to solve the problem.''

AS USUAL, Ford has been teasing out the launch programme for the new Fiesta.
The autumn season has seen the first details being published, then the car's
appearance at motor shows, and finally the chance to buy it from a showroom.
As the best-selling small car in Britain, the Fiesta has gone through several
model generations since it was introduced in 1977. More than two million
examples have been sold in this country alone. Even in its final year, the
run-out version has held its place as number two in the overall national sales
charts, behind the Escort.
Ford is sometimes criticised for making headline changes to cars which are
essentially the same as their immediate predecessors.
Although the basic structure remains the same, as anybody prowling around the
cars on show at the SECC will have seen, that is certainly not the case with
the latest Fiesta. It has all-new exterior panels, a more attractive interior,
new suspension, and a range of brand-new engines in addition to revised
versions of the familiar units.
Ford has been tinkering around, not always successfully, with the front-end
treatment of its various model ranges. The Fiesta has a much stronger identity
here than some other cars with the blue oval badge, even if traditionalists
will probably take some time to accept it.
There is no doubt, however, that the new fascia is one of the most stylish in
the small-car class, although some of the practical stowage space in the older
model, which continues for the time being as the Fiesta Classic, has gone. In
both materials and design, the once familiar Ford bias towards being
utilitarian has disappeared.
Heart of the car, of course, is the engine, and here Ford offers some brand-new
designs plus some modified versions of the existing types. The latest 16-valve
twin-cam Zetec-SE engine, designed by Ford with input from Yamaha, is a
lightweight all-alloy affair to be seen first in the 1.2-litre size which peaks
at just under 75bhp. Next year, a 1.4-litre 90bhp type will be added.
Two of the present engines survive, though in modified form. The familiar 60bhp
1.3-litre, and the similarly powered 1.8-litre diesel are now tagged the
Endura-E and the Endura-D.
At launch, there are four trim and equipment levels from Encore through LX and
Si to Ghia. Each comes as a three-door or five-door, and you can have any
engine you like with any trim level or body style.
Despite the various body changes, the whole new Fiesta programme is really
engineering-led. The new Zetec-E engines are livelier and smoother, the whole
power-train is quieter and better balanced, and there are features in the
specification which Ford has never offered on its small cars before.
For example, an option on all new Fiestas (except the Encore) is a combination
of anti-lock brakes, traction control and electronic brake force distribution,
which nips into action before the ABS comes into play.
The difference most people will notice, comparing the new Fiesta with the old,
is how much quieter the latest version is. Richard Parry-Jones's team, which
was so heavily involved with noise path analysis on the latest Escort, played
the same part in the development of the Fiesta.
Together with an enhanced ride quality, the suppression of noise is one of the
features which shows that Ford has really taken its new-generation small car
seriously.

<HEADLINE>Winter at Ford Unreasonable union behaviour</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975339571</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORD workers who have rejected a very acceptable wage settlement and watched
their colleagues at two factories go on unofficial strike are behaving like a
dairy herd released into the field after a long winter. They sniff the spring
air, kick their heels, and generally do daft things. The problem with the
actions of the Ford unions is that industrial spring is not here, indeed may be
delayed for the foreseeable future. In single-handedly attempting to recreate
the feel-good factor in a corner of British industry Ford workers may believe
that they are in the vanguard of a resurrection of traditional union values and
practices. There is nothing wrong with the traditions and aspirations which
have motivated the union movement in this country for many years. At their best
they lifted workers from conditions in which they have been used and abused for
scant recompense and they may have to perform this service again.
Other sorts of trade union practice, the sort that resulted in bullying and
unreasonable behaviour, have had quite the opposite effect on an honourable
tradition. Unfortunately it is the car workers, who have not historically been
the most downtrodden workers in British industry, who are among those best
remembered for unreasonable behaviour. Certainly, there is a good deal of
cheering at the news of the rejection of a 9.25% increase in wages over two
years, but most of it comes from back bench Tory MPs who sense a golden
opportunity to attack the Labour movement and New Labour.
Just as with traditional union values, there is nothing wrong with a fair wage
rise. British workers have watched a high tide of money flow into the
boardrooms of too many companies to feel that a decent reticence has much place
in modern industry. Nevertheless there has to be a sense of the context in
which these events take place at present, particularly the growth of the Labour
Party into a position from which it can win the next General Election. This
should be the concern of unionists but those in Ford have either not grasped
the point or do not care. New Labour will have to handle its reaction to this
event with caution, but it is not alone. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will
have been pleased by the fall in inflation figures but at a time when evidence
is mounting of a distinct hiccup in the economic recovery he will not want to
see inflationary wage rises. Perhaps Mr Clarke and Mr Blair could work in
sensible concert. The Chancellor could have a word with Ford management and Mr
Blair could speak to the unions; that would herald spring indeed.

KENNY WAUGH, the former chairman of Hibs Football Club, yesterday admitted
defrauding the Inland Revenue of #80,000 in his bookmaking business, by giving
tax-free bonuses to employees.
Waugh, 58, pleaded guilty that at his Edinburgh premises between August 1987
and August 1992, he pretended that receipts of wages paid to his employees were
accurate, when he knew they showed lower wages than were actually paid,
resulting in him paying lower income tax and national insurance contributions,
and so defrauding the Inland Revenue of a total of #80,000.
Miss Vicky Roger, depute fiscal, said at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, that Waugh,
of Glenlockhart Bank, Edinburgh, had instituted and continued a system of an
untaxed supplement or bonus given to employees in addition to their normal
wages, but no deductions were made from it.
The matter came to light after Inland Revenue inspectors suspected that the
scheme was in operation and made inquiries.
Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, for the defence, said Waugh became a bookie in 1963 and
had built up a successful business. During the time of the offence, he had
between 11 and 17 betting shops and employed a large number of people.
He got into the way of giving his employees a bonus. If a betting shop had a
good week, the manager could take a bonus and give a bonus to other staff.
It was not a regular thing when it started but became more regular and began to
feel like an entitlement.
In 1988, Waugh became seriously ill and was off work for 18 months. During that
time, his managers continued to pay the bonus, and this went on until 1992.
Mr Jackson said: ``The irony of the situation is that he got nothing out of it
- not one penny piece of advantage has come to him.''
Mr Jackson produced a letter to show Waugh had repaid the #80,000 to the Inland
Revenue.
Waugh had retired because he had a serious heart problem and his son ran the
business. Part of the price for ``this sorry mess'' had been the worsening of
his medical condition.
There had been a two-year delay in the case until November last year, and Waugh
had suffered from massive stress.
Sheriff Iain Macphail, QC, said he had a duty to consider a jail sentence in a
case such as Waugh's.
He deferred sentence until December 7 and called for social inquiry and
community service reports.

Nairobi, Thursday
KENYA has rejected a claim by British hotelier John Ward for reimbursement of
the costs of his private investigation into the murder of his daughter.
Attorney-General Amos Wako filed papers with the High Court in Nairobi, saying
``Kenya was not to blame'' for the death of Julie Ward ``and does not accept
any liability''.
The partially dismembered body of Miss Ward, 28, was found in the Masai Mara
game reserve in September, 1988.
Her father launched his own investigation after the state initially termed her
death a suicide. It later conceded she was murdered, but no-one has ever been
convicted of the crime.
Mr Ward filed a lawsuit seeking compensation from the Kenyan Government for
#300,000 he has spent on his own seven-year investigation.-AP

A COMMUNITY policeman woke up his neighbours and challenged them to a fight in
the early hours of the morning, a court heard yesterday.
Constable Stephen Boag, 37, shouted and swore outside the house of his startled
neighbours and demanded: ``Get outside and I'll give you a square go, you
bastards!''
Yesterday, Boag pleaded guilty to a breach of the peace charge.
The court has heard that Boag, with 15 years' service, had already been
suspended from duty at the time of the offence.
Boag, of Baluniefield Road, Dundee, admitted that, on August 12 this year, he
conducted himself in a disorderly manner, shouted and swore, and committed a
breach of the peace.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard that there had been ``bad feeling'' between Boag and
his neighbours, the McHardy family, for days before the incident.
At 2.15am on August 12, Mr and Mrs McHardy were woken by someone opening their
gate and when they looked out they saw Boag standing on the pavement and
shouting.
He came back five minutes later and started shouting at them again and
continued to do so even after police were called to the scene.
Depute-fiscal Vivien Kennedy told the court that Boag was a community liaison
officer who is currently suspended from duty because of an investigation into
another matter.
Solicitor-advocate Peter Watson, defending, said there had not been a ``one-way
traffic of abuse'' and added that Boag had served for 15 years in the police
without a ``blemish on his character''. However, Mr Watson admitted that Boag
had a ``problem'' which had now been acknowledged and that he was to receive
counselling from occupational health officials with Tayside Police.
A plea of not guilty to another breach of the peace charge was accepted by the
depute-fiscal.
Sheriff Anella Cowan deferred sentence for three months for Boag to be of good
behaviour. The sheriff called for an updated psychiatric report and a report
from Tayside Police's occupational health department.
Last night, Inspector Jim O'Donnell of Tayside Police complaints and discipline
branch, said: ``Disciplinary proceedings will be considered when the matter has
been finalised by the court.''

Maurice was simply suspended till his hair grew in, or his black biker's jacket
was replaced, allowing re-entry to his school in East Kilbride. Until then the
polished walkways, glinting glass of the big city shopping citadels were, for
both, a cool enough hangout.
In America such kids are christened Mall Rats, now celebrated by Hollywood in a
new movie starring Shannon Docherty of Beverly Hills 90210 fame. Yet Scotland's
shopping malls are the home of a smaller, milder breed, the mall mice.
While their American counterparts deal drugs, indulge in gang fights and
vandalism under the temperature-controlled roofs of the malls, young Scots say
these buildings are a safe sanctuary from such anti-social behaviour.
Even 14-year-old Carlos admitted playing look-out for friends on a shoplifting
spree. ``Nobody misses it and we haven't been caught.'' Yet across the ocean it
was the St Enoch's calmness which Maurice admired.
It is a new idea to those who believe the words ``young'' and ``hoodlum'' are
inseparable. But it is backed by research from Sheffield University which has
revealed that only 5% of 11 to 14-year-olds said they would allow their own
kids into a town centre alone. More than 40% said they would only take their
children to malls. Young people felt threatened by the town centre ``yobbos''.
Almost the exact same words were used by Maurice and his mates as they hung
around across from Bargain Books in the centre's ground floor. ``It's safe here
compared with home. You don't get hassled by yobbos. It's really nice and
clean. In the High Street in East Kilbride it's rough. Guys beat you up, but
not here, 'cause they would just get lifted,'' said Sean Clark, 19.
Fear of city-centre crime, beggars, drunks, and vagrants were also cited this
week by researchers at Leicester University as the reasons why shoppers are
deserting high streets for shopping malls. Statistics showed that six times as
much crime was suffered by city centre shoppers as their counterparts in malls.
In their report, ``Crime and Security: Managing the Risk to Safe Shopping'',
the authors wrote: ``The bobby on the beat may still patrol town centres but he
or she has been superseded by the private security guard in the shopping mall .
. . both offer the presence of officers in uniforms which the public finds
reassuring.''
They suggest it will take more than the decision by John Gummer, the
environment minister, to place a moratorium on building out-of-town malls to
regenerate a safe shopping environment in many British cities. However, all of
Scotland's cities have major malls in the city centre as well as in outlying
towns.
A number of reasons have led to a drop in juvenile delinquency at the St Enoch
Centre. The ice rink, which was a magnet for high jinks, has shut down. ``Why
was it shut down?'' said deputy centre manager David MacGregor. ``Have you ever
tried to keep an ice rink in a greenhouse? It cost a fortune.'' The centre's
security have also been working with local police and the education department
who regularly sweep through for truants.
It is ironic that their presence is most appreciated by those the public would
expect to occupy them most. But everyone likes security, and the covered floors
of Glasgow's St Enoch Centre and Edinburgh's Waverly Centre, for example, are
an oasis of calm safety. The French anthropologist Marc Auge views shopping
malls as ``non-places'' rooted not in soil but publicity, marketing, and
recycled images.
It is true. In a mall you could be anywhere from Tokyo to Toledo.
Miami's Aventura mall has the same bright lighting, potted plants, and rock
fountains as those the length of Britain. It's big - more than 200 shops,
restaurants, and services - but not as big as The Mall of America in
Minneapolis. Spread out across 78 acres it is the biggest in the world: for
once, no idle American boast. It was here two years ago that school lessons
were first introduced to a series of US malls.
A trial scheme involved teaching children how to be retailers and included work
experience. Mall life across the Atlantic has reached the stage where you can
marry in the ``chapel of love'' and a few years later receive counselling if
your husband gets heavy-handed. Mall culture has never exploded in Britain in a
similar manner; even less so in Scotland.
Yet it is the variety for which MacGregor at St Enoch's enjoys his job. The
centre is like an iceberg, with two-thirds its bulk remaining hidden. As we
stroll the miles of red concrete corridors which run under the ground, off from
the giant loading bay, the size of the centre but below it, he explains that
occasionally the public wander.
``We've found people in back corridors, near the boilers even, claiming to have
been looking for the toilets, but they're casing the joint looking to see if
they can find a store room to swipe from.'' In the data room a panel of five TV
screens films the entire centre, offering the facility to zoom in hundreds of
yards. ``It also works for the bad guys.''
He said last year the centre was contacted by a lawyer defending a man charged
with stealing cars in a city-centre car park. Police officers said he was
arrested at 3pm, yet the man insisted he was arrested at 3pm shoplifting in the
centre. He was proved correct by the tapes. The police case collapsed.
On the subject of wandering teenagers MacGregor is adament that if they are
well behaved they are most welcome. ``I keep telling the security men, these
are tomorrow's shoppers, if you don't treat them properly they won't come back.
``But if they're on bikes, blades, or skateboards, they're out!''
As Christmas approaches, sprinkling fairy lights and late-night shopping along
with it, malls across the country will heat up and begin to hum the tune of
jingling cash registers.
Their sales, however, will not be swollen by any contributions from Maurice or
Sean as they stay between 11am and 4pm ``looking at stuff'' they cannot afford
to buy. Eight thousand miles away Carlos will remain on his stakeout.
``Mall rats never sleep,'' he said.

GO Directly to Jail, Do Not Pass Go! The familiar commands from one of the
world's favourite board games will be issued tonight at London's Park Lane
Hotel where a #250-a-head black-tie party is being thrown by Waddingtons to
celebrate Monopoly's 60th birthday. To help you go to jail, assuming you try to
steal it, a specially created $2m Monopoly set, consisting of a 24-carat gold
board, will be on show. It is a glittering concoction which has a ruby or a
sapphire set on top of the chimney of each of the 18-carat gold houses and
hotels used as counters, and a dice studded with 42 diamonds.
A total of 168 stones have been implanted in this made-for-Midas objet d'art,
ranging from diamonds to sapphires, rubies to citrines, amethysts to garnets,
and blue topaz to catseye tourmalines and peridots, while to sustain the
capitalist theme the Monopoly money has been specially printed on metallic
gold-coloured paper. Steal that little lot and you could, if caught, very well
end up in jail, from which no amount of double sixes would get you out. Not
that it will be easy to purloin. The board weighs 32lbs, and Sidney Mobell, the
San Francisco jeweller who designed it, will spend the evening handcuffed to it.
Over 480 million people are estimated to have played the real-estate,
beggar-thy-neighbour game since it was created in 1934 in Philadelphia during
the Depression by an unemployed heating engineer called Charles Darrow.
Within months the board game, made from bits and pieces found in his kitchen,
was the rage of the city. Darrow sold some sets through a local department
store, but realising he needed to do things in a big way, or not at all, took
it to Parker Brothers, the world's largest games manufacturers. They did not
spot its potential. Too long to play, too complicated, and far too circular in
conception, they complained. What was more, there was no goal on the board for
the players to reach.
Darrow, therefore, decided to go ahead on his own and the game proved to be all
the rage that Christmas in Philadelphia. The following year the Parker Brothers
bought the rights and by mid-February were producing 20,000 games a week.
Monopoly is now licensed in 45 countries and printed in 25 languages, including
Catalan, Hindi, Arabic, Afrikaans, and Croatian. Darrow was able to retire a
millionaire at the age of 46 and spent the rest of his life travelling the
world and collecting exotic orchids while others carried on selling the licence
to make money he had invented.
At tonight's party the usual suspects from the celebrity A list, or possibly,
given some of the names, the B list - who on earth are Sian Lloyd, David
Jensen, Carol Smillie, and Jeremy Beadle? - will be on board, so to speak, to
play the game for the Children with Leukemia charity. Hugh Grant, Joan Collins,
Jerry Hall, Mick Jagger, and Paula Yates have also been invited, as have six
people who are 60 today.
The 150 celebrities and the 250 paying guests, the ones expected to spend the
money when the set is auctioned because celebrities only put their hands in
other people's pockets, are unlikely to break the record for the longest ever
game. That lasted for 1416 hours (59 days of continuous play), or perhaps it
was 1680 hours (70 straight days' play). Waddingtons, who acquired the British
rights in 1935, are somewhat confused as to which is right and have given both
sets of figures, but either way it went on a bit.
On acquiring the rights they decided to change the names of the properties on
the board, originally places in Atlantic City, to ones British people would be
more familiar with, hence the London place names.
It is said that the head of Waddingtons, Victor Watson, asked his secretary,
Marjory Phillips, to make the selection and on the day she made her choice she
happened to lunch at the Angel pub in Islington, the only pub on the board. The
rest of the names are of streets like Oxford Street or Piccadilly, London
railway stations like Waterloo, districts like Mayfair and, this being a
speculators' game, streets which house police stations, like Vine Street,
Marlborough Street, and Bow Street.
The reigning European Monopoly champion is the teddy-bear collector and games
freak Gyles Brandreth, Tory MP for Chester. He is in good company. Other famous
players include the Queen, Frank Bruno, and Sir Edward Heath.
Monopoly has stood up well to the competition from computer games - Waddingtons
sell some 500,000 sets in the United Kingdom each year - possibly because
Monopoly has not stood still. There is Magnetic Monopoly, Junior Monopoly,
European Monopoly, and on a computer near you, Internet Monopoly. They even
play it in Russia with place names like Red Square and the Kremlin on the board.
Go Directly to the Lubyanka. Forget Glasnost. Pay 1,000,000 roubles.

q Saturday: Border Ecosse Car Club's Early Winter Rally has an evening start
from Coldstream, and finishes back there after a 90-mile route. As well as
being a round of the East of Scotland rally championship, it has attracted
entries from members of Tyneside Motor Sport Group clubs in north-east England.
q Monday: Also in the Borders, but on a grander scale, the Network Q RAC Rally
brings the final round of the World Rally Championship to Scotland at Wauchope
and Kershope forests.
Wauchope is the more convenient spectator area for people approaching from the
north. It is off the B6357 south of Bonchester Bridge, where the spectator
signposting starts. Scheduled time of the first rally car at Wauchope is 12.54,
but do not expect the full entry to come through, because the long, gruelling
miles in Kielder Forest, just across the border, will undoubtedly have taken
their toll.
The spectator car parks, on roads within the forest, are a short walk from the
stage itself. Parking charge is #5 per car, and on no account try to abandon
your car on the B6357 verges instead. Lothian and Borders Police will make sure
the public road is kept clear for rally and everyday local traffic.

ONCE the source of little more than tacky crystal ornaments and dubious acrylic
clothing, home shopping is being revolutionised by the computer age; TV
shopping, stores and services on the Internet, and now the launch of a 3-D
virtual reality computer shopping experience.
Edinburgh University's announcement this week that it is embarking on a
European project to bring an interactive shopping system to your PC screen, is
just the latest in a long line of retail initiatives pulling customers off the
streets and into their own homes. It's estimated that by the year 2000, 10% of
all retailing and 20% of all grocery shopping will take place via the Internet.
Retail analysts say new-age shopping will make big changes to the way we make
our purchases, but is unlikely to kill off the malls and high streets.
Shopping, they say, is an interactive experience and there will always be those
who prefer dealing with humans to dealing with pixels.
``It is right to say that it is never going to replace shopping,'' says Dr Paul
Freathy of Stirling University's Institute of Retail Studies. ``Some people
will always enjoy shopping, meeting people, walking around, interacting. But
there will always be a certain element who won't have time, even people who
enjoy shopping but find that home shopping suits them better.''
Dr Freathy says if the experience of America was anything to go by, then the
Internet offered vast amounts of room for expansion of shopping initiatives.
``If you look at America, there is a host of different products and services.
The other day I was flicking through and I came across a florist's in Florida
which had different types of flowers displayed, you pay with credit card and
have them despatched there and then. We've got a little bit of a way to go
before we get to that level but it's catching on here,'' he says.
Meanwhile, some retail analysts say that changing demographics and populations
are leading to a much older society which suggests that in 10 to 15 years' time
there will be much more locally based shopping - leading possibly to a revival
in high-street fortunes.
Professor Mervyn Jack is involved in Edinburgh University's latest initiative -
a collaboration between a number of British and European companies. The project
is for a virtual reality on-screen shopping experience with a 3-D assistant who
will talk customers through sizes and colours. The scheme, which will take
three years to develop, is, according to Professor Jack, designed more ``for
the lay person rather than the Nintendo generation''.
He says computers offered an attractive and efficient proposal for stores
because they could operate without the heavy overheads of shops and outlets.
However, he adds that Internet shopping would most likely operate ultimately as
an addition to existing means of shopping. ``It will never supersede shopping
but it will be a valid alternative channel.''

THE Highlands may be in the frontline for hospitality but an armed and
camouflaged soldier who arrived in the middle of the night at a remote cottage
just went over the top.
The soldier dropped in - literally from 18,000ft - to Ian and Liz Bishop's
cottage at Slochd, by the A9, near Aviemore, and rang the bell to ask if he
could use their telephone after stormy weather blew him off course during a
night-time parachute jump. He also asked if he could borrow a map.
At first the couple refused to open the door to the armed and menacing figure
dressed in full camouflage gear.
Mr Bishop said: ``We have a rottweiler which was going mad because of the noise
the soldier had been making. We are always particularly careful about answering
the door because we live in such an isolated location.
``I thought he was a complete nutter to start with. I noticed his Army issue
SA80 lightweight rapid-fire rifle with night sights, which made me very worried.
``I thought he had gone AWOL or something and was very scared. But after
speaking to him for a while, I came to the conclusion that he was probably in
the SAS because he would not tell me which regiment he was in, which is usually
a clear sign.''
Mr Bishop eventually relented and opened the door to the lost soldier who even
refused to confirm that he was in the British Army despite his somewhat unusual
appearance and specialised rifle.
The soldier told him he needed to telephone in his grid reference to Army HQ
and let them know he was safe. He also said he was several hours late for a
rendezvous six miles away, at the Eil bothy on Strathspey Estate, near Dulnain
Bridge, and everyone would be worried about him.
Mr Bishop heard the soldier telling Army HQ what had happened to him. He added:
``I then gave him directions on how to get back to the Eil bothy using the
river Dulnain as a guide. He seemed very intelligent and I never saw him again
so I take it he made it alright.''
After the incident, Mr Bishop telephoned his only neighbours, Mr John Redwood
and his wife Judy, three miles away on Seafield Estate. They told him that
another Army parachutist had landed in their garden but had disappeared into
the night without asking for directions.
The incidents happened on Tuesday night in the area which is well known as an
SAS training ground because of its rough terrain and extreme weather.
An Army spokesman did not appear to know what manoeuvres there were in the
area. He said: ``I know the Marines were in Orkney but there's no way they
could have been blown that far off course on a parachute jump.''

AMERICAN mediators will make one last great effort to wind up the Bosnian peace
conference this week.
An American source said that there was no prospect of continuing next week. He
may be forced to swallow his words, of course, but it does appear that the
talks have reached a crisis.
The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, spent Tuesday at the talks in
Dayton, Ohio, then flew on to the Asia-Pacific summit in Japan. He will return
before the end of the week, abandoning APEC, to make a last effort at resolving
the Bosnian conundrum.
His departure will not help US-Japanese relations, which have been difficult
all year. President Clinton decided late on Wednesday to skip the conference
altogether because of the budget crisis in Washington. Vice-President Al Gore
will represent the United States.
The most difficult issues in Bosnia remain the territorial division of the
country between the Serbs and the Muslim-Croat federation; Sarajevo; and the
war criminals.
The Serbs demand restoration of land they lost in the early autumn offensive by
Croats and Muslims. They want the town of Sanski Most returned to them.
The Muslims are even more obdurately set on recovering Srebrenica and Zepa, two
towns in eastern Bosnia that the Serbs overran last summer. The Americans
concede that they have an absolute moral claim on the places, because the Serbs
massacred between 6000 and 10,000 people when they captured Srebrenica.
But they also suggest that if justice pulls one way, peace pulls another. It
makes little sense for the Muslims to return to isolated and indefensible
islets surrounded by a hostile sea of Serbs. They have trouble enough
justifying holding on to Goradze, their last stronghold in eastern Bosnia.
The two sides are equally obdurate over Sarajevo, which the Government wants to
be a united, multi-ethnic city while the Serbs want it divided.
As for the war crimes, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia would be
quite ready to turn over Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and any other
Bosnian Serbs the War Crimes Tribunal may want (though they have other ideas).
But some senior officers and political figures in his own armed forces and
Government have been indicted.
So have officers in the Croatian Army. The American and European mediators are
finding it very difficult to finesse the issue.

THANKS to a two-hour standstill on the Edinburgh/Glasgow line, this review must
confine itself to the closing portion of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic's
concert under Libor Pesek last night - but it was enough to show how well these
players respond to their conductor and to what feels like the century or two of
good Czech musical tradition he has imposed on them.
With such brightness of string tone, such sweetly blended woodwind and radiant,
unraucous brass, Dvorak's Sixth Symphony could not have been in happier hands.
Pesek paces the music of his compatriots with complete understanding, making
the music move easily, comfortably, but with the extra edge of gusto the finale
of this most glowing of Dvorak symphonies requires if it is to cap what has
gone before. The closing burst of speed, the bounce of the rhythms, seemed
perfectly judged.
To the fizz of Smetana's Bartered Bride overture, which followed as encore,
Pesek brought the same natural flow, achieving excitement not by overpressing
the tempo but by the spruce articulation, the nicely turned phrasing, the witty
pointing that can come when the music has space to breathe. The warmth of
violin tone, in a hall that does not always bring out that feature, was notable.
Karajan, it used to be said, brought power-steering to his conducting of the
Berlin Philharmonic. Pesek gave us simple lyricism. I would like to have heard
the whole concert. Last night's large audience will surely welcome him back -
if another exchange between the RLPO and the Royal SNO can be arranged - and so
will I.

<HEADLINE>Protesters call for fresh inquiry into #200m electricity plans Pipeline `link' to beached bombs</HEADLINE>

THE controversy surrounding the appearance of wartime munitions on Scottish
beaches has led to a demand for a third public inquiry into plans for an
electricity interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Protesters against the proposed #200m electricity link made the demand
yesterday following a report which claims that Government scientists have
established ``beyond reasonable doubt'' that the laying of a gas pipeline
across the North Channel of the Irish Sea led to thousands of phosphorous bombs
being washed ashore on Scottish beaches.
Mr Struan Stevenson, the co-ordinator of the Stop the Overhead Powerlines
(Stop) campaign, which protested against the proposal by ScottishPower and
Northern Ireland Electricity to build more than 40 miles of pylons across South
Ayrshire, and take the electricity from Ballanatrae to Islandmagee by undersea
cable, stressed yesterday that the undersea section of the interconnector was
an area which was not examined at two public inquiries held in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
``Both inquiries insisted that the undersea section between Currarie Point and
Portmuck South fell outwith their legal jurisdiction.''
Mr Stevenson said that, despite the dislodging of more than 4500 phosphorous
bombs by its undersea trenching activities for the gas pipeline, there was no
doubt that the British Gas subsidiary Premier Transco had conducted ``extensive
undersea surveys prior to commencing work''.
He added: ``By comparison ScottishPower and NIE have conducted limited and
seriously flawed undersea investigations in this area and should now be forced
to defend their proposal before a full public inquiry. I will be contacting
Michael Forsyth as a matter of urgency to seek an early inquiry.''
The months of evidence heard in Ayr and Larne are still being considered by the
Scottish Office Reporter in Edinburgh and his counterpart in Belfast and
preliminary reports are expected to be available early in the New Year.
On Monday the Government launched a two-week survey, of the half-mile deep dyke
in the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland, in a bid to allay
public fears and establish why the phosphorous bombs have been washed up in the
past month.
A report in the New Scientist magazine yesterday claimed that the scientists,
from the Scottish Office's marine laboratory in Aberdeen, had concluded - just
four days into the survey - that it was ``beyond reasonable doubt'' that the
bombs were dislodged by British Gas ploughing operations in preparing the route
for its inter-connector pipeline.
The article further claimed: ``Underwater video footage taken by British Gas's
contractors and studied by the scientists also clearly shows the bombs, and a
host of other metallic wastes, next to the pipeline.''
The Scottish Office yesterday issued a statement from Scottish Environment
Minister Lord Lindsay dismissing the article as unhelpful speculation.
He said: ``The position regarding the phosphorous canisters which have been
washed ashore on the west coast remains the same as I said it was on Monday
when the `Clupea' set sail from Ardrossan to begin its survey.
``There is circumstantial evidence that the recent pipelaying operations may
have caused some disturbance to the seabed. But there is no merit in
speculation of any kind. We need facts.''
British Gas yesterday declined to talk in detail about the magazine article but
said it would ``consider the implications accordingly'', if given the
opportunity to review the reported findings.
However, Scottish MPs yesterday said the reported findings pointed the finger
of blame firmly at British Gas' pipelaying operations.
Mr George Foulkes, the Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, has
called for a halting of all commercial operations until further safety checks
are carried out.
He said: ``Unless you have visual evidence I suppose you can't prove it totally
conclusively but the phrase `beyond reasonable doubt' is one the scientists
chose carefully to illustrate what they understand to be the position and when
I say to people that Government Ministers keep denying it they just laugh and
ask where else the devices have come from.''

THE laying on of Dr Finlay's healing hands held out hope of a swift recovery
for the ailing Dawson International. The Edinburgh-based textiles group had
fallen victim to the bad medicine of befuddled expansion.
The haemorrhage led to losses of nearly #100m. The company doctor, Mr Derek
Finlay, brought in earlier this year, prescribed a purge of the boardroom and
the loss of 500 jobs.
Yesterday, however, those early hopes of a fast recovery were shaken by the
announcement from the new management, who took over in March, that half-year
profits were down 43%.
The new chairman blamed poor sales on the warmest summer since 1659 and shaky
consumer confidence. Figures for the six months to September show pre-tax
profits have slumped to #9m with sales down to #169m.
While not exactly shaking his head over the patient's chances of a good
recovery, the company doctor is warning that profits for the second half of the
financial year are likely to be even worse. He holds out little hope of a
sustained recovery until the next financial year.
The patient, meanwhile, is being packed off for recuperative purposes to its
old home in Kinross. The decision by Dawson to flit from its prestigious
headquarters in the heart of Edinburgh's financial centre back to its Todd and
Duncan plant across the Firth of Forth is perhaps symbolic of its retrenchment
since Mr Finlay, 63, a former Heinz executive, took over as chairman following
the disastrous results announced earlier this year.
The company is now returning to its core business, the most important of which
is Pringle, the prestige knitwear business endorsed by golfer Nick Faldo. It is
Dawson's key brand.
Things began to go dramatically wrong at Pringle in the final six months of
last year. Sales were plummeting and the company was losing money on its
retailing side and in the US.
The company had diversified internationally into shops, and tried to use the
cachet of the brand name to expand into products such as jewellery and perfume.
Finlay believed that the rapid expansion was a bridge too far and that the
management had lost touch with its core business and become befuddled by the
huge range of products.
Drastic action and no little controversy followed the boardroom coup which was
incited by leading shareholders who had lost confidence in the management.
Almost immediately after taking over the chairmanship Finlay was forced to
defend compensation payments of #2.2m made to ousted directors.
He insisted the company had no choice but to pay off the managers whose
contracts were terminated after the heavy losses in the year to March 1994.
While 500 employees lost their jobs, on minimum redundancy terms, it was
revealed in the annual report that the chief executive of Dawson's US
shower-curtain business, Philip Kemp, was to get a payout of #1.36m. The US
business had lost #20m in the two years before it was finally sold in May this
year.
The ousted chairman, Sir Ronald Millar, ended his 13-year reign by collecting
#378,000. He also got a full year's salary of #188,000 plus pension
contributions of #32,000.
The group's managing director, Nick Kuenssberg, received #308,000 in
compensation and a year's salary worth #150,000. It was he who had presided
over the ill-judged expansion into retail shops.
A final sum of #117,000 went to the finance director, John Embrey, who also got
to draw his #62,000 basic salary until his formal retirement in July.
Further criticism followed when it was disclosed that Dawson had let its former
executives hang on to their share options, which normally lapse when an
employee leaves the company. Sir Ronald and Mr Kuenssberg had over 400,000
share options between them.
Critics saw the payoffs as a rich reward for failure. But Mr Finlay insisted
that by acting quickly and avoiding lengthy and expensive court proceedings the
new board was free to concentrate on the fundamental and strategic issues
needed to help the company recover.
Dawson's key problems had centred on its American adventure where several of
its acquisitions performed poorly. Then the sales increases expected from
opening a number of high-profile Pringle shops never happened.
The new board decided on a back-to-basics policy. The US shower-curtain
business was sold in April for $42m. Ten manufacturing plants in the US closed,
six of them sold. The UK weaving business, Premier Fabrics, went the same way.
Now the company is refocusing on the Pringle brand of golf wear.
There are still problems. The company faces higher wool and cashmere prices and
it is struggling to pass the rises on to the price of an already expensive
sweater. The raw material costs for wool, cotton, and cashmere from China rose
by as much as 40%, although there are hopes that prices might begin to fall.
The retrenchment means that Dawson now is little different from the group of
top quality Scottish knitwear and woollen companies it was in 1982. Dawson
began moving into the US in 1984, buying J.E.Morgan, an established maker of
thermal underwear. It added other businesses, moving into fleece, shower
curtains, and T-shirts.
Until 1990, profits from the US operation rose while those of the UK knitwear
and woollens businesses fell, hit by fashion changes and difficulties in
getting supplies of high-value cashmere from China.
Then changes in the US retail scene followed, which the Dawson subsidiaries
were not big enough to cope with.
The company is now busy dismantling Pringle's retail arm. By last month the
four UK stores had been vacated, five out of nine in Germany are now franchises
and a further two were closed down. The company has kept its in-shop presence
in prestigious stores such as Harrods and The Scotch House.
The new regime wants to focus on the golf and sports and leisurewear. It wants
to reposition Pringle, too, in the American market where golf is big business.
Whenever Faldo crosses a green in his Pringle sweater, there will be an
identical woolly on sale in the club shop.
Can the good doctor, then, put Dawson International back on its feet? The
analysts think so, pointing out that the balance sheet is sound and believing
that the medicine already administered will eventually do its job. There is
nothing though that Mr Finlay can do about the weather. Unless he calls in a
rain doctor.

IN the annual report of the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland
published yesterday, I say that the one-shop, one-customer division of
Railtrack and ScotRail is not the best way to serve rail passengers.
Let's be clear what's being talked about here: it is not about whether
privatisation is good or bad for the rail industry, that's a separate issue
about ownership; what the report deals with is how you organise yourself to
deliver the service to your customers. I'm saying creating an artificial split
between the people who provide the tracks and signals and the people who run
the trains is not the best way to deliver the service.
Think about what the railways are trying to do - to deliver not only a
satisfactory but improving standard of service to customers.
How would any modern Scottish business go about this? I would suggest its
management would work closely together in one location, building on the
strengths of each member of the team to evolve and implement a flexible plan
with clear, agreed objectives which could be changed quickly in response to
market conditions.
What they would not do is to set up two separate teams in different locations
communicating with each other through a series of complex, contractual
relationships and where the objective of one of the teams is to make a profit
out of the services it supplies to the other. In this sort of relationship the
customer is lost sight of.
Part of the reason for reorganising British Rail was to introduce
competition into the provision of rail services because competition would lead
to better service to passengers. But Railtrack has no competition in supplying
services to ScotRail. It is a monopoly and in the same way, except for the
parts of the network used by the InterCity companies, ScotRail is the only user
of Railtrack's services - another monopoly.
CLEARLY, where you have separate businesses doing what one did before, that
there are tangible increases in costs, eg, more people, premises, communication
costs, which is bad news for the taxpayer because these increased costs are met
through an increase in subsidy to run the railways. For the customers as users,
rather than taxpayers, it's the intangibles that affect the service they get,
the slowing down of decisions due to the separation of organisations, indeed
the lack of decisions due to differing objectives, the arguments over whose
responsibility it is when things go wrong - this is not good for customer
service.
It is difficult to put the situation in financial terms but look at it this
way: Railtrack is to be a business that makes a profit from mainly one
customer, ScotRail. Say ScotRail pays Railtrack #200m a year for use of track,
signalling, stations etc, Railtrack has to make a profit to satisfy its
shareholders - how much, #5m, #10m, #15m? That profit will come in part, if not
in whole, from ScotRail.
Isn't it better to have a situation where the money stays in the business where
ScotRail and Railtrack are reunited again and the best decision is taken for
the business as a whole, ie, the rail business, not the track and signalling
business or the train operating business?
Railways are a complex system made up of a whole series of sub-systems working
in synchronisation like a clock - if you want a clock to keep time you don't
take it apart and hope all the parts work on their own; you put them together,
wind it up, and away it goes. It's the same with railways: put the parts
together, wind them up by the application of some necessary finance, and away
they go.
Against Government and British Railways Board policy based on separation of
infrastructure and trains, I am up against it, but I draw comfort from the fact
that I am not alone. One of the stars in the Scottish railway firmament in
recent years - Chris Green - also firmly believed that ScotRail and Railtrack
should be reunited.
n Lawrence Kemp is past acting chairman of the Rail Users' Consultative
Committee for Scotland.

<HEADLINE>Privatisation goes ahead despite forecasts of worrying consequences of Scottish break-up Rail users' warning will be ignored</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By IAIN WILSON Chief Reporter</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>

<TEXT>
THE Government's relentless drive towards rail privatisation in Scotland will
continue, regardless of yesterday's blunt warning from the main passenger
watchdog body that the break-up is not working and is damaging.
Senior Scottish Office officials signalled there will be no change of heart,
because splitting the network between ScotRail and Railtrack was ``central'' to
the privatisation programme.
However, the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland said the split was
diverting money, time, and effort away from improving services.
It wants ScotRail and Railtrack re-united. Since the break-up, passengers have
not been well served, while a distinct lack of investment in infrastructure -
from trains to lines and signalling - was of concern.
Mr Lawrence Kemp, past chairman of the committee, declared it was time to
``stop playing shops'' when Railtrack only had one major customer, ScotRail.
His annual report, lodged with Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, makes
embarrassing reading for the Government. It was also seized by opponents of the
privatisation programme.
Mr Kemp wrote: ``Basically, what we have in Scotland is one shop - Railtrack,
with one customer - ScotRail, and the possibility of a few crumbs from the
InterCity companies - not a sensible arrangement.
``Having two separate organisations to do what one did before, and did well,
diverts money, time, and effort away from delivering an improved service to
passengers into providing people, offices, and equipment to do the same job
less well because each organisation has different objectives.''
He insisted that was not a condemnation of privatisation but a criticism of
railway organisation, although he was adamant that:
q There was still no evidence of a coherent, long-term plan to invest in and
develop Scotland's railways;
q It was ``deplorable'' that, for the past 12 months, no new rolling stock had
been provided for Scottish services;
q Railtrack's significant infrastructure problems had resulted in a
deterioration in services, and:
q Rising consumer complaints about staff were due partly to lack of investment.
Mr Kemp, backed by new chairwoman Helen Millar, said the BR break-up might be
appropriate in England but Scotland would be better served if ScotRail and
Railtrack were one.
Mr Kemp said the Government should recognise BR was no longer a national
network, and should set up a Scottish Transport Authority to develop and
implement an innovative transport policy for Scotland.
Labour's Shadow Transport Minister Brian Wilson said of the latest critical
litany: ``If this is the view of a committee that includes several political
supporters of the Government, then what is the rest of the country expected to
think?
``Fragmentation of the railways leads to nothing but confusion, bureaucracy,
and additional cost.''
Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy said the report was a damning commentary on
the shambles of rail privatisation. It had homed in on the key failing: ``The
original, fateful decision to split ownership and control of track and train
operators.''
SNP transport spokesman Andrew Welsh said the Government should heed warnings
in the report and challenged Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch to
reverse the privatisation process, bearing in mind his commitment to an
adequate transport structure to fully exploit business opportunities.
In its report, the committee, whose prime purpose is to protect rail users,
questioned why no new rolling stock had been provided in the past year - in
contrast with Government support for Caledonian MacBrayne, which had received
new ships and was not being privatised.
One explanation was the reorganisation of local government, causing uncertainty
over funding to lease trains, according to Mr Kemp.
However, even when doubts were resolved, builders were not in a position to
proceed with orders: ``It is unforgivable that, when money is available . . .
bureaucracy has conspired against providing a better quality of service to the
rail passenger in Scotland.''
Mr Kemp also warned the phrase ``disproportionately uneconomic'' - used to
justify the withdrawal of Fort William sleepers - may be heard more frequently
in future as an excuse to cut services.
His report argued it was not too late to consider a vertically integrated
railway in Scotland, the ``only way to provide a service''.
Mrs Millar, who said the current system was not working, confirmed some
arguments had already been put in person to the Scottish Secretary. He can also
expected to be pressed soon on the withdrawal of a CalMac ferry which gives the
Skye Bridge a monopoly on travel to the island.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the decision to split infrastructure from
train services was carefully considered when the Government drew up its plans,
adding that Ministers would be interested to see detailed proposals for a
Scottish Transport Authority.
ScotRail said the call to re-unite with Railtrack was for politicians to sort
out. Railtrack also declined to comment on the issue.
q Railtrack confirmed last night that Scotland no longer has rail-borne,
emergency-response cranes. The nearest is on Teeside. Railtrack insisted that
road cranes, hired in Scotland, would suffice, following a survey of needs.

NORTH Lanarkshire Council yesterday found itself with more problems when the
successful candidate for a top education post changed her mind.
Miss Rosemary McDonald, rector of a Catholic high school in Wishaw, has turned
her back on the job of head of the quality department in the council's
department of education.
The council is already reeling from a Scottish Office decision to hold a
``jobs-for-the-boys'' inquiry following complaints about top-level appointments.
The council expected Miss McDonald to hand in her resignation to Strathclyde
region late last week but she has decided to stay on as rector of St Aidan's.
Last night, North Lanarkshire chief executive Andrew Cowe said: ``We offered
her the post, which is at depute director level. We expected to hear that she
had handed in her resignation to the region late last week. But this was not
so. It has come as a bit of a surprise to me.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde region welcomed Miss McDonald's decision to remain
at St Aidan's, where she has been rector for 11 years. She was one of the first
women in the region to take charge of a mixed high school and, under her
guidance, St Aidan's got top marks from the region's quality assurance unit
recently.

RECENT correspondence about Loch Lomond requests that a response is made by the
waterskiing fraternity (October 31).
Might we express at the outset our sincere condolences to the family of the
person killed as a result of the recent accident at Loch Lomond?
We do not know the facts of this case and therefore consider it inappropriate
for us or anyone else at this stage to comment on this, particularly pending,
no doubt, a Fatal Accident Inquiry.
Without facts it is inappropriate also to judge whether any of the proposed
by-laws would have prevented the accident and thus it is unfair to level
criticism at the Scottish Sports Council.
Our association has from the outset supported the bulk of the regulations, as
have the Sports Council on behalf of the various sports involved. We feel that
the Sports Council would reject the contention that waterskiers in general have
wielded an excessive influence on the actions of the council.
We continue to hold ourselves ready to discuss all issues relative to Loch
Lomond with the park authority, the Sports Council, or other interested parties.
We sincerely hope that the regulations, when brought in, will be fair to all
the users of the loch and those who reside there.

Chairman, Scottish Water Ski Association,

<RECORDNO>975339591</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SHINTY referee claims he has been victimised by the Camanachd Association and
is no longer selected to preside over matches as a result of criminal assault
proceedings he took against a player.
Grade one official Donald MacFadyen was struck in the face by Lovat centre
Roddy Munro with a caman during a game last February. Munro was fined #350 by
Inverness Sheriff Court for his actions.
``I'm out in the cold. I haven't refereed a game since this incident
happened,'' said Mr MacFadyen.
``The Camanachd Association won't admit it but I've been suspended. There is no
other word for it.''
Mr MacFadyen received a grazed lip when Munro attacked after being sent off for
foul language during a Lovat versus Fort William match. When the procurator
fiscal became involved, Mr MacFadyen pulled out of officiating at a MacAulay
Cup quarter final match on his lawyer's recommendation.
``The upshot is, I haven't been asked to referee a game since.
``The trial added to the ill-feeling and there is definitely a vendetta. But I
feel I had no option but to go to court. It was the only avenue left to clear
my name.''
Mr MacFadyen described allegations of malice laid against him in court as ``a
lot of dirt''.
``I would like an apology from the Camanachd Association in light of the court
decision and I want to be reinstated as a referee.''
Camanachd Association president Duncan Cameron said Mr MacFadyen's exclusion
was justified because he had declined to referee the MacAulay Cup quarter-final.
Mr Cameron said: ``We do not feel it is right for referees to think they can
pick and choose.
``Referees pull out of games for family reasons and such like but Donald
MacFadyen withdrew because he didn't like our disciplinary decision over
Roderick Munro. He felt the nine-match ban was too lenient.''
Mr Cameron also noted that Mr MacFadyen had later refereed a match in the
Sutherland Cup involving the Fort William side.
``If legal considerations were to the fore, he should have had no complaints
about getting withdrawn from that one.''
Mr MacFadyen's future selection is now a matter for the Camanachd Association,
he said.

<HEADLINE>Benedict Brogan reports how the pay dispute at Ford's Dagenham plant could have major repercussions throughout the country, striking a serious blow against the Government's low-inflation policies Spanner in the works</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>Benedict Brogan</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>17</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975339592</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES, employers, and politicians around the country must be asking
themselves what the good people manning the assembly lines at Ford's Dagenham
plant are up to. Despite a dramatic fall in inflation, workers producing the
new Fiesta walked out yesterday in protest at a final pay offer that would give
them, over two years, a 9.25% increase in wages.
Ford management described the offer as the best in the industry and a
recognition that Ford UK's productivity was substantially higher than its
German branch, but union leaders refused to be impressed by the largesse, and
are holding out for a two-hour cut in the working week, on top of a settlement
worth an average #28 extra a week. On paper, the offer is generous: it would
give Ford workers a 4.75% increase this year, followed by a 4.5% increase next
year - or inflation plus 0.5%, whichever is greater, as well as enhanced
pension entitlements.
Despite Ford's insistence that the offer was final, union negotiators rejected
it and will recommend a strike ballot if necessary. Yesterday several hundred
workers on the paint and trim section of the Dagenham line downed tools to
underline the point. It cost them a day's pay, and Ford lost the production of
800 cars. But for the rest of the automotive and manufacturing industry, which
traditionally follows Ford's lead in these matters, the price could be much
higher.
Reaction to the news at Westminster was mixed. For politicians the conjunction
of industrial militancy and continuing low inflation raises a number of
possibilities. With Ford's 22,000 workers due to ballot on the offer, and other
manufacturers - in particular Vauxhall, whose workers are expected to reject a
3.5% offer - watching closely, a return to the days when high inflation was
driven on by unrestrained demands is bad for both Labour and the Government.
For the Chancellor and his colleagues at the Treasury the Ford dispute is a
worry. The management's willingness to offer a settlement well ahead of
inflationary trends will be unwelcome. Despite 16 years of Tory insistence that
pay negotiations were a matter best left to employer and employee, the
Government will look askance at anything that suggests management willingness
to ignore the downward pressure on wages extracted at such an economic price by
two recessions.
The Government is desperate to cut interest rates both to revive economic
growth and to gain what little political benefit would accrue from such a move.
To do that it needs proof of continuing low inflation to counter the pressure
for higher rates coming from the Bank of England. Yesterday's unexpectedly low
figures have provided such an opportunity, and the Chancellor is expected to
act before Christmas to move rates down.
But Kenneth Clarke's relief at seeing yesterday's inflation figures
emphatically reverse months of rising prices - headline inflation fell 0.5% to
3.2%, and the vital underlying rate dropped back below the crucial 3% level to
2.9% - will be tempered by the breakdown of talks at Ford.
Higher-than-inflation wage demands, in the face of stagnating productivity and
steeply rising UK unit labour costs, is not what low-inflation Britain needs.
On Wednesday the Prime Minister welcomed the new legislative year by
proclaiming that the Tories' commitment to low inflation had created the most
stable platform for growth for generations. The Government believes that inward
investment, like the 3300-job Chunghwa plant at Mossend, only comes when
foreign companies feel confident about Britain's long-term future as a
low-inflation country with a flexible workforce. Strike action to reject a
9.25% pay offer, Ministers fear, is not something that goes down well on the
international markets.
For Labour, the Ford stand-off is equally worrying. Tony Blair has repositioned
his party to the economic centre-right. Inflation is out and unreasonable pay
expectations with it. And he has moved to distance the party from its
traditional links with the trade unions. The image of a Labour government
conspiring to fix wages with union bosses over beer and sandwiches in Downing
Street was one of the most damaging identified by Labour reformers struggling
to transform the party.
So to hear the Transport and General Workers' Union official leading the
negotiations warning that 9.25% did not meet the aspirations of the workforce
must have come as an unwelcome reminder that despite Blair's best efforts, a
number of distinctly unmodern forces lie beneath the surface of New Labour. The
Tories have made ``Labour is not fit to govern'' a campaign theme, and will
lose no opportunity to remind voters that Labour in office will face demands
from trade unions for a much looser approach to inflation.
Yesterday Labour sources were resolutely avoiding commenting on the Ford talks,
echoing the Government line that the issue is one for the unions and
management. Their reluctance to express a view on the merits of the trade union
case is a natural product of New Labour's attempts to redefine itself as an
observer of, rather than a participant in, industrial relations.
The only ones yesterday who were cheering the prospects of large-scale
industrial action and ``inflation-breaking'' pay settlements were Tory back
benchers. Desperate for any stick with which to beat Labour, they were rubbing
their hands with glee at the thought of Labour's discomfiture.
With less than a fortnight before the Budget, Kenneth Clarke does not want
anything to disturb the low-inflation platform on which he is expected to base
the tax cuts that he hopes will save the next election for the Tories. Wage and
workforce flexibility are now too ingrained in the British economy for
industrial strife to reappear suddenly. But politically the crisis at Ford
could be a turning point.

<TEXT>
GOLF, more so in Scotland than anywhere else on the globe, has always been a
game of the people, the most egalitarian of sports. But the pilgrims who would
worship at the shrine of golf's birthplace, St Andrews, and touch the holy
grail of its turf, are in danger of poisoning the chalice for the locals. They
believe a #5m deal with a company specialising in corporate hospitality may
threaten their livelihood, and their birthright as residents to play the
world's most famous course. Honourable men defend the action as the only way to
protect the hallowed links from rampant commercialism, and competition from
planned new courses in the area.
The Old Course is just the latest icon to be plundered by commercialism.
Perhaps we should be reconciled. Golfers have been softened up for this day.
Only addicts who can afford satellite TV can now watch many events, notably the
Ryder Cup and Scottish Open. Rugby supporters levered into purchasing
debentures in order to continue watching their national team, then forced to
watch, impotent, as professionalism, fuelled by satellite TV money,
crash-tackles its way through the ethos that has protected their game, will nod
in knowing sympathy.
Fat cats who can afford #250 per summer round are the only patrons now of
Turnberry. Residence at the Ayrshire hotel is now a prerequisite of teeing off,
as it also is at Gleneagles, which next summer will cost #195 per round. These
are not prices tailored to the pocket of the ordinary man. Yet it is not so
long ago that fathers would take sons to play such courses, or groups of young
men would enjoy a day's golf as an occasional treat which would not require a
second mortgage. No more. At least St Andrews has attempted to maintain green
fees at more modest levels. But the pressure which the new deal exerts on
tee-off times means most of next summer is already fully booked, with
repercussions, it is argued, potentially damaging to tourism there as well as
elsewhere in Scotland. Golf may live to lament hoisting their game on the hook
of commercialism.

<HEADLINE>BRIAN WILSON A voice is stilled as Murdoch wields the axe</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>20</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975339594</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWENTY-three years ago, in the first issue of the West Highland Free Press, I
wrote an editorial which contained the following sentiment: ``I do not believe
that newspapers are just another business and I do not accept the right of rich
and powerful men to buy up, close down, merge and centralise as if they were
dealing with unit trusts or soap powder.''
Last night, I had reason to reflect again upon these words when news came
through of Rupert Murdoch's decision to close the newspaper Today, which
currently has a circulation of more than 600,000. A soap-powder factory, and
the jobs which went with it, could not have been more peremptorily wiped out.
As widely recognised by its peers, Today was a very good newspaper since
Murdoch took the strategic decision that it should adopt a Labour-supporting
editorial line. The former Daily Mirror editor, Roger Stott, brought in some
first-class people who still remembered what campaigning journalism is about.
Naturally, I'm disappointed to lose one of the very few Labour-supporting
papers, in a national press which - no matter how disillusioned it may be with
the current shower - remains overwhelmingly Tory in its ownership and
instincts. Though its circulation was relatively small, Today reached an
important young market.
But I can say with absolute honesty that it is not for reasons of narrow party
advantage that I deeply resent its passing. I doubt if the General Election's
outcome will hang on the fate of Today.
It is as a journalist who recognises a good product when I see one and who
cares for the diversity of our press that I despise how the dagger was wielded,
on the basis of a hard-nosed calculation that in a period of rising newsprint
costs, it makes more sense to maximise the Sun's print run than to continue
with Today.
This was a paper which understood the maxim that news is what someone doesn't
want you to print while all the rest is publicity. It uncovered good stories
and campaigned hard on them. While it did most of the things which modern
tabloids do, it also sustained a coherent editorial line on the side of social
justice.
I appreciate that most of the people reading this obituary will have had little
acquaintance with its subject. Despite having an excellent little team at
Kinning Park, its Scottish edition never broke the 40,000 mark and carried
virtually no distinctively Scottish advertising. But it still unearthed and
published a lot of good stuff.
If a newspaper, like the soap-powder factory, is hopelessly uneconomic then it
cannot be protected for ever. But I find it very hard to believe that a paper
which 600,000 people buy each day fits that description. And I also believe
that the 600,000 people who bought it have rights which should not be
disregarded so casually.
It would be over-egging the pudding to describe Today as ``a newspaper of the
left''. Its origins lay in Eddie Shah's union-busting venture in Warrington and
it arrived in its more recent form only via a pretty nondescript initial period
under Murdoch's ownership. The reality is that it was lent a Labour-supporting,
campaigning identity by Murdoch for reasons which were founded in commerce
rather than belief. And what the press baron giveth, the press baron taketh
away.
That is a power which has to be challenged. In this case, Murdoch has not only
decided to get rid of Today. He has also used his power of ownership to ensure
that nobody will be allowed to pick up the pieces. That is a deeply
anti-competitive action and, in any society which cared about such matters,
would not be his prerogative.
The Tories never pretended to implement any safeguards on monopoly and
competition where Murdoch was concerned. The crude deal was his political
support in return for the right to buy up as much as he liked.
I doubt very much if Mr Ian Lang, our supposed protector against
anti-competitive practices, will now be shedding many tears for the death of
Today. And it will be very interesting to see whether he stirs himself if
Murdoch now turns towards the Express.
But I come back to the point that 600,000 newspaper buyers do have rights.
Similarly, in the early 1960s, the Labour-supporting Daily Herald's market of
more than 1,000,000 each day should have had rights. In that case, it was the
dearth of advertising which made the paper uneconomic. In this case, it is the
commercial priorities of a hard-nosed proprietor.
The diversity of the press in a democratic society should not rest upon such
uncertain foundations. If a market is shown to exist, then there should be
mechanisms - such as newsprint subsidies and pooling a proportion of
advertising revenue - which allow them to survive. Other more enlightened
countries have taken such steps.
The press exercises far too much influence within any society to be left
entirely to unregulated market forces. Why should there be anything remarkable
about that assertion, when it is taken for granted that all aspects of
broadcasting are regulated in the interests of balance and, indeed, truth.
I would be delighted if there were more newspapers representing all shades of
opinion. The more the merrier. But it is everything to the left of centre which
is most likely to suffer if money is essentially the only determinant of who
controls the press. Labour, in office, should not forget that reality.

AMONG the holiday habits which all but disappeared with the advent of the
package tour, was that of going to the same place year in year out. Anyone
wanting to date a film or play in the first five minutes, has only to show Mr
and Mrs Middle-Class Britain being greeted like long-lost relatives by some
seaside landlady to tell us we are in the fifties.
For it was in the main a middle-class habit, and nothing still on the screen
encapsulates in the same way safe, solid old-fashioned bourgeois respectability
quite like it. Substitute Scarborough for the mythical Austrian spa town of
Badenheim and you have the essence of Badenheim 1939, the new piece by the
Second Stride theatre company.
Badenheim is a favourite holiday destination of assimilated middle-class Jews,
and there were many such Badenheims in Austria.
The production is based on the novel of the same name by Aharon Appelfeld. What
attracts the visitors to Badenheim, as he writes in his programme notes, is
``music festivals, apple strudel, poetry readings and mild flirtations''.
For these simple pleasures they come year after year. Except, of course, that
1939 will not be like any other year. For by now Austria has been annexed by
Germany and anti-Semitism is spreading like a disease.
By now the sinister Sanitation Department is already in evidence, requiring
people to register, barbed-wire barriers are appearing at the end of the town.
By now strange posters are offering holidays in Poland.
Soon the water will be turned off to the swimming pool, food supplies will
start failing. Hotel guests and staff will find that the mysterious Polish
holiday destination is the Warsaw Ghetto and thereafter towns forever shamed by
history like Treblinka.
Until such time as this happens though, the Jewish population of Badenheim
determines to ignore the signs, to dance and flirt and drink its coffee.
Appelfeld himself describes Badenheim 1939 as ``a story of self-deception, of
sweet illusions and insane optimism . . .'' The words make clear the difficult
nature of the task facing Second Stride; how to deal with the notion that it
was such ``sweet illusions'' and ``insane optimism'' that led the Jews of
Badenheim to collude in their own fate.
Second Stride has a multi-disciplinary approach. They use music, song, and
dance as well as dialogue. What attracted them to Badenheim 1939 is that the
core of the place and the piece itself is the town's music festival.
But to allow them to present the piece in a straightforward fashion where we
become an audience as well to the festival's determined merriment would indeed
be a collusion. Our tragedy is that we know the end of the story.
It is to prevent this that he has deliberately ironed out the superficial
gaiety. The waltzing, for instance, is heavily stylised, a danse macabre
accompanied by Orlando Gough's deliberately sombre unjoyful music. The problem
is that somehow this will not do.
For being so concerned about colluding in this unholy fashion in Badenheim's
determined blindness, means we are never allowed to get any sort of sense of
the simple joie de vivre which, while it is the town's tragedy, is also, in
some sense, its triumph.
For while it is this honest-to-God gaiety which the Holocaust turned against
itself and into a death sentence, none the less we need a sense of what gave it
its life-enhancing quality; since the normal unities of tragedy and catharsis
do not operate with the Holocaust, the sheer joy in the chocolate and the cream
cake may be one of the few things we have left to hold on to.
Much the same difficulty attends the portrayal of the encroaching horrors which
the Jews determinedly do not see.
In the novel Appelfeld has an ingenious solution to the problem.
Such things as the appearance of the barbed-wire barriers and bodies being
buried at night by pastry cooks, become one-liners, hidden away in the text
between the more important business of dancing and the flirting, in the same
way that the Badenheimers hide them away in the backs of their minds.
Finding an equivalent answer on the stage, according to Spinks, proved
difficult.
Attempts to present these two particular incidents on stage to show the nature
of what was being ignored proved unsuccessful. So dark and utterly unignorable
were they, so fatally did they over-shadow the piece and undermine the sense of
self-deception which is its raison d'tre, that they had to be removed.
The problem is that without such things there is no back-drop to the
self-deception. It is vital that we get a sense of the evil outside the walls
which is so steadily approaching. We could, of course, get it from the
unfolding personal tragedies of the characters. Unfortunately, all too often
this is lost because of Second Stride's complex performing style.
In simple terms, so much is going on up there on the stage that too often we
lose the vital pointers to the tragedies which are unfolding.
The comparison with annual holidaymakers in Scarborough is not an idle one.
It's worth trying to imagine what it might have been like had it happened
there. In doing so we get somewhere near what the mind-set of the average
Badenheimer might be like, why the insane optimism triumphed, the sweet
illusion and the self-deception.
These people, as Appelfeld says in his notes, knew themselves to be ``loyal
Austrian citizens''. They thought of themselves as Austrian first. Many did not
even think of themselves as Jews so much had they inter-married.
They were middle-class bourgeoisie, the back-bone of any country.
They belonged to a country where culture, dance, poetry, even coffee and cakes
were the stuff of life, not being a Jew.
So assimilated were they that it had reached beyond what we understand to be
the bounds of the word. They didn't believe in the horror that was coming
because they couldn't believe it.
Ian Spinks has said: ``This isn't Schindler's List.'' It isn't and neither
should it be. It's a different piece altogether.
n Badenheim 1939 is at Bury St Edmunds and Sheffield this month and will be at
Glasgow Mayfest next year.

<HEADLINE>Giant bid to pump up the volumes Esso's pledge to drop petrol costs has fuelled a price war across Scotland. JANE SCOTT explains why small retailers fear closure in the eye of the tiger's campaign</HEADLINE>

THERE'S a rattling of bones and a waving of shrouds in the petrol stations of
Scotland this autumn, and the keening is loudest on the 10 or so forecourts
lining the A8 leading west out of Edinburgh.
These have been engaged for the past three months in a vicious price war which
has seen unleaded fuel, to take just one marker, drop to the point where it is
being sold at a loss.
If it carries on - and petrol stations throughout the whole central belt are
now nudging their prices down to meet the crucial break-even mark of around 46p
a litre - insiders say the industry will be damaged beyond repair, with smaller
retailers forced out of business and some oil companies possibly pulling out of
the UK altogether.
Scotland has traditionally suffered unfairly high prices, generally explained
by the cost of getting petrol to outlying stations, and the doomsday scenario
is that a decreasing number of forecourts in business will allow the major
petrol companies to carve up the country between them, sending prices even
higher.
And the main culprit will be Esso. Three months ago, on August 21, Esso
launched its Price Watch campaign in two parts of the UK, pledging to set
petrol prices that were ``among the lowest'' in the central-belt trial area,
and to match the lowest prices in the second trial area in the North-east of
England.
It was the cue for instant industry dismay. Esso, the leader of the petrol
company pack, had traditionally sold its petrol dearer than the cut-price
operators, preferring to concentrate on service and quality.
That, however, was before the supermarkets drove a discount petrol tanker
through the forecourts of Britain, taking some 20% of the market within the
past 10 years. Supermarkets love discounting petrol; it means more customers
will visit their stores, while all the forecourts could traditionally offer in
competition was a few shelves of puzzle magazines and peanut butter cookies.
Belatedly, some commentators have suggested, Esso realised that it needed to
safeguard its own market share, which had fallen from one-fifth to one-sixth.
Hence Price Watch, and a mad scramble in Scotland to keep pace. Day by day
during the summer, motorists rejoiced as the petrol forecourts of The Gyle beat
each other down, penny by penny, from an average of 54p a litre for unleaded,
until Gulf set what currently seems to be the bottom line, with petrol at just
under 45p.
Danny Roden, Gulf's director of retail and distributive services, says: ``While
we are actually quite big in the central belt of Scotland, we are fairly small
in UK terms, with only 4% market share, so we are a minnow compared with the
likes of Esso. The big difficulty is that this is an aggressive programme by
them. They have said it is to protect market share, but it will inevitably lead
to a considerable number of sites having to shut up because they are
non-viable.''
Shell, with a sixth of the UK market, is bullish about the price war,
suggesting that it was the current revamp of Shell stations and introduction of
advanced fuels and a popular loyalty scheme which forced Esso's hand. It is,
however, currently weathering the second round of customer boycotts this year -
the Brent Spar protests, over the proposed ditching of the oil platform at sea,
had little effect on forecourt sales, say industry insiders.
Spokesman Andrew Vickers says it is too early to predict the effect of protests
over Shell's investment in Nigeria, where the execution of nine environmental
activists, including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, has attracted worldwide
condemnation. This week protesters picketed a station in Edinburgh.
Shell's projects, including its #2700m liquefied natural gas plant for Nigeria,
are long term, and often outlast governments, Vickers says. ``The effect of a
Shell pull-out . . . would be far worse for the environment of the Nigerian
Delta and far worse for the Nigerian people.''
Commentators say Esso can never hope to regain the ground lost to the
supermarkets and must be planning to reassert its superiority at the expense of
smaller petrol companies and independent retailers, who cannot afford to offer
petrol at cost price for long. Companies throughout the UK are dreading the
expected announcement that Esso will roll out its Price Watch campaign
nationwide.
But petrol companies are not only hoping to attract the motorist through
aggressive pricing. They also need to hold on to the independent petrol
forecourt owners who have contracted to sell their brand of fuel.
Shell says independents are queueing up to adopt the brand, in spite of this
year's bad publicity: ``Allegations made against the company were false and
misleading, and I think people are aware of that,'' said spokesman Andrew
Vickers.
To the consternation of the industry, Esso says it has no defined budget for
the programme. Spokesman Tom MacQuillan described it as ``a long-term review of
our business'' with Price Watch continuing ``until we have got conclusive
results''.
He recognises that smaller operators may be driven out of business. ``More than
1000 sites closed last year. That's not something that we would like to see,
nor is it something we have set out to do. We are simply testing the
circumstances in the market, to improve our own business security.
``We have not set out to create a price war. We have said we will match and be
among the lowest in the two areas.''
MacQuillan denies prices will rise after Price Watch: ``I think price is now
the main driver for the consumer and I think price will stay as the main driver
for the consumer.''

ALTHOUGH the pioneers of car-building came from Germany and France, motoring
would not be the same without the inventions of a series of ingenious Scots.
The idea of harnessing early steam engines to some kind of vehicle produced
many weird and wonderful contraptions, but it was only in the 1760s, after
James Watt's almost complete redesign of the whole system, that
reliably-powered factories, railway locomotives and steam road carriages came
into being.
Watt's flash of inspiration about the separate condenser - only the first of
his many steam-engine patents - came to him in the homeliest possible way. As a
memorial stone in Glasgow Green recalls, he was having a stroll there one
Sunday in 1765, heading for the golf house, when the idea suddenly occurred to
him.
Steam coaches and carriages were, of course, heavy vehicles indeed. Fitted with
sturdy iron-shod wheels, they did not give drivers or passengers a comfortable
ride.
It was another Scotsman, R W Thomson of Stonehaven, who helped towards solving
that problem with the invention of the air-filled tyre. Thomson's original
tyres were based on what amounted to a collection of hollow leather sausages,
with the air at normal outside pressure.
The more sophisticated pneumatic tyre as we know it today was the invention of
a third Scotsman, John Boyd Dunlop. He created it first of all for cycle use.
All the vehicles at the Scottish Motor Show (ending on Sunday) run on petrol or
diesel fuel. It is the same story there. In the 1850s, Dr James Young
established the world petroleum industry. His oil was distilled first of all
from coal, and then from shale, and his fortune came not only from his own
operations in the Lothians, but also from royalties paid to him by the first US
oil companies, in the years before his master patent ran out.
The Scottish shale oil companies became part of BP, whose offices at
Grangemouth still display the brass plate of Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral
Oil Company.
Later in the nineteenth century, while many Scots worked with oil and gas
engines produced elsewhere, none of them made a fundamental contribution to
engine design until Sir Dugald Clerk produced an improved two-stroke type. For
several years, two-strokes were often referred to in the technical press as
Clerk engines.
For a time in the early 1990s, it seemed as if many of the major car
manufacturers were about to come out with modern production two-stroke engines
of the Australian Orbital type. Problems with long-term exhaust emissions have
closed down several of these projects, but it must be only a matter of time
before the lightweight two-stroke, with its minimal number of components, makes
a comeback.
The Scottish contribution to motoring, even if in some cases indirect, is
something to ponder about. Perhaps away from the show, over a flask of coffee.
Even then, there would be no escape. The vacuum flask was invented by Sir James
Dewar - born 1842, Kincardine-on-Forth.

Nairobi, Thursday
THE anguished husband of a British woman killed and raped during a robbery at
their home in Kenya told a Nairobi judge today how he found her naked from
waist down in their baby's bedroom.
Adam Winter, 28, paused to fight back tears when prosecutor Horace Okumu asked
him to describe what he saw when he went into the room where his 31-year-old
wife Caron lay dead.
``She was lying on the floor and there was very much blood,'' Winter said.
``She was unclothed from the waist down. She was facing upward.''
He said he tried to revive her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but gave up,
picked up the baby from the crib where he had placed her, and went outside.
Mrs Winter was raped and killed on July 31, 1994, during a midday robbery
staged by five or six men at the couple's home just 100yds from that of Kenya's
attorney-general.
Winter said the men were ransacking drawers in the living room and that his
15-month-old daughter was sitting on the floor, playing with the papers the men
were throwing around, when he walked in through the front door.
``One of the men ordered me to lie down, but before I could do so another one
of them hit me on the back of the head and I fell down,'' Winter told High
Court Judge Samuel Bosire.
He said he produced his wallet to hand over $350, but it was knocked out of his
hand.
``I pretended to be unconscious as they continued beating me and demanding
money,'' he said. ``They then left me alone, but I could hear their movements.
They took off my shoes.''
Yusuf Rashid Wamasoro, 22, James Washikoba, 26, both Ugandans, and Kenyan
Alexander Shikavale, 37, all deny murder. They face death by hanging if
convicted.
The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday.-AP

TERRY Wogan comes breezing into the city-centre bookshop in Glasgow, the
punters' pal who plays the jolly jester and seems bewildered by the popularity
he generates without really trying. Well . . .
Our Terence knows what he is doing all right. His broadcasting skills have been
finely honed over quarter-of-a-century or more: the jolly jape, the pregnant
pause, the mock surprise, the disarming confessions of idiocy which are hard to
dislike, especially when delivered with the charm of the Irish blarney.
It irritates some. But there are two million others out there who like it
enough to tune in every morning, waking up to Wogan and finding that it puts
their day off to a good start.
To those unfamiliar with the format, Terry's chirpy chat is mainly in response
to letters from his listeners, a species who have come to be known as TOGs, an
acronym for Terry's Old Geezers (or Gals).
It is a chance for the great anonymous mass to exercise their wit at national
level, even if some of it would be hard pushed to reach the parish magazine.
So the TOGs are a nationwide club, who spread Terry's name across the land on
car stickers and feel a personal satisfaction at being part of the accompanying
fame.
If you are not attuned to that mental attitude it can sound like a load of old
drivel. For the committed TOGs, it becomes addictive.
So the books department of the BBC was on a commercial certainty when it
decided to bring out a volume of what those listeners say.
Terence has added his tuppence-worth and it was the publication of Terry
Wogan's Bumper Book of TOGs which brought him to Waterstone's bookshop to sign
copies as part of the BBC promotion.
To his credit, he mixes with the fans and engages in banter so similar to the
regular radio chats that there must be something completely natural in this
form of self-acknowledged nonsense. In a world so beset with problems and
obsessed with issues, real or imagined, I suppose it is a safety valve for
those who cannot take much more of it. Whatever the vanities, Terry and his
TOGs are harmless. And when they turned up at the bookshop it was surely as
much to speak to their breakfast-time hero as to buy a book which they had
virtually written themselves.
Without Wogan's own warmth to speak them, however, the words tend to come
across in the cold light of print as a pretty witless collection.
In fact I had reached the second half before I felt a smile coming on. These
were ``Thoughts for the day . . .'':
Beauty is in the eye of the beerholder.
There are three kinds of people - those who can count and those who can't.
Why is ``abbreviation'' such a long word?
Don't use a big word where a diminutive one will suffice.
But the TOGs will lap it up - just as they queued to meet the man himself. Not
only that. They brought him jars of jam and miniatures of whisky, at least one
of which was consumed as he signed their books.
And when it was all over, we repaired to the Central Hotel, approaching through
the Central Station, which drew gasps of Wogan admiration for the sheer
splendour of its Victorian architecture.
In the quiet of the hotel lounge, he was able to assess that the Glasgow
book-signing had been the best of the whole promotional tour, full of warmth
and good humour. One of his regulars, a lady called Frankie, had travelled
about 90 miles from north central Scotland for the occasion.
As we raked over his career, Terry recalled that, on his return from television
to morning wireless, he had helped raise the Radio Two audience to two million.
``With so many radio stations around nowadays, there is a limit to what you can
get,'' he was saying. ``You can't get back to the halcyon days of five or six
million.''
Terry is happy to have as many listeners as he has. But he also has serious
words of caution about the future of the BBC, an organisation for which he has
long held the greatest admiration.
He fears that Britain could end up with a radio structure like that of America
and believes that the people will have to make it known that they want the BBC
to be part of popular national broadcasting.
Otherwise, he says, the Government might take it away from them - and they
won't realise what they have lost until it is gone.
In answer to criticism of the licence fee, he points to the bleak alternative
where we could end up paying as much for a few high-profile television events
as for a whole year's licence.
Terry is certainly doing his bit for Radio Two's survival, along with people
like Jimmy Young, David Jacobs, John Dunn, Desmond Carrington, and his old
Glasgow sparring partner, Ken Bruce.
His own routine begins at 5.30am and the chauffeur gets him to Broadcasting
House in Portland Place by 7.15. He is on the air within 15 minutes and claims
that his morning patter is completely unrehearsed, the TOGs' letters even
unseen before the programme starts.
That morning drive begins some way to the west of London, where House of Wogan
looks across towards House of Windsor. Rumour has it that they wave to each
other occasionally. Clearly, Terry's Old Gals and Geezers cross all social
divides.

WERE he to ask me for advice (so far no letter in the post) I would say: go for
it Ken, now is your chance to produce a Budget which will lift the High Street,
re-invigorate industry and commerce, raise consumer confidence and by the way,
start the process of winning the next General Election.
His first two Budgets were primarily concerned with bringing the PSBR back
under control, introducing (thinly-disguised) tax increases and calling for
tight public spending limits. He has been reasonably successful in spite of
diversions and alarms along the way. Much has been achieved, especially in the
control of inflation, and credit is due. But life is still very much like
wading through treacle.
The economy has slowed markedly, the pace of manufacturing (until recently
performing well) has turned sluggish, the housing market is still in the
doldrums, and both consumer and business confidence continues at a low ebb. The
Chancellor though is in a relatively strong position, in spite of present
uncertainties, and may even have brought Bank of England Governor Eddie George
into line in the matter of interest rate policy. It will not be easy but he now
has to provide a strong dose of adrenalin the economy needs. The fortunes of
the Government depend to a considerable degree on how successful he is. What
then is needed?
From a purely economic point of view , there is a good case to reject any talk
of income tax cuts, consolidate the position of the public finances, maintain a
cautious approach to interest rates, tweak fiscal policy to support investment
and generally keep her steady as she goes. Not good enough; and besides ``she''
is not going anywhere with anything like the necessary sense of purpose.
In general terms, the Chancellor's prime requirement is to restore business and
consumer confidence. The poor state of the housing market is probably the key
element in the national ``feel-bad factor'' and he should introduce measures to
get the market moving again, such as a prudent extension of MIRAS or a further
stamp-duty holiday to kick-start demand.
I believe he should also adopt an aggressive stance on interest rates. The
current slowdown in the economy must not be allowed to become a downturn. He
should use interest rate management as a regulator. The Governor of the Bank of
England has publicly acknowledged that there is no longer a case for high
interest rates and the Chancellor should accordingly reduce them.
Such a move would stimulate every part of the economy, would not necessarily
contradict fiscal prudence and would contribute vigorously to a resurgence of
consumer and business confidence, so vital to the country's economic and his
political needs.
Tax cuts are words on everybody's lips. The Chancellor should listen; he could
rearrange thresholds judiciously but, better, he should cut 1p off the basic
rate of income tax or possibly even 2p if Government spending is properly and
selectively curbed.
Capital gains tax should be restructured to favour longterm investment and
other incentives introduced to boost investment. He should review vigorously
every aspect of taxation policy and reform wherever necessary so as to create
as dynamic a balance as possible.
For instance, leave VAT alone and certainly do not countenance any extension;
reduce the tax on alcoholic beveridge (especially whisky where last year's hike
proved counterproductive to the Exchequer - a silly mistake), and at least we
will all feel jollier; go for a windfall tax on privatised utilities where it
has been suggested that #9Bn could be raised in total without affecting the
utilities' financial viability and use it to the national economic benefit;
adopt a limited reduction in advance corporation tax to encourage companies to
retain profits; fine tune and enhance investment related taxes to promote
investment and innovation; reduce the main rate of employers' national
insurance contributions as a stimulus to employment growth; make technical tax
changes to promote inward investment; and so on. In the space available one can
only make signals but the Chancellor must take this sort of route to stimulate
the economy and revive the national and commercial spirit.
To pay for it, he will have to ensure that there are achievable reductions in
public spending and much tighter controls thereafter. In spite of protestations
over the years from this Government we are still weighed down by shackles of
neo-welfare-statism. Action is required to reduce this burden. Finally, a
successfully stimulated economy will lift the Exchequer's tax revenue.
It is clearly essential that Ken Clarke must achieve this by delivering a bold
and imaginative Budget package of incentives and tax cuts combined with
Government spending curbs. Such a package would yield him the success which he
deserves and to which we are entitled.

THE sudden resignation of the chief executive of Lloyd's of London disappointed
members of the world's biggest insurance market but they said yesterday that
the troubled insurer's renewal programme was still on course.
Peter Middleton unexpectedly announced his resignation on Wednesday night and
now joins US investment bank Salomon Brothers as chief executive of its
European operations.
Mr Middleton was held in high regard by Lloyd's Names who said he had been
sympathetic to their struggle to settle a compensation package after the market
plunged into losses and pushed many of the Names to the brink of bankruptcy.
``I am very depressed about the fact that he has resigned. I had really hoped
he would see it (the renewal programme) through to the end,'' said one Name.
The chief executive's departure came as a shock after Rosalind Gilmore, Lloyd's
director of regulatory services, resigned in September. Mr Middleton had been
instrumental in putting together the market's crucial Reconstruction and
Renewal Programme.
This includes Lloyd's Equitas reinsurance vehicle, which is intended to free
Names of the burden of past liabilities in return for a one-off payment.
Around half of Lloyd's 30,000 Names are involved in legal action to recoup some
of the record losses of some #8m sustained by the market since 1988 as a result
of a series of disasters and alleged poor management.
The market itself is currently making money but is bedevilled by past pollution
and asbestos-related claims from policies written decades ago.
Names said that they did not see Mr Middleton's loss as a significant blow to
the reconstruction programme. ``I would like to think the settlement will still
work,'' one said.
The chief executive's successor, director of special projects Ron Sandler, has
also been closely involved with the programme. Like his predecessor, Sandler
was welcomed by Names as an outsider to the market.
``The members greatly regret Peter Middleton's departure . . . but the R&amp;R
programme is much bigger than just one man,'' said Roger Pascall, executive
director of the Association of Lloyd's Members.
Mr Pascall said Mr Sandler was already well established at Lloyd's despite only
joining in May and had been seen as Middleton's obvious succcessor. ``He has
already shown himself to be clearly willing to focus on R&amp;R,'' he added.
Lloyd's too was keen to convey that everything is still on course, despite the
change of faces at the top. ``It is still business as usual. There has been no
change whatsoever,'' a Lloyd's spokesman said.
He added Mr Middleton had left simply because he received an attractive job
offer from elsewhere and dismissed some press reports that hinted at a rift
with Lloyd's chairman David Rowland.
``The ship sails on,'' the spokesman said. - Reuter.

RODDY Finlay knows he should be looking harder at Scotland. As the managing
director of one of only two Scottish firms providing winter ski-chalet holidays
in Europe he is very aware that only 10% of the 1900 skiers he flew out to
France last season are Scots. Most of his customers, in fact, came from the
south of England.
``I suppose it is simple arithmetic,'' he says, sitting in his newly opened
company headquarters in a converted weaving shed in the Borders village of
Ancrum.
``There are 50 million down there and five million up here. We have never made
a big thing about being Scottish but with the high proportion of good skiers in
Scotland it is time for that to change and for us to take advantage of this
area of the market.''
From an experimental start in 1982 Finlay's Skiing has grown steadily to become
an operation with a turnover of more than #1m a year. It has just been chosen
by Scottish Borders Enterprise as one of 13 emergent firms in the region with
the potential to benefit from the LEC's ``Go For Growth'' development programme.
Finlay specialises in quality French chalet holidays in Courchevel and Val
d'Isere. Their price range runs from #260 a week to one top of the range luxury
chalet at #790 a head. Customers include Scottish Olympic equestrian silver
medalist Ian Stark - who has just booked again for Hogmanay with his wife Jenny
and a party of friends - and Genesis founder and rock star Peter Gabriel.
``As Scots operating in Scotland it now makes sense for us to increase our
efforts here. For Scotland we fly from Glasgow and Newcastle and we are selling
and competing on the assets of guaranteed good snow, affordable prices and
chalets staffed by our own people,'' says Kilmarnock-born Roddy.
``You can probably get cheaper accommodation but we believe we have a
significant advantage in still being small enough to control quality personally
and have an intimate personal knowledge of the resorts and each chalet. We can
fulfil the customer's expectations, which doesn't always happen when he or she
books with a larger more anonymous organisation.''
One element of that personal touch comes from Roddy's 47-year-old brother,
Richard, who runs the Val d'Isere operation. Courchevel is supervised by
Frenchman Philippe Bouron who maintains Scottish connection through Julie, his
Stonehaven-born wife whom he met when he worked in Glasgow.
Roddy believes fixed prices and the fact that chalet skiers can choose to spend
much of their evenings ``at home'' are shielding his customers from the poor
exchange rate and increased VAT charges that have British holidaymakers in
France wincing when they reached for their wallets this summer.
Nevertheless he is looking at Italy - probably Courmayeur or the Dolomites -as
an expension project next year. ``Italy is very good value and should provide
good business,'' he says.
And when the snow melts next spring Finlay's is ready with another area of
diversification beloved of Scots - golf. Roddy, who himself plays off seven,
says: ``We are running golfing holidays to some superb championship courses
between Bordeaux and Biarritz. They are less well known than some of the
Spanish and Portuguese golf holiday destinations but are every bit as good and
far less crowded.''

UNITED Biscuits has taken another step towards extricating itself from the US,
selling the Keebler frozen foods division for $86m or about #54.8m. The buyer
is the privately owned Windsor Food company of Houston, Texas.
Earlier this month, chief executive Eric Nicoli said UB had reached agreement
to sell its US cookie and cracker business for the equivalent of #316m.
That is by far the largest element in the Keebler operations which, since their
acqusition in 1974, have proved a major disappointment, being too small in
competition with the US giants on their home territory.
The biggest setback was the decision to set up a greenfield plant in 1988 to
take-on Pepsico in its own state - the giant reacted with both savagery and
precision in its pricing policies.
The frozen foods activities include pasta, chilli and barbeque products as well
as the Chinese Food Processing Corp. That makes Chinese appetisers and Dim Sum
dumplings, the majority of customers being in the food service industry.

Tel Aviv, Thursday
WEARING a bullet-proof vest and firing a toy pistol, the assassin of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin re-enacted the killing in front of police video cameras
today while Israeli passers-by cursed him, witnesses said.
``Murderer, die. Maniac. You piece of garbage,'' shouted Israelis who stood
behind police barriers watching Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old religious Jewish
student, show police how he gunned down Rabin at a Tel Aviv peace rally on
November 4.
Police in Israel routinely have confessed murder suspects re-enact their crimes
in front of cameras for presentation as evidence at their trials.
Dozens of police cars crowded around the square early this morning while Amir,
linked by a chain around his stomach to a police officer, went through the
motions that shocked a nation and the world.
Amir walked from the parking area, where he had pretended to be a driver for a
VIP on the night of the killing, to an outdoor staircase where he ambushed
Rabin as the Prime Minister strode to his car, witnesses said.
``He took out his gun and moved near a policeman playing Rabin,'' said Yonathan
Shaul, a news photographer for the Israeli newspaper Maariv.
``Coolly, it was incredible, he drew the gun from his hip and `tak, tak, tak' -
a few shots. He put the gun back and continued the re-enactment as if nothing
had happened. Everyone, including all the police, began yelling and cursing.
People went crazy.''
Amir has said he carried out the killing, hitting Rabin with two bullets and
wounding a bodyguard, at Tel Aviv's largest public square because he wanted to
stop the 73-year-old leader from handing over more occupied land to Palestinian
self-rule.

Washington, Thursday, PRESIDENT Clinton announced today that he would again
veto a bill offered by Congress to re-open the Government. Though the
Republicans have stripped away one of its objectionable provisions, a rise in
Medicare premiums, it would still lock in the President to accepting their
fundamental assumptions on the future of public spending, and he refuses to
accept.
The 800,000 Government workers laid off on Tuesday have been reduced
substantially in the past two days as Congress has passed two more of the
appropriations bills that should have been completed last September. However, a
bitter dispute in the House of Representatives thwarted an effort to pass a
bill for the Interior Department and a dispute with the Senate upset the State
Department and Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill.
The House debate concerns the environment. Radical Western congressmen want to
slash away at existing laws protecting wilderness areas, at the Endangered
Species Act, clean air legislation, and at environmental regulations. A revolt
by environmentally- conscious Republicans defeated the measure.
Meanwhile, the House sent to the Senate a State Department Bill including a
provision banning American contributions to international programmes that
supported abortion. The Senate rejected it, and it is now back in limbo.
The President also announced today that he was ordering workers in social
security and veterans offices to return to work on Monday, to process
applications for pensions and veterans' benefits. These already affect several
hundred thousand people, and Mr Clinton claimed that if applications were not
dealt with on a timely basis, the backlog would not be overcome for months.
It is not at all clear where the President will find the money to pay these
civil servants, but the shutdown of the Government is all theatre, so probably
nobody cares.
So far, the President is winning the public relations campaign. The public
blames Congress, not him. He achieved a further coup today when Mr Gingrich
appeared to be afflicted with a whining vanity.
The Speaker had complained that Mr Clinton had snubbed him on the long flight
to Israel and back for Yitzak Rabin's funeral. He said that the President
refused to negotiate with him and Senator Dole on the budget, and ignored him
throughout the flight. He admitted that he was playing particularly tough in
the budget battle out of pique.
That seemed petty enough, but today the White House issued photographs taken on
the plane showing Mr Clinton, Mr Gingrich, and Senator Dole, together with a
former Republican Secretary of State, George Shultz, in animated and friendly
conversation. It made the Speaker look very foolish.
Washington officially ran out of funds at midnight on Monday because of the
budget deadlock and at once shut down ``non-essential'' functions.
Although these confrontations have happened before the shutdown has never
lasted as long as this one.
McCurry indicated that Clinton, who has cancelled a planned trip to Japan,
might try to minimise the effects of the crisis by designating some of the
800,000 workers who have been sent home as ``essential'' and recalling them to
their jobs.
Clinton was to hold a Cabinet meeting late today ``to see how things are
going'' the White House spokesman said.
Although the government shutdown is the fifth in 14 years, it is already longer
than any of the previous ones, and the political confrontation has unusual
personal undertones.
Meanwhile, after weeks of disagreement over an abortion provision, the US House
of Representatives passed a $243 billion Defense Appropriations Bill today that
includes funding for B-2 bombers, missile defence and a military pay raise.
Over the arguments of liberal Democrats that Republicans were showing they
aren't serious about balancing the budget, the House voted 270-158 to pass the
spending measure - six weeks after its October 1 due date, the beginning of the
fiscal year.
The Senate was expected to take up the measure later today.
The defence Bill adds $7000m to what President Clinton requested and increases
the Pentagon budget $1700m from fiscal 1995, according to budget documents.
Rep Patricia Schroeder, a Democrat, asked how lawmakers could spend more on
bombers while cutting programmes like student loans. ``Will the American people
be more secure with their children in college or with B-2 bombers?'' Schroeder
asked.
A key motivator for the Bill's passage was the continuing federal budget
crisis, which has idled much of the Government's civilian workforce since
Tuesday. That includes 258,000 civilian Defence Department employees and
100,000 reservists.

Washington, Thursday,
AN experimental drug has succeeded in protecting monkeys exposed to an
Aids-like virus, raising hopes that an emergency treatment could be found to
prevent the Aids virus from establishing itself in humans, scientists said
today.
If the leap can be made from monkeys to humans, one of the most promising areas
for the drug is in preventing women from passing the virus to their babies
during labour and childbirth, the scientists said.
It may even help rape victims avoid infection, said researcher Che-Chung Tsai,

Washington, Thursday, THE O J Simpson trial will resume on April 2 next year.
This time, the acquitted ex-football star will face a civil suit alleging that
he must pay damages to the families of his ex-wife, Nicole, and of Ronald
Goldman, because he killed them both, whatever the jury ruled in the criminal
case.
The Goldman family is particularly insistent on pursuing Simpson. They were
outraged by the jury's verdict and intend to sue him ``for every penny he
owns''. The Brown family is more ambivalent.
Though Mrs Simpson's sister is convinced of O J's guilt, her parents are more
concerned with their grandchildren's welfare.
They worry that two children under 10 are already permanently traumatised, and
that their problems will be increased by lawsuits alleging that their father
murdered their mother. On the other hand, if the Goldmans' suit succeeds, and
Simpson is reduced to penury, his children, too, will be penniless. The Brown
family has therefore joined the Goldmans' suit: if it succeeds, and Simpson is
ordered to pay damages, half would go to the children.
The first round in the new legal battle was won by the plaintiffs. A judge in
Santa Monica, the suburb of Los Angeles where the case will be tried, ruled
yesterday that Mr Simpson's deposition must be released as soon as it is made,
and may be videotaped. Simpson had wanted the sessions kept secret.
He will be forced to answer questions that he avoided by refusing to testify at
his trial. Where was he at the time of the murders? Which of the various
versions of events he has offered is the true one? Where are his gloves and
track suit? What was in the bag he took to Chicago but did not bring back?
No doubt the lawyers for the Goldman family will press him relentlessly, and
when the tapes are broadcast, the programme will be watched by huge numbers of
people.
The deposition will be taken soon, though the trial itself is not until the
spring. This case will last even longer than the murder trial.
Meanwhile, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who successfully defended Simpson
against double murder charges, was today said to have signed a book deal
topping the #2.7m received by prosecutor Marcia       Clark.
The Los Angeles Times said Cochran's book will be titled My Journey to Justice:
The Autobiography of Johnnie L Cochran Jr. It will be published in the spring
of 1997.
The paper said another of Simpson's ``dream team'' of defence lawyers, Robert
Shapiro, completed  a #1m publishing contract on         Tuesday.

Washington, Thursday
FASHION designer Calvin Klein, who faced criticism over suggestive poses by
young models in his advertising, will not be prosecuted for sexually exploiting
children.
The US Justice Department has decided that no federal laws were violated by a
series of ads for jeans that appeared on television, in magazines, and on the
sides of city buses this           summer.
The department's child exploitation and obscenity section ``independently
verified that minors were not used as models in the particular photographs that
raised questions,'' Klein's lawyers were told.
A broad spectrum of observers, including President Clinton and his wife,
Hillary, blasted the ads and Klein agreed to withdraw them after they had run
less than two months, under pressure from the public and retailers.-AP

<TEXT>
Strasbourg, Thursday,
THE European Parliament today called on the European Union to consider imposing
an oil embargo on Nigeria to put pressure on the country's military rulers
following last week's hanging of nine minority rights activists.
In a strongly-worded resolution adopted by the bloc's only directly elected
body, the Strasbourg parliament condemned Nigeria for the ``brutal executions''
of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists.
The resolution demanded that the EU and its 15-member states take all possible
action to bring about the restoration of democracy in Africa's most populous
state, which is heavily dependent on oil revenues.
It said an oil embargo ``is one of the most effective ways to put pressure on
the Nigerian Government and therefore calls on the Commission and the Council,
taking into account the situation of the Nigerian population, to consider
imposing such a measure''.
The resolution also called for sanctions to include a freeze on the bank
accounts of the Nigerian leaders in Europe and in particular in Britain, as
well as other steps such a sports boycott.
The wording of the resolution, which is not binding for the EU member states,
is stronger than one before the bloc's foreign ministers on Monday.
Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha today accused foreign powers of
interference, in his first reaction to the international furore.
``In recent times the international community has made absolute and deliberate
efforts to interfere in our national and internal affairs,'' the
government-owned Daily Times newspaper quoted him as saying.
Abacha said the actions of the Commonwealth in suspending Nigeria over the
executions was ``most unfortunate and uncalled for''.
The nine who were executed on disputed murder charges had been campaigning for
compensation for the Ogoni tribe in south-eastern Nigeria for oil produced
there for decades by multinationals, principally Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell.
Several nations have recalled their ambassadors in protest at the hangings and
Lagos has recalled its own envoys in retaliation.
It is expected that EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels will formally approve an
arms embargo and other sanctions against Nigeria next week.
In a boost to the military Government, Shell has rejected calls to shut its
huge operations in Nigeria.
Shell, the biggest oil company in Nigeria, and its partners in a Nigerian
liquefied natural gas project met in Lagos yesterday and agreed to go ahead
with the construction of a #2500m plant.-Reuter

WASHINGTON: America's top legal officer, Attorney-General Janet Reno, said
yesterday she had the brain disorder Parkinson's disease.
But she said it was not affecting her work and that she planned to carry on
with her job. ``I'm taking my medicine. I feel fine now,'' 57-year-old Reno
told a news conference. Her only symptom has been trembling in her left hand,
which she noticed last summer.
Displaying a steady left hand for reporters, she said her symptoms were under
control as a result of taking medicine.
Parkinson's disease robs people of control over their movements by causing
tremors, a shuffling gait, and muscular rigidity. It can eventually
incapacitate its victims.
Reno said her doctor, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical
Centre, had told her that ``neither the disease nor the medication should
impair my ability to do the job, and I intend to keep on doing it''.-Reuter

Scot on run from
Spanish jail
MADRID: Convicted drug smuggler Archie Christie, 30, from Neilston, Glasgow,
was on the run yesterday after failing to return to prison at Lerida,
north-east Spain, from a week's leave.
Christie was serving a four-year sentence after being caught with 70lbs of
hashish, worth #200,000, which he was trying to get back to Britain, at a
Barcelona railway station in August last year.
Factory visit
MUNICH: The Prince of Wales was yesterday shown a model of a computer-chip
factory that German electronics giant Siemens is to build in Newcastle. The
prince has been in Germany since Monday, touring Berlin and cities in the
former East Germany. Today he is to visit Riga in Latvia.
Miss Nigeria out
SUN CITY: Nigeria's entry in the Miss World beauty contest has withdrawn amid
outrage over her country's execution of nine dissidents a week ago, a spokesman
for the organisers said last night. Youth groups in South Africa, where the
contest takes place tomorrow, had demanded that Miss Nigeria - 23-year-old
Toyin Raji - be expelled because of human rights abuses in her country.
Roh jailed
SEOUL: South Korean ex-president Roh Tae-woo was taken to jail yesterday after
being arrested on charges of bribery. Roh has confessed to amassing #420m
during his 1988-93 term. Before leaving for jail, Roh apologised to the nation
and said he would take full responsibility for the slush fund scandal.
No arms cut
MOSCOW: Russia said it was not ready to meet a key treaty deadline of midnight
last night to cut the weapons it has along its borders. Defence Minister Pavel
Grachev ruled out any chance of Moscow meeting its obligations under the
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and said the agreement's limits on arms
would ruin Russia's defence capability.
Jail sex spree
DENVER: A woman arrested on a prostitution charge was mistakenly locked up with
men - and had sex with two of them before the mix-up was discovered, officials
said. The 38-year-old woman was locked in the men's section of the Denver city
jail last Saturday after being arrested on a prostitution charge. The mix-up
began when the arresting officer indicated in paperwork that she was a male.
Election date
MOSCOW: The upper chamber of Russia's parliament has voted to hold the next
presidential election on June 16 next year. President Boris Yeltsin, whose term
expires on June 12, recommended earlier this week that a date be fixed to ease
speculation that the vote might be postponed.

Altnacraig bought out

JEBSENS, the Norwegian shipping group, has finally offered to buy out its
financially troubled Scottish associate Altnacraig Shipping.
But 720 small shareholders, who put #5m into Altnacraig through the Business
Expansion Scheme (BES), will only recover a fraction of their ill-starred
investment.
The BES shareholders, who own 70% of Altnacraig, paid between #1 and #2.25 for
shares in Altnacraig between 1988 and 1990.
Now they are being offered to surrender them for shares in Jebsens, an unquoted
Norwegian company controlled by the Jebsen family, or 60p in cash.
Altnacraig has made a loss ever since its foundation in 1988 and has never paid
a dividend.
But it has always worked closely with Jebsens, a family-owned shipping firm
with which Altnacraig's chairman and founder Sir Ross Belch has close personal
links.
Sir Ross, 75, was formerly managing director of Scott Lithgow shipyards on the
Clyde which once built ships for Jebsens.
Altnacraig now operates as a virtual arms-length subsidiary of the Norwegian
firm, operating four ageing bulk carriers on time charter to the Jebsen-Wilson
Eurocarriers pool. In 1993, Sir Ross founded another company, Altnamara
Shipping, with #920,000 of shares raised under the BES and its successor, the
Enterprise Investment Scheme. This also operates a freighter on time charter to
Jebsens.
Altnacraig's directors have recommended acceptance of the Jebsens bid, which is
said to value the company at #3.25m.
The Norwegian group already owns 21.7% of Altnacraig and its chairman, Atle
Jebsen, pledged in June to make a friendly offer for the company.
But he warned then that Altnacraig shareholders should not expect to get all
their money back.
The Altnacraig board is under pressure to offer a cash exit to BES shareholders
now that they can sell their shares with full tax benefits after having held
them for five years.
And there is also a question mark over how long Altnacraig could continue to
trade as an independent company. Its latest loss of #288,000 in 1994 on
turnover of #3.8m reduced net assets to less than half of shareholder funds.
Jebsens is offering Altnacraig shareholders one Jebsens cumulative convertible
preferred share carrying an annual 10% dividend for each Altnacraig share or
seven Jebsens shares and 225p for every 10 Altnacraig shares.
However, the Jebsens shares would be difficult to sell since the company is not
quoted on any stock market. It has talked of seeking a quotation on the US
NASDAQ exchange, but dealing costs there are relatively high.
Altnacraig shareholders requiring a straight cash exit are being offered 60p
per share. The closing date for acceptances is December 22.

A GROUP of Scottish golfing holiday tour operators is ready to challenge a #5m
agreement which restricts access to the Old Course at St Andrews. Their claim
is on grounds of restraint of trade.
A confederation of nine companies, the Scottish Incoming Golf Tour Operators'
Association (SIGTOA) is vehemently opposed to the deal between the St Andrews
Links Trust and London hospitality company, the Keith Prowse Agency, to sell
starting times at the home of golf over a 10-year period.
SIGTOA and the St Andrews Hotels and Guest Houses Association believe corporate
interests descending on the town for just one or two rounds, will affect
adversely local business as well as tourism elsewhere in Scotland.
Mr Duncan Dewar, of the Fife-based company Best of Scotland Holidays which
holds the chair of SIGTOA, confirmed they are seeking the intervention of the
Secretary of State for Scotland who appoints links trust members, and of the
Scottish Tourist Board, to protect national interests.
``I have just returned from business meetings in the USA, and the British
Tourism office in New York is being flooded with complaints and switches to
Ireland.'' said Mr Dewar.
``Corporate packages of #1300 are convincing people that Scotland is too
expensive.''
Mr Ian McCaig, a leisure and tourism consultant acting on behalf of SIGTOA,
said: ``We believe this may be a restraint of trade and are looking at the
legal details. For many, the round over the Old Course is the treat around
which they actually come to Scotland.''
The majority of the crowd of 200 which packed St Andrews Town Hall this week
was against the new agreement. Dr David Reid, chairman of the Golf Heritage
Society of St Andrews, branded the trust as ``bringing St Andrews into
disrepute'' and claimed that the action was illegal.
The Hon.John Lindesay-Bethune, a former chairman of the trust, defended their
actions: ``What we have done, we believe to be in the best interests of the
town and the links, in order to improve them and secure them for the future.''
The former captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club explained that the links
would benefit from the #5m revenue to compete with six new courses due to open
in the area.
Increasing the price of playing a round on the Old Course to #100, or
``swingeing increases'' in season ticket prices were, he said, equally
unacceptable.
An Old Course spokesman confirmed yesterday that tee-off times are already
fully booked for all of May, September, and the first half of October. June,
July, and August applications have not yet all been processed but already look
likely to have filled all available tee-off times.
Tour operators are concerned not just about St Andrews but other leading
Scottish courses which may be outwith the reach of the ordinary golfer. It is
impossible to play a round at either Turnberry or Gleneagles without being
resident in the hotels. A round over Turnberry's Ailsa course next summer will
cost #250. Other charges next summer:
q.St Andrews - #60 per round. Very limited availability
q.Royal Troon - #90 per round.
q.Turnberry - Hotel residents only. Minimum #190 per single room, plus #60.
q.Gleneagles - Hotel residents only. Minimum #130 per single room, plus #65 per
round.

AS a Labour Party member for over 15 years, I was intrigued by the letter from
John Foster of the Communist Party of Britain (November 15) where he argued
that the left should not leave the Labour Party but stay inside and battle for
progressive policies. Also, a left split from Labour would confuse the voters.
What I find confusing is that John Foster stood as a CPB candidate against
Labour in the recent local authority elections and now he wants to volunteer me
for a suicide mission!
Many, including John Foster, recognise that New Labour is chasing after the
rightward lurch of the Conservatives and that a future Labour Government would
come into conflict with the aspirations of ordinary working people and the
trade unions.
I have yet to hear anyone argue with any commitment that there is a realistic
prospect of the left reversing Tony Blair's agenda after a Labour victory.
Arthur Scargill's logic is that a new socialist party is inevitable. The left
needs serious discussions about timing, structures, and policies - and these
will not be easy.
But the alternative may be plunging our country to the depths of US politics
where the majority don't vote because there is little to choose between the
major parties.

THE BBC's Panorama interview with the Princess of Wales is expected to reach an
audience of hundreds of million worldwide following sales of the programme to
foreign broadcasting networks.
The carefully guarded interview, reported to have been seen by only eight
people at the BBC, has attracted interest from a number of networks, including
ABC in the US, CBC in Canada, and NHK in Japan.
The ABC deal alone is reputed to be worth $1m (#660,000). The programme will be
aired at prime time on November 24 in the US.
A BBC spokeswoman said that nobody outside the BBC, neither the palace nor the
princess herself, had the opportunity to vet the final programme.``There has
been no such request and it wouldn't be normal practice,'' she said.
In the Commons, Southampton Tory MP James Hill urged the princess to become a
``roving ambassador'' for Britain. Mr Hill's comments came as it was revealed
that the Prime Minister is to be questioned in Parliament next week about the
Duke of Windsor's alleged ``flirtation'' with the Nazis during the Second World
War.
Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said he suspected that the duke - who was appointed
Duke of Windsor after succeeding to the throne as Edward VIII in 1936 and
abdicating the same year - was exploring the possibility of being restored to
the throne if Britain had capitulated to the Germans.
The king abdicated in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
Mr Mackinlay has tabled a series of Commons questions on the issue following
accusations in a Channel 4 documentary that the duke was involved in a plot to
betray Britain to the Nazis. The Traitor King was broadcast last night.
The MP for Thurrock has asked the reasons for the refusal to release to the
Public Records Office ``certain papers relating to the conduct of the Duke of
Windsor during the Second World War''.
He said: ``It is absolutely scandalous that this matter can be covered up."
House of Commons authorities have refused to allow Mr Mackinlay to table a
question about whether the duke secretly married a woman called Millicent
Milroy in Canada during the 1920s.

<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975339646</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BOND and equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic are taking a lot for
granted. Share prices in London and New York have moved into record-breaking
territory in defiance of concerns about the tug-of-war between the Democrat
President and the Republican Congress over federal debt, and closer to home,
the Chancellor's scope for cutting interest rates on the back of a tax-cutting
Budget.
Wall Street is betting on a quick settlement of the US budget row and a
subsequent cut in short-term money market rates after the next scheduled
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 19.
The City has its sights set on the meeting between the Chancellor and the
Governor of the Bank of England on December 13 to deliver a half-point cut in
base rates.
Speculation about changes in interest rates is one of the most powerful
influences on stock markets. Dividend yields are inextricably linked to returns
that can be obtained elsewhere and so highly sensitive to the level of interest
rates.
Foreign exchange markets see interest rates in terms of the support they offer
to a currency's exchange rate. The prospect of a cut is regularly seen as
detracting from a currency's attractions.
It is no accident, therefore, that sterling and the dollar should both have a
rather sickly look about them at the moment.
The pound's trade-weighted index is just a touch above its all-time low,
established on Wednesday. And the dollar has given up a good part of its summer
gains against the hard currencies, the Japanese yen and the German mark.
A depreciating currency holds fewer dangers for the US than other nations,
because most essential commodities are priced in dollars. Imported inflation
through the depreciation of sterling is an ever-present threat to the inflation
outlook in the UK.
Kenneth Clarke cannot afford to ignore the reaction of the foreign exchange
markets to his Budget or to any subsequent rate cut, especially if it was
implemented against the advice of the Bank of England.
Investors should not count their chickens before they are hatched. At this
stage there seems little to be gained by chasing share prices into the
stratosphere.
Even if the hoped-for rate cuts materialise, markets often take the view that
it is better to travel than arrive. The faster shares rise the more likely is a
bout of profit-taking.
Policy bonus
LEGAL &amp; General with-profits policyholders may be wondering why, if there is
such a large surplus on their life fund, as the group said yesterday, their
bonus rates were cut this year.
The answer is that when setting bonus rates actuaries look towards the future
rather than what has happened in the past and they reacted with caution given
the outlook for investment returns, particularly fixed interest returns, and
lower inflation.
In addition, part of the surplus on the fund is legitimately owned by L&amp;G
shareholders, given their support for the with-profits fund, particularly in
the early days. The group has looked back into the history of the fund and
found that shareholders indirectly funded 40% of bonuses declared in its first
20 years. L&amp;G argues that the fund is now so strong that shareholders are
entitled to receive a higher return from their investment.
However the benefit to shareholders needs to be kept in perspective. L&amp;G is not
about to declare utility-sized dividend increases. The changes will allow
dividends to increase at a rate considerably above inflation, but L&amp;G may
decide that shareholders would be better served in the long-term if their funds
were used in other ways - like buying another life company.
The industry is after all ripe for rationalisation and acquisitions will be
easy to come by. Either way the changes were well flagged and L&amp;G shares have
outperformed this year so there is little more to go for.
L&amp;G is inviting its policyholders to comment on its proposals and their views
will be taken into account in the final decision to proceed, or on any
modifications. This is definitely to be encouraged. It is an idea other
companies should copy - consulting their shareholders every so often over their
strategy and how the business is run.
Brick wall
THOSE connected with construction and the housing market have become
increasingly vocal, as the Budget approaches, on the need for the Chancellor to
do something to restore confidence and provide a boost for homebuyers.
Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman of the housing group which bears his name, said
yesterday that unless the Government reverses some of the damaging actions it
has inflicted over the past two years the housing market simply will not
recover.
He says the Government, which used to be the champion of the homeowner, has hit
homeowners with four hammer blows - the re-introduction of stamp duty on house
purchases over #60,000; two cuts in mortgage interest relief; two increases in
interest rates and, the last straw, a cut last month in mortgage interest
Income Support.
Whether the Chancellor will take direct action remains to be seen, but it seems
doubtful, although there are those who believe he may abolish stamp duty. This,
in itself, may not be enough to stimulate a moribund market but would at least
be a gesture and not cost too much.
The Treasury has always been opposed to mortgage interest relief and would like
to see it disappear completely, and no reversal on this policy, which would be
very expensive anyway, seems likely.
The director-general of the CBI has stated that the best way to help
construction and housing is to get interest rates down and the industry may
well have to settle for this.

<TEXT>
SCOTS are clinging on to their cars for eight out of 10 journeys and more are
using them for trips of less than half a mile.
Even people who don't have a car feel their use is too important to be given up
for the sake of the environment.
Cars are fast becoming a new ``mini-freight'' service for regular grocery runs
to supermarkets, according to a major report by the RAC published yesterday.
The survey of Scottish attitudes to cars makes depressing reading for
environmental groups determined to encourage people on to public transport.
``Dependence is a reality for up to 80% of the journeys people make.
"Other forms of transport simply cannot do the job,'' said Mr Jeffrey Rose, RAC
chairman.
He said Scots believed their cars provided independence, a feeling of control
over their lives, driving pleasure, and led to big cash savings.
Mothers, increasingly anxious for the safety of their children, are making more
car trips to nurseries. The RAC would like improved, secure public transport
for very young children.
The RAC asked people to spend a week recording every journey, no matter how
short, to see how much they used their cars. A spokeswoman for the RAC said:
``It just shows how much we have come to rely on our cars and that it is going
to be very difficult to persuade people to change to public transport.
``The way to tackle the problem is to encourage the 20% who feel they are not
dependent on their cars to change to public transport which, of course, needs
huge investment if it is to succeed in attracting people.

t
A DAMAGES action for #100,000 in which the widow and family of a taxi driver is
suing the man acquitted of his murder was described yesterday as an abuse of
the civil courts.
A judge was urged to dismiss the claim by Mrs Margaret Mullan and her three
children because the family's real motive was to have Mr David Anderson branded
as a killer.
However, Mrs Mullan's counsel argued that the Mullans were perfectly entitled
to claim for the loss of the family breadwinner.
The Mullans are suing Mr Anderson, 24, who was charged with the murder of Mr
Raymond Mullan, 38. After trial at the High Court in Paisley in May 1990, the
jury returned a not-proven verdict.
Mrs Mullan, 41, of Wren Road, Greenock, is claiming #40,000 and her children,
Charlene, 21, Nicola, 19, and Craig, 16, are claiming #20,000 each in an action
at the Court of Session.
They maintain that, during an early morning taxi ride from Gourock to Greenock,
Mr Anderson produced a hunting knife and intentionally or negligently stabbed
Mr Mullan through the heart.
Mr Anderson insists that the contact between Mr Mullan and the knife was
accidental. He claims he was going to hunt rabbits and had produced the knife
to show the driver.
Yesterday, Mr Andrew Smith, counsel for Mr Anderson, asked temporary judge
Gordon Coutts to dismiss the action because it was contrary to public policy.
If the court did not agree to dismiss the case at this stage, Mr Smith argued
that there should be a preliminary hearing to decide whether the real motive
behind the case was to have Mr Anderson branded as a criminal rather than to
recover damages.
In his defences to the action, Mr Anderson alleges that the family is well
aware that, if they win the case, the prospect of recovering any money is
virtually nil since he has no job and no assets.
The family states that, by his wrongful actings, Mr Anderson, of Nelson Road,
Gourock, rendered Mrs Mullan a widow at the age of 36 and deprived her and the
children of the support, care, and love of Mr Mullan.
Mr Smith said: ``It is quite plain that the motive of the Mullans is to have Mr
Anderson branded as a criminal. It is not motivated by any reasonable desire
for a monetary decree. For that reason and reasons of public policy this is an
abuse of process which should result in dismissal.''
The judge asked if the issue of the prospects of recovery was behind Mr Smith's
argument.
Mr Smith replied that the prospect of recovery was one of the factors.
If the case went to a preliminary hearing, a number of questions would be
asked. Why was the action raised seven days after the jury verdict? Would the
action have been raised if Mr Anderson had been convicted? Had Mrs Mullan
claimed criminal injuries compensation over her husband's death?
Mr Smith said he was not arguing that the Mullans were not entitled to raise a
civil claim following Mr Anderson's acquittal in a criminal court. However, Mrs
Mullan's motive had to be to obtain damages and he submitted that was not so.
Mr Ronald Mackay QC, for the Mullans, said the allegation was that Mr Anderson
had assaulted Mr Mullan and that he had died as a result.
Assault was a civil wrong as well as a crime and the relatives of someone who
died as a result of an assault had a claim for damages.
If someone died as a result of an assault, the criminal law might classify it
as murder or culpable homicide, but the distinction was immaterial in civil law
since damages for loss of support and loss of society were recoverable in
either event.
The case continues and it is expected that judgment will be reserved.

TODAY - the brainchild of entrepreneur Mr Eddy Shah - was claimed to be
Britain's first computerised colour, national-daily newspaper when it hit the
streets on March 4, 1986.
However, its introduction took very few sales away from the established
dailies, although it was instrumental in starting a revolution in Fleet Street
which changed the face of the newspaper industry in the UK.
Politically, in its early days, despite a vow to be without party or prejudice,
the paper smacked of its middle-of-the-market rivals, like the Daily Express
and Daily Mail although in more recent years its slant was somewhat less
right-wing.
The comments of one newspaper critic shortly after its launch appeared to act
like a dark shadow during its lifetime, as it struggled to establish itself
even under different ownership: ``It appears not to have stumbled on a single
original notion, and those it has borrowed are implemented with far less elan
than they are by its well-established rivals.''
By June, 1986, the Sunday edition of Today ceased distribution in Scotland,
apparently because it was not well-received by readers who complained of its
failure to give full coverage of Scottish affairs.
Mr Shah dismissed reports of a cash crisis, but sold out to Mr Tiny Rowland's
Lonrho - the former owners of The Herald and Evening Times - within three
months of the paper's launch. Mr Rupert Murdoch, proprietor of the Sunday Times
and the Sun, became its third owner in 16 months when he bought it in July,
1987.
Mr Shah had shot to fame in 1983, when, using the Government's new employment
legislation, he defeated the National Graphical Association in a historic
dispute in Warrington.
In March, 1986, there were 600 on his payroll whereas the Express group,
producing two daily papers with less than double the projected circulation of
Today, employed more than 10 times that number.
In the early days Sainsbury was able to buy a full-page colour advertisement in
Today for #9600. Because of the new production techniques the advertisement
could list actual food prices, something which was virtually impossible in
colour advertisements previously, because of the time colour took to process. A
similar advertisement in the Daily Mail or Express without the up-to-date
prices, would have cost close to #40,000.
The threat to Fleet Street from Mr Shah was clear. Hence the efforts to speed
up the introduction of new technology and sweep away print-union labour
practices which in the end spelled the paper's demise.
Mr Murdoch out-manoeuvred his arch-rival, the late Robert Maxwell, in July,
1987, to add the title to his stable of newspapers, after Lonrho had pumped
more than #40m into it. Both men had seen the potential of the paper, once it
was re-directed and pointed at what was claimed to be a vulnerable Daily Mail
and Daily Express middle market.
News International appointed Mr David Montgomery, former editor of the News of
the World, as editor of Today. He is now chief executive with Mirror Group
Newspapers. A succession of editors followed him to hold the Today seat.
Today's circulation never reached the level hoped for, especially north of the
Border where a Scottish base and Scottish edition was launched last year at
Kinning Park, Glasgow, described by some as Mr Murdoch's Wapping on the Clyde.
Last December sales of 23,000 copies a day north of the Border were said to be
creating major tensions. Today editor, Mr Richard Stott, had said he hoped to
double sales of the mid-market tabloid in Scotland from 17,000 to 34,000. Five
staff worked in the paper's Glasgow bureau.
Although it achieved a 40,000 circulation initially by cutting its cover price
to 10p and a TV advertising campaign, latterly its figures were just 7000 more
than when it served the Scottish market from London.
Overall sales of the paper nationally reached an all-time high last year, but
with increasing pressure from rising newsprint costs dropped 8% to an average
of 573,680 over the last six months.

CLYDESDALE Bank's pre-tax profits rose by a modest 2.6% to #113.6m last year,
reflecting its policy of concentrating on Scotland and turning a blind eye to
lucrative business opportunities south of the Border.
This limitation is imposed by parent company, National Australia Bank (NAB),
which does not want to see Clydesdale competing head on with its group
stablemate Yorkshire Bank in England.
Clydesdale therefore has to stick to its knitting in a rather patchy Scottish
market and a small corner of North-west England where it has had a small
presence for more than a century.
``We do not have the opportunity that some of our Scottish competitors have to
write business at handsome margins south of Hadrian's Wall,'' said outgoing
chief executive Frank Cicutto.
Mr Cicutto, 44, leaves Clydesdale in March to take a top job at NAB's
headquarters in Melbourne.
He will hand over to his deputy, Fred Goodwin, 38, who was recruited to
Clydesdale in March to be groomed as his successor.
Although profit growth was slim during the year to September 30, Clydesdale
managed to boost core lending by 11.2% to #4716m as senior management was
strengthened by the recruitment of a new team of dynamic young bankers.
The bank achieved 15% growth in business lending and 7.5% growth in personal
lending, mainly in the form of mortgages.
Provision for bad debts was cut by 23% to #16.6m, a level which Mr Cicutto said
would be difficult to reduce further.
The cost-income ratio improved marginally to 59.9% from 60.3%, but remained
nearly 10 points higher than that of Clydesdale's two main competitors - Bank
of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland.
Mr Cicutto partly attributes this gap to Clydesdale's continuing heavy
investment, especially in new technology. This rose 40% to about #20m last year
and was charged immediately to operating expenses.
He described 1994/95 as a year of transition in Clydesdale, during which senior
management changes and a new staff remuneration structure were brought in, as
well as a series of new financial products.
Staff resistance to some of these changes led to a one-day strike in February,
but Mr Cicutto said these problems had now been resolved.
He predicted that the structural changes which he has put in place over the
last 18 months would lead to improved efficiency and customer service in the
future which would feed through into new business and higher profits.
Clydesdale has launched new loan products for business investment and a new
flexible repayment mortgage over the the past year, and last month it began
selling life assurance.
``I am very confident about the future of the bank. It is a franchise that we
know we can develop well past where it is today,'' Mr Cicutto said.
He repeated his conviction that there was ``huge overcapacity`` in UK banking
and that further consolidation, along the lines of the merger of Lloyds and
TSB, was inevitable.
``There are no hiding places any longer and only the strongest will survive,''
Mr Cicutto said, adding that National Australia Bank could well play a part in
the consolidation process.
Besides Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank, the group owns Northern Bank in Northern
Ireland. But there is a yawning gap in its coverage of southern England which
could be nicely plugged by the purchase of a building society.
Clydesdale chairman Lord Nickson, who is a member of the NAB board, said
further acquisitions in the UK remained a possibility.
But he added: ``There is nothing at all at the moment that is ongoing.''
National Australia Bank specialises in buying strong regional banks in western
countries.
It has just bought Michigan National Bank in the United States and is currently
bidding for Ireland's TSB bank in competition with National Westminister Bank.
The Clydesdale results were published alongside those of the National Australia
Bank group, which showed record profits from its seven banks in Australia, New
Zealand, the United States, the UK and Ireland.
Group operating profits rose 15.3% to to A$1936m (#968m).
But the contribution of the group's UK and Ireland division fell 1.9% to A$420m
(#200m), reflecting the high start-up of costs of National Australia Life, its
Clydebank-based life assurance company which began operations last month.

A BOY is fighting for his life and another is recovering in hospital after they
took a drugs cocktail including ecstasy.
Eddie Ingleby and Kenneth Williams, both 15, became ill shortly before Leah
Betts died after taking the drug at her eighteenth birthday party.
The schoolboys were taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham, Hampshire,
after hallucinating at their homes on Wednesday night.
Kenneth remains in the hospital's intensive-care unit while Eddie is said to be
recovering.
Both boys are from Leigh Park area of Havant, Hampshire.
Kenneth's mother, Mrs Sandra Page, described how her son returned staggering
and stumbling to their home.
She said her son could not speak when he arrived home and added: ``I'd like to
string up whoever is responsible for this.''
Kenneth's step-brother, Carl Page, said his brother kept falling over and
bumping into things.
He said: ``He went into the kitchen and tried buttering a plate. We thought he
was just drunk.
"We put him to bed but he kept getting out and wanted to sleep on the floor.
"He got really aggressive when we went towards him.''
The family called an ambulance at about 11pm   and he was taken to hos-  pital.
Eddie was taken to the hospital about an hour later, after his mother found him
staggering uncontrollably around their home.
Detectives in Portsmouth warned yesterday that the drugs problem was so bad in
the city they could end up with ``10 Leah Betts tragedies every week''.
Drug squad Detective Sergeant Nigel Midgley said Portsmouth's club scene
attracted thousands of people from around the region each weekend and drugs
were widely available.
``We have spoken to both the boys but not surprisingly they do not want to tell
us what they took.
``We believe that they took a cocktail of drugs. It's frighteningly easy to get
hold of ecstasy, amphetamines, and cannabis.''
He added: ``When the boys were brought to the hospital, they were both
hallucinating and drifting in and out of consciousness.
``It was apparently too late to stomach pump them, and this is why we're
finding it difficult to identify what they actually took.
``We'll be interviewing them both when they are released from hospital and
we're now making inquiries to find out where they got the drugs from.''
Drug squad officers say that up to 25,000 ecstasy tablets a week are being sold
in Portsmouth.
They estimate that the ecstasy trade in their city alone is worth #13m a
year.

IT IS a curious paradox that John Foster, Scottish Secretary of the Communist
Party of Britain, should oppose the formation of a new Socialist Labour Party,
calling on socialists instead to stay and fight within the existing Labour
structure (November 15).
For the bedraggled and dwindling band of socialists remaining within the Labour
Party, the CPB must appear like the political equivalent of those First World
War generals who insisted - from a safe distance - on fighting on to the last
drop of blood.
The ideals of democratic socialism are supported by at least a sizeable
minority of the population. With New Labour now decisively to the right of the
old Tory Party of Ted Heath, Alec Douglas-Home, and Harold Macmillan, and with
the SNP in Scotland promoting its own tartan-wrapped brand of free-market
capitalism, a large swathe of the population has been effectively
disenfranchised.
The CPB do a great disservice to the cause of socialism and democracy by
opposing Arthur Scargill's courageous attempt to create a political voice for
those who have been abandoned by New Labour. Yes, Labour still has links with
the trade-union movement. But these links are slowly but surely in the process
of being dissolved.
Meanwhile, the Labour leadership continues to railroad through a series of
changes to the party rules specificially designed to suppress future internal
opposition.
John Foster wants Labour Party members to hold on for another three, four, or
five years until everyone is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the
vanquishing of the left has finally been completed. But the captain of a
wrecked ship doesn't wait until the vessel has plummeted to the sea-bed before
launching the lifeboats.
A New Labour Government under Blair will ultimately alienate millions and pave
the way for the Tories to return with a vengeance. The danger is that while
this tragic drama unfolds, socialism becomes more and more marginalised.
The real battle for socialism won't be fought in tiny backroom Labour Party
meetings. It will be fought in local communities, in workplaces, in colleges
and universities. In order to wage that battle effectively a new socialist
party is needed.
Socialists from all traditions should come together to create a mass,
broad-based socialist party in Scotland, running parallel with a similar party
in England and Wales.

THE Prime Minister is preparing to revive the Northern Ireland peace process
and has given full backing to changes in the way Scottish legislation is
handled.
Mr Major signalled his double initiative in an interview yesterday when he made
a remarkable statement about an independent Scotland.
``Scotland could be a separate nation - it is perfectly credible. There are
five million Scots, there are many nations, not least those in the European
Community, no larger than Scotland. Scotland could stand on its own.''
On Ireland, Mr Major is about to send details of a revised ``twin track'' plan
to Irish Premier John Bruton. This approach involves running preliminary talks,
involving Sinn Fein and loyalist groups, alongside an independent commission
chaired by a leading American to oversee the decommissioning of terrorist
weapons.
The second stage would be all-party talks.
Mr Major said in an interview in the Independent that he still wants the IRA to
start handing over its weapons before the all-party talks could begin.
The peace process stalled in early September when Dublin pulled out of a summit
at the last minute after apparently bowing to pressure from Sinn Fein, which
strongly opposes the idea of an arms commission.
The new approach could heal the breach between Mr Major and Mr Bruton but no
date has been set for a meeting between the two.
Mr Major also signalled his support for Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's
pledge to set out an agenda for the future of how Scotland is governed in a St
Andrew's Day speech.
Mr Major said he wanted people in Scotland to have better access to government.
More powers will be given to the Scottish Grand Committee to pass legislation,
sidelining Westminster.
Mr Major said: ``I can understand very clearly why the Scots sometimes feel
that Westminster is a long way off and that nobody is paying interest in them.
``I think the proposition for a Scottish Parliament is flawed for economic and
constitutional reasons. But I have been discussing some proposals with Michael
Forsyth as to how we might move forward and it is a subject that remains high
on my agenda.
``I hope we will be able to announce the outcome of our discussions within a
very few weeks.''
Mr Major recognised the threat posed by the SNP.
He said that because of the way Labour had framed its devolution proposals they
could provide a platform for the ``separatist party'' to gain a majority in
Scotland and claim a mandate for separatism.
``Once that demon rears its head it is very difficult to deal with, as we have
seen in various parts of the world. We ought not to let it raise its head.
``What I fear is happening, and this is not a political position, is that
Labour is offering a proposition for Scotland to keep the Scottish Nationalists
at bay because it is in Labour's political interest to do so.''
Conceding that Scotland could stand on its own, he added: ``It would be weaker
than standing as part of the UK, and the UK would be weaker without Scotland.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said last night the Prime Minister
would have to be less cryptic before he could comment in detail on his
proposals.
``It is welcome that the Conservatives are waking up to the strength of feeling
in Scotland. But if this remedy is simply going to be more cosmetic changes to
the Scottish Grand Committee then the plans will just be treated with
derision.''
He added: ``There is an air of panic about after 100 days of Forysth's three
initiatives a day.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ``This is an admission that the Taking Stock
exercise of only two years ago has been an abject failure in satisfying the
Scottish demand for real change.''
He said the Prime Minister should immediately concede a constitutional
referendum.

BUCKINGHAM Palace officials, concerned over the BBC's handling of the Panorama
interview with the Princess of Wales, may consider switching the filming of the
Queen's Christmas broadcast to another channel.
Royal aides were shocked when the princess gave the Panorama interview without
informing her palace advisers.
Senior palace officials are now expressing scepticism about the BBC's
explanation of how it scooped the hour-long interview.
A palace spokesman said in a veiled threat to the BBC: ``No institution can
take for granted its relationship with the media, just as the media - and in
this case the BBC - cannot take its relationship for granted with us.''
Meanwhile, National Grid engineers have put the Dinorwic plant in Snowdonia,
north Wales, on stand-by to cope with extra demand when viewers switch on
kettles at the end of the programme on Monday.

ON international duty at Hampden on Wednesday as a foot soldier in the Tartan
Army we were, on your behalf, standing in the half-time queue watching the
snails whizz past, all agog to sample the latest in Hampden cuisine.
When we finally got to the hatch (Motto: A Century of Caring Catering -
Starting Soon) and were dished out the pie in its neat little non-biodegradable
aluminium foil ashet and the plastic cup of superheated Bovril, we were also
handed a plastic poke containing a napkin, a wee plastic Bovril stirrer, and a
sachet of sugar.
``Oh, aye,'' said the chap behind the Diary, with no evidence of surprise,
``it's an acquired taste.''
Take a powder
NEWS in, from the Crime Scene column in the Motherwell People, of some
tealeaves with more than their share of forethought - and non-malicious
forethought at that. After removing three cases of Strongbow, six cases of
Holsten Pils, six cases of Miller Pilsner, and six cases of Spectro beer from a
car parked outside a cash and carry, the thieves also thoughtfully took four
boxes of Askit powders.
Hands on
IN a very informative piece in Farmers Weekly about the ins and outs of the
artificial insemination of cows, headlined ``A.I. - You Must Keep Hand In''.
No, honest. The common pitfalls of this labour-intensive practice are outlined.
Amid talk of Q-sums, submission rates, and inter-oestrus interval, three
mistakes emerge clearly. They are: Reduced fertility due to poor insemination
skills; Getting the A.I. gun in the wrong place and poor semen handling, which
sound sad, painful, and embarrassing.
At the top of the page is a photograph of a farmer, oxter-deep in cow, who
inseminates most of the 300-head Holstein Fresian herd at Ashburton, South
Devon. His name is Patrick Cock.
All shook up
HUGH Reed and the Velvet Underpants, one of the growing number of tribute
bands, have just been commissioned to do the music for a forthcoming film about
Robert Burns. Hugh O'Hagan, for such is his given name, and the boys recently
appeared on Trial By Night, putting forward the proposition that Rabbie was
Scotland's first and greatest superstar. Towards this end, they disguised
themselves as Rabbie Burns and the Tartan Trews and played that little-known
ditty You Ain't Nothin But A Tim'rous Beastie.
They have also recorded You're Bard and a reggae version of Ye Jacobites By
Name. They will positively not be playing The Cottar's Saturday Night Fever or
My Love Is Like A Red, Red Rose, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, as we have just invented
them, but readers will no doubt be able to improvise on the theme.
Bands on the run
MORE on tribute bands. Colleague Ian Bell is not a fan of the Bootleg Beatles
but we are, as we have seen them perform and they are splendiferously good. We
have also seen the Counterfeit Stones, The Australian Doors, and Bjorn Again,
one of the many Abba soundalikes. Bands we would like to hear include The Real
Pretenders, The Man Who Would B.B King and Unfrank Sinatra. Real and imagined
names will be welcomed.
In the dark
ENTREPRENEURS in Blandford in Dorset, possibly in an attempt to make the place
sound more wild or less like a place for scoring heroin, has just opened a new
niterie named, in a burst of daring innuendo, The G Spot. The Diary has grave
fears for the club's future, as a survey among our female colleagues shows
that, in their experience, 93% of men will not be able to find it.
Clash of interests
A NEW category of events has entered the ken. This is the Back To Back Haud Me
Back, as tomorrow the Lord Provost and Glasgow City Council host at 12 noon the
visit of the Salvation Army Texas Brass and Timbrels UK tour, and follow this
up at 1pm with a similar reception for the AGM of the Association of Lourdes
Hospitalite. The second wee gay and hearty offers a finger buffet, wine, and
soft drinks while the first has the same buffet, but does not specify the
refreshments on offer.
Out there in Texas, where the tall timbrels grow, they are usually called
tambourines.
But the free minds at the Diary would be willing to bet our much-grooved Dylan
records that the Sally Ann won't have a Mr Tambourine Man on call.
Sailing on
A PIECE of good news from Her Majesty's Commissioners of Customs and Excise is
that the petition for the winding up of Flagship (Scotland) Ltd has been
withdrawn and that the Anniesland-based leisure club sails merrily on. One
would hope that this is an analogy for the state of the nation. Gubbing anybody
5-0 can't be bad.
Get a life
UNCONFIRMED word has reached us that the good burghers of Greenock and Port
Glasgow have invented a new sport. Hamster fighting is sweeping the area, and
largish sums are reportedly changing hands over this mind-boggling exercise in
man's inhumanity to wee furry animals usually called Hammy.
Without wishing to condone this heinous practice, a few questions do arise,
such as; how does one excite a hamster to the level of slavering vicious
fighting beast? And how exciting are the lives of those who watch them? Any
further intelligence would be appreciated.
IAN BLACK
Sturdy McCulloch Shredder
THE ever-vigilant eye of the Diary may
just have solved the vexing question of exactly what the concert hall are going
to do with those embarrassing murals, by tenacious local artist Ian McCulloch,
which are still refusing to vanish and were last seen adorning the walls of the
Tramway, though they are not there now. Advertised in the Daily Telegraph last
week, for a very affordable #199.95, is a Sturdy McCulloch Shredder, whose end
product is ``a superb weed inhibiting mulch or excellent compost''. They could
add it to the rather larger heap of compost already written about the murals.

ECSTASY drugs victim Leah Betts lost her struggle for life yesterday - but her
death brought new hope to others through the gift of her organs.
Her distraught parents Paul and Janet Betts said: ``We are certain she would
have wanted this.'' The couple wanted to break the news of Leah's death
themselves.
She died four days after taking the rave drug at her 18th birthday party.
Mr Betts said: ``It gives us some comfort to know that her death in some way
may give life to others.''
Transplant operations are believed to have begun within hours of 18-year-old
Leah's life support machine being switched off at Broomfield Hospital,
Chelmsford, Essex, early yesterday morning.
The teenager's heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and corneas are likely to be used
to give new life to transplant patients. Mr Betts said it had always been
Leah's wish to donate her organs if she died.
``Leah's wish was that she should help others live in the event of her death. I
have respected that wish,'' Mr Betts said.
``This morning, her organs were donated and that should help six to seven
people to start a new life and possibly to see again.''
Leah had lain in a coma, sustained by a life-support machine, for four days
after she collapsed at the family home in Latchingdon, near Maldon, Essex, last
Sunday.
Mr Betts fought back tears as he said: ``One comforting thing is that she
probably died in my arms at her 18th party.''
At an emotional press conference, Mr Betts drew a deep breath and announced:
``Leah's ordeal is now over . . . it has been horrendous for us but the thought
of Leah living on to help others has made it that much more bearable.''
Mr Betts revealed his ``great anguish'' at the thought of surgeons cutting open
his daughter, even when she was dead, and he confessed: ``It frightens me.''
However, Mrs Betts, a nurse who advises young people against the dangers of
drug-taking, added: ``It gives me a peaceful feeling . . . she has given life
to six or seven people. It is comforting.''
She also made a moving appeal to other young people not to bow to peer pressure
to experiment with ecstasy, which has been the drugs phenomenon of the 1990s.
``This fashion must die like our daughter has died,'' she pleaded.
Mr Betts, a retired policeman, said he would treasure memories of his daughter
``from bouncing her on my knee to when she came running down the hall on
Saturday night dressed in her new outfit, saying, `how do I look?'
``She looked so beautiful. I have the same memories as any parent could have of
any child.''
Mr and Mrs Betts, together with Leah's three sisters and a brother, had
maintained a 24-hour bedside vigil.
Mr Betts praised staff at the hospital, describing those in the intensive care
unit as ``absolutely fantastic, so compassionate and caring'' and admitting
that without their support ``we would have crumpled long ago''.
``Also the transplant teams because that's a fear I had to overcome and they
again were very compassionate.''
Mr Betts also thanked members of the public for their support, delivered in the
form of letters, cards, telephone calls, rosaries, and prayers.
Mr Betts spoke of his anger towards those who peddled drugs and he called for a
radical review of the sentencing policy for drugs pushers.
``The hatred I have got is welling up inside me not only as a father but as an
ex-policeman.
``I do believe that if a sentence is passed it should be kept, instead of being
sentenced to five years and then you let them out after five months because
that is the biggest load of bull I have come across. What deterrent is that? It
killed my daughter and it is killing others.''
Six people were arrested yesterday in connection with the inquiry into the
supply of drugs to Leah. They were later released from custody.
A police spokesman said two of the six had been charged with intent to supply
drugs, although this was not connected to the Leah Betts incident. Another
youth was arrested last night and was being questioned by police.
Posters showing Leah in a coma will be handed out tonight at Raquel's
discotheque in Basildon, where Leah is thought to have bought the drug.

<TEXT>
A BODYBUILDER who admitted supplying an undercover detective with #100,000
worth of ecstasy tablets walked free yesterday after making Scottish legal
history by becoming the first person to successfully run a defence of police
entrapment.
The charge against 24-year-old amateur bodybuilder Steven Coan was found not
proven.
He had claimed that, in a police ``sting'' operation, detectives induced him to
commit a crime which otherwise he would not have committed.
Two of the men who sat in the dock of the High Court in Glasgow with Mr Coan
during the seven-day trial were found guilty of supplying 5000 ecstasy tablets
in the Marriott Hotel in July.
James Maclean, 20, unemployed, of Canada Court, Glasgow, and John McDonald, 26,
a joiner, of O'Neil Avenue, Bishopbriggs, were each sentenced to seven years. A
fourth accused, Brian Smith, 30, gas fitter, of Friendship Way, Renfrew, who
had the main charge dropped against him earlier in the trial, was jailed for
three months for possessing ecstasy. The sentence was backdated and he walked
free.
Releasing Mr Coan, of Brown Street, Anderston, Glasgow, the trial judge Lord
Weir told him: ``Fortunately for you, the jury has seen fit to acquit you.''
The court heard how the undercover police ``sting'' began when Edinburgh
bodybuilder, Mr Sandy Bryden, 40, was caught with a boot load of 38,000
Temazepam capsules after a cross-Border Scottish Crime Squad surveillance
operation.
Mr Bryden claimed in court he had been paid #500 by Mr Coan - a friend from
bodybuilding circles - to bring the capsules from Penrith to Glasgow, and that
he had done other runs in the past.
The court heard that, soon after Mr Bryden's arrest, police targeted Mr Coan.
Mr Bryden co-operated - in the hope things would go easier for him.
Undercover Scotland Yard detectives, experts in carrying out ``sting''
operations, were drafted in.
Their evidence made Scots legal history because, for the first time, they were
allowed to testify under assumed names and behind a screen.
In his evidence, Mr Bryden told how he introduced Coan to an undercover
detective called Robbie in an Edinburgh pub.
During that meeting, Mr Coan and Robbie, he alleged, discussed a big ecstasy
deal.
A series of other meetings followed in Glasgow's Marriott Hotel and Coan was
introduced by Robbie to two other undercover colleagues.
Mr Coan claimed the purpose of his meeting wasn't ecstasy but to get supplies
of anabolic steroids, which are legally used by bodybuilders throughout the UK.
Mr Coan told the court he thought ``Vic'' was a wealthy London club and gym
owner as well as being a major anabolic steroid supplier.
However, Mr Coan claimed, Vic asked him to get him ecstasy and hinted that the
anabolic steroid deal might not go ahead if he couldn't help him.

A 17-year-old schoolboy collapsed and later died while watching a rugby match
at Loretto School in Musselburgh, East Lothian, yesterday.
Pupils watched as staff and a doctor tried in vain to resuscitate John Kelsey,
a boarder at the school, before paramedics arrived. He was taken by ambulance
to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where he later died.
Headmaster Keith Budge said the boy's parents, who live near Aberdeen, had been
informed and were travelling to Edinburgh. He said John had been studying for
A-Levels, and that pupils and staff were ``in a state of shock''.
``Parents are being contacted to ask them to take their children home early for
the weekend,'' he added.
The public school's old boys include the late MP for Perth and Kinross, Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, and retired judge, Lord Allanbridge.

THE modern bakers - that is to say the large chain bakers - claim to bake bread
on the premises. In fact, and now you know, they don't. Some of them partially
bake, and some of them don't even bother with the subterfuge. What they do is
pipe chemically-induced scents redolent of childhood days before the Great War,
and pipe music evocative of it in their shops and sell you a pile of E-Number
glutens and tell you lies really. Well we all like to swallow a lie. Frankly
I'd rather swallow a wee mendacity than most of the bread I encounter but there
you are.
What I can't swallow though is the visual aesthetics of it all. Dear heavens I
remember the time when the bread was real and there was a wee rail for ladies
to put down their shopping bags, and the assistant behind the counter asked how
your man or weans were. Soda scones and flies' cemeteries. The sweetmeats might
not have been much but the nostalgia was grand.
A few years back I wrote about a bakery itself, an old and distinguished place,
Shorts of Shawlands. Claimed that their pies were easily the best in the world.
Round mutton pies with crusts on them which could have been moulded by
craftsmen from Church's Shoes, a spiced interior which would have demanded the
Crusades to get hold of the ingredients, enough grease to lard Gene Vincent's
bop for a year.
But the shop itself was splendid and gloriously old-fashioned in the way that
made you think the old-fashioned phrase ``old-fashioned'' had the imprimatur of
quality and class. Sadly Shorts was moved round the corner and I suspect, after
a recent visit, that the receipt for these pies has been changed to fit in with
the contemporary demand for food which tastes of toddlers training pants.
Invented smells and ersatz tastes, indeed manufactured sounds, are all very
well; I can cope with them. All I have to do is close my eyes to them. But
there comes a time when a sense cannot be treated in this way. The time has
come.
When I am cheated of my eyes I come to the edge of fury, teetering over the
volcano, looking into the bad fire of false consciousness. And this week saw
that. And involved every sense at that, including one of bewilderment. For it
was just the other day that madness took over in the matter of shops and sight,
and all the other senses too. Greengrocers.
Greengrocers are not usually thought of as romantic establishments but they
are, my dears, they are. Shops are. My old Grandma used to enliven our daily
trips to the shops in Stevenston, Ayrshire, with a History, Geography, and
Literature lesson in every one. The Post Office had stories of the glamour of
Rowland Hill and how William Makepeace Thackeray had laboured for about an hour
and a half a day in the then postal service.
Post offices in the early 1950s smelled of unwashed three-piece suits, Stafford
Cripps, and sealing wax. And now to cabbages and kings, but in a minute.
My Grandma was wont to explain that cloves came from Madagascar, ``an island
situated in......'' when I spied the jar of them in the local licensed grocers.
That Belfast ham actually originated in Ayrshire, and was sent back from
Ireland through a complex series of economic arrangements. Gigot was a Scotch
cut of mutton and the word came from the French language. Every shop had a
story.
Goddammit we used to go down to see Sannie Frew who owned the coal merchant's
and where my Grandma paid her quarterly bill and she was wont to tell me
stories of 35 miners buried alive and the funereal celebrations which ensued.
Every step of a shop had a tale to it.
And even greengrocers too. If butchers displayed their bloody wares and crusted
steak pies lined with elaborate frills of parsley, and fishmongers
ostentatiously showed their produce, dabs and flounders, shellfish, scuttling
lobsters - Glasgow's sawyers were wont to stick entire deer with antlers aloft
outside their doors - it was as nothing to the exotic colour of a greengrocers.
Outside in the street the greengrocers put out their wares. Boxes piled upon
each other of green cabbages, orange, well oranges, red apples, vivid tomatoes,
sedate beige mushrooms, potatoes looking like antique artefacts claimed from
some recondite archaeological dig, and today is even better.
The purples of aubergines, the wrinkled Corporation green of avocados, the
bright parrot flash of colour from green, red, yellow peppers, the comforting
sculptural shapes of fresh ginger root or the smooth suave pods like kiwi fruit
or Chinese gooseberries.
Red and purple plums, tumbling black and green grapes, spiky pineapples, the
curves of clumps of bananas. Here, we are going on a bit. But was it not a
bonnie picture, the panorama of fruit and veg, out in the street, like bright
umbrellas over cafe tables in a cobbled Paris street?
But was not a greengrocer finally told that he could no longer display his
produce out in the street? Derbyshire magistrates told the poor man that he
could no longer allow the populace to enjoy the burst of art and colour which
greengrocers everywhere have set before us since before the times of Nell
Gwynn. The magistrates said his show obstructed the pavement.
A TV crew came out to film this villain and discovered otherwise. They filmed
this hapless greencrocer's shop and it took seconds for the telly boys to
discover that not only could a double buggy get by this so-called obstruction
but, better still, they even managed to film a wee old lady in a wheelchair
buying her iceberg lettuce from the stall out in the street.
In short, our English greengrocer was giving more access to the disabled than
he would have done if he confined his sales technique to inside the shop. The
real disabled were the Derbyshire councillors who thought up how to blind
greengrocers, and citizens, to art and tradition at that.

A PORTUGUESE waiter who was jailed for five years after a bungled attempt to
rob a Scottish nightclub has been found hanged in a cell at Perth Prison.
A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death of Jorge Manuel Liandro,
from Manchester, whose body was found when cells were unlocked at 8.30am in the
prison's E Hall yesterday.
He was convicted at Aberdeen High Court in February last year on charges of
assault and attempted robbery and was serving a five-year sentence.
Last year, suicides in Scottish jails rose to 15, leading to a review of
suicide prevention strategy. The results of the inquiry, by Professor John
Gunn, of London University, one of the UK's leading forensic psychiatrists, are
expected to be published before the end of the year.
This year, the number of deaths in custody in Scottish prisons which are
possible suicides is said to be nine.
Liandro was sentenced after being found guilty of trying to rob Mr G's club in
Aberdeen. He was also convicted of assaulting Ms Myra Mackie, 60, a cashier, by
pointing a handgun at her, and at two men who chased him down the street.
His trial featured in a BBC documentary series The Trial, which showed him
being consulted by a solicitor and talking confidently about being cleared of
the offence.
Last week, police were called to Perth Prison twice within 24 hours after an
incident in C Hall when a 22-year-old inmate was stabbed.

INSURANCE broker CE.Heath hopes that the hive-off of its computer activities
will result in the new company having a stock market valuation of around #60m.
It is expected that the formalities will be completed in January with existing
Heath shareholders receiving shares in the computer company - which has still
to be named - some time in February.
That points to it being worth about 90p per existing Heath share which
yesterday dipped 5p to 163p.
Heath has bought the minority 30% stake in the Datasure subsidiary from fellow
broker Lowndes Lambert for #6.15m.
Disappointing half-time results were accompanied by a boardroom re-organisation
which sees chief executive for five years Peter Presland put in charge of
computer activities. He is succeeded by John Mackenzie Green who in recent
years has been on the international side.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September showed a 61% increase but that
was after a #3.89m gain on the sale of the 22% stake in Heath International
Holdings (HIH) of Australia to Winterthur. That carries a nasty sting in the
tail in that there is a capital-gains tax liability amounting to #8.8m on the
disposal which has had the effect of pushing Heath into a net after-tax loss of
#2.22m. That has helped prompt the decision to cut the interim dividend from 5p
to 3p.
The current half year will lack both the HIH contribution and six months of
computer profitability together worth about #5m. That points to full-year
profits of about #13m with the on-going insurance business running at an about
#7m annually. The decision on the final dividend will be made at the time of
the computer sell-off details.

``HOTEL'' was the name of the property game in Edinburgh yesterday as it was
annouced that two establishments have changed ownership.
Glasgow-based hotel and casino group Stakis announced that it would pay #2.9m
for the Clarendon Hotel, a 52-bedroom property located opposite the 136-bedroom
Stakis Edinburgh Grosvenor Hotel, near Hay-market.
Nearby in the New Town, businessman and hotelier Peter Taylor announced he was
purchasing The Howard from receiver Touche Ross for #1m. The four-star
establishment, which has been operating under receivership for four years, is
located on Great King Street.
Stakis took over the Clarendon yesterday, while Mr Taylor will take ownership
of The Howard on December 1.
A Stakis spokesman said the group intended to spend #500,000 upgrading the
Clarendon and restoring six extra bedrooms. He added that the hotel would be
closed for approximately two months early next year while renovations were
carried out.
The Clarendon will operate as an annex to Stakis' Grosvenor Hotel, although
exact details of how the two will function together have not been determined,
the spokesman said.
In addition to the two Haymarket properties, Stakis also owns the 134-bedroom
Edinburgh Airport Hotel, which opened in May.
The Glasgow-based group operates 18 hotels in Scotland and 24 in other parts of
the UK. It also runs 23 casinos and a combined hotel and casino in the Isle of
Man.
The new owner of the Howard said he intended to carry out renovations to the
small luxury hotel, but he was unsure what the total price tag would be.
He plans to revive refurbish parts of the interior, improve parking facilities
and develop the restaurant, bar and private function rooms.
Mr Taylor, who also owns the Channings Hotel in South Learmonth, said he had no
intention of adopting a ``group'' approach towards The Howard. The interior
refurbishment will be superficial - making a temporary closure unnecessary.
They will simply ``add the little touches that make the difference''.
Mr Taylor said an investment in the staff would also mark the difference
between The Howard and other hotels.
``Small, simple things have held them back from doing the best job they can
do,'' he said. Mr Taylor added he was interested in acquiring hotels in both
Glasgow and Aberdeen, but stressed he would make no purchases until
``absolutely perfect'' locations became available.
n NORTH British Trust Hotels is preparing to host a charity event in its
recently-refurbished Greens Hotel in Edinburgh.
Norris D Beith, chairman of North British Hotels Trust, will present almost
#25,000 in donations to four beneficiaries on Monday, November 27.
Renovations to the Greens Hotel were completed in May. The West End property,
formerly run as a budget hotel, was refurbished in a twenties style and
equipped with modern facilities and meeting rooms.
The #1.2m renovation was designed to attract business travellers.

<HEADLINE>New data encourages fresh hopes of an early cut in interest rates after the Budget October retail price index falls 0.5%</HEADLINE>

THE main measures of inflation all fell last month on the back of the biggest
decline in the retail price index for any October since 1944.
The unexpectedly good figures came the day after poor retail sales and
unemployment data hit sterling and were accompanied by a substantial surplus in
the public finances last month.
Once again the City concluded that the chances of an early cut in interest
rates had improved. The public borrowing figures improved the financial
background against which the Chancellor must make his Budget judgment in 11
days' time.
Rate speculation in the money markets drove share prices up to record-breaking
levels. The FTSE-100 share index jumped 39.4 points to 3610.8 as the Dow-Jones
index on Wall Street made further progress towards 5000. Footsie's previous
all-time high of 3598.0 and its record close of 3593.0 were set on October 18.
Sterling moved off the floor on the back of the news, and its trade weighted
index edged up from 82.6 to 82.7, but it remains very weak, largely because of
the mounting speculation about lower rates.
The retail price index fell by 0.5% to 149.8 (January 1987 = 100). As a result
the headline rate of inflation tumbled from 3.9% in September to 3.2%, a much
bigger drop than the City had been expected. The underlying rate, which
excludes mortgage interest payments, declined from 3.1% to 2.9% in
contradiction of a forecast in last week's Bank of England inflation report
that it would increase.
The RPIY measure, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England, retreated
from 2.6% to 2.4%. It excludes indirect and local authority taxes as well as
mortgage interest.
The headline rate benefited from cheaper mortgages, which knocked 0.2% off the
RPI, and a mortgage increase last year (also worth 0.2%) dropping out of the
annual calculation.
The big surprise was a 7.6% decline in seasonal food prices, which had risen
sharply in the summer because of the drought. This factor reduced retail prices
by 0.2%. Lower petrol prices and a fall in insurance premiums also benefited
the figures. Prices of clothing and footwear and household goods fell slightly.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ``Core inflation improved slightly in October and
shorter term measures suggest the peak may well be in sight.''
But he warned that if erratic items such as seasonal food were stripped out
there was little in the October figures to change the outlook for underlying
inflation.
``Equally there is nothing to preclude a near-term rate cut if the Chancellor
avoids a give-away Budget,'' he added.
Goldman Sachs's Martin Brookes said: ``Perhaps the main factor against a cut in
rates at the December 13 monthly monetary meeting is the renewed weakness in
sterling.''
But unless the pound declined significantly further there was a strong chance
of a base rate cut in the next few weeks, he added.
A big increase in corporation tax receipts enabled the public sector to repay
#1262m of debt against a repayment of #467m in the same month last year. In
addition September's borrowing was revised down by #400m to #3349m.
In the first seven months of the fiscal year the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement has totalled #18.8bn, little better than the #19.6bn at the same
stage last year.
However, privatisation proceeds are negligible this year, whereas last year
they amounted to #3800m in the first seven months.
Receipts picked up last month. In particular corporation tax contributed
#7315m, representing a 33% increase on the same month a year ago. October is
the second biggest month for corporation tax payments.
But there were also signs of a general pick up in revenues. In the first seven
months total tax receipts were up by 9.4%, stronger than in recent months, but
still below the 10.8% forecast in the Treasury's summer statement. With retail
sales in the doldrums the biggest shortfall is in Customs and Excise where
receipts are 6.6% higher against a forecast of 9.8%.
The belated improvement in revenues still leaves the Treasury's forecast of a
1995/6 PSBR of #23.6bn looking decidely optimistic. Both James Capel and
Goldman Sachs are forecasting a PSBR of #28bn, which will force the Chancellor
to finance tax cuts in his Budget from reductions in planned public spending.
The latter said last night that it expected tax cuts of around #5000m
``financed in large part by cuts in public spending plans''.

I HAVE no desire to get embroiled in what looks like another synthetic
Westminister slanging match between Ian Lang and Margaret Beckett over the
Minister's thoughts on job insecurity. But, away from yesterday's ritual party
point-scoring, the issue does actually matter to an awful lot of people.
It matters to the many who fear their jobs might be casualised or might not
exist this time next year. It matters because of the impact that sense of
unease has on the rest of their behaviour, as members of families, as
consumers, as citizens of a still-relatively-civilised society. And it matters
for the future effective functioning of the companies and organisations which,
in pursuit of competitiveness through cost cutting, have helped sow that sense
of insecurity in their own workforces.
Given his party's present standing in the polls, you might have thought the
President of the Board Trade would be feeling a shade uneasy about his own
long-term job prospects. But, on a visit to the CBI conference in Birmingham on
Tuesday - where he singularly failed to persuade the employers' organisation to
take the Tories' side in the forthcoming election - Mr Lang indulged in some
off-the-cuff asides to journalists about job insecurity being ``a state of
mind''.
Labour's roundhead Shadow pounced. ``Cavalier, insensitive,'' intoned Mrs
Beckett. ``It is profoundly offensive for a senior Minister to tell people job
insecurity is just in their minds. They know it is not true. It is a grim and
depressing reality.''
To be fair to Mr Lang, he actually said: ``Job insecurity does exist. What I am
saying is job insecurity is a state of mind.'' And, of course, he's right. Fear
of redundancy is a state of mind. A nagging, persistent worry that old
employment certainties have gone for good. It's not the physical fear triggered
by the sight of a redundancy notice with your name on it thrust into your hand.
Or the sick feeling in the pit of the stomach, the sense of utter rejection
felt by those confronted by the black bin bag on the desk and instructions to
be off the premises within the hour.
This is a sense of foreboding which haunts the inner self. Where else, than in
the mind, could anyone experience it? But, in what passes for political debate
in this country, saying: ``It's a state of mind'' translates into yesterday's
Mirror headline: ``It's all in your mind''. In other words, you are all deluded.
I don't know whether that's what the President of the Board of Trade intended.
But the phenomenon of job insecurity is no delusion. And, while it has been a
major factor in the reluctance of consumers to consume with any enthusiasm in
recent years, it is now becoming a matter of concern for more and more
employers, slowly but surely discovering that delayering, downsizing and all
the other euphemisms for cutting overheads by cutting jobs do not, all too
often, deliver the productivity and efficiency gains intended.
In the 1960s, more than 70% of the UK workforce was in permanent, full-time
employment. Now that percentage is down to 46% and falling. More and more of
the casualties of that process have ended up on the dole. In the past 30 years,
the base levels of claimant unemployment have climbed inexorably, from
1,000,000 in the 1970s, to 1,700,000 in the 1980s, to 2,200,000 in the 1990s.
Those not on the register and not in full-time jobs have either become
economically inactive, gone back into the expanded tertiary education system,
discovered an economic existence in the black economy, become self-employed or
signed up for the world of flexible (part-time, temporary) employment.
Despite some of the frothier hype about the enterprise culture, many of the
3,300,000 people now self-employed in the UK (the figure comes from the
Government's own Labour Force Survey) are not on the brink of building growth
businesses. They are, rather, self-employed contractors supplying their
personal skills on a freelance basis to a range of customers.
In some industries, like my own, there has always been a freelance tradition.
Elsewhere it is relatively new. The existence of self-employed journalists,
building workers, software engineers, designers, window cleaners and myriad
other trades has long brought a measure of flexibility to the labour market.
But now that concept has been taken much further. The flexible employed
workforce - 1,500,000 temporary workers, 4,600,000 permanent part-timers,
according to the latest LFS bulletin - has grown rapidly in recent years, as
more and more companies have sought to match the size and shape of their
payrolls to the variable demands from their customers.
If a manufacturer of consumer goods has to despatch two-thirds of annual orders
in the three months before Christmas or a retailer sells 70% of weekly takings
on a Saturday the implications for permanent nine-to-five jobs are patently
clear. The majority of part-time workers, according to the LFS, do not want a
full-time job and are happy to provide some of that flexibility. But business's
enthusiasm for labour flexibility has gone much further than that.
The fashion, in the past decade, has been to reduce core staff to a minimum and
outsource more and more functions, either to sub-contractors who are expected
to be equally flexible or to agencies which will come up with people, but only
when they are needed.
Employers searching for improved competitiveness want the flexibility to match
payroll costs to even unexpected ups and downs in demand. Hence the growth of
temporary employment contracts in industries like electronics. Some of the
assembly plants in Silicon Glen don't even employ many of their own shopfloor
workers. They contract that out to agency companies, whose main asset is a pool
of work-anywhere operatives.
There is nothing new in this. When I was growing up in Greenock in the fifties,
tradesmen in the local shipyards were paid off, Friday by Friday, as their work
on a particular vessel was completed. Off they went to find another ship, in
another yard, that needed their skills.
But it created a sense of insecurity then. And it does today. And, as
accumulating evidence from the United States shows, breaking traditional
employment bonds with employees may not result in the competitive gains
intended. Job insecurity may be in the mind. But it may also be taking its toll
in the office and on the shopfloor.

TWO major mortgage lenders yesterday cut interest rates on their fixed rate
loans. The Royal Bank of Scotland reduced the rates on its range of such loans
and on home improvement loans by up to 1.2%, while Alliance &amp; Leicester
Building Society said its rates on loans with one, two and five-....year fixes
were going down by up to 1%.
Other lenders said they were holding their rates, though Halifax commented that
it was monitoring the market and would respond if necessary and Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester indicated it would remain competitive.
The moves reflect strong competition in the mortgage market while house buying
remains depressed and the overall climate which is pointing to the next move in
rates in general being down.

I had occasion to use the so-called Super Loo at Glasgow Central station and I
was shocked.
At the time of opening some years ago it appeared to be at the cutting edge of
toilet technology. It has not maintained this position. Today it is far
inferior to the average lavatory in Glasgow's shopping malls and service areas.
Railtrack or the responsible concessionaire should take immediate action to
bring the place up to appropriate hygiene standards, or remove their entrance
charge.

<RECORDNO>975339687</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be foolish of me to refute the claim by my old newspaper colleague
John Burrowes that Glasgow still has a ``raw and real'' side to its character
but he knows just as well as I do that the kind of thing he and other novelists
write about Glasgow may easily be written about any major city in the world.
And not only cities. How many novels are written about leafy, rural towns and
villages in England, and Scotland, where mutilated bodies are found in the
shrubs, where sex and fraud scandals are the talk of village halls?
The sad truth is that sex and violence sell better than sweetness and light and
good deeds, which is why books, films, and plays about the former far outweigh
the other.
When I was the city's ``spin doctor'', a breed for which John Burrowes has such
contempt, I was interviewed by hundreds of news media people from every
continent and I told every one of them not to tell their readers, viewers, and
listeners that I had tried to pretend that Glasgow as some kind of paradise on
earth because, and I quote, it has all the ills of any other major city.
I did, however, ask them to tell about the good things the city had, too, the
kind of things that are never mentioned in the books of John Burrowes and Ron
McKay. Even in the days of Alexander McArthur and his No Mean City there were
efforts being made by many people to improve the city.
For decades there have been politicians, administrators, developers,
architects, builders, designers, organisers, heads of industry and commerce,
traders, artists, musicians, dreamers, people with ideas and no money, people
with money and no ideas but a willingness to back others, and people who just
wanted to get their names in the papers, all working to enhance the quality of
the city.
These people have no place in the novels of John Burrowes, Ron McKay, and James
Kelman.
Glasgow is a bubbling cauldron of endeavour, determination, enthusiasm,
self-interest, and arrogance and is a product  worth boasting about to the
world.
I don't want John Burrowes exterminated. I don't even want him to stop writing
sex and crime novels. I just want the world to know that not everyone in
Glasgow behaves in the way his characters do.
There is hardly anywhere in the world that has not benefited at one time or
another from the ingenuity, imagination, enterprise, skills, inventiveness,
clarity of thought, and genius of people born or trained in Glasgow.

A SENIOR Monklands District Council official yesterday told the
``jobs-for-the-boys'' inquiry how he became a member of the Labour Party at the
age of 56 - after taking up the Monklands post.
District building services director Ian McDonald, told William Nimmo Smith QC
that he joined the party last year - three years after moving from the private
sector.
However, Mr McDonald denied that party membership or being a relative of a
councillor was an advantage in getting a job or gaining promotion within the
DBS.
He admitted however that the green job application forms did indicate that the
candidate had the backing of a councillor.
The inquiry - now in its fourth day - has already heard that other coloured
forms were used to denote applications from outside and inside the council.
Mr McDonald said: ``I saw different coloured forms. Out of 1978 forms I
personally processed, the maximum I ever saw in terms of green forms was 10.''
Asked by Mr Nimmo-Smith if the green forms meant the candidate came on the
recommendation of a councillor, Mr McDonald said: ``One could construe that,
yes.''
Mr McDonald maintained he accepted responsibility for all appointments but took
no account of councillors' recommendations, or Labour Party membership.
Earlier, local Conservative party chairman Gordon Lind, one of the council's
chief critics, told Mr Nimmo-Smith that rumours over nepotism had persisted for
years.
Mr Lind had submitted unsigned letters he had received to the inquiry.
Mr Nimmo-Smith said he found the material ``repugnant'' and not worthy of
consideration. Mr Lind also told of his disappointment that one of his
``sources'' would not be giving evidence at the inquiry.
Asked about a specific case of nepotism, he said: ``I cannot speak of any
specific item in relation to that.''
Another witness, Ms Eileen McCauley, 34, a local newspaper reporter who was
first to report on the Monklands allegations, told Mr Nimmo-Smith that her then
employer, the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, had taken no specific
political line on the story.
Ms McCauley rebutted suggestions that the newspaper had carried the
``Monklandsgate'' stories to embarrass the late Labour leader John Smith, MP
for Monklands East in 1992.
Workers from the district building services department gave evidence to the
inquiry following claims that many got their jobs because they are members of
the Labour Party.
Mr Nimmo-Smith had said already that his own investigation uncovered only 10
party members from a workforce of 81 and seven of these had not been members
when they got their jobs.
Mr Raymond Queen, a glazier and a former member of the Labour Party, told the
inquiry he applied for his job after seeing it advertised in a newspaper. He
said that he believed he got the job on merit alone.
Witness Joseph McCaffery said he knew of no cases where there was any suspicion.

Supported by sticks and pride: the Queen Mother at a Remembrance service last
week.    Picture:  PA
THE Queen Mother was recuperating last night after a total hip replacement
operation.
As a steady stream of flowers from well-wishers arrived at King Edward VII's
Hospital for Officers in London, Buckingham Palace declared that she was
``making a good recovery''.
The one-and-a-half-hour private operation was ``completed successfully''
yesterday morning and the Queen Mother is expected to remain in hospital for
about two weeks.
At 95, the Queen Mother is one of the oldest patients in the world to have
undergone the operation.
While the procedure is now considered routine, and has a 95% success rate, the
surgery and anaesthetic pose greater risks the older the patient is. The Queen
Mother expects a longer-than-average recovery period.
The operation comes at the end of a year when, despite suffering evident pain
and discomfort from her hip and leg, the Queen Mother has taken a central role
in national commemorations of the Second World War.
Her simple but moving speech opening May's VE-Day anniversary celebrations
emphasised her continuing place at the heart of the nation's affections.
Although visibly unsteady on her feet and suffering from the heat, she insisted
on taking full part in the hour-long ceremony.
The next day, crowds sang Congratulations to her as she appeared on the
Buckingham Palace balcony.
The Queen Mother's health has been remarkably robust for much of her long life,
and she has never let the physical ailments which come with advancing age daunt
her spirit.
Despite several health scares and a number of operations, she has always
delighted millions by returning to official engagements and meeting the public,
displaying an energy which would be envied by many younger people.
Just four months ago, she underwent a successful operation at the same
hospital, to remove a cataract from her left eye.
In recent months, she has relied on a walking stick or wheelchair, even
appearing in a golf buggy, nicknamed the Queen Mum-Mobile.
At her last public appearance, the annual Field of Remembrance Service at
Westminster Abbey a week ago, she walked with difficulty, using two sticks, and
had to be helped by the Duke of York when her turn came to plant a wooden cross.
She was not present at the Cenotaph on Sunday for the Remembrance Day Service.
The hip replacement, performed by Mr Roger Vickers assisted by Mr William
Muirhead-Allwood, is performed successfully on around 50,000 elderly people
each year.
It involves sawing off the head of the thigh bone and removing the surface
layer of the hip socket.
A metal ball and polyethylene socket are then cemented into place to form an
artificial joint.
Usually patients stay two or three weeks in hospital, but it can take three
months before they can walk unassisted and six months to a year before they
make a full recovery.
Routine post-operative checks on the Queen Mother yesterday were a ``success'',
said Buckingham Palace, which will issue daily bulletins on her progress.
The team of doctors and surgeons are remaining at the hospital and are on hand
if required.
Mr David Murray, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Nuffield Orthopaedic
Centre, Oxford, said: ``The operation often has a dramatic effect. Patients can
be suffering severe pain beforehand and afterwards find the pain has completely
gone.''
Asked if performing the operation on a patient as old as the Queen Mother was
risky, Mr Murray said: ``There is a risk from the operation and the older the
patient the bigger the risk.''

THE announcement by Rupert Murdoch's News International that the Today
newspaper will cease publication has set the newspaper world buzzing.
In an industry that lives off gossip and scandal, the rumour mill was working
overtime last night in the watering holes of what used to be ``Fleet Street''.
The new ``street'' now covers an area from the Daily Mail's Kensington
stronghold in West London to Canary Wharf in the east.
The favourite version of anticipated events was that Mr Murdoch was preparing
to seek a 20% stake in the ailing Express group which would involve the closure
of the group's Daily Star and a shift of operations to News International's
Wapping HQ.
Such intricate manoeuvering would reduce the possibility of any problems with
the Mergers and Monopoly Commission and boost the Express, which would then be
edited by Richard Scott from Today and become a pro-Labour paper.
Who knows? There would appear to be some logic to such a scenario and stranger
things have happened in Fleet Street in the past.
Certainly the Express is struggling and persistent rumour has it that
celebrated composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber is also interested in mounting a
rescue bid together with Tony O'Reilly, owner of Ireland's Independent
Newspaper Group, who also has a 43% stake in The Independent and Independent on
Sunday.
The Independent, which lost its editor Ian Hargreaves earlier this week, is
also in dire financial straits and with more heads set to roll there are
serious doubts as to whether it can retain its reputation as a quality paper
and indeed survive at all.
The recession, escalating newsprint prices, and the price war instigated by
News International in the summer of 1993 and which Mr Murdoch is only now
easing up on, have all served to transform newspaper publishing from the one
time ``license to print money'' to a precarious business which latterly has
seen papers come and go and others switch ownership.
The recent sale of Thomson International's five Scottish titles - the Scotsman,
Edinburgh Evening News, Scotland on Sunday, the Aberdeen Press and Journal and
Evening Express are an indication of a growing realignment of the industry.
Ownership of the British newspaper industry has tended to become more and more
concentrated in recent years, with about eight groups dominating the national
newspaper market, most of which are also diversifying into the broadcast and
electronic media.
After the Scandinavians and the developed Far Eastern nations, the British
still buy and read more newspapers than most, but there has still been a slow
though steadily increasing decline in the total circulation of our national
newspapers.
However, that has been almost exclusively in the popular section of the market,
with quality newspapers tending to hold their own or show overall growth in
recent years.
News International, the UK arm of Mr Murdoch's News Corporation which includes
global broadcasting, film, and publishing interests, is the biggest player with
its UK titles including the Sun, News of the World, Times, and Sunday Times
aggregating about 37% of national daily newspaper circulation and a slightly
larger slice of the Sunday market.
The Mirror Group, with its Daily and Sunday Mirror, Daily Record, the People,
and a 43% stake in the Independent and Independent on Sunday, tends to produce
somewhere in the region of 24% of national daily newspaper circulation and
around 30% of the Sundays.
The other big groupings include United News and Media - owners of the Express,
Sunday Express, and Star - and the Daily Mail and General Trust with its Daily
Mail, Mail on Sunday, and London Evening Standard. Both also have extensive
regional newspaper operations, the Mail's latest acquisition being Aberdeen's
Press and Journal.
Other major players include Hollinger, which owns the Daily and Sunday
Telegraphs, the Guardian Media Group - which includes the Guardian, the
Observer, and the Manchester Evening News - and the Pearson Group, which
publishes the Financial Times.
More re-alignment would appear inevitable.

MORE than two million people have already contemplated the situation faced
yesterday by Leah Betts' father and stepmother and entered their names on the
computer register of organ donors set up one year ago.
The UK Transplant Support Services Authority in Bristol currently has 2.2
million names on the list, with a further 100,000 applications waiting to be
processed.
This is apart from the unknown thousands - possibly millions - who have the
traditional donor card. There are thousands issued every year but how that
corresponds to the number of card-carrying donors at any one time can only be
guessed at.
Ms Katharyn Burdon, the authority's administration manager, said yesterday:
``All we can say is that there is always a desperate shortage of organs for
transplantation and we would like people to think very carefully about it and
talk about it.''
Against this, there are nearly 6000 people in the UK waiting for organs of one
sort or another, with only 2009 transplanted last year.
``Not everyone who registers is going to become a donor - it is usually the
result of an accident or brain haemorrhage,'' said Ms Burdon.
Registrations are growing steadily but it goes in peaks and troughs - a
particular event like the Transplant Games which were held in the UK this year
generates interest, then it might dip until something else happens.
Donor cards are to continue meantime but the ultimate aim is to have all
prospective donors on the register.
The majority of patients who get transplants are kidney patients, largely
because they can be kept alive for years with dialysis. Medical science can't
buy as much time for patients who need a heart or a liver.
Forms to join the register can be obtained from main Post Offices, on new
driving licences, or when changing or registering with a doctor. There is also
a Freephone number, 0800 555777, through which forms can be requested.
As with the donor cards, the computer register will not over-ride the wishes of
relatives who do not want the organ to be transplanted. The registration forms
allow people to specify which organs they wish to donate.
The number of lives which can be saved when one person dies grows steadily.
Last year there were 1173 kidney, 18 combined kidney and pancreas, 201 heart,
43 heart-lung, 88 lung, 477 liver, and nine pancreas transplants.
As at 30 September, however, there were 5065 patients waiting for kidneys, 311
for hearts, 171 for heart-lungs, 197 for lungs only, and 139 for livers.

A PEP yielding 11.5% with the prospect of some capital growth sounds too good
to be true, yet this is precisely what is being offered by a new company,
Sovereign Debt Trust (SDT).
But before investors rush for their cheque books they should remember that
above average returns always mean above average risks - and this is the case
for SDT, which is sponsored by Greig Middleton.
SDT will be a kind of investment trust quoted in Dublin and will be launched
through an offer for subscription. As its name suggests it will invest in
government securities. This would normally be considered a safe investment but
in SDT's case it means securities issued by developing and emerging countries
with relatively poor credit ratings.
Half the portfolio will be invested in Brady Bonds, which were devised in 1989
by the then US Treasury Secretary James Brady to reduce the Third World debt
crisis. No country so far has defaulted on the Brady bonds it has issued. In
order to reduce risk the portfolio will be spread across 15 to 20 countries
Nevertheless the risk must be recognised, though it is arguably less than
investment in emerging-country equities. Should there be a downturn in world
trade then developing-country debt would tumble in value. In addition,
particular problems in a single country would unsettle the whole market. This
happened when Mexico had to be baled out by the US last year. So SDT is really
only of interest to larger investors, which is recognised in the #6000 minimum
investment.
The investment is PEPpable and dividends can be taken in cash or shares. Income
will be paid gross and if the share option is taken there is only liability for
capital gains tax          on disposal (for non PEP-investors). The gross
redemption yield is estimated at 14%.
The capital gain will come from a movement back towards par value by bonds as
they move towards maturity. Baring Asset Management will run the fund and it
believes that despite a recent recovery emerging country bonds are greatly
undervalued. The annual management charge is 0.95%.

Interim      1995       1994
Turnover #1104m #1137m
Pre-tax profits #133m #118m
EPS   13.4p 10.8p
Dividend 6.5p 5.0p
POWERGEN, the smaller of England and Wales' two electricity generators,
reported interim profits in line with City expectations at #133m before tax, an
increase of 13% on last year. Improved operating efficiency was the reason for
the improvment. Greater competition in its market meant its share slipped to
22.3% from 24.4%.
Commenting on the results, PowerGen's chairman, Sir Colin Southgate, said that
by any standards the financial performance in the first half had been very
strong and subject to unforeseen circumstances. ``Your directors expect 1995/96
to be another successful year for the company.''
PowerGen is awaiting Government clearance for its #1950m bid for Midlands
Electricity (MEB). The company sees no reason for a monopolies reference. Sir
Colin said this was because of the rapidly increasing competition in
generation, open and regulated access to the transmission network and
distribution networks, and the prospect of full nationwide competition in
supply. The de-regulated supply market in 1998 will also bring to an end the
main long-term deals between generators and regional electricity companies.
National Power, the biggest electricity generator, is also awaiting a decision
from the Government, expected next week, on its #2800m bid for Southern
Electric. PowerGen owns or has received acceptances for more than 70% of MEB.
The bid has been extended to November 24.
If the takeover is successful it is expected to boost PowerGen's earnings in
the current financial year. In addition, Sir Colin said it would position the
company for the full liberalisation of the electricity supply market in 1998.
and international markets.
Eastern Group, recently acquired by Hanson, has agreed to pay #450m for two of
PowerGen's power stations. The payments for a 99-year lease on the stations are
to be made annually over eight years and will be adjusted to reflect the actual
generation of the plant. The deal for the plants at High Marnham in
Nottinghamshire and Drakelow in Staffordshire is still subject to regulatory
approval.

<HEADLINE>A time for cool heads, judge advises jurors You are bound to feel the pressure, Mr Justice Mantell tells panel of seven men and four women</HEADLINE>

A JURY was yesterday advised that cool heads were required when the decision
was made on whether Rosemary West was guilty of murdering 10 young women and
girls.
No-one could pretend other than that the jury had a heavy responsibility, Mr
Justice Mantell told the seven men and four women as he began his summing up in
the seven-week trial.
The task was made all the more onerous because of the sensational nature of the
case and the considerable media interest surrounding it, he said. ``You are
bound to feel the pressure,'' the judge told the eleven jurors. A male juror
was excused earlier in the trial for an undisclosed reason.
Nevertheless, it was their duty to set aside any prejudice and preconceived
ideas.
He told the jurors they had to decide the case from what they had heard within
the courtroom and what they had seen during a visit to 25 Cromwell Street,
Gloucester. They should put out of their minds what they had read in
newspapers, heard on radio, or seen on television.
That, he said, would not be easy because the case had been reported extensively.
Mrs West pleads not guilty to 10 counts of murder, including that of her
daughter Heather, and stepdaughter Charmaine.
The judge said: ``Rosemary West is standing trial for murder. You are her
judges.''
He said it was his job simply to preside over the trial, tell them what the law
was, and remind them of the evidence.
On matters of law, they had to accept what he said and apply it. Each of the 10
charges of murder had to be considered separately, he told the jury.
It was suggested that the Wests had a system for enticing girls and young women
to 25 Cromwell Street so that they might be debauched and abused. If that
evidence was accepted by the jury, it would have a bearing on more than one of
the charges.
It was axiomatic of the English legal system that in a criminal charge the
prosecution must prove guilt. A defendant never had to prove his or her
innocence.
That was particularly important in a case such as the one being heard in Court
No 3 at Winchester where the defendant had given evidence and had called
evidence on her behalf.
The prosecution had to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt and that applied to
each and every charge.
Mr Justice Mantell said that in certain circumstances it need not be just the
person who had delivered the fatal blow who was guilty of murder. Where two
people acted together to commit the offence, each was guilty, he continued. He
gave the example that if Mrs West enticed a girl into a car so that she was
rendered helpless and sexually abused as a prelude to being killed, Mrs West
would be guilty of murder even though the victim might have been ``dispatched''
by Frederick West.
Every charge came with the alternative of manslaughter, Mr Justice Mantell told
the jury.
However, in this case, what he said about that was theoretical.
He told the jury they may think that the person responsible for what happened
to the bodies of these young women, ``either before or, one would like to
think, immediately after death'' must have had murder in mind.
The question for jurors was whether in each case it had been proved that Mrs
West participated in the killings and, if so, was it with intention to murder.
Alternatively, if not, was it such to satisfy a charge of manslaughter.
Mr Justice Mantell occasionally emphasised a point by looking towards the jury
and asking: ``Do you understand that, members of the jury.''
Almost in unison they nodded their heads.
The judge said that, during the trial, he and the jury had had the advantage of
experienced and able counsel and this had made their task much easier than
might have been the case.
There had been a total absence of rancour and ill-temper.
In addition, he and the jury had the privilege of listening to two excellent
speeches. Mr Brian Leveson QC, for the Crown, had been analytical.
For the defence, Mr Richard Ferguson QC, had used a broader brush. ``The
difference between a Canaletto and a Van Gogh, you may think.''
At one stage during his summing up, Mr Justice Mantell suggested that Rosemary
West's remains had been recovered from Letter Box field.
Mr Leveson suggested that the judge had meant to say Rena West.
``What did I say?'' Mr Justice Mantell asked.
``Rosemary West, your lordship,'' said the Crown counsel.
The judge turned to a screen and declared: ``You are absolutely right - one of
the advantages of the computer.''
In the course of a review of the evidence, the judge said a key witness, Mrs
Janet Leach, who had been a confidante of Frederick West during several months
of police interviews, had been less than frank with them.
``Let's not mince words,'' he said. ``She lied to you.''
During her evidence, she had denied reaching agreement with the media over
money for her story. However, did that mean that her evidence about what Fred
West had said to her was not to be believed.
The judge also referred to the evidence of Mr West's daughter, Mrs Anne Marie
Davis. As with every other witness, they would have to consider whether or not
she was telling the truth.
Apologising to the jury, the judge said they would have to consider not only
the murders but the dissection of the bodies.
``You have to imagine cutting out kneecaps. . . a single rib. . . a collarbone.
. . fingers and toes, easier, perhaps,'' he said.
The Crown asked how could Mrs West have lived in the same house and not have
known.
Equally, Mr Ferguson, for the defence, could ask how could Anne Marie live in
the same house and not know, the judge said.
Mr Justice Mantell will continue his summing up today. The jury will retire to
consider verdicts on Monday.

SCOTLAND'S salmon farming industry now faces its biggest threat ever because of
UK Government intransigence.
The industry has for over four years advocated the establishment of producer
organisations in Norway, Scotland, and Ireland with full power to control the
number of young salmon put to sea matching supply with an anticipated demand.
This practical solution is provided for under the Common Fisheries Policy of
the European Union.
The present collapse of the market (reported on November 10) was as predictable
as it was inevitable. The huge increases of smolts to sea by Norway in 1994
guaranteed a glut by November 1995. Norway has now over 50,000 tons of salmon
for which there is no market and prices are at their lowest ever. There is
worse to come. Next year's Norwegian crop is bigger still - estimated at
390,000 tons against 260,000 this year.
The industry has warned the Scottish Office repeatedly for five years of the
inevitable market collapse which must follow massive over-supply, exactly as
happend in 1989-1992. It's first-year economics.
The new Minister, Raymond Robertson, like his predecessors, opposes the
measures necessary to stabilise the industry in the longer term. He speaks only
of short-term measures that in no way address the central problem of recurring
over-supply.
As a result he will bear responsibility for the issue of P45s to many of the
2500 men and women in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland working in the most
remote and vulnerable places, as well as the loss of the 5000 or more
additional jobs dependent on them.
There can be no more stark example of mis-government from London than the
persistent refusal of Scottish Office Ministers and Whitehall mandarins to heed
expert advice from the salmon farming industry. Any Scottish government would
do better.

EXCLUSIVE
BREAST cancer screening and treatment is failing women because it arrives too
late and does not address the nature of the disease, it was claimed last night.
Professor Hugh Simpson, head of Glasgow University's pathology department, said
the whole approach of detecting and removing lumps had progressed little in the
last 150 years.
Delivering the prestigious Sir James Young Simpson memorial lecture at the
Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, his distant kinsman appealed for
support for a new test for much earlier detection of the pre-cancerous
condition.
Professor Simpson said three out four women died within 10 years of diagnosis
of breast cancer in the UK. Those who survived treatment carried a 50% chance
of further cancer, six times the normal risk.
``There is widespread dismay and worry among women about the prevalence and
danger of breast cancer,'' he said.
``In essence, treating lumps is shutting the stable door after the horse has
bolted.
``Cancer does not grow in a normal breast and the other breast is not normal
either. The lump is the tip of iceberg. Breast cancer is just an isolated
effect in a diseased breast.''
He said that, although it may be too early to draw final conclusions, four
controlled trials had failed to show a significant reduction in mortality
between those who had undergone screening by mammography and those who had not.
Nor was mammography offered to women under 50, a group which accounted for one
third of breast cancer cases.
``What I am suggesting is a completely new test. In a way, it is a revolution.
There is particular room for improvement in the under-50s, for which there is
no early diagnosis,'' he said.
The test works on the principle that cancer almost invariably develops in and
around the milk ducts. Women undergo a rehearsal for lactation every month when
blood flow increases in the breasts.
Pre-cancerous abnormalities can be shown using a special heat-sensitive bra and
the equipment has already been tested by researchers in Glasgow and Manchester.
Those identified at risk can then be offered a range of treatment. Where
appropriate, they would be asked to lose weight, change diet by eating
oestrogen-blocking soya products associated with Japan and China, where breast
cancer rates were one sixth of the West, take Tamoxifen, the standard
anti-oestrogen drug, or even undergo preventive surgery.
Professor Simpson presented earlier findings to President Clinton's special
commission on breast cancer in America two years ago.
Addressing a distinguished body of surgeons last night marks a further degree
of acceptance of his theory.
He has also been invited to set up an international trial by the European
Institute of Cancer but so far has been unable to secure the necessary #100,000
funding.
``It is very controversial stuff but I think I am right. My main point is that
the people who have been critical have not examined the data,'' Professor
Simpson said.

JOHN Foster (November 15) completely misses the point with regard to the
proposed launch of the Socialist Labour Party.
This party will have the potential to attract thousands of youth, animal
rightists, motorway protesters, nuclear disarmers, etc, who would have no truck
with Blairism. It would also have the potential to re-politicise many of my
(and John Foster's) generation who have become disillusioned and have dropped
out of politics.
Such developments would strengthen, not weaken, the positon of those who prefer
to remain within the (New) Labour Party and fight from within. Decades of
Stalinist dogmatism have blinded John Foster to this possibility.

A MAJOR heart operation was postponed this week at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary
because of pressures created by ``peaks'' of activity in the NHS trust
hospital's intensive care unit.
On a number of occasions last year, a similar situation arose when the flagship
hospital had peaks in demand.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the hospital confirmed it was in discussion with
Grampian Health Board in an effort to secure more funding to help cope with the
unit's problems.
``Obviously, we have to balance our resources,'' he said. ``You cannot always
have places for the worst possible peak. Grampian is the only rising population
in Scotland.
``We have a vast geographical area to look after, we have mountains which
attract both hill walkers and skiers. We have the offshore industry based in
Aberdeen, we have the biggest fishing industry in Europe based in Aberdeen, and
we have a lot of potential danger. These things put pressure on us.''
He added: ``We obviously cannot have a massive department with everyone
standing around just in case but at times we will have a peak of activity when
we will be overstretched.''
He said also that the unit's high-technology equipment meant that staff could
not be temporarily transfered, as in other wards.
The unit caters for 12 people, with four beds for cardiac surgery and eight for
general intensive care. The patient whose surgery was cancelled would probably
have the operation within a day or two.
Dr John Herne, medical director of Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust, said the
unit was ``more than full'' and this created problems, particularly with
elective surgery.
``I am sure any delay is an emotional burden on a patient,'' he said. ``In an
ideal world, it would not happen. However, we do not live in an ideal world but
one in which some compromises have to be made.
``If more money could be found to run this service it would make life easier
but the same is true in all parts of the health service,'' he said.
A health board spokesman said: ``We recognise the intensive care unit, like
other facilities, has to respond to peaks in demand. The continuing pattern of
use of intensive care unit beds is therefore kept under close review by the
board.''

SHARES of Conrad Black's Telegraph group firmed 19p to 428p yesterday, helped
by cover price increases at Rupert Murdoch's Times, signalling what could be
the beginning of the end of the damaging newspaper cover price wars.
The buoyant share performance came despite a fall in Telegraph group profits
from #33.9m to #25.6m before tax in the nine months to September as the soaring
cost of newsprint offset extra revenue from the 5p rise in cover price to 35p
on July 3.
The third quarter did move into the black at the operating level after a loss
last year. But for the full nine months, after stripping out a one-off
first-half #7.5m contribution from the sale of the group's stake in Carlton
Communications, profits tumbled even further to #18.1m, of which almost #17m
(against #19.3m last time) came from interest in associated companies including
the 25%-owned Australian Fairfax operation.
On the plus side, though, the newspaper price wars, already cooled off, now
look to be coming to an end with the Times due to lift its price 5p in an
attempt to restore profitability.
It is not so much the price competition but newsprint and other costs which are
forcing a change of tactics by the news-paper magnates. Competition, though,
remains intense and the Telegraph group says it is committed to taking all
action necessary to protect its market leadership.
For the third quarter alone, operating profits were #500m compared with a loss
of #2.6m for the same period last year. This was despite a 30% rise in the cost
of newsprint on July 1.
Looking ahead to next year, although profit will be affected by rising
newsprint prices worldwide, the group says it is confident of maintaining the
circulation strength of its titles and of a steady growth in advertising in a
continuing competitive business environment.
Newspaper advertising revenue over the quarter rose 7% against the same period
last year. Classified remained strong, showing an 18% increase year-on-year.
However, financial and display advertising continued to perform disappointingly
with little change over the year.
The 12% decline in income from associated companies was largely due to the
weakness in the Australian economy coupled with increases in newsprint costs
both there and in Canada. The Telegraph also took a loss of around #900,000
from its share of asset disposals in Canada.
Circulation has stood up well. Average circulation for the Daily Telegraph in
the six months to September was 1,064,717, an increase of some 25,000 over the
same period last year and around 400,000 more than its nearest rival. In the
same period average circulation of the Sunday Telegraph was 696,964 though the
ending of the weekend voucher did have an adverse impact on sales, which dipped
to 673,540, still an increase of 11% over April 1994, the month before the
weekend voucher promotion was introduced.
With the appointment of Charles Moore as editor of the Daily Telegraph,
following the departure of Max Hastings to the London Evening Standard, and
Dominic Lawson's move from the Spectator to edit the Sunday Telegraph, there
will be a degree of rationalisation and attendant costs. The Telegraph group
reckons there are a few cost-savings still to be achieved but these will not
fully absorb the impact of further newsprint price increases expected in 1996.
But although the third quarter has been ``erratic'' in certain advertising
markets, there is some optimism, says the company, for the last quarter's peak
advertising months of October and November and newspaper advertising revenue is
expected to continue to outperform 1994.
q PROFITS of the Fairfax newspaper group in Australia, which includes the
Sydney Morning Herald, suffered from the upsurge in global newsprint prices,
falling a worse-than-expected 21% to A$33.8m net. Many analysts had been
expecting a drop in the region of 9%.
``The result reflects the impact of declining economic activity in Australia
and tougher trading conditions, combined with a very substantial rise in
newsprint costs.'' The price of newsprint jumped by 22% in the quarter.

Clarke will, over the next few days, now concoct a Budget which will be
``prudent'' in terms of fiscal strategy and advantageous to the Government in
the run-up to the next General Election.
The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in the first seven months of this
financial year was #4500m down on this time last year.
This is a vital figure for the nation's economic health and the Government's
survival over the next 12 months.
Mr Major can now truly ``smoke out'' the Labour Party on its economic strategy
in a way that this week's Queen's Speech legislation programme of 16 Bills
failed to do.
The good economic figures were unexpected by the City and, indeed, by Tory MPs
at Westminster. Mr Major, on this basis, can now demand total loyalty from his
back benchers on all issues that come before them in the legislative programme
for the next 12 months.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor quickly had another private meeting about
the Budget strategy which is part of what the Tories might call their ``autumn
offensive'' against Mr Blair.
This was in danger of foundering until yesterday's economic figures. The
pressure will now fall on Mr Blair on November 28 when he has to respond to the
Budget statement in the Commons to produce a credible alternative economic
strategy.
THE Chancellor's Budget statement in 12 days' time was transformed yesterday by
a sparkling combination of economic figures.
Government borrowing is less than expected and the inflation rate is under
control. On November 28, this will give Kenneth Clarke scope for ``prudent''
tax cuts that will meet with the approval of the international markets.
The relief of Cabinet Ministers was obvious at Westminster. They now believe
that they have a serious opportunity to regain the initiative from Labour
leader Tony Blair, who is showing an unprecedented 40% lead over Mr Major in
public opinion polls.
The Cabinet now believes Mr Clarke can safely deliver about #3000m in tax cuts.
The inflation rate fell to 3.2% - the biggest October drop for 50 years. The
underlying rate, which excludes mortgage payments, fell too, from 3.1% to 2.9%.
Tory back benchers met for only five minutes at their weekly political meeting.
Afterwards those few who felt it necessary to attend were saying that this
could be the real turning point for the Government.
The pound recovered and shares went up - precisely the situation that the
Chancellor needs as a warm-up to his Budget statement.
A fall in interest rates is now a serious possibility before Christmas, to
encourage signs of a rebirth in High Street sales and to encourage consumer
confidence.
The key factor is the Government's borrowing requirement, which is also reduced
in yesterday's figures.
This combination provides the opportunity for which the Cabinet has been
waiting. They see a package capable of bringing back erstwhile Tory voters.
The Prime Minister and Mr

Safety first: Stephanie Hopkins, of Glenrothes, celebrated her third birthday
yesterday by becoming the first member of the Children's Traffic Club.
Stephanie, who met Police Inspector Alan McIlvarie, was taken to Fife Police
Headquarters at Dysart, near Kirkcaldy, in a police traffic car, where she was
presented with a special birthday card and pack from the traffic club by the
force. Organisers estimate that half of all three-year-olds in Scotland will
join the club, giving an estimated membership of 30,000 in its first year.

FEARS were growing last night for an Irish fishing vessel missing with six men
on board.
A search involving three Nimrods from RAF Kinloss and several lifeboats was
called off last night and was resumed at first light this morning.
The 70ft Carrick Active, from Greencastle, had been fishing off Donegal when
she went missing. Coastguards did not pick up any distress signals.
The Irish authorities alerted Clyde coastguard at midnight on Wednesday and
yesterday the Nimrods were joined in a search of the gale-swept seas by four
helicopters and three lifeboats. A Royal Navy helicopter was on standby at
Prestwick.

GLASGOW Income Trust provided a strong yield in the year to September 30, but
lagged behind the FTSE All-Share Index in total returns.
Gross dividend yield was 7.7%, beating a yield of 4.4% in the All-Share and
enabling the trust to reach its target of outperforming the index by 75%.
On the other hand, total returns on income and capital amounted to only 15.6%,
failing to keep pace with a 19.8% total return on the All-Share Index.
Net asset value rose 8% to 48.85p per share, while earnings per share to 3.06p.
A final dividend of 1p pushes the full-year payout to 2.8p.
Fund manager David Williams said a simple comparison between Glasgow Income
Trust investment returns and the All-Share returns was misleading - like
comparing ``apples and lemons''.
For instance, he noted that Convertible shares represent 27.4% of Glasgow
Income Trust's total assets, but are not represented in the All-Share Index.
The trust's total returns compare favourably with a more representative
benchmark consisting of a combination of the TOPSI-100 index of high-yielding
ordinary shares and the COSI-80 index of convertible securities, he said.
The trust's 15.6% total return was 0.6% higher than the return of this
composite index.

AN elegiac walk through Tuscany. The season salutes the long decline of the
Italian summer in the colours of Tuscan clay, in brilliant versions of burnt
sienna and yellow ochre. The landscape of Ghirlandaio threads its vineyards and
olive groves through rich oakwoods, and we follow the ways of hunter-gatherers
as well as farmers.
The hills which in June are sunny with wheat and sunflowers are stripped to
their soil. In small, quiet ways farmers and their wives are shutting down the
land for the winter; beneath a hilltop hamlet a man rebinds his vine branches,
a woman with a sickle feeds a bonfire of dessicated maize stalks.
We are walking from the Etruscan redoubt of Volterra, a thrilling town on a
crag over 2000ft high, to the medieval masterpiece of Siena, about 45 miles
away. We walk alone; this is a journey for anti-social ramblers. We have no
guide, only the meticulously explicit route instructions of our tour operator,
Sherpa Expeditions, and some less than useful maps.
We don't walk the whole distance, but get a little help from local buses. The
country bus network has a wide and inexpensive remit.
An elegiac bus ride through Tuscany. As the APT coach potters peacefully from
one village to the next, we mourn the lost fortunes of our own rural bus
system. The journey is almost voluptuously nostalgic. The driver and his
regulars exchange friendly words and when we reach the precipitous suburbs of
Volterra there's a sudden flurry of custom. Three very old, very stiff couples
haul themselves on board for the stage to the town centre.
When we reach the Piazza XX Settembre the reason for their short journey
becomes clear: here, at a heavenly bus terminus overhanging medieval ramparts
and Etruscan gate, the elderly of Volterra take centre stage at its nightly
passeggiatta.
An elegiac stroll through the church of San Francesco. I get up early to
explore alone and, as the sun rises, find the open door of another church. It
holds the silence of six centuries, its treasures are unguarded.
Three days and two nights later, catching up with our luggage in friendly
hotels in San Gimignano and Colle Val d'Elsa, we break out of the oakwoods of
our final route and see on the horizon the great spear of the Torre del Mangia
and the bell-tower of Siena's cathedral.
The breath quickens. Between the rock of Volterra and the crowned hill of Siena
lies a landscape barely altered since medieval travellers lifted their eyes to
the same views and, like us, propelled themselves across it by their own
energy. The distances walked have not been great - about eight or nine miles a
day - but like hills the world over the Tuscan hills go up and down, and we're
quite happy to surrender the last lap to another local bus, as recommended.
The bus breasts a hill and the valley below delivers a peculiar shock: the
autostrada between Siena and Florence. Deep in our civilised wilderness of farm
tracks and forest paths and quiet country roads we have almost forgotten the
existence of motorways and their cargo of noise and speed.
But we enter a town which has most triumphantly banished the motor car from its
centro historico - the town which became a model for other Italian cities, and
which should be a model for ours. Siena showed it could be done. In the land of
the three-car family it prised its citizens from their steering wheels and
returned them to their feet; and now they drift contentedly through its
gorgeous brick-and-stone channels, rivers of pedestrians flowing into the
exquisite shell-shaped declavity of the Piazza del Campo.
An elegiac moment in the candystripe Duomo, where a little poem explains why so
many sceptical, Kirk-raised Protestants feel moved to light candles in Catholic
churches. It reads better in Italian, but my linguistically-gifted
sister-in-law provided this translation:
I don't know how to pray.
I don't know what to say.
I don't have much time.
Well then?
This light which I offer is a piece of my love,
a piece of my time, a piece of myself.
This light which shines will be my prayer,
which I will continue though I leave this place.
I light a candle in Siena's cathedral, one of many on my walk through Tuscany.
They were all dedicated to my mother, who died this month after a long twilight
of illness, and who was loved as much as any mother could be. She was in my
thoughts, or just behind them, every step of the way.

LORD Young, executive chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, whose leadership of the
company has come under increasing criticism, has defiantly stated that he
intends to leave the international telecoms group, 80% owner of BT rival
Mercury, on his 65th birthday on February 27, 1997, writes CHRIS STONE.
He said in a statement that he was announcing the decision now ``in order to
end the recent ill-informed and destabilising comment and to put the record
straight.''
There has been increasing speculation that Lord Young was under pressure to
resign, a suggestion he recently described as ``absolute balderdash''.
Yesterday he unveiled a 9% increase in half-year profits ahead of exceptionals
from #567m to #616m on turnover up 7% at #2711m. Matching the profit advance,
shareholders are to receive a 9% boost in the interim dividend from 2.83p to
3.08p on earnings per share also up 9% ahead of exceptional profits at 13p.
Criticism of the company has centred on what has been perceived as its lack of
strategy but Lord Young commented: ``Progress continues to be made on all
fronts with financial performance our management focus on delivering consistent
and superior earnings growth.''
At home, Mercury increased turnover by 5% to #833m and operating profit
increased by 7% to #103m, reflecting the impact of reorganisation of the
business. Mercury revenues incorporate a 12% increase in switched minutes and
customer line growth of 38% partially offset by tariff reductions.

LABOUR yesterday demanded an apology from Board of Trade President Ian Lang
after he described job insecurity as ``a state of mind''.
Shadow Trade Secretary Margaret Beckett said Mr Lang's comments were
``profoundly offensive'' to the millions of people who had real cause to fear
for their livelihoods.
However, Mr Lang said later that Labour was taking the remarks - made on
Tuesday during a news briefing at the CBI conference - ``completely out of
context.''
Mrs Beckett produced figures showing that 8.5 million people had experienced at
least one spell of unemployment since the Tories were re-elected in 1992.
``For all these people job insecurity is not just a state of mind, as Mr Lang
claimed. It is a grim and depressing reality,'' Mrs Beckett she said.
``Mr Lang should either apologise or he should resign.''
Mr Lang's comment previously had gone largely unremarked. He had told
journalists in response to their questions: ``Job insecurity does exist. What I
am saying is that job insecurity is a state of mind.''
A DTI spokesman said that Mr Lang was making the point that with unemployment
falling over the last year and 500,000 new jobs created since the recession,
the overall employment situation was not as bad as some people believed.
Mr Lang, on an official visit to Germany with the Prince of Wales, later issued
a statement strongly denying Labour's interpretation of his remarks.
``This is Labour playing politics again, taking a statement completely out of
context,'' he said.
``There is a serious issue to be addressed and that is how we create more jobs
in this country. That is the best way to deliver greater job security.''

<TEXT>
LABOUR last night urged Defence Secretary Michael Portillo to look into
allegations that the black wife of a British soldier was subjected to racial
abuse at a barracks social evening.
The alleged incident is being investigated by military authorities.
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark outlined details of the case as he
wound up for Labour on the second day's debate on the Queen's Speech.
Dr Clark said two black women, one of them married to a soldier posted
elsewhere, attended a social event on August 10 at Oakington Barracks,
Cambridge.
``The women were subjected to racial abuse, which included persistent chants of
`nigger, nigger, nigger'.
``At a later stage in the evening, the soldier who had been perpetrating most
of the abuse had disappeared, and he came back with four other soldiers,
witnesses allege, and subjected the women to further abuse, such as: `You
niggers are only good for swinging from trees and burning, if I had my way I
would get a white hood.'''
Dr Clark said he would not subject MPs to further examples of the taunts.
``The House will share my anger and concern. But to make it worse, as the two
women were leaving, two of the soldiers pointed guns at the by now petrified
women.
``I will say no more. I understand this is an exception. But plainly, such
occurrences have no place in our civil society, nor any place at all in the
British armed forces.
``Events such as this really must be stamped out.''
When he replied to he debate later, Mr Portillo did not respond on the case.

CHEMICALS used in making men's trousers were thought yesterday to be the
initial cause of health complaints which made workers vacate the Daks-Simpson
factory at Polbeth, West Lothian, this week.
As the 365 workers returned to their jobs after a two-day stoppage, a Health
and Safety Executive spokesman said investigations had shown the likeliest
reason for skin rashes and nausea, experienced by some, was surface irritants
in the fabrics.
These were chemicals used to reduce creasing and retard fire. Guidance had been
given to the company.
HSE officials were carrying out further work to see if the irritants could be
reduced but it agreed there was no serious health risk.
The spokesman said it was believed the chemicals had triggered the trouble
although other factors, such as outside ailments and anxiety, could then have
developed.
Yesterday, a statement from Daks-Simpson at Larkhall, Lanarkshire - which
experienced a similar incident last week - said workers had been told tests had
been carried out and nothing had been found to cause concern.
The Polbeth factory had been cleaned thoroughly throughout Wednesday and
over-night, and the employees were advised they could return safely.
Mr Kevin Johnson, managing director, said: ``Hopefully, the matter is now
behind Daks-Simpson in Scotland and we are all looking forward to getting back
to normal.''

IN the early Sixties it seemed incredible that Erik Carlsson and his two-stroke
Saab could win the RAC Rally three times in a row, and the Monte Carlo twice.
Handicaps and overall places decided on class performance were being phased
out, and the RAC Rallies of 1961 and 1962 were scratch events, decided on
flat-out forest stages.
Carlsson won going away from the field. And yet his 841cc Saab 96 peaked at
something like 75bhp, compared with the 210bhp of the Austin-Healey 3000s which
had almost three and a half times its engine capacity. Brilliant driving was
the major element in Carlsson's victories, but the two-stroke Saab was a car to
marvel at.
The most accomplished driver of a similar car in Britain was Alastair
Robertson, who prepared one for rallies in 1967. He placed it in the top three
of the Scottish championship and regularly outpaced the opposition in the
Saab's capacity class.
The Saab was usually thought of as a forest or winter rally car, but Alastair
Robertson was also an ace on smoother surfaces, as he showed on the all-tarmac
Circuit of Ireland, when he managed to wear the rear tyres of this front-wheel
drive car completely bald!
He recalls that the 96 may have been short of power on the climbs, but it could
be driven absolutely flat-out downhill. The Scandinavians who gave the Saab its
rally baptism devised the technique of left-foot braking.
Some of us think we remember the little two-stroke engine screaming to nearly
9000rpm. In fact, it would hit six-five or seven, and the characteristic
``whoop'' as it revved up was caused by the opened-up air cleaner on the
competition cars.
After the two-stroke went out of production, Alastair Robertson moved on to
rallying a Saab V4. Ten years later, his two-stroke was found languishing in
Dundee, and he bought it back.
He rebuilt it as a Monte Carlo model, and put in one final nostalgic entry for
the Trossachs Rally in 1979. Then it retired. However, if a suitable historic
rally turned up, with forest stages, he might be tempted to put its competition
numbers on again. He would never say so himself, but that would be something to
behold - a classic rally car of the Sixties with a genuine expert back at the
wheel.

THERE has been a sea change in the attitude of the business community towards
home rule, according to a survey to be published next week by the Scottish
Chambers of Commerce.
The results of the survey of more than 3000 firms will be a body blow to the
fierce campaign against constitutional change being waged by Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth.
Business and commerce traditionally has been seen as hostile to the idea of a
Scottish parliament, but the acting director general of Scottish Chambers, Mr
Peter Dunn, indicated that there had been a shift in attitudes.
``The result of this survey will shake the very foundations of current thinking
on the devolution issue,'' he said, adding: ``There has been an immense change
in the last two or three years''.
This shift comes as Mr Forsyth looks at ways of undermining the demand for
change. He will deliver a lecture on St Andrew's Day, the same day that the
Scottish Constitutional Convention stages the formal launch of its proposals
for a 129-member Parliament.
Ironically, the Scottish Secretary's anti-Labour message will come in a lecture
commemorating one of the party's great stalwarts, former Strathclyde Regional
Council leader Dick Stewart.
The Scottish Local Authorities Management Centre at Strathclyde University
organises the lecture and this year it invited Mr Forsyth to speak, and he
chose the date to coincide with the Convention's big day.
Privately, senior Labour figures are furious at such a propaganda coup being
handed to the Scottish Secretary. ``Dick will be birling in his grave,'' one
source said.
Now Mr Forsyth will have to contend with the evidence that business people are
warming to the idea of devolution. The survey was carried out on behalf of the
Scottish Chambers and law firm Maclay Murray &amp; Spens by the Fraser of Allander
Institute at Strathclyde University.
The Scottish Chambers last carried out a survey in 1991 and at that time 67%
supported no constitutional change, with only 28% opting for a Scottish
parliament. This will provide a benchmark for the latest findings.
Mr Dunn called the results ``dynamite'' and said that personally he was not
afraid of devolution because he had spent recent months educating himself about
the issue. He said of the survey: ``This will stimulate the business community
into a full and frank discusion on the implications of devolution for Scotland.
It is time to talk.''
The survey asked how proposed changes compared with the status quo, citing as
four possibilities - decentralisation of decision making; a devolved
legislature without taxation powers; a devolved legislature including tax
powers; and independence.
The firms were asked whether change would make the business environment better
or worse, or leave it unchanged. The questions were also couched in terms of
short-term and long-term impact, and their effect on operating costs, turnover
and growth.
The results will be released in Glasgow next Tuesday and the indications are
that they will be encouraging for the Labour and Liberal Democrat Convention
partners.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ``Scottish business is now
more and more coming round to the idea of a Scottish parliament, despite the
most hysterical and vitriolic anti-devolution campaign ever mounted by the
Tories.
``Clearly Scottish business doesn't buy the Tory propaganda. Neither should the
rest of the Scottish people. The power to get our economy working means getting
the lifeblood pumping through our industries and businesses, but you cannot do
this when the heart that is pumping is 500 miles away in London.
``That is why a Scottish parliament will be good for Scottish business.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ``I warmly welcome the news
that Scottish business people are willing to embrace home rule. A Scottish
parliament will bring massive opportunities for Scottish businesses and provide
a much more beneficial regime than presently exists.
``Michael Forsyth's scaremongering seems to have had no effect. Scottish
business people are unlikely to be convinced by lies and misrepresentation. We
will continue to talk to the business community in the coming months to
convince them of the merits of a Scottish Parliament.
Tories remained understandably sceptical. Scottish Conservative vice-chairman
Jackson Carlaw said: ``Obviously, we await the outcome of the survey with
interest, although it is fairly typical that the alleged conclusions have
become public knowledge before the survey itself.
``What businessmen must realise, and I count myself as one of them, is that if
Labour were to win a General Election then we would have a tax-raising
Parliament. That is their policy. Like it or not, we would have to accept that
outcome.
``The crucial question must be do businesses believe that a tax-raising
parliament will make Scotland more competititive or less? Will it make Scotland
more prosperous or less? Will it result in more inward investment or less?
``This week has seen the biggest inward investment in the UK's history come to
Scotland. Are the bosses of Chunghwa keen to pay their 3000 potential employees
more money to make up for the extra tax burden?''
Scottish Tory Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst also referred to this weeks
Lanarkshire jobs boost. During a visit to Dumfries he said: ``Despite this
delightful news and other recent inward investment successes for Scotland, our
political opponents are still hell-bent on constitutional proposals that would
put this all at risk.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said the party looked forward to seeing the
results because if business people were shifting away from supporting the
status quo it was only a matter of time before they realised the benefits of
independence in Europe.
He said: ``This completely blows a hole in the argument that Scottish business
is standing firm against any change. If they begin to countenance change, then
this opens the door to our proposals. Some business people now see independence
as akin to a management buy-out.

UNOFFICIAL action by several thousand workers at Ford's Dagenham car plant in
Essex and Transit van works in Southampton yesterday in protest at the
company's ``final'' pay offer marred the launch of the company's new Fiesta.
Dagenham workers took immediate unofficial strike action yesterday on hearing
that the company's ``final'' pay offer fell well short of their 10% demand and
included no reference to reduced hours.
Production of around 60 Transit vans was lost at Southampton.
A full shift's production of 800 new Fiestas, the first of which went on sale
yesterday, was lost.
Normal production is expected to resume today and a more considered reaction to
the offer - worth 4.75% from the end of next week and a further 4.5% or the
then rate of inflation plus 0.5%, whichever is the greater, next November -
should emerge on Wednesday.
Ford said it was disappointed with the action and urged workers at both plants
to return to normal working.
Meanwhile, unions yesterday began consulting Ford's 22,000 manual workers on
the offer ahead of a special delegate meeting next Wednesday.
Mr Tony Woodley, national officer of the TGWU, chairman of the union side,
said: ``While we recognise that the company has at last offered our members a
real but small increase in their standard of living, it still fails to make up
for the drift in Ford workers' pay within the motor industry in recent years.''
q Vauxhall car workers are voting on whether to take industrial action over
the company's offer of a 3.5% increase now and a similar rise next year, with
the ballot result due on Monday.

<HEADLINE>Britain `loses' #136m in EU funding</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN has lost #136m in European Union subsidies because of mismanagement by
the Government. Most of the money represents a windfall profit from the pound's
forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday of
1992.
Because the Government had not anticipated receiving the extra money from the
European social fund it could not find projects for funding on time. Such
projects specify help for the unemployed. As a result, the European Commission
cancelled payments.
The disclosure will greatly embarrass Ministers who are proclaiming Britain's
leadership in the fight against EU waste and mismanagement.
Details of the loss were included earlier this week in the EU's Court of
Auditors report. The passage on the UK's use of social fund money went largely
unnoticed because, it was assumed, the money could simply have been carried
forward for a year and reclaimed.
Two years ago, doubts were raised about the money being lost. The Government
denied that anything was wrong.
However, last night a Government spokesman admitted that it appeared to be gone
for good. ``The extra money which came our way was not spent and it was not
carried forward,'' he said, adding that the matter was still being discussed in
London.
The pound was blown out of the ERM in September 1992, after a desperate fight
by John Major and the then Chancellor, Norman Lamont, to save it ended in
failure and acrimonious exchanges with the Germans and vilification of
speculators. Mr Lamont later resigned and Mr Major came close to losing his job.
The upside was that Britain stood to gain hugely from the fact that Brussels
subsidies to the UK - a major recipient of EU social funding - are paid in
Ecus, the European currency unit which is the official but non-existent coin of
Brussels in all its dealings.
When the money was paid for the 1990-93 period Britain received enough Ecus to
provide an extra #136m in sterling, reflecting a drop in the value of the pound
of up to 20%.
To qualify for the money Britain had to promote special programmes mainly
involving training and help for the unemployed. The aid had also to be spent
within specific periods.
However, at the end of 1993 the rules were changed as the social fund swelled.
A rule stating that unspent or unclaimed money could simply be carried over was
altered.

<HEADLINE>`Green Card' obsession led to `humiliated' Chinese intellectual killing his wife Marriage plot led to killing</HEADLINE>

A CHINESE woman's obsession with an arranged marriage of convenience to allow
her to stay in Britain turned to tragedy after she began an affair with the man
who was to be part of the plot, a court heard.
Fan Hong was strangled by her husband Gang Zhao after he found her kissing her
lover at a railway station.
Zhao's upbringing during the Chinese revolution, which was said to mirror that
of the bestselling book The Wild Swans, meant his marriage was all the more
precious to him, said Mr Stephen Coward, QC, defending.
Mr Philip Matthews, prosecuting said Zhao, 37, was studying a post-graduate
degree in English at Luton University.
It was always his intention to return to China, where he would have almost
certainly become a professor.
His 33-year-old wife and nine-year-old son, Zutian, joined him in September
last year and they lived in a house in Biscot Road, Luton.
However, Mr Coward said their problems began after they watched the film Green
Card over Christmas last year.
``His wife became obsessed with wanting to stay in England. She loved it here.
``The film was about a marriage of convenience and she came up with the idea
that they could divorce and each marry an English person, then after a short
time divorce their new partners and remarry, each then having the status to
remain in England.'' said the defence.
Mr Coward said Zhao went along with the plan to keep his wife happy, even to
the extent of going to the Chinese Embassy to set in motion their divorce.
One potential ``husband'' for Fan Hong was Robert King, who lived in in the
same building.
Mr Matthews said: ``By February this year, she was seeing Mr King on a daily
basis. Zhao discovered they had been alone in the bedroom together and drew
conclusions from that.
``He confronted Mr King about it and he apologised.''
The prosecutor said it seemed the affair was over and Fan Hong began working as
a waitress at a Chinese restaurant in Harpenden.
On April 2, Zhao and their son turned up when she finished work to take her on
a suprise family picnic.
``She had left for the railway station and when Zhao got there he saw her and
Mr King kissing.
``There were some ructions and blows were exchanged,'' said Mr Matthews.
During the night of April 3, Zhao strangled his wife with a cord, the court was
told.
The following morning he took his son with him to Luton police station and told
the civilian on duty: ``I have murdered my wife. She has been having an affair
with an Englishman and I have found out.''
When police went to the bed sit, they found her partly clothed body and a note
written by Zhao.
It said: ``Robert King living upstairs seduced my dear, lovely wife by
hypocritically promising to help her to become a resident with a marriage of
convenience.
``I love my wife dearly and cannot bear knowing of her sleeping with another
man.
``I totally repent what I have done but it is too late.
``I am sending my son home, whom I love more than anything. I hate Robert King,
he ruined my family.''
Zhao denied the murder of his wife but pleaded guilty to her manslaughter on
the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He was jailed for three years and has promised to return to China on his
release.
Mr Justice Hooper said he would not officially be deported ``because of the
possible adverse consequences that may have upon his return''.
Three psychiatrists said in reports that Zhao was clinically depressed at the
time due to his marital circumstances.
One said events at the railway station were ``humiliating and threatening` and
that something must have been said in the room ``to cause the worm to turn''.
Mr Coward said when Fan Hong became friendly with Mr King: ``She never
contemplated becoming emotionally or sexually involved.
``But when she did she became torn as to what to do for the best.''
He said Zhao's promising life was in ruins.
``When he returns to China he will be personna non grata because he will have
been deemed to have been an ambassador while in this country.
``His son is living with his wife's family and they will not allow him any
contact with the boy.''
Mr Coward said Zhao's family were ``politically significant'' and during the
revolution were ``ritually humiliated''.
He was nine when the revolution began and his brilliant university career did
not start until the end of the revolution.

Scotland's Colin McRae
could win the World
Rally Championship next
week, says Ross Finlay
UNLIKE the Formula One championship, the winner of which was known before last
weekend's Australian Grand Prix, the World Rally Championship comes to a
fighting finish on the Network Q RAC Rally, starting on Sunday from Chester.
Two drivers share the championship lead. The title will be decided on this
final round, and at the end of it we might have the first-ever Scottish world
rally champion.
Towards the end of last month's Catalunya Rally in Spain there was an
over-wrought atmosphere within the Prodrive Subaru team when orders were given
for Colin McRae to pick up deliberate time penalties, so as to allow his
Spanish team leader Carlos Sainz back into first place, thus winning his home
event, with McRae second. But it was revealed soon afterwards that Sainz had
already signed to join a rival team after the RAC Rally. His ``sweetener''
victory came too late.
The result is that McRae and Sainz start the RAC Rally on Sunday from Chester
exactly level on championship points. Nothing is certain in rallying, and there
is always the possibility that, although Sainz has won the rally twice in the
past, and McRae once, neither of them may score additional points this time.
If that happens, Sainz will be the champion, because the tie-break system
favours whoever has scored more individual event victories during the season.
When McRae deferred to Sainz, that not only put them level on points, it also
gave Sainz three wins this season so far - to McRae's one.
Although the Subaru drivers start favourites, and one of them must win the
driver's title, the team leading the manufacturers' championship, by a
wafer-thin margin, is Mitsubishi, whose efforts are directed by another Scot,
Andrew Cowan.
The other principal team involved, Toyota Team Europe, has been bundled out of
this year's championship after being caught cheating on the Catalunya. The
power of an engine rises with the amount of air forced into it, and, to keep
power outputs with in reasonable limits, world championship cars must be fitted
with an exactly-sized air restrictor. TTE's cars in Spain used tampered-with
turbochargers which by-passed the restrictor.
Sunday's 28 miles of stages, between Chester and Leeds, are in parkland and the
grounds of stately homes. They are less ``Mickey Mouse'' than in the past, even
though the fixation about providing car-damaging water-splashes just for the
benefit of the TV cameras may persist. Monday is when the real action starts.
Clerk of the course Fred Gallagher, who lives in Edinburgh and is himself a
rally co-driver of immense experience, has designed a Monday morning to
remember. His 37-mile stage at Pundershaw in Kielder Forest is worth all the
parkland stages in creation. Soon after that, the cars still in the running
cross the border for the only two stages in Scotland. Details in the motorsport
diary.
While the RAC Rally is not run on biblical lines, there is almost an element,
as on all world championship rounds, of the first being last and the last being
first. The Subaru Impreza of Colin McRae and his co-driver Derek Ringer, for
instance, has carried competition number four throughout the season, but will
leave Chester first because they won the RAC Rally last year.
Another Scottish co-driver, Robert Reid, partners Richard Burns in Subaru
number six, which will start ninth. And Alister McRae, winner of the Mobil
1/Top Gear series, the top UK rally championship this year, drives a Ford
Escort Cosworth numbered 44 but leaving 14th. His car is prepared by Malcolm
Wilson, but is heavily supported by Ford.
Confusing the issue still further, the convoy is occasionally re-seeded,
according to drivers' positions on accumulated stage times at certain
pre-arranged points. One Scottish driver given a notable present in time for
the RAC is Robbie Head. His factory-backed Renault Clio Maxi is in the
two-litre Formula Two category, whose cars are less powerful than the full
world championship entries. The Renault now has 270bhp on tap, instead of the
220bhp available before. Engine-tuning experience from the British Touring Car
Championship Lagunas, and a rally programme in France, makes the difference.
The 190-strong entry list includes a good selection of other Scottish-based
drivers. Dom Buckley drives a Mitsubishi Lancer. Brian Lyall, John Baird,
George Gauld, Gordon Smith, Malloch Nicoll and Sandy Dalgarno are in Escorts,
while Red Barry has entered a Suzuki Swift.
These private entrants will be battling for class and category awards rather
than being able to match the works teams' times, although they will give one of
the toughest rallies in Europe their best shot. Though preoccupied with their
own adventures, they will no doubt find time to give Colin McRae at least moral
support.
The McRaes - Colin, Alister and their father Jim, himself a British champion -
form a unique rallying dynasty. Jim is the number two seed in the Miller Oils
Historic RAC Rally, which tackles a series of Yorkshire forests tomorrow,
before the main rally begins, as well as all but one of the Sunday stages.
His car is a Porsche 911, like the one driven by the number one seed in the
historic event, Ake Andersson from Sweden.
Andersson pipped McRae senior for first place last year, and you may be sure
that it is not just the youngsters in the family who will be determined to
outpace their rivals.

A LEADING European Union decision-maker arrived in Edinburgh yesterday amid
rumours and concerns that European aid to large parts of Scotland could be in
jeopardy because of a forthcoming coming review of structural funds.
However, EU Regional Commissioner Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies insisted that no
decisions had yet been taken over setting the new criteria for distributing
such funding.
She had come on her first visit to Scotland to see for herself how the EU money
was being spent in areas such as Niddrie and Craigmillar in Edinburgh, West
Lothian and Tayside.
Today, she will address the annual conference of the East of Scotland European
Consortium in Edinburgh.
Asked if Scotland should be worried over the review, Mrs Wulf-Mathies said she
did not think major changes of funding for Scotland would come in the 1995-1999
period, but she did not want to close the debate before it had started.
The country's economic performance had been quite good but she was well aware
that there still were parts which were very deprived.
However, she believed a review of the criteria for gaining Objective 2 status
was necessary. The results would be announced in the early spring.
Lothians Labour Euro-MP David Martin, who accompanied the commissioner on her
tour of the Edinburgh area, said he believed Scotland did have something to
fear.
Even on the present criteria, Scotland would be in danger of losing its
eligibility in some areas.
For example Niddrie/Craigmillar only had qualified for funding in the 1994
programme. It would be very damaging if the area now dropped out again.
The same could be said for places like former mining village Newtongrange,
which the commissioner visited. Midlothian only had received funding about five
years ago.
Mr Martin said: ``We don't want new areas which are using the money well
suddenly finding that halfway through the programme they are not going to have
European funding.''
He said the East of Scotland was due to receive about #100m up to 1999.
Asked about the recently reported loss by the EU of #400m through fraud, Mrs
Wulf-Mathies said this had not been related to the structural funds.
The new commission had changed its attitude to financial management and towards
the fight against fraud. It was very anxious to improve its financial
performance.

DETECTIVES investigating the killing of schoolgirl Naomi Smith arrested four
people in a series of dawn raids yesterday.
Naomi, 15, was stabbed and sexually assaulted before being dumped under a slide
at a recreation ground just 200 yards from her home in Ansley Common, near
Nuneaton, Warwickshire, on September 14.
Her body was discovered by her father, Brian, and Emma Jones, her best friend.
Officers visited 15 addresses in Ansley Common and Nuneaton at around 6.30am
yesterday. An unspecified number of people were helping with inquiries at
police stations in Nuneaton, Bedworth, Atherstone, and Rugby.
None of those arrested yesterday was among the five people previously detained
in connection with the inquiry and later released.
Last month, detectives began DNA tests on more than 800 men aged 15 to 28
living in and around the Warwickshire village.
They warned that anyone who persistently failed to volunteer for testing would
be likely to become the focus of inquiries.
Detective Superintendent Tony Bayliss said police had been able to obtain a DNA
profile of Naomi's killer.
There was no indication whether yesterday's raids, described as a major police
operation, resulted from the DNA testing programme.
Police decided to target young men on the advice of a forensic psychologist who
drew up an offender profile.
The inquiry team have interviewed more than 1800 people and obtained witness
statements from more than 400.

THE Scottish Office was accused yesterday of ``using four-year-olds like
political footballs'' as Labour's Scottish Education spokeswoman Helen Liddell
promised to reverse the plans for nursery vouchers to be implemented in a new
Education Bill.
She said Labour would reverse the policy in government and Labour councils
would agree to pilot schemes only ``under the strictest of conditions,''
although she feared that ``a devious and panic-stricken Government'' would go
over the heads of opposed councillors and implement them anyway.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the backlog on school repairs
had now reached #500m.
Teachers and pupils throughout Scotland were ``having to endure decaying
classrooms and are clamouring for extensions or repairs.''
The Scottish Office has not yet named a date for the Education Bill's
introduction or whether it will begin in the Commons or the Lords.
In a letter to Education Minister Raymond Robertson, Mrs Liddell acused the
Government of rushing the schemes in Ministers' panic preparation for an
election.
She asked: ``Have you no concern for the education and emotional development of
the four year olds you intend using as political footballs?''
Calling the voucher exercise ``a charade'' she pointed out that only 16% of
those who responded to the Government's consultation exercise supported
vouchers.
Mr Wallace said his party was ``wholly sceptical'' about vouchers and issued a
list of outstanding education repairs in the Scottish regions and islands to
back its pledge to spend an extra #55m on education capital spending.
The list shows: Strathclyde #142m, Borders #9.4m, Lothian #69m, Central #92.2m,
Tayside #25m, Fife #36m, Dumfries and Galloway #15m-#20m, Highland #34m,
Grampian #72m and Orkney #300,000.
q Mr Robertson last night lost patience with the union which formerly
represented him over the issue of nursery vouchers (writes Barclay McBain).
The Educational Institute of Scotland, to which Mr Robertson belonged when he
was a teacher, was on the receiving end of a furious attack from the Minister.
The union's deputy general secretary, Mr Fred Forrester, said vouchers were
unacceptable in principle, unworkable, and amounted to no more than a political
ploy to avoid major expenditure on pre-schooling ahead of the General Election.
However, Mr Robertson said it was ``absurd, illogical, and desperate'' for the
EIS to accuse the Government of stalling to save money.

A TALE of pirates unfolded yesterday in the unlikely setting of Paisley, with
protagonists crossing swords with accusations of eviction and blackmail.
It began with the Paisley Pirates Russian ice hockey player Alex Koulekov
claiming that he had been forced from his three-bedroom home after the club
failed to pay his rent.
The player, his wife, Galina, and nine-year-old son Vitalik, are now sharing a
hotel room after claiming they had been given just 48 hours to leave their flat
in the town's Grahamston Court amid claims that the club had consistently
failed to pay rent for the premises on
Last night, however, Paisley Pirates' coach Martin Shields denied that the
family had been evicted because of any cash wrangle, admitting only that the
club and the player's landlord had ``fallen out''.
He said: ``We agreed with the people who had the flat that it would be best for
both parties if we terminated the lease. I am not prepared to go into any
detail.''
Mr Shields said he had shown the Koulekovs a luxury bungalow on Monday but they
had refused to pay an extra #48 a month on top of the #350 a month rent the
club has an agreement with the player to pay.
The next thing Mr Shields knew, the player had been quoted in the local paper,
claiming he and his family were being forced to live in a hotel room with all
their belongings.
``We don't understand what is happening to us. We don't know why the Paisley
Pirates are treating us this way. We had to leave our home and our friends.
We're shattered,'' Mr Koulekov, 40, told the local paper.
Mr Shields said: ``I feel gutted and annoyed at the stand Alex has taken. He is
our fourth import and not a regular player in the team. However, he is on #600
a week.''
``All he pays for is his gas, his electricity, and his phone. The bottom line
is that we will not be blackmailed and held to ransom. He is not hard done to
and knew the situation on Monday.''
The Pirates, who were established three years ago, play in British Division One
and regularly attract crowds of more than 1000.
The couple who rented their home to the Russians confirmed last night that they
had been forced to seek legal advice and end the leasing agreement.

SHADOW Foreign Secretary Robin Cook last night launched the angriest attack so
far on the Government over its foreign policy and the proposals contained in
the Queen's Speech. He said the Government was bankrupt and broken-backed.
On the second day of debate on the Government's plans for the forthcoming
session of Parliament, he targeted, in particular, the stance on Europe and the
``jingoism'' shown by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo in his speech to the
Tory conference last month.
Mr Cook said: ``Since the Queen's Speech is so slim on ideas, so thin on new
initiatives, so irrelevant to the real problems of Britain, any further Queen's
Speech from this administration will set new standards in minimalist literature.
``The best feature about this debate is that the next time it may be a Labour
Queen's Speech. That will put Britain on the road towards a competitive
economy, based not on exploitation of low wages but investment in high skills.''
He pledged Labour to the Social Chapter, and said: Labour would seek alliances
and partnerships within the international community, rather than see Britain
standing alone.
In his attack on Mr Portillo, Mr Cook condemned his attitude to Europe,
focusing on the Defence Secretary's strong rejection of a European army.
Mr Portillo in a speech yesterday, derided the concept of a single European
army, and declared that Britain would never be told by Brussels when to fight
and when not to fight.
In an outspoken address to a high-powered conference on future British
security, he criticised European federalists' aspirations for a common defence
policy, warning that Nato would be weakened and enemies could foolishly decide
to attack.
Mr Cook said that Mr Portillo's ``exceedingly ungracious'' speech to the party
conference sounded depressing in the original English, but must have sounded
frightful in German. ``Your jingoism had its day 100 years ago. It is a
positive menace in the modern world.''
Earlier, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said few MPs doubted that the future
of the United Kingdom lay in the EU.
However, he added: ``Beyond that basic premise lies the question of what sort
of Europe we want, what sort of Europe is right for Britain.''
The Foreign Secretary said: ``We will be motivated by the interests of the UK.
``This is not a matter of blinkered self-interest. It is a matter of the
Government's inescapable obligation to its own people and it is a reflection of
the principle that a voluntary association will not prosper unless it balances
the interests of all its members.
``While recognising the benefits that the EU continues to bring to us, we also
want to make it work better.''
Mr Menzies Campbell, for Liberal Democrats, said that at at the EU
intergovernmental conference next year the Government should reaffirm that the
UK was at the heart of Europe.``We should declare it is our intention to join a
single European currency, if one is created, if the financial criteria are met.
Winding up the debate later, Mr Portillo promised that Britain would use its
presidency of the Western European Union to build defence structures that
worked.
Defence was first the responsibility of a sovereign nation, he insisted. ``We
will not meet the challenge of tomorrow by institutional tinkering or by
submerging our sovereignty and our armed forces into supra-national
constructions.''
During the debate, Mr Rifkind covered the main issues of foreign policy,
including Nigeria.
He said Britain may take tougher action against Nigeria following last week's
execution of nine minority rights activists, including Ken Saro-Wiwa. He
refused to rule out further general sanctions against Nigeria, including the
freezing of their bank accounts and foreign assets.
Mr Rifkind also paid tribute to assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and said that the peace process would continue despite his death.

SOURCES close to Mr Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, yesterday
scotched rumours that he does not intend to contest his Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale seat at the General Election.
The rumours circulating in Scotland and at Westminster were described as
``complete and utter rubbish.''
The suggestion had been either that the Minister would be adopted by a more
secure English seat -joining the so-called ``chicken-run'' - or that he would
be leaving Parliament to concentrate on his business affairs, but both these
notions were completely discounted by sources.
At the last election Mr Lang, a former Scottish Secretary who has been Member
for Galloway since 1979, had a majority of 2468 over the Scottish Nationalist
candidate. Slight boundary changes make little difference to the electorate.
Last night, the chairman of the Conservative association in the constituency,
Mr William Kennedy, said of the rumour that he would not be standing again:
``That is absolute rubbish. Anyone suggesting that is going to be very
disappointed.
``Ian will be contesting this seat at the next General Election and he will win
it too.''

Saab's so-innovative
approach to engine
power is fired by
Per Gillbrand, who is
sharing his thoughts
with us this week.
PER GILLBRAND has been in Britain this week discussing his ideas about engine
design, a rare opportunity for one of the most ingenious lateral thinkers in
the motor industry to leave his Nordic lair.
The head of Engine Concept Development at Saab is an enthusiastic advocate of
turbocharging, and a man who believes that the conventional petrol engine still
has a great deal to offer in terms of improved performance, lower fuel
consumption and greatly reduced emissions - all from the same installation.
Using an exhaust gas turbocharger, which needs no mechanical power source to
run itself, and is operated by the exhaust flow being produced by the engine
anyway, what would otherwise be lost energy goes back into the system as a
performance booster.
It gives the turbo engine a power output attainable only by an unblown engine
of much bigger capacity, and thus more expensive to build in the first place,
as well as being a heavier load for the vehicle in which it is installed to
heave around.
Turbocharging is an integral part of Saab's new Ecopower engine specification,
seen in its early stages in the 1996 model-year 9000. Per Gillbrand is
confident that, as the programme develops, it will produce petrol engines able
to meet the American Ultra Low Emission Vehicles standard.
One important part of his emission reduction work concerns the catalytic
converter.
There is no doubt that this invention was forced on the motor industry before
its technology had matured. The environmental lobby paid no attention to
engineers' plaintive remarks that they had not yet reached the point of making
catalytic converters work properly from cold. It pressured the industry into
fitting the devices, then issued statements criticising manufacturers . . .
because catalytic converters did not work properly from cold.
Technically, a ``cold start'' does not mean something which happens on a winter
morning. It refers to an engine being started when its own temperature is below
85 degrees Centigrade. In other words, quite a lot of the time.
Swedish studies suggest that in the first few minutes after a cold start, many
engines produce as much pollution as they would over a 200-mile journey when
running warm. They may also use fuel at a rate of single-number miles per
gallon. Saab's intention is to fit electric engine-block heaters to be switched
on an appropriate time before the engine is started.
Another part of the Ecopower project, which also involves Saab's existing
highly sophisticated Trionic engine management, is a system which injects cold
water into the cylinders on the rare and brief occasions when the car is going
flat out, and therefore most likely to produce the highest emissions and worst
fuel consumption. The water spray reduces the temperature in the combustion
chambers from a critical level.
Where does the cold water come from? Another neat piece of lateral thinking
here. It is diverted from the windscreen-washer supply. And, yes, Gillbrand's
team is already figuring out what effect anti-freeze or other washer additives
may have.
Saab has also effectively reinvented the sparking plug. Instead of the familiar
arrangement of mounting the two electrodes across which the spark must leap at
the base of the plug itself, Per Gillbrand's idea is to have one electrode at
the bottom of the plug, and the other on the piston crown. This arrangement
produces a spark of 50,000 volts, far greater than any conventional plug can
handle, while the spark gap and timing can be optimised by the Trionic
management system.
The strong spark gives better and cleaner combustion. It will work with leaner
fuel/air mixtures than are generally possible now. Obviously, the less fuel in
the mixture, and the more efficiently it is burned, the lower the fuel
consumption and the fewer pollutants the combustion process will produce, even
before features like the catalytic converter come into play.
Per Gillbrand expects that these innovations will reach production level before
the end of the century. He has other schemes in mind too, like ``asymmetric''
turbocharging of the V6 engine, which involves a turbo unit driven by the
exhaust from just one bank of cylinders, but feeding boost to both.
When you consider that these developments are among the ones which are openly
admitted, and that there must be a host of others still kept under wraps, it is
easy to share his belief that the conventional petrol engine still has many
miles to go.

IF Saab has always been an innovative company, there is a good reason for it.
Founded in the Thirties as an aircraft manufacturer, the Swedish firm decided
in 1945 to enter the motor industry, despite the fact that it did not employ a
single person with experience of designing, developing, building, testing or
selling cars.
The prototype Saab 92 was ready the following spring. In a European industry
which elsewhere re-established itself with pre-war models having all the
aerodynamic subtlety of a block of flats, its wind-tunnel-inspired bodywork
looked like something from an alternative universe.
The 92 used a transversely-mounted engine driving the front wheels. Saab people
are understandably miffed when the praise for introducing this layout so often
goes to the Mini, which BMC launched in 1959.
Turbocharging, pollen-filtered ventilation and aircraft-inspired ``black
panel'' instrument displays were all Saab innovations in volume production
cars. Some projects, though, have been less well publicised.
During the era when the company used three-cylinder two-stroke engines, a
hush-hush experimental car was built with a pair of three-cylinder blocks
mounted in line. The straight-six engine thus created was so long it could not
be fitted either transversely or longitudinally in the production car's engine
bay. It is probably the only example on record of a saloon engine installed
diagonally.
This monstrous device could never have reached production, but it is exactly
the kind of daft project manufacturers should indulge in from time to time, to
let their designers and engineers rip.
The car was unexpectedly revealed, years later, at a factory open day. When it
was started up the racket was indescribable, but the few old hands who had been
in on the secret exchanged knowing grins.

A SPATE of ``student bashing'' in St Andrews will be stamped out, a court was
told yesterday.
Sheriff Charles Smith sentenced one attacker to 60 days in jail and another to
three months' detention. He said that recent assaults had resulted in almost
``a siege mentality'' within the town's 5000-strong student community.
The court heard that the police were reacting by increasing patrols in town
centre streets, and the university authorities were subsidising the purchase of
attack alarms and providing a free, safe bus service.
Graeme Henderson, 21, of Bothy Cottages, West Pitkierie, Anstruther, was jailed
at Cupar Sheriff Court on a total of six charges. Stuart Spence, 19, of
Sandyhill Crescent, St Andrews, was sentenced to detention.
They were involved in six incidents in St Andrews town centre in the space of
less than 30 minutes, during which one student was repeatedly punched and
robbed of #2 and another was assaulted and pushed through a large plate glass
shop window, causing damage estimated at #1000.
Henderson admitted threatening to kill a 20-year-old student if he told the
police.
Spence pled guilty to attacking an 18-year-old student by punching and kicking
him and pushing him through the shop window, and punching and kicking another
teenage student.
Mr Edward Russell, prosecuting, said that the student pushed through the window
had escaped with a small cut to his abdomen..
Mr Richard McFarlane, solictor, for Henderson, said that the accused's
recollection of the incidents were clouded because he had been drinking.
Spence's agent said that since the incidents, the accused had gained full-time
employment and had distanced himself from his previous circle of friends. ``He
has turned over a new leaf,'' he said.

``I WALK alone'' was a popular hit song a few decades ago. Mr Robin Cook, on
day two of the Queen's Speech debate, came close to suggesting that it would
make a good theme tune for the Government's European policy.
We are constantly, it seems, in a minority of one at get-togethers with our
European Union partners. Mr Major formed another such minority at the
Commonwealth Conference over French nuclear tests. Can we have an excess of
``finest hours'' in which we stand alone or was 1940 enough?
Mr Cook and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind shaped up to each other like a
couple of agony aunts split over whether a girl should go with the crowd or not
be afraid to opt out if the crowd wanted her to do something a nice girl
wouldn't do.
Auntie Malcolm took the view that if a girl is invited to join a Social Chapter
or is offered new currency by Continentals urging her to ``integrate baby,''
the correct answer is ``Non''.
Auntie Robin, like Auntie Bob, believes ``it's good to talk''. Where does all
this being independent get you? Foreign trips are no fun. You end up a
wallflower.
He seemed to take the view that you chat to your pals, talk over what you will
want to do that evening and if your idea doesn't get the most votes you go
along with the majority. No point in opting out is his advice to his
correspondent, Brit for short.
Auntie Malcolm did not hesitate to point out that Auntie Robin's advice had
been potentially lethal in the past. Who was it who said a girl should not try
to defend herself if attacked? Who was it who once advised having nothing to do
with the neighbours until their smart houses and gleaming cars brought about a
rethink?
Come off it, said Auntie Robin. What about his paper's previous columnist,
Auntie Margaret, who had banged on for years about not getting intimately
involved with foreigners and then suddenly changed her advice and told Brit to
throw caution to the winds. As Brit sobbed to her mum later, it had only been a
single act but the consequences - as sometimes happens - would be with her for
years.
It is now pretty clear to those of us who read both papers that if poor Brit
tries to take the advice of both columnists she will turn into a schizophrenic.
Recently, she wrote to Uncle Michael for help, and was told sternly that all
foreign boys were after just one thing.
When she took her troubles to Auntie Robin, he sternly lectured her that Uncle
Michael's jingoistic approach to foreign boys was out of date 100 years ago.
Nowadays, if one of them invites a girl to go to, say, Maastricht, with him for
a week he might very well just want to talk.
Auntie Robin concluded that if a girl socialises and accepts a bit of
give-and-take she can have a wonderful time abroad. Auntie Malcolm is not so
sure. That sort of thing could lead to a girl losing her freedom of action, her
self respect and who knows what else.
Poor Brit - happy groupie or self-respecting wallflower. What is it to be?

AN organisation set up to represent rural interests, chaired by the former
Liberal leader Sir David Steel, was launched yesterday and immediately dubbed
``a wolf in sheep's clothing''.
Scottish conservationists expressed concern that the organisation had been set
up to represent the hunting and shooting lobby and to counteract recent
publicity engendered by anti-blood sports and animal rights activists.
Mr Simon Pepper, head of operations at the World Wide Fund for Nature Scotland,
said of the Countryside Movement: ``I think we are due an explanation to what
extent this movement, born at the same time as the Countryside Business Group,
represents the same aims.''
Mr Pepper pointed to statements by Mr Eric Bettelheim, founder of the
Countryside Business Group, which exhort landowners, sporting tenants, and
businessmen to win the war ``against our contemporary enemy, the animal rights
brigade''.
The CBG aims to spend between #3m and #4m campaigning for the preservation of
traditional country pursuits.
The Countryside Movement, which is being backed by the CBG, said yesterday it
planned to launch a #3.5m media campaign in its first year aimed at effecting a
widespread change in awareness in the countryside.
Mr Pepper said yesterday he found Sir David's involvement in the organisation
``puzzling''.
He added: ``I am also confused that a prominent Scottish public figure like Sir
David launching a countryside movement does not appear to have made contact
with two representative organisations - Scottish and Countryside Wildlife Link
and Rural Forum.''
Sir David could not be contacted for comment last night.
The director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Scotland, Mr
Stuart Housden, said the society had declined to participate in the new
movement.
One of the directors of the new body is the Duke of Westminster - a major
landowner in Sutherland as well as in England.
Mr Hywel Davies, chief executive of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society
of Scotland, is also on the board.

THE old chestnut that Scots are mean will surely be buried forever after a
Canadian waitress benefited to the tune of $125,000 (#60,000) after being
tipped by an expatriate Scot who had spent a mere $10.50 on beers.
Mr John Steele, 55, found he did not have enough money to tip his favourite
waitress, Ms Tracy Dalton, 24, during a regular visit to Al Mac's Bar in
Toronto on November 4.
Annoyed at his predicament, he signed and left his Lotto ticket with the
broadcasting student who splits her studies at York University with her bar
duties, insisting that   he would share any
winnings.
``I'm a cheap Scotsman,'' Mr Steele explained. ``So when I get tired of giving
money I'll just sign over a lottery ticket and say, `That one's a winner'.''
Ms Dalton, who put the ticket in her purse and  forgot about it, takes up the
story.
``Last Sunday, I was buying bread and thought, I might as well check the
ticket. It turned out to be worth $250,000 Canadian (#120,000).''
She did not see Mr Steele for another couple of days. On the Tuesday, the pair
picked up the money - and took half the total each.
Mr Steele, a motor-parts salesman, whose family emigrated to Canada when he was
a boy, plans to use his share of the proceeds to return to Scotland. He will
save the rest. Ms Dalton, meanwhile, plans to continue at university.
The normally canny Scot, by his own admission, said he had no regrets.
``If you're going to win, wouldn't you want to win with a friend,'' he said.
``Besides, you've got to pay for good service. Right?''
Ms Dalton, back behind the bar last night, was again pouring drinks for Mr
Steele. Asked how the tip of a lifetime rated, she replied: ``It's not a
standard 15%, that's for sure.''
Mr Steele, a bachelor from Lochore in Fife, emigrated in 1952 with his parents
and two sisters. He is a lifelong Rangers' fan and is a member of a Toronto
supporters club.

HEARTS chairman Chris Robinson last night denied he had sold his catering
company Wheatsheaf Catering and was about to plough the profits into the
Edinburgh club.
Addressing the annual meeting of Hearts' shareholders in Edinburgh last night,
Mr Robinson said: ``I am certainly not about to walk away from Wheatsheaf
Catering, which has been my life for 18 years.
The 90th AGM of the club was attended by the largest gathering of shareholders
yet.
Mr Robinson gave a detailed financial report to the shareholders and revealed
there had been a ``#1.37m hole'' in terms of the club's borrowing facility.
The ``hole'' had included #200,000 from corporate subscribers which had not
been paid and an #87,000 bill to the Inland Revenue. Mr Robinson denied rumours
that directorships could be purchased for #100,000.
However, he did not rule out such a move in future but stressed the need for a
resolution of agreement from 75% of shareholders.
Mr Robinson also answered specific questions about the club's finances from
minorities shareholder spokesman Dr Gavin Kennedy, who was concerned that the
club was on the brink of receivership.
There was also a heated discussion about the team's finances with former
chairman, Mr Wallace Mercer, who made a surprise appearance.
Mr Mercer expressed his anger that Mr Robinson had blamed the club's financial
position on his tenure as chairman.

GRAHAM Ellis, the Currie hooker, has ruptured a biceps muscle in his left arm
and is out of the Scotland squad for the Test against Western Samoa at
Murrayfield tomorrow.
Ellis, who played for Scotland A against the tourists last weekend, and was on
the bench for tomorrow's international, was injured during a Scottish squad
session at Murrayfield on Wednesday night. The replacement hooker is Steve
Brotherstone, of Melrose.
The misfortune suffered by Ellis, who is receiving hospital treatment and may
be out of the game for eight weeks, continues the tale of woe which has
afflicted Scotland so far as candidates to fill the vacancy created by the
retirement of Kenny Milne is concerned.
Kevin McKenzie, of Stirling County, who was the heir apparent, did not come
into the reckoning for tomorrow's game as he has still not recovered from the
knee ligament damage sustained in a club game against Melrose.
Martin Scott, of Orrell, is also indisposed and the task of filling Milne's
boots has gone to the Hawick hooker, Jim Hay, who was a member of the Scotland
touring squad to Zimbabwe during the summer.
The Western Samoan wing-threequarter, Brian Lima, recovered from the hand
injury which kept him out of the side which defeated Scotland A at Hawick on
Sunday, represents the only change to that combination for the Test at
Murrayfield.
Meanwhile, hooker Onehanga Matauiau will join the Western Samoan party on
Sunday as the replacement for the injured Trevor Leota, who sustained
concussion in the match against North and Midlands at Perth on Tuesday night.
The mandatory three-week rest imposed on players with concussive injuries left
the Samoan management with no alternative but to send Leota back home.
Matauiau (22), who plays for the Moataa club in Apia and who captained the
Western Samoa under 21 side last season, will not join the touring party until
Sunday, the same day that Leota is expected to fly home.
Brendan Reidy, who was at loosehead against Edinburgh and North/Midlands, will
cover the hooker position as he did for the Samoans in the World Cup in South
Africa.
Western Samoa - V Patu; B Lima, T Vaega, G Leaupepe, A Tela; D Kellet, J
Filemu; M Mika, T Leiasamaivo, P Fatialofa, L Falaniko, P Leavasa, S Kaleta, P
Lam, S Vaifale. Replacements - M Vaea, C Burnes, S Leaega, S Smith, G Latu, B

A MYSTERY injury is threatening to keep Hearts defender Davie McPherson out of
Sunday's Edinburgh derby against Hibernian at Tynecastle.
``In the last few games I did play, I was carrying what I thought was a groin
or a hamstring injury,'' he explained. ``At first, I couldn't run without pain,
which wasn't too bad, but eventually I couldn't run at all, so something had to
be done.''
A visit to a specialist failed to solve the puzzle, but if McPherson did not
know why he was hurting, he certainly knew where.
``Because I played with the injury, it affected my back and my legs. They seem
to be okay now, but I still have pain in another part of my anatomy which will
remain nameless. Let's just say I'd like to get to the bottom of things,'' he
joked.
Meantime, Hibs have an injury crisis. Counted out is striker Keith Wright, who
injured a hamstring at Falkirk last weekend, Graham Mitchell still will not be
ready, while Willie Miller and David Farrell are long-term injury victims.
Scotland Under-21 striker Kevin Harper injured a shoulder in training this week
and is toiling. But Andy Millen will return to the midfield, allowing Darren
Jackson to move forward into attack.
q.John Brown launched his book in Glasgow yesterday and warned that he was
ready to stay around until Rangers had won 10 titles in a row.
Asked if he would be able to help the club win their eighth successive title,
he answered: ``I want to be there for 10 in a row.''
But he warned: ``Celtic look as if they will push us all the way this season. I
think they are better prepared than they have been for some time. However, they
will be at Ibrox this weekend and we have to make sure that they do not
continue the good form they have shown at our place in recent years.''
Brown's book, Blue Grit, is published by Mainstream and is now available.
q.DUNDEE should have a full squad for tomorrow's Tayside derby at Tannadice,
while Dundee United are confident that defender Maurice Malpas will overcome
the ankle he injured last week against St Mirren.
q.MANAGER Alex McLeish is frustrated by an unprecedented injury crisis at
Motherwell. He admitted yesterday: ``I'll have to wait and see who turns up
with their boots before picking the team for Kilmarnock. The injury situation,
which has been horrendous all season, is now even worse after two more players
were crocked in training, and four others have gone down with a flu outbreak.
It's a worry in case it spreads even further.''
But Scotland defender Rob McKinnon has recovered from injury to lighten the
gloom.
q.ROY Hodgson, who recently took charge of the Italian giants Inter Milan, was
yesterday given the go-ahead to lead Switzerland in the European Championship
finals.
Swiss Soccer Federation Chief Giangiorgio Spiess was thought to be unhappy
about Hodgson's dual role, but confirmed yesterday that the Englishman would be
in charge of the Swiss in England next summer.
q.MARTIN O'Neill goes into hospital next week for a groin operation, and that
could bring a change in training methods at Clyde.
The Scotland Under-21 cap, who is being watched by a number of major clubs
including Aberdeen after requesting a transfer, will be out for up to three
weeks.
Concerned about the number of groin strains suffered in training, manager Alex
Smith said yesterday: ``From now on we will train in the same kind of boots
that we play in, to see if that will make a difference.''
Central defender Jim Thomson is emerging as the latest transfer target. Dundee
United could follow up their interest in Thomson, who spent last week training
at Tannadice.
q.BLACKBURN  and Dundee United are front-runners to snap up Caledonian's Iain
Stewart.
Watched by Blackburn, Scotland's top scorer took his tally to 15 goals in 13
games with a double at Hampden last Saturday, while United are understood to be
highly impressed after several trips to eye the 26-year-old trainee driving
instructor.
Meanwhile, Thistle's classy teenage defender Richard Hastings has been watched
by Liverpool, Celtic, and Dundee United.
q.BP YOUTH Cup-holders Rangers have a home tie against Motherwell in the fourth
round. The full draw, made yesterday, is:
Raith Rovers v St Mirren, Partick Thistle v Aberdeen, Falkirk v Kilmarnock,
Hearts v St Johnstone, Rangers v Motherwell, Dunfermline v Dundee, Hamilton v
Dundee United, Celtic v Hibernian. Ties to be played by December 10.

AUSTRALIAN MASTERS
BRITAIN'S Laura Davies made a disastrous start to her campaign to win a third
successive Alpine Australian Ladies Masters title at the Royal Pines on the
Gold Coast yesterday.
Davies twice found herself in water off the tee and was unhappy with her
opening round score of 72 in the #150,000 event, which left her six shots
adrift off the pace.
Swedish pair Annika Sorenstam and Liselotte Neumann shot seven-under-par rounds
of 66 to share the first-round lead after they both hit eight birdies.
They hold a one-shot advantage over Australian duo Karen Lunn and Jennifer
Sevil while English pair Alison Nicholas and Caroline Hall were among a large
group one shot further back.
Davies admitted: ``It was not a fun day. It's hard to give players like Annika
six shots. I'll have to shoot three rounds in the low 60s to have a shot at it.
I'm not packing my bags, but I haven't made it easy for myself.''
Neumann predicted the British star could still make a challenge, insisting:
``She is such a great player she is capable of just about anything on this golf
course.
``The greens here are in superb condition - the best I've ever played on. If
you get your ball on line, it sticks on the line and goes in. I could have shot
four or five less. I had a lot of chances.'' Leading scores (Australian unless
stated):
66 - L Neumann (Sweden), A Sorenstam (Sweden).
67 - K Lunn, J Sevil.
68 - A Nicholas (England), K Orum (Denmark), E Klein (USA), K Webb, C Hall
(England), M Lee, S Williams, S Waugh, M Lunn.
69 - J Leary, C Nilsmark (Sweden), A Munt (Austria), B Burton (USA), C Dibnah,
K McIntosh, L Lambert, J Geddes (USA).
70 - M Madill (Ireland), H Hopkins, W Lin-Li (Thailand), C Keggi (USA), K
Parker-Gregory (USA), R Walton (USA), S Beikoff, C Hjalmarsson (Sweden), C
Matthew, (Scotland), N Lowien.
71 - F Pike, A-M Knight, D Reid (Scotland), K Crawford (USA), M-P Quilty
(Canaa).
72 - M Iishi (Japan), J Crafter, L Chiou-yann (Thailand), E-J Smith (England),
D Booker, R Hetherington, L Davies (England), P Rizzo (USA), K Pearce, N Tanoi
(Japan).
q RECORD prize money of #500,000, with a winner's cheque of #80,000, will be on
offer at next year's Weetabix Women's British Open at Woburn. The event, to be
staged from August 15 to 18, again will be televised live by the BBC.
q AUSTRALIANS John Clifford and Jamie Taylor carded three-under-par 69s
yesterday and shared the lead after the first round of the $150,000 Victorian
Open in Melbourne. Leading scores (Australian unless stated):
69 - J Taylor, J Clifford.
70 - G Ogilvy, L Parsons, S Conran, D Brown, P Fitzgibbon, R Green, B Partridge.
71 - A Bonhomme, B Lamb, C Jones, D Smail (New Zealand), P Hodge, B Ogle, G

ENGLAND'S Barry Lane, in a late-season Indian summer vein of form, matched the
weather with a flawless seven under par 64 in the first round of the #1.3m
Dunlop Phoenix tournament, the richest in Japan, in Miyazaki yesterday.
Lane is something of a course specialist after finishing runner-up to Ernie Els
here two years ago and third behind Jumbo Ozaki last year - a double bogey 5 at
the seventeenth scuppered him then.
``There's a long way to go,'' the 35-year old cautioned, ``but I'm playing well
and it's about time I won again. I was second in the European Open, second in
the European Masters, and second in the Kapalua International the other week.
``I picked up a new Mizuno driver on Wednesday and I hit the ball well and
putted beautifully. I don't think I had to chip once.''
Lane thus avoided any shanking - he had the first socket of his career last
Sunday - and found himself leading a distinguished field by one shot. The
inevitable Ozaki, the defending champion, was second on 65 and is determined to
prevent the upstart Satoshi Higashi, currently leading the Japanese money list,
from finishing the season No.1. In these parts what Jumbo determines Jumbo
usually gets.
Five-times Open champion Tom Watson, winner here in 1980 and second last year,
shared third place after a five-birdie 66. ``I was happy,'' he professed. ``I
did everything all right and my putting, for the most part, was good. It was
the perfect day to score, with hardly any breeze, although there were certain
places you didn't want to be in the rough. I got two good lies and two awkward
ones, but no difficult ones.''
Els was leading the field after going out in 31, five under, but finished with
a 68 because of a fit of pique. After three-putting the fourteenth, the giant
Springbok, irritated, threw his putter at his bag. It broke in two and Els
opted to use his sand iron on the greens for the last four holes. As a result
he bogeyed the sixteenth and seventeenth, but two-wedged for a birdie 4 after
reaching the 534-yard eighteenth in two.
``I've won several tournaments, including the US Open and the World Matchplay
with that putter,'' Els said. ``It didn't deserve that.'' Leading scores
(Japanese unless stated):
64 - B Lane (Britain).
65 - M Ozaki.
66 - S Maruyama, L Mize (USA), R Gamez (USA), T Watson (USA).
67 - Y Kaneko, S Simpson (USA).
68 - M Kuramoto, N Ozaki, E Els (South Africa), L Nelson (USA), G Marsh
(Australia), V Singh (Fiji).
Other sores inlued: 70 - P Walton (Ireland), M A Jimenez (Spain). 74 - C Rocca
(Italy).
q ROOKIE Zhang Lianwei upstaged Scotland's Sam Torrance in the opening round of
the #200,000 Hong Kong Open yesterday.
China's Zhang, a self-taught player who has been professional for just a year,
shot a six-under-par 65 to lie two shots adrift of first-round leader Rafael
Alarcon, of Mexico.
But he was four better than playing partner Torrance. ``I just could not get
the speed of the greens and my double bogey at the last was not very good at
all,'' said the Scot. Leading scores (American unless stated):
65 - R Alarcon (Mexico).
66 - L Porter.
67 - Z Lianwei (China), G Nicklaus (USA), R Todd (Canaa), Y Chang-ting (Taiwan).
68 - N Kawakami (Japan), L Keng-chi (Taiwan), J Steenkamer (Hollan), J Van de
Velde (France), G Webb.
Other scores included: 69 - P Stewart, C Sang-ho (South Korea). 70 - E Romero
(Argentina). 71 - S Torrance (Scotland).

GREG Norman has been by far the dominant figure in the Sony world rankings,
which has just completed its 500th week and is approaching the end of the tenth
year of its existence. Since 1986 the Australian has held the No.1 position for
231 of those weeks and is the only player never to have been lower than tenth
on the list.
Indeed, Norman, whose worst placing was seventh in 1992, has become the US
Tour's leading money-winner with $9.5m since he joined it in 1983, the year
after he had finished first on the European order of merit - the only golfer to
have completed that particular dual achievement.
In the past decade only six other professionals have occupied the pole position
and among them they have won 19 major championships and been No.1 on either the
European or US Tours. They are Nick Faldo, Severiano Ballesteros, Ian Woosnam,
Nick Price, Fred Couples, and Bernhard Langer.
Faldo is a long way behind Norman in the number of weeks he has led, but his
total of 97 includes the record of 81 in succession. The five others were first
among equals for 60, 50, 43, 16, and three weeks respectively. However, an
imminent change in the grading system may alter cases, if only slightly.
At the end of 1995 the three-year ``rolling period'' is to be changed to a
two-year system, placing more emphasis on the current 12-month period. It will
thereby come into line with the policy of the world's principal professional
tours and of the Royal and Ancient Club and the United States Golf Association
of granting championship and tournament exemptions and team invitations in
recognition of more up-to-date form.
q.CURTIS Cup squad members Alison Rose and Lesley Nicholson will be taking part
in a Scottish senior squad training session at St Andrews over the next three
days. A 17-strong junior squad also have a weekend get together at Inverclyde.
Squads:
Senior: Caroline Agnew (Eastwood), Karen Fitzgerald (Turnberry), Jayne Ford
(Gullane), Anne Laing (Vale of Leven), Fiona McKay (Turnberry), Fiona McKay
(Elgin), Sharon McMaster (Dunbar), Valerie Melvin (Stirling), Hilary Monaghan
(Longniddry), Lesley Nicholson (Haddington), Alison Rose (Stirling), Lindsey
Roxburgh (Tain).
Junior: Gayle Burgess (Elgin), Karyn Burns (Clydebank and District), Tracy
Dodds (Stranraer), Lynne Fenton (Abertay), Vikki Laing (Musselburgh), Fiona
Lockhart (Balbirnie Park), Shonagh McEwan (Gifford), Lesley Mackay (Golspie),

ERIC Peters will be sitting in front of his television set in Bath when his
erstwhile Scottish comrades-in-arms lock horns with the Western Samoans
tomorrow afternoon at Murrayfield.
Peters, the find of the last Five Nations' Championship campaign, is out of
favour and out the side. To add insult to injury he will have to wait until
close of business at Twickenham, where England entertain the Springboks, before
he can watch televised highlights of the Murrayfield game.
It's been a rough couple of weeks for the amiable Peters. First, he was dropped
by Scotland in favour of Stuart Reid, and then he played at blindside
wing-forward, as opposed to his favoured berth at No.8, as Scotland A succumbed
to the Samoans at Hawick on Sunday.
Reid, the Boroughmuir No.8, has undoubtedly been playing well and deserves his
international call-up. The problem facing the Scotland selectors was one of
blend in the back-row and they have gone for Gloucester's Ian Smith as a
genuine open-side replacement for the retired Iain Morrison.
There was a case to be made for playing Reid, Peters, and Rob Wainwright as an
admittedly one-paced back-row unit, but the selectors have dismissed it for the
time being, at least.
Peters, 26, a surveyor by profession, learned of his demotion in a phone call
from Murrayfield the night before the team details were announced. ``I was
surprised, but you have to take the knocks and use them as a spur to get back.
I was told that there wasn't a major problem with my form but they thought that
Stuart Reid deserved his chance and you can't really argue with that.''
The former Cambridge University captain, who was born in Glasgow from good
Dumbarton stock, was reluctant to be interviewed for fear that he could be
accused of upsetting the apple-cart.
``I don't want this to appear as if I'm moaning on the sidelines, because I'm
not,'' said Peters. ``I want to win back my place in the Scotland side and it's
up to me to prove that I can do it. That's why the Inter-district Championship
will be so important to the Exiles and to me personally.
``I knew that Stuart Reid had been getting rave reviews in the press. I knew
that Rob would be in the side and I suspected, too, that Ian Smith would be in.
Therefore I knew that if Stuart was pushing then he would be pushing against
me.''
But competition for a back-row slot is not new territory for Peters. It is
something that he experiences weekend in and weekend out at Bath. Thereby may
hang at least part of the answer to his exclusion.
The former Scotland coach, Dougie Morgan, who now manages the A side, dropped
the heaviest of hints at the team selection news conference that Peters would
benefit from regular first XV rugby and that he would, certainly, be guaranteed
that if he were to up sticks and move to Scotland.
Peters is aware of that school of thought but still relishes the challenge of
securing a regular first-team berth at the Recreation Ground. ``I had been with
Saracens, but after university I went to Bath and I did so because they are the
premier club in Europe with superb facilities and coaching set-up.
``I knew when I went that they had five internationalist back-row players all
battling each week for a regular position. With Dave Egerton, Jon Hall, Andy
Robinson, Ben Clarke and Steve Ojomoh all trying to get into the back-row I
knew that it wasn't going to be an easy ride, but I relished the challenge,''
said Peters. ``Dave and Jon have now retired, so it's getting easier.
``I've been getting games at No.6 in the first team. I would prefer No.8,
because it is a more constructive position in terms of attack but there are
quite a few similarities between blindside and No.8.''
So far as enlisting on the Scottish club scene is concerned, Peters cites again
the fact that he is happy to compete for a regular place at Bath and, again,
underlines that the English side is the foremost club in Europe.
``It may well be that I could get regular first-team rugby in Scotland, but I'm
sure that I can get it down here, too. That's the challenge I've set myself and
I aim to succeed.''
What will happen next season when English clubs - and presumably Bath will be
involved - are competing in the new European Cup alongside Scottish district
sides (if indeed Scotland follows the district route) is for the moment a
matter of conjecture. Would, for instance, Bath be happy to see their exiles
enrol with a Scottish district and compete against them in Europe?
``I just don't know what will happen. It hasn't been decided yet what the
structure is going to be and it certainly hasn't filtered down to the clubs yet
so, at the moment, it is a big grey area,'' said Peters.

ROUND-UP
GARY Armstrong has a busy weekend. Not only will he be standing by as a
replacement for Scotland in the international against Western Samoa at
Murrayfield but he will return for Jed-Forest for the important second division
premiership match against Selkirk at Riverside Park on Sunday.
Jed, who won by only 17-16 against Dundee in Armstrong's absence last week,
would be certain of promotion if they were to take even one point off Selkirk.
Armstrong missed the win at Mayfield as he was to lead Scotland A against the
Samoans the following day.
Boroughmuir, bidding to jump over Melrose to the top of the first division,
have recalled Alistair Cadzow for the match against Watsonians at Myreside on
Sunday. He takes over in the back row from Stuart Reid, who is to make his
international debut tomorrow.
Grant Blacklock will be Hawick's hooker in place of Jim Hay against Edinburgh
Academicals at Mansfield Park. Hay, like Reid, will be playing for Scotland for
the first time.
q GLASGOW Southern will honour three of their forwards - Alex McDougall, Stuart
Aitken, and Gavin Walsh - at a dinner at Braidholm on Monday.
McDougall will be playing his 500th first-team game when Southern seek to
secure promotion to the third division when they visit Kilmarnock on Sunday,
and Aitken will have his 100th match for the club six days later, when Ayr
visit Braidholm. That match next week also will be Walsh's last premier league
game for Southern before he departs for Bristol.
Southern have listed John Clinkenbeard in their squad for Bellsland in the hope
that he can return to the back row after a leg injury.
q THE first Scotland under-21 international against England will take place at
Gateshead on Tuesday, December 12. The match is part of a double-header before
the England A-Western Samoa game.
q GLASGOW have named a strong under-21 team for the match against the Scottish
Universities at Braidholm on Wednesday (kick-off 7.0). Ten of the XV were in
one or other of the two under-21 teams whom Scotland fielded against the New
Zealand Youth tourists in the past three weeks. Glasgow team:
K I Baillie (Edinburgh Academicals); C C MacRobert (Stirling County), A J
Bulloch (West of Scotland), C M Sangster (Stirling County), G D Caldwell (GHK);
M I Hose (Wigtownshire), E J W Weston (Watsonians); D Port (Glasgow
Academicals), G C Bulloch (West of Scotland), D Jamieson (West of Scotland), S
Begley (Glasgow Academicals), G C Perrett (West of Scotland), R Wylie (Stirling
County), D R McLeish (West of Scotland), I W Sinclair (Watsonians). Reserves -
A C D Greenshields (West of Scotland), S Jenkins (Kilmarnock), D Wilson
(Cambuslang), C Houston (Glasgow Southern), N Adams (GHK), R Harvey (Cartha
Queen's Park), M P J Smith (Watsonians), C P Docherty (GHK).

A PALTRY crowd of around 150 witnessed a convincing South victory at Netherdale
last night.
The home side registered a deluge of points, scoring six tries, but a plethera
of knock-ons, sloppy passes, and misplaced enthusiasm for the wrong option had
the brave spectators in the bitter weather checking their watches regularly and
clapping their hands in prayer for the final whistle.
Selkirk stand-off Scott Nichol impressed, scoring a hat trick of tries -
including the opener in five minutes - in a fine all-round display which showed
himself to be one of the most astute and accurate kickers in open play in
Scotland.
However, it was full back Graeme Aitchison who put the much needed points on
the board with a personal haul of 26 points with a try, three penalties, and
six conversion.
His touchdown and conversion just before the interval - closely following
another by winger Mark Moncrieff, who had waltzed round four visiting players -
made the game safe at 32-17.
Winger Keith Suddon also weighed in with a try and Kelso flanker Stewart Bennet
grabbed a well deserved touchdown.
The South African scorers were Marthinus, Fourie, Horn and captain Jaarsveld,
with a try apiece, while Markram slotted three conversions.
The brightest moment among periods of tedium came at the start of the second
half.
South African stand-off Markram received the ball while still putting on his
shirt. With it half on he took off from his twenty-two and sliced through the
South back division. He then kicked the ball over Aitchison, pulled his shirt
over his head, and joined the race for the ball, now bobbling near to the South
line.
Moncrieff won the race and to a great sigh of disappointment from the crowd the
entertaining South African was penalised for not allowing the South winger to
return to his feet.
South - Graeme Aitchison (Kelso); Mark Moncrieff (Gala), Jimmy Turnbull
(Melrose), Cameron Murray (Hawick), Keith Suddon (Hawick); Scott Nichol
(Selkirk), Kevin Reid (Hawick); Gary Isaac (Gala), Steve Scott (Melrose), Kevin
Allan (Melrose), Ian Elliot (Hawick), Robbie Brown (Melrose), Stewart Bennet
(Kelso), Kevin Armstrong (Jed-Forest), Brian Renwick (Hawick) (captain).
Griqualand West - Brenton Marthinuse; Marius Fourie, Lourens Ventner, Ian Horn,
Petrus Dippenaar; Robert Markram, Gert Wyk; Spiro Lourverdis, Ian Buys,
Johannes Zyl, Jaco Visser, Vernon Kaplan, Jacques Pretorious, Gideon Watts,
Siegfried Jaarsveld (captain).
Referee - E Murray (Greenock Wanderers).
q WELSH rugby union legend Ieuan Evans will lead a British Isles XV containing
seven British Lions and 516 Test caps - including five Scots - in his
testimonial at Llanelli on Tuesday.
The Wales wing - who became his country's most capped player against Fiji last
weekend when he made his 56th appearance - is joined by Gavin Hastings, his
former Lions' skipper, and England captain Will Carling in the British line-up.
Sensational New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu is the star attraction of the
international Select XV, which includes players from six countries.
British Isles - G Hastings (Scotland); I Evans (Wales), W Carling (England), S
Hastings, K Logan; C Chalmers (all Scotland); R Moon (Wales), J Leonard
(England), G Jenkins, J Davies, P Davies (all Wales), M Bayfield (Englan), M
Perego (Wales), R Wainwright (Scotland), N Back (England).
International Select - J Gallagher (New Zealand); J Olivier (South Afria), T

J Roux (South Afria); R Evans (Wales), S Fitzpatrick (New Zealand), A Skeggs
(Australia), M Tchadjian, O Roumat, M Cecillion (all France), R Straeuli (South
Afria), L Cabannes (Frane).
Referee: D Bevan (Wales).
Other results - Ardrossan Academicals 27, Stewartry 10; Wigtownshire 16, Newton

SCOTTISH Schools open their representative programme tonight at Meggetland,
where they face Scotland Under-18 in what has become an important fixture for
both sides. Important, certainly in the short term, for Scottish Schools, who
play their French counterparts next month at Goldenacre before facing Welsh
Schools at Bridgend on January 6.
This will be the first time that many of the schools' side will have
experienced playing under floodlights but Keith Yuille, the Scottish Schools
coach, thinks that this could be useful for his team. ``When we play Wales at
Bridgend it will be an evening match,'' he said.
This season's schools' team have a difficult act to follow, albeit that their
immediate predecessors achieved only one victory - the 20-18 win over Wales at
Goldenacre. But the narrow defeats by Australia (18-17) and England (19-14) and
a good showing against New Zealand all proved that Scottish Schools are now
able to compete against the best.
``We tried to play exciting rugby against these teams by attacking them and not
merely trying to contain them,'' said Yuille, whose side for the opening game
of this season has been picked ``to play an expansive game.''
He added: ``We have considerable pace in the back three, all of whom are
capable of scoring, and creativity in the centre. The difference this season is
that we do not have a big      physical presence in midfield.''
``It is a big bonus having Gordon Ross back at stand-off as well as Fergie
Gladstone and Jason White in the pack. The experience they picked up last
season from playing in six internationals will be vital for us.''
Selecting White, who was capped as a lock last season, at blindside flanker is
something of a gamble for the Schools but the George Watson's College forward
has had considerable back row experience having played No.8 while at Cults
Academy.
``It will give us another option in the lineout,'' said Yuille, who reckons
that the Schools this season will field a ``much more physical pack.''
One feature of the Schools side this season is that the squad of 22 represents
a wider geographical spread. ``We are simply looking for the best regardless of
what school they come from. The message must be to all districts is that if
they have good players then they will be selected,'' says Yuille.
Among the squad of 22 for the match tonight will be representatives from
Dunfermline High School, Queen Victoria High School, Eastwood High School and
Douglas Ewart High School. It is a welcome indication, perhaps, that schools
rugby, helped considerably by the SRU youth development programme, is again
beginning to flourish outside its more traditional boundaries.
q WORLD Cup winner Joel Stransky has had a memorable season - and that's the
way he wants it to stay against England at Twickenham tomorrow.
The Springboks have won 13 games on the spin, a run highlighted by their 15-12
triumph over New Zealand last summer when Stransky kicked the vital goal in
extra time to snatch the global crown.
``We have had a great season, but your last game is how they judge you. If we
lost against England at Twickenham it would be a big dampener for us,'' said
fly-half Stransky, who is looking forward to meeting opposite number Mike Catt.
Catt, who replaces Mr Golden Boot Rob Andrew, was rebuked by manager Jack
Rowell this week for labelling South Africa's captain Francois Pienaar ``an
average player''.

WINNING the Player of the Month award for October, Graeme Beveridge, of
Boroughmuir, is hailed as one of a number of young players reaching the highest
levels of Scottish rugby, and thus a tribute to the Scottish Rugby Union's
youth development policy. Maybe - but no tribute to his club's youth policy.
Since primary school, Beveridge has been coached, transported, fed hot-dogs by
Peebles rugby club under their long-standing commitment to youth rugby. And
just as their investment was about to pay off Beveridge, at 19, moved on.
What return on their efforts can clubs have when this happens? What incentive
is there to bring on young players, to see them mature into good footballers
only to watch as they are snapped up by senior clubs, many without a youth
section.
But why should the clubs who devote enormous resources watch their efforts
being exploited by clubs who may not have made such a commitment?
The SRU youth development policy was an initiative. It was taken up by clubs
outwith the top flight to ensure a supply of players to enable clubs to improve
their standing. Such clubs are powerless to prevent the haemorrhage of their
best young players.
Control must be exercised over the movement of young players when avaricious
senior clubs are sweeping up all the available talent.
The Scottish Rugby Clubs Association, which represents the majority of national
league clubs, believes that a system of registration of players is essential.
Clubs should decide which players to register, from age 16 upwards, with a
limit on the number aged 18 or over. Only registered players would be eligible
for championship and cup matches. If a club wished to introduce a new player to
its squad, an existing member would be de-registered.
The effect of this would be three-fold: a club with a youth policy would hold
the registrations of its young players; it would prevent clubs from amassing
large numbers of players; and it would enable de-registered players to move to
another club where a first-team place was more certain.
Players would be registered and re-registered annually and no player could
register for another club without the agreement of the club holding his
registration. There would be criteria under which players could change clubs,
the most obvious being change of residence or on taking up tertiary education.
However, any young player, ie up to age 21, who no longer satisfied the
conditions for such a transfer, would automatically be re-registered with his
original club.
No club will stand in the way of talented players who wish to try their hand at
a higher level. A club would voluntarily allow a player to transfer his
registration but for players between 16 and 21 this should attract mandatory
compensation to the holding club for its investment in its youth. A fee might
be negotiated for older players.
There should be a qualifying period of, say, three or four months following
change of registration. There should be a fallow period from April to July,
during which no registrations would be permitted, and no part of this period
would count towards the qualifying period. If registration was effective on 1
October each year, it would enable club squads to settle at the start of each
season but would allow players to be released or to move early in the season.
Where do the SRU stand?
Accused. It is widespread practice for young players selected for
representative squads at age-group levels to find themselves being approached
by squad officials, often appointed by the SRU, to move to their (more senior)
club. For too long the SRU has turned a blind eye to this abuse of position and
the poaching of players more generally. It must act if youth development is not
to be blighted.
And condemned. The SRU has threatened to throw clubs who cannot fulfil fixtures
out of the championship and has questioned whether such clubs should
participate in the leagues. But loss of players to more senior clubs
contributes, or indeed may be the primary cause of, these clubs' problems.
It has been suggested that clubs in the championship should meet certain
criteria. One would be to require all such clubs to have established and
credible mini and midi rugby sections at all levels by 2000.

BADMINTON
SCOTTISH Badminton Union chief executive Anne Smillie has hit out at what she
describes as a ``nonsense'' draw the International Federation has imposed upon
the Scottish Open.
``Players like former All-England Champion Ib Frediriksen have been asked to
pre-qualify for the men's singles,'' said Smillie. ``Meanwhile players who are
not up to his standard have been allowed into the main draw.''
The irrational state of affairs is a direct result of the IBF's new
computerised draw system, which only recognises players' current positions in
the world rankings, regardless of how many tournaments in which they have
played.
Former Scottish Open winners Maria and Catrine Bengtsson of Sweden have not
been seeded in the women's doubles, although they are the experts' tip to lift
the title at the Kelvin Hall next week.
Former national champion Jim Mailer of Stirling heads a section of the men's
singles dominated by fellow Scots. Five out of seven players in his section are
compatriots.

BASKETBALL
GREAT Britain and Scotland internationalist Bobby Archibald, who officially
retired at least for the third time at the end of last season, could be in the
frame for an appearance for Livingston Bulls in their first match of the season
with arch-rivals Edinburgh Burger Kings at Meadowbank tonight.
The 39-year-old former Paisley player could be the man to counter Kings'
leading scorer, Derek Frame.
Archibald helped Bulls to another cup and league double last season, then said:
``That's it, definitely no more.''
But, with fellow GB cap Iain Maclean unavailable, club secretary Archibald, a
6ft 6in centre, stepped in to help the team against Edzell two weeks ago, and
scored 10 points, though they went down to their first defeat for two years.

SCOTLAND, despite wins in four of their six matches yesterday, still find
themselves trailing leaders England by nine points going into the penultimate
day of the European Indoor Team Championship in Jersey.
The Scots have a total of 33 points, with England leading on 42, followed by
Wales on 40.
Scotland faced Ireland in the men's and women's singles and fours yesterday and
won three of their four matches.
Graham Robertson led the way when he beat Jeremy Henry 7-6, 7-1, 1-7, 7-4 and
then both Scottish rinks added wins.
Angus Blair's men beat Noel Graham's side 21-12, thanks to a strong finishing
burst in which the Scots turned an 11-11 scoreline into a nine-shot win, while
Jeanette Conlan's women were never behind en route to a 19-13 victory over
Dessa Baird's side.
Ireland's consolation win came from world outdoor champion Margaret Johnston,
who won in four sets against Tweedbank's Joyce Lindores. Johnston took the
opener 7-0 in just three ends but Lindores battled to a 7-5 nine-end win in the
second. Johnston took the third set 7-5, and then dominated the next to win it
7-2.
East Lothian's Robertson got back on the winning way last night, and in some
style, when he picked up the three points on offer for a straight-sets singles
win, needing just 14 ends to beat Stephen Rees 7-2, 7-3, 7-0.
``I was playing well and Stephen was struggling a bit, but the way things are
going for Scotland we need all the points we can get, and winning this one in
straight sets was definitely a bonus,'' said Robertson.
However, his team-mates in the fours failed to capitalise when they went down
24-18 to the local Jersey side.
The Scots trailed 6-4 after six ends, and then dropped 11 shots while they
picked up just 2 as Jersey went on to a comfortable win.
England edged ahead of Wales at the top of the table for the first time since
the event began last Sunday when they notched up wins last night over Jersey in
the singles and Ireland in the fours.
World champion Andy Thomson, who had to come from two sets to one down earlier
in the day to beat Guernsey's John Queripel, completed the Channel Island
double when he beat Jersey's David Le Marquand 7-4, 4-7, 7-4, 7-2.
England added the points in the fours when David Holt, Gary Smith, Greg Harlow,
and Tony Allcock notched up their second win of the day.
Last night battled to a 22-17 win over Noel Graham's Irish rink. Earlier, they
had beaten Guernsey 27-12. Results:
Men. Singles - G Robertson (Scotland) beat J Henry (Ireland) 7-6, 7-1, 1-7,
7-4; A Thomson (England) beat J Queripel (Guernsey) 3-7, 7-4, 0-7, 7-4, 7-9; S
Rees (Wales) beat D Le Marquand (Jersey) 7-1, 7-4, 4-7, 7-3; Robertson beat
Rees 7-2, 7-3, 7-0; Henry beat Queripel 7-1, 7-2, 7-6; Thomson beat D Le
Marquand 7-4, 4-7, 7-4, 7-2.
Fours - Scotland 21, Ireland 12; England 27, Guernsey 12; Wales 17, Jersey 14;
Wales beat Guernsey 34-12; England beat Ireland 22-17; Jersey beat Scotland
24-18.
Women. Singles - M Johnston (Ireland) beat J Lindores (Scotland) 7-0, 5-7, 7-5,
7-2; A Simon (Guernsey) beat J Roylance (England) 7-3, 7-6, 7-5; V Stead
(Jersey) beat R Jones (Wales) 7-4, 1-7, 7-6, 1-7, 7-1. Fours - England 23,
Guernsey 17; Scotland 19, Ireland 13; Wales 18, Jersey 18.

GRAEME Hick punched the air in jubilation last night after having scored a
superb hundred at Centurion Park, Pretoria. The Worcestershire batsman reached
the fourth century of his international career just before bad light halted
play five overs early in this first Test against the South Africans.
And when he left the field to a standing ovation, Hick had just about completed
a memorable England recovery.
His undefeated 105 - studded with 21 boundaries - helped the tourists to end
the first day on an encouraging 221 for four.
But he was by no means the only hero. Courageous captain Mike Atherton - who
shared a stand of 142 with Hick - had been the rock off which England's
fightback was launched.
Atherton gritted his teeth and withstood a near six-hour battering from South
Africa's six-pronged pace attack before falling for 78.
He had seen England slump to 64 for three but refused to budge until dismissed
two overs before the premature close of play.
Atherton was struck three times on his protective headgear, and once on the
shoulder, as Allan Donald and company tried to wear him down.
But the England skipper simply would not buckle in the face of South Africa's
pace attack after Alec Stewart, Mark Ramprakash and Graham Thorpe all had
fallen cheaply.
The early stages of this first Test between the two countries in South Africa
since 1965 had looked like turning into a nightmare for England.
But defiant opener Atherton worked his way past 50 and, with Hick's support,
led the team towards calmer waters.
England, having been put in, were facing a near non-stop diet of fast bowling,
and while South Africa could talk about the necessity of playing to their
strengths, it hardly made for easy watching.
A spinner - the very occasional Gary Kirsten - was finally introduced for the
seventy-seventh over of the day. But until then, the nearest the home team got
to some variety was when captain Hansie Cronje brought himself on as bowler No.
6 - and even he sends down medium pace.
At lunch, however, South Africa had been cock-a-hoop, though England's problems
at that stage were mostly of their own making.
Stewart, with 6, could consider himself a shade unlucky to fall in the tenth
over, pulling left-armer Brett Schultz towards backward square leg where Craig
Matthews, diving right, held an acrobatic one-handed catch.
But the shot was not properly controlled and South Africa are famous for their
fine fielding.
Ramprakash's exit for 9, which left England tottering on 36 for two, was even
more disappointing.
The Middlesex batsman had looked composed for half an hour. But, as too often
before, he let himself down - playing a loose shot outside off stump against
Donald to present keeper Dave Richardson with his one hundredth catch at this
level.
It comes as no surprise to learn that Richardson has never achieved a Test
stumping. Let's face it, he doesn't get much chance.
Thorpe, on 13, was the last of the morning victims, departing during the final
over of the session.
Shaun Pollock, the 22-year-old debut maker, produced a good delivery that left
Thorpe just enough to clip the outside edge and give Richardson victim No 101.
Atherton had made 34 by lunch and he went on to pass 50 for the thirty-fourth
time in his ninety-seventh Test innings.
Hick overtook him after tea but needed one slice of luck. On 67, the
Worcestershire batsman drove a gentle return catch to Matthews, but the
shin-high chance was spilled.
Despite that blemish, Hick's innings was full of confidence and his final
mission of the day was to help Atherton see off the second new ball.
If ever a man deserved to bat through the day, it was Atherton. But the third
over of the new ball finally brought his downfall.
Pollock banged in a short delivery, Atherton could only fend it off to gully
and Donald held a simple catch.
Atherton had been at the crease for 341 minutes while scoring 78 and leading
England to 206 for four.
It was vital the tourists did not waste his hard work - and Hick soon completed
an excellent century to underpin that effort. He reached his ton by cutting
Donald for his twentieth boundary. Scoreboard:

GLASGOW League cricket clubs were celebrating last night after Western Union
officials rubber-stamped a proposal to admit eight city sides, and Dumfries
from the Borders, into a second division from next season. The decision, taken
at the Union's AGM, wiped out more than 100 years of tradition.
Helensburgh secretary Barry Williams said: ``This is great news and a fantastic
incentive for the new second division clubs to improve their standards.'' GHK's
retiring skipper Jim Forrest added: ``Glasgow clubs have shown in cup
competitions that they can hold their own in one-off situations. But this is a
whole new challenge."
Union officials had hoped to have a 10-club lower division with promotion and
relegation from next season. But their plans were hit for six when Ayrshire
opted to join the new Scottish League. Last night's meeting agreed to put
promotion on hold.

KIBREET can underline trainer Philip Hobbs's talents with victory in the
Manicou Chase at Ascot today. A move to the West Country has revitalised the
gelding who showed ability in his younger days and was once described as ``the
new Barnbrook Again'' by his first trainer, David Elsworth.
The eight-year-old served notice that he was about to start fulfilling his
promise when second to Big Matt on his debut for Hobbs last spring. And there
was no mistaking the quality of his reappearance in a competitive event at
Chepstow earlier this month.
Ridden from the front, he had the race won a long way out and strolled to a
12-length triumph.
Kibreet looks to have left his days as a modest performer behind and Hobbs has
clearly found the key to him. He can follow up this afternoon on a course where
front-runners are often very hard to catch.
Silver Groom can land another useful prize for trainer Reg Akehurst in the
closing hurdle. The five-year-old has been a money-spinner on the Flat, gaining
his biggest success in the William Hill Cup at Goodwood in July. There are big
races to be won with him over hurdles judged on the ease with which he landed
the odds at Sandown on his reappearance a fortnight ago.
Last season's jumping problems look to have been ironed out and he could well
develop into a leading contender for January's big race at Leopardstown for
which this is a trial.
Large Action is the clear choice on form in the Ascot Hurdle - he has been
placed in the last two Champion Hurdles yet carries bottom weight here.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY:
PAULINE Robertson, the Scottish captain, yesterday helped salvage a point for
Great Britain in their opening match of the Olympic qualifying tournament
against Canada, who were expected to be one of the weaker sides in the Cape
Town event.
The Canadians, who were short of attacking ideas, spent most of the 70 minutes
directing their attentions towards erecting a defensive barrier, but while it
won them a point in a 1-1 draw, it did nothing to enhance the reputation of the
sport.
Despite their reluctance to attack Great Britain, it was Canada who opened the
scoring in 24 minutes when Tammy Holt could hardly believe her luck when a
clearance from the British keeper, Jo Thompson, went straight to her stick.
Holt was left with an easy task to score, but Canada's advantage was
short-lived.
Robertson, as usual a source of influence to the British side, forced the
equaliser five minutes later, and for the remainder of an easily forgotten game
were camped inside Canadian territory - but to no avail.
Britain, who started the match with three Scots in the side, Roberston, Susan
MacDonald, and Susan Fraser, and then introduced Rhona Simpson and Diane
Renilson as substitutes, will see this scoreline as a point dropped.
It was envisaged that Great Britain would struggle to finish among the five
qualifiers for Atlanta, but now the task facing them will be even more
formidable.
Argentina, World Cup finalists, are unlikely to encounter similar problems for
they are now the clear leaders, having beaten Korea 1-0 with a goal by Cecilia
Pagnoni, to become the first side to register a second successive victory.
Results:
Great Britain 1, Canada 1; Argentina 1, Korea 0.
Today's games - South Africa v Holland, China v Canada.

MEN'S HOCKEY
WHEN Jimmy Cox, Kevin Squire, Graham Wylie and Davy Stott left Menzieshill at
the start of the season, the future did not look bright for the Taysiders, but
they have responded to the challenge with the usual determination, writes
Joseph Dillon.
They go into the final series of games before the mid-season break tomorrow
against MIM just one point off the pace which has been set by defending
champions Grange. Indeed, it's not in the realms of fantasy to suggest that
when hostilities resume again in February, they will be top of the table.
The Menzieshill revival has taken the game by surprise - as well as the club
itself. Bruce Cuthill, their player coach, joked: ``It is because we got rid of
some dead wood.'' But in reality, he might not be too far off the mark.
The club has been forced to give youth its chance - like 17-year-old Neil
Devine, who has come into the side and established himself, while men on the
fringe, Chris Anderson and Ross Yule, now seem to accept greater responsibility.
Another explanation for the good run of Menzieshill is that on the opening day
of the season, they defeated arch- rivals MIM by 4-0.
Their confidence received a tremendous boost, and they have not looked back.
The teams meet for a second time tomorrow at Maryfield.
The remaining games should be clear cut, provided of course Grange don't allow
Insights Inverleith's reputation for producing the unexpected get to them.

NEW Ferrari team-mates Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine pleaded for patience
yesterday in their bid to put the Italian team back on top of Formula 1.
They have paid big money to lure world champion Schumacher from Benetton and
Ulsterman Irvine from Jordan in an attempt to bring back the glory days.
But Schumacher, winner of the world title for the last two years, was careful
to make no promises after his first appearance as a Ferrari driver.
``Expectations will certainly be high,'' he said after driving 20 laps in a car
powered by Ferrari's new V10 engine at their Maranello base. ``But like any
team, we will need time to work together and grow together. I'm sure the
potential is there for Ferrari to be world champions, but it will take a
while.''
His new team-mate Irvine was also cautious, saying: ``Do not expect miracles.''
Schumacher's signing was part of a costly shake-up by Ferrari, who have been
living in the shadow of Benetton and Williams over the last two seasons.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry must hope he is not 12 months too late with the
launch of his new coaching book - ``Snooker Masterclass'' - during the Royal
Liver Assurance UK Championship, which starts in Preston today.
In 1994, the 26-year-old Scot compiled seven century breaks in 12 frames
against Irish stablemate Ken Doherty. The previous year against John Parrott in
the semi-finals he chalked up five tons in seven frames.
Now he hopes to repeat those extraordinary feats and successfully defend the
title. Facing Hendry over the best of 17 frames when the #380,000 tournament
gets under way is young compatriot Jamie Burnett of Hamilton.
q ALAN Burnett's hopes of adding the Embassy IBSF World Amateur Championship to
the World Junior crown he collected earlier in the year stayed on course
yesterday when he won his latest group qualifying tie in Bristol. The Ayrshire
teenager made it six wins out of six with a 4-3 victory over Jonathan Nelson of
Northern Ireland.
