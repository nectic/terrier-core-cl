Life on the Street often has similarities to cast members' own lives,
as Jack Webster discovers
ALF Roberts, former Mayor of Weatherfield, was no sooner crowing about
his OBE in the Honours list than he found himself under suspicion for
the missing funds at the Town Hall.
However, the real-life Bryan Mosley was in relaxed mood when we met
for a coffee in the shadow of the Rovers.
Bryan, who will be 64 next month, grew up in Leeds -- ''in
circumstances very similar to Coronation Street,'' he says -- and first
appeared in the famous soap just a few months after it started. He had
spent his National Service in the RAF and was posted to Scotland, where
he gained his early experience of acting at the Byre Theatre in St
Andrews.
Bryan has seen it all before and says quite frankly that characters in
the street do get fed-up with doing the same thing over and over again.
''But they take a look at their bank account and know there is a
choice to make,'' he says.
He also believes that Coronation Street now puts too much emphasis on
story-lining and not enough on the characters, as it used to be. He
clearly thinks they could make more of his own Alf Roberts character but
is at least glad that his stand-in mayoress, Betty Turpin, has recently
been allowed a break from her hot-pot service at the Rovers and given a
touch of romance.
Bryan and his real-life wife, who have six children, have a home in
Yorkshire and a flat in Manchester.
Does he have much in common with Alf Roberts?
''Not much, except that we are both too fat,'' he says. ''And three
years ago I overdid things and had a heart attack.''
As Alf Roberts, the pompous mayor, he was invited to take part in the
real Lord Mayor of London's Show, riding in Lily Langtry's carriage. It
surprised him that Granada Television made nothing of that opportunity
for publicity.
Ah well, it was time for rehearsals. Alf had to sort out this
festering scandal which could endanger his OBE.

Jack Webster takes a stroll down Coronation Street and discovers there
is more than fiction to the community which has captured the hearts of
viewers across the country for 35 years
IT WAS mid-morning in Weatherfield and I had Coronation Street to
myself. A knock at the door of the Rovers Return brought no response.
Life had not yet stirred for Britain's most famous community so I
contented myself with peering in at the window of Denise's hair salon,
strolling past Derek and Mavis's little residence and down to Rita's
Kabin.
The Corner Shop is directly across the street and the garage is
discreetly tucked in behind the Kabin, all neatly compact and in
slightly smaller scale than it looks on television. The buildings are
solid brick right enough but nothing is filmed in their interiors.
In reality, that brick wall you see at the end of the street conceals
the spacious Stage One, where most of the interior filming takes place
-- three episodes every week to hold its peerless place as the most
remarkable and enduring piece of television this country has ever seen.
At the other side of that brick wall I looked out from the children's
room (complete with blackboard and teddy bears, where the youngsters in
the show are tutored according to law) and watched the cast arrive.
An open-topped Mercedes swung into the Granada car park. Even from a
distance I knew it could only be Mike Baldwin. He looked exactly
himself. And so it was with everyone at Coronation Street.
Audrey Roberts drove up in an E-reg banger, Jack and Vera Duckworth
strolled past with a cheery greeting, Reg Holdsworth's dreaded
mother-in-law, the elderly Maud, came in with the sweep of a most
gracious lady, followed by her daughter, the long-suffering Maureen, who
turned out to be one of the surprises in reality -- a disarmingly
attractive woman.
While they headed for the Green Room, where lines are rehearsed and
social chit-chat exchanged, I was reaching the fourth floor of Granada
Television headquarters to meet the lady who masterminds this national
institution.
Sue Pritchard, producer of Coronation Street, sits behind the desk
where the buck truly stops. She is the down-to-earth lady who must cope
with the traumas of losing Julie Goodyear from her role as Bet Gilroy at
The Rovers and Ken Morley from his clownish character of Reg Holdsworth.
She must know how to deal with young Simon Gregson, better known as
Steve McDonald, who followed earlier indiscretions by admitting to a
#500-a-week cocaine habit.
The careful handling of personalities who become celebrities beyond
the level of their actual talent calls for a special talent in itself.
Indeed, in reviewing the 35 years of Coronation Street and trying to
assess its possible lifetime -- will it reach 50 years, even 100? -- you
realise that destruction would come most likely from the inside.
So who is this lady with her hand on the tiller? And, even more
fascinating than the high-jinks of the stars, how do they put this
remarkable show together?
Ms Pritchard, from South Wales, arrived at Granada 25 years ago, after
a business course, and became secretary to the producer of Coronation
Street.
She was then a production assistant on series like Brideshead
Revisited before scaling the ladder to the commanding role of producer.
''Coronation Street has 15 script-writers and three story-liners,''
she explains. ''Every four months I chair a long-term story conference,
where we all get together, including the archivist, who must remind us
of what happened in the past. Our purpose is to talk about how the
stories will run over the next four months.
''Then every three weeks we have an ordinary story conference, again
with the same people, but now we are talking about the next nine
episodes. We film three weeks in advance.
''We follow an agenda which picks up from the previous nine episodes.
So we know where we are; and from the long-term conference we know the
general direction in which we are going.
''The writers play the most important role because they come up with
ideas. That doesn't mean that others don't have an input. I tend to play
devil's advocate because stories can pass through fairly easily unless
someone is there to say 'Ah, but . . . '
''So we have a healthy debate which can become quite argumentative but
it can be fun as well. There's a lot of concentration involved and you
come out of those conferences feeling whacked.''
Not unnaturally, the scriptwriters hold a lot of sway in Coronation
Street. Writers like Adele Rose have been there for a long time and
personify the continuity essential to a programme like this.
The three story-liners take the accumulated ideas of the conference
and go off to break it all down, scene by scene.
''I decide which nine writers will write the next nine episodes,''
says Sue Pritchard. ''They do a complete episode each. I read the
scripts and sometimes think 'This was not the attitude of the last
episode'. So there can be hiccups in continuity.
''New characters are the most difficult because, until they are
established, different writers can see them in different ways.
''Personally, I look on it all as a high-speed train. It is the
producer's responsibility to see the train stays on the track and
doesn't lose any passengers, heads in the right direction and doesn't
get shunted off down a siding.
''When I come back from a holiday I have to run to keep on track
myself, reading all the scripts I've missed.''
As Coronation Street has developed a character of its own, what is the
enduring element which keeps it at the top?
''I think the essential ingredient is optimism,'' says Pritchard.
''Even with darker stories, there is always the hint of a light at the
end of the tunnel. I was watching a recent episode, not yet seen, which
was so moving that I cried. By the end, however, I was hysterical.
Research over the 35 years has shown that we have kept up to date.
''One of the successes, I think, is that you can be away and miss an
episode and still catch up quite easily. Elsewhere in television, if you
miss one you are more inclined to stop watching.''
The story-lines must take account of real-life circumstances, like the
cancer of Ann Kilbride (Deirdre), for which a few optional routes had to
be left open. Then Sally Webster was having a real-life baby.
As if natural circumstances were not enough, along came the recent
bombshells of Bet Gilroy and Reg Holdsworth wanting to leave. In all
truth, the role of Reg has been largely derailed by removing him from
his supermarket job, with a knock-on effect on Curly Watts, his
assistant, an excellent character who deserves better.
Bet wants to spread her wings, an ambition fulfilled by Arthur Lowe,
who successfully became Captain Mainwaring of Dad's Army, but by very
few others. Joanna Lumley and Ben Kingsley were out of Coronation Street
before they were entrenched. So it is a risk which needs careful
thought.
Pritchard is well used to keeping an even keel when individual egos
threaten to unbalance it.
''If you have a cast of 31 main characters you are bound to have
problems periodically,'' she concedes. ''But we have a fairly open show
and if people are not happy they can come and talk about it. I like to
think my door is always open.
''Naturally we have a lot of press interest in the cast and that's
what presents our main problem. Every now and again I have an actor in
distress about something which is in the papers. Sometimes that kind of
interest is a complete intrusion and the pressures can be distracting.
''What upsets me is when they print leaks about the story-line. We get
letters from people who are furious at being told in advance. 'We don't
want to know!' is what they say.''
Rumours about the stars and contract rows are another annoyance for
Pritchard. But people do leave -- and some do misbehave. The cocaine
problem of Simon Gregson is among the latest to bring the show into
disrepute and the word is that he is on his last chance.
Pritchard tells me: ''Of course we're never happy when these things
happen. So Simon and I have had meaningful conversations on the
matter.'' She was just getting to grips with reports of another personal
problem, concerning the lad who plays young Nicky Platt.
Others get on with a balanced life, like Barbara Knox (Rita), who
still pursues her career as a singer, and Bill Tarmie (Jack Duckworth)
who records with a more than passable singing voice.
Those who have come from the south tend to retain a home base around
London, while working from a flat in the Manchester area.
So I wandered down by the Green Room, where the inhabitants of
Coronation Street were coming and going, rehearsing their lines and
waiting for the Wednesday afternoon technical rehearsal, when the crew
work out the various camera angles.
Off-set location shots are often filmed on Sunday, with street shots
on Monday, leaving Tuesday and Wednesday for rehearsal. That means the
actual filming has to be done on Thursday and Friday, lasting for as
long as it takes to secure all three episodes for a forthcoming week.
It was lunchtime when I reached the Green Room. As a thunderstorm
broke over Manchester, Jim McDonald arrived in his car, running in from
the rain with an Irish expletive about the weather. Liz was already
there. So were Bet and Rita, Des and Curly. Gail has a more cultured
voice than the soap suggests.
Martin Platt, looking every inch himself, called out: ''Who wants a
Harry Ramsden then?'' And off he went for four fish suppers. Steve
McDonald gave me a courteous greeting, rather a nice lad in contrast to
his objectionable character.
As they mixed in an atmosphere of good-natured tension, I wandered
back to the street itself, a kind of memory lane for 35 years of my own
life. I thought of great characters who lived here long ago -- Ena
Sharples, Annie Walker and Jack, Elsie Tanner, Albert Tatlock, Hilda
Ogden and her beloved lay-about husband, Stan.
Now there are only two survivors from 1960 -- Ken Barlow and Emily
Bishop, the devoted assistant of Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe) in those
early days of the haberdashery.
I was thinking, too, of Tony Warren, the young staff writer at Granada
who dreamed up the whole idea of Coronation Street, but later ran into
personal problems and was for long persona non grata around Granada.
He lives in Manchester to this day and Pritchard says fondly: ''We are
still in touch with Tony. After all, we wouldn't be here without him.''
I turned the corner at the end of Coronation Street and ran into a
sight which stopped me in my tracks -- a simple little plot with a
gravestone to Stan Ogden: Died 1984, aged 62.
And I thought of Hilda's flying ducks and knew that there was more to
this street than a fiction. However the cynics may scoff, it is a
reflection of our own lives.
Through all those years I had postponed a visit to Coronation Street,
lest it would break an illusion. But, if anything, it strengthened a
reality. And I knew at that moment that I would not wish it to end in my
own lifetime.

WITH the recent unbuttoning of her blouse to lure Steve McDonald into
bed, young Vicky injected an unaccustomed jet of steam into Coronation
Street.
But for the young actress herself, 18-year-old Chloe Newsome, it
brings an added concern about her personal safety. Illustrating the
public proclivity for interpreting television fiction as fact, Chloe has
already experienced hostility in her private life.
''People shout and swear at you in the street and I have been
threatened to my face,'' says the charming young lady who arrived as the
clean-cut, well-bred granddaughter of Alex Gilroy but has endangered the
romance of young McDonald and hairdresser Fiona.
So how does a girl like Chloe Newsome from Sheffield land a part in
Coronation Street? ''I was dancing as a child and that was all I wanted
to do, never having thought about acting,'' she explains. ''But my
dancing school closed and I had the option of drama lessons. From that,
I had a part in the television show Children's Ward, which was written
by Paul Abbot, who is also one of the writers of Coronation Street. He
was the person who spotted me.''
0  ''As for the Street itself, it can be a strain working with the
same people all the time and some do argue and fall out. But we are also
a close-knit community.''
And with that, the personable Chloe was off to become Vicky once more
-- and steam up the sets with some of that recent hot-blooded scheming.

* THAT small band of writers who shape up the story-line of Coronation
Street has a Scottish connection in Marina O'Loughlin, from the Hyndland
district of Glasgow.
After Edinburgh University, Marina went south to work as an
advertising copywriter but responded to a workshop, in which the
Coronation Street bosses were looking for future writing talent. Out of
800 applicants Marina, already a fan of the program, became one of the
chosen few.
''Those story conferences are a very broad brush-stroke,'' she says,
''and we take away what has been discussed and turn it into the next
nine episodes. The actual volume of story-line writing for each episode
amounts to about four pages of A4 size.''
Story-liners tend to aspire to script-writing. They all contribute to
the shape of Coronation Street and one of Marina O'Loughlin's more
recent claims to fame is that she was the one who dreamed up the idea of
giving Reg Holdsworth a hair-piece!

TAKING the plunge has paid dividends for former Royal Navy diver
Robert Howard, who received a degree in Mechanical Engineering from
Strathclyde University yesterday at a ceremony attended by the
Chancellor, Lord Tombs of Brailes (in glasses), and the Principal,
Professor John P Arbuthnott.
Mr Howard, 35, of Gartmore in Stirlingshire, worked as a diver in the
North Sea to support his wife Annette and daughters Ruth, 5, and Rachel,
2, while he took his degree. His hobby, mountaineering, takes him in yet
another direction.

NOW is the time when everyone remembers the 1945 Labour Government
with rapturous gratitude. In fact its members were a bunch of English
duds. Looked at without the benefit of pink spectacles their
achievements depended on the Celtic fringe and nothing else. Without the
Celts they were worse than nothing. Their great glory, the National
Health Service, was entirely the work of two men, the Welshman Aneurin
Bevan, and a Scottish doctor and novelist called A J Cronin. Beyond that
their only achievement was the release of India and Pakistan from
carrying the burden of the white man on their back, which was the
British Empire.
Believe me, the Labour Government would have kept India if it could.
It kept the rest of the Empire as a form of outdoor relief for the sons
of the ruling classes, and even tried to extend it in Africa. It kept
the Royal Navy east of Suez, posturing madly, defending no-one. Clement
Attlee, now nearly canonised by the Labour Party, kept nuclear
experiments going without the sanction of Parliament until Britain had
the bomb. Beside American and Russian power it was no more than the bark
of a white mouse. But it kept Britain at the Security Council table,
pretending to be a great power.
A great power! These English delusions could have been scrapped in
1945, at a time when the whole world was fed up with war. Instead, they
were carefully fostered and nurtured by an iron bureaucracy centred in
London. Not another whisper was allowed from the Celtic fringe of Wales
and Scotland from where came the warm human ideas of peace and equality.
In both countries we were always opposed to the military. We've both
suffered too much from them.
Yet the 1945 Labour Government kept more men and women under arms than
any other peacetime government in British history. Up and down the
country and across the world National Servicemen and women lay on their
bunks counting the days to their demob. I was one of them. Not a
National Serviceman but a young schoolboy, daft enough to have
volunteered. I was not then old enough to realise that the Scottish
military tradition exists to conscript young Scots by pomp or poverty to
march through England's wars on to Scottish cenotaphs. We suffer from it
still.
I am enough of a red to know that war is waste. The waste goes on
whether there is the noise of battle or just the absurd sound of
soldiers shouting at one another between bouts of exchanging salutes. A
few years ago crowds of English jingoists sang Land of Hope and Glory on
the Devonport quays as the fleet sailed for the Falklands, and we are
still paying the piper for that song, although we in Scotland never
called the tune. Last year Malcolm Rifkind overspent #800m on a naval
frivolity at Faslane, and has just been promoted as a reward. In case
you don't know #800m is enough to keep eight universities going for a
whole year. Labour will blame the Tories, but Labour set the pace in
1945.
To finance its military folly Attlee's Government borrowed billions
from anyone who had it to lend. It pawned its children's future and our
own. Politicians talk of the miracle of Germany as though there is
something uncanny about the way defeated Germany became a great
industrial power. Are they daft? Do they not know that the Germans spent
every penny they could borrow on new plant for a new age, while we had
to make do and mend with any clapped out old tools we could lay our
hands on.
My home town is Paisley, my countrymen live in places like Ferguslie
Park, and they live with no hope because in 1945, when there was a
chance for decency, a Labour Government went in for the futile business
of financing England's pretence to military greatness.
I belong to a dying breed. I belong to that generation which actually
thought the war meant something, that 1945 was the great divide, and
that since then everything had changed. Nothing has changed. We still
get people like Peter Fraser rejected at the polls, returning via the
House of Lords to hold power over us. We get Lord Lindsay, never elected
so he could never be rejected, vaulting into office for no other reason
than who his dad is. Have you heard of his dad? Neither have I.
Remember how Labour would abolish the House of Lords? Remember fair
shares for all? Remember the promises of equality and that the career
would be open to the talents? Remember nuclear disarmament? For the
sound of a warlike song we have lost all that. In material things our
plant and factories are the cause of mirth in Europe. Look round
Scotland and make a list of what has gone from us in the past 20 years,
and how little has come back.
That's the price of the militarism that Attlee chose in 1945, and that
no Labour Government since has dared to change. Our society is static.
We still have special universities for the sons and daughters of the
rich. All the inequalities of a class system imported from England are
still with us. Now we have Tony Blair who is going to keep a class and
wealth system that ordinary decent people thought would be abolished in
1945. We have another Attlee, and with him are gone all our aspirations.
There is nothing wrong with Welsh and Scottish working-class
aspirations. There is a rude fairness about them which has its roots in
a common religious tradition, so different from England's that they call
us non-conformist. In that lack of conformity I see hope. I do not
believe all is lost. We have still something to give. We can do better
on our own, and we still may. We must hold on until our voice can be
heard. But to suggest that there was something basically right in the
1945 Labour Government is frighteningly wrong. I saw the 1945
Government. It smothered every radical principle we had.

THE Tories need all the support they can get for their ill-thought
out, divisive, cheapskate scheme to provide #1100 vouchers for childcare
for four-year-olds.
This scheme does nothing for people in areas where childcare provision
is non-existent or at a very low level (as it is in Highland region).
Clearly the private sector would never fill the enormous gap that exists
here in the Highlands. Childcare is not a viable business proposition,
and never should be treated as such.
A voucher scheme does not produce well thought out, well funded
pre-school education, nor does it enhance 0-5-year-old provision
generally.
It does not do anything to improve the situation in the Highlands
where there appears to be no policy, no co-ordination of local authority
services, and no funding. Indeed Highland region's policy seems to be to
close nurseries, as in Drumnadrochit.
A little light was shed on the real intent behind the voucher scheme
by Gillian Shephard and by Michael Forsyth who both indicated that the
Government is to revise childcare legislation.
Mr Forsyth clearly wanted to reduce legislation. This can only mean
one thing -- a reduction in standards for premises and staffing for
childcare provision and a reduction in the regulatory powers of local
authorities. The thin end of a wedge indeed.
Childcare provision should be the right of all children and parents.
Children are everybody's future. All available information points
towards the overall benefits of good, comprehensive childcare provision.
I bet if men had babies we would have nurseries on every street corner!

I READ your articles (July 7) on the proposed nursery vouchers with
dismay and indignation on behalf of myself, my staff, and my colleagues
in the Scottish independent childcare sector.
The majority of the critics quoted appear to be so bogged down in
political quagmire that they have been unable to give the scheme due
consideration. While it is by no means a panacea to the problems it is,
however, a step forward welcomed by the independent sector and, I'm
sure, by the many parents who use these nurseries.
Bearing in mind that the mere existence of independent nurseries
automatically allows proprietors, staff, and parents to generate taxes
which already subsidise the groups protesting most strongly, I'm
delighted that for once this sector of the community will be eligible on
an equal basis.
Your article quoted a satisfaction and preference rating for various
sectors which I would suggest could be somewhat biased. Of course
everyone would prefer the best quality childcare and education free of
charge.
The Scottish Parent Teacher Council suggests that ''there will be a
proliferation of farms for four-year-olds all over the place'' and ''you
run the risk of having nurseries packing four-year-olds in for the sake
of money''. Might I suggest that the SPTC find out how the independent
sector actually operates?
There will be no plethora of nursery farms. There will be no ''packing
in''. All nursery provision in the independent sector, excluding only
the nursery-school divisions of independent schools, have to be
registered with pre-5 services of the regional council concerned.
In order to attain this registration they have to comply with many
regulations determining the number and age range of children allowed on
the premises based on a square-footage calculation. They have to have at
least a minimum quality of equipment available and a quality curriculum
available to all their children.
They also have to have a much higher staff/children ratio than the
local authority sector (40 four-year-olds in a local authority nursery
require four members of staff -- the same children in a private nursery
require seven members of staff).
There is a myth, which your articles support, that the quality in the
independent sector is not as high as in the local authority sector. The
reality is quite different. It is true to say that there are inferior
services around but they apply equally to all sectors of childcare.
It is also implied that the independent sector is staffed only by
unqualified but caring individuals. This again is a myth.
The reality is that these nurseries are staffed by highly competent
and dedicated individuals whose backgrounds range from the professions,
primary teachers, nursery nurses, playgroup leaders, childminders,
nurses, etc, etc.
Who could dispute the wealth of experience available to the children
in the independent sector?

WHEN men like John Macleod bare their soul in articles like In a pool
of silence all time stops (July 4), there are usually two predictable
reactions.
One is the immediate recognition that we have all at one time or
another passed through similar experiences to John Macleod and also the
recognition that it takes guts to go public with such feelings. To do so
indicates a sincerity and humility not many of us possess.
The other predictable reaction is that others will take the very
weaknesses and failures which have been confessed and use them to score
cheap points against the confessor, as has been done by Gavin Kenny
(July 8). Such an attitude is to be despised. Gavin Kenny is no
gentleman.
I may not always agree with Thomas McLaughlin (July 5) but he has
recognised, as I and many others do, the humility and courage of John
Macleod.
As an avid reader -- particularly of many religious journals -- I have
no hesitation in saying that he is indeed a master of his craft. I
cannot think of anyone on the British religious scene who is better.
Yet his other articles, particularly on Harris and the other islands,
are like a breath of fresh air sweeping down from the Highland glens to
rejuvenate we Lowland folk.

MARTIN Smith is talking through his wig (A question of trials without
tribulations, July 8). It is bad enough to have to suffer the
condescension of English barristers at what they perceive is inferior
American jurisprudence, without Scottish lawyers joining in.
O J Simpson's dignified attire or the unrelated eponymous holiday
cruises have nothing at all to do with the court proceedings. There is
no ''courtroom chaos''. Whatever faults Judge Ito has, indifference to
the dignity of his court is not one of them.
The medieval trappings apart, I can find no significant differences
between it and a Scottish court though, of course, the American love of
free speech means there is no sub judice rule. We have had our share of
miscarriages of justice so as not to be complacent about our system.
One thing the trial has demonstrated: no evidence is proven until it
has been tested by cross-examination. OJ Simpson's guilt or innocence
may have been decided by the media's insatiable curiosity and their
recording of police procedure at the scene of the crime.

I MUST comment on John Macleod's article asserting that widespread
provision of condoms increases the risk of unwanted pregnancies (July
11).
First, he assumes that condoms can reasonably be obtained from
chemists or doctors. Any youngsters contemplating sex, however, will
know this is not the case. The wagging tongues of local people make
news, especially scandal, travel faster than the Press and Journal could
ever hope to achieve.
Secondly, he says that condoms ''require a measure of skill'', outwith
the competence of ''children in the blundering heat of a first fumble''.
In today's society, young people have more readily available information
from a variety of sources (friends, magazines, and even schools
themselves) than ever before on the whys and wherefores, and even the
pros and cons, of sex. I suspect that, sex being the taboo subject it
was, things were different in Mr Macleod's day.
There is little mileage in persistently harking back to the
suppressive society which John Macleod covets. ''Keep it for lifelong
and faithful marriage,'' he croons.
The modern teenager is perfectly well aware that marriage is not at
all sensible when the two parties have no idea if they're sexually
compatible. This has been accepted as a reality of modern life by an
institution which can hardly be described as ''permissive'', the Church
of Scotland.
It is time for some sense in this debate. Highland Health Board, no
matter how conservative their approach, cannot possibly shape the
attitudes of the region's young people. The best it can hope to do is
shape its policies to reduce the risk of HIV and unwanted pregnancy, and
providing free condoms is the best method of achieving these ends.
I may not have John Macleod's experience of the Highlands, but I
expect that my views are more in tune with school life in the 1990s.

THE real question arising from John Macleod's article, Condom crusade
insults teenagers (July 11), is not whether increased availability of
condoms will result in mass teenage pregnancies in the Highlands, but
whether or not this self-confessed virgin is really the best-qualified
person to lecture to the rest of us on the subject.
The Highland Health Board's approach to contraception and teenage
pregnancy may be simplistic but it is far more understanding of
teenagers than John Macleod will ever be. With his moral absolutism and
his ''abandon all hope ye who enter'' rhetoric, he gives far more insult
to the good sense of Highland teenagers.
Incidentally, some time ago he was very keen to let The Herald's
readers know that he was a virgin. I trust that when his unhappy
situation changes, if indeed it ever does, he will let us all know that
he has fallen from grace. If need be the names can be changed to protect
the innocent.

JOHN R STEPHEN accuses me of irresponsibility and purveying hokum by
pointing out a palpable and self-evident truth, namely that the
iniquitous recommendations of the Sheehy inquiry were binned, not
because of pressure solely from the police staff associations, but by
the clamour and representations of Members of Parliament and other
non-police bodies (July 10).
I repeat, the police staff associations have never, either
individually or together, had the clout to divert a determined
Government from the reforming path. Mr Stephen's quote (or misquote) of
your own James Freeman in support of his false belief in the police
staff associations' capabilities deserves only the comment that one
should not believe all that one reads in newspapers.
Mr Stephen seriously doubts that I have ever experienced traditional
beat policing. I have been performing just such traditional duties for
20 years now, and reckon myself to be somewhat of an authority,
certainly more than Mr Stephen.
But it is in his, I suspect deliberate, misunderstanding of the terms
of a police pension that he goes most awry. Yes, I will retire before
the age of 50, God willing, with two-thirds salary, but to get that
benefit I have been compelled to pay 11% of gross salary as a
contribution.
In this harsh world, you get nothing for nothing; if Mr Stephen cares
to contribute to a pension scheme at the rate I do (almost #2500 per
year at the current salary scales), then in 30 years' time he too would
accrue the same benefits.
As to Mr Stephen's reference to police pensioners taking up more
demanding jobs following retiral from the service, well really, who is
he kidding?
The police service is bound by the most rigid discipline code of any
non-military employment; its members are subject to the most stringent
controls over their private lives, they can be recalled to duty at any
time, be kept on duty for a multitude of reasons, are prevented from
taking part in many activities which are regarded by any other worker as
an inalienable right, have many of the same restrictions extended to
other members of their families and households, and, moreover, daily
face the risk of violence and/or injury. One in three Strathclyde
officers was assaulted last year, many seriously.
All this, and John R Stephen wants me to take up more demanding
employment in my middle age! Thanks, but no thanks.

I AM surprised to read the misinformation contained in Jim Thomson's
letter, Carbuncles and corn-plasters (July 1).
He writes that ''it is probably just as well that the Princess Royal
is due to open it (the new St Nicholas Garden) before its proposed
neighbouring carbuncle (to use an HRHism) is built''.
The incongruous design to which he refers wil never be built on the
adjacent site. The model, which is on display in the Glasgow 1999
Information Centre in Prince Square, clearly states that it illustrates
''an entry for a limited competition''.
This entry was not selected as the winner of that competition which
took place some 18 months ago -- and due to subsequent changes in policy
and priorities the project which was being considered is not now going
ahead.
It is unfortunate that Mr Thomson did not check his facts and has
raised concern over a building which was not being considered for that
site -- and a project which was removed from the agenda some 10 months
ago and is therefore not going to happen.

THE European Commissioner for the single market, Mario Monti, who
announced proposals yesterday under which European Union citizens and
legal EU residents would be able to travel freely throughout the Union
without showing passports from the end of 1996 is on a hiding to
nothing. The British Government will use its veto to stop any proposals
in their tracks. The changes require the unanimous consent of all EU
member states, and the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, and the last
Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, have repeatedly made clear that Britain
intends to keep its existing border checks regardless of the
requirements of the Schengen Agreement signed by seven of the EU states.
Schengen was designed to open frontiers, and the remaining EU countries
were expected to join the seven signatories, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany, and Spain, in due course.
The seven started operating the no-checks system in March, and all went
well until France reneged last week.
Britain has consistently argued we need passport checks and the rest
of the Customs and Excise paraphernalia for security reasons, to stop
illegal immigrants, and to prevent drug smuggling. Remote border
controls are said to be no substitute for checks at national frontiers
conducted by our own officials, and our national borders, being also our
external borders, not simply internal EU frontiers, require different
treatment. Are our objections well founded? Are we just being little
islanders? Certainly the free movement of citizens within the EU has
been one of the basic European goals, and the single market, which came
into force two years ago, was meant to operate without such barriers.
With them the single market will be less effective and the relaxation of
passport checks has been welcomed by those travelling between the seven,
whether on business or on holiday. The problem is, how do you ring fence
the European Union with its huge coastline frontiers? Some countries,
like Italy, not a Schengen signatory, are particularly vulnerable to
invasion by those who believe inside Europe lies the promised land. In
the nature of things it is hard to assess how serious our illegal
immigration problem is. We may catch so many people trying to enter
illegally, but are they the full extent of the problem or merely the
part of the illegal immigrant iceberg that is above water? It is
difficult to say, although assumptions can be made. What we do know is
that since 1988 the number of people seeking political asylum has risen
from 4000 to 32,000 last year, and that the situation in countries
around Europe, not just the former Yugoslavia, means there are many
refugees looking for a home.
Mr Monti believes change is necessary and that it is possible to put
in place the necessary checks against organised crime, illegal
immigration, and drug trafficking. Belgium and Luxembourg see no
problems to that. France, on the other hand, which does have a serious
illegal immigrant situation from its former territories in North Africa,
especially Algeria, has now restored its border controls and adopted a
similar attitude to Britain, insisting that the freedoms, while
desirable, are also ''too risky''. The issue of freedom of movement
seems to divide the political parties. Labour is certainly not standing
up for the principle. But the United States, which has massive problems
with illegal immigration and drug trafficking, seems able to cope
without internal passport checks at its state borders. Why cannot
Europe? Because to set up effective controls involves creating some kind
of common European force with agreed rules run centrally, yet more
erosion of power to Brussels. The aims of Schengen are, however, highly
desirable and everything should be done to achieve them. There are no
border checks between Scotland and England after all, and if border
checks are so necessary to keep out undesirables perhaps we should have
them there too. Forthwith.

DR David Butler's article on the Labour Party's landslide victory at
the 1945 General Election made most interesting reading (July 3).
However, the reference to President Roosevelt having attended the
Potsdam Conference that July must surely be incorrect since Roosevelt
had died suddenly the previous April and had been succeeded by Harry S
Truman.
American interests at Potsdam were being represented by the new
President Truman, as were those of Britain by the newly elected Premier,
Clement Attlee -- two unexpected political developments in that historic
year.

ARE honorary degrees a waste of time? Patently our universities do not
think so, since they are awarding a greater number to an increasingly
diverse group of people. It all started with Oxbridge. The universities
of Oxford and Cambridge gave honorary degrees to the great and the good
who could exercise political influence on their behalf, or who might
give something back by way of a bequest or some other contribution to
their gilded coffers. Of course they were also awarded in recognition of
achievement. In 1894 an ordnance was issued by the commissioners for the
Scottish universities authorising them to award honorary degrees. That
was more than 100 years ago, when we had four ancient universities. Now
we have 13, and for that reason alone honorary degree awards have grown.
Gone are the days when, in Scotland, they were largely the preserve of
academics who had laboured long and hard in an obscure field of
knowledge and whose names and achievements were known but to a few.
Honorary degree awards have been opened up. Superficially they are more
democratic, more classless, more meritocratic. Fundamentally, however,
there are grounds for concern about the criteria which seem increasingly
to apply for selecting those upon whom the award is to be conferred. Are
we seeing the emergence of what we might call cheque-book honorary
degreeism? Based on recent honorary degree conferments, it might seem
that more universities are offering them to the super-rich and
super-salaried in expectation that the recipients will return the
compliment with some financial support. Two years after receiving an
honorary degree from Aberdeen University the late Robert Maxwell donated
#300,000 to the institution. Last week the Sultan of Brunei received an
honorary degree from the university. Aberdeen has been at a loss
adequately to explain why the world's richest man should receive such an
award. That will not concern the university if it receives a fat cheque
from the Sultan for, say, a centre for research into non-renewable
energy resources. Times are tough and no doubt the university will put
any contribution to best use.
There are other examples of universities conferring honorary degrees
on a growing number of wealthy businessmen -- for they are invariably
men -- who might return a financial favour. The trend does the sector no
credit and it devalues honorary degrees. This is a pity, for they serve
a purpose. They recognise achievement. They are happy occasions which
serve a marketing purpose -- although who would want celebrity status as
a prime criterion? Ceremonies are at their best when the recipient is
the likes of Sister Helen Prejean, the American nun whose campaigning
against the death penalty was recognised at Glasgow University this
week. Her award also had an academic relevance, since the university's
law faculty has a death penalty project which involves students working
with American lawyers. And it attracted widespread publicity. Soon it
will be Dundee University's turn. It is guaranteed a slot on the front
pages with an honorary degree award to its rector, Stephen Fry, who will
come out of exile tomorrow after his local difficulty in London's
theatreland. There is nothing cynical or hard-headed in this. Fry has
been a conscientious campaigner against student poverty and has
performed benefit concerts to bolster student funds. He deserves the
spotlight, but he will not enjoy it.

AS a member of the Community Campaign to Save Rutherglen Maternity
Hospital, I refer to the letter from Margaret Hinds (July 6). She states
Rutherglen Maternity Hospital is to close.
Greater Glasgow Health Board took the decision to recommend the
closure of Rutherglen Maternity Hospital but the Secretary of State for
Scotland will make the final decision about its future.
Perhaps Mr Forsyth will take notice of 61,406 signatures opposing
closure of the hospital and supporting the continuing provision of local
maternity services, and the many concerns raised by the public during

RANGERS were given the dream draw they wanted in the European
Champions' Cup yesterday when they were paired with the unknown
Cypriots, Anorthosis of Famagusta, and given what appears to be a
walk-over which will give them a pay-off of close to #8m.
That would be the kind of money the Glasgow giants could expect to
pick up from playing in the European Champions' League. If they go
further -- they will do that even by finishing second in their group --
it would mean the quarter-finals, with the cash bonanza soaring towards
#10m.
The clash at Ibrox will be auctioned off to TV by UEFA after a deal
done yesterday in Geneva.
Rangers have apparently sold the television rights of the August 9
game -- which belonged to them -- back to UEFA who will now deal with
the companies who may want to show Paul Gascoigne's European debut for
the Ibrox club.
The mere fact that Rangers should be able to defeat a team without any
kind of European pedigree will give them even greater financial clout
than the other Scottish sides.
But, more important to the Ibrox side, their splashes in the transfer
market can now be wiped out by the money which will flow in from
European sponsors, from television fees, and from gate money.
Last night, manager Walter Smith was playing down his team's odds-on
chances as he surveyed the European scene.
''No game is easy,'' he warned. ''We can all remember a Richard Gough
goal for Scotland six minutes into injury time which snatched victory in
a World Cup game against Cyprus. And international team managers tell us
all that you cannot take any country for granted. That is the way we
will approach this one.''
Rangers already have an idea of what they must face. Last close
season, assistant manager Archie Knox saw Anorthosis play AEK Athens in
a tournament.
The Cypriots were two goals up at one stage, but then lost
4-2 to the Greeks, who went on to defeat Rangers in the preliminary
round of the Champions' Cup.
Rangers must be warned because the man who managed Levski Sofia, Jorge
Vasilev, is now with the Cypriot club, and has taken with him the
striker, Todorov, who scored the 40-yard stunner which sent Rangers
crashing out of this same tournament two years ago.
Motherwell and Raith Rovers were given ties which should push each of
them towards the glamour they both want in the first round proper of the
UEFA Cup.
Motherwell head for Finland to meet MyPA 47 and manager Alex McLeish
insisted: ''They are a team we will take a look at, but we would hope
that we could go on as we did last year into the main part of the
competition.''
At Kirkcaldy, it was the same story as Raith Rovers prepared for a
jaunt to the Faroes where they will take on Gotu Itrottarfelag, who were
their tiny country's champions.
Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl said: ''There can be problems out there
with the pitch, and we will be talking to Craig Brown about that. After
all, Scotland were there at the start of last month so we can get an
up-to-date report on what we will face.''
Celtic, who were seeded in the Cup-winners Cup, miss the preliminary
round, and go straight into the draw for the first round proper on
August 25.

* SEVE Ballesteros may be feeling below par with a recurrence of his
back problems, but yesterday he demonstrated (above) that he can still
coax a ball out of a seemingly impossible lie. At Carnoustie's fourth
hole, Ballesteros's ball struck the flag before spinning into a dry burn
bolstered by heavy sleepers, but he chipped out and sank the putt for
his par. The Spanish master must have thought things could only get
better as he climbed out of the burn (below), but it was not to be as
his round become peppered by bogeys and he finished with a nine-over-par
81.
IN four golf tournaments this season, Colin Montgomerie has been in a
position to win. On each occasion he has faltered, most recently last
Sunday in Ireland.
Yesterday, he put firmly behind him his latest disappointment to take
a two-stroke lead after the first round of the Scottish Open
Championship at Carnoustie.
Montgomerie came back off the ropes in a most resilient and emphatic
way when, in benign conditions which made the standard of scoring
resemble that more associated with some accommodating parkland course
than an exacting links, he had a 64, eight under par, and a stroke below
the accepted record set in the 1975 Open Championship by Jack Newton.
The closest pursuit was offered by Ian Woosnam, twice winner of the
title, Antipodean Michael Campbell, and Wayne Riley, more consistent
than the streaky player he once was. A stroke behind them was a
cosmopolitan group comprising Craig Parry of Australia, Marc Farry of
France, Domingo Hospital of Spain and Vijay Singh of Fiji.
All these players, and indeed the great majority of the field, had
finished their rounds before a sea haar suddenly enveloped the course.
Play was not suspended, however, and those still out continued to inch
their way round in the expectation that the long northern twilight would
allow play to be completed.
But Carnoustie's uncompromising defences still meted out harsh
punishment. Severiano Ballesteros finished 17 strokes adrift of
Montgomerie with his 81, the Masters champion Ben Crenshaw took 77,
Sandy Lyle dropped four strokes in the last four holes for 74, and the
Amateur Champion Gordon Sherry hooked his last drive exhaustedly out of
bounds for a double bogey.
It was at its imperial best, but not imperius, for although first
under grey skies and then warm sunshine, with latterly the lightest of
north-east breezes, birdies were as easy to shoot as fish in a barrel.
Yet nothing could be taken for granted from the 7187-yard course --
Montgomerie had halves of 33, 31, having eight single putts using the
club he introduced only last week.
A 10-yard chip holed at the seventh stimulated the cause and since
Montgomerie has always coveted this title most after the majors, his
positive reaction was understandable. ''It's very satisfying at this
stage to hold the record on an Open Championship course, especially
after throwing away another chance at Mount Juliet,'' he said. ''I was
very low on Sunday evening.''
''This was a nice way to start eight very important rounds in Scotland
this week and next.''
Montgomerie's coach Bill Ferguson advised that his right hand had
moved too far under the grip, apparently a recurring fault.
By coincidence, Ferguson also has recently taken to doctoring
Woosnam's swing.
Woosnam's faith in Ferguson's suggestions made on a two-day visit to
his home in Jersey proved justified. By a few minutes, he beat
Montgomerie's inward half, playing the last six holes in five-under-par.
Campbell, like Montgomerie, was in the hunt in Ireland but also
stumbled over the last three holes. ''I was too impatient and tried too
hard, '' the New Zealander explained. His game plan changed in the
unfamiliar conditions, but did not include the rousing start of a 15ft
chip holed for the first of eight birdies.
Ballesteros lost what little confidence he brought to the championship
when he lost a ball and double-bogeyed the long sixth. He made 8 at the
long fourteenth after having hooked his tee-shot out of bounds, and 7 at
the next, having taken two in a greenside bunker. Asked if he would now
practise, Ballesteros shrugged: ''I hit enough shots today.''
Crenshaw failed to make a birdie and was in five bunkers, mainly the
result of wrong clubbing. But he admitted: ''After three days of
practising in a wind, my judgment and execution were poor and I had no
feel for the course.'' The same explanations might apply to Lyle,
although he at least reached two under par before the rot set in.
Having bunkered his drive to drop a stroke at the fifteenth, Lyle's
hook returned to haunt him. He was 30 yards wide of the sixteenth green,
through which he then hit his pitch to take 5 and, like many before him,
failing to appreciate how close the fence is to the eighteenth green, he
hooked a No.3-iron out of bounds.
By contrast Nick Faldo stepped back from the abyss opened by a double
bogey 6 at the tenth where he hit his second into the burn. He played
the last five holes in four under par, hitting a No.2-iron to 12ft for
one of only two birdies there all day and a No.1-iron to 18ft for an
eagle 3 at the last.
Sherry, having played 10 rounds in six days in Belgium helping
Scotland win the European Amateur Team Championship, and a practise
round on Tuesday almost scratched because of fatigue and his final slip
was only human.

MELANIE Neef, who defends her AAA of England 400 metres title this
weekend in Birmingham, tops the latest Scottish women's rankings at
three distances -- 100 and 200m, as well as one lap, writes Doug Gillon.
Neef, Europa Cup 400m champion, is also UK fastest at the distance, as
well as second over 200m. ''I would like to have tackled the 200 this
weekend, but want to confirm my World Championship place without any
messing around,'' said Neef.
The KP-backed Birmingham event is Britain's world trial, and
individual winners are guaranteed automatic selection when the team is
announced on Monday, provided they have attained the qualifying
standard.
Neef is one of only three Scots to have posted the required mark
(Yvonne Murray and Liz McColgan are the others) -- no Scottish men have
done so this year -- and Neef is now only 0.19 outside the 15-year-old
Scottish best set by Lindsey Macdonald when she won Olympic selection in
1980.
Murray has yet to race 10,000m on the track this year, and will not do
so until the world event in Gothenburg next month. Murray's performance,
in winning the Commonwealth title in Victoria last year, is within the
qualifying period. Her only track races this year, at 1500 and 5000m,
placed her at the top of the national lists.
The only other women with any remote chance of selection are Aileen
McGillivary, Karen Hargrave, and Emma Lindsay. Sprinter McGillivary has
been hampered by early season injury and illness, and has a lot to do
this weekend even to secure a relay berth. The former European Cup
under-23 champion plans to race both the 100 and 200m.
The France-based Fifer, Hargrave, fourth in the 1990 Commonwealth
Games at 3000m could make it at 5000m, which replaces the 3k this year
in international competition.
Commonwealth finallist Lindsay has an outside prospect in the
heptathlon. Scottish women's rankings (qualifying standard for world

'Where was the Big Bertha,
the coiled swing, the
Palmer-like lunge and the ping
of a glorious belter down
the middle?'
IAN PAUL with early squirms trying to catch birdies
DOWN at the harbour, the squealing seagulls were well into the fifth
movement of their dawn cacophony, but on the Carnoustie course as 7am
approached, there was a strange, almost eerie, peace, maybe a reverence
for the re-awakening of a great course.
The honour of striking the first shots in serious professional anger
for two decades fell to three men who could not fully appreciate its
significance. This was the story of a Swede, a Spaniard and an
Englishman, none of whom was playing the game at this level when
Carnoustie was last the setting for big-time action.
The man who hit the first blow, Fredrik Lindgren, was a 10-year-old
growing up in Malmo at the time Tom Watson won the last Open
Championship on this course; Iain Pyman was a sprightly two-year-old in
Whitby; and Juan Quiros was an ambitious 21-year-old who had just turned
pro.
Maybe it was no surprise, then, that Lindgren hit the first shot of
the Scottish Open championship with a No.2-iron. There we were, about 40
of us, wondering if the larks were having a lie-in, eagerly awaiting the
opening salvos on this monstrous golf course, a true test of strength,
stamina and wit, and the man hits a No.2-iron!
Is there no sense of history left? Where was the Big Bertha, the
coiled swing, the Palmer-like lunge and the ping of a glorious belter
down the middle?
We had got out of bed at an ungodly hour for this, we had looked out
at the haar, cursed the seagulls, startled the security man at the media
centre. All for a No.2-iron.
The Angus God sorted the man out, of course. Lindgren was short with
his second, took three putts and finished up with a bogey 5. Don't
2-iron about with our heritage, Fred.
Old God Angus was equally willing to hand out the prizes for good
behaviour, as befits a benevolent north-easterly. Pyman, the former
Amateur champion, was the only one of the three to use a wood off the
tee and, after a fine No.9-iron approach, was rewarded with a birdie 3.
By now the skies were a little less leaden, the weather was benign,
and the world seemed not too bad a place for pioneers like ourselves,
ploughing the first paths for the new generation of galleries.
My challenger for the lead was a man from Edinburgh, Ian McCallister,
who won a ticket for the tournament by shooting a 73 on his home
Portobello course. He is spending the week here, much of it in the in
the car park, where he is sleeping in his Honda Civic. If I needed
therapy for wandering about a field at this time in the morning, Mr
McAllister may be beyond repair.
On the other side of the ropes, the three early birds were doing their
best to entertain. Pyman, who seems a natural for the Hearts chairman to
sponsor, not only birdied the first, but also the second and gave us a
wee hope that we might even be tagging along with the leader. The wheels
came off a little in due course, but the young man who now lives in
Leeds kept his form going well enough to finish with a respectable 72.
He is the golfer who last year holed in one at the last in the
Murphy's English Open and won 13,750 pints of the sponsors' brew. He
opted for the cash equivalent. Barnsey of old would have done the right
thing and taken the beer, and made it last a couple of weeks, too.
Pyman, incidentally, rather appropriately, is sponsored by Thirsty
Camel which, apparently, is a sparkling water drink bottled in
Yorkshire. There was not much sparkling being done by our greying friend
from Spain.
He missed an easy putt for a birdie at the first and from then on, the
going got tough. He had bogey 5s at the third, fourth and fifth holes,
followed by a 6 at the sixth, by which time the Hispanic temperament was
beginning to crack.
Appeals to his God, with eyes uplifted and a stream of Spanish
invective which might not have pleased the deity, failed to ease the
pain as he went to the turn in 40. By then, he had hauled out the fags,
occasionally thundered a club into the ground, and generally gave the
impression that Carnoustie in July was not his kind of town.
He had another three bogeys on the way in to end up with a 79 and
looks very much as if he will be able to get in some much needed Open
Championship qualifying practice after he misses the cut today.
The other two have chances of staying the week -- Pyman's par 72 and
Lindgren on 73.
The Swede acknowledged that Carnoustie is a difficult course, but had
no objection to being out first. ''In fact, I was aware that I was the
first man since the Open in 1975 to play here in a major competition.
That was nice.
''There are advantages in going out early. You often get the best of
the weather, but it is also sometimes hard to stay awake.'' I know what
the man meant.

WHILE our Monty was leading the home gang in magnificent style, Sam
Torrance and others were doing their bit to keep the Tartan troops, who
were enjoying a glorious sunny afternoon, in good humour.
Torrance, in days gone by, would have been tempted to have a
whing-ding of a party after having won a tournament like the Murphy's
Irish Open, but he is a much more mature chap these days, putting up a
69 two days after his celebrations began.
It is the kind of follow-up round that has not been the norm for the
Largs man, who now lives at Wentworth, by his own admission.
''This time it is different. It is too important. I had a quiet couple
of days with the family, although I do admit I am not sure where my head
is at the moment.''
Torrance was pleased with his score -- ''a 69 round here is good at
any time'' -- but still went straight to the practice ground to work on
his game. ''I was not hitting the ball quite as well as last week, but
it was not far away.'' He had an almost flawless round with only one
bogey, a 5 at the ninth. But he also had four birdies. ''The course was
very benign. It was a day for scoring well.''
The last time he played here was in 1975, when he finished nineteenth
in the Open Championship. Before that he can remember finishing second
to David Chillas in the British Boys' Strokeplay championship.
Paul Lawrie was a shot behind Torrance, but for him that was perhaps
more satisfying. The 26-year-old from Aberdeen has been having a hard
time recently and needed a morale boost to get himself on the money
trail again.
''I have only won about #18,000 this year and this could be a big week
for me,'' he said. ''I went to see David Whelan, David Leadbetter's
assistant, and he told me to try one or two things. This is the
result.''
On the same mark was a far more seasoned pro, Brian Marchbank, who has
been 16 years on the Tour, but who lost his card last season. His round
represented a big improvement on recent form, during which he has not
won any money in the last five tournaments.
Cawder assistant Alan Tait, who last year shot a 64 at this course
which appeared to be a record until Montogomerie's identical total
yesterday, was not suprised to learn that Monty's is the official record
over what is a revamped layout, albeit marginally, with two holes
slightly different.
''Monty's score is tremendous,'' said Tait, who shot a 75 yesterday,
''and I knew they would want that as the record. In October when I shot
it, they took it badly. They wouldn't take it any better now.''
Big names make better reading for the courses wishing to illustrate
their status, but it would be nice if Tait shot a 63 today.
Gordon Brand Jr had a 70, but it could have been a great deal better.
He was four under with four to go, but had a double-bogey 6 the
fifteenth.
The unluckiest man of the day, however, might well have been Colin
Gillies, the Scottish champion, who was four under par at the turn and
still three under with three to go. Then he had a triple-bogey 6 at the
sixteenth, and a bogey 5 at the seventeenth to finish level par.

SCOTLAND excelled themselves over the demanding Woodhall Spa course in
Lincolnshire yesterday to finish at the top of the leaderboard after the
first qualifying round of the European Boys team championship.
A five-player aggregate of 378 means that Scotland have a four-stroke
advantage over Sweden going into today's second and final qualifying
round.
Defending champions England are a further shot back in third place.
Scottish boys' matchplay champion Steven Young maintained the superb
form he has shown all season with a one-under-par round of 72 to give
the Scots the perfect start.
Young was one of only three players from the 18 competing nations who
managed to break par.
Graham Fox was also in excellent form with a level-par 73 at the
bottom of the order and things worked out exactly as captain Scott
McDonald had hoped.
''I was looking for a good start and a strong finish and was confident
that Steven and Graham could provide just that,'' he said.
Grant Campbell shot a 75, Chris Kelly a 77, while Paul Cunningham and
Oliver Lindsay both returned 81, with Lindsay's effort being discarded.
First-round qualifying scores:
378 -- Scotland (S Young, 72; G Fox, 73; G Campbell, 75; C Kelly, 77;
P Cunningham, 81; O Lindsay, 81).
382 -- Sweden. 383 -- England 386 -- France. 389 -- Italy. 391 --
Spain, Denmark. 392 -- Germany. 395 -- Wales. 397 -- Austria. 398 --
Norway, Ireland. 399 -- Netherlands. 402 -- Finland. 406 -- Belgium. 411
-- Portugal, Iceland. 415 -- Switzerland.
Scotland
well adrift
TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
SCOTLAND are in a precarious position going into the second and final
strokeplay qualifying round of the European Women's Team championship in
Milan this morning.
The Scots finished the first day with a five-card aggregate of 386 to
lie in joint eighth place with Ireland, some 20 strokes adrift of
leaders Spain and six behind England.
Only Mhairi McKay really shone among the Scots. The Curtis Cup player,
who is now at Stamford University in America, reached the turn in 38 and
came home in 35, one under par.
Janice Moodie was round in 75, but the rest of the Scots struggled,
Alison Rose finishing on 78 and Sharon McMaster and Hilary Monaghan both
on 80, with Lesley Nicholson's 82 being discounted.
Scotland cannot afford any mistakes today if they are to keep alive
their championship dream. Leading first-round aggregates:
366 -- Spain. 367 -- France. 369 -- Sweden. 370 -- Italy. 372 --
Denmark. 380 -- England. 381 -- Germany. 386 -- Scotland, Ireland. 387
-- Wales. 389 -- Norway. 390 -- Switzerland. 394 -- Holland. 399 --
Austria, Belgium. 401 -- Finland. 410 -- Czech Republic. 411 -- Iceland.
426 -- Portugal.

ALGERIA'S Noureddine Morceli shattered his own world 1500 metres
record by more than a second in Nice last night -- then said he could
have taken another second off.
He clocked 3min 27.37sec at the Nikaia grand prix meeting, beating the
mark of 3-28.86 which he set in Rieti, Italy, on September 6, 1992.
''I'm really happy with this time but the even greater motivation for
me is to reach 3-26,'' said Morceli. ''I think I could have achieved
that if I had had someone running with me in the last lap.''
It was the second world mark the Algerian had set in 10 days following
his 2000m record in Paris on July 3.
The early pace was set by Morceli's younger brother Ali, who led the
field for the first 600m before dropping out.
Noureddine hit the front himself one-and-a-half laps from home, went
through the bell at 2-33 and seemed to finish with something to spare as
he crossed the line after his blistering 54sec final lap.
William Kemei, of Kenya, finished a distant second in 3-31.40, with
Eric Dubus of France third in 3-32.37.
Ten years ago in Nice, Britain's Steve Cram and Morocco's Said Aouita
hooked up in a classic metric mile duel where both went under the old
world record, with Cram winning in 3-29.67.
Morceli's record run made up for the disappointment shared by the
near-capacity crowd when Venuste Niyongabo, of Burundi, failed by less
than a second to break Morceli's 10-day-old world 2000m record an hour
earlier.
Niyongabo's run was still the second-fastest time over the rarely
raced non-Olympic distance and was only 0.81 outside the 4-47.88
established by Morceli last week.
There was also disappointment for Britain's 110m hurdles world
champion and world record-holder Colin Jackson.
The effects of missed training due to a throat infection and
tonsillitis showed as he was beaten by German Florian Schwarthoff, who
clocked a relatively mediocre 13.29.
Jackson, who ran 11 races under 13.20 last year, winning all 18 finals
he raced, led over the first seven hurdles before fading in the last 30m
and finishing second in 13.35. The same time was given to third-placed
American Courtney Hawkins.
John Regis scored a psychologically important win over Namibian world
champion Frankie Fredericks in the 200m. Regis made a powerful start and
was never headed, clocking 20.26 to Fredericks's 20.30.
And Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan won the women's mile in 4-23.61, more
than half a second ahead of American Regina Jacobs.

<HEADLINE>Focus on the home challenge at Silverstone. Irvine begins to make news for right reasons</HEADLINE>

My opinion is that Berger and Alesi will still be at Ferrari next
year, probably for less money. As for Schumacher, well, any team would
welcome a world champion but at $20m I don't think so.
OF THE handful of British drivers in Sunday's British Grand Prix at
Silverstone, Eddie Irvine is probably the most misunderstood. Since his
explosive debut at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka in 1993 the
headlines have tended to label him ''The Wild Man'' of Formula One.
At Suzuka the late, great Ayrton Senna threw a punch at Irvine after a
disagreement over his race tactics.
In 1994 there followed a series of incidents which appeared to
rubber-stamp Irvine's reputation for attracting controversy. He was
banned by the FIA for three races after a spectacular shunt in the
Brazilian Grand Priz. Lotus chief Peter Collins questioned his right to
be in Formula One after he put Johnny Herbert out of contention at
Monza.
However, Irvine reckons it's well past the time to talk about
something else: ''I just want to yawn when the 'incidents' are
mentioned,'' he says. ''It's all so long ago now.'' But he does admit to
being at fault for one of the incidents.
''I'll put my hand up to one -- just one -- and that was at Monza. But
that was a racing accident pure and simple, and who hasn't had one of
those?'' he asked.
''It's all so much water under the bridge. I just get on with the job
and hope to get results.''
He has certainly been doing that with Jordan in 1995 and has so far
overshadowed his more illustrious team-mate, Rubens Barrichello, by
making headlines because of his talent. So much so that there are
rumours he could be on the move to a big team in 1996.
He said: ''I haven't been talking to anybody, but for me to move
anywhere would prove expensive, because there's a heavy buy-out clause
in my contract. So I can't see anything beyond my staying at Jordan for
the moment.''
Money is what makes the Formula One world go round and world champion
Michael Schumacher is said to be asking $20m for his services in 1996,
yet Ferrari, with the help of their sponsor, Marlboro, are hot
favourites to capture the German. Irvine, though, is sceptical. ''In my
view he won't be going to Ferrari, because the drivers' paymasters at
Ferrari are Marlboro, and there's no way they'll pay $20m for him.
''If he can get that kind of money, good luck to him because he's the
world champion, but if Marlboro are paying, I can't see the deal coming
off.
''I speak as a Marlboro driver myself, and if anything the money will
be less next year. I presume that Schumacher's demand for $20m is based
on Gerhard Berger getting $13m at Ferrari and from that perspective he
would be justified in his asking price, but there's no way Berger is a
$13m driver. I'm sure anyone who seriously analysed the drivers'
relative performances would agree.
''There's a lot of talk about where Berger, Alesi, and Schumacher will
be next year. My opinion is that Berger and Alesi will still be at
Ferrari, probably for less money. As for Schumacher, well, any team
would welcome a world champion but at $20m I don't think so.''
With Silverstone only days away, most British drivers are getting
pumped up for a good show in front of the home crowd, but not Irvine.
''For me it's not so important,'' he said. ''I don't like Silverstone
that much. There's been a lot of praise for the changes at the circuit,
but I just can't say that I'm a fan.
''Jordan test here a lot, so I know it well enough, but it's really
just another grand prix on the calendar for me and another opportunity
for points. My favourite track is Suzuka, because I simply enjoy racing
there.''
The Northern Ireland-born but Republic-based Jordan driver is already
a well-known figure around the streets of Dublin, more so after
celebrating the first podium finish of his career with third place in
Canada last month.
Irvine does enjoy one of the other rewards with ownership of a Ferrari
and it is possible that he could soon be sliding into the seat of the
Formula One version.
''Obviously, every driver wants to drive for Ferrari,'' said Irvine of
the famous marque, enjoying a renaissance in their fortunes this season.
''They are not 100% competitive yet, but they are getting there.''
What about Williams then? He observed: ''I would like to be in the
position of, say Damon Hill and David Coulthard at Williams. I'm not
saying I'll end up with Williams, but if I keep doing my job, it will be
with one of the top teams.''
Meanwhile, Germany's ''dream pairing'' of Mercedes and Schumacher is
unlikely to become reality in the near future, the world champion said
yesterday.
Schumacher has often said in the past that he would love to drive for
the German car company who helped launch his motor-racing career -- they
signed him as a junior in 1989 -- and are now in partnership with the
McLaren team. But he said the new McLaren-Mercedes car was not fast
enough and hinted he was unlikely to leave the Benetton team when his
contract runs out at the end of this season.
''I want a competitive car and that is not the case there at the
moment,'' Schumacher said in an interview with the German news agency
SID.
He added that he was unlikely to make a final decision about next
season before September.

GALA are trying to bring two New Zealand players to Scotland in time
for the start of the new premier league on September 2. The players have
been recommended by Rob Hogg, the Gala lock forward who is currently
playing a season of New Zealand rugby.
Jim Gilchrist, Gala's new president, confirmed that the club had
approached the two Kiwis, a lock forward and a utility back. ''But, as
far as the names are concerned, I couldn't tell you them at present,''
the president added.
If the two were to join Gala, it would be a further boost after last
week's news that Scotland A wing Mark Moncrieff and South flanker John
Amos would not, after all, be defecting to neighbouring Melrose.
Gilchrist also confirmed that Gala were close to signing a new
sponsorship agreement, but denied reports that the club had arranged a
job that would allow Gregor Townsend, their international midfield back,
to remain in Scotland instead of joining Northampton. The president
admitted, however, that ''feelers'' had been put out.
Townsend, who has recovered from the knee injury that kept him out of
the World Cup, will fly out to Australia next week for a playing visit.
Meanwhile Melrose have arranged a lucrative fixture to start their
programme of home matches next month. London Scottish are to play them
at the Greenyards on Sunday, August 27, the day after the two clubs have
contested the Selkirk sevens at Philiphaugh.
* SOUTH Africa's pay television company M-Net says it has taken legal
action over media magnate Rupert Murdoch's #330m 10-year TV deal.
M-Net claims the deal is based on restrictive business practices, as
no South African broadcaster was given the chance to bid for the
television rights.

FIXTURE congestion seems inevitable during the new season, which
starts in just over five weeks.
The fixture list, released yesterday by the Scottish Rugby Union,
shows that five Saturdays and one Wednesday in September have been
allocated to premier-league fixtures. Sunday matches will be a feature
later in the season.
The real headaches for club coaches will be in November, when league
games and tour matches clash. Western Samoa, who tour Scotland in the
autumn, are scheduled to play Scotland A at Mansfield Park on Sunday,
November 12, one day after a full league programme. A week later,
Scotland play Western Samoa at Murrayfield on Saturday, November 18, and
on the following day there is a full league programme.
Hitherto, arrangements were that clubs were never disadvantaged in
league matches by having to release players for representative duty. Now
it seems it is the clubs who will have to make the accommodation.
The traffic jam in November will be compounded by the arrival of
Western Province. The South Africans play Glasgow and then the South,
while the touring Samoans will meet North and Midlands at McDiarmid Park
in Perth on Tuesday, November 14.
The District championship in December will be played mainly on
Sundays. Tennents Premier League fixtures for September:
Div 1: Sat, Sept 2 -- Heriot's v Melrose; Stirling County v Hawick;
Gala v Watsonians; Boroughmuir v Edinburgh Acads. Sat, Sept 9 -- Hawick
v Heriot's; Edinburgh Acads v Gala; Watsonians v Stirling County;

ITALIAN climber Marco Pantani won the toughest mountain stage of the
Tour de France yesterday. But race leader Miguel Indurain, from Spain,
underlined his mastery of the race with another flawless display.
Pantani, who finished second in the Giro d'Italia last season and
third in the Tour de France, surged up the final 6.1-mile climb to
l'Alpe d'Huez to win the tenth and most punishing stage of the race.
Indurain, who looks ever more certain to create a record by winning
his fifth consecutive Tour, showed a clean pair of wheels once more to
the most of the field's mountain specialists.
He came in second, 1min 24sec behind Pantani, as he finished in the
top two for the fourth successive stage.
Indurain's last remaining rival, Switzerland's Alex Zuelle, was one of
only two riders able to stay with him behind Pantani in the 101-mile
stage from Aime-La Plagne.
Zuelle remained 2-27 behind, with all the rest at least six minutes
down and out of contention.
Pantani showed great style as he gave Italy their fourth win in the
past five Tour finishes up the 22-hairpin climb to l'Alpe d'Huez.
He made a solo attack from the bottom of the hill, chased down a group
of riders who had broken away on the Col de la Croix de Fer, then rode
on his own for the last 6[1/4] miles to win in 5hr 13min 14sec.
''I wasn't thinking of attacking when I reached the bottom of the
climb,'' he said. ''Part of me was telling me to wait but another part
told me I could win, so I went. It was more panache than my legs which
did it for me.''
Pantani climbed to seventh in the overall standings but is more than
12 minutes behind Indurain.
Indurain showed no trace of tiredness as he hauled in all the climbers
from the earlier break with a sustained show of sheer power and then
left them trailing in his wake.
Only Zuelle and Denmark's Bjarne Riis, third overall, were able to
stay with him to the end.
Today's eleventh stage takes the race out of the Alps and towards the
Pyrenees, covering 124.3 miles from Bourg d'Oisans to St Etienne.

STRANGE things happened in the sea mist which afflicted the 35-mile
coastal race for up to two hours yesterday, as the Big Boat Channel
Handicap classes and the Sigma 33s at Bangor Week ventured out of
Belfast Lough south along the coast to round Skulmartin Rock buoy.
With up to three knots of northwards-flowing tide offshore, that was
the graveyard for many early hopes, and it was the brave who benefited
by staying inshore out of the current and, ironically in the sunshine,
who continually reaped a dividend.
Caution was required in the shallow waters, as demonstrated by the two
boats who struck rock off Donaghadee, both sustaining enough damage to
prevent further racing this week.
Opening in a light southerly breeze, a short windward leg soon proved
any big early gains were quickly negated when the full effect of the
tide compressed the fleets as they turned south.
Fortunes yesterday proved mixed for the Clyde boats. Local one-tonners
Sidewinder (David Best) and Brava (Thallon and Blair) were well ahead of
the similarly-rated best Scottish boat Bateleur, Chris Bonar's Tripp
402, which took fourth.
In Class 1, fourth also was the best placing for a Scottish boat --
John Corson's J35 Salamander.
Best result of the day for the Clyde fleet was John Kelly's Contessa
33, Naiad III, which worked a steady recovery from a dreadful first
beat, pulling themselves steadily up to second place in Class 2, the
113-boat regatta's biggest division, 23 boats strong. Results:
Race 4 (all Scottish unless stated): Class 0 -- 1, Megalopolis (U
Taylor, Pwlheli) 6hr 01min 06sec; 2, Sidewinder (D Best) (Ulster)
6-02-26; 3, Brava (Thallon, Blair and Matthew) 6-06-33; 4, Bateleur (C
Bonar) 6-13-42; 5, Eclipse V (A Duffus) 6-16-41; 6, Duckwall Pooley (J
Anderson) 6-21-14.
Class 1 -- 1, Jumpin' Jack Flash (S Moorhouse, Isle of Man) 6-10-19;
4, Salamander X11 (J Corson) 6-19-46.
Class 2 -- 1, Material Gain (T Halliwell, Howth) 5-56-45; 2, Naiad III

TOP seed Jeremy Bates cruised into the second round of the Mercury
Communications Challenge at Bristol with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over fellow
Briton Barry Cowan.
But Bates said later: ''I was very nervous at the start. I always feel
mentally shattered after Wimbledon, no matter what round I reach. There
is always a problem coming down after the high of the fortnight there.''
Bates, 33, added that he was looking ahead no further than Christmas.
''I won't carry on if my ranking starts to fall away,'' he said.
Three other Britons -- Danny Sapsford, Andrew Foster, and Colin
Beecher -- enjoyed first-round victories.
But giant Belgian Dick Norman, seeded five, crashed out along with
second seed Arne Thoms, of Germany.

LANCASHIRE'S hopes of stocking up the trophy cabinet this season
remain alive after they defeated holders Worcestershire, with just an
over to spare, to reach the quarter-finals of the NatWest Trophy.
The Red Rose county play Kent in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup final on
Saturday and hope to match their 1990 double.
Worcestershire set 272, with Graeme Hick hitting a brilliant 87 in 78
balls and opener Tim Curtis unbeaten on 106. Steve Titchard and Mike
Atherton replied with 167 in the first 40 overs and Lancashire survived
some late hiccups.
Chasing Warwickshire's 262-7, Kent needed 14 runs off the final over
when Dermot Reeve ripped out rival captain Steve Marsh's middle stump
and the visitors came up 10 runs short.
Alan Fordham equalled his highest 60-over score, 132, and fellow
opener Richard Montgomerie scored 109 en route to two Northants records
-- a stand of 232 and an innings of 352-8.

those born in England.
The magazine's editor has already offered ''unreserved apologies . . .
to all those whose sensibilities have been offended by the article.''

PAT Eddery endured one of the most miserable days of his career
yesterday when he was hit with a 19-day riding ban, found guilty of
irresponsible riding and frustratingly missed out on two winners.
Just hours after the Jockey Club's disciplinary committee found him
guilty of two offences of careless riding, he earned a trip back to
Portman Square for committing his fifth offence of the season.
A further ban is likely after the stewards found he had caused
interference shortly after the start of the Duke of Cambridge Handicap
on Inquisitor at Newmarket.
Eddery already misses some of the most lucrative prizes of the summer,
including the King George meeting at Ascot and the whole of Glorious
Goodwood, after his riding at Windsor and Epsom earned him bans of 12
and seven days.
His efforts to put the suspensions behind him failed dismally as he
suffered a series of misfortunes.
A last-race victory on favourite New Reputation in the Reg Day
Memorial Handicap was scant consolation for a day Eddery will wish to
forget.
He was beaten a short head on Gay Gallanta in the Falmouth Stakes by
Caramba, the filly from which he was ''jocked off'' for poor riding in
the Prix de Diane.
He was shaded again by Royal Circle when second on Bequeath in the
More O'Ferrall Stakes, the disappointment compounded when it emerged
that he would have ridden Royal Circle if she had taken up an
alternative engagement at Kempton.
More bad luck followed when the unraced Trafalgar Lady proved
reluctant to go to the start of the Princess Maiden Fillies Stakes,
threw him off when she got there and then refused to enter the stalls.
The first ban runs from July 15 to 27 and the second from July 28 to
August 3.

AN increase of almost 15% in Scotland's barley acreage shows a
restored confidence in the malting market, according to United
Distillers.
The rise in the spring barley acreage is largely at the expense of
spring oilseed rape and oats - ''a very welcome reversal of a 10-year
trend'' -- and will boost availability by about 150,000 tonnes.
The proportion of malting barley varieties sown in Scotland increased
5% with Chariot, Derkado and Prisma the three most popular varieties.

INCHYRA Grange Hotel at Polmont, Falkirk, has just completed a major
extension programme which has added 30 bedrooms -- they bring the total
to 73, with a new conference suite, and six syndicate rooms of various
sizes.
Part of the Macdonald Hotels group, Inchyra Grange epitomises the
individual character, high standards, and close attention to guests
which is synonymous with this Scottish group which also owns hotels
south of the Border in addition to holding a number of management
contracts. The general manager of the hotel is Andy Burgess.
The new wing combines the latest conference room, the Kinneil Suite,
which can accommodate around 60 people theatre-style or some 30
boardroom style, within the new bedroom area. The six syndicate rooms
are located here too, converting from extra large bedrooms into meeting
rooms for up to 10 people.
The Kinneil Suite is a sympathetic addition -- as is the entire
extension -- to the fine original building which was once a private
house, and stands in 44 acres.
Deputy general manager Ann Yuille says: ''Our largest facility, the
air-conditioned Menteith Suite, can accommodate up to 220 and has an
audio system, while the patio lounge opens on to the Menteith Suite by
way of a moveable soundproof partition. Used in conjunction with it, for
receptions, lunches or whatever, it is ideal as a training room or for a
private lunch or dinner.''
She adds that the first floor, Grange Room: ''Is accessed via a
private reception and bar area and is perfectly suited to the smaller
conference with elegant decor, natural light and air conditioning. It's
also popular for small dinner dances and luncheons.''
Close by, the Kerse Room provides an intimate ambience for private
dinners, boardroom meetings or small training groups.
The new bedrooms are well proportioned, luxurious and, like the rest
of the hotel, furnished and decorated tastefully, while the ensuite
bathrooms are spacious and of high quality.
The bedrooms have satellite television, trouser press, mini bar, iron
and ironing board, tea and coffee and complimentary fruit.
The main areas of the hotel, accessed from the spacious, airy, and
elegant foyer include the hotel's restaurant with full a la carte and
table d'hote of imaginative cuisine.
In the Pelican Leisure Club, residents will find a swimming pool,
state-of-the-art gym, sunbeds, snooker room, Jacuzzi, steamroom and
saunas in both changing rooms. There is also a small children's
playroom, a beautician and an aromatherapist.
In the Earl Lounge, bar meals are served at lunchtime and in the
evening. The emphasis here tends towards more traditional food.
The hotel's location ensures that it also attracts tourist business.
''It's amazing how many tourists come here to visit Edinburgh perhaps,
or the Trossachs,'' comments Ann Yuille. ''In the business market, there
are a lot of companies which cover all of Scotland and want a central
point where people can converge easily with plenty of parking and good
facilities.
''Our location is undoubtedly a great strength.''
Weddings are another special function at which Inchyra Grange feels it
has much to offer.
''A lot of our heads of department have worked at Inchyra Grange for
25 years. They are proficient at organising weddings, private functions,
conferences -- they know what they are doing and this gives confidence
to the customers,'' says Ms Yuille.
Already, the festive entertainment programme and menus have been drawn
up at Inchyra Grange. Party lunches and nights, Christmas Day, Hogmanay
and New Year's Day promise fun, good food and a memorable visit.

THE series of meetings at which shareholders in Scottish Pride can
express their grievances prior the the company's AGM on July 29, began
earlier this week with the media excluded. However, it is already clear
from ''leaks'' that there is a huge degree of confusion among farmer
shareholders with hard facts, allegations, and simple misconceptions all
thoroughly mixed up.
Last week the chief executive of Scottish Pride, Jim Hosea, responded
to the allegations of irregular share dealings and suggested some
creameries would close. He said: ''There has been significant commercial
damage and I do believe that we have lost business.''
That can be taken as fact as can the figures in the annual report
which show that Scottish Pride made a profit of #730,000 compared to a
loss of #2.79m in the previous year when the company was part of the
former Scottish Milk Marketing Board.
It is also clear that trading conditions in the dairy sector are
difficult, and by general consent much more so than 12 months ago when
the board was still in existence.
The question some shareholders are asking is -- how did Scottish Pride
get itself in such a mess over a period of years? Former managers must
inevitably in the eyes of many take a share of the blame, they in turn
were answerable to the board of the SMMB which was elected by producers.
The troubles of Scottish Pride go back a long way, but it was only
last July when they fully surfaced. Speaking at the AGM of the SMMB on
July 20, 1994, the chairman, Andrew Howie said: ''We have stripped #7m
of goodwill out of the balance sheet.
''We have written off over #1m from cheese stocks. We have made a
provision of #3.5m for restructuring. All of which has had the effect of
reducing a profit of over #4m down to a loss of almost #2m.''
In other words, the accounting policy followed in previous years was
thoroughly discredited at a stroke. Scottish Pride, in which all
producers were given a stake on vesting day, was largely financed by
capital contributions from producers of more #23m stretching back to
1968.
This proved to be highly successful in maintaining for SMMB producers
the highest pool price in the UK. The difference now, and one that Mr
Hosea and his fellow directors are attempting to get over, is that
Scottish Pride is a plc which places the board under the obligations of
company law with the directors obliged to ''make judgments and estimates
which are reasonable and prudent.'' In effect, to buy and sell milk and
a range of dairy products as efficiently as possible.
There has been confusion over the trading in the company's shares and
who is entitled to buy them. This, said Mr Hosea, after the first of the
meetings at the Forth Bridge on Tuesday evening, was ''an area of
considerable misunderstanding because this is for many the first time
they have ever held shares.'' Mr Hosea also said that the atmosphere had
been ''constructive''.
Meanwhile, Scottish Pride's stockbrokers, Allied Provincial in
Glasgow, were yesterday subject to an independent inspection to
investigate the claims of the shareholders action committee that there
had been some irregularities in share dealings.
The result of that inquiry is expected on Friday. It has also emerged
that Alan Wiseman, chairman of Robert Wiseman Dairies, has acquired a
shareholding in Scottish Pride.

BRITAIN'S farming union leaders have underlined the importance of the
European Union to the country's agricultural industry, writes ROY
GREGOR.
Following a meeting in London between Scottish NFU president John Ross
and England and Wales FU president Sir David Naish, both leaders stated
that access to the single European market of 370 million people was
vital to British farm busineses.
''Most agricultural policy decisions affecting British farmers are now
taken in Brussels. It is crucial that the British Government is seen as
a committed member of the Union and at the heart of Europe.''
The union leaders point out that, following the major reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy in 1992, it is unlikely there will be further
major changes this century, although there will be a constant process of
adjustments.
In the longer term the enlargement of the EU towards the east could
precipitate changes, as could further reductions in world farm trade
barriers.
''It is absolutely vital that British farming interests are heards as
these developments occur. The unions will fight against any
discrimination against British agriculture,'' the two leaders said.
* The 3390-acre St John's Kirk Estate, Symington, has been put on the
market at more than #1.6m.
The estate includes St. John's House, named by the Monks of Kelso in
the 12th century. Its five farms include 2200 ewes, one of only a few
commercial flocks in the UK that have MAFF registered health status that
is monitored negative for enzootic abortion and maedi visna.

THERE is a vista that Britain may become the Las Vegas of Europe.
Gone for all time are any delusions that the British are not gamblers
with each Saturday evening a crass BBC television programme revealing
the lucky numbers of the National Lottery which has taken #110m or so
out of the consumer pocket and purse that week and with a reported 75%
of all households participating.
To be fair, some of that money has come from other forms of gambling
with the hardest hit so far appearing to be the bingo operators which
overall have lost about 20% of both attendance and revenue since the
scratchcards were introduced in March.
Stanley Leisure, Britain's fourth-largest bookmaking chain, pointed
put yesterday that in the time when the Lottery was launched in November
to March, there was no measurable effect in its racing division
comprising 424 shops and none whatsoever in casinos which now total 21.
But since then, the number of racing slips has fallen 8%, echoing the
9% drop at Ladbrokes. However, the average stake waged during the year
to April increased 4% to #3.92p and to over #4 in the second half. That
points to the small punter preferring the scratchcard rather than horses
or dogs with the more serious gambler less interested.
There is now anecdotal evidence that the scratchcards are beginning to
lose their popularity, a phenomenon experienced in most other countries
as the returns are fairly mediocre and seem to have as much excitement
as peeling potatoes when revealing the numbers.
Stanley's chairman, Leonard Steinberg, is pressing hard for relaxation
of the present gaming and Lottery legislation to allow a freer climate.
But already there have been substantial changes and with much more
likely to be enacted within the next year. Two new casino games are now
permitted, casino stud poker and superpan 9 to add to the established
dice, roulette, punto blanco and blackjack. Superpan 9 has proved less
popular because the casino operator seems to win too often and will
probably drift on to the sidelines.
In the next few weeks, the Government's proposals resulting from the
consultation paper should be known. That is widely expected to permit
the increase in gaming machines from two to six per outlet. Mr Steinberg
said a more appropriate number would be six per table and that it is
anomalous that the current maximum stake of 20p per machine game for a
#200 maximum win should be taking place within yards of a table where
someone is betting maybe #5000.
Currently casinos cannot advertise in any way, not even in Yellow
Pages. Even in hotels as Stakis with 23 units knows only too well, there
have to be quite separate entrances. There is also a 48-hour waiting
period before one can become a member although that is mostly a problem
in London and to a very much lesser extent in Edinburgh where tourist
business is being lost.
The increase in the ''drop'' or average amount lost per visit rose a
rather startling 9.4% to #93, while attendance improved 1[1/2]% in
like-for-like casinos -- the spend in Scotland for both racing with 26
shops and the four casinos including the two Berkeley units bought in
April for #7.7m is above the group's UK average.
No wonder Stanley is looking for more outlets for a business which saw
margins only slightly lower at 17.4% and should return the long-term
industry average outside London of 18% depending upon the level of
expenditure on refurbishment.
Unlike Stakis, Stanley does not charge a #10 membership fee although
the Glasgow-based company will probably abolish these in due course as a
result of an 8% fall in attendances since its introduction.
In the half-year to June, Stakis did see a 13% rise in the total spent
per head to #135 again underlining what a good business casino operating
is.
Changes in legislation being sought by the gaming industry which is
now very effectively controlled by the regulators also include a
reduction in betting duty to stimulate overall turnover. Currently, the
punter pays 10% tax on the stake money.
There is also a call is to be allowed to bet on the Lottery winning
numbers. That is already in operation in Eire.
The concept is that rather than trying for all six numbers and
therefore standing only the remotest chance of winning, one could try
for just one figure with odds of 6-1, for two numbers 45-1 and for three
about 500-1 which appears on the surface a much more attractive bet than
the #10 from three numbers in the Lottery.
The Lottery has made gambling much more socially acceptable, bringing
in a vast new army of female participants previously reluctant to go
into the smoke-filled betting shop.
Stanley's own profits last year rose 37.3% to #17m which enabled the
dividend to be raised 18% to 6.15p with a 4.15p final.
The shares rose 23p to 367p where they yield just 2% and trade at 17
times earnings -- a rating which underlines the City's perception that
this is a long-term growth stock.

<HEADLINE>Smith New Court shares spurt 20p on bid talks</HEADLINE>

SHARES of Smith New Court, the last remaining major independent
securities house and as such a long rumoured bid target for one of the
US or European investment banks, closed 20p up at 511p after the company
said it was in talks with a small number of parties which could result
in an offer being made. At one point the price had hit 536p.
Ahead of the announcement the shares had already risen 17% since the
middle of last month.
Speculation about Smith New Court has been heightened by the purchase
by overseas groups of several of London's leading investment banks this
year. Smith New Court said, though, that any offer for the company was
likely to be at a small premium to the current share price. Many of the
mooted potential bidders were quick to issue denials yesterday.
US investment houses thought to be eyeing the company include Morgan
Stanley, whose proposed takeover of Warburg fell through last year. But
Morgan Stanley had already denied any interest even before the Smith
announcement. Other possible American contenders are Smith Barney, part
of Travelers Group, which declined to comment, and Bear Stearns.
Merchant banker N M Rothschild has a fully diluted 25.9% stake in
Smith New Court so it has to be assumed since talks are taking place
that it is prepared to sell this holding to a bidder. A spokesman for
Rothschild said: ''At this stage we are not prepared to make any comment
at all''.
Aside from possible US interest, European houses mentioned as possible
bidders are ABN Amro of the Netherlands and Commerzbank of Germany
though the latter said the rumours were without foundation. It is felt
that both could be keen to follow competitors Deutsche Bank, which has
owned Morgan Grenfell for some time, and Dresdner, which recently
acquired Kleinwort, into investment banking in London.
The Dutch ING group acquired Barings after the bank's collapse and
Warburg was acquired by Swiss Bank Corporation this year. So activity in
1995 has been pretty intense in the sector although it is difficult to
make comparisons with Smith New Court which is a more focused
distribution type of business. Overseas banks have been more interested
in the corporate advisory and fund management areas.
On the home front, Schroders has been mentioned as a possible buyer.
However, Schroders, the only one truly independent merchant bank with
substantial capital, is more intent to build up its equity distribution
capacity through organic growth and quickly denied being behind any
possible takeover bid.
''It is nothing to do with us,'' said a company spokesman. Schroders
itself is probably bid proof since it is effectively family controlled.
Profits of Smith New Court, a big equity market maker, fell from
#95.2m to #31.2m in the year to April 28 on low trading volumes and
volatile stock markets. Market conditions had been particularly hostile
in the second half. The company's share price though had been driven by
takeover speculation.

A MOVE towards the larger end of its target range during the second
half of last year has benefited Aberforth Smaller Companies Trust, which
reported yesterday.
Fully-diluted net asset value moved up 8.9% to 178.4p in the six
months to end-June, outstripping a 4.1% advance in the Edinburgh-based
investment trust's benchmark Extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies
index.
Companies at the top end of the UK smaller companies scale
significantly outperformed the minnows during the six months.
The #109m trust, which has been drawing on revenue reserves to fund
gearing of about 10% in recent times, comfortably covered its
maintained, 2.1p interim dividend.
As a whole, smaller companies have lagged behind their larger
counterparts in the All-Share index but John Evans, of investment
management firm Aberforth Partners, believes it is logical to expect a
catch-up period.
There was some evidence of this towards the end of the six-month
period when smaller companies enjoyed the gains experienced by their
larger counterparts during the earlier part of this year.
Further good news on US interest rates would be likely to give smaller
companies a boost. Larger companies have already benefited from events
in the US, with the FTSE-100 index leaping after last week's
quarter-point cut in US rates.
Aberforth's portfolio is overweight in the software and distribution
sectors, and underweight in building and construction.
The trust believes the growth in dividends from invested companies
during the last six months bodes well for the future.
Since inception at the end of 1990, Aberforth's net asset value, with
gross dividends reinvested, has grown by 138.5% against an equivalent
81.6% in the benchmark index.

CALEDONIAN Media Communications, the Aberdeen-based cable television
operator, has firmed up plans to create a new hi-tech telephone network
in Glasgow that will compete with British Telecom in the business
sector.
Caledonian said yesterday it had completed the #850,000 purchase of
Atlantic Telecommunications which has been granted a public
telecommunications operator's licence for Strathclyde region.
Chief executive Graham Duncan said Caledonian will use advanced
microwave radio communications developed for military use to create a
fixed-link telephone system in the greater Glasgow area.
This will use ''cutting-edge technology'' and is the first of its kind
to be established in the UK.
Mr Duncan said the telephone network will be targetted at small and
medium-sized businesses rather than residential users.
Details of pricing will be announced later this year and the system
will be launched commercially around Easter 1996.
Caledonian bought 51% of Atlantic for #125,000 cash in March.
The remaining 49% was purchased in exchange for 2.6 million Caledonian
shares worth #750,000 after the Department of Trade and Industry issued
the vital telecommunication operator's licence to Atlantic last week.
Mr Duncan said the new radio telephone system would cost between #5m
and #10m to set up and should show a return in three years, much less
than the seven to nine year-period for cable television.
Radio is normally used for mobile telephone networks, which are
subject to interference and eavesdropping by unauthorised third parties.
But Caledonian will use much more sophisticated and secure radio
technology to link fixed phones which were traditionally linked directly
to wire networks.
Each telephone will be linked to a flat aerial the size of an A4 sheet
of paper that will interface with Caledonian's local transmitter.
''We are looking at Glasgow as a test-bed,'' Mr Duncan said. If the
system proves successful it will also be launched in Aberdeen, he added.
Caledonian, which was known as Devanha until its stock market
flotation in January, made a pre-tax loss of #678,000 last year on
turnover of #9.8m.
Its cable television networks in Aberdeen, Coventry and other parts of
England has 44,000 subscribers.

THE battle of the cider-makers is hotting up with industry leader H P
Bulmer, which has 45% of the market, and Taunton (34%) both
substantially increasing their advertising spend on brand promotion to
obtain a greater showing in both cider and the overall long drinks
market.
However, Bulmer, with 22% of the Scottish cider market, appears to be
rejecting the own-label and economy sectors more vigorously and seems to
be taking a longer-term view.
In the year to April, pre-tax profits rose 16% to #25m, disregarding
last time's #17.6m of exceptional charges which reflected the sales of
the soft drink and pectin operations and another instalment of the
substantial three-year reorganisation programme.
Volume rose 9% overall compared with the industry rise of 8% and with
Taunton claiming a 15% gain, life must now be very unpleasant for the
minor players concentrated on the cheaper products.
Scrumpy Jack volumes rose by 29% in the premium sector while the
biggest brand, Strongbow, was ahead in line with the overall market but
Woodpecker could only manage a small gain of about 3%.
Overall branded product prices year on year were effectively stable
with Scrumpy Jack slightly ahead but industry averages showed the
own-label and economy brands, which represent just 20% of Bulmer's
volumes, dropping 9%.
Finance director Alan Flockhart queried the Taunton claim that the
price war is over, hence the #4m increase in promotional spend to #24m.
Current-year profits should improve to about #27m before a #2.1m
charge to cover the closure cost of four retail depots as a result of
the Scottish &amp; Newcastle takeover of Chef &amp; Brewer.
The dividend total has been raised 11% to 12p for a 3.3% yield with
the shares at 457p.

DUMBARTON-based Allied Distillers aims to close the traditional 30p
price gap between its flagship Teacher's brand and United Distillers'
more expensive UK market-leader, Bell's.
Allied's marketing director, Paul Hick, forecast that the gap would
close as the company, a subsidiary of UK spirits giant Allied Domecq,
increased investment in Teacher's.
He claimed that Teacher's had been outperforming Bell's during the
last 12 to 18 months.
Allied doubled its marketing spend on Teacher's to #15m during 1994.
United Distillers, which is owned by Guinness, is spending about #16m a
year on Bell's, which was relaunched last year as an eight-year-old
blend.
Teacher's is the number-three brand in the UK. Between it and Bell's
comes Highland Distilleries' Famous Grouse.
Echoing the sentiments of Ken Hitchcock, who was appointed chairman
and chief executive of Whyte &amp; Mackay last month, Mr Hick said the UK
image of Scotch was of traditional Scotland.
He added that it tended to be seen as a ''father's drink''.
Allied is attempting to attract younger drinkers by modernising the
image of Scotch in the UK.

<HEADLINE>#20m investment package completes axle manufacturer's rescue from receivership. Albion Automotive turns full circle</HEADLINE>

ALBION Automotive, the Glasgow axle manufacturer, has completed a
two-year rebound from receivership by negotiating a #20m investment
package to underpin a five-year expansion plan.
The investment was made possible by Albion's return to profitability
less than two years after the collapse of the Leyland DAF group to which
it formerly belonged.
This turnaround occurred two years ahead of schedule. Now Albion,
which makes van and truck axles in Glasgow and other vehicle components
at Leyland in Lancashire, needs fresh capital to expand.
Chief executive Dan Wright said Albion will use the #20m package to
invest in new plant and machinery, develop new products and broaden its
customer base with a sales drive into Continental Europe.
''The UK market recovery has helped us a lot. That recovery is
continuing and we see major opportunities in Europe,'' he said.
At present exports account for only 20% to 25% of Albion's sales, but
commercial and finance manager Rod Hill said: ''We are targetting the
main truck assemblers in Europe.''
Candover Investments, a London-based venture capital firm, has bought
out the creditors who took shares in Albion in November 1993, nine
months after the company went into receivership. Candover and Albion's
three executive directors have between them invested #7m in equity.
Candover provided most of this money, but Mr Wright, Mr Hill and
manufacturing director Jim Hastie have also increased their own minority
stake in Albion.
The Bank of Scotland and other financial backers are providing #13m of
loans, overdraft facilities and leasing arrangements to complete the
#20m investment package.
Mr Wright said that if all goes according to plan, Albion will
supplement this with #17m of reinvestment of its own earnings over the
next five years.
But he warned: ''That extra #17m is entirely dependent on the
performance of the business.''
The investment package provides a good exit for the creditor banks who
were persuaded by receivers Arthur Andersen to take #4m of shares in
Albion to turn it into a going concern.
When Leyland DAF collapsed in February 1993, Albion was making a loss
of #1.4m a year on turnover of #30m and was in danger of simply closing
down.
But Arthur Andersen and Mr Wright, drafted in from his engineering
consultancy Fleming Thermodynamics, devised a plan to return the company
to profitability within four years.
The creditors agreed to buy equity in Albion through a nominee holding
company set up by Arthur Andersen and the receivers provided #6m of loan
guarantees to back Albion's relaunch as an independent firm.
''There is a lot of credit due to them. They gave us the chance to
develop this business,'' Mr Wright said.
Assisted by a recovery in the UK commercial vehicle market, Albion
exceeded its own expectations, returning to profit in March this year
after only 16 months.
Turnover has risen to an annualised #52m at present, but Mr Wright
declined to give profit figures.
The Glasgow factory, which makes standard types of axle, and the
Lancashire plant, which makes crankshafts and chassis components to
order, together employed about 1000 people before the collapse of
Leyland DAF.
Half the workforce lost their jobs when the group went into
receivership. But booming sales and the need to create sales, marketing,
product purchasing and design departments for the newly-independent
company have enabled Albion to create 250 new jobs over the last 18
months.
''Since we have taken on the business, employment levels have gone up
by 50% which we think is quite an achievement,'' said Mr Hill.
The present labour force is 760, of whom 450 work at the Scotstoun
plant in Glasgow.
Mr Wright said Albion would invest #7m over the next five years in the
design and development of new products.
''A company of our size has to use its brain to stay ahead of its
larger competitors,'' he said.
There will also be heavy investment in new plant and machinery to
improve the production line.
While Albion was part of Leyland DAF, it supplied only four customers,
all of whom were other Leyland DAF subsidiaries.
As an independent company it has boosted the number of customers to
13, but 90% of sales still go to former members of the Leyland DAF
group.
Earlier this year, Albion took a major step towards diversification by
clinching a #25m order for crankshafts with Perkins, the engine
manufacturer.
Other new clients include JCB, which makes diggers, and Artix, the
articulated truck division of the US Caterpillar group.
Another key strategy is to diversify the range of components that
Albion supplies to vehicle builders, who increasingly want to outsource
the manufacture of components to sub-contractors.
''What we are looking to do is to supply a comprehensive range of
parts to manufacturers who want to concentrate more on development and
design,'' said Mr Hill.

A NUMBER of factors look set to improve the ''feel-good'' factor and
with it consumer spending in the months ahead.
One of the major positives for consumer spending power is the steady
flow of bulding society mergers which invariably involves some form of
compensation for members.
Following Lloyds Bank's takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester #1800m
will be distributed to C&amp;G members next month, equivalent to almost 1p
off the basic rate of tax, or looked at another way, equivalent to
around 1.7% of quarterly consumer spending.
Using its economic model, James Capel has tried to assess the upper
and lower bounds to the effect on consumer spending. If the #1800m
transfer is treated entirely as an increase in income in one quarter,
the model suggests that consumer spending in that quarter would be
roughly 0.5% higher than would otherwise be the case and around 0.2%
higher in the following quarter.
If the transfer is treated entirely as an increase in personal sector
wealth (as it would be treated in the national accounts) the model
suggests that the impact on consumer spending would be negligible.
While theories of consumer spending suggest that if there is a
temporary increase in income most of the money tends to be saved, it is
unlikely that at least some will not feed through to the High Street.
Indeed, according to Adam Cole of brokers James Capel, personal sector
windfall gains from impending building society mergers will boost
consumer spending significantly over the coming years.
This week's announcement of a #1350m merger between Abbey National and
the National &amp; Provincial building society, which is expected to be
completed within a year's time, is not expected to have a huge impact on
consumer spending because most of the deal involves an offer of Abbey
National shares.
However, using the example of what happened following the Abbey
National's conversion to a bank in July 1987, James Capel estimates that
the Leeds Permanent merger with the Halifax building society will add at
least half a per cent to consumer spending in 1997. The precise impact
of the merger on consumer spending will depend on the proportion of free
shares liquidated and secondly on the proportion of the liquid assets
created that is consumed.
Add to all this the #21bn of money becoming available in the first few
months of next year with the maturation of Tax Exempt Special Savings
Account (TESSA) scheme, not to mention the likelihood of some form of
tax cut in this November's budget, and the stage is being set for a
shopping spree the like of which has not been seen for several years.

BUILDING and civil engineering company Henry Boot (Scotland) yesterday
signed a contract for the construction of a #20.5m water treatment plant
at Carron Valley, outside Falkirk.
The contract, let by Central Regional Council, will be worth about
#13m to Henry Boot during the next 2[1/2] years.
Henry Boot will design and build the new works. Its partner in the
project, Patterson Water Treatment, will provide the technology which
ensures the output of the plant meets European drinking water standards.
The contract will be worth about #7.5m to Patterson, a subsidiary of
London-based utility Thames Water.
Donald Forsyth, managing director of Sheffield-based Henry Boot's
Scottish subsidiary, is convinced that the industry remains in recession
and has witnessed no improvement in margins.
However, in spite of this, Henry Boot (Scotland), which turns over
between #25m and #30m annually, has been able to secure contracts worth
more than #30m during the last two months.
Yesterday's contract is in line with the company's strategy of
pursuing design-and-build work, which offers a better opportunity for a
decent margin.
Other recent awards include a #6m contract for the construction of a
distribution centre at Cambuslang, for Leeds-based dog food group
Batley's.
Henry Boot has also secured an #8.5m contract for the renovation and
reconstruction of the seven-storey Lomond House office block, in
Glasgow's George Square. This contract was let by the Co-operative
Insurance Society.
The company is also carrying out a #2.7m refurbishment of high-rise
flats at Pollok for Glasgow District Council. It has been awarded a
#1.5m contract for a new drainage system in Anstruther by Fife Regional
Council.
Mr Forsyth, who has not yet seen much work flowing from the
Government's Private Finance Initiative, said market conditions remained
extremely tough.
He added: ''We are still in recession and I think people are still
frightened to invest.''
Design work on the Carron Valley project will start immediately and
Henry Boot hopes to be on site by the end of August.
Last year, the company completed a design-and-build contract for water
treatment works at Overtown in Lanarkshire for Strathclyde Regional
Council, in conjunction with Patterson.

THE GOVERNMENT has responded to pressure to exempt private investors
in unit trusts investing in gilts and bonds from the new tax regime for
gilts.
The proposals called for capital gains achieved on investment in gilts
to be taxed as income, though the Government has already exempted
private investors with money directly in gilts from the tax change on
holdings of up to #200,000. Now investors in gilts through unit trusts
will also be exempt up to a similar limit. There had been fears that
units would be subject to double taxation.
Michael Jack, Treasury Financial Secretary, said in response to a
Parliamentary question that the exemption would ''ensure collective
schemes continue to offer efficient access to the full range of PEP
opportunities, including the corporate PEPs which are deservedly
attracting so much recent attention.''
The Treasury has also bowed to requests from the financial community
that the introduction of the changes be delayed to give more time for
consultation on the details. Instead of coming into effect this month
they will be introduced from the start of the next tax year.
The investment trust industry is relieved that zero dividend
Preference shares of split level trusts will also be exempt. These
shares roll up capital gains at a predetermined rate and are often used
in school fees plans. These would have been rendered useless had the new
regime been applied to them.

Moscow, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin was recovering well from heart trouble and in
full control of Russia's nuclear arsenal, his spokesman said.
Yeltsin, enduring fierce criticism over his handling of a military
campaign in the rebel Chechen region, even scored a political victory in
absentia. A communist-backed motion to start impeachment proceedings
failed in the State Duma.
Presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev, reacting to speculation at
home and abroad since Yeltsin's sudden admission to hospital yesterday,
said it was inappropriate to cast doubt on Yeltsin's ability to govern.
''Everyone has a right to be ill, including the president,'' he told
the BBC. Yeltsin's blood pressure was stable and his chest pains had
gone.
Doctors monitoring the 64-year-old president's condition, a
deterioration of a long-standing ailment, planned to discharge him from
hospital on Monday.
Medvedev said Yeltsin, who has often looked frail in recent months,
was fit enough to get out of bed after a good night's sleep and had
signed a number of documents.
''The nuclear button is with him in the Central Clinic-Hospital,''
Medvedev said.
Control over the button was a big issue when then Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev was removed from power in 1991 and imprisoned at his
holiday home by hardline opponents who declared him too ill to govern.
After that failed coup, Gorbachev, and then Yeltsin, always made clear
they retained full powers when ill, on holiday, or abroad.
Yeltsin referred to the button in January, saying it was in a black
suitcase he always carried. It gave him an instant link with Defence
Minister Pavel Grachev and Russia's top generals.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who would step in as temporary
head of state if Yeltsin were incapacitated, said after a 20-minute
telephone conversation with the president: ''Boris Yeltsin is, like all
of us, a normal person who can have a minor health problem.''
The president was diagnosed as suffering from an ischaemic heart
condition, a constriction of the blood supply to his heart.
Yeltsin, who was visited by his wife Naina, plans to go ahead with a
visit to Norway next week.
Opponents have been quick to cite speculation about Yeltsin's health
and drinking in pressing him to step down or refrain from seeking a
second term as president in June next year.--Reuter.

Los Angeles, Wednesday
ACTRESS Elizabeth Hurley attended the Los Angeles premiere of her
boyfriend Hugh Grant's film comedy last night -- but her reluctance was
obvious.
She failed to smile -- even fleetingly -- for photographers, although
Grant compensated with a series of nervous grins.
Instead Miss Hurley was stony-faced and looked so gaunt that onlookers
speculated that she had lost weight.
The 29-year-old Estee Lauder model also decided against her usual
dazzling and revealing style of gown, instead wearing a simple short,
white, figure-hugging dress.
A plunging neckline was her one concession to the sort of daring
outfits with which she has been associated since appearing at the
premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral in a sensational black Versace
safety-pinned number last summer.
The opening of the film, Nine Months, came hours after Grant pleaded
no contest to a charge of lewd conduct following his arrest last month
for being involved in a sex act in a car with Hollywood prostitute
Divine Brown.
Grant, who was not at the hearing, was fined about #800 and placed on
two years' probation.
Last night Grant held Miss Hurley's hand tightly as the couple arrived
at the premiere, while she lagged slightly behind and appeared to be
trying to stay in the background.
Miss Hurley kept the film world and fans speculating until the 11th
hour over whether or not she would accompany her errant boyfriend to the
film.
With a single cross and chain around her neck, the actress was the
picture of the wronged woman trying valiantly to put the past behind
her.
When she looked directly at Grant, her expression was anything but
forgiving.
Grant refused to answer reporters' questions about the state of their
relationship as the couple arrived for the premiere of Nine Months, in
which he stars as a bumbling bachelor forced to face commitment when his
girlfriend announces she is pregnant.

Rosalyn Higgins, 58, was the only candidate in voting by the Security

caused by the recent retirement of 81-year-old Sir Robert Jennings of
Britain.
Professor Higgins, of the London School of Economics, will fill the
remainder of Sir Robert's nine-year term ending in 2000.
Ambassador Satya Nandan of Fiji, who was presiding over the General
Assembly, called it a ''historic election in that the UN for the first
time elected a woman judge to the International Court of Justice'', as
the 50-year-old World Court is officially called.
Professor Higgins has appeared as an advocate in a number of cases

Srinagar, Wednesday
KASHMIRI militants holding five Westerners threatened today to kill
their hostages if India failed to meet their deadline for release of 20
captured guerrilla leaders.
''If our demands are not met by July 15 we will kill them,'' militants
said in a note delivered to the Associated Press in Srinagar, summer
capital of largely Hindu India's only Muslim-majority state.
The note carried the names of the five hostages -- two Britons, an
American, a German, and a Norwegian.
A blurred photograph delivered along with the note showed five people
sitting in a row with their hands bound.
The back of the photograph bore the name Al Faran, the previously
unknown militant group which claimed responsibility for the kidnappings.
The note was unsigned, but carried the names of the five hostages in
English.
Officials have named the hostages as Britons Paul Wells and Keith
Mangan, Donald Fred Hutchings of the US, Dirk Hasert of Germany, and
Norwegian Hans Christian Ostro.
''If the government makes advances, the government of India will be
responsible for the consequences. If our demands are not met by July 15
we will kill them,'' the note said.
Dozens of militant groups are fighting the Indian Government either
for independence or to join Pakistan, which rules one-third of the
disputed Himalayan region.
Police and hospitals say more than 20,000 people have been killed
since the rebellion erupted five years ago.
Westerners have been kidnapped before during the rebellion. Only one,
an Israeli, has been killed. Many Indians have been kidnapped and
several have been killed.
The note sent today was the first time Al Faran had claimed
responsibility for abducting Ostro.
A government spokesman said yesterday that the Norwegian had been
heading for the Amarnath cave, the destination of an annual Hindu
pilgrimage through the mountains, and disappeared on Saturday in the
mountains around Zojibal, 12 miles from Pahalgam.
Hasert was abducted in the mountains on Saturday some 15 miles from
Pahalgam.
The two Britons and two Americans were abducted by Al Faran from the
resort of Ladervat, in the Pahalgam area, when they stopped for the
night during a trekking holiday on July 4.
Two British women and a Canadian in the group were released along with
two guides.
One of the Americans, John Childs, later escaped. Childs said
yesterday that he would not talk to the media until the other hostages
were released.
The Al Faran note said Childs was released on humanitarian grounds,
but gave no details.
A British diplomat from Delhi, liaising with the Indian Government in
Srinagar, said that the relatives of the hostages planned to make an
appeal for their release tomorrow, only two days before the deadline
expires.
Police in Srinagar said they had been contacted by families and
officials from several countries about worried about relatives on
holiday in Kashmir.
Indian officials said they had yet to establish contact with Muslim
militants believed to be the kidnappers.--Reuter.

Jerusalem, Wednesday
A GROUP of influential rabbis ruled today that Israeli soldiers must
disobey any order to evacuate army bases or Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
The decision drew an enraged reaction from Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who said rabbis were seeking to turn Israel into a ''banana
republic''.
''This is one of the most severe things that a small number of rabbis
could do. It is inconceivable that Israel be turned into a banana
republic,'' Rabin said.
The military, anticipating the rabbis' edict as Israel and the PLO
negotiate an Israeli redeployment in the occupied West Bank, said on
Sunday that it expected troops to remember officers' commands took
precedent over Jewish religious edicts.
''We have ruled that there is a Biblical prohibition against
evacuating Israeli army bases and handing the places over to the control
of goyim (non-Jews),'' said Rabbi Haim Druckman after a three-hour
meeting by leading clergymen.
''This poses a danger to lives, and a danger to the existence of the
country,'' he added, saying the ruling also covered Jewish settlements.
Druckman quoted the 12th-Century Jewish sage Maimonides as having
ruled that ''even if the king orders you to transgress the word of the
Bible, do not listen to him''.
Police Minister Moshe Shahal said he had asked the attorney-general to
examine whether the rabbis could be charged with inciting a rebellion.
Rabin said rabbis could not place themselves above a
democratically-elected government.
Yesterday, a right-wing Israeli was sentenced by a military court to
14 days' imprisonment for refusing to do reserve duty in the West Bank
town of Bethlehem. The soldier said he did not want to participate in a
redeployment.
Israeli and PLO officials, negotiating a widening of Palestinian
self-rule, are racing to nail down details of a long-delayed army
pull-out from West Bank towns before a July 25 signing date for an
accord on the withdrawal.
The rabbis see the West Bank as an integral part of the Biblical Land
of Israel which they maintain God deeded to the Jews in the Old
Testament.
''It is forbidden for any Jew to take part in any act aiding the
evacuation of a settlement, base, or installation,'' Druckman
said.--Reuter.

Moscow, Wednesday
RUSSIAN officials have condemned speculation over President Boris
Yeltsin's health, saying he is recovering fast from a heart problem and
should be ready to leave hospital on Monday.
The president is feeling better, his spokesman said, and is working
from the Moscow hospital where he was taken yesterday after a
long-standing heart condition suddenly became worse.
''The nuclear button is with him in the Central Clinic-Hospital,''
Sergei Medvedev told the BCC, adding that it was inappropriate to
speculate over Yeltsin's ability to govern.
The 64-year-old president has often looked frail and unsteady in
recent months and his opponents have used speculation about his health
and drinking to press for his retirement.
However they failed to push a motion to start impeachment proceedings
through the State Duma lower house of Parliament today, handing Yeltsin
a political victory in his absence.
Communist MPs had wanted to impeach Yeltsin, who was elected president
in 1991, over his dissolution of Parliament two years later, and his
handling of the long-running Chechnya conflict and a bloody hostage
crisis in southern Russia last month.
However only 168 MPs supported their motion, far short of the 226
votes needed to starte impeachment procedures.
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who would take over as temporary
head of state if Yeltsin were incapacitated, lashed out at media reports
of the illness, which was diagnosed as a constriction of the blood
supply to the heart.
''The President, like everyone else, has a right to get ill,'' he
said, one of a series of officials to express surprise at the rumours
fuelled by the news.
Foreign exchange dealers on US and European markets were thrown into a
panic today when word went round that Yeltsin's health had deteriorated.
Some even feared he may have died, indicating a lack of faith in
official statements about the health of Kremlin leaders dating from
Communist times when bulletins were scarce and often misleading.
Today, as well as volunteering a statement on the nuclear button,
which Yeltsin has said gave him a direct link with Russia's military
chiefs, officials took the unusal step of specifically denying the
market rumours.
A senior security official told Interfax news agency there had been no
deterioration in the president's condition since earlier today, when
Medvedev said he had slept well and was fit enough to get out of bed and
sign several documents.--Reuter.

Hong Kong, Wednesday
GOVERNOR Chris Patten escaped a humiliating vote of no confidence from
the Hong Kong legislature today, the first such challenge in 150 years
of British colonial rule.
Mr Patten, the 28th governor of Hong Kong who plans to be its last,
had dismissed the motion as an empty gesture and said he would not lose
sleep over it, but government officials still lobbied hard against it.
The motion was defeated by a margin of almost two to one with 35 votes
against, 17 for, and four abstentions, saving Mr Patten's ''face'', an
important concept in Chinese society.
The vote, brought by Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy party, had no
constitutional significance because the governor answers only to the
British Government and not to Hong Kong's 56-member Legislative Council.
However it could have proved an embarrassing experience for a colonial
administration which has long prided itself on its consensus politics in
the absence of full democracy.
The Democratic Party, once Mr Patten's closest ally in the council,
proposed the motion to demonstrate its fury over last month's
Sino-British agreement, reached behind closed doors, for a post-1997
Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.
They argued that the British kowtowed to Chinese demands and
jeopardised the rule of law by agreeing to a court with powers too
watered down to guarantee judicial freedom in Hong Kong when it reverts
to China in less than two years' time.
The business lobby, pro-Beijing MPs, and most independents voted
against or abstained from the motion.
Democratic Party leader Martin Lee vowed to fight the Court of Final
Appeal Bill when it goes to the Council later this month.--Reuter.

THE Old Club, Princes Street, Edinburgh, Monday, July 10; at a corner
table with a spectacular view of the Castle: ''Godfrey, how lovely to
see you. Sit yourself down man, you look as though you had run up the
Waverley Steps in a trench coat. Large medium dry for my guest,
Wilson.''
''Thank you, Sir Jock. I must confess I could do with a libation. How
have things been with you since your retiral from the Service? I thought
S of S made a splendid speech at your farewell party.''
''Yes, sound fellow that Lang. Well, I have been busier than ever
really: vice-principal of the University of the Outer Hebrides,
part-time member of the Commission to Save the Osprey, local enterprise
board asked me to soldier on, president of the Heavy Horse Society --
one does what one can. Anyway let's not waste time talking about old
codgers like me -- what's happening at St Andrew's House since the new
fella arrived?''
''Everything, Sir Jock. I am not even sure it's called St Andrew's
House anymore, it has probably been re-named St Michael's and been sold
and leased back from Marks and Spencer. The whole place is in absolute
turmoil, everyone checking their early-retirement options, learning the
words of Land of Hope and Glory.''
''Good heavens, if you excuse my French, that does sound worrying. I
have to say, Godfrey, that the little chap does seem to be cultivating a
new image. His PR's better than that actor chappie Hugh Grunt's.''
'I think it's Grant, Sir Jock. But you are quite right -- he had the
reptiles in the other day, most of them having written that he was as
welcome back in Scotland as the Black Death or Edward I, and he charmed
the snakes better than a Bombay market entertainer.''
''What about the new team?''
''Well, there is this Lord Jamie . . .''
''Yes, I remember him, decent cove, pale-faced, given to walking
backwards, opening doors for his own drivers.''
''No, that's actually Lord James who is still there; this is another
of the landed gentry who once cleaned up Kensington for reasons that
escape me. Then there's Kynoch, who took over when Stewart went hell for
leather at the great unwashed, and still to earn his spurs, plus a
fellow Robertson who seems to have been some sort of teacher.''
''Wasn't he always attacking Lang?''
''No, that's the other Robertson, the Labour one who looks like a
pixie in a pin-stripe suit. He is the alternative to the present
incumbent.''
''Not a lot of choice, I give you that. But what does this S of S
actually want to do?''
''Well, he wants to meet the people, hear their ideas. He insists any
pressure group will be welcome. This week he is meeting the Pumpherston
Bowling Club who wish us to withdraw from the EU, the Scottish Country
Dance Society on corporal punishment in schools, and a Mr Paul Gascoigne
on the desirability of trasferring all his millions into Royal Bank
notes.
''Next week he sees Cosla, whose members, he says, are all his pals
now and that he always wanted to give more power to local government.
They are being invited round for champagne cocktails to be told they can
spend in excess of the National Lottery for all he cares.''
''Have you tried ringin' Sir Hubert at the Treasury? He is usually
quite good at stampin' on damn-fool notions about extra public
expenditure.''
''No, Sir Jock, on the new privatised phone system, all calls,
including those made from mobiles in the bogs, can be traced. I don't
want to end my career on half-pension or sorting out the quota system at
Ag and Fish.''
''What's his big idea, though, his main policy plank?''
''Cutting red tape.''
''What!''
''That's true, Sir Jock, he is determined to slash away at the
bureaucracy, to trim the number of quangos, to make more bodies more
accountable to the electorate. No more memos in triplicate, I'm
afraid.''
''Dammit, Godfrey, we invented red tape; it was born in the Civil
Service to keep Ministers from knowing too much and therefore doing as
little damage as possible during their tenure. We can't have the
delicate balance disturbed.
''As for quangos, they were another of our great ideas; they did their
job quietly in a non-political manner, far away from prying eyes. It is
just not on.
''But tell me, Godfrey, is any of this going to work? Are the
Conservatives in Scotland not about as popular on the doorstep as
Jehovah's Witnesses during a live broadcast of a match from Hampden?''
''Well, if you listen to him, Sir Jock, he will tell you that most
Scottish people are more small 'c' conservative than they let on, that
they do not want the Tories to be pseudo socialists who went to public
schools, that they are pretty sick of the lefties feathering their own
nests, or their relatives', in local councils. Anyway, since the Blair
arrival the Labour Party has moved well to the right of the German
Christian Democrats. The S of S wants the electorate to believe that he
is a caring politician who will fight waste and corruption but make sure
the Scottish people do not suffer as a result. It would be a
considerable error of judgment to underestimate the man.
''If he succeeds it will be some prize; if he fails there is unlikely
to be a second chance.''
''But has the leopard really changed its spots, are we really seeing a
new humble Michael Forsyth?''
''I think that information falls under the terms of the Official
Secrets Act. Allow me to buy you a drink, Sir Jock.''
''Make it a large one, Wilson.''

BIGGEST is best seems to be the maxim for industry today, whether in
food retailing, banking, pharmaceuticals, package holidays or the media.
Now building societies are following suit.
Earlier this week came the long expected news of Abbey National's
merger with the National and Provincial building society, a move which
will consolidate Abbey's position as the UK's second biggest mortgage
lender with a 15.2% market share. This follows hard on the heels of the
merger between the Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies and
Lloyds Bank's takeover of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester.
All involved boast of the benefits that merger will bring to
customers, staff, shareholders, and members. Being the biggest means
that you can throw your weight around if necessary, and influence
decisions in the corporate playground.
Whether customers see much improvement in service as opposed to an
increase in the amount of junk mail they receive is a moot point. I have
noticed a distinct lengthening of the queues in Abbey National branches
since it converted to a public company and began expanding its
operations.
Still, for those with a gambling streak there is money to be made in
speculating where the next building society merger will occur. The
chances of reaping some form of financial reward are much better than
those associated with the National Lottery.
The Alliance and Leicester, which failed to secure N&amp;P's hand in
marriage, is widely tipped to be the next takeover target. With just 4%
of the mortgage market, it is too small to play a leading role in what
has become an increasingly competitive market faced with sluggish house
sales. Those with more cash to gamble could do worse than open accounts
with as many of the medium-sized building societies as possible.
Businesses seem to believe that to be successful and internationally
competitive they have to be a market leader in their respective
industries. While biggest may be best for some business sectors, it is
not necessarily the case if you are a customer or an employee.
True, by spreading operating costs across a bigger customer base,
businesses are able to realise economies of scale and fund investment
into new product development. But just being a well-known name in the
market is no longer a guarantee of success.
J Sainsbury is a visible example of this. For years it has been the
market leader in UK food retailing and has rightly won plaudits for its
products and growth record. However, recently it has begun to lose sales
to more customer-centred and marketing-driven competitors, Asda and
Tesco. It just goes to show that even the biggest cannot afford to rest
on their laurels.
Marks &amp; Spencer suffered a similar fate a few years ago, but has since
sharpened up the attractiveness of its products both in terms of design
and prices, so much so that it has regained its position as the
bench-mark for other clothing retailers.
There is undoubtedly a need for consolidation among industries such as
pharmaceuticals where the costs of researching and developing new drugs
are such that it is impossible for all but the largest to prosper in
what has become an increasingly regulated and cost-conscious world
market.
However, independent operators and those in favour of retaining a
diverse range of businesses in areas such as grocery and travel need not
worry too much. Moves towards consolidation do not necessarily sound the
death knell for smaller businesses. There will always be a place for
niche players able to offer specialist products and superior customer
service. One thinks of thriving delicatessens, specialist cheese shops,
local grocers, not to mention the 24-hour convenience stores that
prosper in the face of intense competition from the big three
supermarket groups.
Despite views to the contrary there are still many hundreds of small
independent tour operators. Many of these offer special activity
holidays tailored to appreciation of subjects such as art history,
wildlife or places off the beaten track. Rather than acting as mere
processors of tourists, staff in such companies are able to provide
in-depth information, and are willing to tailor holidays to individual
requirements.
In the case of building societies it seems highly likely that a
thriving sector of long established small and medium-sized firms will
survive, probably based in the regions. These will be offering something
unique, whether it be a service geared to the local community or extra
high interest postal accounts.

WHAT does Tony Blair really want? The man who declares extinct
Labour's historic relationship with the trade unions -- ''armlock'' in
his unlovely language -- is the same man who is happy to accept the
hospitality of Rupert Murdoch. The man close to destroying the
Conservative Party as an electoral force -- a decade out of power looks
a good bet -- is also, increasingly, the man who resembles the best
leader real Tories never had.
This is not, at least not yet, just ritual abuse. Blair is the
representative figure of the age, in whom is combined the free market
delirium of the eighties, the ''tough but tender'' poesy of Owen's
Social Democrats, and the unapologetic populism that joined Thatcher and
Essex Man in matrimony. Yet none of it -- and certainly none of the dozy
platitudes of communitarianism, that ethical suburbia -- really explains
what Blair is after.
Another Labour leader might have felt obliged, in the wake of Michael
Foot's libel action against Murdoch, to reject an invitation to address
News International executives on a tropical isle. Not Blair. Another
Labour leader might have told the Transport and General Workers' Union
this week that they had no special rights but that, given an existing
agreement in principle, there was no honest reason why a figure for a
national minimum wage shouldn't be set. Not Blair.
It is easy to say he simply wants to be popular; who doesn't? Thus,
the votes of Murdoch's editors are thought more valuable than the votes
of the T&amp;G; Tory education policies are deemed more profitable than any
Labour principle; and taxation policies are just an echo, beneath all
the talk about training, of those espoused by honest Ken Clarke.
But there is more to it than that. Blair is socially conservative, for
example, not simply because that appeals to the Sun and the Daily Mail.
He is a genuine moralist, a muscular middle-class Christian whose idea
of community is, of necessity, somewhat different from those who do not
happen to live in Islington.
He is, too, a social democrat by conviction, not expediency, having
said more than once -- and demonstrated in the Clause IV debate -- that
he prefers free markets to the central ideas of socialism. The fact that
he leads a faction called the Labour Party thus begins increasingly to
look like an accident of history. This, after all, is the man who
blesses contacts with the Liberals, ''understands'' why MPs deserted
Labour for the SDP, admires certain of Thatcher's traits, and happily
admits he will borrow any Tory policies (never mind Tory voters) which
seem useful.
His flirtation with Murdoch is interesting, if only because it is so
entirely unnecessary. After their relentless assault on John Major
before and during the Tory leadership election, the right-wing papers
are not, with one or two exceptions, likely to attempt to assassinate
Blair the way they assassinated Neil Kinnock.
Their readers have swung to Labour and their own prescriptions for the
Tories have been ignored. Blair simply doesn't need them. Neither,
however, does he need to put the unions ''in their place''.
Most long ago gave up any hope of seeing Conservative industrial
relations legislation repealed, few are prospering, and their importance
to Labour's finances is diminishing. There is no winter of discontent
pencilled in for the first year of a Blair administration.
Yet ostentatiously -- and the theatrical ostentation of the leader's
''courageous'' speeches is becoming more obvious -- he makes it clear
that the party neither requires nor even wants the union link.
Blair looks and sounds more and more like a man who believes anyone
who votes Labour has no need of trade unions; he doesn't understand,
this bringer of economic justice for all, what on earth they are for.
But why go out of his way to make it obvious?
Equally, he will go out of his way -- halfway around the world, in
fact -- to play footsie with the Australian-American whose newspaper
defamed and insulted cuddly old Michael Foot. It won't win him any
support worth having -- Gough Whitlam found that out the hard way in
Australia -- and it won't, given the state of the Tory party, affect any
elections.
So why? What we have here, I think, is a one-nation politician, the
sort David Owen aspired to be, the sort John Major pretends to be, the
sort Paddy Ashdown is always assumed to be. This is a politician who
lives by clever ideas, not ideology, whose governing principle is that
all sections of society are equally deserving, that the CBI matters as
much as the TUC, that the right of middle-class parents to choose their
schools is equal to the right of the working class just to have decent
schools.
Then again, Blair would probably reject any idea of class as divisive,
unlike the hazy notion of community that looms so large in his speeches.
He sees no requirement for conflict in the old style, not least,
perhaps, because he would find himself on the wrong side of the divide.
But he also seems truly to believe in an all-embracing national
community of shared wealth, shared values, and common allegiances in
which all of the old divisions have been erased and we all live happily
ever after.
Ambitious? Certainly. Dangerous? Probably. Wrong? More so, perhaps,
than any of John Major's wistful nonsense about village greens and warm
beer.
Blair's utopianism -- watch the eyes, if you dare -- ignores the
realities of the British state even as it aims to reform that state. The
endorsements of Rupert Murdoch and a T&amp;G member surviving on less than
#4 an hour are not of equal worth. How did a Labour leader ever come to
imagine they were?

MICHAEL FORSYTH, Scotland's new governor-general, may be a right-wing
Tory but he is not averse to a spot of Stalinist re-writing of history.
We take as our source the publication Who's Who. In the 1990 edition
Michael proudly lists under the heading ''Publications'' such tomes as
The Case for a Poll Tax, No Turning Back, Down with the Rates, Politics
on the Rates, and many other titles of a staunch Thatcherite mien.
But post-Thatcher, and presumably in a spirit of conciliation and
moderation, Mr Forsyth's listing in Who's Who contains no reference to
these stirring books. Poll Tax? Shoving weans up chimneys? Who me?
Plaid a blinder
WE have an early sighting of Gazza at lunch at La Parmigiana
restaurant, Kelvinbridge, a favourite West End of Glasgow haunt for
Rangers players. We would normally leave these chaps in peace and not
mention their dining habits but Oor Paul does not seem to be about to
adopt a low profile. As well as the haircut, he was sporting a suit in
Rangers tartan, complete with waistcoat. At least his taste in food
appears to favour upmarket Italian nosh and not your standard
Ibrox-squad kebab.
* A TALE of ecumenism gone too far comes to us from Mr Tom Walker of
Stonehaven. He tells us that one of the altar boys at the local St
Mary's Roman Catholic Church last Sunday was wearing a Rangers strip
under his cassock.
Auntie's sordid
sex shame
A MR Charles Denton, high heid yin of BBC drama, was in Glasgow
yesterday to launch the many delights which dear Auntie has in store for
us in the next year. He tells us he performed the same function the day
before in London and was mightily upset that the gutter press down there
chose to describe his department's output as a collection of under-age
sex, foul language, violence, and bad language.
He was sure the Scottish press couldn't match these heights of
hysteria. We will do our best.
We have surveyed BBC Scotland's drama putput for the coming year and
have to report that it is a shameful concoction of canine sexual abuse,
furtive sex up closes, and naked lust at a woodwork class in Tarbert.
We start with Hamish Macbeth, the story of the Plockton copper. Which
of the two women in his life will Hamish end up with, the BBC news
handout asks breathlessly. We have spoken to a drama department insider
and can reveal that the Plockton plod actually develops an unhealthily
close relationship with Wee Jock II, the new West Highland terrier in
his lfe.
Meanwhile in Cardiac Arrest, Tom Watson, the actor who plays the nice,
quiet consultant, Mr Docherty, tells us that in the new series his
wooing of Mrs Trimble finally gets into top gear. ''There may even be a
knee trimble situation,'' he told us. Honest.
Sex in the close is served up in Ruffian Hearts which is described as
''a comedy of romance and survival circling a single Glasgow stairwell.
A kind of La Ronde with broken hearts and Scottish wit.''
Finally there is A Mug's Game, from the people who last year brought
you the award-winning Taking over the Asylum. It is set in Tarbert, Loch
Fyne, a hamlet famous for its exotic and hot-blooded women.
We should point out that some of the above may be exaggerated because
we were trying to compete with the English tabloid people. For those who
prefer straightforward brutality, we recommend the BBC film Small Faces
which was made under the working title Easterhouse and is about three
boys from a Glasgow scheme who get involved in senseless violence.
Highland imagery
THE Shearings Coaching Holidays spring and summer brochure is brought
to our attention. Gracing the front cover of the ''England, Wales and
Ireland'' edition is a very picturesque photo of the tranquil Wester
Ross town of Plockton.
Some mistake we said and phoned Shearings to find out. No, the nice
lady assured us. Images of Scotland are popular so they thought they
would put the snap on all their British brochures. Hope the folk who
book a Shearings holiday to Stoke-on-Trent are not too disappointed
about the lack of lochs and mountains.
Flavour of France
OUR trip down the Auld Alliance memory lane nears its end. Mrs Betty
Shedden of Elderslie writes to us with a cautionary tale of being too
much of a Francophile.
The Sheddens were wont, during their many motoring trips around the
French countryside, to sing loudly and frequently the praises of la
belle France. Much to the boredom of their younger daughter. One year,
travelling through Calais en route to Lille, the couple were enthusing
as usual, remarking on how everything was prettier and more special that
it was back home, how the air was cleaner, the food more delectable and
so on, while daughter sat in back, silent.
Suddenly, the stretch of road they travelled was filled with the
pungent aroma of ham. ''Wow!'' exclaim Maw and Paw. ''Just smell that!
Delicious! Oh, you know you're in France now. You don't get smells like
that back home, do you?'' A few miles farther along the road, the scent
was still strongly with them. Inhaling deeply and rapturing over the
fact that this area must surely specialise in ham-curing, the parents
are interrupted by the daughter in the back seat who says that the
delicous aroma may have something to do with the fact that she has been
eating a packet of smokey bacon flavour crisps.

KEITH BRUCE bandies words with Ivor Cutler as the comedian prepares to
take the stage in Glasgow.
IN his unique brogue suggestive of a native of some unconquered Argyll
island, Ivor Cutler asked: ''Will you send me a copy of the published
article.'' ''Certainly,'' I said, as I always do.
''They all say that,'' said Cutler, ''but they never send them.''
The most overquoted line about Cutler is George Melly's remark that he
is ''very funny in a sinister sort of way'', but that observation rather
illustrated what he meant.
There are pleasing signs that Cutler's oblique ''take'' on existence
is finding a new lease of life in the contemporary psyche. His
appearance on Sunday at Glasgow Fair could be a foible of those
responsible for organising the event, but the plan to release three CDs
of Cutler's poetry and songs -- material recorded in the 1970s and 80s
-- and the prospect of ''new ones as well'' are presumably driven by
some sort of commercial considerations.
The classic live album Life In A Scotch Sitting Room Vol 2 has already
been re-issued on Creation records off-shoot Rok-Ola. Recorded over
three nights in 1977 at Glasgow's Third Eye Centre, Cutler's short
stories take all the hoary old perceptions about Scots dourness and
meanness and give them his own bizarre slant. Championed by radio DJ
John Peel at the time, he still gets airplay from him and the BBC's Andy
Kershaw.
Cutler professes himself baffled by this. ''I've asked Peel: why do
you do it? Because I'm an odd sod in the context.
''Peel just looked at me and said: 'You're kidding'.''
Now in his seventies, Cutler does not enjoy travelling, but agreed to
do a gig a month, and had found himself with a rather more demanding,
but still fairly leisurely schedule that sees him visiting Aberdeen,
Manchester, and -- on Sunday -- Glasgow's Fair Festival on Glasgow
Green.
Born and brought up in the city, his father was a commercial traveller
and he remembers Fair holidays in Douglas, Isle of Man, and Scarborough.
People from Whitecraigs did not go down the Clyde. But he has retained
an affection for the Clyde Coast.
''I am very fond of Largs. It is quiet and civilised and it is the
sort of place where there is somewhere you can go when it rains.''
After an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce and an inauspicious wartime
career with the RAF, Cutler went into teaching in Paisley. When he left,
initially for the rather different regime of A S Neill's Summerhill in
1950, he cut his tawse into 50 pieces, one for each pupil.
''I taught up to 1980, and in an oblique sense I am still teaching. I
finally decided I'd had it with British poetry and I wanted to act as a
catalyst for people who had nothing to unlearn.''
Cutler set about teaching his writing method to others. ''I taught 17
people and then my brain started to hurt -- I had a headache for months
and months.''
He said the process cannot be put down in a book. ''The trick is to
avoid using your intellect. The intellect is what looks over your
shoulder and says: 'What are you doing?' I'm an intuitive man and I can
help intuitive people.''
That help involves setting a clockwork egg-timer and challenging his
students to complete a poem before the bell rings. He recommends the use
of nonsense words -- which exclude the intellect -- until a vocabulary
of sound is acquired, when English words may be ''snuck in''. His own
volume A Stuggy Pren, published last year, epitomises the technique. The
results of his tutelage can be seen in the work of Katherine Pierpoint
and Scot John Burnside.
''I've worked out to my satisfaction that I communicate from my
unconscious to the listeners' unconscious. I don't really know what I'm
doing and they are getting answers to questions they didn't know needed
asking. My voice has a useful character and the words are only a
vehicle.''
Cutler sighed, recognising the familiar fate of one who has gone on a
new journey only to arrive at a familiar destination.
''Which is really just what that dead chap said. About the medium and
the message. Ah dear, there's nothing new under the sun.''
* Ivor Cutler can be heard under canvas at the Glasgow's Fair's Moulin
Rouge Tent, 2pm on Sunday.

KIM Fowley has made many claims about his place in the history of rock
'n' roll, and has as many claims to fame. The difficulty is that the two
lists are almost, but not quite, entirely dissimilar.
The enigma that is Kim Fowley is easily explained by an encounter with
the man himself. The stream of utter nonsense that comes out of his
mouth (he is, he will insist, 125-years-old, and has been dead for 13
years) might be highly entertaining, but cannot really compete with a CV
that includes, among other things, work with Bob Dylan, Jim Morrison,
Alice Cooper, and Leonard Cohen, production for Gene Vincent, Them, The
Byrds, and Slade, and being the svengali behind Venus and The
Razorblades, and The Runaways.
My own personal favourite Fowley claim is that he invented the silly
business of holding lighters aloft at rock gigs while performing with
John Lennon and Plastic Ono Band in Toronto. The man's either a genius
or mad.
You can judge for yourself when he appears at Glasgow's 13th Note
tonight in the company of the BMX Bandits. The collaboration follows the
group's backing of songwriter Dan Penn at the same venue last year, but
this time around Fowley insists there will be no songs for them to
learn.
''This will be a three-hour show with no intermission, and the
audience picks the songs. It's a gestalt confrontation. We may ask women
to show off their clothes and their bodies. We may ask for guys who want
to sing.
''There are no covers, no songs ever performed before, and after
Thursday they will never be heard again. Any idiot can sing on stage.
Only a genius can create true performance art. This is improvisation.
This is reality rock.''
All of this is delivered in one unpunctuated flow. Could it be he has
said this before? Fowley says his own agenda is to find a Scottish wife.
His mother, actress Shelby Payne (who features in the classic The Big
Sleep), was half Scottish. His father, actor Douglas Fowley (the film
director in Singing In The Rain), was Irish. But can the females of
Glasgow resist this invitation?
''I get bored with music, but I never get bored with women. I want to
grunt like a love-ape in the jungle of your reality. Forget Tom Cruise.
This is your chance to get revenge on your family and ex-boyfriends and
outrage everyone. Besides, I'm probably the richest person you'll ever
meet. I'm a modern Rob Roy guy.''
* Kim Fowley and The BMX Bandits are at Glasgow's 13th Note, Glassford
Street, tonight, 8pm.

HE WAS only four, so he got his six-year-old friend to stand with him
in the phone box, dial the number, and tell the voice at the other end
that he didn't like the ''games'' his daddy was playing with him.
That little boy was one of 70,000 children who have been counselled by
the ChildLine charity in Scotland since its inception five years ago --
70,000 stories of sexual and physical abuse, bullying, pregnancy,
isolation, and broken or breaking homes.
Most of the youngsters who call are between 11 and 15. The
four-year-old was the youngest, and they are still calling the service
into their late teens. Girls outnumber boys by about four to one. There
are between 400 and 600 calls in any given day; a few hoaxes, some
silent, others tentative, and many harrowing.
Physical abuse accounts for 14% of the calls, the biggest proportion.
Bullying comes next with 13%, then 12% for what ChildLine calls
''third-party concern'', where children are calling because they are
worried about other youngsters or on behalf of others. Sexual abuse
accounts for 11%, family problems for 9%, pregnancy worries for 8%, and
questions about sexuality for 8%.
For ChildLine Scotland director Anne Houston the calls have drawn up a
picture not only of distressing abuse but also of the resilience and
maturity of many young children. ''Have I been surprised? Well,
personally, maybe by the level of thoughtfulness and insight of some of
the younger children. I am more surprised at what adults are prepared to
do to children, and I suppose the day I stop being surprised about that
is the day I should stop doing the job.''
In the case of the four-year-old who had the know-how to call, the
counsellor was able to discover that the mother was aware of the abuse
and had been trying to stop it.
That's where the work must prove frustrating for the service's 140
full-time counsellors -- they must respect the child's confidentiality,
and can only act if the child gives them the go-ahead.
''I say to prospective volunteers, if you are the kind of person who
reads the last page of a novel first then it's probably not for you,
because in this job there are lots of beginnings, quite a lot of
middles, and a few ends,'' says Houston.
The charity, which will be visited by the founder, Esther Rantzen,
next week, is looking out for volunteer counsellors to train. No special
skills are required.

number is 0800 1111.

Toys and villains for Batman, an overweight d'Artaganan and his
daughter attempt to save the king, and a psychiatrist tries to
understand far-from-monogomous family members. William Russell sees it
all
THE summer of cinema super heroes has arrived, and a battle royal will
be waged during the coming weeks to see which one will be the box office
winner. First in to bat, so to speak, is the Caped Crusader himself in
Batman Forever, the third instalment of his adventures. Judge Dredd,
Power Rangers, Caspar the Friendly Ghost and William Wallace are yet to
come.
The new Batman is, I fear, proof that you can fool some of the people
all of the time. Warner Brothers' advertising budget has been colossal,
and the expenditure has paid off by creating a critic-proof film. The
advance publicity having created a must-see mood, and in its first two
weeks in the United States the film grossed some $135m, $52m of it in a
record first weekend, while the associated merchandise is selling like
crazy.
The first film, Batman, released in 1989, directed by Tim Burton and
starring Michael Keaton, was also backed by an effective publicity
blitz, although it was also helped by a barnstorming comic performance
from Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Nicholson's bravura display concealed
the fact that Burton, (Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood), a highly
idiosyncratic film-maker with an original vision, had made a dark,
sinister, brilliantly designed film which caught the spirit of the
original comics perfectly. His Gotham City was a triumph.
Three years later in Batman Returns, also directed by Burton, there
was even more darkness, but the villain, Danny De Vito as the Penguin,
did not provide the same comic relief as Nicholson, although Michelle
Pfeiffer as Catwoman was a memorably sexy villainess in her black
plastic catsuit. The film did well at the box office, but the tone was
too bleak for the American public's taste. A new approach was required.
Now there is a new director, Joel Schumacher, whose track record is
more populist than Burton's, a new Batman, Val Kilmer, and Gotham City
is no longer a place of dark and sinister shadows but one for lavish
special effects. Robin, missing from the previous films because nobody
could get round the Batman and Robin problem, appears in the person of
ultra-butch teen-dream, Chris O'Donnell, while the Batman gear has been
expanded to allow for more lucrative toys for little boys.
Nicole Kidman, cast against type, does her best to be sexy as a
vamp-cum-psychiatrist interested in split personality, while O'Donnell
stresses Robin's street cred for all it is worth. Tommy Lee Jones as Two
Face proves a surprisingly unmenacing villain, while Jim Carrey, star of
The Mask and Dumb and Dumber, as the Riddler simply concentrates on
going through comic routines of proven appeal. He is, however, the best
thing in a film which has a lot of incident, but little plot.
Warner Brothers let critics see it at a public preview, the reasoning
being that critics in isolation fail to appreciate films like this. It
is the custom of preview audiences to applaud at the end. I can only
report that Monday's preview audience was lukewarm, the applause thin
and brief. My sentiments entirely.
After the mess made of the Camelot legend in First Knight, a warm
welcome for the witty and successful approach adopted by Bertrand
Tavernier to bringing another literary legend -- d'Artagnan -- to the
screen.
In d'Artaganan's Daughter, Sophie Marceau plays the daughter, Eloise,
who dons boy's attire after the nunnery where she is being educated is
pillaged by an evil duke (Claude Rich) and his unscrupulous mistress,
the Lady in Red, (Charlotte Kady). The abbess is fatally wounded, and
Eloise, pausing only to collect a bloodstained sheet of paper --
actually a laundry list -- which she assumes was the cause of the
killing, sets off for Paris dressed as a boy to seek her father's help.
The joke is that nobody is fooled by the disguise since Miss Marceau
bulges in all the wrong places. On the way she collects a young poet,
Nils Tavernier, who falls in love with her and promptly pens an ode. As
a result she has two pieces of paper in her possession which everybody
assumes are coded details of a plot against the boy king, Louis XIV.
This thoroughly beguiling costume comedy packed with witty lines and
performances is too long, and the plot is just too complicated for its
own good.
But the shortcomings are by the way. Philippe Noiret's arthritic,
overweight, over the hill d'Artagnan, is very funny indeed. When he
gathers the three musketeers -- Sami Frey is particularly delightful as
Aramis, a most worldly bishop -- to help his daughter save the king, the
adventure takes wing.
The best comic turn is provided by Luigi Proietti as Mazarin, a
consummate schemer forever checking up on how secret his secrets are,
who has so many that he is never sure what is a secret, what is public
knowledge. A little knowledge of French history is a help, although it
requires only a little knowledge to relish the scene in which Mazarin
advises the bumptious young Louis XIV on how to be a king.
''Do not invent a style, Louis Treize will do, have a home outside
Paris so the people must come to you -- Versailles will do nicely -- and
do not get involved with women,'' he intones, before sweeping out of the
room. Then he pauses, and mutters in disgust that he has forgotten to
say -- ''and do not revoke the Edict of Nantes'' -- shrugs, and carries
on. Is the joke funny? Go and look it up. It is.
Written and directed by David Frankel, Miami Rhapsody is about the
loves of a Miami family recounted to a psychiatrist by the admirable
Sarah Jessica Parker. Mother, Mia Farrow, is having an affair with
Antonio Banderas, who is nursing Grandma Lil, who has had a stroke.
Father, Paul Mazursky, is having a fling with his travel agent while
newly married Sister, Carla Gugino, having found out her brand new
footballer hunk husband, Bo Eason, is a miser, is having an affair with
an old schoolfriend. Brother, Kevin Pollack, is cheating on his pregnant
wife, Barbara Garrick, with Naomi Campbell; and Sarah Jessica is dubious
about her fiance, Gil Bellows, she meets Antonio and the fat is in the
fire.
The one-liners are crisp, the playing polished. Miss Parker tells the
tale with great style. Naomi Campbell, however, should stick to the day
job -- or novel writing.

<HEADLINE>Scottish drama is 'powerhouse of the network'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977420465</RECORDNO>

BBC SCOTLAND is a ''powerhouse'' in its development of new drama for
the network, the corporation's head of drama, Mr Charles Denton, said
yesterday.
Launching the Scottish contribution to the new season of drama on the
network, he claimed there had been a resurgence in drama from the BBC
over recent years which was a product of independence from the
imperatives of advertisers and the ratings war.
''We have an obligation -- I will put it as strongly as that -- to
work across the range of drama and regularly take risks,'' he said.
The fact that a proportion of these risks had also proved popular with
the critics and the public was a source of more pride within BBC
Scotland itself.
Head of drama Ms Andrea Calderwood noted the continuing success of
Cardiac Arrest, which shoots a new series in Glasgow from August, the
two Baftas won by Takin' Over The Asylum, and the 10m viewers who tuned
in to Hamish Macbeth.
Ms Calderwood announced #12m worth of new commissions for BBC1 and
BBC2, to be broadcast from the autumn. They include a four-part series
for BBC1 by the same team responsible for Taking Over The Asylum --
writer Donna Franceschild and director David Blair. A Mug's Game stars
Ken Stott and is set on a West Coast of Scotland fish farm. It will be
screened next year.
The writer of stage hit Dumbstruck!, David Kane, has written and
directed Ruffian Hearts, a romance of the various inhabitants of a
Glasgow close, which will premiere at Edinburgh Film Festival before
being screened on BBC2.
Following the same route is Nightlife, a thriller shot in Kelvingrove
Park, Glasgow, and written by David Grieg, a young writer whose stage
work has also been highly praised. It is directed by Patrick Harkins, a
graduate of the Tartan Shorts scheme, and stars two actresses from
director Mike Leigh's films, Katrin Cartlidge and Jane Horrocks.
There is a third film festival with Small Faces, originally titled
Easterhouse. Directed by Gillies MacKinnon, it is BBC Scotland's first
feature Film and is part funded by Glasgow Film Fund.
Filming begins soon on Nervous Energy, a drama by Howard Schuman about
a young Glaswegian, living in London, who discovers he has Aids. The
part is played by Citizens' Theatre stalwart Cal Macaninch.
Any controversy it excites is likely to be outdone by Flowers of the
Forest, Michael Eaton's story of suspected satanic child abuse in a
Highland community. It will be filmed on location in Scotland in the
autumn.
Meanwhile, independent producers of Gaelic TV programmes yesterday hit
out for not getting as large a slice of the action as their colleagues
in mainstream programming.
Comunn Riochdairean Telebhisean Gaidhlig (CRTG), the association of
several small independents in the Gaelic sector, said it was ''a matter
of concern'' to them that 25% of the #8.9m Gaelic TV Fund was not spent
on commissioning independents.
It is national policy for broadcasters, including the BBC, to aim at a
25% independent sector input.
However, the failure of the Gaelic independents to secure 25% of the
Government funds, and the fact they are not expected to reach that
amount in the next three years, raised serious questions about where
control of the fund lies, said CRTG.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
BOSNIAN Serb forces sent trucks into the captured enclave of
Srebrenica on Wednesday and started forcefully taking tens of thousands
of Muslim refugees out of the UN ''safe area'' conquered on Tuesday.
Their action is seen as bringing the United States one step closer to
what it has long sought to avoid -- direct involvement in the war in
former Yugoslavia.
UN officials said refugees were being vetted to weed out alleged ''war
criminals'' and the rest were being driven to front lines with
government troops and left there, expected to walk several miles across
no-man's land.
Mr Harald Kjerstad, the UN spokesman in Tuzla, said: ''This is
deplorable. We are talking about people who are badly in the need of
medicine and food. They had nothing to eat for 24 and more hours.''
The Bosnian Serb commander, General Ratko Mladic, arrived in the
village of Potocari in the Srebrenica enclave with 40 trucks and
demanded that the refugees board them, UN officials said.
''We were told he is not taking no for an answer,'' UN spokesman
Alexander Ivanko said in Sarajevo.
Relief workers said 20,000 to 30,000 Muslim refugees were gathering
around Potocari, the main base for 400 Dutch UN soldiers who had tried
to protect the UN safe area.
The Dutch troops handed out some of their food to refugees but say
their stocks will not last 24 hours.
Mladic also demanded that local Bosnian army troops be disarmed within
24 hours but most of the enclave's defenders seemed to have fled to hide
in the hills, UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Coward said.
Coward described the refugees as in ''very, very poor shape -- hungry,
dirty, and in poor condition.''
A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees convoy of six trucks
loaded up with 22 tonnes of food and supplies outside Belgrade. It plans
to head to Potocari overnight or early today.
The immediate worry of both the United Nations and of aid agencies was
that the refugees would be split up or that international observers
would be unable to monitor the movement of refugees in Bosnian Serb
hands.
''We have been able to negotiate to have at least one Dutch UN soldier
on every truck to try to monitor for any human rights abuses,'' said
Ivanko.
Mr Stephen Oberreit, of the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres,
told Reuters in Belgrade his staff on the scene believed the Muslim
refugees were going to be herded into a football stadium in Bratunac.
However, it was not immediately clear whether this involved all the
refugees or just those men of military age.
''What we must insist upon is that we deal with the whole population
and that an international presence carries on staying with this
population and that humanitarian access is allowed to this population,''
Oberreit said.
Bosnian Serb authorities said they were sending their own supplies to
help the refugee exodus.
The fall of Srebrenica and the growing fears that UN peacekeeping
forces will now withdraw from Bosnia, as some contributing nations are
warning, look likely to increase the US stake in the war. The US has
promised to send up to 25,000 troops to help evacuate the Muslim
refugees.
If Congress, incensed by the Srebrenica debacle, unilaterally lifts
the UN arms embargo on the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, US officials
say Washington would then feel morally obliged to arm and train the
Muslims.
A senior US official said the fall of Srebrenica makes it a top
administration priority to head off a vote to lift the embargo.
For these reasons, the administration is likely to seek to preserve
what is left of the status quo in Bosnia, with its number one priority
being to keep the UN Protection Force in place, US analysts said.
''If the UN withdraws, the United States becomes deeply involved in
Yugoslavia and they will fight as hard as they can to prevent that,''
said Patrick Glynn of the American Enterprise Institute. ''It's a
tougher argument now but they may be able to hold the line.''
Within hours of the fall of Srebrenica on Tuesday, Secretary of State
Warren Christopher was arguing that UN Protection Force still had work
to do in Bosnia despite its failure to defend a so-called UN safe area.
Since the Yugoslav crisis exploded four years ago, Washington
officials' main policy goals have been largely negative ones: to avoid
sending US ground troops to the conflict area and to avoid a major rift
with the Nato allies. They are struggling to hold the line on both.
The capture of the Srebrenica ''safe area'' despite a last-minute
defence by Nato planes and vastly outnumbered Dutch soldiers, wrecked
any respect the Muslim-led government had left for UN authority.
''The hypocrisy and inhumanity of the international community peaked
today in Srebrenica,'' Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told the Bosnian
news agency.

Sarajevo,
THE first group of Muslim refugees from the ''safe area'' of
Srebrenica, conquered by Serb forces, walked across no-man's land to the
safety of government-held Bosnia yesterday.
First pictures of the 1000 or so women and children bussed out of
Srebrenica by the Bosnian Serbs and left to cross the front lines showed
women in headscarves carrying babies in their arms or leading children
down a road to government posts.
A UN source said it seemed the refugees had to walk up to six miles
from where they were dropped off near Kladanj, about 30 miles west of
Srebrenica.
At Potocari, the over-crowded UN post just outside Srebrenica, where
up to 30,000 townspeople gathered in and around the Dutch peacekeepers'
compound, aid agencies reported harrowing scenes as Bosnian Serbs
divided families.
Young men of military age were vetted as possible ''war criminals''
while groups of women and children were bussed out.
''There was a horrible scene of screaming,'' Stephan Oberreit of the
medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres told Reuters in Belgrade.
''Women and children were put aside to be loaded on to buses while
young men were put in other places. Obviously this loading of buses was
terrifying. People were screaming. People were panicking,'' Oberreit
said after speaking to MSF staff there.
The UN said it had negotiated to have a Dutch peacekeeper on each bus
to monitor the splitting up of refugee groups.
Bosnian Serb-controlled television showed scenes of thousands of
refugees packed around the Dutch UN camp near Srebrenica, and women and
children being ushered on to buses.
People looked frightened but in the brief footage there were no signs
of panic.
Serb commander General Ratko Mladic sought to calm them, saying to the
crowd: ''You don't have to be afraid of anything. Slowly. Please let the
women and children in front of you. . . No panic please. . . Don't be
afraid. No one will harm you.''
Mladic said Srebrenica was firmly under Bosnian Serb control though
pockets of resistance remained.
He called on remaining Bosnian government soldiers to lay down their
weapons and join the evacuation to Kladanj, on the rim of
government-held territory.
UN envoy Yasushi Akashi vowed that UN troops would not help to
''cleanse ethnically'' Srebrenica. But a UN official said Mladic was
''not taking no for an answer''.
''This is deplorable. We are talking about people who are badly in
need of medicine and food. They had nothing to eat for 24 and more
hours,'' said Harald Kjerstad, the UN spokesman in Bosnian
government-held Tuzla to the north-west.
Later yesterday a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees convoy
of six trucks carrying 22 tonnes of food and bedding left Belgrade
heading for Potocari.
UN spokesman Gary Coward described the refugees as in ''very, very
poor shape -- hungry, dirty and in poor condition''.
The action by the Serbs is seen as bringing the United States one step
closer to what it has long sought to avoid -- direct involvement in the
war in former Yugoslavia.

Music
YOU can't teach an old Black Dog new tricks. The Led Zep front line's
adoption of pagan and ethnic culture might be diverting on record, but
live? The version of No Quarter -- done here as a duo on folkie stools
with a 12-string acoustic guitar sounding as little like a 12-string
acoustic guitar as is imaginable -- was just nonsense.
The accompanying videos of eagles, runic stones, and unspoiled
wilderness did not help.
''We come to you in the spirit of the Pictish bards,'' said Robert,
explaining that the introductory poetry had been the work of The
Incredible String Band's Robin Williamson. Not that the Pictish bards
would have recognised the best of what was on offer here.
Instead, come to us in the spirit of rock 'n' roll. Like that early
medley of Candy Store Rock and Ramble On (during which it became clear
that Page was happy to delegate lead guitar duties to Walthamstowe's
Paul Thomson). Or even Since I've Been Loving You, despite the barely
audible 18-piece string section.
And that was a pretty snappy The Song Remains The Same. Even the last
three minutes of an epic Whole Lotta Love, which included snatches of
Dazed and Confused and The Doors' Break On Through, was along the right
general lines.
In isolation Nigel's hurdy-gurdy and the eight-piece North African (by
way of Islington) ensemble The Egyptian Pharoahs were fine, even if the
geographical link with Kashmir is a bit suspect. But over 30 people on
stage? Give me Black Dog ringing in my ears every time.

HOLIDAYMAKERS are risking their lives swimming in dangerous hotel
pools in Majorca and on the Algarve, the Consumers' Association claims
today.
Nearly 73% -- 43 out of 59 -- of hotel and apartment pools inspected
were rated poor or dangerous, despite promises that they would be
improved after earlier bad reports.
Conditions at one pool previously rated poor had worsened, the CA's
Holiday Which? magazine added. Many of the hotels are used by top
holiday companies, including Airtours, First Choice, and Cosmos.
In the investigation earlier this year, just four pools out of 60 were
pronounced safe. All but one of the 60 were re-inspected in May and this
time 16 out of 59 were rated safe.
However, Holiday Which? said eight hotel pools in Majorca were still
rated dangerous and 16 as poor. Two were satisfactory, three very good,
and one outstanding. In the Algarve, two were dangerous, 17 poor, one
satisfactory, eight very good, and one outstanding.
The magazine found:
* Poor depth markings -- 11 pools in Majorca and six in the Algarve
had faint, insufficient or inaccurate markings
* Sudden depth changes -- 12 out of 29 in the Algarve and 14 in
Majorca had sudden drops
* ''No diving'' notices -- In Majorca, only 13 out of 30 pools had
adequate ''no diving'' signs, while in the Algarve the figure was 19 out
of 29
* Children's pools -- 13 of the Majorcan pools gave inspectors cause
for concern, with problems such as location near deep water. In the
Algarve, only two pools did not achieve a rating of adequate.
Holiday Which? editor Patricia Yates said: ''Many tour operators are
ignoring the problems and putting holidaymakers at risk.''

HOW do you make a Film Festival different? Edinburgh, under new
management this year, announces its plans today. There are arguably too
many film festivals around -- every regional film theatre in England
seems to put one on, which for a cinema's local audience is fine. But a
festival worth its salt should be an event which brings people in from
outside.
Edinburgh in its post-war heyday did just that. It was the first
British showcase for foreign films, a launchpad for directors who became
household names. The task of the new director, Mark Cousins, to restore
that pre-eminence with his first attempt begins on August 13.
Galway, a bit like Edinburgh, is a city with a vibrant cultural life,
and it also has a film festival, the Fleadh. The problem about Galway is
one has to make an effort to get there -- it is on the way to nowhere,
except some rather fine scenery. Is it worth it?
The Fleadh, which runs from July 16-23, has faced up to the need to be
more than just a few days showing forthcoming releases a few weeks in
advance. It has a style all its own.
This year, as well as the premiere of All Our Fault, the new film from
the Irish director, Thaddeus O'Sullivan, set in Ulster in 1975, which
stars Ian Hart, possibly Britain's busiest young actor (he is currently
working on Michael Collins in Dublin and is the lead in Ken Loach's
Spanish civil war drama, Land and Freedom, the opening film at
Edinburgh), it has as taken the thriller for its theme.
That has resulted in a multi-faceted retrospective of films like Bad
Day at Black Rock, Assault on Precinct 13, Blood Simple and The Spy Who
Came in From the Cold. Complementing that, the director has chosen a
retrospective in Arthur Penn -- Bonnie and Clyde, Alice's Restaurant and
Night Moves.
There are a number of Irish premieres -- Mikhalkov's Chekhovian
drama set at the height of Stalin's reign of terror, Burnt by the Sun,
which won the the best foreign film Oscar; Roman Polanski's Death and
the Maiden; and Michael Winterbottom's story of a passionate and
dangerous friendship between two women, Butterfly Kiss.
There are also several Sundance 1994 prize winners including
David Russell's black comedy, Spanking the Monkey, which won the
audience award, and Rafal Zielinski's Fun, currently being shown in
Scotland.
It is an interesting mix of films old and new and, on paper,
everything a film festival ought to be -- there is a strong Irish-made
element, new foreign films, a good retrospective strand.

Kirsty Scott considers the safety of aid workers while they offer
support to the embattled public.
AIDA Halilajic is tired of the nightly news; talking heads,
pontification, and all the questions. Should we stay? Should we go? Can
we help? All she knows is that she might feel a little better about her
family's chances in Bihac if UN troops remain in Bosnia. A little, but
not too much.
Aida, 24, fled Bihac two years ago, and currently works with the
Edinburgh charity Bosnia Now. Her first reaction yesterday after the
fall of Srebrenica was that the UN's impotence had now been clearly
exposed for all the world to see; the admission by Boutros Boutros Ghali
that the other safe areas were anything but, just a clumsy statement of
the glaringly obvious.
''It is really difficult to think about it. I come from the area in
Bosnia where the UN has not been for more than a year and they are
surviving there without their help. When you see what happened in
Srebrenica and look at Bihac which is also a safe area, it is not very
safe at all.''
But she admits to being afraid of what might happen if the UN did
withdraw. ''It's a really difficult situation. If they stayed I think we
would all feel more secure. I watched the television the other night and
the UN spokesman said that air strikes can't do much good without forces
on the ground. If the UN is to stay, there should be forces on the
ground, but they have already been there for four and a half years and
they have not done very much at all.''
That's a refrain picked up by Anne-Marie Huby of the aid agency
Medecins Sans Frontieres which has been labouring in Srebrenica,
Sarajevo, Gorazde and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. It was MSF
staff who broke the news of Srebrenica's fall yesterday.
''I would love to say what the UN is doing is marvellous and yes they
should stay, but as far as we are concerned the endeavour . . . has been
very much a fig leaf to say to the public look we are doing something.''
Huby believes aid agencies could continue their work without a UN
presence and says many are doing just that. She would rather see the
forces stay, but only if given the muscle and the mandate to contain the
Serbs.
''Yes they should stay, but they should stay to stop the attack or to
fight back. We are an aid agency and we don't like to see blood spilt
but you don't stop genocide with an aspirin, you stand up and be
counted.
''Is it going to be far worse without the UN? It is very difficult to
say. The deal will change fundamentally without them, and there is a
real threat that the conflict will widen if the Bosnian/Croatian
alliance have to find another sponsor.''
Bernie O'Donnell, however, has no doubts that the UN has been, and
should continue to be, a viable force in the former Yugoslavia as an aid
provider.
O'Donnell, a volunteer with Edinburgh Direct Aid, said the angst over
whether the UN should withdraw or not comes from a basic
misunderstanding about its original role.
''The UN has really been doing a very good job for the past couple of
years . . . they have helped us a great deal finding schools and
hospitals and giving us armed escorts to get to these places. Plus they
make an effort themselves to find places that need aid, they are very
positive and they do make an active contribution. I really have nothing
but admiration for them.
''They are doing what we told them to do. Suddenly people are moaning
that they are not fighting a war, but we never asked them to do that.''
She has little time for the ''get out and leave them to it'' brigade.
''On the news this morning they talked about the war in Bosnia, but
only one side is armed, so it's not a war, it is a one-sided offensive
and when people say leave them to fight it out among themselves I get
really annoyed.
''I'm thinking of Sarajevo, of my friends in Kosovo, there are
thousands of aid workers who are doing amazing jobs. Do I think they
could still do the work if the UN was not there? Not in some of the more
difficult areas, no.''
At the UN headquarters in New York a spokesman for the peacekeeping
force said no decision had been taken to withdraw, and the UN's role was
to protect the population and the safe areas ''to the extent possible''.
''There is only so much you can do with a small force,'' he said. ''As
long as both parties co-operate with the UN, then the UN can function
effectively. When one party discards their agreement, there is only so
much you can do.''
Few others can offer such basic responses to the worsening tragedy.
''To decide what is morally right requires you to reflect on the
situation and to consider the consequences of your actions,'' said
Richard Stalley, an expert in morality and ethics at Glasgow University.
''If the effects of the UN staying are clearly going to be worse than
the effects of leaving then that should be borne in mind in arriving at
a moral decision . . . personally, I would like to see them staying with
the force to be effective.''
For the Rt Rev. Michael Hare Duke, former Bishop of St Andrews, years
of agonised debate and thought have not produced a clear solution to the
dilemma.
''It is one of these nightmare things where nobody can see one right
way, but you can't just walk away can you? I think to have gone in then
pull out, it really feels like a terrible betrayal, because you are
actually then just leaving people to their fate.''

SCOTLAND leads the UK league tables in two separate surveys of the
retail sector. Research into retail-investment performance by the
Investment Property Databank (IPD) reveals that five of the top
performing UK retail locations are in Scotland, with St Andrews and
Inverness occupying the top two places in the UK in terms of investment
performance.
IPD's town league table compares the viability of 243 towns throughout
the UK for the period 1991-94. Richard Kwiecinski, chairman DTZ Debenham
Thorpe (Scotland), said: ''These results do not surprise me as our
clients have been actively seeking investments in most of the 15
Scottish towns analysed for the survey, and I expect that they shall
continue to do so.
''What the survey does prove is that investors have found the Scottish
retail market an attractive proposition in terms of both resilience and
stability.''
St Andrews is the UK's top performing retail market with an increase
in total returns of 22% per annum over the 1991-94 period. This
contrasts with an average rate of growth only 9.5% per annum across the
UK.
Of the 15 Scottish towns monitored, some 13 (86%) recorded growth
rates in total returns in excess of the national average. Apart from St
Andrews and Inverness, the other top Scottish performers were Aberdeen
(7th best in UK), Kirkcaldy (12th), and Edinburgh (14th).
Other performances included Glasgow's 42nd position. Kirkintilloch was
the lowest Scottish performer, finishing 153rd out of the 243 towns
surveyed.
Mr Kwiecinski said: ''In the late 1980's Scotland as a whole did not
experience the extreme rental growth rates experienced in England. As a
result of this, recent rental growth has been impressive.''
Overall the Scottish retail market has seen healthy levels of
investment.
A recent survey of the index of retail trading locations by DTZ
Debenham Thorpe/PMA showed that Glasgow and Edinburgh are viewed by
retailers as being amongst the most successful locations in terms of
turnover.
Mr Kwiecinski said: ''Strong rental growth is set to continue in prime
locations as a group of multiple retailers are actively competing for a
limited number of good opportunities.''
In a separate survey of rental performance throughout the UK over the
year to May 1995, Scotland's prime shop rentals went up by an average of
5.2%. This figure is four times the average rate of growth for other
regions, according to this year's Town Centre Retail Rental Performance
produced by Colliers Erdman Lewis Research &amp; Consultancy.
Overall, average prime rents have not performed as well as expected,
with 77% of centres on the database showing no change in prime rents and
only 17% experiencing an increase.
Dr Richard Doidge, head of retail research and consultancy at Colliers
Erdman Lewis, said: ''Long-term rental performance has been sluggish and
we estimate that the 1995 average GB rental is now little higher that
that of 20 years ago in real terms.''
Head of retail at Colliers Erdman Lewis, Keith Mabbett said: ''The
bottom line is that some regions, such as the South-East, have been slow
to recover from the recession and this is reflected in the rental
performance across the country.''

A SENIOR academic asserted yesterday that while higher education
provides a major contribution to the Scottish economy, universities were
pleased to provide the golden egg -- but uncertain about being the
goose.
The analogy was made by Professor Robin Knops, Vice-Principal of
Heriot-Watt University at a graduation ceremony in Edinburgh, where
students from the Faculty of Science were presented for degrees, along
with those from the University's Faculty of Art and Design at Edinburgh
College of Art.
Following a previous theme on cost-cutting and difficulties facing
students, he said: ''In 1993/94, Scottish higher education generated an
estimated #2.47 billion and created jobs equivalent to 4% of the
Scottish workforce.
''It must therefore be reckoned a powerful economic factor, but
although we are pleased with the golden egg part, we are not quite so
certain about being the goose.''
Outlining the universities' successes, he maintained that they had
been achieved against rising student numbers and punitive costs.
''The student's financial situation grows ever harder. It is no wonder
they feel they have been left hanging in the air with no visible means
of support,'' he said.
Professor Knops insisted that there was immense financial uncertainty
ahead for the system of education in Scotland, and questioned whether
the Funding Council would be able to maintain its stance.
Nevertheless, he said,it was essential to retain a highly competitive
quality educational and research service.

Ian Bruce, Defence Correspondent, argues that the UN is crippled by
indecision
AFEW hundred Serb footsloggers advancing into the ruins of Srebrenica
on Tuesday night effectively destroyed United Nations' credibility in
Bosnia, and brought 38-months of diplomatic wrangling and humanitarian
struggle to an inglorious finale.
Shrugging off a symbolic Nato airstrike which knocked out two tanks
but allowed Ratko Mladic's infantry to continue a relentless drive on
the besieged Muslim enclave, the Serbs showed the world that they are
masters of a game the UN is neither qualified nor equipped to play.
Five other ''safe havens'' bulging with refugees now await their fate
with justified fear. They have watched Dutch UN troops being overrun,
captured, or put to flight. The thin, blue line has been breached, and
it is unlikely ever to be reformed.
If the UN's writ does not run to protecting its own men, then how can
it be expected to protect helpless refugees? The Security Council's
options have now become distinctly limited. It either accepts
involvement in punitive offensive action, or it pulls out completely.
There are no longer any viable half measures. Serb tanks and troops
are poised to storm into Zepa, a battered ''safe haven'' south-west of
Srebrenica whose population has swollen from 4500 to more than 30,000 as
Muslims flee before their ethnic foes.
A handful of Ukrainian ''Blue Helmets'' are all that stand between
them and a repeat performance by the triumphant inheritors of
Yugoslavia's savage Chetnik tradition. UN response has been to condemn
and bluster. But resolutions do not deter tank assaults. That takes
firepower and political determination.
More than 23,000 UN peacekeepers have now assumed the role of
potential hostages or victims. At best, they can beat an ignominious
retreat. At worst, they will become targets for the frustration of all
sides in this many-sided conflict.
More than 700,000 Muslims and Croats under UN ''protection'' in
Gorazde, Bihac, Tuzla, Zepa, and Sarajevo are staring humanitarian
disaster in the face. The Serbs control most of the roads. Aid convoys
are not getting through, and food and medical supplies are running low
everywhere.
Even the peacekeepers, trapped with their wards, are going hungry. The
UN lacks the willpower to force a passage at gunpoint, and diplomacy is
a waste of effort when faced with Balkan duplicity.
The Serbs know that Nato lacks the stomach for a fight, and that the
UN will prevaricate endlessly rather than cross the line from
peacekeeping to peacemaking. A show of real force would be tantamount to
a declaration of war.
Nato has dusted off evacuation plans to cover the withdrawal of the
various national contingents. But it, too, is powerless to act without a
direct mandate from the Security Council. The airstrikes launched so far
as warning shots against aggression have been laughably ineffective.
During the attack on Srebrenica, US and Dutch attack aircraft were
given permission to ''take out'' a limited number of armoured vehicles.
The rules of engagement, however, strictly forbade strikes on the
advancing Serb infantry accompanying the tanks.
As soon as the Serbs realised this, they pulled back their armoured
columns and pushed on at bayonet point, secure in the knowledge that
their men were safe from all but sporadic defensive fire by Muslim
troops or the 30-strong UN platoon dug in as a token tripwire outside
the town.
President Jacques Chirac of France yesterday demanded the immediate
deployment of the 10,000-man Anglo-French-Dutch Rapid Reaction Force to
retake Srebrenica. But the move was opposed by the UK, which has only
1100 of its promised 6500 combat troops for the force in position.
The bulk of 24 Airmobile Brigade still languishes in bases in England,
all packed up with nowhere to go. The Croats have refused these troops
entry to their country as a jumping-off base until a per capita entry
fee is paid.
In any case, the UN will not take the hard decision to launch
offensive action. The Rapid Reaction Force, which is neither rapid nor
reactive in a crisis, is destined to become a latter-day Grand Old Duke
of York's army. Its first and perhaps final role may well be to help
cover UN withdrawal.
The bottom line is that the UN contingents in Bosnia are not
configured or equipped for war. They lack tanks, artillery, mortars, and
front-line soldiers. A high proportion of those in-country are
logisticians, parade-ground commandos, or administrators.
Britain, France, and Spain are the only countries with highly-trained
fighting troops in theatre. The bulk of the others should not be
committed to battle. They were sent by their respective countries as a
symbolic gesture of support for the UN mission. They were not sent to
fight and die for a cause which is already lost.
A Nato staff study carried out last year estimated that it would take
a force of 150,000 soldiers backed with a full range of weaponry to
impose peace on Bosnia. The study also concluded that the combat
experience and improved training of the belligerents meant that
casualties among such a force would inevitably be heavy.
Every nation but France has already grasped that point. And even the
French are now rattling sabres very loudly in the sound knowledge that
there will be no takers for military adventurism.
The refusal of their allies will, however, give the French the perfect
excuse to remove their own substantial forces from Bosnia with honour
intact. The French were willing, but were let down by everyone else.
Blame it all on American intransigence.
All Western governments are now hard up against tough decisions on
Bosnia. Time is not on their side, and the UN's indecisive handling of
the situation may mean that several of the nations contributing manpower
to the mission will have to take unilateral action to ensure the safety
of their contingents.
Winter sets in from October onwards in the mountains of central
Bosnia. Any large-scale withdrawal must take place before then, or the
scattered garrisons will be more or less trapped until next spring.
There are only two main roads suitable for military traffic leading back
to the Croatian coast and evacuation by sea.
The UN must now grasp the nettle. If it cannot supply and protect the
hundreds of thousands of refugees displaced by war, then placing its
multi-national soldiers in the line of fire with inadequate means of
self-defence becomes a useless waste of lives. A total of 67 ''Blue
Helmets'' have already died in the conflict.
International recognition that the mission has failed is a vital and
pressing prerequisite, followed by an orderly but rapid pull-back of
detachments and vehicles isolated across the country. The ignominy of
retreat will be bad enough, but nothing of value should be left for the
Serbs or others to help them prosecute war.
The unpalatable truth is that the Bosnian Muslims and Croats will
continue to try to recover lost territory, and to lift the siege of
Sarajevo. The Serbs have their own agenda in holding on to strategic
road and river lines, and ethnic cleansing on a grand scale.
The UN is powerless to stop any of it, unless it authorises
unremitting air strikes and reinforcement and repositioning of its
ground units into defensible perimeters.
Only the total destruction of the attacking force which overran
Srebrenica two days ago would have given the Serbs pause for reflection.
Losing a safe haven with a mere token gesture of force was the final
nail in the coffin of UN policy.
Refugees are being starved, shelled, and driven from their homes
despite the international presence. The integrity and viability of the
UN mission has been shattered. It is time to leave, ring-fence the war
zone, and let the protagonists fight it out.

IN Glasgow's biggest office deal for two years, Standard Life has
bought Pacific House, 70 Wellington Street, for #9m. The deal represents
a net yield of 7.25%.
The building is multi-let and its tenants include Richard Ellis,
Lloyds Bowmaker, Greig Middleton and McGrigor Donald. The current rent
passing is #670,000 per annum.
Standard Life has been actively looking for quality provincial office
investments in the main UK centres for some time.
Property investment manager Alex Watt said: ''Pacific House is a
quality building offering good prospects for rental growth. The company
has now invested over #120m across all sectors during the current
financial year and has a continuing requirement in the office sector for
prime office investments in Leeds and Birmingham.''
The buyer was represented by Richard Ellis. The vendors were advised
by Gooch &amp; Wagstaff.
Scottish towns lead
way in retail market

Jennifer Cunningham meets a librarian who turned to writing and was
surprised to achieve recognition as an author of excellent stories for
children.
THIS year's winner of the Carnegie Medal for children's literature
takes a special joy in being honoured by the Library Association.
Theresa Breslin, prizewinning author, is a community librarian in
Strathkelvin and sees libraries as one of the few institutions in which
everyone of whatever age, class, race or religion feels equally at home.
''In Scotland, especially, ordinary people value the idea that
libraries belong to them and much of that is due to Andrew Carnegie's
insistence that his endowment of buildings and books had to be
maintained by the burghs.''
She had a job in a cafe when a friend suggested she would enjoy
working in a library. ''I knew after a couple of weeks that this was for
me. I have always read but never thought I would be a writer,'' she
said.
It was much later that to keep her sister company she went to a
writing class by Margaret Thomson Davis. ''If she had asked us to write
a story I would not have done it, but she guided us through creating
characters and situations and at the end we had a story competition
which I won.'' Theresa Breslin has been winning ever since.
Her first children's book, Simon's Challenge, inspired by the closure
of the Gartcosh steelworks won the Kathleen Fidler award for unpublished
authors. A stint on the mobile library took her regularly to Gartcosh,
in which she became very interested when the school did a local history
project showing how the women had kept the steel mill working during the
war.
She had been aware for some time that there was very little modern
Scottish writing for children. ''There was plenty of history, which is
excellent, but nothing that related to children's own experience.''
Her realisation that despite the steelwokers' march from Gartcosh to
London, the closure was making little impact at national level, turned
into the idea of looking at redundancy from a child's point of view.
Whether it is from years of encouraging young people in the library or
from being a mother of three girls and a boy, now young adults, she has
an instinct for identifying with children of all sorts. Simon's life is
channelled towards ways of getting his own computer, but Solomon, the
hero of the Carnegie winner Whispers in the Graveyard, is a dyslexic boy
who lives with an alcoholic father after his mother walks out.
''He is not a nice boy,'' says his creator. She would not like to have
him in her class if she were a teacher, she says, but after research
involving trying to read everything reflected in a mirror for several
days, she does understand the frustration of someone who is dyslexic but
deemed stupid and she conveys it in a short graphic scene in which
Solomon wreaks havoc in the classroom, hurls the teacher's handbag at
the blackboard and destroys her personal belongings.
There is much more to Whispers in the Graveyard than a struggle with
dyslexia. It touches on history with a mass grave of smallpox victims,
the supernatural and family and school relationships. Theresa Breslin
considers it her best book to date and one which works on more than one
level.
As a relative newcomer, she won the oldest award for childen's
writing, in competition with some big names including Michael Morpurgo,
Jenny Nimmo, Berlie Docherty and Lynne Reid Banks, probably because she
believes passionately that the story is the most important element,
whatever social issues may slide in.
''I don't write for an age range and I don't try to write for a
particular type of child,'' she said.
Her experience as a librarian has shown her that dyslexia is a much
bigger problem than is generally realised. ''There is an enormous
problem of people who have difficulty with the printed word. For example
you find children listening to a story with very difficult concepts but
who are quite unable to read it. The tendency to dyslexia can run in
families, but it is more important than ever for children to be able to
read and write now that there are no apprenticeships for trades.''
Although enormously prestigious, the Carnegie Medal offers no rich
pickings for the winner, but Peters Library Services provides #1000
worth of books to a library or charity of the winner's choice.
Appropriately the Scottish dyslexia group's new centre in Stirling will
receive #1000 worth of books from Whispers in the Graveyard's success.
''It has really worked out very well. They are just setting up a
central office and so they can now get books about dyslexia but also
books that children want to read.''
Her next book will be published in September. Homecoming for Kezzie is
a sequel to Kezzie, the serialisation of which in a magazine produced a
deluge of letters from adults.
The heroine is a particularly spunky teenage orphan who travels alone
from Scotland to Canada in search of her sister whose emigration had
been arranged by welfare officials as one of a shipload of destitute
children in the 1930s. The BBC have taken an option on it for their
children's drama serial slot. In the sequel Kezzie returns to Clydebank
in time for the blitz.
The librarian Breslin enjoys the research as much as the writing, but
found interviews with people who were children at the time disturbing.
''What could it have been like for a 10-year-old child to go to school
each morning and look to see whose desk was empty?''
She enjoys communicating with people too much to shut herself away as
a full-time writer. She has recently begun job-sharing, not to give
herself more time for writing but to allow time for author's visits to
other libraries, where she will now be in greater demand than ever.

ANN SHAW discusses the alleviation of pain through subtlety and
sympathy
A GLASGOW-based survey reveals that 80% of its population is suffering
from some form of pain, yet its treatment, especially for long-term
sufferers, is much neglected, maintains Professor James McEwan, the
city's director of public health.
As his group's study of 5000 Glaswegians nears compeletion, he says
the challenge is to treat sufferers successfully with a
multi-disciplinary approach. He points out that a combination of drugs,
exercise, relaxation, and other therapies -- if necessary aromatherapy
or acupuncture -- appears to be the most beneficial course.
Professor McEwan stresses the importance of a co-ordinated approach
tailored for the individual. There are limited resources within the NHS
and few people attend a pain clinic.
The hospice movement pioneered alternative treatments, recognising the
importance of listening skills. ''You have to learn to listen to what
people are telling you about about their pain,'' says Professor McEwan.
Pain is never neutral. Sometimes it is emotional or psychological
rather than physical. Sharing information on coping with pain is another
useful tool, and that's where the self-help organisation, Pain
Association Scotland, fulfil a vital role.
David Falconer, national co-ordinator of the Pain Association,
formerly Plus, says the recent name change was necessary to encompass
the broad range of work it does and to give it a higher profile.
''There are more than 20 self-help groups in Scotland with just under
1000 members and carers. It's not just the sufferer who suffers. Someone
with chronic pain affects the whole family too. They have to look after
that person.''
Many people lose their jobs because of pain. ''The largest proportion
of chronic pain sufferers are of working age, yet this is often thought
of as a problem for the elderly.''
Pain clinics -- there are about a dozen in Scotland -- offer
short-term solutions. ''Providing you go to them you will be relieved of
pain but only so much time can be allocated to you on the NHS because
there is a long waiting list. You find yourself in the revolving door
syndrome. That's where self-help support groups step in and fill that
gap.''
Going to a Pain Association group is a decision people make often at
the end of a very long road: they have tried conventional and
unconventional methods of relieving pain without success.
A support group, while not promising or offering an instant cure,
often helps to alleviate distress. Such groups assist in a number of
ways, offering understanding and friendship. They offer advice on
strategies for pain management.
To this end Pain Association Scotland provides the services of a
registered hypnotherapist, telephone support, a comprehensive list of
alternative therapies, and books and tapes. They also arrange regular
speakers and workshops on pain management.
A self-help association, which started as a house group in Edinburgh
in 1980, Pain Association Scotland has become a national organisation
working with people who live in chronic pain from a variety o conditions
from osteoporosis to cancer.
The Glasgow area has seven groups -- South, Inverclyde, Kilmarnock,
Knightswood, Monklands, Ruchazie and Strathkelvin.
One of the Knightswood branch's members is always a tonic to others.
Evelyn McLaughlin, is warm-hearted, has a ready smile and cheers others
up. She is a familiar figure to many people in the city's West End
through her work in local voluntary organisations and the church.
Yet for the past 30 years she has lived with chronic ill health and
pain, for she had to give up nursing as a 25-year-old because of asthma.
Since then she developed osteoporosis.
She never complains. She takes each day as it comes. Belonging to Pain
Association Scotland has enabled her to try a whole variety of pain
relieving strategies: ''I have a TENS machine which I use when the pain
gets really bad. That helps. You've got to keep trying. Everything helps
a little bit. You've got to find you own package of pain care.
''I've tried them all, including hypnotherapy. We all want to try and
reduce as much as possible the pain-killing drugs we have to take.''
Evelyn is on the committee at Knightswood and is also an active member
of the Victim Support group, for those who have suffered burglaries, as
well as her local osteoporosis group: ''By helping others I am helping
myself too. I've found my niche in life,'' she adds.

Midge Ure recalls vivid memories of Wembley '85 and tells Gavin Bell
why he believes it is time for Live Aid II.
IT WAS the ultimate gig -- the cream of the world's rock stars
performing for more than a billion viewers in 170 countries in a
megaconcert that raised #40m for famine relief in Africa.
It was a magnificent gesture that could have merited the Churchillian
tribute: ''Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so
many to so few.'' It was also, of course, a hard act to follow.
Ten years after Live Aid, Midge Ure is touring more prosaic venues.
Last weekend it was The Anvil in Basingstoke, next week it is the Civic
Hall in Aylesbury, and soon he will be appearing at Falkirk Town Hall.
It is a far cry from the emotional roller-coaster of Wembley '85, but
Ure still gets a kick out of arguably the greatest day in the history of
rock.
''I'm probably only now beginning to make sense of it all,'' he says.
''At the time it built up a momentum of its own and swept us all along
with it. There wasn't time to think about what we were doing. We just
knew we were doing something good, something special, and it felt
great.''
For the former Ultravox frontman from Cambuslang, the first chords
were struck in 1984 when he joined forces with Bob Geldof, after
watching horrific television images of starving Ethiopians. Together
they wrote a song which they called Do They Know It's Christmas, and on
December 15 they assembled some of the world's top musicians in a studio
in west London to record it.
It was just a one-off single, Ure recalls. They hoped it would be a
Christmas hit and maybe make #100,000. In fact the Band Aid record
netted #8m, and generated a momentum for famine relief that carried
through until 1992 when the Band Aid Trust was wound up. By then, almost
$150m had been spent combating the causes and effects of famine in
Africa.
Ure, now a veteran rocker at 41, is enjoying a return to the spotlight
in a hectic round of interviews on the 10th anniversary of his greatest
performance. His most vivid memory is of leaving Wembley stadium, being
driven through a sea of humanity swelling with goodwill. It was like
Glasgow at Hogmanay, except much, much bigger, he recalls. ''Everywhere
we went people were having parties, inviting other people to join them.
There was this huge feeling of happiness, it was as if somebody had
waved a wand and made everybody feel good. But it wasn't magic, it was
real.''
With the benefit of hindsight, Ure admits the Band/Live Aid
contribution was little more than a drop in the ocean of human suffering
in Africa. But the scale of Third-World famine should not diminish the
rock world's attempt to help relieve it, he says.
''After 10 years, some people have got their claws out, looking for
nasty scabs from Live Aid. But there were no scabs, it was all up front.
Of course even then, there was a feeling that it might be a futile
attempt to deal with a problem that was just too big. But we thought it
was better to try to do something on any level, rather than nothing. And
we were right. Just look at the legacies.''
The most tangible benefit is the obvious one -- there are thousands of
people alive today who would have been buried in mass graves in the
parched soil of Ethiopia long ago if Geldof and company had not come to
their aid. Ure believes there was another spin-off which is still
benefiting people in need.
''It was so big, and so popular, that it changed the attitudes of
young people towards charity. Suddenly it became groovy to do gigs for
charity, and everybody got on the bandwagon. I think Live Aid did more
in the long run for other good causes than people realise.''
A hard act to follow it may be, but Ure still thinks it can -- and
should -- be done. ''There's no reason why there couldn't be another
Live Aid. In fact the world's big enough to have one every year, why
not? There'll always be hungry people in need of help, and hopefully
there'll always be good live music that the rest of us want to hear.''
It is hard to imagine a repeat of the day-long concerts in London and
Philadelphia that featured the most dazzling array of popular musical
talent ever assembled. From the moment Status Quo took to the Wembley
stage at noon in blazing sunshine and burst into Rockin' All Over The
World, it was obvious Live Aid was going to be an event unlike anything
seen before.
But many of the stars who participated are still going strong -- Elton
John, Sting, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, U2, and Dire Straits are still
capable of rocking the world in a worthy cause.
Midge Ure might just consider postponing one of his forthcoming gigs
at the Barnsley Civic or the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr if somebody feels
like organising Live Aid II. ''The thing is,'' he says, ''despite all
the problems and all the sceptics, it worked. It really worked.''

Bruce Sandison believes there is a downside to the Crown Estate
success.
THE Crown Estate had a good year according to its annual report. A
substantial revenue surplus was made from a turnover of #133.2m, and
investment in Scottish fish farming was ''one of the biggest success
stories, contributing 29% of the revenue''.
Lord Mansfield, Crown Estate chairman and first commissioner, reported
a highly successful year ''particularly in Scotland'', and an estate
spokeswoman confirmed that the fish-farming industry was in a healthy
position, exporting regularly to Europe from the West of Scotland.
This mutual back-slapping disguises a darker side to Crown Estate
activities: the tragedy of the continuing decline in sea trout, which is
now on the verge of extinction in the West Highlands. Many believe the
threat to the sea trout comes from sea-lice infestation, caused by Crown
Estate tenant fish farms sitting close to migratory fish routes.
There is a substantial body of carefully-researched, scientific
evidence from Ireland and Norway which links sea-lice infestation from
fish-farm cages with the decline in sea trout populations, and it is now
beyond reasonable doubt that sea-lice infestation is largely responsible
for decimating the West Highland sea-trout stocks.
Loch Maree, once a prolific sea-trout fishery with a seasonal
rod-and-line catch in the order of 3000, struggles to muster a couple of
dozen fish. Loch Eilt, a renowned West Highland sea-trout fishery, with
a historic annual catch counted in thousands, now produces two or three
fish a year. Loch Hope's sea-trout fishing has been restricted, while
Loch Stack has been closed to sea-trout fishing altogether. Loch Shiel
is almost devoid of the fish. The story is the same throughout the West
Highlands: wherever there are fish farm cages, sea-trout stocks have
collapsed.
0 The Crown Estate addresses the matter, briefly, in its annual
report: ''Concerns about falling sea-trout populations around the West
Coast had led to the setting up of the West Highland Sea Trout &amp; Salmon
Group (WHST&amp;SG),'' it said. The Crown Estate offered its ''support of
the concept of local co-operation and consultation . . . working towards
an improvement in fish stocks''.
However, even the report of the WHST&amp;SG, published in March this year,
refused to accept that sea-lice infestation was a matter for serious
concern. The Irish and Norwegian evidence was simply ''noted'' by the
group.
Michael Smith, chairman of the Salmon and Trout Association, said the
report was ''a masterly exercise in the evasion of the obvious''.
The group was composed of M Gravestock, of the Crown Estate
Commissioners; Dr J Webster and Dr M Halliday, from the Scottish Salmon
Growers' Association; Dr R G J Shelton, of the Freshwater Fisheries
Research Laboratory at Pitlochry, and his colleagues, Dr A F Walker and
Dr S J Northcott. Finally, from the Scottish Office, G A Owenson and D R
Dickson.
Rod-and-line angling interests were represented, but they failed to
make any impact. After the WHST&amp;SG report was published, the Salmon and
Trout Association and the Scottish National Anglers' Association issued
a bleak statement which began by saying:
''The inclusion of the Fish Farmers and Crown Estate Commissioners as
delegates to the group's meetings . . . precluded any decisive
conclusions or clear statements with regard to the resiting of salmon
farms and the almost proven certainty of sea lice causing the demise of
the sea trout in the West of Scotland.''
Since then, not one of the local trusts recommended by the WHST&amp;SG
have been set up. As far as the Crown Estate and the fish farmers are
concerned, it has been business as usual. Scottish Office scientists
have yet to refute the Irish and Norwegian evidence that proves the
damage sea-lice infestation causes.
However, they now do admit a problem exists. In a letter dated April
11 1995, Dr A F Walker of the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory reported
on a sampling of Scottish sea trout in inshore waters which had taken
place in early summer 1994.
In his letter, sent to Alan Whitfield, factor of the Westminster
Estate in Sutherland, Dr Walker wrote: ''Relatively high mean values
(over 20 lice) were found at Dunstaffnage Bay near Oban, at the River
Gruinard, the River Laxford, the River Morar and the River Snizort (in
Skye). The maximum louse burdens found were at Dunstaffnage (330), and
at the Rivers Ewe (207), Gruinard (182 and 94), Hope (100), Laxford
(111, 230, 173), Morar (100), and Snizort (280). Also, the maximum
infestation levels appear to be higher than we have found previously.''

TWO men, who were jailed for nine months on fraud and corruption
charges, had their convictions quashed yesterday.
Three judges in the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that Mr Roy Ridler,
43, and Mr David Irvine, 47, had suffered a miscarriage of justice.
Mr Ridler, of Upsall Grove, Fairfield, Stockton on Tees, Cleveland,
and Mr Irvine, of North Road, Lowthertown, Eastriggs, Dumfriesshire,
were jailed by Sheriff A C Henry at Glasgow on July 7, last year.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, Lord Weir, who heard the
appeal with Lord Justice General Hope and Lord Cameron, said the charges
related to obtaining contracts and money for various works at Lennox
Castle Hospital, Lennoxtown, between February 1991 and February 1992.
Mr Ridler was an employee of Greater Glasgow Health Board and Mr
Irvine a director of Solway Boilers (Annan) Ltd.
They were found guilty of devising a fraudulent scheme to cause health
board officials to release funding of #28,000 for the removal and
replacement of radiators at Lennox Castle.
Mr Irvine was also charged with corruptly giving four cheques worth a
total of #4000, and Mr Ridler with receiving the cheques as inducements
for showing favour in awarding contracts for the work.
Lord Weir said both men had been interviewed separately by police and
made statements which could be construed as both incriminating and
clearing them from blame.
In his charge to the jury, Sheriff Henry had said: ''You can only have
regard to what an accused person said as evidence against himself, and
it does not bear upon the position of the other accused, who was not
present and not in a position to take issue with anything that was
said.''
Lord Weir said this was an accurate and necessary direction, but the
two men argued later the sheriff had effectively contradicted himself on
this point. He had directed the jury's attention to what both men had
said in their interviews and pointed out certain differences in their
accounts.
At one stage he had said: ''It is quite clear Mr Ridler and Mr Irvine
are at odds as to this.''
Lord Weir commented: ''We cannot affirm that the jury might not have
drawn an adverse conclusion as to the appellants' credibility as a
result of their attention being drawn to this difference.''

Exercise can be enjoyed by mothers-to-be as Deedee Cuddihy discovers
when she meets women determined to keep in shape for the delivery
EXERCISE during pregnancy? For some women, that could entail walking
to and from the nearest bakery for a bag of greasy doughnuts.
For readers of Fit Pregnancy, however (an American magazine now
available here), it means squeezing into a shiny lycra bodysuit five
days a week for a session of low-impact aerobics followed by abdominal
exercises, weight training and a brisk, two-mile walk.
Some try working out with rubberised resistance bands and when they're
in the water, Wave Web gloves and aqua shoes ''for added traction''.
One particularly keen reader wanted to know if it was alright to go on
a ''hut-to-hut cross-country ski trip'' when she was five months'
pregnant. The magazine's resident doctor advised ''no'' and suggested,
''find a more leisurely activity closer to home and enjoy your
pregnancy''.
So what's wrong with a few gentle yoga exercises all of a sudden? It
isn't enough that women work through their entire pregnancy, get thrown
out of hospital within hours of giving birth and are clocking on at the
office again almost before the baby's eyes have begun to focus.
Now, apparently, we've got to aim for ''buns and abs of steel'' as
well. (That's gym-speak for dead hard abdominal muscles and a backside
that doesn't wobble when you jump up and down.)
It seems that America's obsession with dieting and exercise has
spawned a generation of women who are terrified -- even when pregnant --
of losing control of the bodies they've worked so hard to mould.
But could it happen here?
One Glasgow-based aerobics coach told me: ''Compared to their
counterparts in North America and countries like France and Germany,
British GPs are pretty conservative about exercising during pregnancy so
in my opinion, women here don't receive enough encouragement to keep
fit.
''It shouldn't be a case of 'you're pregnant, get thee to a gym!' but
there's no reason to give up exercising provided you take certain
precautions. Overheating, for instance, can have an adverse affect on
the foetus and you've got to watch your ligaments which become naturally
relaxed during pregnancy and can be more easily damaged.
''Anything that involves extended jumping up and down or twirling
around obviously isn't a good idea which rules out jogging and
high-impact aerobics work.
''Maintaining good circulation when you're pregnant is very important
and swimming or walking are great ways to achieve that.''
Midwife Fiona McClintock had sloughed off her nurse's gear and,
wearing leggings, trainers and a baggy T-shirt -- hair scraped back in a
ponytail -- was in Aqua-Natal coaching mode at the side of the training
pool in Drumchapel Leisure Centre.
There were 15 women in the water, 14 of them decidedly pregnant, one
of them decidedly not (unless something very weird had happened to me on
the way out to the pool that evening).
''You can't write about Aqua-Natal exercise unless you experience it
yourself,'' Fiona had insisted. So I'd donned my trusty Speedo bathing
costume and joined the others while Fiona, on dry land, turned up the
music and put us through our, gentle, paces. By the end of the half
hour, I'd just about got the hang of manoeuvres like skipping backwards
through shoulder-high water.
Fiona is the midwife co-ordinator for the Aqua-Natal classes that
Glasgow District Council's Women in Sport Department runs at eight
swimming pools in the Glasgow area.
The scheme was launched three years ago and is proving so popular that
another training course for coaches (women only, in case you were
wondering) will take place later this month so that more classes can be
set up.
Jennifer Reid, head of Women in Sport, said: ''When you're pregnant
it's important to continue to give your heart and lungs a proper,
regular workout and to keep muscles toned up. Exercising in water is one
of the safest and best ways to do that.
''Currently all our classes are led by midwives as well as a number of
obstetric physiotherapists but we might also consider training qualified
aerobics teachers who have a special interest in this field. They would,
however, only be allowed to coach in partnership with a midwife.''
Which is reassuring news for the women who attend Drumchapel
Aqua-Natal classes for although they all agreed that it was the water
exercises that had attracted them along in the first place, having a
midwife on hand to lead the after-pool discussion and relaxation session
made for a doubly enjoyable evening.
The sharp-eyed among us have glimpsed, occasionally, folk working out
on those instruments of torture at the Body Club gym whose picture
windows face on to Sauchiehall Street.
When I phoned to inquire if pregnant women were catered for, manager
Carol Hunter asked me: ''Is this a wind up?''
Carol, it turned out, was three months' pregnant herself and after
eight years of pumping countless tons of iron and pounding the top speed
treadmill, she was now back to square one with low-impact aerobics and
the lightest-weight dumb bells, much to the amusement of colleagues and
customers.
''The Americans are shouting about things we've been doing for ages!''
Carol laughed. In fact, we introduced a special pregnancy workout six
years ago. There was a demand for it from customers who wanted to
continue coming to the gym even though they were going to have a baby.
''It's a safe, gentle routine which concentrates on posture and
keeping the muscles toned.
''Although I'm looking forward seeing my bump get bigger, I know some
of the girls worry when their waistline starts to disappear. After years
of keeping in shape, it can be a blow to your self-esteem.''
The Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow has been running a special,
once-a-week exercise class for pregnant women since 1987. It's an hour
of low-impact aerobics plus stretch and flex to music. (Preceded by a
walk, if you're coming on foot from George Square up one of the steepest
inclines in Glasgow; jokingly referred to as ''induction row''.)
Isabel Campbell, superintendent physiotherapist at the hospital, said:
''There's no positive proof, yet, which ties fitness in pregnancy to a
better quality of pregnancy or better birth but it undoubtedly makes
women feel better about themselves especially if they're used to
exercising and don't want to give it up.
''It's worrying though, that some women may be going to classes where
the person in charge isn't properly qualified and has no idea about the
guidelines for exercising during pregnancy.
''To be on the safe side, you should always check first with your GP,
midwife or physiotherapist.''
Exercise classes at Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital are free.
Aqua-Natal classes cost #2.60 per session. Current cost of membership of
the Body Club is #25 and approximately #17 a month thereafter. For
further information about training to coach Aqua-Natal classes, phone
Jennifer Reid on 0141 227 5933 or Fiona McClintock on 0141 334 5846.

<RECORDNO>977420486</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
RADIOACTIVE contamination has been found in an office within the main
administrative block at the Dounreay nuclear plant.
Management says the material, which was immediately removed, was low
active and did not pose a health risk.
It was found in a follow-up check after the detection of 20 hot-spots
on roadside grass verges at the site.
The latest discovery led to a renewed call for the site to be closed
down until the contamination problems are dealt with.
Mrs Lorraine Mann, spokesperson for Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping,
said the find in a non-active area of the site reinforces her earlier
criticisms about working practices and monitoring procedures.
She said: ''We've been told for years by Dounreay that there's no way
this sort of thing could happen. We were told there is absolutely no way
that someone could go through a doorway with the smallest level of
radioactivity without radiation bells and bleepers going off.''
Mrs Mann believed Dounreay could not say with certainty that the
contamination had not damaged the health of office staff or cleaners.
Spokesman Ian Shepherd said the single spot was the only one found in
a scan of main administration buildings, including offices, the canteen,
and the lecture theatre.
He said a fossil kept on a desk in a nearby office was found to have a
background activity nearly five times as high.
Mr Shepherd said: ''That perhaps puts in context the sort of reading
we're talking about.''
However, he accepted the material should not have been present and
said inquiries were continuing as to how it could have ended up in the
office.

SOMETIMES you think someone has seen into your mind. Sometimes, too,
the past has such a strong hold on our present, it's almost impossible
to escape it. This inspirational, life-enhancing new play about
conditioning and predetermination confirms the sparkling talent of
Puerto Rican Jose Rivera, whose capacity for language sizzles with
sinuosity and a surreal energy.
A love story and a terrifying picture of possessive paternal love, it
is also a play of defiant hope. It is set in the imaginative realms of
the mind and objectively in the home of an insatiable stud, Augie
(Vincenzo Nicoli), who has fathered 22 children. Arrogant and
contemptuous, he expects total subservience and gets it from the one
daughter we do meet, Nelly. She is neglected, barely articulate but with
a spirit of steel, something her father is determined to break.
It is a battle of wills to the death. Each Day has echoes of Tennessee
Williams, and it weaves a spell of extraordinary emotional power thanks
to young director Dominic Hill's imaginative, subtle production and
designer Nick Sargent's subtle blend of modern technology (video
imagery) and symbolism (suspended oranges).
However it is the performances that raise it to another level. Nicoli
and Jonathan Wrather as Johnny are outstanding, but it is newcomer Rakie
Ayola who is revealed as an actress of withering passion and
sensitivity. When she pushes herself to her feet at the end, defying the
subservient habits of her past, hers is a triumph not just over evil but
over her own destiny as well.

Theatre
A KIND of Glasgow Citz in miniature, the Gate has long been known for
its successful championing of lost gems of European theatre and is
enjoying another purple spell with its current German season. Having
resuscitated the Spanish ''golden period'' and several Greek classics,
their German season, spanning some 200 years of German theatre, scores
another triumph with this stunning promenade production by young
director Dominic Cooke.
Like a companion piece to 7:84's Born Guilty, Martin Sperr's 1966
post-war drama spotlights the uncomfortable legacies of the Hitler years
(it opens with a stunning tableaux of bodies, horribly reminiscent of
pictures of the concentration camps). Set in a Bavarian village in 1948,
it shows how in times of unemployment and economic insecurity, brutal,
violent emotions turn on those who do not subscribe to what ''honest,
respectable citizens'' consider the norm -- in this case a young, gay
man, a sexually free young woman, and a slightly backward young man.
Ending in tragedy, the hub of this pernicious groundswell is expressed
through the mouths of women, borne on a tidal wave of gossip and
ignorance and endorsed within an atmosphere of god-fearing bigotry.
The cast -- a new company called Act of Faith -- are uniformly
impressive, especially the dangerously sanctimonious butcher's wife of
Jenny Armitage, Mary Roscoe as her equally destructive friend Zenta, and
heart-rendingly Mary Ellen Ray and Gerard Crossan as the mother and
victimised son of the villagers' persecution.

Dance
DAY THREE -- no-one, it seems, has time to be exhausted! I noticed one
or two tutors with a bemused but happy expression; it's as if they can't
quite believe the pell-mell level of activity, the sheer intensity that
has engulfed the place. There's something very fine, heady and uplifting
about seeing so many young people swept up in -- and thoroughly enjoying
-- the making of dance.
This was particuarly true of Body Talk, from Newcastle, who danced to
the rippling rhythms and gentle, nostalgic words of that glorious Orb
song, Little Fluffy Clouds. The signing at the beginning was the only
indication that the dancers are deaf -- just how well they danced
together was shown by the standing ovation from the other groups.
Castlemilk Youth Group -- recently formed as part of the festival's
Outreach programme -- showed how much can be achieved in a short time
with Changing Colour, a nifty comment on the wastefulness of rival
actions when so much of the environment is in a mess. This piece had
sparky dance, strong words, and a clever way with props that wittily
pointed up the message.
Footnotes Dance Company performed two works, Purple and Beltain, both
very much mood pieces where movement (and costumes) thoughtfully
captured the feel of the music. Skelfin' Weavers (Stirling Youth Dance
Company) made use of tableaux and folk dance motifs to suggest the life
and times of weaver girls, while Newcastle's Booyaka were bang up to
date with street moves choreographed into a pleasing piece of action.

A DOCTOR addicted to alcohol and drugs forged prescriptions to support
his habit, a court heard yesterday.
Dr Iain Macaskill had been addicted to drink for most of his working
life and obtained morphine on an almost daily basis at one time.
Macaskill, 44, of Fassifern Avenue, Bridge of Don, admitted three
charges of uttering and two of fraud when he appeared for sentence at
Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday.
He has given up his occupational health practice in Aberdeen and faces
continued treatment for his problems.
Over a three-month period at the end of last year, Macaskill obtained
500 dihydrocodeine tablets, 70 ampoules of morphine, and a quantity of
diazepan from a number of city chemists.
Fiscal Alastair Carmichael told the court the crimes came to light
when one of the chemists became suspicious and contacted the police last
December.
Macaskill was interviewed by police on January 6 but during the next
two weeks continued to make out regular prescriptions.
He prescribed the ampoules of morphine, diazepan, and painkillers in a
woman's name, pretending they were for her use.
Macaskill, father of two teenage children, has since spent a number of
months as an in-patient at a rehabilitation unit, his lawyer told the
court.
Mr Robin Leith said: ''He obtained a large amount of drugs for his own
use by dishonest means.
''The bottom line is that the accused has a severe tendency to
addiction and that has been the case throughout his career.
''Normally, that has manifested itself as alcohol abuse.
Unfortunately, as with any addiction, the tolerance increases and the
accused required large amounts frequently in order to satisfy his
addiction.
''This reached a peak in January this year.
''He appreciates that he has let himself down and his family down and
let down his partner in the private occupational health centre he
practised,'' Mr Leith added.
Deferring sentence for a year, Sheriff Charles McFarlane said: ''It
seems quite clear that your offending related to your drug addiction.
There does appear to be prospects of a rehabilitation and with that in
mind I am prepared to give you a chance.''
Macaskill was ordered to continue attending the treatment centre.

Music
THE almost interminable wait for Public Enemy's arrival on stage at
Barrowland last night served not only to raise anxiety about seeing any
of the show before the intervention of a review deadline, but also to
increase expectation among what the band acknowledge to be one of their
favourite audiences from their 32 tours in their nine-year existence.
It was also announced that this was to be Public Enemy's last visit to
Europe, and while they will continue occasionally to work together, the
first part of their show proved that they remain, in their current
incarnation, a powerful live act, even if their most recent album, Muse
Sic And Hour Message, suggested they had lost much of their potency on
record.
If the music, and to some extent the stage show, seemed to be becoming
cliched, then much of this has to be put down to Public Enemy not only
defining the whole genre of hardcore rap, but inventing most of the
cliche attached to it.
What Side Are You On, which introduced Flavor Flav, was an incredible
burst of on-stage energy, while Fight The Power remains one of the
indispensable anthems of the late eighties.
Away from the music Chuck D spends much of the time setting out his
personal manifesto, based on his belief that hiphop ''is in a bad
state''. He announces that the band's core members will between them be
releasing books, and solo albums, as well as spending more time working
with, and promoting, new acts.
If his pronouncements have lost some of their bite in favour of
political correctness, then he has successfully identified that Public
Enemy's time is up. Unlike many important artists, he knows when to stop
and, on the evidence of last night, Public Enemy's legacy will be all
the richer for it.

A GARAGE owner has been ordered to pay #1000 after a pregnant employee
was sexually discriminated against.
Miss Joanne Reader, of Ainslie Road, Cumbernauld, was also awarded an
additional #4329 after an industrial tribunal ruled she had been
unfairly dismissed on December 29 last year from her job at McCashins
Service Station, Condorrat, Cumbernauld.
Miss Reader started work at the service station on October 7, 1994,
and in December, along with other staff, was warned that failure to
attend work on Christmas Day or New Year's Day required a doctor's
certificate.
About a week before Christmas, Miss Reader told Mrs C Miller, her area
manager, that she was pregnant.
Miss Reader was scheduled to work Christmas Day and be off on New
Year's Day. She finished work at 7am on Christmas morning and was due to
return to work at 7pm that night.
Around an hour before beginning work she felt sick.
Her boyfriend telephoned her work to say she wasn't well and next day
another call was made to say she still wasn't fit to return. However,
Miss Reader was telephoned by an employee and told she had to come in,
as alternative cover couldn't be arranged.
Miss Reader returned to work at 7am on December 29 and was asked by
Mrs Miller if she had a doctor's certificate for her absence. She told
the area manager that she hadn't thought her condition serious enough to
warrant an emergency call-out for a doctor and offered a
self-certification certificate, which was unacceptable to Mrs Miller.
In finding Miss Reader had been unfairly dismissed, the tribunal
stated: ''It was quite unreasonable to summon a doctor then on duty for
emergency calls for what was clearly not an emergency.''
0 On the sex discrimination claim, the tribunal said they accepted
Miss Reader's evidence of the statement allegedly made to her by Mrs
Miller and added: ''That statement in effect was that the respondents
did not want to employ persons who took days off because of
pregnancy-related illness.''

THE whispering campaign has started again. Mr Paddy Ashdown's position
as leader of the Liberal Democrats allegedly is under threat and a
number of his own MPs are said to be fed up with the way he is running
the party.
At Westminster today, all the Liberal Democrat MPs will gather for an
annual meeting which, depending on who you spoke to last, is either a
routine gathering to discuss past performance and future policy, or a
crisis meeting to find ways of pulling the Liberal Democrats out of the
doldrums.
It may be a little unfair to describe their position as the doldrums,
given their spectacular recent by-election victories in which they have
wiped the Tories off the map in places like Newbury and Christchurch,
but there undoubtedly are rumblings in the ranks about Mr Ashdown's
leadership and there may be more to come.
The Liberal Democrats are poised to win the Littleborough and
Saddleworth by-election on July 27, caused by the death of Tory MP
Geoffrey Dickens, but the word at Westminster is that they will not do
so by as much as might previously have been thought, and there are even
one or two people who believe -- call it wild fantasy if you like --
that the Tories can hang on.
Not all of this, of course is down to Mr Ashdown, but there is a wee
feeling that the Lib Dems have been sidelined by the resurgence of the
Blair-led Labour Party and that the Tories have not exactly been damaged
by Mr Major's ''put up or shut up'' challenge on the leadership.
Mr Ashdown's problem is where on earth to pitch his party's message,
and even that he has managed recently to confuse. He appears to be
trying to manoeuvre his party away from its policy of equidistance
between Labour and the Tories to a more pro-Labour stance, while at the
same time making clear that there still are substantial policy
differences between the two parties.
Any formal pact with Labour is out (Mr Blair would have nothing to do
with it anyway) but in the event of a hung parliament the Liberals would
not be prepared to prop up a minority Tory government. It would prop up
a minority Labour one, simply because they have a bit more in common,
but Mr Ashdown's message seems only to have confused not just the
electorate but supporters and activists in his own party, and therein
lies the problem.
There have been whispering campaigns against Ashdown before, most
notably at the Brighton annual conference last year, and he has
survived, but there appears to be an increasing feeling that he is
concentrating rather too much on foreign affairs -- Bosnia being the
prime example -- and not enough on the domestic front.
The respect with which politicians from other parties treat him also
has diminished. He had, if you will forgive the phrase, a ''good'' Gulf
War, simply because he had been in the area years ago as a member of the
Special Boat Squadron, but in recent times his Commons contributions
have been greeted by groans, moans and guffaws from the Government
benches.
If not Ashdown, now 54, then who else? There are probably only three,
and perhaps only two, real alternatives. Alan Beith, the doughty fighter
who unsuccessfully challenged Ashdown for the leadership of the party in
1988, is seen by many as the person who represents the soul of the
party, but he is, as one observer has put it ''charismatically
challenged,'' and may not, therefore be the person the party will look
to for leadership.
The two real contenders, therefore, are two Scots. Menzies Campbell,
MP for North East Fife, and Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and
Skye. Mr Campbell, a QC, is in many ways the brains of the party and is
a quite superb Commons operator. He is measured, quiet, thoughtful, will
not use 50 words where five will do perfectly well, and is listened to
with respect by his opponents -- from whichever party -- simply because
he will not indulge in the screaming and shouting match that is
Westminster politics but says what he has to say and says it well.
Mr Kennedy is probably known almost as well as Mr Ashdown as the
public face of the Liberal Democrats but, as he is well aware, he is
almost as well known for his appearances on radio and television quiz
shows and his fondness for the media.
More than one or two people think he does not take his politics
seriously enough, though he would dispute that, and there is no argument
that he represents his constituency -- the bottom line in this place --
quite superbly. Mr Ashdown, as anyone close to him will tell you, works
incredibly long hours and appears almost tireless in his advocacy of the
Liberal Democrat cause, which he will no doubt do again when his party
foregathers in Glasgow for its annual conference in September.
Old soldiers never die, they simply fade away, and Mr Ashdown may be
about to do just that.

PLANS for a border-free Europe will be vetoed by Britain despite fresh
assurances from Brussels that scrapping frontier controls would not
compromise national security.
The idea of ending passport and customs checks was dismissed last
night as ''unacceptable'' by the Government within minutes of the
European Commission unveiling its first proposals for legislation
banning all formalities at national land, sea, and airport boundaries
within the EU.
The Commission's aim is to give legal force to the existing political
goal of achieving free movement for Europe's citizens, the ultimate
expression of the European single market.
However, as Italian Commissioner Mario Monti was presenting his
proposed directive at a news conference in Strasbourg, it was revealed
that both British Commissioners, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Neil Kinnock,
had earlier voted against passing the plan to EU governments.
The two had urged Mr Monti to include sufficient guarantees to keep
Britain on board and avoid a veto.
A Government statement also made it clear that agreement was out of
the question.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said: ''We've made it absolutely plain
that we will take whatever steps are necessary to maintain our frontier
controls.''
Pointing out that the proposals required a unanimous decision, he went
on: ''That means we can veto them and if we need to veto them we will.''
Even before seeing the details, a Government spokesman said: ''There
is every indication that the proposals conflict with the Government's
firm determination to maintain the UK's frontier controls with other
member states.''
Mr Monti dismissed British fears: ''In no way will the elimination of
controls at internal frontiers mean reducing the security of citizens,
quite the reverse.''
Mr Monti pointed out his proposals included provisions to put in place
high-level controls at external frontiers before the removal of internal
borders was agreed.
The British Government says it must retain passport controls, not
least because there is no identity card system in the UK to provide a
back-up checking mechanism.
Ireland shares British concern that the Commission's proposed controls
are not tough enough to replace national measures.
* After 18 months of bickering and political manoeuvring, the European
Parliament yesterday appointed an Ombudsman for Europe. The
#200,000-a-year job, created by the Maastricht Treaty, went to Mr Jacob
Soderman, a 57-year-old Finnish lawyer and former Finnish ombudsman.

IN Pickwick Papers it is the Fat Boy's ambition to make people's flesh
creep. In the Commons yesterday it was Mr Gordon Brown's ambition to
make the fat boy's flesh creep, if that is not too harsh a description
of our pleasantly corpulent Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Mr Brown had previously to endure Mr Kenneth Clarke dismissing him as
''a tartan Trappist monk'' for his refusal to communicate his policy on
interest rates or indeed to put a figure to almost any economic indice
as the one Labour favours.
His optimism about the prospects for the Mexican economy was not
forgotten. ''Three days later the peso collapsed,'' recorded Mr Clarke
with relish.
The Chancellor praised Labour's depleted left for at least having an
economic policy even if a daft one, whereas Mr Brown's pretence of
having one was ''a hollow sham''.
Mr Brown realised like the Fat Boy and others who seek to create
unease in their audience that the best way to do it is to build on a
real apprehension or fear that already exists in his hero's or readers'
minds.
About what might Mr Clarke be feeling most uneasy at the moment?
Inflation getting out of control? Having to raise interest rates? A
sharp deterioration in the balance of payments? He passed over these
and, invading Mr Clarke's psyche, summoned up the spectre of Mr Michael
Heseltine, the new tenant at the mythical 10a Downing Street -- the new
third member, as it were, said Mr Brown, of the Downing Street Residents
Association. He forecast that Mr Heseltine would soon be making life
intolerable for his new neighbours just like the rest of the rough
elements that Labour's ''noisy neighbours'' policy seeks to deal with.
They would be plagued by his loud and incessant television and radio
interviews, his insatiable appetite for home improvements. Mr Major
might wake up and looking out of his window find his No 10 rose garden
littered with portacabins as the man at 10a expanded his empire.
Even when the Chancellor emerged from his front door on Budget day for
his big moment he would find his ministerial car's parking space blocked
by the Deputy Prime Minister giving yet another interview to hordes of
journalists.
Yes, mused Mr Brown, the new housing arrangements seem to have all the
makings of another inner city riot -- a long hot summer ahead, men with
not enough to do and facing the prospect of imminent unemployment. Even
the permanent police presence and the mediation of community leaders
might not be able to prevent trouble breaking out. By now, Mr Clarke was
smiling.
Mr Brown had pored through some of the deputy's previous writings to
good effect. Many of the things he wanted to do sounded like things a
Chancellor should do. Come to that some of the numerous committees he
was now going to chair sounded like committees the Chancellor should
chair.
Then there was the question of taxing executive share options as
income, wasn't there? Mr Heseltine is in favour. The Prime Minister
seems to be so. The Chancellor is widely reputed to be not so keen. Then
there was the Prime Minister's electioneering ambition to abolish the
capital gains and inheritance taxes. Was the Chancellor keen on that
wondered Mr Brown, knowing perfectly well he is not.
If trouble erupts in the street, Labour have, they think, just the
policy to deal with it. Evict those noisy, quarrelsome Majors, Clarkes
and Heseltines, and move in new tenants whose names are already on the
waiting list -- the Blairs and Brown. Probably not Prescott. As the
Shadow Chancellor warned Mr Clarke: ''Two's company, three's none.''

<TEXT>
NEW Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is to turn his attention to two
issues which have brought widespread criticism of the Government in
Scotland -- the axing of the Motorail service from Edinburgh and the
threatened closure of the Torry food science research station in
Aberdeen.
Mr Forsyth has indicated that the private sector may be interested in
rescuing the Motorail service, which has not been included in British
Rail's Franchising Director's list of essential services.
The new Scottish Secretary is believed to be optimistic that private
capital may ensure the future of the Motorail service.
He has already contacted the new Transport Secretary, Sir George
Young, on the future of the Fort William sleeper which BR estimates
needs #2.5m to continue operation.
Mr Forsyth is also raising the issue of the Torry food science
research station in Aberdeen, which has received widespread praise for
the excellence of its research and whose services are to be centralised
in Derby, with the new Agriculture Minister, Douglas Hogg, to determine
whether the threat of closure can be lifted.
Last night Labour's Shadow Transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish,
said: ''It is quite obvious that the new Secretary of State for Scotland
is grubbing about for populist ideas to try and revive his party's
fortunes.
''But why is it that after six months of total inactivity and
indifference on the part of Ian Lang he is now taking an interest in the
sleeper service, and why is it that after the same period of
indifference to Motorail that the Secretary of State apparently finds
Motorail interesting?''
Mr McLeish added: ''My challenge to Michael Forsyth is simply this:
first of all will he if he is looking for a popular idea now join all of
us in opposing the crazy notion of rail privatisation?
''And secondly, will he announce publicly that he has in the Scottish
Office a letter showing that Scotland could have a third sleeper service
and the reintroduction of daily Motorail services for the sum of
#250,000 each year?''

THE controversial Brent Spar oil rig could still be dumped at sea,
Energy Minister Tim Eggar insisted yesterday.
Amid Opposition protests he told the Commons that the only victims of
deep water disposal would be worms on the sea bed.
Shell was last month forced to abandon its plans to dump the redundant
oil storage and loading facility in deep water in the Atlantic amid
dramatic attempts by Greenpeace to thwart the operation.
Boycotts of Shell filling stations in Northern Europe were organised
and some were even attacked and Shell had to halt the tow to the
installation's intended final resting place.
Mr Eggar said future methods of disposal would be studied following
Shell's decision to abandon its plans and promised new reports being
prepared on the environmental impact of the Brent Spar's disposal would
be made public.
Shell announced yesterday that it had asked the
internationally-recognised certification authority Det Norske Veritas
(DNV) to conduct an independent inventory on Brent Spar ''partly to
allay any concerns over the alarmist claims made by Greenpeace over
recent weeks''.
They said that the independent inventory, as well as allaying
concerns, would provide a valuable reference point for the further
analysis and comparison of disposal options.
Last night a Greenpeace spokeswoman said: ''Obviously we welcome the
fact that an independent body has been invited to oversee this work. It
is what should have been done a long time ago because Shell are only
guessing at what is on board.

AN Englishman was sentenced to death in Bangkok yesterday for drugs
trafficking and a 58-year-old Scot could die in a Thai jail if convicted
of trafficking in heroin.
Another Briton, Sandra Gregory, whose parents live at Pitcaple, near
Aberdeen, will be sentenced in Bangkok next month for possession of 89
grammes of heroin after her appeal for clemency was turned down. She
faces the prospect of life in prison.
Yesterday, Alan John Davies, 54, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, became
the first European to be sentenced to death in Thailand after being
found guilty of drugs trafficking.
Davies was first given the sentence last month after a five-year court
battle. The sentence was confirmed yesterday but it is expected to be
reduced to life at a later date.
Under Thai law, conviction for trafficking in more than 100 grammes of
heroin carries the death penalty, while a life sentence is usually
imposed on those caught dealing in more than 20 grammes.
Davies was arrested with 6.5 kilos of heroin outside a bank in Bangkok
on January 4, 1990, together with two Germans.
Throughout his trial, he had to request adjournments due to ill
health. He is the only Briton on ''death row'' in Bangkwang Prison,
Bangkok.
At another hearing yesterday, James Dougan Callender, 58, of Greenock,
was charged with trafficking in 200 grammes of heroin and remanded to
Khlong Prem Prison, Bangkok.
Mr Callender was arrested as he checked in for a Garuda Indonesian
airlines flight from Bangkok to Paris.
He had been living in the Phaholyothin area of Bangkok for the last
five years.
Thai police claimed he was carrying the drug internally, packaged in a
condom inserted into his rectum.
Mr Callender joins five other British nationals awaiting their fate on
similar charges.
Some claim they have been victimised following the controversial royal
pardon of two Birmingham girls, Patricia Cahill and Karyn Smith, in
1993, after the intervention of Prime Minister John Major.
The girls had been imprisoned for smuggling #4m of heroin out of
Thailand.
Other prisoners give varying reports on the amount of help given by
the British Embassy.
Brent Stirling, 25, from Perth was seized in an operation last
December involving Thai border police and agents of the US Drugs
Enforcement Administration in a shopping centre in Had Yai, close to
Thailand's border with Malaysia.
US officials are said to have posed as buyers when Stirling allegedly
turned up with 400 small packages containing the drugs.
He was later charged with trafficking almost 600 grammes of cocaine
and heroin. His case remains in limbo while his supporters lobby British
officials to investigate claims that he was set up by the police.
His parents returned from Thailand last week and said their son was in
good health and had received excellent help from embassy officials.
However, eight months ago, Patricia Hussain, 30, of Manchester, who
was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of
trafficking seven kilogrammes of heroin in Bangkok, received little
support from the British Embassy and no representation at her trial.
Sandra Gregory, 29, her cellmate in Lard Yao women's prison, in
contrast received more official attention.
Gregory, who pled guilty but failed in a plea for clemency on grounds
that she had been duped by her partner Robert Lock, 29, from Cambridge,
is due to be sentenced next month.
It was revealed in court that an official at the British Embassy
tipped off the police and asked them to search Lock and his travelling
companions.
Gregory said of Hussain's sentence: ''The Thais are making an example
of us -- this is the backlash from the royal pardon.''
Karl Maxwell-Smith, 65, a Scot who served almost six years in a Thai
prison after a false conviction for the murder of his 30-year-old wife,
told The Herald that in exchange for a #12,000 bribe he could have
secured release from a 100-year sentence.
Last night, a British Foreign Office spokesman said ''very regular''
visits were made to all British nationals in Thai jails.
He said that families were kept informed of these visits but the
Government would not interfere in the legal processes of another country
unless there had been ''a clear miscarriage of justice''.

<TEXT>
A MOVE to ban hunting has been abandoned at Westminster amid
last-ditch attempts yesterday to push through back-bench legislation
curbing cruelty to wild animals.
The Wild Mammals Protection Bill, piloted by Labour's John McFall
(Dumbarton), was undergoing its line-by-line committee stage just two
days before the deadline for it to clear the Commons.
The measure gained its second reading by 253 votes to nil in March,
the first time the House has voted in favour of anti-hunting
legislation. But it has faced unrelenting opposition from country sports
supporters.
Mr McFall said yesterday he had withdrawn those parts of the Bill
relating to hunting. These would have banned the use of dogs to pursue,
injure and kill mammals and the use of snares.
He said he was holding talks with Ministers in a bid to salvage the
measure's key provision making it an offence to inflict suffering upon,
or cruelly ill-treat, a wild mammal.

A BUTCHER yesterday denied slaughtering his work-shy son during a
drunken argument.
Mr Patrick Harte, 47, told the High Court in Glasgow: ''I could never
do that to my son.''
However, advocate-depute Bill Dunlop, prosecuting, told him: ''Maybe
not when you were sober Mr Harte but that night you were drunk.''
Mr Harte, of Midlothian Drive, Shawlands, Glasgow, denies murdering
his 21-year-old son Pat, known as Rikkie, in his home five months ago.
Giving evidence, he claimed he wakened from a drunken sleep and found
his son -- who usually lived with his mother nearby -- dying at the
bottom of the stairs.
He was found sitting bloodstained on the stairs beside Rikkie, who
bled to death, the court has heard.
His bloodstained knife was in a bowl of hot water in the kitchen.
Rikkie's neck and throat were cut through and he was almost decapitated,
the jury heard.
Cross-examining Mr Harte, Mr Dunlop told him: ''There were no signs of
a break-in to the house.
''Your knife had been hanging up in your jacket pocket in the hall,
yet it was used to slaughter your son.
''Rikkie's small knife was found lying in a pool of blood.''
Mr Dunlop added: ''Is it not the truth that you argued with your son
as you sat drinking?
''Then you took your knife from the pocket of your jacket which was
hanging up, lost your head, and killed him?''
Mr Harte, who owns a butcher's shop at 1113 Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow,
denied it.
The court has heard how Rikkie dealt in drugs and was being hunted by
a gang.
The trial before Lord Milligan and a jury continues.

AS many as 54 members of staff at East Park Home and School in Glasgow
could be made redundant in a proposed restructure, it emerged last
night.
The general manager, Mrs May Henderson, said she hoped the final
number would be significantly lower if staff were willing to accept
alternative posts.
The Royal College of Nursing fears the nursing input into the care of
the home's highly-dependent children is to be reduced, with nurses
designated care leaders or care assistants.
The redundancies follow the dismissal in April of Mrs Elaine
McCreadie, the home's matron for seven years, a matter which may come
before an industrial tribunal.
Approximately 213 staff are employed in the home, including teachers,
catering and domestic staff, and 144 nurses and auxiliaries.
Formal consultation between the East Park management, staff, and union
representatives to discuss the proposed redundancies and other changes
began on Monday.
Mrs Henderson said: ''This situation has arisen following in-depth
discussions among the senior management team regarding forward planning
for East Park and in response to comments and recommendations from both
the Social Work Department and the Scottish Office Education Department,
who inspect and provide funding to East Park, together with a report
from a committee which was commissioned by the board of directors.''
A former administrator and wages clerk at the home, Mrs Henderson said
East Park was not a self-supporting organisation.
It was heavily reliant on grant income from the Scottish Office
Education Department and, to maintain this necessary support, East Park
was required to operate within the financial constraints placed upon it.

THE Government is poised to crack down on sex tourists who travel
abroad to hire child prostitutes.
An urgent review of the law was announced yesterday by Home Secretary
Michael Howard who pledged legislation would be brought forward ''as
soon as the details can be satisfactorily resolved''.
The change in the law could mean prison for those going to countries
like Thailand to pay for child sex, or encouraging others to do so.
In a Commons written reply, Mr Howard said the Government was
''urgently examining the scope of the law'' to see what action could be
taken to deal with people in Britain who ''conspire or incite others to
commit offences abroad''.
He said: ''This would enable us to deal with those who organise sex
tours or encourage others to travel abroad for the purpose of sexually
exploiting children.''

LABOUR'S determination to reform the welfare state should not be
underestimated, Mr Tony Blair said yesterday.
He told a Westminster press gallery lunch that the welfare state must
return to its original purpose of being ''a platform of opportunity''.
Mr Blair said Labour would undertake a wholesale review based on six
principles:
1 The system should reward any steps into work, financial independence
and self-reliance.
2 It should be about services as well as just a cash hand-out; about
childcare as well as child benefit; care for the elderly as well as the
retirement pension, retraining as well as unemployment benefit.
3 It should enhance the family and protect children. ''The family is
the essential unit on which strong communities are based.''
4 It should not be dogmatic about the territory between public and
private sector action. ''Especially in the case of pensions there will
be need to combine the two.''
5 It should promote personal responsibility and deter fraud.
6 It must tackle emerging problems, ''notably the way that people see
their life savings eaten up in nursing care at the end of their lives''.
The Labour leader said he was not setting out a blueprint. ''There
will be hard choices,'' he said, ''and I am all too aware that
Opposition can be an easier place to confront them than Government. But
we need more than just a new policy: we need a new framework.''
Labour will announce plans to develop the Information Superhighway on
Monday which, said Mr Blair, if properly organised could turn Britain
into the electronic workshop of the world.
The Conservatives would leave this to the market but Labour believed
that the wide ranging use of new technologies which it offers will
transform Britain's society and economy.
Mr Blair confessed that signs of complacency in his party about
winning the next election terrified him.
But he claimed that Labour had become again ''the party of the
people'', what it used to be ''before the aberration of parts of the
seventies and eighties.''

FOUR people, including a woman pushing her grandchild in a buggy, were
killed yesterday when a van mounted a pavement and ploughed into
pedestrians. The two-year-old boy survived.
The driver and a couple who were walking their dog also died.
It is believed the driver had a heart attack and lost control of the
vehicle on the A56 at Reedley, Burnley, Lancashire.
Grandmother Ivy Waddington, 66, of Crabtree Street in Brierfield
nearby, and the other women pedestrian, who was aged about 50, were
killed instantly. The man, aged about 60, was taken to Burnley General
Hospital, where he later died from multiple injuries. The couple had not
been named last night.
The child, Craig Waddington, whose birthday is tomorrow, was taken to
hospital but was released immediately to be taken home by his parents,
Alan and Julie Waddington, of Bispham Road, Nelson. He suffered shock
and grazing. A police inspector described his escape as ''miraculous''.
The dog was also killed in the accident.
Mrs Waddington, a widow, regularly looked after Craig, who will be
three tomorrow. Her sister Dinah Gregson, 77, said: ''Ivy doted on the
child and they took regular walks on Colne Road.''
Inspector Stuart Boothman, of Colne Police, said the van driver
Kenneth Burton, 60, came from Burton's Florists in Brierfield.
He was driving back toward the shop he ran with his wife, Joyce, when
he apparently collapsed at the wheel.
Markings on the pavement suggested the Mitsubishi van ploughed on for
almost 50 yards after the impact.
Mr Boothman said: ''It is the worst accident I have ever been involved
in.''
He said some of the officers who were first on the scene would be
offeredcounselling.
Mr Boothman added: ''Until we see all the witnesses and get a true
picture, we do not know exactly what happened.'' On Craig's survival, he
said it was a ''remarkable escape. He was only slightly injured, thank
God. It is miraculous.''
The accident happened in residential Colne Road, opposite Reedley
Magistrates Court. An 8ft stone wall separates the pavement from a small
housing development.
Court staff called the emergency services and rushed out to help. They
comforted the crying child.
Magistrates' clerk Peter Harling said: ''People who knew some first
aid went out to help but they were quite distressed for the people
involved.''
A resident among those first at the scene said: ''It was horrific.
There seemed to be someone trapped under the van which had mounted the
pavement and was tilted up against the wall. There was someone's body
lying on the pavement covered up. There was also a dead dog that someone
had covered.''
A small bunch of flowers from a magistrate who had been sitting in the
court marked the scene of the accident. A card read: ''To those who
died, with deepest regret.''
Ms Margaret Proctor, who lives in Colne Road, said she came out of her
house to find the street sealed off and police cars everywhere.
''The emergency services were fantastic. They were here in a flash,''
she said.
''The road is normally very busy during rush-hours but at the time the
accident happened, it would have been fairly quiet.''
Police said although it was a busy road it was not regarded as an
accident blackspot.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke insisted yesterday that the day was getting
nearer when economic recovery would deliver rising living standards,
more secure employment and confidence in family finances for ordinary
people.
He repeated his commitment that the Government would return to its
tax-cutting agenda when it could afford to, and he ruled out short-term
fiscal gimmicks as a means of producing the so-called ''feel-good
factor''.
Mr Clarke, who opened a Commons debate on the economy, was involved in
a series of clashes with Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown over the
Government's economic strategy.
Amid noisy scenes, Mr Brown repeatedly intervened in Mr Clarke's
speech, and the two had a further exchange when Mr Brown rose to reply
to the Chancellor's remarks.
The Shadow Chancellor tried to drive a wedge between Mr Clarke and the
Prime Minister, asking him to confirm a Tory research department brief
that Mr Major had announced his objective was to reduce capital and
inheritance taxes and, if possible, abolish them.
Mr Clarke said this was Mr Major's long-term objective. The Prime
Minister believed it should be possible to get rid of capital gains tax
and inheritance tax as well, but had ''given no sort of commitment about
when we might achieve such an ambitious objective''.
Mr Brown told the Chancellor it was ''very revealing that the Prime
Minister is announcing your decisions in advance of you''.
The clashes continued, as Mr Brown insisted that the Government was
not pursuing the right policies to stimulate manufacturing industry and
to address the underlying problems of the economy.
The Chancellor accused Mr Brown of talking ''vacuous rubbish'' and
said the decisions the Government had taken now were beginning to
deliver real benefits to more and more people and living standards were
forecast to grow this year by an average of #5 per week.
On tax cuts, he pledged: ''When we can afford it and the economic
conditions are right we will return to our tax-cutting agenda.''
For the liberal Democrats, Mr Malcolm Bruce explained his party's
belief that anyone earning over #100,000 a year should face a 50% top
tax rate, but the money raised from it should immediately be used to
help those at the other end of the scale.
The Government defeated a Labour amendment attacking its economic
record with a majority of 67. Voting was 300 to 233.

A GRIEVING mother has spoken of her anger as her son's killer was
allowed out of prison to marry.
Stephen Moffatt, 30, who is serving a life sentence in Glenochil jail
after stabbing Mr Graeme Thomson, 23, to death in Victoria's nightclub
in Glasgow, yesterday married Miss Angela Bryce, 23, in Alloa Register
Office.
The victim's mother, Mrs Lilly Thomson, 43, criticised prison
authorities for allowing the marriage to go ahead, adding: ''I wish
Moffatt the worst of luck. I thought people were sent to prison as a
punishment.''
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said inmates were entitled to
marry at a register office of their choice.
Moffatt and his brother Alan, 24, were sentenced to life imprisonment
last year at the High Court in Glasgow.

YESTERDAY's men and women assembled, frail ghosts from the headlines
of the sixties, to join today's and tomorrow's men and women for Harold
Wilson's memorial service in Westminster Abbey.
Delivering the address, Lord Callaghan, who succeeded him as Prime
Minister nearly 20 years ago, described Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, who
died on May 24, aged 79, after a long illness, as a master tactician,
whose 1975 referendum on Europe, which cemented Britain into the
European Community, had been a triumph of party management.
''Some pour scorn on such black arts but there is nothing wrong with
party management -- it is how well you do it that matters,'' he added.
The irony was not lost upon the present Prime Minister, John Major,
who read one of the lessons, himself no mean practitioner of the art.
The others were read by the Labour leader, Tony Blair, and the Speaker
of the Commons, Betty Boothroyd, who began her career as one of his back
benchers and is also Chancellor of the Open University, one of his
finest creations.
It was a solemn occasion and the abbey was crowded with politicians
who had served in the Wilson Government -- a diminutive, frail but
indomitable Barbara Castle, Shirley Williams as untidy as in her prime,
Roy Jenkins, Ted Short, Denis Healey, Roy Mason, Harold Lever, Merlyn
Rees, Cledwyn Hughes, Tony Benn, and many more.
There were Conservatives who had faced him across the floor of the
Commons -- Lady Thatcher, Sir Edward Heath, Lords Howe, Prior, Pym,
Barber, and Campbell of Croy, a spectral, gaunt figure, the forgotten
Liberal leader, Jeremy Thorpe, and a stately one, Lady Falkender, his
political secretary there as part of the family. And there were today's
politicians from the Cabinet and shadow Cabinets paying tribute to a
great parliament man.
But it was also a joyous occasion and Lord Callaghan hit the perfect
note with a gracious eulogy in which he described his predecessor as the
most successful leader of the Labour Party ever, winning four elections
out of five.
''He was combative when necessary,'' he said. ''Sometimes I have seen
him stir things up deliberately if he thought they were getting too
quiet.''
Lord Callaghan said he had also been a conciliator, a humanitarian
whose first thought was for the weak and most needy, the least assuming
of men whether in office or out, a gritty Yorkshireman, ready to fight
and unimpressed by wealth or status.
He also recalled the Wilson wit. On one visit to Moscow, they had gone
to the Bolshoi to attend the opera and been installed in the imperial
box with the Soviet leaders, Wilson centre stage, Callaghan in a corner
seat. During the interval, he asked Wilson what it was like sitting in
the Tsar's seat? ''I'm comfortable, what is it like sitting in
Rasputin's seat?'' came the reply.
The Prince of Wales represented the Queen, Lord Longford the Duke of
Edinburgh, and Ex-King Constantine of the Hellenes attended in person,
while the service was conducted by the Dean, the Very Reverend Michael
Mayne, and the blessing given by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most
Reverend and Right Honourable Dr George Carey.
However, it was not the presence of the great and the good, of the
clerics in their embroidered gowns, or the sight of the gold crosses
swaying in procession, the chandeliers glittering palely in the sunlight
which filtered gently in through the stained glass windows, which lent
the occasion its real distinction.
This was also a family celebration and his 20-year-old twin
grand-daughters, Jennifer and Catherine, provided one of the most moving
moments when they sang a sixteenth century anthem, ''In heaven the souls
of the saints rejoice, who followed the footsteps of Christ.''
Afterwards, Lord Attenborough read a poem, Sunset, written by Mary
Wilson.
Dear lost companions, do not forget me now that my face is turned to
the West,
I see your faces, lit by the sunset, friends of my childhood, dearest
and best,
So when I step down into the river and feel your hands outstretched to
take mine,
I shall cry, 'Listen, I hear the trumpets! I see the towers -- look
how they shine.'

POLICE yesterday warned children not to play in dangerous areas such
as rockfaces after a 15-year-old boy fell from the cliffs of Dumbarton
Castle and died later in hospital.
William Bailley, of Greenhead Gardens, Dumbarton, suffered serious
head injuries when he plunged 25ft from a ledge and landed on rocks on
Tuesday night.
He had been playing with a group of friends on the castle rocks when
the accident happened. He was given emergency treatment by two doctors
who had been climbing nearby.
He was taken to Vale of Leven Hospital, Alexandria, and later
transferred to Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, where he died early
yesterday. A report has been submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
Inspector Roger Morrison of Strathclyde Police in Dumbarton said
yesterday: ''There is a warning in this tragic accident for other
children not to play at dangerous areas such as rockfaces, building
sites, and school roofs.''
* A five-year-old boy was said to be in a ''very serious'' condition
in hospital yesterday after he fell from the first-floor balcony at his
home in Shapinsay Street, Milton, Glasgow.
Graeme Robertson, who had been playing with friends at the time of the
accident on Tuesday, was taken to Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow, before
being transferred to Southern General Hospital.

A SURVEY of North-east oil and gas-related firms has shown increased
business confidence in the industry.
The findings are included in the first quarterly survey of companies
in Grampian region, carried out by Strathclyde University's Fraser of
Allander Institute and Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce.
Thirty-eight companies which employ around 12,500 people were asked a
detailed series of questions on company performance and market hopes.
Mr Cliff Lockyer, of The Fraser of Allander Institute, said he hoped
the survey would help monitor changes in the industry.
''We have been analysing reports from the major firms in the area. Our
study will be carried out quarterly and will help monitor trends in the
market. The first study showed that there seems to be more confidence in
the industry compared to last year.''
Despite the positive results, Mr Lockyer said there were still
concerns for the industry. Among the main points to be addressed would
be how well the oil and gas firms could break into the world market.
The survey revealed there were widespread difficulties in the
recruitment of suitable managerial, technical, and skilled manual staff.
Almost a third of the companies surveyed believed the problem had
increased over the last three months.
Exploration work was on the increase and there were increased levels
of production and service-related work. There were also rising levels of
Scottish and overseas-based work. Employment and overtime levels are
expected to rise over the next six months.
Around a third of the companies spoken to reported increased business
confidence in the last three months, and two-thirds reported being more
optimistic than a year ago.
Details of the oil and gas survey came as the latest national
quarterly Scottish Chambers' Business Survey, carried out in conjuction
with the institute, was released.
One of the main concerns nationally was a fall in confidence in the
construction industry, with new construction orders showing a sharp
fall.
However, orders and sales rose in manufacturing and wholesaling, while
tourism and leisure demand also continued on an upward trend.
Stocks of finished goods and raw materials in manufacturing continue
to be run down, while manufacturing work in progress continues to rise.
Investment intentions remained favourable in retailing, wholesaling,
and manufacturing for plant and machinery. Average pay increases ranged
from 3.3% in finance to 3.7% in manufacturing and wholesale
distribution.

A LABOUR MP has stepped in to the row over claims by a sex offender in
Peterhead prison that his requests for help were rejected by social
workers.
Mr Brian Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, has written to the Scottish
Office over claims that social workers are selective about which
prisoners are chosen for counselling before release.
Mr Wilson said a prisoner, Gordon Morning, had written to him alleging
he had been refused help, in spite of his belief that he is likely to
re-offend.
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said any such allegations would be
investigated. Grampian Regional Council's social work department denied
the claims.
Mr Wilson's concerns follow earlier questions surrounding requests for
help from sex offender Edward Mullen shortly before his early release
from Peterhead prison.
Six months after his release, Mullen murdered Ayrshire woman, Mrs
Yvette Wilson, 27, in a bothy in West Kilbride railway station. He was
jailed for life in May.
Mr Wilson said Mullen had requested help but had moved to Strathclyde.
The MP wanted to know if Grampian Regional Council's social work
department had passed on the request.
However, Mr Archie Robb, Grampian's director of social work, said
Mullen had been seen twice by social workers and the information that he
was living in Strathclyde had been passed on.
Mr Robb also said Morning had been offered assistance but had not
completed the programme.

A MOTHER has called for an investigation into a Highland children's
home after her 14- year-old son got drunk and had a sexual encounter
with a teenage girl in her bedroom.
The boy was acquitted by a majority not proven verdict at Inverness
High Court yesterday of raping the girl and forcing her to have oral sex
with him.
The boy had admitted in a police interview that he had sex with the
girl.
After the trial, his mother demanded an inquiry into the security of
the Coul Park children's home in Alness, Easter Ross, where her son had
been staying at the time.
She also castigated the authorities for having her son held for eight
days in Porterfield Prison pending trial. Highland Regional Council's
social work department couldn't find a secure place to hold the boy
until his trial.
Eventually, a place was found for him in an Angus children's home. He
has now been sent to another home in the Highlands.
After the jury's verdict, the mother said: ''Obviously, I am relieved
that he has been cleared of rape, although I am very unhappy that a boy
of his age should be having sex, particularly in a children's home where
he was in care and supposedly under supervision.''
The mother also criticised the lack of appropriate facilities to
accommodate children who are awaiting trial.
She went on: ''Something better should be found for children in this
predicament. Fortunately, my son wasn't mixing with other prisoners,
although he was put in a cell.''
The boy admitted smuggling alcohol into the home after getting someone
to buy it from an Alness off-licence.
He said: ''I got a bottle of Buckfast and bottle of cider and drank it
before going to the girl's room for sex. The rooms are normally checked
at least four times a day but on this occasion, they only checked
twice.''
The trial heard the girl claim she was not willing to have sex or oral
sex with the boy, claiming she was forced by him.
However, police surgeon Dr Anne Griffiths told the trial that a
medical examination revealed only a slight injury of the genital area
which did not necessarily indicate force.
The trial also heard from another boy at the home that the same girl
had made an untrue allegation of sexual harassment against him after the
alleged rape incident.
A Highland Regional Council spokesman admitted the children's home
could be powerless to stop a repeat of incidents of this kind.
He explained: ''It is a children's centre, not a prison, and operates
an open regime. The staff do not have the right to stop and search any
of the children in the home.
''Therefore, the staff can't do anything to stop anyone determined to
smuggle in alcohol.''

Belfast, Dublin
THE fragile Northern Ireland peace process held yesterday during a
long, hot day of marches and sporadic violence in Belfast.
However, there were warnings from Sinn Fein and sharp criticism by the
Irish Government after the RUC decided to force a way through a Roman
Catholic district in Belfast for an Orange Order parade.
Stones and bottles were thrown at Orangemen marching through the
Catholic area of Lower Ormeau. Local community leader, Mr Gerard Rice,
claimed 10 local people had to receive hospital treatment after
incidents involving riot police.
An Irish Government spokesman confirmed that an official protest would
be made to the British authorities today through the intergovernmental
secretariat in Belfast.
In the western and northern areas of the city, nationalist supporters
hijacked and burned a number of cars and vans, prompting one bus company
to withdraw its service to the Falls Road.
Strains in diplomatic relations between London and Dublin, however,
are relatively light when compared with the enormous relief on both
sides of the Irish Sea that the height of the marching season has passed
without any major threat to the peace process.
Overall, the Twelfth passed calmly, as more than 100,000 Orangemen
took to the streets to mark the 305th anniversary of the Battle of the
Boyne.
In what had been the first serious test of the ceasefire, extreme
pressure has been put on the area in the last week.
A two-day seige at Portadown, 20 miles from Belfast, ended on Tuesday
with a compromise deal allowing Orangemen to march silently along the
nationalist Gerveaghy Road as they have done for the past century.
Yesterday, marchers avoided the sensitive nationalist areas of the
town.
The Orangemen's main rally was staged on the outskirts of Belfast.
Generally, events were free from major disturbances.
However, following the incidents in Lower Ormeau, Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams sounded a clear warning about the future of the peace
initiative.
''It was the rhetoric of no surrender, no change,'' he said.
''Everyone knows that to have peace, there has to be change. The
Orangemen have a right to march but not in areas where they are not
wanted.''
Mr Adams also directed fresh criticism at British policy on the bid
for a permanent peace, singling out demands for a decommissioning of IRA
arms and apparent official reluctance to act on the issue of
paramilitary prisoners.
He accused the Government of using the decommissioning row as a
''tactical stance'' to slow the peace process.
''If the British cannot be persuaded to change their minds, then I
think we are starting to go down the slippery slope from whence we
came,'' he warned.
He said a vacuum had been created and responsibility had to be laid at
the door of Mr John Major.
His words were expected to be studied hard in British and Irish
Government circles.
The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party attacked Mr Adams's
threat of a return to violence as a ''blatant act of blackmail by a man
who realises that his only negotiating strength is being demanded from
him''.
It also urged the Government to make no concessions to Mr Adams's
demand to hold on to weapons, ''even if it means an end to this sham of
a ceasefire''.
The Irish Government has repeatedly argued that the right of the
Orange Order to march anywhere -- even on the Twelfth -- must be subject
to the principle that parades should not take place where they are not
welcomed.
Although it accepts that the handling of parades is entirely a
policing matter and not subject to political control from the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland, it will go ahead with its protest today
because of fears that insensitive policing could have led to a situation
in which the IRA re-emerged as the defenders of a besieged community.
It will now focus on convincing Mr Major that he needs to make a
gesture to the nationalist community.
According to Government sources in Dublin, this could be done by
announcing the release of some Republican prisoners along with a
decision to transfer others from the mainland to jails in Northern
Ireland.
Irish Ministers have been waiting for more than a week for London to
make a gesture towards jailed para-military personnel after the freeing
of convicted murderer, paratrooper Lee Clegg.
His release sparked the most serious Belfast rioting since the IRA and
Loyalist terror groups declared their ceasefire more than 10 months ago.

Residents vent their anger as the Walk comes to town. Ron MacKenna
examines a community under curfew
MARCHING day began early for the Catholic residents of the Lower
Ormeau area in Belfast yesterday.
At dawn, as loyalist bonfires marking the Twelfth blazed across the
city, hundreds of RUC officers moved in, sealing off streets leading to
Ormeau Road and leaving residents prisoners in their own homes.
Just hours before, the tiny nationalist enclave became the front line
of the Province's troubles as talks aimed at securing a peaceful
progress for Orange marchers broke down.
With no agreement between the two sides, the RUC took the decision to
force a way through the community for the Orange Walk.
It didn't take long for the residents to make their presence known.
Shortly after six o'clock, a small number attempted to sit down on the
road but were moved by police. Residents later claimed some of their
number had been baton-charged and injured.
Two hours later, around 250 locals were corralled in a small open area
to the rear of their houses. Police officers, armed with batons and
backed by a solid line of Land-Rovers, ensured a 100-yard gap between
the Catholic community and the bridge the Orangemen would walk across.
The RUC had also herded the media behind barriers across the road to
ensure they made no contact with residents. Residents' spokesman, Mr
Gerard Rice, broke through the cordon and approached journalists
pleading for a camera crew to be sent in to the nationalist section.
Under extreme pressure from the media, the RUC allowed two camera
crews and a photographer into the Catholic section and allowed the rest
of the press access to Ormeau Road where the march would take place.
Shortly after 9.30am, the Orange parade came towards the flashpoint
area led by members of the Ballynafeigh Orange Order. Around 150
Orangemen were led by four bands, two from Scotland.
As they approached Ormeau Bridge, playing The Sash, they were cheered
by onlookers but trouble flared when they reached the other side. A
number of youths hurled bottles across the blockade and into the parade.
Nobody was injured and, apart from a small number of Orangemen
temporarily leaving the march, the procession continued.
After it passed, residents were not allowed on to the main street by
the RUC. A large number collected in a stand-off with riot police on
Cooke Street. Tempers flared again as police attempted to move one
family from their doorway.
Eventually, the protesters were allowed to go a hundred yards into the
main street before being stopped again. A sit-down protest then took
place for the rest of the afternoon.
Both sides thought they had reached agreement on the march the night
before. However, on closer examination of the small print, it was felt
to be unacceptable.
Local parish priest, Father Anthony Curran, of St Malachy's, was
involved in the discussions. He said: ''The community agreed to accept
today's parade and one in August in return for the undertaking that no
parades would take place in the future without the consent of the people
in the area.''
He said the agreement in Portadown, which ended a two-day stand-off,
had damaged the chances of a settlement for Ormeau Road. He added that,
because of murders three years ago when five local men were killed in a
bookmaker's shop on Ormeau Road, feelings still ran extremely high in
the area.
''It is unacceptable for these people to accept the triumphalism and
insults so soon after the murders. That really made the situation
untenable this morning,'' he said.
Sinn Fein's South Belfast representative, Mr Sean Hayes, said it was
outrageous that people had been penned in all day and stopped from going
to work or leaving the area.
''We are seeing an example of the British Government's attitude to the
peace process,'' said Mr Hayes. ''The Orangemen come into the community
and march through. But we are not prepared to go down on our knees.''
A RUC spokesman said the decision to send in officers was taken for
operational reasons.
He had no comment to make on claims of injuries and added he had no
information as to how people were removed from the street. The decision
to allow the march to go ahead had been taken by senior officers.

A HOLIDAY company, which sued an 84-year-old widow after she cancelled
a cruise when her husband died, has settled the case out of court.
American Mrs Frances Stout was being asked to pay #8000 for the trip
around the Hebridean Islands.
Speaking yesterday from her home in Hartford, Connecticut, she said
she could not believe Hebridean Islands Cruises Ltd, of Acorn Park,
Keighley Road, Skipton, North Yorkshire, had threatened to take her to
court.
She cancelled the June 1994 holiday when her husband, John, 84, died
from a heart attack.
Mrs Stout had already paid a 15% deposit but the company told her she
would have to pay the remainder as the couple had not taken out
cancellation insurance.
When Mrs Stout refused to pay, the company started court proceedings
against her and travel agents, Singer Travel, of Hartford, Connecticut.
At the Central London County Court, Judge White accepted the case had
now been settled against Mrs Stout. The action against Singer Travel has
been adjourned because the firm claims it is out of English
jurisdiction.
After the hearing yesterday, a spokesman for Hebridean Island Cruises
refused to comment on the amount of the settlement.
He said: ''The company regrets it was necessary to bring these
proceedings to recover the cancellation charges . . .When confirming the
booking in this particular case, the company reminded Mr and Mrs Stout's
agents of the need to effect cancellation insurance.''

THE Scottish Junior Football Association last night dismissed an
appeal by Shotts Bon Accord against their indefinite expulsion from
their league.
The Lanarkshire club, managed by Lisbon Lion John Clark and one of the
best-known sides in the junior game, were banned by Central League last
month after a dispute which has lasted more than six months and cost
thousands of pounds in legal fees.
The club, who have twice gone to the Court of Session to overturn
decisions by the Central League committee, put their case last night to
a special meeting of the SJFA in Glasgow.
However, SJFA secretary Joe Black said the appeal by Shotts had been
unsuccessful and that they had upheld the decision taken on June 28 to
suspend the club.
Mr Black said: ''It was the view of the committee that this matter
could have been resolved at a much earlier stage if Shotts had availed
themselves of the procedures within the framework of football
legislation.
''We considered the sentence imposed was proper. However, it does
provide flexibility on the period of time the club was expelled. When
litigation is concluded it would be in the best interests of football
for both parties to come together and bring to a conclusion this
regrettable episode.''
Mr Black said Shotts had the right of appeal to the Scottish Football
Association.
The club's assistant secretary and solicitor, Mr James Muir, refused
to comment on the outcome of the meeting and would say only that Shotts
were considering their position.
The dispute began on Hogmanay last year when Shotts pulled out of a
cup-tie after claiming eight of their players were unable to play
because they had flu.
Two months later, the club were fined #500 and ejected from the cup
after Central League officials said there was ''conflicting evidence''
over the validity of the players' medical certificates.
Shotts then successfully applied for an interim interdict to prevent
their cup opponents taking part in the next round, a move which forced
the scrapping of the cup competition, and led to a charge that Shotts
had breached the league's constitution by resorting to the courts
without exhausting internal league procedures.
Last month, their fellow clubs voted 26-11 to impose the suspension,
rejecting an alternative proposal to levy a big fine.

RAIL investigators yesterday removed the damaged train which had
crashed through buffers at Largs station on Tuesday, crossed a platform
and demolished a row of shops, injuring five people.
Immediately after the crash, rail officials speculated that the brakes
on the early morning Glasgow to Largs train might have failed just as it
entered the seaside town's station at 7.20am.
About 12 passengers were on board the six-carriage train when it
ploughed through buffers at 20mph, finally coming to a halt having
destroyed a clothes shop, yards from the town's main shopping street.
Three people were treated for shock after the accident. Last night,
the train driver, Mr David Robertson, 30, and guard, Mr James Tarres,
28, were still being detained in Inverclyde Hospital for observation.
Mr Robertson, from Grangemouth, had to be cut free from the crushed
first carriage of the train and was being treated for head and neck
injuries. Mr Tarres, from Glasgow, was being treated for abdominal
injuries after attempting to warn passengers of the impending smash
moments before the train hit the buffers.
A team of investigators from ScotRail, Railtrack, and an independent
company, Derby-based Engineering Link, is expected to take several weeks
to discover why the accident happened and if brake failure was to blame.
Police and firefighters at the scene of the crash said it was a miracle
no-one had been killed. An hour later, Largs station is normally busy
with Glasgow commuters.
A Railtrack spokesman said the shattered glass roof of the
100-year-old station would have to be demolished and the ticket office,
clipped by the train, would have to be rebuilt. The damaged shops,
although adjoining the station building, were sold off by British Rail
eight years ago.

A 15-year-old boy's reign of terror in the South Side of Glasgow ended
yesterday when he was found guilty of raping the same woman twice and
attacking four others.
After the jury returned its verdict at the High Court in Glasgow, the
judge, Lord McCluskey, said all that remained for him was to decide
whether to order the teenager to be detained for a fixed number of years
or to give him an indeterminate sentence.
Lord McCluskey called for a detailed profile of the youth, by
psychiatrists or psychologists, to help him make his decision. The case
was adjourned until today for the judge to be given advice on who should
carry out the study.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of
raping the same woman twice and assaulting four other women with intent
to rape them.
During the five-day trial, the court heard how the stockily-built
skinhead waged a campaign of terror against women in Govanhill last
year.
All the attacks took place at night, two on July 2 and three on
December 2.
Each of the victims was a young woman walking home alone. They were
dragged, some by the hair, into tenement closes which were all in the
same area.
The 5ft 9in boy punched and kicked some of the women about the face
and head and returned seconds later to give them another battering as
they lay on the ground. In one of the attacks, he screamed ''bitch'' as
he lashed out.
He told the rape victim, a 31-year-old secretary, he was going to have
sex with her and kill her afterwards. She was terrified into submission,
believing he had a knife.
She was raped in the close then dragged by the hair, barefoot and
bleeding, through back courts to be raped again.
In his bid to dominate her, he claimed he had been in prison for two
murders and was respected by other inmates.
He asked her: ''Do you respect me?''
She could only whisper: ''Yes.''
Her ordeal continued as he dragged her through more back courts,
saying he was taking her to his flat. Even when help came to hand, he
still tried to drag his victim away.
She went limp and he was forced to drop her. However, after running a
few yards away, he returned to kick her twice on the head.
Later the same night, December 2, he pounced on two other victims,
assaulting a 35-year-old social worker in her close and then trying to
drag an 18-year-old schoolgirl into a close.
On December 14, a 15-year-old girl came home in terror after being
twice followed by the youth. She told her stepfather, who phoned the
police after seeing him go into a lane. Two officers used their patrol
car's headlamps to illuminate the lane and seconds later the suspect
emerged from a bush and was taken into custody.
Investigating officers were surprised by the boy's age. They and the
victims had thought the prowler was a young man in his twenties.
Before them stood a young man who was 15, a resident of a nearby
childrens' home.
Inquiries linked him to two other violent sex attacks in the same area
six months before.
The teenager's defence counsel, Mr Donald Findlay, QC, yesterday told
the court the rape was one of the worst he had ever encountered. He
spoke of his client's ''deep-seated aggressive attitude towards women''
and the level of violence involved in the attacks.
He said: ''At 15, he is to be regarded as someone with a very
significant problem and plainly a danger to the public and to women in
particular.''
Mr Findlay added: ''Custody will protect the public but I cannot
accept that we can turn our backs on a boy of 15 and throw the key away.
We have a duty to the victims but we also have a duty to him.
''When you have a child as seriously disturbed as this young man is,
if all the legal system can do is to lock him up, then I don't think I
want to be a part of it any more.''
However, experts believe the boy could have become a killer if he had
not been caught. They admit that the explanation for his deep hatred of
women will only become known if he opens up to psychiatrists.
The youth's parents separated when he was four. For years, he was
shunted from pillar to post, sometimes living with his mother, sometimes
with his father.
He had an anti-authoritarian attitude and was put into care in a
residential home at the age of 13.
He had been a bully when he attended ordinary schools and he remained
a bully in the residential home, terrifying other children.
When he appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court, a furore broke out after he
was allowed bail. He went straight back to the home instead of being
remanded to a List D school with a secure unit.
After several appeals and counter appeals, the Crown failed in its bid
to have him locked up in a secure unit and he was bailed into the
custody of a non-secure list D school.
After yesterday's verdict, the boy was taken to a secure unit.
He will undoubtedly receive a long sentence, whether determinate or
indeterminate, and will stay there till his 16th birthday on October 2.
He will then be transferred to a young offenders' institution until he
is 21, when he will go to a prison.
Yesterday, a leading Scots forensic psychiatrist said: ''This young
man obviously hated women and loved to deliver a package showing them he
was all-powerful and could dominate them with terror.
''What made him hate women is anyone's guess. It could have been a
problem with his mother or some other female but we will only know if he
opens up to psychiatrists.
''It is as well he was caught because the severity of his crimes was
escalating. He would have gone on to commit more and more and eventually
one of his victims could have died. In cases like this, you often wonder
how many more offences were committed which haven't come to light.
''The only positive thing we can say about this case is that, with the
passage of time and under a sex offender treatment programme while he is
in custody, there is a potential for him to cool down.''

THE first main sailing ship glided into Leith for the Tall Ships Race
yesterday, and a fish fiasco.
The Russian four-masted barque Kruzenshtern arrived amid reports that
the galley had run short of food.
According to one, the 60 crew and 150 cadets were kept going on the
way up the east coast only by English food parcels.
Edinburgh businessman Alan West, of Harry Ramsden's, stepped in with
an offer of two fish suppers per head for the ship's company during
their stay in Leith.
He brought four platefuls. A case of McEwan's Tall Ships Ale was also
produced for Captain Gennadiy Kolomenskiy.
Mr West managed to negotiate his way aboard along with a TV camera
crew and two token fish suppers.
However, after an hour aboard ship, Mr West left, saying: ''They
appear to be going to have a committee meeting to decide whether to take
my offer up or not.
''They knew about the reports about them needing food but strongly
denied them and were rather angry about the impression they created.''
''I got the impression that they didn't want fish today but that they
would gladly have taken potatoes and veg. All I can say is that the
offer is still open and that it's up to them.''
McEwan's distributed its product to the onlookers.
One English sailor, who joined the ship at Falmouth, said: ''We've had
four square meals a day. Everyone has been well fed but they did welcome
fresh supplies donated to them in England.''
The 377ft vessel is owned by the Russian Fisheries Board.
* Visitors to the Tall Ships event this weekend will be able to view
another form of transport, a mock-up of a new tram which a consortium
hopes may be running in Edinburgh in future. Rail company Tickford, part
of the Babcock International group which would build them at Rosyth
Dockyard as part of its diversification work, will put it on display.

SCOTS artist Callum Innes has been nominated for the #20,000 Tate
Turner Prize, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Innes also made it on to the shortlist for the #30,000 Jerwood
Prize two weeks ago, giving him the possibility of winning Britain's top
two art awards and a total of #50,000.
Mr Innes, known for his rigorously abstract oils, was born in
Edinburgh in 1962 and trained at Grays School of Art in Aberdeen from
1980 to 1984, where he gained a first class honours degree. He went on
to complete a post-graduate diploma at Edinburgh College of Art.
For the last three years, he has taught one day a week at Glasgow
School of Art.
From 1985, he has made his living as a full-time painter, exhibiting
from Los Angeles to Vienna. This year alone, he has had shows in Paris,
Stuttgart, Amsterdam, Nottingham, Zurich, and Dusseldorf. Ironically, he
is better known abroad than at home.
''I'm very surprised to be nominated,'' he told me from his Edinburgh
studio. ''I wasn't expecting anything at all. I've not been exhibiting
so much in the UK but this gives me a great opportunity for my work to
be seen in London and Edinburgh. That's the nice thing. And it's
terrific to be able to do a show at the Tate Gallery.''
The Jerwood Prize, which is restricted to painters but has no age
limit, will be launched at the Royal Scottish Academy, during the
Edinburgh Festival, before going to London.
Last year, a London-based Scot, Craigie Aitchison, now 70, was the
winner. This year's list also includes Maggie Hameling and Patrick
Caulfield.
Work by the four short-listed artists, Innes, Mona Hatoum, Mark
Wallinger, and the controversial ''shark'' artist, Damien Hirst, will be
on exhibition at London's Tate from November 1, with the #20,000 winner
announced at a dinner televised live by Channel 4 on November 28.
The Turner Prize is awarded to a UK artist under 50 for ''an
outstanding exhibition or presentation in the past 12 months''.
The Tate is collaborating with galleries outside London to stimulate
wider discussion on contemporary art and the Turner Prize. One is
Glasgow's CCA in Sauchiehall Street which will show a video of the
shortlisted artists and organise a public seminar in November.
Mr Innes's early work belonged to the typically Scottish figurative
style but after a stay in Amsterdam in 1988 his painting became
completely abstract.
He achieves his effects by subtraction, removing some paint with
turpentine so that gently stained canvas sits alongside dense monochrome
areas of oil paint. His work has explored a narrow range of
monochromatic brown, green, cream, and ochre but a recent move to a new
studio has sparked off intense reds, yellows, and purples.

THE much-heralded summer of discontent will begin at midnight tonight
after train drivers yesterday confirmed their intention to launch a
series of six 24-hour stoppages.
Their decision means that Scottish rail services will be crippled over
the weekend, at a time when many people will be leaving on holiday at
the start of the Glasgow Fair fortnight.
ScotRail director John Ellis said all services would be cancelled
tomorrow and no sleeper trains would run tonight. Further action by
members of Aslef is planned for Tuesday.
Mr Ellis expressed disappointment at the union's decision, which he
said would cost ScotRail around #400,000 a day in lost revenue.
Bus and plane operators expect a financial windfall from the thousands
of travellers who will have to switch their plans off the railways.
Yesterday's decision by the drivers followed the collapse of three
days of negotiations between BR and Aslef, whose executive demanded an
improvement on a ''final'' 3% pay offer.
Union general secretary Lew Adams said he expected virtually all BR
passenger services would be at a standstill, although Eurostar services
through the Channel Tunnel should not be affected.
Mr Adams said he deeply regretted inconveniencing the public. He said
Aslef had tried to reach a negotiated settlement but BR's card had been
marked by the Government and it was not prepared to increase the offer.
BR, which could lose #10m because of tomorrow's strike, condemned the
''intransigence and short-sightedness'' of the union and said it hoped
to persuade some drivers to ignore the strike call.
The company has up to 400 managers qualified to drive trains but they
will not stand in for striking staff tomorrow. After Tuesday, further
stoppages are planned, on July 27, August 8 and 25, and September 12.
Meanwhile, Passport Office Agency staff, including 250 in Glasgow, are
still due to ban overtime and work to rule from Monday, and may strike
later over job fears; and around 20,000 British Airways staff and
650,000 NHS employees are also to be balloted on industrial action.

A new report claims today that closure of the sleeper service on the
West Highland Line could pave the way for the ending of 27 other railway
links across the UK.
The study, commissioned by the London Friends of the West Highland
Line, suggests that British Rail has significantly exaggerated the
''uneconomic'' annual operating losses of the sleeper, by citing a
figure of #2.3m instead of the #1m maximum calculated by several
independent economists.
If the lower sum is accurate, says the report, then 27 other lines
which receive a similar or larger subsidy will be vulnerable to closure.
Friends' chairman, Mr Hugh Raven, said the new research made the West
Highland Line a critical test case which could determine the future of
other services covering almost 1500 miles of track, including four lines
in Scotland.
The group's research was conducted by Mr Don Box, a former senior
manager with BR. It concludes that the financial assessments by BR and
the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) underestimated revenue
and overestimated costs on the West Highland Line.

A LEADING building company, which carried out work on the Queen's
Balmoral estate, has gone into receivership.
Receivers from Coopers and Lybrand were involved yesterday in talks
with Aberdeen-based Span Construction executives.
The company, with 150 employees, was appointed a Royal warrant holder
to the Queen in 1991. Many of the staff are on holiday as part of
Aberdeen's annual trades fortnight.
It is understood efforts had been made recently to sell the business
as a going concern but these had failed.
The much-acclaimed restoration of historic Duff House, which was
opened by Prince Charles two weeks ago, was one of Span's high-profile
contracts.
Last November, the company, led by chairman Stuart Tawse, claimed it
was one of Scotland's fastest-growing building firms with a #30m
turnover.

OPINION
GEORGE Graham's fall from grace continued last night and the former
Arsenal manager will know the extent of his punishment within the next
48 hours.
He may be fined and banned, or even both and if he is banished from
the game no one should feel sorry for him. George Graham abused his
position at the top of a sport which has become swamped with allegations
of corruption. It is time to curb the growing tendency towards
outrageous greed.
A plea for leniency was lodged by Graham's legal team, but the
association, indeed all football supporters, should be asking if the
50-year old deserves to be given a punishment which could leave the door
open to his return to the game at some point in the future. Transfer
fees are spiralling to ridiculous heights and season tickets are also
going up.
Many are doing well, but they are not supporters, the very lifeblood
of the game. When will they be given what they deserve? When are they to
be shown the respect and the honesty they deserve?
English football stumbled from one sleaze crisis to another last
season leaving the fans bewildered. The money earned by the major
personalities in the sport is almost beyond the fans' comprehension and
yet they hear of people like Graham, who was one of the highest-paid
managers in the business, accepting more.
If only for the sake of the people with the scarves, the decent folk
who have a genuine passion for the game, the three-man FA hearing must
tell Graham he is no longer welcome. Arsenbal sacked him in February
after the original inquiry into the affair and now the game must do the
same.
He should be banished just as Don Revie was in 1977. Decency must be
restored in the football world.
If Graham wishes to continue the quest to clear his name then he would
have to take his case to a higher authority outside the game, but
perhaps he should accept his punishment with the dignity which character
witnesses would insist is one of his hallmarks.
The FA commission spent 18 hours listening to the case for and against
and then decided Graham must have known the money he received from
Norwegian agent Rune Hauge stemmed from the signings of Pal Lydersen and
John Jensen more than three years ago. However, they did accept Graham
did not negotiate the deals for personal gain.
Fine, but so far as the fans and the outside world are concerned
Graham took more money out of the game than he deserved. He may talk of
unsolicited gifts, but he accepted the money.
Yes, he was Arsenal's most successful manager since Herbert Chapman,
but when he handled #425,500 in transfer ''gifts'' the man who grew up
in the tough school of Bargeddie failed his club and he failed the
Gunners' supporters miserably.
If, for these reasons, he has no place at Highbury then he has no
place in the game.

BANKER Nick Leeson yesterday pleaded for help to go on trial in
Britain over the collapse of Britain's oldest bank.
The 28-year-old derivatives trader, who is being held in Germany in
the wake of the #890m crash of merchant bank Barings, made his appeal in
a letter written in his cell at Hoechst prison in Frankfurt.
Leeson, who was speaking out for the first time since being detained
at Frankfurt airport six months ago, is fighting for the right to a
British trial and to be near his family.
His letter was read to a London news conference by his wife Lisa, who
was overcome as she read the emotional plea.
The trader worked in Singapore as a trader for the bank and officials
there want him extradited to face cheating and forgery charges.
Leeson believes that if he is extradited to Singapore he will be part
of a ''show trial'' which will end with him probably being sent to
prison for 14 years.
His letter said: ''This is the sort of sentence that is reserved for
murderers, terrorists, and such in the UK, and yet the authorities seem
inclined to allow me to face the excessive punishment.
''I did not steal any money, I hope that this is very clear to
everybody. Everything that I did was done in the hope that it would be
for the ultimate benefit of the bank.
''I acted unwisely and exceeded my authority but never with the
intention of improperly enriching myself.
''The biggest crime that I am guilty of is trying to protect people
and ensure that the bonuses that they expected were paid and it is this
that led to the escalation of the problem and the offences of which I
now stand accused.''
He and his British lawyer, Stephen Pollard, have offered the Serious
Fraud Office an interview under caution in Germany, during which Leeson
would give details of who in Barings knew of the extent of the bank's
debts when it crashed. The losses were allegedly caused by Leeson's
dealing in international currency derivative markets.
The collapsed bank was later rescued by Dutch bank ING, which purged
top officials and directors.
In his willingness to help the SFO investigators, Leeson prepared a
''script'' with relevant questions, Mr Pollard said.
The Serious Fraud Office said it had not uncovered any evidence which
showed fraudulent activity by staff of Barings in London.
A spokeswoman had no comment on Leeson's offer to be interviewed by
investigators.
Mr Pollard later suggested the SFO should interview his client. ''The
SFO appears not to want to uncover evidence,'' he said. ''It hasn't
taken up the invitation to interview Mr Leeson.
''Its interpretation of the events leading to the collapse of Barings
is very narrow and ignores the exchange of information between London
and Singapore and the transfer of monies

BORN into a mining family in Bargeddie on the outskirts of Glasgow,
George Graham exudes even in disgrace a style that eludes the vast
majority of his more vulgar rivals.
Not for him the fedora, the thick cigar or chunky gold jewellery. The
former Arsenal manager is football's Burberry Man, the clothing elegance
matched by a bland eloquence which echoes both his playing nicknames --
Stroller and The Peacock.
The Glasgow accent has mellowed until it is as smooth as the malt
whisky he collects. Home is an immaculate bachelor apartment in
Hampstead, while his social life mixes the brightest and the best.
Graham's fierce ambition propelled him into football's top drawer,
with a dozen Scottish caps and league championship medal. However, his
achievements as a player were eclipsed by his success as a manager.
Few knew better than Graham what the Arsenal board were taking away
from him when they sacked him in February at the climax to the Premier
League inquiry into alleged transfer ''bungs''.
Far more than the threat to his lifestyle was the damage to his
standing as Highbury's most successful manager since Herbert Chapman.
Graham began his career with Aston Villa, before moving to Chelsea for
#5950.
The tall, attacking midfielder quickly struck up a rapport with Barry
Bridges which produced 80 goals over two seasons and a Fairs Cup
semi-final defeat by Barcelona.
After 46 goals in 102 games, he moved to Arsenal for #50,000 (plus
Tommy Baldwin) in September 1966.
He joined a declining Manchester United in December 1972 for #120,000
but after they were relegated he moved on to Portsmouth and suffered
relegation again.
He rediscovered success with Crystal Palace, helping them to promotion
from division three in 1977 but then drifted off to play in America with
California Surf and retired in 1980.
His old friend Terry Venables -- they were each other's best man and
godfather to each other's children -- helped him into coaching jobs at
QPR and Palace.
In December 1982, he became manager of Millwall. He took them up to
division two in 1985 but their success was marred by crowd trouble.
A year later, Graham jumped at the chance to move to Highbury with his
assistant Theo Foley. His first year set the pattern, beating Liverpool
2-1 in the League Cup. The following season they lost in the final to
Luton.
The best moment of all came in 1989 at Anfield with Michael Thomas's
late, late goal clinching a dramatic league championship from Liverpool.
Two seasons later, Arsenal won the title again. In 1993, he made it a
hat-trick of domestic titles when Arsenal beat Sheffield Wednesday in
both the League and FA Cup finals. In 1994, he added the European Cup
Winners' Cup to the bulging trophy cabinet.

THE Tories received a big lift last night after the correction of a
statistical error in assessing the mood of the nation after their
leadership election. They are now shown to have almost halved the Labour
lead since last month.
They had been distraught by the Guardian/ICM poll yesterday -- the
first since the leadership election result -- which had given them only
a 1% improvement. Last night, the pollsters announced an error and put
out the true figures.
Labour is now 47%, down six points from 53% last month. The Tories are
up eight points, from 24% to 32%. Liberal Democrats are down two points
from 19% to 17%. Others 3% (4% last month).
The Guardian explained that it was a statistical error by the polling
firm -- but the true figures incline the Tories to think that Mr Major's
gamble has been worthwhile.
The result of the published poll on Tuesday cast them into despair.
After all the massive publicity on the Prime Minister's policies, only a
1% improvement augured trouble for them at their party conference in the
autumn.
In the Commons yesterday, in a head-on debate between Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke and his shadow Gordon Brown, Mr Clarke demanded Labour's
response to what he claimed to be the best economic position achieved by
this country for 30 years.
Mr Brown claimed that new divisions in the Government were appearing
with the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine as First Secretary of State
and Deputy Prime Minister, challenging for the Chancellor's powers of
tax and spending.

GEORGE Graham has been found guilty of misconduct after the
unprecedented three-day Football Association hearing delving into his
alleged #425,500 transfer ''bungs''.
Now the disgraced Arsenal manager faces an anxious 48-hour wait to
learn if he still has a future in the game after the three FA ''judges''
delayed announcing their punishment.
His lawyers have lodged a plea of leniency, but he could become the
first manager since Don Revie, in 1977, to be banished, with the
commission possessing unlimited powers.
The FA insist he must have known the money he received from Norwegian
agent Rune Hauge stemmed from the signings of Pal Lydersen and John
Jensen more than three years ago, though they accept he did not
negotiate the deals for personal gain.
That offers the 50-year-old a lifeline, backed up by a glowing
character reference by Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson -- the chairman of
the League Managers' Association.
But Graham, sacked by the Highbury club when the Premier League
''bungbusters'' published their report of the affair in February, still
slammed the career-threatening outcome, saying: ''I'm bitterly
disappointed with the verdict.
''I always said the payments were unsolicited and this has been
proved. The commission decided that the receipt of the payments
constituted misconduct. That is all I am saying for now.''
The FA, who heard from six witnesses, including Graham, over the three
days at Watford, issued their decision in a statement read by David
Davies, their director of public affairs.
''An FA commission has spent 18 hours over the past three days
considering a charge of misconduct against the former Arsenal manager
George Graham.
''It followed allegations concerning payments Mr Graham admitted
receiving from an agent.
''The charge alleged the payments were connected to the transfers of
two players from Scandanavian clubs to Arsenal in 1991 and 1992. Mr
Graham denied the charge.
''The commission has found the charge of misconduct proved. It was
satisfied that when he received the money, he must have known it was
connected with the transfers.
''It wasn't satisfied that Mr Graham asked for the money, or that he
negotiated the transfers to obtain any personal gain.''
''A plea for leniency was heard. Penalty will be notified to Mr Graham
in writing within 48 hours. Written reasons will follow.''
The verdict was also rubbished by Alan Thorne, the former Millwall
chairman, who gave Graham his first managerial break in 1982.
Thorne gave his protege moral support on the crucial third day that
saw Graham spell out for the first time in detail his version of the
controversy.
Said Thorne: ''I'm shocked and disgusted. It's typical of the FA.
They're worse than the masons and I don't think much of masons.
''George is the most honest man I've ever known in my life and one of
the best managers I've ever known -- for integrity and discipline
there's no-one to touch him.''
Thorne was ready to speak out for Graham until Wilkinson stood up to
be counted alongside him in the converted courtroom: ''Howard had done
so well we didn't want to overdo it with me,'' said Thorne.
Wilkinson, who interrupted more than three hours of evidence from
Graham, including a 90-minute cross-examination by the FA's barrister
Brian Leveson, said: ''I was here to talk about George as a manager and
a coach.''
The Leeds boss was involved in three major transfers -- John Lukic,
David Rocastle, and David O'Leary -- with the ex-Highbury supremo.
However, while he stressed Graham's probity, the commission decided
that, while he may not have committed the transfer irregularity, he did
not turn a hair at profiting from it.
At the heart of the matter were the transfers with IK Start and
Brondby, with both Scandinavian clubs selling Lydersen and Jensen for
considerably less than Arsenal's board of directors agreed to pay.
The difference was refunded to Interclub Ltd, a Guernsey-based company
linked to Hauge, who subsequently made two payments to Graham.
Though he insists they were an unsolicited gift unconnected to the
transfers, he repaid the money to Arsenal in December last year, two
months before the Premier League report which triggered his dismissal.
Their on-going investigations are expected to name further figures
when they report again before the start of the new season.

TAX investigators have searched the homes of German tennis star Steffi
Graf and her father, Peter Graf.
Because of Germany's tax secrecy laws, officials were unable to give
any details of the investigation but it was confirmed that documents
were seized.
Graf, 26, who won the women's Wimbledon title for the sixth time last
Sunday, is reported to have lifetime earnings of close to #50m and is
one of the few major German sports stars not to have moved abroad for
tax purposes.
Germany has some of the highest taxes in Europe, with a top rate on
income of 53%.
Next week, she is due to begin a career in fashion by launching her
own collection in Berlin.
Graf's father has played a major part in her tennis career as a
mentor.Five years ago, Graf's form was hit by her father's extra-marital
affair with a topless model

FORMER Aresenal manager George Graham was yesterday found guilty of
misconduct after the unprecedented three-day Football Association
hearing delving into his alleged #425,500 transfer ''bungs''.
However, a defiant Mr Graham, sacked by the Premiership club when they
published their report of the affair in February, attacked the outcome,
saying: ''I'm bitterly disappointed with the verdict.
''I always said the payments were unsolicited and this has been
proved. The commission decided that the receipt of the payments
constituted misconduct. That is all I am saying for now.''
He now faces an anxious 48-hour wait to learn if he still has a future
in the game after the three FA ''judges'' delayed announcing their
punishment.

LADY Thatcher intervened in the Bosnian crisis yesterday, demanding
that the United Nations should now hand over decision making to Nato in
the worsening situation.
She cut across the wait-and-see policy of the Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind in his statement to the Commons.
The former Prime Minister has always advocated that the Bosnian
Muslims should be re-armed to help them fight the ethnic cleansing of
the Bosnian Serbs.
As Mr Rifkind was reporting to the Commons, Lady Thatcher told the
Lords: ''I have the impression that so long as its operation is
supervised by the United Nations, no-one will ever get hold of it and
take the requisite decisions and action to put it to an end and see that
the victims win and the aggressors are vanquished.''
As Britain and France were seeking yet another UN resolution in New
York, Lady Thatcher asked: ''Would the Government seek, if it's
possible, to put it under Nato who will be much more effective?'' She
went on: ''I am reminded that the right of self defence is much older
than the United Nations. The United Nations didn't invent it and the UN
has no right in effect to make it inoperative.''
She asked again: ''Why are the Bosnians not allowed to arm themselves
with strong enough equipment, and in sufficient munitions to defeat the
Serb aggressor? The Bosnians are the victims. We would not deny them the
fundamental right of self defence. I doubt the legality of doing it. I
have no doubt that it is morally wrong to deny them that right.''
This cuts right across the Government's support of UN arms embargoes
against all the fighting factions in former Yugoslavia.
As a growing number of MPs on all sides in the Commons are wondering
why Britain and France should not be pulling out of the area, Lady
Thatcher ridiculed the concept of safe havens which UN troops cannot
enforce, even with air strikes. ''By calling these areas safe, we have
encouraged people to go into them -- innocent people,'' she said.
''We should therefore make proper provision for their effective
defence. They are not peace-keeping. There is no peace to keep. They are
to enforce UN resolutions. Those powers are not being used.
''We have the weapons. We have the quality. We have the numbers. We
have most excellent armed forces. They are not being used to protect the
innocent.''
Lady Thatcher's intervention called Government policy into question
once again. In the Commons, Mr Rifkind tried to spell out Britain's
determination to see Srebrenica restored as a ''safe area'', despite the
fact that Dutch troops there have been overrun by the Bosnian Serbs.
More than 30,000 refugees are being driven out under appalling
conditions.
Mr Rifkind insisted only that the withdrawal of British troops ''must
remain an option'' while the conflict escalates. The humanitarian good
brought about by UN aid outweighs the dangers and the repeated
humiliations of the UN forces on the ground by the Bosnian Serbs.
Lady Thatcher has clearly given up any hope of a political solution in
former Yugoslavia and demands an end to arms sanctions against the
Bosnian Muslims. Mr Rifkind insists that the Bosnian Serbs ''have to
recognise that negotiating time is running out''.
Before he spoke, the new Foreign Secretary had discussed the crisis
with the Prime Minister, who is still reluctant to concede to the more
aggressive statements coming from Mr Chirac in Paris about the use of
the still deploying Rapid Reaction Force.
In both Lords and Commons yesterday, there was little doubt that the
crunch time is imminent for more than 10,000 British troops on the
ground. A mood to pull them out is growing.
Last night, the United Nations Security Council demanded the immediate
withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces from Srebrenica.
But words from New York had little effect on Bosnian Serb Army
commander, General Ratko Mladic, who drove into the fallen UN ''safe
area'' as a conqueror to oversee the evacuation of its Muslim
population.
European Union peace negotiator Carl Bildt insisted the world had a
moral duty to pursue a settlement in former Yugoslavia, no matter how
slim the chances.
After a 50-minute meeting with Mr Rifkind in London, he firmly denied
the Srebrenica crisis signalled the end of peace hopes.
But he stressed that the UN mission was at a turning-point and more
effective steps were needed.
''If there was a 99% probability of a political solution tomorrow or a
0.1% chance, we have the same duty to pursue that,'' he said.
''We have a moral duty to pursue the political process no matter how
slim the chances. We are a turning point where we need to consider how
to pursue the political process and how to continue UN operations and
there must be changes to both.''
Mr Bildt, a former Swedish Prime Minister, said the main priority now
was to get UN aid convoys to Srebrenica to relieve the suffering of more
than 30,000 refugees in the area.
The Security Council, in a unanimous resolution, condemned the Serb
offensive and demanded that both they and the Bosnian government fully
respect the status of the ''safe area'' in accordance with a 1993
demilitarisation agreement which neither side fully implemented.
But, with renewed images of so-called ''ethnic cleansing'' the Serbs
yesterday continued to clear the enclave of its population, with
characteristic efficiency, loading them on to vehicles to be driven to
Bosnian government territory.
Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said: ''Srebrenica is our
country.'' And he justified its capture saying: ''It is simply a
terrorist stronghold and we couldn't tolerate it any longer.''
The first 1000 refugees left in mid-afternoon.
''This is deplorable,'' said a UN spokesman. ''We are talking about
people who are badly in the need of medicine and food. They had nothing
to eat for 24 and more hours.''
All men over 16 were scrutinised as possible war criminals, UN
officials added.
Meanwhile, Britain reacted cautiously to pressure from France for the
new Rapid Reaction Force to take military action to recapture
Srebrenica.
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said that to walk away would make
the UN mission meaningless and added: ''We cannot leave Srebrenica with
our tails between our legs.''
But Mr Rifkind said the objectives of any military operation would
have to be ''realistic''.
He explained that Srebrenica was more than 100 miles from central
Bosnia, where the Rapid Reaction Force is based, and that 70% of the
route is under the control of the Bosnian Serbs.

Strasbourg
SCOTLAND will have similar status to a powerful German Lander
parliament if Labour wins the General Election, with an increased role
in Europe.
It means a new, major European office in Brussels staffed by senior
civil servants answering to a Scottish parliament and a Scottish
European Minister. It would be far ahead of the existing Scotland Europa
Centre, which is a mainly lobbying presence
The full force of Labour's plans for Scotland in Europe were laid
before Euro-MPs in Strasbourg by Mr Robin Cook, Shadow Foreign Secretary
at a private briefing. Mr Cook seemed to take some of his own party
colleagues by surprise with the strength of Labour's commitment.
He told reporters later that Labour's European policy for Scotland had
been explained clearly four months ago in a policy document, A
Parliament for Scotland. The policy was subsequently approved by the
Scottish party conference.
However, the constitutional significance of the proposals appears to
have been missed, with most media attention at the time being paid to
the shape and role of the parliament itself.
One Labour Euro-MP said last night: ''I think most of us failed to
grasp -- or just missed -- what all of this could mean.'' Others
appeared embarrassed that they had underestimated the implications of
their own party policy.
The party's plans for Scotland in Europe also appear to lay a
constitutional minefield for any future Labour administration. German
Lander, provincial parliaments, are the first level of political
representation below the federal government, and are powerful
institutions whose Ministers occasionally represent the state government
in the Council of Ministers as more than mere observers.
They have been known to cast votes. Their presences in Brussels are
embassies with a diplomatic role, as opposed to mere trade offices.
Giving Scotland a similar level of direct access to the European
institutions could, however, provoke an outcry in England. Labour is
about to produce a detailed policy document giving its views of how
English regional assemblies, if they are set up, should be empowered. Mr
Cook said they would not have legislative authority.
He said Scotland was a nation, not a region, and deserved a
parliament. The English regions did not, nor did they want one.
This view does not resolve the probability of English resentment at
Scotland enjoying a double bite at the Brussels cherry. All German
Lander are entitled to direct representation in Brussels.
Mr Cook quoted from the paper saying a Scottish parliament would offer
the ''best possible'' representation in Europe. There would be
''distinctive'' Scottish representation in the EU institutions.
''At the same time Scotland will have the political clout in the
Council of Ministers which comes from being part of the larger UK
delegation,'' he said.
At present Scottish Office Ministers are entitled to take part in
council meetings and to represent the UK. But they do so comparatively
seldom.
Labour sees the EU increasingly decentralising to the nations and
regions of Europe.
Mr Cook, describing Britain as one of the most centralised states in
the EU, talked of ''maximum'' representation for Scotland in the
Community and noted that the policy document talked of the establishment
of a Scottish European Office (SEO) in Brussels.
It would be a ''major'' Government office staffed by civil servants,
accountable to the Scottish parliament and capable of making direct
representations on its behalf to the EU institutions.
The document adds: ''German Lander already have observer status at the
Council of Ministers and automatic representation on the member state
delegation where the Landers' powers or interests are concerned.
Scotland would aim for similar status and would seek to ensure that it
is directly represented where appropriate on UK delegations to the
Council of Ministers.''
Mr Cook confirmed that Labour saw a Scottish parliament co-operating
with Euro-MPs in scrutinising European law relating to matters covered
by the parliament's responsibilities. This appears to offer a Scottish
parliament the same power as Westminster, where European law can be
debated but not altered.
He described the role of Scotland in Europe under Labour as based on
an ''appropriate and balanced package'' which would not simply duplicate
the efforts of the UK's permanent representation in Brussels.
The plan brought an expected reaction from the Tories. Mr David
McLetchie, President of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist
Association, said: ''This proposal is no more than political window
dressing and yet another diversion to draw attention away from Labour's
flawed devolution plan and the threat it poses to the integrity of the
UK.''
The SNP's vice-president and MEP for North-east Scotland, Dr Allan
Macartney, said: ''Robin Cook's analogy with the German Lander is
totally spurious for two reasons. First, in order to work, the Lander
model requires a federal constitution, which Labour oppose for the UK.
''Second, the European rights of the 16 Lander are collective, being
exercised by the federal Upper House, and do not relate to individual
Land. Transferred to the UK, this would mean no special voice for
Scotland. Logically we would be 'represented' by the House of Lords.''
''All in all, it is a poor substitute for being an integral part of
the UK, a top-table nation in the Council of the European Union.''
He added: ''There is no substitute for the power of independence in
Europe and Scotland taking her place alongside the 10 other small EU
member states. Scotland cannot be equated with Lower Pomerania.''
The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace, said:
''We are already working on our own proposals and we are quite certain
that there are enormous benefits for Scotland through establishing
direct relations with the EU itself, as well as with other nations and
regions in the EU, such as Catalonia.
''These benefits can be had whilst retaining the integrity of the UK
and the benefits to Scots which that provides.''

ONE of Scotland's biggest hospitals is considering plans to open
#50-a-night rooms for expectant mothers. The five rooms for paying
patients at Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh will have
extras such as TVs and CD players.
The rooms are former secretarial offices. Hospital chiefs say the
#80,000 proposals to transform them are being considered because of
demand from patients.
Politicians and union leaders believe the move is further proof of
creeping privatisation in the health service.
The maternity unit at Simpson's has 130 beds and delivers around 5000
babies a year.
The Royal Infirmary NHS Trust which runs Simpson's described the beds
at the centre of the controversy as ''amenity ones'' aimed at NHS
patients who wanted to pay for privacy in hospital.
However, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, Mr Alistair Darling, said
patients should not be put in a position where they had to buy their
privacy.
''It is the beginning of the introduction of the concept of private
beds within the health service,'' he said.
Lothian Health Council secretary, Mr Robert Stevenson, said the money
spent creating the rooms could not be justified.
Mr Stevenson said: ''There are areas in the Royal Infirmary which are
in need of upgrading. Places like the dental hospital and the cardiology
out-patients are in urgent need of work. Against that background it is
hard for the trust to justify expenditure of around #80,000 on private
amenity rooms.''
He added that he felt concerned that an NHS trust should be taking
steps to encourage commercialism in hospitals, especially involving
women at a very sensitive time, when they were due to give birth.
A spokeswoman for The Royal Infirmary Trust defended the move.
''These are not private beds. They are amenity beds aimed at NHS
patients who want a bit of peace and quiet with their families,'' she
said.
''In the maternity unit, creating five amenity beds would have no
adverse affect on other patients.''

AN 84-year-old man has become the first British resident to be charged
with war crimes under the War Crimes Act of 1991.
Mr Szymon Serafinowicz has been charged with four counts of murdering
Jews during the Second World War, Scotland Yard said.
All four offences are alleged to have been committed in villages in
Nazi-occupied Byelorussia between 1941 and 1942.
Mr Serafinowicz, from Banstead, Surrey, was alleged to have been a
commander in the local police force. He was charged late last night and
will appear before Epsom magistrates today.
The 84-year-old, of Palmersfield Road, was charged at a London police
station before being released on bail.
The charges faced by Mr Serafinowicz are that:
On 27 October 1941 in the village of Turets, Byelorussia, then under
the German occupation, he murdered an unknown Jew in circumstances
constituting a violation of the laws and customs of war, contrary to
common law.
The other charges relate to similar alleged murders, in the same
village and the villages of Mir and Kryniczne.
It is thought that Mr Serafinowicz moved to Britain in 1947 and worked
as a carpenter.
The likely sensitivity and potential difficulties of the case were
emphasised by a hurriedly-issued statement from the Attorney-General's
office to the media about the dangers of prejudicing any trial.
The statement warned that serious prejudice could flow from
''background'' reporting ''which includes coverage of and comment on the
substance of the evidence relating to the charges, the witnesses and
matters affecting their credibility''.
Papers outlining the cases against up to seven alleged Nazi war
criminals living in Britain are believed to have been put before the
Attorney-General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, within the last few weeks.
