CAUTIOUS comments about the prospects for 1995 from Carel Mosselman,
chairman of the money-broking group Exco, overshadowed news of increased
profits in 1994, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Exco said that after a decline, market activity had recently increased
but had still not returned to the levels seen in the early part of last
year.
The broker reported a 5% rise in 1994's pre-tax profits to #43.5m.
Turnover was 11% ahead at #234.4m.
However, it was a tale of two halves. In the first six months it made
#28m but by the second half this had reduced to #15m.
European profits improved but were lower in the US.
The total dividend payment in the year was 6.0p after a final
shareholders' payment of 3p.

DEAR Dorothy,
I haven't seen the film yet, but I know you would be appalled by the
fact of it, as you were when the idea of a biopic of you was suggested
in your lifetime.
I hope you are in heaven when you hear the gossip of it. I can imagine
you reiterating one of your favourite phrases -- ''What fresh hell is
this?'' I like the idea of Mrs Parker in paradise saying that, perhaps
to some divine-looking eternally-attentive boy-angel.
But how are you coping with that? Of men you said, ''I Loved Them
Until They Loved Me.'' I suppose some feminists would hope that you have
sloughed off, along with your mortal coil, that masochistic victim
stuff. (Women blues singers are getting into a lot of trouble about that
too nowadays, along with Jean Rhys and Elizabeth Smart, but do tell
Bessie and the girls that they are still being listened to and
empathised with -- though it's a bit like you all drinking during
Prohibition. A bit of care has to be taken but loads of people are doing
it.)
Anyway, for what it's worth, I think your short story, ''A Telephone
Call'', about that poor agonised and self-deluded creature praying and
rationalising beside the silent machine shows how your writing was smart
and smarting both. The first poem of yours I ever read was ''Resume'':
Razors pain you
Rivers are damp
Acids stain you
And drugs cause cramp
Guns aren't lawful
Nooses give
Gas smells awful
You might as well live.
Of course it is the wit for which you are most remembered. In a way I
know you found this galling, when some people acted as if all you ever
said was that ''Men seldom make passes, etc''. But the fact remains that
your one-liners were Queen Marys. I could forgive anyone (almost)
anything for calling her canary Onan because he spilled his seed on the
ground. And there was the woman who broke her leg falling down a
barrister. And when you were told that President Coolidge had died, you
sweetly wondered how could they tell? (Then Benchley added: ''He got an
erection''.)
I learnt that last bit from Marion Meade's biography. I know, I know,
what you think of biographies too, but it is very good, that book. It
was reading a dreadful biography of you when I was in my twenties that
led to me writing my first play. (He said your problem was that you had
a ''man's head inside a woman's body''.)
Yes, my play was about you. Please don't stop reading this -- I didn't
use any direct quotes. But when the actress merely mentioned the name
Onan there were giggles from the biblically knowledgeable in the
audience. In those days there were few funny women on the Edinburgh
Fringe, dead or alive, if you see what I mean. And I liked you for being
spot-on, as opposed to right-on.
In your life your political commitment was ambivalently received by
your contemporaries: what with your dressing up as a Ukrainian peasant
when you were earning loads in Hollywood, after the chic Valentino suits
of early New York days. The ambivalence was not, however, shared by the
FBI. Did they carefully record your words when you said to those guys:
''Listen, I can't even get my dog to stay down. Do I look to you like
someone who could overthrow the Government?''
I hope I'm not embarrassing you, because you always played it
dismissively down in later life, but it was courageous founding the
Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and demonstrating in the cause of Sacco and
Vanzetti and vehemently supporting the Screen Writers' Guild as opposed
to the rival, studio-supported union.
Expecting the studios to represent the rights of writers was indeed
''like trying to get laid in your mother's house. Somebody was always in
the parlor, watching''. And though you were never actually called up
before McCarthy's committee, the offers dried up as quick as a julep
under a Californian sky.
But though writers occupied a lowly place in the Hollywood hierarchy,
your working partnership with Allan Campbell is still recognised today
as a successful one -- his strong sense of structure complementing your
ability to produce the ''zinger'', the clinching line . . . I can see
your ironically raising your glass, because Faulkner, Odets, Fitzgerald,
and Nathaniel West managed somehow to keep separate the strands of their
work: their often compromised film writing operating as a support system
for their more protected endeavours. Because while mother and stepmother
died on you as a child, motherhood evaded you with miscarriage after
miscarriage. Because it all ended pretty bleakly for you, your dog C'est
Tout and Onan in the Volney residence hotel, having outlived the
Algonquin Round Table crowd. (Outrageous living having led to
dysfunctions of the liver.)
Perhaps you are sipping a less treacherous liquid up there and telling
your boy-angel about the doctor who, having said that he didn't like
your kidneys, was told that you didn't like his nose. And even if you
hate the movie, you will have such fun giving your celestial gang a
running commentary on its inaccuracy or banality. You might even decide
that the film might as well live too.

Jim Hewitson recalls how True Thomas held not only the attention of a
king but the affections of the Queen of Fairyland
ANCIENT Ercildoune. Ah, yes, there is something magical about that
name, something redolent of Camelot, Avalon, of lost cities older than
time -- tabernacles of the old magic. We know Ercildoune better as the
Borders village of Earlston, located in beautiful countryside about five
miles from Galashiels.
Main claim to fame for the community is that it was the home ground of
the famous poet and seer, Thomas the Rhymer, or Thomas Learmont, who
flourished in the thirteenth century and eventually earned the nickname
of True Thomas because of the uncanny accuracy of his predictions.
Remains of his stone tower can still be seen at Earlston.
Years ago I first became aware of this interesting individual through
a line-drawing completed in 1910 by Munro Orr, showing the boy king
Alexander III perched on his huge throne, sceptre in hand, listening
open-mouthed, clearly entranced, as the Rhymer recites a Gaelic poem to
the accompaniment of a harp.
The likelihood is that Thomas held not only the King but the whole
nation under his spell. He is mentioned in ancient documents and among
the predictions attributed to him were the death of Alexander, the
Battle of Bannockburn and the accession of James VI. Verily he was
Lauderdale's Nostradamus.
However, his most outrageous exploit was a seven-year sojourn in
fairyland. He was enticed there, according to the Border ballad, by the
''Queen of Fair Elfland'' who came riding down by the Eildom tree while
Thomas was snatching 40 winks on a grass bank. Thomas could not resist
giving this beauty a smacker, full on the lips, but this apparently
destined him to servitude for seven years. The ballad tells us:
She mounted on her milk-white steed;
She's taen True Thomas up behind;
And aye, when'er her bridal rung
The steed flew swifter than the wind.
Now whether this adventure was a metaphor for some serious hochmagandy
in which Thomas indulged himself we'll probably never know. But perhaps
being ''away wi' the fairies'' was a convenient alibi.
However, the air in Earlston must have some special, splendid
properties because in tracking the story of Thomas another amazing
occupant of the Rhymer's tower surfaces. He was Patrick Murray, a doctor
with a difference, who set up home in the ruins some time in the mid
1700s.
Now partly because of the aura which hung around the tower, but mainly
because of his bizarre activities Murray, author of ''Uncommon Tumour of
the Belly and Dropsy Cured'' gained a reputation locally as a wizard.
Robert Chambers, that hard-headed collector of facts, regrettably
demystified Murray's story in the mid-1800s concluding that he earned
his reputation by pursuing various scientific studies uncommon in
eighteenth century Scotland.
Murray's collection of outlandish objects included a stuffed
alligator, a musical clock, a mysterious ''electrical machine'' and,
most exciting of all, a mechanical contrivance connected to a
weathercock on the roof by which he could tell the direction of wind
without moving from his fireside chair. Aided by his barometer he would
impress guests with a passably accurate, weather forecast.
A few decades earlier and Murray the eccentric weatherman would have
been burned at the stake for sic' a performance.

CHAINSAW sculptor Nigel Ross hasn't looked back since the day he
decided to branch out from general forestry. Now he is literally carving
himself a new career and travel all over Europe to complete commissions
and fulfil requests for demonstrations.
Protected by a steel visor, gloves and special overtrousers against a
bombardment of needle-sharp chips, Nigel deftly uses a chainsaw to
painstakingly carve his way through the hardest of wood, often
feet-thick.
Although born in England, 48-year-old Nigel has spent most of his life
in Scotland. It was while working as a forester on the island of Arran
that he finally decided to kick-start a long-held desire to take up wood
sculpting.
Nigel, of Bryson Road, Polworth, Edinburgh, had nursed an urge to
combine interests in working in wood and art, and ''it was my intention,
for a while, to go to art school as a mature student'', he explains.
''But my own style began to emerge, so I gradually put aside the notion
for formal training.''
Although fortuitous, the move was well grounded, as Nigel can earn
between #200 and #1000 for certain pieces of sculpting, and the
popularity and appreciation of his work grows continually.
''Some pieces can take two days, others two or three weeks,'' he says.
''Figurative work is much more demanding, but I seem to be getting
better all the time in that particular area.''
Nigel recently unveiled some of his unusual works in the grounds of
Overtoun Castle, a Victorian estate in Dunbartonshire, including the
giant fish, a cow sited alongside a paddock, and massive armchairs
created from elm.

EVERYTHING you ever wanted to know about everything, and now you do
know who to ask. Throughout Scotland during set95, from March 17-26,
there are more than 100 events taking place on everything from the world
of the past to the future of our planet and that of the universe and
multiverse. Scientists and researchers from Scotland's universities and
academic institutions are throwing open their doors to the public in the
biggest jamboree of knowledge dissemination since the encyclopaedia
salespeople first got their foot in your door more than 30 years ago.
''In the past, there were a lot of worthy organisations holding events
that were supposed to be aimed at the public,'' said Brian Gamble,
Director of Programmes at the British Association for the Advancement of
Science. ''But ask Mrs Public what she knows about science and she'll
run a mile. We should not expect the public to come to us. We have to go
to them, we have to take science out of the campuses and into the
shopping malls and we don't want to hear any 16-letter words, just
explain it in plain and simple language that we can all understand.
''Even people who are not normally exposed to science and technology
will find that it is interesting, it is exciting, it is fun, and it is
relevant to our day-to-day lives.''
From the Orkneys to Oban, from Arbroath to Aberdeen, town halls,
libraries, museums, and the campuses will be awash with hands-on demos
and talks, experiments and roadshows. As a taster, try some of these for
size:
St Andrews has a range of activities covering, for example,
stargazing, rainbows, the universe, DIY science with mirrors, holograms,
and kaleidoscopes. Aberdeen has mysteries of the sky, forensic science,
robotics, and super-sleuthing skills. In Inverness the locals will be
cybergliding on the Internet. Edinburgh has the Hitchhikers' Guide to
the Universe, the International Science Schools Olympiad, multimedia
technology, radar satellites, and marine worms. Cumbernauld will be
looking at electronic engineering, computing, biology, physics and
chemistry. Dundee is taking a keyhole view of man, medicine, and
machine.
Glasgow University has a hot-line number for its events, 0141 330
4206, which include a great ''sniff-in'', arcs and sparks and a
much-appreciated Science for Mums and Dads series.
Strathclyde University has a ''How do they do that?'' and a Science
Olympiad at Jordanhill, or how about a spot of shopping while you're
swotting at Princes Square in Glasgow organised by Caledonian
University?
''At the University of Glasgow, as with other institutions throughout
Scotland, we are looking froward to welcoming thousands of visitors to
our events during set95,'' said the Principal, Sir William Fraser. ''The
work of scientists and engineers concerns everyone. Our aim in set95 is
to show that everyone can understand science and engineering -- and even
find it fun.''
For details of what's on in your area, call your local university,
check the programme at local libraries, or write to the British
Association for the Advancement of Science at 23 Savile Row, London WIX

* REPRESENTATIVES of the seven most powerful nations in the world met
in Brussels recently at the G7 summit on the information society to
discuss the possible regulation and social implications of the
superhighway, now regarded by many as the ''third wave'' in the
evolutionary cycle of change sweeping across the globe.
The agrarian and industrial revolutions were the first and second
waves of change, but the third wave, that of the technology-driven
knowledge and information market, capable of being accessed by virtually
anyone, anywhere (provided they have the hardware and software) will
dramatically alter our economic and cultural development into the next
century and beyond.
Today, though, science and technology are already having an impact on
our day-to-day lives.
The future has arrived and you either embrace it with an open mind, as
have the millions of cybergliders on the Internet, or you can stick your
head in the sand and pray that it is all one big hype that will fade
into the mists of time. Trouble is, it will not go away.
The Internet, spawned in 1969 and known then as Darpanet, grew out of
a US military programme designed to safeguard communications in the
event of a nuclear war, but subsequently the Net has given new impetus
to our seemingly unquenchable thirst for knowledge in every sphere of
life.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science in the UK, an
independent body with more than 150 years' experience of promoting
science, is the organisation behind the National Science, Engineering,
and Technology Week, the second of which, called set95, takes place
throughout the country next week running from March 17 to 26.
More than 3000 science events, staged in universities, museums, and
even shopping centres, are on offer and copies of the programme are
available at all local libraries. Alternatively, write to set95, British
Association, 23 Savile Row, London WIX 2NB.
* WHY DOES it rain? Why is the sky blue? Does the light in the fridge
really go out when I close the door? The boffins at Glasgow University
are puting their reputations on the line during set95 to answer all such
questions. Fax them a question, any question, on Wednesday March 22 or
Thursday 23, between 9am and 4pm, and they will endeavour to fax you an
answer within the hour. So, if you've ever wanted to stump a scientist,
now's your chance. Fax your questions to 0141 330 4206.
* FANCY becoming a ''beta'' tester for Microsoft's new Windows 95
software, prior to its scheduled general release date of August this
year? Starting next month, 400,000 copies of Bill Gates's controversial
new product will be made available to trial users around the world.
Register your interest by telephoning 0181 943 2021. If you're lucky
you could be one of 40,000 UK participants who will get the chance to
play with a preview copy for around the #30 mark. Sadly, the trial
version has about an eight-month lifespan. After that your screen will
self-destruct -- metaphorically speaking, of course.
* SCIENCE by E-mail is the title of a novel initiative by Glasgow
University during set95. The service is aimed at schools, and the
university promises to answer questions on any scientific matter. Mail
received by March 25 will be answered by the start of the summer term.
E-mail your questions to: g.durantatmuseum.gla.ac.uk. Those in the know
will of course remember to use lower-case letters throughout. Why no
capitals? There's your first question. If your school is not yet up to
speed on electronic mail, you can submit questions by conventional mail.

We're spoiled for choice of fabrics, says Adam
McNee. WENDY JACK samples the springtime
freshness of Perth's master of interior design.
IN his 33 years in the trade, interior designer Adam McNee has seen
massive changes take place . . . the aristocratic and country families,
once the mainstay of interior design when he started out, have been
replaced by a mass market, no longer running scared of what was once
perceived to be a snooty and expensive business.
''The past 15 years have seen a totally different clientele from the
old, privileged elite. The accessibility of everything to the general
public, by virtue of education by the mass media, has had a huge impact,
along with people like Laura Ashley, who brought country house interiors
to everyone,'' Mr McNee explains.
For 12 years he has run his own business, Adam McNee Interiors, in
Perth, and at a recent home interiors exhibition near Edinburgh his
sparkling stand, with his interpretation of a fresh, spring look with
Jane Churchill fabrics, deservedly scooped first prize.
The pair of mirrors, which he covered in rich, iris-blue velvet and
finished with a swooping bow and curve of dried flowers, epitomised the
master's touch, creating focal points that co-ordinated with the room
scheme without dominating it.
One of the problems he sees in today's market place is the sheer
choice available. ''I think one of the biggest things that have confused
the public,'' he declares, ''is the mass of fabrics available. They are
totally spoiled for choice. It's all a bit mesmerising.''
Foremost among the changes in his own area of the country, Perthshire,
has been the influx of immensely wealthy foreigners buying estates with
grand old country houses at their centre. ''They're of an international,
moneyed class who have already used their own designers, and they fly
them in and sometimes their own tradesmen too. It's a shame, really,
because the locals miss out.
''Thirty years ago, on the old estates, at least the work would be
done locally, something which contributed to the local economy. It's
irksome to me, and that's not just because I don't get anything.''
In some of these huge houses the amount of money spent on interior
design, says Mr McNee, ''is just enormous. Not just design; it's every
trade which is involved. Some of it is very specialised work, but we do
have some wonderful craftsmen and tradesmen from all over, although they
are limited in their knowledge of areas like underfloor heating and
terracotta tiles, for example.''
In terms of what's done in the name of design within these fine old
houses, Mr McNee is politely restrained in his comments, permitting
himself only: ''There are some designers who have no affinity with
Scottish country houses. International designers either use their own
ideas or do what the client likes, translated to suit the house. It can
be very arresting.''
The veritable explosion of interior designers over the past 15 years
or so indicates more clearly than anything else that the general public
has finally overcome its former reticence and will now happily dip into
the expertise and advice which is readily available.
Adam McNee will stir memories for many when he recalls the days when
he entered the business: ''There were probably only about six interior
designers in Scotland. It's just snowballed -- that's outwith the
traditional, much-loved furnishing houses like Wylie and Lochhead in
Glasgow, Love's of Perth, and Graham and Morton of Stirling, which no
longer exist, of course.''
Overall, however, the shifting sands of interior design must be among
the few major changes which have been only positive and welcome.

Great reductions are to be had on world-wide flights for those willing
to give up some of their baggage allowance. Sarah Mayes investigates the
ups and downs of an international courier
EVER wondered how you could travel the world for a fraction of the
usual price? No, you don't have to marry an airline pilot. Flying as a
courier can be a great way to travel by scheduled flights all over the
world for as little as 20% of the normal ticket price. Courier companies
deliver letters and packages to the world's major business centres. They
use couriers to check the material through Customs, as unaccompanied
material could be detained for more than a week. The courier companies
sell the airline tickets for heavily discounted prices to members of the
public in return for using their passenger's baggage allowance, or part
of it.
So who can become a courier? Anyone over 18 who holds a valid
passport. And what's the catch? There is no catch, except that on some
courier flights you can only take hand luggage for yourself as your
baggage allowance is used to carry the documents. However, if you are
planning to stay for less than a month, there are companies which allow
you to take 23 kg of luggage (equivalent to a medium-sized suitcase),
such as Courier Travel Services (071 351 0300). If you are prepared to
travel with hand luggage only, there are more companies to choose from
and you can find tickets valid from one week to one year.
You can book your courier flight well in advance as most courier
companies buy their tickets for a particular flight every day for up to
six months in advance. Even if the company has nothing to send on the
actual day you travel, your seat on the plane is still secure as the
ticket bought by the company has already been re-sold to you.
You will usually be asked to arrive at the airport approximately three
hours before your flight is due to take off, to meet a representative
from the company who will check the material for transportation through
Customs and hand the relevant paperwork over to you. You will be met at
the other end of the journey by another representative of the company.
And don't worry, you won't be asked to carry anything illegal -- it will
never be anything other than documents or computer software.
As with any other form of travel, it pays to shop around. Current
examples of prices from Courier Travel Services are New York return for
#99, San Francisco return for #175, and Hong Kong return for #299. If
you are prepared to fly ''standby'' you can get even better bargains. If
the courier company cannot locate anyone to fly to a certain place on a
certain date, prices will drop. If they have a cancellation or there is
a seat they cannot sell, they may even give the ticket away for free.
Generally speaking, the same rules apply to courier flights as to the
travel industry as a whole -- it is cheaper to travel off-season than it
is at peak periods like Christmas and summer.
Two other companies offering bargains to a wide range of destinations
world-wide are: Bridges World-wide (081 759 8059) and Polo Express (0932
820960).

Something's cooking, says
Geraldine Abrahams, as she
discovers an Italian firm
that's putting the steaminess
back into kitchens
IF you do not think that kitchens can be sexy, then think again. It is
no accident that the latest design to emerge from the Italian kitchen
designer and manufacturer Arc Linea is called Marilyn -- after Ms
Monroe, of course.
Just announced, this 1950s-style kitchen range is very curvy, very
angular, and has patterned, sliding-glass doors tantalisingly revealing
just a hint of what is behind them, and comes in poster blue, lemon, and
white.
Arc Linea has been moving in this direction for some time,
incorporating the see-through cupboard doors, steel handles, and bright
colours that were so popular in the post-war, post-austerity years.
The new designs are based on research which has examined the changing
attitudes, lifestyles, and trends of society as it has evolved through
what will undoubtedly be noted as one of the worst world-wide recessions
in history. It is no accident that these designs -- like the latest
fashions -- have the nostalgic appeal of the ''You've never had it so
good'' years.
Almost all of the new designs have thrown caution to the wind. The
sedate natural wood finishes so popular in the eighties have all but
disappeared unless they are accompanied by bright laminates in colours
like mandarine, vanilla yellow, and air-force blue. Natural finishes in
the 1995 range from Arc Linea are more likely to be marble, granite, and
solid maple.
Each design carries its own message, whether it is the yearning to
return to the glamorous Hollywood days of Marilyn Monroe in Marilyn, or
the desire to embody family values in the warm, cosy tones of
Mediterranea.
Despite its very obvious hi-tech appeal, even the Florida has a dated
elegance and a very American feel to it. Flor, part of the Life, Flor,
and Mariee collection, like Marilyn, is very up-front in its intentions.
What you see is what you get. With glass-fronted cupboards everywhere,
the contents of this kitchen are on display, and the impression is one
of wholesome homeliness.
Defying this movement back in time, the Flower is a futuristic,
state-of-the-art kitchen with amazing curved, sail-like walls and
minimalist hob and shelves.
But back to sexy. Mary and James Kelly of Inside Story Design
Partnership in Largs have known about sexy kitchens from about 1984,
when they first opened their kitchen design studio five years after they
both graduated as interior designers. Now they have acquired a
dealership in Arc Linea kitchens.
When they asked one of their first clients to comment on his
experience at Inside Story, the response was unexpectedly frank: ''I
remember Rosemary (wife) tentatively admiring one particular kitchen
display. Sculptured starkly in white and chrome it looked functional,
profoundly expensive, and very sexy -- yes, despite my rather
conservative upbringing and somewhat pragmatic outlook on life, I will
always swear that kitchen looked sexy. We bought the kitchen.''
I didn't know men felt like that about kitchens. It goes some way to
explaining the movements of ''new man'' over the past decade as he has
hurtled headlong into the kitchen mumbling something about an innate
desire to create culinary masterpieces.
For most women, a bright, colourful, practical, and comfortable
kitchen will usually do the trick.
* The Inside Story Design Partnership stocks the latest kitchen
designs from Italy and Germany and has recently moved on to include
upmarket bathroom ranges and soft furnishings manufactured in their own
workroom. For further information call owners Mary and James Kelly at

WHAT do you do if disaster strikes when you are on holiday abroad? Two
million people every year turn to the British Consul. With offices in
most capital cities of the world, help is unlikely to be far away.
However, there are limits to what consulate officials can do.
They can issue you with an emergency passport, advise you on how to
transfer funds from home, and contact friends or relatives to see if
they can help you with money or tickets. But they can't foot your hotel,
medical, or any other bills. They will cash you a cheque for up to #100,
if it's supported by a bank card, and they can make you a repayable loan
for your fare home, but the Foreign Office stresses this is only as a
last-resort.
Bear in mind that consulates are funded by the taxpayer and are only
there to advise in emergencies.
However they do receive some unusual requests, like the one from the
lady who wanted her cat buried in the consulate garden so that it would
rest in peace on English soil. In this case officials were able to
oblige. But they won't be able to help you with problems that should be
dealt with by your tour representative.
The Foreign Office warns that consulates cannot perform miracles if
you break local laws. Drugs offences in particular can carry very severe
penalties, and while consulates can provide you with a list of local
lawyers and interpreters, and can pass messages to relatives and friends
at home, they cannot interfere with local legal proceedings.
Never carry luggage or parcels through Customs for other people (for
obvious reasons). Be careful if you are using binoculars to pursue
hobbies, like bird-watching or trainspotting, especially if you are near
military installations as you could be accused of spying!
However, the vast majority of people travelling abroad never need to
contact the British Consul at all. Britons made over 30 million trips
abroad last year but only 10,000 needed consulate help.
The British Consul can also give you advice on any potential
troublespots before you go on holiday. Up-to-date information on around
100 countries can be found on CeeFax (pages 564-567) or you can
telephone the Foreign Office on 0171-270 4129.
Finally, the best way to head-off any problems is to be prepared. Get
It Right Before You Go leaflets, containing full details of the service
the British Consul can provide, and commonsense advice on what to do
before you travel, are available from Post Offices and travel agents.

WITH the approach of spring, and lighter, longer days, brighter
colours take the stage, writes MARY BENNIE. And judging by the new
furnishing fabrics now making an appearance, there's no excuse for being
dull.
For a fresh, pretty look, this season's floral fabrics are combined
with toning patterns, in motifs, checks, or stripes. Laura Ashley has
plenty of ideas for mixing and matching styles and colours, and light
blues, sunny yellows, and warm pinks feature strongly in its fabric
collections. The English Style range includes Somerton multi,
reminiscent of cottage gardens with its bold, colourful hollyhocks in
blues, reds, and yellows on a white background; Somerton multi-curtains
would look good against pale yellow, blue or white walls, while cushions
will add a splash of spring colour to a plain chair or sofa.
Try a contrasting pelmet or border for added interest -- such as the
blue Trevoil chambray, teamed in the picture with Regatta Stripe for a
light and pretty look.
Bring a hint of Mediterranean warmth to your kitchen with Laura
Ashley's Kitchen Garden collection. It features bunches of fruit and
green asparagus, with vases of kitchen utensils, used in a lively
freehand design on a dusky pink background, conjuring up images of
outdoor eating in warmer climes. The collection includes placemats and
napkins as well as wallpaper and curtain fabric.
Garden themes also feature in the new range of 100% cotton fabrics
just in at John Lewis. The Botanical Collection includes two designs
which are more than 100 years old. Nature Trail, which features
different ferns in shades of green, and Rose and Honeysuckle, which
comes in pinks, blues, and pale lemon, have both been adapted from block
print designs from the archive of Stead McAlpine, the textile printing
arm of John Lewis. The firm was founded some 160 yeaes ago and became
part of the partnership in 1965.
Printed on a colour-washed background, these traditional designs team
well with the two contemporary designs in this range, Floribunda and
Hedgerow. Each fabric is available in different colourways. The material
is from #11 a metre.
On a bolder note, other new fabrics at John Lewis include the Camelot
family -- Guinevere, Barossa, Camelot, Veneto, and Avalon -- adding a
medieval feel with their more formal, geometric designs.
Available in rich jewel colours such as emerald, olive, garnet, amber,
and sapphire, each design and colour complements the others in the
range, so they can be combined successfully for greater impact. The
Camelot range of fabric costs #10.50 a metre.
For a less formal effect, Nantucket emphasises an American country
look in three bright, patchwork-style colourways. Mix it with the
co-ordinating Chequers fabric, featuring small bright checks in cherry,
ocean, or jade. Priced at #9.50 per metre for Nantucket, #8.50 for
Chequers.
To round off its new spring collection, John Lewis has some new
designs that will appeal to children. Carousel reproduces motifs from
old-fashioned fairground characters in bright red and royal blue, which
complements the Barney's Circus range, introduced last autumn. On a
nautical theme, Barnacle Bay, in softer pastels, evokes Edwardian
bathing scenes. Both in 100% cotton, #8.95 a metre.
Continuing the nautical theme, John Lewis's Ocean Wave fabric comes in
three different pastel colours -- marine, azure, and coral -- and
features the currently popular shell and fossil motifs at #9.50 a metre.

IT is a strange Saturday indeed when only one premier division club is
involved in the quarter-finals of the Tennents Scottish Cup.
But that is the state of the art this afternoon when Hibs are the lone
representatives of the top league as they meet second division
Stenhousemuir at Ochilview at the same time as two first-division teams,
Raith Rovers and Airdrie, face each other in another tie at Stark's
Park.
Because of television, in its terrestial and satellite guises, one tie
was switched to last night, when Celtic and Kilmarnock met at Hampden,
and another tomorrow, when Hearts take on Dundee United at Tynecastle.
Hibs will be odds on favourites to win, but the wee team managed by
the head teacher of Musselburgh Grammar School, Terry Christie, have
already dealt with two sides similarly fancied -- St Johnstone, whom
they smashed 4-0 and Aberdeen, whom they conquered by 2-0.
Christie, who was a Hibs fan and, after today, will be one again, once
thought he had been appointed as Easter Road manager. The job went to
current chief Alex Miller, and Christie would appreciate the irony more
than most if his part-time lads can do the great deed again. However
they get on, 'Muir have already had their finest year.
Hibs cannot claim to have had little warning of the dangers they face,
and their captain, Gordon Hunter, fully acknowledges that there can be
no excuse in that direction.
He said: ''If we fail, it won't be because we have taken any chances.
Our preparation for this tie has been so detailed it could be the final
itself.''
The capital club have been working hard at every aspect of the
preparation in their central Scotland hotel for the past couple of days,
but the psychological factor must be the most important at this stage of
the season.
Said Hunter: ''We know Stenhousemuir will have the crowd giving them
great backing after their wins so far,'' said Hunter, ''and the tight
pitch will be in their favour. They will be well organised by Terry
Christie and they have some good players, but we are the full-time club
with international players and it is down to us to make that count.''
Hunter is one of a number of Easter Road men who can recall their
League Cup triumph four years ago and relishes the prospect of reaching
the later stages of this competition. ''We must have a real chance of
going all the way again.''
They will have to tackle today's tie without the man who scores goals
from midfield, Pat McGinlay, who is suspended, but otherwise, they are
in good fettle.
The premier side can be sure of a loud and excited welcome from the
locals, who have snatched the few tickets available for a game that
could have sold out four five times over. Christie never overstates his
side's chances, but he will expect them to give of their best once
again. That will guarantee a thrilling afternoon, whatever else.
Raith Rovers, who have begun to get used to this cup business, will be
in the unusual position of starting favourites, but Airdrie have a long,
hard-won cup reputation and will be in no mood to let the fact that they
lost to their first division peers last week disturb their determination
to reach the semi-finals.
Rovers have no injury worries and are still very much on target for
promotion to complement their magnificent success in the Coca-Cola Cup
last November, but their manager, Jimmy Nicholl, knows how tough a tie
his men face on their own park this afternoon.
''Certainly, beating them on Monday did us no harm, but I believe they
will react to the bigger crowd we expect here, about 6500, and they will
be really determined. If we are not up for it, as they will be, we will
be out.''
He has the same squad from which to choose, but is toying with the
idea of producing something different in his line-up. ''That 2-1 win on
Monday was hard fought and it could be a close thing again. It is
sometimes best to have something up your sleeve.''

RANGERS will have their star turn back on show at Ibrox today when
they meet Falkirk in a premier division game that means a lot to both
clubs
Brian Laudrup, who missed out last week because of flu, is fit and
ready to enhance his reputation as the top entertainer in the Scottish
game.
If the need for points is easy enough to understand for Falkirk -- one
of the clutch of teams involved in the relegation struggle -- Rangers
manager Walter Smith insists that the urgency is just as real for his
team, even if they are 15 points clear at the top of the table.
''Everybody has been concentrating on the relegation battle and how
much it means to the teams involved,'' he said. ''But we are trying to
clinch another championship, and while some people on the outside might
think it does not mean as much after winning successive titles, no-one
here thinks like that.''
Smith admits that he cannot recall a relegation contest with so many
clubs involved, and he is sure, for that reason, the last quarter of the
season will be difficult for every team in the league.
The appearance of Maurice Johnston at one of his old goal-scoring
grounds will add intrigue, and Smith retains a healthy respect for the
man who will play his second game after having left Hearts.
Falkirk will be without David Weir, who is suspended after having been
sent off against Motherwell.
If there will be some tension around Ibrox, it will be nothing
compared to the stress on the Aberdeen bus as it heads for Firhill,
where they face Partick Thistle in the most important game of their
season to date. The Dons are only two points ahead of the bottom club
and Thistle have two games in hand, a scenario that, simply, means
Aberdeen must win.
The Pittodrie club will have solid backing at least. The travel offer
from the club to fans has been a success, with 14 buses now making the
journey.
Said caretaker manager Roy Aitken: ''These extra fans, allied to our
normal support, can make all the difference. They have a key role to
play. I know all too well what a difference a noisy, vocal support can
make to a team.''
Midfield man Paul Kane is unlikely to be fit and Duncan Shearer seems
set to replace Eoin Jess up front.
Thistle will wait to see if defender Steve Pittman is fit but the team
are in great heart following their win over Dundee United.

LEAGUE reconstruction was a topic of discussion when a group of
football club chairman met in Edinburgh yesterday, but there is unlikely
to be a rush towards a change in the Scottish League's structure,
although Chris Robinson did not rule out entirely the possibility of
alteration.
The Hearts chairman, who hosted the gathering at his Wheatsheaf
catering company's offices, said the meeting was not called to discuss
one specific issue, and added that other get-togethers will be convened
regularly.
''I felt as a new chairman I wanted to get closer to the others and
hear their views on our business,'' he said. ''We discussed various
matters, a whole range of issues, and asked whether our product was good
enough.''
Robinson said the league set-up was discussed but would not comment
when asked if the four divisions of 10 clubs each would still be in
place at the start of next season. He did, however, say it was a
spurious argument to say sponsors would be scared off if the shape of
the Scottish League continued to change.
People feel the game is not right, but are not absolutely certain of
an alternative which would improve the standard, the wealth of the clubs
involved, and also the entertainment level for the supporters.
At least Robinson intends seeking the views of his club's fans by
using the club programme for tomorrow's Scottish Cup tie to ask them
what they want. It is about time the fans' needs were taken into
consideration. Robinson said that six clubs, his own, Aberdeen, Dundee
United, Hibernian, Motherwell, and Partick Thistle, attended the
meeting, while there were apologies from Celtic, Falkirk, and
Kilmarnock. Rangers didn't show.

TACTFULLY surveying my disastrous snow-hole, Margaret Potter warned:
''Please, though, don't write that it's fun.'' No chance of that.
Already reduced to middle-aged exhaustion after 10 minutes swinging my
ice-axe like some sweat-drenched convict breaking stones in a Western
movie, my neck and entire right side had gone into spasm.
Beside the splendid, roofed-and-caverned shelters of my companions
2000 feet up freezing, snow-swirled Ben Ledi, my pathetic effort looked
like the gouge mark of a hippo that had just sat down to lunch. Each
time I tried to cut snow blocks for the walls, they collapsed in my
hands like powder. In a genuine blizzard, at times of genuine
exhaustion, my chances of survival would surely be sub-zero.
But Margaret, co-founder and director of the Stirling-based C-n-Do
Scotland, had made a serious point. Recent publicity about the
remarkable survival of two women students, then a Nordic skier, after
spending two nights in snow-holes, risks lending a glamorous and
seductive air to this ultimate emergency technique.
Any walkers and climbers now led to believe ''learn the trick, and
we'll survive anything'' would be rash: not only is it difficult and
uncomfortable, with visibility problems for rescuers, it is also a last
refuge. With common sense and other mountaineering skills such as good
navigation, it shouldn't have to happen in the first place: and that is
the vital point.
As Scottish winter mountaineering again claims its annual toll of
lives, predictable controversy has raged once more about a sport
distinctive in its own right, which baffles outsiders as much as it
obsesses devotees. Whatever the merits of conflicting arguments, the
reality is that the numbers taking to our hills in winter will continue
to grow. Thus the whole issue of winter skills training is central and
pressing.
Some recent casualties made basic errors, and you can still meet
parties climbing Munros in dreadful weather with neither crampons nor
ice-axes: but the fact that many casualties have been well-trained and
well-equipped should not produce complacency or fatalism, for their
judgment about setting out or staying out has often been in doubt, and
such judgments themselves need to be recognised as basic elements of
winter skills.
How can more individuals, groups, and clubs be encouraged to take
seriously the need for skills training -- to realise, C-n-Do's
co-founder Dorothy Breckenridge says, that winter mountaineering is ''a
tenfold step up from summer mountaineering, in fitness, capability, and
skill levels''? What kinds of courses should be developed and how can
they be made more accessible? One problem is that they're often
expensive and difficult to take up for busy people with family and work
burdens -- too long, remote from main centres of population, or pitched
too ambitiously. C-n-Do have seen interest in winter skills grow from a
couple of sessions in 1987 to 25 day and weekend courses this season.
Founded in 1984, the organisation has won enough respect to become one
of the few providers of the National Navigation Awards Scheme -- and
their three femalen directors have also attracted and inspired many
women, as well as men, to take courses and develop their talents.
Ruth Hannah, one mountaineer who has just completed her Munros, gives
a typical accolade: ''Without C-n-Do there's no way I could have
achieved what I have . . . or even got across the Aonach Eagach! Their
organisation of trips is always excellent, and they manage to combine
reassurance with high standards.''
C-n-Do come across as having important lessons for other training
groups in three ways. First by a refreshingly laid-back, utterly
non-macho approach that's still meticulous and demanding; second, by
running a mix of courses, day walks, wilderness treks, and holidays that
draws in a whole range of skills and confidence (and an age from from 11
to 83), encouraging ordinary people in the confidence to progress from
the safety of guided walks to feats they never dreamed off. This summer
they offer adventures as far afield as the Polish Tantras and the
Pyrenees.
Third, and vitally, by running many day or weekend courses that are
inexpensive and accessible to busy people. My ''winter skills improver''
course demanded only that I organise one day's leave and babysitting;
but they crammed in enough to make my neck seize up and my brain spin.
It's salutary for an experienced winter hillwalker to realise with a
shock how much they didn't know -- like how to hold an ice-axe. Fuelled
by so many basic errors, my conquests of Munro summits in such
ill-fitting crampons seemed miraculous and accidental, my avoidance of
avalanches a freak of fate as Ian (an Alloa social worker taking a brief
respite) and I dug and prodded snowpits on Ben Ledi. Later we watched,
bemused, hundreds of balls of snow cascade before us down the sunlit
snow slopes.
My ice-axe arrest technique was a masterly study of how to stab
yourself through the face and heart, my step-cutting a sure-fire recipe
for tumbling down vertical slopes. All snow had looked like white stuff
to me, but a few hours with instructors Margaret and Toni Clark revealed
a dozen different clues in colour, texture, and frozen sculptures.
So don't be complacent or arrogant, all you fellow
winter-mountaineering freaks; there's an infinite amount to learn or
revise.
Time too, perhaps, for the Scottish Office, local authorities, and
sports bodies to think seriously about a range of subsidies for short
courses, as well as more strongly-worded and uncompromising messages
about the vital need for training. One may not work without the other,
but money for preventative work is likely to prove money well spent.
We totter back to the vehicle. What does C-n-Do do about appalling
people who come on their courses and holidays? ''Over the years, we've
really had very few,'' considers Margaret in another bout of
truthfulness or tact. ''I suppose we'd probably take them off our
mailing list.'' After my trail of disasters and tedious questions, I
wonder, ominously, how long I'll be waiting for the post.

THE collared dove is a strange phenomenon: a bird with no history.
Well-known in the Middle East and India, it only arrived west of the
Balkans 60 years ago.
Then followed a population explosion during which it colonised the
whole of the Continent. It spread across the middle of Europe at 60
miles a year: Czechoslovakia in 1935, Austria in 1938, Poland in 1940,
as the hooked cross marched in the other direction.
In the years of rationing it swung north to the Baltic. While we had
never had it so good, neither had the collared doves. They were seen in
Britain first in 1952, nested in England in 1955 and in Morayshire in
1957. The following decade saw them cover the British Isles and now they
are among our commonest birds.
Why did this happen? A genetic or behavioural alteration may have been
involved initially, but the basic answer is grain. Its abundance was
manna for the doves. The dove has probably always been commensal with
man and parasitic on poultry farming.
As it spread into north-west Europe it found human economic and
cultural conditions to its liking; spare grain from modern farming and
tolerance of birds that shared it. Zoos in particular often hold large
gangs of doves and a hen-run or bird-table covered in seeds are the best
places to see them locally.
Nowadays the purring trill they make as they flap up to a tree to
roost and their sleepy triple coo are as familiar as the cushie-doo.
Stop and take notice: they may be a bird with no folk identity but they
have shared with us the twentieth-century history of Europe.

TWO of Scotland's oldest rugby clubs, Edinburgh Academicals (founded
1857) and Edinburgh Wanderers (1868), have been holding exploratory
amalgamation talks.
First division Accies, whose Raeburn Place ground was the venue for
the first rugby international, between Scotland and England in 1871,
have been approached by second division Wanderers, who now share a
palatial new clubhouse with the Murrayfield club at the national
stadium.
Accies secretary Ken Lauder said there were major problems to overcome
before a merger could become a reality. ''This comes around every five
years or so. Wanderers are worried about what is going to happen to them
under the recast league set-up. But because of the multi-layered
structure at Raeburn Place, involving the Academy and the FP sports
club, the situation is very complicated,'' he said.

FIFTEEN years is a long time in any footballer's life. Fifteen years
without a major trophy seems a great deal longer to Gary Mackay, who is
Hearts' longest-serving player and still cherishes the thought that, one
day, he will be a cup-winner in a maroon shirt. He thinks, albeit
cautiously, that this could be the year.
He and his team-mates take on the Tennents Scottish Cup holders,
Dundee United, tomorrow at Tynecastle.
And, after having knocked out Rangers in the previous round, Hearts
are not lacking confidence.
Mackay accepts that the defeat of the Ibrox club has given Hearts a
huge lift in morale, but he points out, too, that it has done nothing to
harm the self-belief of the seven other quarter-finalists, either.
''This has to be our best chance yet of winning a trophy,'' he said.
''It is the most open tournament for years.''
It is 33 years since Hearts were able to hoist a major prize aloft,
the League Cup in 1962, but Gary recognises the dangers in making too
much of the memorable success in the previous round. ''It is no good
knocking them out and then tossing it away in the next round.''
0
Hearts will be without Craig Levein and Jim Bett, both suspended, and
that will be a major problem. They paid #50,000 for full back Fraser
Wishart from Rangers yesterday, but he is not eligible for the tie.
United striker Scott Crabbe looks set to start his first game since he
broke his leg a year and 11 days ago in the same tournament. Crabbe, who
sustained his injury in the tie against Motherwell, thus missed the rest
of the great run that led to success at Hampden. Manager Ivan Golac
said: ''Scott has worked tremendously hard to get back and there is
every chance he will start the game on Sunday.''

Celtic 1, Kilmarnock 0
CELTIC moved another step closer to that elusive trophy with this
victory over Kilmarnock at Hampden last night.
A penalty goal five minutes before half-time from John Collins was
just enough to carry them into the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup and
keep alive their hopes of landing their first trophy in six long, empty
years.
But, if they are to succeed in giving their fans the success they
crave so desperately, then it would appear that they will do so using
the same players who have failed so often in the past.
For, after this win, manager Tommy Burns, while stressing that he was
still looking to add three or four quality players to his squad, added:
''I doubt if we will be able to sign anyone to help us in the Scottish
Cup. Maybe we will be able to get one player in -- just maybe -- but it
is more likely that the team-strengthening I want to do will come
later.''
Burns had seen his team respond to the challenge he had laid before
them. And he had also seen the long-suffering support rally behind the
team, just as he had asked them to do.
It made for a near-perfect night for the Celtic manager and his
players. Sure, there were moments in the second half when it seemed that
Kilmarnock might score and wipe out the single-goal lead Celtic had
achieved.
If that had happened, it would have been an injustice. For this was a
match which Celtic dominated for almost the entire 90 minutes.
They began as if they were determined to sweep aside any challenge
from the Rugby Park men.
After 25 minutes came the best chance of the game. By this time Celtic
were controlling the match, putting Killie under as much pressure as
possible. This time McStay slipped a clever pass forward to Collins. He
sent the ball into the box, Falconer was there, rising alone, but
somehow he guided his header wide of the left-hand post when he should
have done better.
Even though the game was disrupted by a floodlights' failure after 34
minutes, nothing seemed able to alter the Celtic mood.
The stoppage lasted 24 minutes and, when the match resumed, Celtic
were still on the attack -- and within six minutes they had gone in
front.
In a game which showed more frenzy than finesse it was a moment of
magic from skipper Paul McStay which brought the award. A superb pass
from the midfielder sent little Brian McLaughlin racing clear of the
Kilmarnock defence and into the penalty box.
A late, despairing tackle from Tom Black sent the Celtic winger
crashing to the ground. It was a penalty -- this time there was no doubt
of that -- and, equally there was no doubt about the way Collins struck
the ball past Dragoje Lekovic for the goal which would eventually decide
the tie.
After the game Collins admitted: ''I didn't feel any pressure. I
always feel confident about taking penalties.
''I was hurt when I was dropped last Sunday and I wanted to prove the
manager wrong. I hope I did that . . .''
Certainly Killie must have wished Collins was again on the
substitutes' bench as he sent the ball into the net with a confident
flourish.
It was difficult, at that stage, to see any way back for the Ayrshire
team. Yet, somehow, for a spell in the second half Celtic allowed them
off the hook.
Pierre van Hooydonk, a constant threat to the Kilmarnock defence,
missed an opportunity for a second goal eight minutes after the break.
It was a let-off which signalled a brief revival from the Ayrshire team.
Twice inside minutes they threatened the Celtic goal. First there was
a long-range drive from Black which whipped wide, and then there was a
dangerous, low ball from Mark Reilly which swept across the face of the
goal with no-one able to reach it.
Before the end, Celtic had regained the momentum which had
characterised their play. Striker Willie Falconer, in the giant shadow
of van Hooydonk for most of the match, suddenly sprang to life. He was
close to scoring with two headers before smacking a shot against a post
two minutes from the end.
By then Mark Skilling and Dugald McCarrison had replaced Robert Connor
and Colin McKee for Kilmarnock, while Peter Grant -- the latest
midfielder to be left out by Burns -- had come on in place of Phil
O'Donnell.
At the end the fans were treated to a rare view of Celtic chief
executive Fergus McCann dashing to the touchline to congratulate every
Celtic player as they left the field.
That underlined just how vital this result had been for the Glasgow
giants, who are the first team to reach the semi-finals. Now they must
wait until tomorrow, when all the other ties have been played and the
draw is made, to find out their opponents in the last four.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, McKinlay, O'Neil, Mowbray, O'Donnell,
McLaughlin, McStay, van Hooydonk, Falconer, Collins. Substitutes --
Grant, Marshall, Walker.
KILMARNOCK -- Lekovic, Macpherson, Black, Reilly, Whitworth, Anderson,
Mitchell, Henry, McKee, Connor, Maskrey. Substitutes -- Skilling,
Geddes, McCarrison.
Referee -- K W Clark (Paisley).

JOHN Cavanagh awoke one day last month to find himself alongside busty
Babewatch belle Pamela Anderson, Coronation Street cult Reg Houldsworth,
and a young blonde woman with no clothes on. He was on Page 3 of the
Sun, the focus of a story which, in tried and tested tabloid fashion,
deployed some of the facts to obscure most of the truth.
Former antiques dealer to rescue Radio 1, said the Sun, aiming a sneer
at the station whose drastic overhaul under new-broom boss Matthew
Bannister -- and its equally drastic loss of listeners -- has made it
one of the Sun's favourite bad-news targets of late.
So who is John Cavanagh, this 30-year-old erstwhile Lovejoy? And how
come he will soon be rocking an entire nation live on Radio 1 for two
hours on Sunday evenings from his Radio Scotland base in Glasgow's Queen
Margaret Drive?
Put at its simplest, John Cavanagh is a wildly enthusiastic and hugely
knowledgeable music fan, exactly like Stewart Cruickshank, the genial
cove who will be producing John's as yet untitled show when Claire
Sturgess's spell at the Rock Show's helm ends on April 23. Indeed, if
there are two more respected figures in the Jock'n'roll continuum, I
have yet to meet them. For the ongoing Radio Scotland success-stories
that are Original Masters and Jump The Q, we salute you, sirrahs.
John's antique-trade past -- he ran a shop called Duophone in
Glasgow's Victorian Village collectors' arcade -- stems entirely from
his love of records. ''At the age of 12 or 13 I'd be going round
auctioneers' sale-rooms buying old record players and big boxes of
singles for #1. It stemmed from being unable to afford all the new
records I wanted, so I'd be searching for obscure punk rock stuff by
Eater, X-Ray Spex, and the Desperate Bicycles . . . as well as shellac
78s by Smiley Lewis. I've always had strange tastes, you see.''
Surely you must have seemed a bit strange, too, as a lone wee chappie
going mano a mano with seasoned traders in auction-rooms, no? And you
must have stood out among your schoolboy chums?
''I was . . . a little unusual. I remember being seven or eight, and
being supposed to like the Osmonds. But I actually preferred a tape I'd
made of a Pete Drummond Radio 1 show called The Sequence, featuring
Frank Zappa's Lumpy Gravy Part 2 . . . I must have played it 35 times a
day.
''When I was even younger, about four, I liked Led Zep and Deep Purple
and Eric Burdon's Monterey. Anyone who has individual or unusual tastes
should be encouraged or we'd all be playing Mariah Carey, God forbid. At
the age of 2[1/2], my first record -- bought for me by my big sister --
was David Garrick's Don't Go Out Into the Rain (You're Going To Melt,
Sugar).
''That's an important record in the history of Radio Caroline,
incidentally, and much prized by pirate radio anoraks. When Caroline
went back on air as Europe's first album station, they didn't actually
have any albums, so they had to trawl the studio floor for whatever had
been left behind . . . and, thus, David Garrick ended up as the first
record they broadcast.''
I told you John was knowledgeable, didn't I? But what of John
Cavanagh's progress to Radio 1? Having begun as a three-year-old
listening intently on headphones to Alan ''Fluff'' Freeman -- apparently
there are family-album shots to prove it -- John joined the Glasgow
Hospital Broadcasting Service in 1987.
''I did request shows, but nevertheless managed to slip in the odd
record by the Colorblind James Experience and Captain Beefheart. In
fact, one of my proudest memories is of segueing from Frank Sinatra's
mellifluous Moonlight On Vermont to Captain Beefheart's somewhat less
mellifluous Moonlight on Vermont. I nearly got shot for that.''
This revelation provokes apopleptic chuckling and coughing from the
aforementioned Cruickshank, newly returned from Radio 1's London HQ
where he has been thrashing out the forthcoming show's policy details.
His amusement is increased by John's next admission.
After a spell on Radio Scotland's Bite The Wax, John worked for Radio
Clyde, broadcasting twice-weekly on douce Clyde 2. ''It wasn't for me to
try to change the style of the station, but I had a go. I remember
playing Syd Barrett's Effervescing Elephant . . . '' Cruickshank slumps
from his seat, convulsed with laughter. Cavanagh continues.
''There was no sourness about my leaving them in order to return to
Radio Scotland -- I think Clyde quite liked me despite being unsure
about some of the tunes I played. And they did tell me at one point that
I was sounding too much like Roger Scott, which I took as a great
compliment. He's one of the greats, along with Fluff, John Peel, Janice
Long, Mark Radcliffe.
''They're all music fans and you can tell; you can hear it in their
voices. When they're on, the radio comes alive with an excitement, with
a love of music. With a lot of DJs, you sense they're on air because
they're in out of the rain. All their performance is saying is: 'Hey,
I'm a DJ! Now where's a TV game show I can host?'
''You have to have integrity, and be honest with yourself. You can't
like absolutely every record you play, but most of the records you play
have to reflect who you are, because you have to be real on air. If
there are programmes you don't have convictions about, you should get
out of them.'' And from what musical sources will John's show's realism
and honesty spring? Over to Stewart Cruickshank. ''The programme will be
a fresh, fast-paced, broad-based, forward-looking rock show, one which
takes its cue from Nirvana rather than Deep Purple. It won't be the sole
preserve of the heavy metal fraternity, as it has been so far. Quality
is the word.
''We'll play stuff by the Black Crowes, but we'll play Weezer, too.
There'll be room for the Sub Pop, post-grunge Seattle sound and for
Metallica. Newer acts like Headswim, Monster Magnet, and Green Day, and
older ones like Neil Young, the Stooges, Blue Cheer and Tom Petty.
''But not Saxon, or Celtic Frost, and definitely no Emerson Lake and
Palmer re-issues. We're not indie. We're not Radio 1 playlist. We're not
being puppeted from London. We're not pomp-rock. ''Yet rather than
saying what we're not, perhaps the most important point to note is that
the show will be properly resourced, so we'll be able to do sessions;
live music; satellite links, outside broadcasts from Barrowland and
other venues.
''There will be news packages, features, and career retrospectives --
Wayne Kramer, once of the MC5, would have been a natural for the
progamme, but the dates of his UK itinerary mean that he will have been
and gone by the time we're on air on April 30.
''It won't simply be John and a pile of discs every week. There will
be opinions from voices other than John's, although he is the
programme's anchor. There will be Scottish contributors, too, but while
we're Scottish-based, we have to remember that we're broadcasting to a
national audience who don't want tartan 'n' haggis radio from a bunch of
Scots telling them how great Scottish music is.
''Actually, at the moment Scotland doesn't have many metal bands,
possibly because we haven't had a history of them. But we do have a
tradition of guitar-based bands, from the Sensational Alex Harvey Band
to Del Amitri. And I am aware that we have a duty to good new Scottish
rock bands -- but only if they're good and new, not solely because
they're Scottish.''
If the forthcoming programme doesn't yet have a title, does it have a
motto?
John Cavanagh ponders. ''If it does, it would have to be a comic
spoken section from Lumpy Gravy: 'The way I see it, Barry, this should
be a very dynamite show.' Very dynamite, that's us.''
Not lumpy. Not grave. Very rock. Very roll. Very educated and
passionate. John Cavanagh and Stewart Cruickshank: Radio 1 is on the up.

ST JOHNSTONE fans should be given a pay day at East End Park. Before
lolly of lottery proportions enters the arena, manager Paul Sturrock was
quick to point out: ''Our supporters are due a bonus.'' Explanation now
follows.
The Perth side, with so much talent on display, have turned out to be
an enigma in the first division this season. In fact, if they had
received an old-fashioned mid-term report which used to be part and
parcel of the education system, it would read: ''Could do better.''
Victory over Dunfermline today, however, could be the start of a gold
star, end-of-term report, and put St Johnstone right back in the
promotion frame. Sturrock said: ''It's time to pay back the fans --
especially our away support -- for the Stenhousemuir Cup defeat. We have
played the best football I can remember in our last two league games,
and the players have been left in no doubt that victory over Dunfermline
will be the icing on the cake.''
Sturrock rightly reckons that winning the three points at Dunfermline
will take them within five of the lead. And since Raith Rovers, joint
top with Dundee, responded to manager Jimmy Nicholl's command of ''give
me four victories in a row'' over the festive season, and in fact have
gone on to produce nine out of 10, then anything is possible for the
Saints.
It almost goes without saying that Dunfermline have other ideas, since
victory would take them back to the top. They will have to rely on some
of their younger players as Ivo Den Biemen, Paul Smith, and Stewart
Petrie are suspended, and Tommy Harrison is out with a knee injury.
Three 19-year-olds come into the reckoning for a place -- Mark
McCulloch, Craig Smart, and Andy Hawkins, all budding midfield maestros.
It is just as hectic at the other end of the table, with bottom two
Stranraer and St Mirren meeting at Stair Park to start again after their
match was abandoned last week, and Clydebank entertaining Ayr United.
Stranraer have Tom Callaghan and Tony Gallagher available after
injury, but will have to do without the suspended Nigel Howard and John
McCaffrey. St Mirren go with the squad which started last week's match.
Victory at Clydebank for Simon Stainrod's men would really put the
relegation issue into turmoil, especially since Bankies are looking good
after two away victories, giving them a seven-point cushion in fourth
bottom spot over today's rivals.
Stainrod, straight-talking as usual, said: ''We must make sure that we
do ourselves a favour.'' He added with hardly any hesitation: ''Since I
decided to play again, I have managed to make sure the team has more
composure. It's easier to do that when you are on the field.''
It will be Stainrod's third consecutive game, and it seemed pointless
to ask him whether or not he was enjoying himself.

MY daughters were badgering Sheila and me about holidays the other
day. We have a real problem in our family, as we all want a different
type of holiday. Unusual that, in a family with two teenagers, isn't it?
Suggestions were many and varied, encompassing shopping, sunshine, and
other places where new people might be met, boys particularly, and,
rather unsurprisingly, not one of their ideas even remotely had any
connection with fishing.
I thought back to my own early teenage holidays with the revered
parents, and although they seldom opted for trips with fishing or
meeting girls in mind, I usually managed to do both.
Now, I'm one of these boring anglers who tends to remember those
holidays of long ago for the fishing outings rather than the romances.
In truth, I did not have many of either over the years but both had one
thing in common; they were usually unexpected, sometimes illicit, and
always great fun.
Once in Austria, at a set of traffic-lights in Innsbruck, a girl held
up a piece of paper with ''Were frae Scotland to'' written in lipstick.
I didn't really fancy the way she looked, her punctuation or her
spelling, so that romance was domed, sorry, doomed, from the start.
But one holiday ''romance'' I fondly remember was one forged with the
head-waiter of the Sport Hotel in Igls, just up the valley from
Innsbruck. One morning after breakfast, he looked into my dad's car and
spotted that international dialling card, the fishing-rod.
He spoke a little English and we got on the chat about the comparative
merits of Austrian and Scottish trout. I was told that it was no
contest. Those in the Sill, a tributary of the River Inn, just down the
valley, were second to none. Indeed, with my parents' permission, he'd
take me there with his own son next afternoon and prove it to me.
Permission was wheedled and granted.
We met at the appointed hour, Jurgen and son Karl, and the three of us
set off over the fields with all our gear. Mine was fairly basic . . . a
fly-rod and reel, a few flies and some Thomson tackles, those two hook
wonders that served me well on Lyne and Tweed.
First stop would be for ''a tasty bite for the trout''. It was in the
corner of one of the fields, that magnet for all trout fishers, a
dunghill. The cowbells were tinkling in the distance as we turned over
the warm, reeking pile in search of brandling worms. Jurgen divided them
into three little tins filled with grass and we were off to the water.
The Sill was a small rocky stream with a distinctly milky look, and I
wondered how any trout would see bait in it. But the alacrity with which
the father and son tackled-up convinced me that they knew more than I.
A six-foot leader on the end of my fly-line, a few split-shot and a
couple of worms was the order of the day and Jurgen pointed to a pool
below a couple of large rocks and told me to put the ''wrigglers'' in
there and to be ready for the thrill of a lifetime.
In a second, the pink brandlings were out of sight and I soon felt
them trundling along the bottom. They then shot off across the stream
and I had hooked my first Austrian trout. It was about half a pound and
as silver as a sea trout. It jumped and cartwheeled about the pool for a
minute and then came to the net, wielded by Karl. Whoops of delight,
much backslapping and handshaking.
Looking back, it was a thrilling afternoon. We all caught a fish or
two, taking it in turns to fish the pools. They were beautiful trout,
all silver sheen and gold of fin, and about the same size as my average
Scottish fish at the time. Jurgen let us lads have most of the action,
and as we made our way back up to the hotel with our fish, he promised
to cook them for the guests that night.
There was great ceremony as the fish were brought into the dining-room
on a silver salver. It was announced in English and German to the
assembled diners that the fish had been caught by our own fair hand and
the applause was warm and friendly. Everyone had a taste of trout and
seemed to enjoy it.
I asked Jurgen how much was due for the permit for the fishing and was
given the knowing wink. There was, he said, no need to give money to
those who didn't know that we had been fishing. Poached trout, in both
meanings of the word. As I said, unexpected, illicit and great fun.

STIRLING Albion manager Kevin Drinkell may be tempted today to cast
his mind back to the last time Berwick Rangers visited Forthbank. On
that occasion, in mid-October, a 3-2 victory allowed Albion to leapfrog
over their visitors to the top of the division.
The situation this time is that Stirling need to beat Berwick in order
to remain in contention for promotion.
On the same 37-point mark, six behind the leaders, are Clyde. They are
at home to Brechin in a fixture which would have looked straightforward
a month ago. But City are staging a rally which could give them hope of
avoiding relegation.
Morton could go top by beating Queen of the South, who have gone six
games without a win at Dumfries.
There is very little promotion hope left for East Fife, who have gone
seven games without a win. Dean Robertson will replace suspended keeper
Ewan Wilson at Meadowbank.
The third division leaders, Forfar, have Jamie Loney on loan from
promotion rivals East Stirlingshire and he will play at Cowdenbeath.
'Shire have acquired Paul McLaren from Forfar and he will be included
for the visit to Arbroath, who will be seeking a fifth straight win
under John Brogan.
Hugh McCann takes charge of Queen's Park for the first time and their
opponents at Hampden are his old team Alloa.
Montrose should stay in the promotion hunt at the expense of their
visitors from Inverness, Caley Thistle, but an 8am inspection has been
arranged at Dingwall for second-placed Ross County's match against
Albion Rovers.

PETERHEAD would jump to the top of the Highland League with an away
win against Huntly this afternoon. Few, however, would bet against
Huntly securing their second successive championship even if they did
lose.
The problem for second-placed Peterhead, who are struggling because of
a flu virus, is that they are equal on points with Huntly but have
played five games more. A Huntly defeat would give more hope to Cove
Rangers, but it will take a few more dropped points before anyone
worries for the Strathbogie club.
Third-placed Cove should be at full strength as they bid to keep their
title ambitions alive with a win at home to Keith.
Meanwhile, Reading are the latest club to make an approach for
Huntly's Martin Stewart but their request to have him on a week's trial
has been rejected. Manager Steve Paterson feels his 21-year-old, 22-goal
striker has nothing to prove and will listen only to firm bids.
With Motherwell, Kilmarnock, and Bolton also in the chase a bid may
come sooner rather than later.

<HEADLINE>Hide's incentive is a Tyson fight</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979452021</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HERBIE Hide could move to the front of the queue to fight Mike Tyson
if he can shock America by seeing off Riddick Bowe at the MGM Grand
Garden, Las Vegas, in the early hours of tomorrow morning.
Tyson will walk free from his three-year detention in Plainfield,
Indiana, in just two weeks' time and there has been a report that Frank
Bruno is in line for a Tyson fight in September. But Bruno has no title
to offer and Tyson probably would not want to go straight in with one of
the biggest punchers.
Bigger in the money stakes would be Tyson against IBF king George
Foreman, Bowe, or WBC holder Oliver McCall.
Bowe has much better credentials than Hide. Olympic silver medallist,
two great battles with Evander Holyfield, major championship experience,
size, power, and proven.
Hide, ABA finalist, is largely unproven despite being unbeaten and
taking the WBO title in style by knocking out Michael Bentt a year ago.
The 23-year-old champion must have a jab-and-move strategy. To stand
and trade with Bowe, almost two stones heavier, would be madness.
Holyfield, due to make his comeback on May 20, said: ''Hide is a good
mover and will give Bowe problems. I do not think 1-6 odds on Bowe are
realistic. Hide has to use the ring and has the style to win.''
Hide forecasts: ''I'm fast and can punch. I think I'll keep my title
with a late stoppage or by a points verdict.''
Bowe says: ''My dream is to fight Holyfield again, but first it could
be Jorge Luis Gonzales in June. After that the sky's the limit. It will
be great for boxing when Tyson comes out. He'll bring a lot of
excitement back.''

SAM Torrance, with a quick change from trousers to waterproofs after
six holes, shared the lead with Swede Robert Karlsson after two rounds
of the Moroccan Open in Agadir yesterday.
The 41-year-old Scot shot 70 and Karlsson 69 in heavy rain which left
them on 137, seven under par and one shot ahead of overnight leader
Alexander Cejka, who, despite having dry weather for 17 holes, could
manage only a 72.
''You don't expect wet weather in Morocco. I didn't even bring a
sweater,'' said Torrance. ''The conditions were horrific, wet and
freezing.
''I don't like wearing waterproofs and I played in my ordinary
trousers for six holes but they got so wet I had to take them off.
Fortunately there was a tent between the sixth green and the seventh
tee. I had a quick change and wore waterproof trousers for the rest of
the round.
''It wasn't a great day to play golf and you had to show great
patience and resolve, but I kept my concentration.''
Torrance and Ryder Cup colleague Mark James played in a two-ball
between a field of three-balls because playing partner, South African
Wayne Westner, withdrew with a pulled rib muscle.
''It was terribly slow, but you just have to get on with it,'' said
Torrance, who had four birdies, at the eighth, tenth, fifteenth, and
eighteenth, with only two bogeys and was pleased with the last two
holes.
''At the seventeenth I went over the back with a sand wedge into a
terrible lie, but I chipped back to six feet and holed the putt for a
par. Then I hit a No.2 iron and a No.7 iron to 15 feet at the last and
holed that for a birdie.''
Karlsson, the tallest man on the European Tour, had three birdies and
not a single bogey in his 69. ''This is my tournament,'' said the winner
of the Open Mediterrania in Valencia two weeks ago. ''I was second in
1992, fourth in 93, and third last year. All I want to do now is to fill
in the missing number one.''
James had second successive 70 for 140 and joint fourth place.
Andrew Coltart was five off the pace after a 72, Adam Hunter moved up
to 143 after a 68, and Ross Drummond repaired his opening 77 with a 69,
but it was heartbreak for East Kilbride's Craig Ronald who missed the
cut by one shot, following his opening 70 with a 78. Leading scores
(British or Irish unless stated):
137 -- R Karlsson (Sweden) 68, 69; S Torrance 67, 70.
138 -- A Cejka (Germany) 66, 72.
140 -- M James 70, 70; M Mackenzie 68, 72; G Levenson (S Africa) 69,
71.

AFTER four decades of investigation, inquiry, theory and speculation
into the mystery at the coastal village of Whiteabbey, five miles north
of Belfast, only two things are certain. One is that Patricia Curran,
the 19-year-old daughter of a High Court judge, was murdered with 37
stab wounds on the night of November 12, 1952. The other is that a
Scottish serviceman, leading airman Iain Hay Gordon, was found guilty
but insane and sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty's Pleasure.
Many other questions remain unanswered. The trial itself, in March
1953 at Belfast Crown Court, is remarkable for the gaps it left
unexamined and uncontested, a confession that was uncorroborated, and
for key witnesses that were never called or were never cross-examined.
It might by now have drifted into the history of fascinating but
insoluble cases, but for the survival of two key figures.
Iain Hay Gordon is alive in Glasgow after working 31 years in the city
under an assumed name, protesting his innocence and fighting a new
campaign, supported by Glasgow Maryhill MP, Maria Fyfe, to clear his
name. Desmond Curran, the elder brother who found the body of Patricia,
is alive in South Africa, having worked there as a missionary for the
last 30 years. He sticks by the evidence he gave at the trial, and the
vital information he gave to police, which had a crucial bearing on
Gordon's arrest and conviction.
The last sentence of Gordon's alleged confession, obtained after three
days of intensive interrogation, contained the phrase, '' . . . if I am
spared, I shall redeem my past life.'' It is one of the few parts of the
confession that Gordon claims he actually wrote, and the supporters of
his campaign have maintained since the early 1950s that the rest was
obtained through extreme duress and put in his name by detectives.
Nevertheless, that one phrase presents a possible double irony. By
coincidence, both Gordon and Desmond Curran started radically new lives
eight years after the murder. In 1960, Gordon was quietly released from
Holywell Mental Hospital in County Antrim and put on a plane back to
Scotland. At the same time, Desmond Curran was being ordained as a
priest in Rome.
His conversion to Roman Catholicism must have come as a shock to his
staunchly presbyterian family. His father, Lord Justice Lancelot Curran,
had been a Unionist MP for the Carrick Division of County Antrim and
Attorney General for Northern Ireland before being appointed a High
Court judge in 1949. Following in his father's footsteps, Desmond Curran
took his law degree and started out in 1952 as a barrister.
The eminence of the Currans seemed to have an intimidatory effect on
the defence mounted at Gordon's trial, when his senior counsel, Mr H. R.
McVeigh, QC, made it a condition of taking on the case that he would not
be required to cross-examine any member of the Curran family. The
campaign mounted in 1958 for Gordon's release was rounded upon in the
Ulster Senate. Senator P. McGill referred to ''the unfortunate and
tragic position'' in which an esteemed family had been placed by the
publication of a most distressing case.
There are stages in the police investigation, the trial and the
subsequent political handling of the affair which suggest that this
''esteem'' towards the Currans was pervasive. Police never examined the
family home until two to three days after the discovery of the body,
recently obtained official Stormont memos have revealed. The conduct of
the family on the night of the discovery of the body escaped close
examination at the trial, but it is exactly at these moments in the
early hours of November 13, 1952, that the controversy begins.
It had been a drizzly Wednesday night. The unlit drive up to the
Curran mansion, Glen House, was shrouded by trees that made a dark
canopy. Wind rustled among leaves and bushes. Justice Curran would tell
the next day's Belfast Telegraph that he had been making telephone
calls. His daughter Patricia had not returned from Belfast. She had been
at Queen's University where she was in the first year of a social
sciences M.A. degree. At what precise time these telephone calls began
has never been established, but the trial would hear that the alarm
never went up until 1.30 am. when a family search party was organised in
the ten acres of the estate grounds. Desmond Curran testified he was
awoken and sent for a torch.
That serious concern was this late in prompting action might have
seemed odd. Patricia travelled by bus, and the last service from Belfast
arrived in the village of Whiteabbey at 11.20 pm. Stranger, perhaps, was
that one of Justice Curran's telephone calls was at 1.40 am to the
family solicitor, Malcolm Davison, four miles away in the village of
Greenisland. Another call was to his younger son, Michael, who was
summoned to come from Belfast. It is unclear at what stage in this
sequence a further call was made to local police. Justice Curran was
never called to testify at the trial.
The search produced an extraordinary convergence. The trial was told
that at precisely the moment that Desmond Curran reached the spot where
the body of his sister lay, in bushes off the quarter-mile of drive,
there arrived simultaneously Justice Curran on foot, family solicitor
Davison and his wife by car, and a police constable riding up on
bicycle. ''It was as if, at the same time,'' Davison testified in court,
''Mr Justice Curran and the constable entered from somewhere.''
What they saw was Desmond Curran raising the blood-stained body. At
the trial he testified that he thought he heard sounds of breathing. The
body was carried to Davison's car, but there was difficulty. The legs
were stiff. Undaunted by the certainty that rigor mortis indicates
death, or by the cardinal rule that bloodied bodies should be left for
the examination of pathologists and police, the High Court judge, his
barrister son and the family solicitor left the constable guarding the
spot while the body of Patricia was driven to the local doctor. He
pronounced her to have been killed by shotgun wounds, an unfortunate
mistake, given the 37 stab wounds. Amidst the tragedy there was a seam
of sinister farce. Patricia Curran was buried two days later. The
investigation was not getting off to the best of starts.
It can be imagined with what private thoughts County Inspector Albert
Kennedy told reporters that, since the body had ''been removed'', he
could not say whether there were any indications of struggle. It was not
until the February 14 early editions that police were able to correct
first reports of Patricia Curran having been shot in the chest and
abdomen. The 37 stab wounds were said to have been inflicted by a
stiletto-like weapon, a paper-knife or a lancet. But despite the
manifest confusion, police said from the outset that ''it had been
established'' that the girl died at 5.45pm on Wednesday, November 12.
This specific timing would become crucial in the case against Gordon.
His confession, obtained a full three months later, would confirm the
same time to the minute for his alleged murder of Patricia Curran. On
the day the body was discovered, it was a stubborn and remarkably
prescient accuracy on the part of the police, because it arbitrated
uncannily between two post mortem reports which estimated death, in the
first, at between 11 pm and midnight, and in the second, at around 5 pm.
That the investigation proceeded on the basis of a 5.45pm murder had a
simple logic. Patricia Curran, it emerged in earliest inquiries, was
last seen alive getting off the bus in Whiteabbey. It had reached the
village from Belfast just after 5.20 pm. She was last sighted as she
walked towards the gates of the drive to the family home of Glen House.
From the start, the investigation assumed that she had never reached the
house. However, no member of the Curran family could confirm this
positively, since their alibis established them as away from home in the
earlier part of the evening.
The lack of forensic or blood evidence was puzzling. Only three drops
of blood were found on leaves near where the multiply-stabbed body was
found. Patricia's watch had been broken, and the hands and winder were
never found. Neither would a murder weapon ever be produced before or
after the trial. The 37 wounds were widespread and indiscriminate, but
there were none on the hands and arms of the victim, and there were no
scratch marks on the legs. Her stockings were not laddered. There was no
evidence on the body of a sexual assault.
Early statements by Sir Richard Pym, Inspector General of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, indicated considerable doubt over whether Patricia
had been murdered at the exact spot where her body was found. It was
''clear'' her body had been ''carried''. Her possessions, a yellow
beret, portfolio and handbag, had been found placed alongside. All these
details would prove important when it came to testing the validity of
Gordon's confession.
Iain Gordon was never an early suspect in the police investigation. A
political motive for the murder as an act of revenge against Justice
Curran was one of the first considered. In the next few days, appeals
were issued for information about a scar-faced man; then a man with
grass seeds in his hair. Police said they had not ruled out the
possibility the murderer was a woman. A description was given of a man
with an educated Northern Ireland accent. They wanted to trace the
driver of an Austin 10 who drove away from the village at speed. The
evident lack of direction did not help to suppress the ''wildest
rumours'' circulating Belfast and Whiteabbey, according to a report in
the Belfast Newsletter.
Scotland Yard were called in before the end of the first week.
Although Superintendent John Capstick was officially ''assisting'' the
RUC's investigation team under County Inspector Kennedy, it was clear to
many that he would take control. He was a murder specialist with a high
record of success. He arrived in Belfast with Detective-Sergeant Dennis
Hawkins, confident of cracking the case quickly. In this they would be
disappointed.
A measure of their desperation by early December was the flight to
Manchester by Capstick and Kennedy to interview a man in custody who had
confessed to murdering Patricia Curran. After 15 minutes of interviews,
the detectives admitted a ''wild goose chase'' and returned to Northern
Ireland. The same day there appeared the unconvincing report that
''police now believe they are on a 'definite line' in Whiteabbey.'' On
the last day of the year, Sir Richard Pym was offering a #1000 reward
for information leading to conviction.
On January 14, 1953, it was announced that Capstick and Hawkins would
be returning to London on Saturday, after two months on the case. A
total of 40,000 witnesses had been interviewed, and 9000 statements
taken. There was no indication if this was because they were suddenly
confident that the case would be cracked by the weekend, or if they were
being recalled because the trail had gone cold. A dramatic development
was about to unfold. The very next day Capstick and Hawkins completed
intensive interrogations to secure the confession that would convict
Gordon.
It must have been with relief that the inquiry seized on Iain Hay
Gordon. Stationed at the nearby RAF camp of Edenmore, he was 20 and due
to complete his national service in May. His duties at the camp were
clerical, and he was responsible for delivering and collecting camp mail
in the village of Whiteabbey. The son of a civil engineer father and a
schoolteacher mother, he had not excelled at school at Dollar Academy,
and he had done a year at Glasgow Tutorial College when he was called
up.
He was described as a nervous type, awkward, sensitive and gullible. A
loner. A respectable middle distance runner, and a member of the
Hillfoots Athletics Club in his Dollar days, there was an account at the
trial of how he had been overcome by nerves and confusion while leading
a one-mile race, stopping dead to allow a commanding lead to be
overtaken. ''I was not street wise,'' Gordon says today.
At Edenmore camp, he was a perennial wind-up victim. Another story
which emerged at the trial was that he had once been persuaded it was
necessary to show L-plates on his bicycle. Subsequently, he fractured
his skull in an accident on the machine. He had no history of violence,
other than a black eye he had received in a scrap with another
serviceman. He was what RAF contemporaries of the early 1950s would
call, and did call, a ''clot''.
Gordon was unrepresented throughout the interrogations. He faced nine
detectives, but Capstick was running the show. ''I hated to use what
might well seem like ruthless methods,'' Capstick wrote years later of
the Gordon interrogation in an article for Empire News in 1958,
prompting questions over breach of confidentiality at Stormont. His
note, read out at the 1953 trial, records that ''masturbation, gross
indecency and sodomy'' were the subjects upon which Gordon was
questioned at length on the morning of his confession. This was the
third day of his interrogation. It had occupied a total of 19 hours,
according to Hawkins and Capstick at the trial. At least 25 hours,
Gordon claims today. They told him he was going to hell. Mentally
exhausted, he began to believe them.
Two things broke him. His alibi was destroyed the day before. Gordon
admitted, and still admits, he lied about an alibi, damaging his case
considerably. His explanation was, and is, that he had naively
interpreted an instruction at the camp for the men to sort themselves
out with alibis. His false alibi, Corporal Henry Connor, was also under
intense interrogations during which, he claimed in a later statement to
private investigators working for the campaign to release Gordon, that
he had been separately accused of the murder.
The second vulnerability was Gordon's sexual guilt. He admitted
frequenting prostitutes in Belfast. He had also had three homosexual
dalliances with a shady figure in the village called Wesley Courtenay. A
psychiatrist would later draw little significance from these
''transitional adolescent episodes.'' Gordon had at least one regular
girlfriend in Belfast. But it is clear that Capstick and his team
exploited Gordon's terrible fear of lurid details being revealed to his
mother. This was a crucial lever in extracting his confession. Capstick
told the trial under cross-examination, ''He [Gordon] was broken down on
masturbation.'' This moral pressure had come from details supplied by
informants. One was the Rev S. J. Wylie, Minister of the Presbyterian
Church at Whiteabbey, who for a while acted as a mentor and confidant
for Gordon, until the young serviceman was advised by chaplains to
refuse the minister's visits while he was awaiting trial in Crumlin Road
Prison, Belfast. Wylie is another curious figure in the mystery, now
dead after a sudden departure for Canada in 1959, leaving his wife for
another woman.
The other informant, as Capstick revealed years later in his Empire
News article, was Desmond Curran, the brother who had found the body of
Patricia. It was this disclosure that infuriated Stormont in 1958.
Nationalist MP Mr R. H. O'Connor described the article as containing
information from private ''conferences'' between Capstick and the Curran
family. This certainly begs more questions than it answers.
It must have surprised detectives when they first learned that Curran,
the eldest son of one of Whiteabbey's most distinguished families and a
barrister, was a personal friend of Iain Hay Gordon, the RAF clerk. They
had met on a number of occasions, at Glen House and in Belfast.
The story Gordon told Police, and still maintains today, is that
Desmond Curran first approached him after a service preached by Wylie at
the Presbyterian Church. He offered a left-handed shake and introduced
himself. Then he invited Gordon to lunch at Glen House. Gordon denies
any homosexual involvement with Desmond Curran, although he would later
confide to him the advances made by Courtenay. Both Gordon and Curran,
in a recent documentary made by BBC Northern Ireland, deny any knowledge
of an alleged homosexual ring operating in Whiteabbey at the time of the
murder. Gordon claims, and Curran confirms, that the primary motive was
to interest the serviceman in Moral Rearmament, a movement promoting
absolute private and public morality. Curran was a member.
Gordon was never recruited, but this would be the first of a series of
meetings, and through his association with Desmond the young airman
would be introduced to other members of the Curran family. Justice
Curran was ''austere, Victorian''. Mrs Curran seemed a little put out
that lunch arrangements had to accommodate an unannounced visitor.
Michael Curran, the younger brother, was surly, instructing Gordon to
help with washing up because there were no servants, and scolding him
after the almost inevitable breakage of a plate by the accident-prone
guest. Patricia Curran, according to Gordon, exhibited more social
graces than the rest of the family put together. ''She was the only
normal one there,'' he says today.
In the confession he gave to Capstick, witnessed by County Inspector
Kennedy, Gordon claims he met Patricia Curran after she had got off the
bus from Belfast at 5.20 pm on November 12. She asked him to accompany
her up the drive to Glen House because it was dark. He held her hand.
She did not object. He asked her for a kiss. She laid her handbag,
portfolio and yellow beret on the grass verge of the drive. They kissed.
Patricia asked to continue up the drive. Gordon could not stop kissing.
He touched her breast. She called him a ''beast''. He lost control. She
fell down sobbing. She appeared to have fainted because she went limp.
The rest was hazy. He remembered dragging her into the bushes. ''I was
confused at the time and believe I stabbed her once or twice with my
service knife. I had been carrying this in my trouser pocket. I am not
sure what kind of a knife it was.'' He was disturbed by hearing
footsteps or seeing a light. Then he crossed the main road and threw the
knife into Belfast Lough. He returned to Edenmore camp, arriving at his
billet at roughly 6.30 pm. He practised some typing for a trade
examination and went to bed.
Such was the confession. If the spot of typing was not a blase enough
way to finish up an evening's murdering, then Gordon's visit to the
cinema the next night to see Elizabeth Taylor in The Light Fantastic (as
he tells his father in a letter written on the Sunday after the murder)
is cool behaviour for a man with a proven nervous disposition. Today
Gordon maintains, as he has maintained for 42 years, that the confession
was false.
He claims that it was dictated by Capstick. There were changes to some
wordings when he was instructed to read it back to Capstick and Kennedy,
changes like ''went'' for ''proceeded'' because it sounded less
legalistic. It had been a series of hypothetical questions and answers.
''I did not see the trap I was falling into,'' says Gordon today. The
confession was the single most important piece of evidence against
Gordon at the trial. There was nothing else to connect him with the
crime, except an identification (at a parade three months later, and
after his photograph had appeared in newspapers when he was charged) by
a witness who said she had seen a pale-faced man leave the gates to the
drive of Glen House. This identification has been widely discredited.
The tentative and unspecific reference in the confession to the kind
of knife Gordon is alleged to have used is interesting, in that police
never did produce a murder weapon. A Belfast local historian and a
former RAF serviceman, Bobby Devlin, who has written on the case, points
out that there was no issue of service knives in the RAF after the end
of the Second World War. The only knives Gordon recalls having at
Edenmore were his canteen irons and a wooden paper knife for his
clerical duties. The latter, despite early reference to stiletto-like
wounds in pathology reports, would seem an unlikely implement for such a
sustained and violent attack on Patricia Curran, a strong and athletic
young woman. One of her fatal wounds had smashed a rib.
The reference in the confession to being disturbed ''by footsteps or
by a light'' is the detail which encouraged the prosecution to present
the time of the murder at exactly 5.45pm. An 11-year-old newspaper
delivery boy, George Chambers, testified that he heard strange noises in
the bushes as he returned down the drive with his new torch. This was
shortly before he heard the factory hooter go off at 5.45 pm. The
prosecution argued that what he heard was the sound of Patricia Curran
being dragged into the bushes by Gordon.
The Currans' mail box had been moved from Glen House to further down
the drive to accommodate postal and newspaper deliveries. It was
positioned less than 75 yards from the spot where the body was found. It
is odd that young George Chambers saw nothing of the couple allegedly
negotiating a kiss on the drive as he went up, or heard anything of
their argument and struggle. Every bit as strange is that his new torch
failed to pick out a bright yellow beret, a portfolio and a handbag
close by the spot where he heard alarming noises. According to the
confession, these articles were allegedly laid down by Patricia Curran
before her body was dragged off into the bushes. Chambers' testimony
would appear to cast more doubt on the confession than it supports the
prosecution case, but Gordon's defence failed to draw attention to the
anomalies.
A total of nine journeys were made past this spot before the body was
discovered at 2 am. After Chambers, there were eight opportunities for
someone to spot Patricia Curran's items on the verge, 11 inches from the
side of a drive wide enough for only a single vehicle. Nobody did, even
with the assistance of car headlights.
The catalogue of failed observation is curious. Justice Curran arrived
home from the Courts by taxi at 7.20 pm. His taxi driver returned down
the drive. Desmond Curran got back from the court library, where he had
been seen by witnesses, at 8.50 pm. Mrs Curran's movements were never
fully established, and like her husband she never testified, but she was
reported to have spent the evening playing bridge with the ubiquitous
Davisons, the family solicitor and his wife, before driving home up the
drive. Desmond Curran and Mrs Curran drove down the drive after 1. 30 am
when the alarm was first raised. Justice Curran walked down the drive
searching. Michael Curran arrived from Belfast after the body was found,
according to Justice Curran's statement to reporters on February 13.
More questions might have been answered had not Gordon's defence
opted, from the beginning, for a case resting on insufficient evidence
to convict, but if the accused was guilty he was ''insane in the legal
sense''. Medical evidence was presented at the week-long trial in March,
1953, of Gordon suffering hypoglycaemia and schizophrenia. He would be
prone to blackouts. Murder was still a hanging offence in 1953. Lord
Chief Justice MacDermott drew the jury's attention to the option of
''guilty but insane''. The jury took only two hours to return that
verdict.
Mrs Brenda Gordon, the mother of the convicted man, spent over #3,600
(on a teacher's salary in the 1950s) in legal fees, medical specialist
fees and the hiring of a private detective, between the trial and 1957,
to try to prove Gordon's innocence and secure his release. He was held
in Holywell Mental Hospital, County Antrim, as a criminal lunatic, but
from a relatively early stage he was subject to surprisingly light
security. It became clear that the hospital authorities believed neither
in his insanity nor his guilt. A petition for his release was rejected
by Minister of Home Affairs, Mr W. W. B. Topping, in 1958. Official
reports on Gordon's sanity continued to cause embarrassment.
An investigation by Duncan Webb for The People in 1958 appeared to
have uncovered sensational evidence from Glen House, sold by the Currans
shortly after the murder. Webb took away floorboards from what had been
Patricia Curran's bedroom for analysis, but tests could not establish if
dark staining had been caused by human blood or varnish. There were
calls in the Ulster Senate for a ban on imported newspapers. In the
Commons, Home Affairs Minister Topping was asked for an inquiry into the
Gordon case by the Unionist MP for Windsor, Mr H. V. Kirk, to ''dispel
once and for all the gossip or otherwise which exists.''
The quiet release of Gordon in 1960, to the custody of his parents now
in Glasgow, did nothing to abate gossip, rumours and disquiet which
continue in Northern Ireland to this very day. It remains a cause
celebre there, yet it has only periodically attracted outside media
interest. James Fox wrote a major account for the Sunday Times magazine
in 1968. Ludovic Kennedy prepared a report, including an interview with
Gordon, for television in 1970, and it was revealed in the Commons that
the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, Major Chichester-Clark, had written
in protest to the BBC. The programme was postponed, then dropped. It has
never been shown. Justice Curran died in 1984. His knighthood had been
received in 1964.
The controversy was revived this January with the showing in Northern
Ireland of a two-part BBC documentary for the Home Truths series, not
networked but offered to BBC Scotland. The two one-hour programmes,
produced and directed by Bruce Batten, revealed for the first time that
Desmond Curran had been among police suspects for the murder of his
sister before being eliminated from inquiries. Batten located him in the
black township of Khayelitsha, near Cape Town, where he maintained his
belief that Gordon had carried out the murder. Curran and Gordon were
filmed together, in a reunion organised for the programmes. Curran based
his belief on Gordon's guilt on the Scotsman's confided admission that
he carried a knife to defend himself from persecution at Edenmore
because of his accent. Gordon says that no such admission was ever made
to Curran.
Iain Gordon worked for 31 years as a warehouseman with William Collins
the publishers in Bishopbriggs. His interview for the job was with the
company managing director, W. Hope Collins, a wartime intelligence
officer, and a condition was that he work under an assumed name, John
Gordon, and retain a silence about his criminal background. He retired a
few years ago without any blemishes to his career. ''John was maybe a
bit of a weird guy, a bit soft, sometimes obedient to a fault, but a
good worker,'' said Mr Willie Millar, personnel manager at Collins, who
was amazed to learn recently of Gordon's history.
But there had been problems of adjustment after the release. Gordon
faced three charges of indecent exposure in the 1960s in Glasgow. In
terms of the credibility of his campaign he accepts that these incidents
were a case of ''shooting myself in the foot''. Unmarried, he has formed
a close friendship with a woman in Glasgow.
Father Desmond Curran has an exemplary record working in the townships
of South Africa, where he is held in the highest affection and respect.
Syd Duvall, of the Cape Town Archdiocese, describes Father Curran as
''very pious, a temperance man, very serious about his work.'' He has
learned the very difficult language of Xhosa, with its contortions of
clicking sounds, and he leads a spartan existence, without a telephone.
For a year in Khayelitsha, he was living in a freight container without
electricity or running water, using a chemical toilet and calor gas for
lighting and fuel. He is known in the townships as Isibane (The Lamp).
Iain Gordon says: ''I have nothing to hide. The more people I tell
about all of this, the more it will snowball. This is the first time I
have been in charge of my own affairs, and I'm continuing a campaign
that my mother started. I'm determined to keep going for as long as it
takes to clear my name, until my dying day if necessary.''
Father Curran was contacted this week. Asked if he had seen the
documentary films sent from BBC Northern Ireland, he replied: ''Yes. But
I am not making any comment.'' Asked a further question, he hung up.

AFTER a fierce head-to-head fight Spain's Carlos Sainz snatched a
12-second victory in the closing stages of the Rallye de Portugal from
Finn Juha Kankkunen, after three days and 460 kilometres of competitive
driving.
Sainz, driving a four-wheel-drive Impreza for the Banbury-based Subaru
team, now has a three-point lead in the world championship after three
of the 10 rounds.
He began yesterday 22 seconds behind Kankkunen, but drew level with
three stages to go. The former world champion then threw out both spare
wheels to lighten his car before the last two special stages.
In the final speed test Sainz lost his front brakes after having hit a
rock. Forced to slow, he was convinced the rally was lost. Only when he
saw his mechanics with a bottle of champagne at the stage finish did he
realise he had done enough.
Colin McRae won the battle for third place in his Impreza despite
hitting a bank.
On their first visit to Portugal Richard Burns and Perth's Robert
Reid, driving an Impreza, finished seventh.
Final positions after 31 stages: 1, C Sainz/L Moya (Subaru Impreza)
5hr 32min 37sec; 2, J Kankkunen/N Grist (Toyota Celica) 5-32-49; 3, C

SMALL, balding, dressed in black, and very jet-lagged, Alan Rudolph
still managed to overflow with enthusiasm for the heroine of his latest
film, Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle, and the actress who plays her.
It is the story of the impossible woman who reigned over the famous
Round Table in the Algonquin Hotel on 44th Street, Manhattan, during the
Jazz Age -- Dorothy Parker. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an inspired
performance as Dorothy, managing to convey the fact that she was both an
alluring and utterly impossible human being.
Rare must be the person who cannot quote, or possibly more accurately,
misquote, one of Dorothy's bons mots. About a lavish party: ''One more
drink and I would have been under the host.'' About a Yale Prom: ''If
all those sweet young things were laid end to end I wouldn't be at all
surprised.''
Dorothy Parker, who wrote for Vanity Fair, helped Harold Ross to found
the New Yorker in 1925, and worked for it as a critic for years, went on
to become a successful screenwriter in Hollywood. She died in 1967, aged
74, an American legend, and yet the legend has never been the subject of
a Hollywood film. What prompted Rudolph, whose 14 films include Remember
My Name, The Moderns, and Choose Me, to take on the job?
''Because, like Everest, she was there,'' he said. ''In America's
cultural history -- that sounds like an oxymoron, there are more morons
than oxes these days -- I think the Algonquin Round Table and what it
meant, and the ripple effect of its influence, is probably in the top 50
events of the twentieth century. There are two possible films about
Dorothy Parker. One would have been Her Greatest Hits. The other is this
one, which is part factual reality.''
He explained that by saying his favourite moment of any movie was when
the main character was alone and there was no way of knowing what was
going on. In the case of Parker, she had left no autobiographical
writing, no memoirs, no diaries, no family, so one had to invent.
''For me she is the first modern American woman,'' he added. ''Dorothy
could out-think, out-drink, out-love, any man, and yet she was not a
feminist. In her own limited way all she wanted to do was find some true
love. It is, however, easy to say 'What is all the fuss about?' because
her work consists of one slim volume of original work outside her
criticism and reviews.''
Rudolph believes that the true love of the thrice-married Parker was
the critic and comic performer, Robert Benchley, played by Campbell
Scott, her soul-mate for some 20 years, although never her lover. ''The
most fascinating aspect of her life is her relationship with Benchley,''
he said. ''She did not like Benchley's wife, or the fact that he lived
in the suburbs, but she needed him to be married. She needed the
stability of his marriage in her own life. In an era where the motto was
Anything Goes they never became lovers and that is remarkable. They were
friends.
''She did fall in love with Charles McArthur, the writer and
journalist, who was just a rogue. She had an abortion. She tried to
commit suicide, and she became a big drunk after that.''
The amazing thing about Parker, born Dorothy Rothschild -- Eddie
Parker was her first husband -- whose mother died when she was five,
whose stepmother treated her badly, whose father was incredibly strict,
and who ended up living on her own in New York aged 14, was that she had
survived at all, he said. How did she do it? She was a self-destructive
survivor, who became one of her own creations, he suggested.
''She was so contradictory. In her poetry she could articulate every
single problem she had. She could analyse the problem, and be true to
it, she had objectivity, yet she could not see the problem for herself
at all. She could not even boil water. The scene in the film where she
eats raw bacon was real. She did not wash. She would buy new underpants
and put the dirty ones away. She did not know about laundry. She became
a communist when she was in Hollywood earning 10,000 dollars a week yet,
extraordinarily, she was a true socialist.''
As to the potency of his film, he pointed out that the people who sat
round the table were still talked about. They were the root system of
the New York literati in spite of the fact that the group was made up of
first-rate second-rate writers.
''As Dorothy says in the first scene -- there were no real giants in
it, just a bunch of loudmouths,'' he said. ''They were the media of
their time and for 10 years they wrote about each other. The
misconception about the Round Table is that this was a laugh-a-minute
group, but all of them drank, most of them died from alcohol, and some
of them didn't accomplish much at all. Some of them became legends, but
most of them are really famous for just having lunch together.
''They were a most eccentric bunch. George S Kaufman was out of his
mind, would wash his hands 50 times a day, and was infamous for being a
male nymphomaniac, Ruth Hale and Heywood Broun slept in separate rooms,
but encouraged each other to have affairs, and Alexander Woolcott was a
eunuch. I cannot imagine anybody sitting together for that long today.''
He found when putting the film together that people had preconceptions
about how he should tackle his subject. ''The trouble was, because the
film is based on actual people and because so many people presume they
know, that they could not allow me to present something that differed
from what they thought,'' he said. ''They could not accept what I said.
But they do not know whether I am right or wrong. There are actually not
many facts in the film but those there are can stand up to the test of
any fact-checker.''

ANTHONY TROON claims credit for spotting the first green fingers of
spring
AS the snows slowly melt away into spring, the first of them peep
shyly into the daylight. During winter they have lain dormant in their
beds, surrounded by all sorts of nutritious rotting matter. Now they
emerge, get into their cars, and drive to their favourite garden centre.
These first days of pale sunshine bring forth the reactivated gardener
in a riot of drab colour -- baggy navy blues, soiled greens, stained
browns. They have spent the past few cold months as bulbs or tubers.
They have sighed and fretted, reading newspapers and watching
television, virtually inactive. Only the occasional trip to add
something horrible to their precious two-year compost has shown they
have not expired.
This weekend you can see the seasonal miracle confirmed. They have
arisen on pale, trembling stalks. Lazarus has climbed into his
L-registered Nipponmobile with a list of essentials as long as the arum
lily but with a slightly different scent.
The species you will see at the garden centres from now on, bumping
elbows and frowning with concentration, are mainly hybrid perpetuals.
Sometimes you will come across a dwarf variety -- a garden enthusiast
hunkering down and reaching deep into the lower shelf marked
''Herbaceous''.
Garden centres are marvellous places for idle browsing, but not at
this time of year, my friend. This is the time for serious humphing.
Mighty plastic sacks, containing enough peat to re-bog the Emerald Isle,
are hefted on to barrows and trundled out to the waiting cars. Boing
goes the boot-lid, thump goes the peat, ouch groan the springs. The
average gardener's car is not a happy car this weekend.
Other cars watch in trepidation as their owners loiter with intent
round a display of ornamental fountains. These things, which recycle the
same water continuously like the City of London, seem to be gaining
credibility. You can have anything from piddling boys to Grecian maidens
by way of startled fauns. ''It won't get in the boot,'' shout the cars.
''It's too heavy.'' Lost in wild surmise, the gardeners seem deaf to
these entreaties.
Sulphate of potash from distant Broxburn . . . Economy seed trays for
mad March planting. Ach, it's almost poetic. Green fingers prod and poke
at the trays of heathers and alpines. The first dirt under the
fingernails means the year is only just beginning. At a garden centre
near you . . . now.

SCOTTISH Television has bitten the bullet and sold its loss-making
Alternative International employment consultancy subsidiary which was
largely responsible for slicing pre-tax profits last year from #13m to
#2m.
A fall to #9m had been forecast at the interim stage but nothing had
been added in then for any write-offs on Alternative.
After inital weakness when they dropped to 392p the shares soon
recovered to close just 2p weaker at 406p. That compares with the 520p
at which Mirror Newspapers through the Daily Record acquired a 20% stake
last autumn for #50m with the loss now #11m.
The dividend total has been raised 15% to 14.0641p with an 11.8p final
for a 4.3% yield.
Scottish managing director Gus Macdonald said yesterday that Mirror
chief executive David Montgomery has not been pressing for board
representation, apparently satisfied by the argument that there are at
present so many scenarios for cross-ownership in the media with the
position not likely to be clarified until the Department of National
Heritage issues a White Paper next month.
There have been suggestions that there will not be a substantial
relaxation but only the right to increase the holding by a newspaper
publisher in a television franchise to just below 30%. However, some
analysts believe this is kite flying by Heritage Sectretary Stephen
Dorrell to encourage reaction.
Mr Macdonald had a meeting recently with Mr Montgomery and Janet
Street-Porter who heads Mirror TV's proposed cable channel Live TV.
He pointed out that STV not only had the highest audience growth rate
of any ITV company, up 3.4% last year against a UK decline of 2.1%, but
it had increased its share in its franchise area to 40.6% compared with
the combined 40.5% of BBC1 and BBC2 and at the expense of Channel 4 and
to some extent satellite.
But the company wants to participate in cable and is interested in
various options.
Mr Montgomery said that he had been encouraged by the discussions with
Scottish and their view of prospects for the year ahead. He added that
he was pleased with the increase in dividend and looks forward to it
being sustained.
The profits drop was caused by a combination of a #2.4m loss on
Alternative which is being sold to Europe's largest outplacement company
Coutts Counselling for a maximium of #13.2m including 12.7 million
Coutts shares currently worth #6.87m. That has resulted in a #7.5m
goodwill write-off.
There was also the loss of #4m of Unilever income which was almost all
profit due to the row over advertising rates as well as losses caused by
the disruption when Scottish was forced by the Office of Fair Trading to
quit the Time Exchange sales organisation after Granada bought LWT.
Unilever has now signed up for an initial three years and there should
be an increase in revenue from Tesco after the Wm Low acquisition and
from Kwik Save following on its rescue of the Shoprite stores as well as
Sainsbury.
Overall advertising reveneue fell 3% to #73.5m and market share from
5.35% to 4.8%. However, a partial recovery to 5% is expected for the
current year with overall revenue so far this year up by 8%.
Programme sales to the rest of the network were little changed at
#34.3m with products such as Taggart, Doctor Finlay, and children's
programmes in demand.
Following the sale of the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh, all production
is now concentrated in Glasgow.
The 20%-owned GMTV brought in a #1.7m loss but should be at the
break-even level for 1995.
There has been a 12% fall in staff numbers to a 1994 average of 572
and the core number, excluding contract workers, will possibly fall by
around 20 to 300 this year.
Rationalisation cost #2.3m in 1994 but should boost profits by more
than #1m this year.
Scottish chairman William Brown said that with increased advertising
revenue and losses eliminated at subsidiary and associate companies,
prospects for 1995 look much more favourable.
A profits leap to just above #18m is probable which would leave the
shares trading at around 15 times likely earnings.

AFTER Mark O'Meara set the pace yesterday with a 65 to establish a
three-stroke lead at nine under par, virtually no-one in the field, half
of whom had to battle strong afternoon winds that O'Meara was fortunate
to have missed, was able to make any kind of a move on him.
Starting at the tenth in the worst of the afternoon wind, Nick Faldo
played his front nine in level-par 36, remaining at four under par, five
behind O'Meara. But after the late players turned, the scoring improved.
Faldo birdied the first and second holes to join Americans Andrew
Magee and Blaine McCallister, both already finished, in second place at
six under par.
Severiano Ballesteros also had a back-nine renaissance. He, too, shot
level par over the first nine holes, then picked up three straight
birdies from the eleventh to go four under.
This bump in scoring, after a general trend in multiple bogeys among
the afternoon players, was bad news for Colin Montgomerie, who played in
the first group of the day. He shot a 75, and when he finished he was
tied for eighty-fifth. His only hope was that the wind would plump up
the scores and allow him to move up to seventieth place or better and
make the cut.
By noon he had moved into a tie for sixty-ninth, but in the hours
afterwards his two-over-par total of 144 veered back and forth on the
edge of both sides of the cut line.
Montgomerie was philosophical about his chances: ''If I'm not in, I
probably don't deserve to be.'', he said, and he had much to kick
himself about in yesterday's four-over-par effort.
He began the day at two under par, moved to three under, and into the
top 10, when he sank a 15-footer for a birdie on the fifteenth, his
sixth hole of the day, but then never even sniffed a birdie.
Montgomerie dropped a shot at the sixteenth, missing a par putt from
four feet, then hit a horrendous tee shot on the par-3 seventeenth,
sending his No.3-iron shot slicing into the water, some 50 yards right
of his target area.
His final nine holes were all pars, save the fifth and sixth. On both
occasions he missed the green, chipped to two-and-a-half feet, and then
missed the putts for par. Early scores (Americans unless stated):
133 -- M O'Meara 68, 65.
136 -- B McCallister 70, 66; A Magee 69, 67.
137 -- M Standly 71, 66.
138 -- M McCumber 71, 67.
139 -- B Claar 69, 70; J McGovern 65, 74; M Smith 72, 67.
140 -- D Hammond 71, 69; J Gallagher Jr 72, 68; B Lohr 69, 71; B
Britton 71, 69.
Other scores included: 141 -- B Langer (Germany) 70, 71. 144 -- C
Montgomerie (Scotland) 69, 75. 145 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 72, 73.

NICK Faldo is playing very well right now, and this was demonstrated
yesterday when he faced the toughest conditions he has seen in months on
a golf course, and still shot a level-par 71 to stay in contention.
He finished at four-under-par 138, tied for fifth place with Severiano
Ballesteros, who shot a 68 in the same brutally windy afternoon
conditions yesterday. Both Europeans were five strokes behind the
leading score, held by Mark O'Meara at nine under par.
O'Meara had one of the day's earliest tee times, benefiting from the
calm morning conditions to shoot the day's low round of 65. O'Meara held
a three-stroke advantage over fellow Americans Andrew Magee and Blaine
McCallister, both at six under par.
After his three-birdie, three-bogey round, Faldo said: ''I'm not
disheartened. I played well, it was just the conditions that won out
there today. That was one hell of a hard day. It was an effort even to
bring the club back on some holes.''
Ballesteros was optimistic about the weekend. The Spaniard said:
''There were a lot of difficult holes, but I only made one bogey, and
had three good birdies. It's great to make the cut. My game is getting
better and better every day.''
Though Ballesteros's ball striking was sound in the wind, he was not
able to sink any long putts. His only bogey came from a three-putt from
18 feet on the sixth hole, while all four of his birdies were off of
putts inside five feet.
The next European on the list was Ian Woosnam, who shot a one-over-par
72, also in the windy afternoon. Woosnam, in his first start of the
year, ended the second round in a tie for fourteenth at two under par.
Woosnam had a tendency to hook in the wind, but his short game came to
his rescue. He said: ''I'm very pleased still to be here.''
Jesper Parnevik was the only one of the seven Europeans in the Honda
field to miss the cut, the Swede shooting a 73 to miss by one. Bernhard
Langer was a stroke behind Woosnam, shooting a 71 to finish at one under
par, while both Colin Montgomerie and David Feherty made the cut on the
nose.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
133 -- M O'Meara 68, 65.
136 -- B McCallister 70, 66; A Magee 69, 67.
137 -- M Standly 71, 66.
138 -- M McCumber 71, 67; N Faldo (England) 67, 71; S Ballesteros
(Spain) 70, 68.
139 -- B Claar 69, 70; J McGovern 65, 74; M Smith 72, 67; D Martin 71,
68; G Day 70, 69; Y Mizumaki (Japan) 71, 68.
140 -- I Woosnam (Wales) 68, 72; D Hammond 71, 69; J Gallagher Jr 72,
68; B Lohr 69, 71; B Britton 71, 69; M Dawson 69, 71; L Rinker 68, 72; R
Freeman 70, 70; D Hart 71, 69.
Other scores included: 141 -- B Langer (Germany) 70, 71. 144 -- C
Montgomerie (Scotland) 69, 75; D Feherty (N Ireland) 71, 73. 145 -- J

Take up a bold brush and when you next look down,
things could be looking up, says Mary Bennie
THE decorative effects of paint for walls and furniture are well
established and paint manufacturers have responded to the public's
interest in creating special effects such as marbling, stippling,
dragging, and ragging, as well as ways of enhancing the appearance of
furniture, for example making it look older by using distressing or
''antiquing'' techniques.
Attention is now turning to floors -- so instead of covering up those
dreary floorboards with a carpet why not give your room a new lease of
life by painting them? Various paint manufacturers supply floor paints
specially for this purpose, and you can achieve your own effects much
more easily than you might think -- and it's cheaper than buying a
carpet. You can paint the whole floor in a single colour, or use
different colours and patterns to create special effects. Why not design
a painted rug for the floor? Or paint a frame around a rug you already
have.
If you are going to paint the floor yourself, the paint manufacturers
will supply instructions on how to prepare the surface. The
International Floor Paint company makes paints suitable for wood,
concrete, stone, tile, brick, lino, or concrete floors. It recommends
that paint is only applied to surfaces which are sound, clean, and dry.
It also supplies the appropriate sealants for concrete or wooden floors
which may be necessary before applying the paint.
Old wooden floorboards will need to be sanded and sealed before they
are painted; International's knot-sealing solution should be applied to
knots in new floors to prevent resin from discolouring the paint. Make
sure the surface is clean and dry before you begin -- it is advisable to
apply a coat of white spirit to the wood before you start to paint. You
can apply single colours, or make your own patterns using cardboard
templates to outline the shape and masking tape to protect areas that
are not being painted. International Floor Paint is available from B &amp; Q
and Great Mills.
If you don't want to paint the whole floor, or would rather not paint
directly on to the floor, why not go for a painted floorcloth? Once a
favoured, cheaper alternative to carpeting they are becoming
increasingly popular. The material most commonly used is canvas and
there are many suitable paints and varnishes available for this purpose.
Try Jocasta Innes's Paint Magic Company, which is based at Richmond in
Surrey. Paint Magic will supply equipment by mail order and also run
courses on painting floors and floorcloths as well as on other
decorative paint techniques.
Paint Magic has a range of books by Jocasta Innes on the subject, also
available by mail order. One of these, The Thrifty Decorator, published
by Conran-Octopus, gives some tips on how to paint floors. Details of
its products and paint effect courses available on request.
Natalie Woolf will undertake floor-paintings to commission. Woolf
Floor Paintings is based in Leeds but she will work anywhere in the UK.
Her floor paintings are usually done on canvas, and can be used as a
centrepiece or runner, or fitted wall to wall and permanently fixed to
the floor. The paintings are protected by several layers of hard-wearing
floor varnish and a renewable wax coating.
All they need to keep them clean is a wipe over with warm, soapy
water.
Natalie Woolf's work has been exhibited at various venues and at the
Chelsea Crafts Fair. Examples of her work can be seen in London at The
Study, 41 Shad Thames, SE1 2NJ.

STENCILLING is a unique way to add a stamp of creativity and
individuality to your home, writes BEVERLEY BROWN. You don't have to be
artistic -- that part is done for you if you opt for ready-cut stencils.
But it's an inexpensive form of decorating that anybody can do. And it's
fun too.
Almost anything can be given a new look with stencils. Tired but still
functional kitchen units can be given a unique facelift . . . plain
walls can become a focal point with a stencil border around a mirror or
picture . . . cushions, curtains . . . the list of possibilities is
endless. Adaptable and versatile, a stencil can be used just as easily
on a small project as on a scheme for a whole room. And they can be used
on furniture, fabrics, floors, and walls in a variety of paints to
produce effects ranging from sharp to ethereal.
The best and cheapest way to start is probably by reading a book that
explains the technique and materials involved. One good one is The
Stencil Book by Amelia Saint George, #9.99. Some books also include
ready-cut stencils or designs to get you started. All sorts of paints
can be used with stencils, including spray paint, fabric paint, stencil
crayons -- even car spray paint -- depending on your chosen surface. The
beauty of stencils is that you control it; the motif, the colouring, and
the quantity.
A stencil is basically a pattern or motif cut from a resilient
waterproof material that acts as a frame. The stencil is secured with
either masking tape or, better still, spray adhesive that allows
repositioning. Colour is then brushed or sprayed on, creating the
pattern on the surface beneath. Stencils can be repositioned and used
again and again -- and more than one colour can be used.
* The book mentioned above, plus a wide range of ready-cut stencils
and stencilling materials, can be obtained from Millers Creativity Shop,
Glasgow. Prices range from #3.35 for a medium stencil. Tel: 041 331 2303
for details and mail order.

SILVER. Lovely to look at, but a pain to clean. A little judicious
cheating, however, can give you short cuts to restoring and protecting
its glowing sheen.
If silver is badly tarnished you can make up your own ''magic''
solution. Here's how: Put a piece of aluminium foil into a plastic basin
with a few washing soda crystals, lay the silver gently on the foil then
cover with hot water. Let it lie for a few minutes, then rinse and dry.

POP/ROCK
Compiled by DAVID BELCHER
Red Hot On Impulse, various (Impulse)
* FUND-raising sampler seeking to fight Aids / HIV by offering 11
tracks of fearless exploratory fusioneering recorded between 1961 and
1971 by some of the Impulse label's bravest fusion-explorers, including
Archie Shepp, Oliver Nelson (represented by a track from his epochal
Blues And The Abstract Truth LP), Charles Mingus, and Alice Coltrane,
and Pharoah Sanders both separately and in collaboration.
Elastica, Elastica (Deceptive)
* GOT them literate and alienated 1981 post-punk, no-wave, agit-squat
blues again, ma. Just like we had them before, in fact. In 1981. Only
they were better then. Fresher. More immediate. More point to them. And
we didn't know enough not to know better, if you know what I mean.
Didn't know enough to know that Martha and the Muffins and the
Photographs weren't the real deal. But now we do, so we know we don't
need this.
Bite It, Whiteout (Silvertone)
* SOLID debut album from the power-pop cutie foursome who make Oasis
look like raddled old jossers. Sharp songs; memorable melodic hooks;
gutsy riffing. Only one problem, and sadly it's rather a major one --
most of the songs are stuck at a somewhat dispiriting one-paced,
mid-tempo choogle-chuggerama level. Faster, my pussycats! Kill! Kill!
Jazz, Not House Volume 1, various (eightball)
* FROM the New York label that brought you Giant Step and Napoleon
Soul O, an eight-track sampler of propulsive jazz which belies the
prohibitive part of its title. Thumbs aloft in a pumping 4/4 manner for
the African Dream and their Black Thoughts and Jazz Impressions. Much
respect is due, too, to the aforementioned Giant Step and their
eerily-unstoppable Satsuki.
United Future Airlines, United Future Organisation (Talkin' Loud)
* GROOVY four-track Indo-Latinate-Japanese jazz-cocktail crossover EP
featuring a lazily atmospheric reworking of Oliver Nelson's Stolen
Moments, and serving to alert you to the unearthly yet danceable
delights of UFO's No Sound Is Too Taboo album.
CLASSICAL
Compiled by MICHAEL TUMELTY
Prokofiev Piano Sonatas Vol 1, Bernd Glemser (Naxos)
* DEATH to the #15 CD. With Naxos discs at under a fiver, and
generally of a good quality, why be part of the great CD rip-off? Try
this disc, a superior performance and recording of three (nos 2,7, and
8) of Prokofiev's great piano sonatas. Outstanding performances by the
young German wizard Bernd Glemser: hair-raising speeds, electrifying
technique -- can't wait for the rest of the series.
Shostakovich String Quartets Vol 1, Eder Quartet (Naxos)
* SOME Naxos discs are recorded in East European churches, giving them
a slightly reverberant ambience. This one's a case in point: a little
bright, but anyone who wants a set of Shostakovich quartets without
investing a set of limbs would be advised to look here. Features numbers
4, 6, and 7 of the cycle. Again, under a fiver. And do we wonder why
Naxos discs are selling so well? The hell we do.
JAZZ
Compiled by ROB ADAMS
Songs With Legs, Carla Bley/Andy Sheppard/Steve Swallow (Watt)
* A DELIGHTFUL romp through five typically mischievous and quirky Bley
originals and one Monk tune, Misterioso. Sheppard plays tenor and
soprano saxophones with gorgeous restraint, Swallow lays down bass
guitar lines that Fatty Arbuckle could walk on, and Bley's piano solos
consistently cause heart failure, although she always gets home safely.
If Mountains Could Sing, Terje Rypdal (ECM)
* THE Norwegian guitarist pits his spacy-jazz-meets-grunge trio
against a violin, viola, and cello chamber trio (none of them shrinking
violets). Big on atmosphere, rich in melodies and occasionally OTT on
the guitar anarchy, the overall result is Rypdal's best and most
coherent release since 1980's Descendre.
FOLK
Compiled by ALISON KERR
Just Imagine, Keith Ingham &amp; Marty Grosz and their Hot Cosmopolites
(Stomp Off CD1285)
* BRILLIANT songbook album from the twenties-style Hot Cosmopolites
who execute the repertoire of DeSylva, Brown, and Henderson with much
wit and charm. You're bound to recognise some of the period tunes: the
peppy, presumably preppy Varsity Drag; the doomy, gloomy Thrill is Gone,
and the zippy Button Up Your Overcoat. The last, twentieth title says it
all: I'm In Seventh Heaven.
Only Trust Your Heart, Diana Krall (GRP)
* NEW singer / pianist on the jazz block. The sultry, huskily
laid-back voice is not what you'd expect from the sleeve photo, but it's
used to impressive effect throughout. Especially on the moody title
track and the downright groovy Is You Is . . . she breathes new life
into all of standards featured. Strong support from Stanley Turrentine,
Christian McBride, and Ray Brown.

LIVING in Britain has helped a young Japanese artist discover her
potential as a glassmaker, writes MARY BENNIE. Now based at Edinburgh
College of Art, Keiko Mukaide has developed her own style and discovered
herself, something she feels she would not have achieved had she
remained in Japan.
Keiko Mukaide trained as a graphic designer and worked for an
advertising agency in Tokyo. ''I found the work increasingly
unsatisfying -- designs are ephemeral, they don't last. I wanted to do
something which involved working with my hands, making something that
would last.'' She was inspired by a glass exhibition she saw in Tokyo
some 15 years ago, and decided that glassmaking was what she wanted to
do.
''It was very hard to find somewhere to study glassmaking in Tokyo; I
did some weekend courses, and I went on two three-week courses in the
United States, but it wasn't enough: I was still working as a graphic
designer, but I wanted to spend more time working with glass.''
The breakthrough came in 1989 when Ms Mukaide gained a place at the
Royal College of Art in London to study ceramics and glass. ''It was
like starting a new life, somewhere completely different,'' she says.
''I wanted to experience another culture and I discovered that I could
see my own culture better from a distance. I had not thought of myself
as being particularly Japanese. In fact I saw myself as being quite
Westernised while I was living in Tokyo.''
Having completed her Master of Design course in London, Ms Mukaide
came to Edinburgh College of Art in 1993 as artist-in-residence. She has
decided to make her home in Edinburgh, and last year received a start-up
grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her set up her own studio.
In the meantime she teaches in the college's glass department and is
able to use the large kilns there.
Ms Mukaide's work has been exhibited around the world, from the US and
Brazil to the UK and Ireland, and in 1994 she gained an award from the
Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers.
Following a touring exhibition in Europe which featured her work, she
was invited to become artist-in-residence at the summer school at Sars
Poteries in France for six weeks last summer.
''I had been there the previous summer to study with the Australian
glass artist Warren Langley, concentrating on kiln work. It was the
first time they had had an artist-in-residence,'' says Ms Mukaide.
One of Ms Mukaide's recurrent themes has been Illusion of Fire on the
Horizon, a series of pieces which combine tubes of blown glass with
strands of glass, fused together to form a piece both solid and
ethereal, suggestive of the phenomenon sometimes seen in Japan, like
waves of fire on the sea's horizon which the Japanese believed were the
spirits of the dead returning to earth.
''Glass is a wonderful material for expressing these forms and shapes.
I hope my pieces help people to see the different qualities inherent in
glass and the way it can be used to capture something almost indefinable
or spiritual; it is a way of seeing that people in the West have largely
lost -- if we can't understand something, measure it, or explain it, we
don't like to admit that it exists.''
* Keiko Mukaide will have a solo exhibition at the Scottish Gallery in
Edinburgh during the festival in 1996. Her work is included in the glass
collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Examples can be
seen at Contemporary Applied Arts, 43 Earlham Street, Covent Garden,
London (0171-836 6993) and at the Scottish Gallery, 16 Dundas Street,
Edinburgh (0131-558 1200). Keiko Mukaide can be contacted at 41 Dalmeny
Street, Edinburgh. Tel: 0131-554 4842.

<HEADLINE>December shortfall spoils good year for trade figures</HEADLINE>

A MUCH larger-than-expected visible trade deficit of #1640m in
December marred a good year in which the shortfall declined from #13.4bn
to #10.7bn, its lowest level since 1991.
The total deficit for 1994 is substantially higher than the Treasury's
forecast of #9000m at the time of the Budget in November. This largely
reflects a jump in the deficit for the fourth quarter to #3092m from
#1875m in the third.
The Treasury also forecast a further reduction in the visible deficit
to #6500m this year, but the latest trends point to an increase in
imports, suggesting that the Government's hopes of a further sharp
contraction could be dashed.
The December deficit was more than double the revised figure of #754m
for November and was much the biggest monthly shortfall last year. A big
number had been expected because of the known deterioration in
non-European Union trade, where the figures are compiled much more
quickly.
The latest non-EU figures for January, which take account of the
accession of Austria, Finland, and Sweden to the EU, showed a drop in
the deficit from around #900m to #300m, suggesting that the December
figures were an aberration.
The value of exports fell by 3% between November and December while
imports rose by 4%. Excluding oil and erratic items, the volume of
exports fell by 3.5% but the volume of imports rose by 4.5%.
The widening of the gap was mainly due to an increase in the deficit
with non-EU countries to #1105m in December from #402m in November. The
EU deficit also rose from #352m to #535m.
James Capel's Adam Cole warned against ignoring December's upsurge in
imports. ''You can't pretend the imports never came in,'' he said.
Imports were picking up, especially in capital goods in line with the
belated upturn in capital investment. He expected the trend to continue
to the detriment of this year's figures.
The value of exports in the fourth quarter was 2% higher than in the
third, but imports increased by 5.5%. The volume figures, excluding oil
and erratics, showed the same increases for both exports and imports.
In 1994 as a whole the value of exports increased by 11% to #135bn and
imports grew by 8% to #145.7bn. Excluding oil and erratics, export
volume was 11% higher against 6.5% for imports.
With North Sea output at record levels the surplus on the oil account
jumped from #2457m in 1993 to #4158m this year, the highest figure since
1987. The deficit on non-EU trade was #6801m and on EU trade #3929m.
Balance of payments figures for the fourth quarter are due to be
published on March 24. An invisibles surplus of #2367m in the third
quarter allowed Britain to record its first quarterly surplus of #492m
on current account for more than seven years.
But the average surplus for the first three quarters was about #1800m.
Even so the current account deficit for the whole of 1994 could well
come in around the Treasury's forecast of #4000m.

A KEEN gardener asked me the other day if he could grow rhubarb from
seed, writes IAN WALLS. He had found getting hold of plants rather
difficult. You can, in fact, grow from seed, but it will take some years
before it gives a worthwhile crop.
You can force rhubarb yourself by lifting a few crowns. Pack them
under a bench in the greenhouse. Ideally, you should have done this a
few months back, of course. You can still put boxes over rhubarb in the
garden. This induces them to produce succulent shoots earlier than
usual.

NOTHING frightens me more / Than religion at my door . . . . So sang
the ex-Velvet Underground Welsh gloomster John Cale about 20 years ago,
and Couch Potato feels very much the same.
A quiet, godless Sunday afternoon at home: the doorbell rings. Knowing
that Sunday is the day when the bailiffs cease from troubling and the
postman is at rest, we skip to answer with a lightsome heart. But when
Monty Python reminded us that no-one expects the Spanish Inquisition,
they forgot to add that no-one expects the Jehovah's Witnesses or the
Mormons either.
Lacking the rudeness to tell them to go away, the moral fibre to
declare ourself a practising Satanist, and the intellectual stamina to
give them an argument, Couch Potato generally just stands in the
doorway, smiling inanely and nodding, until the lengthy interview is
concluded by a furtive refusal to buy.
Still, it could be worse. They could have been Buddhists. Wise, kindly
old Buddhists, on the doorstep to announce that your eight-year-old son
could well be the reincarnation of a long-deceased Lama, and would you
please arrange his transport to Bhutan with all speed so that he can
realise his destiny?
That's what happens to Seattle parents Chris Isaak and Bridget Fonda
in Bernardo Bertolucci's bizarre though not entirely charmless Little
Buddha (rental, cert PG), and the really weird thing is that Isaak ups
and takes the wee boy over to Bhutan at that. There they discover that
the whole thing is only an audition -- the wise old monks have another
two candidates for the reincarnationship lined up already.
While this spiritual equivalent of a Bonnie Baby contest is going on,
there's a whole second movie going on in parallel. This is the one that
stars Keanu Reeves as Prince Siddhartha in scenes from the Buddha's
early life according to Buddhist tradition, growing up as a godlike
prince while gradually learning about human suffering and how to abolish
it.
Reeves brings a sweet and dignified innocence to this part of the
film, although his accent sometimes reminds us of Peter Sellers's
Indian-doctor act in The Millionairess, and Vittorio Storaro's glowing
colour photography revels in the reds and golds and heat and dust of the
settings.
This is the better part of Little Buddha, a gentle and kindly
picture-book exposition of Buddhism For Beginners. It's also the part
that has survived the editing suite best: the Seattle-to-Bhutan side has
some dodgy join-ups and holes in the narrative that suggest Bertolucci
originally had a much longer film in mind.
Espousing as it does all sorts of spirituality and positive values,
Little Buddha is an almost impossible film to dislike, but,
unfortunately, it's almost as hard to take it seriously.
How refreshing to plunge into the deeply unspiritual world of Payback
(rental, cert 18), a taut and twisty variation on the classic
murder-and-adultery themes of Double Indemnity and The Postman Always
Rings Twice.
C Thomas Howell, a talented ex-bratpacker (his best film was the
modern Western Kid) whose career seems to have been derailed into
straight-to-video hell, plays a rangy young hood just out of jail whose
wandering bootheels lead him to a sticksville diner run -- quelle
coincidence -- by Marshall Bell, the prison guard who gave him a
sadistically bad time in the slammer.
He has a sultry, sullen, footloose wife (Joan Severance) with an
ominous interest in insurance policies, and since he last got medieval
on Howell's ass he's gone blind, which is convenient. Noir by numbers,
but viciously well scripted. Good value for genre fans.
And then, straying back to the art-house doghouse, there's the weird
and wonderful 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould (retail, Electric
Pictures, #15.99, cert U), an affectionate and quirkily splintered
portrait of the great Canadian pianist who died in 1982.

Billy Graham blows into Puerto Rico next week for a blast that might
be his last. Carol Clewlow looks at the man, his message and his methods
Puerto Rico . . .
Always a hurricane blowing
Always the population growing
And the money owing...
AMONG the things that the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association must
be currently praying for is that a freak hurricane will not be blowing
in Puerto Rico from Thursday to Saturday. Not that it will matter in the
end. Billy Graham has battled with all winds and weathers in half a
century of preaching.
It lashed down, for instance, at the Harringay Arena in 1954, the
first time he preached on British soil, about the same time,
incidentally, that Stephen Sondheim was penning the words above for West
Side Story.
It's an irony difficult to ignore that this, the latest, greatest and
possibly last Billy Graham global campaign will come from one of the
planet's smallest and poorest countries. For a brief spell Puerto Rico,
best-known for the export of drugs and illegal immigrants, will find
itself beaming out the Billy Graham brand of hope to the rest of the
world. An estimated 6m people in 180 countries will see him when he
stands up before the microphone in San Juan's Hiram Bithorn Stadium. For
in another small irony, Puerto Rico finds itself in a perfect position
for satellite transmission, one of the reasons it was chosen for the
campaign.
Another is that Puerto Rico is American dollar country, and therefore
not subject to loss on exchange rates. A third is its mother tongue,
Spanish.
Spanish is the second-longest language in the world. The first is
German, explaining why the last global campaign was based in the
apparently obscure location of Essen. The nature of the language ensures
long gaps between sentences in the stadium as the interpreter translates
for the audience, which in turn benefits the dozens of other translaters
in the communications centre set up around the back of the stadium.
Altogether Billy Graham will preach in some 57 different languages.
Truly, you might think, speaking in tongues.
On a comparatively parochial note, 12 places in Scotland, from
Edinburgh and Glasgow to Shetland, will receive a transmission. The
largest gathering in Britain will be at the Shaftesbury Theatre in
London, where Cliff Richard will be in attendance.
Billy Graham. Breakfaster with presidents, broadcaster, author,
resident in the annual Gallup Poll of the World's 10 Most Admired Men,
master of the sound-bite and guru of a Marshall McLuhan world.
If the phenomena which is Billy Graham proves anything, it is just
what can be done when a grasp of the possibilities of mass-media
communications is nailed early on and hard and fast to solid,
old-fashioned, Old Testament conviction. For it was always thus.
That first, 12-week, British campaign in Harringay was sent out to
centres around the country after a member of Graham's technical team
discovered the presence of old land-lines laid down by the Government
during the war. More importantly, he saw their use would merely
constitute an extension of the public address system and thus not be
subject to the ban on broadcasting.
Another conviction which has favoured his cause is the belief that,
since God moves in mysterious ways, all publicity in the end can be
reckoned to be good publicity. And so it proved, again, that first time
at Harringay. Promotional literature for the campaign sent out in
America was found to contain a somewhat controversial summation of the
English condition . . .
''What Hitler's bombs could not do,'' it read, in Graham's words,
''socialism with its accompanying evils shortly accomplished.''
Hasty retractions via ship-to-shore radio on the way over claiming
that it was all a misprint (the word secularism had been meant, not
socialism) may have failed to stem the disquiet among critics, but it
ensured a healthy-sized knot of press waiting for him at Waterloo
station.
For his critics Graham was already tarred with the brush of the
newspaper baron, William Randolph Hearst, who had divined somewhere in
Graham an echo of his own virulent anti-communism. It was Hearst's now
famous memo to his editors -- Puff Graham -- which propelled his protege
in the space of a matter of months from a faltering Los Angeles campaign
to the front page of Time.
For such critics, Graham's sessions with Nixon in the bowels of the
White House almost 20 years later were just more of the same. The
discrediting of Nixon, the White House tapes, the foul language, was a
bitter pill which Graham had to swallow and publicly. He's described the
period himself as his darkest hour.
But all that was a long time ago. Today the wall is down and the very
idea of communism, as out-dated and sepia-tinted in the mind as that
curious film footage of people in dowdy post-war fashion making their
way up to the front in that first Harringay Crusade.
Today Billy Graham can beam his message with the approval of the
authorities into the very heart of what was once the Evil Empire.
Meanwhile, his old friend Nixon has gone to his grave, reputation
restored and redeemed by a nation's inability to speak ill of its dead.
And while the fundamentalist message of sin and salvation remains
essentially the same, still there have had to be changes. For today
Graham must preach to a world grown steadily more secular, where sin is
a word the ad-men use to sell cream cakes.
Apocalyptic notions of everlasting lakes of fire and eternal weeping
and wailing and gnashing of teeth have been lost today. Hell is a word
to describe a private state of mind, so that this is the one he now more
usually addresses.
Maurice Rowlandson, a pleasant and courteous man who has been Billy's
representative in Britain for 40 years, cheerfully acknowledges that
Graham is no great shakes as a preacher. It's true. You won't find any
fine theological points in Graham's message, just a range over the ills
of the planet from divorce to the hole in the ozone layer. The
explanation of such ills and their solution to them he rolls into one.
It's the one that begins ''The Bible says . . .''
What Graham is, according to Rowlandson, is a great ''caller'', in the
old-fashioned evangelistic tradition. And if the word has theatrical
overtones, then so it should. For the last moments of his campaigns are
inextricably theatrical, the same phrases, the same injunctions, the
same certainties, 40 years on from Harringay: ''Your friends will wait .
. . get up out of your seat . . . God is calling you . . . come . . .''
To those not in sympathy, the converts seem like nothing so much as
sheep, flocking down from their seats and coralled at the front by the
stewards, all to the soft and insistent tones of the massed choir
singing the old gospel hymn Just As I Am with its hypnotic use of the
word Come.
The Billy Graham organisation prefers to call those who come to the
front to receive their information pack inquirers. Totals of souls saved
each night are a preoccupation of the press, according to Maurice
Rowlandson. But this won't do entirely.
For the fact is that each night tallies of those who came forward the
night before are announced to cheers from the platform. And those
ringing hallelujahs bear out another criticism of such crusades; that
somehow the organisers manage to give the impression of innocents
walking in off the street to salvation, while the fact is that by far
the greater part of the audience are already committed evangelicals, and
those fresh converts, by virtue of church or background, are already
half-way there.
In truth, the evangelicals are not much worried by such criticism. The
truth is things are going too well for them. The evangelical wing of the
Church of England is by and large the only one growing and it includes
an evangelical archbishop.
Billy Graham is 77 now, still tanned and handsome, still glowing with
that Eagle Scout American well-brushed handsomeness that spoke so much
of sunshine and affluence and a different world from the grey post-war
Britain that first flocked to the front at Harringay. For him though,
the life's work will soon be over. He has Parkinson's disease, kept
under control by drugs. He's unlikely to visit Britain again. Each
global mission, his team know, may be the last.
In preparation for the end, the organisation has drawn in its horns,
closed down its world-wide offices and concentrated its operations where
it all began, in Minneapolis. They've pretty much given up the search
for a successor. At one point Graham's son Franklin was mooted, a good
preacher by all accounts. But, in the end, his father's shoes proved too
large.
Of the 3000 bona fide evangelists operating in the world, Luis Palau,
the Argentine preacher, is reckoned to be the best-known, next to
Graham. But, in truth, who outside of the faithful has heard of Luis
Palau?
There was Wesley, they say, in the end. There was Moody. There was
Gypsy Smith. And then there was Graham. Comes the time, comes the man,
they say with a sigh, albeit in evangelical language. It's probably the
one thing with which his critics would agree.

THE #1200m bid is dead and Northern Electric lives to fight another
day. And also fighting their corners henceforth will be the regulators
who have become referees able to change the rules in the middle of a
bout.
In a terse announcement, Northern Electric chairman David Morris said
that Trafalgar House's revised offer of 950p seriously undervalues it
shares.
So as the #1040m bid was turned down by Northern, under Takeover Panel
rules a lower offer can only go ahead with the recommendation of the
board of the victim, it automatically lapses.
The probability is that this particular foray is just the first in
what will be a series of takeovers of UK utilities with Northumbrian
Water already being harried by Lyonnaise des Eaux.
The French have gone about that very sensibly through seeking
regulatory approval before announcing terms with an enormous saving in
fees as just one consideration.
The City swithered all Friday from the moment that Trafalgar House
said that it was seeking to lapse its #11-a-share bid for the
Newcastle-based company even if it did get acceptances for over 90%.
Last night Trafalgar said that it had received acceptances of around 80%
with a maximum of 82.4% of the Northern equity with the actual level to
be announced by Monday morning.
It wanted to replace it with an offer worth 950p. After discussions
with the Takeover Panel it was agreed that would only be permissible if
Trafalgar had the agreement of the Northern Board.
Northern shares fluctuated narrowly during the day with a low of 795p
before closing just 10p easier at 808p.
As the lapsing took place after-hours, Monday morning will see the
brunt of the selling with the stock likely to fall considerably --
unless there is support from those looking for alternative bidders with
names such as Hanson inevitably shooting to the front of the frame. And
if not Northern there are another 11 peas in the pod.
Northern reluctantly granted agreement to the original bid earlier
this week after industry regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild
unexpectedly and dramatically changed the ground rules when he said that
he is considering imposing much tougher price controls.
That threw the sector into chaos and wiped over #4000m off its
constituent members' share prices.
He said that the details of his proposals would not be announced until
June but that he will explain his thinking by March 24. While Professor
Littlechild has demonstrably been stung by the criticisms of his
competence and political ineptitude through announcing his change of
mind, he is now beginning to fight back against the avalanche of demands
for his resignation.
''You would expect share prices to fall, and quite considerably, with
an announcement of this kind. That is why I thought long and hard about
it.''
Northern now has some explaining to do at greater leisure than it
expected as to how it was able to produce the #560m (507p per share)
loyalty incentive package with which it was planning to keep
shareholders sweet -- and still intends to pay.
Littlechild did not think it appropriate to resign and that he acted
in a reasonable way in a difficult situation. He added that if he had
not acted then the regulatory regime would have increasingly lacked
confidence.
And with that remark, he walked straight into the mouth of the cannon
fired by BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance. In a powerful attack with which
most electricity shareholders, gas, telecoms and water shareholders
would agree -- but not necessarily customers -- he accused the
regulators of acting in defiance of natural justice.
In the London Standard he wrote that ''it is inconceivable that so
much power would be exercised, with so little accountability, by the
chairman of a public limited company or a Prime Minister in cabinet''.
He added that regulators should either be made more accountable to
some form of higher authority, or they should be replaced by a panel of
regulators to dilute the current concentration of power. At the very
least they should be flanked by the equivalent of non-executive
directors.
However, Ofwat's Ian Byatt has sprung to Littlechild's defence arguing
that the regulatory system has resulted in lower prices, falling costs
and better services.
Significantly, the biggest advances have been made in terms of
customer satisfaction at BT which has been under the regulatory rein the
longest so perhaps it does take time for the regulator to have real
influence. But it has to be said that BT had Sir Bryan Carsberg to
contend with and he is generally regarded as being the best operator so
far, particularly as regards competition.

GLASGOW-based Direct Line Financial Services today announced a
''massive challenge'' to banks and building societies, with the
full-scale launch next week of its mortgage-by-phone service.
Having built up a projected mortgage book of #100m since the service
was offered exclusively to its 2.5 million insurance customers in
October, Direct Line is now mounting an assault on the entire UK market.
The motor and household insurance giant has increased the number of
financial services staff at its West Regent Street offices from 100 to
160, anticipating a tripling of mortgage business levels after
Wednesday's launch.
However, although Direct Line claims its sole 7.42% (7.7% APR)
variable rate capital and interest product offers lower monthly
repayments, the phone-by-mortgage service is unlikely to have the mass
appeal of Direct Line's insurance services.
The Royal Bank subsidiary claims to beat banks and building societies,
including its own parent company, on an #80,000, 25-year, 85%
loan-to-value, variable rate mortgage.
However, first-time buyers and those moving to more expensive
properties may find themselves barred by the 85% maximum condition.
Nevertheless, Jim Spowart, managing director of Direct Line Financial
Services, claims his company's presence on the national stage will force
a ''serious re-think'' by banks and building societies.

IF there ever was a nationwide loft trawl it is a fair bet that the
most frequently found item would be a children's book. Some of them
might even be very valuable but that would depend on how well -- or how
badly -- they had been handled during their shelf life downstairs.
Condition is of paramount importance in the book world and children are
notoriously bad at taking great care of their possessions.
The other day a reader came to see me with a list of old books that
she had kept from childhood. The condition of each one was meticulously
noted -- but two of them had sad little notes saying ''considerable
disfigurement with crayon''. This meant that they were worthless but
they started me on a trail of finding out which children's books from
fairly recent years would be worth selling today.
Of course some are exactly what you would expect -- books by Beatrix
Potter and A A Milne for example, providing they are first editions and
in immaculate condition. There are other lesser fry that also make
money.
My correspondent had high hopes of a selection of Billy Bunter books,
all of them in excellent condition. However, they only dated from the
1950s or 60s and were therefore too new to be worth much. Her other
hopes were fixed on a very well cared for Children's Treasury of Great
Stories which was illustrated with plates by some famous names,
including Arthur Rackham, Henry Rountree, Helen Monro, Herbert Cole, and
an artist who signed himself T H R. The book owner thought this might be
Thomas Heath Robinson.
It turned out, however, that in spite of the attractive plates and the
good condition of the book, it too was worth very little because it was
published by the Daily Express which meant that the books had been
issued in large numbers and there must be a lot of similar volumes still
about.
So forget about recent Billy Bunters and newspaper special editions,
but if anyone finds a Rupert Bear annual in their loft they might be on
to something more hopeful.
This is the 75th anniversary of the creation of Rupert. His birthday,
in fact, falls on November 8, but already the enthusiasm is rising among
his many fans and the market is about to be flooded with all sorts of
Rupert memorabilia, including special birthday cakes which will appear
in the nation's supermarkets in November.
The perky little bear, with his red trousers and yellow and black
checked cravat tied neatly under his chin, was created as a strip
cartoon in 1920 by an artist called Mary Tourtel whose husband worked
for the Daily Express. When it was suggested that the newspaper needed a
children's cartoon, he suggested that his wife might try her hand at it
and Rupert was born.
Besides being a gifted cartoonist, Mary Tourtel was a pioneer
air-woman, and a rival for Amy Johnson. In 1919, in a Handley Page, she
broke the record for flying between Hounslow and Brussels. Because of
her fascination with flying, all her cartoons seem to be viewed from the
air and Rupert is looked down upon as if from the sky. When Mary Tourtel
created the enchanting little bear with his friends, Edward Trunk, Bill
the Badger, and Podgy Pig, she certainly started something because the
cartoon is still appearing in the Express and is as popular as ever.
After Mary Tourtel's eyesight began to fail, the drawing was taken
over in 1935 by Alfred Bestall, who continued in the job until 1978.
Today's illustrator is his successor, John Harrold, who provides the
pictures while John Robinson of the Express writes the stories.
Rupert books are still being produced in large numbers but the ones
specially worth looking out for are the annuals for 1942 and 1936. In
1942, because of paper shortages, there was a small print run so there
are not many volumes still in existence. One that sold recently went for
#600.
As far as the 1936 annual is concerned, to be worth money it must
still have its dust jacket (and be in good condition, of course -- that
goes without saying for any old book). Anyone who finds a 1936 annual
that measures up to those conditions has something worth around #1600 on
their hands. Even small paperbacks dating from just before 1980 are
worth #20 each today.
Apart from books, the Rupert industry has developed from a strip
cartoon into toy bears, pictures, cutlery, crockery, and all sorts of
merchandise bearing his picture. The most eagerly collected toy is a
''bendy'' rubber Rupert Bear which came on the market in 1969.
Merrythought, the toy company, also make to order a special Rupert which
costs about #90.
Little of the Rupert mania concerns children now and the majority of
collectors are adults. Since 1983 they have had a Rupert Bear club which
has 750 members, and in return for their #7-a-year fee they receive four
editions of the Nutwood magazine, giving details of Rupert oriented
events around the country. To mark the little bear's birthday, there is
to be a special exhibition in the Museum of Childhood in London from
October until January 1996.
In Scotland, the Teddy Bear Museum of Melrose will be marking the 75th
birthday by giving every visitor a free Rupert postcard overprinted with
the dates 1920-1995.
Anyone who would like to join the Rupert Bear Society should send a
stamped, addressed envelope and a cheque for #7 to Shirley Reeves, 31
Whiteley, Windsor, SL4 5PJ.

NO matter that Kilmarnock and Ayr have secured premier league status
in next season's re-organised championship, the clubs are still intent
on winning this seasons third division title.
Today they meet at Bellsland in what will be not only a fascinating
local derby, but also one that could determine the outcome of the
Division 3 campaign. Ayr lead the table with 100% record from 11
matches, while Kilmarnock are only one place behind having won 10 of 11
games.
Both teams have topped the 400pt mark so far this season. Ayr having
reached 432 while conceding 105, and Kilmarnock having 407 to 123.
Ayr hope that their antipodean duo of Jason Barbarich, at lock, and
Jeremey Etheldridge at stand-off will be influential. ''Jason is a
useful player in the middle of the line-out,'' said skipper Jim Lymburn,
''and is mobile about the park.''
Kilmarnock's only league defeat this season was by third placed
Clarkston, who won by 16-14. ''We had a good result against Dunfermline,
we just beat Hillhead'Jordanhill, and although we defeated Edinburgh
University in our last match, I was disappointed with the team's
performance.'' said John McHarg, the Kilmarnock coach.
However, he thinks that home advantage could count for a lot today in
a match contested by what he thinks are ''two evenly matched sides. This
is the biggest match for a number of years for us.''
Kilmarnock, whose fitness advisor is international athlete Brian
Whittle, will look to their experienced pack which contains New
Zealander Chris Fleming at flanker, to control the game in what is
likely to be heavy conditions at Bellsland.

I TRY to convince myself that a house like mine, littered with books,
coffee cups, Tonka toys, plants, flowers, dust, and biscuit crumbs, is
the mark of a creative genius, writes LEILA AITKEN.
Should you recognise the type and are wondering what to give him or
her as a birthday gift, a coffee-table book is the answer -- a book
that's meant to lie around (if there is a clear space, of course).
My number one choice would be a magnificent book by Clive Nichols in
association with the Royal Horticultural Society -- Photographing Plants
and Gardens (David and Charles, #20).
You don't have to be a photographer to find it enthralling. The
pictures take you into another world.
It is a book for garden-lovers, for amateur and professional
photographers, and for all those affected by the beauty of the winter
sun on the first snowdrop or a border of tulips, wallflower, and
forget-me-nots captured at sunset.
Another book which inspired an intense longing to capture a fleeting
moment, but in this case in paint, is Jill Bays's The Watercolourist's
Garden (David and Charles, #14.99). Jill Bays tutors painting holidays
and this ease of communication is reflected in the text.
If you don't paint, but want to, this book will start you off.
Although it is an instructional guide, it is also a coffee-table book
with paintings of flowers and gardens in a soft, Impressionist style to
drool over.

* RUNNING until March 15 at Christie's in Bath Street, Glasgow, is an
exhibition of 40 early paintings by Edward Atkinson Hornel. This is an
opportunity to see the sort of picture Hornel was capable of turning out
before he was lionised for painting cloyingly sentimental and repetitive
paintings of pink-cheeked little girls frolicking in flower-filled
meadows.
Hornel is a painter about whom collectors are divided. Some like him
enough to pay five-figure sums for his works; others, including myself,
particularly dislike the little girls who made his name.
The Christie's exhibition is to promote the current National Trust for
Scotland's appeal for #500,000 to restore Hornel's Kirkcudbright home,
Broughton House, where he died in 1933. The trust took over
responsibility for the house from the Hornel Trustees in 1993. It is a
delightful place to visit, particularly because of the wonderful
Japanese garden that Hornel created there. The trust has decided that it
is necessary to spend #5000 on it although it looked perfect to me when
I was there last year.

IT was a close-run thing. The competition was keen. But finally . . .
we won! I refer to last week's outcome of the Scottish Executive
Challenge, the annual event to test some of Scotland's brightest and
best young managers organised by the Institute of Management with the
support of Scottish Enterprise and KPMG. After a gruelling five-month
haul of research, study and reporting, the four participating teams made
their presentations to the judges last Monday.
Their task had not been easy. There had been 40 volunteers from
companies and agencies within the public and private sectors. They had
been arbitrarily put into groups of 10, and set the task of forming
effective teams capable of responding to the challenge -- which was to
investigate and report on major contemporary issues affecting Scottish
business and the economy.
Those issues included how we can keep the Scots in Scotland, and
whether foreign companies can teach us better management skills.
Each team had its own issue to tackle, and a mentor in the form of an
experienced business figure to provide guidance and contacts. Team C was
landed with me in an effort to help them with their issue: why do so few
Scots start their own businesses?
And last Monday four tense teams duly paraded at the Moat House Hotel
in Glasgow, each seeking to impress the judges with their presentation.
These gentlemen were a tough-minded lot: Nick Kuenssberg, managing
director of Dawson International, Scottish Enterprise's director of
business development, Russel Griggs, and Archie Hunter, KPMG's Scottish
senior partner.
''My'' team had put a heck of a lot of work into their research and
report. Early on they had concluded that a major cause of our national
lack of entrepreneurs is an education system which, in the words of the
report, ''is designed to produce employees instead of entrepreneurs''.
They studied the changes that should be made to the curriculum, ways
of changing culture within the education system and how other countries,
notably Canada, are currently striving to improve their business birth
rate. The result was a snappy series of 10 recommendations for change,
complete with costings.
The proposals included:
* Integrating our education programme with Scottish Enterprise's
existing business birth rate strategy.
* Developing a computer game for schools to introduce the concept and
practice of business as early as the primary stage.
* Extending the successful Young Enterprise and Mini-Enterprise
schemes throughout Scottish education so the majority of pupils gain the
experience of running a small business in their final year.
* Introducing an enterprise badge scheme for scouts and guides.
* Developing a mechanism for encouraging the creation of business
ideas at school.
It all comprised a nicely-integrated programme which Russel Griggs
conceded was close to the actual proposals he and his team are
finalising for launch this summer. After the presentation the team were
subjected to a 30-minute grilling by the judges, and acquitted
themselves well.
Then to the challenge dinner, and the announcement of the winners.
According to Nick Kuenssberg, the judges' chairman, team C won because
their executive summary had said it all, their analysis of the situation
was excellent and their recommendations practical. Their presentation
had been first-class.
Then to the presentation of handsome quaichs and #100 book tokens to
each team member, the opening of the champagne, and the rest of the
night dissolved.
The main point of the challenge is not so much the detail of the
teams' findings, but the way each entrant responds to the discipline and
responsibility involved in a team operation. It is fair to say that the
members of ''my'' team responded strongly and efficiently throughout the
exercise.
So to Andrew Maxwell of Scottish Nuclear, Ray Milne of Scottish Life,
Graeme MacFarlane of Tennent Caledonian Breweries, David Palmer of the
Scottish Office, Antoinette Parr of Victoria Infirmary NHS Trust, David
Reilly of Forth Valley Enterprise, Steve Robinson of Glasgow Development
Agency, John Rodgers of ESL Group, Judith Scott of KPMG and Louise
Stewart of Panda Van Hire . . . well done!
May they go on to surmount many greater challenges. And may the
Scottish Executive Challenge go from strength to strength.
* Alastair Balfour is managing director of The Insider Group.

Cairn last year became the first Western company to sign a
production-sharing contract in Bangladesh, relating to an area the size
of 40 North Sea blocks
FORMER Scotland rugby winger Bill Gammell, whose connections with past
US President George Bush led him into the US oil and gas industry, has
rucked hard to keep Cairn Energy in the game.
Hit hard by the slump in oil prices, the Edinburgh-based group saw its
market capitalisation, which had grown from #5m in 1989 to #75m, plunge
back to #6m two-and-a-half years ago. Cairn's share price plummeted from
more than 300p towards the 20p mark.
However, the company's stock market value is now #50m, boosted by a
$45m gas discovery in the Gulf of Mexico and some uncanny timing in the
sale of part of its US interests. What is more, Gammell believes
potential gas discoveries in Bangladesh could be worth more than Cairn
Energy itself.
When Cairn's shares slumped, its 42-year-old chief executive, a school
chum of Labour leader Tony Blair, had to decide whether the company
should go or grow.
Displaying the same dogged determination as on the rugby field,
Gammell resisted a landslide of advice to recoup money from the
company's US gas interests immediately, waiting instead until the price
was right.
His gut instinct, which he often trusts more than numerical analysis,
paid off and Cairn has extracted $43m from the US in the last couple of
years.
Helped also by a string of clever acquisitions and pioneering moves
into unexplored corners of the globe, the company is now in better
shape.
When Gammell began investing in US oil and gas partnerships in 1980,
what he himself refers to as an accident of birth ensured he was well
connected.
His father Jimmy, chairman of Edinburgh-based fund manager Ivory &amp;
Sime during its glory days, backed George Bush's oil company.
Following in his father's footsteps, Gammell's fledgling ventures into
the US energy industry involved George Bush Junior, a good friend from
the age of six. He spoke to his high-flying friend on the day he was
elected Governor of Texas, at the tail end of last year.
With his father, now 74, also having served on the boards of the Bank
of Scotland and Standard Life, there is no doubting that Gammell Junior
had a hard act to follow.
However, he has his own connections in high places -- he attended
Fettes College in Edinburgh with Tony Blair. Gammell still has a
photograph of the Arniston House basketball team, in which he and the
Labour leader are seated next to each other.
Cairn's deputy chairman, Dick Mabon, is a former Labour energy
minister and, as his guest, Gammell chatted to Blair again for the first
time in 20 years at a recent fund-raising dinner in Glasgow.
Gammell's success on the rugby field also did something to remove him
from his father's shadow. Capped five times for Scotland during the
1977/78 season, Gammell, who ''hated'' auditing, had turned his back on
chartered accountancy to pursue his rugby career. However, he still
married an accountant, with whom he now has two young sons.
He jokes: ''When I grew up, people knew me as Jimmy Gammell's son, and
then I played for Scotland and they knew him as Bill Gammell's dad.''
Gammell took Munro Sutherland, now finance director of Cairn Energy
USA, with him when he left accountancy firm Arthur Young, and the pair
bought a two-man insurance-broking business, moving on to financial
services and fund management.
In 1986, what was by that time Cairn Energy Management took over
control of Ivory &amp; Sime's oil and gas funds, with Ivory taking a 50%
stake in CEM.
Included in the funds was Caledonian Offshore, a North Sea-based
investment vehicle administered on a managed contract basis. In 1988,
Caledonian Offshore acquired Cairn Energy Management, with the former's
North Sea block swapped for Conocco's UK onshore portfolio.
Gammell, optimistic about the future, took the bulk of his stake in
the re-named company in warrants. Ivory &amp; Sime took its share in loan
stock.
To break even by the warrants' expiry in 1998, Gammell, who worked on
the rigs as a student, will have to raise the share price of Cairn above
200p. The company's shares are currently trading around 81p but its
chief executive is confident that his choice of warrants will ultimately
pay dividends.
Advances in computer technology mean the likes of Cairn can now
compete with the industry big boys on a more even footing.
Meanwhile, technological advances on the production side, with
''horizontal drilling'' now possible, will further boost Cairn's UK
onshore oil production, which has grown to 3000 barrels per day from 500
bpd a couple of years ago.
Gammell's entrepreneurial attitude is reflected in the fact that Cairn
last year became the first Western company to sign a production-sharing
contract in Bangladesh, relating to an area the size of 40 North Sea
blocks.
With potential reserves estimated at several trillion cubic feet --
three tcf are equivalent to 500 million barrels of oil -- Cairn may also
find itself involved in the development of the gas and power market
within Bangladesh.
Cairn is currently ''shooting seismic'' in the Bay of Bengal and there
is no doubting Gammell's excitement. He says: ''If we are right here,
the numbers are mind-blowing. The potential we see in Bangladesh
certainly could be greater than the existing capitalisation of the
company, but only time will tell whether we can realise that value.
''If I'm right about Bangladesh, this company in two or three years
time is going to look very different from what it does today.''
There was always a feeling that the value of Cairn's US interests was
never fully reflected in its share price and, with its stake in Cairn
Energy USA having been reduced from 100% to 16.5% over the last couple
of years, some of the cash taken out of the US is being invested in UK
operations.
Whether by chance or design, Cairn Energy's logo ended up in the shape
of a rugby ball, reflecting Gammell's attitude: ''The culture of the
company is to pick up the ball and run with it and run as far as you can
go.''
He is striving for the #100m market capitalisation which he believes
is the minimum necessary for a company such as Cairn to realise its full
potential.
He explains the company name, which dates back to his first business
in the late-seventies: ''The idea of the original cairn was basically
building a business stone by stone, trying to get to the top of the
mountain.''

Don't try to do too much too soon, writes
IAN WALLS, or you'll pay a painful price
I WAS interested in information from the National Back Pain
Association, offering advice to those gardeners who rush out, spade in
hand, to undo the effects of a long winter.
A few hours later they may find they can't stand up straight, and any
movement results in agonising pain. The association hopes that a timely
reminder will help at least some gardeners to avoid this.
Digging is the operation that causes problems. Do some simple warm-up
exercises before you start. Let the muscles be prepared for the
onslaught to come. Wear loose and comfortable clothing, with no
bare-back exposure. Use lightweight, long-handled tools.
Don't be too ambitious with hard digging tasks. Try a little at a
time. Try it every 10 or 20 minutes with a break in between.
If you are busy filling up a barrow, remember you will eventually have
to move it. This can be a heavy job, especially uphill.
It has also been shown that weeding and planting can be back-breaking.
Always plant from a kneeling position. Avoid stretching too far in
front.
Mowing the grass can also be hazardous. Work from the front. Avoid
twisting or swinging from the side. It is suggested that you mow only a
little at a time. With modern power-driven mowers, lawns need not be so
laborious.
As when trimming hedges, make sure you have the right tools.
Avoiding back pain is common sense. Nevertheless, you would be amazed
how many gardeners have to see their GPs every Monday morning.
* Get a copy of the leaflet, with an sae to the National Back Pain
Association, 16 Elmtree Road, Teddington, Middlesex. A short practical
video is also available at #7:49.

SOUTH Africa is to scrap the financial rand and dual currency system
from Monday, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg said yesterday in
Johannesburg.
''The government has . . . decided that as from Monday, March 13,
1995, the exchange control restrictions on the free convertibility and
repatriation of the local sale proceeds of non-resident owned South
African investments will be repealed,'' he said. ''The financial rand
and the dual exchange rate system will thereby effectively be
terminated.''

FOR most of his life Michael Douglas owned a transport company that
carried fresh flowers from Africa for a German company in Manchester.
''They have flower farms in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and South Africa,'' he
explains. ''While we were out there looking at farms I saw this
furniture being made. When I sold my business I was quite keen to get
involved.''
The highly distinctive Jarabosky furniture is made from old railway
sleepers, the timbers of which can be up to 500 years old. The wood,
from all over the world, is chosen for its resistance to termites --
Burma and Indonesian teaks and Australian jarrah, for example. Jarabosky
furniture can be so old that it can make most antiques look youthful --
and yet it's new.
The sleepers will have had trains running over them for between 70 and
90 years in countries like Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Botswana.
When that part of their useful life is over they are shipped to Cape
Town, to the Jarabosky factory owned by Yorkshireman Douglas.
Why Jarabosky? The first part represents the jarrah tree while bosky
is the old English world for wood. It is not the kind of name people
forget. ''We wanted something they'd remember, that would stand out,''
says Mr Douglas. ''Now they all think we're Polish.''
The Hagar coffee table, for instance, measures five feet by three
feet, a handsome design with 6mm glass at its centre which, according to
Michael Douglas, is capable of withstanding the heat of something
straight from the oven. The base is an interesting plinth of
juxtapositioned timbers. Like many of the other pieces it would need a
generously-sized room to do it justice. The price tag reads #695.
The business, now in its tenth year, has been increasing by 70%
annually, sells also to France and Germany and employs 23 in South
Africa. Initially the idea was to wholesale the pieces to retailers, but
''they told us there was no market for it, we'd never sell it'', he
explained. ''They said that if we'd like to make what they wanted in our
timbers, they'd take as much off us as we could supply. I decided we'd
do it ourselves.''
Michael Douglas reaches his customers by taking stands at exhibitions.
His next visit to Scotland will be to Aberdeen for the Game Fair in late
May, followed by the Royal Highland Show at Ingliston in late June and
the Modern Homes Exhibition at the SECC in mid-October. He can be
contacted on 01422-311922.

* Pat Lally, Leader of Glasgow City Council, reveals what he eats and
drinks in the course of a day in local government
I GOT up about quarter past seven as usual, and had a cup of cold
water, a slice of toast, and a very large mug of tea before I left for
work. It was ordinary breakfast tea, though on occasion I have jasmine
or Earl Grey instead.
During the course of the day at the City Chambers I drank innumerable
cups of tea (I wouldn't like to count them) and had one cup of coffee.
At lunch I had grapefruit segments and some roast lamb and potatoes
and carrots in the council buffet, somewhere around 12.30.
As usual, I was interrupted between courses to go out to a meeting. I
didn't have a sweet -- I don't usually have them at lunchtime. I'm
trying to look after my waistline (I'm not sure I'm succeeding!).
Then, when I got home again, I had a small portion of casseroled beef
and rice and more tea. Back to my huge mug! It's five or six inches high
and about four-and-half-inches in diameter and has a rather faded flower
on the outside. It's a very old mug.
In the evening I had a couple of pints with my colleagues (I'm not
allowed to advertise) in a local hostelry.
No supper, just a cup of tea about nine o'clock and another about 12
o'clock, then I went to bed about 1am.
* Pat Lally was talking to Lesley Duncan.

ANY man who, in the space of 12 months, volunteers to take on the
worries of Celtic, paying more than #9m for the privilege, and gives up
more than 50 years of bachelorhood has to be considered courageous.
Maybe you can think of another word.
Fergus McCann would surely argue that in each case he was inspired by
strong emotions but, at any rate, as he passed his first anniversary in
charge at Parkhead last Saturday he was entitled to look back with some
pride at most of what has been achieved to date.
He gives the first year of the new regime eight out of 10 which is
maybe not too far wrong, considering that the club has gone from near
bankruptcy to solvency, has begun the building of a new stadium and has
succeeded like no other football club before with a share issue.
These are monumental milestones which supporters of Celtic, the many
thousands who demonstrated before his arrival and the many other
thousands who simply continued to follow their team, appreciate perhaps
in way that fans of other clubs cannot fully comprehend.
Yet these same supporters are much more interested in the ball game,
results on the park, new players and, most of all, a trophy to herald
the true renewal.
The kernel of those hopes may well lie in the partnership established
by McCann when he brought Tommy Burns to Parkhead in the midst of
controversy that has not yet abated. The chairman of a club and the
manager need not be buddies, but the working relationship has to succeed
or the aims and ambitions of each cannot be realised.
McCann, a single-minded, highly successful businessman, has come into
football with a background of established business practices which he
has put in place, just as David Murray did at Ibrox. Finding the right
man to fit into the manager's seat clearly is not simple. Burns at least
began with an advantage. He was McCann's choice.
Yet there have been stories, not to mention rumours, of differences of
opinion, of the chairman's intervention in transfer deals and contracts.
''I don't intervene, in fact,'' said McCann when we discussed his first
year in office this week. ''We have a good system here. It is up to the
manager to get any employment or transfer deals approved. He has a
budget like everybody else in the organisation. He knows what the
guidelines are and he has a lot of power and authority within that. I
work very closely with Tommy Burns and it works quite well.''
For McCann, the close-up of what team managers are expected to handle
has been one of the suprises in a year that has presented a few for the
Canadian who left his Bermuda home to tackle the revival of the club he
supported as a boy in Kilsyth.
''If you look at what a manager at a club like this has to cover it is
staggering. He has to have a coaching staff, a youth development staff,
he has first team, reserve teams, youth teams, a boys club network. He
has to attend to training plans and he has also to be a man manager
dealing with all these individuals. Plus, he has to be available to the
press, to the sponsors, and to the supporters.
''He has all of these demands upon his time and when it comes to deals
for games or transfers or contracts most managers nowadays would prefer
to be one step away. Their main concern is getting the best out of
players and, don't you think, they have a pretty big job as it is.''
The system at Parkhead, according to the chairman, works this way:
''If Burns wishes to buy a player he tells us what he thinks he wants to
spend out of his budget and it is then up to myself or another director
to put the pieces together with the other party and deliver what he
wants. But it is not always possible.''
That is how the #1.25m deal which brought Pierre van Hooydonk from
Holland was concluded.
In the case of a player renewing a contract, McCann would approve or
disapprove once the negotiations had been conducted between player and
manager.
''Most people in any organisation want to be given guidelines so they
know what they can do. Tommy has a plan for strengthening the side and
he has our full backing. It is up to us to make sure that he has the
resources he requires.''
Maybe there has been the occasional conflict along the way but, in
light of the controversy surrounding the investigations in England over
''bung'' allegations, it might be better to have arguments within a
structured system than the old style of supervision (or lack of it)
which left it all to the club manager.
Downstairs in his office, Burns acknowledged that the system works
fine. He was not likely to say otherwise, of course, but he added: ''The
football decisions are left to me within the resources Fergus can
provide. We respect each other's views and we're both working for the
good of Celtic.''
Back upstairs, McCann, who has insisted from the beginning that he
will spend five years in his game plan to resurrect Celtic, counts two
aspects of the job as slightly unexpected. ''I knew there would be media
attention but I did not believe it could be quite as excessive as it is,
and I have found the sheer intensity of people trying to help, even
within the club, suprising. It is good that they care, but there are
drawbacks when they are quite so committed.''
He would admit to mistakes he has made, but not surprisingly, maybe,
is his reaction to a perception that he has been caught out by the way
the football business works in this country, especially with regard to
the dispute with Kilmarnock over compensation for Burns.
''I don't think I had any misconceptions about the way things worked
in the game but I have been disappointed about the way football has been
structured to make Celtic and Rangers pay so much.
''For example, Meadowbank Thistle brought 283 supporters to Hampden
for our cup match, yet we had to pay 50% of the gate to them, which
included 17,000 season ticket-holders who didn't pay anything on the
day. In effect we pay a cheque to Meadownbank far greater than what we
collect on the day. I admit I had not realised it was all that
one-sided.''
He has his own views about how the game should be structured,
involving rationalisation and reducing the number of teams in the
professional leagues.
''There are too many clubs, not enough money invested in them, too few
supporters and too few good players. I would love to see these smaller
clubs get bigger, but they should do so as a result of investment and
being realistic.''
As far as the dispute with Kilmarnock is concerned, the chairman
stands firmly by his declared innocence. ''We did nothing wrong. That is
the whole point. My only regret is that Celtic have been badly treated.
The appeal at the League is not really an appeal because the committee,
elected by the clubs, is asking their representatives: are you backing
us or McCann? That is not an appeal hearing.'' McCann insists that he
cannot see how he could have done anything different.
''My special concern is that a football organisation, the SFA, has
taken upon itself a constitution that puts it above the law. For any
organisation to claim that power is a very dangerous thing in any
society. Only within the last 18 months has the clause been brought into
the constitution which forbids any person to go to any court. He has to
give up his legal right, and this is with the blessing of FIFA.
''I believe there is something rotten when that happens. It leaves it
open to abuse and I think the fine of #100,000 is an abuse of that
power. In fact, we could have been sentenced to hang, because there is
no limit to what can be done. But let me emphasise that Celtic have
always fitted in with the football structure and we will always be big
supporters of the the SFA as we have been in the past.''
The Celtic chairman would no doubt count this among the set-backs in a
year that has been eventful enough. The low point is easy enough to
guess, that shoot-out defeat by Raith Rovers in the final of the
Coca-Cola Cup final. ''That was very hard to take but in a sense it made
us all the more determined to succeed. We had a share issue meeting the
day after that but we didn't hold back.''
The way the Parkhead fans joined in the share issue inevitably is a
major highlight of Year One for the chairman. ''They have made a
long-term commitment. The money did not come from institutions or large
investors. It was done by the customers. The largest individual
investment was #100,000 and there were only about a dozen more than
#25,000 so it was big numbers of small investments.''
He would cite other major stepping stones as getting the planning
consent for the stadium on time, getting it started on time, ''and
hopefully getting it finished on time.''
If Fergus arrived in Glasgow to find a load of problems, he also met
his match, Elspeth, the lady who became his wife earlier this year. Does
she complain about his notoriously long hours?
''I am the one who complains about her hours.''
Does married life agree with this hitherto confirmed bachelor?
''It is great as long as I do as I am told.''
His hopes for Celtic are that the club reaches a level of
competitiveness and attractiveness that will have people clamouring to
get in to see them.
Is he glad he got involved?
''I would like to wait a couple of years before I give a final answer
to that question. At the moment I'm probably glad on balance, but there
have been minuses as well as pluses.''

CHARTERED accountant Fiona Struthers worked extremely hard as quality
manager of Atkinson Donnelly, the Hamilton firm of CAs, to ensure the
partnership secured the BS5750/IS9000 qualification.
But she missed the big day when it was awarded the certificate as she
was about to give birth. However, this did not prevent her calling up
the office from the labour ward to check everything had gone smoothly.
Colin Atkinson, a partner in the firm, chuckled: ''The baby was born
the day after we received the award, and we suggested it should be named
BS5750, but Fiona did not take up our suggestion and instead went for
real quality and called her little girl Catherine.''

SHARES in offshore oil support group North Sea Assets were up nearly
25% at one stage yesterday, prompting the company to announce it was in
talks which could lead to its complete takeover.
The Edinburgh-registered company, whose head office is in London, said
a further announcement would be made in due course.
The company's shares closed up 4p on 30p, having touched an intra-day
high of 32p.
When North Sea Assets announced a 64% drop in halfway pre-tax profits
to #432,000 last year, it said that, like others in the same business,
it was suffering much tougher trading conditions.
In September, North Sea Assets announced the #6m cash sale of offshore
construction subsidiary Hydra-Lok, one of its most profitable
operations, to Hunting Group.
It also put marine equipment subsidiary Huntly Equipment Rental into a
joint venture with Aberdeen-based Balmoral Marine, taking a 20% stake in
the enlarged company.
North Sea Assets sustained a loss of about #1m on the deal but
eliminated a loss-making business.

Of cabbages and cobaeas: Stewart Fraser on 'rare' plants that only
cost a packet
WORKING my way -- rather belatedly -- through Sutton's excellent 1995
seed catalogue, I came across some items gardeners probably don't
associate with growing from seed.
There is alstroemeria, or Peruvian lilies, very showy for a herbaceous
border and great for cut flowers. Seed can be sown, May to June,
outdoors but it may be next year before you get many flowers.
Then come azaleas, more specifically Exbury hybrids mixed. Best sown
in gentle heat, any time now. It may be three years before you get a
flowering bush, but they're fun to grow.
Asparagus ferns are very useful for conservatory or greenhouse. Not
only showy, they provide fine fronds for mixing in displays.
They will need some heat to germinate and can be a bit tricky. Be
warned that the berries are poisonous.
Astilbes are well known, with tall feather-like stems from June to
August. They can be easily raised from seed sown in spring, in a cold
frame or cool greenhouse.
One can't forget ornamental cabbages, which are the in thing these
days for mixing in flower borders. Sow seed any time now. Put a scatter
of lime down where you intend to grow them. It helps with vigour and
colour.
What about carnations? Especially the border type. You get a good
range, but get the seed sown quickly as they can be slow growers.
You don't generally think of growing clematis from seed. Listed is
tangutica, which produces large lemon flowers. You can sow seed any time
now. When ready, set out at the base of a pergola, fence, or other place
where they can climb.
I like cobaea, or cup-and-saucer plant, an excellent climber. It likes
a really sunny, warm corner. Sow seed any time now.
Then there are freesias, superb for cutting. Grow in a cool
greenhouse, in large pots or well-prepared greenhouse borders. Sow any
time now.
The grevillea is frequently grown as a pot plant and is very
attractive in a conservatory or cool greenhouse. Sow from now on, in a
bit of warmth.
Christmas roses are a favourite with many, and can be produced easily,
sown now, in a cold frame. Be prepared for sporadic germination.
You certainly don't think of growing lavender from seed, but a
Munstead dwarf variety is readily available. Germination can be tricky.
Sow in a warm, well-prepared spot out of doors and forget them.
Passion flowers are well named, as they really are beautiful. They are
generally hardy, in sheltered places. Seed can be sown from now on, with
a bit of warmth. They can take several weeks to germinate.
Radermachera is a very attractive foliage pot plant, if relatively new
on the scene. It will grace a conservatory or porch beautifully.
If you have children, grow a few sensitive plants or mimosa pudica.
The foliage folds when touched. Sow any time now, under glass.
Finally, what about strelitzia reginae, or bird of paradise flower?
Germination will take up to three months, and it will be three or four
years before you have a flowering plant. But they're worth waiting for.

The brothers of the Abbey of Notre Dame were a creative force who left
a sparkling legacy for future generations, writes Andrew MacKay
IT is indeed strange the women that turn up in the course of an
evening's soiree at the pub. A little-known fact is that behind most
bars there is a hassle switch which, on the nudge of the bartender,
releases can-rattling collection agencies and jingling brides-to-be into
the atmosphere. When a pub changes hands, this out-of-the-woodwork
society is often included in the stock at valuation.
The pattern took a different twist for Cellarman on a trip to the far
east, to the Cafe Royal, a grand name for a wee pub just off Edinburgh's
Princes Street. Between man and man came the fair, tall, and blonde with
eyes containing a thousand sparkles. And when she had no can to bear and
sought not cash for peace, we knew we were in the company of the good.
Her name was Leffe and she was born in Belgium, the love child of many
fathers. They were not fathers, really, more like brothers because they
belonged to the Abbey of Notre Dame. Unlike the serious monks of the
Trappist Order, who lived in an enclosed community, the brothers of the
abbey were not so confined and took their pastoral care into local
villages.
Leffe was blonde, and because the brothers were of a creative sort she
was not an only child for long. Her four sisters had distinctive
qualities, too, and were called Triple, Brune, Radieuse, and Vieille
Cuvee.
The good brothers of the abbey looked after Leffe the Blonde and her
sisters for almost 800 years, guarding their trophies with a passion.
But abbeys are no different from bungalows, and when double glazing or a
new front door is needed, the money has to come from somewhere.
Reluctantly, the brothers chose to share their inspiration with the
outside world and Leffe the Blonde was the sacrifice. And that is why
she was flirting in an Edinburgh pub.
Leffe is not exceptional to Belgian tradition, and is served in a
distinctive glass. The goblet has a long stem, and on its side is the
crest of the abbey, which appears to radiate light when filled. In
keeping with British tradition, this glass often falls into the
non-returnable category.
The beer is golden, fragrant, and has a flavour that might be of
Claudia Schiffer in liquid form. Light and dry with spicy aromas, she is
fruity and hoppy dry at the end. But take care, for after a short
session with her Younger's No 3, a fairly potent brew, has the vapidity
of milk. Her vital statistic comes in at 6.6% ABV, a powerful enough
level that might deliver a knock-out blow after a few rounds.
The other Leffe sisters have their own characteristics. Brune is deep
autumnal brown in colour with an aroma that suggests dessert apples. She
is fruity in taste with a spicy dryness at the finish and a similar
alcohol content of 6.3%. Vieille Cuvee is the dark one from the abbey.
Big and malty on the palate with a body that suggests mature years, she
has a warming nature with pleasant aromatics in the finish but should be
treated with respect, having an ABV of 7.8%.
Of the sisters, Triple has the most complicated personality, holding
deep secrets. She is rich and golden in colour with an aroma that hints
of lemons. Vanilla on the palate and strong aromatics at the finish make
her an intriguing flavour. Again a strong one at 8.4% ABV, the ideal
aperitif.
Radieuse is given a low profile, although her name alludes to the halo
that radiates around the head of a saint. She is not a distinguished
member of the family, however, and special malts give her an earthy
flavour and extra strength at 8.5% ABV. Dark brown with a reddish hue,
her rich body offers a wide range of flavours. The strongest of the
sisters.
Blonde is perfect as an accompaniment to a meal, whereas Vieille Cuvee
goes down well after dinner or if your mood is towards the esoteric.
Her sisters are still at home in Belgium, in the abbey near the River
Meuse, and seldom leave the country. However, if the roof springs any
more leaks, then who knows, they may find themselves exchanged for a few
slates.
* Leffe on draught is available at the Malmaison, Glasgow and
Edinburgh; Tron Theatre Bar; Living Room, Byres Road, Glasgow; in
Aberdeen at the Pierre Victoire and the Edwardian Hotel; in Falkirk at
Behind the Wall. In larger Tesco stores a 330ml bottle costs around
#1.30.

THERE is a lot to live up to on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. The majesty of
the Castle at one end and the elegance of Holyrood Palace at the other,
which means if you are going to open a restaurant in the vicinity of
these magnificent buildings, it really does have to be special.
The Witchery by the Castle is right in the heart of tourist country,
situated just a few hundred yards from the Castle and next to the
starting point for the hugely popular Witchery Tours (which are in no
way connected with the restaurant).
The restaurant borrows much from tales that in another lifetime the
site of the restaurant was the heart of witchcraft in the Old Town. Its
upstairs restaurant is decorated in a style which would satisfy any
witch. Indeed, the witch which stares down at you as you eat may either
delight you or leave you feeling glad you were not here a few hundred
years ago!
Downstairs the theme changes quite dramatically. The Secret Garden
restaurant is brighter and more airy. You get the feeling that you are
more likely to come across a mischievous Pan than a malevolent sorcerer.
Great tapestries adorn the walls, there are stunning floral displays,
and huge candles burn at the tables.
I much prefer the Secret Garden, because I like the decor and the
relaxed ambience. The menu is the same in both restaurants and it makes
good use of Scottish produce.
On a recent visit I enjoyed a starter of tomato and basil soup with
pearl barley. The soup was brilliantly rich in colour and fresh in
flavour; the chopped basil added just the right amount of spiciness.
More used to finding pearl barley in Scotch broth, I was surprised to
find it in a tomato soup, but it gave a slightly crunchy and very
enjoyable texture.
Main courses ranged from char-grilled chicken to goats' cheese
ravioli, but I opted for the salmon fishcakes. It has been a long time
since I have eaten fishcakes; the last time it was the frozen variety
and while I had no wish to repeat that experience, I felt sure that if
this were a good experience it would wipe out my bad ones.
The dish consisted of two large fishcakes on a bed of creamed leeks. I
have a particular penchant for leeks, all due to the fact that as a
student I spent a poverty-stricken year in Wales and regularly ate
creamed leeks, leek soup, leeks in cheese sauce, leek and potato pie,
and have never lost my love of them.
The fine breadcrumb coating was crunchy and golden, and the salmon
pink, crumbly, and not at all like anything that ever came out of a
frozen food container.
The salmon was delicately flavoured and beautifully complemented by
the leeks, which had a creamy texture, and were a mix of greens that
perfectly matched the pink of the salmon. The mildly onion flavour of
the leeks was just delicate enough not to overwhelm the salmon but to
enhance the taste.
The char-grilled chicken lay on a bed of shredded cabbage and apples
with black pudding. The chicken breast was not blackened on top but was
crispy, while the meat was succulent and juicy. The sensation of the
dish was the black pudding, which added a spicy taste to the whole dish,
while the shredded cabbage and apple gave it a slightly sweeter edge.
Vegetables are served separately and were an eclectic mix of potatoes,
parsnips, carrots, mangetout, baby corn, and Kenyan beans. I like my
vegetables to be quite crunchy and these definitely passed the al dente
test.
Dessert was a toss up between a selection of Scottish cheese and
oatcakes or the wonderful-sounding strawberry mousse and white chocolate
shavings -- it had to be the latter.
It was most appealing to the eye, especially set against the dramatic
background of a mixed berry coulis that was a rich red colour, with a
smattering of white chocolate shavings.
The mousse was creamy and very definitely strawberry. That delightful
taste of summer came through beautifully. However, the coulis
overpowered it. There was too much coulis on the plate, the mousse was
almost swimming in it, and it was very tart. Once I had tasted the
coulis my tastebuds were unable to distinguish the delicacy of the
stawberry mousse. Served with chocolate or even raspberry mousse, this
coulis would have been tremendous, but served with this delicate
strawberry one, it did not work very well. I would have preferred that
the mousse had been served alone with the white chocolate.
To round off the meal I chose a cafetiere of coffee which was very
good, but I was a little disappointed that it did not come with any
after-dinner mints, shortbread, or home-made tablet.
The service in the restaurant was very good -- even to the extent that
the waiter agreed that the coulis probably was a little too sharp for
the strawberry mousse! When so many tourist centres offer visitors so
little in the way of good food, it is reassuring that there are places
where tourists can take in the country's castles and great food.
What was also appealing about The Witchery by the Castle was the mix
of tourists and business people. It meant there was none of that
seriousness sometimes attached to restaurants that cater mainly for
business executives, and there was a good helping of foreign chatter,
map consulting, and general bonhomie. While I was suitably impressed by
the suave Frenchman who lit his cigarette on the candle, my big
complaint is, as a fervent non-smoker, I would have preferred a
no-smoking area in the restaurant.
RECOMMENDED RESTAURANTS
Pizza Express, 151 Queen Street, Glasgow. Tel: 0141 221 3333.
FRESHNESS seems to be the most important concept in making pizzas the
Pizza Express way. From your table you can watch the chef make the
dough, chop the toppings, and sprinkle the fresh mozzarella.
The base is neither too thick or thin, with just enough to know it's
there and not so much you feel as if you are eating a doorstep. The
tomato sauce is so fresh and light, you could easily imagine serving it
as a pasta sauce.
There is a huge choice of pizza toppings offered on the menu, or you
can create your own. The garlic bread doughballs are a light way to kick
off the meal.
Cul-de-Sac, 44 Ashton Lane, Glasgow. Tel: 0141 334 4794.
THE menu in this popular restaurant is a bit of an ''Auld Alliance'',
merging as it does French crepes and Scottish cooking.
If you opt for a crepe, ready yourself for a huge portion. The chef
does not skimp on the filling, and the ratatouille is one of my
particular favourites.
The dessert menu is not huge, but the choice is good -- for a Scottish
treat there is cranachan. If you want to continue the crepe theme, then
you can have a choice of sweet fillings inside.
Upstairs from the restaurant is a bar which serves a selection of good
pub food.
The Jenny Traditional Tearooms, 18 Royal Exchange Square, Glasgow.
Tel: 0141 204 4988.
If, like me, you are a bit of a tea jenny, then this is the place to
go. Very much in the tradition of the famed Glasgow tearooms of old, the
menu offers a good choice of savouries and sweets.
A good lunchtime treat is the filled brioche. I can recommend the
salmon and cream cheese. But a warning: these are very filling and might
mean you have to forgo the scones.
A nice afternoon treat is the Jenny Tea, which consists of scones with
jam and cream and a choice of teas.

I MAY as well lay my cards on the table and admit to having a very
sweet tooth. Since he gave up smoking a couple of years ago, Godfrey has
developed a sweet tooth nearly as insatiable as my own. This is not to
be encouraged, and, in my daily battle with the calorie intake, I am
ever envious of those who tell me, with a hint of smugness, that they
are never tempted by anything sweet.
I am tormented by all things sweet, in fact I once wrote a book called
just that, Sweet Things. In the last few years I have discovered maple
syrup. I just love the flavour, and we are using maple syrup in quite a
wide variety of puddings for the guests.
Maple syrup is the sap of the maple tree, from the north-eastern
states of America (most notably Vermont) and from Canada. The sap is
boiled for ages to reduce it to the clear syrup that we buy.
Maple syrup has such a delicate and yet distinctive flavour. It used
to be very rare, a real delicacy, and obtainable only from specialist
food shops, with artificial maple syrup much more usual. I'm sure it's
the artificial stuff which put me off experimenting with maple syrup
until comparatively recently; -- to me it had a pretty filthy flavour, a
much thicker texture and is to be avoided.
The real thing, on the other hand, is extremely useful as a panic
sauce for vanilla ice-cream -- it is also delicious poured over coffee
or almond ice-creams. In America, maple syrup is served with pancakes
and waffles for breakfast. I love it, especially with bacon in true
American-style.
But apart from the usefulness of a jar or can of maple syrup in the
fridge as a stand-by, it can be used in place of honey in any recipe. I
have a particulary good recipe for a warm, fruit salad flavoured with
cardamom and ginger, and the recipe starts by gently cooking sliced
apples in honey -- well, this is a prime example where maple syrup can
be used instead of the honey.
Incidentally, the other components of this fruit salad are pink
grapefruit sliced into segments between the pith, halved black grapes
with the seeds removed, and chopped fresh pineapple -- it makes a most
refreshing finale to an otherwise rich lunch or dinner, and is a useful
winter-time pud. You can leave out the cardamom and/or the chopped
preserved ginger and I think I actually prefer it when made with maple
syrup.
We -- this isn't meant to sound so royal, when I say ''we'' I am
referring to myself, Peter Macpherson and Claire Munro who all cook
together here at Kinloch -- make a mousse flavoured with maple syrup and
vanilla, and with toasted pecan nuts. For this I find it is imperative
to heat the maple syrup until it is almost smoking and then to pour it
on to the egg-yolks as I whisk them -- if you try to whisk with cold
syrup it is almost impossible to get a thick mousse-like texture.
The taste of walnuts or, better still, pecan nuts, goes very well with
maple syrup. The trouble with using walnuts is that they tend to go
stale so quickly. To a certain extent you can refresh their flavour by
shaking them in a pan over heat for several minutes. Pecan nuts have a
more buttery taste.
The recipe today is for a tart made with pecan nuts and maple syrup.
It is simplicity itself to make, can be made in advance and warmed up
before serving, and I should think it freezes well, although I have
never tried. I like to serve it with creme fraiche, but it is also
delicious with vanilla ice-cream, and with whipped cream.
To anyone who hasn't come across my peculiar method of pastry making
before, I should explain that I devised it at least 20 years ago because
I am incapable of making pastry which rolls out -- I end up with pastry
like a patchwork quilt.
This pastry is rich, but it has a crisp texture and tastes very good.
Pastry is always better when made in a metal flan dish, but I have yet
to find one which is sufficiently deep and has a removable base, so I
use ceramic dishes. The longer you can leave the pastry in the fridge
before baking the better.
You will note that I bake it straight from the fridge without the
greaseproof paper and beans; this is because I don't like the texture of
pastry baked-blind, as it's called. I feel that the pastry surface
steams under the beans and paper, whereas when the heat reaches the
pastry itself the only slight drawback that sometimes happens is that
the pastry slips down the sides of the dish -- if this happens just
press the sides back up with the back of a metal spoon.
MAPLE SYRUP AND PECAN NUT PIE
Serves 6-8
* For the pastry:
3oz (75g) butter, cut in bits, hard from the fridge
5oz (125g) plain flour and 1 rounded tablespoon icing sugar
half a teaspoon of vanilla essence, or a couple of drops of vanilla
extract
PUT all the ingredients into a food processor and whisk until the
mixture forms fine crumbs. Pat this firmly around the sides and base of
a 9in diameter flan dish. Put the dish in the fridge for at least one
hour, then bake in a moderate oven, 350F, gas mark 4, 180C for 20-25
mins, until the pastry is golden brown -- it will shrink very slightly
away from the sides. Remove from oven.
* For the filling:
8oz (200g) pecan nuts
In a heatproof bowl put the following:
3 large eggs, beaten well
4oz (100g) butter, cut into bits
half a pint (250ml) maple syrup
few drops vanilla essence
2oz (50g) soft brown sugar
PUT the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water and stir until the
butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, then take the bowl off the
heat. Put the pecan nuts over the base of the baked pastry. Pour in the
cooled filling, and bake in a moderate oven until the filling barely
wobbles when you gently shake the dish, about 15-20 minutes. Serve warm.

By DOUG GILLON in Barcelona
DARREN Braithwaite taped up the shoes of the sponsor who dropped him,
but he could not get the measure of Bruny Surin in the 60 metres final
at the World Indoor Athletics Championships last night.
Surin laid to rest the ghost of his discredited Canadian countryman,
Ben Johnson, when he retained the men's sprint title, while Britain's
Braithwaite emerged from the shadow of Linford Christie to take silver.
Surin set a championship record of 6.46sec., beating Braithwaite by
0.05. Another Canadian, Robert Esmie, was third in 6.55.
It was the fastest time of Braithwaite's life, at the age of 26 --
striking one of many remarkable parallels with the controversially
absent Christie. Olympic champion Christie won his first championship
medal, silver at 200m, also indoors at the European championships, and
also in Spain.
''I'm always thinking deja vu,'' said Braithwaite, who beat Christie
for the first time last month. ''It's a pity he was not here. I've got a
medal. I hope this is going to kick start my career.''
He should now have no trouble replacing the shoe firm -- Christie's
backer -- who took him off their books four years ago.
But it was another chapter of ill-fortune for Mike Rosswess, the
reserve who replaced Christie. His semi-final time was identical to that
of German Mark Blume, and Rosswess, displaying no rancour, lost the toss
of a coin to decide who went through.
Surin brought Canada this title for the third time, the inaugural one
having been captured by drug cheat Johnson in 1985.
Merlene Ottey, at 34, the same age as Christie, took the women's 60m
title in 6.97sec, her twenty-seventh major championship medal, and Mika
Halvari, with 20.74 metres, became the first Finn to win a world indoor
shot title.
But it was a a disastrous day for the two young Scottish women in
action. Neither Melanie Neef nor Aileen McGillivary, who have re-written
the national record books this winter, survived the opening rounds of
their events.
For the first time in her career, AAA 400 metres title-holder Neef
failed to produce her best form in a championship. She clocked 53.34,
fourth in her heat, missing a place in the semis by just one hunderdth
of a second.
The City of Glasgow woman had the toughest heat, inexplicably badly
seeded. She faced a former world junior champion, Magdalena Nedelcu, the
defending world champion, Sandie Richards, and Sandra Meyers, the former
world indoor runner-up, who also won bronze at the world outdoor event
in Tokio.
Neef, who ran personal bests at both European and Commonwealth
championships last year, and a Scottish record of 52.57 last month,
believed she could rise to the challenge again. Still second off the
final bend, she faded on the run-in as Romanian Nedelcu powered through
to win in 53.10, a time Neef has beaten in every race bar one this year.
The most impressive performance was from Russian Irina Privalova, the
European 100 and 200m outdoor champion. The former skater glided through
the opening round (52.78), and looks a certain winner, despite the
presence of world outdoor champion Jearl Miles, in tomorrow's final.
McGillivary, first Scottish 60m sprinter to compete in a world indoor
championships, was also an opening-round victim, clocking 7.44 for sixth
place in her heat, from which the winner, Yekaterina Leshcheva (Russia,
7.26) never reached the final.
McGillivary was fastest out of her blocks with a reaction time of
0.127sec, but the middle part of her race did not come together. ''I'm
frustrated, because I know I can go much faster.''
It was her slowest time this winter. Having begun the season with a
best time of 7.43, all her races, until yesterday, had been inside 7.40.
But it would have taken a time of 7.34, two hundredths inside the
Scottish record which she shares with Neef, to have advanced her to the
semis.
The Cumbernauld woman must have been reflecting on the meteoric
improvement of Germany's Paschke. When McGillivary won the European Cup
under-23 100m for Britain in 1992, Paschke was second, a full metre
behind. Yesterday Pashke ran a lifetime best of 7.10 to take the silver
behind Ottey.
Britain's Sandra Douglas was eliminated in the semi with 7.30. John
Regis nursed himself into today's 200m final, clocking 20.94 behind
European outdoor champion Geir Moen of Norway (20.59). Regis however
insists: ''There is not the remotest chance of me doing the 4 x 400
relay.''
Solomon Wariso stubbed the little toe, on his left foot and dropped
out of the 200 semis, and further bad news for Britain's relay prospects
was first-round 400m elimination for Paul Slythe and Mark Hylton.
But Yorkshireman John Mayock shrugged off flu to reach tomorrow's
3000m final.
Women. 60 metres: Final -- 1, M Ottey (Jamaica) 6.97; 2, M Paschke
(Germany) 7.10; 3, C Guidry (USA) 7.11; 4, L Allen (Cuba) 7.13; 5, B

LIZ TAYLOR visits a couple of artists, in wood
and in words, who have got away from it all
IT seems fitting that two artists, one who works in wood and the other
who writes and illustrates books for children, live together with their
family in an idyllic cottage filled with evidence of their artistry.
Tucked away at the end of a long farm lane above Gifford, overlooking
the plains of East Lothian, Jess Christman and his wife Debi Gliori
share a low, stone-built house called The Grieve's.
He makes elegant bespoke furniture and also undertakes special
building projects for clients; she produces books for children, and her
illustrations for her successful Mr Bear series are particularly
charming because they are filled with the sense of peace and
tranquillity that immediately strikes anyone visiting her working
ambience.
Jess Christman found the cottage 12 years ago before he and Debi were
married. He had been brought up on the outskirts of Chicago and came to
Scotland in 1978 to study town planning at Heriot-Watt. He completed the
course in 1982 and decided his heart did not lie in towns. The house was
more or less derelict, a mile and a bit up a rutted muddy lane. Jess has
been working on it and its garden ever since.
The main house is entered through the porch, which is guarded by a
very friendly Cerberus, a black and white collie. In the sitting room a
curved rocking chair with oatmeal cushions stands by an open fire above
which is an old, red sandstone lintel stone bearing the chisel marks of
the mason who put it up more than two centuries ago. A long case clock
made by Jess stands in one corner, chiming the hours with a silvery
tone. On the other side of the back window is his tall, wedge-shaped
bookcase which has a very angular, Charles Rennie Mackintosh look.
Visitors can choose to sit in a slatted, pale wood chair or recline
Roman-style on low kelim-covered sofas grouped around a glass-topped
table with curved wooden legs.
Everything in the room is cool and relaxing; Jess's furniture is
blonde ash and the walls are painted white. On one wall is a picture of
bird feathers by Debi and bundles of dried twigs, cones, and seed heads
fill the vases.
Upstairs are three bedrooms. Debi and Jess have two children,
seven-year-old Ben and baby Sophy, while Debi also has a son, Rowan, of
18. He is studying in Edinburgh but is home most weekends.
Jess has built himself a long wooden workshop adjoining the cottage,
where he works with one assistant.
''When I finished at Heriot-Watt I knew I did not want to work in an
office so I decided to set up in business on my own working with wood,''
he said. ''I have never been formally trained in carpentry but I've
learned as I've gone along, by trial and error, by watching other people
and reading books.''
He calls his business Lammermuir Woodwork. Most of his commissions
come from private clients who find him through word of mouth or because
they have seen his work in exhibitions. His pieces have been shown in
the City Art Gallery, Edinburgh; the Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh; at an
art gallery in Cheltenham; an exhibition of contemporary woodworking in
London's Royal Horticultural Society Hall, and at New York's
International Contemporary Furniture Makers' Fair.
While some modern furniture makers insist on following the natural
shapes of rough wood, which can make their pieces bulky and difficult to
accommodate in small rooms, Jess's furniture has a more disciplined look
and an elegant, light appearance. It is excellently suited to modern
living.
The slatted chair in particular seems almost weightless, as if
floating above the ground. That impression is reinforced by the colour.
Most of the pieces are in blonde wood and he is particularly fond of ash
and elm though he has recently finished a cherry wardrobe.
Scots-born Debi trained at Edinburgh Art College, has published 24
books for children since graduating in 1984, and is kept busy with
commissions from London publishers.
Some of her most popular titles are published by children's imprint
Orchard Press, which rapidly sold out its print runs of her two most
recent books for six and eight year olds, Mr Bear Baby Sits and Mr
Bear's Picnic. Mr Bear is drawn as a beneficently beaming chap playing
with chuckling little bears who bear a distinct resemblance to the
cherubic Sophy.
Debi also produces board books for younger children, again with the Mr
Bear theme. Her most recent titles are Mr Bear Says Peek a Boo, Mr Bear
Says Goodnight, and Mr Bear Says Eat Up.
All of the books are popular with parents who recognise that they are
written by someone who is aware of the problems of parenthood but does
not take them too seriously. As far as Debi is concerned, bringing up a
baby is a delight, not a chore, and her books reflect how she feels.
They also reflect the idyllic situation in which she and her family
live.

EDINBURGH Racers hot-shot Tony Hand last night warned arch rivals Fife
Flyers: ''We want the Scottish Cup back,'' writes Nigel Duncan
Six-times winners Racers lost the trophy two seasons ago, to English
invaders Whitley Warriors. Then the Fifers won -- teenager Stephen
King's last-gasp goal denying Racers 12 months ago as the Kirkcaldy club
took the title for the first time in front of more than 3000 fans.
Hand said: ''The cup was a fixture in our trophy cabinet, and we miss
not having it.''
But Racers are thirsting for revenge and have the edge, with six wins
to Flyers' two in all meetings so far this season.
The tally includes a 6-4 league victory in Edinburgh last Tuesday and
Hand said: ''We're going to Kirkcaldy to win -- and I'm confident we
can, despite us having to meet them on their ice.''
Racers square-up to first division high-flyers Paisley Pirates in one
of today's semi-finals at Kirkcaldy, while Flyers face Dumfries Vikings
in the other.
Barring a major shock, the Edinburgh outfit are expected meet Flyers
in tomorrow's final at Kirkcaldy.
Scotland's showpiece ice hockey weekend also features double-headers
today and tomorrow between under-12 and under-16 sides from Scotland and
Belgium.

Work for the Week
AT this time of year, you either bound out into the garden with
enthusiasm, or creep out half-heartedly hoping there is not much to do,
writes IAN WALLS. The trick is to work yourself into another gardening
season gently, rather than trying to do everything in a mad rush and
ending up with a bad back and aching muscles.
Here are items that may need attention:
Lawns: cut the lawn lightly, with the mower set high. Take the
opportunity to trim lawn edges before they get too whiskery.
Take the chance, also, to clean out the greenhouse, especially if it
is not yet in use. Spray on a good disinfectant such as Jeyes' Fluid,
letting this penetrate before hosing it off. Remember to do the outside
as well as the inside of the glass. Get plants or seedlings out of the
way first.
If the greenhouse is lined with bubble polythene, you cant do more
than wash down the outside. That is at least better than nothing. Give
the fumes a few days to dissipate. If you have an electric propagator,
give this a clean before use also.
In the fruit garden, tie in raspberry canes which may have been blown
about. Remove dead leaves from strawberries. Give ground a light fork
over. Then, apply some organic fertiliser around the canes or bushes.
Weeds such as annual meadow grass may be a problem. It can be
difficult to do much about it. Hoeing is not effective on wet land. At
the first opportunity, on a warm day, spray a contact weedkiller such as
Weedol.
In the vegetable garden, much depends on how dry the ground is.
Ideally, it should have been dug in the autumn. Many of us slip up on
this.
I never turn over ground in the vegetable garden until around the
middle of March, and the ground is dry enough to use a rotary
cultivator.
I appreciate that rotary cultivation is no real substitute for careful
and thorough digging. But that is a painstaking process which takes
time.
Finally, if you are producing a general run of bedding plants
yourself, seeds should certainly be sown by now. These days, you have
the easier alternative of getting in young plantlets. I must admit it is
an option worth considering, although it does cost a bit more.
Keen rose growers will be pruning their roses about now. You can do it
carefully, to three or four buds from ground level and cutting just
above a bud.
Alternatively, get out the hedge shears as a recent report in the RHS
Journal suggested. It is not a practice I like in our wet part of the
world. Wood can die back badly.
Readers' top tips
* A READER tells me that he cuts the bottoms off plastic lemonade
bottles and uses them as mini-cloches. They also keep slugs at bay.
* Another reader, who has excellent pot plants, feeds them regularly
with the cold tea left in her teapot. It helps if the tea is diluted by
filling the pot up with cold water.
* What to do with old newspapers? When you open up a trench, improve
the ground by laying out old papers with a scatter of soil on top.
It's that show again
* THAT Glasgow evergreen, the March Show, is on this weekend in the
Winter Gardens at the People's Palace in Glasgow Green.
Entry is from 10am to 5pm and admission is free. There is to be a
series of displays of floral art by the Scottish Association of Floral
Arrangement Societies, always a popular item.
The show, as always, is organised Glasgow's Parks and Recreation
Department.

If we march into the dawn of a Scottish parliament the Scottish left
will fall apart in bitter recrimination, argues
Lindsay Paterson
''A MAN'S a man for a'that.'' Better than any slogan, this line can
stand for the Scottish political consensus. Fifteen years of opposition
to a foreign Conservative Government seem to have proved beyond any
doubt that the Scots are truly radical. We have resisted the threats and
the blandishments of Essex Man.
That consensus rests in turn, it is claimed, on a tradition of
egalitarianism. Burns's celebration of equality might be problematic
these days in its male language, but the sentiments carry down the ages.
This is the land that produced the radical weavers of 1820, the crofter
militants of the 1880s, the women rent-strikers on Clydeside in 1915,
social leaders such as John Wheatley, Jimmy Maxton, and John Maclean,
and about one million non-payers of the poll tax.
These revolutionaries are not to everyone's taste. But other strands
in Scottish history are available for plundering by other left-of-centre
politicians. The nineteenth-century Scottish middle class exercised
power in a socially responsible way, unlike their allegedly
self-interested counterparts in the south. Their presbyterianism taught
them to have a conscience, even if it was a paternalistic one.
Thatcher's methodism, it seems, taught her only that you had to rely on
your own devices because there is no such thing as society.
With Scottish traditions like these, there is surely no limit to what
can be achieved, if only . . . The current version of that dream is a
Scottish parliament. If only we had that, the radicalism that permeates
Scottish society would have full scope. We would wipe out the Thatcher
years, wipe out the betrayals of Labour compromisers, wipe out
capitalism itself to establish that universal solidarity to which
Burns's song looks forward.
Now, it is easy to see why there does appear to be a Scottish
left-wing consensus. Conservatives are thin on the ground here. The
other parties are indeed left-of-centre. There is undoubtedly a real
tradition of radical politics. And it does seem sometimes that Scottish
aspirations are being thwarted by an absence of control of our own
destiny.
When you tie together all these things with the inspiring poetry of a
folk-rock group such as Runrig or the anti-establishment anarchy of a
novelist such as James Kelman, you get a potent mix of politics and
emotional frustration. And sometimes, in other places, that kind of mix
has forced a revolution.
But visions and rebellions can achieve useful social reform only if
they are tied to an accurate analysis of what is wrong with the status
quo, and to a detailed and practicable programme for change. The problem
with the myth of the ''anti-Tory Scottish consensus'' is that it is
neither good analysis nor good practice. If the myth continues to hold
sway for the next few years, then the political left -- the
representatives of that ostensible consensus -- might find itself in
government in a Scottish parliament with very little understanding of
what to do.
First of all, the myth prevents serious thinking on what being
left-of-centre means in Scotland.
In England, a similar lack of thinking in the 1970s contributed to the
collapse of the Labour Party in the early 1980s. In response to that,
influential intellectuals produced a new account of English socialism,
with an eye to regaining power. Marxists such as Stuart Hall and Eric
Hobsbawm anguished about why the skilled working class had stopped
supporting socialism. Social democrats such as Shirley Williams and
David Marquand asked why the middle class had apparently abandoned its
sense of civic responsibility. And feminists such as Hilary Wainwright
challenged the shibboleths of the old Stalinist and centralist left.
All these thinkers have by now had a tremendous influence on English
left-wing thought, and have helped to bring it to the brink of
government. But their analysis has never produced the same resonance in
Scotland. That is partly because the issues they addressed were simply
not relevant here. The working class has never abandoned Labour (unless
to go to parties that are even further to the left, such as Militant
Labour or, in some localities, the SNP). Only a minority of the middle
class has embraced Thatcherism. And male-dominated centralism until very
recently has not been seen as a problem in Scotland. Indeed many people
quite like it.
We no longer have the old beliefs in central planning. But we do have
the heirs to that. The people who, a generation ago, would have directed
everything from a Ministry in Edinburgh are now the enthusiasts for
''assertive management''. They produce multi-coloured packs on
performance indicators for line managers, and seek to justify these in
terms of accountability. But the accountability is actually to someone
further up the line. Their objection to quangos is limited to their
being stuffed with sympathisers of the Conservative Party. Widen the
circle of the great and the good and everything would be fine again.
Their vision of Scottish identity is thirled to the icons of cultural
nationalism. Scottish culture will flourish provided it can get what the
other cultures have -- monolothic national museums, national opera
houses, and national theatres. And their idea of liberation is limited
to a competitive version of equal opportunities: ''I'm all right Jack''
provided that Jill gets the opportunity to defeat Jack in open combat.
This kind of view is dominant in all three main opposition parties in
Scotland. It is, if you like, the consensus of the Scottish alternative
establishment. They have inherited the presbyterian paternalism that
ruled Scotland right down to the 1950s. They would find little
difficulty in working with the Conservative establishment that runs
things at the moment.
Set against that is a romantic libertarianism that, too, can be found
in all three parties, and that has roots outside them also, among the
community activists and others who are scunnered with the whole
structure of party politics. These people are the heirs of the Scottish
revolutionaries -- the women of the rent strikes or the radicals of the
crofters' campaign. They argue that communities have to be freed to do
their own things, and to evolve their own identity. The problem with
libertarians, however, is that they have rarely addressed the difficult
questions of how to put their ideas into practice.
For example, although council-run schools might be favoured by ''the
Scottish consensus'' over opted-out ones, the agreement ends there. How
these schools are run is open to far more disagreement. Are they to be
managed hierarchically from regional and national centres? Or are they
to be the property of the whole community? But if decentralisation is
preferred, how is that to be distinguished from the right-wing
Conservative version that tries to manage schools as if they were
producers in a market? The Scottish consensus has not been ripe with
answers.
In cultural matters, this libertarian view opposes national
institutions altogether. The sterile squabble over whether a Gallery of
Scottish Art should be in Edinburgh or Glasgow or Inverness misses the
point that the pictures should be shown in as many places as is
feasible. The same could be said about universities. Why don't they take
their classes and conferences to the communities who would want them,
rather than restricting them to Gilmorehill, South Bridge, or Old
Aberdeen? But if cultural decentralisation is to happen, is there not a
danger of fragmentation into poorly funded mediocrity?
Only a rhetoric of anti-Tory consensus can hide the deep gulf between
this romantic radicalism and the paternalism that dominates the non-Tory
parties. The enthusiasts for hierarchical management have more in common
with the political right than with the radicals in their own parties.
Come a Scottish parliament -- especially one elected by proportional
representation -- and the tensions could debilitate the left completely.
And that brings us to the second problem with the myth of the Scottish
consensus. What will a Scottish parliament actually do? For instance,
what will a Scottish Minister of Culture do? Pour money into a national
theatre? Or induce the national companies to lead workshops in
communities throughout Scotland, as well as perform there? In principle,
both these alternatives could be followed. But dealing in abstract
principles is precisely the kind of luxury that is available only in
opposition. In practice, limited resources will force awkward choices.
Similar controversies will arise in other areas of policy. In
education, the big question will be whether Scotland wants to return to
the performing zeal of the 1960s. The Scottish consensus is that
comprehensive education must be defended. But that defensive agreement
will not last long in power. The consensus masks a deep divide between
people who believe that the system is on the whole fine as it stands,
and those who want to take the comprehensive revolution further, for
example into higher education or community education.
But the biggest controversy that will rock the consensus after Home
Rule will be over whether to decentralise government itself beyond
Edinburgh. The apparent agreement that a Scottish parliament is
desirable hides a fault line that runs right across Europe at the
moment.
On the one side are those who have no real objection to the
nation-state as such, but just want Scotland to have its own. This
position is not confined to people in the SNP: it is held by supporters
of more limited autonomy who see no need to pass power on from a
Scottish parliament to local communities. You can be a nationalist of
the old sort without favouring a nation-state. Such people hark back to
the days when domineering Scottish Secretaries constructed a Scottish
consensus to put pressure on Whitehall. In essence, the only change they
want is to replace the Scottish Secretary with a Scottish Prime
Minister.
On the other side are those who want to bring power to communities in
order to reinvigorate Scottish civic culture. These people support a
Scottish parliament only as a means to that end.
These two views cannot coexist. They will split the Scottish consensus
apart as soon as a Scottish parliament turns its mind to local
government, or to the best means of regenerating communities that have
been afflicted by unemployment and poverty.
The question of the purpose of a Scottish parliament brings us to the
third and final problem with the myth of Scottish consensus. What is
this thing, Scotland, to which power is to be returned? Is it a single
entity, confronting another similar monolith, England? Or are both these
countries full of contradictions and cross-currents that bring into
question the whole idea that there is such a thing as a ''national''
mood?
The belief in national homogeneity has its most negative effect in the
growing Scottish bitterness about England. Rehtoric about an English
Tory Government contributes to this: it creates a picture that lumps the
whole of England into a Tory Euro-sceptic caricature. But it is not just
the SNP that is to blame. It is there also in all the Labour and Liberal
Democrat rhetoric about ''Tory-free Scotland''. This ridiculous image
confuses the nation with the majority in the nation. Nations are not
things that are straightforwardly ''Tory'' or ''Tory-free''.
The anglophobia is bad enough. But of more immediate practical effect
is that the image of a unified Scotland obscures important differences
within Scotland. Because the Scottish left ignores this, the Scottish
Conservatives are able to exploit it. They point to regional
differences, for example, as a reason why a Scottish parliament would
not work.
Reality is more complex. There are indeed regional variations in
Scotland, but they are not as simple as the Tories would claim. The
North-east is no more uniformly ''conservative'' than Glasgow is
''socialist'' (or than England is conservative). There is real
radicalism in Scotland's rural areas, mostly now supporting the SNP or
the Liberal Democrats. And there is real conservatism in the cities
(some of it getting quite warm to the Labour Party).
But that rural radicalism is not the same as its urban cousin. Because
the Scottish consensus has ignored that variety in its support, it is
unable to counter the Conservative argument about regional polarisation.
Once a Scottish parliament comes about, that Conservative rhetoric will
be used ruthlessly to undermine its authority. The majority will have to
have adequate answers long before then.
So, what can we say in conclusion? The Scottish left-wing consensus is
not wholly a myth, and has been valuable. The Scots really did reject
the wilder excesses of Thatcherism, and that basis has allowed some
significant institutions of the welfare state to be defended. It is
owing to this that we still have a more-or-less functioning system of
comprehensive secondary education, that the public health service has
not been eaten away by private medicine to nearly the same extent as in
the south of England, and that Scottish culture has continued to engage
with social concerns.
But that consensus is in danger of suffocating us. It has pushed
dissent to the margins. The dissenters have, in turn, been free to
indulge in a lot of romantic rhetoric without the incentive to plan
practically. The consensus has substituted complacency for imaginative
new policies. And it has postponed thinking about Scottish society until
after the setting up of a Scottish parliament.
In short, the leaders of the Scottish consensus are ill-prepared for
autonomy. They have devoted all their analytical activities to how to
achieve a Scottish parliament, and have virtually ignored what they can
do when they get there.
And so I will make a prediction, not one that I find congenial. If we
march into the dawn of a Scottish parliament still believing that the
consensus is strong enough to throw up a programme for government, then
the Scottish left will fall apart in bitter recrimination. And, within a
decade, the Scottish government will be formed by the Conservative
Party. The difference this time is that it will be elected by the Scots
themselves.

PLAYLAND
John Gregory Dunne
Granta, #14.99
OLD Hollywood nymphettes never die; they only fade away -- dissolve is
the movie term -- to become glorified bag ladies living in ramshackle
trailer parks on the outskirts of Detroit, just maybe the ugliest city
in the USA. Blue Tyler had 'em all. Directors, movie stars, writers,
casino-owning mobsters. Ah, the stories she could tell from between the
silken sheets . . .
And Jack Broderick, ace screenwriter and very rich man indeed, wants
to hear them all when he chances upon Blue (literally by accident) while
researching a cop movie in Downtown Motor City. But Blue, even when
she's old and well beyond her shelf life, is still a child of the studio
and sees life through a camera angle, distorted and swathed in a tone,
not of black-and-white or even technicolor, but of amoral grey.
She knows no better; like the life sentence prisoner or the asylum
inmate, she has been institutionalised by the only world she has ever
known -- the imaginary world of the movie studio.
Once upon a time this lady was no lady. She was pure Hollywood. A
child star in the Forties who, when she wasn't sexually serving her
masters, played her cutie-pie parts from the age of four right up to her
late teens. Then her boobs began to show and she couldn't make the
cross-over to adult parts. Roll the credits for blue movies. The End.
Half a century later, living in down-at-heel seclusion and earning a
crust from phone sex talk, Broderick engages her in long conversation
and slowly pieces together her rise and fall. It is the sordid story of
a Hollywood where all that glisters is a make-believe gold. Scratch its
surface and you find a murky mixture of greed, hedonism, dishonesty, and
immorality.
The powerful, compulsive tale that unfolds centres around the teenage
Blue's love affair with gangster Jake King, a character not a million
miles removed from Bugsy Siegal. His New York mob boss -- Morris ''The
Furrier'' Lefkowitz -- dispatches him to a sleepy desert village called
Las Vegas. His brief: to muscle in on the fledgling casino industry. But
he is up against the devil he doesn't know. The mobster, a stone killer
born without a conscience, finds his match in the duplicity of the
moviemakers. There really is no contest.
He is seduced by Blue, an ingenue with no concept of guilt, a child /
woman whose psyche was fashioned by the movie industry. It is she who
provides him with the grandiose blueprint for Playland, the casino he
starts to build in what would eventually become the Land of the Golden
Fleeced.
Beguiled by the nymphette, he makes the fatal mistake of getting ideas
above his station. As the cost of the project spirals out of control,
Jake alienates the outfit and the ageing Leftowitz orders his removal --
from the Planet Earth. Was this why Blue made her sudden exit from the
silver screen? John Gregory Dunne mixes a strong cast of fictional
characters with cameos of real-life figures in this vast and enthralling
novel. Often it takes the form of a movie screenplay, or a police
report, or a newspaper cutting. The result, far from being confusing, is
a beautifully structured story, dazzlingly readable.
Dunne turns a wonderful phrase. You will want to write them down and
use them -- to frighten your enemies. But above all else, Playland is as
shocking an indictment of the Hollywood fantasy factory as you will
find.
With books such as True Confessions and Red White and Blue to his
eternal credit, Dunne is one of America's most accomplished authors, but
this is without doubt his tour de force. Here, for the first time, he
turns his acerbic eye on the so-called golden age of the film industry.
Slowly, he constructs an uncomfortable, almost voyeuristic tale that
lays bare the paranoia and hypocrisy of the McCarthy era moviemakers and
highlights the manipulative nature of the beasts lurking in the studio
system.
In the end, Blue Tyler is an innocent victim in a world where
innocence is the rarest of commodities. Read this book and you will
never, ever, look at an old Hollywood movie in the same way again.

WHEN ex-ambulance driver Eric Gallagher (above) asked friends for
advice in expanding a centre at Lunderston Bay, near Gourock, they were
less than encouraging -- the site was very sloping and exposed to the
south-west, open to gales swirling up the firth, writes IAN WALLS.
Fortunately, Mr Gallagher ignored their views. ''I realised there was
a massive potential for supplying gardeners with their requirements
throughout Renfrewshire and further afield,'' he says. ''A large-scale
centre was clearly the way to go. Anyway, I wanted a change and decided
to take on something really challenging.''
What he has achieved over the years is a credit to his persistence.
For not everything went smoothly. There were contractual hiccups,
weather damage to his buildings, and many other obstacles.
But his 14-acre Cardwell Nursery and Garden Centre is now a very busy
place, especially at weekends, with a tearoom and home baking an added
attraction.
Plans are well under way to increase the existing 20,000sqft of
covered shopping area and provide conference and lecture facilities for
a range of pursuits.
''The public do not like getting wet, and it can rain a lot in
Gourock. It's up to me to provide as congenial shopping conditions as
possible,'' says Gallagher.
''I couldn't have managed to reach the present stage of development
without the help of my family and staff. Some staff have been with me
for more than 20 years.''
''We don't take an exact census of people visiting the centre, but we
probably get between 300,000 and 400,000 visitors or customers a year.
Numbers are steadily increasing.''

GLASGOW High/Kelvinside, now without first-team coaches, have a point
to prove today.
The Glasgow club need to beat Stewarts Melville in the McEwans 70/-
national league match at Inverleith if they are still to have a chance
of being in the first division of the recast championship next season.
Victory for GHK also would end a losing run. They have failed to win
any of their past six league matches after having won the first five of
their campaign, and if they are to beat foot-of-the-table opposition,
they will have to do it without Shade Munro, the international lock
forward who is recovering from groin muscle damage, and Steve Hirini,
the New Zealand stand-off who had a cheekbone fracture during the league
defeat by Gala two weeks ago.
But George Breckenridge, who injured a wrist in that match against
Gala, and Harry Bassi return.
Six of the eight clubs playing today still have the new first division
in mind, and at least one will have to drop out of the running when
Jed-Forest and Dundee High School FP meet at Riverside Park. Defeat will
mean second-division rugby next season.
Jed field a familiar team, even though Ross Murrow is out of rugby for
the season because of a back injury, whereas Dundee are still pondering
how replace their international lock, Stewart Campbell, who will be on
duty with the Scotland squad. But Danny Herrington, Dundee's Scotland A
prop, resumes at tight head after having been deposed by his North and
Midlands colleague, John Manson.
Two capped players, Mike Dods and Ian Corcoran, return after injury to
Gala's team for the Netherdale match against Currie.
Former champions Hawick, still striving for elite status next season,
travel to Meggetland to take on Boroughmuir, who will be without
influential Scotland prop Peter Wright, on national squad duty at
Murrayfield. Lewis Graham deputises.
The Greens field David Gordon on the right wing in place of the
injured Cameron Murray.

BRITISH skiers now have their sights on Norway where the annual World
Telemark Championships will be contested at Hafjell in just over a
week's time.
The championships, which attract more than 150 competitors from more
than 10 countries, have teams of nine men and two women.
Almost a third of the team are former British Alpine skiers who have
diverted their passion into this demanding and growing discipline.
Lesley Beck, the former World Cup slalom skier who is the only person
to have won five British combined Alpine titles, is a recent devotee,
and is making her first appearance in an international Telemark race.
Of the men, Mark and Kerr Blyth, also former British Alpine team
racers, have the best hopes of success. Mark, a 29-year-old Glasgow
surgeon, scored the best result ever for a British skier at the Telemark
World Championships in Italy last year with twenty-eighth place, but
this season he has been overshadowed by his younger brother, a
27-year-old Edinburgh interior designer who took a share in the British
title, and who, like Beck, will be racing at his first Telemark world
event.
There are five events during the week. The World Championships title
is decided over a Giant Slalom race and the demanding Classic, which
contains a Giant Slalom section, but includes threejumps of between 20
and 30 metres, two skating sections of up to two minutes' duration, two
Reypeloekjas or 30-40 metre climbs through a series of poles, an off
piste section and a washboard (bumpy rollers). Also included in the
week's programme is a parallel slalom, a masters (over 30) race, and a
mountain race.
Internationally Telemark racing, which is also strong in North
America, as well as parts of Switzerland and Italy, is in it's first
season under the auspices of the International Ski Federation. British
team:
MEN -- Mark Blyth (Glasgow), Kerr Blyth (Edinburgh), Gregor Brearley
(Penicuik), Keith Geddes (Glenmore Lodge), Tom Grunnel (), Owen Robson,
(Edinburgh) Graeme Robson (Edinburgh), Nick Martin. (Aberdeen), Patrick
Winterton (Perth). WOMEN -- Cally Fleming (Nevis Range), Lesley Beck
(Edinburgh).

IT had been a great meal, and we were chatting over coffee. All of a
sudden, one of the women uttered the D-word. Whoops. Delivery alert! We
men tried to retreat from the table to avoid the only conversational
detour that's worse than the one about Marks and Spencer. Before you
could say: ''You might pay that bit extra, but it's worth it in the
end,'' the chat revolved entirely around a million pregnancy
related-stories.
Not just stories about those women who were present, of course. No,
they were about friends, relatives, relatives of friends, friends of
friends, or the girl in the ward that needed three kilos of sewing
thread ''down there''. In fact, it had the potential to cover any
pregnancy which had taken place in the Western hemisphere since the
years when home deliveries were a sensible alternative.
This line of patter is a sign that we are of a ''certain age''. Among
our friends of late, children have been popping out more often than
contact lenses. (Hold it everyone. Nobody move. I think my placenta's
just fallen out.) You can see them scanning life's checklist.
''Ski-ing holiday? Yup, done that. Marriage? Yup, that too. Kids? . .
. I don't think so. Gerard have we had any kids yet?''
From what I see, there's a change in your genetic make-up that takes
place as soon as the Big Decision is made. Women tend to decide that
they want a child with the same conviction that they have when choosing
a new hall carpet. Hall carpets don't get up at three in the morning
especially to vomit on your pillow, so this confidence is entirely
inappropriate.
Even if there is no official Big Decision, the conception occurring
''by accident'', then by the time her hormones are rearing up and down
like a brat on his new bike, she'll have convinced everyone (especially
herself) that this is ''the nicest accident she has ever had''.
I'm a genuine, caring, guy. Some would even say I'm a nice guy. I have
tried to empathise with this whole child ''thing'', but I've failed.
Believe me, the New Man is merely a fitment of some ad-man's overpaid
imagination. Men will never manage to be truly sensitive when it comes
to pregnancy.
Lesson One in the Being A Right-on Male handbook deals with hearing
News of a Birth. ''You should, with a little practice, note the name,
sex and (if possible) the weight of the baby. Remembering these facts
symbolises solidarity with the mother, and women elsewhere, so try your
best.'' The concept in which you will otherwise be held by any female,
mother or not, is a potent motivating force for remembering whether the
baby is a boy of five-eight or a girl of eight-five.
Most men can tell you who scored in the 1956 cup final, what religion
they were, and what make of whistle the ref was using. Four days after
the event, however, even New Man won't be able to tell you if his
cousin's wife has had a boy, a girl, a false alarm or a new Ford Escort.
New Woman, like Old Woman before her, is contractually bound to find out
the exact division of labour, and the nature of any medical intervention
required.
Soon there'll be a woman on Mastermind with the specialist subject of
''Deliveries in the Greater Glasgow conurbation, 1979 to the present
day''. Among women, the weight is probably the single most interesting
piece of information, it being a great conversation piece. Anything
greater than 6oz is greeted by ''What a bruiser!'', ''Rather her than
me!'' and a thousand other phrases which all translate as ''I don't
think my rear end could take one that size''. An hour's worth of stories
then follow, all involving blood, guts, and babies weighing 15-eight.
Talking about pregnancy brings out strange qualities in women. When it
comes to describing others, they have their own vocabulary. Each
pregnant woman falls into one of three categories. They're either
''trim'' (meaning ''pregnant but quite skinny''), ''neat'' (meaning
''pregnant but very skinny''), or massive (meaning ''looks pregnant'').
Of course, as soon as a woman makes the Big Decision, any sense of
modesty or privacy is removed. A major clause in the Women's Contract
states: ''Anyone who conceives and/or bears a child, agrees to have any
part of their anatomy discussed after dinner in Suzy and Allan's.'' This
comes just after the infamous: ''No car shall be parallel-parked in less
than 25 minutes'' sub-clause.
If Mr New Man is a myth, so is the notion that childbirth is anything
other than a Very Painful Thing. This fairy story is supported only by
some misguided men, and some particularly cracked women. Any man who can
describe the hours watching his wife in spasmodic, excruciating pain as
''magical'', ''mystical'' or ''beautiful'' is either deaf or sick. God
knows what they'd be like if they went to the dentist's with her.
Men shouldn't even be allowed in, as they either faint or say moronic
things like: ''Keep on breathing.'' In the midst of a prolonged
contraction, I apparently said to my wife: ''Don't bite so hard on the
Entonox mask. That'll not do your tooth any good.'' In my book, that's
reason enough for hiring two contract killers. There's not a jury in the
land could blame her. I cannot remember saying it, of course, but that
one's been stored for four years, just waiting for the right moment, ie
last night. But that's another story.
After the delivery, if pain relief was offered or, worse, accepted,
some women (usually the ''extremely mad'' faction of the Loony Brigade)
may pass comments regarding the delivery being tantamount to a sham or a
fraud.
If anyone insisted on having their appendix removed without any
anaesthetic they would (quite rightly in my view) be regarded as highly
disturbed. If however, they go through a 12-hour delivery without so
much as an aspirin, then they're held up as a beacon of freedom for
women everywhere.
Childbirth may well be something that our ancestors endured without
modern medical intervention but so was TV and look where that got them.
I confess that I'm not a fan of pain. When I'm at the dentist's, I don't
care if the numb area extends beyond Paisley, or if my left side is
paralysed -- I like my mouth to be properly anaesthetised.
Nine out of 10 females agree that if it were the men who had to have
babies, they would only ever have one each. Wrong, if men had the
babies, they'd be women too. Then no-one would be able to program the
video.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry squeezed into the last 16 of the Kloster
Thailand Open at Bangkok's Imperial Queens Park Hotel yesterday with a
5-4 first round victory over Welsh teenager, Mark Williams.
But it was touch and go for the world No.1. With a 4-0 lead, the Scot
appeared certain to reach the last 16. It all went wrong as the
19-year-old Williams, from Ebbw Vale, raised his game to win four frames
in a row and force the decider.
Hendry was in trouble as the Welshman, who had recorded breaks of 70
and 61, led 33-0 in frame nine. At that point the Scot regained his
composure and by the time he reached the brown ball, his opponent
required snookers.
''I couldn't see myself losing once I had gone into a 4-0 lead,'' said
Hendry. ''But when Mark drew level, it was a different picture. The
momentum was with him and I wasn't sharp enough.''
Alan McManus joined Hendry in the last 16 following a 5-3 victory over
Mick Price.
McManus now faces Terry Griffiths or Gary Wilkinson in the second
round with Hendry up against Ronnie O'Sullivan or Doug Mountjoy.
Welshman Anthony Davies, the world No 64, fell victim to the first
upset of the tournament when he was beaten 5-2 by local amateur Paitoon
Polboon in the wild card round.

A woman alone, she took on the wide open spaces of Australia and lived
to tell the tale, as Julia Langdon discovered
You put me through the
world's most humiliating
obstacle course. But
God, how I loved you
WHEN people first meet Sara Henderson, they apparently usually get
something of a surprise. She knows that they expect a toughie, the sort
who might chew tobacco and spit out of the side of her mouth.
The cover of her best-selling autobiography*, which portrays her in a
stetson, drinking out of a tin mug, and wearing a denim shirt with the
sleeves rolled up ready for action, rather assists the expectation. And
yet, what you find is a gentle, middle-aged woman, feminine, even --
dare one say it? -- somewhat mumsy.
But, then, looks are indeed deceptive. Henderson has run a cattle
station in one of the toughest parts of the world, Australia's Northern
Territory, where conditions -- according to her own conservative
estimate when she moved there -- were a century behind other parts of
the country. She has made the station a commercial success, despite
inheriting a mountain of debts from a philandering bounder of a husband.
She has won recognition for this, first as a Businesswoman of the Year
in Australia, and then, having told her story, as Author of the Year
when her book was published to acclaim and achieved initial sales of
250,000.
Henderson is a heroine off the pages of her own book; but it is a
painful story told in a self-effacing, matter-of-fact manner. She is a
survivor: she has learned to deal with crises of a kind that a
gently-raised, middle-class Sydney girl with early hopes of a career in
professional tennis would scarcely have heard about; not just money and
men and sailing in typhoons but, of course, crocs and snakes and water
pumps and all manner of challenging horror.
She is a heroine, in particular, for other women. She gets letters and
phone calls from people saying: ''I married a bastard, too, and, oh yes,
I loved him'' -- as she loved her Charlie, albeit she writes in her
epilogue: ''Charlie, you put me through the world's most demanding,
humiliating, and challenging obstacle course any human could be expected
to endure . . . but God, how I loved you, you son-of-a-bitch Yankee
bastard.''
The book has just been published in Britain; its sequel, meanwhile, is
already on sale in Australia and the next one is on the way.
Henderson is 58, a widowed mother of three, a grandmother, and now a
celebrity across several continents. She has become used to the idea,
but is still pleased to find herself doing something other than fighting
with accounts books on the cattle station, a million acres of it and all
so remote that home is 200 miles by air from Darwin, more than twice
that by road, and 50 miles from her own front gate.
Not that she has ever apparently demonstrated a conventional approach
to accounting. When her American war-hero husband, Charles English
Henderson III, died and she discovered the extent of the
''insurmountable problems and unbelievable debts'' with which she had
been left, she played the stock market. It was either that or sell the
property, and her daughters told her to ''go for it, Mum''. She bought
shares because of the name of a maid, or the family dog, or by accident,
and she was extraordinarily lucky.
''I should be sitting like a grandma, knitting bootees,'' she says
now, smiling over the Earl Grey in the sophistication of her London
hotel, on the other side of the world. Instead, she is under pressure to
provide a date to attend her granddaughter's christening before the
child grows out of her christening robe; Henderson has had to admit to
the family that she has only one week free before July. She is
travelling the world, at the behest of her publishers and her public,
and she is loving every minute of it. ''It's certainly a lovely reward
late in life,'' she beams.
Henderson deserves that reward. She was swept off her feet by her
Charlie, who whisked her initially to a life of pampered luxury in the
Far East. He had mentioned, in passing, on their first date, his plan to
buy a cattle station. She had forgotten about it when they were living
in Manila.
''At this point in my life,'' she writes, ''I suppose you could say I
had it all. I was utterly and completely in love with my husband; I had
two beautiful children; Charles was building his empire, and success was
in the air. It seemed too good to be true, and it was.''
Her husband's switchboard operator arrived to tell Sara that she was
pregnant by Charlie; Sara decided to leave him; he held a pistol to his
head so she didn't; they went broke. The next thing, she found herself
landed at an airstrip wearing a white linen coat, white Garbo hat, and
with her white-gloved hands holding those of her two little girls in the
middle of a dusty nowhere.
Nearby was a tin shed which she inspected and found had no running
water or electricity. She was waiting for her husband, who was driving
to Bullo River, and when he arrived she suggested they went to the house
immediately so that she could put the children to bed. ''This is the
house,'' he said.
Henderson's story is remarkable enough, told with a pleasing, dry,
laconic style and would have been a good read without knowledge of
Charlie's shortcomings. They were not, in fact, initially in the book,
but after encountering some strangers who knew her husband, his story,
and his style, she decided it was wrong to present him as an apparent
goody-two-shoes.
She put in 50 pages of inserts about his ways and his womanising, but
there were many things she could not write. The hurt was so deep that
she could not dig it out after the heartbreak of its burial, and there
were other things she describes as too dark and dreadful.
Charlie was the sort of man you couldn't help but like, and she
acknowledges that some women are attracted by scoundrels. She met
another a year or so ago, but she knew she could not handle a similar
relationship again and she ran.
Henderson is, in fact, rather chary of any relationships, and finds
that men are a bit nervous of her. She can stand up and speak to an
audience of 800 men -- although she doesn't much care for public
speaking -- and believes that they suspect her of being what she calls
''a bit too . . . '' She explains: ''They think: 'I don't know that I'd
like to take her on'. They go round me as if I'm a bomb.''
Another subject about which she has not written is her estrangement
from her eldest daughter, which came about partly because of the
family's financial problems when Charlie died, and led to court action.
Although it has now been resolved, Sara found it too painful to write
about and is still uncertain about what will happen.
''I've never had a daughter who didn't like me,'' she says, curtly.
''I adored my own mother.'' But her life is happy now. She may be
financially comfortable but, as a survivor, has learned that there are
more important things. The house is comfortable, too. She has stopped
building, adding to that tin shed -- she stopped, in fact, when she had
got about a quarter of an acre under the roof. She loves the place. It
is where she is happiest and she wants to spend the rest of her life
there; for nine months of the year, with the other three months spent
writing by the sea. She deserves it.

<TEXT>
ONE thousandth of Britain's population will be at Twickenham next week
to see if Scotland can do something they have only managed twice since
the Second World War -- and that is to defeat the English in their own
backyard.
We managed it in 1971, and 1983. It's all a bit scary, really.
Psychologically, the match is a nightmare -- just what brinkmanship
will the English display as a pay-back for David Sole's slow march in
1990.
Tactically, it's like trying to crack a code when you know that once
you have cracked it, the chances of using it to your absolute advantage
are remote. The problem with England is that you know what they'll do.
It's just difficult trying to figure out what you can do yourselves to
put them off.
I've got both teams written down.
OK, here goes. We will struggle in the scrums for the first time this
season, which means that the transfer of the ball to scrum half after
the put-in will have to be rapid, which, in a perverted way, will be a
good thing.
We will find it hard to get our own lineout ball, and they should get
theirs. They have backs who are bigger and faster than ours, as well as
being very good looking. But, and I believe this, we are small, daft,
and Scottish, and should be more mobile than them.
So we act like demented bampots. We may not all be that way, but Craig
Joiner, I thought, just made you ask the question against Wales as to
whether he was getting a bit rumbustious when he chucked Wayne Proctor
to the ground. It actually takes the opposition quite a long time to
find out that you are actually quite a nice bunch of boys, you know.
Then we go at, and don't run away from, their big English pack.
I always thought that the biggest mistake you could make was to play
away from the opposition strength. You play AT the opposition strength
if at all possible. Gavin Hastings, at times, should run at Ben Clark,
get him and his pals just into the open field, on the ground maybe, and
then we go blind. Or he stops them close to the origin of the ball, and
the boys in blue head for Rob Andrew after a switch.
I also think that their back row will lumber in defence. From scrums,
and lineouts, we feint to a position in the pitch, make them take a step
in that direction, then we go somewhere else.
For instance, with a healthy left blind side, what would stop Bryan
Redpath from shielding Eric Peters for a quick No 8 pick up in channel
one, he takes two steps open, gives it to Townsend in the open standing
flat, Redpath blocks Bracken, Wainwright blocks Rodber, Townsend fires
it across the back of the scrum to Chalmers, maybe, on the blind -- and
we go there.
Or else we feint blind, and go open. Make them change direction. Get
their back row half a yard further from the next breakdown, off balance,
having to think again.
The rest, as they say, is rugby, but I do think that the object of the
game is to destroy, and distract, their back row. The rest of them are
not that mobile.
But they will get the ball, possibly lots of it. Once they have it,
and have secured it, then we are in trouble. Once they maul, we have two
options because they have two types of maul. You can't afford to let
them start their straight mauls because you can't stop them legally. I
have seen New Zealand teams deliberately wheel opposition straight mauls
to get the ball carrier who was at the back to the side of it. Then they
banjo him, and try to drive a wedge between him and the rest of his
pack. We might try the same.
On their screen mauls, they have Rodber and company, with their backs
to us, rolling off each other and that's a problem that can only be
fought by putting them back into the source of the maul, that is back
into the middle, or, again, trying to get the ball carrier adrift from
the rest of his mates and on the ground with the ball on or side.
Difficult.
No, the key seems to me to be trying to stop them setting anything up
at all. In lineouts, I'd try forget jumping in the middle on certain
codes and wait for Bayfield to re-enter earth space and then get
Campbell to take him out their side of the lineout immediately. Banjo .
. . right out their side.
They can only set up on the front and the middle, so we try that
there. The back three, well, sorry boys, but it's a lot more exposed out
there.
The forwards, as always, hold the key to victory. They have the
unenviable task of getting some posession, keeping it, and stopping the
English from doing the same. It's a game of chess with few of that
game's niceties. It's war.
See, acting like bampots by the way, it always works.

SCOTLAND'S Peter Nicol produced a great performance, but just failed
in his bid to dethrone world champion Jansher Khan in yesterday's
semi-final of the #30,000 Andersen Portuguese open in Lisbon, writes
Elspeth Burnside.
The world No.5 was the last player to beat Jansher in a world-ranking
tournament -- in the Welsh Classic 13 months ago and he again threatened
to cause a major shock before losing 15-10, 5-15, 15-9, 15-6.
The match lasted an hour and 17 minutes, and it was of exceptional
quality, with the turning point coming in the middle of the third game.
At that point, Nicol led 5-4 but lost six points in a row, including
three from unforced errors.
While disappointed, Nicol should take satisfaction from his display.
He lost heavily to the world No.1 in the final of the Hong Kong Open six
months ago, but proved yesterday that he is getting closer in his
relentless pursuit of the top spot in the game.
''I felt I played well in the first two games, but he just eased away
and my legs started to go near the end,'' said Nicol.
''This was my first ranking tournament of the year, and I feel I'm
still a bit short of match practice.''
Nicol's next tournament is the British Open in less than two weeks'
time. It takes place in Cardiff, the scene of the Scot's historic win
over Jansher.
In the other semi-final, England's No.2 Peter Marshall secured a
British presence in the final with a 15-14, 15-9, 15-11 win over
Australia's Rodney Eyles.

MANDATE OF HEAVEN
Orville Schell
Little, Brown, #18.99
CHINA is the last foreign country. Across the globe the homogenisation
of culture quickens, yet the Middle Kingdom remains obdurately itself.
Hollywood is everywhere. Yet China, huge and secretive, remains an
enigma. Or so we prefer to think.
Since the massacre of 2000 demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on the
night of June 3, 1989, China has been transforming itself. The last of
the old men are dying, economic development is frenzied, a new spirit is
loose, and the outside world is leaking into state Communism's last
bastion like water through a crumbling dyke.
But even when China changes and begins to become more like us, we
respond with cliches of awakening dragons and an East no longer
blood-red.
The process cannot be ignored, but what it might mean is still too
little understood. Western money seeks investment opportunities
(massacres notwithstanding) and Western politicians seek accommodations:
tomorrow will otherwise see to itself. The changing nature of what is,
potentially, the greatest power on earth continues to escape us.
Orville Schell's study leaves few excuses for ignorance. He depicts a
''new generation of entrepreneurs, dissidents, bohemians and
technocrats'' in China shaping a revolution as profound as anything
wrought by the Long March. He describes how, by instituting a policy of
headlong economic development, Deng Xiaoping, senile now and dying,
hoped to buy off opposition in China, of how the Chinese people seized
their chance, and of how, in the process, Deng may just have contrived
his party's destruction.
The idea was simple: if a want of material goods was all that stood
between the party and the people's love, then the people would be
showered with material things and helped to forget about democracy.
Decades of pent-up entrepreneurial flair were thus released but, as
Schell suggests, the naive Marxist materialists of the party
misunderstood the nature of consumer demand. In the modern world ideas
are as much a commodity as electronic toys, and China is, in every
sense, the biggest market on the planet. Yet what really fascinates
about Mandate of Heaven is the wealth of telling detail. Schell begins
at Tiananmen, the biggest public quadrangle in the world and the
symbolic heart of Chinese public life. He gives an absorbing account of
the killings there and traces their consequences through the lives of
exiled dissidents and party hacks alike.
His final section -- simply entitled, The Boom -- describes dizzying,
sometimes squalid, economic progress since the massacre, and prosperity
manifesting itself in BMWs, rock stars, racetrack developments, land
speculation, rising standards of living and, everywhere, corruption.
What China has undergone, writes Schell, was, ''a form of unregulated
capitalism that made the US and Europe seem almost socialist by
comparison''.
There was nothing inscrutable about the process, however: in a land
long inured to history's japes, the pendulum simply moved from one
extreme to another. In place of party discipline came the discipline of
the market; in place of political brutality came economic brutality. The
Chinese have changed horses, but have yet to travel very far.
The irony of all this is that Deng, the wily old Communist, emerges as
an unwitting advertisement for the revolutionary potential of
capitalism.
Having rendered China ''schizophrenic'' - state-controlled yet
entrepreneurial - he seems to have imagined that the ensuing tensions
would not require, in the Maoist sense, resolution. People have made
smaller mistakes.

NICOLE Bobek emerged as the surprise women's gold-medal favourite at
the world championships yesterday in Birmingham.
The American turned in the best performance of the short programme to
take the lead going into today's decisive free programme at the NEC.
Bobek, who had to qualify on Monday, arrived in Britain to be faced
with newspaper articles detailing her private life which includes a
conviction for ''home invasion'' of a fellow skater back home in
Detroit.
Her exhuberant display impressed the judges, who gave her a 5.9 for
technical merit and five more 5.9s for interpretaion -- easily the best
marks of an otherwise lacklustre opening round.
Russia's Olga Markova was second, with China's Chen Lu ending the day
third.
Bobek overshadowed favourite and five times European champion Surya
Bonaly, of France, who could finish only fourth in the short programme.
Oksana Grischuk and Evgeny Platov later confirmed their status as the
successors to Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean as the world's greatest
ice dancers.
The American-based Russians retained the title they won in Japan last
year and saw off the challenge of Finland's Susanna Rahkamo and Petri
Kokko.
But the performance marked the end of an era when both the gold and
silver medallists revealed they would be following Torvill and Dean into
the professional ranks.

THE campaign to save BBC Scotland's radio coverage of rural affairs is
being stepped up.
The BBC has announced that the ten-minute daily output which has been
transmitted over the last 50 years is to be dropped as part of a
cost-saving exercise.
But in the last 24 hours there has been a dramatic increase in the
attack on BBC Scotland's bosses.
At the Scottish Labour Party conference in Inverness the proposed
axing of the programme at the end of this month was decried as ''totally
irrational''.
The Scottish Farmers' Union has also stepped up its defence of the
information broadcasts by asking all members and officials to contact
politicians and to write to BBC Scotland controller John McCormick,
protesting about the removal of what is seen as an invaluable link for
rural dwellers.
Yesterday BBC Scotland said it had received only ''a handful'' of
objections but many more can be expected when the SFU campaign begins to
take effect.
Some people have likened the protests as similar to the one which was
launched to save The Archers when that programme was under threat.
A senior BBC producer said: ''You have a situation where Radio 4
broadcasts two hours and twenty minutes of agricultural news over a week
but here in Scotland they want to remove a link on countryside matters
which concerns everyone who lives on or depends on what happens in the
agricultural and related industries.''
SFU president John Ross said: ''We resent the move away from public
service broadcasting involving an industry that generates #2000m a year
and involves employment for 200,000 Scots.''
Mr Ross plans London-lobbying activities next week and will gain
support from the TGWU and from Barbara Kelly, the president of Rural
Forum and also chair of the BBC's rural advisory committee. Mr Ross and
SFU chief executive Tom Brady will take adavntage of next week's
Scottish Affairs Committee inquiry into Scottish agriculture to raise
the communications issue.
When the BBC Scotland agricultural unit was moved from Edinburgh to
Aberdeen in the 1970s the then farming producer Pat Chalmers, later to
become BBC Scotland controller, believed that a specialist unit based in
a rural centre would help disseminate farming-based information to a
much wider public.
That was supported by the BBC Scottish Agricultural Advisory
Committee.
Yesterday the Scottish Agricultural College said it would oppose any
reduction in the information network which keeps farmers and crofters
from as far apart as Shetland and the Borders aware of potential crop
and livestock husbandry problems.
Professor Phil Thomas, SAC principal and chief executive, told the
Herald he was dismayed at the proposed programme closure. ''It would
strike at the very heart of public service broadcasting. If expenditure
on Scottish Farming News cannot be justified there can be little case
for public support of other parts of BBC Scotland's output.
''Scottish Farming News is a programme of enormous value to the rural
areas and is widely followed and enjoyed by a large number of listeners
both in rural and urban areas. It serves an increasingly important
function in making the urban population aware of food, agriculture and
environmental matters -- all subjects of high public concern.''
Professor Thomas rejected the argument that the Radio 4 farming
programme could meet the national demand for specialist output as it was
very much seen as an English programme.

SMALL g: a SUMMER IDYLL
Patricia Highsmith
Bloomsbury, #15.99
LAST month, the uneasy entertainment of reading Patricia Highsmith's
latest novel, the first for 12 years, turned into the regretful pleasure
of reading Patricia Highsmith's last novel. The news of her death
arrived midway through a book that her publishers, with unconscious
prescience, have called ''a departure''. I fancied that beyond the grave
the writer's drooping eyelid folded in a wink.
When Tom Ripley, the caring sociopath, pulled off some homicidal prank
to protect the civilised tenor of his contented family life, he often
''shook with silent laughter''. Highsmith's shadowy sense of humour is
even more unobtrusive, yet it's hard to escape the feeling that Small g:
a Summer Idyll is an elaborate piece of mischief; the last laugh of a
writer who, sensing she is overdue at the great library in the sky, has
decided to tease all those critics who found the absence of moral
sensitivity in her work distasteful.
Highsmith's psychological thrillers broke the rules of the
crime-writing genre, including the fundamental one that crime doesn't
pay. ''I find the public passion for justice quite boring and
artificial,'' she once said, ''for neither life nor nature cares if
justice is ever done.''
In her last novel she breaks her own rules. Life and nature connive to
effect a kind of justice for the sympathetic Rickie, the tyrannised
Luisa, who have in common their bereavement -- the death of a young man
they both love. With Petey's murder, a casual, drug-induced knifing in a
Zurich alley, Highsmith's ''departure'' begins shockingly enough, on
familiarly grim ground, before sidestepping into Jakob's
Bierstube-Restaurant and a curious deadpan comedy of sexual manners.
Jakob's is the Small g (''one of the guidebooks on Zurich's
attractions so categorised Jakob's -- with a small 'g' -- meaning a
partially gay clientele but not entirely'') and its magnetic field pulls
Rickie, Luisa, and their contacts, some gay, some straight, some
bisexual, into an orbit of yearning where their separate desires rarely
collide.
They dance, they pine, they drink beer and wine and espresso coffees,
and for all their competing sexual ambitions they support each other.
They are the innocents of this summer idyll, its nymphs and shepherds;
its hobgoblin is the homophobic couturiere Renate, the oppressive
employer / landlady of homeless Luisa. Renate's closet craving for the
girl is the engine of her spite, and when handsome Teddy joins the Small
g coterie it becomes more and more alarming.
And here's where Highsmith is at her most tormenting. The deceptively
plain style, the unadorned prose, are the tools of that devastating
technical skill which inspired Graham Greene to call her a ''poet of
apprehension''. Apprehensive we remain for the nymphs and shepherds,
never quite certain where Renate's malevolence will lead, what new
mischief she will find for her half-witted henchman Willi, or how
Rickie's efforts to thwart this ill-natured alliance will rebound.
The summer passes, the hint of menace persists in the warm evening
air. This is Highsmith at her most enigmatic. The morally ambiguous --
some say amoral -- neutrality of her darkest novels finds a lighter,
more partisan tone in the sexually ambiguous ambience of Jakob's, but
never quite disappears.
She has even placed the Small g in Switzerland's most ambiguous city:
Zurich, where the prim Swiss vision of civic tidiness and state
respectability is undermined by drug traffickers and money launderers,
but where, in Highsmith's unpredictable town, a powerful police force is
represented by no-one more threatening than Freddie, the gay cop who
picks up Rickie for speeding and sex and becomes a valued member of his
circle.
Partricia Highsmith was 75 when she died in Locarno, and had been
settled in Switzerland for some years. Was it odd that the most anarchic
of crime-writers should choose the most orderly of European countries
for her adopted home? Perhaps it provided a safe refuge for her
dangerous imagination, making it impossible for the reader to decide
whether her final novel was a planned departure, a piece of fooling
around, or an impulsive change of heart.

WINTERDANCE:
The Fine Art of Alaskan Dog-racing
Gary Paulsen
Victor Gollancz, #15.99
AN uncompromising read, 254 pages of non-stop, breathtaking excitement
as sparsely written as the bleak, frozen Arctic landscape it describes;
the story of one man's love affair with a pack of snarling,
half-civilised dogs, and an incredible description of the most dangerous
race in the world, the 1180-mile Iditarod dog-sled contest from
Anchorage to Nome in Alaska.
Paulsen writes with stunning conviction. I was with him through every
mile of his horrendous journey. I felt the biting wind on Finger Lake;
died a thousand deaths as I tumbled out of control down Rainy Pass;
shuddered in the Yukon River Valley as the temperature dropped to 60
degrees below; screamed with fear as the treacherous sea ice splintered
in Norton Sound.
The race begins in Anchorage on the first Saturday in March; 70 teams,
each comprising one man and up to 15 hard-bitten, steel-strong,
razor-sharp dogs that will as soon eat each other as anything else;
wild, yellow-eyed, strong-shouldered animals, barking mad, like no other
dogs on earth, more wolf than dog, intent upon but one thing -- running.
Paulsen was 43 when he ran his first Iditarod, and completed two more
before being forced to quit because of a heart condition. He kept one
dog, Cookie, his lead bitch -- more sister and best friend than dog --
and if the book lacks anything then it lacks information about how
Paulsen became so obsessed with the Iditarod and with his animals.
There are hints. He was in the army, he mentions the My Lai massacre
in Vietnam; he abandoned civilisation to be a trapper in Minnesota; no
money, home a forest cabin. His wife and children are shadowy figures,
seemingly only part of his grand obsession.
It is hard to classify Paulsen, indeed to classify anyone who becomes
obsessed with the wilderness: Jack London, Ernest Seaton, K W Richmond,
Wilfred Thesiger, Freya Stark, John Ridgeway. They are a breed apart,
not really of this world; continually searching, yet, at the same time,
escaping from some deep-rooted inner fear; constantly adrenalised.
Early in the book, Paulsen gives an account of almost dying with his
dogs in a snowstorm. A fellow ''musher'' helps him to survive: '''Cold?'
my friend asked. I put the cup down but kept staring into the fire. 'No.
Scared . . .just scared -- you know. Life. All of it.''' Paulsen has
given us a wonderful story, full of humour, pathos, adventure,
seat-gripping excitement -- and a glimpse into the mind of a man in love
with his environment and his fellow creatures.

SUPERNATURAL AND ENGLISH FICTION
Glen Cavaliero
Oxford University Press, #18.99
THERE'S something strange about this book. It takes possession of
individual spirits and turns them into the plot of a literary landscape
that is forever English.
''English novelists are haunted by the presence of mystery and
strangeness,'' Cavaliero asserts on his first page, then cites ''the
cases of Dickens and James Joyce''. Once you drop the name of Joyce you
cannot make sweeping conclusions about English fiction, for Joyce, it
must be obvious to everyone except Cavaliero, was not only not English
ethnically, but wrote as a man conscious of his own culture -- ''the
uncreated conscience of my race''.
Discussing Hogg's The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified
Sinner (1824), Cavaliero disputes the influence of Burns's Holy Willie's
Prayer on the novel, so invokes a ''Swiftian inexorability''. Yet Hogg's
text is firmly set in a Scottish context, his religious fanatic coming
from a country of religious fanatics. Like Holy Willie gossiping with
God, or James VI, in Daemonologie (1597), droning on about the Devil.
Cutting off a book from its cultural origins presents Cavaliero with
problems of interpretation. For him, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and
Mr Hyde (1886) is a ''dramatised enactment of schizophrenia'' though
schizophrenia, a term introduced in 1911, was the last thing on
Stevenson's mind when he wrote his allegory of addiction and
imaginatively re-created the low life he had embraced while running
native in his native Edinburgh. It is not necessary for all readers to
know how Stevenson shaped his story, but Cavaliero writes as a critic,
not a casual reader.
When he approaches another native of Edinburgh, Muriel Spark,
Cavaliero discovers ''typical English whimsy'' in a short story, then
goes on to analyse The Ballad of Peckham Rye (1960) as an example of
Spark's ''grasp on the material world''. Had Cavaliero appreciated the
range of the distinctively Scottish tradition, he would have realised
The Ballad of Peckham Rye is a variant on Hogg's Justified Sinner. Spark
makes her Scottish devil in the image of Hogg's Scottish devil.
Putting Scottish matters aside, let us look at other classics of
''English fiction'' as understood by Cavaliero. Dracula (1897) -- by
Dublin-born Bram Stoker -- is criticised because ''where women are
concerned, Dracula flounders in the morass of Victorian
sentimentality''. Strangely, Stoker's work is a fantasy of sexual
perversion: not only is Count Dracula a bloodsucker, but his opponents
are driven by an irrational desire to abuse female flesh. In order to
free Lucy's soul from her bloody body, some eminent Victorians hammer a
stake into her heart: ''The body shook and quivered in wild contortions;
the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut and the
mouth was smeared with a crimson foam''. With its orgasmic overtones,
this is hardly sentimental.
The Turn of the Screw (1898) by Henry James -- born in New York of
Irish and Scottish ancestry -- is ''one of the most widely discussed
ghostly tales in English fiction''. Never mind that a great American
critic, Edmund Wilson, wisely discussed the tale in an essay honouring
James as ''a classical American writer'' inspired by ''the ideals of the
United States''. For Cavaliero, The Turn of the Screw -- like Hogg's
Justified Sinner -- illustrates an inquisitive attitude which is ''the
distinguishing feature of the English fictive imagination''. A desire to
see beyond the surface of reality may be an admirable creative impulse,
but it is not exclusively English.
Cavaliero comes close to undermining his own argument when he admits
he avoided ''the American supernaturalist tradition'' -- Hawthorne and
Poe and the like -- as this ''would require a whole book to itself''.
Thus American artistic independence is recognised when it suits, whereas
the artistic independence of other nations is ignored for the purposes
of this book. I note this, not to make a narrowly nationalist point, but
to question Cavaliero's imperious, and imperial, use of the epithet
English.
Look at it another way. English critics would be outraged if Scottish
critics described Frankenstein (1818) as a Scottish novel, though it is
more Scottish than English critics like Cavaliero, suppose. From June,
1812, to May, 1814 (minus a seven-month interlude back in London), Mary
Shelley was sent by her father and stepmother to stay in Broughty Ferry,
a town complete with a fifteenth-century castle. In her introduction to
the third edition of 1831, Mary felt it necessary to mention her
familiarity with Scotland.
''I lived principally in the country as a girl,'' she wrote, ''and
passed a considerable time in Scotland . . . on the blank and dreary
northern shores of the Tay . . . where unheeded I could commune with the
creatures of my fancy.'' Eighteen when she started Frankenstein, two
years after leaving Scotland, Mary originally opened her story with the
words ''It was on a dreary night of November'', and the epithet connects
with her memories of Broughty Ferry. Victor Frankenstein's confession is
framed by the letters of Robert Walton, who describes his voyage to the
North Pole, surely prompted by Mary's sea voyage of 1812 to Scotland.
Mary clearly experienced nightmarish moments in Scotland and recalled
them in making the Frankenstein monster.
Cavaliero mentions none of this in a book bound by his simplistic
belief that everything can be explained by advancing English tradition.
As an intelligent man, Cavaliero should have explored autonomous
cultural alternatives.

A DOUBLE with Kilcolgan and Ceilidh Boy at Ayr yesterday gave Borders
permit-holder Dawn Goodfellow her third winner in five days, writes Tom
McConnell.
Leading Prospect won for her at Edinburgh on Monday and yesterday's
double gave the Earlston trainer her best ever sequence of three from
three.
She is now the leading Scottish permit-holder with six winners, one
clear of Alistair Whillans.
Kilcolgan, bought for #8200 from the dispersal sale of the late Arthur
Stephenson, led from two out in the Hollybush Novices' Chase and kept up
a steady pace under Brian Storey to beat Sheelin Lad by 20 lengths. It
was the chestnut gelding's first success in 20 starts.
Cornet was found to be lame at the start of the Mad March Hare
Handicap Chase leaving only Ceilidh Boy 11-8 and Ninfa 10-11 to fight it
out. They matched strides until Ceilidh Boy took a slight lead at the
eleventh where Ninfa made a bad mistake and from there on the favourite
was beaten.

AMIGOS has to be the form choice for today's Imperial Cup at Sandown.
He has shown steady improvement over a hat trick of wins and both his
past two runs clocked the fastest time on the card.
This is a big step up in class but he takes it under a light weight
and with enough experience.
Trying Again has twice been runner-up in top-class company but goes
best in the mud and is not helped by the drying breeze reported at the
track.
Star Player needs the going to stay soft to compensate for a trip that
is sharper than his recent runs.
Northants has been targeted at Chepstow's Tote Handicap Chase and
could not have put in a more impressive prep race than his run at
Newcastle when he left some decent rivals some 25 lengths adrift. He
goes well on sticky going and can score again today.
Shamarphil may offer each way value to punters hedging their bets. He
has always been in contention in his runs this season and was not
disgraced to be second to The Frog Prince last time out.
Sheer Ability met more able company in the Racing Post Chase but can
gain compensation in the HMS Sandown Handiscap Chase.
The only rival in the same class is Mr Bostona who ran a cracker to be
third in the Anthony Mildmay here in January but may now be better over
a longer trip than today's.
At Ayr, Heliopsis may settle favourite for the Harcross Handicap
Hurdle on the strength of his recent win at Wetherby.
However, that was over a longer trip and it may pay to oppose him with
Plumbob who finished five lengths in front when the pair clashed at
Newcastle.
Nawrikd spreadeagled the field over course and distance last month
with Carousel Rocket a well-beaten second and can chalk up another
victory for Len Lungo's yard.
* PRINCE Arthur, trained by Peter Chapple-Hyam, will be the subject of
a Jockey Club inquiry after prohibited substances were found in the
colt's urine.
The newcomer was second, beaten a short-head by Didina, when favourite
for the Theale Stakes at Newbury on October 20.
The Horseracing Forensic Laboratory reported that analysis of the
sample confirmed the presence of trimethoprim and sulphadiazine, both
anti-bacterial agents used to treat minor cuts.
It has also been confirmed that Mobile Messenger, trained by Tom
George, was found to have a prohibited substance, in this case
4-hydroxypropranolol, in his urine after winning the Oak Novices'
Handicap Chase at Southwell on November 25.

A RADICAL re-think of current attitudes to sheep health, which could
see the end of sheep markets and dealers as they currently operate, is
required if the industry is to reverse the declining health of the
national flock, says a leading academic.
Dr Gerald Coles, senior research fellow at Bristol University's
Department of Clinical Veterinary Science, has found that sheep scab,
lice and keds are becoming more common.
Drug-resistant parasites continue to develop and spread. He places
much of the blame on the Government for withdrawing regulations on sheep
health without ensuring that another regime can take its place.
Writing in The Sheep Farmer, Dr Coles advises: ''You must recognise
that every sheep coming on to your farm may be introducing a range of
diseases. No serious sheep breeder should buy lambs, ewes, or rams
without stringent health checks before they are brought into the flock.
Much better would be to buy only from flocks of defined disease status.
''The sheep markets and sheep dealers as we currently know them must
become a thing of the past if sheep health is not to deteriorate,'' said
Dr Coles. ''I believe we need an effective sheep health scheme that
takes account of a range of diseases and will financially reward sheep
farmers who belong to it through improved value for their animals.''
At present sheep farmers were buying all sorts of diseases at the
market and introducing them into their flocks, he said. ''No serious pig
breeder would ever do that.''
One way of tackling the problem, he suggested, would be to have
sections of markets which would deal only in sheep of defined disease
status where buyers could be assured: ''If you come through here you are
not going to get any of these diseases.''
At the moment, he said, the system was spreading all sorts of
''nasties''. ''We cannot go on in such a haphazard way.''
Dr Coles said he did not advocate a return to compulsory dipping
because not all flocks required it. ''What we need is a scheme which
says the farmer should get his flock clean and then you don't bring in
anything which is not clean,'' he said.
It was currently estimated that the leather trade was losing about
#50m a year because of poor quality pelts and hides. One factory had
closed in 1993, throwing 300 people out of work, because they could no
longer get quality sheep pelts.
If the money to support a sheep health scheme did not come from the
government it would have to be financed through a levy paid by farmers,
he suggested, but he still foresaw a role for the agriculture
departments as only they had veterinary investigation centres
distributed across the country.
''To subsidise many sheep producers and then ignore the health of
their sheep does not make sense to me,'' he said. ''Disease control is a
highly-specialised topic and requires ongoing research because
technology and diseases do not stand still. This is particularly true
with the emergence of drug resistance.''
* A NEW injectable cattle treatment for parasites could also be the
answer to the growing problem of sheep scab, say the makers -- Cyanamid.
Trials in Wales and Ireland have shown that replacing the usual single
dip with a single jab of the new drug, Cydectin, has provided effective
scab control, although the company recommends two jabs 10 days apart.
So far the cattle treatment, which is only available on prescription,
has not been approved for use on sheep in this country although it is
being used extensively in South Africa and South America. The company is
currently in negotiation with the Ministry of Agriculture on its use in
Britain.

DAVID Milne set out on arguably the world's toughest race last weekend
with excess baggage on his sledge -- the daughter of a Scottish
immigrant who paid $650 for the privilege of travelling the opening
seven miles of the Iditarod.
Milne is the first Scot to contest the 1200-mile trans-Alaskan
sled-dog race from Anchorage to Nome, which commemorates the relaying of
diptheria serum to the epidemic-stricken outpost in 1925. The winner is
expected to arrive early next week.
To raise funds, the organisers sell seats for the opening part of the
20-mile prologue, before the race proper gets under way. To ride with
five-times winner Rick Swenson cost $1000. Because Milne is the first
Scot, a Glaswegian exile bought the ride as a birthday present for his
daughter.
It is to be hoped that the lass in question is not of a sensitive
nature. It is probably pure coincidence that Milne's sled broke later
on. ''I went over a huge rut,'' he confessed.
Given that even the sea, when it freezes with six-foot high waves
intact, qualifies as ''a rut'' then no aspersions should be cast about
the effect that the additional passenger's weight might have had.
Milne was fortunate that his accident did not occur on sea ice, but in
wooded country. He chopped down a willow tree, effected running repairs,
and continued to McGrath, which he reached in fortieth position.
There he was able to get a new sled, and continued, and he is
confident of finishing.
Milne's parents have flown out from Dundee, where their son gave up a
job in accountancy to pursue his dream of competing in the event. They
are hopping ahead of the race by plane as their son drives his team of
16 dogs through the Arctic wastes.
The 58 starters are chasing $350,000 in prize-money, with $52,000 plus
a $30,000 Dodge truck for the winner, down to $6500 for twentieth -- not
to mention lucrative pet food contracts. Milne, however, is carrying
salmon and chicken for his team, and cuts them into cubes with a chain
saw.
The Iditarod is the biggest event on the Alaskan calendar. At the
start there were thousands on the streets, and several TV crews.
Day-to-day life in Anchorage demands the roads be kept clear of snow, so
the night before the race, convoys of lorries collected tons of snow on
the outskirts, then dumped it on the streets to allow the sledges to
run.
Because of rock salt and road grit the dogs have to wear special
bootees to protect their paws. One woman has helped Milne, stitching the
velcro on to 1500 pairs of bootees.
Another backer has provided #1000 worth of batteries needed for his
sledge headlights, and a Davy-light contraption on his helmet. ''Many
competitors travel by night, especially this year, when it is so warm,''
said Milne. ''Although it is below freezing, it's not as cold as the
dogs are used to. Something between minus 10 and minus 20 is ideal.
''Unlike the leaders, who are driving their teams upwards of 13 hours
each day, I am running mine for no more than 12. The object is just to
finish. I have a young team, and the aim is to give them experience for
Swenson to use them next year. Dogs remember the route far better than
humans.''
* SERGEI Bubka, one of the few true athletics superstars to grace the
World Indoor championships in Barcelona, where he competes today, can
move around the Catalan capital with far more ease than he can back home
in the former Soviet Union.
Last month, Bubka agreed to compete in the Russian Winter Games only
if a bodyguard was provided. So poor has law and order become, and so
highly developed the entrepreneurial instincts of the criminal classes,
that they are now targeting international sportsmen, because they know
to demand payment in hard currency.
Bubka, who commands an appearance fee of $20,000 every time he
competes, and a bonus of $30,000 for each world record (35 to date,
indoors and out), knows his market value. But he also knows he is a
target -- hence the bodyguards, and his move to Berlin.
His precautions were not overplayed. At the meeting, two Bulgarians,
world bronze medal triple jumper Iva Prandzheva, and high jumper
Svetlana Lesseva, were robbed of $20,000. Rodion Gataulin, the world
No.2 pole vaulter, had his St Petersburg flat burglarised and so
paranoid is Muscovite sprinter Irina Privalova that she will go nowhere
other than her home, and the training track.

EDINBURGH businessman Charlie Jackson would dearly love to change the
kick-off time at Twickenham as Scotland's rugby team goes for the Grand
Slam against England next Saturday.
Jackson of Change Management International is also president of
Hamilton Accies and obtained tickets for the big game long before it
took on the significance of a championship decider.
He later had a bout of amnesia because he also booked up a golfing
holiday in Spain with a friend and does not fly back into London until
around 5.15pm on March 18.
Shaking his head, the former Accies coach told Business Diary: ''I did
not make the connection in dates when I agreed to this golfing holiday,
and I was certainly not anticipating that this match would turn into a
Grand Slam decider.''
Jackson contemplated asking the rugby union authorities to put the
kick-off time back a few hours, but then thought that he might be
out-voted by the thousands of other Scottish rugby fans who can't wait
to let rip with ''Flower of Scotland''.
His mix-up, however, will bring a pleasant surprise to two other rugby
lovers as his tickets will be returned to the club and sold again at
face value.
Attractions of
B&amp;B at Bar-L
ROBBIE Glen, governor of Cornton Vale women's prison, had the 1000
guests at the West of Scotland branch of the Institute of Petroleum's
annual dinner rolling in the aisles earlier this week.
He described Barlinnie Prison as Riddrie's finest bed-and-breakfast
establishment and said that it must be doing something right as many of
its clientele returned with great regularity.
He pointed out that the Bar-L had a higher room occupancy rate than
the Glasgow Hilton and, unlike the five-star hotel, did not have to seek
customers from beyond the local area.
Main speaker of the evening was Pik Botha, South Africa's minister of
mineral and energy affairs, who appealed to his business audience to
invest in South Africa.
The dinner was chaired by Bill Beaton who is chairman of the
institute's West of Scotland branch and is, of course, former general
manager of the Clydesdale Bank.
Sporting tips
from money man
DON Argus, chief executive officer and managing director of National
Australia Bank, parent company of Clydesdale Bank, was in Glasgow last
weekend and passed on the Scottish Training Award the bank had won to
Fiona Hynd its training and education officer.
The bank, it seems, got the award for a course in negotiating skills
it had developed for its managers.
His brief stay included going to the Welsh rugby international. He
told staff at the awards ceremony that when he phoned home to Australia
following the game his friend down under thought he was taking the
mickey when he described watching the game in a snow storm. It seems the
sun is shining in Australia when they enjoy the sport and many Aussies
have never seen snow!
The National Australia Bank boss is keen on the sport, and when asked
by some of the Clydesdale staff what he thought of our chances against
England, he suggested we should do well provided our forwards stayed
tighter together.
Asked if he would be giving the same opinion when he visited the staff
of National Australia's other subsidiary, the Yorkshire Bank, he merely
smiled. Obviously a graduate of the managers' negotiating skills course!
Powerful new
tartan for band
MEMBERS of ScottishPower's pipe band will be sporting a new tartan of
their own when they jet out to China in April to take part in an
international band festival in Beijing.
Colin Liddell, ScottishPower's director of corporate communications,
is chairman of the band and he told Business Diary why it had changed
its colours. It seems it started off life as the British Caledonian Pipe
Band. In need of a revised rig-out to match the source of its
sponsorship, it was decided the opportunity should be taken to create a
new tartan.
''We used the colours linked to ScottishPower such as purple and green
in the tartan. The green is unique and we have decided to use it in our
company gifts,'' he explained.
Colin Liddell is enjoying his relationship with it, as his father
played the pipes in the world-famous Muirheads Pipe Band, and he has
fond memories of attending many band competitions as a child.
Fresh hope on
payment delays
SMALL and medium sized businesses will no doubt welcome the Commons
statement by Corporate Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans that the
Government wants to bring about a change in the ''business culture to
encourage shorter payment times''.
In his written reply the Minister said: ''My department proposes that
directors of public companies should state in their annual reports what
their policies are towards paying their suppliers.''
Great, but I don't think too many small businesses will be holding
their breath.
Scheme gets to
art of matter
THE Government has relaunched the Business Sponsorship Incentive
Scheme which has been running for 10 years as the Pairing Scheme.
Companies which have never sponsored the arts before will have their
cash matched pound for pound by the Government. If seasoned sponsors
increase the amount they put in, an additional #1 will be given for
every #4 they add.
The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA) has
matched up appropriate sponsorships such as Sheppy Fertilisers and the
play Lettuce and Lovage, and the Steel Can Recycling Information Bureau
and the Rubbish Reclaimed exhibition at the Livesey Museum.
If you are interested in finding out how your firm could double its
sponsorship benefits, give Katherine Shaw at ABSA's Glasgow office a
ring on 0141 204 3864.
Cashing in on
TV success
TALKING of sponsorship, the Bank of Scotland has decided to co-sponsor
Scottish Television's The Business Game along with Scottish Enterprise.
Scottish TV is at present on the look out for companies which have
been going for two to six years and would like to compete for the
#10,000 first prize.
The 13-part series, which is entering its fourth year, will appear on
our screens in September.
Even if your company does not win the first prize, it cannot do your
business any harm to have it publicised on TV.
Bank asks for
loan advice
AND while we're on the subject of the Bank of Scotland, I hear it is
poised to bring out a new loan package aimed at small businesses.
The bank, which makes a serious attempt to maintain a good
relationship with its business customers, is going to great lengths to
ensure it gets its package right. To this end it has invited Jim
Torrance, Scottish policy spokesman of the Federation of Small
Businesses, and Bill Anderson, its Scottish secretary, to come along on
March 27 to the bank's headquarters to give their opinions of the new
scheme.
Speaking of the FSB, it was very active at the Labour party's Scottish
conference in Inverness yesterday.
John McFall MP, a member of Labour's Scottish Office shadow team,
addressed a fringe meeting organised by the FSB in the Palace Hotel.
Mr McFall spelled out what he described as a Government onslaught on
young people, saying that those under the age of 20 are now #34 a week
worse off in real terms than they were in 1979, when the Conservatives
came to power.
He set out a series of measures a Labour government would introduce to
tackle the problem of unemployment among youth, including a university
of industry to upgrade the skills and qualifications of young people.

HOW you look on the investment trust industry probably depends on how
recently it was that you began to take an interest in it.
The traditional view of a trust is perhaps of a company with share
capital and some long-term borrowings picked up at favourable rates. It
is run by a group of professional gentlemen who carefully invest the
funds in a spread of companies and markets around the world.
The parson, the draper, the widow and so on could invest in them
content that all the necessary decisions about where and whether money
should be invested would be taken for them. They appealed to a
particular type of long-term investor.
Some very big -- and some not so big -- companies grew up on this
basis, and a lot are still successfully ploughing the same furrow, doing
a very useful job for loyal shareholders.
More recent advisors on the scene will have been more aware of the
series of new launches which have almost without exception been
specialist by nature. The majority specialised in a particular
geographic area but others concentrated on specific activities or had
ingenious capital structures. But they have almost certainly still been
largely bought by people who in some degree specialise in trusts.
A whole lot more changes are coming along, particularly in the ways in
which trusts are looked on, the ways in which they are used and who buys
them.
Along with taking his all-embracing annual look at the sector, Robin
Angus of NatWest Securities has been casting an eye back to 1980 (when
there was a net outflow of #45m from the sector) and on to 1994 (when
there was a net inflow of #8088m). His conclusion is that ''we must
learn new ways of thinking about trusts. Old assumptions are not only
useless but also misleading and harmful.''
Mr Angus, who looked back over the past 15 years in order to make
predictions about what will happen in the years up to the new millennium
(which he insists starts on January 1, 2001), says the sector could
today ''scarcely be more different'' from 15 years ago, and ''in five
years time it will be different again''.
During the next five years the trusts will ''aggressively pursue'' the
retail market as well as seeking to appeal to a wider range of
institutional investors. The sector will ''come out of the closet, shed
its mystique and join the mainstream of the UK equity market''.
This should mean that the trusts will become ''a part of the range of
choices considered by all investors, not just trust aficionados''.
The choice will become ''fuzzy at the edges'' with investors tempted
to take a stake in, say, a specialised geographical area wanting to know
about offshore funds and other vehicles investing there and not just the
specialist UK-based investment trusts.
As specialisation proliferates even more, he predicts an increasing
polarisation between the ''all purpose'' generalists, which he says will
usually be large and well-established companies, and the sharply
focussed specialists.
With a handful of exceptions, which may include the biggest companies
in the sector, still growing perhaps through saving scheme issues and
still accounting for a fairly large percentage of the sector's market
capitalisation, he says that the day of the general trust is over.
''Trusts in the middle, especially those with a 'bias towards' this
that or the other will be squeezed out. Who wants or need them?''
Predicting that more investors will take an interest in the sector, he
says that the trusts ''are a natural for the retail market''. They can
offer, more readily than other collective investment vehicles, different
types of security tailored carefully to specific needs. ''This rather
than the much touted ability to gear (a red herring nowadays as it has
been for the last 20 or 30 years) is the real value of trusts' vaunted
plc structure in the world of today.''
In a fully institutional market, he says the trusts are also becoming
increasingly valuable. ''They combine the clear focus and strategic
value of derivatives with the familiarity and security of real assets.
And the purer they become as regards their investment policy the more
they become the thinking and/or cautious investor's derivatives or, as
they might with some truth be described, real asset-backed
derivatives.''
Summing up the value of investment trusts in a general UK portfolio,
he says: ''You want quick and easily got at exposure to smaller
companies with a chance of a double-whammy from a narrowing discount?
Well, there are plenty of such trusts there waiting for you.
''You're a bull of Japan or Latin America or the emerging markets of
the Far East? Well, you can spend forever pouring over the sales and
profit breakdowns in the accounts of big UK exporters or you can go
straight for it in a pure and maybe discount-geared way by buying the
shares of an appropriate specialist.''
The tunes which investors can play on this theme are many and varied.
But as Mr Angus makes clear, investors more and more need to understand
the difference between the big general (traditional) trusts and the
multiplicity of new more specifically focussed ones.
They also need to realise that many specialists should be looked at
more as managed funds than investment trust companies. They see their
job as picking the best shares for investing in their particular area,
but are likely to prefer remaining in it rather than going liquid and
certainly not switching to another area altogether.
This is of more than academic interest. It means that the investor has
to play a much more active part if he buys specialists trusts than in
theory -- sometimes in practice too -- he need have done if he had
bought a general trust.
If he is in emerging markets, for example, and thinks they are going
sour, he can switch to cash, to a general trust or whichever
specialisation looks a runner in the right direction. Just one small
snag remains: he needs to be right.

WITH less than a month to go until the end of the tax year, now is a
good time to spring clean your investments. For many Scots an exercise
in dusting down their finances and cleaning out the cobwebs seems to be
long overdue if they want to save tax.
According to figures released this week by IFA Promotions, the
organisation which represents independent financial advisers, more than
2.7 million Scots last year wasted a total of #392m by paying too much
tax.
Andrew Robertson, IFA Promotions' regional officer for Scotland,
comments: ''Many Scots will be richer simply by arranging their finances
better and by avoiding paying unnecessary tax. In many cases, spending a
little time with an independent financial adviser could really pay
dividends.''
IFA Promotions' investigation, undertaken by financial analyst Mintel,
was based partly on Inland Revenue statistics and partly on survey work.
Mintel claims it has calculated the ''wasted tax'' figures on a
conservative basis and, if anything, has under-estimated the actual
waste.
The investigation highlights five main areas of waste in Scotland:
* Up to #93m is wasted by Scots with long-term bank and building
society savings not holding Tessas and non-taxpayers who don't register
to receive interest gross on their savings.
Tessas are savings plans offered by banks and building societies on
which interest is paid free of tax providing the capital is left
untouched for five years. Some institutions will accept investments as
low as #1. The maximum annual deposits are #3000 in the first year and
#1800 per annum for the next four years up to a maximum of #9000.
It is particularly ironic that Scots should have neglected this
opportunity as one of the best Tessas to date has been provided by the
Dunfermline Building Society. Others currently offering competitive
rates are Barclays, TSB, N&amp;P and Halifax.
Non-taxpayers should go to their bank or building society and ask for
form R85 to register for gross interest. Children, the unemployed,
married women who are not working and the retired are groups who could
benefit. Some taxpayers, whose income falls within the 20% tax band, are
also paying too much tax on their bank or building society interest
because tax is deducted at 25%. If your annual income is less than
around #6500, you can claim this extra tax back.
* Up to #90m is wasted simply by misuse of tax-free personal
allowances.
Every man, woman and child has a personal allowance of at least #3445.
If you are over 65 your allowance is normally higher. Any income which
falls below this threshold is tax-free. Many married couples are still
failing to take full advantage of their allowances.
This usually occurs where one partner is working and the other is not,
or where one receives a private pension and the other does not. By
transferring joint savings from the partner who is paying tax to the one
who is not, tax of 25% or more could be saved.
* Up to #51m is wasted by holders of unit trusts and shares, mainly by
not making use of personal equity plans.
Everyone aged 18 and over can put up to #9000 into a PEP each year,
#6000 into a general PEP, which can be invested in unit trusts,
investment trusts or a portfolio of shares, and #3000 into a single
company PEP. While unit trusts can normally be held at no extra cost
within a PEP, investors should be more careful with investment trusts
and shares that any tax savings they make are not outweighed by the
extra charge for the PEP.
One of the cheapest PEPs for those who want to hold investment trusts
and shares is the Alliance Trust PEP. This is offered by an off-shoot of
the Dundee-based Alliance Investment Trust. There is no annual fee for
this PEP and dealing charges are low, but you must invest at least #750
per year in either Alliance or Second Alliance. Otherwise, you have a
free choice of over 80 other investment trusts and the top 350 shares.
* Up to #41m is wasted in company bonuses which are not paid through a
registered profit-related pay scheme.
You wil have to have a word with your employer if you think this type
of scheme would be to the advantage of you and your fellow employees. It
means that part of your earnings will fluctuate in line with your
employer's profits. These earnings are tax free up to a limit of either
one-fifth of your total pay or #4000 which ever is lower.
* Up to #30m is wasted in inheritance tax paid because Scots do not
plan ahead.
Inheritance tax starts to bite when your estate exceeds #150,000, any
excess being taxed at 40%. Tax may be avoided or reduced by giving some
money away before death. For instance, you can give away #3000 each year
free of tax. Married couples can also save tax by splitting their estate
and each leaving part to their children on their deaths. So if your
estate is worth say #160,000, if each partner arranges to leave #80,000,
there would be no tax to pay and #4000 less would go to the Inland
Revenue.
If you want the advice of an independent financial adviser, you can
call IFA Promotions' consumer hotline on 0117 971 1177 and you will be
sent details of three IFAs near your home or work who can help you. You
will also be sent a free guide to saving tax.

A CHILD OF AIR
Alan Clews
Headline Review, #16.99
THERE'S a wonderful image at the heart of this novel. It appears on
the opening pages and recurs throughout the text, strengthening its
impact every time, compounding its mystery with the injustice that
caused it.
The narrator tells us: ''The only remotely unusual feature of life in
Millarston was the woman with the bell''. But the truly unusual features
were the circumstances that caused Nancy Renwick to ring her bell and
the reasons why she had to endure such a public, daily humiliation.
Millarston remains as ever it was, an actual place rather than a
fictional location -- ''a village about 20 miles to the south-west of
Glasgow''. And though Alan Clews has mined a familiar Scottish fictional
seam, the device of placing the narrative in an actual location gives
the text a surprising immediacy that enhances the focus on an
oppressive, small-town parent and a dour religion, all viewed,
initially, through the eyes of a visiting child.
Every evening at 5 o'clock, Nancy Renwick walked round the garden of
her half-ruined house to the same slow rhythm for perhaps half an hour.
Initially we see her as a figure of mystery and terror. The village
children built stories around her, largely because they were told to
stay away from the house. They believed she could kill people by
looking, that she could fly, had magic powers, and could jump great
distances.
The picture softens as the story continues, and though we never have
to face her pliant acceptance, she nevertheless personifies her father's
dictum that one must suffer for what is right, and the more you suffer
the more right you must be.
Alan Clews has a wonderful way of describing inanimate objects, of
using them to impart a suggestion of their owners, before turning them
into a metaphor of the person themselves.
First, there is the brass bell, the kind a teacher might use, with a
wooden handle. Although he heard it only as a child, it sounds through
the narrator's adult imagination, and he even thinks he hears it while
lost in the mist.
Nancy Renwick's brother, James, packed his Bible into a creased and
cracked, patched leather satchel. One of the buckles was lost, the other
held by a thin leather remnant. And there is the battered suitcase Grace
Johnson carries up the hill when she arrives at Renwick House. She is
the thread, James's nemesis and maybe Nancy's salvation, because of her
incarceration; for Nancy's father condemned her to ring the bell because
she disobeyed, rather than shamed, him. Her child was removed at birth.
She never saw it, never knew if it was a boy or a girl.
James kept things as they were. He is a creation in the Robert
Wringhim mould, ready to join the list of repressed and anxious
two-faced men who have dominated Scottish fiction. His family have seen
better days. He is master of a crumbling fortune, a lay preacher who can
do nothing to stem the forces within him.
After driving from Millarston to Leith to preach to a diminishing
congregation, he stops in Glasgow on the road home to pick up an ageing,
shabby prostitute. He has also availed himself of the servant Grace
replaces and is tormented by her presence, rather than by his guilt.
This is Alan Clews's first novel. His previous work has been for
television, and he writes with a startling immediacy and visuality. His
narrative drive is compelling, and although the extremes of the story
and an occasional desire to obscure the narrative with his own opinions
eventually overtake him, he nevertheless makes a very welcome debut.

IT WAS in the dying embers of the Nazi inferno that Anne Frank
perished. Fifty years ago this month, as the Allies moved steadily
closer to final victory, the young Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp.
The only reason this Jewish girl stands out from the millions who
shared her fate is that the diary she had been keeping while in hiding
was missed by the Gestapo when they broke into her ''Secret Annexe'' on
August 4, 1944.
The war was grinding to a halt: ''Wishing will make it so'' encouraged
one of the British songs of the time, and for the people in this country
at least, it seemed that it would. Sadly, the dream didn't come true in
time for Anne and her family and friends, no strangers to hope-filled
dreams.
The Nazis arrested the eight people they found there, but overlooked a
small notebook which remained hidden under a pile of old newspapers.
Afterwards, a cleaner found it and gave it to two of the women who had
helped the group to survive the two years that they had spent hidden in
the rooms above an office in Amsterdam.
The notebook was Anne's diary, one of the most honest documents ever
written, and it was to make her name famous all over the world.
In it, Anne had diligently recorded the tensions and fears of life in
secret. She doubted whether anyone would ever be interested in ''the
unbosomings of a 13-year-old schoolgirl''. Yet from total obscurity she
has become the personal face of the Holocaust for many of us who have no
friends or family among those who died.
Through her writing, she takes us by the hand and leads us back to
simplicity. Gradually she shakes off the dew of childhood and is
transformed into a fragile girl trembling on the edge of womanhood. As
she mellows in the mysterious spring of adolescence, we cannot resist
loving her.
We see her begin to look around as the first strange stirrings of
longing come upon her. Her aching heart begins to face up to the great
quest of all humanity -- finding somebody to love. She finds her
somebody; Peter, the son of the Van Daans who have been sharing the
hideaway with Anne's parents, her sister Margot and Dussel, an older
friend.
Her love could also stretch beyond the narrow confines of her home:
''It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals because they
seem so absurd and impossible to carry out,'' she wrote, just days
before her hiding-place was discovered. ''Yet, I keep them, because in
spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at
heart.''
It was this belief that shaped her prophetic perspective of a world
gone mad. In over two years she never once set foot outside. This
restriction tortured her as she slowly fell in love with what nature she
could see through the tiny cracks in the heavy curtains that hung over
every window, shielding her from hostile attention.
She also saw the evil gathering, hemming her in. She identified
injustice and denounced it, but she refused to hate: ''I see the world
gradually being turned into a wilderness, I hear the ever-approaching
thunder, which will destroy us too, I can feel the sufferings of
millions and yet, if I look up into the heavens, I think it will all
come right, that this cruelty too will end, and that peace and
tranquillity will return soon.'' Her incarceration forced her to look
within, and there Anne Frank found freedom where it seemed to be denied.
She glimpsed the part of her that was beyond the reach of any government
or army, that which can only be imprisoned by ourselves.
In her short life Anne faced many of the truths that we, with all the
distractions at our disposal, can avoid. She recognised, and had begun
to accept, the fact of her essential aloneness -- even in a house of
eight people. She knew that she still had far to go, still so much to
learn. But her life's journey began to grind to a halt the moment she
was captured.
Yet in spite of this, and her many tears, hers was still a happy life.
The phrase in the title of this article was written by her in May 1944
-- it had been almost two years since she first took on the life of the
fugitive from the state. Hers was a contentment made all the more
startling by the misery that surrounded her.
A clear eye allowed Anne to bring the best of human nature to bear on
the harsh realities of the present. Though she suffered, she looked her
situation in the eye and said that things are never so bad that you
can't love, be joyful, be free.
And then she stops. Of course, there is no account of the raid. It is
as if she ran out of paper or had just moved on to a new notebook. But
you won't find any more books written by Anne Frank in the library.
Nothing else remains.
We are left to imagine the horror of discovery, the screams and
beatings, the shock of separation from family and friends, the long
train journey packed into crates, the final, lonely death, starving in a
concentration camp.
How do human beings come to the conclusion that exterminating someone
like her is the best alternative on offer? When they had decided, did
they ever doubt they were right? I don't know.
Anne still speaks to our world, arranged as it is around the frantic
attempts to consummate the inner longing she was so familiar with. Her
diary has continued to be read down the years because, amid the worst
storm to hit mankind this century, her vision of the beauty of life
remained miraculously undistorted.
And so Anne Frank fades away. Just another one of the many, a face
lost in a sea of six million, too vast to comprehend. But it is the
vastness of that sea that makes her so important.
Fifty years ago Anne turned her face to the wall and died after
watching her sister die first. The exact date of Anne's death is not
known. She was dumped into a mass grave like a piece of rubbish. Her
bones are now dust in the grey earth near Bergen-Belsen.
Would she have cared if she had known then that back in Amsterdam,
bearing the imprint of a soldier's boot-sole, her yellowing paper was
trembling in the first winds to blow through those upper rooms for two
long years? Anne wanted to be a journalist. That her slight volume had
somehow survived in the wreckage would have pleased her. It is just a
flimsy scrap of flotsam, but it offers its faint scent to the passing
world.
Let us never forget.

MOVES to crack down on excessive boardroom perks now seem more likely
following widespread outrage over the huge salaries and share option
packages for top bosses of newly privatised industries.
But while curbs on boardroom greed will be welcomed by many, millions
of ordinary workers are hoping the Government leaves their chance for a
share stake in the firm they work for well alone.
Share option schemes, like company cars, are viewed with some
irritation by perk-less employees. But although changes in the tax
system have drastically reduced the value of a company car in recent
years, share option schemes can still bring bumper bonuses for those
lucky enough to take part in them.
Recent revelations that top executives of the now privatised gas and
electricity companies stand to make millions of pounds from share option
schemes appear to have spurred the Government into action.
It has been reported that directors given share options worth more
than #50,000 should have to pay income tax on the value at a higher rate
of tax. Under the current rules they may pay capital gains tax, but only
if they sell their shares for a large profit.
Share options are supposed to give employees the incentive to work
hard and remain loyal to their company. The idea is that if everyone
pulls together to make the company profitable the share price rises and
employees and bosses alike are rewarded for their efforts as the value
of their options increases.
It is difficult though to assess just how much of a link there is
between employee effort and availability of share perks -- and to decide
on the right level of reward.
It is certainly hard to see why executives of newly privatised
industries should stand to gain millions just because the way their
company is owned has changed.
While special types of share option schemes exist for those in the
boardroom, one of the most popular ways of rewarding all employees is
through the Sharesave scheme run in conjunction with banks and building
societies. Here employees can choose to save between #10 and #250 a
month in a special tax-free savings contract for five years. The Halifax
alone has more than #1000m in this type of savings scheme.
At the end of the term employees have the right to buy shares in their
company at a price fixed at the time they started saving, typically at
around 20% below the market price at that time.
If the company's share price has risen over the five years then
employees stand to make a valuable profit on their investment. Under
current rules there is no tax to pay when employees take up their
shares, but there could be capital gains tax due if the shares are sold
and the gain exceeds the current CGT exemption of #5800.
If the price has fallen employees are not obliged to buy the shares,
but can simply take out the matured value of their savings -- and that
would still mean a tax-free return worth just over 5.5% a year during
the five-year term.
Like thousands of other employers, brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle has
been offering a Sharesave scheme to employees for several years. Now it
is trying to find out more about how its employees view the scheme
through a questionnaire which has just been distributed.
''The uptake is not as high as we would like,'' says Sandra Brodie at
S&amp;N. ''The schemes are popular among older employees who see them as an
extra way of saving for retirement, but perhaps younger employees take
the view that they may not be with us for five years and don't bother to
start saving.''
S&amp;N finds that, of employees who complete the five-year term, around
two thirds take up the shares rather than selling immediately for
profit. Through the most recent scheme, which matured at the beginning
of this month, S&amp;N employees had the chance to buy shares at the option
price of #2.50 even though the market price had doubled over the five
years to #5.
Other schemes report that, in the past, many employees simply turned
their shares into a quick cash profit when the time came to take up
their options, but growth in the value of this type of saving may
encourage longer term shareholding in the future.
Anyone saving the maximum #250 through Sharesave schemes could have
more than #17,000 to put into its company's shares at the end of the
five-year term and, with that level of investment, capital gains tax
could easily become a problem if the share price has shown a substantial
rise.
One way to shelter at least part of the gain is to transfer some of
the shares directly into a single company personal equity plan. These
are often promoted by firms with Sharesave schemes and run by large
firms of PEP managers, including the Bank of Scotland which administers
the S&amp;N single company PEP.
The good news is that transfers like this are cheap and easy -- you
don't have to sell the shares first before repurchasing as you do with a
general or corporate PEP, incurring stockbrokers' costs and price
fluctuations in the process.
The bad news is that only #3000 can be sheltered in a single company
PEP, half the allowance for a general one. Once the shares are invested
in a PEP they can be sold at some stage in the future without any
liability for capital gains tax and, of course, dividend income is also
free of tax.

* Can you please explain why I do not receive the income tax age
allowance? I am a single person aged 71 and my income is made up of the
state pension and a company pension which together come to #11,500 per
annum. In addition to this I receive bank and building society interest
on my savings of around #3500 a year. All of my income with the
exception of the state pension is taxed at source.
* The likely reason is that the figure of investment income you have
quoted is the net amount received after deduction of basic rate tax. The
age allowance income limit, however, relates to gross income for tax
purposes, and when your bank and building society interest is grossed to
include the tax deducted it amounts to #4666. This added to your
pensions brings your total income to #16,166 which is #1966 in excess of
the age allowance income limit for the current tax year, too much even
for the marginal age allowance.
The income limit has been increased to #14,600 for the year 1995/96 so
if your gross income remains around the same level you may be entitled
to marginal age relief next year. The income level at which the age
allowances cease to be effective in 1995/96 is #16,810 for a person aged
between 65 and 74.
* I would like your advice on behalf of an elderly friend, a lady of
about 80. As well as the state pension and some income from the family
retail business her main spending money has been from gilts. These have
now matured and the interest from the capital on deposit is much less.
Would the purchase of an annuity be a good idea? The sum available is
about #30,000.
* The return on an annuity for a woman aged 80 would be very
attractive, but the concept involves surrender of capital. This is often
not acceptable, especially if there are beneficiaries to be considered.
But if your friend is not bothered by this, you would need to ensure
that the best independent professional advice was obtained. Annuity
rates can vary widely.
There is, of course, nothing to prevent her from reinvesting the
#30,000 in a fresh portfolio of gilts. Returns of around 8.5% can be
obtained without purchasing high-coupon stock above par value. Again,
this is a very specialist market and the advice of stockbroker is
essential. Your perception that deposit rates are lower than the return
on gilts is correct.

* In March 1990 I invested #4800 in a PEP with a Scottish life office.
Initially it did moderately well, but its value now is only #5020. Would
you advise holding or selling? What might be a better investment for my
money?
* Between March 1, 1990 and February 28 this year the FTSE-100 share
index rose by nearly 35%. Clearly your PEP, which is sporting a gain of
just 4.6%, has failed you.
You would be better off spreading the proceeds around two or three
investment trusts, such as Alliance Trust in Dundee, Baillie Gifford's
Scottish Mortgage and Martin Currie's Scottish Eastern, both in
Edinburgh, or Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust in London. All have
low-cost savings schemes and PEP facilities, details of which can be
obtained from the managers.
You could also consider transferring your PEP to other managers, but
this might be more difficult for you to accomplish. Unless it is
important to you to utilise your PEP entitlements each year, it may not
be worthwhile considering.
PEPs have useful tax advantages, but you should never lose sight of
the need to pick an investment that will serve you well in the long run.
* I've recently resolved a two-year dispute with one of my personal
pension providers, a leading Scottish life office. It ignored repeated
requests from my accountant, the broker and myself for accurate details
of contributions I'd made to pension plans in the early years of the
policies. I am 49 years of age.
Only yet another letter to the group chief executive, but with a copy
sent to the regulator, brought a rapid satisfactory response. Will the
society bear a grudge in years to come and trim the discretionary bonus
element because I advised the regulator of its slack administration?
* Some life offices did experience administration difficulties
following the very rapid growth of business in the early eighties, but
you have clearly found the right route to follow should you have any
further problems in future.
Bonuses are calculated mathematically and expressed as a percentage of
sum assured and a percentage of bonuses already declared. They apply to
all with-profits policies which qualify for them and your policy will
not be treated any differently. The society exercises its discretion
over bonus rates not over who should receive them.

THE simplest way of providing pensions for individuals is a personal
pension. It is specificially aimed at people who are not in company
pension schemes or who are self-employed as sole traders or in
partnerships.
''There is nothing mysterious about this type of pension,'' said Les
Shields, managing director of Shields Financial Services. ''You
basically build up the largest possible pot of cash between now and when
you decide to switch on your pension which can be anywhere between age
50 and 75 -- and you do not even have to retire to switch it on.
''You are allowed to take 25% of the fund that you build up as
tax-free cash in your hand with a balance of the fund being used to buy
a pension in the open market-place.''
Depending on age, you can put between 17.5% and 40% of your net
relevant earnings into personal pension plans and the premiums are full
tax deductible at the highest rate of tax.
''The importance of the tax year end of April 5 becomes more apparent
if you decide to use what are known as Carry Forward and Carry Back
provisions,'' said Shields.
These are quite complex but, put simply, properly advised you can use
your pensions contributions allowance from previous years.
''If you were a higher rate tax payer in the year 1993-94 you can
elect to have the premiums paid between now and April 5 set against your
earnings for the tax year 1993-94,'' said Shields.
''You have until July 5 to decide which year the premium payments have
to be set against.''
This provision is especially valuable if, having been a 40% tax payer
in the previous year, you are now a 25% tax payer. In other words, it is
a way of maximising your tax relief.
''If you have unused tax relief as far back as 1987-88, under certain
circumstances you can mop up these allowances before April 5,'' said
Shields. ''If you wait until after April 5 then you can only mop from
the tax year 1988-89.''
FINANCIAL DIARY

TIME is running out if you have not used up your PEP allowance for
1994-95. PEP providers often offer discounts on initial charges as an
incentive to attract investors before the year end but a PEP should be
viewed as a long-term investment.
''A personal equity plan offers access to professionally-managed
investment in the UK and overseas stock markets,'' said Tim Purdon,
associate director of Gibson &amp; Partners. ''All income and capital gains
accumulated within the investment are free from taxation.
''Anyone over 18 and resident in the UK for tax purposes may invest up
to #6000 in a general PEP in the current tax year. A husband and wife
may each have one general PEP in every tax year up to the maximum
amount.''
The majority of people with personal equity plans use them to buy
units in a unit trust. These investments are spread across a range of
shares, reducing the volatility and are therefore regarded as less risky
than individual shares.
''Fund managers can now invest in any combination of UK ordinary
shares and qualifying unit trusts and investment trusts,'' said Purdon.
''It is therefore possible to invest all of the #6000 into UK unit
trusts.''
For a unit trust to qualify for a PEP, at least half of it must be
invested in the shares of British or European Union companies.
You can also put up to #1500 of the #6000 annual maximum in a PEP in
non-qualifying markets, so you also have access to potentially higher
risk, higher reward markets. Of course, the value of all equity-based
investments can go down as well as up.
''In addition, an investment of up to #3000 can also be made into a
Single Company PEP, that is, into the shares of a single UK or EU
company,'' said Purdon.
With the wide range of PEPs now on the market, sound advice is
essential to make the right choice. ''There are a variety of PEPs
available linked to unit trusts and investment trusts,'' he said.
''The independent financial adviser's job is to select the investment
vehicle most appropriate to the client requirements. Charges vary and
the IFA can select and negotiate charges to his client's advantage.''
He is a firm believer in making PEP investments early: ''Rather than
rush at the end of the tax year to effect PEP, this should be done at
the start of year to benefit from the full year's tax-free income and
capital growth.''
However, if you have not already taken out a PEP this financial year,
you have the opportunity in the next month to make a whopping tax-free
investment: with #6000 in a general PEP and another #3000 in a Single
Company PEP for the current and next financial year.
''Between now and April 6,'' said Purdon, ''a married couple who have
not used this year's allowance could set aside #36,000 in a tax-free
environment.''

* I am self-employed and have a young family living on a modest
income. My assets are: the ground upon which my business is based, worth
possibly #80,000 with planning permission for four to six houses, my
current house worth #70,000 owned without a mortgage, and further ground
worth #40,000 on which we propose to build a new home.
We would like to move from our present home to the proposed new house,
anticipated cost #40,000, and would be most obliged if you would advise
on how we should finance this move. We would prefer not to rent and are
thinking in terms of some sort of short-term loan arrangement.
* The best solution would be to find a buyer for your existing house
who would be prepared to wait until the new house is ready, in exchange
for a reduction in the price.
The second best would be to arrange an overdraft secured on your
present house. Then you would only need to draw the funds as the house
is being built. However, your self-employed status might make this
difficult. Any other short-term loan is likely to be very expensive.
You might like to consider a mortgage, bearing in mind that tax relief
would make it worthwhile to have a #30,000 mortgage anyway (though this
relief will be phased out in coming years). Again, being self-employed
might make this difficult. Another possibility would be to arrange
credit with the builder as part of the total cost of the construction
contract.
* As a person about to be made redundant I need a reliable source of
income for the future. I have about #55,000 in shares which have yielded
#2350 net but have performed badly in capital terms. I have a further
#110,000 on account. How much can I reasonably expect this sum to
provide consistent with safety/capital growth, and how much would an
independent financial intermediary charge?
I like the idea of index-linked gilts but do not understand their
operation. Is the yield index linked? How much would #100,000 of 2.5%
2024 yield gross?
* You should not assume you can get a yield of more than 5% gross and
maintain the value of the capital in real terms. Even this rate would
require some of the capital to be invested in shares, thereby implying
some risk. But a portfolio of equities and secure fixed-interest
investments could be constructed to give this sort of yield with a good
chance of preserving the capital and at low risk.
Most intermediaries are remunerated through commission received on
recommending specific investments and do not charge the client directly.
You would do better to go to a fee charging intermediary who would
rebate to you any commission which might be received. This would offset
part of his or her fee, the size of which would depend on how long was
devoted to your case but would anyway be several hundred pounds.
However, you would be assured of totally impartial advice.
The interest as well as the capital on index-linked stocks is indexed,
and the current running yield on the stock you mention is about 3.4%. If
you want almost total security of income and capital this is around the
highest yield you could receive.
* I shall shortly receive the national retirement pension, and with
this plus personal pensions and income from various investments I shall
have a reasonable monthly income.
I also have a considerable sum in three with-profits bonds bought in
1991 and 1992. I have taken no income from them as they constitute a
fund with which to move to a home in the country as soon as a suitable
one appears on the market. Recently I was startled to learn that such
bonds are subject to a market value adjustment (downwards) depending on
the immediate state of the market when they are cashed in.
Can you suggest an alternative home for the latter sum providing a
similar annual growth, at present 7% tax-free, and the possibility of
instant cashing in (or occasional income-drawing)? Or am I seeking an
unattainable dream investment?
* The market value adjustment (MVA) is made when the value of the
underlying investments in the life fund falls short of the bond price,
but it varies considerably from company to company. However, even after
allowing for this the bonds are still offering a reasonable return for a
low-risk investment.
In addition, it is probably true that MVAs will not become much
greater than they are now, and may become less, given that the next
major move in stock markets is likely to be upwards even if the timing
is impossible to predict. So there would be little point in cashing the
policies in now. Allowing for the MVA, your policies are probably
yielding under 7%. It is actually impossible to obtain 7% net of tax
with complete security and instant access.
* I am considering buying a second property for use as a
holiday/retirement home and should be grateful for any general advice
you can give on the various taxation implications. I am thinking here of
capital gains tax, income tax and council tax.
* An individual is only entitled to one main residence exemption for
capital gains tax purposes, and you may notify the Revenue within two
years after acquiring the second home which of the two is to be exempt
from capital gains tax. If you do not do this, the Revenue has the right
to decide.
Provided both houses have been your main residence at some time during
your ownership, the last three years of both in addition to actual
periods of residence will be exempt in calculating any chargeable gain.
Which house you elect will depend on the potential gain on sale.
For mortgage interest relief, it is a question of which house is your
main residence. This is also the case for council tax purposes and is
decided by the local authority. You will pay full council tax on the
home which is your main residence and 50% of the tax on the other
property. If, however, you decide to let the holiday home and make it
available for short-term letting for 140 days or more in a year it would
be liable to business rates rather than the council tax.
* My wife is to give birth to our second child later this month, and
our thoughts have turned towards the arrangement of a savings policy to
maximise a lump sum payment on our child's 21st birthday. Our intention
is to contribute #30 per month as we currently do for our first child
(born in June 1991). Which method of saving a monthly sum over 21 years
would you recommend for our second child?
Should we continue with the Standard Life endowment assurance policy
taken out for our first child, or cancel and convert to some other
savings plan? The policy commenced on November 1, 1991, is with profits,
and at February 1, 1994 had #626 of bonuses attached. The death payment
is not important to us although the Standard Life policy includes cover
for #7450.
* There is not a great deal of point in paying for life assurance that
you do not require. Investment returns from endowment policies are not
expected to be as good as they once were.
By contrast, investment trust savings schemes are ideal vehicles for
building up capital through long-term appreciation from small monthly
contributions. Transaction costs are low and the schemes are flexible.
You can increase (or reduce) your contribution, stop it altogether to
try something else, and dispose of the investment inexpensively at any
time.
Minimum monthly contributions are mainly around #30, though they range
from #20 to #75. You could choose from Baillie Gifford's Scottish
Mortgage and Martin Currie's Scottish Eastern, both Edinburgh, Murray
(Johnstone) International in Glasgow, or Foreign and Colonial Investment
Trust in London, or a host of others.
Insurance policy surrender values are poor, especially in the early
years, but if you decide to switch the contributions for your first
child, you could leave the policy paid up. Alternatively, you could
plough the surrender proceeds into your chosen investment.

CAPITAL Gains Tax is payable when you sell an asset if the amount of
money you make on the sale exceeds your annual allowance.
The relevance of considering the tax now is that the allowance is
annual. On April 6, you get a brand new Capital Gains Tax allowance for
the new financial year.
You can calculate your liability by taking the sum you paid for the
asset, indexing it in line with the retail price index, and deducting
that from the amount you received for selling it.
Then deduct any expenses connected with the purchase or sale and the
expense of any capital improvements, if appropriate. The cost of those
improvements can also be index-linked.
Now you deduct your annual Capital Gains Tax exemption, which is
currently #5800. If there is anything left, this is the amount you pay
tax on.
There are slightly different rules for assets owned before 1982 and
before 1965.
''The amount of tax you pay will depend on your other income for the
tax year,'' said Ailsa Brown, proprietor of Neilson Brown &amp; Co.
''However a few points should be remembered.
''There is no Capital Gains Tax on transfers between spouses, and a
married couple can both have personal annual CGT exemption.
''A married couple can double their allowance by splitting ownership
of the assets between them and both making use of their annual
exemption.''
Planning pays with Capital Gains Tax. You can use your annual
exemption to reduce your liability even if you do not want to sell the
asset, especially shares.
''Anyone who has accumulated a capital gain in excess of his or her
annual exemption should consider an arrangement known as 'bed and
breakfasting','' said Brown. ''By selling and buying back the investment
you create a capital gain.
''To make use of your annual exemption you should sell assets to
create a gain equal to your annual exemption, then buy back the
investment from the fund manager, for example.
''On buying back you restart the accumulation of gain from that date,
so deferring future capital gains tax problems for some time. Therefore
someone with a sizeable capital gain should each year sell some assets
to utilise his or her allowance.
''Most companies offer a bed and breakfasting service at a reduced
cost on the sale and repurchase of the asset. However they do vary so
you should consult your independent financial adviser to ascertain the
most appropriate investment to B &amp; B, saving you expenses on the
exercise.''

Sean Francis examines the cash benefits of making investments before
the end of this tax year
YOU would be wrong to wait for Easter to add to any nest eggs you have
-- for Easter falls on April 16 this year and the tax year ends on April
5.
Not only that, but some decisions have to be made before then, such as
taking out a personal equity plan to allow for the seven-day cooling-off
period.
An investigation by Mintel for IFA Promotion, which represents
independent financial advisers, revealed that Britons will pay more than
#5bn in unnecessary tax, mainly through inertia or lack of understanding
of the tax regime.
It estimated that three out of four adults are paying more tax than
they need to. Based partly on an analysis of Inland Revenue data, the
investigation revealed five areas responsible for the waste of more than
#500m each this year.
Up to #1.3bn is wasted by the 31m taxpayers with long-term bank and
building society savings who do not hold tax-free TESSA savings
accounts, and by the 6m non-taxpayers who have not registered to receive
their bank income gross.
Another #1 billion is wasted by the 1.9m people who do not use their
tax allowances properly, mainly married couples where only one person is
working.
Shareholders and unit trust investors will waste #735m by not taking
out PEPs, and #51m will be wasted through company bonuses not being paid
through a registered profit-related pay scheme.
Inheritance will cost people #720m more than it should because they
have not planned ahead for it.
''Think of the tax inspector as an authority bearing opportunities,''
said Tom White, a partner in Welsh &amp; White. ''I would not expect the
average investor or businessman to be knowledgable about the approaching
opportunities, though I am sure they are aware of them.
''The knowledge is provided by an independent financial adviser. He or
she knows the advantage of taking opportunities available at this time
of year and what type of 'egg' you should be looking for.''
Among the areas you should be looking at right now are:
Personal Equity Plans.
To take advantage of your annual allowance for 1994-95 your
application for a PEP must be received with payment by March 28 to take
account of the seven-day cooling off period.
Independent Taxation.
If you want to maximise the benefits in the coming tax year, division
of assets should be completed by April 5.
Pensions and AVCs
You are allowed to a certain percentage of your income into your
company or personal pension scheme, or into AVC (additional voluntary
contribution) schemes. Now is the time to take advantage of any unused
allowance.
Directors of companies with a year end of March 31 will have to make
contributions to their executive pension plans to obtain tax relief
against profits in the period to that date.
Capital Gains Tax.
If you are planning to sell any assets, consider doing so now to use
up your Capital Gains Tax allowance.
Income Protection Plans.
From April this year Invalidity Benefit and Sickness Benefit will be
replaced by Incapacity Benefit, which has stricter criteria for
claimants and in many cases lower payments. Income Protection Plans can
make up for loss of salary in the event of illness.

SAM HARE clearly knows a great deal less about Irish history than he
thinks (March 8).
The title King of Ireland was assumed by Henry VIII in 1541. From the
conquest in the twelfth century until that time the English kings had
styled themselves Lords of Ireland.
Ireland was forced into union with the other parts of the United
Kingdom by the Act of Union of 1800. Neither supported by the Catholics
nor by the Ascendancy politicians, this act was forced through the
College Green Parliament by the Chief Secretary of Ireland, Robert
Stewart (Viscount Castlereagh, later Marquess of Londonderry) who used
the methods tried, tested, and found effective at the time of the
Scottish Act of Union -- bribery and corruption.
It is strange to ponder that this Irish Act of Union was opposed by
John Foster, first Baron Oriel, who as Speaker of the Irish House of
Commons had opposed the Relief Bill of 1793 believing that the
concessions it contained to the Catholics presaged the overthrow of the
''Protestant Nation'', and that the Act of Union of 1800 was forced
through by Viscount Castlereagh who would resign the following year
because the king would refuse to grant a Catholic Relief Bill.
As for Northern Unionists, they are most certainly not descended from
my forebears, the Celts of the ancient Irish Kingdom of Ulster. If
anyone wants to have them, the Planters have first choice.
Sinn Fein was not formed during the First World War, nor was it formed
as a ''pressure group''. The uprising on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916,
was the work of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.
If Sam Hare considers the establishment of the Irish Free State in
1922 (as a consequence of a Government of Ireland Act, 1920, not of the
Treaty of 1922) as a victory for Sinn Fein then he is alone in that
belief: even Ian Paisley would not buy that one.

I HAVE read much of the work Dr Graham Walker has carried out over the
years. I believe it's interesting and in touch with reality, which makes
him unusual in terms of other academics. None the less, let's be honest
about him.
Regardless of his socialist credentials he has always been a Unionist
in relation to Northern Ireland. No matter how he dresses it up, his
striving to bring Scotland/Britain and Northern Ireland even closer in
political terms is part of a Unionist agenda (February 18).
Within the context of a colonised people, Ireland has been subjected
to the might of the British Empire in all its ideological and military
splendour. The greatest impact on the island has arisen because the
majority of the colonists who usurped Irish land and Irish ways in the
north of the country were the self-seeking plantation Scots.
Their involvement has served to provide the root cause of conflict and
hundreds of thousands of deaths over the centuries.
Maybe if they gave up their colonist mentality, recognised their
culpability in being usurpers, and lost the hate which arose from it,
they could find a way to live with the rest of the people on the island.
They could even maintain their Britishness in a new arrangement,
something which every other person in Ireland, from the Irish Government
to Sinn Fein, accepts as reality.
Graham Walker's sophisticated elaboration of the Loyalist cause, like
other Unionist argument, both accepts and endorses the colonisation and
conquest of Ireland and its people. No amount of academic respectability
can avoid that conclusion.

WOULDN'T it be nice, I thought to myself as I prepared to set off for
my destination in South-west France, to bump into Stephen Fry. There he
would be, at a corner table in my favourite restaurant in the small town
near which we usually stay, sitting alone of course, having given the
slip to the British media, his own family, to say nothing of a few
theatrefuls of people.
Like the Scarlet Pimpernel, they had sought him here, there, and
everywhere to no avail. Then came a fax to reassure those who feared for
his health or worse, his life, confirming that he was alive and well and
-- lost in France. What if I found him? What would I do? Since I admire
Fry and do not think he has done anything to be ashamed of, I would not
have rushed out to the nearest phone. What about a dose of the cheery
medicine which Stephen Fry administers to the rest of us when we are
world weary and turn on our televisions to smile at his manic
characters?
''Good evening, Mr Fry,'' I might begin in a teensy-weensy Jeeves and
Wooster sort of way. I trust that Sir has not been having difficulty in
extracting currency from the dispenser and has not had to encash the
medallion which he used to wear around his neck when accompanying his
friend Mostyn to the building society?
This approach would be unlikely to bring a chortle of recognition and
delight from Fry's features. When we laugh at the character at which Fry
excels, the man who is obsequious and overbearing at the same time, we
do so partly out of relief that we can sit at home, safe from his
intrusive attentions. Imagine escaping to France to have a wee breakdown
and then be confronted with an incarnation of your worst satire,
grinning and smirking ''nudge, nudge, wink, wink'' in a Monty Python
sort of way?
The truth is that I would have said nothing and allowed Fry to get on
with his dinner. Oh yes, I might have dined out myself on the story at a
later date, but by that time Stephen Fry would hopefully have recharged
his batteries and be making us all laugh again. My imaginary encounter
did not actually take place, but if Fry were looking for a place in
which his private life would not be picked over in public then the
village in which I am writing this is surely it.
The mayor is the leading GP who divides his time between his practice
and the town hall, the ultimate form of devolution in which the French
glory. (Each village of any significance has its own town hall which
deals with a large number of local government functions.) However, our
medical mayor has also been dividing his time between his wife and the
chic blonde who used to run the Tabac on the corner of the main street.
When I paid my last visit, her pilot husband was in the Far East and has
presumably now gone west. The point of telling you this is that the
situation has caused nary a ripple in the placid rural calm.
I once attended a fete in a neighbouring village to which the local
mayor brought his mistress and not his wife. It didn't seem to cause a
stir. My point is not to support such behaviour but that it occasions
much less fuss in France. In Britain we make much -- too much -- of the
private life of our public figures. It might be of some relevance if
there were a dissonance between the two -- for example, if the
Government minister promoting a particular line were to be at complete
variance with it in his or her personal life. That would leave them open
to a charge of hypocrisy and double standards -- which their political
opponents would make sure was levelled very quickly.
But there is another kind of double standard and hypocrisy. It is the
one which demands higher moral standards from public figures or
professional people and fails to demand anything of Joe Soap who lives
around the corner. Even if the people could be found of sufficient
probity to become leaders in such a society, it would be doomed to
collapse, eaten away from underneath by those who think that morals are
for other people, not for themselves.
I have no quarrel with those who ask for high personal standards from
their leaders or their doctor, lawyer or clergyman. But when they fail
to ask them of themselves, or fail to exercise mercy when these
individuals stumble or fall from grace, they exhibit the worst kind of
hypocrisy.
In Scotland we have a particular version of this hypocrisy which goes
under the label ''I kent his faither'', extending the self-righteous
damnation across generations. It is interesting to see that our very own
Scottish National Party has been keeping that tradition alive and well
by resuscitating the alleged sins of yesteryear of one of its
by-election candidates.
Of course it is all too easy to blame this kind of hypocrisy on the
media which digs the dirt. We forget that in our rural communities,
moral condemnation does not have to be set in print or video to have its
effect. Just imagine how long the medical mayor would last in the
Western Isles. Neither the French laissez-faire nor our own prurience is
without its weakness. Jesus had the balance right with his quiet
reminder not to cast the first stone, and to be careful that the speck
in our brother's eye was not rather smaller than the one in our own eye.
To end on a more cheerful note, I heard a true story recently about
two showbiz personalities who recently got lost on the way to an
Edinburgh theatre and then drove up a one-way street by mistake. The
motor-cycle cop who waved them down was stunned when the driver rolled
down the window offering profuse apologies. It was none other than Rikki
Fulton (alias Supercop, Rev I M Jolly et al) accompanying Jack Milroy to
a Francie &amp; Josie revival.
Instead of providing the tabloids with a splash by arresting them, the
policeman roared with laughter and sent them on their way. I hope if he
loses his way, Stephen Fry gets the same treatment from the gendarmes
(and the British public).

AS we thunder towards the new millennium, it becomes more and more
difficult to know whether we ought to be approaching this milestone in
human affairs in a mood of qualified optimism, or one of outright panic
and despair.
The programmes surrounding international Women's Day, on Wednesday,
strongly suggest the former; to listen, say, to the series of short
stories by women of the last turn-of-the-century broadcast on Radio
Scotland's Storyline -- or Monday's accompanying Postscript conversation
on ''The Female Imagination 1890-1915'', or Harriet Walter's memorable
Woman's Hour reading of George Gissing's superb and neglected novel of
late 20th century spinsterhood The Odd Women -- is to be reminded that
there is, after all, a lot to be said for an age in which women can work
for a living without being regarded as freaks, get pregnant in their
teens without being cast into outer darkness, and give birth without
facing a formidable risk of death.
To listen to Pat Kane's new Radio Scotland series Kane Over America,
on the other hand, is to receive far more mixed and alarming signals
about the future, particularly if we accept -- as we have had to do
throughout much of the present century -- that what happens in America
is likely to spread to Europe sooner or later. For according to the
first two of Kane's six programmes, broadcast on Wednesday evenings at
6.15, the most important things happening in America reflect an
ever-increasing pace of technological change.
His first programme, Metallic Necessity, looked at the electronic and
information revolution, and the fervour of some of its supporters --
and, on the other hand, a continuing obsession with personal weaponry,
guns and private self-defence which seems, in places like Riverside near
Los Angeles, to be driving apparently quiet suburban communities to the
verge of something that sounds, to European ears, like anarchy and
barbarism; one heat-packing female gun enthusiast told Kane, without a
trace of irony, that: ''A society where everyone has a gun on their hip
is suddenly a very polite society . . . ''
According to Kane and his interviewees, the link between these two
sets of attitudes is the American ideal of the frontier; cyberspace is
the ''new frontier'' now that the land is conquered, and it's the legacy
of the old frontier that creates an indelible link, in the American
mind, between citizenship and masculinity, the right to bear arms, and
the right to shoot dead anyone who gets in your face.
But what I liked about the first programme was the question put by
Neil Postman, New York's leading anti-technocrat, about any technical
innovation; ''What is the problem,'' he shrewdly and devastatingly asks,
''to which this device is the solution?'' What I disliked about the
second was Kane's failure -- at least in this edited version of what
sounds like a fascinating and comprehensive American journey -- to
challenge any of his contributors with the undoubted fact that societies
don't have to be like this; that men throughout most of Europe live out
their lives without ever using or touching a gun, and seem not much the
worse for it.
OVERALL, Kane's programme reminded me far too strongly for comfort of
the words of the old Marxist, Eric Hobsbawm, who appeared this week on
Sue Lawley's Desert Island Discs (Radio 4), and said that his fear, for
the new millennium, was that too many people, in too many places, were
becoming used to living in a way that his grandparents, in the age of
''progress,'' would have thought it unacceptable for any human beings to
live.
One wonders, of course, what the poor servant-girls of Hobsbawm's
grandparents' time would have said about that. But listening to the
paranoid, gun-toting suburbanites of Riverside, hopelessly caught
between the American frontier tradition and the criminal drug culture of
L.A., and the blatant profiteering of a modern weapons-and-security
industry, that thrives on paranoia and incivility, you could see exactly
what he meant.

WITH or without Cindy Crawford -- the divorce is set for later this
month -- Hollywood's biggest Buddhist booster Richard Gere has agreed to
star in the thriller Primal Fear for Paramount Pictures. It's a long
time since An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) and Pretty Woman was
worrying fluff which established Julia Roberts and by chance reminded
moviegoers that Gere was still alive. Wooden but breathing.
The word is that Gere is about to have a fortysomething revival,
playing a lawyer who defends a homeless man falsely accused of murder in
his latest film. It will be a pleasant surprise. Cher, we recall, had
the same role in Suspect (1987) with rather unknown Liam Neeson as the
big man in the dock. The producers of Primal Fear are saying they are
looking for a new face to play their innocent vagrant. Well, it's all
about roundabouts . . .
Cindy Crawford will make her film debut this year in producer Joel
Silver's Fair Game. She also appears as an attorney. Silver, the
bearded, brusque, brilliant detector of mass taste -- Die Hard and
anything else with explosions and missionary sex -- believes Crawford
will ''have great chemistry'' with co-star Billy Baldwin. One can only
hope the formula is better than Mr Baldwin's ''chemistry'' with Sharon
Stone in the sad Sliver. That one needed a bunsen burner to heat things
up.
Goodbye Jackie Collins? Fiona Lewis, formerly a model and actress and
another Brit in Hollywood, is about to reveal more. She posed nude for
Helmut Newton, appeared in Roman Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers
and in Brian De Palma's The Fury and Ken Russell's Lisztomania. We've
seen much of her but her first novel, Between Men gets beneath the soul
and the sheets.
British director Mike Figgis didn't make friends in Las Vegas. The
guide of Stormy Monday and Internal Affair has completed Leaving Las
Vegas (which stars Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue) and that's just what
he had to do to film scenes about death and prostitutes in the gambling
town.
''The city took exception to the script,'' he says. ''It seems that,
in the new family-friendly environment, there are no prostitutes or
alcoholics in the casinos. So we had to move out of town to shoot.''
Meg Ryan will be seen in four movies this year is expected to ''do a
Hugh Grant'' in French Kiss. PolyGram -- three-quarters owned by the
Dutch company Phillips -- which profited hugely from Four Weddings and a
Funeral has similar expectations for the movie which also stars the
always inventive Kevin Kline.
Hollywood may not want Helen Mirren for the movie-movie of the
original Prime Suspect -- ''She's Out,'' as Lynda La Plante would write
-- but the actress is set to reprise her role as DCI Tennison in several
more TV dramas.
Ted ''Cheers'' Danson is to be the big guy in the television
mini-series Gulliver's Travels and this week's lucky multi-million
dollar Elizabeth Hurley, the new Estee Lauder cosmetics contract player,
is typecast as the big girl.
Clive Anderson, who is at present Our Man In... on the BBC, has
explained all his problems: ''Although I was born in Middlesex, I've
always regarded myself as Scottish because my father came from Glasgow.
I identify with the dourness of the Scottish character.'' Middlesex?
Just push a button and you can switch off the awful little man.
Scoop du jour: Brian ''Kato'' Kaelin, friend, houseguest and possible
alibi witness for O J Simpson is to star in an interesting, if
low-budget, film. In exploitative casting he will play the chauffeur for
a Beverly Hills couple in The 16th Minute. When the husband is murdered
in the movie, the wife is charged with the killing. Kaelin's character
is the only person who can alibi her whereabouts at the time of her
husband's death. It seems just the victim's gender has been changed.
Like the O J trial, FM Entertainment Films are hoping this one will run
and run.

EVEN as a teenager, actress Blythe Duff possessed the same
single-minded ''110% determination'' as her on-screen Taggart character,
Detective Sergeant Jackie Reid.
Growing up in East Kilbride in a sports-orientated school -- Ally
McCoist was a classmate -- she resisted the pressures to play volleyball
and netball. With her sights firmly trained on the stage, she was an
enthusiastic member of the school's theatre club, with regular outings
to Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre.
She still thrills to the memory of those trips. ''I just loved it --
going to the Citz to be shocked. I remember one production where an
actress walked across the stage in a see-through dress and I just gulped
and thought: Oh my God, that's what you have to do to be an actress.
That's obviously par for the course.''
In her own career she's been more famed for donning a uniform --
Jackie made her debut in 1990 as a WPC -- than stripping off her kit,
but she's about to tread the hallowed boards of the Citizens', as part
of the ensemble cast of Swing Hammer Swing!, adapted by the Citizens'
artistic director Giles Havergal from the award-winning novel by Jeff
Torrington.
Duff plays various roles in the play, set in the Gorbals in the 1960s,
about the colourful life of aspiring writer Tom Clay. ''I play his wife,
his sister-in-law and the woman who runs the fag shop.''
The diverse roles offer Duff the opportunity to break out of her
Jackie Reid mould and showcase her dramatic range. ''It's literally a
case of changing shirts and a bit of hat-acting, although Giles told us:
'If you feel the need to wear a hat then that's fine, but try not to.
I'd rather you find the character from within than from a hat.'''
Her excitement at working with Havergal is evident: while Taggart has
given her a recognised on-the-street profile she says she feels
privileged to work at the Citizens'. ''I always felt that it was, if not
exactly unobtainable, a bit outwith my reach,'' she says. ''It has such
a world-wide reputation.
''I have a break from Taggart until May and was just enjoying relaxing
when Giles phoned out of the blue about Swing Hammer Swing! and said: 'I
don't know if you'll be interested in this . . . ' and I was like: 'You
didn't think I'd be interested?' and he said: 'Well, I don't know if
it's your cup of tea.' and I thought: Oh, go and have a chat to yourself
Giles.''
She accepted immediately and laughed at friends who ticked her off and
advised she should have insisted on seeing a script first. ''I just
groaned: 'You don't understand, don't take this away from me, I feel
really privileged.' I was told I should have seen a script on principle
and I thought: No, no, that's when you lose out on the excitement of
this business -- when you start to say, hmm, well, I'll speak to my
agent and get back to you.''
The attitude is typical of her forthright manner and the telling of
the story is characteristic of her conversation; Jackie Reid might be
the model of a calm, collected career woman, but Duff is very vivacious,
all sparkling eyes, animated action and endless entertaining lapses into
reported speech which involved wickedly accurate impersonations.
Before embarking on rehearsals for Swing Hammer Swing! she had been
using her break to gather herself together recovering from the trauma
from the death last year of Taggart star Mark McManus. His influence
will inevitably hang over the series' future and he is clearly still a
presence in Duff's life; our interview is shot through with unexpected,
affectionate references to him. She muses that it is comforting to speak
about him, to express a grieving process, albeit a very public one.
''I always knew that if anything ever happened to Mark it would be
difficult but I don't think I ever realised quite how difficult it would
be, I don't think any of us did,'' she says softly. ''I was so
encouraged by the public response to his death, although as James
(Macpherson, aka Detective Inspector Mike Jardine, her Taggart co-star)
said, it's a bloody shame he didn't get the recognition when he was
alive.''
She shrugs philosophically. ''Knowing Mark he probably wouldn't have
taken very kindly to it anyway, so as long as people respected him for
the star he was, that's fine.''
McManus's ill-health over the past few years triggered the increasing
character development of Jardine and Reid, and his death has pitched
them more firmly into the spotlight. Duff has invested the role of
Jackie with her own sardonic humour and she relishes the opportunities
for the development of Jackie's personal life, an aspect which, in
comparison with other female cops in shows like Prime Suspect, Between
the Lines and Cracker, has not been dwelt on.
''If the series is going to continue and thrive the writers have to
think about that and give us breathing time,'' she says. ''I actually
like Jackie, she cares about people but she's a tough cookie as well.
She has to be, she's in a man's world but she doesn't let that get her
down -- she always has a quick quip. In the beginning I was sometimes
just a foil for the 'huh, wummin polis' line which used to rile me but
she always got her own back. I'm quite a cheeky person myself and I try
to instal that in her.''
The character has grown significantly since her uniformed WPC days.
''It used to be just 'Jackie Reid knocks and enters' but I finally got
in, shut the door, sat down and got to be part of the conversation and
the investigation.''
While looking forward to the next series of Taggart, she's currently
totally focused on her Citizens' role. A stage actress for seven years
before her televisual break, working with TAG, Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh
and Scottish Opera, she revels in theatre work.
''Theatre is important to me to replenish, well, that sounds a bit
wanky, but to have some creativity,'' she explains. But admits her dream
role would be in period television drama. ''Like a Martin Chuzzlewit,''
she says. ''My look isn't particularly 90s. In fact, I don't think I've
ever been 90s, 80s or 70s. It used to be very difficult to cast me when
I was younger, because I was neither punky nor glamorous.''
She smiles self-effacingly and tells how when she was once asked to
appear as Snow White and told her friends she had to turn down the part
in the panto they assumed she had been offered the role of the witch.
She enacts her indignation hilariously: ''Eh, no, Snow White actually.''
Then she mockingly slaps her hand to her forehead and groans: ''Oh no,
I've given you your headline now -- Taggart Star Will Never Play Snow
White'' -- and she laughs at her openness, with just a touch of a
cackle.

JOHN Wallace, trumpeter extraordinaire, and his band of brass players
can always be relied upon to produce an entertaining show. In their
lunchtime concert yesterday at the Academy, they surpassed themselves.
A programme of Turkish Trumpetries (Wallace's term, not mine) expanded
to become a near-theatrical extravaganza incorporating a tribute to
Maurice Temple, the soon-to-retire head of brass at the RSAMD, and, in
John Wallace's words, ''the finest head of brass anywhere in the
world''. And, in inimitable Wallace fashion, having got the serious
tribute out of the way, the trumpeter proceed to send up Temple at every
opportunity.
In and around all the nonsense, which involved Maurice Temple being
led from the audience by Wallace Collection percussionist Kevin Hathway
to join in with the band, Hathway himself (finest percussionist in
Britain) cutting a Groucho Marx-style figure and leading the band with a
bell-adorned fez, the amazing bass trumpeter Simon Gunton doing a sword
dance with two posthorns, and Wallace himself as MC, there was the
music.
It's easy to be distracted (and entertained) by all the hi-jinks -- as
was the packed house, which contained every age from schoolkids (by the
busload) to senior citizens. But the effortless virtuosity of Wallace
and his unique band of brass players -- yesterday seven trumpeters
playing on every conceivable size and range of instrument -- informs
every note they played, from strident military marches, to fat, plummy
minuets, to the spectacular technical wizardry of their final Mozart
Rondo. An astonishing group, with their Fife-born leader in flying form.

HEALTH warning: Remove all loose items of clothing, coins, and
spectacles and beware of low-flying Doc Martens. You're in for a bumpy
ride.
My mate Sharon says Faith No More are Motorhead meets Rage Against The
Machine with a little bit of Leonard Cohen thrown in for light relief. I
say no comparison can be made. These guys are a one-off.
Faith No More are THE rock band of the past 10 years. All others can
go and hang their heads in shame. Recent reviews of the new album have
talked about a change of direction. Conclusion? The old anthems are the
best.
For the only band to sell out four consecutive nights at the
Barrowlands, The Garage was a very odd choice of venue. At first it
looked as though they had lost a good chunk of the atmosphere, being in
such a compact space, but they proved that whether you see them in a
stadium or in your front room, all that matters is that they're there.
Mike Patton's voice is arguably the best on the rock circuit. He can
scream, he can croon, and he can rap. His only fault is the dodgy 'tashe
he is sporting, which makes him look like something out of a bad
American 1970s porn B-movie.
Despite the mid-way insert of the Commodores' Easy -- which may be
construed as a slight loss of marbles during a non-stop heavy rock gig
-- there are no pretences here. No criticism either. Just complete Faith
No More.

FEAR of being found out is now one of the great motivations of modern
society. Witness the City slickers, staggering from the effects of being
used as a pinball machine by young chancers, pouncing on the shredding
machines while the barrow boys giggle in the wine bars over one of their
own trumping the old guard.
First, the old school ties were aflap with indignity when it became
known that a council house boy had brought a historic institution to its
knees, creaky as they are from disuse in the practice of bending them to
anyone save the great god Mammon. The fact that he was a schemey didn't
seem to matter when he was making them billions. Cheap point, let it
pass. But the sense that hysterical attempts were being made to avert
exposure of inadequacies within the institution was inescapable.
Now, this week, we have a minor might-have-been who quite clearly
won't be, for a while anyway, because of his adulterous liaison. Robert
Hughes would say that he resigned not just because of his firm personal
standards but in obedience to the recent ''get tough'' makeover which
involves erring Tories getting out before they are found out.
The problem is that the avoidance of embarrassment and the infliction
of it are largely indistinguishable. The symptoms in both cases are
hysterical front-page headlines and an increase in the impulse for
journalists to search for and expose sexual indiscretions.
When, last year, Hartley Booth upped the purity stakes by resigning
over his naughty thoughts, some synthetic outrage was mustered in the
newsrooms and happy chortles rent the air.
He introduced the Jimmy Carter Standard to Conservative politics.
While running for President, Mr Carter felt it necessary to confess to
Playboy that he had committed adultery many times in his heart. Stephen
Milligan's lonely and sordid death and Mr Booth's puny wee poetic
scandal took us from tragedy to farce in the space of a week.
THERE is a strong scene in the eighties television series A Very
British Coup in which the Prime Minister, after a sex scandal, asks his
Whip: ''What else is there I need to know?'' You may assume that John
Major has been making similar inquiries.
There is a legitimate complaint -- or observation -- about the
behaviour of the media in these recent cases. It has nothing to do with
the usual shrieks about invasion and invention. It is that there has
existed an unprecedented consensus news agenda between the tabloids and
the broadsheets, between newspapers and television news.
Top-spot coverage for Milligan's death can be justified because of the
early possibility of murder. But a nobody resigning over nothing jostles
more significant if less juicy events out of the main headlines. What
seems to have happened -- even at the austere and politically cowardly
BBC -- is that each successive resignation is seen as symbolic of a
rocked and rotten Government. It may be cathartic for Mr Major to blame
the press for what has happened. It misses the point though.
This week another misguided woman is trotted out for the humiliating
ritual of excusing her errant husband's infidelities and pretending that
all is now sweetness and light. Someone dealt her the joker in a game of
Happy Families.
The feeling of revulsion comes, partly, from a sense that sacrifices
are being offered up in order to appease an unhappy electorate and,
perhaps more pertinently, to avoid the rigours of examination turning up
more significant indiscretions.
Compare and contrast, as they say, the column inches devoted this week
to the resignation of an insignificant politician to those given to the
sleaze-busting committee set up to look at other non-sexual
indiscretions.
The Cabinet Secretary swallows a hook of his own making and admits he
''made a mistake'' in reporting on his investigation of Jonathan
Aitken's bill at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. It is a defining admission. He
was found out.
Fear of being found out leads to fear of being deceived. The more you
lay bait to throw the wolves off the scent, the more you hide, the more
the hunters pursue.

A BLOWN-UP print of a black and white Oscar Marzaroli pic of a Gorbals
tenement looms over a stage strewn with rubble, with the dunnies at the
front silted up by haphazard blizzards of mucky, newsprint snow. The
design by Kenny Miller is stylised monochrome but the production is a
blaze of colour, courtesy of the vibrant language of Jeff Torrington in
Giles Havergal's adaptation of his novel. Alastair Galbraith, in hippy
attire, is a languid, impossible-to-faze Tam Clay, cutting a bizarre
figure among the 50-plus members of the Gorbals community portrayed by
the other six members of the cast, who are decked out in decorous black.
A giant breeze-block descends from the sky symbolising the Palace
cinema, and in the very first scene, with Jonathon Watson staggering
around in a diving suit, Havergal successfuly captures the surreal
originality of Torrington's evocation of sixties Gorbals life. However,
the production, while amusing, at first lacks a convincing dramatic
identity. With the cast taking it in quickfire turn to voice Clay's
complex interior monologues it is in danger of seeming like an animated
reading, the sense of social essay exacerbated by the projection of key
images on the ''cinema screen''.
Such qualms were quickly dispersed as Havergal exercised a dramatic
ingenuity, merging abundant images in a seamless flow while paying
reverence to Torrington's poetic energy and exacting crisp and engaging
performances from the cast. Blythe Duff is slickly scathing, Katherine
Howden is deliciously gallus, Jonathon Watson makes an 'Allo 'Allo skit
of a Jean-Paul Satre aphorism, the rough-hewn features of Matthew
Costello are appropriately imposing, Sandy Welch is a stalwart
throughout, and Henry Ian Cusick's Jacob the parrot and Cyclops the cat
have to be seen to be screamed at.

WHAT a broad spectrum of experience is Mr Penney's -- local church
history, homiletics, soteriology, sociology, and physiognomy, and such
an effortless expertise in all of them (March 3).
One can only speculate by what miracle of grace he is able to separate
himself from his ''less-charitable colleagues'' and so refrain from
passing judgment on Jack Webster and the countless thousands of others
like him who occasionally worship as part of their spiritual life and
pilgrimage.
These folk retain a certain wonder and a great deal of goodwill for
the Kirk and its Master. My admiration for the breadth of Mr Penney's
knowledge is tempered by my fear that he has not yet discovered that
''the fear o' hell's a hangman's whip to keep the wretch in order''
(Burns's letter to a young friend, chapter 8 v:1).
May I also confess, as a more liberal minister, that I and many like
me are weary of those aggressive conservative evangelicals who act as
though they were our Lord's sole representative in their territory, had
a monopoly of truth about Him, and who clearly have little patience with
the doctrines of immanence or prevenient grace.

WE note with concern the imbalance in the article, No need yet for
disarmament, claims Spring (March 1).
Paramilitary groups are described as Protestant but no such religious
adjective is applied to the IRA in the same sentence. This indicates
bias in its most blatant form.
It is deeply offensive to adherents of the Reformed Faith to have
their Protestantism continually diminished by the media's insistence on
linking it with groups which have no official religious affiliation.
We trust you will take note of these points and refrain from the use
of the word Protestant in such pejorative terms.

IT has been brought to our notice that there is a public misconception
that the Glasgow HIV-Aids Support Group is a ''drug group''. This is not
the case. We are a support group for people who are caring for someone
who is infected with HIV or who has developed Aids, irrespective of how
they became infected. The group is run by carers for carers.
We have a support group which meets on Wednesday evenings from 7pm to
9pm. If someone wants to speak to one of our members before coming to
the support night, please call us on 0141 353 2979. If you get our
answering machine, please leave your name (first name only will be OK)
and your telephone number.

I REFER to your front-page feature on John Godfrey (I'm not a White
Settler), and from my personal experience I wish to add my own rebuttal
of this outrageous suggestion (February 21).
Having been his constituency chairman in Maryhill when he fought the
1992 General Election for the Conservative &amp; Unionist Party, I believe I
am suitably qualified to pass judgment on John Godfrey's qualities and
credentials.
In addition, there are many Maryhill constituents who have reason to
be grateful to him for the problems he solved and the support he
rendered in the 14 months he was their parliamentary candidate.
John Godfrey may well earn his living in London but to those of us who
had the privilege of working with him in Maryhill he was never thought
of as anything else but a fellow Scot because there was no reason to
believe otherwise.
It is to his great credit that, to the best of my knowledge, he has
never sought selection for any English constituency but confined his
parliamentary aspirations to the Scottish Conservative candidates' list,
and this in a period when other Scottish Tories have departed in the
opposite direction seeking greener pastures.
When he was selected in 1991 as the candidate for Glasgow Maryhill it
was by the unanimous vote of a selection committee which even then
realised that John Godfrey was a young Scotsman with a unique political
talent and an extremely bright parliamentary future.
The electorate in Perth and Kinross is indeed fortunate to have the
opportunity at the forthcoming by-election to vote for a Conservative
candidate of this calibre.

I AM most grateful to Mr Phil Gallie, MP, for his endorsement of local
Labour councillors (March 7).
There are indeed ''some excellent local Labour councillors, who happen
to be male'' standing for election to the new South Ayrshire council on
April 6. Together with their equally able female colleagues, they will
make a splendid job of running South Ayrshire.
There are Labour women up and down the country more than able to knock
spots off Mr Gallie. Sometime during the next couple of years, one of
them will.

Murray,

WITH regard to the review of P J Harvey in concert at the Glasgow
Barrowlands, it might be a good idea if the next time David Belcher
reviews a talented and attractive female artist he concentrates more on
her actual music and less on her ''drool'' factor (March 6).
The inches that David Belcher wasted discussing how Polly Harvey
''slinked'' and ''shook her body'' could have been used so much more
constructively. It could be argued that the great change in P J Harvey's
music since the last album and tour due to the band's new line-up, the
absence of Polly Harvey's own guitar playing, and the emergence of her
newly trained, more melodic singing voice was a bit more interesting
than how much David Belcher fancied Polly Harvey.

DAVID BELCHER's article on Mayfest music is inaccurate (March 1).
He states Mayfest 1995 will not bring the same old names -- of the
four artists he mentioned as examples Tom Robinson last appeared in
1990; The Blues Band in 1992, and Jools Holland made his first
appearance at Mayfest in 1994.
Over 70 headline acts appeared at Mayfest 1994 and only 5% were making
a return visit -- principally by demand from Mayfest patrons. There
will, for instance, be many hundreds disappointed that Dick Gaughan will
not be appearing at this year's Mayfest, for not all Mayfest patrons
wish to ''gawp'' or ''shank it up'' at King Tuts and other such venues.
He speaks of ''distinctly unadventurous scheduling''. Apart from the
facts laid out, Mr Belcher could have looked at other parts of the music
programme, eg, Iris de Ment (US), Busi Mhlongo (SA), Alison Brown
Quartet (US), Eleanor McEvoy (Ireland), Llan de Cubel (Spain), Well
Oiled Sisters (Scotland), and many more. The BBC recorded many of our
unadventurous shows.
As for his comment about the ''cutting edge'' to this year's programme
-- someone should have told Mr Belcher that Sharon Shannon and Rock Salt
and Nails appeared at Mayfest years ago.
As to ''living legends'', if any of the 1995 bands sample only a
little of the success enjoyed by bands promoted by Mayfest before they
became living legends then ''Living Legends 1995'' to be will do well;
Wet Wet Wet (1986), Deacon Blue (1987), Hue &amp; Cry (1987), Fairground
Attraction (1988), Nanci Griffiths (1988), Texas (1988) and Suede
(1992).
Mr Belcher must be the only journalist unaware that the Pavilion,
which was programmed to house our rock/pop programme, was flooded just
before Mayfest and we had no option but to transfer to other venues
throughout the city, including the SECC -- not a case of being banished
to the SECC but more one of thanks from a grateful Mayfest for
accommodating us at the last minute.
An old chestnut from Mr Belcher is that Mayfest is paying inflated
fees. When he previously accused Mayfest of this he was asked to name
names and their respective fees. He could not do it then. Will he do it
now?
There is nothing new in his statement that ''Mayfest money will be
used to underwrite artistically valid shows''. Mayfest has been doing
this every year since it first opened its doors on May 1, 1983, and to
suggest otherwise is an insult to all members of the board of Mayfest
and all members of Mayfest staff.
To quote Michael Tumelty, ''So will it work? The box office will
tell.''

MR BLAIR'S robustly blunt speech in defence of the re-ordering of the
Labour Party's constitution carried the day at the Scottish Labour
conference in Inverness. Some thought his margin narrow, but it was far
greater than that enjoyed by any General Election winner since 1935. The
location of his victory is also important; if he can triumph here,
surely no part of the Labour movement is likely to deny the change.
Scottish Labour is a body of (mainly) conservative opinion whatever the
radical intent it seeks to conserve. That Mr Blair has opened it to
changing part of the sacred canon is a considerable achievement. It is
hard to imagine the effect of the alternative which would, as one
delegate noted, have amounted to the infantry abandoning their general
even before coming to grips with the enemy. It would not have been a
fatal rebuff, and would not have ended the battle, but it would have
been a setback, and a modest gift to the Tories. Mr Portillo justified
his reputation as an imaginative politician yesterday by suggesting that
losing Clause 4 damaged Labour's electoral chances. Many will enjoy his
joke.
Much as John Smith did to win his ''one man - one vote'' proposal for
internal Labour democracy, Mr Blair laid his leadership on the line. Had
he not done so the outcome might have been different, but he
concentrated minds. Not many independent observers have believed that
the famous clause was anything other than an electoral liability to be
exploited by Labour's enemies. In this context it has to be remembered
that Liberals as well as the Tories are in that category: Clause 4
frightened off some voters to the Liberals, a factor of immense
importance to Labour's performance in southern England. Like all bogies,
Clause 4 was a useful frightener. Its positive side -- its romantic
content and poetic prose -- was swamped by its electoral cost. Whatever
emerges to replace it, and it may not sound so well, ought to win
friends and influence people where Clause 4 did the reverse.
There is plenty of room for ironic commentary. The clause went through
on the nod in 1918. It was not any sort of compromise but a rhetorical
flourish to which no-one paid much attention originally. Labour was a
trade union creation and the framers of its constitution were more
interested in the distribution of power within the party than in
theoretical commitments. It took time, and the imagined utopia of the
Soviet Union between the two world wars (and during the second) to give
the clause much of its left-wing appeal. That has ebbed with time and
changing social perceptions. Labour, which is the more sentimental of
the two main parties, became so accustomed to the clause that it could
hardly subject it to rational examination. That is now changing fast and
the final obsequies will be pronounced at the national party conference
this autumn. There might be the odd Tory attempt to keep the matter
alive -- partisan nostalgia for the icons of the past is not confined to
those who love them -- but Clause 4 will fade as a political counter. As
the Americans would say: ''It is history.'' Labour in Scotland has led
the way in establishing that status.

* THE Fair Trade Fashion Show 1995, on Thursday at the Assembly Rooms,
George Street, is part of the Edinburgh Peace Festival. In association
with Oxfam, the fashion show aims to present exciting new designs to the
Scottish public and to tell the human stories behind the clothes on the
catwalk.
In stark contrast to the sweatshop environment prevalent in poorer
countries, all clothes are made by small-scale Third World producers who
receive fair wages and safe working conditions. Quondam Beeb
Weathergirl, Vanessa Collingridge, will present the show and special
guests will include Justino Peck, a Mayan Indian farmer from Belize, who
grows cocoa beans for Fair Trade Maya Gold Chocolate. The show kicks off
at 7.30pm.
* PARFUMS Ungaro, Paris, are offering an exclusive scarf free, with
any purchase of Diva 50ml EDT Spray (#29.75), from the Monday. Captured
in a fetching bottle of crystal swathes, the floral essence of the
perfume is supported by the base notes of warm sandalwood, patchouli and
oak moss.
* RIMMEL'S Spring Affair collection (illustrated) introduces eight new
lip and nail colours from #1.75. They have combined romantic lilacs,
soft heathers, and warm pinks to create a fresh, light look. New Rich
Moisture Lipsticks include Nude Beige (soft peach) and Rustic Rose (rich
berry cream) at #2.29. Eye shadow quartets include variations on deep
plum, violet and copper and are priced at #2.20. Translucent Blush is
available in Smoked Oyster (pearlised tawny-bronze) and Pink Rose at
just #1.79.
* PRINCESS Marcella Borghese, the Italian Spa skincare specialist, has
a special offer this month as a thank-you to their customers. From today
until March 25, choose one of two gifts entitled Spa Specialists or Spa
Stylists. Each box contains a version of three trial-sized Borghese
products. The consultant will then help you choose two further
moisturisers (one day and one night) which best suit the requirements of
your skin type. One gift per customer while stocks last.
* ALPHA Jewels launches The Mughal Collection of fine fashion
jewellery this season. The line draws its inspiration from the opulent
Indian jewels made during the Mughal Empire, recognised by the
extravagant use of inlaid gemstones, floral patterns, pendant ornaments,
and tassels. The necklaces, rings, bangles, brooches, and earrings are
available in a matt or polished finish. There are several different
colourways, eg topaz and emerald with a rich sapphire blue. The crystal
stones used in the Mughal collection have been specially commissioned
from Swarovski crystal. Prices range from #35 to #180. Call Alpha Jewels
on 071 267 5661.
* INTERNATIONAL award-winning Scots hairdresser Charlie Miller
launches Colour Direct, a ''World First in Home Hair Colourants''. This
semi-permanent home colourant comes in a non-staining, easy glide stick
and is capable of covering an entire head of hair, including grey. You
just glide the stick on to pre-washed hair, leave for 5-30 minutes and
shampoo off (50 grams of Colour Direct will give on average three full
applications to mid-length hair). There are 12 new shades available from
Boots and Independent Chemists priced #4.99, including Rye, Champagne,
Nutmeg, Truffle, Conker Chilli, Cinnabar, and Ebony.
* LE Maquillage Clarins have new lines and new packaging for spring.
Clarins Rouge Eclat Lipstick will replace the original range, and comes
in 18 shades at #10.50. Ingredients include cocoa butter to nourish and
protect lips and coconut oil to increase gliding power. Clarins Powder
Blush comes in six shades in a white lacquer and gold detail compact at
#16. Ingredients include light reflective pigments and UVA/UVB
protection. There are four new eye colour duos at #16 each plus eye and
lip liner pencils from #8.75.

IT WAS a long stretch. Eight years and 25 crawling minutes by my
watch, with no time off for good dialogue. There are few people in this
world who could maintain an expression of pained resolve, like an Easter
Island statue with a migraine, for such a time. Then again, few people
are Dolly Rawlings, and don't you forget it.
Lynda La Plante wasn't making life easy for the London underworld's
belle dame sans merci in the opening episode of She's Out (ITV, Mon).
The first half of the show seemed determined to defy its titles by
keeping Dolly inside the nick for as long as possible while, outside,
narrative machinery groaned, creaked, and finally lurched into
implausible life. We all did time for this one, and may consider our
debt to plot exposition paid in full.
Anne Mitchell has the trick of playing Dolly, which is to pretend that
the words being put into her mouth are an afterthought at best, a
nuisance at worst. This black widow's life is in her face, in its
infinite weariness and flinty suspicion. Anything La Plante has to offer
in the dialogue department is treated as a very simple prop around which
a bit of facial business can be built. The real meaning, wholly
dependent on Mitchell, is in half-smiles, black eyes, and blank,
lingering, contemptuous stares.
This is probably just as well. Eight years may have passed since
Widows II but the world to which Dolly is obliged to return seems
strangely unchanged. What was once an innovative piece of drama --
proving that women could break through the glass ceiling of the genre
and pull off a blag with the best of them -- now looks, feels and sounds
like caricature. Mitchell excepted, the cast of She's Out could blend
without difficulty into an early episode of Minder, and get most of the
laughs.
There's the cop's dear, grasping old mum and #6 million of sparklers;
the Old Bill overrun with John Thaw impersonators; the ex-cons buttering
up the ''wily old cow'' Rawlings with a mind to parting her from the
gems; and an antique view of women, crooked or not, dancing around their
handbags and their class origins.
''That's Connie . . . Sweet girl.''
''Tart, is she?'' Maybe so, but must every hooker imagine herself as
Marilyn Monroe? Do Equity rules insist that all Irish women be jolly,
devious tipplers ready to sing at the drop of a tear? And is it
absolutely necessary to insist that the brassy East End gel will, at
every opportunity, tell us she just can't stick that toffee-nosed,
middle-class disgraced junkie doctor? You watch it for Mitchell, and
that just about suffices.
What's missing, thus far, from She's Out is what the theatricals call
ensemble playing. Even conflict has to have cohesion. Here we have
types, running true, and La Plante, for all her well-publicised
research, snapping up cliches the way a bottlenose dolphin snaps up a
porpoise.
Actually, the dolphins take their prey with a little more natural
grace, but with their cover well and truly blown, it's the least these
aquatic frauds could do. Local Heroes (Thurs) opened BBC1 Scotland's
Operation Survival series with a gentle paddle in the Moray Firth and a
shock expose of Flipper in the raw. Is nothing sacred?
Beatified by the sort of people who think meat is murder, veg is
virtue, and true spirituality available on demand to anyone attuned to
the natural vibrations (not to mention weird erotic potential) of large
fishy things, the Moray Firth Posse showed themselves unaverse to
duffing up a wee porpoise when the tourists aren't looking. No one is
quite sure why they do this; equally, no one could say why they
shouldn't. Beasts are beastly. It was all mildly fascinating and, in
demolishing the twee image of these ''wonderful mythical animals'',
hugely satisfying.
Ruling Passions (BBC2, Mon) had other fish to fry. It has been an odd
series, erratic and disorganised, with something to say about sex and
colonialism but no good idea of how to say it. The obvious -- that
imperialism meant exploitation on every level -- is stated again and
again as though it were a truth recently uncovered, but it is like
watching tragedy through the wrong end of a telescope.
Among British men far from home with too much power, the habit of
racism, and no companionship there was a ''huge demand for sex''.
Indeed.
''Where-ever the British went they could buy sex for a few pence.'' No
doubt.
But what made this peculiar to the British? And why, with the empire
long gone, does sexual exploitation continue to flourish in lands that
have seen no squaddies in decades? Empires are not good ideas. Ours did
Britain very little good and Britain's subjects no good at all. What
Ruling Passions failed to prove as it flitted across the decades was
that the whores of Nairobi were any better off under the Pax Britannica
than the whores of Aldershot. If all documentaries are a kind of
argument, this is a series in which the conclusions have arrived before
the questions.
Clive James, bless his bon mots, suffers the same affliction.
Postcard from Berlin (BBC1, Tues) was another essay with pictures, its
preconceptions forwarded like unwanted luggage, its setting a stage on
which James could parade his lightly patronising, lightly sexist, and
lightly serious views. The Berliner Luft did not bless him with
eloquence. Instead he drove a Trabant (there must be one left in the
whole of Germany, kept on permanent stand-by for foreign journalists in
need of a sight gag about state socialism) and made cracks about, though
not in, the Wall.
We saw the concrete jungle of the Alexanderplatz and watched Clive
attempt gargantuan meals. We saw the remains of Checkpoint Charlie and
heard Clive say, modestly, ''I once read Mein Kampf in the original but
this was less illuminating''. Very, and unanswerably, true.
Far off in LA, meanwhile, one of the garrulous retired cops exhumed on
Network First's tawdry Hollywood Vice (ITV, Tues) grew sentimental for
the days when he got laid in the line of duty and noted: ''The whole
complexion of vice work has changed . . . The fun has gone.''
For him, perhaps, but not for the sort of documentary makers who have
decided that voyeurism and ratings are a marriage made in heaven, and
that to succeed on the independent network a piece must, at all costs,
have the word ''Hollywood'' in its title, involve sex, stars or both,
and say nothing about anything. Coming soon: Hollywood Parking Lots.

British designers are packing their ideas for this year into a hectic
schedule of 30 shows.
A SUPERMODEL whose enduring fame outshines and will certainly outlast
that of Claudia, Naomi, Linda et al, takes to the catwalk this morning
at Harvey Nichols to launch London Fashion Week. The flaxen-haired model
worshipped by generations of schoolgirls and now endorsing the
importance of London's position on the international fashion circuit is
none other than Barbie. At a press breakfast, Barbie, the most
clothes-conscious doll will be promoting the best of British fashion and
launching a special limited-edition doll, exclusive to the store.
Over the next few days the very best of British designers will then
pack their ideas for autumn/winter 1995 into a hectic schedule of 30
shows -- many of which are underwritten by the continuing support of
event sponsor Vidal Sassoon. The radical elegance of collections by
Alexander McQueen, Hussein Chalayan and Pearce Fionda, which caused such
a stir last season will feature again alongside the top established
labels of Jean Muir, Betty Jackson, Tomasz Starzewski and Nicole Farhi.
Britain's extraordinary ability to nurture fresh, young talent, will
be evident in the New Generation Show, sponsored by Marks &amp; Spencer,
introducing Anthem, Commun, Justin Oh, Lo &amp; Cabon and Stephen Fuller.
Fuller, whose colourful latex dresses for spring have been gracing the
pages of international glossies, creates a modern semi-fitted look
combining industrial textures with traditional cloth that sets out to
shock. Whereas, an irresistible, dark, menacing mood pervades the
slender tailoring from the newly formed partnership of Lo &amp; Cabon.
The retrospective glamour which emerged for spring is given a strong
voice by designers for autumn. Last season's discoveries, Lisa Johnson
and Pearce Fionda, who are going solo this time thanks to sponsorship
from Sebastian Hair Products and Liberty, respectively, give a nostalgic
spin to their sculpted silhouettes. Johnson's vampish vision includes
candyfloss mohair tweeds for fifties, shrug coats. Although design duo
Pearce Fionda has a particular talent for spiral-cut dresses, it is the
pagoda-shaped shoulder line and tucked sleeves of their tailoring that
will mark out their collection for autumn.
Roland Klein's saucy glamourpusses would have strutted the red light
district of 1950s Paris wearing his shiny crimson patent suit with
skin-tight skirt and fake fur collar, or spilling out of his cerise
satin bra-cup dress. Maria Grachvogel (showing her collection in the
accompanying designer exhibition) dresses her sirens in slinky sheaths
of sequins.
Nicole Farhi's vision of woman would be efficiently business-like in
tight flannel dresses and little curvy jackets, while Tomasz
Starzewski's cosseted ladies who lunch will have their waistlines nipped
in by shapely jackets and pencil skirts. Whether nostalgic or modern in
interpretation, autumn will be a season of elegant and unbridled
glamour.
The tour de force of invention, for which British design is known, has
been given a firm financial footing by Vidal Sassoon's sponsorship,
which has been topped up by funds from the DTI. Last season's event
attracted over 1000 retailers from the US, Europe, the Far East, and
Australia.
This season the designer exhibition space has doubled in response to
the growing interest and includes many young fashion and accessory
designers. Several of the cash-strapped designers have received
individual sponsorship for their catwalk shows, notably from car
manufacturers seeking to promote their vehicles to women drivers.
Renault is sponsoring Nicholas Knightly and Alfa Romeo is underwriting
Helen Storey's show, which curiously is taking place in an underground
subway.
Meanwhile, back on the catwalk, making her London debut this season
surprisingly is Margaret Howell, the low-profile designer whose career
spanned two decades of producing soft, understated fashion in beautiful
classic fabrics. She will be joining the line-up of top names like Edina
Ronay, Bella Freud, Paul Costelloe, and Red or Dead, whose collection
picks up on the latest clubland look ski-wear. Their parkas, neoprene
jackets and high-heeled moon boots will become de rigueur at London's
new club Ski Sunday.
It is this eclectic blend of established names sprinkled with fresh
talent which is drawing international press and buyers to the tented
fashion city that has been built specially for the collection and
adjoining exhibition at the Natural History Museum. Such original
displays from a kaleidoscope of designers maintains London's reputation
as a mecca for creativity.

TOLSTOY insisted that the rich would do anything for the poor except
get off their backs. Count Lev Nikolayevich was, admittedly, a man of
dark and peculiar disposition, but nothing in the recorded history of
relations between the rich and poor nations of the world since he died
85 years ago appears to contradict him. The difference historically
between the rich and the poor is largely accounted for by the presence
of sustained economic growth, and this in itself is a fairly recent
manifestation. In the mid-eighteenth century the distribution of income
and wealth between nations was relatively even; since then a few nations
in a narrow geographical band have streaked ahead. Britain was probably
somewhat richer than India in the eighteenth century, but the difference
in income per head has multiplied dramatically since then.
It is useful to be reminded of the extraordinary global economic
disparity which exists at the moment. The South African Energy Minister,
Pik Botha, touched on it in a lively speech in Glasgow this week and his
analysis can be found elsewhere in this newspaper this morning. The core
of his argument is that sub-Saharan Africa will suffer continuing
tragedies unless the economically developed nations join with South
Africa in the investment of resources and endeavour which will allow
South Africa to act as a sort of catalyst for development in the poorer
countries. The transfer of energy through this African Trilateral
Initiative, as he calls it, is the key, although he insists that it will
not be a charitable venture but one based on pragmatism, profits, and
the efforts predominantly of the private rather than public sector. This
is not a new concept. The emphasis on the private sector as the major
agent in development is relatively fresh, although the IMF and World
Bank have tried to develop this particular economic aspect in poorer
countries in recent years. Mr Botha's idea is interesting, but it is not
clear if it is sufficiently different to enthuse either Africans or the
developed nations, most of whom are meeting in Copenhagen this weekend
to plan ways to end poverty and social injustice around the world.
The width of the task which this conference has set for itself
indicates some of the problems which have surfaced, and the frustrations
which have accompanied them. At a cost of $30m and with a billing
describing it as history's biggest gathering of world leaders (with the
exception of Clinton, Yeltsin, and Major) the conference has caused some
anger among non-governmental organisations like Oxfam and Save the
Children. Some NGOs accuse it of being little more than a talking-shop
and suggest that the money spent on it could have been put to better
uses. More seriously, there are suggestions that summits of this sort,
with their blockbuster agendas, casts of thousands, and excessive
expenditure of hot air, are things of the past. The organisers
proclaimed yesterday that the conference was a success; that is not the
point. It will only be a success if the various measures adopted for the
relief of poverty and social justice are put into effective operation in
the months and years to come. For that, we must depend largely on the
goodwill of the developed nations, though the suspicion must remain that
Tolstoy got it right.

THOSE living in fear of the Red Dawn may now draw breath. The next
Labour Government will not deliver bloody revolution. I have been in
Inverness less than 24 hours and I can tell you this lot couldn't run
the proverbial whelk stall.
Something catastrophic has happened in the Scottish Labour Party. The
organisation is in free fall. There are hundreds of journalists here --
from Scotland, London even overseas -- and we are beside ourselves with
rage and astonishment.
It's Chicago 1968. It's the SFA at the World Cup. It's the biggest
public relations disaster I've ever seen, and it's happening right here
in Inverness.
For the last few weeks, Labour's Glasgow headquarters, who organised
this event, has become a Bermuda Triangle to media inquiries. Calls go
unreturned, faxes are ignored. Press officer Maureen Smith is seldom
available.
Although we all booked weeks ago, many of us reached Inverness on
Thursday night without accreditation. Dozens of reporters, cameramen and
technicians had to wander conference premises for hours without so much
as a pass.
Until yesterday morning -- and I booked six weeks ago -- I had neither
pass, agenda, timetable, note of resolutions, nor any kind of briefing
material.
ON Thursday night, we hack pack descended on the Caledonian Hotel.
Many of us had come a considerable distance. We'd been promised a press
conference at 7.30 sharp, followed by a reception where Tony Blair no
less would be present and mingling.
Naturally, most of us promptly surrounded Maureen Smith to ask
urgently for our accreditation. Miss Smith proved a woman with a big
smile, big beads and black leggings. She said vaguely that we'd get the
necessary papers tomorrow. She said that the briefing would be a little
late -- 7.40 -- and that Blair would not arrive until 9.30.   There
followed two hours of confusion, blundering and farce.
At 7.40, we all assembled in a conference room. We were then asked to
move next door. In this room, far too small, nervous waiters plied us
with free booze.
After eight, someone called cheerily that there was a ''slight
delay''. After a few minutes, grumbling, we filed back to the conference
room. A few seconds later, we were ordered out by a bejeaned ''rep'' of
the Union of Boilerworkers.
After 10 more minutes in the cramped drinking den, we were seething.
For this we had missed Glenda Jackson and Tony Benn in full oratory at
the Cummings Hotel! Then orders came: We were to go to another
conference room down the corridor.
Clutching notebooks, recorders and briefcases, we processed into the
new venue. Cigarettes appeared, lighters flicked, there were important
people here -- Colin Mackay, Fiona Ross, Stuart Trotter, all the London
boys -- and the rage was mounting.
Suddenly came the shriek ''All cigarettes out now or you leave!'' and
a youth strutted to the front and turned to smirk at us.
''No smoking'' he said, ''If you want to smoke -- you go now.'' He had
glasses, an Ulster accent, and the manifest arrogance of a fifth-form
prefect.
There was a long and terrible silence as we pondered the merits of
flight or homicide.
A grizzled old reporter spoke for all.
''Who the hell are you?''
The lad beamed. ''Press officer.''
When Jack McConnell, Scottish Labour's supremo arrived a minute or two
later, he was visibly shaken. At once he said: ''Sorry, you're all free
to smoke.'' Even this vital and essentially likeable man knew things had
gone badly wrong.
When Blair did arrive, very late, most of us had scattered across
town. In the event, he scarcely mingled at all. At the Caledonian Hotel,
Maureen Smith and the Prefect were nowhere to be seen.
Yesterday morning at the Eden Court Theatre, we journalists denied
accreditation had to run a gauntlet of insolent stewards and merciless
leafleters to reach reception. At this chaotic counter, we were finally
issued with lapel clip passes and wads of briefing material.
These passes were pink. Within minutes, upstairs, it emerged they were
the wrong colour. Without green passes, we were forbidden admission to
the conference floor.
When the Nationalists met here last autumn, journalists had a large
quiet private room complete with typewriters, paper, free coffee, and
plenty of courtesy phones. At Labour this weekend, we have been given
the end of the lobby. Half a dozen tables, 40 chairs and six ashtrays
are deemed fit for the nation's ears. The area and seats have been
progressively invaded by party delegates.
Behind the bar, and allegedly in charge of all this, is none other
than the Prefect. He tells me happily that there are no telephones
available and he doesn't know when they can upgrade my pass.
At length, the incorrigibly cheerful Maureen Smith appears with sheet
of magic pistachio green passes. As she has no scissors she tears one
off -- raggedly -- with her fingers.
I have to tear off a little more to make it fit in my lapel clip.
I maliciously note that the Prefect is wearing a lapel clip bearing
the name Andrew McMenamin.
Something has gone badly wrong here. Is it lack of funds, lack of
thought, or a deliberate policy to keep the media humble? The Scottish
Labour Party dominates our local government. It should be a smooth,
powerful organisation. I've been here a day and I've seen better press
liaison at the Free Presbyterian Synod.
Just before Tony Blair's speech, the little people came running with
advance copies. They had brought 30 for 200 journalists. A friend at
Grampian Television told me that they booked Tony Blair, weeks ago, for
an exclusive interview today. This morning, Grampian learned that
Blair's office phoned Scottish Television, offering them an exclusive
interview with the extraordinary inducement that there was a BBC crew on
hand to do it.
There's a story here. We'll read it all one day in Jack McConnell's
book.

Sam McKnight is not a man to sit around twirling his curling tongs.
Anne Simpson watches the master hairdresser at work in Millan where his
snippers are making it snappy
IN THE wings the man in the Vivienne Westwood tartan trousers is
anointing a conveyor belt of models, smoothing, stroking, cupping each
girl's hair as purposefully as a potter shaping clay. There is a grave
intensity about his features heightened by a few days growth of hobo
bristle. Over the years he has learned to deploy this concentration to
cancel out the bedlam of his pampered world.
This week he is in Milan, next week London and Paris, followed by New
York. And in each location Sam McKnight, with his own exacting
professionalism, will top the style of individual designers showing in
the latest round of International Collections.
To call him a hairdresser is to reduce his skill to titivation. His
role instead is like that of a master picture framer working in the
studio of an important painter. It can either validate that artist's
inspiration or punish it with ridicule. Such is the power contained in
McKnight's comb.
Twenty odd years ago he left his home town of New Cumnock for London
and in that time McKnight has become a hero to all those women who know
the value of placing their public heads in someone else's hands.
Now in his fortieth year, he lives both in London and New York, the
Ayrshire accent having thinned down into that neutral, rootless voice of
a person forever darting between continents.
Yet those who work with him, the world over, say it is McKnight's very
Scottishness -- the gift of discretion, the lack of fuss, the quiet
mocking of absurdity -- which make him so special in a trade defined by
the proposterous flounce.
He is a modest man, who mixes so easily with the planet's Big Time
smilers he doesn't need to flaunt their names. But the results of his
craft can be seen in practically every other international fashion
magazine where the heads which have bowed before him include
Linda-Cindy-Kate-Naomi . . . that litany of role-model women who
paradoxically owe their entire identities to the artifices of others.
Behind the scenes at the Ferragamo show McKnight is straightening,
gelling and lacquering hair until it hangs like an unbroken silk curtain
on the shoulders.
The day before at Anna Molinari for Blue Marine, he drew the hair up
high into a tousled top knot that was ''fun and sexy''. Tomorrow for
Genny, he will bouffe it from the back of the crown to give depth, then
comb it straight, leaving just enough wet-look disarray to suggest a
rainstorm backstage: these are, after all, the collections for next
winter.
In each case the clothes he complements are narrow in design, often
with fitted jackets and straight skirts, short and long, and sometimes
dipping into a fan of pleats at the back. A no-frills story and,
accordingly, hardly a curl in sight. As for his Prada look later in the
week, he won't offer the slightest hint because the label represents
some of the hottest news in town.
Half-an-hour before the Ferragamo show McKnight is installed at the
far end of the changing space, working on the models' heads in relays.
Cutting at this late stage is rare although he will ''hack off a girl's
fringe'' if he suddenly feels this would be an improvement. But mostly
shapes are achieved by twirling and pasting.
''In this instance,'' he says, ''I saw the clothes at rehearsal the
night before and it was then the head lines were decided. But sometimes
we have only 10 minutes to work on a girl because she won't reach us
from her previous show until the very last minute.''
With Westwood's collections he may have as much as three hours to
create the styles for her costume dramas, but much of the blonde froth
that has accompanied her Moulin Rouge look of past seasons was down to
McKnight's advance trickery with wigs.
The international collections, stretching over a month three or four
times a year, are the most frenetic aspect of McKnight's work and for
each season he assembles a band of assistants, the gypsies of the trade
who travel from show to show toting tool bags filled with straightening
irons, pomades, aerosols and unguents, some of which bear McKnight's own
label and are now available through Boots.
But when the shows are over this is not a man to sit around twirling
his curling tongs. Instead McKnight goes on location work for magazines,
a stint where his task often extends to caretaker of sun-frazzled egos
as well as split ends.
Women trust him because he knows instinctively how to make them feel
at their best without a great palaver. And just occasionally he can coax
famous women into a new appearance above the shoulderline.
Such women may be happy to change the look of their of wardrobe every
season but a surprising timidity may overcome them at the chance to
alter a hairstyle. Perhaps not without reason: witness the criticism
hurled at the straight-out-of-the shower coiffure McKnight devised for
the Princess of Wales in New York the other month.
He would never be so crass to say so, of course, but this was
obviously a style Diana herself enjoys because off and on she has been
wearing it privately for a couple of years.
With metal straightening clips clenched between his teeth, gel on his
palms and aerosols and water sprays stowed in every available pocket,
McKnight is now on his last-minute rounds of inspection before Ferragamo
lift the curtain on The Look.
''Where's Sara?'' he calls. ''I haven't had a chance to check Sara,
yet.'' But Sara is now transfixed by the wizardry of another, having her
false eyelashes applied. Still, just before each girl steps forward to
confront the catwalk's glare, McKnight's will be the last steadying hand
that she encounters, a hand with a comb in it offering one final sweep
as a small benediction.
Then, when it's over and all the coiffurier's peculiar ironmongery has
been scooped into hold-alls for ferrying to the next show, the man in
the Vivienne Westwood tartan trousers will have vanished, leaving behind
only a fine spume of hair lacquer to denote he was ever here at all.

EXACTLY two weeks ago this morning, the British and Irish Prime
Ministers stood side by side in Belfast and revealed their controversial
''framework document'' on the future of Northern Ireland.
In page after page, clause after clause, the message was clear. The
extent of the ''shared understanding'' between John Major and his new
Dublin counterpart, John Bruton, was not what the Unionists of Ulster
wanted to hear but what they had feared ever since reading the Times a
month earlier.
Inspired leaks in that newspaper about new cross-border bodies
designed to harmonise policy in northern and southern Ireland had raised
deep concern among Unionists of all shades. In the event, the summit of
Major and Bruton in Belfast served to confirm such apprehension and
provoked an immediately hostile reaction from the small but
significantly influential body of Unionist MPs at Westminster.
Had such proposals been revealed in Northern Ireland at any time in
the past 25 years, the reaction would have been far worse and possibly
violent and rebellious, as happened in 1974 and 1985 when earlier
London-Dublin agreements were unveiled. In 1995, it was not that the
message was any less palatable for the Unionists, it was rather that the
atmosphere of peace now prevailing across the country has changed life
utterly.
However angry Unionists such as James Molyneaux and Ian Paisley are at
the framework document, they are also aware that the streets of Ulster
are not what they were, that conflict has given way to peace, and that
in the eyes of even the extremists there is no willingness to go back to
war.
To date, there is no sign of a cohesive rebellion against the two
Governments' proposals. Indeed, it seems that the Unionist response has
already lost some momentum and, instead, its own leadership is coming
under as much strain and scrutiny as the framework document is being
questioned.
While there is undoubtedly considerable antipathy towards the
British-Irish plan, the big question is what to do about it. To that
end, and underneath the Union flag fluttering over the Unionist party
headquarters at Belfast's Glengall Street, Ulster MPs and other senior
office-bearers have been in conclave behind closed doors. The vibes
emanating from their discussions suggest all is far from well, with
increasing speculation that the days of 74-year-old Molyneaux as party
leader are now numbered.
On March 18, Molyneaux will face re-election at the annual meeting of
the Ulster Unionist Council but even among some of those closest to him,
there is concern about what they see as his embarrassing failure to
exert more influence over John Major on the crucial issue of
cross-border links with Dublin.
Molyneaux's much-vaunted special relationship with Major seemed to
offer Unionists a sense of reassurance during much of the two-year-long
negotiations with Dublin over the framework proposals. In the event,
Molyneaux and, even more so, his party faithful feel he was once again
''let down'' in much the same way as with Margaret Thatcher 10 years ago
when she signed the Hillsborough pact giving the Irish Government a
limited say in Ulster's affairs.
The private bickering in Unionist ranks threatens soon to spill over
into a full-scale leadership battle between several of Molyneaux's
lieutenants at Westminster, who believe the writing is on the wall for
his career and that his authority is now damaged beyond repair.
Perhaps the most difficult problem for the Unionists is getting across
the reasons for their opposition to the London-Dublin plans,
particularly since they are only for discussion and will not be
implemented without ''the consent and agreement'' of a majority in
Northern Ireland.
''I believe that the course upon which Ulster has now been set by the
parameters outlined as British Government policy can be reversed,'' says
John Taylor, one of the leading contenders to replace Molyneaux, when
the latter stands down, probably later this year.
Taylor listed 14 objections to the framework proposals which he and
other Unionists claim is ''charting Ulster towards a united Ireland''.
The proposals are a conditional surrender to the IRA and a denial of
democratic control for the Northern Ireland majority, he says.
The powers to be conferred on a new Northern Ireland assembly would be
limited and overridden by Westminster and Dublin influences.
The impetus for north-south, cross-border bodies would also rest with
London and Dublin. These new institutions would be designed to harmonise
policies on an all-Ireland basis. There is a promise but no commitment
from the Irish Government to change its offensive constitutional claim
of jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. Finally, if the proposals are now
acceptable, the two Governments reserve the right in paragraph 47 of
their framework document to go ahead on their own with further
co-operation aimed at harmonising policies.
The problem for Unionists, such as Taylor, is that the Ulster
electorate seems politically punch-drunk by the complexity of the plans
before them and unclear about how they can be opposed.
The view most commonly expressed is that the Unionists should ''get
into talks'' with the Government and propose an alternative which is
based on setting up a new Northern Ireland assembly, which in turn would
established relationships, and possibly north-south bodies, with Dublin.
The Unionists believe they still have considerable leverage at
Westminster and, as they have already done on three occasions, are
likely to continue to vote against the Government. However, that too
poses a dilemma. What if the Government actually fell? Would a Labour
administration be any more sympathetic to the Unionists, given that
there is all-party support for the framework document at Westminster?
Another suggested ploy is to join forces with Ian Paisley's Democratic
Unionist Party and establish a new, united, pan-Unionist front, but that
does not meet with approval from those who want to avoid a
Protestant-based sectarian image.
Last year, Molyneaux was called a ''Judas Iscariot'' by Paisley, and
relations between the two parties reached a new low. However, the
history of Unionism suggests that in times of political crisis the two
groupings forge closer links and that looks likely to happen now, if not
on a formal footing.
Speculation that the campaign against the framework proposals might
reach the forthcoming Kinross and Perthshire by-election in the form of
a Unionist candidate, aiming to embarrass the Conservative vote, has
received virtually no attention in Ulster. The idea surfaced last
weekend after a Unionist Party meeting, but given the upbeat mood in
Britain about the peace process, there is little confidence such a
candidate would attract sufficient votes to alter the course of the
contest. At best, the idea is being seriously considered if only as a
means of drawing public attention in Britain to the fact that the
British-Irish plan for Northern Ireland does not have wide acceptance.
So, two weeks after John Major and John Bruton met in Belfast, a
political stalemate is settling upon the peace process. The Governments
appear in no hurry to put pressure on anyone to accept or even reject
their proposals. All they are saying at this stage is that people should
talk about them.
The best the Unionists can hope for in the months to come is that a
mixture of public antipathy towards the proposed future all-Ireland
links, coupled with the Ulster MPs undoubted voting influence at
Westminster, will lead Mr Major to adopt a sympathetic ear to their
pleas for an alternative policy, if and when the talking really starts
on Ulster's future.
For most people, the prospects of a political settlement remains a
long way off. Keeping the new-found peace is an easier option.

<FLAG>SCOTTISH LABOUR PARTY ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>979452122</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCOTS Parliament with equal representation for women took a step
forward yesterday when the Labour conference agreed to support continued
negotiations on a mechanism to bring this about.
While most media eyes were on Labour's Clause 4 debate, Canon Kenyon
Wright, of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, attending Inverness
as an observer, said: ''Although most people are saying that Clause 4 is
the most important thing here today, I firmly believe that in the long
run we will look back and say that this paper on gender equality was the
most important thing for the future of Scotland.
''Indeed, one senior Labour Party figure has just said to me that it
is a historic breakthrough.''
The desire for gender equality has been dogged by a key difference
between the Labour Party, which sees it as vital to enshrine this
principle in statute, and its Liberal Democrat partners on the
convention, who share the 50:50 aspiration but cannot accept legislative
enforcement.
A supplementary report to the conference yesterday made clear that
progress had been made on a compromise acceptable to the two parties and
to the STUC and other groups. This involved an ''electoral contract'' --
a formal agreement between the two parties to accept the principle that
there should be an equal number of men and women in the first Scottish
Parliament.
However, instead of legislating for this, as Labour wants, it has been
agreed to do this through a binding pact with other parties. Both Labour
and the Liberal Democrats would agree to field equal numbers of male and
female candidates, to be fairly distributed across the country's
marginal and safe seats.
The additional member system of proportional representation would then
be used to ensure that gender balance came as close as possible to
equality in a parliament large enough to ensure effective
representation.
At a news conference called by the women meeting across the party
divide, they confirmed, as reported in The Herald earlier this week,
that they had achieved a breakthrough.
One of the leading members of the group, Edinburgh academic Alice
Brown, said: ''We see the new Scottish Parliament as a historic and
unique opportunity for women to play a full and equal part in Scottish
political life. We want the new parliament to be radical and different
from the Westminster model and to break the mould of equal
representation.''
She said there was consensus among the women in different parties that
there was a need for change and they were determined to break the
deadlock on constitutional issues and find a mechanism for the first
Scottish Parliament which would satisfy all those involved.
Councillor Marilyne MacLaren, convener of the Scottish Liberal
Democrats, said the formal electoral contract to be agreed between the
two parties would apply only to the first Scottish Parliament.
Negotiations in the weeks to come would flesh out the scheme but the
cross-party group was optimistic that a workable and fair scheme would
be adopted.
For Labour, Rosina McCrae said the scheme was not a fudge but
represented their desire to reach agreement within the convention and
prove that it was possible for different beliefs to co-exist within a
compromise scheme.
There will still be some difficulties with the Labour Party's policy
confirmed yesterday that statutory means are the best way of ensuring
gender balance. Conference passed, with relatively little debate because
of the very high level of consensus, a series of motions supportive of a
Scottish Parliament which continued to enshrine the 50:50 gender balance
aspiration.
In an apparent reference to doubts on gender equality suggested by
Tony Blair earlier this week, Mr Peter Neilsen, of the NUM, said: ''Now
we hear there may be practical difficulties in achieving this. There can
be no backtracking or watering down of this. There must be a formal
mechanism for gender balance right from the start no matter what the
difficulties.''
Another resolution carried yesterday  added that the next Labour
Government should ensure that the Scottish Parliament, once enacted, may
only be dissolved with the consent of both the UK and the Scottish
Parliament itself -- a principle of entrenchment that has been resisted
until now by the Labour leadership.

As American-style cheerleaders get set to bounce onto the Scottish
scene, Sara Villiers suggests this is a decorative art we could well do
without
BLESS their little cotton socks but could the Americans hold fire with
their latest export? At a time when sportswomen in the UK are striving
for increased recognition, support and sponsorship, a trend arrives
which literally relegates women to the sidelines. Leaping about,
squeaking slogans and showing a bit of thigh.
The Claymores, Scotland's first professional American football team,
are deep in training and psyching themselves up for their debut in the
World League of American Football, a joint venture of America's National
Football League and Rupert Murdoch's Fox Inc/News Corp which features
six European teams; the Scottish Claymores, London Monarchs, Frankfurt
Galaxy, Rhein Fire (Dusseldorf), Amsterdam Admirals and Barcelona
Dragons.
The Claymores have not only got the full kit -- the padded costumes
and protective helmets -- they've also got the essential accessory, with
22 Scottish women signed up to be their professional cheerleaders.
Aged between 18-25 these women, who include students and teachers,
have committed themselves to three nights of training a week until the
league begins on April 9, with an opening match at Murrayfield stadium.
To a woman they claim it is the fitness regime, and not the glamorous
image, which attracts them to the job.
''I was looking simply for a way to keep up my dancing,'' says Claire
Cunningham, a 21-year-old secretary from Edinburgh, explaining that she
originally competed in Highland Dancing before moving on to
disco-dancing competitions when she was 18. However, she concedes that
the idea of performing in front of a 67,000-strong crowd has its allure.
''It could lead to something else,'' she says hopefully.
That seems unlikely. If American Football does take off in this
country then doubtless its quarter-backs will be feted but the
cheerleaders are almost certain to remain anonymous glam girls. Ramona
Braganza, the charming choreographer of the Claymore dancers, is a
cheerleader for the Los Angeles Raiders and insists that the cutely
named Raiderettes' contribution is vital to the game: ''If our team is
on the offence we try to keep the crowd quiet but if the other team is
on the offence than we get the crowd involved in a distracting roar.
Cheerleaders have influenced the score that way.''
But to what degree is that contribution recognised? Claymore
quarterbacks can expect to earn $20,000 but you can bet your bottom
dollar that the cheerleaders won't be raking in those kinds of sums,
although they will be making paid promotional appearances.
At a training session in the Marcos Leisure Centre in Glasgow the
cheerleaders certainly looked as though they were having fun, performing
the sexually suggestive routines, all pelvic thrusts and wiggling butts.
They talked excitedly of making their stadium debuts but I couldn't help
finding it depressing that they were so enthusiastic about this American
import.
Admittedly, my Primary 6 gang -- ie, the gang I was sometimes allowed
to be in -- once got hooked on the notion. Obsessed by the film Grease,
we had clocked Olivia Newton John making the grade in cheerleader
trials, in a jaunty Jefferson High sweatshirt, short skirt and big red
and white pom-poms.
It looked fun. Inspired by the same bored-out-of-our-brains motivation
which has us staging elaborate beauty pageants -- it's my turn to be
Miss America -- we thought it would be a hoot to get a cheerleading team
together and duly trooped off to the dinnertime five-aside tournament.
Slight snag: we were still at that boy-hating stage and would rather
munch worms and wear navy socks than sing support for the boys in our
school, so our cheerleading consisted of energetically catcalling the
other teams instead.
So, I can understand how cheerleading could seem cute to a bunch of
10-year-olds but I'm baffled that a group of supposedly sussed career
women can get so excited about waving some pom-poms in the air. Last
week, channel-hopping through the small hours, I landed on American
Gladiators, the surprisingly tamer template of the British version. One
of the female contestants, April Wheat, was reverentially introduced as
a cheerleader for the University of Texas' football team. Ignoring the
athletic prowess which had her pitching her titchy frame against a
hulking firewoman, a former Olympic kayak rower, the presenters
continually trilled about April being a cheerleader.
When quizzed, she giggled inanely and reckoned she was a good
cheerleader ''because of my hair'' -- long and blonde, natch -- and
''because of my little gymnast's body''. If she wasn't a bimbo she was
doing a damn fine job of impersonating one, all wide-eyed baby-blues and
vapid smile. This is the face of American aspiration? The audience
backed April all the way. Her opponent might have represented the States
in the Olympics but, heck, April's vocation was of a nobler calling --
parading her ''little gymnast's body'' on the touchlines.
Braganza might contend that the Claymore cheerleaders will try to get
away from the stereotypical scanty dress -- hardly surprising
considering Scottish climes, goosebumps are so unappealing -- and the
sexist connotations. So, will there be any guys twirling batons, kicking
their legs and waving pom-poms for the Claymores? Nope, the beefcake is
all out there, centre-stage, on the field, performing the glory, glory
stuff. The cheesecake, I mean cheerleaders, are mere decorations, the
nineties equivalent of camp followers.
Get a pulse girls, kick this trend into touch -- back over the
Atlantic where it belongs.

TONY BLAIR challenged and at times almost pleaded with his Scottish
party conference yesterday to be prepared to restate its beliefs by
rewriting Clause 4 of the Labour Constitution.
At the end of the debate, he succeeded beyond the expectations of most
of his supporters when the conference voted 58%-41% for a motion backing
change.
The Labour leader also made clear his unwillingness to consider any
deals with the SNP telling delegates ''there is no common cause with the
Nationalists and nor will there ever be.''
He rejected the argument that additions could be made to a retained
Clause 4 as ''a cop- out.''
''No matter how you stretch it and turn it, Clause 4 says we believe
in common ownership of the whole economy. Words do have meaning and we
should say what we really believe.''
The party believed there was a role for public ownership -- for
example in the railways, the Post Office and education. He said Labour
would ''renationalise'' the NHS so that it again reflected the values of
its founders.
However, he added, there should also be a thriving private sector
''where competitive markets should exist alongside public ownership in
an economy which works in the public interest.''
He did not believe it was wrong to touch the words of the party
constitution. Labour was not a preservation society but a dynamic living
movement.
Mr Blair said that the previous night, at a reception, a delegate had
asked him why he was bothering with the clause, when Labour was 40
points ahead in the opinion polls.
''I tell you when people talk like that a shiver goes from the top of
my head to the soles of my feet,'' he said. ''It is not opinion polls
which win power; it is a General Election.''
When that election came, he warned, ''it is going to be as much about
us as about the Conservatives, make no mistake about that.
''The question people are going to ask is 'do we trust Labour?'
''If we haven't the courage to change ourselves, why should they have
the courage to trust us with power?''
At times he abadoned his text arguing ''this is not about denying the
principles of the party it is about rediscovering them.''
He admitted to a ''burning ambition not simply to swop places with the
Government but to lead the country in a different direction.''
Mr Blair confirmed that a Labour Government would legislate for a
Scottish Parliament in its first year in power. John Smith had said the
creation of such a parliament was for him ''unfinished business.'' Mr
Blair added: ''It is business I am determined to finish.''
He accused the SNP of wanting to break up Britain when we should be
breaking down barriers. ''Scotland's problem is not the English.
Scotland's problem is the Tories. Never make the mistake of equating the
two.''
* Tory attacks on Mr Blair continued yesterday, with Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd accusing the Labour leader of turning Conservative. In a
speech at Birmingham University, he said: ''All political parties in
Britain are now having to redefine where they stand. Mr Blair is trying
to board the Conservative ship, and run up his own flag on our masthead.
He appears to accept most of the changes of the last fifteen years.''

Just as she's trying to prove to the world that she is more than just
a pretty face, Elizabeth Hurley is picked from a list of the world's
most beautiful women to become the face of Estee Lauder -- which will
bring her fame and fortune, and should do no harm to her acting career
either, as
Allan Laing explains
USING two pieces of black sticky-backed plastic, the cardboard bit
from a toilet roll, and 24 over-sized safety pins, the presenters of
Blue Peter could probably make an Elizabeth Hurley. The one that was
made earlier has now been launched as the face to sell a million powder
puff compacts for Estee Lauder, the international cosmetics giant.
Miss Hurley, of whom it has been said ''Is there no start to this
woman's talents?'' is determined to prove that she is not just a pretty
face. It will not be easy for the poor girl. Mind you, it is
scandalously unfair to describe her as no more than a ''pretty face''.
Any fool knows that she is also the proud possessor of a stunning figure
which (it is worth noting in this age of silicon implants) is all her
own work. In fact, she is drop-dead gorgeous.
Her great claim to fame, for the moment at least, is that she is the
girlfriend of Four Weddings and a Funeral star, Hugh ''Cary'' Grant. But
it should be remembered that she is an actress in her own right, the
highlight of her distinguished cinematic career to date being the
portrayal of a flight attendant (the dolly with a trolley) in the
thriller Passenger 57, a film which curiously missed out on the Oscar
nominations.
In most people's minds, however, she is best remembered for her
remarkable performance during last year's London premiere of Four
Weddings where she turned up wearing what could only be described as
almost a black silk Versace dress. Unfortunately, in all the
Hurley-burly, Mr Versace had forgotten to sew the seams together.
Other highlights of her career include turning on the Christmas lights
in London's Bond Street last year and being smacked about by a gang of
female muggers as she made her way home one night.
Of Elizabeth Hurley a hot-blooded man's dreams are made. She is, to
employ the West of Scotland venacular, a strapping lassie. Recently the
discerning readers of Penthouse magazine voted her the woman they would
most like to see in the altogether (though this particular accolade must
be seen in perspective; Anthea Turner was a runner-up). Still, it is
perhaps ironic that, in her teenage punk phase, during which she sported
a rather fetching silver ring in her nose, Ms Hurley performed in a
dance troupe called Vile Bodies.
She was born in Basingstoke some 29 years ago, the daughter of an Army
major father and a piano teacher mother. She went to a local
comprehensive from which she was expelled in her sixth year. She was, by
all accounts, a kenspeckle figure among shoppers in Basingstoke High
Street of a Saturday afternoon with her blonde-dyed hair, leather mini
skirt, and studded dog collar. It was around this time that she started
stepping out with a punk chap called Septic.
In her early 20s, having discarded both her punk image and poor old
Septic, she went to drama school in London and emerged an actress. To be
serious, she did make a genuinely stunning television debut as the
eponymous heroine in Christabel, Dennis Potter's film about an
Englishwoman's experiences in Nazi Germany. Her performance was
critically acclaimed.
The problem was that she peaked too soon. Since then she has made the
occasional appearance in television dramas and a handful of obscure
small-scale independent feature films (The Orchid House, Beyond Bedlam,
Skipper, and Aria). In a determined bid to expand her professional
horizons, she settled in Hollywood for two years, where -- to be honest
-- she hardly set the heather on fire.
It has been suggested that her failure in America was not unconnected
with the fact that, despite spending money on voice coaching, she failed
to master the Yankie accent. Her acting talents were certainly not
stretched to the limit in Passenger 57.
Today (and probably tomorrow and maybe even the next day) she shares a
London home with the slightly-more-famous Mr Grant. Together they make
the perfect showbiz couple, a pret-a-porter Liz Taylor and Richard
Burton, the plain man's Branagh and Thompson. Mr Grant clearly has faith
in his partner's abilities, having appointed her ''head of development''
at his own Simian Films company. He was, by the way, obliging enough to
turn up at Estee Lauder's Manhattan press launch for Ms Hurley
yesterday. She was the one in the tight-fitting yellow two-piece; he was
the one who looked like a badly-packed parachute.
Now, with her new make-up contract, Ms Hurley will be famous for being
even more famous. It will not only make her rich it will also keep her
supplied in lipstick for the foreseeable future. Wisely, she has chosen
to accentuate the positive in pursuance of her career's development. She
is a beautiful woman, possessed of that English rose poshness and
sophistication which the American market will adore. She claims, by the
way, that she eats like a pig, takes no exercise, and shuns beauty
treatments.
According to the cosmetics company, whose products have previously
been associated with the, shall we say, ''more mature'' woman, the
search to find a replacement for their previous face (supermodel Paulina
Porizkova) took them two years. Fifteen of the most beautiful women in
the world were seriously considered. Ms Hurley won through thanks to her
''warm and charismatic beauty''

THE Clause 4 debate was a passionate one, with powerful speeches on
both sides.
Mr George MacGregor (Unison), moving the pro-reform motion, said: ''We
cannot continue to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the changing
world around us.''
He accused Clause 4 defenders of ''sentimentalising a past that never
was.'' Labour needed a reasoned and well-argued position stated in
language that people today could understand.
Seconding, Mr Ian Gray (Lothians Euro seat) said Clause 4 contained
something of the spirit of poetry but its language was also allusive and
arcane and could easily be misunderstood. ''This is not the time for
poetry,'' he said.
However, Mr Bill Butler (Maryhill) said the clause contained the
fundamental values for which the party stood. One of its framers, Sidney
Webb, had said it left it open to the movement at any given time to
decide how much public ownership there should be.
Ms Fiona Farmer (MSF) said she regretted that the debate had been
launched. It was ''ill-timed and a distraction from the real task that
has to be achieved.''
Mr George Galloway, MP for Hillhead, in a powerful speech, said the
conference was being asked to abandon the clause before it knew what the
leadership proposed to put in its place.
''However nice -- and he is nice -- the butcher is, no-one buys a pig
in a poke and I don't believe this conference is going to do that
either.''
Labour Prime Ministers like Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan had never
tried to drop the clause. Wilson was not a Marxist nor Callaghan ''a
Bolshevist expropriator.''
If Labour abandoned its basic principles, it could be ''in office but
not in power'' and he did not think they would stay in office long.
Dr John Reid, Labour MP for Motherwell North, who followed, said Mr
Galloway who had prayed the Wilson and Callaghan Premierships in aid,
had spent all his time attacking them.
He argued that Clause 4 taken literally meant public ownership of all
utilities. When delegates dissented, Dr Reid said, therefore, they were
admitting the case for a thriving private sector.
Ms Mary Picken (Glasgow District) said Labour should recognise that
the market economy did not work in the interests of the great majority
of working people.
Mrs Helen Liddell, MP for Monklands East, said: ''I am appalled by our
conservatism, that we cannot be as radical as they were when they
drafted Clause 4.''
Mr Derek Hodgson (UCW) said the only people able to use Clause 4
effectively politically were the Tories, who used it to frighten
potential Labour voters.
Mr Dennis Canavan, MP for Falkirk West, claimed the real objective of
the opponents of the clause was to reject common ownership, even
although the clause did not call for every single enterprise ''down to
the local chip shop'' to be nationalised. That was the ''hidden agenda''
behind the move to dump it.
Mr Brian Wilson, MP for Cunninghame North, rejected the idea of a
hidden agenda and said he found the charge offensive as many supporters
of change had been at the forefront of the campaigns against privatising
Scottish water, the post office and the railways. He said ''We have to
have faith in our leaders if we are going to ask the country to have
faith in our leaders.''

In this moving plea for the developed world to reach out and help the
poor of Africa,
PIK BOTHA,
South Africa's Energy Minister, contrasts the spectacular success of
his own country with the tragedy unfolding elsewhere on the Continent.
But this is more than an emotional appeal. Botha has a strategy to
resolve Africa's problems
THE next century will see increasing economic and technological
competition. The Cold War was kept in check by the threat of nuclear
war. It was frightening, but at least everyone knew the rules.
We are now entering a new world with massive uncertainties. Humanity
will have to reformulate its purpose in the light of our expanding
knowledge of the nature of the universe.
But the greatest immediate challenge for all of us is the global
economic disparity. In 1991, the richest fifth of the world's people
enjoyed 84.7% of the world's gross national product; 84.2% of its trade;
85.5% of its domestic savings; and 85% of its domestic investment. By
contrast, the poorest fifth starved on 1.4% of the world's GNP; 0.9% of
world trade; 0.7% of its domestic savings; and 0.9% of its domestic
investment.
There is no way in which the richest one-fifth can escape this
indictment. It must surely shatter any complacency on our part as we
survey the present state of this planet. The United Nations World Summit
for Social Development met this week in Copenhagen to ''defuse the
social time bomb primed by world-wide poverty, injustice, and
unemployment''.
My continent, Africa, is particularly pertinent here. It is well
represented in the poorest fifth which shares so little of the earth's
bounty. It is a continent which stands on the sidelines watching as the
giant economic blocs compete for world trade and the wealth that
accompanies it.
The time has come when the successful nations must reach out directly
to the suffering millions of Africa.
World trade does not mean much to a person who is perpetually hungry.
How can there be domestic savings where babies are dying of
malnutrition? How can the GNP grow where the able young are defeated in
life because they wallow in an ignorance they cannot escape since they
have no chance to develop their skills? Who can engage in domestic
investment where a drink of water represents a cup of pollution and
disease?
Left to its own devices, there is increasingly little hope for the
middle belt of Africa stretching from Angola and Zaire to Ethiopia and
Somalia. Angola's infrastructure has been all but totally destroyed by
decades of civil war. Zaire will probably crumble into divergent pieces
after Mobutu goes. Nigeria is staggering under a load of political
instability. Rwanda and Burundi are giant refugee camps. Somalia and
Ethiopia are racked with malnutrition and illiteracy.
I say this with a sense of grief. But it points to the necessity of
waking up to the urgent need to ensure that South Africa remains a
success story. For South Africa is the locomotive of sub-Saharan Africa.
Newsweek reported this week that the US Commerce Department has
identified South Africa as one of ''10 developing economies having the
size and growth prospects to be prime sources of contracts for American
firms, particularly big-ticket infrastructure deals in transportation,
communications, and energy''. Without a successful South Africa,
sub-Saharan Africa will slide even further into anarchy and misery.
There is a way to reverse the trend. The economically developed
nations should join hands with South Africa to form a triangular
association with the struggling countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Names
are not that important, but let us call it the African Trilateral
Initiative. Is it just a dream that there could be a massive importation
of human endeavour from those countries where development is steaming
ahead along the high road to those shuffling along the low road? The
habits and practices of success need to be absorbed by social osmosis.
If all the successful people are in the Americas, Europe, and the Far
East while in Africa the people are locked in a primitive struggle to
survive, how is this osmosis to take place?
Africa is an empty page. Great stories can yet be written on it. The
continent needs a new beginning.
South Africa is the natural bridge for the process I am proposing. If
things go wrong in South Africa, there is even less hope for sub-Saharan
Africa. That is why South Africa must succeed, not only within itself,
but also in relation to its neighbours.
And South Africa has every chance of succeeding. It has a bright
future. Our gold and foreign reserves are increasing and stand at 12
billion rand (just over #2 billion); we are at the cutting edge of world
technological development -- with the additional advantage that our
technology is designed to work in Africa; we are world leaders in
reserves and production of most major minerals; 65% of our foreign
exchange is earned by minerals and mineral-based products -- we can
increase this by beneficiation.
Our Reconstruction and Development Programme has as its basic aim the
narrowing of the gap between the haves and the have-nots, the provision
of jobs, housing, electricity, medical services, training and education
by stimulating economic growth and by applying a firm and sound budget
and fiscal disciplinary policy. If we succeed with this, it could then
serve as a model for the rest of Africa as well as the industrialised
nations who are now gathered in Copenhagen at the UN World Summit for
Social Development.
South Africa has substantial infrastructural assets: airports,
seaports, its electricity grid, the banking system, communications,
transport, universities, mines. These substantive assets, these
formidable advantages, can be maximised for South Africa, sub-Saharan
Africa, and therefore for the rest of the world, if the African
Trilateral Initiative I am proposing receives serious and urgent
consideration by the industrialised democracies.
Do not misunderstand me. I am not trying to gain advantage for South
Africa by riding on the backs of the stuggling countries to the north.
On the contrary. I am saying that South Africa is willing to contribute
its African expertise, its African experience, its products and
processes developed in Africa, to a three-way partnership with the
developed world and the struggling countries south of the Sahara.
A clinical inventory of the current state of the region needs to be
taken. Schools, hospitals, and clinics, housing and the other
building-bricks of advancing societies should be quantified. Then the
planning can begin. Somalia has shown that peace and social
reconstruction cannot be imposed by the gun. The start will therefore
have to be made in selected countries where there is enough of a social
fabric to be able to support the actions required.
These measures will have to be based on sound economics. Development
will have to take place as the result of joint public and private-sector
activity. The international private sector, rather than governments
alone, should become major role players in this venture.
For example, a tremendous opportunity to produce electricity exists in
the Congo River rapids between Brazzaville and Kinshasa. It alone can
produce enough electricity for the whole of Africa without even building
a dam. Pipes conducting the water of the rapids though turbines will
suffice. From there a grid leading north and south could service Africa
and even provide electricity to Europe.
At the moment some countries in Africa derive up to 90% of their
energy from cutting and burning trees. Glasgow would not last long as a
functioning city on that basis! Plants use sunlight to manufacture food.
In addition to that they release oxygen, thereby counteracting
pollution. Trees and plants should therefore be increased rather than
cut down.
I hear of some of the UK's problems: the threat of a 50% tax rate; the
implications of a unified European currency; a collapsed bank;
reconstructing Central Europe; assisting the Russian Federation;
mediating in the Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy. You are engulfed in what
you perceive to be major problems -- but you have an abundance of food
and shelter and roads and hospitals and schools.
In Africa, millions have no income which can be taxed; and millions
have no income to buy food.
Many say that the problems of Africa are complex, insurmountable,
intractable, and many other ''ables''. But they are not problems of
complexity, rather they are problems of simplicity. The industrialised
countries simply refuse to realise or face the real state of affairs in
Africa.
This is all a formidable task. Yet South Africa has shown that
formidable obstacles can be overcome.
I consider the energy sector particularly well-placed to play an
outstanding role in an initiative of this kind. First, it can command
considerable capital for investment in exploration and subsequent
development where the nature and quantity of energy sources warrants it.
Secondly, as long as there is peace and the tax regimes are stable,
exploration for energy sources is not that dependent on a sophisticated
infrastructure or a developed society. Lonrho in Mozambique has shown
that even where there is political instability, companies can protect
themselves militarily while at the same time contributing to the
constructive restoration of a country.
Thirdly, Africa is a mineral-rich continent. Finally, the provision of
energy to struggling societies can have a magical effect on their
development as people become able to study and work and improve their
living conditions.
It would seem to me that the international oil industry has a
particular responsibility here.
Business and government of winning nations should, with South Africa
as local partner and springboard, enter into a contract with African
countries to develop their energy grids and socio-economic
infrastructures. Taxes for the economic activities undertaken in Africa
should be paid in the form of building schools, setting up factories,
constructing clinics, laying out farms, establishing offices,
constructing houses, laying down roads, effecting electrical
connections. Local small enterprise contractors must be used for this
work.
Two examples from South Africa convey the idea. The Government has its
aim to achieve half a million domestic electrical connections per year
for the next five years. This means a total of 2.5 million domestic
connections by the end of the century -- more than double the 2.1
million connections we have at present. Also, in its current Off-shore
Licensing Round, South Africa has asked for tenders to include proposals
for engineering bursaries at university. This is but one small way to
ensure that the human raw material which lies latent throughout Africa
is given an opportunity to realise its potential.
The African Trilateral Initiative is not a charitable venture, based
on grants and hand-outs. Poor countries already owe outside lenders 4.5
trillion US dollars in foreign debt, and what has it really achieved?
The African Trilateral Initiative is a venture which must be pragmatic,
profit-orientated, driven predominantly by the private rather than the
public sector.
The African Trilateral Initiative must also act on the premise that
the supply of energy to Africa is basic to its revival. Energy is the
key, energy is the lifeblood of any new era for Africa. Energy enables
people to work longer hours, to study to better themselves at night, to
power factories, shops, offices, clinics . . .
South Africa stands ready to take its part in such a venture. I
recently penned the following lines in a trans-continental aeroplane:
In five thousand million years
our sun will start dying
and all the planets will die
and all the music
and all the poetry
and all our longing for endlessness
will fly beyond the stars
and come to rest in the next universe.
And then I wondered whether there will come a time when every human
being will have one decent meal a day for the duration of the short
period that we live.
Moral conviction combined with a sense of realism will be the
qualities which all of us will need as we face the century ahead and
seek to provide at least that meal.
The nightmare of apartheid is over. We have entered a new era. We do
not have a road-map. We do not have a model. We are charting our way as
we move across unknown terrain.
Parties who were at war with one another now sit together in a cabinet
bound by a common loyalty to the country we love and share. We have
problems: a high crime rate; burdens of the past; violence; inadequate
housing, education, electrification, health services; unemployment;
poverty.
But we have the means to tackle our deficiencies and we have
demonstrated our will to do so. Our leaders have quality and integrity.
The world wishes us to succeed. Our people are determined to succeed.

TONY BLAIR referred to the exclusive story in The Herald yesterday on
the fears expressed by former Tory deputy Prime Minister Viscount
Whitelaw over rail privatisation and a possible threat to the west coast
main line.
Mr Blair said: ''Labour will fight tooth and nail the Government's
absurd and crazy plans to privatise the railways helped now, I see from
The Herald today, by Willie Whitelaw.''
He said the Prime Minister ''should listen to Willie.''
CALLS for the Labour Party to develop a comprehensive policy to help
rural areas were approved by the conference. Mr Kevin Hitchins
(Kincardine and Deeside) said the production of non-food items, the
creation of small-scale co-operatives should be encouraged along with
specialist housing developments.
DELEGATES from rural constituencies spoke against a blanket increase
in petrol prices to cut pollution. Mr Arthur Yates (Caithness and
Sutherland CLP) said it would hit areas like his hard for no
proportionate environmental gain.
THE conference condemned the Government's legislation on disabled
people as ''ill-defined and falling far short of what disabled people
want and deserve.'' It resolved that a Labour Government would legislate
''to outlaw all discrimination against disabled people.''

LORD Marnoch was judged by the wider world last night to have come to
roughly the right decision in a case he himself conceded was difficult
and unusual.
His view was shared by the Scottish Adoption Advice Service, which
said the whole question of mixed-race adoptions was both delicate and
controversial. A spokesman said: ''In this instance, we feel the best
interests of the children would be to keep them in the placement they
have. To remove them on the basis of race would be a drastic step.''
There were many potential pitfalls ahead, she added. ''However, if the
parents can go a long way to redress the balance by promoting Asian role
models and give a positive image of the culture outside the white
community, there is a good chance that this will work.''
Ms Philippa Morrall, co-ordinator of the Parent to Parent Information
on Adoption Services, said: ''The judge has to have made the right
decision. It is the best thing for the children to stay where they have
been if they possibly can.''
The Asian community, which in an ideal world advocates same-race
adoption, refused to condemn Lord Marnoch.
Mrs Bushra Iqbal, a community relations officer with Strathclyde, said
the whole subject was complicated and she would not be rushing to take
issue with the judge in this instance.
However, from the research she had carried out, the general feeling in
the Asian community was that children from minority backgrounds should
remain in those backgrounds if adopted.
She felt that black children adopted by white families would go
through an identity crisis later in life and face racism and
discrimination unprepared. ''As much effort should be made as possible
to match a child with people from his or her own background.''
Strathclyde Regional Council does not operate the same race policy
when it comes to adoption and found itself agreeing with the judge.
Mr Ian Gilmour, deputy director of social work, said: ''The judge got
it right. He has taken account of the care and bonding of the children
and prudently identified that they will need help to come to terms with
their culture. It is consistent with what we would do.''

<HEADLINE>Judge rules in favour of foster parents but attaches ethnic origins provisions Court upholds Scots couple's right to adopt Asian children</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BRUCE MCKAIN, LAW CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH couple have been allowed to adopt two young Asian children
on condition that they are brought up with an awareness of their ethnic
origins and traditions.
Lord Marnoch attached the special condition to the adoption order in
what he described as a difficult and unusual case, where adoption was
opposed by the natural parents.
The judge was dealing at the Court of Session with a petition by the
couple to adopt BS, a girl aged seven, and her six-year-old brother HS.
He was asked to dispense with the consent of the natural parents on the
ground that it was being withheld unreasonably.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, Lord Marnoch said that the S
family, who have six other children, had first come to the attention of
the social work authorities in Strathclyde in February 1988.
The two children had been taken into local authority care in 1988 and
had spent the last six years fostered by the couple who now wished to
adopt them.
It was accepted that they had looked after the children extremely
well, that the children were happy and contented, and looked upon the
Scottish couple as their parents.
Attempts at rehabilitation with the natural parents had caused
distress to the children and had eventually been abandoned. Counsel for
the natural parents accepted that there could be no further contact for
at least the next three or four years.
Lord Marnoch added: ''There is no doubt but that, over the last six
years, a deep bond of mutual love and affection has developed between
the couple and the two children.''
He referred to evidence by an expert witness consulted on behalf of
the natural parents, who expressed reservations about the wisdom of
adoption.
This was because of the difference in race between the adoptive
parents and the children and the importance of the children keeping in
touch with their ethnic roots.
The judge said: ''The nub of it was that, without such an awareness,
the sense of personal identity was incomplete and that this, in turn,
could result in severe emotional disturbance at the stage of adolescence
and in a much reduced ability to deal with racial prejudice if and when
encountered in later life.''
Counsel for the natural parents argued that the risk of the ethnic
link being inadequately cultivated was so great that adoption was going
too far and only custody orders should be made.
Lord Marnoch said the Scottish couple's record in this regard was a
good one. As early as December 1990, the social work department recorded
the couple's concern that the children should be made aware of their
cultural and religious backgrounds.
They had attended a course in Strathclyde entitled Working in a
Multi-cultural City, bought jigsaws and books about Indian children, as
well as a sari for BS and Indian trousers and top for HS. They had taken
the children to see an Indian Festival.
They had also contacted Asian Concern and had been put in touch with
someone who was prepared to teach the children Punjabi and give them an
increasing awareness of their cultural heritage.
Lord Marnoch said: ''I am entirely satisfied that they, of all people,
have been fully aware of the need to keep the children in touch with
their ethnic culture and origins and that they have done everything
within their power to secure that end.''
He also took account of the evidence of a child psychiatrist who said
that after all that had befallen the children, the one thing they needed
above all was an end to the uncertainty through the permanence and
security of adoption.
The judge said he well understood that even the most reasonable of
parents would have to wrestle long and hard with their emotions before
agreeing to the adoption of their child.
However, this was a case in which, if the natural parents ever saw
their children again, it would only be at the initiative of the children
as they grew up and matured.
''In all these circumstances, it seems to me that there is all the
less reason now to deny to these children the security of adoption
within the home where they have been happy and well cared for during the
last six years.''
He made adoption orders for both children with the condition that the
couple used their best endeavours to secure that the children would be
made aware of their identity and brought up with an understanding of
their own ethnic origins and traditions.
The couple will also have to co-operate in the compiling of a biennial
report to the court, to be supplied by the British Agencies for Adoption
and Fostering.

THE producers of The Big Picnic, the First World War epic drama staged
in a converted Govan shipyard shed last year, yesterday offered their
creditors only half of what they are owed in a bid to secure the venue's
long-term future.
More than a hundred creditors are still owed money from the production
company Promenade, which yesterday announced that the losses sustained
by the huge production totalled #400,000. The creditors were offered 50p
in the pound by post yesterday in full and final settlement of their
claims.
Producer Nicholas Newton said yesterday the company had secured
backing of #200,000 from Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde region, and
the European Regional Development Fund and was appealing to the
creditors to accept the deal on offer.
The Herald revealed earlier this year that a number of the supporting
cast, mostly students from Glasgow's Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama, had not received payment four months after the curtain fell on
the last performance of The Big Picnic in November.
Last night, Mr Newton insisted that all acting and backstage personnel
had now been paid in full.
However, more than 100 companies involved in supplying equipment and
carrying out alterations to the former Harland and Wolff yard have still
not been paid.
He blamed the #400,000 deficit on the high cost of upgrading the shed,
but this was now a usable asset for future productions.
He also blamed disappointing early attendances and ''stringent safety
measures'' ordered for the production, whose opening was delayed twice.
The safety measures alone, he said, had cost the company more than
#100,000.
''The costs were too much for one production to bear,'' Mr Newton
said.
He dangled the carrot of further work with the company as an incentive
for suppliers and contractors to accept the deal, insisting that failure
to do so would ''seriously jeopardise'' a theatre complex for the
future.
Promenade's plans to establish the ''big shed'' permanently would cost
#558,000 and would enable the facility to be used for concerts, epic
drama, and film production.

THE two men who led the successful revival of Ferguson Shipbuilders at
Port Glasgow were last night vying with each other to win future control
of the yard.
Sir Ross Belch, chairman of the Lower Clyde yard's holding company,
Ferguson Marine, has proposed that it be taken over by Altnacraig
Shipping, a firm of which he is also chairman.
His move has prompted a counter-proposal by Ferguson's chief
executive, Mr Bill Scott, who has lodged plans for a management buy-out,
fronted by him and three other senior staff.
The contest for control has emerged during the most successful period
in the yard's modern history. Earlier this year, it announced a new
#12.5m contract for a sophisticated North Sea platform supply vessel,
which took Ferguson's orders to more than #100m since it was privatised
in 1989.
Sir Ross, 74, the former managing director of Scott Lithgow, and Mr
Scott yesterday declined to discuss their proposals, saying they were
constrained by the rules of the Takeovers and Mergers Panel.
However, Mr Oliver Baker, a director of London merchant bank Henry
Ansbacher, confirmed that discussions were being held between Altnacraig
and Ferguson Marine. He said a proposal had been made but no formal bid
had yet been put to the board of Ferguson.
Sir Ross's move may benefit from the fact that a large number of
shareholders in Altnacraig also control shares in Ferguson.
One of the biggest in Altnacraig is Norwegian shipping company
Jebsens, which may be attracted by the prospect of gaining increased
control of a yard which has achieved a reputation for winning contracts
and delivering its ships on schedule.
Mr Ian Colville, the union convener at Ferguson, last night suggested
that Jebsens might want to take advantage of the lower labour costs in
the UK to build some of its ships.
He said staff had not been given any details of the two bids but that
the general feeling appeared to favour control being retained by the
present management team.
Sir Ross and Mr Scott have both been deeply involved in Ferguson's
regeneration. In 1989, under British Shipbuilders, it was down to a
skeleton staff until it was sold to the management team of the
neighbouring marine engine company Clark Kincaid, including Mr Scott.
They then sold a 75% share in the yard to Kvaerner, which in turn sold
it to Ferguson Marine, founded by Sir Ross, for the nominal sum of
#225,000 in 1991.
Both Altnacraig and Ferguson were launched through the Government's
business expansion schemes, which give large tax advantages to
investors.

Karachi, Friday
A BOMB blast outside a Shi'ite Muslim mosque in Karachi killed 12
people, including five children, and wounded 26 after midday prayers
today, hospital sources said.
Three people were later killed in gunfire which erupted in the Malir
district of the southern Pakistani city after angry Shi'ite youths took
to the streets in protest.
The explosion hurled shrapnel and shards of glass into worshippers as
they emerged from the Hussaini Imambargah (prayer hall) in the
religiously mixed eastern district.
Police said they believed the bomb had been planted in a car parked
near the mosque, but investigations were still under way.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The blast, which took this year's death toll from violence in
Pakistan's biggest city to more than 300, followed a series of revenge
attacks by militant Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim groups.
Witnesses said green-turbaned Sunni activists from a neighbouring
mosque were among the first to come to the rescue of the Shi'ite bomb
victims. Appeals for blood donations were broadcast from the loudspeaker
of the Sunni mosque.
The dead included a two-year-old boy, a 12-year-old girl and three
boys aged between eight and 12. Several of the wounded were in critical
condition, the hospital sources said.
Angry Shi'ite youngsters prevented police and paramilitary rangers
from reaching the scene of the blast, which occurred shortly after
Friday prayers.
The explosion wrecked at least three cars and two motorcycles. A pool
of blood stained the pavement outside the white mosque from which black
Shi'ite pennants fluttered.
''Why can't the government protect us?'' yelled a crowd of enraged
young Shi'ites about 100 yards from the mosque. ''Why don't they let us
protect ourselves?''
The demonstrators kept police away. ''You always come too late. What's
the use of coming now?'' they shouted.
Police stood by amid chaotic scenes at the Jinnah hospital as Shi'ite
party workers ferried casualties into the emergency room, grieving
relatives wailed and protesters shouted.
Sectarian violence has been on the rise in recent months in Karachi,
already wracked by ethnic and political conflicts.
Gunmen shot dead 20 Shi'ite worshippers in attacks on two Karachi
mosques on February 25. A leading figure in the militant Shi'ite
Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) group was assassinated in Lahore, the
Punjab provincial capital, on Tuesday.
Two American consulate officials were killed and one was wounded in an
ambush by unidentified gunmen as they travelled to work in Karachi on
Wednesday.
This month alone, 76 people have been killed, including the Americans,
in violence that has terrorised the city's 12 million residents and
defied law enforcement efforts.
Businessmen fear that Karachi's worsening reputation for chaos and
bloodshed will spoil Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's efforts to attract
much-needed foreign private investment.
Muneer Hussain Gillani, head of the TJP's political wing, said he was
shocked by the latest attack on his community.
''These non-stop incidents in mosques and Imambargahs amount to
efforts to spread the sectarian fire . . . to every corner,'' he told
Reuters by telephone from TJP headquarters in Lahore.

MINERS' leader Arthur Scargill yesterday marked the 10th anniversary
of the ending of the 1984-85 strike with a visit to Scotland and told
former pit workers and their wives that throughout the year-long dispute
the miners had all along told the truth.
The president of the NUM told a social evening at Mayfield, Dalkeith,
organised by Lothian Miners' Organisation, that most people now agreed
the miners had been absolutely right. ''I'm now told that had we got
more public support the country would not be in the mess it is in today.
That's the message I get from the south of England, Wales, and
Scotland.''.
The result was that Britain was now having to spend more money on
nuclear fuel and gas than it would have paid by sticking to coal for its
power, he said.
Mr Mick McGahey, the retired vice-president and former leader of the
Scottish area of the NUM, said that, 10 years after the end of the
strike, the industry was now back in the hands of privateers, the same
people who in 1947 left Britain with the worst mining industry in the
whole of Europe.
He said: ''It was the miners who rebuilt the industry, capitalised the
industry and, with the help of new technology, built it up only for it
to land back in the hands of the privateers.''
Before the strike, Lothian had two super pits, Bilston Glen, Loanhead,
and Monktonhall. Bilston was gradually run down after the dispute.
Monktonhall was reopened with a miners' buy-out three years ago and is
now in private hands.

<HEADLINE>Dail backs Bill on abortion</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BILL to make information about abortion services in Britain and
elsewhere available in the Irish Republic has been approved, without a
vote, by the Dail, the Irish Parliament.
It will now be considered early next week by the upper house of the
Irish legislature, the Senate.
But as the proposed law completed its progress, fighting continued
between Cabinet Ministers in Dublin and leaders of Ireland's Roman
Catholics.
Archbishop of Dublin, Desmond Connell, rejected claims by Health
Minister Michael Noonan that the church had been given inaccurate legal
advice on the Bill.
Earlier this week, the archbishop and other members of the Irish
Catholic hierarchy stated their concern at the proposed new law.
Mr Noonan had accused some opponents of the Bill of using intimidatory
tactics.
The Irish Government insists the Bill is in line with a referendum
decision on the abortion information issue three years ago, and says it
could reduce the number of Irish women who go to Britain for abortions
each year -- 4500 at the last count.
Opponents of the measure claim it amounts to abortion through the
backdoor.
It is thought that the Irish Supreme Court -- the country's final
legal authority -- will be asked, by President Mary Robinson, to test
the constitutionality of the Bill after it has passed through Senate.

Lagos, Friday
AFTER days of speculation about coups, Nigeria's military government
today announced it had foiled a plot by officers and civilians to topple
General Sani Abacha and that 29 people had been arrested.
''From the interim reports which I have received, I am now in a
position to confirm that some military officers and civilians had ganged
up to organise a coup d'etat against the federal military government,''
Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar, the chief of defence staff, told a
news conference.
''It has been established too that these officers and civilians had
the intention to disturb the peace of the nation on Wednesday, 1 March,
1995,'' Abubakar added.
Hours after the announcement, Abacha called off a trip to Copenhagen
to attend the United Nations social summit, officials said.
''The head of state is not going,'' one official at Aso Rock, the seat
of the government in Abuja, told Reuters. ''The minister of finance
Anthony Ani has travelled to represent him.''
Abubakar news conference followed days of anxiety in Nigeria since
local magazines reported on Monday that a plot to topple Abacha had been
uncovered and at least 150 people arrested.
''The vigilance of loyal officers and soldiers in conjunction with
military intelligence operatives made it possible to foil this
irresponsible action of over-ambitious and misguided officers and
civilians,'' Abubakar said.
''So far, 29 officers and civilians have been arrested,'' he said, but
declined to name them, adding that the investigations were continuing.
''It will be premature and prejudicial to justice to mention names at
this stage because of the damage that can be done to the psyche of those
who may be cleared in the long run,'' he added.
Nigerian newspapers have published names of people they said were
arrested in connection with the coup.
Many are known to be close to retired General Ibrahim Babangida, the
man who plunged Nigeria into crisis from June 1993 when he annulled the
presidential election widely believed to have been won by business
magnate Moshood Abiola.
Among them is Brigadier-General Lawan Gwadabe, 46, a former state
governor who also served briefly as the chief of staff for the Gambian
army during which time young officers in that country overthrew elected
president Dawda Jawara.
Abiola is in detention awaiting trial for treason for proclaiming
himself president in defiance of the military rulers.
Last summer, Abacha's government crushed a campaign of strikes and
riots aimed at forcing him to cede power to Abiola in order to restore
democracy.
Abacha said that civil rule would be restored only through a
constitutional conference.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>EU warns Canada over fishing boat seized in 'act of piracy'</HEADLINE>

NORMALLY peace-loving Canadians were accused of piracy on the high
seas by the European Union today as a new halibut war loomed in the
North Atlantic.
Four warning shots were fired over the bow of a Spanish factory ship
which was seized by a Canadian gunboat and towards Newfoundland from
international waters.
In retaliation, the EU promptly threatened trade sanctions against
Canada while Spain dispatched a naval vessel to protect other Iberian
ships in the area.
But in the background to this flare-up there is deep unease felt by
several fishing nations in the EU at the extent to which the Spanish,
with an appalling record of rule-breaking, are continuing to pursue
dwindling stocks.
In recent times, boats from the vast, 1500-strong Spanish fishing
armada have been involved in clashes with French and British boats.
A series of fresh engagements in British fishing grounds is threatened
now that some Spanish boats are to be given access to UK waters off the
west coast under the EU's controversially reformed Common Fisheries
Policy.
Criticising the policy, Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin,
speaking on BBC radio, claimed the Canadian action had been necessary.
''Some 340,000 tons of fish, seven or eight species, have disappeared
from the planet because this fleet, unrestrained and uncontrolled by the
European Union, has fished away one species after another,'' he said.
In Brussels, furious EU officials condemned the Canadians, claiming
the seizure of the fishing boat Estai was carried out ''in flagrant
violation of the law of the sea.''
The halibut war follows a long-running wrangle between the EU and
Canada over Greenland halibut stocks. Most recently the Canadians
snubbed Commission president Jacques Santer after he invited a
delegation to Brussels for talks.
The EU and Canada have been involved in negotiations for sharing
fishing quotas in international waters regulated by the North-West
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (Nafo). The terms agreed requires the EU
to cut its haul from 44,000 tonnes of Greenland halibut last year to
27,000 tonnes this year.
The Commission claimed today that Canada had unfairly forced a
revision of this share-out and disregarded recent EU fishing patterns
which, it held, are the usual basis for international fishing
allocations.
''Under this cloak of conservation, Canada has taken an unacceptably
and unjustifiably high share of the total for itself,'' the Commission
argued.
''Faced with this illegal interference with its legitimate right to
fish in international waters, the EU will not stand still,'' it warned,
but adding in the same breath: ''The EU does not want this situation to
escalate.''
The statement added: ''If Canada fails to show due restraint in its
actions and continues to demonstrate lack of respect for its
international commitments, the EU will be obliged to consider further
action to defend its legitimate rights.''
This angry response was dictated by EU ambassadors meeting in
emergency session to consider retaliatory action by next week.
''We do not exclude any measure,'' a Commission spokesman warned. The
EU later said it had blocked a scientific cooperation agreement with
Canada which was due for approval by EU research ministers today.
Mr Jacques Roy, Canadian ambassador to the EU, criticised the move,
saying: ''It's disappointing that the EU has taken measures which have
nothing to do with fishing.''
He said Canada was prepared to negotiate but only on condition that
fishing stopped in the disputed zone meantime.
No-one was reported injured in the shooting incident which came
shortly before an armed boarding party arrested the ship's master and
towed the Estai towards Newfoundland -- a move condemned immediately by
the EU as ''piracy.''

A NURSING home whose alleged ''appalling'' standards of care were
featured in a television documentary met all the registration
requirements during its last formal inspection by Lanarkshire Health
Board and was yesterday described by the board as a ''pleasant and
homely'' place.
The general manager of the board, Professor Frank Clark, said Orchard
House Nursing Home, in Crossford, Lanarkshire, satisfied all conditions
relating to matters such as the physical character of the home and
staffing numbers and skills.
His comments came as BBC Scotland, which made the Frontline Scotland
documentary, admitted that some film shots in the programme which
purported to illustrate scenes at Orchard House were not filmed there.
A spokeswoman for the BBC said: ''These were regarded as background
shots which were not directly related to the programme's main
allegations.''
Solicitors acting for the owners of the home, Raymond and Margaret
Baigent, have been instructed to raise an action of defamation at the
Court of Session and are to decide on Monday against which parties
proceedings will be raised.
Mrs Baigent said yesterday that managers and staff at the home had
been disgusted by the programme and claimed that ''former employees with
a gripe'' had used it to conspire against her and her husband.
She added that some film shots in the documentary, such as those
purporting to illustrate the filling of a bath for a resident at 5.30am,
residents walking along corridors with walking frames, and the
programme's reporter standing at the entrance to the home, were not
filmed at the home.
Speaking after a visit to the home following the programme on Thursday
night, Professor Clark said he regarded Orchard House as ''a pleasant
place with a homely atmosphere'' and said some residents he had spoken
to were surprised and angered by the allegations made in the programme.
The board has, however, stated that it regards the allegations about
the operation of the home and the care of residents as ''disturbing and
serious'' and is to investigate them thoroughly as part of an inquiry it
launched three months ago after former members of staff made complaints
about management at an industrial tribunal.
Professor Clark said later: ''The last formal inspection of the home
in mid-November looked at the conditions regarding the physical
character of the home, staffing numbers and skills, the storage and
control of medicines, and in all respects the home met the registration
requirements.''
Commenting on his visit to the home yesterday, he said: ''I found
residents quite upset about the programme and anxious to reassure me
that life there was not as it was portrayed in the programme.''
''The residents I spoke to, some of whom have been there for a
considerable time, were surprised, upset, and angry.''

SOCIAL clubs in Perth and Kinross district have been warned they will
be breaking the law if they serve their members with a tipple, as their
drink permits have lapsed.
Perth Sheriff Clerk Bill Jones yesterday confirmed: ''Examination of
the register of clubs disclosed that 25 have not renewed their
three-year certificate.
''Responsibility for re-registering lies with the clubs and I have
written to the secretaries concerned telling them they must apply for a
fresh grant, which will normally take four to five weeks to issue.
''I have also reminded them that, under the Licensing Act,
unregistered clubs cannot sell or supply alcoholic liquor.''
One of those to be hit by the ban is the St Johnstone FC Supporters
Social Club, which has several hundred members at its premises in the
centre of Perth.
A Tayside police spokesman said: ''We trust what has happened has
simply been an oversight. We are now advising clubs to stop serving
alcohol and to apply for new certificates.''

CHARLES Pasqua, Minister of the Interior, said it: in 40 years of
political life this is the ''most disgusting'' election campaign he has
ever seen.
For once, Pasqua, a close ally of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,
candidate for the presidential election, is on the receiving end. And
the Minister of the Interior who 20 years ago ran the SAC, the outlawed
para-military organisation which protected Gaullist interests, knows a
lot about how disgusting politics can be.
One of Pasqua's political friends, MP Didier Schuller, at the heart of
a corruption scandal, is still on the run in Switzerland with his
girlfriend and thought to be on the point of fleeing to South America.
Pierre Suard, the boss of the huge firm Alcatel and a true Gaullist,
was up before an instructing magistrate this week on -- yet again --
corruption charges. But most important of all, Balladur's chances of
becoming president are shrinking even further after revelations about
the colossal sums he earned while working in private industry.
Bedroom scandals may topple Tories but here -- where sex is pleasure,
not a sin, and where a man's private life is still his own -- money is
what counts.
President Giscard d'Estaing's popularity tumbled before the 1981
election because of press reports about diamonds he had received from
the self-anointed and cannibalistic Emperor Bokassa.
In truth, the stones were worth very little, but President Giscard
d'Estaing, too proud to come clean about them, paid dearly in electoral
terms.
In 1974, the Gaullist candidate Jacques Chaban-Delmas was reported in
the press to have paid no income tax. He had done so perfectly legally,
thanks to smart accountancy, but tax-paying voters did not like it.
Balladur is now in the same boat. Le Canard Enchaine, the same paper
that published Chaban-Delmas's tax return and revealed the diamond
affair, last week published fresh accusations that Balladur earned, at
the very least, #900,000 between 1991 and 1993 with GSI -- a firm of
which he was managing director from 1977--1986 and adviser from
1988--1993.
Between 1991--1993, he was already earning nearly #100,000 a year as
MP and city councillor for Paris.
Why GSI paid him such huge sums is not clear. It is apparent, however,
that the prime minister made a lot of money from trading GSI shares and
blindingly obvious that he is committing a Giscard d'Estaing-like
blunder by refusing to answer questions on the subject.
Reports on the GSI affair, doubtless put into circulation by friends
of Jacques Chirac, Balladur's arch rival in the election, have been
going the rounds for several weeks.
Balladur has huffed and puffed and draped himself in his dignity.
Presumably because he knows that even if the renumeration was perfectly
legal on paper, the electorate of a country with officially 3[1/2]
million out of work and an alarming number of poor, hates the idea of
those in power filling their own pockets. Especially when they have
treated everyone else to austerity programmes of various sorts.
Many people this weekend are predicting that Balladur already has lost
the election. For while he is obviously an ideal candidate for
right-wing, middle class voters, a surprising opinion poll this weekend
shows that he also appeals to a proportion of people right at the bottom
of the income ladder -- voters who will now increasingly be attracted by
Chirac's populist, tub-thumping campaign.
A number of prosperous rats already are leaving Balladur's leaky boat
-- or, at least, hopping aboard that of the increasingly buoyant Chirac.
Pierre Berge, former boss and boyfriend of fashion designer Yves Saint
Laurent and one of President Mitterrand's closest friends, announced
last week that Chirac was the man for him. So did a number of more or
less well-known intellectual figures.
It was nothing that can compare with the opposing camps of writers and
artists that used to line up when presidential elections were a question
of right versus left, but they nevertheless constitute an influential
group.
Politicans outside the Gaullist RPR party also have pledged
allegiance. Last week, 22 MPs from the centre-right UDF parliamentary
group came out in favour of Chirac, after both their prospective
candidates, former Prime Minister Raymond Barre and former President
Giscard d'Estaing, decided not to stand in the election.
The UDF men have an eye to the main chance. Most members of the
government are behind Balladur and Chirac, who feels betrayed, said
recently he had learned ''the meaning of resentment''. With him as
president, there will be jobs to be filled.

* A German who killed his 81-year-old homosexual lover and chopped his
body into pieces was jailed for life by a Munich court today.
Georg Hasselberg, 33, originally told police he murdered the older man
and ate his internal organs, but he later withdrew the grisly
confession.
However, the court rejected his subsequent claim that his victim had
died of natural causes. It ruled he had smothered him with a pillow out
of deep-seated hatred, taken his money and sliced up the corpse.
Hasselberg said he had only wanted to dispose of his lover's body
after he died in January 1993.--AP/Reuter.

Oslo, Friday
A BRITON convicted of killing a gay Norwegian former doctor by
stabbing him at least 20 times was jailed for 14 years today by an Oslo
court.
Christopher Kirby, 32, was found guilty yesterday of murdering Dr Tage
Ansethmoen at his home in November 1991.
Kirby admitted that he and another Briton had been at the doctor's
apartment, but denied the killing.
Today, Oslo Superior Court followed the prosecution's recommendation
of a 14-year jail term, less than the 21-year maximum allowed in Norway.
Police originally concentrated their search for the killer on Oslo's
gay community, where Ansethmoen was well known. A tip later led them to
suspect Kirby, who was arrested in India and handed over to Norway last
summer.
During the four-day trial, Kirby, of Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, said
he and a friend met the doctor on the street after an evening out. He
was extremely drunk and they agreed to help him get home.
Kirby claimed in court that the doctor attacked him and said that
images of a knife were in his mind, although he could not recall
stabbing anyone.

A PENSIONER shot dead five people in a court yesterday, after losing a
legal battle with a neighbour.
The 64-year-old man then committed suicide after fleeing from the
building.
Two judges, a lawyer, and two court clerks were killed and at least
five other people were wounded when the man began shooting in the
courthouse in the Austrian city of Linz.
Police said the man had been attending the hearing of a libel case
involving a neighbour. When the court ruled against him, he began firing
wildly.
He ran into the corridor, where he fired several more shots, and then
drove off in his car to a house outside the city, where he shot himself.
Neighbours said the man had been involved in previous disputes with
them. He was known for his volatile nature and his passion for firearms.

Tunis, Friday
A CAR bomb exploded in a suburb of Algiers today wounding at least 60
people and causing heavy damage.
Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi told state-run radio that most of
the 60 were policemen's families, women and children. The official news
agency APS said later the total of wounded had risen to 63.
The bomb, in the Muslim fundamentalist bastion of Kouba on the heights
of the Algerian capital, was the second in less than six weeks. The
previous bomb killed at least 42 people and wounded nearly 300.
Sifi denounced what he termed these ''criminal acts which target the
people and basic cell of society.'' He said all the wounded except four
had left hospital.
No-one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. The January
bombing in central Algiers was claimed by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA)
which is fighting to overthrow the army- backed government.
Earlier today, the international newspaper al-Hayat reported that the
GIA had threatened to start revenge killings of women in the police and
other security forces.--Reuter.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday weathered the storm of a thunderous
debate on political principles by his Scottish activists to emerge
victorious in his campaign to rewrite Clause 4 and modernise the party's
constitution.
In spite of some nervous moments during the day, victory was
ultimately more comfortable than had been predicted. The motion calling
for retention of Clause 4 in its original wording, dating back to 1918,
and for any change to be limited to additions was defeated by 56% to
44%.
A composite motion calling for a redraft -- albeit with strong
left-wing adherence to traditional principles -- was passed by 58% to
42%, and Mr Blair had crossed another awkward hurdle in his race towards
modernisation.
Leaving the conference to fly back to London, Mr Blair said: ''This is
a result which helps us create a modern Labour Party for the
twenty-first century. It shows the country that the Labour Party is now
speaking their language and is a party they can trust in government.''
In his speech, he almost offered an alternative form of words for the
disputed clause. This offered a vision of ''a Britain where individuals
flourish in a community where mutual rights and responsibilities are
recognised, where power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the
many and not the few, where poverty and prejudice are overcome, and
where we act together to realise the full potential of all''.
A more sour note came from MP George Galloway, who had argued
fervently for the conference not to buy ''a pig in a poke'' of an as yet
unseen replacement clause.
He said afterwards: ''I thought it would be much closer than it turned
out. It was very disappointing. It's an old fashioned kind of victory --
a few smoke-filled rooms, a few arms twisted, a few block votes cast,
not very new Labour really.''
He added: ''On the basis of this form, Mr Blair will almost certainly
get his way at the special conference on April 29. Perhaps when we see
the words Mr Blair is formulating (instead of Clause 4), some people
will be disappointed at the way they voted today.''
However, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said he was
delighted by the outcome and called it a vindication of the campaign for
change: ''It's a huge vote of support for Tony Blair's powerful speech
this afternoon.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the vote was not a vote for change --
''it is a vote that changes nothing''. He said: ''Tony Blair may have
won the vote on Clause 4 but he has singularly failed to achieve his
goal in seeking to rewrite it.''
He added that ''still to emerge is the real price that Tony Blair has
had to pay to secure the trades union backing that delivered the victory
today and that will do so again in April''.
SNP leader Alex Salmond declared: ''Tony Blair has bludgeoned his
party into submission. If he is willing to tear up his party's
constitution and reverse every spending commitment made at the last
General Election how can he be trusted to deliver on Labour's
commitments to Scotland?''
After securing the support of the Scottish executive the previous
evening, the mood in the Labour leadership had been bullish yesterday
but they got the kind of start to the day they could have done without.
By describing their preferred composite motion on Clause 4 as
''embracing'' amendments to a motion that had been withdrawn, they faced
an immediate challenge.
Ayrshire transport union delegate Jackson Cullinane insisted this be
put to a vote. The leadership promptly lost 60:40 in a rebellion from
the floor.
As one MP put it: ''Other parties start the day with the National
Anthem, we always start with a procedural wrangle.''
However, as the proceedings unfolded, the platform found its touch
again.

Copenhagen, Friday
DELEGATES to the United Nations social summit today agreed a plan to
end poverty and social injustice -- and at once warned results would not
come quickly or easily.
Summit chairman Juan Somavia said the draft resolution over which
governments have argued day and night for the past week was ''basically
finished''.
He said the declaration of war on poverty, to be adopted by world
leaders, was a radical departure from previous approaches to the
problem.
''I truly believe this is a historic commitment, said Somavia, Chile's
UN ambassador. ''We have been talking about tinkering with poverty; what
we are saying here is that poverty should not exist.''
The first of some 120 world leaders were already in the summit city,
Copenhagen, tonight as Somavia announced there was finally an agreement
for them to approve.
Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng and Presidents Nelson Mandela of South
Africa, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Kim Young Sam of South Korea and Alberto
Fujimori of Peru were among those in the Danish capital.
But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Nigeria's military ruler
General Sani Abacha, the target of a coup plot earlier this month,
cancelled plans to attend.
Mandela, who toured the summit press centre, said: ''I expect us to go
into the problems that worry the world: hunger, poverty, which undermine
the effort of the international community to better the lives of human
beings.''
The Copenhagen conference, billed as history's biggest gathering of
world leaders, seeks to wipe out poverty, slash unemployment and tackle
social inequalities, a string of aims that critics say are overly
ambitious and too broad.
The nearly 90-page resolution to be approved by the world leaders will
not be legally binding.
Those who wrote it insist the summit can make the world a better
place, but warn that results will not be immediate or even
obvious.--Reuter.

Washington, Friday
JOHN Schmitz, 24, had a secret admirer, someone infatuated by his
youthful good-looks. He was flattered to be told the news by the Jenny
Jones television show.
The show flew him to Chicago to meet his unknown fan. The studio
audience was gathered for the taping on Monday.
Schmitz was filled with pleasurable expectation, though a little
embarrassed, when his secret admirer walked on. He was Scott Amedure, a
32-year-old homosexual who had met Schmitz a fortnight earlier.
Schmitz was overwhelmed. He did not protest. The show ran its course
-- it was devoted to gays who have secret crushes on other men.
Afterwards, the two men went their separate ways home to Michigan, and
on Thursday Schmitz went around to Amedure's house, and shot him.
He then surrendered to police. He told them he had found an anonymous
note at home, which he guessed was from his secret admirer. So he went
out and bought a shotgun.
A neighbour said that Amedure was infatuated with talk shows.
The show said today that the segment would not be broadcast.

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIA'S volatile State Duma lower house of parliament today dismissed
outspoken human rights commissioner Sergei Kovalyov and passed
no-confidence motions in two powerful allies of President Boris Yeltsin.
The Duma overwhelmingly passed a resolution effectively sacking
Kovalyov, a former Soviet dissident and fierce opponent of the Kremlin's
bloody Chechnya campaign, after conservative deputies accused him of
bias and of overstepping his mandate.
''Sergei Kovalyov can have no responsibility for human rights. He
wants to bring foreign troops to Russia,'' said ultra-nationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, referring to Kovalyov's calls for international
monitors to be sent to Chechnya.
The Duma also passed non-binding votes of no-confidence in Interior
Minister Viktor Yerin and acting prosecutor-general Alexei Ilyushenko,
blamed for not halting a rise in crime.
The Duma, dominated by nationalist and right-wing deputies, was
elected in late 1993 but its powers are limited by the constitution,
which gives the president sweeping authority.

NORTHERN Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday made clear the
Government's anger over President Clinton's decision to allow Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams to undertake a fund-raising visit to the United
States.
As Unionist leaders vowed to boycott a White House St Patrick's Day
reception to which Mr Adams has been invited, Sir Patrick said the
American Government had made ''a mistake''.
''The Americans have a very genuine interest in doing all they can to
help peace become permanent. They have made a mistake in changing their
position with nothing being delivered in return,'' he told BBC radio.
Although he stopped short of claiming double standards, he compared
the decision on Sinn Fein with the US request for an international fight
against terrorism following the murder this week of two American
diplomats in Pakistan.
Unionists condemned Mr Clinton for an ''obcene'' decision, which they
claim will give Sinn Fein undeserved publicity. Mr Adams is expected to
meet the President for the first time at the White House reception next
Friday.
As the split between Downing Street and the White House worsened
yesterday, Government sources criticised the US for refusing to take
British advice not to give Mr Adams a chance to raise funds for
political activities.
A Government source said: ''The Americans are not unaware of our
views, which have been put across at a variety of levels.''
The decision is taken as a deliberate slight, as it follows, by a
matter of days, Sir Patrick' visit to Washington, during which he told
the Clinton administration the IRA remained active and there was no
guarantee that political funds would not be diverted into terrorist
activities.
Instead, the US has chosen to accept at face value a statement issue
by Mr Adams -- dismissed by Downing Street as ''ambiguous and
convoluted'' -- in which he offered to negotiate on decommissioning
weapons.
The split was confirmed by Mrs Jean Kennedy-Smith, the US ambassador
to Dublin. ''It is an American decision after all and the President of
the United States has to make that decision to the best of his ability.
''The President felt there was no reason to prohibit him any longer
from raising funds and that his party should be treated as any other
party would be. Sinn Fein can raise funds in Britain so it did not seem
really appropriate that the United States should not let them raise
funds there as well.''
It became clear last night that Mr Adams would have two meetings with
Mr Clinton in Washington.
Ahead of the White House engagement, on St Patrick's Day, March 17,
the Sinn Fein boss has now been asked to attend a lunch being given the
previous day by US House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Meanwhile, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton called on Mr Adams to use
his influence to persuade the IRA to begin decommissioning its arms.
Speaking in Dublin, he said Mr Adams ''clearly has influence over the
IRA and should use it. I don't agree he would be laughed out of court;
he should not be''.
On the controversy between the US and Britain, Mr Bruton said he did
not see a difficulty. ''It has been our view all along that Sinn Fein
are permitted to fund-raise in the United Kingdom, for example, and
here. And we could not see any particular reason why there should be a
problem about fund-raising in the United States.''
However, Tory MP Andrew Hunter, chairman of the party's back-bench
Northern Ireland committee, said the Americans had miscalculated. ''In
the House of Commons, there is not just a mood of indignation, it is
much stronger. It is anger and outrage that the Americans have allowed
this to happen.''

GRANT payments for local councils would be under threat from a new
Scottish parliament, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang claimed yesterday.
No-one in local government should be under any illusion that there
would be more resources for local services, he warned Cosla's annual
conference in Dunblane. Tightening of expenditure would be more likely
than any relaxation.
Mr Malcolm Rikind, MP for Edinburgh Pentlands, reinforced the message
when addressing Tory supporters in the capital.
He said: ''If on top of Edinburgh having the highest local tax in
Scotland, if we were to end up as a result of a Labour Government with a
Scottish income tax on top of the income tax we would all continue to
pay to the UK Government, then if there was no similar tax being paid by
our fellow citizens in Wales or England, what that does for inward
investment, for job creation, for prosperity in our city and elsewhere
in Scotland is a pretty grim thought.''
At Dunblane, Mr Lang reminded delegates that spending per head by
Scottish councils was 33% higher than that of local authorities in
England. Levels of Government support for council spending were 44%
higher in Scotland.
''How secure would that be as a new Scottish parliament sought to
embark on expensive new ambitions of its own?'' he asked.
Speaking later, he said Labour's plan to allow the parliament to
increase tax by up to 3p in the pound would raise only #450m, which was
2% of the total spending in the Scottish block.
Turning to the future of council-run water services, Mr Lang claimed
that ''a protracted, costly, and at times misleading campaign'' had been
mounted against the Tories' proposals to set up three new public water
authorities.
The cost of modernising the water and sewerage industry would be
substantial and he looked forward to the new authorities devising new
and innovative ways of securing the necessary funding.
''I believe the new structure will ensure that the rise in prices that
will be necessary to help finance this substantial investment will be
kept to a minimum,'' he said.
Labour delegates at the conference reacted angrily to confirmation in
Westminster that the soon-to-be-appointed chief executives of the new
authorities would be paid #80,000 a year, with performance-related
bonuses.
In Edinburgh, Mr Rifkind said Edinburgh people had the misfortune of
having to pay the highest combined council tax in Scotland through
having Labour-controlled local authorities (Edinburgh District Council
and Lothian Region Council).
He worried for the future, particularly in Edinburgh, if any
prospective investor was faced with a local authority with the highest
level of local tax and a Scottish parliament with a unique additional
level of income tax on top of the tax paid elsewhere in the UK.
For socialist councillors to create for Edinburgh the highest level of
tax in Scotland required a degree of dedicated incompetence and
concentrated futility few could match.
To be able to maintain this over a period of years entitled Labour
councillors to wear a badge of consistency that would have been admired
if it had not been clear they had been consistently hopeless in their
administration of the city, he said.
Looking to the election next month for the new unitary authority to
run Edinburgh, he said the city did not need two tiers of local
government as at present.
Asked how confident he was that the Conservatives would gain control
of the new council, he said they would concentrate on issues that
affected people in Edinburgh to bring about change.
If the election in Edinburgh was fought on local issues, the
Conservatives would win, he said.

A FIRE engine and a taxi collided with such force that the cab was
embedded in the side of the other vehicle.
The impact threw one woman passenger halfway out of the back of the
taxi, underneath the fire tender, a court heard yesterday.
Glasgow Sheriff Court was told that Margaret Ferrie, 52, who had been
in the back seat, died with her niece Marie Farmer, 24, who was sitting
in front.
The accident happened at the junction of Glasgow Road and Ledgate,
Kirkintilloch, near midnight on February 22 last year.
Two other women, taxi driver Lorrainne Dean, 24, of Kirkintilloch, and
Mrs Farmer's mother Agnes Younger, 59, sustained serious injuries.
On trial is 34-year-old fireman James Donald, of Thistle Street,
Townhead, Kirkintilloch, who denies causing the deaths of the two women,
both from Milton of Campsie, and injuring the other two.
He also denies driving dangerously and at an excessive speed through
red lights at the junction.
Witnesses described seeing the fire engine approaching the crossing
with its blue light flashing and then hearing its siren seconds before
the sound of the crash.
They told Miss Laura Taggart, prosecuting, that the Vauxhall Cavalier
private taxi was embedded into the side of the fire tender which had
ended up against a wall.
Fireman Robert Mullin, 35, said he was in charge of the vehicle which
was answering an emergency call to a fire in a flat at Kilsyth but he
did not see what happened because he was bent over putting on his boots.
Mr Mullin claimed he sounded the klaxon 50 yards before the junction
and it must have sounded more than once before they reached the
crossroads.
Asked by Miss Taggart what the procedure was when approaching red
lights, he said they could treat them like ''Give Way'' signs in an
emergency.
Mr Mullin said that before they reached the junction, he felt the fire
engine slowing.''I was bent down putting my boots on and had to put my
hand on the dashboard to stop myself moving forwards,'' he said.
Questioned by Mr David Hunter, witnesses said they did not think the
fire engine was going particularly fast for a vehicle going to an
emergency.
The trial before Sheriff Laura Duncan continues.

NOT enough women are represented at senior level in local government,
an education official claimed yesterday.
Mrs Elizabeth Reid, education director of Lothian Regional Council,
said women were under-represented in the top four tiers of local
authority management.
Mrs Reid, who became Scotland's first female education director when
she was appointed two years ago, said the majority of local government
workers were women but not enough of them held senior posts.
Her comments to The Herald followed a Lothian Regional Council meeting
in Edinburgh to give women an opportunity to find out more about local
government re-organisation.
Around 60 women questioned three senior council officials on matters
of concern to them. The main questions put to the panel were on water
charges, school provision, social work aid, community care, grants to
voluntary organisations, and planning issues.
Afterwards, Mrs Reid, who was on the discussion panel, said women were
under-represented, especially in senior positions from principal
officer, assistant director, deputy director up to director.
Mrs Reid said: ''I think it's around principal officer that the
serious under-representation starts. The way we look at it is that, in
our primary schools, we have something like 90% women teachers.
''We have women applying for promotion and now 77% of our head
teachers are women but there is still a gap. That is my point. What you
want is the number of women in senior positions to reflect the overall
composition of the workforce. That is not happening.
''There are two directors of education, me and Maggie Allan at Central
region.''
She said women were also under-represented in senior positions like
social work director and the role of chief executive.
When asked if she thought things would improve, Mrs Reid said: ''We
are going through a time of change. Women are coming forward and there
are schemes to support women through training and staff development.
''Over time, and hopefully not too long a time, the position will
begin to change. In fact, it is changing already.''
Her views were backed by Ms Jane Mitchell, vice-chairman of Lothian
Regional Council's women's committee.
Ms Mitchell said: ''The facts bear out what Mrs Reid is saying, there
are certainly not enough women in senior positions. On the political
side, there are only five women out of 49 councillors at Lothian region.
''Local authorities must look at ways to make things easier for women
with jobs in local government. At present, many women take career breaks
to have children.
''When they come back to work, they find their male counterparts way
up the career ladder. Child-care provision and other initiatives must be
looked at closely to allow women to keep their careers.''

AN officer who was forced to leave the police because of a back injury
was told by a judge yesterday that his memory of the circumstances of
the injury was mistaken.
Mr Malcolm Bradley, 35, of Drynie Park North, by Muir of Ord,
Ross-shire, was refused any compensation.
He had claimed that the injury happened during probationary training.
He was being instructed in an exercise known as ''press-down'', which
involved man-handling a suspect to the ground before applying a wrist
lock, when he fell to the floor in excruciating pain.
Mr Bradley claimed the instructor, thinking he had a slipped disc, had
tried to help by ''hyper-extending' his spine and this had aggravated
his injuries.
However, Mr Justice Waterhouse told him at the High Court in London:
''It seems to me that it is really incredible that a person experienced
in physical training, first aid, and other such matters would tackle a
person complaining of pain in his back in the way that Mr Bradley
alleges.''
The judge said the instructor, Constable Paul Blagg, was an
experienced and careful officer. ''I can find no evidence before me to
justify a finding of negligence against him.''
The accident happened at Peckham police station, south London, in
January 1989. Mr Bradley returned to work three weeks later but his back
remained vulnerable and trivial activities caused him pain. After two
years, Mr Bradley, a father of two, was retired from the force after
being certified ''permanently disabled for police duties''.
He was unemployed for three years before moving to Ross-shire, where
he works as a fork-lift truck salesman.
His case had been supported by the Police Federation.

<TEXT>
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd last night urged the Conservative Party
to put service to the public at the heart of its next election
manifesto.
In an apparent break with the Thatcherite legacy of privatisation and
market forces, Mr Hurd added: ''Achievement is not the same as making
money.''
He also rejected strongly demands by some Conservative MPs for the
party to counter Labour leader Tony Blair's appeal to the centre ground
with a move to the right in an address to students and staff at
Birmingham University.
''We do not need to fortify ourselves with great new rafts of
ideology. Nor do we need a huge volume of new laws just to show we are
active and busy. We do not need to decree permanent Conservative
revolution,'' he declared.
The Government, instead, should concentrate on pursuing the ''steady
course'' mapped out by the Prime Minister in his speech to the party
conference last October.
''We should concentrate on getting the balance right. That does not
mean travelling light or sinking into staid managerialism. I believe
that the idea of service is one way to give ourselves ballast,'' he
argued.
In particular, the ideal of service, with its inherent prospect of job
satisfaction, offered an alternative spur to achievement other than
simply making money.
''The concept of service is not something woolly or old-fashioned. In
Britain, it is part of the incentive to achievement and certainly one of
the foundations of the Conservative Party,'' he claimed.
He stressed that better public services could not be financed by
heavily increased taxation, which would drag down the economy, but
through increased wealth creation.
He also supported the idea of measuring the performance of the public
sector against the private sector and praised the ''valuable'' ethos of
a BBC financed solely by the licence payer -- a bete noir to many on the
Tory right.

Flight Lieutenant Martin Edward Owens, 30, who was married and came
from Derbyshire, successfully ejected along with the aircraft's pilot.
The two men, from 56 Squadron, based at Coningsby, Lincolnshire, were
recovered from the sea by helicopter and flown to hospital in Grimsby.
Flight Lieutenant Owens was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.
The RAF said the pilot was ''OK'', although he suffered minor injuries
ejecting from the #20m jet.
The Tornado F3 was on a routine training sortie when it crashed, five
miles off Spurn Head.
Two search and rescue Sea King helicopters were scrambled.

MS Roseanna Cunningham was positively glittering yesterday. Mr Alex
Salmond was beaming beside her.
They were talking confidently of putting a fairytale ending as soon as
possible to the tortuous trail that Ms Cunningham has taken to become
the SNP's torchbearer in the Perth and Kinross parliamentary
constituency.
Most definitely, the tabloid coverage of a historic episode in the
newly-selected candidate's personal life was put where it belonged -- in
once-upon-a-time land.
An elated Ms Cunningham admitted at a news conference in Perth where,
late on Thursday night, she captured 15 out of the 20 votes cast at a
local selection committee meeting: ''There was the odd occasion when I
thought I would not quite make it. Here I am.''
Now it was time ''to get back to what this is about, arguing the
politics of independence and the politics of change for Scotland and for
Perth and Kinross.''
Recalling her previous bid to wrest the seat from the late
Conservative MP, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, she said: ''I want to finish
now what we started in 1992. I am looking forward to the contest
enormously.''
Reporters were still hungry for more about how she felt about the
tabloids' treatment of her and the labels they attached.
Was she really a ''left-wing republican feminist''? Her answer: ''The
labels are amusing but they portray a picture that I don't think is me
at all.'' To illustrate how wrong the feminist label was, she confided:
''When the going got tough, this feminist went shopping!''
Ms Cunningham accused some tabloids of ''making a meal out of almost
nothing in reality''. She said: ''What happened to me, I would not want
to wish on my worst enemy.''
Asked if she had ''made her peace'' with party president Mrs Winnie
Ewing, she said: ''Absolutely. There is no problem between Winnie and
me. Winnie will be here, supporting me in this by-election, as I have
supported her in the past, and there will not be any difficulty
whatsoever.''
Mr Salmond stuck very different labels on Ms Cunningham from those
that made tabloid headlines.
''Our candidate has got grace,'' he said. She had shown that she had
''true grit'' and she also had ''gumption''. And she was ''not anybody
else's clone''.
Talking of the battering that the party took from sections of the
media during the selection contest, Mr Salmond accepted that it
sometimes seemed to be involved in a soap opera.
''I think we are heading towards a fairytale ending,'' he said. ''We
are going to take a massive step forward for Scotland.''
Mr Salmond was confident that Perth and Kinross had picked a winner --
and felt that Mr John Major knew it, too.
He accused the Prime Minister of trying to dodge the poll by not
calling an early one.
It was an open secret at Westminster that Mr Major had ruled out an
early poll because it would embarrass the Conservatives if they lost a
parliamentary by-election in the run-up to the local council elections
in England.
He called it a ''cynical delay'' and said that it was being done out
of ''blatantly political interests''.
Mr Salmond claimed that Scottish Conservatives wanted ''to go early''
but were overruled in Downing Street because the English council
elections in May had priority.
''I think that the Scottish Tories, if you like, have been made
sacrificial lambs,'' he said.
Mr Salmond pointed out that, if successful, Ms Cunningham would be the
party's sixth MP -- three men and three women.
''We are living proof that it is possible to have, on merit, an equal
representation of men and women.''
From the news conference, Ms Cunningham and Mr Salmond went round the
corner from the Salutation Hotel in Perth into Princes Street for the
formal opening of the party's new campaign rooms.
Nobody had had time to wash the windows but little more than 12 hours
after the candidate's selection, stickers and banners bearing her name
were already in place.
Mr Salmond explained: ''Remember, Roseanna was our candidate in
1992.''
Ms Cunningham intends to continue ''on a high'' for as long as
possible. She will have no difficulty achieving that in a few days' time
when, weather permitting, a party activist will pilot her in a
twin-engined light plane so that she can get a total overview of her
constituency.

THE Edinburgh International Festival -- with ticket sales approaching
#2m -- broke all previous box office and sponsorship records last year,
it was revealed in its audited accounts released yesterday.
Festival organisers said they were delighted with the figures, which
showed box-office sales of nearly #1.85m, a rise of almost 30% on the
1993 festival.
Sponsorship and donations broke the #1m mark for the first time, with
an increase of almost 25% on the previous year. Total turnover was
nearly #4.9m, up from #4.2m.
Festival spokeswoman Ms Morag Burnett said: ''We are delighted at the
figures. We are not a profit- making company and last year achieved our
objective of breaking even.''
Festival music audiences were up by 16% -- the Usher and Queen's Hall
shows playing to 82% and 90% of capacity respectively. Dance audiences
were double that of 1993.
A breakdown of the festival audience showed that 39% came from
Edinburgh and the Lothians, although the number of visitors from England
rose slightly.
The report states that the new Festival Theatre -- hosting opera,
theatre, and dance -- was a major boost to festival events.

FOLLOWING the success of Scotland's first centre, in Glasgow, to help
rehabilitate people withbrain injuries, one has opened in Aberdeen.
Lord Fraser of Carmylie yesterday opened the Rehab Scotland Brain
Injury Vocational Centre which will help up to 20 clients in the coming
year.
People who have suffered brain injuries are helped to learn the skills
to find a job.
Among the successes in Glasgow are a former lawyer, who has been
helped back to work as a legal assistant, and a man, injured in an
assault just after graduating from Strathclyde University, who is
working for the City Watch programme.
The Aberdeen centre, at Migvie House, North Silver Street, will be
managed by occupational psychologist Margaret Rose, who said most
clients would be referred by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary neurological ward,
the social work department, and by GPs. She said they would be helped to
find new jobs by being trained to use new technology, to use memory
strategy skills, and work-related social skills.
Mr Peter Davies, director of development at Rehab Scotland, said they
were working with around 50 people a year in Glasgow and it would
typically take between one and two years to get them back to work,
although it depended very much on individual cases.
''With approximately 100 people from the Aberdeen area sustaining
serious head injuries each year, Rehab believe it is an area which
needed this facility and the inquiries we have had since our
announcement last year indicated this is indeed the case.''
Lord Fraser said: ''We are determined that as many people as possible
with acquired brain injury live and work in the community and that, with
the correct support, confidence and independence can be maintained and
maximised and health and quality of life improved.
''There is solid evidence that this work has significant social and
psychological benefits for people, particularly so for people with
acquired brain injury or other mental disabilities.
''Independence is what most people strive for. That is a basic human
instinct. Employment potentially provides the financial means with which
to raise standards of living. It gives personal identity, daily
structure to life, wider social horizons, and a sense of shared purpose
and achievement.
''I am pleased that the Scottish Office has been able to directly help
this project with funds from our mental health grants.''

A FIREFIGHTER has won his fight to get his job back after undergoing
major heart surgery.
Mr Jim Gilpin, 45, from Dundee, had been told he was unfit for duty
after he had undergone a quadruple by-pass heart operation at Glasgow's
Royal Infirmary.
However, after making a full recovery, Mr Gilpin asked the Fire
Brigades' union to help him win back his job.
He said: ''I had a 100% successful operation and have made a recovery
to full health. But my case was reviewed in January last year and it was
decided by the Fire Brigade medical officer that I was not fit enough to
be a firefighter.
''I disagreed with this opinion and, with the help of my union, made
an appeal to the Scottish Office.''
He added: ''My appeal was upheld and I have consequently been
reinstated into the fire service.
''I would like to thank all Fire Brigades' union officials and members
for their help and support over a very stressful and trying period.''
Mr Gilpin's union representative Mr Jim Matthews said last night: ''He
showed real dedication and determination to get back up to the required
physical status.
''He had the physical abilities of an 18 to 20-year-old entrant to the
brigade. He also impressed brigade management at Tayside, who supported
our appeal. We are delighted that he is back.''

THE mother of a student who disappeared a month ago spoke yesterday of
her fears that the 18-year-old might be dead.
Detectives are becoming increasingly concerned for the safety of Robin
Grafton, described as kind, considerate, quiet, and home-loving.
His mother yesterday appealed to him to get in touch: ''Please contact
me: just let me know you are alive and well.''
The student of applied science at Stow College in Glasgow was last
seen on the morning of Friday, February 10, when he left the family home
in Commore Drive, Knightswood, apparently to go to college.
Despite extensive inquiries with friends and relatives, as well as
hospitals, student associations, and youth hostels, police have found no
information about his whereabouts, and say his disappearance was
''totally out of character''.
However, they have discovered that Robin, who previously had an
excellent attendance record, had been taking the odd day off since
Christmas. They know that at least two of the few friends he has are
Chinese, and are appealing to the city's Chinese community for
information.
Police also revealed that, the day before he went missing, his father,
Peter, had a chance meeting with him at Glasgow Central Station. He had
told his father he was awaiting a friend from Ayr. ''We don't know who
this friend is and we would ask anybody from that area who knows Robin
to come forward.''
His mother, Ms Julia Harders, who has separated from her husband,
although the couple still keep in touch, yesterday helped police make a
public appeal for help.
At a news conference at Strathclyde Police headquarters, she admitted
she feared her son might be dead: ''I try to be optimistic but after a
month . . . yes, it does occur to you. At night, I sometimes think that
way. But I try to keep my spirits up and hope that he is still alive.''
The mother added: ''Robin is a very kind and considerate person. The
day before he disappeared, one of our neighbours said he had a golden
heart.''
Given the popularity of gambling in the Chinese community, she was
asked if she thought he might have become involved in this. ''His bank
account does not indicate that he has been gambling. There is a lot of
money in his account. He has a full grant and is very careful with
that.''
At first, his mother wondered if drugs were the cause of his
disappearance: ''But the police say there is no indication of that, and
nobody has ever seen him taking drugs.''
Leading the hunt for the missing student is Detective Sergeant Alison
Elliott, who said: ''It is totally out of character for Robin to do this
and not be in touch with his mum.''
''He did not appear to have any cash with him and he has not withdrawn
any money from his account since he was last seen.''
He is described as 6ft, of slim to medium build, with short, straight,
brown hair. When last seen, he was wearing a dark blue anorak, blue
denims, dark blue sweater, and black boots and was carrying a black
rucksack.

EXCLUSIVE
CONTROL of one of Scotland's most beautiful and sensitive areas, Loch
Lomond and the Trossachs, is to be placed in the hands of a joint
committee made up largely from local authorities.
The Scottish Office has accepted the Hutchison Report practically in
full. In its original remit, it killed the idea of a national park-type
board, and it means the vital functions of planning, development,
control of recreation, and conservation are thrust back on local
government.
It appears that, with the exception of specific projects which can be
funded by the Government's agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, the
finance will have to come from the budgets of Dumbarton, Stirling, and
Argyll and Bute district councils.
The author of the report, Glasgow businessman Sir Peter Hutchison said
yesterday: ''The Scottish Secretary must still be prepared to use his
muscle power to require action from this joint committee.
''He must not lose ownership of this problem by simply handing it back
to the local authorities from whom, if one is honest, the problems
originally arose. If this joint body does not work, then it is still on
his plate to do something about it.''
Sir Peter was reflecting the widespread view that the Loch Lomond Park
Authority, a creation of Strathclyde and Central regional councils and
Dumbarton and Stirling district councils, was hamstrung by often bitter
political differences and conflicting priorities.
Loch Lomond was always peripheral to all of them and it would remain
peripheral to the three new authorities, Sir Peter and others believe.
''This will remain the rural fringe for these three authoritiies. They
will feel there are more pressing priorities in their more heavily
populated areas,'' he said.
Details of the shape of the new body will be made public on Monday by
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office Environment Minister, and Mr Magnus
Magnusson, chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage. The Herald has learned
that the thrust of Scottish Office policy is that all the powers
required to run the area already exist with local authorities, so it was
pointless duplicating them.
The new joint committee will have, by law, a two-thirds membership of
councillors not, as Sir Peter hoped, a 50-50 split between councillors
and people from the community.
The borders of the new park will have to be decided by the local
authorities. Sir Peter's report recommended that any new joint body
should have planning powers but the Scottish Office is believed to
favour leaving the matter of powers to the councils.
It has accepted, however, the ideal that there should be one local
plan for the entire area -- once again leaving it to the three
authorities.
They will be expected to set up a steering or action committee shortly
after the April local elections.
It would include bodies such as the Forestry Commission, SNH, Friends
of Loch Lomond, and other interested groups. The Scottish Office is
thought to be willing the set the ball rolling with liaison and a
secretariat.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang is believed to be keen to see the new
committee with a clearly defined role and powers by Christmas, so that
the growing development and recreation pressures can be tackled once and
for all.
It is possible for the councils to create a joint board more or less
right away but approval for this from the Scottish Office would depend
on their willingness to create a strong and purposeful body.
The logical executive arm of any new board or committee would be the
Loch Lomond Park Authority, which, the Government believes, could fulfil
an expanded role.

TWO Glaswegian construction workers who lost their jobs because they
did not want to travel to Edinburgh every day have won their case over
the sackings.
A Glasgow industrial tribunal has ruled they were unfairly dismissed
by Renfrew-based Balfour Kilpatrick Ltd and has awarded them a total of
#3685 compensation.
The tribunal heard the company lost a ScottishPower contract to lay
cables in the Glasgow area where the two men had been working. However,
it retained similar contracts in Edinburgh, Fife, and the Borders.
Mr Neil Diver, a cable foreman, and Mr Thomas Crawford, a driver
labourer, were told there was alternative work available for them in the
Edinburgh area, but they were unwilling to travel.
Mr Diver, 60, of White Street, Partick, told the tribunal it would
have meant he had to leave the house almost an hour and a half earlier
in the mornings and would be home late at night.
Mr Crawford, 35, of Drysdale Avenue, Yoker, would also have to leave
home much earlier to pick up other workers before travelling to
Edinburgh.
The company denied the two had been dismissed as they were each
offered alternative employment and had refused. It also claimed they
were covered by a mobility clause and denied there was a redundancy
situation.
The tribunal found there was no consultation and said there was no
doubt a redundancy situation existed in Glasgow as the company had lost
the business in which the two were employed.
The tribunal was satisfied their refusal to travel was not
unreasonable. Mr Diver was awarded #2437 compensation and Mr Crawford
#1248.

* It emerged yesterday that Scottish Natural Heritage and the
Cairngorm Chairlift Company have moved closer in their efforts to meet
objections lodged by SNH to proposals for a #16m funicular railway on
Cairngorm to replace worn-out ski lifts.
A planning application has been before Highland Regional Council since
August, with SNH as the major objectors. The company has resubmitted
plans for the railway's top station at the Ptarmigan, just below the
Cairngorm summit, which scale down the building.
It has also lodged more detail of a plan for visitor management,
saying it is willing to enter into a legally binding agreement on that
score. Although some difficulties remain, SNH is understood to be taking
a more favourable view and is willing to continue talks.

CROFTING communities were urged yesterday to act for themselves to
tackle ''the deep-rooted moral corruption of the system'' which acts
against local people owning and sharing the assets of their areas.
Dr Michael Foxley, a crofter, GP, and regional councillor, was
speaking at the Scottish Crofters' union seminar at Beauly. He gave
examples of how crofters on Locheilside had tried over the years to get
control of local woodland and had been frustrated at every turn by the
system and institutions involved.
''They were not seen as an 'appropriate group', they were the wrong
class. They asked to be kept informed -- but heard nothing.''
However, the system could be challenged successfully, said Dr Foxley.
He called for a crofters' rolling fund to intervene when assets such as
woodland, vacant land beside communities, and river beats come on the
market.
''What has to happen, first, is that there is open marketing of these
assets, and, second, that the local community is offered first refusal.
It won't happen everywhere but it has been proved in the past in places
like Assynt that there are pockets of activity where it can happen. Then
it is up to us to challenge by example.''
The acting SCU president, Mr Angus MacIver, from Rogart, said the
Harris superquarry would generate about #360m profit over the life of
the project, yet the only right crofters had in respect of the
development was the agricultural value of the land.
''The crofters will receive a payment of #6000 for the loss of
one-third of their common grazing. Others will benefit: the landlord to
the tune of some #42m; the owner of the mineral rights will make #30m,
and the Crown Estates will make #18m. Redland will take the remainder.''

THE fitting of two-way cab radio systems to trains is expected to be
among recommendations in the official report into the Cowden, Kent, rail
crash in which five people were killed, it emerged yesterday.
Lack of proper radio links played a key part in the accident last
October, in which two trains crashed into each other in fog on a
single-track line near Ashford in Kent.
The Cowden public inquiry was told that a signalman -- unable to make
contact -- could only watch helplessly on monitoring equipment as the
trains headed for each other.
Network SouthCentral, which operated the line, accepted at the inquiry
that drivers had repeatedly protested over the lack of proper radio
equipment.
Any fitting of cab radios would be welcomed by the train drivers'
union, Aslef.
Both drivers in the accident were killed, as well as a guard and two
passengers.
Last month, 31 peoplewere hurt when a passenger train went into the
back of a stationary goods service in east London.
A signal worker said he knew the accident was going to happen but had
been unable to contact the driver.
In January, a rail employee was killed on the Settle to Carlisle line
in Cumbria when a train collided with another which had been derailed.
In that case, radio communications were hindered by the mountainous
terrain, prompting a call for beacons to be installed.
The inquest into the Cowden crash deaths was opened and adjourned at
Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on October 21.
The Health and Safety Executive, which will publish the official
report into the accident, said yesterday that the report would not come
out until the inquest was completed.

EXCLUSIVE
TOTAL public expenditure in Scotland will be cut by more than #600m in
real terms over the next three years, according to detailed spending
plans published by the Scottish Office yesterday.
The cuts affect every area of service except health. Even there,
however, the real increase is marginal, with spending planned to rise by
just #16m to #3906m, between this year's outturn and the plans for
1997/98.
Opposition parties were last night united in criticising sharply what
they described as ''savage cuts on public expenditure.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''These cuts confirm
our worst fears, that public expenditure is being cut to finance tax
bribes next year.''
The Scottish National Party said the Scottish Office figures amounted
to the most savage spending settlement for many years. The party's local
government spokesman, Mr Andrew Welsh, said: ''The cuts represent a
decrease of 4%, which compares with a more or less stand-still budget
for the UK as a whole.
''Scotland has been singled out for these savage cuts and will be
again. The price of tax cuts for middle England is cuts in vital
services here in Scotland,'' the MP for Angus East said.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said: ''This is a
clear indication of what a continuing Tory Government will mean for
Scotland. There is clearly going to be a sustained attack on public
expenditure. The only ray of hope is that before the three years are up,
there has to be another General Election.''
When Scottish Secretary Ian Lang announced his 1995/96 budget
settlement in November, he stressed the need to take tough decisions on
spending, but added: ''Nevertheless, we have still been able to plan for
a #250m increase in Scottish Office spending in the year ahead, bringing
the total to over #6200 for every home in Scotland.''
In simple cash terms, there is indeed an increase in spending under
the Scottish Secretary's control, from an estimated outturn in the
current financial year of #14,143m, to planned spending of #14,338m in
1995/96, rising to planned spending of #14,614m in 1997/98.
However, these figures take no account of the impact of inflation on
the spending power involved. The detailed plans published yesterday, in
a report entitled Serving Scotland's Needs, include a second set of
tables set at fixed 1993/94 prices.
These ''real terms'' figures paint a very different picture of cuts,
almost right across the board. In these terms, total expenditure under
Mr Lang's control is expected to reach #13,867m this year, fall to
#13,614m in 1995/96, and continue downwards to a planned #13,240m in
1997/98, a cumulative cut of #627m on this year's estimated total.
Local authorities are the biggest victims. In real terms, central
government support to local authorities will fall by #528m over the
three-year planning period, a cut of 8.4%. Roads, housing, law and
order, even education, all take their share of the pain.
By the end of the three-year period, if the plans are fulfilled,
annual roads and transport spending will be cut by #58m, a drop of
nearly 14% on the current year. Law and order spending will be cut by
#27m, a decrease of nearly 6%.
Education is less hard hit but, even there, real spending is planned
to fall from #1282m this year to #1245m in 1997/98.
The industry, enterprise, and training budget is another real-terms
casualty, with this year's estimated spending of #591m set to fall to
#558m by 1997/98. Adult training for the long-term unemployed is hard
hit, with a #9m cut in the cash budget planned for the coming financial
year alone.
One area, where the Scottish Secretary is lead Minister, escaped from
the general cuts. The Forestry Commission's expenditure plans show an
increase of more than 30% in planting grants to private owners by
1997/98.
''We have been able to find the resources to expand and look after our
forests,'' said Mr Lang. ''New incentives to encourage private owners to
plant woodlands for public recreation and to welcome more walkers, will
provide significant new access and recreational benefits.''

Three people were arrested yesterday following further clashes over
opposition to the M77 motorway link.
After an incident in Patterton Wood, near Newton Mearns, a 31-year-old
man and 28-year-old woman were held in connection with alleged public
order offences, where workers were removing tree roots and burning
timber.
In a separate incident, a 62-year-old woman was arrested on the access
road to Haggs Castle in connection with an alleged spitting incident.
All three are expected to appear in court on Monday.
Meanwhile, protester Ms Claire Green yesterday claimed that Wimpey,
the construction company responsible for building the #53.6m motorway,
were timing ''big pushes'' for Fridays in the knowledge that protesters
would be aware they would have to spend the weekend in the cells.
At the Patterton Wood site, around 20 protesters formed a protective
ring around one tree, which housed two teenage girls. They have slept in
the treehouse for several days to try and prevent it being felled.
One protester alleged foresters had deliberately lit fires under the
treehouse using tyres in an attempt to smoke them out. The foresters'
employer, Mr John Meikle, from Barrhead, denied this.

<TEXT>
THE Court of Appeal last night allowed a health authority's appeal
against a judge's ruling that it acted unlawfully in refusing to fund
treatment for a 10-year-old girl dying from leukemia.
Three of the country's most senior judges said Cambridge Health
Authority acted rationally and fairly.
They ruled it was not for courts to interfere in such circumstances
with the way health authorities made medical judgments on funding.
The father of the girl, referred to as B, wants more treatment to try
to save his daughter, who was given six to eight weeks to live in
mid-January.
The judges overturned a decision earlier yesterday by Mr Justice Laws,
who said the authority ought to have given ''over-riding priority'' to
the child's ''fundamental right to life'' but failed to do so.
It was not clear last night whether B would receive treatment after
all.
Her father's solicitor Michael Sinclair said that several offers of
funding were being considered.
Mr Justice Laws had accused the authority of basing its decision not
to fund purely on medical evidence and failing to take account of the
views of the 32-year-old father, who wanted a third round of
chemotherapy and a second bone marrow transplant in a ''last chance of
life'' for his daughter.
Giving judgment, the Master of the Rolls appealed to the media to
report the case so B's identity would not be revealed -- and in such a
way that, were she to read a newspaper or see TV, she would not be able
to identify herself and realise how desperately ill she was.
The Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Commission, which includes
Cambridge health authority, said the Appeal Court judgment vindicated
the way it took its decision.
However, the private consultant the girl's parents want to carry out
the treatment said yesterday that he disagreed with NHS doctors who said
it was not worth it.
* A four-year-old child flew to America yesterday for life-saving
surgery on a brain tumour which NHS surgeons say they cannot cure.
Chelsea Burke, from Herne, in Kent, has only days to live.

A MAN cradled his boyhood friend in his arms after stabbing him in the
heart in a fight over a woman, a court heard yesterday.
Thomas Hannigan told victim Mr Alexander McPherson: ''Look what you
have made me do. I love you. You are my brother.''
Hannigan 29, of Ferguslie Park, Paisley, was so full of remorse he
felt he ought to hang and regretted that capital punishment had been
abolished.
He was jailed for two years at the High Court in Edinburgh after he
admitted stabbing Mr McPherson on November 2 last year. He was
originally charged with murder but the Crown accepted his plea of guilty
of culpable homicide.
Mr Michael O'Grady, Advocate-depute, told the court Hannigan had a
long-term relationship with Ms Elizabeth Cameron, the mother of his four
children, whom he regarded as his wife.
The couple split up in October 1993 and she later formed a
relationship with Mr McPherson which ''understandably strained'' the
men's friendship.
However, Mrs Cameron broke off with Mr McPherson, of Bankfoot Road,
Paisley, on October 30 last year and began seeing Hannigan again.
Mr McPherson made a variety of threats to Hannigan, including a threat
to kill him.
''He made it clear that the reason for these threats was because of
Hannigan and Mrs Cameron getting back together again.''
On the day of the stabbing, Mr McPherson, 31, turned up at Hannigan's
home armed with a foot-long cast-iron wrench. He had a bottle of whisky
with him and had been drinking heavily.
He tried to kick in the door of the house and, when Hannigan opened
the door, began swinging the wrench and making threats. Hannigan
retreated to the living room and picked up a decorating knife.
A struggle took place in the hallway and Mrs Cameron managed to grab
the wrench from Mr McPherson. She then heard Hannigan exclaim: ''Look
what you have made me do. I love you. You are my brother. How could you
make me do this to you?''
Mr Donald Findlay QC, defence counsel, said: ''It is one of the sad
factors of the case that the accused and victim had been close friends
for many years.
''He reacted to what was a potentially dangerous situation, for him
with tragic consequences.''
Hannigan had not been aware of striking the fatal blow.
Passing sentence, Lord McCluskey told Hannigan that he took into
account that the victim had repeatedly come looking for him and, on the
last occasion, was brandishing an extremely formidable weapon.
In the public interest, he felt that a jail sentence had to be imposed
but, in the highly unusual circumstances, he would restrict the sentence
to two years.

A PARTIAL floodlight failure which resulted in the Tennents Scottish
Cup quarter-final football tie between Celtic and Kilmarnock at Hampden
Park being halted for 24 minutes last night may have been caused by a
generator being interfered with.
A statement issued late last night on behalf of Queen's Park Football
Club, which owns Hampden, said: ''The cause of the fault was immediately
identified and there was evidence that the generator, which provides the
primary source of power to the South Stand floodlights, had been
tampered with.''
A radio report earlier suggested some children may have gained access
to the generator room and tampered with the generator.
Match referee Kenny Clark ordered both sets of teams into the dressing
rooms after 34 minutes of play when the lights failed. The match was
being beamed live throughout the UK by Sky Television.
In the event, the game was held up for 24 minutes but even then the
full battery of Hampden floodlights was not restored.
Within six minutes of the restart, John Collins put Celtic ahead with
a penalty, the only goal of the game.

EXCLUSIVE
A GLASGOW man, convicted of murdering a judge's teenage daughter, has
appealed for witnesses or anyone with information, 42 years after he was
sentenced.
An independent inquiry into the case of Mr Iain Hay Gordon, convicted
in 1953 for the murder of 19-year-old Patricia Curran, is being sought
from the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew.
Maryhill Labour MP Maria Fyfe has asked for a free pardon to be
considered for Mr Gordon, 63, who was released from Holywell Mental
Hospital seven years after being found guilty but insane at his trial in
Belfast Crown Court.
Mr Gordon has now talked in his native Scotland for the first time
about the case, which is reported exclusively in Weekender today.
Miss Curran was found, with 37 stab wounds, near her home in the
coastal village of Whiteabbey. Mr Gordon, on national service with the
RAF in Northern Ireland, was charged three months later after signing a
confession which he subsequently maintained was false and extracted
through duress.
He says: ''This may be my last chance and I am determined to clear my
name, come what may. If anyone knows anything that could help me, even
at this late stage, I would appreciate it.
''In a case like this, even so many years later, I think there must be
someone, somewhere who knows what happened to Miss Curran.''
The victim was the daughter of Lord Justice Lance Curran, who headed
the Supreme Court of Northern Ireland after serving as a High Court
judge (at the time of the murder), as Northern Ireland's
Attorney-General, and as Unionist MP for the Carrick Division of County
Antrim.
Mr Gordon has, until now, maintained a silence in Scotland about the
case as part of an agreement which secured his release in 1960 and found
him employment. He accepted an assumed name at William Collins the
publishers and worked for 31 years at the Bishopbriggs warehouse until
1993.
He says that, until now, he did not have the resources to launch a
campaign to clear his name. He believed that, until the ceasefire six
months ago, the continuation of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland
did not give him the right to make public appeals over a private
injustice.
Five points of concern over the investigation by detectives of New
Scotland Yard working with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and over the
conduct of the trial, have been raised with Sir Patrick this week in a
letter from Mrs Fyfe. She has requested a meeting to discuss the case.
Mrs Fyfe has told Sir Patrick: ''It seems to me that the facts I have
set out demonstrate serious cause for disquiet and the implication of
doubts over Mr Gordon's guilt is, of course, that the real murderer of
Patricia Curran has never been brought to trial.''
A Glasgow lawyer, Ms Margo Harvey of John Wilson, has also taken up
the case and is investigating the legal position in Northern Ireland
governing appeals and pardons.
Ms Harvey said: ''If you took away Iain Gordon's confession, there was
no other evidence against him, nothing at all but a lot of unanswered
questions. If this case were heard today, I would doubt if the public
would accept it.''
