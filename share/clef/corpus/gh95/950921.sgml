PERTH is not a popular venue for the SNP conference. The town itself
has a transient character; it may have pretentions to citydom, but for
most of us its a place we pass through, fleetingly, heading for
somewhere much more interesting.
Then the City Halls where the Nationalists are met, have a cramped and
gothic quality. To get through the front door, you have to squeeze past
big fat pillars. All the passages are long and narrow. They are thronged
with party hacks and finding the press room is like negotiating the maze
of Daedalus.
Not to mention the hall itself. It is grim and utilitarian. The
yellow-on-black backcloth of the conference set does not quite hide a
vast organ. The floor is flat, not tiered, delegates sit on stacking
chairs, just a little too close together.
The whole place reeks of the kind of virtue that is its own
punishment. Instinctively, you check the floor for the markings of a
badminton court. As the Nationalists assemble, it feels rather like a
WRI rally, gathered perhaps for a riveting talk on poultry keeping.
Still, people make up for such physical constraints, and SNP people
are wonderful. It's a family party, familiar, festive and friendly.
There are old faces and new faces. The home baking is great.
So I spy Dr Robert MacIntyre the very first SNP MP, elected briefly
over 50 years ago. And I also spy Roseanna Cunningham, Perth's new SNP
MP and living proof that the town can do something interesting. She is
just as formidable as Dr MacIntyre, though rather prettier.They don't
have much else in common, I think, but for their taste in bog-coloured
jackets.
It's 10 years since I joined the SNP, and some of us have aged better
than others. John Swinney and I were both at university then; of course,
he was far more important than me and today he has ''future party
leader'' written all over him.
On the other hand, I think I've coped rather better with losing my
hair. Only a few weeks ago, I gamely faced reality and cropped the lot
very short, so that a neat suede dome now crowns my brooding good looks.
Well, the poor fellow is still combing it back, dead straight, and
keeps it long, even though it is now peaking savagely and the cause is
lost. It gives him a very mean vicious look.
Grub's good. In 1990 when I was here last cock-a-leekie soup and
millionaire's shortbread were served by local activists in the Lesser
Hall. Five years on, they're still dishing up decent Scots nosh, but
five years is an eternity in politics.
Don't I remember Margo McDonald, in this very hall, arguing to her
entire satisfaction that hubby Jim Sillars owned his Govan seat for
life? Wasn't there someone called Jim Fairlie, who waylaid me over a
bowl of cock-a-leekie and outlined exactly how he would win Perth and
Kinross for the SNP but Fairlie, by the time of the 1992 election had
quit the party. Where can he be now?
He must be out somewhere in that strange limbo to where fallen
Nationalists vanish. They're probably all on a Caribbean beach: George
Reid, Douglas Henderson, Ian McCormick and, for all I know, Lord Lucan
and Shergar.
Five years on, the catering bosses have banned smoking from the Lesser
Hall. So the prunes may safely bob in the cock-a-leekie free from
carcinogenic air. I've just come out from the most ridiculous debate: a
call for the SNP government to ban all tobacco advertising. It wasn't a
debate at all. After two or three limp speeches of support it was passed
by acclamation.
The next motion was about sport : among other things it called on the
SNP to appoint a sports and leisure ''spokesperson'' to its Scottish
Cabinet. Rob Gibson, the party's big Highland character, poured grim
scorn on this. At this rate, mumbled Gibson, the Cabinet table will need
to be 20 yards long, he is tired of motions calling for yet more
spokespersonships.
And, in a wonderful new phrase, Gibson called on his brethern to start
thinking of motions that are ''realistically carry-outable.''
Gibson mumbled because he was bent double. He was bent double because
the speaker's lectern is ridiculously low. A good pulpit or lectern
should meet a man at the pit of his stomach. This one meets the typical
SNP spokesperson just below the testicles. And there's even a silly
little ramp behind it. So, if a speaker stands normally, he's beyond
microphone range and you can't hear a word he says.
Nothing for it but to stoop, and mumble painfully in a posture like
something out of an evolutionary chart. And, if all the SNP speakers
over the next three days are as sore as Gibson looked by the time he's
finished, the SNP's first ''Challenge of the Nineties'' is simple. Hire
an osteopath. They can't pay him much but the cock-a-leekie is
wonderful.

THE basic ingredient for the creation of any successful community is
to provide it with as broad a social mix as possible.
Glasgow was slower than some cities to recognise this, or at least to
encourage builders to do something about it, so the decision by Bellway
Homes to erect 52 houses for sale adjacent to Great Western Retail Park
is an important step in the right direction.
Work started on the Bellway site in July 1994 and is expected to be
completed by November.

THE first major deals under the Government's Property Drive disposal
programme have just been revealed. More than 57,000 sq ft has been let
to new tenants on flexible, short term leases, while around 15,000 sq ft
has been sold for more than #500,000.
The marketing campaign was conceived by Government estate managers
Property Holdings as a means of disposing of surplus properties in
Scotland. Around 400,000 sq ft of space in some 50 properties scattered
across Scotland have been put on the market as part of the Property
Drive.
The most significant letting so far is a 15 month sub-let of 50,000 sq
ft at East Kilbride's Plaza Tower to ScottishPower.
Bert Niven, principal property manager with Property Holdings, said:
''These initial sales and lettings demonstrate that we are able to offer
a wide range of quality accommodation on economic and flexible terms. As
well as making more efficient use of Government property, we expect that
this initiative will also assist business in Scotland.''
Agents involved in the marketing campaign are: Ryden, Knight Frank
Rutley, Chesterton, &amp; Hillier Parker.

James Currie looks to the future of the Great Western Retail and
Leisure Park and talks to managers of businesses which have already
enjoyed successful openings
GREAT Western Retail and Leisure Park promises to become one of the
biggest, busiest and best shopping complexes of its type in Scotland.
Just one-and-a-half miles west of Anniesland Cross, its catchment area
for potential customers is enormous. Drumchapel, Knightswood, Kilbowie,
Bearsden and Milngavie residents are all just minutes away by car -- and
they can beat city centre traffic jams to make a ''one stop'' shopping
trip that promises to be both a stress-free and enjoyable experience.
The developers have been careful to create as wide a mix of lettings
as possible, from fast food outlets to suppliers of DIY and garden
equipment.
Shoppers from out of town who may be more than a little peckish can
also find excellent restaurant facilities where full meals can be
enjoyed.
The retailers open for business are also delighted with their new
surroundings. At Burger King, senior assistant manager Owen Lynch says
business is already brisk and will no doubt get even better once the
final landscaping touches have been made to the site.
''The opening of the retail park has already proved its worth as far
as generating jobs locally,'' he said. ''We are now looking at special
promotions which we will slot into our normal Burger King menu, thus
offering customers even better value for money .''
At the nearby #1.4m Whitbread's Leven Valley Brewers Fayre family pub
and restaurant, everything from bar snacks to full meals is on offer.
Opened by Donald Dewar MP, it was one of the first Great Western
Retail facilities to become fully operational.
The twenty-first in a chain scattered throughout Scotland, it is built
in blonde brick, features colourful exterior plants and flowers and
offers a warm, welcoming interior in true continental cafe bar style
plus a menu specially tailored to suit the Glasgow palate. In other
words good food, well prepared and presented and served, if required,
with a choice of familiar drinks from the fully stocked bar.
Manager Mike Gardener says business has been ''fantastic'' from day
one, with initial target figures having to be revised upwards. ''We are
now in the process of taking Christmas bookings even although we are
only just into autumn,'' he said.
Parents should note that kids are welcome at Brewers Fayre which has
installed a safe Playzone where they can let off steam while the
grown-ups enjoy a rest.
Whitbread's, who have already taken on over 40 staff at the Brewers
Fayre pub-restaurant, will provide jobs for another 50 or so in its
adjacent, but separate Pizza Hut fast food outlet and Mike Gardener is
also expecting a spin-off from the new Mecca Bingo Hall next door.
Look out for some of your favourite stars from soaps such as
EastEnders putting in an appearance there.
But the centrepiece of the development is the giant B &amp; Q Warehouse
and Garden Centre.
Do-it-yourself has been one of the great retailing successes over the
past two decades, and B&amp;Q insists that there is still a remarkable
potential for growth to be exploited.
The new Glasgow warehouse will offer an enormous stock of top quality,
branded goods, from a screwdriver to everything required to build or
restore a complete house.
With gardening still occupying the top spot in Britain's list of
hobbies, the same applies. Whether your requirements are a simple packet
of seeds or a small house plant to fill that awkward corner of the
living room, the selection on offer will be bound to provide a solution.
Plants, shrubs and trees for the larger garden together with seasonal
bedding plants proliferate. So do all of the items required for keeping
plants healthy, from plant food and sprays to solutions guaranteed to
get rid of all those nasty pests that can ruin the most promising
blooms.
Garden furniture, sheds, greenhouses, cold frames and even
conservatories -- they are all there alongside a bewildering selection
of tools, protective clothing and mowers. Such is the inventory at B&amp;Q
that the trick is to think of something that isn't held in stock.
Anyone who has ever had to choose carpets by trying to imagine how
that small square in a sample book will turn out when it has to cover a
much larger floor space will appreciate the vast number of complete
rolls held at General George.
Everything from the purely functional floorcovering to those deep
pile, plush carpets that can turn a bedroom into a little piece of
heaven is available, and at down to earth prices.
No matter the pattern, style or usage, the choice is enormous and you
can benefit from plenty of expert advice.
Top quality goods are also on offer from the World of Leather and
Olympus Sport, two other big High Street names attracted to the retail
park.
With such a strong representation having taken space at the facility
it has the potential to rival anything else of its type in Scotland --
and it can only get bigger.

CHARTWELL Land entered into negotiations with Atlas Investments,
owners of the Goodyear site, for the purchase of 18 acres in 1993.
Naturally the purchase was subject to planning permission being
granted for retail use, this being obtained last year. The rest of the
site was to be developed by others, notably Ramjet Developments Limited,
for retail, leisure and industrial uses.
B&amp;Q, as a sister company to Chartwell Land, had expressed an interest
in occupying a new ''flagship'' store on the site and subsequently
adopted the role of anchor tenant for the scheme.
In turn Chartwell Land negotiated leases with a variety of retailers,
resulting in the whole development being let prior to completion.
The overall layout of the scheme is therefore based on the need to
accommodate B&amp;Q's requirements in terms of size and prominence, together
with its adjoining garden centre and bulk goods area.
In addition to this, the other retail units needed maximum flexibility
in terms of size. For example, the terrace is designed with its portals
spanning front to back with blockwork dividing walls between units of
between 930 and 7440 sq m in size. The development now consists of six
930 sq m units and a larger 1860 sq m facility.
All of the units are similarly detailed, with facing brickwork at low
level and a coated metal cladding system above. Roofs are pitched metal
cladding draining to perimeter gutters with a symphonic drainage system.
The entrance to each unit is highlighted by a tower providing a
signage area. To the rear is a service yard and each unit is fitted with
roller shutter doors opening onto this.
The developer constructed shell standard units incorporating
individual tenant variations. Individual tenants were given the
responsibility of ''fitting out''.
As part of Chartwell Land's concern over environmental issues, a
BREEAM assessment by the developer was sought. Much discussion and a few
modifications later, a ''very good'' certificate was acquired. In fact,
Great Western Retail Park is the first such facility in Scotland to
obtain this rating (and only the third in the UK).
Chartwell Land has a long-standing policy of using JCT 81, with
contractor's design for most of its developments. This has an advantage
in that it allows strict control of the selection of appropriate
materials and layouts of sites based on previous experience garnered on
similar projects elsewhere.
In addition the attraction of a ''fixed price'' and duration allows
the company to use the design and build format, engineer and architect
working with the successful contractor. The company's quantity
surveyors, Gleeds, were retained as employer's agents on the project.
The Glasgow project was tendered to five main contractors on a
competitive basis. After tender return there was a rationalisation of
prices to enable a like-for-like comparison.
It was on this basis that the AMEC bid was deemed the most competitive
and they were appointed after interview on 18 January 1995.
Work on the site started just 12 days later, initially on site
levelling which involved considerable cutting and filling to obtain a
level platform. In addition there was a need to remove a substantial
amount of contaminated material, a legacy of previous industrial
operations.
Given the tight contract period, it became necessary as early as week
three to make a start on the B&amp;Q building, the foundations for the eight
terraced units being laid a month later.
With each of the tenants specifying different requirements for their
base building, amenity block and shopfronts -- these often changing as
new retailers' requirements became known, it was -- to say the least --
an interesting project.
In all the contract period was 33 weeks, with AMEC continuing to
complete the car parking and landscaping.

PEOPLE aiming to set up their own businesses and who might be
attracted to one of the industrial units on offer at the retail park
should make contact with the Drumchapel Business Centre.
Those first tentative steps are never easy, but can be even more
complicated and demanding unless you are fortunate enough to have
somewhere to turn for help.
The business centre can advise on start-ups, grants, loans, funding
packages, expansion, diversification and staffing.
It is also worth pointing out that in addition to the usual leg-ups
offered to businesses in their embryo months, Drumchapel Opportunities
and their funders have negotiated extra funding for entrepreneurs
already in, or coming into the area.
The funding provides an extra #40 per week and has been made possible
through money being made available to Drumchapel residents via the
European Social Fund and Business Start-Up Service (Glasgow Development
Agency).
''This extra funding will enable clients who have assessed potentially
viable business ideas, through the Business Assessment Programme, to
develop these ideas into viable start-ups,'' said senior business
counsellor, Callum Graham.
''It can help to further develop their business management skills in
an applied situation during those vulnerable first six months of
trading.
''Assistance of this sort can greatly increase the chances of business
survival and build in potential for growth.''
During the post start-up training period, the trainee will be paid #40
per week for each 26-week training session.
Drumchapel Business Centre, 0141 949 4949.
But if employment is the primary source of the economic well-being of
a community, what about expanding the mind and attending to more
cerebral needs?
Drumchapel Community Organisation's Council, in 1989, kick-started a
project that has tapped a wealth of talent in the area.
Its strategy was called Senses Alive Drumchapel Arts. Hardly the most
promising of labels, but its aims were easier to grasp, namely
communicating enjoyment and renewal through theatre, film, visual arts,
drama, creative writing, fashion and design.
The strategy provides the foundation of organisation, ideas and
priorities implemented in such a way that they have already attracted a
great deal of attention from outside the district.
Nothing to do in Drumchapel? On the contrary, if you want to do it
there is always someone or some organisation near at hand to point you
in the right direction.

In this Herald supplement, James Currie reports on the progress of the
Great Western Retail Park
ONE of the most impressive retail and industrial developments to be
created in the Glasgow area in recent years is now operational.
Great Western Retail and Leisure Park, built on the site of the former
Goodyear Tyres factory on Great Western Road, celebrates its official
opening this month.
Developed by Ramjet Limited, which was previously involved in the
successful Parkhead Forge project, and Chartwell Land Developments
Limited, the 54-acre park has broken new ground in that it pulls
together an interesting mix of retail outlets to include a giant
superstore together with industrial facilities and a private housing
development, virtually a self-contained community.
It is anticipated that up to 1500 jobs will be created in the park
and, with the majority of these vacancies being filled locally, the
effect on Drumchapel's unemployment figures should be encouraging.
Following the granting of detailed planning consent for the various
proposals, work started on the provision of site infrastructure and
services at the beginning of last year.
To handle the traffic which will be generated, a spine road was cut
from Great Western Road to Duntreath Avenue.
A new roundabout was installed at the Garscadden Road/Kinfauns Drive
junction and detailled work included the installation of traffic calming
measures on Drumry Road East. These improvements taken together have
been designed to channel existing Bearsden/M ilngavie-Clydebank traffic
onto the development spine road.
On the retail site itself, there is parking for over 1000 cars with
space for another 425 at the adjacent leisure park.
The #40m development has been hailed as a positive indication that the
economy of Glasgow and surrounding areas is on an upward curve, hence
the creation of what will be Britain's largest B&amp;Q store, together with
garden centre.
Other household names attracted to the park include Mecca, Burger
King, Pizza Hut and General George.
According to the developers the primary catchment area, being densely
populated, has an extremely high potential for food and non-food
business, and they are convinced the easy accessibility of the site will
make it the preferred shopping destination within the northern and
western conurbations of the city.
With a 50,000 sq ft light industrial workshop park and up to 100,000
sq ft of strategic light industrial units having been made available,
Great Western Retail and Leisure Park can claim to be among the best
mixed-facility developments in the UK.

THE creation of Great Western Retail Park has meant a spell of frantic
activity for the staff of Drumchapel Opportunities, chaired by
Councillor Charles Gordon.
D O created its own subsidiary, Drumchapel Opportunities Goodyear
Project, to handle everything from initial approaches to incoming
companies, to the guidance and training of local people seeking
employment in the park.
Although the successes achieved to date have been considerable, the
business of securing jobs for people on the Drumchapel Opportunities
books has thrown up its own problems, not least the pressure to produce
suitably trained people within a very short time.
Fingers remain very firmly crossed, but the objective of persuading
incoming employers to recruit at least 50% of their staff locally looks
like being achieved.
Of the businesses already up and running, the project team has placed
73% of the Burger King staff. This follows a 65% success rate with the
#1.4m Whitbread's Brewers Fayre family pub and restaurant, which opened
earlier and employs 46 people.
With Whitbread also scheduled to open a Pizza Hut nearby, there will
be another 50 jobs on offer.
Certainly, the Whitbread management team seem pleased with what they
have got to date, presenting a cheque for #5000 to the local voluntary
organisation, Workwise.
The cash, which is the second donation from Whitbread, will be used to
purchase computer equipment to help young people with learning
difficulties develop the skills necessary to help them find employment.
Meanwhile Drumchapel Opportunities' employer services manager Neil
Boyd is concentrating his efforts on the next phase of operations.
''The success rate so far in getting people into the available jobs
has been tremendous,'' he said. ''We have worked very hard over many
months to strike agreements with employers on the site, our aim being to
get as many of the jobs filled by local people as possible.
''We are now seeing those agreements becoming reality, with Drumchapel
residents taking the lion's share of the positions offered thus far.''
But Mr Boyd acknowledges the need to avoid complacency, stressing that
more people should come forward in order that the project team can
present the widest possible choice of people to employers.
The business of recruitment will go on for some time, with B&amp;Q still
having to fill 200 posts and the likelihood of Mecca requiring another
90 people.
The Drumchapel Opportunities team has a database of some 5000 names,
possibly half of these being ''active'' at any given moment, and this is
used to find people with the specific skills or experience employers are
seeking.
The team members point out that those who don't succeed initially
shouldn't despair, as there will be a second tranche of opportunities
created very soon.
With the arrival of the new Sainsbury's supermarket and associated
filling station, around 1500 vacancies could be offered. This means that
the database will have to be constantly topped up, which is why local
people are being urged to put their names forward now.
But even if Drumchapel Opportunities Goodyear Project team meets and
even exceeds all the targets, there will still be much to do.
The area is almost unique in Scotland in that it is a net importer of
unemployed people, a by-product of the housing situation.
Advice and encouragement is there for people who want to set up in
business on their own. This is never easy, but as the team points out,
around 65% of those who have started their own businesses in the area
over the past two years are still trading -- and that is well above the
national average.

THE closure of the Goodyear Tyre factory in Glasgow's Drumchapel
district stands out in the memory almost as an isolated case of sudden
industrial disaster.
But although the repercussions were devastating, simply because
Goodyear was one of the very few large manufacturing concerns still
operating in the area at the time, its passing could and should have
been predicted, with plans for its replacement drawn up and ready to
swing into action as soon as the doors closed for the last time.
Goodyear was just another manifestation of the ''fashion location''
game that has always been played within the UK motor industry.
In Scotland the industry was already in terminal decline at the time
Goodyear decided it had no option other than to fold its tent.
Chrysler, successors to the Rootes group, had left Linwood to Peugeot
Talbot, who in turn were soon to cut their losses and concentrate all of
their manufacturing in the Coventry area, ''to be nearer our market'' as
a spokesman said at the time.
India Tyres at Inchinnan closed. The factory, ironically listed as
being of architectural interest, now lies in ruins.
Other major casualties of the period included BMC's giant Bathgate
factory, latterly operating under the Leyland banner as one of Britain's
largest truck and tractor manufacturing plants.
Leyland's subsidiary plant, Albion Motors, at Scotstoun, fared rather
better for a while, even riding out the takeover of Leyland by the Dutch
company DAF, albeit with a reduced workforce and a new role as simply an
axle producer.
Ironically Albion, courtesy of a new, dynamic Scottish management
team, not only managed to hang on, but outlived DAF.
Today Albion continues to compete in a fiercely competitive market,
giving the lie to any claim that Scotland is too far from its customers.
So if the closure of Goodyear's Scottish factory was inevitable, so
has been the redevelopment now taking place on the site.
Everything in business -- not just tyres -- goes in cycles.

FOR 15 years the former Goodyear Tyres factory site on Glasgow's Great
Western Road served as a stark, empty reminder to thousands of people,
residents and passers-by alike, of a weakening industrial power base in
the West of Scotland.
It signalled a failure on many fronts, both local and national, to
replace one major employer with another. It could even be argued that
the Goodyear withdrawal didn't just affect those workers whose jobs went
with it, but facilitated a general decline in the area which discouraged
other potential investors from taking up the slack.
As in some parts of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, North-west Glasgow had
to come to terms with the fact that whenever something goes wrong, the
recovery process is likely to be a long drawn-out affair, often with no
guarantee of a permanent cure.
Unemployment in the area crept up to twice the national average,
settling at 21%, but even more disturbing was the fact that almost half
of those on the register had been out of work for a year or more, and
this in spite of a dramatically declining population.
As the shell of the old factory grew ever more ramshackle with the
passage of time, a variety of proposals for the site were put forward.
Some were quite obviously of little substance, simply opportunistic bids
for a valuable piece of ground. Others, with sound financial backing and
clearly viable, were also rejected as promising the ''wrong'' type of
employment prospects.
Official policy was that industry must be replaced by industry, a
stance that became increasingly forlorn as incoming investment tended to
''cluster'' in areas such as Cumbernauld, Glenrothes and Livingston,
where excellent incentives were on offer and related companies were
already in residence.
Competition intensified throughout the 1980s, notably across the river
in Inverclyde, where a vigorous rescue package to replace the loss of
shipbuilding and ship repair work was being put into place with some
spectacular results.
It had become apparent that there would have to be a radical
reappraisal of the Drumchapel site, with a much more flexible attitude
towards future plans for redevelopment. After years of stalemate, this
stretching of the boundaries represented a major breakthrough.
Hence the announcement, last December, that Chartwell Land, which
three months previously had become the first UK property company to be
awarded the ''Investors in People'' standard, and Ramjet Developments
Limited had secured detailed planning consent on the 54-acre site for a
#20m non-food retail scheme, an 18,000 sq ft development set to become
the premier retail park in the North-west of Glasgow.
This would be the first phase in a #40m mixed development proposed by
Ramjet for the former Goodyear site, one which would eventually comprise
a fast food and leisure park, foodstore and petrol filling station,
light industrial workshop units and retail warehouse park.
Chartwell Land's retail warehouse scheme is anchored by B&amp;Q with a
massive 100,000 sq ft store trading as B&amp;Q Warehouse. Other prominent
names taking up to 20,000 sq ft of space include Cantors and Harveys.
Ramjet Developments also received a detailed planning application from
Glasgow City Council for the fast food and leisure park, comprising two
restaurants, a theme pub and a bingo hall, to be built on an adjacent
site.
Clearly delighted with the successful outcome to many months of
negotiation, Nick Light, development director of Chartwell Land, said:
''We are very pleased to have received consent for this important
development, one which promises to bring new life and vitality to the
North-west of Glasgow.''
Ramjet's Paul Green added: ''We are delighted to have Chartwell Land
working with us on the first phase of the Great Western Retail Park,
which will transform the site into a living commercial centre, bringing
substantial new job opportunities to the local workforce.''
Chartwell Land, which will retain the completed development in its
investment portfolio, says the scheme signifies a continuing improvement
in the retail market and insists it is ''fully committed'' to developing
a high-quality facility which will prove a key factor in attracting
further inward investment to the area.
This commitment included finding clients at an impressive rate. By
March of this year work had started in earnest on the Chartwell Land
180,000 sq ft development, the aim being to have it fully operational by
the end of this month. A building contract worth #6m was awarded to AMEC
Construction Scotland Limited.
In addition to the companies already mentioned, some of the traders
taking space include Allied Carpets, trading as General George, World of
Leather and Pet City.
By the end of March, 20,000 sq ft of the final 30,000 sq ft was under
offer, leaving just 10,000 sq ft to be let.
To the locals, the dust kicked up on the site during Glasgow's long
hot summer has signalled an end to years of acrimony and bitter
wrangling, producing instead positive signs of a better future.

CHARTWELL Land is one of the UK's largest specialist retail property
companies.
It has an investment portfolio topping #750m and a new development
programme of approximately 750,000 sq ft with an end value of over
#100m.
Over 90% of the company's investment portfolio is retail property,
with 25% in the retail warehouse sector. This takes in parks at Bristol,
Guildford, Worthing, Northampton and Newcastle.
It now has 700 tenancies with a rent roll exceeding #60m.
Part of Kingfisher plc, Chartwell Land has around 70% rental from
group companies. Kingfisher, of course, owns Woolworth, B&amp;Q, Superdrug
and Comet among other well known retail outlets.
New undertakings include Great Western Retail Park in Glasgow,
together with others in Beckton, Cardiff, Wakefield and Walsall.
This would be more than enough for companies operating on a smaller
scale, but Chartwell Land is still actively looking for new sites for
development.
Operating profits increased by 13% to #48.6m in the year ending
January 1995, these profits making up around 16% of the Kingfisher group
profit for the same period.
It utilises this financial strength and its retail property expertise
to achieve progressive growth in retail income while adding value to its
portfolio.
In what it envisages will be a very different property environment
from that of the 1980s, it is taking steps to maintain above average
growth in rental income while helping to drive property values upwards.
Group tenants naturally include Woolworths, B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Charlie
Browns, which partly explains why the emphasis now is on increasing its
average lot size -- investments in excess of #5m now make up over half
the company's portfolio value.
It describes the Great Western Retail Park as: ''A prime example of
Chartwell Land's needs and benefits matching those of the group rental
companies,'' and describes the result as a successful scheme, housing
B&amp;Q Warehouses' newest Scottish store, pointing out also that 95% of the
park was let before the official opening.
Turn it round anyway you like and the financial picture can only be
described as impressive. Last year the Chartwell Land portfolio expanded
significantly, helped by new purchases of #57m offset by sales of #43m.
There was also a repurchase of property valued at #89m, previously
held off the balance sheet, with a revaluation surplus of #68m.

THE Great Western Road project is the second of two major operations
within the Glasgow city boundary that has helped establish Ramjet
Developments Limited as one of the most innovative and successful
companies of its type currently active in Scotland.
As work was nearing completion earlier this month at Great Western
Road, Ramjet announced the third and final phase of its parallel scheme
at the Forge, Parkhead.
Joining the established retail park and shopping centre which attracts
upwards of 300,000 people each week and supports over 2000 jobs, the
Forge Indoor Market is expected to give another boost to the economy of
the city's East End.
Like GWR, it was created on a former industrial site that had fallen
into decay over a period of years. The 10-acre site has now been
transformed into what is claimed to be Scotland's largest indoor market,
described by manager Andrew Burnett as a facility ''which combines the
popular and traditional atmosphere of an outdoor market with all the
advantages of an indoor shopping environment''.
It has cost #10m to create, but total investment at the Forge is
running closer to #100m, which proves that the retail and leisure
industry sees Glasgow as a bustling, thriving city that will grow in
importance and self-esteem.
Certainly Ramjet Developments believes so, putting #50,000 into the
creation of local job opportunities last week, in addition to several
substantial sums already distributed in both Parkhead and Drumchapel,
mostly without any fuss or trumpet-blowing.
Investment at Great Western Retail and Leisure Park is not yet on this
scale, but it is already in excess of #40m and growing.

THE Scottish Landowners' Federation has told Scottish Office
Agriculture Minister the Earl of Lindsay that the forthcoming White
Paper on Rural Scotland should lay down a series of clear policy
objectives which could be used as the basis for strategic plans.
Graeme Gordon, federation convener, said that the SLF view was that an
integrated approach to land use was paramount in the drawing up of
future rural policy.
At a meeting with Lord Lindsay in Edinburgh representatives of the SLF
emphasised the need for a period of stability while farmers adjusted to
fundamental changes in the European Common Agricultural Policy.
However, in the long term, the federation did not believe that it was
in the best interests of the industry for the present mechanism to
continue, said Mr Gordon.
He underlined the importance of forestry to the Scottish rural economy
and gave notice to the Minister that the federation would be submitting
proposals to the Government requesting that Objective 1 funding from
Europe should be used to support forestry in appropriate areas.
The federation is also anxious to see a reform of the Deer (Scotland)
Act to allow increased flexibility in the management of deer. The
present arrangements were too cumbersome, representatives told the
Minister. The federation wants the Scottish Secretary to be given power
to set the close season by order.
Such a move, it said, would enable the Red Deer Commission to control
numbers more effectively and would provide for the management of deer on
the grounds of natural heritage as well as safeguarding other interests
such as agriculture and forestry.

SENIOR police officers from Strathclyde joined Paisley MP Irene Adams
yesterday to help launch a hard-hitting play on the dangers of Temazepam
abuse.
The MP, who had to cut short a US break last month when she suffered a
mild stroke while visiting New York, revealed she was ''fighting fit
again'' when she went to the town's Ferguslie Park housing estate to
support the new production aimed at schoolchildren.
Mrs Adams, who has been the target of threats because of her stance
against the area's drug barons, said she was delighted to hear the play
-- Dreamtown -- was set to tour secondary schools throughout
Strathclyde.
Dreamtown is being mounted with backing from Govan Initiative's
Theatre Works project.
As cast members met the MP yesterday, police brought along the
Operation Eagle anti-drugs campaign mascot Ziggy to help promote the
play.
After each performance, the audience is invited to discuss topics
raised.
The show will be staged in Ferguslie Park's Tannahill Centre next
Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Strathclyde police have warned drug addicts to take extra
precautions amid fears that two deaths in the Saracen area of Glasgow
were as a result of a contaminated or ''bad'' batch of heroin.
They are awaiting the results of post-mortem examinations on the two
dead men -- Mr Paul Oliver, 22, of Sheildaig Road, Milton, Glasgow, and
Mr Jonathon Scarr, 24, of Cheapside Street, Glasgow.
Mr Oliver's body, found on Tuesday in a derelict building in Byshot
Street, had lain there for at least 24 hours.
Mr Scarr was found also on Tuesday lying beside two other men -- his
brother, Christopher, 22, of Auchengill Road, and Mr Robert Stewart, 17,
of Gartloch Road, Garthamlock, in a lane off Saracen Street.
The two other men both discharged themselves from hospital.

CONFLICTING economic data is a main feature of the debate over
interest rates, as the Governor of the Bank of England pointed out in
his recent speech, when he said he was no longer calling for an
immediate hike.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who yesterday uniquivocally warned that tax
cuts in the Budget were ''not safely in the bag'' has proved to have
most of the ammunition, although in typical fashion he said the only
tensions that actually arise between Eddie George and himself at their
monthly monetary meetings is when one of them is thought to be hogging
the ashtray.
''It gives people a lot of pleasure to portray Eddie George and me as
engaged in some titanic struggle -- a kind of economic Sumo wrestling,''
he said.
The Chancellor was attending the Engineering Employers' Federation. He
told his audience that the slowdown in growth in the economy was simply
a change in the pace of growth to a more sustainable rate, and not a
cause for concern, and said the fundamentals of the economy were very
strong.
However, newly appointed CBI director-general Adair Turner warned in
London that there was a greater risk of further slowdown in the UK
economy than of higher inflation.
He said: ''In this environment it is perhaps more appropriate that the
next move in interest rates is down rather than up.'' But he said any
reduction would have to be sustainable, and acknowledged that while
official statistics show a slowdown in growth, CBI surveys still showed
considerable buoyancy in manufacturing industry.
The Chancellor told the EEF that inflation would be kept down, but
that interest rates would not need to go back to their old heights. He
warned against tax cut expectations, saying that the public expected
from the Government tax cuts that did not put the steady growth we are
currently seeing at risk.
Provisional money supply figures for August, meanwhile, show that M4,
the broad measure taking in lending by the banks and building societies,
picked up more than expected, with an increase in the annual rate to
8.5% from 8% in July.
The minutes of the July 27 monthly monetary meeting between the
Chancellor and Bank Governor, also released yesterday, revealed that the
rise in growth in M4 since February was a worry to both Mr Clarke and Mr
George, who at that time was still espousing the cause of higher
interest rates, which the Chancellor agreed ''was still finely
balanced.''
The money supply growth figures for August were mitigated to some
extent in that bank and building society lending rose by a seasonally
adjusted #2100m -- well down on market projections of approaching #4000m
-- compared with July's #6900m.
Figures from the British Bankers' Association show that sterling
lending to the UK private sector rose by #884m over the month -- well
down on July's #3920m.
The modest rise in borrowing by industry that dates from the beginning
of the year continued in August, but was no sign of any ''upward shift
in gear'', according to Tim Smith, director-general of the BBA. However,
consumer credit grew strongly and mortgage lending had recovered
slightly from the low levels recorded in July, providing some
encouragement.
There depressed state of the mortgage market showed up in the building
society lending figures for August, although there was some up-side.
Gross mortgage lending amounted to #2975m compared with #3220m in July,
although net advances increased to #750m from #729m. Net new commitments
fell to #2726m from #3106m in the previous month.
All told, interest rates will probably remain on hold as the data
unwinds in the next few months ahead of the Budget.

<HEADLINE>Genes 'link' with schizophrenia</HEADLINE>

RESEARCH on Scottish psychiatric patients has produced what is claimed
to be a genetic origin for schizophrenia.
It is the latest link in a chain which Scotia Pharmaceuticals has been
trying to construct for 25 years.
Studies it sponsored by the Highland Psychiatric Research Group at
Craig Dunain Hospital, Inverness, produced the concept, two years ago,
that a large proportion of schizophrenia was a disorder of phospholipid
metabolism -- the breakdown of certain fats in the red blood cells.
Now, Dr David Horrobin, Scotia's founder and chief executive, says the
final studies in his research programme, involving patients in Canada,
have identified a genetic basis for this disorder. It is an abnormality
in the gene for an enzyme which affects the chemical balance of the fat
molecules in cell membranes.
If confirmed, the results could be a major breakthrough in the search
for a treatment for schizophrenia, which affects one in 100 people and
is characterised by disturbances in thinking, emotional reactions, and
behaviour.
Scotia, which is to transfer its headquarters from Surrey to Stirling,
and already has a major manufacturing plant at Callanish on the Isle of
Lewis, has a number of research projects aimed at establishing a link
between lipid biochemistry and a host of diseases.
''Recent work on genetics of colon cancer show that it is also due to
a phospholipase abnormality,'' said Dr Horrobin.
Genes leading to increased risk of breast and other cancers, diabetes,
immunological abnormalities, and brain defects were also related to
phospholipid and metabolism, he said.
He admitted that the scientific world would be sceptical for some time
about his evidence, which would show that most cases of severe
schizophrenia were caused by a genetic defect causing too much of an
enzyme called phospholipase-A2.
One drawback is the likelihood that such a disorder might be expected
to produce other symptoms elsewhere in the body.
However, Dr Horrobin said: ''Relatives of schizophrenics show higher
than expected frequencies of diabetes, arthritis, cancer, asthma, and
inflammatory and allergic diseases in general, suggesting that the gene
may contribute to the risk of developing these conditions.
''They all have a strong genetic component which can be profoundly
affected by environment factors. Membrane lipid biochchemistry may be
the main point at which genetic and environmental factors interact.''

BRITAIN is considering hosting the world's two biggest sports events
early in the new millenium -- the World Cup in 2006, and the Olympic
Games in 2008.
The Football Association last night declined to comment on, but did
not deny, a report indicating they are ready to bid for the 2006 World
Cup if next year's European Championships are a success.
The World Cup will be back in Europe that year as the finals are
scheduled for France in 1998, and for an African country for the first
time four years later.
Such aspirations will come under particularly intense scrutiny by
FIFA. Any England bid is at the mercy of soccer hooligans, whose
potential impact on next year's European finals has already sounded
alarm bells.
The British Olympic Association, meanwhile, today is expected to heed
an International Olympic Committee warning, and apply for the 2008
Games, rather than 2004. The aspirations of the BOA and FA will rely
heavily on the response to Wembley's launch today of plans to use
lottery cash to build a new national stadium.
Following successive failures by Birmingham (1992) and Manchester
(1996 and 2000), IOC insiders warned Britain a fourth bid would be
impolitic.
Advice is that only a London bid holds prospects of success, but with
not one Olympic standard venue, the city needs time to mount a credible
bid. Approval of Wembley would be a declaration of intent.
BOA chairman Craig Reedie declined to prejudge today's decision, but
confirms: ''We will consider the lessons of Birmingham and Manchester.''
The BOA yesterday launched an appeal to raise #4m from the public and
industry to send teams to next year's Games in Atlanta and the 1998
Winter Games in Nagano. The appeal, headed by Geoffrey Maitland-Smith,
deputy chairman of the Midland Bank, is crucial. The UK Government,
uniquely worldwide, does not fund its national Olympic movement.

ONE of the Ibrox heroes of the week, not for the first time,
goalkeeper Andy Goram, yesterday reflected on what the 1-0 defeat of
Celtic on Tuesday means to the club, writes Ian Paul.
''It is all very well talking about the European Cup and all that, but
the Old Firm game is still the one to win. That sets us up for
Dortmund.''
The Scotland keeper admitted he took pride in making his own
contribution to what he believes was a great performance by Rangers. ''I
felt that was the best way to answer everybody after the criticism we
got when we lost in Bucharest.''
Goram insisted he was not playing down the disappointment of the
defeat by Steaua Bucharest. ''We know we didn't do ourselves justice
there but we did play a bit better against Celtic. It is always good to
get a performance like that when you are going into a European tie next
week.
''There are no two ways about it, we have to beat Dortmund and it will
take an effort all round like at Parkhead to do it.''
Goram pointed out that the defensive record of his team so far has
been outstanding. They have lost three goals in nine competitive games,
two of them when they lost concentration against Stirling Albion in the
last round of the Coca-Cola Cup, and he reckons that is their best start
for a long time.
Goram, who has played in a fair number of Old Firm meetings now,
reckoned the new men in the Ibrox line-up coped well with the
experience. ''They might think it is easy now but the test will come
when we lose to Celtic. Hopefully that won't be for a long time.''
He was also quick to join in the accolades dished out liberally to
goal-scorer Ally McCoist. ''He has a gift for getting goals like that.
Some people will say it is luck but he has done it far too often for
that to be right. Long may it continue.
''Ally and I have been out for long spells and I think we both feel we
have something to prove. But you can't single out one or two men when
you win at Parkhead. It has to be a team effort.''

EXCLUSIVE:
CELTIC and Scotland midfield star John Collins has ended the
speculation which has surrounded his future since the Scottish Cup
final. I understand the player has now told the Parkhead club he wishes
to leave, a decision which was made known to manager Tommy Burns before
the recent cruel run of fixtures that the Glasgow giants were forced to
play.
It was kept under wraps by the club for the obvious reason that no-one
wanted anything to divert the team's thoughts from the four-match spell
which climaxed in the narrow Coca-Cola Cup defeat by Rangers on Tuesday
night.
I believe there is anger inside the club about statements attributed
to the player's agent, Raymond Sparkes, on the eve of the first Old Firm
game of the season. Sparkes said then: ''We wouldn't be party to
anything which affected the club's short-term ambitions with regards to
the Rangers tie. But once it is over we can think about sitting down
with Fergus McCann and Tommy Burns to see where we go from here. We hope
to bring this to a conclusion one way or another as soon as possible.''
These remarks sparked a fresh wave of speculation, and it is a problem
with which manager Burns has been forced to deal since the end of last
season. There were strong suggestions then, from the midfield player
himself, that the triumphant Scottish Cup final at Hampden could have
been his last match for Celtic. Collins, though, despite a #2.25m bid
from Middlesbrough, remained at Celtic Park and silent on his ambitions.
Now he has told Celtic he wishes to leave.
It will take a considerably larger bid than the one Middlesbrough have
made to move the player. Celtic will want in excess of #3m to allow
Collins to move into the English Premiership.
Middlesbrough retain their interest, while Queens Park Rangers and
Chelsea could also come for the man who has played a key role in
Scotland's European Championship campaign.

Dundee 4, Hearts 4
After extra time. 90min 3-3. Dundee won 5-4 on penalties.
DUNDEE won a penalty shoot-out at Dens Park last night to go through
to the semi-finals of the Coca-Cola Cup.
In a quarter-final drenched in drama, Hearts crashed out of the
tournament after having clawed their way back into the game on three
separate occasions.
But, as their support travelled home, they must have been questioning
the eccentricities of veteran goalkeeper Henry Smith.
It was Smith who gifted Dundee their third goal during the regulation
90 minutes just after Hearts had levelled the scores for the first time,
at 2-2.
Then it was Smith who became a penalty save hero when he stopped
Dundee's third attempt in the shoot-out from Paul Tosh.
Moments later Smith opted to take the Edinburgh side's next kick,
blasted a shot off target, and allowed Dundee back into the match.
That glimpse of victory was enough for the Dens Park players. Ian
Anderson, Jim Duffy, and Morten Wieghorst scored from the next three
kicks, John Robertson had scored one for Hearts but Willie Jamieson had
joined Smith by missing.
Wieghorst's kick was the one which brought Dundee victory.
That goal sparked off a crowd invasion and then, later, a lap of
honour for the triumphant Dundee team.
The celebrations in the stands must, however, have been tinged with
relief after Dundee had lived so dangerously and come desperately close
to losing out on a last-four place in the competition.
They had gone two goals in front before half-time -- and had deserved
to be in control.
Both strikes arrived inside a two-minute spell.
Nine minutes before half-time George Shaw moved on to a pass from Tosh
before striking a low, angled shot beyond Smith and into the far corner
of the net.
Two minutes later the same player struck again after Wieghorst slipped
a free kick down the left-hand side of the penalty box for Neil McCann.
The winger crossed and, while Jim Hamilton's shot was blocked, Shaw
appeared to ram a low shot into goal.
There were obviously harsh words spoken in the Hearts dressing-room at
half time. Indeed, after the match, manager Jim Jefferies revealed: ''I
read the riot act to the players at half-time. There were strong words
and I meant every one of them. The first-half performance was shocking.
It is not up to players to decide when they are going to play and
something will be done about that if that attitude continues.''
His words worked -- for a time. In 54 minutes a free kick from John
Colquhoun found Dave McPherson, who powered a header into the net. The
centre-half struck a post with another header and in 74 minutes Hearts
drew level when Colquhoun scored from close range.
Said Jefferies afterwards: ''At 2-2 we were going on to win the game
until Henry Smith blundered. The goal was comical, just bad
professionalism.''
Jefferies was right, Smith mis-hit a clearance, sent the ball straight
to Tosh, and the Dundee striker blasted his side back into the lead.
Now it looked as if Dundee were heading for victory until, with just a
minute left, Alan Lawrence burst into the box to level things once more.
On, then, to extra time and within five minutes Wieghorst strolled
past two tackles, looked up, then sent a shot soaring beyond Smith and
into goal for what will be a candidate for strike of the season.
Yet again Hearts forced their way back into the match.
In 107 minutes Lawrence went down when challenged by Neil Duffy and
referee Les Mottram gave a penalty and Robertson scored.
The final scenario arrived with the penalties, with another blunder
from Smith, a miss by Jamieson, and Wieghorst's decider.
Now Dundee, who may have lost touch with Dunfermline in the
first-division promotion race, are in today's draw for the semi-finals
of the Coca-Cola Cup.
There were seven bookings during the game -- Wieghorst, Hamilton, Tony
McQueen, and Duffy of Dundee and David Hagen, Robertson, and Gary Locke
of Hearts.
DUNDEE -- Pageaud, Farningham, McQueen, Cargill, Wieghorst, N Duffy,
Shaw, Vrto, Tosh, Hamilton, McCann. Substitutes -- Anderson, Bain, J
Duffy.
HEARTS -- Smith, Locke, Winnie, Berry, McPherson, Hamilton, Colquhoun,
McKay, Robertson, Hagen, Lawrence. Substitutes -- Jamieson, Leitch,
Nelson.
Referee -- L Mottram (Forth).

By IAN PAUL:
Motherwell 1, Aberdeen 2
(after extra time)
AT LEAST the winners made it through this Coca-Cola Cup quarter-final
without having to go through the dreaded shoot-out, although Motherwell
fans would willingly have settled for that rather than the knockout goal
from Aberdeen's John Inglis five minutes from the end of extra time.
That was enough to decide a game that had kept almost 10,000 watchers
fascinated. The quality of play might have been better, but the
excitement would have been hard to top. It may be a cliche, but it was
nonetheless the case that it was a shame someone had to lose.
Nobody could have asked for more from either team as the tie, frantic
though it was, fluctuated from one to another, with Aberdeen the more
adventurous but Motherwell the more penetrating.
A delighted and perhaps relieved Aberdeen manager, Roy Aitken, said
afterwards: ''After we lost the goal I thought we dominated and I think
we deserved to win. If we can ally that desire and determination to our
passing game we'll start to go places. That's what we need to do to get
this club challenging for all the prizes. Getting into the semi-final is
a great bonus.''
Goal scorer Inglis reckoned his winner was the most important score of
his career to date but, naturally, Motherwell manager Alex McLeish saw
it a bit differently.
''I felt it was a soft goal for us to lose but overall I cannot
criticise my players apart from a couple of wee things which we will
have to work on if we want to get into semi-finals and compete at the
top regularly. Still, it was a great game.''
The home team had taken the lead after six minutes when the
irrepressible Doug Arnott, who had scored in two previous rounds, beat
Michael Watt and it took Aberdeen all of 51 minutes to nullify that with
an equaliser, albeit a marvellous volley, by Billy Dodds.
From then on it was always going to be a battle to the end, with the
ferocity of play increasing with every minute that passed. Eventually,
after Motherwell had been denied a sound looking claim for a penalty in
the last minute of the regulation 90, it was on into the twilight zone
of extra time and Inglis' big moment.
It was an unexpected and uncharacteristic mistake by Stewart McKimmie
which gave Motherwell the lead and lifted the tie into top gear. The
international full back, perhaps unsighted, headed a free kick from
Jamie Dolan across the front of his own goal and Arnott, lurking in the
right place as ever, gratefully shot home from a few yards out.
That was in six minutes and completed Motherwell's first attack worth
the description, but they very nearly made it two with their next raid
when Rob McKinnon made room for a shot which went narrowly over the bar.
After less than half an hour, Motherwell had to put on a substitute,
Billy Davies, for McKinnon who had suffered a hamstring injury. Dolan
was booked for a blatant body check on Woodthorpe, an indication perhaps
that the Pittodrie side were gaining the upper hand.
However, Gary Smith had his name taken, too, after the linesman
reported an off-the-ball infringement to referee Kenny Clark.
Glass was the fourth man to have his name taken for a foul on Lambert
but the Aberdeen man made amends in 57 minutes when he sent over a deep
cross which Dodds met on the volley to steer high into the net to put
his team all square.
Davies tried a disguised lob from 20 yards but it failed to deceive
Watt and then a hard low Roddie cross went behind a trio of Motherwell
attackers just inside the penalty area. With six minutes left Abderdeen
put on Duncan Shearer for Glass, but despite some frantic escapes and
loud claims by Motherwell for a penalty when Coyne went down after a
tackle by Inglis, which the referee ignored, both teams had to take a
deep breath and go into overtime.
In the 101st minute, Motherwell replaced a tired Arnott with Alex
Burns.
However, the final breakthrough came five minutes from the end of it
all when John Inglis headed in a corner from Miller.
MOTHERWELL -- Howie, May, McKinnon, Philliben, Martin, McCart,
Lambert, Dolan, Coyne, Arnott, McSkimming. Substitutes -- Davies,
Roddie, Burns.
ABERDEEN -- Watt, McKimmie, Woodthorpe, Hetherston, Inglis, Smith,
Miller, Jess, Booth, Dodds, Glass. Substitutes -- Shearer, Stillie,
Christie.
Referee -- K W Clark (Paisley).

THE Ryder Cup again will consist of four foursomes and four fourball
matches tomorrow and Saturday, followed by 12 singles on Sunday. In
foursomes, two team-mates hit alternate shots with the same ball, while
in fourballs they both play each hole and the lower score counts.
Between 1927 and 1959, matches comprised four foursomes and eight
singles, all played over 36 holes. Play was reduced to 18 holes in 1961
and comprised two series of four foursomes and two series of eight
singles, making 24 points at stake.
For the next match, two series of fourballs were added and the clash
became a three-day affair rather than two.
In 1977 it was changed to five foursomes, five fourballs and 10
singles, but that was altered again in 1979 to the present format where
28 points are up for grabs.

Bernard Gallacher, the European Ryder Cup captain, guides you
hole-by-hole round Oak Hill
1, Challenge, 440yd, par 4.
The toughest opening hole in Ryder Cup golf since we played the 1973
match at Muirfield in Scotland. What you do with your tee shot is
critical to how you end up scoring at the hole. You certainly don't have
the chance to ease your way in gently at Oak Hill.
2, Breather, 401yd, par 4.
The tee shot must be hit left to right -- unlike the ideal shape for
the opening drive. Distance is less critical than position so some
players may leave their drivers in the bag, preferring instead to use a
No.3 wood or No.1 iron.
3, Pines, 202yd, par 3.
Even professionals find the required shot -- a long iron hit high --
difficult, but that is what you need at this hole. The tee is elevated
and not many people will be through the green at a hole which is played
uphill. This could even be a No.3 wood if the wind is against.
4, High and Mighty, 570yd, par 5.
The longer hitters will definitely go for the carry over the bunkers
on the inside of the dog-leg but the carry is enormous. There is trouble
at a green designed to take a very precise wedge approach shot. Look for
some tough pin positions.
5, Double Trouble, 406yd, par 4.
The reward for a long tee shot here is that you will be going with a
shorter iron over the creek into a small and very severe green that
slopes from back to front. The problem is that the drive is tight. In
the 1980 US PGA championship this was the toughest hole on the course,
and at the 1989 US Open it was the second toughest.
6, Pin Point, 167yd, par 3.
A medium-length short hole where birdies are very possible if you get
your clubbing right to the elevated green. This is where there were four
holes-in-one in two hours at the 1989 US Open. The ace quartet were Mark
Wiebe, Doug Weaver, Nick Price, and Jerry Pate.
7, Creek's Elbow, 431yd, par 4.
Once again the tee shot is crucial. From the tee you cannot see the
fairway, but you have to hit it with a driver to make the uphill second
shot easier. There are trees on both sides and Allen's Creek, which has
already crossed the first, fifth, and sixth, comes into play again.
8, Wayside, 426yd, par 4.
The easiest hole on the front nine. If you do land in the fairway
bunkers off the tee you can still reach the flattish green from the
sand. A note of warning, though: at the 1980 US PGA there were three
times as many bogeys as birdies.
9, Needle's Eye, 419yd, par 4.
You must take a driver to get past the dog-leg at this challenging
hole. Push the shot (or pull in left-hander Phil Mickelson's case) and
you are dead. The line is left centre of the fairway, from where you
will at least be able to see the top of the flag.
10, Council Grove, 429yd, par 4.
The players will slide their tee shots off the left-hand fairway trap
-- the only thing you can see as you stand on the tee. If you miss the
fairway you will have to lay up short of Allen's Creek.
11, Waterfall, 192yd, par 3.
There is a neck of green to the left on this hole, which is well
guarded by bunkers. You can be sure it will be well used to provide
several tough pin positions.
12, Leaning Oak, 372yd, par 4.
This hole is a bit easier, but the green slopes from front to back.
Players will make sure they are up with their second shots -- there is a
dip immediately in front of the putting surface -- but will hope to spin
back down past the pin to leave themselves with an uphill birdie chance.
13, Hill of Fame, 598yd, par 4.
This is the longest hole on the course. Even big-hitters will not be
able to go for it in two because they will be concerned about Allen's
Creek, which crosses the fairway at about 300 yards. They may even use a
No.3 wood off the tee. The Hill of Fame is so-called because many of the
trees carry plaques honouring great names in golfing history.
14, Bunker Hill, 323yd, par 4.
As is the case so often, it is critical to hit the fairway down in the
valley. The second shot is only a wedge to another green that slopes
back to front and has three bunkers fronting it.
15, Plateau, 184yd, par 3.
Depending on the position of the pin, the shot needs to be shaped to
help you hold the green because the putting surface slopes right to left
away from the pond towards the bunkers. Jack Nicklaus holed-in-one here
on his way to winning the 1980 US PGA.
16, Straightaway, 439yd, par 4.
This is the breather before you have to face up to Oak Hill's two
tough closing holes. The downhill fairway should not be too tough to
hit, even if the rough has been allowed to grow in a bit.
17, Twin Tees, 458yd, par 4.
You have no option but to take the driver in order to get over the
hill and up to the dog-leg to be in position to see and go for the green
with your second, which is also a very demanding test.
18, Goin' Home, 445yd, par 4.
The real difficulty here is the narrow elevated green, but in order to
have a real chance of hitting it and getting near the hole you do need a
long drive. It can be a medium or even long iron, but in the 1989 US
Open Ian Woosnam hit the green with a No.8-iron second and finished
joint runner-up.

IT might have been seen as just a fixture involving a club side and a
school but the match at the Greenyards a week last Saturday between
Melrose Wasps and Fettes College which resulted in a 28-3 win for the
Melrosians was all about a radical change in thinking of rugby at school
level.
The Melrose Wasps team was de facto the Earlston High School first XV
bolstered by only one under 18 -- a prop -- from the Melrose club. What
has emerged is a collaboration between Earlston High and Melrose that
aims to improve the standard of under-18 rugby and, in the process, end
the potentially damaging situation of youngsters playing for both school
and club often on the same day.
''It was often the case that boys could play up to sixty games a
year,'' said Don Ledingham, head of physical education at Earlston High
whose enlightened thinking is beginning to transform school and youth
rugby in the central Borders.
But the real reason for this new approach is to expose Earlston High
players to quality rugby. Ledingham, a former South of Scotland wing and
Scotland trialist, contends that a school is only as good as its fixture
list. ''One of the reasons that the independent schools are so strong is
that their fixtures are strong.
''As a result their boys are used to playing competitive matches
week-in week-out.
''That, of course, is the rationale behind the restructuring of the
leagues at senior level,'' avers Ledingham who thinks that you can
measure your skill level only against the best.
Earlston High have dropped a number of their fixtures to be able to
play against several of the leading public schools.
For these matches they will play as Melrose Wasps, fielding a side
composed of the best from school and club under-18s.
Ledingham feels too that success at first XV level will have a
knock-on effect thoughout Earlston High. That already appears to be
happening. This season Earlston High will field two teams per year and
in the senior school first, second, and third XVs.
Fortunately for Ledingham, it is not a one man show. Alastair Kidd,
from the physical education department, coaches the second and
third-year teams, and there is assistance from Sandy Bruce, the head of
mathematics, and Dick Stuart, a biologist.
Crucially, there is considerable support and practical involvement
from parents, albeit that Earlston High is in an area where rugby is
deeply embedded in the local culture.

GERMAN OPEN
SCOTLAND'S Dale Reid has returned from America after missing the last
two American Express Tour events to tee off in the Maredo Open at
Treudelberg in Hamburg today.
After coming safely through the preliminary test at Mission Hills in
California to book her place in next month's LPGA qualifying school Reid
resumes her quest for a first victory in four years. It rankles her that
Laura Davies has passed her Tour record 21 victories, a situation that
prompted her to turn to the LPGA Tour.
''I need a new challenge and more competitive golf,'' said the
Ladybank golfer.
Marie-Laure de Lorenzi from France, winner of the Dutch Open last
Sunday, her second win of the season, can overtake Davies and move to
the top of the standings list with a third success this week.

ACCORDING to Stuart Cosgrove's Off the Ball on BBC Radio Scotland two
weeks ago, the first words Maurice Johnston uttered when he heard that
rugby was going professional were: ''The only team I ever wanted to play
for is . . . Boroughmuir.'' It was a joke, of course.
The word ''agent'' in the Collins Concise Dictionary is: ''A person
who acts on behalf of another person . . . '', but, as we all know, it
means so much more than that. It was Johnston's agent, Bill McMurdo, who
helped him through the various phases of that famous scenario, a
scenario that has helped the Falkirk player to make a vast amount of
money over his career.
Ever since the announcement was made that rugby is to be professional,
even allowing for the final ratification that has still to come in
Tokyo, there would appear to have been a clamour from a good few to be
considered as rugby agents. I know that Ian Doyle, Stephen Hendry's
agent/business manager/guru, has courted some of the players; Gavin
Hastings has thrown his hat firmly in the ring and I also know that he
is working to get some of them even though the establishment would
believe otherwise; and that wily fox McMurdo, a man who has been round
the block a few times in contract negotiations, was there the other week
at GHK doing a ''fact finding'' mission. In other words, McMurdo is
firmly in the market, as his article for a Sunday paper indicated two
weeks ago. Ian McLauchlan is, though, the players' agent just now.
You see, and I have it from some players on this one, the SRU think
that the only way that other agents will get in on the act is if
transfer fees start happening between clubs in rugby. Yes, Fred McLeod
is openly considering the possibility of clubs paying transfer fees,
would you believe that? He recognises that once that happens a variety
of agents must come on board because McLauchlan can't act for all
parties.
At the moment the SRU, and many in the rugby establishment, fondly
think that they have the power in their grasp on this one because they
are dealing with Mighty Mouse alone, and through him the players.
But I just don't see how they don't take a look at football and take a
sharp intake of breath to realise that rugby must now become a smaller,
and, yes, possibly tamer, version of football. What I mean by this is
that the problem that will arrive more quickly than a speeding train is
that the international arena won't provide the major part of the money
earned by our best rugby players. It's inevitable that other sources of
money will become far more important to them than their earnings from
the SRU.
For instance: Whoever now becomes the goal kicker for Scotland, and I
hope they have all been practising, will be able to get a boot deal
worth 10 times as much as the next highest profile players in the side.
As an individual, he will get that.
However, and I have even heard McLauchlan say so in the past, while
everyone happily sniffs at the paying power of the clubs, they will be
the ones who, in a relatively short time, will pay the players the most.
Just like football, you have to play for a big club to get the big
salaries and the big endorsements and the big sponsored cars and the odd
game for Scotland. There aren't too many Partick Thistle players in the
Scotland team and there aren't too many millionaires there either.
McLeod's statement that there will be transfer fees in Scottish club
rugby merely proves the point, I think, that the clubs will pay good
money for a good player.
So whichever agent can get hold of a pool of players and start to hold
some clubs to ransom for their services, which is what effectively
happens in football, will be the richest agent. These boys all work for
their percentage, and that's not really a problem for a player who knows
that his agent, less the commission, is still earning him more than
someone else's agent.
Or so the logic goes anyway.
I have it from a national squad player that the question of outside
agents was aired at their meeting with the SRU on Sunday, and the
players themselves think that there is no way that the SRU will be able
to control the top boys in the squad using them if they want to.
Whatever, there are going to be some rumpuses along the way between
clubs, agents and players very soon. Craig Chalmers is kicking well, I
see. I wonder what kind of a boot deal he has lined up. Oh, and by the
way, how much is a top-form Chalmers worth to a club in this desperate
season? It's an interesting question. And I bet there are a few agents
around who would like to try to help him find the answer.

Torrance, Montgomerie engage in merry banter.
THE very rarity of team golf goes some way towards explaining the
appeal of the Ryder Cup match. Even more of an exception is the
influence which a personal and detached duel far removed from the
emotions and turmoil of the biennial encounter between Europe and the
United States might have on a side's performance.
Currently Sam Torrance and Colin Montgomerie are locked in a mortal
combat. Torrance leads the Volvo order of merit with #619,138, including
three victories among his 23 tournaments, and Montgomerie is second,
having earned #590,056 from two successes in 17 appearances. For very
different reasons each is ambitious to finish ahead of his rival.
Torrance, at 42, the oldest of the European side and in his
twenty-fifth season, was second in 1984, his highest finish.
Montgomerie aged 32 and in his ninth campaign, has led the table for
the last two years and would be the first player since Seve Ballesteros
in 1978 to win the title for the third consecutive time.
There are now only three tournaments left in which the issue will be
resolved -- the European Open, the German Masters, and the Volvo Masters
-- and since Costantino Rocca, in third place, is almost #158,000 behind
Montgomerie the likelihood that he or anyone else will intrude on the
two Scots' private party must be remote.
Before they set out under grey and drizzling skies for another
reconnaissance of Oakhill, where play in the thirty-first match in the
series will begin tommorrow morning, both Torrance and Montgomerie spoke
of the encouragement they felt they had given the 10 other members of
the team with their form of the past two or three months.
Montgomerie expanded on this theme: ''I think we help each other by
the way we've been keeping going and that's done something for the
confidence of the side.''
Then he joked: ''When I win, he's second; when he wins, I'm seventh.''
''Long may that continue,'' Torrance responded.
''Dream on,'' Montgomerie countered.
Torrance, appearing in his eighth successive match, referred to the
value of experience of the event -- new to only two of the Europeans,
Philip Walton and Per-Ulrik Johansson but to five of the Americans.
''This is a high-tension event,'' Torrance added, ''but we are
professionals and we can allow for that and use it to our advantage.''
As Torrance observed, probably reflecting on his unhappy week of two
years ago when a foot injury restricted his games to one in the opening
foursomes: ''The worst time is when you're not playing, just watching.
That's when you become more nervous.''
So far enforced idleness has been decidedly absent from Montgomerie's
two matches.
In them he has played in nine of a possible 10 games and Montgomerie
would be delighted if Bernhard Gallacher again called on him to complete
the maximum.
''I feel I'm playing quite well,'' Montgomerie declared. ''You like to
be out there and battle, but it's the captain's decision and whether
Nick (Faldo) and I are ever to be rested.''
Expectations of the outcome are invariably higher among spectators
than the players, a sense of which was given by both.
Torrance said: ''You expect only to play your best and see what
happens. Montgomerie concluded: ''We are confident, because we feel that
if we do the best we can we have another chance of winning.''
It would surely take a bold captain or a surgical operation, to
separate Montgomerie and Faldo and, sure enough, when the Europeans
reacquainted themselves with foursomes golf -- or alternate shot, as
they are inclined to say here -- they were still together. So, too, were
Bernhard Langer and Ian Woosnam, and Torrance and Walton, and perhaps
they are now settled partnerships at least for openers.
Gallacher otherwised reshuffled his pack. Ballesteros had under his
wing Johansson. Mark James and Rocca were paired as were Howard Clark
and David Gilford. On the promissory of these match-ups, reading tea
leaves would seem an easier proposition than Gallacher's mind.
Similarly, the spectators again out in remarkable numbers in spite of
deteriorating weather, could make what they would of the partnerships
sent out in fourball games by the American captain, Lanny Wadkins. With
so high a proportion of his players without previous experience of the
occasion he would seem to have more thinking to do.
Wadkins does not expect to pair any two of this quintet in the first
morning's foursomes or even in the later fourballs although yesterday
Phil Mickelson, the first left-hander to represent the United States,
accompanied Jeff Maggert. The three others had old hands on their reins
-- Tom Lehman with the US Open champion, Corey Pavin, Brad Faxon with
Peter Jacobsen, and Loren Roberts with Davis Love.
For what disclosing these and the other formations may ultimately be
worth, Fred Couples and Jay Haas played alongside Curtis Strange and the
Master champion, Ben Crenshaw.

HOME INTERNATIONALS
SCOTLAND slipped to an opening 8[1/2]-6[1/2] defeat by Ireland in the
home internationals at Royal Portrush.
Though Barclay Howard and Alan Turnbull completed a sucessful morning
foursomes outing with a tense one-hole win against Ken Kearney and Gary
Murphy, the 43-year-old said he was struggling to overcome the effects
of Great Britain and Ireland's Walker Cup win at Royal Porthcawl.
He added an afternoon singles victory against the former Irish
champion, but admitted: ''It's incredible. Normally I would have come to
this event pumped up and raring to go. But I'm afraid it all feels like
an anti-climax after the drama of the Walker Cup. It is difficult to get
myself motivated.''
Ireland's feted foursomes pairing of Jody Fanagan and Padraig
Harrington were unbeaten in that triumph a fortnight ago, yet were
beaten on their home turf yesterday. Against Gordon Sherry and Graham
Rankin, they lost by 2 and 1.
With a cooling breeze on a glorious day across these immaculate Antrim
links, the rookie pairing of Alan Reid and Craig Watson gelled to record
a similar winning margin over Brian Omelia and Eamonn Brady, a nephew of
former Celtic manager Liam.
However, in the afternoon singles ties it all went horribly wrong as
Scotland surrendered comfortable leading positions in five of the 10
matches, the worst by Scottish Amateur champion Simon MacKenzie, who
blew a four-hole lead to Fanagan to lose by one hole.
Holders England were beaten by Wales, also by 8[1/2]-6[1/2]. Ireland v
Scotland details:
Foursomes -- J Fanagan (Milltown) and P Harrington (Stackstown) lost
to G Sherry (Kilmarnock Barassie) and G Rankin (Palacerigg), 2 and 1; K
Nolan (Bray) and G McGimpsey (Bangor) halved with S Gallacher (Bathgate)
and S MacKenzie (West Linton); B Omelia (Newlands) and E Brady (Royal
Dublin) lost to A Reid (Kilmarnock Barassie) and C Watson (East
Renfrewshire), 2 and 1; J Morris (Douglas) and P Murray (Tipperary) beat
M Brooks (Carluke) and H McKibbin (Troon Welbeck), 1 hole; K Kearney (Co
Sligo) and G Murphy (Kilkenny) lost to B Howard (Cochrane Castle) and A
Turnbull (Innerleithen), 1 hole.

Livingston 2, Queen's Park 0
A GOAL each from Livingston skipper Gordon McLeod and Grant McMartin
made it five wins out of five for Jim Leishman's men.
A McMartin corner found its way to an unmarked McLeod who stroked the
ball past Chalmers for Livingston's first in 78 minutes. McMartin sealed
the victory in the final minute when he raced through to slide the ball
underneath Chalmers.
Livingston could have paid dearly for a slip-up by Stoute in 19
minutes when the Barbadian goalkeeper was caught in possession after a
pass-back, but Ferguson blasted the ball over the bar.
LIVINGSTON -- Stoute, Williamson, Duthie, Davidson, Graham, McLeod,
McMartin, Bailey, Young, Smart, Sinclair. Substitutes -- Sorbie, Harvey,
Callaghan.
QUEEN'S PARK -- Chalmers, Graham, Ferguson, McGrath, Elder, Maxwell,
McInally, Arbuckle, Edgar, McPhee, McGoldrick. Substitutes -- Callan,
McCusker, Brodie.
Referee -- G Evans (Bishopbriggs).

BRITISH golf followers who may have hoped the televising of the next
two Ryder Cup matches would revert to the BBC, thus attracting the wider
audience assured by terrestrial coverage, will be disappointed that
these encounters between Europe and the United States have been secured
exclusively by Sky Television, writes Raymond Jacobs.
In a statement claiming ''the biggest agreement in European golf
history,'' the Ryder Cup Joint Venture, comprising the PGA European Tour
and the Professional Golfers Association, announced a package with Sky
which includes the 1997 match at Valderrama, Spain, and the 1999 event
at The Country Club, Brookline, near Boston.
The package agreement also will extend the satellite channel's
coverage of the Europe Tour to include exclusive broadcasts of 26
tournaments, each season from 1997 to the year 2000. Ken Schofield, the
Tour's executive director commented: ''The commitment made by Sky is
unprecedented.''
Meanwhile the BBC, which alone sustained golf coverage for more than
10 years after ITV withdrew their interest, will still relay the Open
Championship, the Toyota World Matchplay championship, the Volvo PGA
championship, the Benson and Hedges Tournament, the British Masters and,
every other year, the Walker Cup.
Sky, which will have 30 hours of live screening over the three days of
the Ryder Cup match beginning tomorrow, has expanded its golf coverage
from 100 hours in 1991 to nearly 1200 hours this season.

Airdrie 1, Partick Thistle 1
After extra time. 90min 1-1. Airdrie won 3-2 on penalties.
CUP specialists Airdrie did it again at Broadwood last night as they
won through to the Coca-Cola Cup semi-finals after a dramatic penalty
shootout which matched any of their previous exploits in the hunt for a
trophy.
And once again goalkeeper John Martin was the hero and he must be
relieved because in the early part of the match he lost a bizarre goal
when Wayne Foster scored from all of 40 yards.
That goal was cancelled out before half-time by Jim McIntyre and
although Airdrie should have had the match tied up within the 90 minutes
they were forced into extra time and then through the agonies of a
sudden death shootout.
While Thistle keeper Nicky Walker managed to save one of the Airdrie
penalties from Paul Jack, Martin went one better saving twice, from
Thistle captain Albert Craig and then from Harry Curran. Derek
McWilliams also missed for Airdrie, hitting the underside of the bar.
The Thistle successes from the spot were Calum Milne and Foster while
Jimmy Boyle, Paul Harvey, and McIntyre were all on the mark for the home
side.
Airdrie set off the much more positive side with McIntyre, in
particular, looking dangerous and comfortable in a wide role.
But it was Thistle, right out of the blue, who struck the first blow
in 19 minutes. It was a remarkable goal which must have had Martin
blushing a deep red.
There appeared to be absolutely no danger when Foster picked up the
ball near the left touchline and all of 40 yards from goal.
But, with Martin off his line, the Thistle striker sent what looked
like no more than a hopeful punt towards goal.
The keeper appeared to watch it all the way but, as it drifted past
him, he could only get a despairing touch to the ball on its way to the
back of the net.
The Thistle hero was booked a couple of minutes later for backing into
Sweeney, his third caution in the last three matche.
Pittman, who had been injured in the opening seconds, eventually had
to come off, being replaced by Curran.
Then, in 36 minutes, Airdrie's battling qualities brought them a just
reward in the shape of the equaliser.
Harvey, out on the right, spotted McIntyre moving in behind the
defence and sent over a perfect cross which the striker headed
powerfully past Walker.
Jack became the second booking for pulling back Milne and McIntyre's
name followed his into the book when he rather petulantly booted the
ball away after a move had broken down.
Thistle showed a bit more urgency in the second half with Welsh and
McWilliams coming close but Airdrie still looked dangerous and in 70
minutes Davies almost put them ahead with a spectacular volley which
dipped and swerved past Walker's right-hand post.
And so, to extra time, with Curran providing a thrilling start by
shooting inches past, at the other end, Walker again pulled off an
excellent save from Davies.
McDonald replaced McKee after 96 minutes but still Airdrie looked the
likelier side and were desperately unlucky after 104 minutes when a
Cooper header smacked off the bar.
Watson was then booked for a foul on Stewart, who had to be replaced
by Smith, and seconds from the end Duffield came on for Cooper.
AIRDRIE -- Martin, Stewart, Jack, Sandison, Sweeney, Black, Boyle,
Davies, Cooper, Harvey, J McIntyre. Substitutes -- Duffield, Smith, T
McIntyre.
PARTICK THISTLE -- Walker, Dinnie, Pittman, McKee, Welsh, Watson,
McWilliams, Craig, Foster, Milne, Cameron. Substitutes -- McDonald,
Curran, Docherty.
Referee -- W Young (Clarkston).

COMMUNICATIONS
New York, Wednesday -- AT&amp;T Corporation plans to split itself into
three separate companies and is quitting the personal computer business,
the telecommunications giant said yesterday in a stunning announcement
that has repercussions for the entire US telecommunications industry.
The move will bring to an end the 12-year existence of the single
giant company born out of the break-up of the Bell System, which
dominated long-distance telephone, equipment manufacturing and many
other key segments of the communications industry.
AT&amp;T said it will eliminate about 8,500 jobs in its Global Information
Solutions unit, formerly NCR, including 1000 positions from the unit's
Dayton, Ohio, headquarters. It will take a $1500m pre-tax charge against
earnings to pay for the move.
GIS, as the unit is known, currently employs around 43,000 people in
more than 120 countries. AT&amp;T acquired NCR in 1990 for $7.48 billion.
Under the plan, AT&amp;T shareholders will hold shares in each of the
three companies. A fourth business, AT&amp;T Capital Corp, will be sold.
AT&amp;T said the three new companies would focus on each business segment
of the global information industry -- communications services,
communications equipment and transaction-intensive computing, which is
the business of AT&amp;T GIS.
The split-up will be treated as tax-free transactions, AT&amp;T said. The
company's stock soared to $62.50 ahead of the opening of trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, up from $57.625 on Tuesday.
The services company, operating under the AT&amp;T brand name, will
embrace long distance telephone, in which the company has 60% of an $80
billion a year market, and AT&amp;T Card Services, one of the three largest
US credit card issuers.
It will also encompass the newly established AT&amp;T Solutions consulting
and systems-integration organisation, and AT&amp;T Wireless Services,
formerly McCaw Cellular Communications.
In 1994, AT&amp;T's services units had combined revenues of more than $49
billion.
The company said the charge, which will be taken in the third quarter,
will reduce its 1995 after-tax profits by an estimated $1.0 billion, or
66 cents a share.
''The realities of declining margins and cost-cutting across the
computer industry require us to take this step now, painful and
difficult as it is,'' said Lars Nyberg, chairman and CEO of AT&amp;T GIS.
''We must dramatically reduce our costs to be competitive, and as a
first step to becoming profitable,'' said Nyberg.
AT&amp;T GIS will continue to offer customers personal computers as part
of total solutions, but will no longer develop and manufacture its own
line of personal computers or sell them through retail outlets. --

JIMMY White's disappointing form in front of Scottish fans continued
last night when he tamely bowed out of the Regal Masters in Motherwell
once again. The Londoner has won only two matches in the seven years of
the event and he was annoyed with his performance last night as he
tumbled out 5-2 to Nigel Bond.
White led 2-1, but the world No.12 won the fourth frame to go in at
the interval level at 2-2 after what he later described as a ''scrappy''
first session. Bond had compiled a break of 68 in the second frame to
which he added runs of 53 and 87 as he shut out White in the fifth. The
Londoner failed to score again in the next and a break of 57 in the
seventh booked Bond's place in tomorrow's quarter-final against world
No.1 Stephen Hendry, who beat him in the world championship final
earlier this year.
''Put it all down to experience,'' was the advice being offered
earlier in the day to Scottish teenager Alan Burnett after his 5-0
defeat at the hands of world No.10 Peter Ebdon.
Burnett, just turned 17, was consoled with a cheque for #4500 -- about
three times as much as he has received from any other prize in his short
snooker career. He was entitled to feel he had earned this cheque, for
last Sunday he achieved 5-2 victories over professionals Neal Foulds and
Andy Hicks to earn a wild-card place at Motherwell following the
withdrawal of Thailand's James Wattana.
But it was a different story yesterday in front of the TV cameras
against the resolute Ebdon, who also was making his debut in the event.
His customary determination was demonstrated with a break of 112 in
the third frame, an effort which went five balls closer to a maximum 147
than Scotland's John Higgins had been on Tuesday night.
Ebdon took the opening frame by 61-8, but Burnett got into the match
with a break of 44 in the second. In a tight finish, however, the
25-year-old Ebdon sank the brown at the second attempt -- the young Scot
had also one decent chance to pot it -- and cleared to the pink for 2-0.
The Englishman then compiled the highest break of the tournament, and
its first century, being frustrated only by the stubborn refusal of the
final red to move from a side cushion despite his attemps to dislodge
it.
Burnett became a little accident prone in the frame before the
interval, which could have done little for his confidence. But after
Ebdon had compiled a 57, the young Scot staged a brave fightback which
ended when he missed a difficult final pink and left the Englishman an
easy chance. It was now a question of whether the Scot could avoid a
whitewash, but Ebdon had runs of 41 and 44 as he dominated in the fifth
frame to clinch victory.
Burnett is the ninth Scot to take part in the Regal Masters and is in
good company in respect of failing to win at Motherwell on his debut --
Higgins and Alan McManus also failed on their first visits. World
champion Stephen Hendry and Clydebank's John Rae are the only Scots to
have won on their debuts in the event, both in 1989 when the inaugural
Regal Masters was held in Glasgow.
Burnett, who plans to turn professional next June, will continue to
play in local pro-ams and then step up his practice ahead of the World
Amateur Championship in Bristol in November. ''I'll try to do the
double,'' said the world under-21 champion. Ebdon's next challenge is
more immediate and perhaps more testing. Dubliner Ken Doherty has won
the event for the past two years, and it would be his first defeat at
Motherwell if Ebdon were to come out on top in tomorrow afternoon's
quarter-final.

ENGLISH COCA--COLA CUP
ALEX Ferguson issued a warning to York's minnows after seeing them
give his side a soccer lesson at Old Trafford.
Manchester United were hammered 3-0 in a Coca-Cola Cup sensation, but
Fergie was still able to smile as he choked: ''I thought we were
unlucky.''
He quickly accepted that his youngsters were outfought by York, who
deserved their victory, but added that United were looking forward to
the second leg in 12 days time.
''It's going to be a hell of a game, definitely,'' said Ferguson.
''The big guns will be out in the second leg.''
But the Old Trafford manager was also quick to heap praise on his
opponents after their thrilling success, thanks to two goals from Paul
Barnes and one from defender Tony Barras.
''It was a great night for York and you can't take anything away from
them,'' said Ferguson. ''They fought for possession and played good
enterprising football.
''Just a year ago it was a big game for our young players when they
came into the side to face Port Vale, but it wasn't a big game for them
tonight and they have been given a lesson about football.
''Ten years at this club and I am still talking about appetite in
games like this. I thought York had the appetite and the scent for the
battle but we didn't and I have no excuses.''
But York manager Alan Little refused to allow Ferguson's warning that
Old Trafford's senior men will be out in force for the second leg to
take anything away from his own side's precious victory.
''It's a big lead. United will be even more determined than they were
tonight and they have got to throw everything at us,'' he said.
''But this was a tremendous performance and it's nice of Alex to say
we gave them a lesson in football.''

THE City's first impression was that Matthew Clark was paying a full
price for Taunton, and that chief executive Peter Aikens had issued too
many shares over the last four years, with a doubling in number if
Taunton goes through.
Industrially the logic is flawless, as it is in management terms.
Clark chairman Michael Cottrell was also chairman of Taunton until the
Gaymer deal last October, so he knows both businesses intimately. He has
also worked well with Mr Aikens, previously at Courage, and so is happy
with large organisations. The integration of well managed Taunton into
Clark, including the transfer of some of the board, should, therefore,
be a relatively simple operation.
Clark is paying about 17.5 times historic earnings for Taunton, which
were #19.8m last year. The latter is thought likely to achieve about
#22m this time round. Clark's own profits of #21.4m are remarkable, as
they contain only a few months of Gaymers and are on course to reach
#34m this year.
The acquisition is expected to be earnings neutral this year, and
positive thereafter. That is the rub. The benefits from synergy are put
at #11m, but not in the equation are all the cost savings now put in
place at Taunton.
There is substantial scope for brand rationalisation as the sector has
demonstrably far too many on offer, which confuses consumers, while
negotiating with supermakets on pricing will be somewhat easier.
There had been an expectation that a number of other drinks companies
could intervene, including Bass or Whitbread. However, Bass could hardly
reverse its earlier decision to sell out, while Whitbread is becoming
ever more a retailer. But some whisper the name of French drinks group
Pernod Ricard.
Taunton shareholders should certainly back Mr Aikens with enthusiasm
if he can complete the acquisition without having to pay more.

QUEENS Moat Houses may have dragged its way back into the black, but
it still has a long way to go before it can get the bankers off its
back. At least its survival is now not in doubt, unlike during the
protracted restructuring talks.
Those began after Queens Moat distinguished itself by reporting one of
the largest losses in UK corporate history. For 1992 it lost #1075m,
following a breakneck expansion by the previous management which turned
very sour when interest rates went up.
The restructuring, agreed after two years of negotiations, still left
the group with debt of #1022m, and it is not yet earning enough to
service it. But it does have several years of leeway now to improve the
trading performance. It has strong brand names in Queens Moat and
County, and it has the financial headroom to spend money on improving
the hotels and restaurants which will make them more customer
attractive.
There clearly has to be a balance between the need for refurbishment
and the necessity of reducing debt, and the latter requirement will be a
drag on the group's prospects for many years to come.
There is no possibility of paying dividends for the foreseeable
future, as profits are unlikely to be much above break-even. The deal
with the bankers specifies that more interest charges will become
payable when dividends start.
The outlook for the hotel industry is reasonably positive, though less
so if economic growth continues to flag. The shares do offer a highly
geared way into the sector, as any improvement in profits will drop
straight to the bottom line -- but they remain the province of
speculators.

HEALTHCARE
ANDREW Taee has been dismissed from his post as chief executive of
Crestacare with immediate effect, following a unanimous decision by the
full board under the chairmanship of Sir Matthew Goodwin.
His dismissal follows what has been described as ''a very serious
breach of contract'', relating to the details of his service contract.
There is no financial loss involved and Mr Taee is unlikely to get
compensation. He owns three million Crestacare shares.
''There is no black hole in the accounts of this company,'' said Sir
Matthew, who recently retired from the chairmanship of Hewden Stuart. He
added that he could ''only see pluses'' in the situation.
The City appeared to hold a similar view, marking Crestacare's shares
up 4[1/2]p to 34p. There have been concerns expressed in the past about
the company's overheads given its small size.
For instance, Mr Taee earned in excess of #300,000 last year excluding
pension contributions. This is more than Sir Matthew made at Hewden
Stuart, a considerably larger company, and he joked: ''I think I must
have got it wrong.'' In addition, Crestacare has four offices in the UK
including one in London.
Sir Matthew is known for running a tight ship and is expected to take
an axe to the operating overheads, with the group headquarters likely to
be concentrated at the existing Scottish office at Murdostoun Castle,
Wishaw.
Dr Magdy Ishak, a director of Crestacare following last year's
acquisition of Scotcare, is to replace Mr Taee as chief executive. His
medical knowledge in areas such as brain injury will be particularly
useful in view of Crestacare's strategic expansion into special medical
fields where margins tend to be higher. Sir Matthew was chairman of
Scotcare for a number of years and knows Dr Ishak well.
Given the likelihood of substantial cost savings following Mr Taee's
departure, City analysts were busying increasing their profit forecasts
for the year. They now expect annual profits to grow to around #5.5m,
including depreciation of around #1.5m.

FOOD DISTRIBUTION
WATSON &amp; Philip has appointed Andrew Hodgkins, a logistics specialist,
as supply chain director of its fast-growing food distribution business.
This has been boosted by a #15m investment in new warehouses, the #2m
acquisition of an Italian foods firm, and more than #25m of new
contracts.
The construction of larger distribution warehouses in Glasgow,
Coventry and London, with chilled and frozen food storage capacity,
paves the way for a rapid expansion of the Dundee-based group's food
service business.
Chief executive David Bremner predicted that its turnover would expand
from #91m last year to #250m within five years. ''Throughout the UK,
more and more of our customers are looking for a 'one-stop' style of
service where many different product ranges can be ordered then
delivered on the same vehicle,'' he said. ''We are positioning ourselves
to be able to provide this service.''
Mr Hodgkins, 32, will supervise the implementation of this strategy
after quitting his present job with Marks &amp; Spencer in London.
His appointment was announced along with the #2m acquisition of T&amp;L, a
Leeds-based firm which distributes food and wine to the pizza and pasta
sector of the food industry.
Watson &amp; Philip bought the firm from Saltire -- a holding company with
interests ranging from hotels to food and electronics distribution.
It paid #1m for T&amp;L, and has taken over #1.2m of its debt. A further
#1m payment in 12 months' time is conditional on T&amp;L's future
performance.

JUNIOR CHAMBER CONGRESS
NEARLY 5000 young executives from around the world will converge on
Glasgow during the second week of November for the annual congress of
Junior Chamber International, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The organisers predict that all hotels within a 30-mile radius of the
city will be fully booked for the November 5-11 gathering of business
people aged 18 to 40.
The event is expected to pour between #5m and #7m into the local
economy as up and coming business people affiliated to chambers of
commerce in more than 80 countries flood the area.
Marks &amp; Spencer on Argyle Street is opening specially on the night of
November 6 to enable delegates and their partners to go on a buying
spree.
The store, which does not normally accept credit cards, is even laying
on special facilities to allow overseas buyers to pay in this way.
The largest national group at the congress will be the mostly male
1200-strong Japanese delegation, many of whom will be accompanied by
their free-spending wives.
About 500 are expected from South Korea, which hosts the congress next
year, and equally large numbers from China and the US.
Besides taking part in the main congress at Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall, delegates will attend a series of training seminars at other
venues in the city, socialise and make deals.
The theme of this year's congress is ''Success Through Enterprise''.
Glasgow District Council has poured #50,000 of sponsorship into the
event and is optimistic that it will lead to more large-scale congresses
in the city.
Rotary International and the American Association of Travel Agents are
due to hold their annual gatherings in Glasgow in 1997, and Tom
Monaghan, the chief executive of Glasgow District Council, hopes others
will follow.
David Oji, the outgoing president of Junior Chamber International, was
in Glasgow yesterday to inspect preparations for the JCI congress and
declared himself well satisfied.
''I think we are having great expectations for the Glasgow congress,''
the 40-year-old Japanese businessman said.
Mr Oji owns three restaurants and a clothes importing business in the
port city of Yokahama. But he has barely spent three weeks in Japan
since he became president of Florida-based JCI at last year's congress
in Kobe -- which was subsequently devastated by an earthquake.
''I have been travelling in more than 40 countries and have left my
brother and sister to look after the business,'' he said.
Mr Oji will vacate the chair for an American, Tom Clear from
Albuquerque, New Mexico, at this year's congress.

A TEAM of top retail players has just been signed up for the #20m
redevelopment of the former Hamilton Accies stadium. Sports Division,
Top Rank, Harveys Furnishing and Wilsons furniture are the latest
operators to join Sainsbury at the 150,000 sq ft park which is being
developed jointly by Miller Developments and Stannifer Ltd.
A further 10,000 sq ft is under offer to Shoe City. Top Rank will
operate a 30,000 sq ft bingo hall, leaving only one unit of 10,000 sq ft
available to let. Sainsbury signed up earlier this year for the 56,000
sq ft anchor store and filling station. Rentals at the scheme are
understood to be around #12 per sq ft.
The developers now say that they will focus their marketing effort on
finding tenants for free-standing restaurants at the park, for which
consent has already been granted. With construction now well under way,
a spokesman for the joint developers said: ''With the co-operation of
Hamilton District Council, we have been able to get the development on
site in only a few months from acquisition, with a timescale of just
over a year to completion.''
Joint letting agents are Peter Campbell &amp; Co and J Trevor &amp; Webster.
Miller Developments is the development arm of Edinburgh-based Miller
Group which currently has around 500,000 sq ft of retail space under
construction on various sites, including the 200,000 sq ft Hermiston
Gait scheme on the western edge of Edinburgh. The scheme is fully let
and due to complete this year.
Stratford-based Stannifer Ltd recently completed the Kingsgate Retail
Park in East Kilbride.
Further proof that retail warehousing is the hot property of the
sector comes with the announcement that Madford Developments Ltd has
purchased and pre-let a major site at the entrance to Pentland Retail
Park on the outskirts of Edinburgh.
The company bought a five-acre site close to the Straiton Junction of
the Edinburgh by-pass and has pre-let some 41,000 sq ft to two major
retailers. Kwik Save is taking 16,000 sq ft at #8 per sq ft and Focus
DIY is taking 25,000 sq ft at #8.50 per sq ft along with a 9000 sq ft
garden centre.
The remaining 12,000 sq ft has a non-food open user consent. Since
Madford completed the deal, Sainsbury has acquired a nearby site and
Costco has announced its intention to build next door.
Alan Macbeth, director of agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe, said: ''This is
Madford's first development in Scotland, and managing director Henry
Lyons saw the potential of this site long before more established
developers such as Sainsbury and Costco.
''Sites like this one are few and far between in the Gyle area, and
Straiton junction is set to see the highest mixed use development
activity within the Edinburgh area over the next decade.''
DTZ Debenham Thorpe acted for Madford Developments Ltd and is retained
as letting agent. Eric Young &amp; Co acted for Kwik Save. Focus DIY was
represented by Salway &amp; Partners.
These successes follow close on the recent outline planning consent
for a 115,000 sq ft extension to Hypo Property Investment's Kinnaird
Park in Edinburgh. Hypo intends to expand the park to a total size of
405,000 sq ft. The letting agent is Richard Ellis.
Retailers are queuing up to check into Scotland's retail parks because
their easy parking and access make the schemes popular with shoppers.
The retailers are also afraid that new Scottish Office planning
guidelines on out-of-town developments could further restrict such
schemes in the near future.
Property Drive nets #500,000
THE first major deals under the Government's Property Drive disposal
programme have just been revealed. More than 57,000 sq ft has been let
to new tenants on flexible, short term leases, while around 15,000 sq ft
has been sold for more than #500,000.
The marketing campaign was conceived by Government estate managers
Property Holdings as a means of disposing of surplus properties in
Scotland. Around 400,000 sq ft of space in some 50 properties scattered
across Scotland have been put on the market as part of the Property
Drive.
The most significant letting so far is a 15 month sub-let of 50,000 sq
ft at East Kilbride's Plaza Tower to ScottishPower.
Bert Niven, principal property manager with Property Holdings, said:
''These initial sales and lettings demonstrate that we are able to offer
a wide range of quality accommodation on economic and flexible terms. As
well as making more efficient use of Government property, we expect that
this initiative will also assist business in Scotland.''
Agents involved in the marketing campaign are: Ryden, Knight Frank
Rutley, Chesterton, &amp; Hillier Parker.
Full house
for centre
A new 50,507 sq ft shopping centre in Motherwell is almost fully let,
although it has only just opened. The retail and office space scheme was
developed by Wimpey Property Holdings as part of the council's town
centre regeneration project.
The scheme provides nine new units at Brandon Street. Woolworths has
taken an 8000 sq ft unit, and other retailers include Stepek, New Look,
Allsport, and Strand Libraries.
Smith Cole Wright were joint letting agents.

Donald Adamson, a tax partner at KPMG, looks at Opposition taxation
policy and offers some helpful advice on planning ahead
ACKNOWLEDGING that a day is a long time in politics and that the next
General Election may be delayed until 1997, the opinion polls
consistently give Labour a commanding lead.
In the 1992 election manifesto, Labour stated that a new top rate of
50% would apply to income in excess of #40,000. It is unlikely that such
a clear headline-grabbing commitment will be made this time round, but
Labour has been quietly considering detailed taxation points for the
past couple of years and seems ready to move into a comprehensive agenda
should Tony Blair come to power.
It is, therefore, worth considering Labour's tax policies and the
planning points which may arise.
Income tax
NO commitment has been made, but it is thought that the current lower
(20%), basic (25%) and 40% rates will remain.
It is a matter of speculation whether higher rates of 50% or 60% will
be introduced for very high-earners. Should these be contemplated, the
sporting money is on these only biting substantially above the #40,000
quoted in 1992.
For example, a rate of 60% for those earning over #100,000 is unlikely
to be a major vote loser even in the South-east of England.
Unsurprisingly, tax relief for private medical insurance for the
over-sixties is unpopular with Labour.
It might be assumed that a continued erosion of MIRAS (leading to
extinction) would appeal to the party. On the other hand, the Labour
front bench treasury team have recognised the construction industry and
the housing sector as prime engines of growth. Help for the hard-pressed
house-owner from a surprising quarter could be on the way.
Planning points
* Between now and the election withdraw retained profits from family
companies either by way of bonuses or dividends; loan the money back to
the company if it needs the cash.
* As the election approaches, advance salary so as to crystallise the
tax liability at present tax rates but with entitlement to the cash
deferred until some time later.
* Pay bonuses for higher rate taxpayers before the election.
Benefits in kind
EXECUTIVE Share Option Schemes have recently attracted a lot of
attention in the wake of the Greenbury Report. Labour is on record as
saying that share options should be related to improvements in company
performance and should be open to all employees.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts (ESOTs) which were introduced by the
1989 Finance Act may be revamped by simplifying legal mechanics and
introducing further tax incentives.
Labour is keen that benefits in kind are taxed so as to fully reflect
the value of the asset being provided. No help for the company car
driver is expected. Benefits in kind may be subjected to national
insurance contributions, as it sets out to tackle loopholes.
Planning points
* Get a Profit Related Pay (PRP) scheme into place.
* Employers considering the introduction of an all-employee share
scheme may wish to consider whether ESOTs will be encouraged by a new
Labour government.
* Keep the company car fleet under review and consider exit costs
should personal taxation on company cars become punitive.
* Gifting of significant company assets (a benefit in kind), where
contemplated, should be accelerated prior to an election.
Pensions and investments
GORDON Brown has stated that it is premature for him to make
pronouncements on the details of his party's pension policies.
However, he indicated that he had no plans to change occupational
pension schemes, private pensions and additional voluntary
contributions. Against this, the 1992 election manifesto indicated that
it would abolish higher rate tax relief on pension contributions. Labour
has made a consistent theme of the need to improve regulation in the
pensions market.
No policy statement has been issued at present on the taxation of
investment income but it is possible that either an investment income
surcharge or a reduction in tax credit on dividends will be
contemplated.
Planning points
* Consider maximising pension contributions which attract higher rate
relief before the election.
* Again, accelerate the withdrawal of retained profits by dividends
from family companies.
* Re-visit taxation planning, where married, to balance income between
spouses.
* Consider critical investments which will defer the receipt of income
until after the next election.
Capital gains
LABOUR has in the past proposed a reduction in the CGT annual
exemption and the withdrawal of indexation allowance.
It has also been suggested that the ability to defer capital gains tax
in certain circumstances (hold over relief) may be restricted.
It may also consider introducing differential rates of capital gains
tax, designed to favour assets which are held long term.
Planning points
* Between now and the election ensure you take advantage of asset
disposals/bed and breakfasting to utilise your annual exemption and also
accelerate disposals to obtain indexation and avoid higher rates of tax.
* Consider transferring business assets or shares in unquoted trading
companies before the ability to hold over gains is withdrawn.
Going abroad
LABOUR is expected to tighten the definition of residence and domicile
and, therefore, restrict (or withdraw) the possibility of going overseas
to crystallise capital gains free of tax.
Planning points
* Bring forward any plans to move overseas for capital gains tax
planning.
* Consider placing assets in offshore trusts.
Inheritance tax
IT is possible that a Labour government would increase the nil rate
band which is presently #154,000 and, therefore, take many people out of
the inheritance tax net, but equally it might introduce tapered rates of
tax rising to well above the current 40% for large estates.
Labour perceives there to be several loopholes in inheritance tax
which may thus be closed. There is likely to be critical consideration
of deeds of variation, aspects of business property relief and
potentially exempt transfers.
Planning points
* Ensure that there is an up-to-date will in force which is flexible
enough to accommodate changes in the level of the nil rate band and to
be adaptable after death without the need for a deed of variation.
* Consider passing on shares, farms or businesses to the next
generation now.
* Utilise existing IHT reliefs to the full.
The Scottish perspective
LABOUR proposes to introduce a Scottish Parliament. This will be given
tax variation powers, with the ability to raise or lower the basic rate
of income tax by up to 3p in the pound (but no right to alter
corporation tax or VAT).
While there is a natural concern that this implies higher rates of tax
for Scots, it might be worthwhile to contemplate that in the seventies
the Labour government operated an extensive regime of regional
assistance.
Would it be too much to hope that a reduced basic rate of income tax
in Scotland, below UK levels, might be regarded as the most effective
form of stimulus possible for the Scottish economy?
Consider Scotland as a tax haven; creating wealth and jobs. Why not?

A #260,000 RESEARCH study of the waters of the River Dee is to be
carried out by an Aberdeen-based consortium which is investigating how
river water quality is affected by neighbouring land-use. Doctor Simon
Langan of the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, one of the partners
in the consortium, said that ultimately they hoped to be able to issue
advice on how changes of land use should be managed in sensitive
catchment areas.
The choice of tree species could have a significant impact on the rate
at which atmospheric pollutants were released into the river system, he
said. The objective of the research programme was to enable landowners,
land managers and policy-makers to assess the possible impact which a
change in land use might have on a local river system.
The selection of the Dee as a research site was highly appropriate,
given the river's considerable commercial value as a focus for tourism
and fishing, he said.
Professor Malcolm Cresser of Aberdeen University, which is also part
of the consortium, said that all the individual bodies involved had
studied aspects of the Dee and its catchment area over the past 10-20
years. They were ideally placed to combine their knowledge and skills in
an attempt to improve river water quality across Europe.
The experts believe that because the Dee is an extremely clean river
they will be able to identify even the most minor changes in water
quality.
The funding is being provided by the National Environmental Research
Council which will be represented in the consortium through its
Institute of Terrestrial Ecology at Banchory. Other partners include the
North-East River Purification Board and the Institute of Hydrology.

<RECORDNO>976273635</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT pledge to challenge the continuation of European milk
quotas was issued on the opening day of the two-day European Dairy
Farming Event at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.
During a tour of the event, Tony Baldry, junior agriculture minister,
said the Government would continue to press for changes in the regime to
make it more market-orientated.
''I recognise that the EU dairy regime, with its quotas on milk
production, remains a major obstacle to the rational development of the
European dairy industry, and that it prevents British dairy farmers from
making the most of their ideal conditions for producing milk.''
His undertaking came only 24 hours after a bitter attack on the quota
regime by John Sumner, head of dairy development with the Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service, and Roger Clarke, a director of the
Danish group MD Foods, who condemned it for fossilising national dairy
sectors, encouraging fraud and waste and creating artificial shortages.
Mr Sumner renewed the attack at an ADAS news conference yesterday to
launch the service's new Blueprints for Business scheme. ''Our industry
faces a major challenge. World milk production is set to expand, yet the
UK is constrained by a current quota regime which is curbing production,
sustaining high domestic prices and reducing our competitiveness.
''The only way forward is to strengthen and adapt every dairy
business, capitalising on the best technology in order to improve yields
and produce milk at a lower cost.''
But many farmers still favour quotas, as was revealed in a survey
carried out by Strutt &amp; Parker. This showed that two thirds of the
sample remained confident the regime would continue beyond its scheduled
end in the year 2000. Of these, half wanted quotas to remain in their
present form.
Of those that wanted change, just over a third wished to see quotas
abolished, while the remainder wanted to see them modified. The majority
of this latter sector wanted to see the right of non-producing quota
holders to hold quota, to be abolished.
A new look event is on the cards for next year. Out goes the two-day
production trials which have been around for nearly 100 years, and in
comes a total performance evaluation section, based on lifetime
production, genetic merit and inspection.
Organisers expect this may lead to some exhibitors backing out, but
Richard Salisbury, event director, said he hoped they might change their
minds when they saw the details. He said the current milking trials were
essentially a test of the stockman and a selected cow over a 48 hour
period.
Other changes are expected to be announced in the coming months,
including making cattle judging more of a spectacle. Dalgety
Agriculture, which co-sponsors the three-day trials along with the
association, is also expected to axe this section.
For the first time in six years, a red and white animal took the top
award in this trial. This was the Dairy Shorthorn cow Spalton's Maxton
Ada 2 by a red and white Holstein, and shown by J D &amp; R L Spalton,
Church Broughton, Derbyshire, who also won in 1989.
Speaking at the launch of the new Dalgety Forage Auditing Service,
Professor David Leaver of Wye College said the drought had led to silage
yields up to 25% lower than last year. He urged producers to make a
careful analysis of available stocks.

INTERIM profits at distribution group Tibbett &amp; Britten were hit by
problems at its Axial auto logistics business in the UK, which moved
into a loss.
Chairman John Harvey warned of a difficult outlook for the year in the
UK with Axial expected to lose #10m compared with a profit of #4.4m last
year.
Among the highlights of the period was the winning of a five-year
contract from Chivas Brothers to design, build and operate a new export

THE Government has shown it is anti-home ownership by reducing Miras
and mortgage income support, and these actions are seriously undermining
confidence, Sir Lawrie Barratt claimed yesterday. The chairman of
Barratt Developments also said he did not anticipate any significant
improvement unless action was taken.
Yet this was immediately after he revealed that the group has bucked
the trend among the housebuilders, its pre-tax profit for the year to
June jumping 34% to #47.1m.
The market liked the figures and the shares were boosted 19p to 186p.
Sentiment was further encouraged by the 8% rise in reservations since
June in sharp contrast to others in the sector.
The company, which now has 18 operating housing divisions, increased
the number of sales in the UK by 14% to 6601 units. This follows a 16%
advance the year before. Barratt set itself a target two years ago of
increasing the build from 5000 to 8000 units by 1996 and so far is
reasonably well on target.
The average price also increased -- from #74,900 to #78,800 -- with
the impetus coming partly from a sprinkling of top of the range units
which can cost #450,000, but mostly from the Premier Collection of 17
styles which are now available on 75% of Barratt sites.
Social housing accounts for about 10% of the total and with prices
averaging #46,600 achieved a 10% return.
Overall margins improved from 10.4% to 10.9%.
Barratt is re-trenching its contracting activities in Scotland. It had
ventured forth from its Aberdeen base into the central belt but decided,
quite rightly, that the competition was too stiff and retreated
northwards. Most employees involved have been transferred to the new
East of Scotland housebuilding division.
Contracting still made a #600,000 profit on turnover of #20m and the
current order book now stands at some #21m.
The one bad area was the US. There losses for the year increased 10%
to #2.2m but they are now in much better fettle. Nevertheless, Barratt
is holding back on its activities in Southern California until sentiment
improves -- it has been damaged by seven US interest rate rises since
1994.
Financial strength is shown by gearing of just 19% or debt of #43m
with interest cover a healthy 7.8 times.
Tentative projections are for current year profits of around #51m.
The dividend total has been raised 25% to 7.5p with a 5p final for a
5% yield.

IT will be ''arrivederci Glasgow'' for the winner of Landmark Leather
Centre's free prize draw on Saturday.
Visitors to the showroom have been invited to take part in a free
prize draw, in which the first prize is a holiday to Italy. Another
winner will receive one million lira. Midday on Saturday is the deadline
but entries will be taken right up until the winning ticket is drawn.
Landmark are swinging into the holiday mood this weekend, with many
special offers and entertainment for the family.
Apart from the no deposit, nothing to pay until 1996 and interest free
payments until the year 2000 offers, there is an added bonus for the
first twenty five leather suite orders taken on Saturday.
If you simply are looking to browse, there's rarely been a better day
to combine shopping with a family day out.
Meet Rory, the world's tallest piper, who will stir the patriotic
blood with a skirl of those pipes.
The Landmark roadshow will also be there to provide some more
contemporary sounds, with a top DJ in residence throughout the morning.
And if the thought of a brand new luxurious Italian leather suite
doesn't excite the children as much as it does the parents, there are
activities for them with a bouncy castle and the chance to be
transformed by face painting artists.
Visit Landmark Leather Centre this Saturday and you could be relaxing
in Italy -- and if not, it will be hard to resist the temptation of
magnificent Italian leather.

THE contrast between the success of Barratt Developments in continuing
to sell houses and that of almost all its rivals is quite remarkable.
Persimmon, Barratt's nearest competitor, has stopped building on 10
sites, while Bryant said this week that since June, reservations had
dropped 15%.
Barratt is increasing the number of developments from 205 to 220 this
year with enthusiasm and confidence underlined by an 8% rise in
reservations over the last couple of months.
It certainly appears to be the most innovative company in the
industry, with the Premier Collection obviously a valuable selling tool.
But it would seem the strategic decision to welcome part-exchange
deals, which presently account for exactly half group sales, has proved
crucial, even if the loss on each transaction is about #2500.
Its merit is that it eases the market for the individual purchaser,
who can move with confidence, particularly as there is a 4% two-year
mortgage agreement.
The cost of sales is about 7% of the selling price, which does keep
overall group margins below those of some competitors, but that does not
matter too much if volume and turnover continue to advance.
Two years ago Sir Lawrie Barratt set a target of increasing sales by
3000 to 8000 in the current financial year. That will require an advance
of about 18% compared with 14% and 16% in the last two years. On present
indications that appears unreachable -- unless the Government does
something in the Budget. But with an obviously pretty empty purse, and
education and health also competing as favoured horses in the election
winning stakes, this may not happen. Even if the achievement does fall
short of target, criticism will be muted.
However, while the UK is pleasing, the US is not. Losses rose 10% to
#2.2m last year, thanks to the continuing difficulties in Southern
California. While chief executive Frank Eaton said the company was now
in profit, activity will be restrained until the market really gets
moving again.
There have been five years of losses in that territory, undermining
overall group progress not only in headline profits but also by
increasing the tax charge and thus depressing earnings.
Barratt would do itself and shareholders a deal of good if it were to
quit the US.

SOFT Italian leather furniture lends an air of luxury and European
style to any home. It couples the beauty of a much sought-after material
with the innovation and flair of top furniture designers, becoming
naturally beautiful furniture which will be comfortable and pleasing to
the eye for many years to come.
Quality like this has to come at a price, but at Landmark's Leather
Centre it is well within reach, with prices of Italian leather suites
starting at #899.
Open over the holiday weekend, the Landmark store is Scotland's
largest Italian leather centre with 27,000 sq ft of stylish furniture.
The impressive showroom exhibits over 100 styles of Italian leather
sofas and chairs.
The company takes pride in offering the newest and most exclusive
Italian designs to a discerning public who, more than ever, are anxious
to make their homes beautiful and distinctive.
The showroom, which is Landmark's only Italian leather suite centre in
Scotland, is situated in Glasgow's East End. Take the junction 10 cut
off on the M8, follow the signs for 150 yards and the centre sits beside
MFI.
Since its opening in August, the centre has attracted a great deal of
attention from those who enjoy the elegance of well-designed furniture.
Italian designers are among those at the forefront of upholstery
design and Landmark aims to provide the best choice available.
The upholstery comes in a wide range of colours from classic black to
sumptuous chocolate brown through the spectrum to delicate pink and cool
champagne -- for those who are looking to be even more adventurous,
there are two stands of pattern books to choose from.
For customers looking to give their home a whole new look, the centre
also has finely crafted lounge furniture such as display units and
cabinets to use with televisions and hi-fi units. There are also
beautifully designed tables and chairs, along with lamps and rugs which
give the centre's room settings an extra elegance -- and customers a
better idea of how each piece will look in situ. A large choice of
carpets are on sale, as are bedrooms and a range of beds.
Open seven days a week, from 10am to 6pm from Monday to Saturday
(except Thursday when you can visit the store until 8pm) and from 11am
to 5pm on Sunday, the centre has ample free parking.
The spaces will fill up quickly this Saturday, however, during the
centre's big prize day when a holiday to Italy and a million lira can be
won. Those who don't win a prize can take advantage of the many offers
that Saturday has in store.
Christmas may be an unwelcome concept at the moment but if the thought
of relaxing into the comfort of luxurious Italian leather over the
festive period is appealing, Landmark will guarantee delivery for
Christmas on any suites ordered this weekend. Normal delivery time is
also around the eight to ten-week mark -- it's quality which is well
worth waiting for.
Those who shudder at the thought of making such a large investment
when the expense of Christmas is just around the corner should take
note. At the moment, there is nothing to pay until 1996. There is also
no deposit to pay. Perhaps the most tempting offer is that which allows
customers to pay by interest-free credit until the year 2000.
Landmark has 18 stores in Scotland, all of which offer top quality
furniture. Leather suites can also be found at their Uddingston showroom
in Birkenshaw Industrial Estate, where a huge selection of modern
furniture is also available. Glasgow city-centre dwellers can have a
stroll round the showroom on Argyle Street which specialises in
upholstery. There are also branches in Clydebank, Paisley, and
throughout Scotland.

GLASGOW Brightsiders, for long considered the heirs apparent to
Livingston Bulls for the major Scottish basketball honours, may face a
surprising challenge from the east this season.
Edinburgh Burger Kings have just appointed Australian Greg Gurr as
their first full-time coach, thanks to a new sponsorship deal from
Burger King and a public relations company, Proplay Ltd.
Gurr, who coached Derby in the Budweiser League last season, assisted
with coaching courses in Glasgow during the summer as well as coaching
on the Scottish Basketball Association summer camp at Kilgraston.
He becomes the first full-time basketball coach in Scotland thanks to
a total package worth #16,000, which includes #5000 from the
Government's Sports Match scheme.

DETERMINED to make the 900-mile round trip from Somerset a profitable
one, Martin Pipe has four runners today at Perth.
Preenka Girl attempts to make it five wins in a row in the Glengoyne
Highland Malt Novices Chase.
Two weeks ago she trotted up by 20 lengths at Newton Abbot and five
days earlier she had a similarly facile win at Stratford when coming
home with 10 lengths to spare.
Elite Reg will be well-fancied in the Highland Spring Scottish
Celebration Handicap Hurdle. He failed when favourite at Newton Abbot
but won by a distance on the same course last month and by four lengths
in a handicap chase two weeks earler.
Nordic Valley has also won twice already this season and will be well
backed in the Gaymers Olde English claiming hurdle.
Nigel Twiston-Davies is also well represented and he will be hoping to
repeat his success of a year ago when Sweet Duke won the Tamerosia
Series qualifier.
This time he runs With Impunity, a consistent performer over hurdles
last season who is attempting fences for the first time.
Peter Monteith's veteran two-mile chaser Beldine attempts to win the
Bank of Scotland Coopers &amp; Lybrand Handicap Chase for the second
consecutive year. The big grey loves the Scone Palace track having won
over the course five times.
Local trainer Tom Dyer has five runners, including three in the
opener, the Highland Spring Juvenile Novices Hurdle. True Ballad is on
the racecourse for the first time, while Nicky's Feeling fell here a
month ago, and Keith's Pride failed to impress at Market Rasen.
* SCOTLAND's latest recruit to training, Lucinda Russell, had a dream
start to her career at Perth yesterday when her first runner, Fiveleigh
Builds, won the feature race of the meeting.

SHINTY:
THERE has been widespread condemnation of events at a reserve match in
Fort William last weekend when three players were ordered off for
violent play.
Three players ended up in hospital with what were said to be
deliberately inflicted injuries. Several spectators left the game
between Fort William and Kilmallie because they could not stomach what
they were witnessing in the match which was described by one club
official as ''a disgrace''.
Referee Willie Lawrie has now reported various incidents from the
match to the Camanachd Association and the players ordered off are due
to appear before the game's disciplinary committee by the end of the
month.
Camanachd Association president Duncan Cameron said he could not
comment on reports of rough play, as he had no details of what was
alleged to have happened.
The incidents took place on the same day that a player lost an eye in
a complete accident while playing at Kingussie. There is concern that
unseemly brawls such as took place at Fort William are the last thing
the game needs with safety and discipline in the face of ongoing
refereeing difficulties placing the game under the microscope.
Gordon MacIntyre, of Oban Camanachd, the player who lost an eye at
Kingussie, expects to get home this weekend. He has confirmed his
playing days are over, but is now contemplating a career as a referee or
coach.
Back on the field of play, Inveraray's young high-fliers face their
stiffest test so far when they entertain premier league favourites
Kingussie.
The Argyllshire side have been the surprise packet so far, and remain
undefeated after three games. They have already taken a point off
Newtonmore, and believe that they could cause a major upset by winning
at the Winterton.
Kingussie go there in some trepidation knowing that the tricky
surface, although improved this season, could disrupt their rhythm. Oban
Camanachd also exposed defensive frailties last weekend, which Inveraray
could well exploit.
Fort William remain poised to take advantage of any slip by Kingussie,
although they face a stiff task against Oban Camanachd.

SWIMMING
THE Hope household in Errol, Perthshire, is certain to be a place of
mixed emotions over the forthcoming months as 19-year-old Richard and
younger sister, Kirsty, pursue their dream of swimming for Britain at
next summer's Olympic Games.
After a disappointing trip to Canada with the Scottish team in July,
Richard gained a confidence boost at last month's World Student Games in
Japan when he won the consolation final of the 200 metres back-stroke.
He was just a fraction outside his personal best in 2min 04.80ec,
while he also helped the British team finish fifth in the 4x200m
free-style.
''It was a great trip, and my times were very encouraging,'' said
Richard. ''After the disastrous trip to Canada, I was nervous and didn't
know what to expect.
''But, this time, we had 12 days to acclimatise and that made the
difference. I was really pleased, and I'm now ready to give it a real go
for the Olympic trials next March.''
The Warrender swimmer realises he needs to knock at least a couple of
seconds off his best times to make the team for America next summer, but
modern technology has proved that it is possible.
''In Japan, there was equipment that provided a computerised analysis
of each swim, and it showed that I could make up two-and-a-half seconds
on the start and turns.''
While Richard is about to start his second year of a business studies
and accountancy degree at Edinburgh University, Kirsty has the advantage
of an easy sixth year at Dundee High School.
The 17-year-old already has secured a university place, and is now
looking forward to concentrating her energies on Atlanta.
A free-style specialist, one of her targets will be to challenge
two-time Olympian Alison Sheppard for the title of Scotland's top female
sprinter.

BANK of Scotland's planned invasion of Australia is just one of
several major moves by Scottish companies in recent months to exploit
growth opportunities outwith their home territory, writes IAN McCONNELL.
ScottishPower's #1100m bid for Chester-based electricity distributor
Manweb, announced on July 24, is the biggest ever by a truly Scottish
company.
Having slashed costs since privatisation in 1991, ScottishPower
realised it would have to pursue opportunities outside its home patch to
continue its profits growth.
Prior to the Manweb move, it was in the bidding process for
electricity distributor United Energy, in the Australian state of
Victoria.
Edinburgh-based brewing giant Scottish &amp; Newcastle has achieved a
massive increase in its business south of the Border, with its recent
#425m acquisition of Courage from Fosters Brewing Group of Australia.
The deal allowed Scottish &amp; Newcastle to wrest the title of Britain's
biggest brewer from Bass.
In March, sausage-skin manufacturer Devro International, based at
Moodiesburn near Glasgow, announced the purchase of a much-larger US
rival.
Its $133.5m (#86.2m) purchase of Teepak International will enable it
to diversify its product range and increase production capacity, while
more effectively targeting North American and Eastern European markets.
Recent results from Glasgow-based Weir Group revealed the wisdom of
its #135m acquisition, last October, of Salt Lake City-based EnviroTech
Pumpsystems.
The performance of the US operation more than offset the effect of a
poor first-half showing by the engineering group's principal UK
factories, enabling a 9% rise in interim pre-tax profits to #20.2m.
Without EnviroTech, chairman Lord Weir believed the group's first-half
profits would have fallen.
Meanwhile, Perth-based insurance giant General Accident revealed last
week that it was in negotiations which might lead to it taking over
Provident Mutual, the Hertfordshire-based life insurer and pensions
specialist.
A successful conclusion of talks would be likely to herald General
Accident's biggest acquisition since the late-1980s, when it bought the
New Zealand Insurance Corporation in two tranches for a total of #376m.
The bus business is perhaps not the first to spring to mind at the
mention of overseas expansion.
However, Perth-based Stagecoach, built up from nothing by executive
chairman Brian Souter and his sister Ann Gloag, the managing director,
recently became the first UK operator to enter the local bus market in
Continental Europe.
Prior to Stagecoach's recent move into Portugal, with the acquisition
of some of the operations of the newly-privatised Rodoviaria de Lisboa
for #6.3m, one in seven of Stagecoach's 7000 buses already served
overseas destinations.
The company runs 300 buses in New Zealand and another 700 in Kenya and
Malawi.
It is establishing its credentials in Hong Kong, with a fleet of 11
buses, with its eye on China after the hand-over of the colony to its
neighbour by the UK Government in 1997.
Meanwhile, Scottish companies are targeting new markets, such as
China, aggressively.
And Scotland's oil and gas industry and powerful financial services
sector continue to pursue business around the globe.
Glasgow-based investment management group Murray Johnstone is a case
in point, having opened a Singapore office in the last couple of weeks,
in an attempt to attract more funds from the US and Middle East.
And Edinburgh-based oil and gas company Cairn Energy was the first
Western company to move into Bangladesh.

MANWEB surprised the stock market yesterday by announcing that it was
holding takeover talks with an unidentified foreign rival to
ScottishPower.
ScottishPower, which improved its hostile #1100m bid for the
Chester-based electricity company earlier this week, was stunned by the
news.
And City analysts were puzzled why any foreign bidder should enter a
contest for Manweb when other potentially more attractive regional
electricity companies were still available to be bought more cheaply.
But they said the mystery suitor was likely to be a US, rather than a
European, power company.
Houston Industries from Texas, Pacific Gas and Electric from
California, and Central and Southwest Corporation have all expressed
interest in buying an Rec.
''I am surprised. There seems little point getting into an auction
with ScottishPower,'' said utilities analyst David Stone at Daiwa.
''There would have to be a strong local reason for getting into a
bidding battle with ScottishPower when you can go in and get something
like London or Seeboard much more cheaply,'' agreed Bill Dale, an
electricity analyst at Smith New Court.
Manweb said it was ''in substantive discussions with an overseas third
party which may or may not lead to a recommended cash offer'', but it
gave no clue as to the suitor's identity.
Sources close to the negotiations said only that Manweb chief
executive John Roberts was in London holding talks at Schroders, the
company's merchant bank, and that a further announcement was likely
today or tomorrow.
Ian Graham, an electricity analyst at Natwest Markets, said that in
view of ScottishPower's cash-plus-shares offer of 1016p and all-cash
alternative of 990p, it would be difficult for any rival to strike an
agreed bid for Manweb for less than 1100p.
But that would value Manweb at 100p a share more than other recently
agreed bids in the sector -- a level which most analysts regard as
unrealistic.
''Eastern agreed on 975p with Hanson and that was a higher quality Rec
than Manweb,'' said Bill Dale at Smith New Court.
Manweb shares shot up 17p to 1012p yesterday, but ScottishPower was
unaffected by the setback to its bid, rising 1p to 363p in line with a
generally stronger market.
This perhaps reflected the fact that many investors were not taking
the prospect of a contested bid very seriously.
Manweb may simply be mounting a bluff aimed at getting more money out
of ScottishPower by Friday -- the last day on which the Glasgow-based
company can revise its offer unless a rival appears with a firm counter
proposal.
But the Takeover Panel is unlikely to allow ScottishPower to modify
its current bid, which it described on Monday as final, unless a rival
offer is openly slapped on the table.
ScottishPower tried unsuccessfully to start talks with Manweb on a
recommended offer at the weekend, and was perplexed by the last-minute
appearance of a possible white knight for the company.
Chief executive Ian Robinson said he had always been aware that a
white knight could emerge, but was surprised one had made its appearance
this late in the game.
He declined to say whether ScottishPower would stay in the bidding for
Manweb if a rival offer emerged.
''That's a hypothetical question. We think we have got a good bid on
the table,'' he said. ''We are confident and we are waiting.''
* NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generating company, has
declined to comment on market talk that it may soon follow PowerGen's
example of bidding for an Rec.
Chairman John Baker told National Power's annual meeting on July 26:
''We are not interested in expanding our exposure to the UK regulatory
system.'' A company spokesman said yesterday: ''There is nothing further
to add really, at the moment.''

DRINKS group Matthew Clark, whose interests include Strathmore water
and Stowells of Chelsea wine boxes, has made an agreed #245m bid for
Taunton Cider. The move will create Britain's largest cider group with a
combined market share of about 48%, placing it ahead of previous
industry leader Bulmer's 45%.
The deal values Taunton shares, which remained virtually unchanged at
217p on the announcement, at 225p. The identity of the bidder had been a
fairly open secret since a fortnight ago when Taunton chairman Michael
Garner disclosed that an approach had been made.
Clark shares tumbled 33p to 587p on concern that it was paying a very
full price and that it had issued a large number of shares for
acquisitions over the last couple of years.
This means that employees who backed the 1990 #72.5m management
buy-out of Taunton from Bass, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Courage with an
equity stake of #650,000 are making a return of #45 for every #1
invested.
There is a partial cash alternative to the offer of 338 Clark shares
for every 1000 Taunton of #932.99 cash and 222.14 Clark shares. That has
been underwritten by BZW and is currently worth 223p. Accepting
shareholders can take 42% of their entitlement in this form.
Apart from alcoholic lemonade, cider is the fastest expanding part of
the UK drinks industry with volume growth now an astonishing 11% and
consumption at more than 100 million gallons. That has been achieved
largely at the expense of the beer market and in particular commodity
lagers
Taunton's main brands are Dry Blackthorn in the mainstream area. This
has a 70% share of the Scottish market for the category -- some argue
that Bulmer's Woodpecker is too sweet for the Scottish palate.
The star, though, is Diamond White in the premium market which has
gained substantially from the niche bottled beers through excellent
marketing and a new audience of young women. Taunton spends about #17m
on promotion including help from Govan's best known resident, Rab C
Nesbitt.
However, competition in the supermarkets has been ferocious, leading
Taunton to take substantial cost cutting measures. These will save about
#7.5m annually from next year.
Through Gaymer, which was bought a year ago for #105m, Clark has about
12% of the cider market but this is chiefly at the lower end where
pricing pressures are at their worst. Olde English and K Cyder are the
major brands.
The remainder of the market is largely in the hands of privately owned
Inch and publicly quoted Merrydown.

BANK of Scotland's planned #235m acquisition of 51% of the Bank of
Western Australia will be by far its biggest purchase since it took over
British Linen Bank in 1971.
The Edinburgh-based bank is not renowned for acquisitions, and
yesterday's news of the Bank of Western Australia (BankWest) buy, from
the state government, took the City by surprise.
Bank of Scotland, which believes the purchase will also allow it to
cash in on the economic growth potential of Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand and Taiwan, will initially pay #437m for the entire share
capital of BankWest.
It has undertaken to float 49% of the Perth-based bank after
completion, subject to it realising a minimum price of #202m.
However, analysts have some doubts over the attraction of such a high
public offer price. Bank of Scotland twice tried to purchase US banks in
the late eighties but could not achieve deals at prices it was willing
to pay.
And the bank has not been particularly excited by its modest
investments in Europe. General manager and secretary Hugh Young said:
''No company can stand still. Bank of Scotland is no exception and we
must expand.
''We find the Anglo-Saxon culture of Australia and New Zealand is
closer to the Bank of Scotland culture, and we feel we are with
friends.''
Even if analysts' concerns about the price of the public offer are
borne out, Bank of Scotland said it would be ''perfectly happy'' to be
left with more than 51%.
Mr Young said: ''The minimum price at which we are required to sell
off the 49% is quite a full price but, if that results in us not selling
49% and we end up with 60% or 75%, we will not complain.''
Bank of Scotland shares were down 12p following the news, but after
the company stressed there was no question of a rights issue to fund the
purchase, they closed only 7p lower on 246p in volume of nearly 10
million shares.
BZW banking analyst Hugh Pye believed Bank of Scotland had paid a
''fairly full price'' for BankWest but saw some justification for this.
Bank of Scotland expects the deal to enhance earnings per share within
two or three years. The short-term effect should be broadly neutral.
The question of Bank of Scotland's ability to run a major operation on
the other side of the world naturally arises with the purchase of
BankWest.
However, Australasia is not new to Bank of Scotland, which has been
happy with the performance of its Countrywide Banking Corporation
subsidiary in New Zealand.
The bank purchased 40% of Countrywide in the late eighties and bought
the remainder three years ago. The Countrywide acquisition -- the
biggest since British Linen -- is pretty small in relation to the
BankWest purchase.
Bank of Scotland already has a factoring company, Scottish Pacific
Business Finance Pty, and a relatively new instalment credit subsidiary,
Capital Corporate Finance, in Australia.
It is currently setting up a Treasury operation in Sydney to fund its
Australasian activities.
Bank of Scotland, keen to stress the proximity of Perth to Singapore,
plans a cohesive banking operation which will cover not just Australia
and New Zealand but also the ''young dragons'' of the Pacific Rim.
At the moment, Western Australia is enjoying rapid economic growth.
This is expected to slow but should remain at a reasonable level.
Talk that Sydney-based Westpac Banking Corp is looking for an
acquisition, and aggressive expansion of market share in Western
Australia, is perhaps slightly worrying from a margin point of view, but
Bank of Scotland's plans to cast its net in the direction of nearby
countries should provide some reassurance.
Mr Young said: ''We see the Pacific Rim and that part of the world as
a very good source of growth in the next few years.''
He claimed Bank of Scotland's key Tier 1 core capital ratio, currently
about 6.3%, would only fall to about 6% if it could float 49% of
BankWest.
The bank hopes the acquisition will not restrict its growth potential
in the UK. However, if it finds its Tier 1 ratio falling to an
unacceptable level, it could cap its growth of domestic lending.
Mr Young said: ''We have been growing more quickly than the other
banks. If it was necessary to do something to improve that (Tier 1
ratio) we might slow our growth a little bit.''
The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England have already
given informal nods to the deal in their respective regulatory
capacities, and no problem is anticipated with formal approval.
Meanwhile, Western Australia hopes to regain its triple-A credit
rating as a result of the privatisation of BankWest.
The Australian bank, the biggest financial institution based in
Western Australia, commands some 23% of the deposits and one-quarter of
the lending market.
In the 12 months to end-September last year, it made pre-tax profits
of #62m, after #9m of provisions for doubtful debts. During the first
six months of its current financial year, BankWest made profits of #34m.
At end-March, it had shareholders' equity of #245m -- a figure which
should be unchanged when the deal is completed in November.
BankWest, which is celebrating its centenary in this, Bank of
Scotland's tercentennial year, has about 2960 full-time equivalent
employees.
Bank of Scotland has kept in touch with BankWest since a team, led by
Governor Sir Bruce Pattullo, visited its executives in Perth in 1990.
In the year to end-February, Bank of Scotland achieved an increase in
operating profits -- something the English clearers failed to manage --
posting record annual pre-tax earnings of #450m, an advance of
two-thirds on the previous 12 months.

FIRST results from Queens Moat Houses since its financial
restructuring show the hotels group moving in the right direction,
reporting profits for the first time since 1990 -- though only just.
Before exceptionals, pre-tax profit came to #700,000 for the six
months to early July, against losses of #31.6m in the comparable period.
This reflected an interest holiday on the bulk of its bank debt.
The restructuring involved swapping part of its debt mountain for
equity and extending the term of remaining debt, which is subject to
extensive interest holidays. Even so, borrowings still top #1000m.
There were exceptional gains, net of foreign exchange losses, of #42m
due to the restructuring.
Queens Moat is the UK's third largest hotels group, with 92 units
containing 9500 beds. UK operating profits were little changed at #14.6m
after absorbing a rental charge of #3.4m associated with the
restructuring.
Chief executive Andrew Coppel pointed out that there was an underlying
improvement of 23%, due mainly to a good rooms revenue performance.
Like-for-like occupancy was up 3.5 percentage points to 63.6%, and
average room rate increased by 4% to #41.47. Room yield at 10% was ahead
of the market. However, conference and banqueting business and spending
in the restaurants was below expectations.
''Both these areas are being addressed purposefully,'' declared
chairman Stanley Metcalfe. The restructuring has freed resources to
improve the hotels' facilities and capital spending is gathering pace.

A MAJOR breakthrough in discussions between Britain and Argentina over
oil exploration around the Falkland Islands could open up new
opportunities for Scottish oil companies, writes GRAEME SMITH.
In what has been described by Argentinian President Carlos Menem as
the biggest leap forward in the sovereignty dispute in more than 160
years, it is expected that Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and
Argentinian Foreign Minister Guido di Tella will sign an agreement at
the UN in New York next week.
There are already extremely close links between the North-east of
Scotland and the Falklands and the stability the agreement will provide
a significant impetus towards opening up the new oil province believed
by some to be as large as the North Sea.
Aberdeen solicitors firm Ledingham Chalmers, which is involved in
helping UK oil service companies expand into areas such as Azerbaijan
and Turkey, already has an office in Falklands capital Port Stanley.
Spokesman Malcolm Laing said: ''It would be superb timing if the
agreement was signed next week because the first licensing round for the
Falklands opens on October 3.''
The opportunities in the islands had been pointed out by Peter
Campbell of Aberdeen chartered accountant Pannell Kerr Forster, who is
the Falkland Islands Government auditor. ''Things started to look
promising in the oil industry a couple of years ago when seismic surveys
suggested there were fairly sizeable quantities of oil and gas,'' said
Mr Laing.
It is understood that under the terms of the agreement, which has been
hammered out over more than three years, Britain will earn 66% of
royalties from any oil and gas discovered in waters to the east of the
Falklands and Argentina will get the rest. In waters west of the islands
towards Argentina it will be a 50-50 split.
Exploration licences for eastern Falklands waters would be issued by
the British, while the tender for the western waters would be handled by
a bi-national commission.

BRITISH business will be sending its clearest message yet to the
Government on European Issues with the Confederation of British Industry
and the British Chambers of Commerce joining forces to hold the
biggest-ever survey on Europe.
The survey, which will be carried out by MORI, will be sent to 5000
individual companies. Questions will cover UK membership of the EU, the
agenda for the Inter-Governmental Conference, the Single Market, EMU and
social affairs.
The results will be published in a joint press conference at CBI
headquarters on Monday, November 6.
CBI director-general Aidan Turner commented. ''The CBI is delighted to
be teaming up with the BCC on this important survey. '' He said the
results would cut through to the heart of what business really feels
about Europe, and send a very clear message to the Government about how
to proceed at next year's IGC.''

THE owners of The Herald have dropped their bid to buy the rival
Scotsman and Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal titles.
Caledonian Publishing announced last night that its offer for the two
papers had lapsed and that it was now thinking of buying other
newspapers instead.
The withdrawal of Caledonian from the fray will strengthen the arm of
Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, which was seen as
the main competitor to buy the Edinburgh-based Scotsman.
Liam Kane, chief executive of Caledonian, said last night that the
company had bid a ''fair price'' for the titles, which suggests that
Associated Newspapers had offered over the odds for the two morning and
two evening papers included in the sale.
In a statement issued by the company, Mr Kane stated: ''Our vision is
to build a strong Scottish newspaper group, responsive to local needs,
and with a clear strategy to expand and create jobs and wealth.
Caledonian intended to do that from a pan-Scottish base if the bid were
successful but we will now do it from Glasgow.
''The regional newspaper market is in a state of flux at the moment
and there are many opportunities around. We fully intend to expand this
company both organically and by acquisition when the right opportunities
arise.''
The Thomson Corporation announced in July that Scotsman Publications
and Aberdeen Journals were up for sale and, by last week, had received
what it called a ''significant number'' of indicative offers.
Negotiations are now taking place with the bidders and a final
announcement of who is taking over is not expected for several weeks.
Meanwhile, Mr Kane has emphasised that, although it has now withdrawn,
the company's investors and bankers were fully behind the bid.
Looking to the future, he said Caledonian would achieve a 25% increase
in operating profits in this financial year and that, with operating
profits of more than #10m, it was a ''substantially profitable''
company.
He added: ''With promotional campaigns for both our newspapers (The
Herald and Evening Times) currently under way, a new dynamism in our
advertising sales operation, and the launch of our electronic
superhighway publishing business, our prospects for next year are very
good indeed, despite continuing concern over the world price of
newsprint.''

PRESIDENT Theodore Roosevelt had no high regard for the Upper House of
Congress about which he observed: ''When they call the roll in the
Senate, the senators do not know whether to answer 'present' or 'not
guilty'.'' Having just come back from the Land of the Free I can assure
old Teddy that nothing has changed.
We have certainly had major scandals in British political life in
recent years but none, I would suggest, to rival the saga of Senator Bob
Packwood, a man who rose to be the second most important figure in the
House, chairman of the finance committee, the equivalent, if you will,
of Kenneth Clarke; or should that be Michael Heseltine or might it be
John Prescott or Gordon Brown? Probably not Mr Prescott if Tony has
anything to do with it.
In any case, the bold Bob, a Republican representative from Oregon for
the past 27 years, has, for at least a quarter of a century it now
emerges, been fornicating, fixing, and flinging the booze back with any
willing partner and quite a few who were not.
Oh, and all the time he kept a record of the conquests in his diary.
Yet this was the man who obviously enjoyed the full confidence of his
party managers and was promoted with the blessing of Senator Robert
Dole, the majority leader in the House and the favourite to take the
Republican nomination for the US presidency. Indeed Senator Dole
described his colleague as ''a warm-hearted human being''. Warm blooded,
definitely. There were, according to Packwood himself, full sexual
relations with 22 members of his staff, plus another 75 ''passionate
encounters''. Those, according to the women who bravely complained,
consisted mainly of a drunken grope in an elevator.
Did no-one suspect what was going on -- none of the other senators,
his wife -- now ex -- and where was the great investigative American
media? Watergate seems a very long time ago.
I watched Senator Packwood make his resignation speech to the Senate;
belatedly, in a 40,000 page report, the ethics committee had unanimously
recommended his dismissal. He took the smoking gun.
Yet there was no sign of remorse. A slight figure -- Central Casting
would have put him into the best-friend roles, Bob Cummings parts --
Packwood admitted only to ''a few stolen kisses'' and bathetically took
us through his legislative career, his voice trembling.
He may yet go to jail, but I wouldn't hold your breath, the old-boy
network thrives in the States too. What made this disgraceful business
all the more remarkable were two simultaneous events. One was the
conference of the Christian Coalition, at which almost all Republican
presidential hopefuls have to promise that if Jesus wants them for a
sunbeam, they will shine for him each day, and that there will be no
legal abortions, nowhere, no way.
And the other was the emergence of former General Colin Powell. The CC
supporters managed to play a leading role in the downfall of George Bush
last time, forcing him to take ever more extreme positions on social
issues -- and they might well do the same to Dole, who is a civilised,
if short-tempered, man but desperate for the nomination because he knows
this is his final throw.
In quiet moments Dole may reflect he could do without both the support
of the Christian Coalition and the Newt Gingrich revolution which has
brought so many right-wing firebrands into the Senate and the House of
Representatives. He dare not say any such thing.
Indeed Dole knows that should his campaign falter or his poll ratings
slip, and there are signs of both, he might be dropped from the ticket
to make way for Mr Powell perhaps? Well, hold on a dang minute there
Elmer, what exactly do we know about Colin Powell? He had a mildly
distinguished military career, not exactly shining in Vietnam but doing
well in skirmishes when his side vastly outnumbered the enemy.
He appears a perfectly decent bloke who must have overcome
considerable prejudice to achieve the rank he did. For Mr Powell is
black, even though, rather like Michael Jackson, he appears to become
paler by the month. Will the rednecks in the Republican ranks actually
vote for a black candidate? They just might, provided he espoused all
the right opinions. Unfortunately Powell does not.
He insists he believes in a woman's right to have an abortion, in
helping certain disadvantaged groups, in limited gun control and no
compulsory prayers in schools. This may make him a nice guy, it is
unlikely to make him President.
Why should it? Mr Powell has not published a single political idea, he
has been elected to nothing, he represents no constituency, no-one has
the slightest notion how he would stand up to the kind of scrutiny a
putative President must face. To field him as ''the common man''
candidate only exposes the weakness of the American system.
Another former President, Herbert Hoover, declared: ''When we get very
sick we want an uncommon doctor, when we get into a war we dreadfully
want an uncommon general or an uncommon admiral. Why is it only in
politics we are satisfied with the common man?
''We are in danger of developing the cult of mediocrity.''
It has arrived. For while the Republicans bungle about trying to
please big business and the Bible bashers, scaring moderate opinion in
the process, the Democrats have no hesitation in naming their
standard-bearer.
President Bill Clinton is not an outstanding leader, his private life
came through a most searching examination only because of the loyalty of
his wife. But he is moving up in the polls, he is every inch a
professional politician, and I will be more than surprised if he is not
returned for a second term.

WHEN Bertrand Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature his
acceptance speech was about ''politically important desires''. These he
split into two categories. ''In the primary group come the necessities
of life: food and shelter and clothing. When these things become very
scarce, there is no limit to the efforts that men will make, or to the
violence that they will display, in the hope of securing them.''
There is abundant proof that poverty is socially destructive. In a
materially acquisitive society the poor are daily reminded of their
poverty. If goods define your worth then the poor are worthless. If
possession is all that matters then how you come to possess things is
immaterial. There is no ethic except that your ploy or scam works, or
that you don't get caught.
In today's rat race the winners usually call themselves pragmatists,
in other words adherents to a philosophy which asserts that the value of
ideas consist not in their truth but in their success. This would
validate triumphant fascism or a triumphant Pol Pot.
If it works it's right, sounds sensible, but file down a piece of
worthless metal until it fits an automatic vending machine, if it works
is it right? There are no value judgments in such an outlook.
Pragmatism suits the career politician like a glove. The soundbite
works, so it's right. If some truths are currently unpopular, ditch
them. Tax policy is not an instrument of fiscal policy but a means of
bribing electors, and to be judged by whether it works. Political
science has been subsumed by psephologists. Political scientists give us
party political versions of the weather forecast, with statistical
extrapolations, swingometers, and cold fronts moving over Labour or Tory
heartlands.
Politics was primarily about how we should live; the clash of minds in
debate about the future of our society, our nation, our world; about
economic and social rights, personal and collective rights, and equal
rights; matters involving value judgments and ethical choices. Politics
was about principles.
Politics today is about none of these things. It's a morass of
pettifogging politicians who seek not truth but votes, not right but
what's right for them, who would do and say anything to hold on to
power, or to secure power, and the intellectual level of political
debate is now abysmal.
John Major has never said anything that remotely sticks in the mind,
something which encapsulates a powerful sentiment, or a fresh way of
looking at things. Churchill and Macmillan did. Compared with them,
Major is an intellectual pygmy.
Tony Blair is no better. Master of the soundbite repeated ad nauseum,
whatever the question, he is clever, but so are card sharks.
There is no attempt to relate politics to economic and social
problems, demographic and technological change. Are they degrading the
fabric of our society? What are the roots of the growing drugs culture?
What is Britain's role in a changed and changing world? In the most
convulsively changing century in human history, they fiddle while
society goes to hell.
It has been the lot of most humans to have lived through times when
things hardly changed, or didn't change at all. Centuries in which
nothing much happened.
These slow-changing societies seemed more permanent, and their values
assumed the aura of eternal verities. By contrast the twentieth century
has been bedlam. Since 1900 we have acquired more information and more
knowledge than in the previous 10,000 years.
My mother was born at the turn of the century into a world without
electricity, cars, lorries, aeroplanes, telephones, radio, films,
television, computers, nuclear energy, Internet, microchips, replacement
surgery, penicillin, submarines, space travel, and a host of other
things too numerous to mention.
Our technology is light years ahead of our sociology and this creates
social mayhem and tensions. There are 20 million unemployed in the
European Union. Some blame technology, which is nonsense.
Technology hasn't made anyone redundant. It's the use of technology by
men that is the problem. The microchip is a tool like the flint. Man
sharpened the flint and used it as a tomahawk. He sharpened the flint
and used it as the cutting edge of a plough.
To view technology as a curse is like perceiving electricity from the
exclusive standpoint of the electric chair.
Modern science and technology can meet the material needs of humankind
and liberate us for a finer and, in a sense, a more spiritual life, but
the opposite is happening. Yesterday we sought facts and knowledge.
Today we are drowning in an ocean of facts. We can't handle the
knowledge available to us, or give it coherence and a wider social
purpose.
We should be planning now for a 21st century in which people work a
20-hour week, and educate our children not just for work but for the
creative use of leisure time. Our horizons are limited through lack of
vision, not opportunity.
We should be approaching the millennium confident of better things to
come, instead we do so with trepidation and fear. Law and order is
breaking down. There is no analysis of why this is happening and
political parties compete in the wielding of big sticks which in this
context is as daft as doctors treating measles by scrubbing at the
spots.
The police and courts punish those who break the law, a very necessary
function, but the basics of ordered government is rooted in consent.
People respect the laws of a society they believe gives them hope of a
better tomorrow. Take away that hope and the moral authority of society,
which underpins our laws, then evaporates.
In Britain today we have youngsters unemployed, unemployable, without
hope, trapped in an environment of failure and a culture of despair.
They become demoralised, some brutalised. Michael Howard gives them boot
camps and Jack Straw wants to drive vagrants off the streets.
Labour, I thought, would provide the answers but, Blair and his chums,
consumed by career ambitions, can't see beyond their next soundbite.
What the hell, maybe the vagrants have a point.

NOW look, I know investigative journalists usually go undercover to
expose flagrant injustice and have their faces freely restyled, or worse
meet Roger Cooke up the same alley in the dark. I would have done it,
honest.
Sadly though, on reflection, it seemed unlikely that I'd pass for a
17-year-old apprentice hairdresser, even with a pair of black hot pants
and a borrowed blazer. Unless they are desperate for a Janette Krankie
lookalike.
It may not have escaped your notice, even if it did for a while that
of an embarrassment of Bearsden teachers, but something similar's just
been done. What, by the way, if police were to act on the urgings of all
those ponderous, po-faced souls with excitement leaking out of their
ears who want Brandon Lee prosecuted for being too old? What could they
arrest him for?
Brandon Lee, alias Bruce Lachlan MacKinnon, you are hereby charged
that you did shamelessly and wilfully pose as a smart, polite, extremely
clever, impeccably well-behaved schoolboy to gain four A-grade Highers
and a university place and that you did heedlessly and with no malice
aforethought cause a great deal of mirth and admiration amongst the
lieges who frankly don't know what the fuss is about . . .
Let's stop kidding on. It's a wonderful story and it made us smile. So
he's an imposter. What's new? Other people get to reinvent themselves.
Look at Jeffrey Archer, with his non-existent degree, who makes a habit
of it. He got to be chairman of the Conservative Party. Or the bosses of
public utilities who adopt totally new identities as chairmen of
privatised monopolies to reward themselves with huge amounts of our
dosh.
No, I thought, if for the purposes of investigating the jobs market I
am to impersonate a young applicant for a job as a trainee stylist --
all right then, her mum -- safer to do it by phone. There were just the
five jobs in the sits vac column of the evening paper. There were three
vacancies in sauna parlours, a job griddling bits of dead animal in a
burger bar, and an ad for a top Edinburgh hair salon looking for two
apprentice stylists. The pay was #50 a week. #50. A Week?
WHEN I got through, Leighanne was out but Christine was there to
answer all my questions. Yes, she yawned, it's a three-year traineeship.
The juniors wash and clean the salon, and launder the towels. They also,
and this was the thrilling bit, get to stand beside one stylist every
day and learn. In exchange for instruction in the intricacies of
squirting gel, they get to work six days a week, get one in three
Sundays off, work late two nights a week, and, oh the generosity, stay
on late every Monday evening to be instructed in the mysteries of
perming, colouring, and cutting.
Now, some 20 mumble years ago, I had a Saturday job as the ham-slicing
operative in a corner shop. I also had an after-school job delivering
Milanda pan and assorted fancies and dainties to the toffs of Newington.
Yes, yes, those were the days when we only had one shoe between the four
of us and took turns to hop to school, but even with my admittedly
limited arithmetical skills I can work out that I earned more in an hour
then than the youngsters employed by that expensive salon do today.
It's cheap labour. And no doubt hundreds of job-hungry youngsters will
apply. It's even less than the #1 an hour Burger King was embarrassed to
be rumbled paying a student.
What strikes me is that even five years ago we would have been
appalled by such exploitation. Such has been the success of the strategy
of creating a low-wage economy that there is now official joy at
outperforming the Italians. Every region of Britain, except the
South-east of England, has lower labour costs than southern Italy.
Don't take my word for it. Listen to Howard Davies, former
director-general of the CBI, new deputy governor of the Bank of England,
who argues that growth in inequality must be halted if we are to avoid
paying a high price for social division. Over the past 15 years the gap
between rich and poor has widened faster in the UK than in any other
developed country except New Zealand.
Since wages councils were abolished the pay of those at the bottom of
the heap has kept on dropping. Those who make the Orphic effort to haul
life back up the slope, and find a job, see no reward for reaching the
summit. Why bother? Because most people, like Brandon Lee, hope for a
better life. And that takes imagination on 64p an hour.

TERRIBLE things, leaks. Just imagine the horror of the hardworking
politician faced with the sickening realisation that the public, of all
people, have discovered what he is really thinking. Imagine the shock.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was certainly shocked.
You could tell, couldn't you? After all, just what sort of stinker is
it who could release to the press a totally private and highly
confidential memorandum on the ''darker side of nationalism'' and do so
-- some people will stop at nothing -- just as the SNP was due to meet
in Perth for its national conference? How could the timing have been
worse?
Mr Robertson was so shocked he courageously retracted not a word of
the alarming document, even though it made perfectly clear that what he
really thinks about the curse of nationalism is precisely what everyone
always knew he thought. The political world has been rocked to its
foundations.
But here's a thing: the Shadow argues in his top-secret, eyes-only
paper that divisions of opinion within the SNP are ''useful''. This, if
one follows the logic, is because some Nats are ''right in spotting that
the proportional system to be used in the Scottish parliament will
produce an insurmountable roadblock to a separate state''.
In other words PR, even in a cut-price version designed by Labour for
its own comfort, makes it very difficult (''virtually impossible'') for
parties to achieve clear majorities. Surely this can't be why Tony
Blair, for one, has no intention of ever allowing any such
''insurmountable roadblocks'' to be introduced for Westminster?
The Diary, which is to leaks what Yorkshire Water is to Singing in the
Rain, senses an argument going down the drain.
Controlling interest
BY the way, does devolutionist Scottish Labour's problem with leaks
have anything to do with its inability, as recently demonstrated, to
appoint its own press officer without Walworth Road stepping in to vet
non-zombie candidates, reject all those suspected of being human, and
irritate the hell out of all concerned? We look forward to a press
release on this latest, inspiring example of decentralised party
democracy.
Lonely hearts' club
SPEAKING of Perth -- and we speak of little else -- we have discovered
a source of endless amusement in the mini-biographies of members seeking
party office contained in the Nationalists' conference programme. The
SNP being the SNP, this means just about everyone, but the list still
reads more like a very sophisticated lonely hearts column than anything
else.
Thus: ''Lunan, Mike. Well-rounded Fife, (sic) fiftyish, now living on
Arran. Seeks continuing useful employment with major political party
aiming at Independence. Unnecessary dogmatic baggage not carried.''
''Johnson, Peter. Devolution: been there, seen that, boring!!
Independence: go for it, dudes.''
''Stronach, Sandy. With his Sean Connery hairstyle he gives his bond
to shake, not stir, Scottish politics, if he gets his licence to fill a
post.''
''Wailes, Cllr John. 'Junior' is the boy Labour love to hate in the
council chambers. John Godfrey look-alike, but don't let that put you
off!''
''Topping, Cllr Brian 'There's no stopping.' Chairman public
protection committee on Grampian region, been regional councillor 9[1/2]
years, district councillor 1[1/2] years, unopposed at Aberdeenshire
council election. Have a nice day!''
Party on, patriot dudes.
Jobs in pipeline
WET, Wet and (legal advice on our trademark position pending) Wet:
Good news from Grampian, where the regional council and Crown Estates
announce the re-opening of the former Caledonian Glenlivet Water Company
bottling plant.
The new-born Speyside Glenlivet Water Company says it expects to be
employing 30 people in, appropriately enough, the spring. If not sooner.
Literary illusion
IN THIS Diary we leave literature to our betters, especially those
wise and erudite people busily defining the cultural Zeitgeist in the
books section of the Sunday Times. You can learn a lot from them.
Last weekend, for example, we learned an awful lot from a column
announced as ''John Fletcher on Maupassant's unforgettable masterpiece,
Madame Bovary''. Of course the boy Flaubert thought Emma's adventures
pretty unforgettable too, if memory serves, but perhaps that was another
Mrs Bovary entirely.
Next week: Alex Salmond on George Robertson's A la recherche du memos
perdu.
Lurid docs
TELEVISION'S lust for documentaries bothered less with the great
questions of the day and more with the sort of things people get up to
when they are being no better than they should be grows apace.
The classified ads of one of the London papers shows, for example,
that it is not just great minds who think alike. TV companies do it too.
One ad reads: ''Have you led a double life? Did guilt about a
professional secret ruin your marriage?'' This is followed by an
invitation to contact a researcher. Below, yet another discreet ad
inquires: ''Did an illicit affair change your life for the better? If
you've got a story to tell, please call Claire . . .''
From all this the Diary deduces that in six months' time viewers will
be up to their eyes in confessional lurid docs that look, sound, and
educate the way soaps look, sound, and educate, but that's the price we
pay for the best television service in the world, noble tradition of
John Grierson and all that, eh? Just in case there was any doubt, the
ads are listed under ''Entertainments''.
Dead cheap
MAKING a killing: ''Murder mystery at Winnock Hotel, Loch Lomond.
Witness the murder, solve the crime. A night of murder is only #45 DB&amp;B
pp.''
Interestingly, the advertisement in questions adds that a second night
costs from only #25. Presumably that just covers assault to severe
injury and a light continental breakfast.
Bouncing back
THERE'S something up with the set again. John Drummond, stepping down
as boss of the Promenade Concerts, promised he would ban balloons from
the Last Night. So just who were the inflatables with the plastic flags
and the traditional funny eyes bouncing all over our TV the other night?

I WAS interested in Lachie Kennedy's report (September 19) about the
Inter-City train which failed to stop at Slough but did not cause
sufficient delay for passengers to claim compensation under the
provisions of the Citizens' Charter.
That same evening I arrived at Glasgow Queen Street station in time to
catch the 16.30 service to Edinburgh. At 16.28 the conductor informed us
that the train would be delayed ''due to the late arrival of a
connecting service from Oban''. This particular service due at 15.44
duly arrived at 16.39 and the 16.30 service departed for Edinburgh at
16.44
I can understand why services are held for late arrivals when the
alternative connections are few and far between. However, with the next
service to Edinburgh being scheduled to depart at 17.00 I was puzzled as
to why it was so important to hold the 16.30.
I can only think of one possible reason. Had the Oban train arrived on
time in Glasgow, customers travelling on to Edinburgh would have a
connection giving an arrival time of 16.50. Had these customers had to
await the 17.00 service their advertised arrival time would be 17.50 --
one hour late and eligible to claim compensation.
As the delayed 16.30 service arrived in Edinburgh at 17.33 the Oban
customers' delay was less than one hour and they were ineligible for
compensation.
Am I being cynical in suggesting that the 16.30 was held at Glasgow
not due to any altruistic desire by ScotRail to help the Oban customers
but rather to avoid the possibility of a few compensation claims?
If so, it is a shabby way to treat the 200-300 customers already on
board the 16.30 who are required by ScotRail to pay premium fares on
this particular service.

While justified credit goes to the successful Fort William
sleeper-train campaigners, the Government will draw even greater
satisfaction at achieving all the other planned cuts in their entirety
(Highlands hail mission impossible, September 15).
Retention of a one or two-coach rump to Fort William was always held
in reserve as a cheap-at-the-price sop to those troublesome northern
natives, but with an unwavering Government determination to butcher
other socially and economically useful sleeper links from Central
Scotland and Carlisle to Bristol, Plymouth/ London, all Anglo-Scottish
Motorail services, ScotRail's summer tourist trains, and all InterCity
overnight seated facilities between Scottish cities and London.
Although the apparently pro-privatisation ScotRail management seem to
regard such supposedly marginal loss of business as tolerable, the
enforced abandonment of overnight long-haul customers has now bitten
into the core of rail's credibility as a mass carrier on its own
arterial routes.
The chilling justification from the franchising director was, bluntly,
that you lot in Scotland are now adequately catered for by the tedium of
overnight buses if you can't fork out the #50 return supplement needed
for the limited number of sleeping berths still on offer.
Only Government puppets, and a thoroughly servile rail management,
could posture that an administration which deliberately transfers
InterCity rail passengers on to parallel motorways will seriously
tolerate supporting our lightly used rural outposts for another seven
more subsidy-demanding years.
The Government's continued refusal to invest in a modern, competitive,
and better used ScotRail system is far more indicative of future
reality, than paper promises to retain bits and pieces of a stagnating
system it holds in such general contempt.

THE disclosure by David Ross of the so-called competitive Skye Bridge
tolls (except for commercial vehicles) does not convince Highlanders
that they will ever see a toll-free bridge (September 16).
There is a lesson to be learned from the announcement of the Channel
Tunnel company's need to suspend interest payment on its massive debt
due to traffic attracted by the Channel ferry companies' cut-price
fares, and also the increased profits by one of the operators, P &amp; O.
Had the existing CalMac Kyle-Kyleakin ferry service been operated by
such as P &amp; O instead of a state-controlled operation, would the bridge
consortium have been allowed by the Scottish Office a virtual monopoly
to collect excessive tolls when a private operator not required to
cross-subsidise less economical longer sea routes could easily and
drastically undercut present ferry charges?

IN the recent brouhaha about Temazepam the two most obvious questions
seem scarcely to be commented on. First, why in a country of less than
five million people does it take nearly a million prescriptions of this
stuff to get the population to sleep?
Secondly, why do young people experimenting with illegal drugs seem
willing to go to any lengths to get hold of a standard sleeping pill?
As to the first question, one of the most obvious changes that has
taken place in the drug scene in the last decade is the recognition that
the biggest single group of drug users is those who are ''hooked'' on
prescription drugs.
With great sadness many of them have come to see themselves as ''NHS
junkies''. Unpleasant questions have then to be asked about who then are
the suppliers and dealers in this megabuck drug market.
It is about time the pharmaceutical companies were grouped with the
brewers and the tobacco companies with their major role in comforting
the poor and unemployed.
Given the extent to which the Government is ''hooked'' on the taxes
from the drugs it has legalised, we can be sure that, despite pious
noises from the Scottish Office, London will not permit anything which
might interfere with the vast profits of the pharmaceutical industry.
As to the second question, since the image conjured up is of drugs
being ''evil'', ''poisonous'', etc, of those who supply them being the
ultimate threat to democracy, and of ''addicts'' being variously
described as bad, mad, and/or sad, how can it be explained that the
staple diet of the average drug user relies on pills that streets in
certain areas are awash with?
Of course, it is all part of the buzz for drug users to be seen as
people with #100-a-day habits, linked to Colombian cartels, chased by
the cops, terrifying the denizens of leafy suburbs. The truth is so much
more prosaic.
The vast majority of drug users had a heavy nicotine habit at 13 or
14, quite illegally it might be pointed out. Booze gets them into too
much bother unless leavened with a bit of hash.
So the next thing is a bit of ducking and diving in the black market
and swallowing a few sleeping pills. It's not much of a life, true, but
it is better than having nothing to do at all.
And now the extra wee thrill of the threat of two years with your pals
in the jail (costing about #500 a week) if you are caught by the
''busies'' (who have never yet managed to catch anyone selling nicotine
to under 16s).
It's not so bad. In school they told us that 100 years ago you got
hanged for stealing a sheep.

IF you despair of local information on travel, as the Rev Henry Cook
does (September 4), despair no longer. Bradshaw lives again, in the
guise of Southern Vectis, which has produced a 750-page tome describing
2500 routes run by 400 operators, serving 10,000 towns and villages, a
worthy successor to Barry Doe's Bus Guide, which listed the services,
but not the times.
It has additionally a premium-rate inquiry service on 0891 910910,
which if required can supply the details of the 29 local bus services
which will convey you from Land's End to John O' Groats, departing at
07.55 on a Monday and arriving at 13.55 the following Saturday.
Other groups offer further help in journey planning if the traveller
is elderly or disabled, but damningly, as Mr Cook notes, they are almost
all individual labours of love, or independent charitable organisations,
as opposed to formal official bodies.
Bus services can work, and recent developments in low-floor accessible
buses, etc, have rewarded the operators with public response and
increased patronage. The Tall Ships park-and-ride services were a
success in through ticketing and commercial co-operation, and
opportunities to extend this day-to-day services are there but for the
initiative of the operators, and institutions to support them through
encouraging corporate use of public transport.
With the current melee within the transport infrastructure we must
ensure that every enhancement is capitalised on to greatest effect by
making the potential customers aware of the benefits available.

IN his article on the East of Scotland retail market in your
Commercial/Industrial Property Review, Ian Cunningham referred to
''Edinburgh District Council's stated objective of reducing the number
of car-parking spaces in town'' (September 14).
The Central Edinburgh Local Plan states: ''The council will support
proposals to increase the amount of car-parking for public short-stay
use in the central area by new developments in suitable locations, the
temporary use of vacant development sites, and the conversion of
existing private non-residential car-parking to public short-stay use.''
The council, together with Lothian Regional Council, does attempt to
control very strictly the amount of private car-parking for commuter
use, which is the main source of traffic congestion in the city. We are
also keen to encourage the replacement of on-street public parking by
public parking in off-street locations but, as the above quotation from
the local plan makes clear, we are anxious to encourage short-stay
car-parking and we fully recognise its importance in maintaining the
vitality of the city centre as a retail location.
In general, I feel that in Edinburgh we have been successful in
balancing the development of out of town shopping facilities and new
district centres with the need to protect the central area retail core
and the current level of rentals in Princes Street would seem to bear
this out.

AS a weekly aeroplane commuter to London, it seems recently as if I've
been selected as the Good Samaritan who is placed next to passengers
petrified of flying. On my last three trips from London to Edinburgh,
I've played my calming role with some success. One woman actually looked
out of the window.
It would be very helpful if the flight crews remembered that a fair
number of passengers are nervous and a few verbal advance references to
engine noise changes in the descent and on final approach would be most
welcome.
British Midland pilots all have a wonderful policy of thanking
passengers for flying with the airline at 33,000ft halfway between
London and Edinburgh and then they sign off with a goodbye. Not the
greatest way for encouraging confidence. Indeed, I have looked out
several times to see if the crew had actually left with their
parachutes. They should pass on the thanks after the successful landing.
The problem is not British Midland's alone, British Airways pilots
also could do better with their passenger information.

THE Court of Session will be asked to decide whether it is lawful to
withdraw life-sustaining tube-feeding from a 50-year-old woman who has
been in a vegetative state for three-and-a-half years. This is the first
time a Scottish court will face such a case, one which raises profound
legal and ethical issues.
These cases invite debate about the aims and practice of medicine, the
nature of living and dying well, and the appropriate place of law in
what some see as an issue best left to family and doctors.
The court's decision will relieve the agony of decision-making for the
husband and relatives of Janet Johnston. They seek withdrawal to allow
her ''death in peace and with dignity''. They have not reached this
decision lightly. ''To proceed with the court case has been the most
difficult and painful decision we have ever had to make,'' they say.
The decision may clarify and develop the law as decided by several
comparable English cases. It is expected to clarify the legal framework
in Scotland for making health-care decisions for adults who are
incapable of doing so themselves.
While there is opposition to the withdrawal of tube-feeding in such
cases, it is instructive to examine the facts of this case.
Janet Johnston has been unconscious for three-and-a-half years and has
been provided with round-the-clock care at Law Hospital, Carluke. She is
in what doctors call ''persistent vegetative state'' and as such has
lost that part of her brain that allows thinking. Her lower brain,
however, remains intact and allows breathing, eye movement, and
digestion. A patient in this condition cannot see, hear, taste, or
smell.
The patient is incapable of voluntary movement and meaningful
communication, cannot feel pain, and requires aid with bowel evacuation.
There is no hope of recovery. She could continue to survive with such
feeding for many years.
She cannot eat by herself and is fed by tube. If this were withdrawn
she would likely die in less than two weeks of dehydration. Medical
evidence suggests that she would feel no discomfort.
Numerous organisations and professional groups internationally,
including the British Medical Association, the American Academy of
Neurology, and the Institute of Medical Ethics, state that in general it
is morally acceptable to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a
patient in a persistent vegetative state. Such a view accords with Roman
Catholic and Protestant doctrine and has recently been endorsed by the
Scottish Law Commission.
It could be argued that given the questionable medical aims, the
emotional costs to the family, and the resource implications of such
treatment, it is morally obligatory to cease such treatment after the
family has been consulted and made aware of their responsibilities.
There is sufficient legal precedent in Britain for withdrawal. In 1993
the House of Lords said that it would not be unlawful to withdraw
life-sustaining artificial nourishment from Tony Bland, left in
persistent vegetative state after injuries sustained in the Hillsborough
stadium disaster. Several English cases have followed the Bland case in
deciding that such treatment can be withdrawn if the patient shows no
sign of recovery and if it is in their best interests.
In July, the Irish Supreme Court approved the withdrawal of artificial
tube-feeding and hydration from a 45-year-old woman in near-persistent
vegetative state, but with minimal cognitive capacity, on the basis that
it was in her best interests and in accord with her constitutional right
to life.
The Court of Session may decide that it is inappropriate to speak of
best interests in an individual who appears to have no capacity for
self-regarding interests. Equally, it would seem misleading to speak of
the irrecoverably unconscious patient dying with dignity and in peace.
Modern technology sustains patients whose prolonged existence in a
non-responsive state -- not dead but not quite alive in the common sense
of that word -- challenges conventional understanding. The court may
need to skirt the quicksands of emotive language and rhetoric to find
more intellectually solid ground on which to base a decision which may
have implications beyond the the present case.
It is to be hoped that the court will declare that withdrawal of
treatment in these circumstances does not constitute homicide. Doctors
and nurses in Scotland need a clear declaration that such withdrawal is
unlikely to expose them to criminal prosecution. Such a declaration
would be consistent with the approach of courts world-wide that have
examined this issue. It may also provide an opportunity to defuse claims
that such withdrawal sets a precedent for medically-assisted suicide.
The court has an unique opportunity to remove or alter traditional
control by the medical profession over these issues. Such decisions need
proper framing in law. The standard for decisions should not be what
doctors or even a body of doctors would believe is appropriate, as
decided by several judges in the Bland case. The recent Irish Supreme
Court decision shows that while medical evidence is necessary to
establish a patient's condition and prospects, it need not influence a
court's decision in law whether, and under what circumstances, to
withdraw.
Nor should such decisions be left to the family. The rights of
vulnerable individuals should not depend on the discretion of relatives.
The court can establish, under its protective jurisdiction, the
criteria to be followed in future cases. The Scottish Law Commission has
usefully proposed that, given acceptable criteria for decision-making,
courts can be by-passed unless there are exceptional circumstances. Such
a proposal can protect rights and save on costly, time-consuming, and
emotionally draining litigation.
The Court of Session may decide, consistent with the approach of many
American courts, that Janet Johnston's previous wishes, values, and
preferences show that she would not have wished to remain captive to an
emotionally and financially costly intrusive medical technology that
offers no cure or improvement in her condition.
Her case underlines the need for greater use of advance directives
about medical treatment to help doctors and family decide whether or
not, and if so how, to treat an incompetent patient. When such
incapacity confronts us all, but increasingly in a population with
growing prevalence of dementia, it also suggests that doctors overcome
their traditional reluctance and engage in better communication about
end-of-life decisions with patients.
For now, issues of life or death, propriety of treatment, and suitable
decision-making are at stake before the Court of Session.

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, was sounding
breezily confident yesterday. As he is well aware, the current state of
the economy is the subject of considerable debate. Either it is heading
for sustained low-inflationary growth or the possibility of further
recession is drawing nearer. In his first substantial public statement
since the summer the Chancellor appears not to be in two minds on this,
but then he has never been known for irresolution. Basically Mr Clarke
would have none of the second proposition. His line is defiantly clear
and consists of an insouciant confidence in the brightness of Britain's
economic prospects. He made all the sensible noises in his speech to
engineering industry leaders by emphasising his intention to continue
the fight against inflation and by playing down any suggestion of
substantial tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget. This was only to be
expected, although it is obvious that any sensible politician in his
position could gain political points by denying substantial tax cuts
frequently and vehemently enough, only to make everyone glad for the
small cuts he might actually feel able to introduce.
The really important phrase in his speech, and one which he will be
held to, is his insistence that the possibility of tax cuts depends on
the control of public spending ''. . . without damaging key public
services''. Of course, this promise needs to be defined. Which are the
key public services, and what constitutes damage in the Conservative
Chancellor's eyes? Nevertheless it is an important promise and one which
will not be forgotten, either by the public or by Mr Clarke's many
anxious opponents on the Tory back benches who are keen to slash public
services in exchange for tax cuts but who would define the necessary
public services in a worryingly minimalist way. Nevertheless, there are
at least two planks missing from Mr Clarke's platform. The evidence of a
slowdown in the economy could be partly explained by firms destocking.
Growth could resume if consumer demand improves and if corporate
investment increases. Unfortunately there is precious little evidence of
either of these important indicators.

I WOULD like to add to Michael Fry's review of the Faber Book of
Treachery, with particular reference to Norman Baillie-Stewart's sale
(for #90) of military secrets to the Germans (September 18).
These were details of the Vickers A1E1 Independent tank of 1925, so
named because it was intended to operate independently of the infantry,
a forerunner of the present-day main battle tank.
The machine was ahead of its time and although it never passed the
prototype stage the Germans were able to incorporate some of its
features in the development of their own armour.
Incidentally, Baillie-Stewart's involvement with German military
intelligence was brought about through sexual entrapment, in a park, by
an agent while he was on holiday in that country.
The suppression of the Independent tank was symptomatic of the
criminal neglect of the armoured fighting vehicle by those in power in
this country at a critical stage in our history.
The lack of vision and the meanness and obstinacy of politicians,
Treasury officials, and other civil servants, combined with Service
rivalries, resulted in the British Army not having a tank worthy of its
name -- and of the bravery of its crews -- until the appearance of the
American M4A1 General Sherman armed with our 17-pounder gun in the last
year or so of the war.
It is largely forgotten now that Baillie-Stewart was the original Lord
Haw-Haw. He was so named by a Fleet Street journalist in September 1939,
because of his clipped manner of speaking. When William Joyce, with his
egregious nasal drawl, replaced him shortly afterwards, he inherited the
title which is generally associated with him.
Also, the Legion of St George, a motley collection of subverted
prisoners-of-war, soon became the British Free Corps. There were
probably never more than 50 or so in its ranks, and they contributed
little but embarrassment to the Germans.

DEREK Parker's attempt to equate the sacking of Berwick by Edward I in
1296 with the pillaging of Hexham in a reprisal by an invading Scottish
army in the same year is surely misplaced (September 15).
In the first instance nearly one hundred times as many Scottish lives
were lost than were English lives in the second instance. On the Richter
scale of medieval atrocities the sacking of Berwick ranks pretty high,
and has indeed been described by a reputable historian, Dr James MacKay,
as ''the worst atrocity ever to stain the pages of English history''.
Moreover, it would surely have been more compassionate of Mr Parker to
have clearly recognised that neither atrocity would have occurred had it
not been for the determination of Edward Plantagenet to invade and
conquer Scotland and the Scots.

THE business of football has always seemed to be an uneasy compromise
between hi-tech athleticism and the world of Charles Dickens. On the one
hand are the thoroughbreds of the business, pampered, cosseted, and
earning large sums of money but forming part of a tiny minority. On the
other hand are the hoofers, working hard, sweating mightily, and earning
very little while forming the bulk of those taking part in the game. One
thing united them whatever their abilities; they were, and are, tied to
a system of employment which should have been reformed years ago. This
is not news to those involved in football whether as employers or
employees, and particularly not to the administrators of the game who
have been asked repeatedly to come up with something more equitable.
Those requests were ignored because football is not just a matter of
tribalism on the terraces. The boardrooms are as full of powerful and
egotistical control-freaks as any mediaeval castle, and all of them,
without exception, are dedicated to doing things their own way.
Mediaeval barons would have been cuffed into order by a strong king, but
such a person does not exist in the controlling authorities of Scottish,
English, or European football.
The reluctant involvement of the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg will probably change matters. Players out of contract will no
longer be subjected to the indignities and uncertainties of the transfer
fee system; this will allow them greater personal freedom and the
opportunity to benefit from their own talents more directly. Whether
clubs will be affected as adversely as some insist is not certain.
Smaller clubs might lose revenue, but the answer for them is to identify
young players early and sign them to long contracts. Ironically, this is
just what has caused occasional problems in Scottish football, with some
teams facing accusations of damaging young players' careers by tying
them to over-long contracts. Sorting this out will be difficult, but the
removal of the three-foreigner rule is welcome. Imagine if Partick
Thistle were to sign, for instance, the entire Steau Bucharest team.
What joy!

THERE is nothing wrong with robust behaviour in politics, but we draw
the line at infantile tricks. For that reason it is hard to take
seriously the leaked memo on the SNP from the Shadow Scottish Secretary,
Mr George Robertson, even although it makes some sensible points. As we
are in the approach to a General Election we must expect a harder edge
to the way the political parties deal with each other. The Tories have
put in place that notably rough bruiser, Dr Brian Mawhinney, and the
Liberal Democrats are similarly unable to present themselves as
unsullied angels. But for instinctive and institutionalised mischief it
is often hard to beat the Labour Party. The Littleborough and
Saddleworth by-election displayed Labour's rougher behaviour but there
were enough aspects of it visible at Perth and Kinross and Monklands to
remove any suspicions that the party had simply been caught on a bad
day. Mr Blair is adept at one aspect of it, as was clear from the way in
which he deflated the beginning of the Liberal Democrats conference in
Glasgow by suggesting that they should discuss those areas where their
policies overlapped. This encouraged the Lib Dems either to argue with
each other or to indulge in a continuous and unedifying stream of easy
abuse of the Labour Party.
Mr Robertson has continued the trend by laying a number of charges
against SNP policies, many of which are quite sensible, but which are
intriguingly livened by hints of nationalist extremism. The manner in
which this document was brought to light is best ignored; suffice to say
that it looks nothing like an internal document and more like a press
release, which we suspect it is. The aim was obviously to damage the
first day of the SNP conference. In fact, the first day was so dreary
that Mr Robertson may have done the SNP a favour. Nevertheless, he has a
good point in his strictures about the need for senior SNP officials to
choose their words carefully, and to avoid emotive descriptions of
opponents. Nobody in their senses believes that the SNP supports any
extremists; but nationalism, almost by definition, requires another
party to grind against. Great care must be taken to avoid unwittingly
giving encouragement to non-democratic elements, and the SNP should note
this. And all parties should note the need for grown-up, responsible
behaviour.

GIVEN that the Festival Theatre has, in a comparatively short space of
time, made Edinburgh the place to see dance it was somehow appropriate
that the 500,000th person to buy a ticket was in last night's audience
-- and rather nice too that he turned out to be a young Glasgow-based
artist, B Hartley, who draws dance! Paul Iles handed over some rewarding
champagne, and all those who wished they'd booked earlier settled back
and waited for Phoenix to fizz and sparkle instead.
Now, time was that fizzing at full, unstoppered tilt was essentially
what you got from this company. Sometimes it was high energy, athletic
fizz, sometimes it was fizz with an edge of social or political
attitude. The energy and attitude are still in there -- when the dancers
choose to explode into action, the effect is, as ever electric -- but
now there's a cooler, laid-back element in the new work that suggests
the company is starting to believe its own publicity about being
established and even internationally acclaimed!
Chantal Donaldson's Never Still sets three couples -- in acid-hot
orange, green, and peacock -- strutting and inter-acting with a kind of
streetwise sassiness that finds echoes in the music and chitchat of the
urban soundscore.
By comparison, the elaborate ambitions of Movements In 8 -- live
onstage jazz 'n' funk from Orphy Robinson, singers and musicians,
complemented by specifically choreographed dance -- seemed curiously
drab and even untogether.
It was as if everything had been allowed to go into freefall in the
hope that it would all land on its feet.
Eclipsing both these pieces, however, was the revived Haunted Passages
by Philip Taylor -- a compellingly dramatic and intense cameo of three
individuals caught within their own anxieties, their movements juddering
and nervy with implicit tensions.
This alone was worth the whole evening -- sometimes fizz can be
insubstantial, one looks for stiller, deeper waters.

By l998 the People's Palace museum will be all renewed to celebrate
its own centenary in birthday clothes. William Hunter describes today's
reopening
ANOTHER opening today at the People's Palace museum on Glasgow Green
produces another kind of show. Modern technology has been added.
Computers, film wizardry, and magical electronics have been harnessed to
a wounded warhorse that has had to fight several battles of its own as
it carried the city's story on its back for all of this century.
While the tale told is the same, it now moves to a faster, brighter
script. Really, the changes, with more to come, amount to a palace
revolution.
Familiar visitors will need time to adjust. Some will miss the former
permanence of the affectionate clutter of ordinary bric-a-brac and
hallowed objects. One trick is find a fondly remembered object -- say,
an Acme wringer -- and work from there.
''Every Glaswegian should be able to come in and find a part of their
lives here,'' prromised Mark O'Neill, senior curator of history.
His staff have rearranged the furniture as an efficient housewife
would. They have started at the head of the house and will work towards
the front door.
By l998 -- and a total of #1.2m later -- the museum will be all
renewed to celebrate its own centenary in birthday clothes.
Today's reopening is of the top floor, originally the picture gallery.
The heart of the show, although far from its centre, could come to be
the reconstruction of a single end from old Gorbals.
Complete in every remembered detail from blackened kitchen range to
hole-in-the-wall bed and black sink (or jawbox), the one-room family
home has pretty, pinkish, flowery linoleum and lots of shiny brass
ornaments. Pride dwells in it.
While young museum visitors will see it as only one up from living in
a cave, it is a very proper single end of the kind that was called a wee
palace.
Johnny Beattie, the comedian who grew up in a similar house, although
in Govan, said at yesterday's preview that he felt at home. He recalled
a neighbour so refined that every spring she whitewashed inside the coal
bunker in her kitchen.
In a recorded voice the father of the family of seven who live in the
museum's single end recalls that a soup pot on the hob was never far off
the boil. But he admits of the home he had provided: ''It looked like a
dormitory in here at bedtime.'' And he muses: ''It's a wonder that any
of us survived.''
How the city did better than survive is told in a series of themes.
Strangely, some of them are called ''visions''.
In the usual way, museums tell their stories by showing the things
that people did and made rather than the ideas they had or their hopes
and dreams. At the new People's Palace the belief is that ambition and
reality came closer together in Glasgow than elsewhere. In the old city
everything was possible.
''Visions were made more real in Glasgow than in any other city,'' was
how Mark O'Neill put it. ''People here took their visions seriously.''
The #300,000 exhibition has three visions. There is the capitalist's
view, the working man's (although women have their place), along with
the municipal vistas of the city fathers.
All are presented as they saw themselves. So the greedy money-makers
and exploiters of the workers are alternatively the creators of wealth
and philanthropic donors of public parks. Bolshevik layabouts are
otherwise the champions of the people, while the city leaders who
introduced clean water, municipal gas, electricity, tramcars, and even
telephones can be just daft toon cooncillors is another way of looking
at them.
If anything, the tone of the palace is now more on the side of rich
success than of popular struggle than it used to be.
While making Glasgow's story accessible, Louise King, the designer,
has avoided being enslaved by mere chronology. There is no attempt to
tell the tale of the city from the year dot up to, say, Billy Connolly's
big banana boots or the paint-spattered typewriter on which Ian Pattison
wrote two series of the Rab C Nesbitt television comedy.
Somehow to capture the abiding spirit of the city is the real trick.
Future generations of Glaswegians must be left to decide for themselves
whether it is still abroad on the Green.
For one hazard of making any changes is that the People's Palace is
itself a part of the history that it was built to record. As true a
definition as there can be of a real Glesca citizen is somebody who goes
often to the palace even when it is not raining.
It was and remains above all a treasure house of little memories that
attach to plain objects, like hurley beds, nit combs, or even Acme
wringers. Amid the bright new imagery and smooth museum display, quiet
and ordinary voices are allowed to be heard.
There is a brief reminiscence of an anonymous Bridgeton woman about
tenement life and manners.
''If a woman was coming down the stairs with a chamberpot under her
apron in the morning -- you just didn't see her,'' she recalls. ''No-one
ever told you not to. You just didn't see her and she didn't see you.''
For a first visit 90 minutes will usually suffice before museum
fatigue sets in. ''After that everybody will deserve a cup of tea,''
Mark O'Neill reckoned.

Poorly signposted but playing to full houses, the Bridewell is on the
theatrical fringe not far from the heart of London. MICHAEL KENNEDY
charts the upstaging of a historic site
IF you blink you will probably miss the entrance to Bride Lane; it's
the last little alleyway off Fleet Street to the south before Ludgate
Circus. That would be a pity, for it's home to one of the newest and
most enterprising of London's fringe theatres. The land was once
occupied by Henry VIII's Bridewell Palace and now houses St Bride's
church, St Bride's Institute -- and the Bridewell Theatre.
Unfortunately, only the church is signposted from Fleet Street (there is
a full sign, however, in New Bridge Street, the thoroughfare at right
angles that also goes into Ludgate Circus).
The Bridewell Theatre was built on the site of a Celtic well and was
originally opened as swimming baths 100 years ago servicing Victorian
and Edwardian patrons. After a period of neglect during which it was the
base for the BBC table tennis club, it was expertly converted and
restored as a highly flexible theatre. It features a wedge-shaped
auditorium of 27 x 14 metres with dozens of stage and seating options.
Up to 150 theatre-goers can be accommodated in comfort. The theatre
offers some wonderful wrought-iron pillars and corridors lined with
comforting white tiling. In 1993 the theatre opened for business. It has
its own resident theatre company, Breach of the Piece, one of whose
directors is the Bridewell Theatre's own artistic director, the
inventive, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic Carol Metcalfe from Renfrew.
A former head girl at Paisley Grammar School, Metcalfe got her taste
for the theatre at an early age. Her father, Peter Deans, had been made
redundant in the 1920s and formed the amateur Labour Exchange Players.
These were based at Renfrew YMCA and performed successfully during the
1920s and 1930s. Peter Deans briefly turned professional with the
Scottish National Players towards the end of the thirties. Babysitters
were unheard of in the Deans family.
Thus young Carol was a regular theatregoer from the age of three,
enjoying Macbeth at Glasgow Citizens' Theatre as part of a varied
theatrical diet which included a number of Scottish plays: T M (Tim)
Watson's Beneath the Wee Red Lums, James Bridie's Mr Gillie and Dr
Angelus; J M Barrie's Mary Rose and What Every Woman Knows. Carol
graduated from Glasgow University and taught in Scotland before heading
south to Sheffield, Oxford, and eventually London where she was able to
consummate her passion for the theatre.
The Bridewell Theatre is run by a board which includes Carol Metcalfe,
administrator Jacqui Coughlan, technical manager Andrew Howick and house
manager Antony Nicholls. Together they have established a strong
programme of events and attractions. Earlier successes include fine
revivals of Sondheim's Pacific Overtures, Shakespeare's A Midsummer
Night's Dream and the touching Maltby and Shire review Closer Than Ever.
The theatre's most recent attraction was an excellent revival of
Viell's rarely seen Happy End. Next year we are promised Damn Yankees.
Negotiations are already under way to mount at least one of the musicals
featured in the Vivian Ellis Awards and in the near future the Dulwich
Youth Theatre's production of Macbeth.
Metcalfe hopes for a safe run for the show. Her reason? The Bridewell
Theatre is built at a point where the principal ley lines in London
meet. It's a very spiritual place, apparently.

John Fowler visits the tiny opera house where Helen of Braemore will
be premiered
THE sad tale of the beautiful but doomed Helen Gunn, snatched from her
husband's arms on her wedding day, will be told in an opera to be
written by Edward McGuire and performed at next year's Northlands
Festival in Caithness.
''We hope it will also travel to Sweden, Norway, and hopefully Denmark
as part of Northlands Festival in 1996,'' said John Banister, announcing
the project to an invited audience at Ackergill Tower opera house -- the
tiniest and most northerly opera house in Britain -- where the work,
Helen of Braemore -- will be premiered.
Ackergill, converted by Banister from stable buildings next to a
fifteenth-century tower house, has presented intimate operas in
conjunction with Northlands Festival for the past two years. It seats 80
people, has a minuscule stage, and is just a stone's throw from the
rocky foreshore of the Pentland Firth. Wick and John O'Groats are close
by. Banister is quite happy to live with the legend that poor Helen, who
threw herself to her death from his battlements, is still at large as a
ghost.
For this year's festival, two short chamber operas, Offenbach's The
Blind Beggars and Bizet's Doctor Miracle, have been performed by the
Country Opera group, who are to present the McGuire work.
Yesterday's select audience had a foretaste of the new piece -- not so
much just one cornetto as just one song. This was an aria sung by the
young Swedish mezzo-soprano Margaretta Hillerud, who flew specially for
the occasion from the Wexford Festival where she is appearing. She will
return to Ackergill next year to create the role of Helen.
The score is for the unusual duo of viola and harp -- ''two of my
favourite instruments,'' says McGuire -- played by James Durrant,
formerly principal violist for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra,
and Judith Peacock, Mod singer and harpist with the Whistlebinkies group
for whom McGuire composes when in folk rather than classical mode.
McGuire's first opera, The Loving of Etain, also drew on legendary
material. His new score is likely to find inspiration in part from both
the Scottish and Scandinavian traditions, and the libretto will suggest
the same blend. ''It's potentially tri-lingual,'' he says. ''English
with some Scots, a little Gaelic, and possibly some lines translated
into Swedish.''
The libretto is being written by Peter Isaac, a specialist film maker
who founded Country Opera four years ago, originally with the intention
of touring chamber opera to stately homes. He first heard of the
legendary Helen when he bought a cottage near her birthplace at
Braemore, a settlement near Dunbeath.
''I'm hoping that we'll be able to tour Helen throughout Scotland
after next year's festival,'' he said.
This year's Northlands Festival, the first to link Caithness with
events in Sweden and Denmark, concludes on Saturday night with two
contrasting events -- fiddler Ally Bain with Phil Cunningham, and a
Scottish rock concert featuring Wolfstone.

THE sentiments are so laudable, the message so urgent, but Ernst
Toller's The Machine Wreckers in this English adaptation by Ashley Dukes
now has the feel itself of something of an old Luddite.
Based on the nineteenth-century English Luddites who tried to stop the
introduction of the weaving machine by destroying it, it's not that
Toller's crie de coeur is any less true now than in 1922 when he wrote
it or that the force of his apocalyptic vision of capitalism's
destructiveness setting the planet against itself is not, in our
environmentally challenged times, coming to pass. It's simply that in
dramatic terms, how Toller's Marx and Engels influence demarcations
between workers and managers now comes over as far too crude and
simplistic, like some old piece of 1970s agit-prop.
And yet, heaven knows, the soul of the piece about exploitation, the
disparity between boss and worker, the fickleness of individuals, the
potential strength of collective action, and capitalism's ultimately
deceitful rationalisation that such developments would free us all up
for more leisure time, cries out to be heard.
Sadly, however, Katie Mitchell's stolidly neo-realistic production in
Dukes's equally worthy translation, undermines a play that even in the
twenties was a major plank of the German expressionist movement. With
its symbolism and mythic overtones (the workers' attribution of almost
animalistic properties to The Machine, the killing of Jimmy Cobbett, the
visionary middle-class worker in a very Christ-like sacrifice) the play
demands a theatre of grand gesture. Despite a fine cast, unfortunately
this production renders a heart-felt play into an embarrassingly
heavy-handed one.

YEHUDA Meir Getz, the rabbi of Judaism's Wailing Wall for the last 27
years, has died at age 71 after a heart attack. He was buried on the
Mount of Olives.
He became rabbi at the Wailing Wall -- a remnant of the wall of the
biblical Temple site -- after its capture by Israel with the rest of
East Jerusalem's walled Old City in the 1967 Middle East War with Egypt.
Thousands attended the funeral, The Jerusalem Post said Getz had tried
to please both ultra-religious Jews who viewed the wall as sacred and
Israeli masses who viewed it as a national monument.
Getz immigrated from Tunisia in 1949, settling in Galilee, northern
Israel. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Israeli Army.
After his son was killed fighting for the wall in the 1967, Getz moved
to the Old City where he later becamerabbi of the wall and holy sites
nearby.

Sam McCluskie, trade union leader and greyhound racing enthusiast;
born August 11, 1932, died September 15, 1995
SAM McCLUSKIE was larger than life, and then some. Full of life, and
then some. A character. A man o'pairts who looked like a Burl Ives-type
American folk singer 'til he spoke, and then quiet flowed the doon tae
earthness of Leith's dockland. Any city, including Edinburgh, which
produces the likes of Sam McCluskie can't be all bad.
Sam was a seafarin' man who learned quickly that the cards were
stacked against the seamen. In those days the captains, answerable to
the owners, were still all mighty when the ship was at sea.
It was a tough industry to organise, at any given moment most British
merchant seamen were scattered all over the world. This left the
seamen's union open to manipulators from within, and indeed, to crooks.
There were times when some of the union leadership looked like
characters from On The Waterfront, the general secretary was perceived
to be a law unto himself.
Sam was involved in the fight for the democratisation of the union. He
joined with others in this struggle, most were on the left. They were
ultimately victorious. The union was cleaned up and made accountable to
the members, but there still persisted remnants of what might be called
the culture of the cowboy.
Sam was a gentle giant, likeable and generous minded, yet he climbed
to the top of this union, which suggests he was also as tough as old
leather. A contradiction, but then life is full of contradictions and
Sam seethed with contradictions more than most.
He was deeply involved in the seamen's strike of 1966. Prime Minister
Harold Wilson characterised the leaders as ''a tight-knit group of
politically motivated men'', meaning communists. Harold, Sam believed,
had been fitted up by M15.
''Given a bum steer,'' said Jim Slater, also a leader of the strike
and long-standing Labour Party member. Jim told me that a few years
later, as general secretary of the seamen's union, Wilson told him that
he (Wilson) had been misinformed by advisers. It is significant that
Wilson henceforth was highly suspicious of the security agencies and was
to accuse them of trying to destabilise his Governments.
It was in the eighties that Sam came to national prominence. He was
elected to the National Executive of the Labour Party. Michael Foot was
then Labour leader. A section of the left which coalesced around Tony
Benn foisted on the new leader a policy package that bore no
relationship to the prevailing political reality. This was the opinion
of another section of the left on the National Executive, which had
grouped around the Transport Union. The two groups wouldn't talk and Sam
had to act as go-between.
When Labour lost the General Election of 1983 Sam, who didn't mince
his words, spoke of Labour's ''rag, tag, and bob tail campaigning''
which was a fairly accurate assessment of Labour's electioneering.
A political party that simply reflects what people are thinking is an
unprincipled electoral machine that will do nothing to change things for
the better. On the other hand, a party that has no points of contact
with what people in general are thinking, has no chance of ever winning
an election.
In the early eighties Labour was in the latter quagmire, and Sam knew
it. Methinks Labour has now gone to the other extreme, but I was never
able to discuss this with Sam, for he was by then bearing with great
fortitude the illness that led to his death.
In 1986 he succeeded Jim Slater as general secretary of the union and
became national treasurer of the Labour Party, and then party chairman.
I remember his chairing of the party conference. He referred to women
delegates as ''hen'' as in, ''Look, hen, jist haud oan, you're next tae
speak''.
You could hear the mutterings. What is he saying? Hen? As in cock and
hen? Well, yes, but it's a term of endearment. Some women delegates went
to the standing orders committee to have Sam censured for sexist
language. He was nonplussed and meant no offence, in fact it was a token
of affection and respect where he came from. And that's the rub. We
should all take account of where people come from, Sam in his own way
did.
He retired in 1991 and came to live permanently in Edinburgh. His pals
up here like Alec Kitson, Pilmar Smith, and Jimmy Caldwell, were mostly
supporters of Heart of Midlothian, a football club of sorts. Sam was a
fervid Celtic supporter.
Some shares in the Tynecastle club came on the market and Sam bought
them just to please his pals. He came to know Wallace Mercer, club
chairman at the time. Sam's pals chided him, for Wallace was a Tory. Sam
argued that hadn't Wallace been on Thatcher's think-tank during the
period in which Tory support in Scotland had plummeted?
Sam McCluskie's great hobby was greyhound racing. He owned about 30
dogs, which were trained at Wembley. He had some very good animals
capable of winning big open races. He raced them at Powderhall in
Edinburgh, where his trainer was Jean Glass whose family also had
connections with Tynecastle.
A few years ago I was making a television documentary for Channel 4
and interviewed Sam at Powderhall during a race meeting -- about 1966
and all that. The director Ross Wilson hates formal interview situations
-- so do I -- and for Sam a backcloth of punters, bookies, and dogs
flashing by was a stick on.
That night Sam told me he had cancer and things didn't look too good.
There was no false bravado, only a calm, gentle dignified bravery. I was
upset and Sam had to comfort me. All his friends will testify, he had a
heart of gold. Anyone in trouble was helped, but he was no saint. At
times he was a scallywag but there was fun in his scallywaggery.
He was a very big man. More than 20 stones, and big in other ways. If
there's a Heaven and a good God, and just for now I'm prepared to ponder
the possibility, then Sam up there will be organising greyhound racing,
laying the odds, and downing a few haufs. And if an angel is in trouble
Sam will be consoling, ''Look hen, it's no that bad, yer wings will grow
again.''

Bill Hamilton, dental surgeon and former provost of Bearsden and
Milngavie; born February 23, 1915, died September 14, 1995
BILL HAMILTON JP, former provost of Bearsden and Milngavie District
Council, has died suddenly at the age of 80.
Standing as an Independent, Mr Hamilton first became a councillor in
the former Milngavie Town Council in 1967, and later became a bailie and
a magistrate in 1971. Following local authority reorganisation in 1975,
he became the first provost of the then new Bearsden and Milngavie
District Council. He has the distinction, as an Independent, of being
the only non-Tory provost the district has had.
His role as first provost of the district was particularly fitting as
he led the vigorous campaign to keep Milngavie out of Glasgow. The
Milngavie Boundaries Action Committee campaigned all the way to the
House of Commons and House of Lords.
A referendum on the views of local residents was held and 97% voted to
keep Milngavie out of Glasgow. Forces were also joined with committees
in Bearsden, Clydebank, and Old Kilpatrick. Pressure resulted in the
then Secretary of State finally agreeing in October 1973 to Bearsden and
Milngavie having its own district with 10 councillors, not the 0.7
councillors it would have had in the city.
The Herald reported the success thus: ''From Milngavie Town Hall to
the House of Lords the journey took 18 months. The victory was a famous
one and will go down in history.'' Bill Hamilton remained on the council
until 1984.
Mr Ronald Rae, former town clerk of Milngavie burgh recalled that
''There was a gut feeling in the whole of Milngavie that people wanted
to keep their independence and not be swallowed up in the big city.'' He
believed ''a good bit'' of the success of the campaign was due to Bill
Hamilton's activities as well as the extensive lobbying done against the
proposals.
Bill Hamilton was born in 1915 in Possilpark, Glasgow, where his
father worked as a railway foreman and engineer-fitter at Springburn.
Professionally, he worked as a dental surgeon for 40 years and served
as a major in the Dental Corps in West Africa during the Second World
War. A gregarious man, he was a past president of the Milngavie
Toastmasters' Club, the Allander Rotary Club, the Glasgow North Rotary
Club, and the Milngavie Probus Club.
As a keen golfer, he had been a member of Milngavie Golf Club for 39
years and was a former club captain. He was also a member of Buchanan
Golf Club for more than 20 years, enjoying a game there the day before
he died.
Bill Hamilton cared deeply for Milngavie, its village atmosphere, its
people, and importantly, its future. He is survived by his wife Esther,
son John, and daughter Morag and grandchildren Stuart and Katie.

HLI officer; born June 25, 1901, died September 9, 1995
THE Glasgow Boys' Brigade former president and Clyde shipping company
director Mr James Berend Shaw has died in Perth. He was 94.
A pupil at Kelvinside Academy until 1916, Mr Shaw left school on his
fifteenth birthday to become an office junior with John Bruce &amp; Company,
sea freighters, carriers of fruit from the Mediterranean to Scotland.
Mr Shaw remained with the company until his retirement in 1967. During
his career he ascended to the position of director, becoming a partner
with the sons of the founder.
An enthusiastic member of the Boys' Brigade and the Territorial Army,
Mr Shaw served with the 5th Highland Light Infantry during the Second
World War, attaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel.
After 1945, he returned to the Boys' Brigade, presiding over the
Glasgow battalion from 1947-50. A pioneer of the elementary military
training of Glasgow boys, he retained links with the organisation until
his death.
In 1983, he published a centennial history of the brigade and on his
retirement moved to Pitlochry.
An MBE and former director of John Smith and Sons, booksellers, Mr
Shaw is survived by daughter Anna and grandchildren Morven and Douglas.
His wife Carine died in 1973.

Mrs Isobel Mackenzie, SWRI leader and honorary sheriff; born July 26,
1913, died September 15, 1995
MRS Isobel Mackenzie, who was active in the Scottish Women's Rural
Institutes for more than 50 years and became the movement's national
chairman, has died at St John's Hospital, Livingston, after a long
illness. She was 82.
Mrs Mackenzie first developed an interest in the SWRI in 1944 and
became a founder member of the Westfield branch in West Lothian.
In 1957 she began a span of service that lasted 30 years, as national
treasurer from 1969 to 1975 and vice-chair from 1978 to 1981. She was
also national chairman from 1981 to 1987. In recognition of her services
an MBE was awarded in the 1988 Queen's Birthday Honours List.
A SWRI spokeswoman in Edinburgh said that Mrs Mackenzie's death was a
sad blow. Her capacity for work was phenomenal, and she had an
encyclopaedic knowledge of the SWRI few could match.
Mrs Mackenzie had a keen appreciation of the work of the institute,
her life dedicated to making this awareness felt throughout Scotland.
She expected staff at SWRI's Edinburgh headquarters to work hard, the
spokeswoman said, but would not ask anything of them she was not
prepared to do herself.
Mrs Mackenzie participated in the setting-up of the Women's National
Commission at a time when the SWRI held one of the only two permanent
Scottish seats, and was also a life member of the Associated Country
Women of the World.
Mrs Mackenzie was also a member of industrial tribunals for 10 years
and an Honorary Sheriff at Linlithgow Sheriff Court.
She was educated at Glasgow's Park School and the College of Domestic
Science teaching that subject in northern England during the 1930s. In
1938 she married Donald Mackenzie, an RAF officer.
For the next 29 years she accompanied her husband, travelling
worldwide in postings from the United Kingdom to the Far East.
In 1957, when Mr Mackenzie retired from the RAF, the couple took over
her family's butchery business in Glasgow and lived at Bathgate, West
Lothian.
Mrs Mackenzie is survived by her husband, three sons and one daughter.
There are seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren.

Jean Gol, Belgian opposition leader; died September 18, aged 53
BELGIAN opposition leader and former Deputy Prime Minister Jean Gol
has died in Leige at the age of 53.
Figuring in Belgian politics for more than two decades, he had been
comatose after suffering a brain haemorrhage on Saturday.
Jean Gol was leader of the conservative Liberal Reform Party, the main
opposition party in French-speaking southern Belgium and from 1981 and
1988 he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister.
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene led allies and opponents in paying
tribute to Jean Gol's ''statemanship and sense of duty''. He was born in
London in 1942 where his Jewish parents had fled after the Nazis invaded
Belgium. After studying law in the eastern city of Liege, he entered
politics in the 1970s as a strong defender of French-speaking southern
Belgium in negotiations with the Dutch-speaking north. He continued to
champion the francophone cause after entering a coalition government in
1981 led by Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat Wilfred Martens.
His hopes of returning to power were dashed in elections last May,
when his conservative manifesto failed to convince voters to throw out
Dehaene's coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists from both
language communities.
He leaves a wife and a teenage daughter.

ALBERT (''Bert'') Trayler, 90, one of Britain's best-known
stage-managers in the heyday of the Moss Empire's network, has died at
Inverkeithing, Fife.
He was stage manager at the Empire Theatre, Edinburgh, until its
closure as a variety house in 1962, and was previously stage director at
the Palace Theatre, Manchester.
Esteemed by generations of theatrical artists, including many
Hollywood personalities who played in Manchester and Edinburgh, he was a
dedicated stage director. Those associated with the variety scene at
Edinburgh from the 1940s to the 1960s recall the pride that Mr Trayler
took in his work.
The veteran musical clown Billy Crockett recalled Bert Trayler as ''an
extremely efficient stage director.''

Ros Davidson says many victims of sexual harassment are still keeping
quiet
ATTITUDES towards sexual harassment are changing -- but victims'
advocates say the pace is too slow. The resignation of Senator Bob
Packwood and a spate of other high-profile cases in the US are sending a
strong message that harassers run a large risk. Yet there is evidence
that many people, including Packwood, still do not ''see it''.
Packwood's tearful but forced quitting, after his 26 years on Capitol
Hill, may have been one of those watershed events, at least in the
tight-knit and male-dominated US Senate.
The case -- in which he allegedly misused his political power to make
unwanted advances towards numerous subordinate women -- was partially
the culmination of a push by female members of the US Congress and
women's advocacy groups still fueled by anger over the Clarence Thomas
hearings four years ago.
Even so, lawyers and others familiar with the workplace say that
unwelcome passes, groping, and sexually offensive comments are still
rampant and victims seldom confront such behaviour. Even the headline in
Time magazine's lead article on Packwood this week reveals a
minimisation of the problem: Betrayed by his kisses.
Although many political colleagues express pity for Packwood,
especially after his emotional farewell, the reaction of those who
accused him was one of relief and anger. ''I feel like I stand on the
shoulders of Anita Hill,'' said one of his accusers, Mary Hefferman,
afterwards from her home in the senator's Oregon constituency.
It was Anita Hill's unsuccessful accustions against Clarence Thomas,
nominated to the US Supreme Court, that rocketed the issue into public
awareness four years ago.
''There are many women that have come forward before and have not been
treated with the respect that we have,'' she said. Hefferman, one of the
18 women whose charges against Packwood painted him as a crude aggressor
and prompted the senate ethics committee to condemn him, was a volunteer
co-ordinator for his re-election campaign in 1980 when he unexpectedly
grabbed and kissed her in his office. She says Anita Hill's wrenching
testimony laid the groundwork for her allegations to be taken seriously.
Liz McKanna, a lawyer specialising in sex harassment cases who
represents two of the accusers, expects some men to think twice before
they act illegally. ''I think the message they have now is clear --
there will be punishment.''.
McKanna notes that sexual harassment is illegal under federal law in
any firm with 15 or more workers. Almost all states have statutes too --
Mississippi does not -- but some such as California have tougher
remedies while others, including Oregon, are weaker.
Sexual harassment was only recognised as a problem by the courts in
the late 1970s and it is only more recently that most cases have been
filed. Nearly all of America's large companies now require sensitivity
training, to address the issue as well as to prevent sizeable legal
costs.
Packwood's case is clearly also because of fundamental changes in the
make-up of Washington. Senator Barbara Boxer of California lobbied
intensely, albeit unsuccessfully, for public hearings in the 33-months
ethics probe. Elected to the senate in November after a campaign based
on anger over the confirmation of Thomas, she is now considered a
political heavyweight.
Fury also came from long-time senator Barbara Mikulski, and in
newspaper advertisements placed by the Women's Legal Advocacy Fund -- If
your boss stuck his tongue in your mouth, would he keep his job? -- and
dogged reporting by Washington Post reporter Florence Graves. Graves
broke the story in her newspaper by getting half of the women accusing
Packwood to go on the record.
Estimates are that about 60% to 85% of women experience harassment at
some point at work, but that only about 10% ever press a complaint. A
far smaller proportion of men are harassed, but those who do often find
it harder to speak out as they may be even less likely to be believed.
Packwood, 63, remains unrepentant. He now says his diary entries were
untrue, he could not remember what he did and he was a ''rejected
suitor''.
His attitude was bolstered by others after the case. ''I don't think
he should have resigned. What he did was 20 years ago when everything
was love and kisses,'' said Lee Comstock, 64, a barber in Portland,
Oregon. Shipping co-ordinator, Sherie Shoemaker, 32, also of Portland,
added: ''I think he should have stayed and fought. Most of this stuff
was 20 years ago when it was a different world.''
McKanna, the lawyer, was aghast at Time's ''kisses'' headline. ''It
has nothing to do with kissing! It has to do with physical, unwarranted
assault.''
It was his colleagues' desire for re-election, not a change in
attitude, that forced Packwood out, concludes Philip Kay, who
represented the San Francisco legal secretary Rene Weeks who was awarded
$7.1m, an amount later halved.
Kay says it is still professional suicide for a woman to complain
about harassment and that those who do complain stand to undermine their
entire careers.

BRITAIN has just done its nuclear research by remote control. The
information highway for Whitehall's future deterrent strategy stretches
12,000 miles across the Pacific and bears a French designer label.
The French warhead test at Mururoa, the first of eight scheduled
blasts, marks not only an unfortunate and unnecessary environmental
milestone, but signals the start of a new age of co-operation Europe at
top-secret level.
The aim of the exercise is domination by Paris and London of a new
Europe in which a reunited and resurgent Germany must be kept in check
under the shadow of the protective umbrella of Anglo-French ballistic
submarine missiles.
The deafening silence from the UK as the world weighed in with protest
and sanctions over France's high-handed action is easily explicable.
Until the United States declared an end to live testing earlier this
year, Britain had planned its own series of nuclear experiments in the
Nevada desert to fine-tune warhead design.
The intention was to amass enough data to allow miniaturisation of
Trident's missile payload in the best tradition of more bangs for the
taxpayers' buck in a changing world.
The UK invested more than #10billion in a flotilla of Trident
submarines for which the Navy is now trying to create a practical
defence role in the aftermath of the demise of the Soviet Union.
Four decades of intercontinental confrontation disappeared overnight.
Having an undetectable submarine on patrol with enough nuclear firepower
to devastate a continent became a sudden anachronism. The cobalt-blue
comfort blanket was pulled roughly away.
But The Royal Navy now needs to adapt to changing circumstances. The
ability to cripple Russia is no longer a viable option if the enemy is
some tin-pot power such as Libya or Argentina. Trident has to carry
warheads appropriate to the age of insecurity and the prospect of
brushfire wars.
Any threat is credible only if an enemy perceives that it might be
carried out. The prospect of turning an entire country into a
radioactive wasteland in response to a terrorist outrage does not enter
that category. Indiana Jones has the gun, but he won't use it.
Computer technology has, in any case, advanced beyond the point where
it is vital to make something go bang to test design theory. It is
entirely possible to extrapolate existing data to create new weapons.
Unlike political arrangements, the laws of physics tend to be immutable.
The apparent deal done between Paris and London harks towards a
long-term arrangement under which the entente cordiale will keep the
Germans in line and obviate the need for the dominance of the Americans.
It is the stuff of dreams for the Quai d'Orsai, the French foreign
ministry.
France is sharing the results of its Muroroa blasts with our own
Defence Ministry. France has also offered Germany the protection of a
future nuclear umbrella. France intends to be the dominant member of a
revitalised and independent Europe.
Just as there is no such thing as a free lunch, there are no free
diplomatic rides when it comes to power-sharing. The bill for the UK in
the last two weeks was silence in the short-term and long-term
compliance with French policy.
Paris knows that Britain's shrinking defence budget will not permit
replacement of Trident in the foreseeable future. The big-bang boats may
be the UK's last major military power-play over their 25 to 30-year
lifespan. At best, the huge expenditure on them has bought a seat at the
top table of world decision-making.
France already has five missile submarines and a substantial number of
aircraft dedicated to delivery of nuclear weapons. Despite cutbacks, its
defence spending remains geared to maintaining the thermo-nuclear edge.
The French agenda is based partly on national pride and partly on
practicality. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Russia is an
impoverished giant. The only potential threat to the applecart is
Germany. The assimiliation and economic recovery of its eastern portion
is proceeding apace. In a decade, two at the most, it will be yet again
an industrial, political and potentially military powerhouse.
Despite its national reputation for subtlety, France has always been
an atomic neanderthal. While Nato toyed with complicated theories of
graduated response in the event of a general war, moving in
choreographed steps from conventional defence through battlefield nukes
to all-out holocaust, Paris had a clear-cut and uncompromising approach.
The first Soviet boot to cross the French frontier would be the
trigger for release of all nuclear weapons. If France went down, a large
part of Russia would go with her. It was a policy which Moscow
respected. The Soviet hierarchy played no mind-games with hardware.
Weapons were there to be used to their full potential in the event of
war.
Strangely, given US awareness of French plans, Washington is
cooperating actively with both Britain and France on computer modelling
techniques for future warheads. The process involves sharing ''codes''
which allow simulation of of everything from warhead storage to
detonation.
The American aim is to make it easier to keep an eye on the nuclear
safety catch while at the same time placating the environmental lobby.
Weapon stockpiles have a definite shelf-life, and the computer modules
devised from earlier tests now make it possible to reassure the military
that a particular warhead will work to requirement at any given time.
A decade ago, the only sure way to soothe the nerves of jittery top
brass was to take a sample of a batch of warheads and try out its
potential for real. Generations of inadvertent fallout victims will
suffer the legacy of the blue touch-paper system into the twenty-first
century.

Education Correspondent Barclay McBain explains the rationale behind
threatened school closures
THE equation is simple. Falling school rolls plus crumbling buildings
plus budget crises equal a review of classroom provision. For review,
read school closures.
The formula is an easy one to absorb, which is just as well since it
will be staring the new unitary authorities in the face when they assume
responsibility for education next April, which accounts for about #2
billion, or half, of annual local government expenditure. And they will
have to learn pretty quickly how to put the theory into practice.
Under the 1994 Local Government Act, councils have a duty to achieve
value -- something which they are patently failing to do -- at least in
the way they manage school buildings, according to the Accounts
Commission for Scotland.
The local authorities' financial watchdog states in a major report
published today: ''The 29 new (mainland) councils will inherit a
situation which cannot be allowed to continue. Value for money in school
budgets, which will be under severe pressure, will only be achieved by
reducing the cost of surplus places.''
The independent statutory body supervises the examination of local
authority accounts and promotes sound management of public finances. As
Bob Black, the controller of audit, explained yesterday: ''Education is
the biggest service run by councils and we felt it was right to
undertake a study of the area, particularly against a backdrop of a
dramatic fall in school rolls which the new councils will have to
address.
''We hope this report will help them come to terms with one of the big
issues in planning the service.''
It certainly pulls no punches. Pupil rolls have fallen by more than
25% in the past 20 years and, based on birth rate projections, further
reductions are forecast.
The drop among children ranges from 4% in Grampian region to 23% in
Strathclyde. It therefore comes as no surprise to learn that Strathclyde
-- which provides education for half of Scotland's school pupils -- is
in a league of its own in terms of the proportion of secondaries which
are less than 60% full -- 76%. The next nearest authority is Lothian, at
7%.
The report does not look at surplus capacity in the island authorities
because they are committed to supporting small, costly schools which
serve isolated, rural communities. On the mainland, Strathclyde makes a
similar commitment and, to give a fairer picture of the number of
schools which could be closed, the commission took several factors into
account before coming up with its damning statistics.
Based on feedback from authorities, it concluded that an occupancy
rate of just over 80% was realistic for schools: ''Many viable schools
have surplus capacity. Indeed, no authority-wide system can be expected
to run at 100% in any circumstances. Some elbow-room is always needed.''
The commission concentrated on those whose occupancy rate is less than
60%. One-third of Scotland's 2000-plus primaries and one quarter of the
country's 400-plus secondaries come into that category. But, as the
report concedes: ''There must be feasible options for the physical
relocation of pupils.''
And it notes that in Strathclyde, in particular, the potential to
remove surplus places is limited by the requirement to maintain separate
non-denominational and Roman Catholic schools.
But, taking such factors as alternative local provision into account,
the commission has identified 106 primary and 13 secondary schools which
could readily be closed. It has chosen not to name them because it says
the matter is one for councils to tackle.
The report agrees that there are no clear educational arguments for
closing small primary schools, but points out that secondaries with less
than 500 pupils can offer only a restricted curriculum, and limited
opportunities to cater for pupils' different abilities in different
classes.
Given its overall occupancy rates, the vast majority of the 13
secondaries will be in urban areas of Strathclyde and, based on a school
rationalisation paper which the authority produced in 1992, it is
possible to identify schools which are likely to be on the commission's
list.
At the time the schools had occupancy rates ranging from 17% to 60%,
and many required hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of expenditure
to bring them up to standard. They included:
* John Bosco, St Gerard's, Garthamlock, and St Augustine's in Glasgow.
John Bosco can accommodate more than 1600 pupils but its roll is not
expected to exceed 500 before 1997.
* St Cuthbert's, St Mirin's, and St Brendan's in Renfrew Division.
* Ayr Academy and Mainholm Academy in Ayr Division.
Strathclyde has closed about 200 schools but rationalisation has not
been a priority recently because councillors have concluded that, with
the forthcoming demise of the authority, there would be no gain from the
pain of inevitable parental ire against, and opposition to, closure
programmes. They have also seen their plans thwarted by parents who have
exploited the opting out legislation to keep schools open.
But such considerations will not be allowed to cloud the judgment of
the unitary authorities. Leaving aside the issue of surplus capacity,
they face extremely tough financial times. There will be little, if any,
room for manoeuvre in their revenue budgets while capital budgets will
be much smaller than their share of the break up of the regions.
''It can make no economic sense to meet from limited resources the
maintenance requirements of grossly under-occupied school buildings,''
says the commission. Besides, the prize for attacking surplus places is
glittering, it says -- #25m worth of annual revenue savings based on the
running costs of average-sized secondary and primary schools; #20m from
the one-off avoidance of building maintenance spending; and
opportunities to raise money from the sale of land and buildings.
As Mr Black said: ''This is an issue which will not go away. The new
councils really must face up to this important and sensitive issue. We
would hope that everyone who has the interests of the education of
Scottish children at heart will recognise and support councils in
developing better provision. Value for money is not about cutting costs.
It is about the best use of resources.''

CURRENT intelligence on the groups which might be said to constitute
the ''darker side of nationalism'' is that, while most are dormant, some
are quietly beavering away, gathering resources against a day when overt
terrorism may once again be -- in their eyes -- a necessity.
A ballot box victory for the SNP at a General Election, say the
winning of a clear majority of Scottish seats, followed by the kind of
delay and obfuscation which is at present taking place in the
British-Irish peace talks might be such a scenario.
Although more recent heads of the British state have signalled that if
the Scots voted for independence no impediment could be placed in their
way, one former Prime Minister also said that a clear majority SNP vote
at a General Election would merely lead to a very difficult
constitutional position, but nothing more.
It is that idea, that Westminster would do everything within its
powers to delay, deny and ultimately frustrate any attempt of a Scottish
pro-independence majority to move the country towards statehood and the
inevitable change of the Union, or total severance from it, which
exercises the extremist fringe the most.
That is what it would take very probably to bring a return of the kind
of activities, including politically-motivated bank raids, bombings of
oil installations and electricity pylons and the dafter types of gesture
extremism which were regular punctuation marks in the seventies and
eighties and which invariably ended in elaborate High Court trials
accompanied by swingeing prison sentences.
It would be foolish to believe that the types of people and groups who
have inhabited the wilder shores of fringe nationalism have simply faded
away through time. It would be very probably correct to surmise that
wherever they currently exist they are already infiltrated by Special
Branch informants, much as the Scottish offshoots of the Northern Irish
terror groups, from the Provos on the Republican side to the UVF and UDA
on the misnamed Loyalist side of the fence, traditionally have been.
It is through such infiltration, and, if your paranoia is sufficiently
healthy to embrace such concepts, through the deliberate planting of
agents provocateurs and the dubious use of entrapment, that the streets
of Scotland have been maintained in a clean condition, largely free of
terrorism for the past three decades.
Practically every group has had its informants and these were well
documented in the standard work by Andrew Scott and Iain Sutherland
Macleay, Britain's Secret War. They averred that the first, and probably
most active, of these Government agents was Major Fredrick Boothby, a
key figure first in the Army of the Provisional Government in the late
1960s but also in a broader sense in relation to the non-existent
Scottish Liberation Army. The claim made was that the activities of the
daft Major Boothby resulted in 11 people being jailed, some for very
long periods.
Scott and Macleay alleged that what really damned Boothby was his
emergence just at the precise moment when the SNP were racing towards
ultimate success. With hindsight, given the subsequent decline of the
SNP's political fortunes, that might seem to be a plausible theory; the
British state created violent nationalist terrorism with the deliberate
aim of discrediting the entirely legitimate aspirations of a democratic
political movement.
Boothby took part in at least two episodes, both involving abortive
bank raids allegedly aimed at securing funds for revolutionary activity,
before he was himself swept up. In practically every subsequent group,
infiltrators or informants were used to secure and give evidence against
participants. There have been persistent allegations that agents were
used to actually create tartan terrorism.
It stretched the credibility of practically all who attended the
Scottish National Liberation Army trial at the High Court in Glasgow of
Thomas Kelly when the key Crown witness, Goodwin, said he had gone to
the police because he had been shocked and dismayed by what he had heard
being plotted.
Goodwin was sacrificed as an informant to convict Kelly, a rather fey
amateur, while the real SNLA -- all three of them -- remained at large.
The leader still is and is seldom out of the headlines for long.
The dramatically-wild appearance of Siol Nan Gaidheal and Arm Nan
Gaidheal members were a constant source of embarrassment to the
mainstream of the SNP and did much to turn off ordinary, sensible
voters. They were undoubtedly heavily infiltrated and a number of them
went to trial for terrorist offences.
There were also key informants involved in the trials of the Tartan
Army, the Scottish Citizens' Army of the Republic -- allegedly now
reformed -- and in the dramatic High Court trial in Glasgow of
schoolteacher Donald Anderson, who was acquitted, and teenager Creag
Browning, who eventually admitted possessing explosive. It was, and
still is alleged that the Bridgeton scrap merchant, Andrew Wilson, and
his employee were set up by the Special Branch with gelignite belonging
to UVF men, then under close surveillance, to entrap Anderson and
Browning.
There have been numerous other fringe groups varying in the degree of
danger they have presented to ordinary Scottish citizens and to the
integrity of the state. Between 1968 and 1990 there had been around 52
Scottish terrorists jailed. The pace has diminished since then, although
the Scottish National Liberation Army is kept alive by the presence of
Adam Busby in Dublin. He was allegedly behind the last hoax bomb episode
in Aberdeen and it emerged from that trial that the new groupings,
including the absurdly-named Flame, have a North-east orientation.
If the pattern remains true to the past, then it looks certain that
the current crop, including such militant anti-English bodies as Settler
Watch and Scottish Watch -- proscribed by the SNP -- are even now being
targeted by the police or the intelligence service despite public
protestations of strict non-violence.
The cynics of the nationalist fringe believe that the time is ripe,
with the current buoyant fortunes of the SNP and their current
respectability in the eyes of the Scottish electorate, for another major
political trial. The other, correct, reading of the situation is that
controlling the loonies leaves Scotland free for the legitimate,
democratic aspirations of those who believe in nationalism to develop
their aims in a safe society.

Rob Robertson talks to Alan Dickson who is supervising the treatment
of Manchester's Siamese twins
SCOTS SURGEON Alan Dickson, leader of the team which delivered Siamese
twins Chloe and Nicole Astbury, has seen life at the sharp end working
in a South African children's hospital during the height of apartheid.
During a year working as a senior registrar at the Cape Town
Children's Hospital in the late 1980s the 42-year-old surgeon dealt with
heartbreaking scenes of young victims of racist violence.
Burns victims, children who had been beaten up, and boys who had been
stabbed were all treated by the 42-year-old Edinburgh-born surgeon.
Now the strong anti-apartheid supporter has been thrust into the
spotlight in countries round the world, including South Africa, not for
his caring work there, but for his role as the surgeon in charge of the
birth of the Siamese twins.
Life for him at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester was going along
steadily until he met the twins' parents Melanie, aged 25, and Brian,
26, of Denton, Manchester nearly five months ago.
Now he finds himself politely dealing with inquiries from all over the
world about their birth.
Since Friday the Edinburgh University trained surgeon who was brought
up in Port Seton, East Lothian, has been working 20 hour days looking
after the young girls.
Slightly bewildered and bemused by all the attention, the soft-spoken
father-of-three sees no let-up in his workload even after his work with
the Siamese twins comes to an end.
''I will be going back to my regular duties with clinics, ward rounds,
operations and emergency work,'' says Mr Dickson. ''I never, ever
imagined being in this situation. You just get on with your daily life.
So far the public spotlight has not bothered us because we have been so
time-consumed with the children.
''The birth and care was obviously a big challenge but we used a lot
of basic principles regarding births. The girls are in a satisfactory
condition considering the severity of the problem and length of
surgery.''
He adds: ''However I am still cautious over the conditions of the
girls. It is still early days and they have undergone massive surgery.
We must get them over the surgical trauma and that will take up to 10
days.
''The second worry is that these children have lost a lot of their
bowel and we must wait and see how their bowel will recover.''
Mr Dickson said parents Melanie and Brian were ''very nice and very
supportive''. He said he had been in regular contact with them for
nearly five months, offering information and advice.
Although based in Manchester Alan said he missed Scotland badly
although he was settled with his children in England.
''I miss watching Hearts play football and always watch for the
Watsonian rugby scores,'' he says. ''I also have debentures at
Murrayfield and I am an examiner for the Royal College of Surgeons so I
get back now and then.''
He first moved to England seven years ago. Before that he worked in
Edinburgh Sick Children's Hospital, Yorkhill in Glasgow and Monklands
Hospital. Colleagues north of the Border speak highly of his abilities
and describe him as a skilled technical operator.
Gordon MacKinlay, director of surgery, anaesthetics and intensive care
at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, says: ''Alan is an
exceptionally skilled surgeon and a really nice guy. He was our senior
registrar here for several years before his appointment in Manchester so
he is very well-trained.
''I would be very happy for him to operate on my own children. The
Siamese twins are in good hands.''

A dreary original cast, a poor script and a well-known ending. So how,
asks William Russell, did they manage to achieve liftoff? With a hefty
Hollywood line-up to inject glamour and sparkle
Apollo 13 (PG) directed by Ron Howard.
The Quick and the Dead (15) directed by Sam Raimi.
On general release.
Carrington (15) directed by Christopher Hampton.
GFT and the Cameo, Tollcoss.
La Separation (PG) directed by Christian Vincent.
GFT.
Chungking Express (15) directed by Wong Ka-Wai.
Filmhouse.
All films open tomorrow.
RON Howard's enviable achievement with Apollo 13 is to have made a
very exciting film with a nail-biting climax about a disaster the
audience knows comes out all right in the end. It is a considerable feat
because the characters involved are at best ciphers, at worst pub bores.
Maybe astronauts have to be men with no imagination because what they do
is so insanely hazardous that the kind of person who would stop and
think about what was involved would stick to bus travel.
Apollo 13 was the moon landing mission aborted in April 1970 after an
explosion in the oxygen tanks, the result of a routine operational task.
The problem facing Mission Control was how to get the three astronauts
back to earth in a ship, which had lost much of its power, where every
ampere was vital.
Given such essentially uninteresting heroes and a script which,
although it milks the drama of their plight to the full, does not
examine how the experience affected themsomething had to be done.
Howard's solution was to cast Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton as
James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise respectively, forcing the
actors, since there is nothing to work with in the script, to fall back
on their established screen personalities.
It works brilliantly, because the audience knows at a glance what each
man stands for -- Hank is good old Gump again, all American hero; Bacon
is the lecher who might panic in a crisis but has steel; and Paxton is
the solid, reliable ugly bloke, the hero's best friend who comes
through.
The rescue was undeniably a brilliant effort on the part of both
mission control at NASA and Lovell, who had to pilot the lunar module
Aquarius (having abandoned Odyssey, the command module rendered useless
by the explosion) back into the earth's atmosphere manually.
The film handles the dramatic possibilities to the full. Something,
however, is missing. The appearance of Ed Harris, as Gene Kranz, the
mission controller, provides the answer -- Harris played an astronaut in
The Right Stuff, a film which looked at what it is that makes some men
want to fly fast and high, and also managed to convey something of the
splendour of space. It had depth, this is shallow adventure comic strip.
Screen acting of the highest quality is provided in La Separation
directed by Christian Vincent in which Isabelle Huppert and Daniel
Auteuil demonstrate how to convey the most deadly emotions with a
glance, the flick of an eyebrow, the cast of an eye. The film deals with
the breakdown of their marriage after Huppert tells Auteuil she is
having an affair. We never find out any details of the affair, but
Huppert's treatment of him drives Auteuil ever further into despair.
Painful to watch, it is also completely engrossing and perceptive about
how the relationship, apparently sound, founders causing havoc all
round.
Vincent and the two stars manipulate the audience's sympathies with
great skill. Huppert seems initiallly to be a vintage virago, callous
and selfish, Auteuil the wronged partner, but by the end both have our
sympathies as we leave them amid the ruins.
With the handsome and beautifully acted Carrington, Christopher
Hampton, who wrote the screenplay, proves that as a first-time director
he is a very good screen writer. There is nothing seriously wrong with
the film, but Hampton clearly has nothing to say in cinematic terms
about the legendary Bloomsbury set, opting instead to photograph in a
straightforward fashion his high calibre script which would have worked
as well on the stage.
The plot deals with the unconsummated affair between the homosexual
writer Lytton Strachey (Jonathan Pryce) and the painter Dora Carrington
(Emma Thompson) which ended after his death in her suicide.
Pryce gives a memorable performance, creating a funny, waspish,
compassionate man both appalled and transfixed by this awful woman who
persists in pursuing him. He gets the best lines and has the most fully
realised role.
Indeed, the film could have been called Strachey, because Thompson,
although good as Dora, is given less material to build her character on
and willy-nilly misses the blinkered and obsessive nature of the woman.
We never know who Dora is, where she came from, why she behaves like a
boy, falls so blindly for a confirmed homosexual, yet has repeated
heterosexual affairs, and some three-in-a-bed exploits which included
Strachey.
Hampton's script, although literate and intelligent, makes the
Bloomsbury set seem oddly tame and conventionally Bohemian. They were
surely nastier, bitchier and, in the case of Carrington at least, far
more self destructive in real life than this worthy, but ultimately
bland, film implies.
Sharon Stone plays the Maid with No Moniker in The Quick and the Dead,
a homage to Sergio Leone directed by Sam Raimi. It is very handsome to
look at and Stone, as a gun slinger seeking revenge who rides into the
town of Redemption, looks terrific in a series of designer leather pants
and some fabulous hair extensions. But Clint she aint.
It is hard to say where Raimi goes wrong because all the Leone tricks
are there -- the zoom shots, the meaningless close ups -- but the plot
about an annual fast draw contest in which the particpants shoot to kill
is unusually ropey. On the other hand, so were the plots of most of
Leone's films. Maybe it is that Stone proves a weak woman who shudders
when she has to do what a gal has to do, relies on a man for help, and
gets drunk when scared. Clint would never have done that.
Gene Hackman, as the evil big boss, the man she has Come To Get, gives
a dazzling display of seductive evil, and is the best thing in the film.
Chungking Express, directed by Wong Ka Wai, much admired by Quentin
Tarantino allegedly, so be warned, consists of two short stories about
Hong Kong policemen who have unhappy love lives. Stylish, with some good
jokes, it ultimately proves terribly inconsequential.

OKAY, be honest. How many of you out there have read Jane Austen's
Pride and Prejudice? I'll wager a guess and say that, for a novel which
is reputed to be the most widely-read in the English language, not
nearly as many as you might think.
It certainly passed this writer by. It was suggested at school, of
course, but (for us lads, at least) it was regarded as a bit too sissy;
a girl's book, if you like. It is a truth universally acknowledged that
a schoolboy in the sixties would prefer the New Musical Express or a
Commando comic any day to an old-fashioned and rather wordy comedy of
manners. I, like my social peers, was a teenage intellectual philistine.
Now another question. How many of you out there will tune in to BBC1
on Sunday night to watch the first part of Andrew Davies's sumptuous
adaptation of Pride and Prejudice? I'll wager a guess and say millions.
It's times like these when you underestimate at your peril the BBC's
ability, not only to entertain, but also to educate its audience. There
must come a time, of course, when our public broadcasting service runs
out of classic English literature to benignly plunder. Maybe a hundred
years from now.
But, until that sad moment arrives, we can sit back and enjoy what the
Beeb does better than anyone else in all the world -- adapting famous
books for television and making them come to life in a period drama
series. Middlemarch, Martin Chuzzlewit, and now Pride and Prejudice. And
that in the space of just over a year. The beauty is that these
programmes, far from being over-earnest and a chore to watch, are
nothing short of delightful, charming, witty, and thoughtful.
In fact, we can go further and say that, with Davies's immensely
talented hands at the tiller, it is no longer a sacrilege to suggest
that you don't actually have to read the book. You can safely see the
television serial instead. He remains faithful, not only to the spirit
and to the story, but also to the dialogue. With six 45-minute episodes
at his disposal, he has afforded himself the luxury of remaining true to
Austen's novel. He adds little and subtracts even less to the drama or
to the characters.
It is a public service, perhaps even a duty, to bring a classic work
like Pride and Prejudice to a mass audience through the medium of
television. It has been done before (most notably as a movie in 1940
starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier and as a studio-based
television play, adapted by Fay Weldon for BBC2, in 1980) but never with
such panache and style.
Set in nineteenth century rural Hertfordshire, the story centres
around the dreadful and vulgar Mrs Bennet's attempts to find eligible
(and rich) husbands for her five young daughters. Leading a
distinguished cast are Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as
Elizabeth Bennet. However, the most memorable performance is delivered
by the wonderful Alison Steadman as the terrifying potential
mother-in-law-from-hell, Mrs Bennet.
Producer Sue Birtwistle first pitched the idea for the serial to ITV
who, after commissioning the first three scripts, decided that it was
probably too soon after the BBC's most recent version of the story to do
it again. Birtwistle, desperate to make this labour of love, then took
the project to the BBC in the faint hope that they would give it the
go-ahead. Much to her surprise, they did.
She said: ''To me it is simply the sexiest book ever written. By that
I mean that Darcy staring at Elizabeth across a room is exciting and the
two of them touching hands the first time they dance is erotic. I don't
mean naked bedroom scenes.
''The last time it was done for television it was a studio-based
production and I found it rather stilted. We've opened it up and taken
it out on location. Andrew (Davies) has been extremely faithful to the
book. I wanted it to be popular mainstream drama. It is touching and
romantic but also very funny.''
Andrew Davies explained: ''The first half of the novel was very easy
to adapt for the screen. It was the second half which presented the most
difficult bits because you realise that there is an awful lot of
letter-writing going on.
''In part one the action is very much within a certain area and the
characters are pretty close-knit. In part two they're rather fragmented
and scattered. Inevitably, therefore, I had to make up scenes that Jane
Austen didn't create. But the great thing about the book is that you can
show that we're dealing here with living, breathing human beings, rather
than stuffed shirts.''
* Pride and Predjudice starts on BBC1 on Sunday evening.

Judy Mackie checks out Aberdeen's newest club and finds a
one-stop-shop for holistic healthcare including therapies and beauty
treatments
WITH such an up-market address as 1 Queen's Terrace, Aberdeen, the
Total Health centre could be mistaken for an exclusive -- and expensive
-- health club. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The
elegant four-storey Victorian building, which sits so grandly among the
West End offices of solicitors and insurance brokers, will soon be open
to everyone, regardless of financial status.
The latest concept in complementary health and the first of its kind
in the UK, the centre opened its doors to the public yesterday offering
a range of therapies, natural beauty treatments, and health awareness
training packages for individuals and companies. Phase two, due to be
launched in early November, will enhance the holistic atmosphere with a
fitness studio and wholefood restaurant.
As a non-profit-making organisation, run by registered charity Total
Health UK, the centre has developed into a one-stop-shop to
complementary healthcare, providing a range of services, from advice and
information on practitioners throughout Grampian, to access to the
latest stress-busting therapies.
It is the brainchild of director Lynne Boyd and chairman David Wildigg
and the spacious and beautifully-renovated building is a far cry from
the tiny Total Health shop they opened two years ago in Aberdeen's city
centre, to initially provide objective information about complementary
therapies.
Yet, as Boyd explains, the underlying philosophy remains unchanged:
''We are here to help educate people in health self-awareness and to
encourage them to make the most of themselves, in body, mind and spirit.
Learning to relax, to listen to your body, and to feel beautiful inside
and out, are all key elements of personal development.''
The centre will be a focal point for a wide variety of practitioners,
including hypnotherapists, reflexologists, aromatherapists,
acupuncturists, spiritual healers and those practising shiatsu,
homeopathy, osteopathy and physiotherapy.
Also in situ will be a dentist and doctor, both of whom use
acupuncture and hypnotherapy in their work. Treatment costs will depend
on the patient's budget and range from exemption (applying to people
with medical conditions, whose doctor has verified their low financial
status), or a discretionary donation in the case of the spiritual
healers, to around #25-#30 per hour.
In the natural beauty salon, visitors will be able to sample a range
of treats, from herbal skincare therapies to the North-east's first
flotarium -- a womb-like therapy which involves relaxing in a tank of
warm water. Male visitors need not feel left out, as there will also be
a special men's room dedicated to such delights as hot steam shaves.
According to Boyd, natural beauty treatments work in tandem with
complementary health therapies: ''If a person looks good, the
psychosomatic results can kick-start the body's own healing processes
and make them feel good too.''
Only too aware of the ''hippy'' label attached to complementary
health, Boyd believes the centre's innovative series of corporate
training and consultancy packages will help dispel a few myths.
''We have already attracted a lot of interest from local businesses
looking for stress management, assertiveness and self-awareness courses
for their employees, so we're not exactly the open-toed sandals
brigade,'' she laughs.
Corporate courses will involve not only training sessions at the
centre, but also a comprehensive aftercare service. This means, for
example, that if a company sends employees on a stress management course
(involving relaxation therapies as well as the teaching of psychological
coping mechanisms), for two months following the course participants
will be asked to fill in a weekly questionnaire reminding them of what
they have learned and they will then be asked back to the centre to
report on their progress.
Depending on the outcome, the trainer/consultant may visit the
employer to give constructive feedback so that any workplace problems
identified as being a source of stress can be addressed.
Such courses will also be available to individuals and other
organisations, as well as day and evening classes in activities such as
yoga and Tai-Chi.
When the fitness studio opens in November, the emphasis will be on
toning up, rather than working out, targeting those whom Boyd describes
as ''people who would run a mile rather than take part in an aerobics
class''.
The basement wholefood restaurant, to be named Mckenzie's after the
building's architect, John McKenzie, will fill a niche in the North-eat
gourmet market as one of only a tiny number of eating places exclusively
providing health food in a smoke-free environment.
For those wishing to make regular use of the Total Health Centre's
facilities, a club package will be available. However, the one-off
visitor will be made equally as welcome and there will even be a quiet
room for people to relax in, available on a drop-in basis, which Boyd
predicts will be popular with nearby office employees.

* ARE you married to a ''husband in a hurry'' or a ''roll-on-roll-off
Romeo''? If so Dr David Delvin, our new weekly medical columist, has
some advice for you. His new book, The Big Orgasm, (New English library,
paperback #6.99), written in conjunction with his wife Christine Webber,
is highly readable though they do reduce sex to the level of gymnastics.
Fine, if that's what you want but most women would put quality of
relationships and even love on the list.
Still, for those who want to pep up a relationship, or put a bit of
zest back into the bedroom, it's a fun book. We do wonder where they did
their research though; take the woman who managed 30 orgasms in one
session or the high-flying woman business executive who took the
afternoon off in a hotel with her lover and had five orgasms. Dr Delvin
is blunt. The best tip he can give some men is to have a good wash.
Women don't like climbing into bed with a man who rarely sees soap and
water. Likewise men who are unfit, overweight, heavy drinkers or heavy
smokers are unlikely to rate high in the sexual stakes. As for women,
you could do worse than buy a vibrator, says Dr Delvin. Not a book for
the prudish or inhibited.
* CARING for an elderly relative or partner suffering from senile
dementia is one of the most demanding jobs a carer can have. Yet there
are more than 40,000 people with moderate to severe dementia in Scotland
who live at home or with a relative. Today is World Alzheimer Day and
Alzheimer Scotland, the voluntary organisation campaigning for action on
dementia, will be putting their views across to Lord James Douglas
Hamilton, Minister for Health and Home Affairs about the lack of
community care, closure of long-stay hospitals, and lack of support in
rural areas.
For further information, advice and support contact Alzheimer
Scotland, 8 Hill St, Edinburgh, EH2 3JZ; (0131) 225 1453.
* CARBON monoxide poisoning is a real threat in homes using poorly
installed appliances. Every year around 200 people are found dead,
particularly vulnerable are children, pregnant women, the elderly, and
pets. The symptoms include tiredness, headaches, nausea and dizzy
spells. Often these are put down to flu.
Now a new device, SleepSafe, promises to alert you to the presence of
carbon-monoxide gas. This simple-to-use device has a sensitised spot
which will darken as the level of carbon-monoxide poisoning rises. It
should be placed above the appliance and will last for six months. Price
#4.99 available direct from Play-it-Safe Ltd, 31 New Walk Terrace, York,
YO1 4BG; (01904) 672999.
* INVESTING in a good family health book may be expensive but worth
it. After all, what's the point in a cut-price reference book if it only
gives you a fraction of the story?
The Royal Society of Medicine Encylopaedia of Family Health not only
includes a directory of drugs and their actions, but a guide to
diagnostic investigations, and an extensive A-Z of diseases, symptoms
and medical terms. A must for all hypochondriacs. Published by
Bloomsbury, price #25.
* SEPTEMBER is Child Sexual Abuse Awareness Month and a debate
focusing on the television and screen portrayal of child incest will
take place next Wednesday in the Glasgow Film Theatre. It's organised in
conjunction with the Women's Support Project and will be led by Lesley
Henderson of Glasgow University Media Group and starts at 6.15p.m. It is
hoped that both those working with incest and child abuse victims along
with survivors will take part in the debate. Some free tickets are
available -- otherwise a charge of #3 will be made (#2 concession).
Phone: 0141-332 8128.
* FINDING information if you have a brain-injured member of the family
is often extremely difficult. Now the charity Brainwave has set up an
information helpline on (0891) 664558. Calls cost 39p per minute cheap
rate with the charity earning 30% of the revenue.

Introducing a new fortnightly series for men in which the widely
respected Dr DAVID DELVIN provides down-to-earth advice
* Q. I have always had a good ''fry-up'' at breakfast, but my wife now
keeps on at me to start the morn with muesli instead! She says that if I
don't I'll have a heart attack some day.
Now I have always understood that it's eggs which contain a lot of
cholesterol. So could I have my fried breakfast without any eggs, and
still be safe?
A. I'm afraid not. You're right in saying that eggs contain
cholesterol -- and cholesterol is a major cause of heart attacks.
But the fact is that most of the cholesterol in your body doesn't come
from eggs. It's actually manufactured by your liver -- out of the kind
of fats which you eat when you have a nice, big fried breakfast.
So really, you're better off without fried bread, fried bacon, black
pudding, sausages, and so on. Even fried tomatoes will help push your
cholesterol level up.
However, no-one needs to go berserk and adopt a ''muesli only'' policy
at breafast-time. It's easy to start the day with a healthy and
enjoyable breakfast of any high-fibre cereal, with or without a couple
of slices of wholemeal bread or wholemeal toast, and some low-fat
spread, like Gold Lowest.
Any kind of fruit is good too, while porridge is, of course, first
class.
My personal theory is that the sad decline in porridge-eating in
Scotland -- and its replacement by unhealthy ''fry-ups'' -- has been at
least partly responsible for the extraordinary increase in Scottish
coronaries during the twentieth-century.
Q. When I smoke first thing in the morning, I find it makes me want to
go to the toilet. Is this normal.
A. Yes, sir. The drug nicotine often has a mild anti-constipation
effect. This is one of its very few harmless actions -- and, believe me,
it's got some appalling ones!
In fact, if it had been invented last week -- instead of about 400
years ago -- people would regard it as more dangerous than Temazepam.
Q. I have read a lot of stuff in the papers about how men should
examine their testicles regularly, because cancer rates are high. Okay,
doctor -- but what are we looking for?
A. Lumps, sir. Mind you, if you find anything at all that seems a wee
bit odd, then go along to your doctor and get your undercarriage checked
out!
But a lump is the likeliest sign of testicular cancer. So all men --
particularly young men -- should be on the lookout for any kind of bump
or swelling. My recommendation to the average guy is to examine his
equipment once a month, with warm hands. Chilly hands make
self-examination difficult, and are decidedly uncomfortable.
Q. I'm an executive (male), age 36, and I've just had a bit of a
shock. My father has suddenly died of bowel cancer, at only 57. Is there
any risk that I could get it too?
A. All Scots are at risk of bowel cancer, because our incidence of
this disease is among the highest in the world -- a fact that many
people don't realise.
There is sometimes a familial tendency, but if you've only had one
close relative who's had the condition, that's not exceptional. My
advice to you is the same I'd give to anybody, male or female, who's
over the age of about 35. Watch out for these warning signs which could
indicate early bowel cancer:
* Bleeding with the bowel motions;
* Black, ''tarry coloured'' motions;
* Unexplained change of ''bowel habit'' (like becoming constipated for
no obvious reason);
* Persistent pain in the abdomen;
* Unexplained exhaustion.
Any reader -- male or female -- who experiences any of the above
should go straight to a GP's surgery. Simple tests will rapidly help to
establish whether a bowel cancer is present or not.
The tests will include having a small amount of bowel motion checked
in the lab for blood, and probably also endoscopy -- which means having
a look up the bowel with a telescopic-like device.
Remember: speed in getting diagnosed and treated is absolutely vital.
Q. I'm in my thirties, and I've recently taken up jogging with a view
to getting fit. So I am currently pounding out about 30 miles a week
round the streets of Stirling. Some of my friends laugh at me for doing
this much, but I say it's doing me good. Am I right?
A. There's no doubt that regular exercise is good for the heart. But
30 miles a week is far too much.
Most cardiologists believe that three periods of about 20 minutes
exercise per week is sufficient to do your ticker good and reduce the
risk of heart disease. What very few joggers realise is that doing large
mileages -- particularly on streets and pavements -- is very bad for the
joints of the legs, and will often lead to arthritis in middle and later
life.
The running craze started about 20 years ago, and doctors are now
beginning to see a generation of chaps whose knees (or hips, or ankles,
or feet) are shot to pieces because of all those years of pounding along
hard roads.
Unfortunately, I am one of them! So I deeply regret that I didn't
curtail my running to about 10 miles a week -- a distance which is not
likely to do much harm to a fellow's leg joints.
My three-point advice to all joggers is this:
* Avoid running on streets; grass is far safer for the joints;
* Always wear running shoes with lots of cushioning;
* Don't go in for ridiculously long distances.
* IF you've got a query about your health, write to Dr David Delvin at
The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. Dr D cannot reply in
person, but will try to respond in this column. Your name will not be
published.

THE Prime Minister has made a visit to hospital for treatment for a
trapped nerve in his back, Downing Street disclosed yesterday.
Mr Major went to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London's
Fulham Road for physiotherapy treatment as an NHS patient on the advice
of his family doctor.
Downing Street insisted the visit did not interrupt Mr Major's work
programme.
''It was not serious. He is in very good form. It hasn't interfered
with his schedule at all,'' said an aide.However, Mr Major, 52, may have
to go back for further physiotherapy sessions.
The Prime Minister's health has given him little cause for concern
over his five years in Downing Street.
At the time of Margaret Thatcher's downfall he underwent an operation
on his wisdom teeth, and in his younger days he sustained a knee injury
in a car accident in Africa which reportedly still gives him twinges.

Major claims door to peace open as air strikes against submissive
Serbs are called off.
Sarajevo, Wednesday
THE United Nations said today that the Bosnian Serbs had met its
demands to withdraw heavy weapons around Sarajevo, averting renewed Nato
air strikes and opening the prospect of a ceasefire.
UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon said Serb forces had
withdrawn about 250 big guns before the 9pm deadline for them to go or
risk a new wave of attacks.
The airport was open, as were key aid routes.
''We are content that compliance had been achieved,'' Vernon told
reporters.
In Sarajevo General Bernard Janvier, the UN commander in former
Yugoslavia; Admiral Leighton Smith, the commander of Nato's southern
command; and Major-General Rupert Smith, the UN commander in Bosnia,
gathered to evaluate Serb compliance.
A joint UN-Nato announcement later said that as the Bosnian Serbs had
complied with the conditions, generals on both sides ''agreed that the
resumption of air strikes is currently not necessary''.
However they added that any subsequent attack on Sarajevo or any other
safe area ''would be subject to investigation and resumption of air
strikes''.
Nato had warned strikes were likely if the guns were not moved by
tonight's deadline. The Alliance had given the Bosnian Serbs a six-day
respite from air strikes to encourage them to comply with the UN
demands.
The Bosnian Serbs said it was now up to the United Nations to broker a
ceasefire around Sarajevo and then in the rest of Bosnia, where Serb
forces face an onslaught from a Croatian-Bosnian offensive.
''The Serb side has completely fulfilled all points of the
agreement,'' Republika Srpska Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik told reporters.
''The goal is to eliminate any cause for bombing and for stopping the
peace process. We think that a solution cannot be reached by bombing and
war . . . ''
At the same time, the Serbs faced an onslaught from Bosnian
Government, Croatian regular, and Bosnian Croat forces in central
Bosnia. The 10-day offensive has redrawn the map of Bosnia, cutting the
Serb share to 50% from 70% -- close to the 49-51 division agreed as a
basis for peace talks.
UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko said Croatian regulars appeared to be
pulling back some units while joint Croat-Muslim forces had paused after
their 10-day lightning campaign to recovery a swathe of western Bosnia
from Serb hands.
Croatia and Bosnia, responding to US and French demands not to ruin
the nascent peace process with a military adventure, apparently slowed
the pace of the drive towards the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka, but
ruled out a formal ceasefire.
In separate incidents today underlining the fragility of peace
efforts, Serb forces fired two missiles at a Nato plane near Sarajevo,
and Bosnian army troops fired four mortar bombs in the city, drawing
strong UN condemnation.
However, in a confident mood after the success of its advance across
western Bosnia, the Bosnian Government wrote to the UN Security Council
effectively demanding the surrender of Serb forces in Banja Luka as its
price for stopping the onslaught.
Banja Luka authorities described the suggestion as ridiculous and
rejected any possibility of such negotiations.
UN sources doubted whether the offensive would continue with the same
force as the Serb defences appeared to be shoring up.
However Bosnia is now divided more or less in the proportions on which
all parties have agreed to talk peace. Serbia, which now negotiates on
behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, has shown no sign of reacting to the
Muslim-Croat offensive, saying it remained committed to the peace
process.
US peace envoy Richard Holbrooke has regularly denied that the Nato
air campaign which has battered Serb air defences, communications, and
arms dumps, was directly linked to his peace programme. However it and
the Muslim-Croat offensive appear to have changed the Bosnian Serb
resolve to fight on.--Reuter.

Grozny, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's envoy in Chechnya escaped injury when a bomb
exploded as his car crossed a bridge near Grozny today.
The Russian military said separatists had tried to assassinate envoy
Oleg Lobov, 57, and derail peace efforts.
The separatists denied blame, but other developments increased fears
of a flare-up in the nine-month conflict.
0 The separatists have backed out of a July 30 ceasefire agreement to
surrender heavy weaponry, but have moved artillery back from front line
positions.
Asked if he thought Russia was planning to resume combat actions,
Chechen military chief Aslan Maskhadov told reporters: ''I would not be
surprised if the Russian side dropped a nuclear bomb on Chechnya.''
Lobov was one of the most vocal supporters of the decision last
December to send troops into Chechnya.-- Reuter.

THE Scots doctor found guilty of the unlawful killing of two child
black patients in Zimbabwe has found himself at the centre of another
racially-charged row after his dismissal as an announcer from one of
Africa's biggest sports championships.
Yesterday it emerged that Richard McGown, who is on bail awaiting the
result of an appeal against a six-month sentence, was sacked from the
All Africa Games in Harere on Monday. His dismissal came after a dispute
with a swimming official over the pronounciation of a Madagascan female
swimmer competitor's name.
During a sensational trial earlier this year, the Scottish-educated
doctor was accused by a parliamentary committee of conducting Nazi-like
experiments on his black patients.
He was given a six-month prison sentence after being found guilty of
professional negligence resulting in the death of a nine-year-old girl
and a toddler. He was cleared of three other charges of causing death by
negligence.
Commenting on the latest controversy from his home in the Zimbabwean
capital, Mr McGown was adamant that his dismissal from the games had
been blown out of proportion. He accused the local media of turning the
dispute into a racial incident and said that people were always looking
for such motives to his actions.
The doctor said he was asked to repeat the name ''Razafindramahtr''
and had opted instead to call on the competitor with the
''unpronounceable seven-syllable name''. A Nigerian referee told him to
pronounce the name correctly.
''Basically what it came down to was that I saw a long name that I
couldn't pronounce,'' he said. ''This is how I am. There was no point in
me getting it wrong.''
Mr McGown confirmed that he had written a letter to the official
concerned telling him to ''wind his neck in'' but said that it was not
offensive and in any case had been confidential. However when he took
the letter to him, the official became extremely annoyed at the contents
and, added Mr McGown, decided to take the letter to the newspapers.
The chairman of the games' organising committee, Tommy Sithole, said
Zimbabwe had formally apologised to the Nigerian delegation and would
now question the Zimbabwe Aquatics Union over their choice of
commentator. The union said it had made a separate apology for Mr
McGown's conduct and described the incident as ''totally
reprehensible''.
Mr McGowan said he had been invited to the 10-day games as he was an
experienced commentator and description of the row as an ''explosion''
in the Zimbabwean press referred solely to the reaction of the Nigerian
official.
''I think they very markedly over-reacted. In this country at this
time people are always willing to look for a racial motive,'' he said.

Washington, Wednesday
THE Senate completed a big reform Bill for the American welfare system
last night, less drastic than one proposed by the House of
Representatives, but still the most sweeping in 60 years.
It passed by a large bipartisan majority and will probably obtain
President Clinton's support.
The two versions will now go to a House-Senate conference, and the
odds are the House side will accede to the Senate's version and the Bill
will be sent to the president.
It proposes cutting off all welfare payments to people after five
years, obliging them to find work in two years, and turns over
administering the welfare system to the states.
Instead of imposing welfare standards and administering the whole
system, Washington would transfer money from tax revenues to the states
in block grants. The states would have great latitude in deciding how to
spend the money.
Opponents fear that those states already most ungenerous in helping
the poor, such as Texas and most of the South, will now cut payments
even further.
The House version proposed welfare mothers would lose their payments
if they had more illegitimate children, and that no teenage mothers
would be entitled to payments. This draconian provision was defeated in
the Senate.
However, the extreme conservatives in that body will try to reinstate
it. One of them, from North Carolina, even voted against the Bill
because he found it insufficiently severe on illegitimacy.
The vote was 87 to 12: only 11 Democratic liberals voted against.
The Senate Bill will save the federal government $67bn over the next
seven years, the period during which the Republicans intend to balance
the budget. The House version would save $104bn.
The chief intent of the Bill is to reform the welfare system, to
encourage people to get jobs rather than to rely on the state for
sustenance, but saving money is also an object.
President Clinton promised during the 1992 election to ''end welfare
as we know it''. He, too, wanted to force people to get jobs, but
believes more should be done to help them, particularly young women with
babies.
His views prevailed in the Senate, which increases funding for child
care and training. The problem is many of the young women on welfare are
barely educated and thus hardly qualified to work for a wage that would
match, let alone surpass, welfare payments.
Everyone concedes that the problem has changed since the Social
Security Acts were passed in the 1930s. Illegitimacy was not a serious
problem then. Now it is a central concern.
Children having children is the root of most of the country's social
problems, particularly in the inner cities.
Hard-line Republicans say the solution is to make young women pay for
their own choices. Liberals say it is the babies who will pay. The
five-year limit on welfare means a young woman who has a baby and goes
on welfare at the age of 16 will be on her own at 21, for the rest of
her life.

A GLASGOW man walked from court yesterday, cleared of gunning down a
man outside a Glasgow bar.
Mr Thomas McGovern, of Drumclog Gardens, Robroyston, was charged with
murder three weeks after Mr John McHugh, a 45-year-old former taxi
driver, died after being shot three times in the chest outside the
city's Ashfield Bar.
Yesterday, after three days' evidence, Solicitor-General Donald McKay,
QC, said he was dropping the charge because of insufficient
corroborative evidence.
Lord Justice Clerk Ross then directed the jury to find Mr McGovern,
28, not guilty of murdering Mr McHugh, on April 9, and he walked from
court to the cheers of friends and relatives.
The jury heard how Mr McHugh, of Broadholm Street, Parkhouse, a
non-drinker, spent the night in the bar.
He walked out at about 10.45pm and was gunned down.
Witnesses said they heard shots and saw two men running from the bar
in Hawthorn Street and being driven off.
Only one witness, Peter Robertson, 32, formerly of nearby Hawthorn
Street, claimed he identified Mr McGovern.
The Crown case collapsed when another key witness, Raymond Bainbridge,
24, said he had lied to police in identifying Mr McGovern at the scene.
Mr Bainbridge, formerly of Hawthorn Street, said he heard three shots
and ran out into the street and saw two men running across the road from
the pub.
Mr Bainbridge said he did not tell the police but later claimed they
told him the lives of both he and his wife were in danger because of
what he had seen.
Mr Bainbridge claimed they were put under police protection and
offered a chance to go to Canada or Australia but elected to stay in
Scotland.
Despite lengthy questioning by the Solicitor-General and warnings
about being on oath, he denied seeing McGovern at the scene.

THE Prime Minister today raised the prospect of a long-term peace
settlement in Bosnia.
He told reporters in Downing Street: ''I think it is safe to say the
door is swinging open for peace, but it is not fully open yet.
''We hope very much that it will be possible to open that door
entirely,'' he said after an hour long meeting with Bosnian president
Alija Izetbegovic.
John Major said the bombardment of Sarajevo was now largely at an end.
''That is very welcome news indeed and we believe we now have the best
prospects of moving towards a ceasefire right across Bosnia and then
towards a full scale settlement, than we have seen for a very long
time.''
Mr Major said his talk with the Bosnian president and Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind had centred on these issues.
''Others have been looking forward. We are looking forward to the
conclusion of negotiations for a ceasefire, then the conclusion of
negotiations for a full scale settlement.
''What we seek in that settlement is to make Sarajevo an open, unified
city and capital of a single state.
''That should be a perfectly clear position for everyone.
''We are very well aware once that has been achieved there will be a
need for a very large international reconstruction effort and a great
deal of preparatory work has been undertaken over the last year or so
and that will continue.''

A SOUTH African rugby player who recently joined Glasgow High
Kelvinside has left the city to return home and play for Eastern
Province. It has been denied that the sudden move is connected to an
incident last week involving allegations of drink driving.
GHK coach Hugh Campbell said Cecil du Plessis, a detective with the
fraud squad in Port Elizabeth, had been recalled because the provincial
side was suffering an injury crisis. It is believed he left yesterday.
The player said he would return to play for the Glasgow side when the
South African season ends in three weeks.
Mr Campbell added: ''Hopefully this is a short-term measure and he
will soon be back, although there are never any guarantees.
''He has decided to go back and play at a high level of rugby for his
province -- we would not stand in his way.
Mr Campbell added that he did not think there was any connection
between last week's incident and the player's decision to leave.
At 6ft 7ins and more than 18-stone the lock forward was brought to Old
Anniesland last month in a bid to add bulk to the team. It was thought
he could help the club win promotion from the reconstructed Division II
to the premiership.
1   A police spokeswoman last night confirmed that a 24-year-old man
was the subject of a report to the procurator-fiscal. It is understood
the report involved Mr du Plessis and allegations of drink driving in
the Saltmarket area.

THE Liberal Democrats yesterday agreed to step up their campaign
against the resumption of nuclear testing by the French, and to put
pressure on the Government to intervene.
The motion presented condemned President Chirac for initiating a new
series of nuclear tests which could hinder progress towards a
comprehensive test ban treaty.
The conference also called on all members to show their opposition to
further nuclear weapons tests by boycotting ''all French products and
services.''
Cheers rang out as representatives agreed the best way to try to force
a change of mind on the French was by hitting their economy.
Environment spokesman Matthew Taylor, backing the boycott call,
reminded activists about the effect of consumer power on Shell's plan to
dump the Brent Spar platform at sea.
The French action was strongly attacked by the party's Foreign Affairs
spokesman, Fife North East MP Menzies Campbell, who said the countries
which possessed nuclear weapons had a ''treaty-based responsibility''
and a moral obligation to assist the process of nuclear disarmament and
to halt proliferation.
For any country to embark on a series of nulcear tests immediately
after signing an extension of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty could
not be justified, Mr Campbell said, adding that this was particularly so
when many of the non-nuclear countries had been persuaded to sign the
extension of the treaty because of undertakings given by the nuclear
powers.
Mr Campbell said: ''We should yield to no-one in our desire for good
relations both with China and France. With both of them we have common
interests and objectives. We have much to learn from both of them.
''But good relations are best built on mutual respect and, when
necessary, straight talking. These tests were a mistake. Both France and
China should bring an end to their nuclear test programmes
immediately.''
Former Ryedale MP Elizabeth Shields urged people to ''hit and hit hard
at the French economy'' after verbal protests had fallen on deaf ears.
''Let us as individuals and a party indicate our total opposition to
the tests in this practical and peaceful manner,'' she said.
Mr Brian Moore, Newcastle, said: ''It is time for people like us to
register our protest and disgust at these unwanted and unnecessary
tests.
''Stop buying Chateau Chirac, the wine with the explosive after
taste!''
Earlier, Mr Taylor had attacked the Prime Minister over reports of
Government collaboration with the French over the nuclear testing
programme.
''If John Major continues in this disgraceful complicity with the
French Government, he will share responsibility for a Pacific Ocean
which will be radioactive thousands of years from now,'' he said.
President Chirac had claimed the tests were safe but scientific
research suggested they carried a ''high environmental risk''.
* Earlier, former party leader Sir David Steel angrily attacked the
Government over arms sales in what could be his last conference speech
as an MP since he is due to stand down at the next election.
He said: ''Arms to Iraq, the Pergau Dam, and now the threatened cuts
in our already inadequate overseas aid budget. What an abdication of any
kind of moral responsibility to suggest that those living in atrocious
conditions in Africa should suffer more to provide tax cuts for the
better off at home.''

Canberra, Wednesday
THE Australian Parliament has banned the taking of news photographs
from certain angles, forcing dapper Prime Minister Paul Keating to deny
that he had ordered a crackdown out of vanity about his bald patch.
Keating made a surprise appearance on his scheduled day off from
Parliament to take issue with a report in a Sydney newspaper, headlined
''PM's brush with a cover-up'', suggesting the new rule was prompted by
pictures of his bald patch.
A new missive from parliamentary authorities to the media ordered all
photographs must be taken from in front of the person speaking, not from
behind.
Three of four accompanying examples of now-banned shots, taken from
behind Keating to show the opposition front bench, showed his bald spot.
''There are those uncharitable souls who also suggest his aversion to
from-the-back pictures relates to his growing bald patch,'' commented
the Sydney Morning Herald.
''His body language supports that view; he compulsively smoothes his
remaining hair over the bald spot, particularly when he's a bit
nervous.''
Keating told Parliament: ''I have been misrepresented . . . I have had
no brush with this issue at all.''--Reuter.

Boston, Wednesday
RINGO STARR'S daughter Lee Starkey was in a Boston hospital tonight
after a second brain operation.
Lee, 24, was at the Brigham Women's Hospital in the care of chief
neurosurgeon Dr Peter Black, with Ringo and the family keeping a
round-the-clock vigil.
Lee had an operation for hydrocephalus -- water on the brain -- at a
private London clinic earlier this month.
Ringo, his wife Barbara Bach, and Lee's brother Jason had checked into
a city hotel but are understood to have left.
''The family have asked for privacy at this time,'' said a spokesman.
Ringo, 55, had three children -- Zak, Jason and Lee -- by his first
wife Maureen. They divorced in 1975.
She died from leukemia eight months ago after a bone marrow
transplant.--AP.

Paris, Wednesday
SECRET military codes that pinpoint the location of Allied warships
have been stolen from a French naval headquarters, Paris confirmed
today.
Two portable computers used to train military personnel in electronic
warfare were among some #34,000 of equipment taken from the naval centre
in Toulon in late July, the Defence Ministry said.
It confirmed that the thieves also stole technical files ''concerning
foreign contingents and material'' in the form of papers and
photographs, but would not give any details.
The statement followed a report by the weekly investigative newspaper
Le Canard Enchaine that claimed computer hackers had lifted routing maps
and ''acoustic identification codes'' for certain Allied ships.
The codes allow instant and precise computer identification of any
ship, from aircraft carriers to oil tankers.
The paper said British and American liaison officers, who had supplied
information about their own vessels, were furious at the security lapse.
It also claimed the codes can pinpoint the whereabouts of nuclear
submarines, such as the four the US currently has deployed in the
Mediterranean.
The Paris Ministry confirmed that the computers ''contain recordings
of signals from radars of ships and planes of different types''.
However it insisted that ''none of the recordings are related to
anti-submarine technology or systems used to listen to and analyse
sounds under the sea''.
The French Government said it had launched a criminal investigation
and the Defence Ministry said security measures were reinforced.
Le Canard Enchaine said Russians were the prime suspects according to
British and US officials, but it went on to say that unidentified French
military officers and investigators suspected ''the Americans were the
authors of the piracy''.
The paper said that for years, Washington had felt Paris was
inadequately protecting its military secrets, and the Pentagon would
occasionally test security inside France.--AP.

SCOTTISH Homes tenants' groups nationwide are calling on Secretary of
State Michael Forsyth to launch an independent inquiry into the methods
used by the housing agency to dispose of its stock.
The tenants from 190 groups throughout Scotland are stepping up their
Freedom of Choice campaign with the production of new leaflets, posters,
and information packs.
In particular, they claim that staff-led initiatives to take over
Scottish Homes' stock have an unfair advantage over bids by ordinary
housing associations.
The campaigners also protest that when disposal ballots are held,
tenants are offered only one alternative landlord.
Campaign secretary Mrs Mary Reid said yesterday that this was
''totally unacceptable in a democratic society''.
Scottish Homes, however, stresses that tenants have access to
independent advice over transfers and are consulted at all stages.
It also insists that staff in the housing management and initiatives
departments operate completely separately.
Mrs Reid said tenants' organisations hoped to meet Cosla leaders to
discuss the possibility of conducting a joint campaign for real freedom
of choice for tenants.

A NEW export strategy, which among other things should reduce the risk
of duplicate Scottish trade missions bumping into each other at foreign
airports, was launched yesterday.
The five-year plan is essentially a shake-up of the structure of
export advice operations. It is designed to cut down on duplication,
provide a clearer path to exports, and ensure that the various agencies
involved know who is doing what.
Industry Minister George Kynoch, unveiling it to an audience of 100
industry representatives in Glasgow yesterday, said Scottish exports
were likely to have injected #14bn into the economy for 1994 -- an
increase of 20% on the previous year.
''Our aim is to ensure that small and medium-sized companies have
every encouragement and support to give them export capability and to
look to the global market-place,'' he said.
Calling for greater co-ordination of effort, he said: ''There are many
organisations with a part to play, but they must work together at a
national and local level. That way our impact will be even greater,
companies will know who does what, and we can plug gaps and eliminate
unnecessary duplication of all our efforts.''
Among the measures contained in the strategy document is one designed
to pull together trade missions in a co-ordinated manner.
To avoid confusion, an overall list of trade missions will be agreed
and published every year by Scottish Trade International, an
organisation set up as the principal export development agency by Mr Ian
Lang in 1991.
Speaking after the conference, Mr Kynoch admitted that there had been
duplication of effort in the past, although he stopped short of saying
it was wasteful. ''Of course there were efforts that could have been
better directed, but what we are trying to do now is get the best
direction of interest and effort for the exporter.''
Mr Kynoch said the registering and publishing of trade missions,
although a small part of the overall strategy, would increase
effectiveness.
''It may reduce the number of trade missions, it may increase the
number,'' he said.
The MP for Kincardine and Deeside conceded that it was entirely
possible that trade missions could literally have followed in each
others footsteps, with only weeks separating them, and that may have had
a negative effect on potential clients.
''The customer is also carrying on his own business and has limited
time to attend exhibitions, and we want to make sure we get him to
exhibitions or trade missions,'' he added.
Talk among representatives of the various bodies gathered yesterday
was also of a reducing of tensions. The creation of Scottish Trade
International grafted a new body on to an already complex scene without
clear delineation of responsibilities.
By tightening up on areas of influence and providing clear roles, it
is hoped the new strategy will harmonise relationships.

AN auxiliary nurse, awarded #60,200 damages yesterday against Fife
Health Board, spoke last night of her relief that her five-year fight
for compensation was over.
Mrs Susan Medlam, 48, was retired on medical grounds after being
certified as unfit for nursing duties.
She suffered back, neck, and arm injuries as she was helping to move a
patient with Parkinson's disease at Glenrothes Hospital in September
1990.
Mrs Medlam, a widow, said: ''I am just overwhelmed and so glad this is
all over. It will help me so much because I have been living on #51 a
week.
''I loved my work and I wanted to go back in another capacity, but
they wouldn't take me. I can get about but I have to watch what I do.
''What I do hope is this decision will help other auxiliary nurses
because they are the worst treated workers in hospitals. Maybe people
will now start appreciating them more.''
Mrs Medlam, of Huntly Drive, Glenrothes, who still has to take pain
killers as a result of her injuries, raised an action for damages at the
Court of Session.
She claimed she was unaware of the proper method for supporting a
patient suffering from Parkinson's disease as they were helped to walk,
because the board had given her no instructions.
Mrs Medlam said she helped move the patient by holding her hands, a
method she had seen another member of staff adopt. This, however, was
unsafe as Parkinson's patients were known to be likely to fall or
stumble because of their illness.
In a written judgment, Lord Osborne said: ''I have reached the
conclusion that the board were at fault in respect of their failure to
provide training for her in relation to assisting such patients to
walk.''
The court heard that a visitor to the hospital had asked the auxiliary
nurse to help move an unfamiliar woman patient to the lavatory. No other
members of staff were available to assist at the time.
But as Mrs Medlam was helping her, the patient warned that she was not
able to continue walking. She tried to get the patient to a chair, but
she fell, pulling the nurse to the floor.
The health board disputed liability and claimed that Mrs Medlam had
attended a lifting course where she was instructed how to support a
disabled patient when walking.
Mrs Medlam said the course did not deal with the task of assisting a
patient who had difficulty in walking. Had she received such training
she would have used it, but instead she had copied a defective method of
support which she had seen another nurse use.
Lord Osborne said he was satisfied Mrs Medlam had established that at
no time did she receive training from the health board on helping
patients to walk, and the injuries she received in the accident had had
serious consequences for her.
The court heard that since then she had not been able to sit, stand,
or walk for long periods without feeling pain and discomfort. She now
gets help from members of her family with heavy housework chores and
shopping.
Last night the health board said it regretted any injury caused to a
nurse and it was unlikely to appeal.
Mrs Medlam raised the action with the support of her union, Unison.

<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>976273738</RECORDNO>

THE Government's approach to relations with the European Community was
attacked strongly yesterday by the Liberal Democrats' Foreign Affairs
spokesman Menzies Campbell.
He told the conference that while the Prime Minister may have won a
temporary fragile ascendancy over the most vehement critics in his own
party, they would not be silenced for long.
He said: ''These are not Euro-sceptics, these are Euro-nihilists. No
matter what concessions the Prime Minister makes to them they will never
be satisfied.''
Mr Campbell questioned what was the most depressing feature of the
stranglehold, disproportionate to their numbers, that the anti-Europeans
now had over the Government.
He continued: ''It is not that they blatantly encourage us to fear and
mistrust our partners in the European Union, unpleasant though that is.
It is not even their small-minded English nationalism which
indiscriminately ignores the diversity of both Europe and the United
kingdom, unpleasant though that is.
''No, the most profoundly depressing feature of their influence is the
paralysis of leadership they have induced in the Cabinet. A paralysis to
be set against the unedifying backdrop of a chorus of Cabinet Ministers
rewriting the record and denying their long-held European sympathies.
''Government policy on Europe does not merely lack vision, it is
timid, introverted and inadequate. Why does this Government now see
Europe as a permanent obstacle, not an unrivalled opportunity?''
Mr Campbell argued that the Liberal Democrats could lead the debate on
Europe and could do so in sharp contrast to Government stagnation on one
hand and Labour equivocation on the other.
He said Britain must play an active role in the preparations for
monetary union and be committed to going ahead with monetary union if
economic conditions make it possible. Finally, any substantial change in
the constitutional arrangements between Britain and the EU must be put
to the people for approval in a referendum.
On Bosnia, Mr Campbell said that as the conference took place there
was a glimmer of hope that the sad and desperate experience may be
coming to an end.

THE Government was accused yesterday of lying over the impact of
abolishing wages councils as Labour attacked the ''scandal'' of falling
pay for the already low paid.
Labour Employment spokeswoman Harriet Harman published new evidence
showing that pay has fallen in industries covered by the councils which
were controversially scrapped two years ago.
Earlier this year, the-then Employment Minister Philip Oppenheim
claimed that the average earnings of workers covered by the main wages
councils before their abolition had risen ''significantly and at a
faster rate'' than workers in all industries average.
Labour claims this is untrue, as the Governments' assertion was based
solely on full time employees, whereas the overwhelming majority,
approximately 80%, work part-time.
In fact, says Labour, wages for the lowest paid had fallen in sectors
covered by the councils, which used to set minimum wage rates. Average
wages in the sectors also had gone down, said the document, which draws
on academic and union research.
Ms Harman said the Government had told ''a pack of lies'' and misled
the public about the effect of abolishing the councils.
''Abolishing the councils achieved the worst of both worlds --
two-and-a-half million workers lost their low pay protection and as a
result have seen their pay rates decrease.''
She also claimed that job creation in the wages councils' sectors had
not been stimulated as a result of abolition and that employment in
those sectors has actualy fallen over the past two years.
The document was discussed at a seminar in London yesterday between
Labour and unions as part of the party's plan to form a policy to
introduce a statutory minimum wage.
At next month's party conference Labour -- which intends setting up a
Low Pay Commission in government to hear submissions from employers and
unions before fixing a minimum wage -- will come under pressure to agree
a formula or figure.
The document published yesterday includes evidence of jobs being
advertised for as little as #1.20 an hour for security work, #2.20 an
hour in nursing homes and #2.40 an hour in contract cleaning companies.
More than a million people earn less than #2.50 an hour, it notes.

<HEADLINE>#25,000 payouts for workmates after judge rules that handshake deal was binding. Pools pact trio win court claim</HEADLINE>

THREE workmates yesterday won a court case against a colleague who
refused to share his #1.8m pools win.
Mr Martin Foulds, Mr Andrew Sullivan, and Mr Graham Ware claimed they
had struck an agreement, sealed by a handshake, with Mr Paul Pitt that,
if any individual won more than #1m on the pools they would give #25,000
to each of the others.
Bournemouth County Court was told that, three days after his win, Mr
Pitt refused to give the others any money and simply offered to buy them
a round of drinks.
The three forklift truck drivers, from Portsmouth, responded by
issuing a writ against him for breach of contract.
Yesterday, a judge ruled in favour of the legal aid-funded action. Mr
Pitt must pay the three men #25,000 each, plus the relevant interest. Mr
Pitt, 28, was also ordered to pay the costs of the case, estimated at up
to #80,000.
The court heard that, when he hit the Littlewoods jackpot in May 1993,
he offered only drinks to Mr Foulds, 28, Mr Sullivan, 26, and Mr Ware,
also 26.
In her ruling, Judge Jane Bonvin said: ''I find on a clear balance of
probability that there was not only discussion about sharing any
winnings but that it was made clear between them that the winner would
pay over to the other three #25,000 in the event of winning more than
#1m.
''Having heard the evidence, I find that the agreement between the
parties in this case amounted to much more than a casual promise, or a
rough and ready statement of intent.
''Such promises amounted to a clear and enforceable agreement.''
An earlier hearing was told that all four men were forklift truck
drivers at Pall Europe Engineering in Portsmouth.
They formed the pools syndicate at work in 1990, agreeing with a
handshake the #25,000 deal.
They all completed separate pools coupons as well as a joint one.
Mr Pitt's individual entry won #1,803,297.15.
The judge said yesterday: ''It would be sensible for anyone who is
currently party to an agreement of this nature to set it down in writing
in order to avoid any uncertainty.''
Outside court, Mr Foulds said: ''We are overjoyed by the result and
that justice has prevailed. Paul Pitt's actions were totally unwarranted
-- he was just being greedy.''
Mr Sullivan said: ''It has been a long two and half years that it has
been going on. It has been a lot of worry.''
Mr Pitt said: ''I have always firmly believed in the truth of my case,
so much so that I have fought it despite knowing that, because they were
legally aided, if I won I would not recover any of my costs.
''I fought it because I believe that there was no agreement between
us.
''Certainly if the others had won on their coupons, I would not have
expected any money.
''I am obviously disappointed with today's judgment and am taking
advice in relation to an appeal.
''It is a clear warning to anyone doing the pools or lottery that they
are open to a claim from friends whether or not they think there is any
agreement between them.
''I am unhappy with the way my character has been portrayed. I am not
an aggressive man -- I'm sure any of my friends would agree.''
He denied he was greedy, adding: ''I could have settled before this
came to court and saved a lot of money.
''But I did not because of the principle at stake. How can that be
greedy?
''Now I have a sense of relief. As far as I am concerned, I am pleased
that after almost two years it is finally out of the way and we can get
on with our lives.
''I'm sure that my former workmates feel the same.
''Since winning the pools my life has been really good and we have
moved to a lovely house. Now I intend to carry on enjoying my life.
''I still feel some resentment towards the three. If I met one walking
along the street I am not sure how I would react.
''It is hard to predict but I think that if they said hello I would
say hello back.''
He went on: ''If they are doing the pools or the lottery, they should
put it down in writing or they leave themselves open to claims from
people they think are their friends.
''Winning the pools was great and improved our life no end -- we have
lost the worry of how to pay bills -- but this dispute has left a bitter
taste in my mouth.''

ENTREPRENEUR Richard Branson, the man once asked by Margaret Thatcher
to get rid of the litter on Britain's streets, has given Labour's
credibility in the City a welcome boost by requesting a private meeting
with party leader Tony Blair.
Mr Branson has invited the Labour leader to discuss regulatory and
competition issues, and to visit one of Virgin Atlantic's passenger
jumbos. The two will meet -- for the first time -- at Virgin
headquarters at Gatwick airport in London tomorrow.
The invitation comes at a crucial time for Labour, just days after the
launch of Mr Blair's campaign to persuade British industry that Labour
can be trusted on the economy.
Mr Branson was much admired by Lady Thatcher as an embodiment of the
entrepreneurial revolution she claimed to have unleashed on Britain in
the eighties.
However, there have been suggestions recently that he has little
enthusiasm for the current Government. Labour officials last night said
the meeting was further proof of the party's pro-business credentials.
No agenda has been set, although Mr Branson is expected to raise his
airline's running battle with British Airways over alleged unfair
practices. Sources close to Mr Blair said they did not expect him to
solicit a contribution to Labour party funds.
Yesterday he addressed a gathering of businessmen in Birmingham on the
first leg of his round-Britain ''Business Tour''. He announced a series
of policy initiatives aimed at helping small businesses, including:
* A Code of Practice to tackle late payment by large firms that use
small companies as a source of interest-free finance by buying sevices
and delaying payment. Adopting the Code would be made a requirement for
obtaining official quality certifications. All Government and other
public bodies would set an example by adopting a 30 day payment rule.
* Development agencies in Scotland would be strengthened, and new ones
created in England, to help new small businesses find start-up finance.
* A legal right to a debt moratorium to help give small businesses
facing pressure from creditors a chance to survive.
''Sound firms facing short term problems must be given a helping hand
by Government. For too long we have had a do-nothing philosophy that has
driven too many innovative entrepreneurs to the wall,'' he said.
''A Labour government will not dictate to firms or try to run
industry. What it will do and can do, is provide the framework I have
just outlined, so that we build more world class companies, create more
jobs, and improve the living standards and opportunities for all our
people,'' he added.
Meanwhile Labour officials and MPs have reacted angrily to an article
in yesterday's Birmingham Post newspaper based on an interview with Mr
Blair which claimed he was considering changing the party's name to the
Social Democratic Party.
Mr Blair's press secretary, Mr Alastair Campbell, and former Labour
deputy leader Roy Hattersley, who was quoted in the article, have
written to the newspaper demanding an apology and a correction.
Under the headline ''We are the Social Democrats'' the newspaper
quoted Mr Blair as saying ''in other European countries the Labour Party
would be called the Social Democratic Party''.
Tory chairman Brian Mawhinney seized on the remarks as
''extraordinary'' proof that Mr Blair expects a hung Parliament at the
next election. Earlier this week Mr Blair offered to discuss policy with
the Liberal Democrats.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said in Glasgow: ''I am not
going to support a Labour government, or any government, that's
committed to renationalisation, a return to a command economy, that's
unclear on Europe and not going to invest in education.''
He described Mr Blair as a ''sincere and straightforward politician
who says what I think he believes in''.
However, asked if he would serve in a minority Blair government, Mr
Ashdown told BBC TV's Conference Live programme: ''I would rather have
no job in government if what that government was doing was wrong for
Britain ...
''I'm in politics to do things, rather than to be things.''
A spokesman for Mr Blair dismissed the reaction to his remarks as a
malicious distortion. Mr Blair had simply stated a fact, the Labour
shares common policies with other socialist parties elsewhere in Europe.
''It's a simple statement of fact that he's happy to repeat but should
be invested with no meaning,'' the spokesman said.
However, the remark, however true, will heighten the dismay felt on
the Left of the party at what is felt to be Labour's steady drift to the
right under Mr Blair. For many MPs and activists, any comparison with
the defunct British SDP is a reminder of how far Labour has changed in
the past year.

<HEADLINE>Red kite project is flying high</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976273743</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PROJECT to re-introduce red kites to Scotland has been a major
success, with some hi-tech help and, despite the threat of illegal
poisoning, the birds of prey have had their best-yet breeding season in
the UK.
In Scotland, 11 pairs bred successfully, raising 26 young and, for the
first time, the young were reared by birds which were born in this
country. However, seven birds freed from secret sites in the North of
Scotland have been found dead, six were poisoned and one was shot.
The red kite was virtually exterminated from Scotland during Victorian
times as it was regarded as a pest. Then egg collectors sealed its fate.
Although a few pairs remained in Wales and with special protection
grew to about 122 pairs, there were not enough to spread and breed
elsewhere in Britain.
In 1989, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish
Natural Heritage -- who re-introduced the sea eagle to Britain and had
success in protecting the osprey -- began importing young birds from
Sweden, with the help of the RAF and a network of international
conservation and commercial organisations.
A total of 196 birds were involved, 103 of them released in England.
The Scottish birds were brought from Sweden at four weeks of age and
fitted with tiny radio transmitters with which the RSPB is able to track
them and monitor their breeding.
Mr Stuart Housden, the society's director for Scotland, said: ''The
first breeding by Scottish-born kites represents an important new phase
in this exciting story.
''It shows that we are well on the way to re-establishing a viable
kite population in Scotland and the many farmers and landowners who have
welcomed the kites on their land have contributed to this.''
The red kite is a globally threatened species, with only 12,000 pairs
remaining, mostly in Spain, France, Germany, and Sweden.
However, the featherlight transmitters, sewed and glued on to the
birds' tails, are only effective over 20-30 miles of open country and in
mountainous Scotland, the RSPB sometimes have difficulty locating the
young birds who don't start breeding for two or three years.

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton last night claimed a ''most
definite'' advance for the Northern Ireland peace process after two days
of dialogue with hard-line loyalists.
He completed a tough-talking two-hour session in Dublin with the
Progressive Unionist Party -- following exchanges on Tuesday with the
allied Ulster Democratic Party -- and reported: ''A new line of formal
communication has now been opened.
''It enriches the peace process, makes it more balanced and therefore
improves the prospects for its ultimate success.''
Looking forward to an expected early meeting with new Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble, he added: ''We now want the other Unionist
parties to come and talk as well.''
Both fringe Unionist groups -- whose total discussions in Dublin
amounted to four hours -- have links with Northern Ireland's loyalist
paramilitary organisations, and both meetings could not have been
contemplated a little more than a year ago, before the continuing
terrorist ceasefire.
Mr Bruton faced a particularly hard line of questioning from PUP
leader David Ervine, on his reasons for calling off this month's
scheduled summit with Prime Minister John Major, which was to have
marked a fresh breakthrough for the peace bid.
The Irish premier postponed the meeting when it became clear that
senior London and Dublin civil servants could not agree a framework for
the summit because of widening differences over the issue of
decommissioning arms held by the IRA and loyalist terror groups.
He said the PUP meeting had been very frank. ''No one held things
back, we all said what was on our minds. As a result of that, we
understand each other better.''
Earlier, in the Dail, Mr Bruton had challenged paramilitaries on all
sides in Northern Ireland -- as well as their political representatives
-- to come up with their own ideas to end the deadlock caused by the
arms row.
He told the PUP: ''We have made a serious effort to break the impasse.
It is for the other parties to realise they have a problem with the
guns, and they have the first responsibility for solving it.''
Mr Ervine said: ''We said what we thought on that issue, but what we
said will remain private. These talks have certainly been useful to us,
and I would have thought that the Irish Government will have found them
useful, too.

THE private construction and operation proposed for a new Stonehaven
hospital was bitterly opposed by people in the area, even local
Conservatives, the SNP conference was told yesterday.
A motion from the Stonehaven branch condemning private sector
involvement in the project as ''a sinister development deliberately
introduced into a Tory and Independment dominated political backwater''
was passed unanimously by the conference.
It was one of a series of motions on problems in the health service
which dominated the opening day of the conference.
Stonehaven delegate Jane Vigurs said Scottish Office Minister and
Local MP George Kynoch was showing a flagrant disregard for public
opinion, ignoring profound local dissatisfaction at the prospect of the
private sector building and running the proposed hospital.
''The Government has an uncaring and cavalier attitude to the
electorate,'' she said. ''I know this motion will in all probability be
to no avail as the Government pushes towards the privatisation of the
NHS with Stonehaven as its flagship.''
She disclosed that the local constituency party had carried out a
market research survey of almost 1000 people in the Stonehaven and
Mearns areas and had discovered overwhelming opposition to the new
community hospital being put out to private tender.
Almost 80% of local people were against this idea and even among those
who said they were Conservative voters opposition ran at 70%. More than
58% (51% in the case of Tories) thought a private firm would deliver a
poorer service, and more than 70% (65% of Tories) believed the service
would not remain free of charge.
Almost 73% (60% in the case of Tories) did not believe that a market
economy was appropriate for the working of NHS hospitals, and almost 87%
(82% of Tories) did not like the idea that the new hospital would not be
owned by the NHS.
Former SNP health spokesman John Hulbert said it was inevitable that
staff numbers and conditions at a privatised Stonehaven hospital would
be squeezed.

CIGARETTE prices should be increased to pay for health promotion, the
Liberal Democrat conference agreed yesterday.
Party supporters decided the extra tax revenue should be used to
abolish charges for eye and dental checks.
The additional income for the Exchequer also would be used to help
freeze prescription charges.
Health spokesman Alex Carlile said that at #5.25 per item,
prescription charges were no long the subsidy they were meant to be.
''It is now levied unashamedly by the Government as a tax on sickness.''

A HEALTH board was last night accused of encouraging promiscuity among
children through its controversial strategy to cut teenage pregnancies.
A leading Roman Catholic priest described Tayside Health Board as
''part of the problem, rather than the solution'' and called on Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth to intervene.
Youngsters in Tayside, which has the highest incidence of teenage
abortions and pregancies in Scotland, are given leaflets which include
contraceptive advice and phone numbers to obtain the morning-after pill.
Girls as young as 12 can get access to the information at clinics and
sex education lessons.
Last night Monsignor Joseph Creegan, the Roman Catholic Church's
representative on Tayside Regional Council's education committee, said:
''There seems no limit to the extent to which this health board will go,
with total disregard for any suggestion that there are moral issues to
be considered.
''They are locked into a situation where they are trying to inculcate
responsible behaviour in society, but there is no basis of
responsibility in their own actions.
''Tayside Health Board is simply encouraging promiscuity among
children.''
Monsignor Creegan has written to Mr Forsyth asking him to review the
health board's membership.
Last night a Tayside Health Board spokesman said: ''There is ample
evidence that this facility is required to be available to young people
so that advice can be obtained to help them to avoid the current tragic
level of under-age conception.
''It is not accurate to assume that methods of offering help and
advice to those young people, who perceive that they wish to take
advantage of the service offered, equates to encouraging promiscuity --
merely it is acceptance of the reality of the pressures some teenagers
undoubtedly are exposed to.''

ONE of New York's top police officers yesterday raised an eyebrow and
expressed mild surprise on learning that he had just shared a television
platform with a convicted murderer, and another man tried for Glasgow's
most highly-publicised killing of recent times.
Deputy Commissioner Jack Maple of New York Police Department was
recording a studio debate for the Channel 4 programme, Living with
Violence -- Street Fighting Men, at The Renfrew Ferry, where his fellow
guests included musician Pat Kane and murderer Hugh Collins, on licence
from a life sentence.
The fourth member of the panel was Paul Ferris, tried and acquitted
for the murder of Arthur Thompson Jnr, drug dealer son of Glasgow's
erstwhile Godfather, Arthur Thompson, Snr.
Mr Maple -- who dined the previous evening with Strathclyde's deputy
chief constable, Mr James Richardson -- said later he had found his
fellow TV guests interesting and personable.
''I was not queasy about that. I did not really know much about their
background but I have met people from all backgrounds and I was not
uneasy,'' he said.
The programme is part of the series, Living with Violence, produced by
Wark Clements, which will be broadcast next week. Mr Maple said
afterwards he was certain that New York could learn from Glasgow's
experience.

THE Scottish Office is giving Santa the thumbs down in the interests
of road safety.
Aviemore Mountain Resort wants to erect a 20 by 10ft multi-coloured
sign advertising its Santa Claus Land children's theme park. The
Scottish Office and the local planning officer are against it.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''The purpose of the sign is to
distract the attention of motorists travelling on the A9 in a location
where speeds can be high.
''In the last few years, the safety record of the A9 has been
improving and we wish to see this trend continue.
''The proposed sign is also visually intrusive in an area often
commended for its natural scenic beauty.''
Planning officer John Partridge wasn't exactly full of Christmas cheer
about the sign either.
He said: ''The proposal is so inappropriate, comment from me is almost
superfluous.''
Aviemore Mountain Resort claims the theme park suffers because it is
difficult to find and is disadvantaged by road sign policy.
The company said signs listing other attractions are already in place
at the north and south A9 junctions leading to Aviemore.
A company spokesman said: ''This is a last-ditch attempt to put
ourselves on an even keel with other attractions in the area.''
The planning application will be considered at Kingussie on Monday.

<TEXT>
UP to #2m worth of sporting and tourism revenue could be lost to the
Borders each year unless steps are taken to restore the level of spring
salmon runs on the River Tweed.
A report yesterday from the Tweed Foundation, the scientific body
which monitors the Tweed catchment area, warns that the decline over the
past 20 years in rod catches of spring and summer salmon poses a
significant threat to jobs and businesses.
Without early season salmon, says the report, the fishing season would
run only from mid September until the end of November, putting the
viability of many sporting salmon fisheries at risk and threatening
hotels and service industries.
Now a consultation document has gone out to landowners, farmers,
foresters, and developers seeking support and opinions on a programme to
boost spawning levels by improving riverside habitat, which has been
seriously reduced by stock grazing.
A grant-aided programme of bankside fencing and controlled grazing is
being recommended and the Tweed is helping to pioneer a new Scottish
Office waterside margin set-aside scheme for which it will have #200,000
in EC cash available. Others rivers taking part in the pilot scheme are
the Dee, Spey, and Don.
Tweed Foundation biologist Dr Ronald Campbell said yesterday: ''The
pattern of salmon runs seems to go in cycles. At the beginning of this
century, the bulk of salmon on the Tweed were autumn fish. Then, within
10 years of 1915, there was a major swing to spring. Now we appear to be
going back to autumn.
''It seems to be something to do with sea temperatures and feeding and
the habitat enhancement programme is essential to maintain or improve
spring levels.''

ROSS, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy will meet senior
representatives of the Railway Users Consultative Committee for Scotland
in Glasgow today to try to persuade them to hold a public inquiry into
the withdrawal of the Skye ferry once the bridge opens next month.
Last week, the Scottish Office had conceded that the committee
retained the right to call public inquiries into ferry withdrawals.
The committee decided to begin the consultative procedure but it was
thought in some quarters unlikely that a full public inquiry would be
called, as the ferry would already be withdrawn.
It has always been accepted that the ferry to Skye would come off but
Mr Kennedy said yesterday: ''This is an important test case and public
opinion must be consulted. Equally, such an inquiry would be a further
opportunity to expose the shortcomings in the toll-funded bridge
contract.''
A ban on credit facilities for commercial vehicles using the bridge
may be lifted following recent talks between Skye and Lochalsh
Enterprise and Skye Bridge Ltd.
The company had said that it would be unwilling to adopt the policy of
ferry firm Caledonian MacBrayne in allowing hauliers credit facilities
on the crossing.
It had offered a pre-payment scheme with vouchers which would be
redeemed if not used.
Hauliers, however, opposed this idea, saying the scheme would be
unworkable. They also fear that, without credit, they would have to
carry large sums of cash on their vehicles.
Under the toll rate announced last week, HGV Class 2 vehicles will pay
#25.40 to cross the bridge one-way, #24.61 if a book of 10 discount
tickets is bought.
After talks last week, Sky Bridge Limited now says it will work with
the local enterprise company to devise a solution.
The chairman of Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise, Dr Jim Hunter, said a
credit or car charge scheme would be investigated.
Meanwhile, concerns from tourist businesses that leaflets promoting
Skye and Lochalsh would not be distributed by bridge toll collectors
have also been partly allayed.
Skye Bridge chairman Sir Iain Noble said the company recognised that
the bridge crossing would be an important marketing outlet: ''The toll
bridge collectors need to build up expertise and speed. Once this has
been achieved, it is hoped that a way can be found to distribute
leaflets along with their other tasks.
''The leaflets obviously have an important role to play in promoting
Skye to the visitors.''
In addition, the toll collectors are to take part in a one-day Welcome
Host course organised by the LEC to ensure that people using the bridge
receive the highest standards of customer service.

Senior officers spent most of yesterday surveying the damage to their
headquarters in the capital's Fettes area, caused by a burst water main
which sent thousand of gallons cascading down six floors yesterday
morning.
The force's control room was flooded and had to be moved to St
Leonard's Police Station in the city's Pleasance. Other departments
affected included the offices of the Serious Crime Squad, CID, and the
criminal records department.
Telephone and computer lines were not affected and it is believed that
no criminal records were damaged. Firefighters were brought in to help

Naval Dockyard yesterday prompted a call for rapid government action
from Fife MPs and council leaders.
The delay was revealed in a letter from Defence Procurement Minister
James Arbuthnot to Dunfermline West MP Rachel Squire, which stated four
offers which met bid guidelines had been received for the site.
However, the Minister said none of the bids was entirely satisfactory
and that further talks were set to take place with the bidders.
A decision on the successful bidder was due to have been made at the
end of last week.
Mr Arbuthnot added: ''I expect a preferred tenderer to emerge later in
October, leading to a legally binding sale of the base to the successful
purchaser by March 31, 1996.''
Ms Squire and Dunfermline East MP Gordon Brown yesterday urged Defence
Secretary Michael Portillo and Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to use
their influence to ensure a decision is reached by mid-October.
Ms Squire said speedy action was essential to ensure a smooth
transition when the base closed next April.
''A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes to gear up
employment and training initiatives for when the base closes. It is
vital the new owners become involved no later than mid-October to ensure
the possibility of a seamless transfer of facilities and personnel.''
Rumours suggesting a decision on the base might not be announced
before Christmas had prompted her to write to the Procurement Minister
expressing concern, along with the Shadow Defence Secretary, Mr David
Clark.
Ms Squire added: ''There are those who want to delay the decision. It
is in no-one's interest in Scotland that the base lies empty for
months.''
Both Dunfermline MPs have called for a decision no later than October
16, in time for the defence debate in the House of Commons.
Fife Regional Council leader Councillor John MacDougall, who chaired
the campaign which prevented total closure of the base, also joined the
call for an early decision on the redevelopment of the site.
He warned that a delay could lead to the loss of skills and interest
in the base.
''The base is still operational, being maintained and employing people
with specialist skills who will be able to train others when it goes
into the ownership of a development consortium.
''All this could be lost and those developers who have put in bids
could lose interest in the site if it becomes degraded over time and
requires extensive work to restore it.''
The identity of the bidders remains secret, although Babcock
management, part of the consortium Rosyth 2000, which includes Forth
Ports Authority, the Bank of Scotland, and ScottishPower, had earlier
expressed an interest.
Clydeport was also strongly rumoured to be interested.

The #2m plan by Walker Group Scotland Ltd involves property at 7-16
Rothesay Terrace, formerly the headquarters of the North of Scotland
Hydro-Electric Board. The buildings, which date from between 1885 and
1904, are B listed and have stood empty for a number of years.
The city council's development control committee was told four
internal staircases would have to be removed but original main rooms

HERALD feature writer Gavin Bell has won the 1995 Thomas Cook Travel
Book Award for his book, In Search of Tusitala, retracing the journeys
of Robert Louis Stevenson across the South Seas.
The #7500 award founded in 1980 is intended to encourage the art of
travel writing, including guide books. Mr Bell, who is 48 and single,
comes from Hamilton. He was brought up in Motherwell and still supports
the local team.
Educated at Hutchesons' Grammar School, Glasgow, he took up the family
profession of journalism on leaving school. After working on newspapers
in Scotland, including the Daily Record and the Scottish Daily Mail, he
moved to Paris to join Agence France Presse.
He then became a Reuter's correspondent, after which, for seven years,
he was on the foreign staff of The Times. He served in Delhi, Seoul --
where, being a keen runner, he talked himself into taking part in one of
the relay teams which carried the Olympic flame to the Seoul games --
and finally Johannesburg.
A change of editor at The Times led to a decision to bring him back to
London and, by mutual agreement, he left the paper. His departure,
accompanied by an appropriate amount of severance pay, allowed him to
make the trip tracing Stevenson's travels across the Pacific to Western
Samoa, where the writer acquired the name, Tusitala, or ''teller of
tales'' which resulted in the award winning book. It was published last
year to coincide with the centenary of Stevenson's death.
RLS had long been a hero and Bell's travels in his footsteps took him
from Hawaii by way of Kiribati to some of the most remote islands on
earth in French Polynesia. The aim was to look at Stevenson's life and
link his experiences with what Bell found had happened to the islands
and the islanders.
Sir John Ure, chairman of the judges, a non-executive director of the
Thomas Cook Group, said the standard of entries had been exceptionally
high and selecting the short list of five titles from the 50 entrants
had been extremely tough.
Previous winners have included Paul Theroux, Jonathan Raban, Geoffrey
Moorhouse, and Eric Newby.

HERCULE Poirot's reign as the only famous Belgian may be about to end.
The name of Jean-Marc Bosman might well usurp Agatha Christie's
smooth-talking investigator before 1995 is out.
This 30-year-old footballer, who simply wanted to leave FC Liege and
join French team Dunkirk, has single-handedly ignited a revolution that
will have a massive effect on football in Europe.
Bosman took on the entire European football hierarchy via the EC court
and has just about knocked them out of the ball park.
The consequence of yesterday's recommendation will have enormous
repercussions throughout the football board rooms of the continent.
There will be much weeping and gnashing of gold fillings, yet it is
the ruthless application of the current system which has forced the EC,
which did not want to be involved and, indeed, asked UEFA itself some
time ago to devise a fairer system of player movement, to respond to
Bosman's plea.
Bosman was virtually forced out of the game by Liege, but that was not
a solitary example of the dictatorial vindictiveness that affected many
players abroad and a few in this country, too. It was certain that, one
day, someone would challenge the transfer system which unquestionably
goes against all the natural rights of workers in any trade or business
under EC rules. Now the fire has been lit and the burning will begin.
Tony Higgins, secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers
Association, has been warning the leaders of European football for some
time the worst scenario would be forced upon them if they did not act
themselves.
He will want to see the entire judgment, which is believed will run to
253 pages, before deciding his next move but there are a couple of
certainties which he acknowledges as a result of the recommendation, if
it is ratified.
It is inevitable the rich clubs and players will get richer and the
poor will require safeguards to prevent them disappearing into a limbo
where ambitions are best forgotten and buried.
The advocate general suggested football could use a percentage of
major clubs' income to support smaller teams and maybe that is one
avenue which will be researched.
The combination of no restrictions on foreigners and abandonment of
transfer fees will mean the most powerful clubs in Europe -- AC Milan,
Juventus, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, et al -- will compete for the
world's best players, as they have always done but with the difference
they are free to sign the lot.
The fact is that the very best players will end up circulating among a
handful of clubs.
The other side of the equation does not just include the smaller
clubs, who would get no reward for bringing on youngsters to the level
where they would be sought by better-off teams.
Current European champions Ajax have the most sophisticated coaching
system in the world, which takes five-year-olds through the ranks to top
team positions and sells one or two every so often to finance the next
generation. Under the proposed deal, their system would reap no return
unless they managed to sell during contract time.
That is the tip of the iceberg which would lead to the smaller clubs
in countries throughout Europe -- clubs whose existence depends on
selling a player every so often.
In the Scottish first division, there are teams like St Mirren, who
have set out their stall on a youth policy which would be of complete
benefit only if one or two of their young stars can be sold for good
money.
Mr Higgins shares all of the fears. He said: ''It would be our hope
that a compensation system can be devised to reward teams who find and
nurture the young players in every country.
''For the moment, we have to wait to see if the judge will recommend a
time scale for the game to sort out its transfer system and then it
might be up to UEFA and the European Players Association to sit down and
come up with a new arrangement which will comply with the court's
requirements.''
He has already been involved in a number of meetings at UEFA level to
discuss the prospects if Bosman succeeded.
However it turns out, the game is never going to be the same again.
Clubs of all sizes will have to offer longer contracts in their own
interests but players will be well primed by agents of the disadvantages
of such deals.
The end product, ironically, may be the preservation and prosperity of
the most powerful teams in the EC, which may not quite have been what
Monsieur Bosman set out to achieve.

THE most surprising aspect of the Bosman judgment is that the same
thing did not happen years ago.
It is not the law which has changed. The Treaty of Rome has been
around for 40 years. Later Euro-tomes reinforced the principle of free
movement of labour in Europe.
There was never an opt-out clause for football. What happened was
simply that those who control the game, at national and European levels,
chose to ignore the law. As long as no player was prepared to abandon
his career and pursue his case with tenacity, they got away with it.
Even yesterday, UEFA was unreconciled to change, asserting that the
German judge's ruling was ''only an opinion''. They are not finished
fighting to retain the powers which dictate footballers can be bought,
sold, or sidelined without the right to determine their own futures even
when contracts expire.
Whatever its precise status, yesterday's news from Brussels does
change relationships within the game irrevocably. It does not mean the
imminent collapse of the cross-border transfer system, far less the
domestic one. However, it does mean the players' representatives will
have to approve whatever structures and procedures are to exist in
future.
That is the crucial principle which the football authorities have gone
to such extraordinary lengths to avoid conceding. For 25 years, UEFA has
refused to recognise FIFPRO, the federation of European players' unions.
Only as the Bosman judgment day loomed did they relax that position. In
future, they will have no choice in the matter.
Yesterday's ruling was the goal everyone could see coming, yet the
UEFA defence was incapable of making the moves to stop it.
For decades, it shut down such threats by procrastination, lobbying in
Brussels, and by relying on the fact that footloose footballers, with
only short careers to contemplate, do not make for persistent litigants.
Every other potential challenge has been shut down or petered out,
including the Hans Gilhaus affair, when the player was sidelined for
months by Aberdeen's refusal to part with him.
Bosman, earlier this year, was offered more than #600,000 to forget
the case and enjoy life outside football. The source would be difficult
to locate but there is no doubt which interests would have been served.
At a Strasbourg meeting, Bosman and his lawyers set out their
positions. They wanted to carry on but needed financial backing and
security from the players' associations. They got it and, to UEFA's
bewilderment, the case continued.
People like Gordon Taylor of the English Professional Footballers
Association (now chairman of FIFPRO) and Tony Higgins of the Scottish
PFA do not want to see a collapse in the transfer system, or some other
form of compensation to clubs which recognise investment in players.
They are aware of the implications this would have for many clubs and,
therefore, many of their members.
However, they do want to be consulted, as a right, on how the
financial basis of player movements should now evolve, as well as issues
like the ''three foreigner rule'' and all the other exceptions to the
''free movement'' principal in the game.
It remains to be seen whether UEFA and its constituent associations,
in the light of yesterday's developments, can finally reconcile itself
to the kind of discussions which would lead to a stable, agreed set of
procedures for the future. If not, it may indeed be a case of ''apres
Bosman, le deluge''.

OWNERS of Reliant Robins in the Western Isles have been spared the
expense of a 110-mile round trip, including a ferry journey, for MoT
tests.
The prospect arose when Mitchells Garage in Stornoway closed last
month. It was the only garage on Lewis equipped with a car hoist adapted
for three-wheel vehicles.
A hoist used for inspecting the underside of a Robin needs a central
wheel supporting platform and the nearest garage with this was in
Inverness, 55 miles and a ferry journey away.
After protests by all seven Reliant Robin owners in the Western Isles
and mutterings that they would run their cars without test certificates,
the Vehicle Inspectorate has made arrangements with a local garage in
Stornoway to carry out Class 3 tests.
''We hope to be able to get our inspector out to Stornoway next week
to formally authorise the premises and they will then be able to start
testing Reliant Robins.''
Robin driver Donald MacLeod, 54, said: ''I'm delighted. This is what
we wanted all along -- another garage to set up the ramp that's required
for three-wheelers.
''It's going to save a lot of hassle for us not having to go to
Inverness.''
Mr MacLeod said it would have cost more than #100 to get to Inverness,
including #70 for the car on the ferry, petrol costs, and perhaps an
overnight stay.
An MoT test on a three-wheeler currently costs #21.98, compared to
#26.10 for a four-wheel vehicle.

THE Advocate General of the European Court of Justice, Carl Otto Lenz,
has issued an opinion advising that football clubs should be prohibited
from being able to demand transfer payments for players whose contracts
have expired.
Mr Lenz also wants clubs to field as many Europeans in competitions as
they want.
His ruling follows an action brought by Jean-Marc Bosman, a
30-year-old Belgian footballer.
In a row over a thwarted move, he sued his club FC Liege for damages,
claiming breach of contract and arguing the transfer system was illegal.
He wanted to join French team Dunkirk.
The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg was asked by Belgian
judges to decide if the transfer system was compatible with European law
and in particular the free movement of workers as described in Article
48 of the Treaty of Rome.
They were also asked to rule on two technical aspects relating to
whether Bosman's treatment breached laws governing free and fair
competition.
The case was sent to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in
Luxembourg. The Advocate General's findings yesterday are described
officially as a ''proposal'' to be considered by the ECJ judges. It is
not binding but judges almost routinely support his views.

FIRST division football club Clydebank will have a playing staff of
just 15 and do away with reserve and youth teams if the implications of
yesterday's European Court of Justice findings prove as devastating as
feared.
Even a premier division club in European competition this year
privately forecast there would be job losses among its players. The
secretary said the court's recommendations meant only that ''rich clubs
will get richer and poor clubs poorer''.
Not one Scottish club said Carl Otto Lenz's bid to prohibit clubs from
being able to demand transfer payments for players whose contracts have
expired would sound their death knell.
However, Scottish Football League secretary Peter Donald said the
proposals, subject to ratification in late November, would be damaging.
He said many clubs face ongoing financial difficulties because they rely
on sales to reduce burdens.
In England, an FA Premier League lawyer said small clubs would be
threatened and millions of pounds wiped off the value of star players.
Mr Lenz also wants clubs to field as many Europeans in competitions as
they want, which delighted Rangers.
The recommendations come within weeks of a Price Waterhouse report
into the financial state of Scottish football which underlined that only
Airdrie had current assets in the first division in season 1993-94,
thanks to selling their stadium.
The report also warned that transfer fees and wages remain a
significant element in the game, accounting for more than half total
turnover.
Clydebank director, Mr Ian Steedman, predicted Kilbowie playing staff
could drop from more than 30 to 15, but added: ''The implications for
football as a whole are grave -- far more than some clubs not
surviving.''
He argued there would be fewer professionals around and less money to
encourage more people into the game. He went on: ''Many
middle-of-the-road clubs aspire to better things by spending more money
than they have, making up the shortfall by gambling on a transfer. If
that income is lost, then wage bills have to be cut.''
Several clubs, including Dundee United -- whose turnaround from loss
to profit in 1994 can be traced to Duncan Ferguson's transfer to Rangers
-- declined to comment until they have received the rulings.
Ross County vice-chairman, Mr Donnie MacBean, said: ''This is bad
news.'' Mr MacBean, whose club sold Barry Wilson to Raith Rovers last
year for #45,000, helping finances, said: ''This could damage small
clubs. It will make them vulnerable to bigger clubs taking the pick of
players who refuse to sign long contracts.''
However, compensation will be allowed for nurturing players who move
on for the very first time -- a significant boost for small clubs.
A Premier club secretary said lost transfer fees would mean clubs
could not afford to keep so many staff on the payroll. He warned it
would even filter down to supporting children's nursery teams.
''Many clubs rely on transfer fees and this will mean fewer players on
the books. Nor will you want to tie teenagers to longer-term contracts
when they do not make the grade but still have to be paid.''
Rangers vice-chairman, Mr Donald Findlay QC, who has made no secret of
his loathing of restricted trade, was adamant that Scottish football
must enter the real world.
He insisted a European League would exist within five to 10 years but
the pool of Scottish players was too small to compete at the highest
level.
Celtic chairman Fergus McCann said: ''The ruling has considerable
implications for football and will undoubtably make transfer
transactions more complex.''
Players' agent Raymond Sparkes said the rulings would have the most
dramatic and occasionally catastrophic effects on the Scottish game:
''We are in a situation where only the strongest will survive. There
will be casualties.''
He suggested agents' negotiating skills would be even more in demand
as clubs looked to lock in their best players for as long as possible.
The court's rulings boil down to two crucial sentences in 120 pages
that Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome should prohibit:
* a club ''from being able to demand and receive payment of a sum of
money when one of its players whose contract has expired is engaged by
another club''.
* access of ''players who are nationals of another member state to
club competitions organised by the national and international
associations from being restricted''.

AS the 700 delegates gathered in Perth, the party was determined to

Nationalists hope to hammer home their message that full independence
is not just an act of courage but makes economic sense.
They plan to launch an ''economics of independence'' campaign in the
autumn to convince Scots of the hard-headed soundness of their economic
arguments.
They also have made much of a recent opinion poll which indicated 48%
of Scots thought their families would be better off in an independent
Scotland while only 20% thought they would be worse off.
Perth was the scene of the party's latest electoral triumphin May when
Roseanna Cunningham captured the seat made vacant by the death of Tory
MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn -- and the SNP also captured control of the
new local council.
The party says it is be challenging Labour hard in Scotland and that
the Tony Blair ''bubble'' north of the Border is bursting.

A NUMBER of chairmen of Scottish football clubs would have been
listening with interest yesterday when the Preliminary Opinion in the
Bosman case was made public.
While this decision by the Advocate General is not binding on the
judges of the European Court of Justice, in the past, in almost all
cases, his views were supported.
When the final decision is announced towards the end of the year, the
chances are that football clubs throughout Europe will no longer be able
to demand and receive payment of a sum of money when a football player's
contract has expired if that player moves to a different club.
This decision is bound to cause potential problems to every single
senior and junior club in Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales, with
the exception of one -- my own club, Queen's Park, who have steadfastly
refused since their inception in 1867 to either pay or receive fees
relating to the transfer of players.
Before anyone jumps in and says the Spiders have no alternative
because all their players are amateur, I would point out that, on quite
a number of occasions, clubs have offered Queen's Park some form of
compensation when a player has moved on and, on every such occasion, the
club has politely but firmly declined to accept -- although there have
been, and still are, many occasions when they could have done with the
money.
Perhaps now one or two others might realise the problems that can
exist if the law outlaws transfer fees to clubs when a contract expires.
The clubs that would be hit hardest will be those in the lower
divisions who desperately need the money from transfer fees to keep
going. In football, however, as in any other business, if your back is
to the wall you can often find a solution, and I believe that is what
our clubs will do.
Co-operation is the name of the game and if all clubs agree to protect
each other's interests, perhaps this ruling won't have the effect some
predict.
Let us remember it is still the dream of very many boys to succeed in
the world of professional football and you would be quite amazed at some
of the deals players will accept from professional clubs and which will
then legally bind them.
Some clubs have ruthlessly exploited the situation over the years but
the bottom line is that many young players jump at any deal offered just
to get a foothold in the professional game.
Let us take an example to show how I think the system might work if
the European Court accept the Opinion.
John Smith is an aspiring young amateur player whose skills have been
noticed by Third Division side Real Garthamlock. He is offered a
two-year contract which contains clauses far more advantageous to the
club than to himself. In his zeal to step on the soccer ladder, he
signs.
During his first season, he scores 28 goals and, with the second
season only four months old, he attracts the attention of the top
premier league team Inter Milanda. As football is his bread and butter,
he is desperate to make a move and Real Garthamlock are equally
desperate to pick up the large transfer fee.
By this time, John has enlisted the assistance of one of our
ubiquitous agents, who tells him to sit tight because, at the end of the
season, he will become a free agent and can negotiate his own deal. As a
result, he informs the management of his club he does not wish to move
and will see out his contract.
On paper, Real Garthamlock have a problem; in reality, is it such a
problem? If Inter and Real co-operate, the premier club would make it
clear to the player they are only interested in purchasing him at that
time and if he opts not to sign, his chance has gone. Going back to my
original point, that would probably be sufficient to ensure the player
will see things differently.
If, however, Mr Smith is stubborn and says that, irrespective of the
views of both clubs, he will continue with Garthamlock until the end of
the season, Garthamlock have the option to drop him from their first XI
and confine him to the reserves for the rest of the season, which would
effectively take him out of the shop window and ensure, come the
season's end, he would not get the big money.
In that situation, of course, Real Garthamlock will be deprived of his
services but they may well consider, in the circumstances, this is a
risk worth taking.
I think you may find that players, when faced with that situation,
will play ball with the clubs, as a result of which Real Garthamlock
will get their transfer fee on the basis the player is moving during his
period of contract, and Inter Milanda will be happy because they have
secured a star striker who they, in turn, may sell in similar
circumstances two or three years down the line.
Co-operation is the name of the game but co-operation, coupled with
the lure of a life in the limelight, should ensure clubs will continue
to earn revenue from transfers. It might become a little more difficult
but, where there's a will, there's a way.

THE Post Office yesterday won a High Court injunction effectively
banning the Communications Workers Union from staging more one-day
strikes tomorrow in protest at the closure of Crown Post Offices.
Welcomed by management as a ''victory for the customers'', the ruling,
that the CWU calls off the action by 11am today, was denounced by the
union, which maintained it would serve to strengthen its campaign
against ''back-door privatisation''.
Although not directly covered by the High Court injunction, action
targeted on Strathclyde is also expected to be lifted. A CWU spokesman
confirmed last night that the union would be abandoning its proposed
action north of the Border which was to have been the subject of a
separate hearing in the Court of Session today.
The Post Office had argued that the CWU strike-ballot mandates were
about 10 months old and therefore out of date and that a lot had changed
during that period. The issue of how long a strike mandate remains
effective had not been tested before and the full judgment could well
become important case law.
While expected to call off the stoppages planned tomorrow at around
250 Crown POs in Glasgow, Liverpool, Northern Ireland, and London in
order to comply with the injunction, the CWU will procede with strikes
at three branches -- Croydon and Sutton in London, Warrington, and
Northern Ireland (West) -- where strike ballots were held last month.
A defiant Mr Alan Johnson, CWU joint general secretary, said the court
ruling would ''incense staff and public and strengthen the campaign''.
Meanwhile, a series of crippling strikes on London's Underground
loomed last night after members of the train drivers' union Aslef
overturned their negotiators' recommendation to accept a 3% final pay
offer. The Aslef executive subsequently decided to call a ballot on a
series of one-day strikes.
The Rail, Maritime, and Transport Union, which called off a 48-hour
stoppage due to have begun yesterday after the High Court queried its
strike mandate, is already due to reballot underground staff in support
of a 6% demand.

Doctors were able to take them off ventilators which had been helping

They are still being fed artificially and could remain on the

Surgeons have said nothing further about their chances of performing

<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT slice of superstar Sting's multi-million pound fortune
was spent behind his back on supporting a chain of curry houses in
London and Australia, a court was told yesterday.
The performer's former chartered accountant, Mr Keith Moore, who is
accused of stealing #6m from the rock star, was also said to have
siphoned off other large sums earned by Sting's chart-topping successes
and acting career.
Southwark Crown Court was told the money was ploughed into a series of
largely unsuccessful ventures, as well as twice being used to stave off
imminent bankruptcy for the 51-year-old financial adviser. Some was even
lost to the ill-fated Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Mr Neill Stewart, prosecuting, said Sting, referred to frequently by
his real name of Gordon Matthew Sumner, did not realise what was going
on, probably because he was earning so much and was so busy.
He told the jury of six men and six women that bankers Coutts and
Company had to bear some of the responsibility for what happened.
They wrongly transferred millions of pounds of the star's cash to an
account controlled by Mr Moore without Sting's specific authority.
Mr Moore, of Alder Lodge, Stevenage Road, Fulham, south-west London,
has pleaded not guilty to 15 sample charges of theft, involving more
than #3.7m, between August 1988 and July 1992.
Nine involve sums of money said to have been illegally stolen from
Sting's personal accounts, while the remainder concern further sums
allegedly taken from the performer's company Steerpike (Overseas) Ltd.
The court heard that as Sting chalked up one career success after
another, both he and his now disbanded group Police came to rely on Mr
Moore's professional skill and integrity. Their financial affairs
mushroomed in complexity.
As the money flooded in from all over the world, Mr Moore abused the
considerable trust that had been placed in him, Mr Stewart claimed.
Detailing some of the illegal transactions, he told the court that
#4.8m of the #6m allegedly stolen was transferred from Coutts, where
Sting's company Steerpike had an account.
It went to a Royal Bank of Scotland account, controlled by the
accountant.
The barrister alleged Mr Moore managed to get Sting to authorise the
first of a series of transactions from Coutts with an involved
explanation as to why it was necessary. Wholesale movements of money
followed.
''It is the prosecution's case that Mr Moore was not authorised to
make those transfers and indeed that the bank, Coutts, did not hold any
mandate permitting them to act on his instructions when they executed
the instructions that he gave them,'' he said.
Mr Stewart told the court Sting never suspected what was happening.
''That may be an indication of two things -- how much money he had
over the years and just how preoccupied he was with other things,'' he
said.
Detailing what happened to some of Sting's money, he said nearly #3m
ended up in an account for one of Mr Moore's companies, Gramelda
Investments Ltd.
Nearly #1m of that was later diverted to Indian restaurateur Mr Safdar
Samarkandi.
Much of that sum went on running his restaurant called The Bombay
Bicycle Club, near London's Wandsworth Common, as well as on a chain of
curry houses in Australia.
Most of that investment disappeared when the Australian economy ''took
a nosedive''.
Mr Stewart said #500,000 went to Mr Moore's business, Moore Sloane &amp;
Co, based in Notting Hill, west London.
He alleged another #250,000 went to other accounts controlled by the
partnership, while #600,000 was ploughed into a computer company, nearly
#50,000 to Mr Moore himself or interests connected with him, and #20,000
on purchasing a leasehold interest in Earls Court.
A sum of #100,000 was sent to solicitors acting for Mr Moore in
connection with another of his investments, Mr Stewart alleged.
The trial was adjourned until today, when the barrister will continue
his opening address.
Sting is expected to start his evidence this afternoon and remain in
the witness box for up to four days.

THE family home of the late Tory MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn is for sale
for around #500,000.
His widow Lady Sam Fairbairn has decided to sell Fordell Castle near
Dunfermline because its upkeep is too much for one person.
Selling agents Savills said they expected ''massive interest'' in the
property from all over the world.
Savills said the flamboyant Sir Nicholas bought the castle as a ruin
in 1961. He claimed it cost #100 but it is believed it was a #10,000
wedding present from his first wife's mother, Lady Reay.
Yesterday, Lady Fairbairn met Mr Jamie Macnab of Savills at the
thirteenth-century castle in Fife to complete arrangements for marketing
the property.
Sir Nicholas' renovation of the castle was described as ''a labour of
love'' by those who knew him. The castle was a ruin when he moved in,
with five acres of rough ground around it.
He worked on the building, initially with his first wife, Elizabeth,
and latterly with his second wife Lady Sam.
Sir Nicholas bought 70 acres of surrounding woodland to safeguard the
property's privacy and seclusion.
The castle, four miles from the Forth Road Bridge, dates back to 1210
when it belonged to a Flemish family who were granted the lands for
fighting in the fifth Crusade.
The three-acre walled gardens, which Sir Nicholas opened to the
publicannually in aid of Scotland's Garden Scheme, includes a summer
house, an aviary, an artist's studio, and, at the end of the garden, a
small private chapel where Sir Nicholas married Lady Sam.

CHIEF officers at Western Isles Islands Council are to get pay rises
of up to #10,000 a year.
Last night, a pensioner who led a successful campaign against the
level of the council tax two years ago called for islanders to take to
the streets to protest.
The islands council yesterday claimed the increases for the 39 top
officers were over three years and will average out at #4000 each. They
will cost the islands authority about #180,000 a year.
The biggest rise goes to the acting director of social work, Mr
Malcolm Smith, who will get a rise of almost #10,000 a year.
His salary will leap from #49,000 to #59,000, overtaking the chief
executive, Mr Brian Stewart, who remains on #58,000 as his salary is not
linked with the rises.
Mr George Maciver, 74, a retired caravan park operator from Tong, near
Stornoway, said it was ''shameful'' that pensioners' home-helps were, in
many cases, cut back to just 30 minutes a day while the top officer was
getting such a big rise.
He said: ''People here are fed up with this council's carry on. They
are stuffing their own pockets while we have to go without street
lighting and pavements.''
The council's personnel sub-committee was persuaded that a clear-out
of senior officers had saved the council #250,000, which would pay for
the increases which come into effect on October 1.
The rises come as concern grows from some members about the officers'
role.
Over the last year, the council's administration officers,
particularly, have been accused of over-stepping the mark in the use of
their powers.
Councillors were unhappy when officers of that department withheld
from members an environmental report on the effects of the Lingerbay
Quarry and at administration director Robert Barnett's intervention last
week to disallow a bid to make the convener and vice-convener stand for
annual election.
Council spokesman Nigel Scott said the officers' rises seem
substantial now because they were making up for increases they should
have had over the last three years.
''It was agreed in 1992 to delay any rises then in the light of the
losses occurred in the BCCI crash and its aftermath,'' he said.
Chief executive Brian Stewart, defended the increases as necessary to
offer a competitive salary in a market where competition is fierce.
He said the increases were funded through savings achieved by
extensive ''management restructuring''.
A councillor, who did not want to be named, said last night: ''These
rises will focus our minds on getting rid of more of the paid staff.''

THE brain drain of Scottish graduates in the 'Eighties is being
reversed but many are still unable to find work at home, according to a
report.
The number of graduates finding jobs in Scotland has increased sharply
over the past two years, from 4100 in 1992 to 5400 in 1994, a rise of
32%.
Scottish Enterprise said the study provides further evidence that
Scottish businesses are not only absorbing more highly qualified people
but are shaking off the shackles of the 1992 recession.
However, the Graduate Employment in Scotland report for 1983-94 also
reveals that around 17,000 graduates emerged from Scottish institutions
last year -- compared to 11,000 in 1983. That suggests almost two in
three cannot expect to find work on graduating.
Mr Bob Downes, Scottish Enterprise director of industry and skills,
confirmed that traditional large recruiters of graduates have already
reached their limits, according to present indications.
The main source of new opportunities appears to be small and
medium-sized businesses which recognise the value of a highly qualified
workforce.
Mr Downes said there was still some way to go before there was a full
recovery but argued the report proved the Scottish labour market had
been remarkably successful in absorbing more graduates.
Ms Barbara Graham, convener of the Scottish Graduates Careers
Programme, said that it was making an important contribution to
developing career opportunities within the Scottish economy.
She added: ''It is vital for Scotland's future that it should make
full use of the talent produced by its universities and colleges.''

THE quality of political debate and claims that both the Scottish
press and London-based broadcasters are parochial in their outlook were
among issues debated last night at Setting the Political Agenda, a
discussion held by BBC Radio 4's Today Programme in association with The
Herald.
In Glasgow, an audience of 500 argued the pros and cons with a panel
consisting of The Herald's economics editor Alf Young, Liberal
Democrats' economic affairs spokesman Malcolm Bruce, Herald columnist
and BBC radio broadcaster Ruth Wishart, and Today Programme editor Roger
Mosey, chaired by James Naughtie, one of the programme's presenters.
Opening the debate on whether the Scottish dimension was fully
appreciated by national broadcasters, Mr Bruce said: ''Very often there
is a tendency for the view from London to be that Scotland is a Labour
stronghold with a few Nationalists and a few representatives of a
defeated Government, whereas pluralism is alive and kicking.''
Mr Young, warning that the political debate had become trite and
trivial and ''feart'' of the big issues, said: ''Should we be giving
politicians such a big diet of party politics through the media in the
first place, if people are increasingly being turned off politics?''
On the subject of the Scottish dimension of news coverage, Ms Wishart
said she believed there was a ''whole range of issues which matter in
Scotland and get peripheral coverage''.
''On the other hand, there is a news agenda in Scotland which is not
going to excite masses south of the border but it matters very much to
us,'' she added, citing the proposed closure of the Fort William sleeper
as an example.
To charges that the Scottish quality press was too parochial, Mr Young
said it was a fair accusation but that a newspaper had to look after its
community's interests, while still giving a wider agenda.

DOCTORS will land a new blow on boxing next month with research
demonstrating that amateurs as well as professionals suffer brain damage
through the sport.
Studies carried out on soldiers and sailors showed that those who
boxed had higher levels of impairment than those who participated in
other sports.
Although the link between the professional game and punch-drunk
syndrome (dementia pugilistica) has been established for more than 25
years -- with features common to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases --
controversy has remained over the long-term effects at amateur level.
The research, which will appear in October's Journal of Neurology,
Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, was carried out by staff at the Royal Navy
Hospital and the Institute of Naval Medicine in Gosport, Hampshire.
Two sets of tests were carried out on a group of servicemen aged 18-30
who took part in amateur bouts, comparing their performances with a
group of non-boxing servicemen.

The competition -- a #2-a-time entry to a postcard quiz on Lanark Blue
-- will be launched at the British Cheesemakers' Awards tomorrow
morning.
Another of Lanark Blue's patrons is the Prince of Wales, who has
supported the campaign.
Yesterday, organisers said that the judges would include TV food
specialist Derek Cooper, broadcaster and writer Henrietta Green, and
Lord Pearson of Rannoch, who argued the cause of Lanark Blue in the
House of Lords.
Prizes donated so far include a weekend at Gleneagles Hotel, a break
at a top hotel in northern France, and chances to dine out in some of
Britain's gourmet restaurants.
A leaflet released yesterday by Friends of Lanark Blue in London
outlined the case against last year's batch of impounded cheese, made by
Humphrey Errington at his Walston Braehead Farm near Dunsyre in
Lanarkshire.
The leaflet says that, if Mr Errington loses his case at Lanark
Sheriff Court, ''Lanark Blue will be no more''.

A YOUTH who viciously attacked a doctor was ordered at the High Court
in Glasgow yesterday to be detained for five years.
Dr Luigi Martini, 26, will be scarred for life after being slashed
across the forehead by Peter Reilly, 19.
Mr Michael O'Grady, prosecuting, said Dr Martini was taken to Victoria
Infirmary, Glasgow, where he underwent emergency surgery. He also had
stab wounds to his back, shoulder, and abdomen.
Reilly, of Brand Street, Cessnock, Glasgow, admitted assaulting the
doctor to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement and stealing his
jacket and wallet in the city's Rouken Glen Park.
George Colville, 19, of Kyleakin Road, Arden, Glasgow, who admitted
punching the doctor twice, was sentenced to six months detention.
Stephen Brammer, 20, of Kilvaxter Drive, Arden, who admitted a breach
of the peace in the park was admonished.
Mr O'Grady said Dr Martini worked for a pharmaceutical company and had
booked into the McDonald Hotel near the park.
He was joined by Dr Jonathan Embleton and they decided to go for a
meal in a restaurant in Rouken Glen Park. Just inside the park, Brammer
and Reilly approached and asked for the time.
The doctors told them, walked on, and ignored shouts.
Dr Martini heard footsteps running, turned, and, when he saw Brammer,
kicked the youth, who fell. Both doctors felt threatened, ran away, and
veered off in different directions.
Colville approached from another direction, seized Dr Martini and
punched him twice on the head. Reilly then carried out the knife attack.

THE teenage girls who went on holiday to Tenerife with fantasy
schoolboy Brandon Lee have told their parents how he inadvertently blew
his cover during a poolside chat.
The true story of how the 32-year-old confessed to spending a year at
Bearsden Academy as a schoolboy emerged yesterday, as the media hunt to
find him intensified.
Tabloid journalists continued to camp outside the Bearsden home of his
mother, offering significant sums of money if her son, now known to be
Mr Brian MacKinnon, told his story of how he pretended to be a teenager
and returned to the school he had left 13 years previously.
Even American television network ABC flew a crew to Glasgow yesterday
to interview Bearsden Academy's rector, Mr Norman MacLeod, about the
bizarre tale.
So far Mr MacKinnon has not surfaced, although he had told people
before the story broke that he was going to Germany for a week. Whether
that was the truth or another piece of his fantasy life remains to be
seen.
Dundee University, where Mr MacKinnon spent the last year as Brandon
Lee, has been inundated with inquiries from school-leavers anxious to
take his place in medical school, on the assumption that he will not be
allowed back now that his deception has been revealed.
No final decision has yet been taken by the university, but it is
unlikely that he will be allowed to continue the course after duping
officials about his age. Although no crime has been committed,
university authorities are unhappy about someone who is obviously such
an accomplished liar becoming a doctor.
Inquiries by The Herald have uncovered how his sham existence was
finally exposed. Contrary to earlier reports, he was not involved in a
brawl during a holiday on the Spanish island of Tenerife last month.
He had travelled with teenagers Sheila Louden and Gillian McCallum,
with whom he had attended Bearsden Academy as Brandon Lee. They were
stunned when, during a poolside chat, he admitted he was 32, and not the
teenager they had assumed.
The revelation began to worry the girls. They suggested he should go
home a couple of days early, which he did. When one of the other girls
on the holiday, Nicola Walker, returned home she told her parents about
the episode and they contacted the rector, Mr MacLeod.
Unable to believe it at first, he checked Mr MacKinnon's original
school file from 13 years earlier, saw the resemblance, and invited the
former pupil into the school to discuss the matter.
Even then, Mr MacKinnon was unwilling to admit his deceit, and said he
would return following a trip to Germany with proof of his identity. Mr
MacLeod was unconvinced and passed his findings on to Strathclyde
region's education department.
He was willing to give Mr MacKinnon until next week to own up before
writing to Dundee University explaining the position. But before then
the story broke.
At Dundee University yesterday, young people keen to become doctors
swamped the switchboard asking to take his place.
As The Herald revealed yesterday, Mr MacKinnon was previously a
drop-out from a medical degree course at Glasgow University.
A Dundee University official said: ''Had we known Mr MacKinnon was a
drop-out from another medical degree course, he would not have been
considered for a place.
''There is intense pressure from hundreds of applicants for the 127
first-year medical school places we have available each year,'' she
added.
''Since this story about Brandon Lee has appeared in the newspapers we
have been inundated by callers to our admissions office. They are saying
that if he is out they would like his place. We have given him a week to
make his case.''
University officials will consider whether or not Mr MacKinnon
falsified documents in order to gain admission to the medical course.
Many of this week's young callers have expressed the feeling that they
were cheated out of their rightful places on the course.
In order to fulfil his ambition of becoming a doctor, Mr MacKinnon
hatched a plan to return to school and resit university entrance exams.
He was aware that most medical schools would not consider anyone over
the age of 30 for a place.
Although the story has brought a degree of attention which Bearsden
Acadamy might have wished to escape, Mr MacLeod is still concerned for
the man he knew as Brandon Lee, and would like to talk to him.
There is also a queue of newspapers waiting in line.

BRITISH Rail yesterday abandoned any legal moves to axe the Fort
William-London sleeper service.
It will not exercise a right to appeal to the House of Lords against
an interdict granted to Highland Regional Council at the Court of
Session in May.
The formal announcement comes after a modified sleeper service was
included in the seven-year Passenger Service Requirement for the
ScotRail network by franchising director Roger Salmon last week.
Highland region's convener, Mr Duncan McPherson, said yesterday he had
assured ScotRail earlier this week that the council would not go back to
court to say there was a breach in the interdict through reducing the
level of service.
Under the deal, the number of sleeper carriages will be cut and linked
to other services out of Edinburgh, reducing subsidies from #2.3m to
#500,000 a year.
Meanwhile, a senior BR official admitted yesterday that revenues would
be down. Dr Paul King, managing director of BR's North and West
Passenger Group, said revenue over the summer had been ''poor'' and
cross-country services were 15% down on their budget -- although he said
figures were confidential.
He also blamed two days of rail strikes which had cost the railways
#15m in lost fares and cancelled journeys.

THE misery of asthma could be virtually eradicated within six months
without the aid of drugs, scientists claimed yesterday.
It is known that house dust mites are the primary cause of asthma but
getting rid of them has proved difficult.
Now a small device has been developed to wipe out the mites and blow
their irritant dung pellets out of the house.
Dr John Maunder, director of the Medical Entomology Centre at
Cambridge University, said: ''From time to time we test the different
methods people come up with for dealing with asthma. Most of them are
not much good but, in this case, the results were so astounding it
shocked us.
''Sufferers who fit this device should find their symptoms relieved
within six months. How complete their remission is depends on what
happens in the rest of their lives. But they will no longer have asthma
attacks and many of them will no longer have symptoms.''
The device has two fans. One blows out air containing dust mite
pellets. The other draws fresh air in.
A heat exchanger warms the incoming air so that humidity is kept low.
Dust mites cannot survive in dry conditions.
Dr Maunder tested the device, developed by ADM Indux Ltd of Bradford,
using laboratory-grown dust mites.
''We were able to get air quality that was astoundingly good,'' he
said. ''All the mites died.''
Asthma kills more than 2000 people a year in Britain and runs up a
health service bill of #550m.

<HEADLINE>Oil deal at the Falklands has Menem in full flow</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976273793</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem yesterday said he would meet Mr Major
for talks in New York later this month, as a row broke out over his
claim that a new oil deal advances Argentina's claim to the Falklands.
If the meeting took place it would be the first between the two
countries' leaders since the 1982 Falklands war. No 10 says no meeting
is planned.
But Mr Menem told Argentine radio: ''During the celebrations of the
50th anniversary of the United Nations, I will meet with the Prime
Minister of England to talk about our relations -- to iron out any
differences that may have emerged in recent times.''
His announcement follows a bilateral deal on oil exploration around
the Falklands.
The Foreign Office insisted that there was no question of any
surrender of British sovereignty under the deal.
But Mr Menem hailed it as the first real legal step forward in the
campaign to regain the islands.
The agreement, due to be formally signed next week, covers UK and
Argentine co-operation over oil exploration and exploitation in the
South-west Atlantic.
The deal gives the Falkland Islands the right to license oil
extraction without Argentine harassment.
The Foreign Office said in a statement: ''The agreement specifically
states that nothing in it shall be interpreted as a change in the
British position on sovereignty.''
But Mr Menem told an Argentinian radio station: ''It is the best
achievement in 163 years, since our islands were usurped in 1833.''

THE cross-Channel ferry Stena Challenger, which ran aground outside
Calais, arrived in the port at 10pm last night, after a tug succeeded in
pulling her off a sandbank at the second attempt.
The ferry became stranded on Tuesday night but was pulled clear at 8pm
last night, about 55 minutes before high tide.
She eventually arrived 25hours after leaving Dover at the French port.
The 245 passengers and crew had remained on board throughout the day.
Initially a spokesman for Stena Sealink said the ferry would dock
about 9pm but this was later revised.
The spokesman added however that the ferry arrived at the port
terminal ''under her own steam''.
A full inquiry into the incident is expected to begin today.
After the ferry docked, one of the passengers, Glasgow-born Australian
Alec Smith, wheelchair bound by a leg injury, told how he tipped out of
his wheelchair at the moment the ferry ran aground.
Mr Smith, 66, travelling with wife Dale, said: ''I felt the bump and
then I hit my neck. Everybody was very kind, they just lifted me back
into the chair which had gone over backwards. I was quite dizzy but then
things were OK.''
Asked how he spent his time on board the stranded ferry, Mr Smith
said: ''I spent much of the time reading and I wouldn't describe it as
an ordeal, it was just a bit of a nuisance.''
The ferry company offered hotel accommodation at the port for all the
passengers involved in the stranding.

THE 172 passengers on the stricken Stena Challenger finally rolled off
their roll-on Channel ferry last night -- 25 hours late but grateful to
have set foot on dry land.
The stricken vessel finally docked at Calais at just after10 pm, two
hours after a solitary tug boat used the high tide to pull it from the
sandbank where it had been firmly lodged.
It may have been Calais but the spirit was that of Dunkirk as the
mostly British passengers and 73 crew members endured their long wait,
so near and yet so far from land.
They told tales of card games, joke sessions and bouts of endless TV
-- anything to ease the boredom of life not quite afloat.
Some were past anger and just keen to start their holidays, others
like the lorry drivers on board were keen to hit the road after losing a
day.
But there was also the woman who now feared she had missed her
father's funeral in Poland.
The beached giant, which became stranded on Tuesday night, was pulled
clear at the second attempt. The 245 marooned people had been able to
wave at curious locals observing it all from the beach.
The captain of the ill-fated ship was set to continue in his job while
an inquiry looks into why the Challenger ran aground, the company said
last night.
Mr Gareth Cooper, managing director of Stena Sealink, said: ''He's not
likely to be suspended. The first thing we need to establish is if there
was any negligence in his part but we don't prejudge. We need to see
what happened.''

THE Bank of Scotland yesterday surprised the City by announcing plans
to buy a major Australian bank for #235m.
The bank is purchasing a majority stake in the Bank of Western
Australia (BankWest), which is being privatised by the state government.
The Bank of Scotland, which is celebrating its 300th anniversary this
year, sees BankWest as a stepping stone to the high-growth ''tiger''
economies of south-east Asia.
The acquisition is by far the biggest by the Bank of Scotland since it
took over the British Linen Bank in 1971.
Bank of Scotland shares lost 7p to 246p amid concerns over the poor
track record of UK banks in relation to overseas acquisitions. However,
the bank has been pleased with the performance of its Countrywide
Banking Corporation subsidiary in New Zealand.
Commenting on the acquisition, Bank of Scotland governor Sir Bruce
Pattullo said: ''There are undoubtedly opportunities for growth in the
business, both in the bank's own region of Western Australia and wider
afield.''
The proposed BankWest acquisition is the latest in a series of major
takeover moves by Scottish-based companies, following hard on the heels
of ScottishPower's #1100m bid for Chester-based electricity distributor
Manweb and Scottish &amp; Newcastle's #425m purchase of Courage from Fosters
Brewing Group of Australia.

A TWELVE months' delay on income tax cuts was signalled by Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke in a forthright speech yesterday on the state of the
economy.
He declared in the run-up to the Tory party conference next month and
his November 28 Budget that he will not reduce taxes ''to win votes
regardless of the economic cost''.
Any leeway he can arrange will be decided by his success in cutting
state borrowing and spending in the next few weeks. Tax relief is now
more likely to be given as incentives to business, to hard-pressed
households and families, and to the Prime Minister's desire to abolish
inheritance tax.
Mr Clarke yesterday, in his first major economic speech since May,
emphasised that state borrowing still worried him; the most recent
figures this week indicate that the Treasury might miss its target this
year. Mr Clarke stated: ''Controlling public borrowing remains my number
one priority. Nobody should assume that tax cuts are safely in the
bag.''
The profit returns of British industry are good and corporation tax
receipts due to be assessed next month should be up, perhaps
sufficiently to rescue the public borrowing target. If so, a reduction
in corporation tax as a further incentive to industry may be on the
cards for November 28.
However, for Tories demanding a straight cut in income tax to restore
their political fortunes, Budget disappointment seems highly likely. The
Chancellor, addressing the Engineering Employers' Federation, claimed
that public finances are now on a sound footing and that he would not
undermine this situation for purely political reasons.
''I do not intend to throw away these hard fought for gains by playing
fast and loose with the public finances,'' he said.
''That would not only be bad economics, it would be bad politics as
well. The majority of the public always likes tax cuts. But the public
only want tax cuts that will last. The public expect from the Government
tax cuts that do not put the steady growth we are currently seeking at
risk.
''Those are the only sort of tax cuts that I'm interested in. Whether
I can make them or not depends on the control of public spending without
damaging key public services.''
He pointed out that #45,000m had already been slashed from public
spending projections in the last two Budgets and that further cuts would
be difficult to find.
Mr Clarke's stand on inflation was equally resolute.
He rejected the notion put forward by some economists in the City that
the recent slowdown in economic growth in the UK, highlighted by the
weakness of consumer spending, signalled a descent back into recession.
It had been caused by weaker expansion in the world economy and
interest rate rises designed to check excessive growth and keep
inflation under control and was not a cause for concern.
No recovery ever proceeded at a constant rate of growth and it would
be surprising if there was not more variation in the pace of expansion
as it continued, said Mr Clarke.
The Chancellor's judgment appears to be that the public will not
applaud the Tories for a 1p in the pound cut this autumn in the standard
rate of tax. Also, Tory motions from the party activists for their
conference on October 10 are pressing for tax relief, but by no means a
simple reduction in the standard rate.
The motion chosen for the Chancellor's debate at the conference from
the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association gives Mr Clarke the
room for manoeuvre that he requires. It applauds export-led,
non-inflationary, economic growth and falling unemployment and merely
requires reconfirmation of the commitment to low taxation coupled with
sound public finances.
The message is clear -- the Chancellor cannot deliver income tax cuts
this year, despite the fact that a General Election could be forced on
the Prime Minister next year. Government political strategy is still
firmly based on the prospect of a General Election in 1997 when more
dramatic tax relief may be forthcoming.
The Chancellor went out of his way to praise Mr Eddie George, Governor
of the Bank of England, with whom he has been disputing over the last
four months concerning interest rates. The Governor has been pressing
for an increase and the Chancellor has been resisting it in the full
glare of publicity.
Mr Clarke said yesterday: ''I am fortunate in having the advice of an
outstanding professional Governor of the Bank of England. I like him as
a man and I value his advice very highly. We both believe that
permanently low inflation provides the basis for growth to be sustained
and the best help we can provide for British businesses.''
Simplistic press reports which portayed them in some titanic struggle
-- a kind of economic Sumo wrestling contest -- were wide of the mark.
The only tensions between him and the governor arose when it was
thought that one of them was ''hogging the ash tray'', said Mr Clarke.
There is to be no tinkering with inflation to attract short- term
political popularity.

THE senior SNP activist whose outspoken attacks on pro-Union
politicians brought an accusation from Labour that his words fuelled
extremists was unrepentant yesterday.
Councillor Jim Mitchell called for a more campaigning style of SNP
leadership embracing civil disobedience, telling delegates at the
party's annual conference in Perth that ''sound bites would never
liberate Scotland''.
He repeated his claim that Labour and Conservative career politicians
were ''tartan Uncle Toms and traitors to Scotland'' which had brought an
accusation from Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, in an
internal memo to Labour MPs, that such talk ''by SNP top brass
undoubtedly fuels the crazy fringe''.
Mr Robertson, in the memo drawn up for a meeting to discuss his
party's autumn campaign, had pointed out that a number of Labour
politicians had received letter bombs and death threats, which
represented ''the darker side of nationalism''.
His memo added: ''The SNP publicly stands back from these extremists
but the fact is that the fringe exists and feeds on the rhetoric and
prejudices of some prominent Nationalists.''
However, Councillor Mitchell said this only showed that he had touched
a raw nerve and insisted that, by definition, Scots who put the interest
of Westminster before that of their own country were traitors.
The leaking of the memo has been seen as a crude attempt by Labour to
deflect attention from the start of the SNP conference and leading
Nationalists queued up yesterday to ridicule a smear which they said
showed Labour were losing the arguments.
To applause from delegates at the conference, national secretary
Alasdair Morgan said: ''George Robertson's smear tactics against the SNP
demean the democratic process and impress no-one. It is the mark of a
frightened man, badly rattled by the SNP's success, that he prefers to
indulge in such tactics rather than deal with the arguments fairly and
squarely.''
Party leader Alex Salmond pointed out that he and other prominent
Nationalists had also been victims of bomb hoaxes and threats but had
never sought to pin the blame on the Labour Party leadership.
He added: ''The SNP are now in a strong second place in Scottish
politics, challenging Labour hard as the Blair bubble bursts.
''We have closed the gap with Labour by eight points in two months.
Their panicky and absurd response to the SNP speaks volumes for their
fear of our electoral challenge.''
Perth and Kinross MP Roseanna Cunningham pointed out that, during her
by-election campaign earlier this year, she had been vilified as a nazi,
a republican, and ''screaming banshee'' during an appallingly negative
campaign. ''These tactics impressed the public not one whit and will not
impress them this time round.''
It was during a debate on cutbacks in health spending as a result of
the cut in Scotland's share of UK spending that Councillor Mitchell made
his plea for a more campaigning style.
He said the resolution criticising the cut in Scotland's share from
11.76% to 10.66% was symptomatic of the way Scotland was being treated.
''But when are we going to take more direct action to do something
about it?'' he asked the conference. ''We are in danger of becoming part
of the 'isn't it terrible' brigade, wringing our hands, sometimes along
with the Unionists, when we see attacks on the NHS and a destruction of
our industrial base.''
He said the party should consider direct action such as sit-ins,
demonstrations, and high-profile campaigns to protect their services.
''That will make it clear that we are made of more than simply fancy
sound bites. We know that, without independence, Scotland is going down
the tubes, but we need a campaigning zeal in this party, a new spirit, a
determination to take on the Unionists.''
He said they should be concentrating their fire power on those Scots
in unionist parties who betray their own people to advance their
careers. ''Let us determine to step up the struggle against the British
state.''
Councillor Mitchell stressed afterwards that he was not criticising
Alex Salmond, who is an intelligent politician doing a good job, but
that job should be complemented by grass- roots campaigning.
Mr Salmond responded to the remarks from his fellow member of the
national executive committee by saying it was a ''speech from the
heart''. He pointed out that the party has advocated civil disobedience
in the past but this had to be targeted on very specific issues.

CASH-strapped councils could save up to #25m a year if they grasped
the nettle of school closures, the Accounts Commission for Scotland says
today.
The local authorities' financial watchdog identifies 13 secondary and
106 primaries which, it says, could be readily closed because they are
less than 60% full and there are adequate local alternatives for pupils.
The commission declines to identify the schools, but the vast majority
will be in Strathclyde region, which has experienced dramatic falls in
its population.
Secondaries such as St Gerard's and John Bosco in Glasgow are likely
to figure on the list. Glasgow alone has a 61% occupancy rate in its
primaries, falling to 57% in its secondaries.
The City of Glasgow Council will assume responsibility for education
in April and its director of education, Mr Ken Corsar, said yesterday
that the commission's findings did not come as a surprise.
''The new council will have to face up to its responsibilities in
terms of surplus places,'' he said.
No other Scottish council has so many surplus places which are
removable, and the council is about to introduce new measures to
determine closures and mergers.
These include examining rolls, local alternatives, course choices in
secondaries, and maintenance costs. The new criteria would be tested
against schools in separate areas to involve local communities.
''There will be a phased consultation and rationalisation,'' Mr Corsar
said. Both he and Strathclyde region's director of education, Mr Frank
Pignatelli, welcomed the independent commission's commitment to press
the Government for extra cash to help councils sweeten the pill of
school closures.
It says the Scottish Office should extend ''spend to save'' schemes to
rationalisation programmes, with schools receiving pupils from nearby
establishments to be closed being given additional funding to improve
their facilities.
Mr Bob Black, the controller of audit, said: ''Councils will face a
very difficult financial situation. Their revenue budgets will be tight
and possibly capped, and their capital budgets will be much smaller than
those of the old regional councils.''
''They will find it difficult to make resources available in receiving
schools, so we would encourage partnerships to target spend to save
schemes on such schools so that they could offer excellent education
from day one.''
Mr Pignatelli said: ''Putting more money into receiving schools would
be very helpful to authorities. Rationalisation will be a key issue for
the new councils because they will be under so much pressure
financially.''
The report shows that 76% of secondaries in Strathclyde are less than
60% full, followed by Lothian at 7% and Tayside at 5%.
Lothian reduced its secondary school capacity by 10% last year when it
closed three schools. It will not return to the issue in what remains of
its lifetime.
Tayside said six of its 31 secondaries were less than 60% occupied,
but it declined to identify them for fear of raising parental and
teacher anxiety.

UEFA last night kicked Dynamo Kiev out of European competitions for
two years after finding that the Ukrainian club had tried to bribe a
Spanish referee to fix last week's Champions' League match against
Panathinaikos of Greece.
The control and disciplinary commission of European football's
governing body ruled that Dynamo officials had attempted to bribe
referee Antonio Lopez Nieto.
The Ukrainians won the group A game 1-0 with a goal from Vitaly
Kosovsky in the 61st minute.
After hearing testimony from Lopez Nieto and top Dynamo officials, the
commission decided to exclude Kiev from the rest of this season's
Champions' League and the next two seasons of European competitions.
In addition, club officials Vasyl Babychuk and Igor Sourkis were
banned for life from involvement in any UEFA-related events.
UEFA spokesman Salvatore Cucu did not specify how much Dynamo had
offered to pay Lopez Nieto or reveal any other details and the referee
left the hearing without speaking to reporters.
Cucu said Dynamo had until midnight on Saturday to appeal against the
ruling.
UEFA's executive committee will meet today to discuss the situation
and determine which team replaces Dynamo.
''In a situation like this, it is not clear in the statutes who should
be the replacement,'' said UEFA president Lennart Johansson. ''We have
to find a replacement.''
Kiev beat Aalborg 4-1 on aggregate in the preliminary round, so the
Danish side must be favourites to take the Ukrainians' place.
The hearing was conducted on the sidelines of a two-day conference in
Porto to determine the confederation's general policy for the next
century.
