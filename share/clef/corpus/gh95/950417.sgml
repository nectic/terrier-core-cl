THE premier division championship has been won again and the targets
have been set for the next three seasons by the demanding Ibrox support
who want their club to take over the place presently held by Celtic in
the record books, writes Ken Gallacher.
Ten in a row is what the Rangers' legions want. Even more so after
this latest triumph which makes the once seemingly impossible dream of
catching up with, or even going beyond that Celtic record a more
tangible prospect.
Yesterday, Glasgow bookmaker Davie McAllister announced that he was
quoting the Ibrox side at 3-1 on to win next season's title, and for the
super-confident among the Ibrox fans he has them at evens to equal
Celtic's record and 6-4 to reach the record tenth win.
That, of course, is the kind of forecasts of success which helped
convince Brian Laudrup to join the Glasgow club last summer. Now, after
his first taste of a title with Rangers, Laudrup has committed his
long-term future to them.
The great Dane has no interest in pursuing his career elsewhere and
after the 3-1 win over Hibs on Sunday he was in the mood to make some
cautious forecasts of his own.
He believes, for instance, that Rangers will be able to make a better
impact on the European Champions' League in the coming season.
He admitted: ''I felt last season when the draw was made for the
preliminary round of the tournament that we could find ourselves in
difficulties against AEK Athens.
''We had new players settling in and the game came around too quickly
for us. If it had come some weeks later then I believe we could have won
and gone into the Champions' League.
''That is what we hope to do in the new season. If we have to play in
the preliminary round once more then we must get over that first hurdle.
If we do that then I believe we can do well in the League games.
''The club are talking about bringing in new players and we have a
good squad here already, so if there are team strengthening moves in the
summer we could be in a better position than we were last season when we
had to face the Greeks.''
There remains the possibility, of course, that Rangers could escape
the preliminary round altogether under the enormously complicated
seeding system used by UEFA.
If that were to be the case then the Scottish champions would go
straight into one of the Leagues and straight into the huge financial
rewards that go with these games. They would be guaranteed three home
games, with sell-out Ibrox gates to add to the television fees and the
cash from the various sponsors.
The re-structuring of the team has been ongoing throughout this
season. As skipper Richard Gough observed: ''Look at the team which beat
Hibs and then look back at the side which played in Athens and you can
see there have been major changes.
''Some, I know, were because of injuries, but others are due to the
team re-building plans which the manager has been working on since last
close season. From memory only, three or four of the players who
defeated Hibs played in that first preliminary round game in Greece.''
Some players have moved on, others have been brought in, and, always,
in the process of changing personnel, manager Walter Smith has been able
to deliver yet another title.
He has also answered to some extent those critics who knocked his
''ageing team'' by bringing in younger players and so reducing the
average age of the side. Craig Moore and Charlie Miller have been
bonuses in a season which stretched Rangers' resources to the limit.
But, as well as that pair, Alan McLaren, Alex Cleland, Gary Bollan, and
even Laudrup, have given Smith's team a younger, fresher look.
Now more star players will arrive in the summer. Is it any wonder that
the bookies make them favourites yet again?

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown had to re-think his squad selection
yesterday after #4m man Duncan Ferguson was taken off injured playing
for Everton against Sheffield Wednesday.
Ferguson went off after only 22 minutes of the Hillsborough match, and
was immediately ruled out of the Scotland pool for the European
championship match against San Marino.
Brown will name his squad at Hampden this afternoon.
Instead of the beanpole 6 ft 3in Ferguson, Brown will opt for
Chelsea's pint-sized front man John Spencer, another former Ibrox
player.
Brown will check on him this morning, but knew he had played in his
club's important 0-0 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford
yesterday.
Said Brown: ''Obviously it would have been good for us to have big
Duncan for the game in San Marino. It would have given us a player who
would have presented them with a lot of problems.
''But I knew there had been an injury doubt surrounding the big
fellow. Remember, he pulled out of our last match against Russia in
Moscow, and I understand this is the same problem.
''To be honest, I had some apprehension about his fitness and had
other players in mind in case this happened.''
Spencer -- he also missed out on Moscow -- was one of them and a
recall for Pat Nevin was another.
Both will be in the squad, and Brown points out: ''Even without Duncan
we will still have enough strikers in the squad.
''John McGinlay is there and Duncan Shearer and Darren Jackson, as
well as Spenny. I think that should be enough to give us the result we
need next week.''
Scotland have played in San Marino before and, therefore, the ground
and the problems that exist there are nothing new to the players.
There will be no shocks today. Brown will stick to the men who
returned from their mission to Moscow with the vital point taht put them
back on course for a place in the finals in England in the summer of
next  year.

THANK goodness for Estonia. Scottish swimming fortunes continued to
plummet yesterday when the team finished fourth out of five at the
Multi-Nations Meet at the Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh.
Finland were the overall winners with Belgium and Switzerland also
finishing clear of the host nation. Only impoverished Estonia, who had
travelled to Edinburgh by bus and were staying in hostel accommodation,
finished below Scotland.
Coming in the wake of the recent announcement of a #1m development
plan, the result was an embarrassment.
Alison Sheppard could be excused criticism as she produced the only
home victory with a time of 26.98sec in the 50 metres free-style and
also contributed one of the three second-places in 58.91 in the 100m.
But Fraser Walker was a disappointment, although he had previously
intimated that he was treating the event as little more than a warm-up
for the European championship trials.
Nicola Steel, by virtue of a disqualification of Finland's Marena
Aimonen, and Andrew Aitken were the other home silver medallists, both
in the 200m back-stroke.

STEVEN Young emphasised his total domination of boys' golf in recent
years with his third Mobil Scottish Boys title in a row at chilly Royal
Aberdeen on Saturday.
After completing his 7 and 6 demolotion of Kirkcaldy's Mark Donaldson
in the 36-hole contest, the 18-year-old Inverallochy player was hailed
as one of the brightest prospects the game has produced north of the
Border for years.
The tribute came from Young's coach, Deeside pro Frank Coutts. ''I
know it might be said a lot, but I really do think that Steven Young has
the potential to become a world-beater,'' said the former Walker Cup
star.
That talent will be honed in America from this autumn as
theFraserburgh Academy pupil looks set to head for the University of
Houston.
Young, while enjoying looking back over his three years also had time
to look forward. ''I don't think a senior cap is beyond me this year if
I can be consistent enough, and down the line I would love to play in
the Walker Cup before I turned pro,'' he said.
For 16-year-old Donaldson, a Scottish boys' cap at the end of the this
year would be just rewards for his efforts.

COLIN Mitchell made amends for his disappointing first-round exit in
the Scottish Boys' championship at Royal Aberdeen last week by lifting
his district's premier strokeplay title in difficult, windy conditions
at Crieff.
The Blairgowrie youngster compiled a card of 75 on Saturday, which was
four over the standard scratch score and two ahead of nearest competitor
Andrew White, last season's Perth and Kinross matchplay champion, who
headed a group on 77 thanks to a better last nine.
Leading scores:
75 -- C Mitchell (Blairgowrie). 77 -- A White (Muckhart) bih, L
McCormack (Kinross) bl3, F Miller (Crieff).
* SONIA Grant, of Tillicoultry, denied Bridge of Allan's Heather
Stirling her third successive victory in the Stirling &amp; Clackmannan
Ladies championship yesterday.
In a close final at Stirling, Grant won the first hole and, with
steady driving and control around the greens she was never behind, and
closed out the match on the seventeenth by 3 and 1.
Semi-finals -- S Grant (Tillicoultry) beat J Abernethy (Alloa), 3 and
1; H Stirling (Bridge of Allan) beat J Taylor (Alloa), 5 and 4.

CHAOS reigned yesterday at the Catalonia Open in Girona, Spain, where
gale-force winds, at times gusting to more than 50mph, forced play to be
abandoned for the day after 35 of the 71 golfers had completed their
third rounds.
Play was originally halted at 2pm and tournament director Mike Stewart
then sent the 36 remaining golfers back on to the course after a
five-hour delay. But the wind increased again and Stewart called the
players in again without a single ball being struck.
Now the remainder of the third round will be played this morning with
the fourth round being staged from both the first and tenth tees in the
afternoon -- weather, of course, permitting.
When play was stopped, Welshman Phillip Price, the overnight leader at
six under par, had played four holes with one birdie and one bogey, and
was still six under. It left him one stroke ahead of Irishman Philip
Walton, who had advanced to five under with a birdie at the opening hole
and an eagle 2 at the third, where he chipped in.
Walton completed six holes while Howard Clark, playing with Price,
began with four pars to remain at four under.
Stuart Cage, Mark Davis, Australian Wayne Riley, and Scotland's Andrew
Coltart are all at one under on various parts of the course.
Earlier, Swede Joakim Haeggman, going out early when the wind was not
so strong, shot a course-record 66 -- and missed a two-foot putt on the
last green.
Leading completed three-round scores (British or Irish unless stated):
216 -- J Haeggman (Sweden) 73, 77, 66.
218 -- R Rafferty 78, 71, 69.
220 -- R Wessels (S Africa) 72, 78, 70; P Fulke (Sweden) 74, 76, 70; D
Williams 73, 76, 71; S Grappasonni (Italy) 76, 72, 72.
Six Scots survived the halfway cut, which was made at 150. They are:
145 -- G Orr 74, 71; S Torrance 73, 72. 146 -- A Coltart 72, 74; G
Brand Jr 68, 78; A Hunter 70, 76; 147 -- D Robertson 73, 74.
Failed to qualify:
152 -- M Miller 73, 79. 154 -- C Cassells 76, 78. 155 -- S McAllister
82, 73. 158 -- B Marchbank 81, 77. 159 -- C Ronald 82, 77.

SEVEN in a row. Fine, but where now for Rangers? An eighth successive
championship would not be unwelcome, but domestic titles don't do it for
the Ibrox supporters any more.
This is the harsh reality with which Walter Smith and his players must
live. There is a bigger game out there and having been fortunate enough
to sample the culture of the Champions' League once, fans of the
Scottish champions would like more.
Indeed, since they are being asked to produce #399 more each for the
right to purchase the same seat for the next quarter of a century, they
should expect a better return.
The fans celebrated over the weekend when confirmation of their club's
superiority arrived, but they knew months ago the league title wouldn't
be leaving Ibrox.
Rangers' manager, chairman, and players sometimes are infuriated by
those fans who take the domestic title for granted, but there is
absolutely nothing anyone within Ibrox can do about it. They simply have
to comply and produce. They are victims of their own success and it will
be interesting to see how many fans will respond to the invitation to
pay out money to secure the right to hand over more for season-tickets.
I suspect a fair number of these supporters believe they have paid
their dues to the club. If they insist that they have already helped
finance the revolution which took Rangers beyond the others and on to
one immensely enjoyable run in the Champions' League, who would damn
them?
Of course, it is not the fault of Rangers' management that the
Scottish game has been unable to tax them properly, and anyone who
rejects that truth has not watched enough football. Rarely were Rangers
required to perform at anything like their peak and yet the championship
race became a stroll.
The Ibrox side's progress was inexorable. Brian Laudrup's contribution
apart, it was without flair.
Rangers say there will be more of his type if fans pay an extra #399,
but if there is a limited amount of money available through sponsorship,
the same applies to the people with the scarves -- fans who believe
progress beyond the preliminary stages of the Champions' Cup isn't an
outrageous expectation.
Rangers have spent money on players, they deal in the transfer
market's top floor, and when it comes to Europe they haven't done enough
to satisfy. A place in a Champions' League section should be within
their capabilities without having to hope for help from the annual
reworking of the coefficients which determine a club's seeding position
in the European Cup.
Rangers were seeded No.10 this season, but there is a chance they
might move up not one, but perhaps even two, places, which would make
them exempt from pre-qualifying.
Everything depends on which clubs win the various leagues titles, but
Rangers should already be considered good enough to cope with a
preliminary round. That is the simple truth of the matter.
Speaking of which -- truth, that is -- it was encouraging to hear
Ernie Walker repeat on Radio Scotland's Sportsound the other day that
recommendations suggested by his review body charged with streamlining
the SFA and pointing the way ahead for Scottish football will be made
public. It will be vitally important that people know what
recommendations the SFA will either adopt or reject, because there is
still a degree of disdain for the supporters among the people who
control the game.
Remember, the fans are not to blame for the unsatisfactory state of
Scottish football, and Walker and his team should afford them all due
respect. That will mean providing proper answers instead of some of the
replies he gave on radio.
He saw no need to say why it has taken so long for the SFA to
recognise an independent review was necessary, even though prompt action
might have prevented the game from degenerating, and when the size of
the SFA's non-playing travelling party arose, he suggested there may be
a fat cat or two among the journalists.
The Fourth Estate isn't the place it used to be, but the efforts,
regardless of their worth, of those journalists who travel with the team
can be read on back pages, whereas there is no tangible evidence of the
contributions made by some of those who travel with the SFA.
A more reasoned response from Walker was required.
However, his attitude was not the only peculiar one. There were other
journalists on the programme, yet pressing Walker for an explanation
became a solitary task, and it was disappointing that the presenter
sounded anxious not to have Walker put on the spot.
There is too much deference shown to the game's authorities when, in
fact, all of us should be making sure that respect flows in the
direction of the people who make the game what it is. One or two of us,
at least, will continue that struggle.

THE Heritage Classic here in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina,
seemed destined to end in a play-off from the start of the final round.
The day began with a four-way tie for the lead, with 39 players within
five strokes, and at one point or another there were nine different
players tied for the lead.
The day ended with a three-way tie for the lead, with Bob Tway, Nolan
Henke, and South African David Frost heading to sudden death at nine
under par.
Tway won it on the second extra hole -- by two-putting from two foot
for par after Henke had failed to find the green and had to settle for a
bogey.
Frost was eliminated on the first hole of sudden death, making bogey
on the eighteenth hole, the hole that he had birdied from four feet to
get into the play-off some 20 minutes previously. It is the third
runner-up finish for Frost at Harbour Town in his last five starts here.
Tway and Henke posted their scores of 275 while the final groups were
still on the front nine. Tway, who has been in an on-and-off slump since
his spectacular 1986 season, when he won four tournaments, including the
US PGA Championship, said that he doubted that nine under would be good
enough to play off.
Either way, he said he'd be willing to wait the two hours to see --
''it's okay, I'd wait four years if I had to.'' It has been five years
since Tway last won on tour, defeating John Cook in a play-off at Las
Vegas.
Nick Faldo birdied two of the final four holes to finish at eight
under par, one stroke out of the play-off, and picked up his fourth
top-five finish since winning Doral last month. Faldo, who has been in
America since the start of the year, returns home to England for a
three-week break.
Faldo had five birdies and two bogeys in the round of 68 that left him
in a tie for fourth. ''The two bogeys on 13 and 14 were expensive,''
said Faldo. ''This whole week was a bit up and down. By the end of the
week you can say that there were so many chances. I wasn't 100% this
week, and I was still in it in the end, so that's not bad.''
He confirmed that he will increase his US schedule to 19 events this
year, and return in 1996 with a similar schedule. ''It's gone well for
me. It's been really productive. I'll come back after a break, hopefully
fresh and strong, and do nine more. If I want a shot at winning the
money list over here, I have to come out and be competitive every week.
But the first goal is the US Open and getting my game ready for that.''
Final scores (players US unless noted):

EDINBURGH Racers' hopes of landing their first British championship
for nine years were dashed by Sheffield Steelers at Wembley yesterday.
The 7-2 defeat was Racers' fifth in six finals as their power line was
frozen out by rough, tough Steelers.
Captain Tony Hand, the premier division's top points scorer this
season, Canadian Chris Palmer, and Slovakian marksman Ivan Matulik had
notched a remarkable 239 goals and 302 assists in 123 premier division
games.
But they were held in a vice-like grip by Steelers, who broke up the
Edinburgh side's rhythm with solid body hits and effective checking.
Former Murrayfield coach Alex Dampier claimed his first premier
division and British championship double thanks to the win.
His tactics in a near-capacity Wembley, which was a hothouse draining
the players visibly, worked a treat.
Ex-Racer Chris Kelland, now a veteran, patrolled his blue line with
calm authority and another former Racer, Scott Neil, helped put the
shackles on Matulik, who was never able to go on one of his typical mazy
runs.
Edinburgh-born Martin McKay, another former Murrayfield favourite, had
little to do, but the victory ended his own personal Wembley nightmare
and he claimed his first winner's medal in three attempts spanning nine
years.

OBAN Camanachd's victory over Fort William, in front of the biggest
crowd at a Keyline MacAulay Cup final for years, could not have come at
a more crucial time.
A 2-1 victory was sealed by a stunning 30-yard drive from captain Gus
Campbell in 59 minutes. The veteran, now 35, is poised to pull off a
thrilling list of victories.
In the Marine Harvest South championship on Wednesday night, Oban need
only one point against Glenorchy.
A Camanachd Cup semi-final against Newtonmore follows, and victory
would leave them within reach of the ultimate prize for the first time
since 1938. The final is on Oban's home pitch on June 3.
Camanachd should also win the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup, the south
knock-out championship, and look set to face Kingussie in the Marine
Harvest national league final in Inverness on May 13.
Kingussie notched their tenth successive north championship win,
beating Skye 2-0. Results:

BRENT Deans begins his first full week as director of Scottish hockey
this morning. But once he analyses the result of Scotland's
representatives in the European Cupwinners' Cup, he may wish he was back
in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales working in the coal mines.
Grange, competing in Tagliari in the men's event, failed to win a
point, a similar fate to that of the women of Heriot Watt University at
Groningen in Holland
Grange's scorelines, however, were respectable, particularly as they
had been unable to call on the services of young midfield star Gary
Boomer, in bed with a virus since arriving in Sardinia.
The Edinburgh side did well to hold gold medal favourites
Harvestehuder on Saturday to 0-3.
The only real disappointment was Grange's failure to secure something
from their tussle yesterday with the Russian club Ekaterinburg. They
lost 3-1.
The inexperienced Heriot Watt side, as feared, struggled all the way
through. Beaten 13-0 by Slough on Saturday, they have yet to score a
goal.
Groningen added to the misery yesterday with a 4-0 victory. Results:
Men: Saturday -- Real Polo Club 3, Ekaterinburg 0; Teddington 3,
Tocztowiec 1; Harvesehuder 3, Grange 0; HDM 2, Amsicora 0. Sunday --
Ekaterinburg 3, Grange 1: Ansicora 2, Tocztowiec 3; Real Polo Club 0,

NEVIS Range's Snowgoose piste proved its worth as Scotland's most
durable race track when it played a willing host to the Scottish
Childrens championships and the World Gelandesprung championships over
the weekend.
Amanda Pirie underlined just how far ahead of most slalom skiers of
her own age she is as she lifted the girls' Scottish title. Skiing from
a start number of eight, on successive runs she showed her superior
technique -- quick and light on her feet, absorbing well the bumps and
undulations of the artifically hardened track -- to win both heats by an
average of one and a half seconds a run.
Her Aberdeen clubmate, Pamela Robb, current British champion in slalom
and Super G, lay second after the first run but skied out before the
finish of her second heat.
In the boys' slalom, British Super G champion Blair Aitken took some
small compensation for failing to finish in the British championship
slalom by winning the Scottish title.
James Ormond will have his travel on the European circuit eased
considerably as he won a car for setting a new British record of 37
metres in the Gelandesprung championship. Results:
Slalom: Boys -- 1, B Aitken (Ormiston) 39.23, 41.55 (1-20.78); 2, N
Baxter (Aviemore) 39.05, 43.52 (1-22.57); 3, D Murray (St Andrews)
40.10, 42.72 (1-22.82). Under-14 -- 1, T Hutchison (Edinburgh) 40.83,

SCOTLAND women's hockey team have in the course of the Four Nations
Tournament in Rome sunk to the depth of mediocrity on Saturday losing to
Germany 5-1 and Italy 2-0, but yesterday they hit the heights of ecstasy
by beating Olympic champions, Spain, 2-1, writes Joseph Dillon.
The performance of the Scots in the final game bore no resemblance to
that which they displayed 24 hours earlier in one of Scotland's worst
international performances.
The defeat of Spain has unquestionably taken a load of pressure off
coach Neil Menzies, for he conceded afterwards: ''Instead of coming away
disappointed, we now leave Rome in a positive frame of mind.''
It did, however, look for a time as though Scotland just might allow
Spain to seize the initiative from them. Gill Messenger had given
Scotland a score from a thirty-ninth-minute penalty corner but the wind
was taken out of the Scots' sails just five minutes later when Mar Feito
levelled the scores.
Eleven minutes from time smiles returned to the Scottish women's faces
after 22-year-old Susan Gilmour made a break on the right flank as
Pauline Robertson forced a loose ball over the line. Results:
Saturday: Scotland 1, Germany 5; Spain 4, Italy 0; Scotland 0, Italy
2; Germany 3, Spain 1. Sunday: Spain 1, Scotland 2; Germany 3, Italy 0.
Placings: 1, Germany 6 pts; 2, Spain 2 pts; 3, Scotland 2 pts; 4, Italy
2 pts.

IT WAS a case of horses for courses on Tayside yesterday when the
twenty-second Dundee Masters Tournament saw the only three previous
winners in the 32-man line-up take the first three places while in the
women's event the only two former winners in the field fought out the
final.
Swansea's John Price took the men's title, edging out East Lothian's
Graham Robertson 21-19 in a 27-end three-hour marathon while the women's
title went to Midlothian's Jeanette Conlan who beat defending champion
and newly crowned world indoor champion Joyce Lindores, also 21-19.
Both Price and Robertson reached the final with six-out-of-six
records. Price, the winner back in 1992, came through Saturday's opening
day with wins over West Lothian's Peter Ball 21-11, Graeme Byrne from
Balbardie 21-12, and Elgin's Ronnie Gill 21-7.
He picked up where he had left off yesterday beating Nithsdale's
Graeme Maxwell 21-7, Paisley's Brian Sinclair 21-10, and Coatbridge's
Sandy Syme also 21-10.
Robertson, whom Price had succeeded as the champion three years ago,
found himself in the tougher of the two sections yesterday but the East
Lothian man proved more than up to the task. He beat Midlothian's David
Peacock 21-12, Prestwick's David Gourlay Jr 19-10, and Scottish champion
Paul Conlan 21-11.
Robertson dominated the early part of the final and with 18 ends
completed led 16-10. Price then strung together a run of 3, 2, 1 and 2
to lead 18-16 and a single on the twenty-seventh end wrapped up victory.
Conlan took the women's title for the third time in four years when
she just held on to beat Lindores. Results:

ALTHOUGH they fought all the way, Scotland's men's team were forced to
settle for silver medals from these world championships, going down by
4-2 to Canada in a tense final that could have gone either way right up
to the last end.
Canada started the game with last stone advantage, thanks to their
perfect 9-0 record in the round-robin, and blanked the first end.
In the second, Scottish skip Gordon Muirhead's first stone just stayed
inside the 12-foot ring and this forced Canadian skip Kerry Burtnyk to
hit and stay, opening his account with a single.
Muirhead had a chance to score 2 at the third end, but his final draw
was too short and, instead, Canada stole a single for a 2-0 lead.
The Scots chose to blank the fourth end. In the fifth, a freeze on to
a Canadian stone by Scotland third Peter Loudon set the Scots up well
and Muirhead eventually had a hit and stay to score 1.
The Scots set themselves up for a steal at the sixth when Muirhead
shaved past two Canadian guards to replace a Canadian stone on the four
foot. Burtnyk was unable to out-draw this stone and the Scots took 1 to
level the game at 2-2.
It was Canada's turn to blank in the seventh end and they went back
into the lead at the eighth when Burtnyk took out Muirhead's last stone
and stayed in the house.
For a moment in the ninth end, it looked as though Scotland would
snatch victory. After an exchange of shots on the wing, Muirhead had a
roll off a Canadian stone that took his stone just behind the button and
a front Canadian guard, looking good to score two. With only inches to
play with, Burtnyk froze his last stone inside Muirhead's and when the
Scot attempted to remove it with weight, he took out one of his own
stones but, although the Canadian stone rolled as well, it stayed inside
the house to count and give Canada their second single steal of the
game.
In the tenth, Scotland set themselves up well for a 2 to level the
game, but with his last stone, Burtnyk played a perfect double take-out
to give him his first world title.
After the game, a disappointed Muirhead acknowledged the standard of
play that had beaten him. ''There was a lot of pressure on Burtnyk and
it took a great shot to beat us,'' he said.
Muirhead also praised his own team: ''They've all played magnificently
this week.'' And, in a reference to the partisan full-house crowd, he
said: ''If we can manage to curl in front of this lot, we can play
anywhere.''
Canada were denied a golden double, when Sweden's Elisabet Gustafson
beat Connie Laliberte by 6-5 in the extra end of the women's final.

THE Loch Dunvegan is not a bonnie boat. Nor does she speed like a bird
on the wing over the sea to Skye. She is a more prosaic craft, plodding
between Kyleakin and Kyle of Lochalsh more than 50 times a day as a
trusty workhorse of the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry fleet.
She may not be much to look at but, along with her sister ship the
Loch Fyne, she maintains a lifeline to the misty isle that has existed
for thousands of years. In their red, white, and black livery, the
vessels have become a familiar feature of a magnificent view up the
Inner Sound to the hills and jagged peaks of Scalpay and Raasay.
Not for much longer. The ferries are about to be replaced by a
concrete umbilical cord, linking Skye with the mainland for the first
time since the Ice Age. The shape of things to come looms over CalMac
ferries as they shuttle across the mouth of Loch Alsh -- a broken jaw of
gravel and cement about to snap shut 100 feet above the narrow channel.
The Skye Bridge is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a work of
art. To some it is a historic feat of engineering, to others it is an
ugly blot on the landscape. The truth is that it looks like a motorway
flyover.
Even its builders do not expect its box-girder design to win any
awards for aesthetic appeal. Mr John Henderson, the project manager,
says the aim was to make the structure as unobtrusive as possible.
''At first we considered trying to create something that would be a
feature in its own right, like the Forth Bridge,'' he says. ''But it was
obvious we could never compete with the scenery around it, so we opted
for a low-profile design that would blend into the environment rather
than stand out from it.''
The result is a flat section resting on low pillars leading from the
mainland to two islets, where a ramp rises to a balanced cantilever
bridge more than 500 yards long -- roughly the equivalent of five
Hampden Parks.
The whitewashed cottages and the adjacent Stevenson lighthouse on
Eilean Ban, where the late Gavin Maxwell wrote his classic Ring of
Bright Water, are now dwarfed by the rising span of the bridge. But at
least his beloved otters have been catered for. Engineers have bored
five tunnels and created two new habitats for them, including
fresh-water pools, and low walls are being built to prevent them
crossing the road. Mr Henderson is pleased to report the otters are
using the tunnels and making friends with his construction workers.
Features have also been added to the bridge to enhance its appearance.
Flarings above the main pillars are said to suggest seagulls in flight,
although the illusion is not immediately apparent to the untrained eye.
Mr Henderson is philosophical about the outcome. He recalls being
asked by an elderly Skye man when work began on the bridge three years
ago what it would look like. The man concluded: ''Ach well, I suppose it
depends on who's looking at it.''
Controversy raging over the #30m structure now is less concerned with
its appearance, or whether it should be there at all, than with how much
it will cost to use it when it is completed in September. There seems no
doubt the majority of islanders favour a fixed link with the mainland
but they are incensed at having to pay substantial tolls for it. The
prevailing sentiment is that they are being held to ransom by a private
company, with no alternative but to pay up -- a kind of highway robbery
without masks.
Skye Bridge Ltd plans to charge tolls roughly equivalent to the ferry
fares, with rises pegged to the retail price index, ranging from about
#5 for a single trip for a private vehicle to #37 for a tourist coach.
At current prices, a lorry would pay around #25. Discounts will be
available for regular users but critics claim they will still be the
highest bridge tolls in Europe, placing further strains on a fragile
island economy.
Ms Kathleen MacRae of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, who lives at
Breakish near the construction site, points out that Skye will become
the only place in the UK with no free or convenient alternative to a
high-toll bridge. She cites as a contrast the Erskine Bridge near
Glasgow, where car drivers pay 60 pence with the option of free passage
through the Clyde Tunnel.
''When a bridge was first mooted, nobody in their wildest dreams
thought they would have to pay such tolls. What the Secretary of State
has done is impose something on us we can't afford. Any economic
advantages afforded by the bridge will be wiped out by the tolls.''
Mrs MacRae is not impressed by assurances that the bridge will revert
to public ownership within 15 to 20 years, once the cost of building it
has been recouped. ''It will probably fall into our lap just when
repairs become necessary,'' she says.
Having lost its rearguard action against the tolls, the appeal group
is pinning its hopes on a fledgling Skye Boat Company, being formed by
residents to maintain a ferry service when CalMac withdraws from the
route. Mr Bob Danskin, one of the directors, reports an encouraging
start to fund raising and says they have an eye on a suitable boat.
However, they face problems over modifications to the slipways and it is
still far from certain that the company will be afloat when traffic
starts flowing over the bridge.
In the Claymore bar and restaurant in Broadford, patrons have
calculated that, on a distance for price basis, the bridge will be more
expensive than flying to New York by Concorde. Mr Sean Cameron, a fish
farmer, says the creative accounting confirms the tolls are ''a bloody
disgrace''.
''We asked for it, right enough, but we never thought we'd have to pay
so much for it. What worries us is the tolls will mean prices going to
go up in the shops and the cost of living is already higher here than on
the mainland. I'm still for the bridge but not at any price.''
Skye Bridge Ltd staged a coup last year by recruiting Sir Iain Noble,
who had hitherto denounced the project as a waste of scarce resources,
as its chairman. Sir Iain, a merchant banker and Gaelic enthusiast who
has developed widespread business interests on Skye, says his change of
heart was dictated by pragmatism.
''It seemed to me that if there was going to be a bridge to Skye, and
that it seemed an inevitability, then it was better that as much as
possible of the administration and the jobs should be located on Skye,
because its people are the ones who have to put up with paying the
tolls.''
He admits the charges are high by UK standards and sympathises with
the objectors: ''It is one thing paying extra for a ferry, which is
something of an adventure, but just throwing it into a bucket to cross a
bridge is a bit of a pain.'' However, he points out that the bridge
company has no control over the tolls, being bound by its lending banks
to charge the maximum allowed by law.
''One could reduce the tolls but then they would go on for longer.
There is even an argument for increasing them, to shorten the toll
regime. Taking everything into account, however, I think they are
probably at about the right level.''
Sir Iain has proposed embellishing the bridge with a ceremonial
gateway and statues of a legendary Norse princess and a Celtic hero. He
is also keen to create a natural heritage centre on Eilean Ban, beneath
the arches of the bridge, with its resident otters as star attractions.
Such schemes are regarded sceptically in Kyleakin, which has most to
lose from the fixed link. The little village of whitewashed houses, with
its hotels, restaurants, and gift shops, will be effectively by-passed
by the bridge, which descends a few hundred yards to the north on the
main road to Portree.
Few of the 400,000 ferry passengers a year who pass through Kyleakin
are likely to make the detour required by the bridge to visit it,
raising fears that it could become a ghost village. Locals who travel
free on the ferries as foot passengers for shopping trips to Kyle of
Lochalsh now face a bus journey across the bridge.
In the local post office, there is a sheaf of papers on which
customers are invited to state their preference for a ferry or a bus
service. At the last count, the ferries had 68 supporters and the buses
had one. The prevailing view was expressed by C N Reid, who wrote: ''The
ferry has been there all our lives. Please try to keep it going.''
The mood among 40 CalMac ferrymen facing redundancy is one of
resignation. Mr Iain MacRae, an engineer on the Loch Dunvegan, says:
''There are no jobs round here. We'll just have to move away.''
A colleague adds: ''It was the northenders, the business people, that
wanted the bridge but now they don't want to pay for it. Well, the
powers that be have made their mind up, and that's all there is to it.''
Opinion among the first tourists of spring disembarking at Kyleakin
seemed to be divided. An elderly lady from Sussex averred: ''I hate the
idea of a bridge to Skye. I'll never use it.''
However, her husband said: ''We'll have no choice next time. That's
progress, isn't it?''
Ms Helena Macmillan, a ferry stewardess from Mallaig, expresses a
common mainland view: ''I think it's a shame. It's going to spoil the
magic of the island, it'll take away the quaintness and the romance.''
Whatever the merits of the bridge, perhaps the real shame is that it
symbolises the encroachment of a faster pace of life, with its
obsessions for saving time and money, on an island community admired for
its tranquility.
For unhurried visitors from the south, it will still be possible to
sail over the sea to Skye on the longer and more expensive crossing from
Mallaig to Armadale. However, the scenic route through the Highlands
past Eilean Donan Castle will soon lead to a Bridge of Sighs.

ST Andrews is synonymous with golf and on July 20, the good and the
great of this most ancient game will be heading for north-east Fife's
most historic city. Hotel rooms will be at a premium within a 50-mile
radius as visitors pay handsomely for the privilege of being part of the
124th Open Golf Championship.
The history of The Open dates back to October 17, 1860, when the
Prestwick Golf Club bestowed the new Challenge Belt on Willie Park Snr
whose winning score of 174 assured him a place in the annals of golfing
history.
Now, 123 championships later, The Open is returning to the universally
recognised home of golf. The elegant streets of St Andrews and the old
cobbled lanes of the pretty fishing towns of the East Neuk will echo
American and Japanese accents.
With five fairways to heaven on the doorstep, golfers, gourmets and
gentlefolk can enjoy this auld grey toun, so steeped in history and
legend, at any time of year.
Since its beginnings -- believed to be in the fourth century -- St
Andrews' past has been tumultuous. According to legend, St Rule was
shipwrecked off the Fife coast, on board were relics of the apostle St
Andrew. The monk established a religious community and by the eighth
century pilgrims were flocking to view the site of the shrine.
In the Middle Ages, St Andrews served as the headquarters of
Scotland's Roman Catholic Church and a magnificent Gothic cathedral was
built on the site of the shrine. The Reformation took its toll and on
June 5, 1559, supporters of John Knox, fresh from a rousing meeting,
plundered the cathedral and left it in ruin.
Standing above the harbour where the land drops to the sea, the
cathedral site is as dramatic as it is doleful. The North Sea breeze
whistles through the great east window and down the stretch of turf that
was once the central aisle.
By the end of the Middle Ages three university colleges were built,
the first being the magnificent St Salvator's of 1450. Today the
university quadrangles and gardens offer a haven of peace and
tranquility.
The city first began welcoming tourists in 1840, when Provost Playfair
broadened the streets and created a seaside resort. The elegant north
and south streets became favourite haunts of intellectuals like Thomas
Carlyle and Antony Trollope and Victorian hotels began to line The
Scores above the expansive sandy beach.
Today this ancient royal burgh offers something for all the family.
The Sea Life Centre gives children and adults the chance to study marine
life of all shapes and sizes with displays, live exhibits and
observation pools. Children are also well catered for at the 50-acre
Craigtoun Country Park where there is a miniature train ride,
trampolines, boating, crazy golf and several landscaped gardens.
To the north of St Andrews, Newton Hill Country Sports offers fly
fishing, clay pigeon shooting and the excitement of off-road driving.
These 750-acres of open farmland overlooking the River Tay comprise one
of Scotland's finest country sporting venues.
To the south of St Andrews the coastal fishing towns of Fife's East
Neuk offer a rare catch of lifestyles frozen in time. These
picture-postcard settlements have harbours created from immense stone
blocks and quaint but 'n' bens with crow-stepped gables and colourful
tiled roofs.
It is impossible to escape the influence of golf in St Andrews with
the British Golf Museum standing in the shadow of the palatial, but
still men only, Royal and Ancient clubhouse. However, you do not need to
be an aficionado of the fairways to enjoy a visit to this tranquil city
-- nor do you need to be rich.
The new 18-hole golf course, opening in July, at Craigtoun is owned by
the Old Course Hotel and will offer guests the option of playing an
inland course of championship standard.

CANCUN, one of Mexico's most dazzling resorts in the Yucutan
Peninsula, lies within easy reach of major archaeological sites; ancient
Maya-land, dating back centuries and bordering five countries. It is the
ideal place to stay and a good point from which to explore the area,
rich in wildlife and bird sanctuaries as well as being idyllic for
beachcombers.
Little more than 20 years ago, Cancun was just a sleepy fishing
village, now the international resort has all the hedonistic pleasures
you could wish for and the fun goes on as long as you can.
Hotels range from the deluxe to the simple. Endless beaches of
crushed-cool-to-the-feet-limestone sand, known as ''air-conditioned''
face a turquoise-silk sea and the tequila comes in coconut shells at
sunset.
There's every watersport you can think of, huge shopping malls where
you shop until you drop, every kind of restaurant and entertainment
round the clock. Surrounded by water on both sides, a lagoon on one and
the sea on the other, you can even change water-territory daily.
Cancun also claims the best bus service in Mexico. You can flag one
down every three minutes. They even like to practise their English on
buses. Streets are well lit at night and it's safe to wander to downtown
Cancun when the lights come on and street musicians come out. There's
little problem with language, but it always pays to carry a phrasebook.
The Mayan civilisation is close at hand. For day trips, 30 miles from
Cancun, lies Tulum, once a major Mayan port and religious centre,
surrounded by a wall in a glorious setting by the sea. Coba, an 81
square mile site, was once a trading centre where 16 ceremonial highways
converged.
If you're tempted to climb pyramids on these sites, as many tourists
are, be sure to pack, sturdy, rubber-grip shoes.
Another day-trip goes to the island of Cozumel made famous by Jacques
Cousteau for its Palancar Reef, heaven for snorkellers and divers. The
crystalline Caribbean offers visibility to around 100ft.
Yucutan differs from the rest of Mexico being totally flat where all
else is mountainous in this huge and vibrant country. The need for water
and open wells drew the Mayan communities here more than 2000 years ago
and many of their cities, mostly surrounded by jungle, have been
excavated.
Chichen Itza, about a two-hour run from Cancun is one of the most
famous. Although the Toltec tribes took it from the Maya and put their
structures on top of the former, most have been reclaimed and you can
climb to the top of the highest pyramid here by means of interior
stairway, if you have good nerves and like dark, damp places.
An ancient ball-court is still intact with lovely carvings; the
players had to hurl the ball through the ring with their feet. It was a
no-hands game and the lucky winner, legend has it, was decapitated, as
they thought his blood pure and had to be fed to the serpent to appease
him.
Golden Uxmal was a major classical site; the name means ''three times
built''. Temples and other buildings still stand, but most inspiring is
the observatory where the Maya plotted the course of the stars,
predicted solar and lunar eclipses and invented the first-ever accurate
calendar.
Merida, the sparkling, white capital city of Yucutan, is a good stop
over for Mayan excursions. An old Spanish town with fine colonial
architecture, it is best appreciated on foot but horse-drawn carriages
are at the ready. The majestic twin-towered cathedral was built in 1598
and has a lovely white-pillared interior with the Spanish Royal Coat of
Arms above the entrance.
Spending a few days in Cancun and a few days touring Maya-land is
perhaps, the best way to see it all.

SO far, have you enjoyed your Easter holiday?
Did you, like thousands of others, venture out into the countryside
for a breath of fresh air to watch spring lambs gambolling in the
freshly-green fields or ramble through one of your local forests?
If so did you find ease of access or were you confronted by the hated
''Private Land'' signs or any of its variations? And did you get fresh
air or were you subjected to the spring-time aroma that follows a farmer
spreading slurry on his fields? And did the children fall into some
choked, stinking ditch?
The subjects of access and pollution never fail to arouse dispute
between the farmers and foresters of this country and from ''the
public'', the people who regard themselves as the taxpayers who foot the
bill for the management and maintenance of the countryside.
It was interesting to note that at last week's annual general meeting
of the Scottish Landowners' Federation (an organisation whose members
own or are responsible for much of our land) there were only about 40
who took the time to get together and discuss future policies.
A day later there was a conference on pollution in agriculture
attended by nearly 200!
Taking the landowners first, it was not surprising they were reminded
that they need to improve their public image. They must stop being seen
as the people who want to to prevent ''the public'' from wandering on
the hills and moors to enjoy the scenery and wildlife. They should not
be concerned only with the potential profits from grouse, deer and
salmon. That was the message the few lairds in attendance were given.
But it has been said before, many times, and taking on a new public
relation consultant is not going to convince ''the public'' that efforts
to restrict access are really meaningful.
Not all landowners are titled inheritors of vast tracts of deer forest
or grouse moor; many are struggling to show a profit from whatever
enterprise their land will carry. And they are not all vandals covering
hillsides with trees, alien species or otherwise.
However, there are still too many instances of lack of integration
with the community and the casual visitor for ''the public'' to believe
that there are genuine hardship cases among landowners trying to earn a
living from the land.
If they wish to be seen more evidently as caretakers of the land as
well as operators of business enterprises in a rural environment they
will need to pay more attention to pressing demands such as improved red
deer culling and reduced gouging out of hillsides to create roads for
foresters and sportsmen.
Their public relations consultant can remind them that proactive is
much better than reactive.
Which takes me on to a much wider issue of public concern. Pollution
in the countryside. Not just the crisp bags and drinks cans that litter
lay-bys, hedges and ditches and cause untold problems for farmers with
livestock and the resultant vet's bill for ingested indigestible
material. The insidious movement of materials which find their way into
water supplies.
The Scottish Agricultural College is to be congratulated for its
conference which attracted experts from all over this country and abroad
to debate diffuse pollution. That so many took the time and trouble to
attend this two-day conference is evidence of the seriousness of the
extent of the problem.
The cleaning up of agricultural operations to protect the environment
has been ongoing for years but the experts who gathered in Edinburgh had
some frightening tales to tell. Badly-managed sheep-dipping operations
contaminating burns and rivers, inefficient surveillance of silage and
slurry storage facilities will, unhappily, continue to pose problems for
the river purification boards and water authorities as will the
haphazard application of pesticides and fertilisers.
However, with mounting pressures on farmland users to take -- and be
paid for -- land out of intensive production there is surely evidence
for what the environmental scientists are calling for -- buffer zones
around field margins.
Modern farming technology removed millions of miles of field-edge
margins and with set-aside grants these can be restored and improved not
only to act as blotting pads for chemicals that would find their way
into the public water system but which would improve the landscape and
the environment for dependent wildlife.
It was pointed out that in America land-users have to put forward
pollution control schemes and are encouraged to implement non-tillage
practices to help reduce soil erosion. With feedlots up to 30,000 beasts
and dairy units of up to 2000 cows they are aware of the need for waste
containment for material that is potentially hazardous.
We know there is pressure for agricultural land to be used for
disposal of sewage that until now may have been dumped at sea and
hopefully the soil scientists will pre-empt any problems.
Can they cope with your crisp bags and drink cans?

FARMING tenants of British Coal land in Fife are drawing new battle
plans to oppose what they say is pressurised efforts to make them pay
unrealistic prices for the land they farm.
They fear that high-priced valuations are being put on their land to
deter them from buying while behind-the-scenes moves are under way to
accept offers from institutional buyers.
Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine has been urged to
intervene to ensure the tenants get a fair deal but so far Scottish
Farmers' Union president John Ross has heard nothing to relieve the
worries of the 40 Fife farmers.
Brodie Wallace of Easter Bowhill, Cardenden, said: ''They tell us the
value of the land and we have four weeks to accept or make a counter
offer. But they do not detail any land sale conditions which would allow
me to go to a bank manager and ask for money to buy. The valuations are
laughable and no banker would consider a loan without knowing certain
conditions.''
The Farmers' Union has insisted that where a tenant makes a
counter-offer to buy there should be no sale to another party at below
the tenant's offer. So far it has had no assuarnce from British Coal or
the DTI.
For some tenants the offer-to-buy time limit runs out next week.
Others are still waiting to find out what valuations have been put on
the land that may have been farmed by their families for generations.
A land sale expert said that some British Coal valuations would mean
tenants having to pay 30 to 40 times the annual rent and that
institutional buyers could be waiting to offer only 12 to 14 times the
rental for a ''job lot'' purchase of agricultural land with some
development potential.
''The open market values which have been struck do not take sufficient
account of the tenant's improvements over the years and discounting of
34% does not equate with the 70% discount offered by Department of
Agriculture to small-holding tenants.''

CEILIDH Boy and Plenty Crack could represent the best chances of a
local succcess in the Stakis Scottish Grand National at Ayr on Saturday
-- if sufficent of the original entry of 80 drop out.
Since the race was transferred from Bogside in 1966 there has never
been the maximum 30 runners for this handicap chase, but this time there
will have to be almost 50 defections over the next five days if
Scottish-trained prospects are to run. The largest field was 28 when
Four Trix won in 1990.
Most Grand National runners entered for the Ayr race will come out,
although Mark Pitman said yesterday that a final decision on whether to
run Aintree hero Royal Athlete would not be taken until the last
possible minute.
Confidence in the chances of Bruce Mactaggart's Plenty Crack, winner
of six races, was boosted at Carlisle on Saturday when the 12-year-old
ran well to finish fifth in a three-mile chase, and stablemate Well
Appointed (14-1), owned by a Hawick pub syndicate, won a two-mile
novices hurdle.
Mactaggart, whose Cheeny's Brig was runner-up to Mighty Mark in 1988,
said: ''I was absolutely delighted with Plenty Crack. He'll get the
distance, and if the ground is good, he'll be running on at the
finish.''
Mrs Dawn Goodfellow, current leading Scottish-permit holder with eight
winners, is also quietly confident about the chances of Ceilidh Boy. She
said: ''He is very well. I just hope he gets a chance to run.''
The last Scottish-trained winner was Ken Oliver's Cockle Stand in
1982.

PUNTERS face a mammoth task if they attempt to tackle all 16 meetings
in Britain today. It is best, therefore, to concentrate on El Atrevido,
who could have been let in lightly in the #20,000 Westminster-Motor Taxi
Insurance Rosebery Handicap at Kempton.
Nick Walker's import was lightly raced when trained in France at three
and four, but showed useful form when two-and-a-half-lengths second to
the Group-class Apogee at Longchamp.
He won easily on his British debut at Lingfield in January, and
returned with a sore throat when disappointing subsequently. El Atrevido
resumed winning ways at the same track last month, beating Zacaroon by a
neck.
Coming here in form and fit from the all-weather, El Atrevido clearly
has a fighting chance on those grounds alone, but also looks to have
been given a real opportunity by the handicapper.
He has been put in on a rating of 68, which seems fair on what he has
shown on the all-weather -- but a gift on his best turf form. El
Atrevido, therefore, gets the nap vote.
Moonlight Quest looks the safest option in the #15,000 Queen's Prize
Handicap. The grey failed to make the winner's enclosure last year, and
the handicapper consequently relented a little.
But Moonlight Quest got this season off on the right note with an easy
five-length defeat of Rolling The Bones at Beverley. He has been upped
7lb, but remains nicely treated on his best form.
Golden Ball can start what should be a successful year by winning the
#18,000 Magnolia Stakes. Michael Stoute's colt finished seventh in last
year's Derby and appeals as the type to improve as a four-year-old.
* TODAY'S Leeds Novices' Handicap Chase at Wetherby is a walkover for
Forward Glen, the first walkover since the British Horseracing Board
introduced the re-opening of races just over a year ago to counteract
small fields.
The race was one of 10 re-offered yesterday morning when only Forward
Glen was declared to run at the overnight stage.

HENRY Cecil will unleash 1000 Guineas ''dark horse'' Epagris in the
Gainsborough Stud Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury on Friday. Epagris is
as short as 12-1 for the first fillies' classic after a 10-length
success in a maiden at Newmarket last October on her only start.
However, Cecil warned: ''We hope she is a good filly, but she has only
won a maiden. We don't take much notice of what the bookmakers say.''
Epagris is likely to be put to the test by Group One winners Aqaarid,
Gay Gallanta, and Hoh Magic.
On Thursday, Cecil takes the wraps off Kentucky Derby candidate Eltish
in the Feilden Stakes.
The colt has been earmarked for a tilt at the first leg of the
American triple crown since finishing second to Timber Country in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs.
Cecil said yesterday: ''Eltish is in good order.''

GOLF ROUND-UP
EAST Renfrewshire's Craig Watson stormed to a three-stroke victory in
the Craigmillar Park Open in Edinburgh yesterday, having taken hold of
the tournament after his opening five-under-par 65 in the first pairing
out on Saturday morning.
The Scottish over-25s champion never surrendered the lead, adding
rounds of 67, 66, and 73 in near perfect playing conditions to clinch
the prestigous amateur event.
In second position came Powfoot's Craig Hislop, who closed with a 68,
followed by Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher, the winner of last week's
Scottish Champion of Champions.
Watson, who began the final round eight shots clear, said: ''I think I
was lucky to receive a lot of fortunate breaks this weekend -- and I
putted well.'' Leading scores:
271 -- C Watson (East Renfrewshire) 65, 67, 66, 73.
274 -- C Hislop (Powfoot) 68, 71, 67, 68.
278 -- S Gallacher (Bathgate) 70, 68, 68, 72.
279 -- M Brooks (Carluke) 70, 72, 69, 68; C Elliot (Carrickvale) 68,
70, 70, 71.
280 -- S Smith (Duddingston) 70, 69, 70, 71.
281 -- S Mackenzie (West Linton) 72, 70, 67, 72.
282 -- E Forbes (Nairn) 68, 70, 75, 69.
283 -- S Meiklejohn (Aberdour) 67, 65, 75, 76; C Nowicki (Wilmslow)
68, 74, 74, 67.
284 -- H McKibbin (Troon Welbeck) 68, 73, 70, 73; R Roper (Catterick
Garrison) 67, 67, 72, 78.
* EAST Kilbride's Craig Heap lost out to local favourite Christopher
Chagrais at the twenty-first hole in the second round of the French
Junior Nations Cup at Saint-Nom-La-Breteche on Saturday after birdieing
the final three holes to force a play-off.
He had disposed of French internationalist Diego Dupin in the morning
by one hole.
* KATRINA Milne, of Kirkcaldy yesterday blasted her way to the Fife

A CENTURY partnership from openers Mark Taylor and Michael Slater got
Australia off to a flying start in their first innings reply to the West
Indies Board XI yesterday at Basseterre, St Kitts.
They added 119 in 129 minutes before Slater (60) was bowled by Ottis
Gibson, a hero with the bat in the Board XI's 261 first innings total.
At tea on the second day of the three-day match at Warner Park,
Australia were 167 for two.
Taylor (62) was bowled by Vasbert Drakes five minutes before the
interval. Greg Blewett was unbeaten on 26 with new batsman Justin Langer
yet to score.
Earlier, off-spinner Tim May picked up the last two Board XI wickets,
but not before Gibson had hammered 55 from only 59 balls, hitting three
6s and six 4s.
* KEIGHLEY teenager Malcolm Burk took two stumpings against his native
county as Cambridge University held on for a draw on Saturday against
Yorkshire at Fenner's.
Burk took over behind the stumps when first-choice keeper David
Churton broke a finger, with captains and umpires agreeing to waive the
TCCB rule that forbids a substitute from keeping wicket.
Burk's victims were his schoolboy coach and Yorkshire wicketkeeper
Richard Blakey, and Paul Grayson, who shared in a 112-run opening
partnership with Michael Vaughan.
Umpire Dickie Bird was also ''substituted'' as he was unable to stand
because of a knee injury. He was replaced for the final innings by Peter
Chismon.

SCOTTISH Claymores are desperate to notch up their first win after
having snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in last weekend's
thrilling 19-17 setback at the hands of Dusseldorf's Rhein Fire in their
opening World League match.
The Claymores meet Barcelona Dragons at the Montjuic Stadium this
afternoon, with the Spaniards also looking for their first win after a
17-13 defeat by Amsterdam Admirals.
Claymores' wide receiver Tim Barnett caught eight passes, two of them
touchdowns, for a total of 118 yards during last Sunday's defeat, and
was promptly renamed ''Touchdown Timmy'' by his team-mates for his
efforts.
However, despite his performance, which also earned him the game's
Most Valuable Player award, Barnett was disappointed. ''It's a team
game, not an individual game, and while I had a good one last Sunday, we
still lost. I've played a long time and what means most to me is to
win.''
Barnett, who spent two years in the NFL with the Kansas City Chiefs,
passed on the wisdom of his experience to his team-mates in the
depressed locker room after the defeat.
He is certain that Claymores will rebound against the Dragons.
''Someone is going to pay for our loss -- and that's going to be the
team we play today.''
In the cold light of day, it should not be so surprising that
Claymores lost the opener: they were being hailed as champions-elect on
the basis of winning five pre-season, controlled-scrimmage games.
Head coach Jim Criner admitted his team made many mistakes last week,
hinting that the disruption of the sacking of former head coach Lary
Kuharich had a lot to do with it.
One thing Claymores will need if they are to succeed today is to
establish a running game. The lack of a ground attack was noticeable --
mainly because Criner has had to reshape his offensive line, the key to
a good running and passing game -- almost on a weekly basis.
He has been left with the legacy of Kuharich, who dropped a number of
linemen the week before the team arrived in Scotland, and Criner has
been playing catch-up ever since.
Claymores will look for a big game from running back Siran Stacy -- he
was held to only two yards per carry last weekend -- and he and the line
will have to combine to take pressure off the quarterback and receivers,
allowing them to use their passing strategy to more overall effect.
How they come back from last weekend's disappointment in their first
away game will tell us a lot about how Claymores will fare in the rest
of the season, with another tough away fixture in two weeks' time when
they visit Frankfurt.
* VICTOR Ebubedike and quarterback Brad Johnson both ran for
touchdowns and Don Silvestri kicked three field goals as London Monarchs
beat Rhein Fire 23-7 in Dusseldorf at the weekend.

EARLIER this season it looked as though the Scottish rugby team was
going to go through a barren phase the like of which hadn't been seen
since the Irish potato famine. Nine games without a win loomed large,
and all of us -- critics, former players, and even some of the current
senior squad -- were bemoaning the lack of talent and the limited style
of the team itself.
Then came a change in plan, and one man's play blossomed along with
that of the others in a way that few had suspected would happen. Ian
Jardine, the Stirling County centre, thrust his name forward as one of
the most competent centres in the United Kingdom, with a powerful
running style that complemented an ability to hit an opponent's shoulder
and then provide possession for a foraging back row. All that came to an
end with a collision between his cheekbone and a Frenchman's head.
I still remember interviewing him that night when the dent in his
cheek was all too apparent, and he stayed behind as the rest of the team
went to the post-match function. It was enough to make a grown man cry,
and he had done his share.
A painful operation followed, but it was good to hear Bill Hogg's
words that Jardine ''had taken an active part'' in this weekend's squad
session. No soft centres here, as the man in the midfield is back.
''It's been bad not being a part of it for so long,'' says Jardine.
''The SRU have been very helpful in letting Damian Cronin and myself be
as much a part of the squad as possible, inviting us, with wives, to all
of the games.
''They have done their best to keep us involved. But you are never
really one of the boys when you are injured. I will be going to the
Romanian game next weekend, but I've had enough of standing by, so I'll
go to the match but get straight back home afterwards.''
I suspect that Jardine, who, like Gregor Townsend, was becoming a
vital part of the midfield, wants to get back into the fray as soon as
possible and a walk-on part as an injured extra plays no part in his
scheme to get ready for the World Cup.
''I didn't do the full session this weekend,'' he says. ''Like Damian,
I did the warm-up then both of us went away with David McLean for some
fitness work with our two-minute run schedules. Then we rejoined the
boys for the handling stuff.
''I have been doing a lot of fitness work to get ready, but I've had
various little things such as throat infections that have kept me back.
Hopefully, that's all in the past and I can concentrate on the World
Cup.''
Perceived wisdom before his full blossoming as an attacking and
defending centre was that Jardine was a banger. I, to my eternal
ignorance, went along with that. The 29-year-old is big and strong, but
he proved this season that when it came to tackling, he had few peers in
this country, and when it came to making an intelligent break and then
ensuring that someone else was still able to make more ground, no-one in
Scotland could lace his boots.
If Jardine went forward with the ball, then it either came back with a
perfect offload to a back-row man, or a good pass to a fellow back, or
along the ground with control. Before Brouzet's bash in Paris he had
been having his finest hour.
''There was a wee bit of flak when I was picked,'' he says. ''It
seemed to me as if people wanted to criticise, but I knew that I could
always prove the critics wrong.
''Much of that had to do with the game plan devised by Richie Dixon
and Dougie Morgan, in that the game was to be more fluid, and I liked
that. From what I've seen so far, not much will change for the World
Cup.''
First, however, there is the psychological barrier to overcome of
taking knocks on a face that, as a result of the operation, still has
more bits of metal in it than a scrapyard. Jardine may not feel the
pain, but his brain will be telling him that it might be sore to take a
knock, and, as everyone who has been injured knows, it isn't the
physical limitation of an injury that prevents a player going in as he
used to, it is the perceived fragility that the brain invents as a
protection mechanism. He will have to get over that soon.
''I am hoping to take full contact very soon, and then play in games
when we go to Spain in a fortnight's time to get ready for the World
Cup,'' Jardine says. ''It's important that I get over any fears I have,
but I am sure I will. Plus, I have to get as fit as possible, because
the games in South Africa are back-to-back in quick succession and are
at altitude.
''Realistically, it will be very hard over there. So much depends on
how we do in the early games against Tonga and Cote d'Ivoire, plus we
have to beat France to avoid New Zealand in the next round.''
Yes, the World Cup isn't that far away, and Ian Jardine, the man who
has chosen this year to make his mark more than any other, will be out
to prove a point after injury. We wish him well.

ANDY Richards and Ian Park, who are currently chasing England's John
Merricks and Ian Walker, ranked No.1 in the world, for the British place
in the two person 470 dinghy for the next Olympics, convincingly
retained their Scottish 470 title sailing on home waters off Helensburgh
over the weekend.
In perfect conditions, Richards and Park were never challenged as they
laid down the foundations of their successful title defence with two
victories on Saturday.
Their first race start was hampered as a minor gear failure forced
helmsman Richards to effect a running repair at the very front of their
new boat. Having worked their way to second by the second leg they were
helped as erstwhile leaders Nigel Biggs and Marc Turner capsized.
A text book second race saw a clear start. Richards and Park were
ahead by the first mark, and as the only boat to fly a spinnaker as the
wind increased, were over 3 minutes ahead to take first gun. Results:
Race 1: 1. A Richards &amp; I Park (Helensburgh) 2. N Biggs &amp; M Turner
(Pwlhelli) 3. I Boag &amp; A Green (Largs) Race 2. 1. Richards/Park 2.
Biggs/Turner 3. A Stevenson &amp; I Ramsay (Bardowie) Race 3 -- 1,
Richards/Park; 2, Biggs/Turner; 3, Stevenson/Ramsay. Race 4 -- 1,
Richards/Park; 2, Boag/Green; 3, Stevenson/Ramsay. Overall -- 1,
Richards/Park 2.25points; 2, Biggs/Turner 6 points; 3, Boag/Green 9
points.
Helensburgh Regatta -- Overall after three races: Catamarans 1, C
Bryden in a Tornado; 2, S Gray in a Dart. Fast Handicap -- 1, G Homer
(International 14); 2, G Busby (505); 3, W Lee (Contender). Slow
Handicap -- 1, C Reid (Albacore); 2, R Johnston (Laser Radial); 3, C

Scots out of their depth
SWIMMING: By ELSPETH BURNSIDE
THANK goodness for Estonia. Scottish swimming fortunes continued to
plummet yesterday when the team finished fourth out of five at the
Multi-Nations Meet at the Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh.
Finland were the overall winners with Belgium and Switzerland also
finishing clear of the host nation. Only impoverished Estonia, who had
travelled to Edinburgh by bus and were staying in hostel accommodation,
finished below Scotland.
Coming in the wake of the recent announcement of a #1m development
plan, the result was an embarrassment.
Alison Sheppard could be excused criticism as she produced the only
home victory with a time of 26.98sec in the 50 metres free-style and
also contributed one of the three second-places in 58.91 in the 100m.
But Fraser Walker was a disappointment, although he had previously
intimated that he was treating the event as little more than a warm-up
for the European championship trials.
Nicola Steel, by virtue of a disqualification of Finland's Marena
Aimonen, and Andrew Aitken were the other home silver medallists, both
in the 200m back-stroke.

BILL McLAREN at the Hawick Sevens
EXPERT dovetailing by Neil Crooks and John Amos in dealing with
opposition restart kicks created a fertile springboard for Gala as they
amassed a record 163 points in four ties, 59 of them without reply
against Stewart's Melville FP in the final of the Hawick Sevens, which
England's international referee, John Pearson, mercifully brought to an
end three minutes before the scheduled close.
In scoring 25 tries, nine by Mark Moncrieff who blistered the grass
almost every time he had ball and space, Gala simply sailed through the
tournament with a mighty contribution from their captain, Michael Dods,
playmaker, finisher, goal-kicker, and speechmaker, who was the overall
top scorer with four tries and 19 conversions for 58 points.
It was Gala's first win at the Hawick tournament since 1982, and their
fourteenth in all. Seldom before can there have been such a devastating
demonstration of magical interplay as in the final.
They permitted the college only meagre rations and gave what amounted
to an exhibition of ball manipulation, pass improvisation, and intuitive
support running that marks them out as one of the most complete and
gifted short-game combines ever to take the field.
Moncrieff had two tries in each tie except the final when he had
three. Dods had a haul of 20 points as Stirling County were swept aside,
although not before Colin McRobert had demonstrated his electric
acceleration that kept him ahead even of Chris Dalgleish. Gala's 31-7
margin in the semi-final barely reflected the vigorous challenge posed
by GHK, who levelled at 7-7 when Cameron Little whizzed over 60 metres
for a try converted by Steve Hirini.
GHK, however, had to rejig their back division on the injury loss of a
key figure in George Breckenridge, for whom that remarkable 40-year-old
Ken Hamilton deputised -- but as hooker. Lack of familiarity at
scrummage insertion and between a new half back pairing of Cameron
Dunlop (scrum half) and Little when allied to occasional ball
transference lapses by their highly-industrious props, Dominic Mellor
and Scott Hutton, denied GHK a launch base and two tries by Amos from
scrummage then kick-off sealed the issue.
Stewart's Melville FP owed much to a late try and conversion by Fraser
Pollock for their elimination by 21-17 of the Italian Zebras, who had
bags of pace and a powerful figurehead in the Wallaby flanker Julian
Gardner, but were short of Sevens' acumen and cohesion. The college then
squeezed through against Selkirk with a crucial late try from Adrian
Huett, who could trust more in his enviable pace.
In the final, the college lacked the physical presence to upset Gala's
well-balanced forward trio and spent much of the time chasing shadows as
Moncrieff (three), Crooks (two), Dalgleish (two), and Dods (two) were
the try-scorers of which seven were converted by Dods.
So Gala now take the lead in the 'Kings of the Sevens' series with 26
points, Jed-Forest and Stirling County have 22, and Kelso 20. Results:
First round -- Kelso 28, Watsonians 17; Pringle President's Seven 33,
Heriots FP 7; Selkirk 31, Hawick 24; Stewart's-Melville 21, Italian
Zebras 17; Stirling County 24, Langholm 12; Gala 33, Melrose 19;
Jed-Forest 24, Boroughmuir 17; GHK 38, Ulster 12.
Quarter-finals -- Kelso 45, Pringle President's Seven 0;
Stewart's-Melville FP 26, Selkirk 21; Gala 40, Stirling County 17; GHK
19, Jed-Forest 17.
Semi-finals -- Stewart's Melville FP 26, Kelso 14; Gala 31, GHK 7.
Final -- Gala 59, Stewart's Melville FP 0.
Gala -- C S Dalgleish, M Moncrieff; M Dods, G C Farquharson; J P Amos,
I Corcoran, N J Crooks. Replacement -- D W Bolland for Dods, 17 minutes.
Stewart's Melville FP -- A Huett, L Hamilton; F I Pollock, G G Burns;
N J Penny, P N Gallagher, J Conlin.
Referee -- J Pearson (RFU).
* ALAN Bulloch, Hutchesons' Scottish Schools international centre, who
is in Bucharest with the national under-19 team in the FIRA junior
tournament, is to play for Glasgow South in the match against Glasgow

Scotland Under-21 36, Italy Under-21 15
SCOTLAND concluded their programme of under-21 international matches
this season appropriately with a win at Bridgehaugh against Italy. There
is little doubt that this season has produced a healthy crop of under-21
players, more than half of whom will be available for next season at
this age level, and they have achieved for the first time ever a brace
of victories.
That number would have been three but for a lapse of concentration in
the final few minutes against Ireland. Still, when one thinks of the
previous eight years that produced not a single win, there is cause for
optimism.
Much of the under-21s' success has to do with the distinguished trio
in charge. Derrick Grant, the manager, David Leslie the senior coach,
and John Rutherford, the assistant coach, represent a wealth of
experience and an inspirational presence for any aspiring youngster.
Despite their sizeable margin of victory, Grant was realistic about
the Scots performance. ''We took our chances at the beginning of the
first and second halves, but I was very disappointed that we did not
press home our advantage. Perhaps we had a surfeit of ball for a spell
and did not use it wisely.''
But Grant, being very much a players' manager, spoke of the difficulty
for his young charges: ''It is really almost out of season. We're into
sevens rugby and as such we had a hard job getting the boys back and
focused into 15-a-side rugby again. In addition, the hard ground made
for a looser type of game and I think some of the players started to
think they would get their names on the score sheet.''
Some inevitably did; notably Colin Morley on the left wing, who ran in
two tries, the first the result of a clever back-row move and crisp
passing on the narrow side, and the second from a charge-down of a kick
in the opening minute of the second half. Morley, who is well thought of
at Bath, looked the part when he chose to run with the ball and is a
player who should not be allowed to disappear off the books.
Equally incisive was Matt McGrandles, who confirmed his reputation as
one of Scotland's most exciting young centres, while at stand-off the
experience of Duncan Hodge was crucial. ''Duncan gave us a definite
edge,'' said Grant. ''He invariably took the right options.''
Up front, Graham Dall again led by example, setting up the try for his
back-row colleague Tam McVie and then scoring early in the second half
with a try from a quickly taken tap penalty after Hodge, who kicked four
penalties and two conversions, had been high tackled.
The Scotland management would be pleased, too, with the performance of
Paul Jennings and Ian Elliot in the lineout with assistance from Stuart
Grimes, the Edinburgh University blind-side flanker, the last-named a
player who could find himself the subject of interest from
first-division clubs in the close season.
The Scots would be annoyed that they let Italy -- who at one stage
trailed 33-3 -- back into the game. Italy, playing together for the
first time this season, lacked overall consistency and technical skill,
but in patches revealed some silky skills behind the scrum -- notably at
stand-off and full back -- that produced a couple of tries for
replacement wing Riccardo Marchetti, one of these converted by full back
Andrea Pavin. Italy's other points came from a first-half drop goal from
stand-off Corrado Pilat.
Scotland -- P Flockhart (Stewart's Melville FP); H Gilmour (Heriot's
FP), M McGrandles (Stirling County), C Murray (Hawick), C Morley (Bath);
D Hodge (Watsonians), A Featherstone (Morgan FP); M McCluskie (Edinburgh
Academicals), G Bulloch (West of Scotland), B Stewart (Edinburgh
Academicals), I Elliot (Hawick), P Jennings (Boroughmuir), S Grimes
(Edinburgh University), T McVie (Edinburgh Academicals), G Dall
(Heriot's FP).
Italy -- A Pavin (Paese); L Gorla (Sandrio), A Lomasto (Partenope), T
Visentin (Treviso), V Marrano (Roma) replaced by R Marchetti (Padova) 52
mins; C Pilat (Bologna), L Martin (Padova) replaced by G Mazzi (Roma) 54
mins; F Guidetti (Parma), A Comperti (L'Aquila), S Saviozzi (Livorno), A
Gritti (Bologna), F Gumiero (San Dona), F Piovan, D Bezzati, R Rampazzo
(all Padova).

YOUNG Scots are increasingly reluctant to commit themselves to home
ownership, one of Scotland's leading property firms has claimed.
In its quarterly report published yesterday, Slater Hogg &amp; Howison,
painted a patchy picture of the property market in the central belt.
The company's sales director, Stuart Black, said mid-market
properties, ranging in price from #60,000 to #90,000 were selling
fastest but potential homeowners were anxious that house prices
represented value for money.
''The house buying public are extremely sensitive to anything
over-priced. Accordingly an accurate asking price is the most vital
starting point for a sale.
''If a property is even marginally above the going rate it will not
receive interest or viewers.''
He said there was a shortage of three-bedroom properties available to
the second-time buyer and consumers were showing a reluctance to tie
themselves to expensive, luxury properties. Those in the 20 to 30
years-old age group also appeared to be eschewing homeownership for the
rented sector.
Mr Black also pointed to considerable regional differences. He said
while the market was booming in Kirkcaldy there was a shortage of
mid-market homes for sale in Edinburgh, the west end of Glasgow and Ayr.

<HEADLINE>Fife firm adopts new ownership plan Tullis Russell to distribute shares to workforce</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>MICHAEL SMITH</BYLINE>

FAMILY businesses often have a commitment to the communities in which
they have grown, providing local employment and wealth. But what happens
when, after several generations, the family owners want to withdraw
their stake? Can they do so without jeopardising the company's
independence and local loyalties? Are selling out or a public flotation,
with all the risks of take-over, rationalisation and redundancies, the
only routes?
One alternative is to make the workers the owners through an employee
share ownership plan (ESOP). The concept, pioneered by the John Lewis
and Baxi partnerships, was given a boost in the 1994 Finance Act. It
extended the number of years from seven to 20 that an ESOP can transfer
shares to the workforce without incurring tax penalties, till now a
deterrent.
Among the first companies to take advantage of the new legislation is
the Fife paper makers Tullis Russell, based at Markinch. The company is
pioneering one of Britain's first statutory ESOPs. During the next 10 to
15 years, the company will distribute shares to the 1200-strong
workforce through an annual profit-sharing bonus and two trusts set up
to benefit the employees.
When complete, around 2009, the workers will own a third of the
company and 45% of the shares will be held by an Employee Benefit Trust.
A quarter will remain in the charitable Russell Trust, set up by the
family owners in 1947 to guarantee the company's independence.
Tullis Russell, dating back to 1809, has been owned by the Russell
family for four generations. Sir David Russell, who became chairman in
the early 1930s, had a strong paternalistic commitment to the workforce
and the community they represented. The company has since expanded to
include four plants in Britain, with sales companies in France, Germany,
and Connecticut in the US. It is one of Europe's leading independent
quality paper manufacturers.
Sir David's grandson, David Erdal, 48, has been chairman since 1985.
He was keen to maintain the firm's ethos of community involvement, and
was attracted to the idea of employee ownership at a time when other
family members wanted to extract their capital in order to support their
other business activities.
On becoming chairman, Mr Erdal instituted a profit-sharing scheme 10
years ago, whereby 7.5% of the profits are used to distribute shares
annually to the workforce. Thirty percent of the shares go equally to
all the employees while 70% are allocated according to income.
Last year, Tullis Russell, with the help of Edinburgh merchant bank
Noble Grossart, set up the new statutory ESOP as part of a major capital
reorganisation. Around 25 family members surrendered their remaining 55%
stake, worth #19m, in exchange for loan notes. These will be redeemed
during the next 10 to 15 years and converted into shares for the
workforce as the money becomes available to buy them through the annual
profit sharing bonus.
The shares will be distributed by the new statutory Employee Share
Ownership Trust. An existing Employee Benefit Trust will act as a market
maker for workers to trade their shares, while also building up a
substantial long-term holding to provide stability for the whole
enterprise.
The scheme, building on the profit sharing bonus, depends on good
annual results. The 1993-94 pre-tax profit was #4.2m on sales of #101m,
and Erdal is confident of improving figures in the years ahead.
Could the family have got a higher price by selling out to a
competitor? Mr Erdal denies there is an element of philanthropy in the
ESOP plan. ''The net benefit to the family would not have been
necessarily higher because the legislation gives significant tax
advantages when you sell to the employees,'' he says. But he adds:
''Owning a company is different from owning any other piece of property.
You can sell a table and it doesn't affect anyone. But if you own a
company you are involved in a community of people.'' Passing over the
power that goes with ownership ''without paying attention to the
interests of the people in that community,'' is irresponsible, he says.
''You have to take the interests of the employees very seriously
indeed.''
The new ESOP satisfies Mr Erdal's own ideals. A Marxist in his youth,
until a spell teaching in Mao's China during the Cultural Revolution
disillusioned him, he has long since held that a competitive free market
is the best system for allocating goods and services: ''It is completely
honest. You buy the best products and services at the lowest price and
there is no hypocrisy in it.''
But he speaks passionately against what he sees as unjust systems of
ownership. Those who already own an asset, like a family business, have
the collateral to borrow money for new investment, he says. They then
receive tax breaks designed to encourage investment. But this serves to
concentrate wealth in the hands of those who already have it. Non-owning
employees all too easily remain in a subservient relationship, he
argues.
Back from China, Mr Erdal joined the family firm at the age of 29,
encouraged by his late uncle, Dr David Russell, the then chairman. At
first, admits Mr Erdal, he didn't feel ''legitimate'' coming in just
because he was a family member. But gaining his MBA at Harvard Business
School gave him confidence, he says. He had spells on the shop floor and
in export sales before joining the board in 1981.
His uncle had put voting control of the company into the charitable
Russell Trust at a time when he had no obvious heir apparent. Managers,
rather than family members, were appointed trustees with the charge of
keeping the company independent and serving the interests of the
employees.
The obvious way of doing this, as Mr Erdal's relatives wanted to
withdraw their stake, was to set up the ESOP. Mr Erdal was particularly
influenced, he says, by visiting the Mondragon co-operatives in Spain,
inspired by a Roman Catholic priest in the early 1950s. There the
emphasis was based on the social doctrine of the Catholic church that
capital should serve labour rather than the other way round.
Another input came from Mr Erdal's participation in Moral Re-Armament
business conferences in Switzerland on moral values for the market
economy.
Now he is taking the gospel of ESOPs to Eastern Europe. Through Job
Ownership, a company which advises on employee ownership, he and its
executive director, Robert Oakeshott, are helping seven companies in
Slovenia to get ready for privatisation into majority employee
ownership.
Back home in Fife, the workforce at Tullis Russell, initially
suspicious, are now enthusiastic about the idea of becoming their own
owners. Mr Erdal estimates that, on the firm's projected performance,
share-owning employees stand to be, on average, about #16,000 better off
over the next 10 to 15 years.
Tullis Russell has given a boost to the concept of employee ownership
which other family businesses may find increasingly attractive. But Mr
Erdal is modest about his own role.
''The story is so much more important than any individual,'' he says.
''My challenge was how to run the company in the interests of the
employees.'

SCOTLAND'S fact-finding mission in the hitherto untested waters of the
Junior Rugby World Cup is likely to be repeated. The SRU's director of
rugby, Jim Telfer, has been a keen observer of the tournament in
Bucharest for the past 10 days and he has been impressed with what he
has seen.
''I don't think that once you have dipped your toe in the water you
can take it out again just because the water is a wee bit hot,'' he said
yesterday.
The competition, which has been run every year since 1969, is
organised under the FIRA banner and for the first time drew entries from
Home Unions sides in the form of Scotland and Wales.
Since his appointment as the SRU's first director of rugby Telfer has
been an influential exponent of the theory that, if the game in Scotland
is to prosper, then Scottish sides have to test themselves against the
best.
Yesterday in Bucharest the former Scotland and British Lions back-row
forward and coach declared: ''This tournament has been very successful
indeed. Scotland's game against Romania today was typical of the kind of
match that Scottish teams must learn to play, under hot conditions in
front of a sometimes hostile crowd and far away from home.
''I don't think that I have ever been involved in such an intense
tournament as this, with four international matches played within the
space of six days.
''There is a danger in Britain that we become far too incestuous. To
develop as a rugby nation we have to branch out and not just play
against each other.''
Telfer said that when he returned to Murrayfield he would be
recommending that the FIRA experiment be continued and that he would
suggest, too, that Scotland apply to host the tournament at some point
in the future.
Over the past 10 days the 26 youngsters in the Scottish party have
been under the closest scrutiny. Privately, some of the boys reckon that
they have been just a little overawed at the prospect of going through
their paces in front of such rugby luminaries as manager David Sole and
Telfer. However, the director of coaching considers that this is no bad
thing.
''When you come away on tour everybody is judged. Some will come
through the experience and some will fall by the wayside. The quicker we
find out who is going to fall then the better it is for the Scottish
game.
''The good thing about taking a squad of youngsters away is -- and I
don't mean this derogatively -- that it gets them away from their
mothers and fathers. They really grow up as rugby players and as young
men.''
Telfer was full of praise for the manner in which the young Scots have
conducted themselves in Romania.
''They have been a credit to their country. Off the field there has
been no bad behaviour, and good manners counts for a lot. It doesn't
cost anything to say please and thank you.''
Scotland won two of their four games -- beating Russia and Spain and
losing to Argentina and Romania -- and, while Telfer would have
preferred three wins, he still considers the exercise to have been
immensely worthwhile.
In fact, so impressed has he been that there is a possibility that the
FIRA experience could be extended to other Scottish representative
sides.
Since his appointment, Scottish sides at all levels -- schools,
under-19, under-21 -- have begun to experience the winning habit and
this can only be good for the long-term development of the game in
Scotland.
FIRA, which for long enough has been seen as a French-dominated
alternative to the International Rugby Board, is delighted that Scotland
and Wales have taken part in this year's Junior World Cup, and this in
spite of the fact that Scotland finished sixth and Wales ninth.
Their thinking is that to have such established rugby nations on board
can only enhance the credibility of the competition. Interestingly, the
French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset, who last month was
elected chairman of the International Board, and FIRA's Albert Ferrasse,
were spectators at Scotland's game against Romania yesterday.
In the past, among die-hard traditionalists, membership of FIRA might
have been seen as being in some way incompatible with the standing of a
founder member of the IB like Scotland.
However, Telfer does not expect any difficulties in this quarter. If
Scotland were to apply to host the tournament at some point in the near
future -- Italy is the likely venue next year -- then FIRA membership
would be a prerequisite. ''It is for the committee to decide, but I
would not have thought that it would be a great problem for us to join
FIRA,'' declared Telfer.
Over the past 10 days the entire Scottish party has had to negotiate a
very steep learning curve. They have done battle against sides of which
very little was known.
The Scots youngsters successfully came through a baptism of fire in
their opening game against Russia, after which three Russians were
suspended for brutal foul play, and the very next day came up against an
extremely proficient Argentinian outfit that was good enough to reach
the final. Next came Spain, and the Scots played some fine rugby against
a handy enough side.
Yesterday, against Romania in Bucharest, they just ran out of steam
and ideas. They will all, though, return home much the better for the
experience.

THE decision by Moody's, the US rating agency, to strip Canada of its
much-vaunted triple A credit rating last week sends a message to
Canadians and their Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, that the country must
do more to curb its huge domestic debt.
Canada's budget deficits, both at the federal as well as at the
provincial level have been well above the average recorded by the Group
of Seven countries. Canada is a member of the G7.
New-York-based Moody's cut the domestic currency rating to AA1 from
AAA on concerns that Canada's debt was still too big despite recent
draconian budget cuts undertaken by Mr Chretien's Government.
Moody's also downgraded Canada's foreign currency debt rating to AA2
from AA1.
Without mentioning the recent Mexican crisis, Moody's noted that
highly indebted countries are now particularly susceptible to sharp
swings in international capital flows resulting from shifting investor
sentiment.
The downgrade effectively removes Canada from the top grade of
sovereign investment and could force some investment funds to sell off
Canadian Government bonds if they are not permitted to hold anything
rated less than triple A.
Canadian Government officials said that despite the downgrade, the
country's economic fundamentals remain sound. Unemployment is slowly
receding as Canada enjoys a boom in exports, mainly to its traditional
market, the United States.
The Canadian inflation rate is at its lowest point since anybody can
remember although some analysts predict that it will rise in concert
with US inflation later this year.
So far there has been no meltdown in Canada's financial markets. They
have remained stable, having factored in the rate cut, which was
rumoured for weeks, and because the Quebec separatist movement appears
to be in disarray over when to hold a referendum on independence.
In recent weeks, concern that the mainly French-speaking province of
Quebec might hold a spring referendum has badly dented the Canadian
dollar, which has lost ground to the American greenback and sterling.
Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau has postponed what he calls ''the
moment of truth'' at least until the autumn but Lucien Bouchard, leader
of the pro-independence Bloc Populaire in the federal parliament, said
the vote should be put off for three or four years to give the
separatists a better chance to win.
There are growing indications that if the referendum were to be held
this year pro-federalist forces would carry the day by a comfortable
margin. The Quebec economy has improved in recent months and that has
apparently dulled separatist passions.
Mr Parizeau's decision gives Mr Chretien some breathing space to
tackle the country's economic problems which have been swept off the
front pages of Canadian newspapers by the ''fish war'' with Spain.
Mr Chretien, speaking in Calgary, Alberta, last week, avoided
mentioning the Moody downgrades. Instead, he talked about the merits of
his Government's February budget, which aims to reduce public debt to
les than 3% of the country's gross domestic product by 1996-97.
''We'll probably be at a balanced budget before (Newt) Gingrich in the
United States,'' he said, referring to the Republican House Leader known
for his tough stands against government spending.
''But in order to do that, we have to follow a plan and not create
expectations that cannot be met.''
When the budget was brought down by Finance Minister Paul Martin, it
was described by the US magazine Business Week as a ''bold bid to
rebuild international confidence'' in Canada's economy. Moody's,
however, has not been impressed.
It said that despite Ottawa's ''aggressive corrective actions'' it was
still difficult to forecast Canada's medium and long-term outlook.
''The overall size of the public sector debt is such that any
deviation from a medium-term stabilisation programme, however temporary,
could have very negative financial consequences,'' Moody's said.
David Bloom, an analyst with James Capel, also struck a sceptical
note: ''We question the ability of the Government to achieve expenditure
cuts on the scale proposed.''
While Mr Martin announced plans to cut about $C25bn from spending over
three years in its budget, the total debt load is still forecast to rise
to $C603bn by 1997. This figure do not include provincial debt, which in
some cases is climbing at a quick pace.
The budget also calls for the elimination of 45,000 federal jobs, cuts
to the budget of the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
reductions in grants given to the provinces to help pay for health care
and other social programmes, and fewer subsidies for dairy farmers. The
privatisation of Canadian National Railways and a 70% stake in
Petro-Canada, a national petroleum company, was also announced.
The swingeing nature of the cuts surprised some observers because many
of Canada's expensive social programmes were put in place by Liberal
administrations in the 1960s and '70s headed by Lester Pearson and
Pierre Trudeau.
Mr Chretien, a street-wise politician from the Quebec industrial town
of Shawinigan and a close associate of Mr Trudeau, is taking big
political risks by cutting funds for Canada's European-style social
programmes. Although his Government is more than three years away from
an election, opposition to the cuts is building.
''We have lost control of our economy because so much debt is owned by
foreigners,'' said Maude Barlow, a prominent nationalist and leader of a
movement opposed to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some
Canadians blame for many of their country's economic ills.
''We are being forced to harmonise our social programmes down to US
standards.''
In a move to protest against federal sackings, the Public Service
Alliance, the biggest union representing civil servants and other
federal employees, has voted to conduct a work-to-rule campaign that
reduce the national bureaucracy to a snail's pace.
Mr Chretien is in a difficult position. He will have to rein in
government spending to please the markets -- especially those in the
United States -- a move that is likely to be unpopular with many
Canadians who do not want to see their social safety net shredded. As
tempers begin to rise, he could face a summer sizzling with protest and
an even hotter autumn.

THE business of autographs can be a bit of a chore for footballers, as
Alex McLeish discovered recently. Big Eck was staying at the Westpoint
Hotel in East Kilbride while pursuing his career as manager of
Motherwell (The Westpoint is quite a popular place with footballers,
other guests having included that big Dutch fella with the long name who
plays for Celtic).
Also staying at the Westpoint at the same time as McLeish were Take
That, apparently a popular music singing group of some fame and
notoriety with younger female members of society.
Big Eck was deputed by junior members of his clan to secure the
autographs of the Take That personnel. He duly approached a senior
member of the hotel staff to ask if the request be passed on.
The hotel management had regretfully to decline Big Eck's request on
the grounds that they did not like their guests to be bothered. Later
that evening, McLeish was relaxing in the hotel bar when who should
enter but the personnel of Take That.
The young men, being football fans, spotted that a star was in their
midst. Totally breaking the rules, they approached McLeish for a spot of
hero worship, who was quite happy to indulge in a bit of
autograph-swopping.
* AN interesting insight into the world of boxing could be gained from
the recent Desert Islands Discs interview between Sue Lawley and Frank
Bruno. Sue asked about Frank's habit of praying before each fight.
Frank Bruno: ''I always have believed in God . . . because my mum used
to force me to church. Beat me up, and send me to her church . . .''
Sue Lawley: ''She was very strict, your mum?''
Frank: ''I think my dad was stricter.''
Sue: ''Did he beat you?''
Frank: ''Beat me? He beat me black and blue . . . but I deserved it. I
wish he would have beat me a little bit more, might have beaten some
sense into me.''
Sue: ''What did he beat you with?''
Frank: ''He beat me with the curtain rail, his shoes, the belt, his
hands. He really did steam into me, but it was a good cause he steamed
into me for. He wouldn't just beat me for the sake of beating me, but I
was really out of order. I mean I was big for my age and I thought I
could throw my weight around. So I went to my boarding school and got
beaten up so badly that I knocked it on the head.''
* ANOTHER point of view on the noble art of punching your opponent
senseless, this time from none other a gentle soul than Reg Kray, who
wrote to Boxing News recently from an address in Maidstone, Kent.
Reg wrote: ''I can speak from personal experience that boxing does
keep kids out of trouble. When my brothers and I were in the ring, the
sport gave us self-discipline.
''When we were training for a fight we would go to bed as early as
nine o'clock in the evenings and we never used to drink or smoke. We
would go running through the back streets of east London in the early
hours. Contrary to general belief, boxing kept us out of trouble.''
Reg continued: ''One time my brother Ron had the gloves on with Rolly
Blyce, the featherweight champion of Trinidad, and they fought so
fiercely they had to be pulled apart at the end of the round -- but that
did not stop them shaking hands afterwards.''
He lets us know that he still keeping in touch with boxing while a
guest of Her Majesty: ''I have met Nigel Benn. He is a gentleman and a
good ambassador for boxing. He came to Nottingham jail to do a circuit
in the gym for charity in aid of children. We spoke and had a photo
taken together and I gave him a pair of punchbag gloves in tribute.''
Punchbag gloves presumably being easy to come by in prisons these days.
* WE know that Super Ally, still the Greatest Living Ranger despite
all the worshipping of Norse God Laudrup, has not played many games of
late, but it is surely too early to confine the fresh-faced laddie to
history. But they are in East Kilbride.
A play called the Incomplete History of East Kilbride was recently put
on in the local theatre. Among characters who feature are Robert the
Bruce, Bonnie Prince Charlie, Napoleon (he must have been exiled there
before Elba and St Helena), George Orwell, and Ally McCoist.
Even more worrying was an advert in The Herald's articles for sale
column. Under the heading antiques, do we not find: " Rangers FC oil
base portrait, Ally McCoist, #150."

CELTIC midfielder Peter Grant is the kind of player who is never at a
loss for a word or 10 -- either on or off the field.
He takes some ribbing from his team-mates for his chat shows, but to
the media Grant is always a welcome figure, ready to speak in victory or
defeat and, unlike so many others in the game with inflated ideas of
their importance, always ready to venture an opinion.
He did so after the Pittodrie game at the weekend, and talked as much
sense as anyone has done so far about the toll relegation could exact
this season on the premier division if two of the ''major'' clubs go
down.
''We cannot afford to lose Aberdeen or Hearts or Dundee United from
the premier division,'' he remarked. ''No competition would want to see
clubs with really good players suddenly disappear.
''But sometimes it is not enough just to have quality players. You
need more than that. For a start, you must have consistency, because the
league is not only about what is happening to clubs now, it is about
what they have done, or failed to do, over the entire season.
''You have to have guts to add to skill, and Partick Thistle are
proving that point with their results right now.''
Then Grant added the most significant note of all when he pointed out:
''No-one has a divine right to play in the premier division. At Celtic,
over the past six years, we have seen that you don't have a divine right
to win trophies. The same goes for the bigger clubs who are in trouble
at the bottom of the league.
''If they are to stay in the top 10, then they have to earn that
place.''
Grant's observations were offered as a general view. But, in reality,
it applied particularly to the New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United,
whose successes in the eighties under Alex Ferguson and Jim McLean
undermined the domination of Glasgow's Old Firm of Rangers and Celtic.
Both northern clubs are now under threat, and while Aberdeen fans left
Pittodrie celebrating a 2-0 over Celtic, they appeared to forget that
they remain rooted at the bottom of the table. All that happened was
that they gained ground on luckless United and saw Hearts hauled back
into the relegation equation.
There is far more hard work to be done before Aberdeen are in the
clear. And United are in a similar position. Both clubs have matches
tomorrow, at Fir Park and Firhill respectively, which could be decisive,
and their opponents will not be overly impressed by reputations carved
out more than a decade ago.
The supporters at Pittodrie and Tannadice have to come to terms with
that. As Grant points out, there is no divine right to success for
anyone.
If you look at the records of the two clubs -- and take away the glory
they enjoyed for short spells under Ferguson and McLean -- then you can
put things properly into perspective.
Neither of the two is any better or any worse than Dundee, who have
spent the years since reconstruction shuttling between the premier
division and the first division.
If either goes down they could fall into a similar scenario, scraping
to make ends meet as gates plummet, struggling to persuade players to
join them in their diminished status, and having to sell their good
players simply to survive.
That is what the players at both clubs should be looking at. It is
also the cruel truth that the supporters must accept. There is no use
pretending that it cannot happen to clubs who once graced Europe. It
can.
It has happened before. To Dundee. To Kilmarnock. To Hearts. To
Dunfermline. To St Johnstone, even, who enjoyed decent runs in Europe
when the late Willie Ormond was there as manager.
Aberdeen and Dundee United are not some kind of protected species
because, for a spell, they took on the Old Firm and defeated them.
That all remains in the dear, departed past. Today their exploits in
the eighties cannot save them. All that can carry them to safety is a
commitment to the cause, a positive attitude to go along with their
undoubted individual skills, and a realisation of what awaits them if
they fail.
Both clubs are looking into the abyss and both have to recognise that
if they go down then they might never get back to the exalted status
they have enjoyed in the domestic game, and even on the Continent.
In their remaining four games they also have to remember what Peter
Grant said at the weekend, because no-one has that divine right to
success, or even a right to a place in the premier division.
No-one who admired their achievements would want to see them slide
into a lower division. But unless they face up to their present-day
reponsibilities and refuse to allow themselves to be soothed into some
kind of false security by deeds from the past, that is what will happen.

A BIT unfortunate really that the Cartha Rugby Sevens took place on
Easter Saturday, for Easter is a moveable feast and lots more people are
actually going away at Easter-time, courtesy of the extra week's school
holidays, and Cartha -- the title derives from Cricket, Athletics,
Rugby, Tennis, and Hockey Association, and also their association with
the old Queen's Park school -- organises its sevens day on the same day
every year so there were rather less spectators than one would have
expected on a sunny Saturday when the nicest exemplar of sport is
enacted on the green sward of Dumbreck in Glasgow. How's that for a long
sentence?
But a sentence which had to be made for rugby sevens really is a
splendid thing. It is a day out and a social occasion. Few sports, if
any, can match the family nature of rugby and the clubs. Girlfriends and
wives, and sons and daughters, and auld yins and wee yins are all
welcome at the rugby and rugby knows it.
The past few years, with the increasing interest in mini-rugby, has
meant that more kids and mums and dads are involved. This is just as
well because schools rugby hardly exists outside of the pockets of
private schools and the state ones in the Borders. This is a great shame
because, if you don't mind me saying so, rugby is grand for big lads who
cannae play soccer, and there's a calumny for big lads.
There remains a calumny for rugby too: girls aren't allowed,
virtually, to play it. I know I increasingly carp on this but the fact
is that I spoke to two lassies, Angela Sherlock from Holyrood, and
Kirsten Laughlin of Our Lady of The Rosary, whose dads Denis and Jimmy
are both keen players, and they will not be getting any rugby at all
until, as Cartha president Alan Irons told me, they can build two new
dressing-rooms.
If this again sounds like my hobby horse, why not? There is something
absurd about promoting sport for all when it clearly isn't and half the
population are damn near denied it. Women's and girls' rugger is an
entirely different game from the male version but none the worse for
that. Hobby horse or not I am right at that and, though rugby does
better, it doesn't do well enough at ensuring that women and girls are
developed -- och, you know what I mean!
My own old club, Allan Glens, proved a little bit of a disappointment.
They lost 25-5 to a stronger Cambuslang side. Glens' Scott Henderson,
who, like me, is a wee bit baldy, provided a wonderful try when his legs
got the better of the country chaps, and young Jamie Toner played well.
Jim McParland, Glens' captain, and ex-St Mungo boy, expressed his dismay
at the result by buying me drink and enjoying the after-match
entertainment. Cambuslang, incidentally, didn't even get through to the
semi-finals and the tournament was won for the second year in a row by
Grangemouth, who beat Lenzie, another strong side. Frankly, nobody
worried much about losing for this is meant to be, and is, fun.
What was a bit upsetting is that East Kilbride called off, as did
Glasgow University. Nobody beefed too greatly about it. But I will. You
screw up tournaments by doing this. It's a bit like not turning up for
your hotel booking: the hotel loses and so do the people who have been
refused rooms.
In short, it's damned selfish and I hope both clubs have a decent
excuse. Especially as the sevens in every club is a big day out for the
people who support the basis of the game.
Most of the clubs organise the sevens as a picnic more than anything
else. The pies, again, were wonderful and, thank you, Jennifer, for
serving us all with alacrity and good humour. You certainly needed the
good humour considering the amount of weans, and even big weans, you
were shoving drinks across to.
The point about the sevens is that it is not mad with the competition.
It is insane with the splendour of a good day out.
But there is more than that. Rugby, once thought of as a sport for a
handful of Borderers and a number of fee-paying schoolboys, has become a
very egalitarian game, indeed. It is played at an entirely sporting and
amateur level, (outside of the increasingly professional aspects of the
international matches which are held in contempt by the true Corinthians
of rugby football at the splendid level I was party to on Saturday).
Cartha has organised a whole week of rugby -- it advertised the event
as a Festival of Rugby. The annual sevens will be rounded off by the
mini-rugby next Saturday, at one o'clock at their Dumbreck Road ground.
They boast, and they are right too, that there will be players aged
from eight to 80 over the week. But there's more than that. On a spring
day with the sun throwing shadows and the Pimms going for the girls in
summer frocks and the children squawking like geese against the sky and
myself and my brother Brian, (he's the one who never played rugger),
greeting at Glens' ignominy, what more do you want from a sport? Ach,
victory would be nice for my alma mater.

People who enjoy the test card and its singular brand of music have
joined in celebration.
TONY CURRIE enjoys a weekend with a difference
SINCE the late forties BBC Television has rolled out a constant stream
of specially recorded music from a variety of sources -- Canada, the
continent, house orchestras -- providing many hours of background
instrumental music, much of it very pleasant. But could anyone have
predicted that almost half a century later, a quarterly publication
running to 50-odd pages, with a circulation of around 100 and an annual
convention attracting over 50 participants from all over the UK would
have emerged in celebration -- under the banner ''The Test Card
Circle''?
No kidding. The party faithful at last weekend's convention in the
picturesque English market town of Leominster included broadcast
engineers, a policeman, an ITV announcer, a photographer, a couple of
housewives, and a piano teacher to name just a few of those for whom a
weekend spent watching the test card and listening to its singular brand
of instrumental music (don't dare call it ''muzak'' or you'll be shot
down in flames) is considered the high spot of their year. Well, one of
them anyway.
The Test Card Circle was celebrating its sixth annual convention,
where snaps of test cards and lists of music are exchanged and (most
important of all) where each can convince the other that the burden of
their slightly eccentric passion is one which they do not shoulder
alone.
It was in 1988 that two such lone devotees met up. Edinburgh music
teacher and concert pianist Stuart Montgomery made contact with
Midlands-based composer and musical director Paul Sawtell, and after
their initial astonishment that anyone could have the same devotion to
the seemingly bland background music that played away behind the
unmoving test image, set about bringing together similar wandering
souls.
A flood of memories gushed forth, in response to letters to newspapers
and trade press. After the flood, the society was formed and a magazine
launched to keep the members of the circle in touch. For the majority,
the main interest is the music played behind the captions or slides --
hundreds of hours of it on the two BBC channels, ITV, and Channel 4
since 1947 -- but for a handful there is even a critical appreciation of
the television graphics too.
Peter Bowgett, an accountant from Blackpool, is now in the process of
writing a book charting the complete history of the engineers' favourite
patterns, and the unique hobby has been the subject of everything from
the Richard and Judy show on daytime TV to a Radio 4 documentary over
the past six years.
So what is it about the test card that yields such continuing
pleasure? Stuart Montgomery describes it as a solitary pursuit from the
age of five: ''Following the daily trade test transmissions became a
magnificent obsession, a powerful influence on my life, something I
wanted to tell everyone about. Alas, no-one was interested -- or so I
thought.''
Discs were not ''not commercially available''. This brush-off from the
Beeb, coming for most during childhood or teenage years, created an
adult determination to acquire these youthful objects of desire.
And the music has a comfort value, too. In the days before
round-the-clock, multichannel telly, a child off school with flu would
have practically nothing else but test card transmissions to view before
5pm on any channel. With the same tunes repeated daily for years on end,
it's little wonder that hearing them again 30-odd years later creates a
certain warm nostalgic glow.
Equally, when colour began in the late sixties, BBC2's daily rota of
some 150 trade test colour films shown hourly during the daytime clearly
stuck firmly in the memories of the impressionable. For now many Test
Card Circle members seek prints or tapes of charming cinematic gems that
are proudly shown at their conventions like Run Away To Sea, The Home
Made Car and Journey into the Weald of Kent.
ITV made up its test transmissions meanwhile from commercially
available records, and during the fifties and sixties provided a welcome
showcase for the well-known orchestras of Mantovani, Stanley Black, Herb
Alpert, Bert Kaempfert, Henry Mancini -- not to mention Dudley Moore.
Then a change of policies in the seventies made ITV's test card
transmissions the first introduction to classical music for a surprising
number of viewers, and a popular forerunner of Classic FM. With
carefully chosen selections of some of the finest recordings of the
time, Beethoven, Grieg, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, and many more could be
heard at the same time each day, free from the distracting interruptions
of announcers, commercials, news, or indeed any speech whatsoever, and
often accompanied by the soothing selection of colour slides of British
scenes thoughtfully provided by Kodak. Remember that lovely view of
Iona?
Indeed, the only flies in this soothing musical ointment were the
interruptions every half-hour for four minutes of tone and the even more
unwelcome breaks for programmes. But some circle members got so booked
on this drug that they have built their own gadgets to generate
electronically the noise, and sit for periods at home listening to a
loud and steady note of 440Hz . . . (Oh, gangway, please!)
The UK circle is a relatively gentle congregation of folk, dedicated
to their music. Their equivalents in Austria are not. When ORF, the
state television service recently announced that their programmes would
now fill 24 hours a day, thereby banishing the brief lunchtime hour of
test card transmission, television journalist Teddy Podgorski formed a
placard-wielding protest group who marched on Vienna's television
centre, no less.
They lost their battle last month, but Podgorski has now arranged for
the Austrian test card to be available on Internet, so computer-using
test card fans the world over can now tune in to it round the clock.
Not surprisingly this is one of the news stories in the latest issue
of the UK circle's magazine -- they're already at no 18 -- which also
boasts reviews and listings of trade test films and a detailed log of
which tapes of Christmas music were played by the BBC over the festive
period.
There's a jolly atmosphere throughout the weekend in the cosy Royal
Oak Hotel where the Test Card Circle Convention is in progress.
All-night sessions watching and listening to videotapes of rare items
like the BSB test card; watching compilations of intervals between
schools programmes long passed and listening again to half-hour tapes of
music that used to be heard two or three times a day, every day on BBC
Television is hard to describe.
It's all too easy for a non-participant to take the mickey, yet if you
took away the pictures and substituted a pile of rare discs of folk
music, or jazz, in this carefree, convivial environment you'd be the one
considered odd if you dared to laugh.

I would like to try to correct the impression given in your report on
the Scottish Schools v Irish Schools match (April 10) that the blame for
the Scottish defeat could be laid at the door of a boy who scored two
tries and set up a third.
There may, indeed, have been ''those at Balgray'' who were indulging
in the time-honoured Scottish custom of searching for faults in a player
of rare talent, but the vast majority of the crowd were clear that the
main reason for Scotland's defeat was their inability to get the ball to
James Craig more quickly and more often.
John Beattie wrote in The Herald last week of the number of boys who
give up rugby after leaving school; constructive, rather than
destructive, criticism of boys of this age is more likely to encourage
them to continue playing.
Craig has had an outstanding season for school, district, and country.
He will, I am sure, go on to even greater things as a senior rugby
player.
Phil Crampsey, First XV Coach, St Aloysius' College, Glasgow. * WITH
respect to your reader, J B Clements (Letters, April 10), it seems that
every human has had a go at Rangers in the past/present about their
signings.
As Mr Clements claims that he knows the ''religion'' of Rangers
signings it begs the question, who is the bigot?
If he is an expert on the religions of players, could he enlighten the
otherwise uninterested readers as to the number of ''non-Catholics'' who
have been signed by, for example, Celtic, from Billy McNeil to the
present time. Or is his releigious fanaticism only vented on one team.
Interested.
Name and address supplied.
* J B Clements (Letters, April 10) appears to be remarkably well
informed about the internal workings of Rangers Football Club. If he is
privy to such confidential information as the religious affiliations (or
lack of them) of the current Ibrox playing staff, perhaps he would like
to share this knowledge with the rest of us and if the truth is as he
states, expose in the process the mendacity of the Ibrox board.
After all, David Murray has stated clearly that Rangers are only
interested in signing the best players available and that no factor
other than skill will influence any such decision, but obviously Mr
Clements knows better.
Does the fact that Mr Clements revels himself to be a Doctor of
Medicine give his information an added weight and authority compared to
say the ''fat bloke down the pub?''
As the late James Sanderson once said to a caller to a radio phone-in,
''Don't flash your credentials at me.'' Mr Clements would do well to
bear this in mind.

It is encouraging that Jean Montgomerie has introduced a further
aspect to the devolution debate (April 6). Knowing a little of Montreal
one can only concur with the information offered that the Province of
Quebec has an uphill struggle to emulate the general feeling of
prosperity in the rest of Canada.
There is another little appreciated consideration in an analysis of
Canada and that is the ''divide'' between east and west. A business
visit to various provinces rapidly informs one that west of Ontario the
hubs of commerce lie in Alberta and British Columbia and that their
horizons are south into the USA and further west into the Pacific Rim.
The provincial arrangements of Canada prevent disintegration and
absorption into the USA while allowing individual provinces to set their
own economic direction.
In the Scottish debate, I have seen nowhere any real recognition of
what has taken place within Scotland either since the Act of Union, or
since the Industrial Revolution got a hold, say, since 1830.
The first phase from 1707 until 1830 saw the inspiration of Scottish
Enlightenment which had its greatest impact on Edinburgh, and a second
phase from 1830 until 1880 brought development to the western central
belt, Dundee, and Aberdeen.
One cause of this extraordinary development was the overall ''binding
effect'' of the Parliament being in London but which brought, by
paradox, freedom from each other within Scotland to pursue policies
deemed best for the specific region.
Further, the activity depended upon access to the wider world beyond
Britain, and interestingly each region selected a different part of the
world, and the eco-structure permitting this was bound up in the
totality of British foreign policy, influenced by Scots to no little
extent.
A third phase from the late nineteenth century until 1914 was embraced
by stagnation which continued until the middle of this century, relieved
by economic activity spurred by two world wars. Since then there has
been profound change, most of it for the good in so far as social
conditions are concerned, but has there been replacement and improved
economic activity, and if so where, and what next?
The point of this potted history is to show that the era of Scottish
economic power has been brief and transcendency even shorter. Let us not
look to the future from ill-informed knowledge of the past because
pursuit of a return to the ''good life'' from false premises will do
no-one any good.
Today the basic regions of Scotland -- Borders, Lothians, Strathclyde,
Grampian, Highland -- are different in character and even traditions and
aspirations. Each area cherishes its own existence and there can be few
who would have it otherwise, apart perhaps from some politicians,
including the more influential ones.
It is against those who would shape Scottish destiny that the people
must be on their guard. My address is Edinburgh but I was brought up in
Glasgow and have had connections with Lanarkshire all my life.
This does not indicate that I want a Scotland which is in control of
itself -- self-rule -- but which in effect is pulled along by the
desires of Strathclyde -- the voting pedagogue -- with the rest of us
being dragged behind in dismay.
This is the real issue which we, the people of Scotland, ought to be
insisting that our politicians address. Maybe the benefits of being
individual regions within the UK are no longer as great as they were
but, if this is the case, should we not properly consider the
attractions of the UK becoming a province within Europe, the 51st State
of the USA, a member of the ''Yen'' area?

After self-imposed exile in Italy, artist Stephen Campbell is back, in
celebratory mood, and helping Scotland's youth, as Clare Henry discovers
IN 1993 the famous Scottish painter, Steven Campbell, opted out and
took his family to Italy, threatening never to return. He was angry,
angry about the state of the nation, pessimistic about the future,
despairing of British society in general. Moreover, after a decade at
the top of the art-world tree as an international name, he still felt
isolated.
Now he's back and -- man of extremes -- has gone from isolation to
collaboration in a big way, embracing his local community with vim and
vigour, applying his energy to a vast range of projects and people --
huge landscape murals for Glasgow Airport, a portrait of film-maker Bill
Forsyth, an exhibition of 90 inter-related pictures, lectures in Glasgow
and Orkney, a jazz opera with Tommy Smith and Stuart Hepburn, a big
(permanent) picture for Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and more.
For Campbell has -- literally -- moved down from the mountain to live
right beside the village cross. ''This has been a lucky house for us.
Really lucky. We haven't done a thing to it since we moved in, so it's
rather like living in a B&amp;B -- no responsibilities for the decor or the
wallpaper!''
From this small but convivial Stirlingshire base, with his three kids
at the local school, he orchestrates his life on a celebratory note. It
still takes in trips to New York (in September he exhibited at the
prestigious Marborough Gallery) and Dublin (for his 42nd birthday in
March), but also allows time for family, friends, fishing, and evenings
teaching teenagers in a local hall.
I visited one of his self-initiated night classes. ''There may be
urban deprivation but there's rural deprivation too. These kids have
nothing to do, nowhere to go. They just hang around the streets. I want
to change that.''
It was a far cry from the Campbell I knew in New York in the early
1980s -- or indeed the Campbell of pre-Italy. The village hall was in
darkness apart from a sea of candles stuck to rough pieces of card
scrawled with words such as love, peace, brother, sister, friendship,
poetry, silence. A group of teenagers perched on chairs. Campbell sat on
the floor, talking passionately about St Francis and Fra Angelico while
Gregorian chants played in the background.
He was accompanied by Father Declan, a Franciscan friar. ''I adore St
Francis. His chapel is near Lucca where we stay in Italy. His chapel is
so beautiful, so moving.''
How did he get hold of a friar?
''I looked in the Yellow Pages, phoned them up and said I needed a
friar for next Wednesday. No problem. Who did I want? I said someone
young, tall, dark, and handsome.'' And he was. Good with the kids too,
though I think the Gregorian chants threw him at first.''
After the life of St Francis, we had music from four of the students
(''One was a real pain but we knocked him into shape'') followed by an
Indian carryout delivered all the way from Stirling. When the janitor
came to close up, the kids had to be levered out of the door. Parallel
classes on film, writing, and poetry included contributions by Forsyth;
actor/script writer Stuart Hepburn; poet Edward Morgan; David Punter,
Professor of English at Stirling; and Elvis impersonator Jesse Garron.
''Everyone did it for free,'' recounts Campbell. It was art education
by the back door. If you care about the arts it's easy to make a small
commitment. But you should see my phone bill!''
Campbell's current project, painting a 30ftX8ft long mural for the
international hall of Glasgow Airport, is again celebratory. ''It's
called The Golden City and shows Glasgow in a vast, glorious, romantic
golden glow bordered by nature,'' he explains, gesticulating towards two
immense panels propped against the wall of a chilly Perthshire mill, the
size of an aircraft hanger and scattered with boats, machinery, lathes,
and industrial-type clutter.
I first saw the 14 sketches for it on his dining-room table amid the
Christmas clutter; different sweeping compositions of a verdant panorama
starting with a wonderful waterfall crashing down rocks and through
woods before winding through pastureland to the city. The foreground
includes giant-size purple fritillaries, a deliberate reference to
Charles Rennie Mackintosh's famous flowers.
Driving to and fro from this new studio I began to see things through
Campbell's eyes. The Carse of Stirling provides splendid vistas;
villages laid out at your feet in rich, fertile, open countryside amid
the Fintry Hills. Campbell's vision for the airport mural is inspired by
the view as you approach the city from the north. Cupped by dark woods,
ploughed fields and flowers, it will feature birds, leaping salmon, wild
animals, and butterflies; an idealised and idyllic Glasgow, but one
bound to please travellers.
''I've got to get the balance between nature and the city; the Dear
Green Place idea. It's tempting to add something dramatic, but it would
be the wrong thing to do for the location. It's not the place to be dark
and moody. No way! I want people to be uplifted; invigorated. I love
Glasgow,'' avers Campbell.
Campbell is a man of intensity. He loves his wife of 20 years with a
passion, he adores his three children -- and his close friend and
fishing companion Bill Forsyth whose unusual portrait he has just
completed as a commission from the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.
''They said they wanted a Campbell, not just a straight portrait, so
I've tried to do that, and also show the many facets of Bill's
personality. He's a very complex person, a dark mysterious creature. I
put Bill between town and country, by a great sweep of a motorway
flyover. He often uses the Kingston Bridge at night in his films. His
long arm echoes its shape and also protects his kids. It's curious and
odd.''
There are in fact four different images of Forsyth in the picture; one
held by himself, others by his two children. Campbell also includes
himself as a shadowy figure, the artist reaching round a tree with his
brush to put the finishing touch.
Forsyth approves of the portrait. ''Steven didn't consult me, but then
he's known me for years. Artists are kidding themselves if they think
they can mine someone's soul in three or four sittings. The portrait is
entirely his version of me and obviously I can't take an objective view,
but there are some things there I recognise in myself, some of the
tensions and dynamics. I like his composition; the notion of including
several faces. It's more honest to acknowledge that you're not going to
find a person in one go. Sure, we've had a lot of fun over the years --
the truth of that is there on the canvas.''
The Campbell/Forsyth portrait goes on show next week at Edinburgh's
Portrait Gallery where it will be displayed together with other Campbell
oils and several stills from Being Human, Forsyth's last film.
James Holloway, curator at the Portrait Gallery, is keen to up the
gallery's profile in contemporary art and to extend the audience. The
director, Duncan Thomson, anxious to get away from the dusty dead,
historical image, introduced the commissioning of recent portraits about
10 years ago and is building up a fine collection of famous living
Scots.
Says Holloway: ''We have been adventurous in our commissioning, from
footballers like Danny McGrain to musicians such as Sir Alex Gibson and
Peter Maxwell Davis -- plus Mick McGahey, Molly Hunter, R D Laing,
Michael Clark, even politicians such as Jo Grimmond painted in a fairly
controversial style. The Forsyth is a welcome addition. We are thrilled
with Steven's interpretation.''
Campbell is currently in post-Leverhume euphoria, having just received
a grant to go back to Italy to paint. But this time the trip is a mere
three-month affair, for there is much to do on the Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall picture which will have a musical theme (one of a quartet by
Howson, Currie, and Wiszniewski) while his latest idea, Three Ways to
Die, a contemporary opera (production design by Campbell, story by
Hepburn of Taggart fame, music by saxophonist Tommy Smith, and directed
by Stuart Laing of the Citizens' Theatre) is scheduled for next Mayfest.
It recounts an event of random violence in three acts, where the killer,
confessor, and witness all tell their side of the story, ending with a
final convulsive struggle ''which leads to the death of the witness --
or not'' explains Campbell mysteriously.
Now in his forties, Campbell is well aware of the need to be strong,
of the irony of life which can kill indiscriminately, of the unfairness
of it all. His last lecture, Three Ways to Murder an Artist, dwelt on
the ironic deaths of heroes Warhol, Giacometti, and Egon Schiele.
Death with an ironic twist has always fascinated Campbell. ''Life and
death, that's all there is. But you have to do your best, aim high, but
see yourself as a piece of rubbish. What the hell!''
As Forsyth says: ''It's good to see Steve committed to Scotland and
even better to see him looking the world in the eye.''

IN the article, Hunt for the Bruce -- South of the Border (April 14),
Raymond Duncan claims difficulty in finding a suitable actor to portray
the role of Robert the Bruce in this ''historical epic''.
The search has moved to England. Might I suggest that the search
crosses the Channel? The services of Gerard Depardieu or Christopher
Lambert, two world class stars, either one, or any other French actor
with good credentials, would be a more apt choice.
Their sex appeal would ensure the film reached a wider market.

STRANGE to feel nostalgia for the things you used to hate. Like where
have all the bank managers gone? The grey-haired ones who used to write
you letters and say like sad uncles that they were disappointed in you
and would you come and see them please? They had proper offices instead
of partitions, with doors that shut softly behind you. Bank managers
made arrangements with you, they had surnames like Forsyth and
Cunningham, they wore tieclips and they shook their heads wearily with a
little smile (sometimes) and called you Miss.
I miss them. I don't mind not being called Ms any more. Come back, Mr
Straight. Nobody's disappointed in my overdraft any more, and I feel
hurt. Even the insolvent have feelings, you know. Instead there is
Raymond. If Mr Straight was a Dickensian finger-wag, Raymond is a Kafka
clerk. I have never seen him, we only talk on the phone. In the last 12
months I have spoken to a Paul, a Steven, and a Desmond, but never seen
their faces. It's like Blind Date, except that the nerds all want to say
no.
I ask Raymond if he is my new bank manager. He laughs nervously and
says inexplicably that he would not tempt the fates by saying that he
was any such thing. I ask him if he has a surname. No, he says, and I
wonder if I am really awake. No, he continues, explaining that he is a
Retail Credit Sanctioner who may feel obliged to report me to a Credit
Reference Agency. What's that, I say. He clears his throat, he's happy
now, he has learnt this one: CNN Systems, Infolink, Wescot Limited.
When I ask him pathetically, hopefully, who then is my bank manager,
he says that they don't as such exist any more.
I feel bereft. I know my capacity for yearning is rococo, that I cried
at 15 when I was chucked by somebody I never fancied, that I remember
the day and hour when I found out that Ian McKellen was gay. But this is
surreal.
I suggest we meet. He wants to know why I should want to come and see
him. He sounds suspicious of my motives. I wonder if he will ask a
female teller to be present at our meeting in case he should be unduly
compromised, like a handsome gynaecologist. A vision of Cilla Black in a
nurse's uniform rises horribly before me. He tries once more to fob me
off. If I would simply fill in the Confidential Personal Budget Form . .
. And for once in my life I do not beg. I tell him I will repay my #100
overdraft before he takes me to court, then I will Go Elsewhere.
He does not sound disappointed.
And then there's Edward Heath, that amiable liberal, that civilised
man against the xenophobes. Did I in the seventies really demonstrate
against this friendly little musical boat bobbing towards Europe? I
remember shouting ''Heath Out! Heath Out!'' nearly a quarter of a
century ago on University Avenue and it seems so bizarre. Like calling
the Church of England the opium of the people.
One night recently I was watching Andrew Neil in braces in Brussels on
the little television at the end of my bed. He was interviewing the
Dutch Foreign Minister who has called John Major the Mr Bean of European
politics. Then some non-foreign Conservative MPs from our own Government
called the Dutchman a socialist, insisting that they themselves were not
anti-Europe but merely the dissenting proud and independent voice of a
free people. (I thought I'd heard ''three people'' before I realised it
was just the accent.)
Andrew didn't touch the obviously Belgian lager in front of him and
pretended to be as critical of the Eurosceptics as he was of the Dutch
Foreign Minister. I suddenly understood about the braces. Robin Day had
a bow tie, Andrew was going for braces, and then, God help me, I even
missed Robin Day.
(I fell asleep and dreamt that the Prime Minister, Rowan Atkinson, had
been snatched from death's clutches, with a Scotch egg in his mouth, a
plastic bag from a French branch of Marks and Spencers over his head,
and a pair of Armani knickers over his trousers. But the Government had
rallied.)
But more than anything I am nostalgic about my old portable
typewriter, my Olivetti 32.
I want once more to dirty my fingers with typewriter ribbon. I yearn
to sniff Tippex. I want my hands to be soiled with plain down-to-earth
carbon paper like any ordinary word labourer.
My Amstrad know this, sneers, and plays up. Warning messages appear in
the middle of the night. Continue at your peril. Sometimes when I sit
down to control it I have this flashback of being placed on a horse at
nine years old. A huge neck daisy-wheels round and a bulging eye surveys
me, utterly tuned into my fear. The look says, you can't kid me, kiddo,
you are not part of this pony club and there's an hour of trekking in
strange parts ahead of you. Shall we Start the Day?
This word processor is Anton Mosimann and it's frustrated. It can cut
and pastry, it can spelling-check and troubleshoot and all I can do is
ask it for a fried-egg roll and it is not pleased. Letting me get smug
once I typed for ages without glancing at the screen, then looking up,
where once there had been dialogue was Cyrillic. I had either just
written a Greek radio play or I'd ordered dolmades.
I believe this is a computer virus and Michael Portillo is the
instigator.
Or maybe I am paranoid and it is simply a sign of the 20-pence Times?

IF you wanted to do a parody of Sam Shepard, Simpatico would bring you
pretty near. Shepard's first play in a decade turns out to be a bit of a
disappointment, recycling old themes but without some of his original
fire. Take its central device: two friends joined by some shady deal way
back, one living the life of Reilly, the other a two-bit,
down-on-his-luck private detective living in some flea-pit of a room in
the belly of Nowheresville, California.
Like True West, however (recently electrifyingly revived at the Donmar
by Matthew Warchus), come the denouement the tables are turned. Carter,
the man who had it all, sits a broken, dying spirit. Ciaran Hinds's
laconic Vinnie walks away: ''I am myself again.''
The shadow of David Mamet hovers, with gambling (in this case horses)
seen as a metaphor for, and way of, American life. But establishing
exactly who wins and who loses is the rub. What goes around comes
around. Tony Haygarth's vaguely sinister but beaming horse breeder,
Simms -- once destroyed by Vinnie and Carter -- reasserts the quiet
victory of putting the past behind you.
A play of paradoxes and self-conscious loose-ends, illuminated by
Shepard's distinctively pugilistic and ironic dialogue, the production
is not helped by James Macdonald's meandering, over-studied direction.
Yet the play also has a curious, elegiac beauty to it -- marked by an
intense personal sorrow in which redemption and forgiveness are its
barely signalled but unmistakable subtexts. As a dumb innocent who gets
pulled in by concern and temptation (attending the Kentucky Derby),
Janet McTeer is both affecting and revelatory.

AS a former prisoner of war on the River Kwai, I read with interest
George Hume's account of the torture and suffering, past and present,
endured by a former Signals officer, Mr Eric Lomax, following his
experiences on the infamous Burma railway at the hands of his Japanese
captors (Weekender, April 8).
I cannot regard the behaviour of the Japanese towards people made
subservient or captive as one whit more heinous than that of the
Germans.
Japanese indifference towards the suffering of those fallen into their
power, and even the deliberate infliction of suffering and pain that is
in the oriental ethos in general, has been used as part of a strategic
plan of conquest, aggrandisement for material wealth's sake not
unfamiliar to those who carved out the British Empire.
What most of us regard as barbarous behaviour has been used down the
ages for the oldest purpose of all -- ''pour encourager les autres''.
The barbarism of the Japanese incidental to the strategic plan in hand
is not to be compared with the cold-blooded savagery of the Third Reich
that sought to exterminate as a matter of deliberate policy on the
pretext of ''cleansing the Augean Stables'' a whole culture and ethos --
that of the Jews and misfits of Third Reich ideology.
I neither condone nor condemn the imperial past of our immediate
forefathers that came to us as much by fire and the sword as it did by
trade. On balance, the benefits brought to peoples made subject to the
Crown -- law, order, trade, and usually peace -- far outweighed the
disadvantages of subservience, and the legacy of Empire left is
something we can mostly be proud of as we sink into obscurity within the
confines of the European Union.
Remembering the history of our Imperial past perhaps we should examine
our consciences before reproving others for their behaviour towards
those of us made captive -- ask the Australian aborigine, ask the Maori
and others we have marginalised in their own homeland.
I cast no aspersions where none belongs, but that out of evil can come
good is proven by the reconciliation of Eric Lomax and his tormentor by
the banks of the River Kwai.

PHILIP OSMENT is a wizard with the small insignificances of life. Like
Ayckbourn, he takes a rueful attitude towards the family and, like a
latter-day Chekov, has a way of transforming the mundanities of family
life into something at once tragic and comic.
Fascinating then to compare his latest, What I Did in The Holidays for
Cambridge Theatre Company (set in 1963), with Field Day's new production
of Uncle Vanya in a new translation by Frank McGuinness.
Both have their fair share of characters in moments of emotional
absurdity. Osment's Stella Gibbonish family are never more ridiculous
than when fighting for territorial advantage, be it over affections, the
last dash of diesel to keep the pump working (there's no permanent
electricity or running water) or the few scraps of money (Osment's
father is the meanest of skinflints).
Osment's absentee Mum too, like some of Chekov's vainglorious women,
is a bit of a bolter and dangerously inconsistent. All of which makes
for a hysterical yet poignantly comic account of growing up in darkest
Devon, where Osment's schoolboy, Morley, with his burgeoning gay
feelings, is frequently caught between a rock and a hard place.
Vanya, too, is agony seen through a farcical warp. How else to
describe Vanya and the doctor's outbursts of inappropriate love for the
beautiful Elena which both know to be utterly pointless.
The self-awareness of Chekov's characters is what makes them so
special and so appealing. Peter Gill's stylish if underwrought
production throws away much of Chekov's deeper, philosophical notes but
nicely captures, in Stephen Rea's frenetic Vanya, some of its emotional
madness. Zara Turner's bright-eyed Sonya, with her rhapsodic belief in a
better after-life, wrings the withers.
Holidays runs to May 13, Vanya to April 29.

ONE of Glasgow's favourite holiday weekend pastimes is a visit to the
local museums and art galleries. A whiff of popular family enjoyment is
never out of place in these palaces of culture and high art, and it is
particularly noticeable at such times as Easter Monday. No doubt the
Burrell Gallery, for example, will be thronged today with visitors
admiring the rich variety of treasures amassed by Sir William Burrell
and gifted by him many years ago for our continuing pleasure. Probably
few visitors will pause to reflect on the latest controversy swirling
round the interpretation of Sir William's intentions.
In one sense there is no room for dispute. In Burrell's bequest of 50
years ago, later reinforced, it was clearly spelt out that none of the
items must leave Britain. The danger of damage in transit was considered
too great. But it can be argued that air transport has transformed the
situation, making the transit of art works much swifter and safer. With
this in mind the city of Glasgow and its director of galleries Julian
Spalding now seek to have Burrell's strict injunction set aside. Later
this year Parliament will be asked to give permission to change the
terms so that items may be lent for exhibition abroad.
The argument is simple. The Burrell has a worldwide fame and there are
occasions when the temporary display of selected works would enhance the
value of an exhibition abroad. In return this would benefit the good
name of Glasgow, and it would also have the practical advantage of
encouraging foreign galleries to respond in kind by giving Glasgow
important temporary loans. On the face of it, this is a reasonable point
of view. Burrell's expressed wish has been overridden before. Without a
major relaxation of the terms of his bequest it is probable that the
collection would still be salted away in store, and certain that it
could never be seen as a whole in Pollok or anywhere in the city. The
trustees who are responsible for ensuring that Burrell's wishes are
respected have already accepted that his words are not written in stone
and can be altered if need be. Yet in this case they are bitterly
opposed to any change.
It is sad that relations between the city and the trustees should have
deteriorated to such an extent that one side is seeking to have its will
imposed by parliamentary authority. Mr Spalding says that the traffic
has all been one-way, but so far it is not clear precisely what benefits
Glasgow has lost by not making Burrell items more widely available.
Perhaps, too, a softer approach might have worked better. Was it such a
good idea, for example, to lend Burrell textiles, glass, and ceramics to
Habitat, to be displayed in the cafe of its new London store in
Tottenham Court Road? You might argue that this unorthodox, even bizarre
approach is in line with the Glasgow galleries' populist policy, an
admirably unstuffy move bringing art appreciation literally into the
market-place. On the other hand, it may well have raised suspicion among
the trustees about just where the Burrell treasures might be dispatched
next if the barriers came down.
But for today's happy holidaymakers wandering among the works of art
within the lawns and woods of Pollok Park, these matters may seem
remote. The Burrell belongs to Glasgow. Whether it should remain
sacrosanct, inviolate in its entirety, or whether occasional pieces
might be allowed to travel, is surely a matter for reasoned and open
discussion, not for hostile confrontation.

CONTRARY to Mr Moore's statement (April 11), Beira did have an airport
capable of handling a wide variety of aircraft including large military
transports. In addition, the local subsidiary of the Portuguese National
Airline, TAP, ran a very good twice-daily service from Lourenco Marques
to Beira using Boeing 737s.
During 1969 and 1970 I was involved in geophysical and geological
exploration in the delta of the Zambezi. The exploration party was
entirely dependent on Beira airport for all supplies, including aviation
fuel for light aircraft and helicopters. I might add, the service we
received was excellent.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a very large Portuguese military
force was deployed in northern Mozambique; one of its most important
objectives was to secure the integrity of the Cabora Bassa Dam, then
under construction on the Upper Zambezi.
These operations, military and civil, were supported by the Beira
terminal and, considering the scale of both, the 30,000 tons of fuel to
which Mr Moore refers would not appear excessive.
There was, of course a railway line between Beira and Salisbury;
perhaps more important, the Beira terminal was linked to Rhodesia by
pipeline. Considering the Portuguese and Rhodesians shared a common
enemy as well as a common frontier, it would have been surprising if the
Rhodesian forces had not been provided with much-needed fuel from Beira.
Mr Moore does not reveal who chartered his tanker; if it was not Mr
Smith's regime then there was very little, if anything, the British Navy
could do about it.
There seems to be an implication in Mr Moore's letter that the British
connived at ''busting'' their own sanctions; neither he, nor anyone
else, has produced tangible evidence to support such a view.

So Glasgow Museums joins the long list of European and transatlantic
cultural institutions in the greedy acquisition of other people's
property, with its retention, for the time being at any rate, of the
Sioux Ghost Shirt against the express wishes of the Indians concerned.
Reluctant to hand back the sacred vestment, Mark O'Neill, senior
museum curator, says: ''It might open the floodgates.''
What a pity it doesn't. The richest nations of the West have been
indefatigable appropriators of the most prized religious art treasures
of poorer countries for centuries and this country has been the most
hypocritical of all in its desperation to obtain some sort of reflected
glory from its predations -- almost as if the art objects concerned had
been created here.
Thus we have the Elgin Marbles, the Portland Vase, the Wilton Diptych,
not to mention such other national treasures as the Lord Amherst
(Stradivarius) Violin, the Rokeby Venus, etc.
Such bogus nomenclature is really quite sickening.Perhaps in due
course Mr O'Neill and his colleagues will be referring to the
Kelvingrove Simmit in their cataloguing.
The time is now overdue for the exercise of some genuine morality in
this department of international affairs. The problem threatens to
become worse with China presently being sacked of many more of its
antique objets d'art and the pillaging of ancient sites from Egypt to
Mexico continuing.
Greece is still pressing for the return of the Venus di Milo from
France and the Elgin Marbles from this country.

NO doubt many of my fellow Scots share in the shame of Glasgow
Museums' stance towards the Lakota people's claim for the rightful
return of their Ghost Shirt (April 11).
How can a Scottish museum legitimately claim ownership of a sacred
garment looted from the victim of an atrocious act of barbarism? The
relevance of the Ghost Shirt to the populace of Scotland is negligible
and to the Lakota it is obviously an item of tremendous importance.
How can anyone argue against the only fair solution -- the return of
the Ghost Shirt to the Lakota nation?
The museum apparently fears the precedent this may set for the return
of much of its ill-got booty to its rightful owners and prefers to
rejoice in the riches it has inherited from the spoils of the British
Empire.
Perhaps some day after the Elgin Marbles are returned, Scotland will
retrieve a reset chunk of sandstone currently residing under an English
throne.

IN your report of the sacred Ghost Shirt (on display in Kelvingrove
Museum in Glasgow) you use the current politically correct term Native
Americans for people described by schoolboys as Red Indians and by
anthropologists as Amer-Indians.
But I know people with skins and hair of a variety of colours and with
such names as Bernstein, Bergman, Schwartz, Smith, Singh, Tanimoto, and
MacSporran, all born and bred in the United States. Are they not Native
Americans too?
A more descriptively correct name for any early inhabitants is, of
course, Aborigines, but this, too, is unacceptable for the common herd
thinks only of Australian Aborigines wielding boomerangs and making
weird music.
The invention or use of a half-baked new term to make a political
point by some vociferous pressure group leads to as many ridiculous
anomalies as did the old words.
It is no longer any more permissible to describe anyone or anything as
black than it was in Victorian times to admit that grand pianos had legs
for fear they might give rise to lecherous thoughts.
The rule is, when something gets controversial, to change its name and
when people get uncomfortable with the new name to change it again.

I APPRECIATED much of what Ron Ferguson said in his essay, A better
song for Nineties (March 25). It's just a pity that he seems to have
been infected with the very cynicism that be bemoans.
There are indeed better songs to sing than this -- and many people are
singing them, with Christian Aid, and for the homeless, in their
personal lives and in the community.
Certainly the spiritual crisis takes precedence over any so-called
constitutional crisis. As Ron Ferguson himself admits, ''Some (of the
better songs) are there already.''
Thanks be to God.

IN his soul-searching essay on spiritual crisis (March 25, which I
have read on return from holiday), the Rev Ron Ferguson says ''We need a
new spirituality,'' spelling out clearly some of the awful weaknesses of
present society.
However, his invitation to us to join his pilgrimage prompted my
memory, perhaps quite unfairly, of reading about the preachers in C G
Jung's family, his father and eight uncles, whom the teenage Jung often
heard in theological discussions, religious conversation, and sermons.
In particular, Jung's father's preaching on grace ''sounded (to the
son) like a tale told by someone who knows it only by hearsay''.
Jung by this time believed that he had experienced the grace of God in
such a way as to induce in him ''an almost unendurable loneliness''. It
also formed the foundation of his whole uniquely fertile life, one of
the most beneficial ever for humanity.
Later, when Jung was 18, he hoped to let his father know of the
''miracle of grace, and thereby help to mitigate his pangs of
conscience,'' but their discussions invariably came to an unsatisfactory
end.
The father dismissed the son's thinking, saying, ''You always want to
think. One ought not to think, but believe.'' The son then would think,
''No, one must experience and know''.
Jung listened to the theologians and he ''devoured whatever books he
could find on God, the Trinity, spirit, and counsciousness'' from his
father's library; but, he wrote, ''I always found myself thinking --
they do not know either''.
Jung was a boy when he experienced the Holy Spirit. He did not seek
it, but with respect to Mr Ferguson's abilities as writer and preacher,
to his Christian commitment, and obvious longing for ''a new
spirituality'', I take issue with his dismissal of individuals who make
their own personal efforts to seek the Holy Spirit.
If he has not followed such a path, how does he know that ''it cannot
bear the weight'' as he claims?

THE views of Mr R Walters on the question of limited companies and his
condemnation of Mr G McKinstry, the solicitor acting on behalf of Mr
Ferguson who has lost #66,000 through non-payment, cannot be permitted
to pass without comment.
Apart from the argument on the merits or otherwise of the status of a
limited company surely Mr Walters, a company managing director, accepts
that it is simply immoral not to pay an account when a service has been
sought and given.
Whether the sum is #66,000 or #66, I am assuming he recognises and
accepts that the debt has to be met.
Using the status of a limited company not to honour debts simply by
winding up the company passes this debt on to other companies in the
procurement chain to their serious financial damage and resultant loss
of employment opportunities.
During this protracted recession I wonder how many suppliers of
materials have been seriously damaged by the failure of companies, be
they limited or not.
I for one would be prepared to swap a major win on the National
Lottery for the total sum written off in this manner by these material
suppliers.

GUATEMALA in Central America is not exactly a name on many British
lips. Indeed it might easily fit Neville Chamberlain's notorious
description of Czechoslovakia -- ''a far-off place of which we know
little''. It does, occasionally, make a greater impact on the popular
mind. Twice in the past century there were important disagreements
between the Guatemalan government and our own over the boundaries of
what was then called British Honduras and is now Belize. And once in
this century there has been a dispute over Guatemala's claim to the
sovereignty of Belize itself, a claim the British Government wisely, and
successfully, resisted. Conditions in independent Belize, especially
those involving human rights, are vastly superior to those obtaining in
Guatemala where rule by terror is intermittent, with the Army being the
main promoter of violence, although a substantial guerrilla movement, if
no longer as powerful as it was in the 1980s, still contributes to the
same end.
Things seemed to be improving two years ago after attempts to
establish a dictatorship (by President Elias) were thwarted by a
combination of local liberal forces and pressure from the newly elected
Clinton administration. The threat of an elective dictatorship looms
again, however, in the shape of the candidacy of hard-line Army General
Rios Montt, who has been a dictator before. It was the general who was
mainly responsible for savage suppression of the peasant guerrillas just
over a decade ago. He embodies the Army's ruthless response to
dissidence, especially that of the Mayan Indians, though many (even many
of the Army's victims) tend to see him as imposer of law and order.
Like many other Central American countries, Guatemala suffers from
acute land hunger among its poor. The employed sector of the economy is
modest and agriculture provides a quarter of the GNP. Ownership,
especially of the best land, is heavily concentrated, and still in the
hands of the Spanish descended elite. As across the border in Southern
Mexico this distribution evokes considerable and persistent resentment
leading to armed revolt. This has been suppressed but never completely
eliminated. The Mexican government has responded to its peasant
challengers by trying negotiation.
A President Montt would, on past form, step up Guatemalan efforts to
eliminate them. It is not a happy prospect but one which will not change
without a peaceful state-promoted (and financed) land redistribution.
That hardly seems likely without the fear of bloody revolution forcing
the country's rich and powerful to make concessions to avert the threat
of worse. Unfortunately even well-intentioned military men are seldom
the best equipped to sponsor such a change. General Montt is far more
likely to make things worse.

IT is not difficult to work out why Gavin Bryars chose to rework his
1972 The Sinking of the Titanic as the follow-up to the huge commercial
success of Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet. Like that second take at an
earlier piece, it worries at a simple tune in a way that bypasses the
complexities of appreciation of ''serious'' music and heads straight for
the route that makes popular music, well, popular.
He can hardly be blamed for aiming for another money-maker, but the
eccentricity of the philosophical basis for The Sinking of the Titanic,
the notion that the hymn tune being played by the band as the vessel
went down can still be heard, is no match for the eccentricity of the
vocal contribution to Jesus Blood. The addition to Titanic of the voices
from interviews with the survivors -- mixed well down on Saturday night
-- suggests that Bryars is only too conscious of this.
A couple of volumes on from his back pages and Bryars's work is
sounding very interesting indeed. His Wonderlawn suite, which closed the
first half, is a reworking of last year's collaboration with
choreographer Laurie Booth. Written for a string quartet of his own
devising (bass, cello, viola, and electric guitar), it uses that palette
to full effect, from arpeggiating cello, through plucked bass and
sustained (Fender) guitar, to picked (Gibson) semi-acoustic.
That piece, and the multi-tracked clarinet showcase for Roger Heaton
which preceded it, engaged the attention in a way that all the gimmickry
of The Sinking of the Titanic didn't. One elevating neon tube does not a
multi-media experience make. Or was that publicity line a little joke?

Memory - May 9th, 1945, a festival of theatre commemorating the defeat
of fascism in Europe, sounds an alarm at events in the Balkans, writes
CAROLE WODDIS
MEMORY, according to Corin and Vanessa Redgrave, is our most
specifically human faculty. ''It is the most important component of our
ability to learn, to progress, to correct our mistakes, and to avoid
repeating those mistakes in the future.''
While the 50th anniversary caravanserai moves inexorably on, an
extraordinary act of faith is under way at Hammersmith's Riverside
Studios, itself still under something of a financial siege. For almost
two months a gigantic cultural cross-over is in motion in which artists
from Los Angeles to Moscow, Sarajevo to Jerusalem will be taking part in
what amounts to a veritable World Festival of Theatre.
The season, the brainchild of the Redgraves, those irrepressible
cultural warriors, on one level it commemorates the defeat of fascism in
Europe; on another sounds an alarm to what is happening again.
Under the umbrella title of Memory - May 9th, 1945, at its heart --
among the 14 different companies, plays by Shakespeare, Max Frisch,
Ionesco, Sophocles, George Bernard Shaw, new plays about Roger Casement
and the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, artists such as Frances de la Tour,
Edward (Lou Grant) Asner, the Berliner Ensemble's Ekkehard Schall and
the great and now exiled Yugoslav actor Rade Serbedzija (whose Oscar
nominated film, Before the Rain will also be seen during the festival),
Jewish and Arab actors from Haifa, the Amici dance group (in a stunning
integrated dance piece based on the work of German socialist painter
Kathe Kollwitz), various recitals, a photographic exhibition and
play-readings -- are visits from companies from the former Yugoslavia in
plays about resistance to fascism in the 40s and about the situation
now.
Refusing the heroic mould, The Liberation of Skopje, a post-war epic,
is about the anguish and humiliation of people living under foreign
occupation, while Vidosav Stevanovic's Waterfall sets the present-day
tragedy of racial nationalism in surreal, traumatic terms.
Yet, even as the season was getting under way last week, history was
decreeing otherwise. The Sarajevo Festival Ensemble, brought over thanks
to, and under the auspices of, Unesco, were scheduled to perform Silk
Drums, a production conceived and created in 1993 in the midst of the
city's 1000-day siege.
Already presented to great acclaim at Peter Brook's theatre in Paris,
in the event, as they arrived, their city again came under shelling. Too
distressed, and uncertain even of when they will be allowed home, the
ensemble's performances were cancelled, the company choosing instead to
hold debates with their audience, though even that took on a somewhat
impromptu feel. Lacking a ready translator, by the third evening we few
well-meaning but non Serbo-Croat-speaking members were reduced to
linguistic impotence -- smiling across the way from each other but
largely unable to communicate -- somehow a peculiarly apt metaphor for
the West's general response to their crisis.
In a festival of this kind no doubt there will be other such
administrative hiccups to overcome. Still, in these days of rampant
materialism the enterprise as a whole remains a stunning act of
solidarity -- not just by the Redgraves, who have pulled the festival
together, but by all the other actors and technicians who are
subsidising it, according to Corin Redgrave, largely through their own
pockets.
Some of the highlights are likely to include Vanessa Redgrave
repeating her role as ''the serpent of old Nile'', Frances de la Tour in
Max Frisch's The Fire Raisers, Corin as Roger Casement, Ed Asner in
Shaw's Don Juan Hell, Kika Markham as Anna Akhmatova in Maureen
Lawrence's Real Writing, Ekkehard Schall as King Kreon in Antigone, and
a musical tour with Jewish cantor Ron Graner, delightfully entitled From
Genesis to Gershwin.
But it is also likely to be as important for what one doesn't know and
can't anticipate. For as Corin Redgrave puts it, ''Theatre doesn't
change people by direct appeal but by showing people things in lights
other than perhaps they saw them in the past or other than as they're
frequently presented. And by showing the richness and diversity of what
is possible even in circumstances such as the Sarajevans find
themselves, I think people will take away something very important.''

Close encounters: a visitor to the 2010 exhibition at Edinburgh's
Fruit Market views a work by Latvian artist Peteris Sidars, composed of
fibre optics.
Spending on opulent art gallery buildings far exceeds the budget for
the exhibitions they contain, laments Clare Henry
THE message sent out by more and more big art galleries today is:
''Damn the artists. Bricks and mortar; glass and concrete palaces,
that's what we want. Big spenders -- sure -- but not on art.
Revamping Edinburgh's Fruit Market Gallery has cost around #500,000,
with #75,000 for a new heating system. Currently it's showing giant
Brillo pads; ugly, re-cycled, sticky plastic toy chairs, and purple wool
covered with burnt-brown rayon, tossed in a tumble drier to fray the
edges. Try explaining that to your auntie!
Last October, a freak fire was yet another catastrophe in a chapter of
accidents which, over the past five years, has included complete closure
due to financial failure. Currently the staff of 10 administer a revenue
grant of #311,000 annually (#307,000 from the Scottish Arts Council) to
provide a mere eight exhibitions a year; many, like the current
extravaganza, put together by other organisations.
Even the Festival Show is work by the deeply foreign Marina Abramovic,
coming second-hand from Oxford's Museum of Modern Art, where it is now.
When the Fruit Market does curate its own shows, far and foreign seems
the rule, with Japanese photography last May (in fairness very good it
was too), Korea in the autumn, with China (involving a #20,000 SAC
research grant) for 1996. Scottish Art appears but rarely. Four of the
last seven shows came already sponsored -- or perhaps the bill would be
greater.
Does it have to cost us that much to give foreign art a good display?
And is that what publicly funded Scottish galleries should be doing? In
this desperately severe recession, should any cash at all outside
lottery money be spent on housing the arts? Shouldn't it be spent on
people, not heating?
If anyone needs heat it's the artists working in freezing studios and
workshops all over Scotland to produce art which may end up -- well,
certainly not in the Fruit Market, that's for sure.
The current show: 2010: Textiles &amp; New Technology, focuses on aspects
of fabric design and its use in architecture and fashion. Could this
have anything to do with Edinburgh's assumption that it would win UK
City of Architecture and Design 1999?
However, now the West has scooped the title, Glasgow is all set for a
major Festival of Design in 1996 -- which was part of the winning 1999
bid. A director will be appointed shortly.
Meantime, Frank Binnie, chief executive of Scottish design (the
organisation which replaced Design Council Scotland last May, with half
the cash and a quarter of the staff) explains that it has three strands:
industry, education and a blockbuster exhibition which brings the
world's top ten international designers to Glagow. ''1999 presents so
many possibilities, from a cyber space cafe to school packs on Glasgow
Transport design through the ages'' he says.
Binnie (who is visiting professor in engineering design at Strathclyde
University) has a background in textiles, so 2010 is just the thing for
an expert like him.
However, for the public, 2010 is not all it's cracked up to be,
especially after the lead up PR hype using stunning images by Maria
Blaisse. This is merely a ruse.
And however important some of these experimental fabrics may be with
their knitted plastic and metal, heat embossed polyurethene and computer
aided design, they don't actually look very interesting. Lengths of
fabric suspended from the ceiling are hardly what you expect here.
Mandors and Fab Fabrics, yes. Scottish design, yes. The Fruit Market,
no.
The show is put together by London's Craft Council -- a quango so
determined to avoid the homespun, handmade arty-crafty image -- that it
sometimes swings too far the other way.
And as to all these fabrics with ''a memory'', so that they keep their
shape, what about that tweed jacket or old cardigan that you like purely
because its moulded to your shape?
Conversely, not all the world likes lycra, with its second-skin
hugging qualities. Okay if you're 19 and perfectly formed; not so hot if
you're fat and 40. The new man-made fabrics-with-a-perm may be an
improvement on early synthetics: rayon curtains, nylon shirts and
crimplene dresses, but it's some consolation that good old cotton, wool,
linen and silk still play their part.
Paradoxically, some computer designs here are hand printed (like
Vibeke Riisberg's op-art designs on cotton satin) or hand made, as in
Harold Cohen's monotonous cream and beige, computer drawn, angular peg
people, woven by Edinburgh's Dovecot in wool. The trouble with combining
warp and weft and computer drawing is that neither can cope with curved
lines, so there are lots of hard, zigzag edges.
Strangely, the actual styles hark back: to 1940s Hepworth stretched
string, or 1960s Vasarelli and Bridgitte Riley vibrating op art. The
wheel shaped fibre optics piece, by Peteris Sidars, is banal, even
simplistic, and how hateful to see wobbly wool stitching ruin Frenchman
Pat Hugues' sheer chiffon, and bad bike spokes on Warren Seelig's Oval
artwork.
The one revolutionary creator is Blaisse, who uses foam, latex and
injection-moulded rubber to create stunning sculptural forms, which led
to designing for dance, theatre and opera, plus a hat collection for
Issey Miyake.
Among the Spanish, Dutch, American, Latvian, Italian, Swiss, Nigerian
and New Zealand designers, Japan comes out best, with Arai Sudo of the
Nuno Corporation way ahead, with weaves combining ancient Japanese
techniques with the latest technologies. With only two British
exhibitors out of 24, the UK doesn't shine, but at least one of the two,
Jonathan Fuller, graduated from Glasgow in 1992. And I do like the
triangular labels too.
* Clare Henry will be reviewing the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition
in next Monday's Herald Arts.

Music
THEY brought their patio furniture, they brought their kitchen chairs.
The good burgers of Eastwood -- or at least those who were prepared to
take a (well-rewarded) chance with the weather -- came ready to have a
good night out for the opening concert of the district's first arts
festival, Artsfeast. The SCO also arrived clearly prepared to enjoy
themselves, and conductor Christopher Bell was the ideal man for the
occasion, cheerleading from the off and introducing each number with a
user-friendly verbal programme note.
Not that there was anything intimidating about the programme: Bizet's
Carmen Overture, the Thunder and Lightning Polka, Nessun Dorma, and the
Peer Gynt Suite for starters. This was proms stuff in advance of the
proms. At the same time there was a nice nod towards VE Day with
Walton's Spitfire Prelude and Fugue, and the singers -- soprano Yvonne
Barclay and tenor Michael Preston-Roberts -- were given a chance to show
off shamelessly with selections from My Fair Lady. Throughout the
programme the band gave it laldy, which was what was required. The
ear-to-ear grin sported throughout by one of the cellists rather summed
it up.
The whole evening was capped with a performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812
Overture which was just as robust, but rendered almost inaudible by some
of the loudest fireworks this side of Krakatoa. Spectacular they
certainly were, however, despite working against the fact that it wasn't
quite dark. The council's deputy chief executive could be heard warning
Provost Leslie Rosin that there would be phonecalls in the morning. Only
from sad people, we say.

DESPITE the many invitations to sample the wicked delights of its Cafe
Lucia -- oh those well-stacked baguettes and truly succulent tarts --
the Edinburgh Festival Theatre is still a snort and a toot from being
some low'n'smoky speakeasy. For one thing, patrons have to puff their
ciggies on the pavement outside . . . But for one night, anyway, a touch
of the raunch and roll of the Jazz Age came inside, courtesy of the
Jiving Lindy Hoppers, Harry Strutter's Hot Rhythm Orchestra, and Miss
Karen Lopes.
A Night At The Cotton Club sets out to recreate something of the
intense energy, the reckless fun, and hot-footing rhythms of Harlem in
the 20s and 30s. At first I had real doubts that the team could do it.
Plonked down, as they were, in the middle of what the trombonist called
''the plinth'', the paying audience scarcely close enough to be
spattered by high-performance sweat -- wasn't it all going to be a bit
fossilised? Polite?
Midway through, and the doubts had been pushed to one side. Partly
because I was surrounded by folk having a whale of a time -- the
Festival Theatre does pull great audiences -- and partly because the
on-stage mob were giving the cotton-picking equivalent of laldy.
The Lindy Hoppers don't just jive. They charleston, they shimmy, they
cakewalk, and they tap. They dance with humour as well as technical
brilliance -- tap dances become a classy visual gag as they concertina
into a unison graded neatly by height, while the jive rejoices in having
the guys fly over the gals' shoulders like giant yo-yos. As for vocalist
Karen Lopes, she doesn't simply sing acceptable cover versions of
Ellington standards. She gets inside the songs, makes herself at home,
invites us to clap along or join in, takes time to share a joke or so
with the band.
She has a lovely, warm confidence about her that really helps to set
the tone of the evening -- though the orchestra, a glorious pack of very
able rogues, contribute their own particular gleeful mayhem to
proceedings.

Sparks flew at the arrival of women within Glasgow University. Now,
100 years on from the graduation of its first woman MA, Gilmorehill
plans to stand back and light the blue touch-paper, as MARY BRENNAN
reports
LIKE some huge, exotic mushroom, a great marquee is about to spring up
in the West Quad of Glasgow University. Come Saturday it will be
thrumming with all manner of activity -- various musicians will perform
among stalls displaying a host of different crafts, there will be plays
and debates, singing and drumming and even fireworks. Though those
sparks are scheduled to fly outside the tent . . .
This gleeful invasion of cloister and quad, in fact, commemorates
another event which at the time struck some as marvellous, others as
ludicrous, and a few as being the end of civilisation as they knew, and
loved, it. This was the arrival of women students within the university.
Now women were first allowed to enter Scottish universities in 1892.
But rather than tag along with someone else's agenda -- St Andrews
marked the occasion proper in 1992, Aberdeen University celebrated it
last year -- Glasgow University decided to fly its centenary flag in
1995, a hundred years on from the graduation of its first woman MA.
Her name was Isabella Blacklock, an Irish girl who had already spent
some years studying at the nearby Queen Margaret College, then the only
Scottish institute catering specifically for women. Set up in 1882, in
the building now occupied by BBC Scotland's Glasgow headquarters, the
college had the support of certain members of the all-male university --
some of them even popped along the way and lectured to the women
students there. But when it came to validating their qualifications . .
. well that was a degree too much.
''These great big diplomas that the college issued were dismissed as
bits of worthless paper. Isabella had one -- she'd completed four, five
years of her course there -- but the university refused to recognise it.
So she had to do all the courses over again to get her arts degree. And
she did. She got her MA in 1895.''
Telling me all this -- and making me feel my own days at Gilmorehill
had been a doddle by comparison -- is Lesley Richmond, deputy archivist
at Glasgow University.
Sitting beside her, mind racing with loose ends that -- like the
marquee she's ordered -- have to be securely pegged down by Saturday, is
Donna Gall. This time last year Donna was a visiting American, doing her
M Phil under the auspices of the Department of Theatre, Film, and Media
Studies. The last thing she reckoned on doing as her next career move
was organising a Centenary Bazaar.
But, like Lesley, she has become utterly absorbed in highlighting not
just the arrival of women in the university, but their ongoing role.
Together they explain the apt significance of the tent and its two-day
programme of events.
In 1882, when Isabel Elder donated North Park House -- renamed Queen
Margaret College and subsequently sold to BBC Scotland in 1934 -- to the
cause of women's education, she stipulated that its running costs had to
be safeguarded by an endowment fund: the sum to be raised was 20,000. In
present cash, not unlike #1m, maybe more.
Ten years later, to top up the fund, a Grand Bazaar was held. Donna
admits to feelings of panic and inadequacy when she browses through
committee minutes for the earlier event. For one thing, it lasted five
days! ''It really was a very high-class affair,'' she says, with a
chuckle. ''All the attendants were done-up in costumes, like dairy
maids. And they sold things like Persian carpets, exotic items, quality
knick-knacks that had been donated by the local gentry -- because they
were the people running it, after all. And there were entertainments,
just about everything from minstrels to polite drawing-room stuff,
recitals, sopranos, you know.''
Her own programme echoes the spirit of that earlier diversity, mixing
traditional crafts with modern activities to celebrate the ongoing
interests and achievements of women. She wants the occasion to be as
lively as possible and so she has asked the various craftswomen if they
can demonstrate their respective skills. It's so that visitors can see
for themselves the labour and expertise that lies behind the articles on
sale. These range from hand-carved musical instruments to hand-felted
hats, embroidered pictures, and painted silks.
On the performance side she has recruited jazz clarinettists, a
traditional harpist, the celebrated drummers, Sheboom, as well as
theatre groups from within the campus. Even the hand that lights the
blue touch-paper on Saturday night is female. ''We've got one of the few
women pyrotechnicians in Britain setting up our firework display,'' says
Donna with a touch of satisfaction.
Elsewhere in the university, visitors can walk round an exhibition
called Blue Stocking, Black Gowns, White Coats that brings together
portraits, anecdotes, and video-ed interviews that evoke the lives and
times of women who were part of this first century of female graduates.
Mind you, it hasn't been particularly easy discovering just who many
of them were. Lesley ruefully points out that the present trend for
parity has meant computerised records such as those held by the National
Library of Scotland which don't discriminate individuals by gender.
''Type in 'woman' and you don't get anywhere. It calls up nothing
whatsoever.'' Come this weekend, however, and pipes will skirl, flags
will fly, and the West Quad will be awash with noise and colour -- all
calling up the pioneering energy of the women who first breached
Glasgow's groves of academe.

FIRST PERSON SINGULAR
In the first of a two-part series, Joe Donnelly describes how the
modern woman is increasingly opting to go it alone
THE SINGLE GIRL, all alone in a great big world. So sang Sandy Posey a
generation back when the single girl, in the words of the song, needed a
single man to lean on.
Then, Sandy's single girl was set to become a wife and a mother, quick
as she could. At 25 time was pushing on; 27 she was pushing her luck; at
30 she was missing the boat; a couple of years later she was over the
hill, on the shelf, all washed up.
That was then: back in the sixties, the fifties, the forties, and
every decade before that to the days when humans developed the marriage
strategy as a way for men to obtain regular sex without having to fight
every other male, and for women to avoid being passed around to any
chance-along victor.
In the space of one short generation, it's all gone awry. Marriage as
an institution, as a cultural imperative, is on the wane. A recent
General Household Survey shows that while the most common domestic
arrangement is a couple without children -- more than a quarter of
households in Britain are one person only.
Marriage rates among men have fallen by a third. Women are not far
behind. Their nuptial statistics are down by a quarter, despite
traditionally being the gender more pressured to marry.
Trial marriages, once an abomination, are more common now than at any
time, with women testing the water before taking any kind of plunge. One
unmarried woman in four is living with a man. Fewer of them are getting
married at all. In 1979, 75% of women between 18 and 49 were wed, and
fewer than 20% were spinsters. Nowadays, less than 60% are hitched and
more than 25% have got off without a hitch, so to speak.
Figures show that the proportion of men between 16 and 29 who were not
married had climbed nine points to 78% between 1981 and 1991, and that
percentage is still growing.
More than 11 million adults in Britain, about a fifth of the entire
population, have not got spliced. There are more than six million single
person households, twice as many as in the sixties when Sandy was
singing ). By the year 2000 the figure could be eight million. Marriage,
it seems, is on the shelf.
Gerry O'Neill is an expert in her field of desktop publishing. She's
30, she's professional, busy and bilingual. She loves to travel. When
she was born, somebody in her present position would be considered a
failure, because she hasn't managed to get A MAN.
Dare she show her face in the street? ''You bet,'' Gerry says,
confiding that she's had the opportunity and didn't snatch at the first
offer, or any subsequent ones for that matter. ''I'm not against
marriage,'' she says. ''It's great for plenty of people, but not for me,
at lease not yet. I can't say when it will be right. Maybe never. Who
knows?''
Gerry is not untypical of today's growing army of shelf dwellers: the
shelfish. ''It was different for our parents' generation. People stayed
at home and then they got married. Now many of us have our own homes,
our own lives and financial independence. It takes a great deal to
consider changing all that.
''The culture is different today. The pressure is no longer there and
we don't feel we have failed if we haven't found a guy to settle down
with, because we are simply not looking. Mr Right, if he does come
along, will have to be Mr Really Impressive.''
Gerry says she knows plenty of people who are not married, through
choice. Most of her friends have not rushed headlong down the aisle.
''I'm not against marriage. In fact, I'm very traditional about it. If
you have children, you should be together and work together and work
towards a common goal.''
''In my family, my dad was the be all and end all.I had traditional
fifties parents. My mother was there, making meals and providing for us
all, while my dad was the one who did all the fun things, all the
adventurous things. It was only when I got older that I realised it was
my mother's great strength that made the family such a success. I don't
know if I could be that strong.''
But she is able to do the fun and adventurous things herself;
escapades that might not be so easy were she trammelled by a mate with
the urge to make her settle down and procreate.
''I love to travel. I've sailed tall ships in the Caribbean and I'm
trying to get sponsorship for a place on the Operation Raleigh trip to
Chile this winter. It's a three month jaunt and I don't think I could do
it if I were married.''
And social life? Cinema, theatre, nights out and nights in with the
girls. ''Sounds like Spinsters Club International,'' she says, ''but we
do have fun. We like men. One of these days, maybe one of these
days...''
Beth Ritchie
BETH, at 34, is not ready to let a permanent relationship interfere
with her work or her play. ''It's a pretty full and exhausting life I
lead,'' she said. ''A man would have to be pretty fit if he wanted to
keep up.''
Indeed he would. Beth's a Glasgow west-ender who plays a powerful game
of squash. She gets on court twice a week at least, Mondays and
Thursdays. On Tuesday nights she is studying and preparing work for the
word processing college class she teaches on Wednesdays.
On Friday she goes out with the girls. Her group of friends, in their
twenties and thirties, are professional working women, renting or owning
their own flats, making their own way.
''When people get to know you they realise you are your own person,
and not an extension of anybody else. You have your own ideas, thoughts
and attitudes. There are plenty of single men who think the same way.
''Not every single girl is the same, though there seem to be more of
us now. Some girls are looking for a husband, but they don't seem to be
so happy, or enjoy such a good life.
''Having said that, the world is geared for couples and towards
familes. If you go to the cinema or theatre on your own, people look at
you as if there was something wrong with you. Society has imposed the
stigma that you can't be single and enjoy it, but society is wrong.''
Cath Docherty
CATH is section supervisor with a large financial corporation. She
earns big money and drives a compact, but quality car. At 32, it is 15
years since, while still at school, a boyfriend proposed to her.
''He was serious,'' she says. ''I was his first girlfriend and I think
he was scared he might never get another. He was jealous, too. If I
looked at another boy, he'd fly off the handle. He wanted to own me. Two
other girls who had been in my class in school got married that year.
They're both divorced now, both wondering what happened to their lives.
''I just didn't want to get married at all. My mother was married
young, at 19.She had three children by the time she was 24 and after a
gap, another two. At home my father ruled the roost. His tea was always
on the table when he came in. He'd eat it and then he'd either sit and
watch television or go out to the pub. On Saturdays he'd be at Parkhead
and on Saturday nights he'd be drunk.
''My mother never seemed to go out, except to my aunt's, and if she
was still out when dad came home he'd go into a mood. My mum was up at
the crack of dawn to get us all ready and she had a part-time job in a
shop. But she did all the ironing and the washing and the gardening as
well. She never complained, not that I ever heard, but it put me right
off.
''It seemed all so one sided. I loved my mum, but I didn't want to be
like her. They abolished slavery a long time ago, but it still exists.
''I have a very busy social life, unlike my mother. I go to parties,
to theatre and opera. I like live music, particularly jazz, so if
there's a good band, I'll be there. I don't have to think about it, or
apologise for going out, or for coming back late. I just do it.
Karen McDade
''MY mother brought me up to be independent, and she gave me a sense
of fair play. She had three daughters and three sons, and made sure we
were all treated equally.
''She always told me not to rush into anything, and I intend to take
her advice.'' Karen is 24, is busy building a career with Alan Clark
Associates, a PR Consultancy, lives with her mum, has a boyfriend, and
still enjoys being single.
''I know that a generation or so back I'd be pushing things, getting
close to being on the shelf, but remember, I'm just starting out. I was
in school for 'O' levels and highers, then spent five years at
university to get an honours degree in economics and marketing. I have
ambitions and there are things I want to do and achieve before I ever
get married.
''Getting married at this stage would be a waste for me, personally
speaking. I would not like to have come out of all that studying to
start a career as a wife. That doesn't preclude the prospect some time
in the future, but there's no rush.
''Basically I'm free to do anything, try anything I want. People
realise now, more than ever before, that women have their own life to
lead. It will take time for women to become equal in all aspects of
business management, but in a personal way, there is equality.''
Christine Hamilton
''THE worst thing about being single is having to find somebody to
feed the cat when you're away.'' So says Christine Hamilton, deputy
director of the Scottish Arts Council. And the best? ''Sitting up
watching NYPD Blue and eating chocolate.
''There's a growth in the number of people who live on their own
because they choose. It really is a question of choice. A great many
women I studied with at uni are still on their own and happy so.
''The single life, apart from the cat-feeding, is an unfettered one.
You can have a good time and you have your own space. It would be
difficult to give it up.
''It can mean being lonely at times, but you gain an emotional
equilibrium. You only have to cope with your own moods.''
The only potential shadow, Christine sees, is some time in the hazy
future. ''I'm thinking ahead to life as a Golden Girl. Maybe when I'm
older, I might want to share.''
But not yet.

BANK OF SCOTLAND 1695-95, A VERY SINGULAR INSTITUTION. By Alan
Cameron. Mainstream: #14.99
IT is in keeping with the house style of Scotland's oldest surviving
bank, the Bank of Scotland, that when its percentenary arrived this year
it was decided that the celebrations should not occupy the entire 12
months.
They should start, decreed the present Governor, Sir Bruce Pattullo,
no sooner than Burns' birthday on January 25 and end by St Andrew's Day
on November 30.
That balance -- due restraint tempering a determination to celebrate
to the full the longevity of what Alan Cameron's new book calls a very
singular institution -- speaks resonantly of the way they do things on
the Mound, from which this creation of the final years of the old
Scottish Parliament continues to survey the capital of a nation still
wrestling with issues of statehood.
Cameron is a professional archivist who joined the bank in 1986, the
first professional to take charge of what must be one of the richest
private stores of historical documents in the land. His handsome,
lavishly illustrated volume is the first of two new histories due to
appear this year. The second, a fuller academic account by Dr Richard
Saville of St Andrews University, comes later.
It is the fate of company histories, particularly those which court
popular appeal, to risk the corporate equivalent of hagiography.
Sometimes, when unpleasant past truths are broached the client takes
cold feet. Thus, when an Edinburgh fund management group commissioned an
outsider to write its history in the early eighties, the resulting
volume was thought to speak so roughly of some of the still-living
participants that, after much soul searching, circulation was finally
restricted to the 12 members of the board.
Alan Camerom writes as an insider, but, happily in a volume which will
find its way into the hands of Bank of Scotland staff and many
customers, big and small, he has not felt constrained to dwell only on
the high points in the bank's long history.
He strikes a balanced note at the outset pointing out that, while
formal histories of organisations often wrestle unsuccessfully with the
roots of their presumed uniqueness, what really matters to many is the
informal history which has been shaped and handed down by generations
through their collective consciousness.
''So far as can be judged, the Bank of Scotland has always possessed a
guid conceit o' itself,'' he writes, adding that this has not always
been an unqualified blessing. In a comment which echoes Sir Bruce's
mention of occasional visitations of plague and pestilence in his
Governor's foreword, Cameron promises, in effect, to visit the troughs
and miscalculations as well as the peaks in the story which follows.
Some of the troughs were reached very quickly. The new bank was
founded in July 1695 by the Act of the Scots Parliament, but the man
generally given credit for promoting the idea was an Englishman, John
Holland, from Essex seafaring stock, who briefly served as the first
Governor. The idea of the new bank was promoted as much from London as
from Edinburgh and was seen by some at the time as a cat's paw for the
East India Company. Very quickly its legal banking monopoly was
threatened by the more financially robust Darien Company, one of whose
main promoters was William Paterson, ironically a Dumfries man who
founded the Bank of England.
The Bank of Scotland survived that early crisis, just. Other financial
crises followed, notably in 1704. Then the Act of Union, which the
bank's directors supported, challenged its monopoly north of the Border.
In 1716 a renewal of its initial 21-year monopoly was decisively
rejected by the Privy Council in London. The Bank of England wanted its
writ to run all across the new Union. In the process the Bank of
Scotland was tarred, wrongly in Cameron's view, with being the Jacobite
bank.
By 1727 it faced competition on its own patch from the newly formed
Royal Bank of Scotland. Indeed it was to prove more than competition.
Scottish banking was in for a sustained period of warfare.
Cameron's account is at its most vivid in these turbulent early
decades when the new bank was striving to forge and then protect its
emerging identity. Later chapters have to contend with the fact that the
Bank of Scotland we know today is the result of the merger of many
disparate banking strains. In the post-war era alone we have seen the
acquisition of the Union Bank of Scotland, completed in 1955, and the
1971 merger with British Linen Bank.
So a lot of what goes before in this history is, of necessity, the
story of the evolution of other banks which would, one day, add new
flavours to the Bank of Scotland mix. This book becomes, in effect, a
mini-history of Scottish banking.
There are dramatic moments as in the collapse of the Ayr Bank in 1772
and the Glasgow banking crisis of the 1850s which so soured relations
with London. Cameron says the Bank of Scotland's own account of the time
revealed that the latter crisis, and in particular the complete collapse
of the Western Bank came close to pulling down the entire Scottish
banking structure.
When he reaches recent decades, Cameron's account, perhaps for legal
reasons, opts for circumspection when discussing some key events. He is
expansive in writing about the bank's lead role in pioneering new
technology in banking and financing the development of offshore oil and
gas discoveries in the North Sea.
But the Guinness Affair, in which the then Governor Sir Tom Risk was
unceremoniously dumped from his promised chairmanship of the drinks
giant to make way for Ernest Saunders, is covered in less than one
single bland page.
But, over the piece, thanks to a levening of the heavier diet with
tales of bungled forgeries, a Burns poem written on the back of a Bank
of Scotland guinea note, and even the last duel in Scotland featuring
the bank's agent in Kirkcaldy, Alan Cameron has produced an engaging
account of the evolution of Scottish banking and the Bank of Scotland's
place within it. If your branch manager offers you a copy turn a few
pages before you consign it to the bookshelf.

AN INVESTIGATION into a bid for #175,000 of council cash for a
heritage centre in Uist has found two instances of ''potential
impropriety''.
Western Isles councillors will be told next week that documents used
by Celtic Quest Trust, now known as Uist Heritage Trust, had shown the
council's own depute director of administration, Mr Donald Martin, as a
trustee.
However, the report to members, by Mr Martin's boss, administration
director Robert Barnett, says the necessary permission had not been
given by the council for him to act in that capacity.
It makes the point that Mr Martin had made it clear he could not act
in that capacity unless he had that permission.
The suggestion he was a trustee was ''a potential impropriety which
may be evident'', says the report, which was instigated following a
motion by Benbecula councillor Colin Campbell.
It was discovered recently that the council has been considering the
application from the trust when it has not yet been properly
constituted.
The application was for assistance with revenue costs of #175,000,
phased over three years, and sponsorship by the council to help with the
bid for further Objective One priority EU funding.
The idea for the centre had grown out of plans for Jacobite
celebrations to commemorate Bonnie Prince Charlie's flight to the isles.
Mr Barnett's investigation also found that Councillor David Blaney
(Lochboisdale) was said in a trust document to be a trustee.
Councillors will be told: ''This is an instance of potential
impropriety in connection with the approach.
''Mr Blaney should not have been represented as a trustee if, as he
says, he is not a trustee.''
Mr Ray Burnett, a former councillor, of Torlum Schoolhouse, Benbecula,
is named as the person who approached the council and other bodies in
connection with the trust bid.
He appears to have been ''leading'' the application for the trust,
says the report.
It says Councillor Blaney helped to disseminate information about the
project to members and that Councillor Mary Bremner (Iochdar) asked a
council meeting whether she should declare an interest. No such
declaration was made.
Councillor Blaney has reported to Mr Barnett that he has had a
document under the name of Uist Heritage Trust listing Councillor
Bremner, hotelier Stephen Peteranna, and local priest Father Macneill as
the trustees.
Councillors will be told that where any financial interests are not
declared, it may be a matter for the police and the procurator-fiscal.
The council's own findings, that Uist Heritage Trust has wrongly used
two persons' names as trustees, come just a few weeks after a similar
denial by an EU official.
M Jean-Didier Hache, the executive secretary of the Islands Commission
at the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions Of Europe in Belgium,
took exception to press reports of his being on the Uist centre steering
group.
On March 10, he wrote, in a letter to the West Highland Free Press:
''. . . I have not been contacted to be part of such a steering group
and I am not associated to that scheme''.
Mrs Bremner could not be contacted yesterday.
Mr Burnett said he was unable to offer any comment on the director of
administration's report.

INTERNATIONAL conferences are a bit like royal or head of state
funerals -- a good excuse for a get together at which top people can
meet their peers without expectations being raised as to the outcome. At
such funerals, once the formal display of grief is over, the great and
the good congregate over the baked meats and the reviving waters to talk
about the issues of the day in groups or in pairs.
The family may mourn, but the mourners negotiate. It is all very
discreet, and because they have not met formally no announcements need
be made about their meeting and nothing is expected to flow from their
talks.
In these days of instant diplomacy, what with television and faxes,
such occasions are a welcome relief, a harking back to the good old days
when telegrams took weeks to arrive and by the time they had heard about
something back home it was probably decided one way or the other. At
funerals people who had not spoken to one another in years could start
doing so again without loss of face, brought together in their shared
loss.
However, funerals are erratic affairs -- they occur when they occur.
Conferences, not quite so good a face saver, are more frequent and still
provide in the margins, which is diplomatic speak for discussing things
which have nothing whatever to do with the reason for being there,
opportunities for contacts which could not be made formally.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference,
which opens today in New York, is a case in point. Douglas Hurd is off
tomorrow to speak to it, and his speech will be a substantial one.
Britain is one of the five nuclear weapon states recognised by the
treaty and the Foreign Secretary will announce that Britain is to end
the production of weapons-grade nuclear material to demonstrate our
commitment to disarmament. The five powers want an unconditional and
indefinite extension of the 25-year-old treaty, which is due to expire,
a decision requiring the approval of just over half the 175 nations
party to it.
The treaty has worked well. When it was signed the fear was that
nuclear weapons would spread round the world and be in the hands of all
sorts of dangerous unstable countries. In fact, only three countries,
apart from the five authorised to do so, are known either to possess, or
have the capability to produce, nuclear weapons -- India, Israel, and
Pakistan.
There is some doubt about North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, of course, but
the sea of nuclear weaponry engulfing the world which was feared has not
materialised. However, the end of the Cold War requires gestures on the
part of the five towards increasing the pace of disarmament, hence Mr
Hurd's offer. The old balance-of-power certainties no longer apply.
There may be grounds for retaining some capabilities, but being able to
match, or outmatch, the Evil Empire is no longer a factor.
It will be all very worthwhile, but the conference is not going to
occupy him exclusively over the next two days. After Mr Hurd arrives in
New York tomorrow morning it is a case of straight away to the margins.
He is to have lunch with the Chinese Foreign Minister, a meeting of very
real importance given the way the progress on the hand-over of Hong Kong
has become bogged down.
His aim will be to try to give things another kickstart, but it is, of
course, only a lunch so if nothing comes of it no face is lost. He will
also have talks with the Ukrainian, Canadian, and Australian Foreign
Ministers, and then in the afternoon deliver his speech.
So much for the conference, but then the real work is done by
officials not Ministers. In the evening he will have dinner with the UN
Secretary-General and that will cover a whole range of important issues
from Bosnia to Iraq to the state of the UN's finances. Indeed in all the
talks in the margins Bosnia and Iraq will be the main topics.
Things in the former Yugoslavia are getting no better. But just what
we can do to improve them is questionable, and certainly an initiative
-- Mr Hurd stomping about having Bosnia chats with people on their home
territory -- would do no good. Such quiet talking, however, might shift
an attitude or come up with an idea. The point is that they might talk
about Bosnia, but they could as easily be talking about the high cost of
hotel laundries, if they so wish.
A superstructure of to-be-filled hopes cannot be erected, which is
what matters. On Wednesday, before returning to London, he will have yet
more talks with one of his peers, the Japanese Foreign Minister -- and
again there is a lot to discuss, including the strength of the yen, the
economic changes the Japanese government is attempting to introduce, and
its problems with urban terrorism.
Not that the NPT conference will have ended. It goes on until May 12
because the wheeling and dealing by officials required to secure the
expected new deal remains enormous. For Mr Hurd it is not delivering the
speech that matters -- the change of policy could have been revealed by
somebody else -- but the tremendous bonus of meeting all those people in
one place.
Today's international politicians may know each other better than they
once did, and they can talk easily enough, even if John Major and Bill
Clinton did seem to have some problems with their telephones, but
nothing can replace the face-to-face. They are, however, exhausting. Mr
Hurd may have spent Easter at home, but last week he was in Poland and
Slovakia for three days, and before that -- well he is never off the
face of the road, poor chap.

THE Ministry of Defence yesterday admitted that alternatives to
privatisation moves for Rosyth Naval Dockyard may have to be considered
after union claims that the sell-off plans were in ''crisis''.
A spokesman for the MoD said: ''Privatisation on the right terms
remains our preferred option but other options have not been ruled out
and the dockyard will not be disposed of on unfavourable terms.''
The spokesman denied that talks with the unions had been scrapped but
admitted that a request for a meeting next Friday had been turned down.
Dockyard unions spokesman Brian Negus said the Government appeared to
be left with two options if the sale proposals fall through. A new
contract could be issued for an independent team to run the yard,
currently managed by Babcock, or it could return to its pre-1987 status
of a government-owned, government-operated yard.
''This would mean everyone going back into the civil service, which
would certainly secure workers' terms and conditions,'' said Mr Negus.
However, he claimed the Government was keeping the Rosyth workforce of
3500uninformed of the sell-off plans, which union chiefs have claimed
are in ''crisis''.
''All we are told is it's up in the air. Nobody's come out and said
your terms and conditions are secure. Morale is extremely low in the
dockyard at the moment,'' he said.
The only bid for Rosyth, he said, had come from the present managers,
Babcock International, with special conditions making the Government
responsible for redundancy provision. The company also said it would not
accept liability for cleaning up contaminated ground at the dockyard,
said Mr Negus.
T &amp; G national secretary Jack Dromey claimed yesterday that the MoD
now stands to receive no more than a ''pittance'' if privatisation of
Rosyth and its sister dockyard at Devonport goes ahead.
According to the unions, an MoD assessment of the bid presented to
Ministers last month highlighted the extent of the difficulties now
facing the sell-off.
Apart from the relatively low offers because of the lack of
competition, the main stumbling block was said to be the #300m-plus in
pension and redundancy entitlement accrued by the dockyard workers which
the new owners would be obliged to take on.
Mr Dromey claimed Ministers were now desperately trying to find a way
around the liabilities while sweetening the deals by adding extra land
to the packages on offer in order to raise more cash.
The unions are now demanding an urgent meeting with Defence Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind to seek an assurance that their members' entitlements
will not be affected by the sale.

THERE are two irreconcilable camps. Those who see only furry tails,
cutey pie little paws, big brown eyes, and breathtaking athleticism. The
rest of us know that grey squirrels are just overgrown rats with a good
press agent. Greedy overgrown rats. Visitors whose table manners make
the average porker seem a model of gastronomic delicacy.
We knew naught of all this in our rural virginity as we began a double
life living in the country and working in town. In fact we knew damn all
about most things that inhabited the green bits on the map, as was to
become alarmingly clear. But being neighbourly sorts we stuck out some
nuts and sunflower seeds and suchlike in the hope of signalling to the
airborne division that we were at least partially in residence, and
intent on being user friendly to the folks already installed on our
patch.
Some folks in feather dropped by. The new birdspotters' bible was
consulted, and it appeared we were living in the company of most known
varieties of tits, some chaffinches, robins, thrushes, blackbirds,
siskings, rooks, jackdaws, and collared doves. David Attenborough, eat
your heart out. Then came the patter of not-so-tiny paws. The birds
scattered, the squirrel shinned up the apple tree, settled down nicely
alongside the nutholder and got well stuck in.
The next day, for afters, he vandalised the sunflower holder and
polished off the contents there too.
The birdspotters' bible seemed somewhat deficient in this form of
crisis management, so we bought another tome featuring advice to the
rurally challenged. Which told us that of course you didn't just stick
the nutholder straight on to a branch. You suspended it from a
squirrel-proof wire. Of course. So we did. And along came the patter of
not-so-tiny paws. The squirrel ambled up the tree, toddled along the
branch, anchored himself by his tail, swung effortlessly down on the
nutholder and resumed lunch.
There weren't any sunflower seeds left so he popped over instead to
the new bird table (the birds, by week three, had comprehensively more
furniture than the house), climbed on to the feeding tray, and hoovered
up every scrap of leftovers.
We went back to the tome. Squirrels can be prevented from climbing (it
says here) if you put a piece of plasting tubing around the area you
wish protected. Squirrels cannot get a grip on shin plastic (it says
here). Now I'm not sure entirely what went wrong at that juncture. Could
be our squirrel was illiterate, or could be he just decided to skip the
relevant chapter. Anyway nobody had told him he couldn't negotiate
plastic and so he did.
Every single day we put out food.
Neither was he a chap with a conservative or picky palate. Come summer
he ate all but three of the strawberries, evidently aware this was de
rigueur during Wimbledon fortnight. Our fledgling apple tree sported
three apples. Two committed suicide on the paving stones below. The
third blossomed nicely as we all watched. The husband, me, and the
squirrel.
And one morning it was ready. Ripe and firm and gleaming. The squirrel
made a leisurely ascent, pulled it into his paws, sat down, and ate it
as we gawped from the window. Had he had a spare couple of digits to
raise in our direction his message could not have been clearer.
Meantime it became evident that while he spent an inordinate amount of
time feeding, that wasn't all that he did well or regularly. The day
dawned when I was knocking furiously on the kitchen window at another
intrusion, suggesting it had better lay off the bacon rind if it wanted
to see tomorrow, when I heard a similar burst of invective from another
room. We didn't just have one squirrel any more. In fact, by the end of
the month we didn't have just two. Our restaurant was now the stomping
ground for at least one entire family.
Furthermore, sleek and fat as they were, none of them showed the
slightest sign of curling up for the winter and giving the birds a
sporting chance of a decent meal. We sought advice from the locals, all
of whom suggested a variety of nasty fates which could apparently be
arranged for a small fee. Poisoning was out of the question. Apart from
the unsavoury nature of that proposition, there was no telling what else
might drop by for a snack. The cleanest solution, we kept being told,
was to phone the chap who was paid by the Ministry of Defence to keep
one of its submarine bases a squirrel-free zone. Speaking personally, if
it comes down to neutralising local menaces, I'd much rather the bloke
in question had found some way of seeing off the subs.
But in any event we couldn't bring ourselves to ask him round. Even if
he could be relied on to kill rather than wound, it turned out that
neither of us had the stomach for it.
So we dispatched a cheque for yet more specialised literature.
Courtesy of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds we discovered
that they sold nutholders with bars round them. Bars that let birds in
and kept furryboots out. We bought two. And hung them. And watched
triumphantly as the greedy little sods tried vainly to crack the system.
The birds were pretty chuffed too. In fact the birds went forth and
multiplied. They now enjoy five feeding stations and the undivided
attention of two demented commuters who have been known to make 100-mile
round trips to pop up the goodies on cold days when they're trapped by
the necessity of paid employment and need to hang out in the big city
instead of the drama-laden countryside.
As a matter of fact all this enthusiastic reproductive activity has
rather put us in the notion of enlarging our own family. Does anyone
know if puppies eat sunflower seeds?

TO despondent Conservatives the Easter break offers a brief respite
from what promises to be as dire a year as last. There is little to look
forward to. The Chancellor will probably just be able to wait until
after the English local election results before raising interest rates
though, judging by the Scottish outcome, it would not matter much if he
didn't wait.
Even before that, Labour are likely to produce a Commons motion
condemning NHS reorganisation in London on which it is hard to see the
Government avoiding defeat. Several London Tory MPs blasted Mrs Virginia
Bottomley in such vitriolic terms that it is hard to see how they could
oppose the Labour motion.
It would be unwise of Scottish readers to regard the London hospitals
brouhaha as an incident in a faraway capital with only local
implications. For Mrs Bottomley's difficulties are a good illustration
of where the Government's policies have gone wrong. Easily summed up in
two words -- ''detail'' and ''presentation''.
The state of health provision in London demanded reform. Primary
services, such as GPs, are poorly provided in many boroughs. Some
important specialities are spread over a number of hospitals when they
would be better operating from one or two centres of excellence. As the
capital, London has a high proportion of famous hospitals with proud
traditions whose staffs, naturally, want them to continue as they are.
Mrs Bottomley has been prepared to grasp the nettle and go for change
but, in a sensitive area in which no Minister can be personally expert,
she has been let down by some of the calculations done for her and her
own failure to present the reform more compellingly. Although there is a
good case for arguing that London is over provided with major speciality
beds there is not such a good one, as angry local MPs point out, for
stating that the capital is over bedded as far as general hospital
services are concerned. Hence, closures have led to cases of patients
being shuttled around the city or even the country in search of a vacant
bed.
Some of these incidents would doubtless have happened anyway. A
service covering 56 million people is always going to produce hard or
bizarre cases. But, as the Government are reforming the NHS, the reforms
are blamed, only sometimes rightly, for all the cockups.
The same failure in detail and presentation affected the Government
over English education. The original idea, under Mrs Thatcher, was that
the three Rs should be re-established and that testing should be
introduced aimed at monitoring which children had reached a suitable
level of knowledge for their age and which had not. That simple concept
was placed in the hands of educational advisers to produce a series of
complex schemes that drove teachers wild and perplexed parents.
Successive Secretaries of State also allowed the concept of a basic
national curriculum to be so complicated that the all-important support
of parents was jeopardised.
The present Minister, Mrs Gillian Shephard, has been trying to calm
things down but at the cost of having to hold her hand on another
obvious reform, to create a single examining board for England. Rail
privatisation is another policy where Ministers have found that ''the
devil is in the detail''. Privatising the railways may or may not be a
good idea but the very complex method the Government have chosen may
scupper the idea anyway.
When the detail goes wrong Ministers find presentation harder if not
impossible. Baited by her own back benchers, Mrs Bottomley was able to
argue with some conviction that reform had to come but was not able to
carry the same conviction that what she was actually proposing would
produce that much better a service. My own guess is that, even with the
miscalculations built into her plans, it will in the long term do so.
But the Government, politically, do not have a long term. They have 18
months to two years.
However, they now also have a new blueprint outlining ways of
reassuring ''Middle England'' voters and bringing them back to the
party. Some Tories claim to be very impressed with this blueprint
produced by Mr Norman Blackwell, the new head of Mr Major's policy unit
in Downing Street.
Certainly a clearly mapped strategy is essential. Mr Blackwell has
given additional impetus to the idea of making the middle classes better
off through tax cuts, a much higher inheritance tax threshold and
dramatic incentives to savers.
But, although stressing that publicly provided health and education,
which most of the middle class still use, must match the standards of
the best private provision, Mr Blackwell's paper does not, I understand,
indicate how this can be done.
A taskforce of Ministers are now to fall on Mr Blackwell's paper and
put practical flesh on its bones. Raising public standards to private
levels while still giving themselves room for tax cuts will cause a few
headaches, I reckon.
Another problem, which they may not have time to do much about, is
that they currently look like arriving at the next General Election with
some policies in the course of implementation in a way that is not going
to do them much good with voters.
Of course Mr Blair's now rather protracted honeymoon with the voters
may not last as it appears to be ending with some trade unions. Perhaps
the special conference will continue to saddle him with Clause 4. But if
the Tories' present luck holds he will be able to kill it off against
the votes of some union barons, giving him two victories instead of one.
If he does and Government disasters continue through to the autumn
then Conservative MPs, who by then will be feeling pretty desperate, may
conclude that their only possible answer to new Labour is a new leader
and a change, either real or simulated, of direction.

<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Defence has revealed it will save millions of pounds
by not closing the firing range at Dundrennan, near Kirkcudbright.
This is because it will not have to de-contaminate the 4500-acre range
where the country's depleted uranium test firing programme was
undertaken.
The MoD announced in March that the range, which was due to be axed
with the loss of 100 jobs under the defence review carried out last
year, would stay open for three years.
After that time, the workforce will be cut to six -- the number
required to ensure the security of the range. The MoD says it will
operate the range after this period on a ''campaign'' basis with trials
teams being brought in.
Campaigners who have called for the range to be cleaned up say this is
the Ministry's way of saving what would run into tens of millions of
pounds for decontamination work.
Thousands of DU shells, similar to those used in the Gulf War, have
been fired over the range during 12 years of testing. Many landed in the
Solway but, despite costly searches by diving teams and the Royal Navy,
none is believed to have been recovered.
Mr Dan Kenny, who has campaigned against the firing of the DU shells
and for a general clean-up of beaches and coastline because of
contamination from nuclear waste from Sellafield in Cumbria, said: ''The
cost for the clean-up of the range would be colossal, probably more than
#100m. By keeping the range open with only six security staff they don't
need to do anything more.''
Council workers at the Dundrennan range have argued that keeping
Kirkcudbright open and closing Eskmeals in Cumbria would mean bigger
savings for the Ministry.
However, in a letter to Stewartry District Council, Mr Alan Tindall,
assistant director of test and evaluation with the Ministry, says:
''Cost is only one of the factors to be taken into account when looking
at the need for facilities in the test and evaluation area.
''But it is worth noting that operating Kirkcudbright on a
''campaign'' basis will save considerably more over the next 10 years
than the #5.7m anticipated from complete closure last July and
approaching the savings of #21.1m which we estimated the closure of
Eskmeals would have achieved.
''This is because retaining the range, even with a very small
permanent staff, means that we avoid the major costs of reproviding
facilities and decontaminating the range.''
One council worker at the range, said yesterday: ''They say the Army
is expressing an interest in using the range for training but we are
sceptical about this.
''They have changed their minds before and could do the same again
once the rundown is on.''

In the 1980s many Guatemalan peasants supported armed insurgents in
the hope of regaining control of their historic lands. They were
ruthlessly crushed, with dictator General Efrain Rios Montt playing an
important role in the genocide. Now the General is running for the
presidency, and there is a real danger, according to David Shanks, that
his campaign will succeed.
THE land of Guatemala is a celebration of creation. Active volcanoes
tower over Lake Atitlan, casting omnipresent shadows over the crystal
surface. In the enchanted cloud forest of the Peten, trees touch the
sky, their canopy forming a brilliant green sea of foliage 60 metres
above the forest floor. Slanting mountain ranges stretch across the
Mayan Highlands, jagged peaks zig-zagging dramatically against the
horizon.
Along the main roads men can be seen wearing straw cowboy hats, long
machetes hanging in intricately decorated sheaths from their belts. The
women are dressed in traditional traje, intensely coloured hand-woven
blouses and skirts that vary in design from town to town. Tied across
their chests are rebosos, large shawls in which to secure their babies
on their backs.
The Mayans, Guatemala's original inhabitants, live for the land. It
has been the source of life for them since the beginning of time.
Justina Canil and Rosario Pu of CERJ and CUC, organisations working for
the rights of campesinos (peasants) emphasise the land's importance:
''The Mother Earth is our sustenance, our life. It gives us life. We
cultivate it, it gives us food. Without the land we have nothing.''
Rosario adds: ''For us land is not just an economic commodity, it is a
part of our culture; with the fields, the mountains, and the forests we
have ancient roots. The earth is a part of our culture that we cannot do
without.''
Since the Spanish conquest, the Mayans have suffered at the hands of a
powerful minority. Nearly five centuries on, the land remains in the
hands of a minority.
Land is the greatest source of wealth in Guatemala, with agriculture
providing 24.8% of the GNP. According to Unicef, nearly 90% of the
parcels of land make up only 16% of the cultivated surface. Owners of
large farms, known as fincas, account for 2% of the parcels and nearly
two-thirds of all cultivable land. The agricultural system is
fundamentally based on elitism and exploitation. Campesinos can either
rent low-quality land at extortionate prices or find seasonal work in
the harvesting of crops, where they are frequently paid below the
minimum daily wage of $2.58.
Guatemalan history is full of Mayan uprisings against the landed
elites. In the 1980s many rural Mayans supported the armed insurgents in
the hope of regaining control of their historic lands.
They did not anticipate how viciously the army would respond.
Counter-insurgency troops destroyed 440 villages and killed up to
150,000 civilians. General Efrain Rios Montt, a dictator dressed in
khaki military fatigues, played an important role in this genocide.
After seizing power in a coup in 1982, Rios ran a scorched-earth
campaign in the Mayan Highlands that destroyed hundreds of thousands of
families and homes. During his 17 months of rule, the army left vast
areas of cultivable land useless and abandoned.
Now, 13 years on, Rios Montt has returned to the political fray,
having announced his run for the Guatemalan presidency. In a recent
television interview he sat comfortably in a plush leather armchair,
aggressive military fatigues dispensed of in favour of a shiny suit that
matched his silver hair. A glowing smile completed his new image. When
questioned about his chequered past, Rios Montt casually chuckled that
he had forgotten about the past and that he only lived in the present.
Some Mayan campesinos seem to have forgotten too. Despite the
atrocities committed under his power, in Mayan areas Rios Montt did well
in the last regional elections. The rural communities generally hold
army commanders independently responsible for the massacres of the 80s.
A reason for this is that Rios Montt is perversely remembered by many as
the man who brought law and order to the country, effectively dealing
with rebel sympathisers and violence in the cities. With 138
extrajudicial executions and 108 forced disappearances reported in 1994,
Rios Montt is seen by some as the person to set things straight.
Such naivety regarding the situation in their country is widespread
among campesinos. Many have little or no knowledge of the Global
Agreement for Human Rights signed by the Government, army and
guerrillas. Many are unaware of the presence of United Nations human
rights observers in the country. One explanation is that many of them do
not speak or understand Spanish, the official language. There are 22
other Mayan languages.
But as Justina of CERJ exlains, the situation is less simple: ''There
is a problem in the dissemination of information in this country that
does not help Mayans. The army feeds them propaganda, telling them that
the war is over and that we at last have peace. The people just don't
know what's going on. Even if they do understand the Global Agreement,
they don't believe in it because the violations continue every day.''
This naivety is not as widespread as the army or Rios Montt would
like. The human rights community, the political left, and the popular
organisations all understand the past decades and lay much of the blame
on the General. Addressing Rios Montt, journalist Estuardo Zapeto
recently wrote: ''You say that during your dictatorship you killed
nobody. You tell me that you are accused unjustly. You forget. I don't.
I saw the dead. Yes, they were Indians who mean nothing to you. But for
me they mean much more. I saw the mutilated bodies. Bodies scarred with
the inscription 'here died the communists' patiently etched with
cigarettes. Raped women bound in wire. They were Indians.''
Rios Montt's candidacy contradicts a constitutional prohibition of
beneficiaries of coups being elected as President. But Guatemalan law is
renowned for its loopholes. It is a dangerous and real prospect. He
represents a level of impunity and discrimination whose fundamental aim
appears to be cultural genocide.
The terror of the 80s left millions of desplazados -- Mayans either
driven off their land or fleeing in terror to neighbouring regions or
towns. Whole communities moved en masse to form shanty-town settlements
in and around Guatemala City. Leaving behind simple lives where they
lived off the land, these people have become embroiled in an urban
nightmare.
The latest statistics from Unicef state that 30% of Guatemala City's
population lives in marginalised urban slums. Three quarters of these
people live in tiny, precarious shacks with an average of more than six
people in each dwelling. Barely 4% have access to running water.
Mezquital is such a community. It lies in a dust bowl on the outskirts
of Guatemala City. Balancing precariously on a plateau above a steep
ravine that houses a rubbish dump, this area embodies the new life
hundreds of thousands of campesinos have encountered in the metropolis.
The road doubles as the pavement, with streams of misty white raw sewage
flowing past people's front doors.
Children, as well as playing in the streams, splash them across the
roads to stop clouds of dust being kicked up by passing vehicles.
Nondescript entrances take you from the street into a dark labyrinth of
poverty and noise. These disposable houses, made with planks of wood for
walls and corrugated iron roofs, often disappear at the same speed as
they arrive, the anonymous gaps left behind evidence of a family who
could not pay the rent or fell foul of the landlord.
A musty smell of burning rotted rubbish emanates from the dump, where
open fires billow smoke and fumes towards the settlement. Set back in
gaps vacated by houses are fruit and vegetable stalls. On offer are
succulent papaya, melons, and avocados, symbols of health and life that
stand out among so much deprivation and decay.
Small tiendas are dotted along the road where windows have been cut
from the walls of houses for tiny shops to be set up in the front room.
These sell confectionery, cigarettes, and cheap liquor. With a 72%
unemployment rate in these areas it is common for men to gather outside
the tiendas in the morning and drink the day away.
Twenty-one-year-olds dying through alcoholism are not unusual in
Guatemala. Later in the day drunks litter the road, crumpled bodies
helplessly exposed to the intense afternoon sun and the attentions of
starving dogs that resemble walking carcasses, rib-cages rippling under
their skin. For the grubby, insect-ridden children playing amid these
scenes, there can be little hope of a better life.
Life is not sweet for these Mayans. They have been engaged in a
centuries-long struggle for land and identity, bearing the brunt of
extreme violence and hardship. Many have ended up living an urban life
that is historically alien to them, that is eroding their culture.
Osvaldo Jom Quej, of the Guatemalan Academy for Mayan Languages,
explains: ''They believe the land is ancestrally theirs, and for this
reason they want to win it back. The land is in the hands of a few, but
it's the majority that needs it.''
Recent weeks have seen 82 fincas occupied by protesting campesinos. A
whole community set up camp in the Parque Central outside the National
Palace, under appalling living conditions. They are demanding land
reforms that will enable them to own small parcels of cultivable land as
opposed to the present system where they rent from large owners. They
also demand that unpaid social security benefits are fulfilled.
It is ironic that a land with so many endearing qualities has been
such a continuous cause of so much strife. The current peace
negotiations (in which the majority Mayan population is unrepresented)
have ground to a halt over the land question. The guerrillas cite this
historic problem as one of the principal causes of their 35-year-old
uprising. As a result, the Government and army believe that the
campesinos and popular organisations like CUC and CERJ are allies of the
guerrillas. Government officials admit that the guerrillas' main
financial source is from extortion committed against the land owners,
which allegedly amounted to $4.5m in 1994.
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has advised the campesinos that only
by using legal methods will they attain their objectives. Osvaldo Jom
Quej agrees: ''I believe the only way to fight the land problem is to do
so lawfully. I'm against these violent, aggressive measures because it
is certain that this violence will bring more violence.''
The 1980s are simply remembered as la violencia. As a result of the
recent protests la violencia has come back to haunt the people of
Guatemala in 1995. In the space of 48 hours recently, the tortured
bodies of 22 young men were discovered. The 18-year-old to 20-year-old
urban slum dwellers are widely thought to have been killed by members of
the security forces, marking a return to the horrors of the death squads
that plagued Guatemala in the 80s.
As the police, under the watchful eye of the United Nations, plan
appropriate action against the campesinos occupying the fincas, the
community outside the National Palace has been awarded some land. At no
small price. During their two-week protest a child died due to the
living conditions. For progress to be made in Guatemala, the inevitable
cost seems to be life.

<HEADLINE>Cleaning goes off the Richter scale Sensitive time for Earthquake House</HEADLINE>

WHEN Perthshire pensioner Elizabeth Hanmer hauls out her vacuum
cleaner, scientists at the British Geological Survey's headquarters in
Edinburgh know all about it.
As custodian of Earthquake House in the The Ross, the tiny village at
Comrie in Perthshire, she supervises some of Scotland's most
sophisticated earth-tremor equipment.
Her job is to ensure the recording gear keeps ticking over, 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year, with one exception -- when the place needs a quick
spring clean.
Then the plug is pulled and history waits while Ms Hamner has a quick
scoot round with the vacuum, praying the earth does not literally move
from under her feet.
The seismometer inside is so sensitive that even a sneeze could set it
off. A quick blast from the cleaner would give the kind of Richter-scale
reading experts expect when the ''big one'' goes off on the San Andreas
fault.
On one occasion, a reading seemed to indicate that a major 'quake had
taken place, only to discover later that a stray sheep had managed to
get through the door.
Japan's tragic Kobe quake registered in Comrie and readings of tremors
in Central Peru and the Middle East are churned out regularly from the
house on the hill.
Nine feet square, sitting on a grassy outcrop of rock, the tiny grey
cottage became an official listed building in 1977.
This fascinating and almost unknown treasure also boasts the title of
Scotland's smallest building with a pyramid roof.
Yet in a manner unfitting of its status, a herd of cows chew grass on
its doorstep and a bull scares off the few visitors who consider risking
the short-cut to its not particularly well-trodden path.
Tourists visit, but hardly in droves. The historic fixture is one of
three landmarks in the village, rating third in popularity behind the
200-year-old Ross bridge and the village church.
''People here regard Earthquake House as part of their tradition but
rarely take a look themselves,'' said Dr William MacIndoe, 65.
Yet Comrie could be regarded as the nerve centre of Scotland's quake
community.
Nicknamed the ''Shaky Toun'', the village lies close to the Great
Highland Boundary Fault running from Stonehaven to Helensburgh and has
experienced it's fair share of chipped crockery, cracked walls, and
shattered slates in the past.
Former local postmaster Peter Macfarlane chronicled the tale of the
Great Comrie Quake on October 23, 1839, when 20 shocks within 24 hours
caused stricken villagers to flee their homes and assemble for prayers
in a local hall.
Mr Macfarlane teamed up with shoemaker James Drummond and the pair --
known as the Comrie Pioneers -- sparked local and national interest in
earth tremors.
In 1840, a 10ft 3in high inverted pendulum seismometer, invented by an
Edinburgh professor, took pride of place in the steeple of Comrie Parish
Church.
Twenty-nine years later, Earthquake House was built. It provided a
shelter for the Mallet -- a wooden cross then considered the latest
thing in quake technology.
Small cylinders placed on the four arms of the cross, and their
position when they fell off following a tremor, were used to register
depth and direction of ground movement.
Local historian Jack Elliot, 79, is not convinced of the Mallet's
reliability.
He said: ''Those checking Earthquake House once found all the
cylinders knocked off the cross. They were amazed, because no-one had
felt any tremors.
The whole village was dumbfounded until days later the culprits were
identified -- yes, the sheep again.
Over the years, interest in the house waned. Dampness spread and
rotted away the stones. Then in 1988, Perth and Kinross District Council
decided on a long-awaited face-lift, the British Geological Survey
fitted it out, and once again it regained its status as a seismological
observatory.
No-one, with the exception of Ms Hamner, a handful of geologists, and
a few local dignitaries, are permitted past the threshold.
Yet Ms Hamner, 72, recalled how, 60 years ago, she and her friends hid
in the house for a quick puff on a cigarette away from the prying eyes
of parents.
''It was just a run down little building with a dusty floor then,''
she said. ''I don't think there was even a window. We just thought of it
as a den.''
Every fifth day, Ms Hamner rises at 7am and walks the 15 minutes up
the hill -- she can see the house from the sitting room of her cottage
-- to change the print-outs for posting to Edinburgh.
''I try to do it within a minute, in case there's an earthquake right
there and then. A while ago, I asked if I could switch it off to vacuum
because the walls were starting to crumble. They said that was fine.''
Ms Hamner volunteered for the job seven years ago after a neighbour
called off.
''You have to climb a wee ladder to reach the print-out and he had a
heart condition, so I offered to do it.
''I don't really think about it now. It's just a case of changing the
paper and checking the time.''
Despite the routine, she -- like everyone who visits -- is still
fascinated by the place: ''You never know what you're going to find when
you get up there. It registered all three recent Japanese earthquakes.
The Kobe one didn't come through strongly, though, because of its
distance.''
''The biggest recording was for Comrie around five years ago. It
jumped right off the chart. I was sitting on my chair watching TV around
midnight when I heard an explosion almost like a bomb. There wasn't much
damage, a few dishes rattling, that sort of thing.
''There was a bad one 30 years ago, though. I remember rumbling under
my feet as I walked to my gate. That was horrible, it made me feel
dizzy.''
However, for as long as she can get up the ladder, Ms Hamner promises
tohang on to her part-time job.

AS a mark of respect Billy Webb made a point of turning up at the
funeral in Glasgow of Arthur Thompson, Scotland's most notorious
gangster. On the other hand, because he held him in no regard
whatsoever, it never even crossed his mind that he should attend the
over-the-top funeral of Ronnie Kray through the East End of London the
other week. Nor was he prepared to join in the crocodile tears being
shed on that occasion by other former enemies of the gangland twin.
The tramlines slashed on Billy Webb's face many years ago warn that
here is a man not to be meddled with. He is a villain who will hold a
grudge and seek retribution when crossed.
In conversation he mentioned the name of a man -- who a few years ago
gained world-wide notoriety -- but who recently had done him out of some
money. ''He'll live to regret that,'' he promised.
''Death was kind to Ronnie Kray. He deserved a lot more than he got,''
Billy Webb declares with more than a degree of vehemence. Others might
have been prepared to forgive and forget, but not Webb. ''He got off
lightly. It is said that Ronnie screamed out for his mother just before
he died, but compared with what he inflicted on others he suffered no
pain.''
While lily-livered liberals, such as myself, are concerned about the
recent reawakening of the capital punishment debate in the UK, Webb has
no qualms.
''It is a pity they abolished the death penalty. This would have been
right and just punishment in the case of the Krays and would have saved
a lot of heartache and misery to many people who sat and watched the
glamorisation of the twins in recent years.''
Now that Ronnie is dead, he thinks it is possible that when Reggie is
eventually released he will abandon a scheme the twins had developed to
set up a new club to be called the Sweeney Todd. ''It was a twisted
notion. They even intended to have sawdust on the floor splattered with
red ink simulating blood.''
While clearly Webb disliked Ronnie most, it is just as obvious he does
not hold Reggie in high regard. From his prison cell, Reggie had been
writing romantic letters to Webb's daughter. ''She's well away out of
London,'' said Webb. ''She will be safe from him when he gets out.''
In his youth, Webb was very much in the same business as the Kray
twins. He and his older brother Ron ran illegal gambling clubs,
protection rackets, and he offered his hard-man services to those too
squeamish of blood to defend themselves. He was an enforcer for Rachman,
the notorious slum landlord of the sixties. Webb was into any scam that
would make money. He offered muscle and, if necessary, backed it up with
what he calls ''lethal weapons''.
Now aged 61, Webb still likes to be seen driving flash cars -- in his
youth it was a distinctive Cadillac Coup de Ville, today it is a Porche
with a personalised number plate from Ireland.
He also makes it clear that he is still involved with an illegal
gambling den in London. However, nowadays his main source of income is
from a scam he operates in the Far East.
''I won't tell you the name of the country,'' he said, ''because they
would almost certainly get their hands on a copy of The Herald and try
to put a stop to it.
''But in this Far Eastern country they have banned betting, except,
that is, when there has been a death in the family. In these
circumstances the authorities allow gambling at the wake.
''What we do is go along to that country and borrow a body for up to a
couple of weeks. We move it from house to house and from town to town.
It enables me and my friends, not from this country, to set up a
lucrative operation.
''We are talking big money here. The Chinese live to gamble and we
give them the opportunity.
''Nobody loses. The family of the deceased get enough money to provide
for a decent funeral -- something they could not otherwise afford -- and
the people whose houses we use get whatever share of the take we have
agreed upon.
''We play it straight!
''Once other expenses have been paid, such as a backhander to the
local cops, we are left with a tidy sum and it's almost legal.''
Webb says he spends several months of the year out of Britain running
the scam.
In his time he has known all the villains. He was friendly with George
Cornell and Jack ''The Hat'' McVitie, both murdered by one or other of
the Kray twins. He talks about ''Mad'' Frankie Fraser, enforcer for the
Richardson gang south of the river, with a degree of affection, and
speaks highly of Arthur Thompson.
''I liked Arthur very much,'' he says. After a pause he adds: ''I have
to be careful what I say to you. I don't want to upset the new 'Man' up
there. I will be going to Glasgow shortly.''
All in all, unless crossed, Webb seems to have got on reasonably well
with all the infamous names of the fifties and sixties underworld --
except of course the Krays.
And that may seem strange as their paths kept crossing most of their
adult lives -- ever since Webb and Ronnie Kray shared safe houses
together when each had gone Awol during National Service -- and when it
is considered Webb frequently visited both Reggie in prison and Ronnie
in Broadmoor.
For most of the time it was live and let live, but there were
occasions when tolerance came close to a face-to-face confrontation.
It was in the Old Horns public house in London's Bethnal Green, deep
in the Krays's manor, that violence finally erupted. According to his
version, Billy and Ron Webb were set upon by the twins and their
henchmen. Outnumbered 20 to one both the Webbs were badly beaten up.
According to Billy Webb his brother never really recovered and he
attributes Ron's early death to the battle at the Old Horns.
When his brother died, and an anguished Billy Webb visited Ronnie Kray
in Broadmoor, he walked straight up to the gangland killer and set about
him. ''I managed to get a few punches in before the screws pulled me off
him,'' he recalled. ''It was the first time I had come across grief,''
he said.
''It was not just Ronnie Kray. I was having a go at anybody who had
bad-mouthed my brother. The police came to my gaff and told me to cool
it.''
Although they were in the same business as the Krays, Webb said: ''We
were never like them. Anything my brother and I did, we did it for
money. Ronnie Kray would cut people up for little or no reason.
''I have never killed anyone . . . at least not as far as I know.
''Yes I was delighted when they were finally sent down. I told the
police about the Old Horns battle.
''I certainly was not unhappy when I heard Ronnie had finally died.''
The paperback edition of Billy Webb's book, Running with the Krays, is
published by Mainstream Publishing, priced #6.99.

Exclusive
AN early-day motion condemning the ''corporate greed'' of Rolls-Royce
board members at a time when staff are fighting to save their jobs at
East Kilbride will be lodged tomorrow in the House of Commons.
It has been drafted by East Kilbride MP Adam Ingram, outraged by the
''insensitivity of management'' in taking large salary increases as one
of Scotland's best-regarded research and design facilities faces
closure.
He predicted strong support from Scottish colleagues, plus English MPs
whose constituencies include Rolls-Royce plants.
The motion is timed to coincide with the start of a rolling programme
of industrial action by the 600 East Kilbride staff in protest at the
closure and the transfer of work to Derby and Bristol.
It asks the House to view the announcement that Rolls-Royce board
members have received 27% pay increases ''as a further example of
corporate greed''.
It also declares that such an award is illjudged and unjustified
because the salary increases follow a programme of plant closures and
contractions throughout the company's UK operations -- resulting in
''the loss of thousands of highly-skilled engineering jobs when below
inflation pay increases are being imposed on Rolls-Royce employees.''
Mr Ingram's motion calls on the board to exercise restraint in
remuneration awards given to the board members. It also urges the
company to reverse its ''damaging plant-closure programme,'' particulary
the decision to close the East Kilbride aero-design centre.
The motion concludes that the Lanarkshire closure will significantly
undermine the research and development base of aero-engine design within
the UK aerospace sector.
It was revealed last week that the 13-member Rolls-Royce board, in
addition to increases of 27% overall, has also agreed increases in
performance related bonuses from #58,000 to #324,000.
Last year, profits rose by 33% to #101m before tax -- boosted by plant
closures and a fall in research and development spending. The workforce
has fallen by 20% since 1993 under ongoing restructuring.
Mr Ingram said yesterday that his motion will underline the deep
feeling of outrage throughout Scotland at the Rolls-Royce board's
''excesses at a time when restraint is being imposed on the workforce''.
He believed the East Kilbride plant can be saved because of increasing
pressure on the company, which has already backed down in a wages
dispute with employees in England. The company has also been told other
plants will refuse work sent south as industrial action at East Kilbride
hits tight schedules on contracts.
An overtime ban comes into effect at midnight tomorrow, followed by a
36-hour strike from noon on Wednesday, and a two-day stoppage next week.
Union officials will lobby delegates tomorrow at the annual STUC
conference, which is expected to raise implications arising from the
East Kilbride closure during an emergency debate on the Scottish
economy.
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions, said yesterday:
''The timing of Mr Ingram's statement is significant and important to
us. It provides a major boost to the campaign to save the plant.''
He urged support for the early-day motion from all sides of the House,
''at a time when the Government appears more concerned about its own
fate than that of one of Britain's prime industries''.
Mr Thomas added that the MP's concise and welcome summary of issues
should also send a clear signal to Rolls-Royce shareholders at next
month's AGM.
He said: ''They should be careful in giving licence to the board over
future proposals for the company. So far its decisions have proved a
disaster for staff and for the aerospace industry.''
The AGM will discuss plans to continue donations to the Conservative
Party amounting to more than #100,000 over the next three years.

EVEN Great Achilles had a heel. Margaret Thatcher has her son Mark.
Mother love is an admirable thing, and Lady Thatcher's devotion to her
son is there for all to see. It should not be mocked, and if she is
showing her years and looking strained today it is no wonder. He is in
deep trouble. And so, by implication, is she. He may emerge safely, but
there are things to be explained, problems to be resolved.
The doings of ''the Boy Mark'', which is what his father calls him,
have always been there in the background of her career as Prime
Minister. For a man allegedly not over blessed with brains -- he was
known as ''Thickie Mork'' at Harrow, and thick was the general view of
her political colleagues -- he has done astonishingly well in business,
without it ever being clear just what sort of business ventures he is
engaged in. Sir Denis, of course, was no mean businessman, but his was a
solid career with Castrol and Burmah Oil. It has never been a case of
like father, like son. Sir Denis is a gentleman. The son would make
Essex man seem like Renaissance man.
There are people it is hard to like, and he is one of them. Maybe he
does not want to be liked. He certainly goes out of his way to ensure he
is disliked, an odd trait in one who has apparently made his fortune
from being a fixer. He accompanied his mother to Dubai three years ago
-- she was there to open a trade fair and both were intent on raising a
few bawbees for the Thatcher Foundation -- and while she was on her best
behaviour, if clearly tired, he behaved disgracefully. She toured the
trade show stands, chatting to exhibitors, pursued by a gaggle of
television cameramen, although by no means a mob. The Son ordered them
around, told the security men to prevent them reaching suitable
positions to film from, demanding they should ''Get those . . . out of
here -- now'', and was so rude to the organisers about the arrangements
he was demolishing that he reduced one woman to tears.
But nobody was causing real trouble, let alone getting in Mummy's way.
She was doing her job, which was to give the representatives from the
firms who had come all that way, spent all that money in the hope of
getting orders from the Arabs, the added boost of having met a world
figure and of getting her autograph for their stand's visitors' book.
Things went wrong because of his behaviour, and a sour taste was left
behind as he strutted round twirling his worry beads -- sometimes his
comfort bunny in such situations is a portable phone which he plays with
but never uses -- and generally behaving like some FBI goon guarding an
American President. Meanwhile, Lady Thatcher's detectives, who have been
with her since the Downing Street days, grew ever more tight-lipped.
There is no love lost between them and the Son, and it showed.
While Mummy -- it is what he calls her all the time -- was doing her
best for Britain, the Son was doing his worst. His mother becoming Prime
Minister was the making of Mark. The irony will be if he turns out to be
her undoing. Sir Denis, according to a friend who met him recently for
lunch, is at his wits' end about the Boy.
Right from the start Mark, unlike his twin sister Carol, ruthlessly
exploited the Thatcher name. 10 Downing Street became his address too.
Geoffrey Howe, when Foreign Secretary, passed through Fiji on a trip and
there in the visitors' book at the airport was Mark Thatcher's
signature, with in the address column -- 10 Downing Street SW1.
He currently faces a #14m civil lawsuit in Texas in which he is
charged with fraud, money laundering, and usury, the United States
Internal Revenue Service is after him over his business dealings, and
fresh allegations about his exploiting his mother's name to further arms
and building deals with Gulf states have surfaced. These last are not in
themselves completely new. The new book, Thatcher's Gold, which recounts
them, does, however, add some interesting detail.
One is the fact that he appears to have used a handwritten note from
Mummy for business purposes. The note, under an official photograph, was
allegedly given to him in 1980 to present to the Sheik Zayed, ruler of
Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates. The message was:
''I have asked my son to convey to you my personal message of warm
regards and good wishes.'' A nice gesture, perhaps, but it was also a
gilt-edged calling card which would open doors otherwise securely
bolted. At issue was a #300m building contract for Cementation
International to build a new university and hospital in Oman. It is
alleged his commission was #3m.
When Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979 Mark was 24. His
career since leaving school at 18 had been somewhat lacklustre, and he
had drifted from job to job. He was a trainee accountant with Touche
Ross, where three times he failed his accountancy exams, and in 1979 was
a jewellery salesman with the firm of L J Lepp, friends of the family.
He is said to have demanded a 100% rise in salary from the firm as a
result, although he did not get it. His excuse -- anybody would have
done the same if it was their Mum. He had some ambitions to become a
racing driver, although he displayed little talent to be one, and, while
playing the smart young chap about town, was going nowhere in
particular.
But suddenly the son also rose. Being the Prime Minister's son meant
he could get sponsorship, and in no time he appeared to be festooned
with all sorts of labels. He embarked on a career as a racing driver,
but he crashed at le Mans in 1980, again in 1981, and then famously got
lost for six days on the Paris-to-Dakar rally in 1982. Mummy wept, Sir
Denis headed for Tamanrasset, and the Boy Mark was found safe and well,
but neither repentant about the trouble caused, nor grateful for the
efforts made to find him. ''We knew where we were, although we weren't
where we were meant to be,'' he said.
He then went briefly to Hong Kong and, five months after she entered
No 10, set up Monteagle Marketing Company, a so-called international
consultancy to promote whisky, clothing, and Japanese textiles. A row
erupted when he was discovered in Tokyo modelling Japanese clothes while
she was urging people to buy British. He also caused a furore by
refusing to be photographed on one trip unless the Japan Airlines logo
was in frame. ''They've given me a good deal -- no airline bag, no
pictures,'' he said, proof of a certain lack of acumen. It is one thing
to try to prevent a snapper from taking a picture, quite another to give
him a story to go with it.
There was, however, nothing out of the way about all of those business
ventures. He was making money, but hardly a fortune, and Monteagle was
consistently late in filing its annual returns and only just avoided
prosecution. It was not until 1984 that he started to become a serious
embarrassment to Mummy. This followed reports of the #3m commission for
his part in helping Cementation win the Oman contract. It was awarded to
the British firm after a visit by the Prime Minister to Oman, and during
Commons questions it emerged that her son had been employed as a
consultant. It was the first of many dodgy-seeming business
associations.
Over the past decade his wheeler-and-dealer career has been the
subject of constant newspaper investigations. Nothing illegal is ever
proved, but they all reek of the shady, and she has denied in the
Commons that he benefited from his association with her.
Mark left for America to get away from the Cementation row, announcing
he would be keeping a low profile from now on. Mummy thought he had been
hounded out by the press. His idea of a low profile proved to be a
high-performance red sports car and a rackety lifestyle which drove Our
Men In Washington crazy since at the time -- the IRA was a threat -- he
had to be guarded. In Texas he   worked for the Lotus car company as a
salesman, earning #45,000 a year, set up another firm, the Grantham
Company, the vehicle for whatever it was he was up to, and set about
wooing his future bride -- Diane Berghof. The Grantham Company
ostensibly dealt with the electronics, leasing, and communications
industry, which could be pretty well anything. He is also said to have
made a lot of money out of manufacturing mobile telephones at this time.
In the next nine years he was to become a millionaire, a man who
travelled with his own butler and had a tax-haven home in Switzerland,
and could be found in the company of some very high-powered Middle
Eastern businessmen, notably Wafic Said, a Syrian with close links to
Saudi royalty. Mark was somewhere on the fringes of the #20bn deal with
the Saudis involving British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce, known as Al
Yamamah II, signed in 1993. Al Yamamah I, worth #12m, was signed in
1986, and Mrs Thatcher's personal contacts with the Saudi royal family
certainly played their part in Britain securing the deal to sell the
Saudis Tornado fighters, helicopters, and aircraft trainers. Wafic Said
was British Aerospace's principal agent, and the row here focused on
Labour claims that Mark had received #12m for acting as the middleman.
From the Saudi point of view family is all and there would have been
nothing strange to them in Mark Thatcher being involved as a fixer in
any deal. It does seem that arms dealing is where the cash has come from
which has allowed him to amass a fortune, and he is also alleged to have
been one of those behind a plan, conceived in 1990 while she was still
in office, to make Lady Thatcher president of the ill-fated Bank of
Credit and Commerce International. It came to nothing when Sheikh Zayed
refused to co-operate.
Last year his name surfaced yet again in connection with a dodgy
international contract -- the Pergau dam affair in which British aid
played a vital part in Britain securing the #1300m contract. No
wrongdoing has ever been proved, but there is no doubt that he moves in
a distinctly shady world, one where rules get bent and the use of
influence is all.
He tends to the crass, a talent he displayed when he handled the sale
and promotion of her memoirs. He was described as ''a total twit'' for
the way he mishandled the book by those who do such deals, while his
descent on Hong Kong, announcing that ''it was time to pay up for
Mumsie'', in search of donations from businessmen for the Thatcher
Foundation, won him no friends.
His twin sister Carol, who is cheese to his chalk, is said once to
have asked her mother why everything Mark did was all right. She had
feelings too. ''Because, darling, you and I are the strong ones,'' Mummy
replied. She always believed that anybody who criticised him was
attacking her, and even while running the country mothered him, packed
his luggage, and ironed his shirts. He was known as her blind spot, so
serious a mote that Bernard Ingham, when Mark asked how he could help
his mother in the 1987 election, replied -- ''Leave the country''.
His marriage -- he and Diane have two children -- has been under
strain, although the divorce expected last year has not yet arrived.
Mark Thatcher may be as innocent as the driven snow, just an
old-fashioned millionaire who made his money the hard way. But
old-fashioned millionaires tend to have had a brainwave, to have
invented cornflakes, baked beans, Mars bars or chocolate flakes. Where
their money came from is clear. Where Mark's came from is obscure.
At 41 things are not going well for the boy who could do no wrong --
if only in his mother's eyes. These are interesting times for Mark. They
are also interesting times for Mummy.

<HEADLINE>Report urges lower age for buying alcohol</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978845875</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government should ''cautiously investigate'' the possibility of
reducing the age at which people can buy alcohol in pubs, according to a
report published today.
The report by the Social Affairs Unit, the independent research and
educational trust, reopens the debate on whether Britain has the right
attitude to alcohol.
Its author, Dr Digby Anderson, believes Government policy should be
based neither on encouraging nor discouraging consumption but on
research.
He discredits arguments that alcohol consumption is bad for health,
quoting several reports that moderate consumption helps prevent heart
disease, for example.
He said: ''Certainly the Government should cease promoting its current
recommendations on consumption . . . for, in the light of the research,
these look silly; and they risk making the Department of Health, which
obstinately promote them, look even sillier.''
The limits recommended are 14 units a week for women and 21 for men --
one unit is the equivalent of half a pint of beer.
Dr Anderson's most controversial idea is a reduction in the age at
which young people can drink alcohol legally.
''First, it seems that those cultures which encourage young people to
drink and to drink responsibly, have more success than those which try
to keep young people away from alcohol as long as possible, such as the
United States,'' he said.
''Secondly, the lowering of other ages of consent is leaving the
drinking age out on a limb. If young people can be prescribed
contraceptives, get married, or go to prison under the age of 18, why
may they not drink half a pint of beer in a pub?''
He added that the home is the place where children can best be
introduced to alcohol.
''It may be illegal for someone to buy alcohol under the age of 18,
but it is not illegal to give a teenager a drink at home. Letting them
share a drink at Sunday lunch is the best way of preventing alcohol
becoming a forbidden fruit -- particularly as it is so accessible when
parents are out of the house,'' said Dr Anderson.
The report also concluded that excise duty should be reduced to
harmonise with EU countries and prevent the ''ludicrous'' cross-Channel
trafficking.

ATTENDANCE figures at this year's Edinburgh International Science
Festival -- shorter and smaller this year because of budget cuts -- are
expected to be down on last year's figure by nearly 15%.
Acting festival director Simon Gage estimated that more than 200,000
people would still have visited the festival, which ends tomorrow, but
said this would be between 10% and 15% less than the numbers for 1994.
''Overall, it's gone very well. We've spent less money and had fewer
events, so it is not surprising that the total number of people coming
is slightly less than in previous years,'' he said.
Work is already under way on the 1996 festival.
Mr Gage said he hoped the new science centre -- next to the City Arts
Centre in Market Street, Edinburgh -- would be open in time.
''We are running out of space. At the moment, we can't get enough good
exhibition space in the right parts of town for many of our displays,''
he said.
The festival team is now preparing to raise the #300,000 needed for
next year's event.

Martinez, California, Sunday
A MAN whose penis was amputated is seeking $800,000 (#533,000) in
compensation, claiming mistakes at a hospital led to the operation.
Jesse Sandoval, a diabetic, accuses Contra Costa County, California,
of negligence.
Sandoval went to Merrithew Memorial Hospital on October 27 for a sore
on his penis, according to a claim filed with the county, east of San
Francisco. The next day, surgeons operated to relieve tightness on the
skin.
He returned to the hospital on November 3 and surgeons amputated his
penis some time after that.
The amputation could have been avoided if doctors had given Sandoval
antibiotics and a circumcision when he first went for help, according to
the claim.
Sandoval is seeking compensation for the loss of his penis and the its
effect on his marriage. Hospital officials have refused to comment on
the case.
The county is reviewing the claim, but has not determined whether
doctors erred, said Deputy County Counsel Gregory Harvey.
He added that he probably would recommend that county supervisors
reject the claim when they review it on May 9, noting that Sandoval's
diabetes could have caused circulatory problems.--AP.

Vatican City, Sunday
THE Pope, in his Easter message, told Palestinians and Kurds that only
dialogue could help them reach their goals. He also comforted people
torn apart by violence in Algeria, Bosnia, and Burundi.
In his Urbi et Orbi message to the city and the world, the Pope said
that the Roman Catholic Church wanted everyone to work ''with
perseverance and courage so that our time, marked by all too many songs
of death, may at last witness the establishment of a new culture of
life''.
Recalling the hopes of ethnic groups seeking autonomy, he said: ''To
those who await, in suffering, the recognition of their deepest
aspirations, such as Palestinians, the Kurds, or among others, the
native peoples of Latin America, the Church proposes dialogue as the
only path able to promote just and fair solutions.''
The Vatican, which established relations with Israel last year,
supports a Palestinian homeland but has condemned attacks by Islamist
guerrilla groups that have killed scores of Israelis.
The Pope's words marked one of the few times he has publically
mentioned the Kurds, scattered around countries like Turkey and Iraq.
He also comforted those suffering in former Yugoslavia and Africa.
''To families torn apart by war, to the victims of hatred and
violence, as in Algeria, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Burundi and southern
Sudan, the Church does not hesitate to renew the Easter message of
peace,'' he said.
After his message, the Pope wished the world a happy Easter in 57
languages, watched by more than 80,000 people in St Peter's Square in
Italy's wettest and coldest Easter for 25 years.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Harbour head takes Government to task.  Marine safety policy attacked</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978845882</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE head of the Sullom Voe tanker harbour in Shetland has made a
scathing attack on Government shipping policies, saying its response to
the Donaldson inquiry into safety was ''very disappointing''.
Captain George Sutherland, director of marine operations for Shetland
Islands Council, says the Government's response to Lord Donaldson's
inquiry is ''largely symbolic and ineffective'', gives too much weight
to the views of shipowners, and does not provide the Marine Safety
Agency and other public bodies with the staff and cash to do their job
properly.
Captain Sutherland, who has run the port at Europe's largest oil and
gas export terminal for the past decade, lists dozens of detailed
criticisms in a 17-page report for tomorrow's meeting of the council's
marine operations committee.
He says the Government gives no dates for putting into effect its
assurances of action; has ''a general tendency . . . to lean towards no
disturbance of the status quo''; has ''chosen to ignore completely the
views expressed by the council'' in its own lengthy submission to Lord
Donaldson's inquiry; and has ''largely ignored'' the views of seafarers'
unions.
''The influence of the shipping industry is seen in the Government's
attitude,'' he says.
While welcoming the Government's publication of lists of ships
detained for safety infringements, Captain Sutherland says it is
''extremely disturbing'' that the work of the Marine Safety Agency (MSA)
is increasingly being delegated to the private sector -- particularly
ship inspection and classification societies: ''As the detention lists
published by the MSA show that most of the major classification
societies are responsible for the detained vessels, this does not
inspire any confidence . . .''
Instead, the MSA should be ''strengthened, adequately resourced, and
staffed with seasoned professionals'' to do their work ''properly,
impartially, and vigorously to the highest standards''.
The catalogue of charges states:
* The Government fails to recognise that international agreement on
scrapping substandard tankers ''may assist in improving operating
standards''.
* Ships carrying dangerous or polluting cargoes should be forced to
report to the coastguards when passing through UK waters - the
Government sees 'little justification'' for this.
* Permanent radar coverage for environmentally-sensitive areas is
rejected and the Government has not shown the Shetland council the
results of a recent radar survey of the Fair Isle Channel.
* Although two salvage tugs have been stationed elsewhere on the
British coast since the Braer tanker wreck in January 1993, neither is
near Shetland.
* The Government's response to the problem of uninsured ''klondiker''
ships, several of which have been lost on the Shetland coast in the past
two years, is ''wholly unsatisfactory and extremely disappointing''.
* Klondikers should be required by British law to carry insurance to
cover pollution liabilities -- there is no need to wait for
international action through the ''pedestrian timetable'' of the
International Maritime Organisation.
Captain Sutherland urges councillors to continue to press for urgent
and effective measures to improve shipping safety around the coast of
Shetland and the rest of the UK.

From HOWARD GOLLER Jerusalem, Sunday
ISRAELI security forces killed three guerrillas from the Muslim
militant Hamas movement in a gunbattle today in the West Bank town of
Hebron.
''The three terrorists were responsible for a large number of shooting
attacks in which six Israeli civilians were killed and 12 wounded,'' a
military statement said.
It said the Palestinians were killed in an exchange of fire during an
operation by Israel's Shin Bet secret police, paramilitary border
police, and the army. No Israelis were hurt.
Major-General Ilan Biran, chief of the army's central district, said:
''Two of the Hamas terrorists have been wanted for a long time. There is
still a lot to do. There are additional terrorist squads which must be
pursued relentlessly and eliminated.''
Witnesses said the Hamas militants, all from Hebron, were shot while
riding in a car in the occupied West Bank.
''Preliminary findings at the scene show the terrorists were on their
way to carry out an attack,'' the army said, adding that weapons,
ammunition, and Israeli army uniforms were found in the vehicle.
Biran, in an interview with Army Radio, declined to say who shot
first.
While Israel battled Hamas on the ground, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority fought the guerrillas in court, jailing Hamas activists for
the first time.
Hamas and the Islamic Jihad group have been challenging the 19-month
Israeli-PLO peace deal with attacks on Israelis, the latest a week ago
when suicide bombers killed eight Jews in the Gaza Strip.
Members of the PLO and Hamas from Gaza agreed to a truce on Friday but
Arafat refused to accept it without a Hamas commitment to stop attacks
on Israelis from the Palestinian self-rule areas, Gaza and Jericho.
At Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, traditional site of
Jesus's tomb, Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah told worshippers at an
Easter mass that even the most extreme Arabs and Jews had to learn to
share the Holy Land.
''We say that all of us are brothers and sisters: Palestinians,
Israelis, Jews, Christians, and Muslims, Hamas and Jewish extremists,
all, we are brothers and sisters,'' he said.
After today's gunbattle, the army reimposed a round-the-clock curfew
on the Hebron area after easing it yesterday. Israeli forces have been
on high alert against guerrilla attacks since the start of the Passover
holiday week on Friday.
Hebron, scene of a mosque massacre last year in which a Jewish settler
killed 29 Arabs, has long been a flashpoint of violence. Last month,
Palestinian gunmen ambushed an Israeli bus in the town, killing two
Jewish settlers.
In Gaza, a Palestinian military court jailed for two years Hamas
activists Mohammad Abu Shamala and Riad al-Atar. Israel Radio said they
were suspected of involvement in the killing of Israelis during the
Palestinian uprising that began in 1987.
In a leaflet, Hamas renewed its condemnation of what it called an
extension of ''Zionist military courts''. It urged the Palestinian
Authority to cancel the court rulings and free all Palestinian
prisoners.--Reuter.

Singapore, Sunday
A BRITON charged with murder involving a dismembered body, and
suspected of links to similar cases in three other countries, appears in
a Singapore court tomorrow.
Singapore's investigation of 35-year-old John Martin Scripps in the
grisly murder has spanned Britain, Mexico, Canada, Thailand, the United
States, and South Africa.
Scripps has been linked to four murder cases involving five victims,
starting in San Francisco last October.
Scripps has been charged in Singapore with murdering a South African
tourist last month. He is also a suspect in the murders of two Canadian
tourists, a mother and son, in the Thai island resort of Phuket earlier
in March.
Scripps had been jailed in London for drug possession and absconded
from Britain when he was released on parole in 1990.
He arrived in Singapore on March 8 from San Francisco and left for
Phuket, via Bangkok, on March 11, police said.
When he returned to Singapore on March 19, he was arrested by police
in connection with the disappearance of Gerard George Lowe, a
32-year-old South African who was on a shopping holiday.
The possible murder of Lowe first came to light when a black plastic
bag containing a pair of legs was fished out of Singapore waters,
followed three days later by another bag holding thighs and a naked
torso without head or limbs.
Forensic tests have been conducted to determine whether the body parts
were those of Lowe. A Singapore newspaper said blood samples of his
relatives would be flown from South Africa to see if they matched the
victim's blood.
Lowe's passport and credit card were recovered from Scripps. So were
articles belonging to the two Canadians, Darin Damude and his mother
Sheila, from British Columbia.
They were last seen alive in Bangkok on March 15. Their decomposed
bodies were found in Phuket and identified by dental records.
Singapore's High Court has assigned a lawyer to defend Scripps, who
has been under psychiatric observation in a Singapore prison hospital.
A police official said Scripps's court appearance tomorrow would be
his third.--Reuter.

Paris, Sunday
PRIME Minister Edouard Balladur, in a sign of growing French unease
over peacekeeping policy in Bosnia, has called a meeting of top
Ministers this week to evaluate its military mission there.
Defence Minister Francois Leotard, who visited Sarajevo after two
French UN soldiers were shot dead in as many days, and Foreign Minister
Alain Juppe will review the situation in Bosnia.
The two soldiers were both killed by snipers in the Sarajevo area
while carrying out non-military duties linked to civilian protection.
Their deaths came at a delicate time for Balladur, a week before the
first round of presidential elections in which he is running third.
Leotard, who consulted UN commanders about the safety of the 4200
French UN troops in Bosnia, spoke of ''indignation and rage'' at home at
the killings and raised the possibility that France would withdraw its
forces.
''At the moment when it seems diplomatic action is not advancing a
solution to the crisis, the question of withdrawal is of course going to
be posed,'' he said, adding that France would consult its European
partners on the matter.
Balladur has urged the United Nations to focus on whether its
peacekeeping mission should be maintained.
In another development, Senator Bob Dole, the leader of the US Senate,
said he would move soon to lift the US arms embargo against the Bosnian
Government. ''They are entitled to the right of self-defence,'' he said
in an interview.
In Bosnia itself, Serb military and civilian chiefs bickered over the
blame for the Muslim-led government army's recent successes. The
disputes at the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament are a sign that
outside pressure is telling on the defiant leadership.--Reuter.

Tunceli, Sunday
BOUT 25,000 Turkish troops, backed by assault helicopters, moved in on
a Kurdish rebel stronghold in a rugged eastern province today.
Explosions from rockets fired by Super Cobra helicopters at Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK) positions in the remote Alibogazi ravine, in
Tunceli province, could be heard six miles away.
''The PKK in the area will be taken dead or alive soon,'' said a
military official.
More than 10,000 troops in lorries and buses began fanning out towards
Alibogazi, a 20-mile gash in the mountains which cuts through Hozat and
Cemisgezek districts.
The army began a big push against the separatist rebels in Tunceli
last month in parallel with its huge cross-border drive against PKK
fighters into north Iraq.
Tunceli is known to Kurds as part of the Dersim region, which gave its
name to a bloody 1936-38 uprising led by Kurdish Muslims.--Reuter.

Moscow, Sunday
RUSSIAN forces kept up heavy shelling of the Chechen town of Bamut
today but did not attempt to storm the last rebel bastion in the
region's lowlands, news agencies reported.
Russian forces fighting to end Chechnya's separatist drive shelled
Bamut for most of the day.
Russian troops tried to seize Bamut on Friday but the rebels hid among
the nuclear-proof bunkers at the base to beat off the attack and killed
several soldiers.
If Bamut is captured, the rebels will be reduced to fighting a
guerrilla war from bases in the Chechen mountains.
Meanwhile, in a statement likely to sour ties with the West even
further, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said Moscow could not stick to
the terms of the cornerstone 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe treaty
until the four-month Chechen war was over as Russia wanted to send in
more troops.--Reuter.

EURO-REBEL Tory MPs plan to fight any attempt to introduce compulsory
identity cards.
They fear that the Government wants the ID cards as a ''fallback
position'' if it is forced by the EU to drop its border controls.
A paper outlining plans to oppose the scheme is to be discussed by
eight rebels in private on Tuesday. It is already understood to have the
backing of at least four of the group.
''We regard it as a costly and bureaucratic exercise which could only
be justified as a kind of fallback position in place of passport
controls,'' said rebel MP Sir Teddy Taylor.
The MPs want the Government to concentrate instead on getting the
declaration which allows Britain to retain its passport controls
strengthened at the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference.
They say that unless it is given the status of a treaty commitment,
the declaration, obtained by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1985, will always
be vulnerable to challenge.
''If you don't have your own passport controls, you don't have your
own country,'' Sir Teddy said.
Ministers are expected to issue a Green Paper outlining proposals for
ID cards within the next few weeks.

A RUSTING Russian factory ship will slip out of the Cromarty Firth
today on her long journey home . . . floating proof that the black
economy of the former communist state is on the up and up.
The decks of the Skazochnik Andersen are covered in cars and vans,
haggled for and bought in ports throughout Europe during the past seven
months.
They are worth a fortune to the crew when they reach their home port
of Murmansk.
It has been quite common for a number of years for Russian fishermen
to buy up old Ladas and ship them home, mainly for spare parts, which
were almost impossible to get in the old Soviet Union.
However, times have changed and alongside the Ladas on the fore, aft,
and upper decks of the Skazochnik Andersen are names including Pontiac,
Ford, Lincoln, Subaru, Opel, Peugeot, and Volkswagen.
Vans, cars, and four-wheel-drive off-roaders with right and left-hand
drive, 32 in all and some only a couple of years old, pack almost every
available space.
One of the ship's officers, Alexi Andropov, is proud of his buys and
quite open about the ''plenty dollar'' he will make when his ship sails
through the Barents Sea to Murmansk which, with a population of almost
500,000, is the world's largest town north of the Arctic Circle.
The mighty American dollar is the only currency in which Alexi is
interested. Pointing to one elderly Ford van, he said: ''I buy for
$1000. I sell for $5000, maybe more.''
The ship has spent the last couple of weeks tied up at Invergordon,
Easter Ross, for generator repairs but only a couple of cars have been
bought locally.
Alexi says: ''Scottish men ask too much.''
The crew spend most of their spare time under the bonnets of their
buys making sure they are in good order for the line of eager buyers
that will meet the ship in Murmansk.
A few of the really old cars have been stripped to the shell for spare
parts and the dilapidated bodywork, even rustier than the ship, will be
consigned to the deep when they sail into open water.
The ship will call at Ireland and Holland to pick up fish before
heading home.
Alexi said: ''Maybe we have room for few more cars. Who knows.''

MILITANT teachers who mobbed Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett
could face expulsion from their union, officials said yesterday.
Leaders of the National Union of Teachers also suggested that they
could face discipline at work for bringing their schools into disrepute.
Those associated with Saturday's scenes were unrepentant. Their action
followed recent comments by Mr Blunkett about the need to close schools
which were proving to be failures.
Mr Blunkett was pursued by shouting demonstrators and besieged for
more than 20 minutes in an office.
Mr John Bills, the NUT's president, opened yesterday's conference in
Blackpool by reinforcing the union's public apology to Mr Blunkett for
the behaviour of a ''minority'' of its membership.
He said that dozens of members had written to him expressing their
horror at ''chaotic and frightening scenes'' more reminiscent of
''fascists and the British National Party'' than a teachers' conference.
Later, general secretary Doug McAvoy said complaints were already
being registered by delegates about named individuals accused of
bringing the union into disrepute.
They would be investigated in a disciplinary process which could
result in expulsion.
Mr Eddie Parkinson, a history teacher at Kenton High School,
Newcastle, said: ''It was justified to shout at him. That's all that
happened. David Blunkett is a blind man but he is an important
politician and he has come out with extreme views about what should
happen to teachers that put him to the right of the Conservatives.''

SNOOKER player Jimmy White was facing further trauma last night with
the news he is to face an inquiry into match-fixing allegations.
Betting was suspended before the start on Saturday of White's first
round match in the Embassy World Championships against Peter Francisco
after large wagers had been placed on a 10-2 scoreline.
White, recently given the all-clear from cancer, is six times
runner-up in the tournament. He completed a 10-2 victory at the Crucible
in Sheffield yesterday and he and Francisco were later summoned to
attend a World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association hearing on
Wednesday.
A WPBSA statement said: ''We have been informed of unusual betting
patterns on the match played yesterday and today between Jimmy White and
Peter Francisco and accordingly will be holding an inquiry into the
circumstances.''
However, chairman John Spencer, who said he had watched every shot of
the match, stressed: ''This is an inquiry into the match, not into the
players.''
White was given the all-clear by doctors last week after fears he had
cancer.
A routine check-up had revealed a lump on one of his testicles and he
subsequently underwent surgery in a private clinic.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Football League is to investigate allegations
that a former player accepted a payment to lose a match.
The allegations, made in a Sunday newspaper, involve the performance
of Mr Derek Robertson, a former goalkeeper for St Johnstone, in a
Premier Division match against Ayr United 19 years ago.
Mr Robertson is quoted as admitting that he accepted a #2000 payment
in return for allowing Ayr United to win the match. They did, by two
goals to one.
The Scottish league secretary, Mr Peter Donald said: ''We have been
made aware of these allegations and will be considering our strategy
after evaluating whether or not they are true.''
When asked the range of sanctions the league could apply against a
former player if the allegations were found to be true, Mr Donald
refused to comment.
There will be no inquiry by the Scottish Football Association. SFA
chief executive Mr Jim Farry said he considered the matter to be outwith
the SFA's jurisdiction, as the game involved was a Scottish League
fixture, and added that any investigation was therefore the league's
responsibility.
A Tayside police spokesman said a formal complaint would have to be
received before an investigation could be instituted.
He confirmed that the fact the match took place 19 years ago would be
no bar to any police inquiry.

MARAUDING foxes and killer gulls are threatening to wipe out one of
Britain's largest duck colonies.
Conservationists now say they may be forced to shoot gulls which have
become specialists in robbing the nests of eider ducks.
''These are wild birds and we are talking about a very sensitive issue
indeed,'' said Scottish Natural Heritage officer Kenny Steele.
''We can select these specialist gulls, pick them off, and shoot them
-- but it is not something we would do lightly.''
Mr Steele warned that the 1500 pairs of eiders which breed at the
Ythan Estuary, Aberdeenshire, could die out if measures were not taken
to protect them.
The estuary is part of Forvie National Nature Reserve run by SNH, and
is home to the biggest breeding colony of eiders in the UK.
Mr Steele said numbers had reduced drastically after five disastrous
breeding seasons -- only one duckling survived last summer.
He said they had also been hit by an increasing fox population and by
people letting dogs off leads.
However, the biggest threat, he claimed, was from great black-backed
gulls, some of which had become specialist nest-robbers.
Mr Steele fears that the eider could eventually be driven from the
estuary, where SNH had already installed electric fences in a bid to
stop foxes and dogs disturbing the breeding grounds.

THE gap between Tony Blair's Labour Party and its trade union allies
appeared to widen yesterday as the head of one of Britain's largest
unions virtually accused the Labour leader of a lack of courage.
Mr Blair has already suffered a setback in his relations with the
unions with his much cherished reform of Clause 4 being surprisingly
rejected by the public service union Unison.
Now this week at the Scottish TUC, Labour faces a trade union attack
on another front -- its supposed commitment to a national minimum wage.
Angry trade unionists will claim that Labour should stop pussy-footing
around and state what the minimum rate should actually be.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers
union, declared in Perth yesterday, on the eve of conference, that you
''needed courage'' to name the figure.
He stated that it should be at least #4 an hour -- a figure Labour has
been reluctant to back because it fears a sustained Tory attack if it
actually put a price on it.
Mr Morris, though, was adamant that putting a figure on a minimum wage
could be a vote winner, if only Labour had the courage to do so. ''We
believe it would enhance Labour's chances of winning the next
election,'' he said.
He said there were tens of thousands of local authority manual workers
earning as little as #2.50 an hour after competitive tendering who would
be celebrating in the streets if a #4-an-hour minimum wage became a firm
commitment.
As for the expected Tory onslaught on such a position, he said: ''The
fact of the matter is, the Tories will attack it no matter what you do.
If you defend the national health service or seek a decent education
service, the Tories attack you.
''So the suggestion that you can escape Tory attacks by not saying
anything, and merely keeping quiet, quite clearly beggars belief.''
In a clear swipe at Mr Blair, Mr Morris told the T&amp;G delegation
gathering in Perth: ''Good intentions do not win General Elections, good
policies do. On many issues, we have the policies. Now we also need the
courage to campaign.
''The courage to say we will stamp out poverty pay with a minimum wage
of at least #4 an hour. The courage to make full employment the
unambiguous aim, and the first priority, of the next Labour
Government.''
Labour's deputy leader John Prescott will be in Perth later this week
to try to smooth over the rift between the unions and Labour.
However, with motions calling for the restoration of railways to
public ownership, the scrapping of Trident, the end of competitive
tendering, and a declared minimum wage on the agenda, he will have a
difficult job of keeping the unions on his side while not giving away
too many firm commitments.
While Clause 4 of Labour's constitution will not be specifically
debated at what is after all a union, rather than a political party
gathering, its themes underpin many of the debates.
On the economy, for instance, the lead motion calls for the return of
the major public services and utilities to democratic control and an
extension of industrial common ownership. Such views would appear to
have more in common with Labour's present Clause 4 than Mr Blair's
alternative.
While some Labour activists would prefer Mr Morris to take a less
confrontational line, it is the case that Mr Morris himself is fighting
a re-election campaign as general secretary of the T&amp;G against Mr Jack
Dromey, the husband of a Labour MP and someone clearly identified with
the modernisers in the party. It may suit Mr Morris to be seen as being
independent of Labour.
Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the STUC, is obviously keen
that the links between Labour and the unions are not weakened. None the
less, even he remarked yesterday: ''We support full employment and we
note there is no mention of that in the revised Clause 4.''
Although union opposition is making the reform of Clause 4 more
difficult for Labour than it had originally imagined, even that can be
portrayed as being of help to Mr Blair.
If he has a fight with the unions, it is argued, then he can present
Labour as being truly independent of the unions, which should help him
with the voters in the South of England.
It may not be entirely helpful though, with the delegates this week at
the conference.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair and his deputy, Mr John Prescott, should be
investigated by the Commons Committee on Members Interests for failing
to register free hospitality at Gleneagles Hotel, a Tory MP claimed
yesterday.
Mr David Shaw, MP for Dover, is writing to the committee asking it to
act on a number of non-registered events, two involving Mr Blair.
Labour sources accused Mr Shaw of mounting a ''dirty tricks'' campaign
and said the incidents he complained about were not remotely comparable
to the recent Commons censure of two Tory MPs for taking cash to ask
questions.
The most recent date among Mr Shaw's allegations is May of last year
when, he said, Mr Prescott attended a seminar at Gleneagles Hotel
organised by the Conoco oil company.
Several other MPs, Labour and Tory, attended and received
accommodation and a dinner. Only two, both Tories, appear to have
registered the event -- Sir Michael Grylls (Surrey North West) and Mr
Peter Luff (Worcester).
Among those who did not register were Mr George Robertson (Hamilton),
then Labour spokesman on Europe, and Mr Adam Ingram (East Kilbride --
Labour) as well as three Tory back benchers and a Liberal Democrat.
Mr Prescott was abroad and not available for comment last night. Mr
Robertson said: ''The seminar has been run for many years. I cannot see
it falls into the category of reportable items. It is certainly not a
pretext weekend but an important seminar.''
Mr Blair, when Shadow Energy Secretary, also visited the seminar in
1989 which, Mr Shaw admitted, was before Commons rules on what should
and should not be registered were tightened up.
Mr Shaw also complained about Mr Blair's failure to register a free
Concorde flight and stay in Washington in the mid-1980s as a guest of
the Unitary Tax Campaign.
A Labour spokesman said Mr Blair went at the request of the Government
as the campaign aimed to change the way UK firms were taxed in America.
He had stated who was paying for the trip at a news conference before
his departure.
The spokesman said Mr Blair undertook both cases mentioned in his
capacity as an Opposition spokesman.
''There is a fundamental difference between visits and speaking
engagements undertaken in an official capacity and an undeclared free
gift or sightseeing tour. To try to mix the two is a disgraceful and
unworthy smear and the Conservative Party must be truly desperate to try
to make the attempt.''
Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend, Mr Shaw said: ''Mr
Blair and Mr Prescott always come down hard if there is any question of
impropriety by Conservative MPs. Who is coming down hard on Mr Blair and
Mr Prescott?''
It was pointed out that Mr Michael Portillo, now Employment Secretary,
and Mr Stephen Dorrell, now Heritage Secretary, attended the Conoco
conference in 1986 when they were back benchers and did not register the
trip.
Mr Shaw replied that for Mr Blair, who was then a front- bench
spokesman ''to take hospitality from an American company at a very
sensitive time when the electricity privatisation Bill was going through
Parliament, was a serious error of judgment''.
He agreed that failure to register attendance at the conference was an
error, if it was an error, committed by both Conservative and Labour
MPs.
Last night, Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington and chairman of the
Tory back- bench finance committee, said he was at the conference at
Gleneagles Hotel at the same time as Mr Prescott and had not registered
his attendance either ''because I did not think it warranted it''.
A Tory member of the Members' Interests Committee said being put up
overnight by the sponsors of a conference was not likely to be thought
of as unduly influencing an MP.
Mr Blair and Mr Prescott spoke on Labour's energy policy at the
conference and could argue that a free bed and a meal at Gleneagles
Hotel was part of a working engagement.
There also appears to be doubt whether, if Conoco received reduced
rates for the conference, the hospitality received by MPs reached the
#160 level at which it must be registered.

STRATHCLYDE Police yesterday confirmed they have been asked to advise
Rangers player Brian Laudrup on security after the Danish international
complained of being followed by a fan.
The fan involved is believed to have first contacted Mr Laudrup, 26,
when he played in Germany for Bayern Munich three years ago.
A police spokeswoman yesterday confirmed reports in a Sunday newspaper
that the Laudrup family contacted them for advice after the man, who is
believed to be a middle-aged German, was spotted outside Mr Laudrup's
home last week.
She said: ''Mrs Mette Laudrup contacted us for advice on how to
improve the security arrangements for their house.''
The fan had not committed any offence, said the spokesperson, and was
understood not to have tried to contact the Laudrup family in any way.
The player, who won his first Premier Division medal when Rangers
achieved their seventh successive title yesterday, stressed he intended
to honour his contract with the Ibrox club, which has two years to run.
Mr Laudrup also stressed that both he and his wife felt happy and
settled here.
The family have two children, six-year-old son Nicolai and baby
daughter Rasmine, and live in a detached villa in Helensburgh.
Rangers security adviser Mr Alistair Hood said the player had not
contacted him..

GERRY Adams said yesterday that Britain was seeking a victory in
Northern Ireland by subverting the peace process.
At a Dublin ceremony to mark the 79th anniversary of the Easter Rising
against British rule in Ireland, the Sinn Fein president stepped up his
attack on ''Britain's refusal to accept the rights of Sinn Fein
voters''.
In particular, he referred to delays by London in agreeing to talks
between Government Ministers and his party's representatives.
Mr Adams said that, more than six months after the IRA's ceasefire
declaration, ''the British Government refuses to accord Sinn Fein the
same rights, the same equality and respect which all other parties,
including the loyalist groups which have no electoral mandate, now
enjoy''.
He told about 1000 supporters at the republican plot in Dublin's
Glasnevin cemetery: ''If the British refuse to listen to reasoned and
reasonable argument, then let them listen to the sound of marching feet
and angry voices.
''We cannot accept the exclusion of the Sinn Fein electorate from the
dialogue and negotiations which will shape the future of Ireland and the
Irish people.
''The British Government must be moved on this issue. The peace
process cannot be allowed to founder on the rock of British
intransigence.
''For 25 years, the British failed to defeat the republican struggle.
They are now seeking a victory by subverting the peace process.''
Meanwhile, Ireland's Roman Catholic Church leader Cardinal Cahal Daly
yesterday warned that the ''continuing deadlock'' between Britain and
Sinn Fein over meetings with Ministers was ''damaging and endangering
the entire peace process''.
The Catholic primate said it would be unforgiveable if any group or
individual were to be responsible for causing the peace to break down.
* Police yeserday discovered arms and ammunition -- including three
mortars, nine detonators and around 1000 rounds of ammunition -- during
searches in County Cavan near Ballyjamesduff.
The arms were thought to have been stored by the IRA well before the
ceasefire.

AN end to the fish war between Europe and Canada was hailed yesterday
as a victory for fishermen, fisheries conservation, and transatlantic
relations with one of the EU's closest allies.
The acrimony of the last month was all but forgotten in Brussels, as
Mrs Emma Bonino, the EU's outspoken Fisheries Commissioner, declared:
''The rule of law has been restored on the high seas. Europe's fishermen
have retained the right to fish off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.''
Under the deal, agreed yesterday by EU ambassadors, strict enforcement
measures will be imposed on fishing in the North-west Atlantic.
Canada will be able to fish 10,000 tonnes of Greenland halibut this
year, while Spain gets 5013 tonnes on top of the estimated 5000 tonnnes
it has caught so far this year.
With Canada's ambassador to the EU, Mr Jacques Roy, at her side at a
news conference, Mrs Bonino -- who a fortnight ago described the
Canadian authorities as acting like pirates -- said: ''It would be very
easy to claim a victory. But that is not the point.
''Both sides have come to an agreement and I hope that now our
relations with Canada will be different and that enforcement of the
fishery control and conservation of stocks will be to the common good.''
The dispute put Britain's loyalties to the test when the Government
made it clear it would not back EU trade sanctions, if required, to
protect fishing rights off the Newfoundland coast.
Yesterday, Britain's EU ambassador, Sir John Kerr, said: ''Effective
conservation and the maintenance of the right relationship with our
Canadian friends and allies are strong British interests, and interests
common to all parties in the negotiations. So the agreement is a good
one for everybody.''
The deal will be signed formally by all EU governments today. It must
then be endorsed formally by other countries who are part of the North
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation. Officials said it was a formality.
The settlement includes:
* A share-out of Greenland halibut in international waters off the
Grand Banks.
* A different share-out of Greenland halibut next year, with the EU
given 41% of the total available catch off the Newfoundland coast.
* Strict control measures to be introduced as soon as possible,
including observers on all trawlers fishing international waters off the
Canadian coast.
* The deal will be concluded after Canada has returned the #300,000
bail bond exacted from Spain for the release of the trawler Estai,
seized by Canadian officials when the fishing war broke out.
* Canada agrees to repeal the law of March 3, by which it declared
international waters beyond its 200-mile limit to be out of bounds to
non-Canadian fishing vessels.
Meanwhile, a coastguard helicopter took off early today to fly 240
miles west of Benbecula to pick up a badly injured Spanish crewman and
fly him to hospital.
An RAF Nimrod was also due to take off from Kinloss to act as top
cover for the helicopter.
The request for help came from the Spanish trawler Moraine via
Valentia Radio in the south of Ireland, where the operators speak

A NEW row over mine warfare training is threatening to sour relations
between Clyde fishermen and the Royal Navy only days before the
settlement of a five-year submarine safety dispute.
There are claims that the bulk of specialised naval activity is to be
transferred to Scotland's west coast to avoid upset to fishermen and
tourists off the south of England.
Mr Patrick Stewart, secretary of the 135-boat Clyde Fishermen's
Association, said: ''We understand that the navy has ruled that as
little training as possible be carried out off Portsmouth and Plymouth
for fear of offending the fishing industry.
''But it appears to be acceptable to carry out that activity in the
provinces. It seems to have escaped the attention of the Defence
Ministry and the Government that the Clyde's own fishing industry is
capable of commanding a great deal of political attention when justified
and required.''
The CFA was the leading campaigning body for submarine safety after
the accidental sinking of the Carradale fishing vessel Antares by the RN
hunter-killer HMS Trenchant in 1990. Four trawlermen were dragged to
their deaths in the Sound of Bute after their nets were snagged during
an exercise.
All of the UK fishermen's organisations are expected next week to
ratify a new set of guidelines which meet the majority of the common
safety concerns between themselves and submariners.
Howeer, the closure of Rosyth as a naval base on Scotland's east coast
is now posing a new problem.
A squadron of seven minehunters formerly based there is now located at
the Faslane submarine base. A second squadron has been re-based at
Portsmouth. The wartime role of both squadrons was to sweep and clear
mines from the approaches to major naval harbours.
Both squadrons exercise in the Clyde. The Defence Ministry admits that
mine warfare training will be concentrated in Scotland from now on.
The Faslane base and its satellite depot at Coulport, home to the
outgoing Polaris missile boats and the new Vanguard-class Trident
submarines, have to accommodate an extra 400 naval and 70 civilian
personnel. They already play host to 4000 sailors and Royal Marines.
Mr Stewart said: ''A practice minefield was laid off the Mull of
Kintyre several months ago. It was never cleared. When an exercise
ended, the mines remained.
''They are not armed and pose no direct threat to life but a fishing
vessel catching one faces immense damage to its nets. Any increase in
naval activity in the area must be to the detriment of the fishing
industry.''
A Royal Navy spokesman said: ''There may be an increase in training on
the Clyde but it will not be a vast increase. We always look at areas
such as Loch Fyne and the Kyles, and try to concentrate exercises at
times when fishing activity is minimal.
''We have a long-standing agreement to pay compensation, where
appropriate, for any damage caused. It is not a major problem.''
The UK's fishing organisations are poised to sign a deal which will
involve the navy assigning a guard ship to every exercise where
submarines are deployed. This vessel will act as liaison between
trawlers and warships in the area.
A senior naval officer has also been appointed as fisheries liaison
officer and given the task of providing advance warning of submarine
activity in fishing grounds.
In addition, all potential ''officers of the watch'', the men likely
to be in temporary command of a submarine, are being given extra safety
training.
Current rules state that a completely submerged submarine must
maintain a minimum 4000 yards distance from the nearest fishing vessel,
or 1500 yards at periscope depth.
Any officer of the watch in any doubt about the position of a nearby
trawler must come to periscope depth immediately to determine the
situation. The only exceptions are submarines on clandestine or active
operations.

<HEADLINE>The whole thing stinks, says Paisley North MP.  Scandal of drugs scam hits Labour</HEADLINE>

A MASSIVE rift within the Scottish Labour Party, over allegations of
gerrymandering of branch membership and involvements in a drugs and
money laundering scam, has been exposed by party office holders.
The political scandal is emerging in Renfrewshire where an MP is
preparing to disclose a web of corruption and criminal activity, while
her colleagues expose a campaign of intimidation by fellow Labour Party
members.
Last night the general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party said he
had ordered a full inquiry, while Strathclyde Regional Council is
carrying out its own investigation into the claims of impropriety.
The spate of recent drug-related shootings in Renfrewshire is behind
plans by the Paisley North MP, Mrs Irene Adams, to use parliamentary
privilege to open inquiries into the activities of a community business
funded by Renfrew District Council, Strathclyde Regional Council, and
the Scottish Office, and run by Labour Party members.
Mrs Adams has already issued a formal complaint to Strathclyde Police
and tomorrow will ask the Scottish Office to conduct a formal
investigation into the company, which she claims is a front for illegal
activities.
The Herald understands that the company at the centre of Mrs Adams's
concerns has also been referred to the Charities Office and is the
subject of several complaints from opposition members on Renfrew
District Council. Two local Labour councillors are members of the
company's board and the secretary of a local branch is also a director
of the group's holding company.
Mrs Adams told The Herald: ''For some time now people have been coming
to my surgery with comments about this company, but have been too scared
to make any complaints.''
She alleges that gerrymandering of a local branch of the Labour Party
has taken place, with the appointment of 14 new members funded by the
community business. She said the branch had been suspended by the Labour
Party, but was reinstated last December.
She claimed it was part of an orchestrated move to take over parts of
the Renfrew Labour Party and put key people in positions of power,
allowing them control of the community business. ''It has all been
hushed up, but not any longer,'' she added.
Mrs Adams said it did not bother her that fellow members of the Labour
Party could be involved in protecting the underworld operations.
''The whole thing stinks,'' she said. ''I don't care who is involved
and what the party is. If something like this is going on and they know
about but are doing nothing then they are equally guilty. And if they
are involved . . . then hell mend them.''
Mrs Olga Clayton, a Renfrew District Council member and a director of
the community company named by Mrs Adams, said the allegations concerned
her greatly.
''I am as concerned about this as Irene Adams,'' she said. ''I am also
aware of the tie-up. That scares everybody and most people are too
frightened to speak to the police -- we have all got families.
''I would welcome any inquiry to clear this up,'' she added.
Mrs Adams's concerns are supported by Mr Con O'Driscoll, the secretary
of Renfrew District Labour Party, who says that the activities of
certain Labour councillors have sickened him.
''There are 140 new Labour Party members in the area whose memberships
were all payrolled by one individual,'' he claimed. This, he explained,
showed the extent to which certain people were prepared to go to control
the local Labour party and its activities.
''I stumbled into this network of corruption by chance when I decided
to stand for selection as a Labour candidate last year.
''Then the threats started and I was advised I could get 'done in' if
I continued.
''I had paint bombs on the back and front of my house,'' he said.
''Certain regional councillors also resorted to intimidating a party
member who is head of a local Catholic school, saying that if the vote
went for me the school would close.''
He said other people who supported him had their jobs threatened or
were victimised in a variety of other ways.
Last night Mr Jack McConnell, the general secretary of the Scottish
Labour Party, said he was aware of the rifts within the Renfrew Labour
Party and had ordered a full investigation.
''As a party we will look at local party organisation and branch
organisation in the area and the way in which people stood and were
selected for the recent elections, and the allegations which have been
made,'' he said.
Renfrew District Councillor Hugh Henry, the nominated leader of the
new Renfrewshire unitary authority, said yesterday that he was aware of
the strength of the allegations, and if they persisted investigations
would take place at all levels.
''I want the new local authority to start from a basis of integrity
and honesty and not take on board any malpractices from either
Strathclyde Regional Council or Renfrew District Council,'' he said.
''I will have no hesitation in ordering a full investigation of any
allegations and will not be party to any cover-up of anything immoral or
illegal, even if members of the Labour Party are involved.''
Councillor John Mullin, convener of Strathclyde Regional Council's
powerful finance committee, told The Herald that complaints concerning
the alleged activities within Renfrewshire had been received by the
council ''some months ago''.
An investigation under the auspices of the council's chief executive,
Mr Neil McIntosh, was still going on.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said they had received Mrs Adams's
complaint and were meanwhile following numerous lines of inquiry after a
recent murder in Linwood. The spokesman said the police could not
comment any further.
The Scottish Office denied involvement in the running of the named
community company, and said it was not in a position to comment on the
allegations.

A HOSPITAL chaplain seems likely to join a health trust's board,
despite being told by the chairman that he was not the type of person he
wanted to serve on the board.
Mr John McFall, the Labour MP for Dumbarton, was ''outraged'' by Mr
Stephen Newall's rejection of the minister as board material for Lomond
Healthcare Trust. He wrote to the Scottish Health Minister, Lord Fraser
of Carmyllie, to complain.
Yesterday, it looked as if Mr Newall had been pulled into line by the
Scottish Office.
He has contacted the Rev Ian Miller, of Bonhill Parish Church in
Dunbartonshire, who is chaplain to Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria.
Mr Miller admitted that he had spoken to Mr Newall again but declined to
comment further. Mr Newall was not available for comment yesterday.
Mr McFall said: ''I think we can expect a public statement soon. The
chaplain is an ideal person for the board and has the patients'
interests at heart.
''At the moment, the board appears to be stacked with middle-class
people, mainly from Helensburgh.
''The chaplain will represent the interests of the ordinary men and
women from Dumbarton and Vale of Leven who make up the bulk of the
patients the trust has been put there to serve.''

MOVES to re-organise the chaplains system in the RAF have been
blocked, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is to be told.
Nor has there been progress on breaking down the attitude that the air
force's senior chaplain should always be provided by the Church of
England.
The Kirk's Committee on Chaplains to the Forces will report that
efforts during four years to unify the three branches of RAF chaplains
have not been successful and will ask the Assembly to record dismay at
the lack of progress.
The three branches are the Church of England, the Church of Scotland
and Free Churches, and the Roman Catholic.
Practices have grown up within the RAF in which the chaplain-in-chief,
who is the head of the Church of England branch, has been used as though
he were the head of a unified branch, says the committee.
Its aim is to achieve agreement that ''the best person for the job''
should carry out the duties in a unified branch, forming a senior
management team with the principal chaplains of the two other branches.

RUPERT Murdoch's #75m masterplan for a rugby league super league faces
increasing criticism from MPs.
Representatives of the 80 members of the cross-party parliamentary
rugby league group will meet Mr Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the Heritage
Select Committee, on its return to the Commons tomorrow, to discuss the
implications of the proposals.
''We will ask whether the purchasing, lock, stock, and barrel, of
rugby league constitutes unacceptable business practices,'' said Ian
McCartney, MP for Makerfield, in the sport's Lancashire heartland, and
chairman of the group.
He said the matter could also be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission amid fears that Mr Murdoch was creaming off all
Britain's major sporting events piecemeal.
''No sport in the UK is safe,'' claimed Mr McCartney.
''Almost all major sporting events in Great Britain are controlled by
a minority TV channel and it will remain a minority TV channel well into
the next century.
''This is not just important to the future of rugby league but also to
the nation and the future of British broadcasting. It is a fundamental
issue and Parliament must decide if it's right for sport to be bought in
this way.
''Murdoch says he is giving rugby league a worldwide audience but
what's the point of showing the game in Beijing when people in Bolton,
Barrow, and Blackpool can't watch because they haven't got a Sky dish?''
said Mr McCartney.
''Rugby league is the second largest sport in Britain and it's
essentially an honest game, with no racism or violence. It is not just a
sport, it's part of the community.''
The Murdoch shake-up proposes a super league, or ''fantasy league'' as
Mr McCartney prefers to call it, of 14 elite teams, including two from
France, with a scheduled launch in March 1996.
It will mean many teams with decades of tradition merging with rivals
and losing their historic identities.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry ordered on new  bacteria in beef</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978845924</RECORDNO>

THE Government has ordered a report into a new form of food poisoning,
it emerged yesterday.
Doctors fear that the new bacteria strain in beef may be untreatable
and has been responsible for dozens of deaths, mainly in children.
A spokesman for the Department of Health confirmed that a working
group had been examining ''an emerging pathogen which has been known
about for the last 15 years''.
He said more cases have come to light as knowledge has grown and
laboratory techniques improved. He repeated existing Government warnings
over the cooking and handling of beef and stressed that beefburgers in
particular should be cooked ''all the way through''.
The inquiry is thought to reveal a growing threat from the organism,
which is believed to kill 50 people every year and affect a further 650.
It is believed fatalities occur when blood clots form in the brain and
bacteria causes kidney infections. Doctors fear those young victims who
survive may suffer kidney failure in later years.
The inquiry is thought to have been ordered amid concern over E-coli
bacteria.
Relatives of victims of the E-coli outbreak in West Lothian, which
affected 69 people and resulted in the death of Bathgate youngster,
Claire Davison, welcomed the inquiry.
Mr Kenneth Armit, of Livingston, whose four-year-old son, Ryan, was
affected, said: ''I hope it can find out why it happens and stop it
happening again, to stop more children suffering like my son.''
Ryan was given the all clear by doctors in March -- nine months after
he was struck by the bacteria in the world's largest milk-borne E-coli
outbreak.
Mr Armit is among a number of families considering legal action
against the dairy owners blamed for his son's illness.
Robert and Margaret Haston, owners of the Redhouse Dairy in Blackburn,
West Lothian, were fined #2000 at Linlithgow Sheriff Court in March
after being convicted of producing milk contaminated with E-coli
bacteria.
The couple plan to appeal.
Ms Carolyn Reilly, 32, also of Livingston, whose three-year-old son,
Michael, underwent kidney dialysis and is now waiting for a transplant
after he was infected, said: ''Anything which can be done to spare other
families what we have been through can only help.''
Ms Reilly said her thoughts were also with the mother of Haddington
toddler, Stephen Johnston, who is still seriously ill in hospital in
Edinburgh. Doctors fear the youngster may need a kidney transplant.
His mother was also found to be carrying the bacteria but did not
develop any symptoms.
Two sisters from Tranent, aged two and four, who shared a meal with
the family, were also treated in hospital after falling ill, but have
since been allowed home.

Scientists claim major breakthrough in tests on animals as plan is
announced for global monitoring
SCIENTISTS have made a major breakthrough in the battle to beat
necrotising fasciitis, the deadly ''flesh-eating'' disease which caused
a major health scare in central Scotland and the west of England last
year.
It comes as the World Health Organisation outlined plans to include it
in a new global monitoring programme of unusual diseases.
Tests on animals show that the drug clindamycin is effective against
the disease. Penicillin also works, but the lethal organisms multiply so
fast that within 24 hours it becomes ineffective.
The medical advance coincides with the launch of a programme by
hospitals throughout the European Union to log all outbreaks of
infection by the bacteria known as invasive group A streptococci.
The organisms are also included in a WHO report to be presented in
Geneva next month on rising levels of microbial resistance to
antibiotics.
Victims of the disease are usually those who have undergone surgery or
have open wounds and all age groups are vulnerable.
Dr Dennis Stevens, Professor of Medicine at the University of
Washington, Seattle, told a recent international medical congress in
Vienna that clindamycin could stop the production of the deadly toxins
which can cause shock, organ failure, and even death.
He said experiments with mice show that the antibiotic -- already used
in hospitals for diseases including rheumatic and scarlet fever -- could
be administered up to 48 hours after infection, with a survival rate of
up to 90%. He said that incidence of attacks by the bacteria was as high
as 10 to 20 people per 100,000.
Between 30% and 50% of those infected are likely to die if the
infection is not treated quickly or correctly and a patient who survives
may often need ''heroic surgery'' to remove large areas of infected
flesh or amputation of an arm or leg.
In the first six months of last year, the disease affected 18 people
in Britain, of whom 11 died. Seven of the victims lived within a 25-mile
radius in Gloucestershire.
A 43-year-old plumber from Cardiff felt leg pains two weeks after
suffering a sore throat. He went to hospital thinking he had a strained
muscle and died 18 hours later.
In another case, a Gloucestershire GP barely had time to get to
hospital before he died of the infection.
News of the breakthrough was welcomed yesterday by British medical
experts. Dr Bernard Dixon, microbiologist and editor of the Medical
Science Research, said: ''It is entirely plausible -- but I have not yet
heard about it. I can see it being a major step forward.''
Dr Curtis Gemmell, Reader in bacteriology at Glasgow University
Medical School, said: ''The concept of suppressing bacterial toxi
production by certain antibiotics is not new but the application is. It
sounds very appropriate and could be effective.''
Announcing that a surveillance programme on the disease is to be
presented to the World Health Organisation next month, Dr James Le Duc,
of the WHO division of communicable diseases, said yesterday: ''One of
the consequences of the outbreaks last year is that a much improved
hospital monitoring network has been set up by the European Community.''
This had developed from an effective hospital monitoring system
against the disease in Scandinavia, he said.

DOCTORS believe that identical twins born nine months ago are winning
their battle against a life-threatening heart condition.
The twins, Chloe and Kirsten McGregor, were found to have stenosis, or
obstruction, in different areas near their heart valves, and each had an
obstruction of the blood supply to their lungs.
Their condition was diagnosed within hours of birth.
Heart specialists have operated successfully on Chloe and are now
assessing Kirsten.
Parents Sue and Iain McGregor, a staff nurse and theatre auxiliary,
from Wishaw, Lanarkshire, were stunned when doctors told them of the
twins' condition.
''It was like a bolt out of the blue,'' said Mrs McGregor.
''I had gone into labour five weeks early but even so the girls were a
good weight.''
Twins are often born early. Kirsten was 4lb 9oz and Chloe 5lb 6oz.
''We were absolutely elated at delivering two beautiful bouncing baby
girls,'' she added.
''The pregnancy had gone well and there was no indication of any
problems until then. But because we are both health workers our minds
went into overdrive imagining the worst.''
Mr McDonald revealed that one of the first things he reached for was a
text book on cardiology. ''It was part of a desperate need to find out
everything I could about the girls' problem.
''And it didn't make comfortable reading because you tend to home in
on the worse possible scenario and pray that doesn't happen.''
Careful monitoring of the babies by a team of heart specialists at the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow revealed that Chloe needed
open-heart surgery, which wascarried out by Mr Ken MacArthur.
Cardiologist Dr Neil Wilson said: ''The surgery is highly skilled
because it is very difficult operating on children of that size. The
working area is very tiny.
''But it has been successful and we are delighted with Chloe's
progress.
''If one identical twin is found to have a heart defect then it is not
unusual for other to have it, too.
''They are both very treatable disorders and the outlook is good with
correctly-timed surgery.
''Treatment was needed sooner in Chloe. Kirsten may be done in the
next year or two,'' he added.

LOCAL authorities on Loch Lomondside have been urged to halt the
granting of approval to development projects by big business against
residents' wishes.
Loch Lomond Association chairman, Mr Alex Barnes, cited the approval
of a helicopter pad for Cameron House Hotel and Country Estate as one
project given approval against the community's wishes.
Mr Barnes was also critical of the granting of planning permission to
a company headed by former Celtic FC director Michael Kelly for a
housing and tourism development at Drum-kinnon Bay.
Dr Kelly's company later sold the land to Dunbartonshire Enterprise
for nearly #3m.
Mr Barnes said: ''We want controls on developers and the so-called big
bucks brigade.
''There is a growing groundswell of opinion that the voice of the
people living here must be taken into account.
''Loch Lomond must not be allowed to become a playground for the rich
or a mecca for entrepreneurs with an eye for the fast buck.
''For some of us, Loch Lomond is our home.''
The association's members include hoteliers, guest house owners, and
boat owners.
Mr John McFall, MP for Dumbarton, said: ''There's a great deal of
sense in what they are saying.
''The Government's recent proposals for Loch Lomond are a complete
fudge.
''This jewel in the crown of Scotland's tourist industry should be
treasured, not neglected.''
* Tourists flocked to Loch Lomond for the Easter weekend.
Ranger patrols were stepped up to deter speeding power boats and jet
skiers after the passing of new by-laws.

A YOUNG wife saw her husband fall 500ft to his death at the weekend in
a climbing accident in the West Highlands.
The couple, who were married recently, were in a party of four
climbers descending a mountain when Mr David Lawless, 27, a banker, of
Molyneaux Road, Liverpool, slipped and fell on 3284ft Sgorr Dhonuill,
one of three peaks in the horseshoe of Beinn a'Bheithir, above
Ballachulish, Argyll.
He was the 23rd person to die on Scotland's mountains since the New
Year.
The accident happened at about 2.30pm on Saturday near the North Ridge
of the mountain. One of the group went down the mountain to raise the
alarm and Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team was called out together with a
Sea King helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth.
Mr John Grieve, leader of the Glencoe team, said: ''When we arrived on
the scene, the young man was still breathing and our paradmedic worked
for 20 minutes to try to save him.''
Ironically, it was the party's decision to play it safe that led to
the fall. When they saw how steep the descent of the north ridge was,
they decided to take an easier route down.
* A woman in her 50s was airlifted to hospital from a hillside on
Lewis after she fell and broke her leg while out walking.
Mrs Marie Mackenzie, of Steinish, near Stornoway, was walking with her
husband on a ridge above the village of Marvig, South Lochs, when she
slipped and fell.
Paramedics decided against trying to bring her down the very steep
hill and called out the Stornoway coastguard helicopter, which airlifted
Mrs Mackenzie to Western Isles Hospital.
A relative said last night that Mrs Mackenzie was making a good
recovery and could be out of hospital later today.
* An estate owner suffered a serious leg injury after falling near the
top of a mountain. Mr Richard Munday, 49, of Kinlochshieldaig Estate,
Shieldaig, had been reported late in coming off Ben Shieldaig, Wester
Ross.
Torridon Mountain Rescue Team and a helicopter from RAF Pitreavie were
called out and he was found near the summit. Mr Munday was airlifted to
Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.
* Jaqueline Black, 28, of Carron, by Falkirk, was rescued by
helicopter after injuring a shoulder while climbing Ben Venue in Glen
Ledard, near Aberfoyle. She was treated and released from Vale of Leven
Hospital.

Ayr United 1, Clydebank 0
CLYDEBANK coach Brian Wright believes that this match may have been
won and lost before a ball was kicked.
''They obviously had the same idea as us,'' he said. ''Win the toss,
get that wind at your back, and see what happens.''
What did happen was that, thanks to the strong wind blowing directly
down the pitch, Ayr had the Bankies pinned inside their own half for the
entire first period.
Clydebank keeper Gary Matthews had already made a good save from a
Cameron Connie header, and John Sharples should have done better than
shoot over after good work by Ian Gilzean before Ayr got the vital
breakthrough in the thirteenth minute.
Hugh Burns' long throw-in was touched on by Justin Jackson to Ross
Tannock, who in turn flicked the ball to the unguarded Gilzean at the
far post. The big striker had a simple task in nodding the ball past the
stranded Matthews.
Ayr's difficulties are highlighted inasmuch as Gilzean's third goal of
the season makes him the club's joint-top scorer.
After the turnaround, it was the home defence which was under pressure
for long periods, but the Clydebank attack failed to get a shot on
target. Only a John McStay header caused Stuart McIntosh in the Ayr goal
any anxiety.
''I thought the young keeper did well,'' was Simon Stainrod's view
after the match. Indeed the keeper may be on his way to cult-hero status
down Ayr way after having saved a last-minute penalty last week and now
keeping only Ayr's fifth clean sheet of the season.
As for Wright, his side ''didn't deserve anything -- we didn't do
enough to justify even a point.'' This defeat leaves them only one spot
above the relegation area, three points in front of Ayr.
''April was always going to be a big month for us,'' said Wright,
''with Hamilton, Stranraer, and St Mirren all to play this month. If we
don't win at least the home games, then we don't deserve to be in this
league.''

Dundee United 1 Kilmarnock 2
THREE premier-division victories in a row may seem small fry in
comparison to seven title wins on the trot, but the extent of the
Kilmarnock support's weekend celebration of almost-assured top-10 status
next season displayed no less enthusiasm than that of the Rangers fans
at Ibrox.
The loyal travellers from Ayrshire had every right to voice their
delight at a win that all but confirms their favourites' name as 95-96
runners come the restart of hostilities in August.
However, such assurance is far from being enjoyed by United, whose
unexpected plummet toward next term's first division gathered further
pace from the moment in 86 minutes when John Henry powered Killie's
winner into the home net.
It is now more than seven weeks and seven games since United last won
a league fixture, with just a solitary point from the 21 available in
that time. Games are fast running out on new manager Billy Kirkwood as
he bids to keep afloat a side once recognised as the Tangerine terrors.
Terrors they may once have been, but sadly, as far as the support that
celebrated a Scottish Cup triumph less than a year ago is concerned, the
flames of Tannadice ambition appear to have died.
In fact, the premature departure of many of the faithful on Saturday
spoke volumes about the fans' belief in United's ability to scratch
their way clear of the pit they have dug for themselves this season.
The current lack of both concentration and confidence in the side is
evidence at almost every turn, the former never more obvious than when
both Dave Hannah and Mark Perry went for the same ball, missed it, and
allowed Kilmarnock substitute Billy Findlay to race clear to provide the
cross for Henry's late winner.
On the confidence side, the question at Tannadice these days has to
be: what confidence? A scoring record of only four goals in seven league
games, half of those from central defenders, hints at a strike force
quitting on its responsibilities when most required.
Kirkwood has four games left in which to produce a Houdini-style
escape, the first of which goes ahead against in-the-mood Partick
Thistle at Firhill tomorrow. This time he will be strengthened by the
return after suspension of Scottish internationalist Maurice Malpas.
However, after that one, Billy McKinlay, Brian Welsh, and Dave Bowman
will sit out the remainder of the season on the sidelines because of
bans.
United could not have asked for a brighter start on Saturday, Gordan
Petric nodding in a McKinlay corner from close range in 14 minutes.
However, a lapse of concentration allowed Kimarnock defender Neil
Whitworth to blast home a 30-yarder when a retreating home defence
allowed him a free strike at the target.
Henry's six-yard finish near the end completed a day of delight for
the visitors, but one of heartbreak for United.

Hearts 0, Partick Thistle 1
ALMOST a month ago Hearts beat Rangers 2-1 in the premier division two
weeks after having knocked them out of the cup. It has been downhill all
the way since.
One draw and five successive losing games, including the defeat in the
Scottish Cup semi-final by Airdrie, have transformed their season, which
was building up to a glorious crescendo, into a flat anti-climax.
Worse, they are in serious danger of being sucked into the chute that
would hurl them into an alarming financial scenario if they were to be
relegated. A month is a dreadfully long time in the old ball game.
Injuries and the disappointment of missing out on the great cup finale
next month have devastated the Tynecastle side, to the point where they
seem psychologically vulnerable.
They were going along in good style against Thistle, even if they
missed a series of chances -- many of them saved by their former keeper,
Nicky Walker -- but when they went a goal behind, it was as if they knew
that the world was conspiring against them. God is anti-Hearts, so
what's the point?
It is a situation which leaves manager Tommy McLean with a delicate
problem if he is to motivate his players over their last four games.
With the soul of his team out through injury -- two key defenders, two
top midfielders, and two main strikers -- McLean knows he has to strike
a balance between encouragement and threat.
''It is going to be a hard fight now,'' he said, ''because even if we
were able to do something in the transfer market, it is past the
deadline. We will have to get by with what we have.''
The programme coming up allows no room for excessive optimism, with
Celtic, Aberdeen, Hibs, and Motherwell making up the final four
opponents.
In contrast, Partick Thistle will not even look at their remaining
opponents. They all come alike to the Maryhill gang and their
irrepressible manager, John Lambie, who has seen his team lose only once
in the past 11 games, a run that has lifted them from stonewall
certainties to be relegated to third, maybe even fourth favourites.
Lazarus might have got up quicker but he was no more spectacular.
They are edging ever closer to the safety zone in a league which has a
bizarre look about it. ''We're only four points behind Celtic,'' said
Lambie, ''which shows you how crazy this league is.''
He has been referred to as a bit crazy himself on occasion, but he can
handle that, as long as his team respond to his singular style of
management.
''Our goalie was magnificent. That is the best he has played against
Hearts,'' he added, a bit cryptically. ''I might have allowed myself a
wee thought about getting to safety if Aberdeen had lost, but there is
still a long way to go. We have got to keep battling away as we have
been.''
If any team in the division has whatever the undefinable talents are
to escape relegation, it is Thistle. They looked a poor second-best for
most of the first half, when the impression was that a goal for Hearts
would be a starter for some, but the longer they held out, the more
chance there was of them calling up that indomitable impudence which has
catapulted them up the table.
It surfaced after the interval when they realised that Hearts had just
about run out of ideas. Alan Dinnie, who had been brought on to combat
the danger from John Millar, knocked in the goal that was to matter
within eight minutes, and it was then a case of seeing if Hearts could
conjure up a way out of the well.
They could not, despite some valiant efforts, and in fact might well
have been caught out for some slack defending in the process.
In the first half they had looked assured enough to take care of the
problem team of the league (they're everybody's problem), but when
Walker made a remarkable save, touching a header by Alan Johnston on to
the inside of the post, and then had the good fortune to catch the
rebound, they might have guessed it was not to be their day.
McLean agreed: ''They get to the point where they feel it is not their
day, but that attitude is no good to us at this stage of the season. We
lost our shape and in the end were a shambles.''
That would have been emphasised if Roddy Grant's shot near the end had
made the score 2-0. Instead, it hit the same inside portion of the same
post where Johnston's header had ended up, and came out in a similar
fashion.
Walker offered a neat explanation of Lambie's half-time team talk.
''He told us we hadn't been playing too much football and that we had
better start. At least, it was something like that.''
Maybe therein lies the secret. They can laugh at Firhill, even when
the going gets tough.

THE Glasgow Cup final will be an Old Firm clash between Rangers and
Celtic. That was decided yesterday after the final qualifying games when
Rangers beat Clyde 5-1 and Celtic drew 1-1 with Partick Thistle. The
Rangers goals came from Mathieson and Graham with two each, and Robson,
while the Clyde counter was by McConnell. Celtic's goal came from
Anthony, while Partick scored through Stirling.
The final is at Hampden Park on Sunday, April 30.

Hamilton 1, Dundee 4
DUNDEE are back on course for a place in the premier division, and how
manager Jim Duffy enjoyed a return to Firhill on Saturday.
Duffy has fond memories of the ground in Maryhill, for he had a happy
time there when with Partick Thistle.
Nowadays, Hamilton are playing their home games there while awaiting
the development of a new stadium, but it was Dundee who looked at home,
particularly during an outstanding first period which enabled them to
troop towards the dressing room with a four-goal lead by the interval.
Little George Shaw, who used to rush about over every inch of the
Firhill pitch when a player with Thistle, showed that he had not
forgotten where the goal lies, for he struck with only six minutes gone.
Jim Hamilton then hit a 10-minute hat trick to put Dundee on Easy
Street. A Peter Duffield goal for Hamilton minutes into the second half
was hardly even an irritant.
Duffy was in good form later as he handed out the bouquets: ''I'm
delighted that Shaw got on the score-sheet early, for that helped him
after his disappointment last week of missing an important penalty kick.
''And what about that hat trick from Hamilton? They included some
great goals.
''I know we were four ahead by the interval and did not add to the
scoreline in the second half. But I cannot be too critical. I have got
to praise my players for that first 45 minutes, for that was a great
performance going forward.
''Now we are at the top again. It has been a season when four clubs
have switched places. Now, however, we have got it in our own hands, for
it is what Dundee do that matters.''
Certainly Hamilton never looked like breaking that bogy they have
faced throughout the season when meeting Dundee, and were simply swept
aside.
Their manager Iain Munro could only point towards the mistakes which
were punished by a Dundee side with only one intent in mind -- the three
points necessary as they bid for the premier division.

St Mirren 2, Stranraer 0
TO THE dark arithmetic of the relegation tussle, St Mirren added some
brighter numbers. They won, which was rare enough, and by a difference
of two goals, which made Saturday next to unique for them in this
championship.
Though achieved in rather less than a blaze of glory, the win offered
some shelter. And, because of events elsewhere, Saints find themselves
sitting a little less uncomfortably.
Stranraer's fall was confirmed, now that it has been decided that they
must go back to where they came from, the other clubs in danger have
been made half-safe. That is the optimistic point of view. The other way
to look at their predicaments is to see them still half in the soup.
Clydebank's defeat by Ayr United makes it a thicker broth.
It turns the dance of death into a threesome. ''Interesting,'' was how
Jimmy Bone, the St Mirren manager, described the shifting scene that the
weekend's work has created.
It is far too excited a word to use about the contest at Love Street.
Really it was hardly a contest at all. Stranraer, and no harm to them,
were hardly in it. They went out with a whimper.
If the result added some salt and pepper to the dish that's being
served at the bottom of the first-division table, the makings of it
offered little to smack the lips over.
St Mirren had their brace after 21 minutes. Grant Inglis hit the
opener and James Dick clinched it by prodding in after a hard, low shot
by Alex Bone had pinballed about the goal area.
In the circumstances in which St Mirren find themselves, a lead of two
goals is not so much a cushion as a bouncy castle.
Stranraer never looked like scaling its battlements. Soon after they
were two down, they rallied to make one attack, moving smartly almost
the length of the park, Lex Grant squared the ball precisely from the
left for Darren Henderson to shoot well -- but just over.
Towards the end, Kenny Brannigan tried to pass the ball into the top
of the net only to hit the crossbar.
There was a general lack of conviction about Stranraer that they would
ever score -- although Grant lumbered about to good effect. Some of his
long passes were special. He paced and placed himself sensibly. His
apparently lazy ways suited the afternoon sunshine.
St Mirren's mood is hard to gauge. They seem to have confidence about
their survival, but it is the uneasy kind of confidence that needs
sleepless nights to sustain.
They have about them a twitchy optimism. Barry Lavety had his moments.
In one bright patch he dribbled past three defenders while running the
ball most of the time a yard ahead of him. After a booking, he was
replaced by Ricky Gillies, who added a touch of elegance, looping a long
ball just past and flighting a 20-yarder off a post.
Norrie McWhirter was a stalwart, while Barry McLaughlin showed some
style. All it added up to, however, was three points. ''I wouldn't draw
the curtains to watch that at my back door,'' Jimmy Bone said.

St Johnstone 1, Dunfermline 1
DUNFERMLINE manager Bert Paton is eager to exorcise the ghosts of last
season, when the Fife club was pipped for promotion by Falkirk on a
dramatic final day.
The championship challenge again looks set to go all the way, with
four teams squabbling over the title this term.
A late leveller from St Johnstone substitute Gary Farquhar denied the
Pars pole position, leaving manager Paton challenging his injury-hit
squad to show the mettle required of champions in their four games.
Home advantage could prove crucial, but Paton observed: ''The pressure
the players are coming under showed in a nervy first half, but if you
want to go upstairs to the premier division, you have to handle it.
''Some of my players don't believe in themselves. We've been hit by
injuries -- players like Hamish French, Neale Cooper, Kenny Ward, and
recent signing Greg Shaw would have been automatic starters -- but the
players who have come in are good enough.
''They will get us there, if only they would believe in themselves.''
Dunfermline, urged on by nearly 3000 expectant travelling fans,
snatched the lead after 61 minutes when experienced midfielder Craig
Robertson steered a lob over blameless Perth keeper Alan Main. But
manager Paton conceded that second-half possession looked unlikely to
yield further reward.
The scorer maintained Lady Luck will have a major role to play, but
insisted: ''We'll prove a few people wrong by winning the championship.
That's acting as a real spur to us.''
Paton said the onus was on leading scorer Stewart Petrie to rediscover
his form, with the manager frankly acknowledging: ''He's our only
out-and-out striker and if he isn't scoring, I'm worried sick.''
The Fife manager was scathing about defensive frailties which allowed
Perth substitute Farquhar to equalise in the closing minutes with a
spectacular 20-yard thunderbolt.
''We gave the ball away and then we left them with a free shot on the
edge of the box. That was criminal,'' he said.
Pre-season championship favourites St Johnstone are in the also-ran
bracket, but they could yet prove king-makers, with fixtures looming
against Dunfermline's three rivals for the first-division crown.
With Perth manager Paul Sturrock on a weekend scouting mission, his
assistant John Blackley took the reins. He said it was too close to call
at the top of the table.
He noted: ''All four teams are certainly good enough to go up, but it
will come down to which team has the bottle and the attitude to merit
the championship.''

Aberdeen 2, Celtic 0
THIS was the result -- and the performance -- Aberdeen manager Roy
Aitken had demanded against his former club.
A victory was essential after a run of seven games without one.
Goals were important, too, after the home supporters had not seen one
scored at Pittodrie since Aitken's debut as caretaker manager in the 2-0
win over Rangers.
But, while it was obvious just how much Aitken relished this win, he
made it plain that further demands would be made on the players until
the club had reached safety.
''This is only one stepping stone,'' said Aitken after the game.
''It is just the first of the victories we need to make sure we remain
in the premier division.
''I said after the Rangers game at Ibrox that we needed a high
percentage of wins in our last five games. We have started with one and
now we have to aim for more.
''I felt that we were due to get a result after the way we have been
playing.
''Our performances in our last three games against Hibs, Kilmarnock,
and Rangers deserved more than the single point we eventually gained.
''It is a question now of maintaining that level of performance.
''I have set no targets for the team -- mainly because this is the
first time we have had the three-points-for-a-win situation in Scotland
and there are no guidelines as to a total which would guarantee you
safety.
''What we have to do is keep winning. This, hopefully, is the start .
. .''
At least Aberdeen were scoring goals again, and they came against a
team who had defied all their goal afforts in five previous meetings
this season.
Duncan Shearer snapped up the first of the game in 30 minutes, and
four minutes before half-time defender Brian Irvine scored the second.
That goal brought Irvine an individual salute from Aitken, who,
earlier, had refused to pick out certain players for praise.
''It is a team effort,'' he maintained, but added,''still, Brian
Irvine does deserve a special mention.
''He was outstanding today and he scored a tremendous goal.
''He has been a bit down because he has been out of the team and it
was lunchtime before he knew he was playing. But his attitude was great.
Brian was in because John Inglis failed a fitness test, but he showed
the qualities we need right now.''
Celtic were a disappointment -- a shadow of the side which defeated
Hibs in the Scottish Cup semi-final.
Indeed, they did not come close to matching the form they showed in
the two semi-finals.
There was none of the flowing football, none of the confident, assured
defending, and not the slightest sign of a goal threat from a team who,
after all, must be looking towards Europe from both second spot in the
premier division and victory in the Scottish Cup.
Team boss Tommy Burns was quick to identify the reaction his team had
suffered from their two demanding games with Hibs.
''We were far too slack in our approach today,'' he observed. ''The
players were obviously feeling the effects of the two cup games.
''Aberdeen worked very hard for their victory and there was more life
about them.
''We have to get ourselves rested and back on form for our game on
Wednesday against Hearts.''
It is very much in the minds of Celtic's players how Old Firm rivals
Rangers limped towards last season's final, did not regain their form,
and on the day consequently lost to Dundee United.
After this disappointment midfielder Peter Grant stressed: ''The
manager will make certain that everyone performs.
''If we don't, then we will be out of the team.
''He has shown this year already that he will leave players out.
''If that happens now, then it could mean missing the final. No-one
wants even to contemplate that.''
The tightness of the premier division -- apart from runaway Rangers --
was emphasised by Celtic's sudden slide into the bottom half thanks to
this result and other teams' victories.
They do have games in hand which may still give them second place and
that extra chance of Europe.
Poor Aberdeen don't have that luxury.
That's why they must maintain their revival at Fir Park tomorrow, or
else find all the good work of Saturday undone.

RANGERS manager Walter Smith took time off from his seventh successive
title celebrations yesterday to take a swipe at the merchants of doom of
the Scottish game.
Said Smith: ''I feel aggrieved at times that this club is not given
credit for what we are trying to achieve here. We are attracting almost
full houses to our home games and are trying to bring good quality
players to the club, the kind of players that people want to watch.
''Yet we are dragged into this talk about a country in crisis. I don't
think it's fair. It certainly does not reflect what we are doing at
Ibrox.''
Earlier, Smith had saluted his players for their achievement and
stressed: ''I don't want to go into speculation about players who might
be coming here at this moment. It is more important to thank the players
who have won another title.
''There are some who have been the backbone of what has been a very
difficult season for the club. There have been tremendous contributions
from Richard Gough, David Robertson, Stuart McCall, Brian Laudrup, Mark
Hateley and, earlier in the season, Andy Goram.
''We have also seen two young players, Charlie Miller and Craig Moore
come into the team and play 20-odd games each and handle the situation
well.
''It was a difficult season because we had so many injuries but I
think we won this championship during November and December when we put
together a string of important results.
''After the new year, we ran into injuries and, obviously, that
affected us. But the players did extremely well and the team deserves
great credit for the way they performed.
''Every year we have won the title, my admiration for what Celtic
achieved in going nine years in a row grows.
''It was a tremendous achievement and all we can do is hope that we
can match or maybe beat it.''
Later, Gough turned to the same subject and insisted: ''I think you
have to examine the two achievements. Obviously, nine titles in
succession was a marvellous thing for Celtic -- but that was in the old
first division.
''This time you are looking at seven premier division titles in
succession. In my view there is a big difference and I think it is a
record that will last a very long time.
''I think the manager has made an enormous contribution, first as the
man who backed Graeme Souness, and then in his own right.
''As far as I'm concerned he's always been my guiding light since I
arrived here as a 17-year-old from South Africa.
''I was fortunate that he was at Tannadice when I started.''
Laudrup, the man who has made such an enormous contribution to this
title victory added: ''I know that this is the seventh championship for
Rangers, but, for me, winning a title is always a special feeling.
''Some people said to me it would be easy because Rangers are always
winning but it has not been as easy as people said.
''Other teams want to win the championship, other teams mount their
own challenges, and each year I think it becomes more difficult.
''I am just happy that this is one of the targets I set for myself and
it has been achieved.
''The manager allowed me a free role to demonstrate my skills and that
was a major factor in the way I have played this season.''
Hibs manager Alex Miller said: ''Rangers obviously had most of the
game but with six minutes left I thought we might still get a point. Jim
Leighton had some magnificent saves in that second half.''
Smith, too, praised Leighton. He pointed out: ''Leighton had a couple
of fabulous saves. There was one from Alan McLaren in the first half and
another from Alexi Mikhailichenko after half time.
''I would have been very disappointed, however, if we had not won. We
certainly played well enough to get a result even though it arrived
late.''

RANGERS, who have been linked with Dutch international striker Dennis
Bergkamp, won't be bringing him to Ibrox next season, writes Ken
Gallacher.
Suggestions were that Bergkamp would make the move to Glasgow for #7m
after a season of discontent in Italy with Inter Milan.
But last night his agent, Rob Jansen, said: ''Dennis will be staying
with Inter next season.''
Jansen returned to Holland at the weekend after a week spent in
negotiations with Inter officials. The result of these talks is that
Bergkamp will continue his career with the Italian giants.
Said Jansen: ''It was a big decision for Dennis to make. It has not
been the best season for him.
''But now we have had long talks with Inter and we know what will be
happening at the club and we know that Dennis will be happier. He has
decided that he will remain there.''
One Dutch internationalist who will be moving from Inter is midfielder
Wim Jonk, who also has been unsettled for the past year.
Meanwhile, Rangers chairman David Murray last night admitted players
like Bergkamp and Swede Jesper Blomqvist are the type he wants to bring
to Ibrox this summer.
Murray said: ''The type of money being talked about being spent on
players will be spent. And the calibre of player being mentioned is
correct.
''The mood we are in I wouldn't rule out anybody being at Ibrox in the
future.''

Rangers 3, Hibernian 1
NOTHING, but nothing, could spoil the Ibrox party yesterday -- not
even an inspired goalkeeping display from Hibs veteran Jim Leighton.
The 36-year-old born-again Scotland keeper did his best to wreck the
celebrations for the seventh title win in succession, and, at the same
time, keep his own side on target for a European place.
But, in the end, after a string of superb saves, even Leighton had to
admit defeat.
Twice, as the game moved into its closing stages, Rangers struck and
the victory their fans wanted so desperately to celebrate along with
that seventh title was secured.
In 85 minutes, it was the Ibrox supporters' favourite son, Ian
Durrant, who snatched the so-important second goal.
Then, to give Rangers a winning margin which more clearly reflected
their domination of this game, Alexei Mikhailichenko added that third
just two minutes later.
Until those closing minutes Leighton had stood between Rangers and
what could have been the biggest victory of the season for them.
For, after the champions had given glimpses of their best form against
Aberdeen, this follow-up against Hibs saw them deliver a performance of
style and class, one worthy of champions.
Once again, Brian Laudrup was the architect of their main moves, and
once again the man the opposition simply could not stop.
Time after time he eased his way beyond the despairing, desperate
tackles of a succession of Hibs defenders.
Time after time he carved out openings for the Ibrox strike force.
And time after time the 44,193 crowd watched admiringly as Leighton
stopped the goal attempts.
It was an incredible display from the veteran, one which must stand
out as one of his best ever.
In the end, it was of no help. Because, in the end, Rangers won as
they wanted to, with that extra dash of flair and imagination.
Even the one hiccup in their afternoon of eventual triumph -- that
Hibs goal -- arrived after a bizarre decision from referee Willie Young
of Clarkston.
By then Hibs were a goal down after Laudrup -- who else? -- had curled
in a cross from the left which Mark Hateley touched on and Gordon Durie
finished with a powerful header which even Leighton could not stop.
Hibs were really trying to stem the tide. Alan McLaren had a shot
pushed away by Leighton, Hateley headed over the bar and then Alex
Cleland saw his drive touched against the post by the keeper.
Then in that thirty-eighth minute came the referee's mistake. Cleland
went down injured near the touchline, and as the ball ran out for a Hibs
throw-in, Rangers physio Gordon Allison went on to the field to give the
player treatment.
Hibs took the throw, and the referee allowed play to go on with the
physio still on the park. Rangers were caught in their one unguarded
moment of that first half and gave away a foul on the edge of the box.
They protested, but the referee waved them away, Darren Jackson
slipped the ball to Michael O'Neill and he shot past Billy Thomson from
25 yards.
Before half-time O'Neill cleared a Richard Gough header off the Hibs
line as Rangers still moved forward.
Then, in the second half, the champions lost their rhythm. By now John
Brown had gone off to be replaced by Neil Murray and Gordon Durie had
not reappeared for the second half, allowing Mikhailichenko to come on.
Hibs, though, could not capitalise on some of the uncertainties which
appeared.
And soon it was the same script as before.
Leighton stopped a Trevor Steven shot and then he made a save from
Mikhailichenko, another from Gough, another from Hateley and then, to
cap them all, a brave double save from first Charlie Miller and then
Hateley after more Laudrup magic.
The break, however, had to come and the fans roared their acclaim when
Durrant was the man who scored the second goal to push Rangers back in
front.
He played a one-two with Charlie Miller before stabbing a low shot
past Leighton.
Two minutes later the third goal arrived. Laudrup began the move again
and the ball reached Mikhailichenko who wrong-footed the Hibs defence
before slamming a shot out of Leighton's reach.
It was the ending the Rangers fans had wanted and how they celebrated.
There were just three bookings in the game, all Hibs players, David
Farrell for a foul on Charlie Miller, and Pat McGinlay and then Michael
O'Neill, both for fouls on Trevor Steven.

ALAN McManus, credited with discovering John Higgins long before the
teenager became a practice partner of Stephen Hendry, did not let their
friendship get in the way yesterday when the two Scots met in the first
round of the Embassy World Championship in Sheffield.
Higgins may be 6-1 second favourite to win the title but McManus -- a
25-1 shot this year -- will resume this morning with a 6-3 lead,
requiring just four more frames to reach the second round, whereas his
19-year-old rival needs seven out of 10 possible frames.
There were only brief glimpses of the form that has brought Higgins
three ranking titles and two other finals in six months. His best break
was the 75 in frame eight which reduced his arrears to 5-3.
World No.6 McManus was never headed after having taken the opening
frame with a run of 44. He went on to add breaks of 37, 99, and 58 as he
put himself in pole position for the last 16. He moved from 1-1 to 4-1
ahead, and, crucially, he won the seventh frame on the black by a single
point to lead 5-2 instead of just 4-3.
Although McManus has been out of form, he has plenty of motivation to
win this contest against his young friend. With Jimmy White, Darren
Morgan, and Peter Ebdon all in a position to overtake him in the world
rankings depending on how they fare at Sheffield, McManus is determined
to retain his place in the top eight.
White put his off-table worries behind him to get his campaign off to
an encouraging start by concluding a 10-2 first-round victory over South
African Peter Francisco yesterday.
But despite the scoreline and the occasional spectacular pot or
brilliant positional shot, it was not vintage White.
His best effort was just 68 in the third frame during Saturday's
opening session, during which he built up an overnight 7-2 lead over the
world No.61.
The sport's authorities revealed later that White and Francisco face a
top-level inquiry after match-rigging allegations rocked the
championship.
Betting was suspended before the start of their match on Saturday
after large wagers had been placed on a 10-2 scoreline.
Sauchie's Billy Snaddon last night began his contest with Derby's
David Roe, the prize being a second-round tie against White. After Roe
had taken the first frame, the next three were close-run affairs, with
the Scot taking two of them to level up at 2-2 by the interval.
Roe eased ahead again but Snaddon fought back to get his nose in front
at 4-3. However, the Derby player responded to take a 5-4 lead into this
afternoon's second session.
Meanwhile, teenager Ronnie O'Sullivan launched his campaign with an
emphatic 10-3 win over Dave Harold after having led 7-2 overnight.
Veteran Terry Griffiths is well accustomed to marathon affairs and
that experience stood him in good stead against French-Canadian Alain
Robidoux. Their protracted morning session was adjourned two frames
early, with the Welshman trailing 4-3.
But the 1979 world champion rallied to lead 5-4 and, from 6-5 behind,
reeled off the next five frames for a 10-6 win. Weekend results and
positions (all first-round matches):
T Drago (Malta) beat P Cavney (England) 10-2; M Davis (England) beat K
