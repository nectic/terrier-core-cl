THE CLASH of claymores and the skirl of the pipes are echoing in
cinemas throughout the land, as Liam Neeson struts his tartan stuff in
Rob Roy.
Maybe you have seen the movie and bought the T-shirt? Well, now you
can buy the house where the production was conceived. You could even sit
at the kitchen table where the screenplay was roughed out!
Balfron is a long way from Hollywood, but Orchardfield House, which
stands in the centre of the village under the Campsies, played a
starring role in the production of Tinseltown's latest haggis western.
The house is owned by the film's producer, Peter Broughan, who is now
moving to the USA to further his career.
Although the house has strong links with the modern version of Rob
Roy's life, it can also claim a more traditional association.
Local legend has it that the old reiver and rustler himself hid from
the Marquis of Montrose's men in the Clachan Oak Tree, which is opposite
the property.
The story goes that a poor widow in the village of Balfron was
threatened with eviction by the heartless Marquis. She asked Rob Roy for
help and the big-hearted brigand gave her enough money to clear her
debt.
But being a thrifty sort of thief he then hid with his retainers in
the oak tree. As soon as she had paid the Marquis's bailiffs, Rob and
his band of outlaws jumped out and, after a fierce tussle, wrested their
money back.
Traditional memories seem to go back a long way in Balfron, it is also
said that William Wallace hid in the same tree. Perhaps the heroes will
meet in the same cinema one day.
Balfron takes its trees seriously, the wonderful old ash tree which
also stands close to the house is thought to have been planted to
commemorate the Covenanter's victory at the battle of Drumclog in 1679.
Formerly called Orchardlands, Orchardfield House is a B-Listed
property which dates back to the early 18th century and has been
recently restored to its original Georgian design. The curved stone
staircase, with its cast iron baluster and mahogany hand rail, is
mentioned in local guidebooks.
The house stands in about one-third of an acre, adjacent to Balfron
Church. Accommodation comprises: reception hall, dining room, formal
drawing room, two bedrooms (each with en-suite bathroom).
The country-style kitchen has a stone floor, an Aga, and that
screenwriter's table (it has not been included in the sale price, but it
seems unlikely that Peter Broughan will want to take his kitchen table
to Hollywood).
Orchardfield House is being marketed by Slater Hogg &amp; Howison at
offers over #145,000.

<HEADLINE>Pattullo happy with devolution assurances.  Bank of Scotland sees stable growth</HEADLINE>

BANK of Scotland Governor Sir Bruce Pattullo has secured assurances
from senior Labour politicians that devolution will not result in
changes to UK banking supervision or financial regulation.
Writing in the group's tercentenary report and accounts, published
yesterday, Sir Bruce adds that he is encouraged by the politicians'
recognition that rates of corporation tax need to be the same throughout
the UK.
On the state of the economy, Sir Bruce says the current cycle, for the
moment at least, does not appear to have the unattractive features which
have characterised earlier recovery phases.
Sir Bruce contrasts the buoyancy of exports and certain manufacturing
sectors with the subdued state of the consumer sector and housing
market.
Runaway consumer spending, last seen during the ''Yuppie'' years of
the late-eighties, has been notably absent this time round.
However, pointing out that rising input prices have so far been
largely absorbed because of the willingness of manufacturers to accept
lower margins, Sir Bruce stresses the importance of remaining wary.
Acceptance of lower margins, he says, has been enabled by growing
order books, subdued wage demands and productivity gains.
Bank of Scotland points out that UK output is now higher than it was
immediately prior to the bitter recession which began in 1990.
The bank believes this implies the UK may have entered a new, more
stable period of economic growth.
Touching on the continuing insecurity of consumers, Sir Bruce believes
commentators may have underestimated significantly the time the
electorate needs to adjust from double-digit annual rises in wages and
house prices to a relatively low-inflation culture.
Returning to devolution, Sir Bruce raised this issue publicly with
financial services' umbrella group Scottish Financial Enterprise in
November.
He was anxious to encourage meaningful dialogue between those
considering draft legislation and all sectors of the business community
to avoid any unnecessary uncertainty.
Stressing Bank of Scotland's political neutrality, Sir Bruce said
ill-thought-out change created uncertainty and was anathema to financial
markets. However, he appears happy with Labour politicians' assurances
that devolution will produce no major shock waves for the Scottish
financial community.
With a Scottish Assembly likely if Labour wins the next general
election, Sir Bruce points out that a recurrent theme in the history of
Bank of Scotland has been its flexibility and pragmatism in adapting to
economic or constitutional change.
The accounts reveal that Sir Bruce received total emoluments of
#377,000 in the year to end-February, an increase of 16% on the previous
12 months.
Total directors' emoluments were up 9% at #880,000.
Last month, Bank of Scotland celebrated its 300th anniversary with an
increase in operating profits which the English clearers failed to
achieve and posted record annual pre-tax earnings of #450m, an increase
of two-thirds on the previous year.
Meanwhile, at an extraordinary general meeting immediately after its
annual meeting in Edinburgh on June 20, Bank of Scotland will tighten
the rules of its executive share option scheme.
Directors will only be allowed to exercise options if the percentage
increase in Bank of Scotland's earnings per share exceeds that in the
retail price index by not less than a specified margin.
In imposing this condition, the bank's remuneration committee has
heeded the guidance of the investment committees of the Association of
British Insurers and of the National Association of Pension Funds,
contained in a joint statement published nearly two years ago.

The body of a 13-year-old girl who vanished two weeks ago has been
found in a ditch, police said yesterday. Danielle Gratton left her home
in Arkeley Road, Hall Green, Birmingham, on May 16 following a row with
her parents.
It was understood that she had a bottle of anti-depressant tablets at
the time. Her body was discovered on Sunday, several hundred yards from
her home. A post-mortem has been held and West Midlands police said
there were no suspicious circumstances.

THE market signalled its pleasure with the package from international
support services group BET yesterday by lifting the shares 6p to
126[1/2]p where they stand just below their high for the year.
Profits for the 12 months to April 1, 1995, emerge 22% higher from
#91m to #111m, ahead of expectations. But the company also revealed that
it was paying #70m for Style Conference, the largest provider of
specialist conference and training centres in the UK, a deal which also
met with market approval.
To top it off, shareholders get a 23% increase in the dividend total
from 3.25p to 4p with payment of a 2.8p final.
BET chief executive John Clark reports that BET has increased its
productivity with the group's return on sales rising by 19% to 6.7%
against a background of continuing competitive pressures. The
longer-term goal is to be a growth company and under the chief executive
BET is certainly moving in this direction.
Since he joined the company in 1991 there have been a series of
disposals and rationalisations to undo the damage inflicted in the 1980s
when the company overstretched itself through acquisitions.
Revenues from continuing operations, though, are flat and profit
growth is coming primarily from cost control. However, Mr Clark stresses
that now that the four business areas, into which the 58 product line
service companies are grouped, are reorganised, cost efficient and
increasingly industry segment focused, BET can take its strong cashflow
and debt-free balance sheet and begin to fund bolt-on and new product
line acquisitional growth.
BET is paying #54m in cash from its own resources for Style and the
balance by the issue of 14,260,250 BET Ordinary shares which will not
rank for the final dividend.
Conference Holdings, Style's holding company, made profits before tax
of #6.8m in the accounts to March 31, 1995, with net assets #40.3m.
Group operating profit was #8.2m. Style has enjoyed steady expansion
from a single site operation in 1979 to its current leading position
with 18 facilities in the UK employing over a 1000 people.
The company provides a complete service, including technical support,
catering, cleaning, security, hospitality and premises management.
Clients include substantial, blue-chip UK and international companies
and Government organisations, many of which have long-term contracts.
At its present share level, BET is selling at around 12 times
earnings. The market will be watching to see if the company can deliver
the goods with genuine business growth from its continuing operations.

A full-throttle assault on flexibility impresses Ross Finlay.
TAKEN for granted and rarely hitting the headlines, the Volvo 400
series may be about to lose its coupe model, but the 440 hatchback and
460 saloon continue with steady updates. Some people undoubtedly regard
these as pretty dull cars, but they have many practical features, a
sensible interior layout, and an unusual pick-and-mix marketing
approach.
The Dutch-built 400s are heirs of the 1974 takeover when Volvo bought
the failing DAF factory at Born near Maastricht, to move into smaller
cars than it produces at home. Although their build quality has never
exactly paralleled that of the Swedish models, the examples in the
showrooms just now are well up to the mark and, with the latest
front-end treatment, the best looking of the line.
There is no strict catalogue list of which engine sizes are available
with which levels of equipment and trim. Volvo offers five different
petrol engines and a 1.9-litre turbo diesel. Trim and equipment levels
run from the anonymous base model via S, Si, SE and the sporty GLT to
the more luxurious CD. At prices from #11,150 to #16,650 you can have
any engine with any equipment level, with the sole exception that the CD
trim cannot be ordered with the turbo diesel engine. Saloons and
hatchbacks cost the same, and recent specification improvements include
alarms and immobilisers.
Quoted prices all include a sunroof. But you can trim #400 off by
doing without one. On the other hand, there is a special offer on petrol
models till August by which you can pay the sunroof-inclusive price, add
a #100 premium, forget the sunroof but take air conditioning instead,
with alloy wheels flung in as a slightly irrelevant extra.
For a mixture of performance with economy, the turbo diesel, in five
trim levels at prices from #11,950 to #15,100, is the car to go for. The
engine peaks at 89bhp, the usual formidable TD torque curve provides
strong pulling power at medium revs, and the Volvo will reach 60mph in
12 seconds on the way to a test track maximum around 110mph.
These are competitive performance figures for the class, and the TD is
right up with the leading group when it comes to fuel consumption. You
can expect something like 64mpg at a steady 56mph, 44 at 75 and 37mpg in
city traffic. I did not notice any Volvo response to a recent press
claim that diesel engines do not come with catalytic converters, but the
400 turbo diesel certainly does. You have to watch that, while the
service intervals are at 10,000 miles, the engine needs an oil change
every 5000.
One strong point of the 400 is that, although the cabin is rather
gloomily coloured, especially around the fascia, it provides much more
commodious passenger space than a first glance suggests. Rear seat
headroom and legroom are much better than the class average. Boot
capacity is fair, over quite a high sill.
The 440 and 460 offer a good driving position in front of a fascia
which is beginning to look old-fashioned, although the instrument panel
is well recessed to keep night-time reflections away from the screen.
There is a curious mixture of push, turn and flick-on switches.
At start-up the turbo diesel engine goes into a rather throbby
tickover, and the car's combination of engine characteristics and
gearing mean that it can feel quite lumpish at low revs. This is not a
diesel to waft along in top gear on the famous whiff of throttle in town
traffic.
Elsewhere, though, it is a different matter altogether. The 400 digs
deep into its reserves of torque and accelerates smartly as well as
holding a comfortable motorway cruising speed. Anybody trying to blast
past a 400 out on the open road, expecting from all the hackneyed jokes
about Volvo drivers that it will simply lumber along, could be in for an
embarrassing surprise.

THE windswept Orkney islands do not come automatically to mind as a
location for soft fruit but one couple, on the island of Rousay, have
just converted their whole enterprise into strawberry production.
Chris and Marion Clark set up Rousay Growers in 1981, using
polytunnels to grow strawberries and vegetables which they sold to
independent retailers, local hotels and restaurants. Another outlet was
their own shop, the only one on Rousay.
Now, with the help of Orkney Enterprise and support from the Scottish
Office, they are moving completely into strawberry production.
Mr Clark said: ''Contrary to what people may think, Orkney is a good
place to grow strawberries. Our harvesting season runs from the end of
May to about the beginning of September. With relatively mild winters
and little fear of late frosts the plants benefit from long daylight
hours.''
The Clarks grow their strawberries in buckets suspended on timber
frames in polytunnels which measure 66ft by 14ft. The eight polytunnels
can each take 330 buckets and give protection against the worst problems
posed by the winds.
''Given the good inter-island ferry services run by the council our
produce can reach most parts of Orkney within 24 hours,'' said Mr Clark.
So far all of the strawberry crop has been sold locally, with demand
expanding in line with production. This year, if there is a surplus, Mr
Clark hopes to begin exporting to the mainland.

<HEADLINE>MLC aims to put red meat back on nation's diet.  #27m marketing exercise launched</HEADLINE>

THE major fightback against the vegetarian and animal transport
lobbies, which many farmers have been calling for, has been launched by
the Meat and Livestock Commission as part of a #27m marketing exercise
designed to ensure the place of red meat in the nation's diet.
''It is becoming very unfashionable to smoke,'' said Alistair
Donaldson, the MLC's general manager in Scotland. ''We have to ensure
that it does not become unfashionable to eat red meat.''
The MLC's campaign is based on a broad front and is designed to
promote the benefits of meat rather than attack those who declare their
preference for an alternative. There have been repeated calls from meat
producers for action to counter what was seen as a dangerous drift
towards vegetarianism. Mr Donaldson pointed out yesterday however, that
vegetarians accounted for only 3% of the population.
A bigger threat would appear to be posed by the poultry industry with
chicken, in one survey, being the choice of 80% of housewives. Red meat
came way down the list, and lamb, in particular, was at the bottom of
the heap with only 10% preference.
There were many factors which now had to be taken into account, said
Mr Donaldson. Fifty per cent of the workforce in Britain was female,
which meant that they were unlikely to feel like spending two hours
preparing a meal when they got home in the evening. The whole family
rarely sat down together for a meal and 27% of the meat consumed was
eaten outside the home.
It had also been established that 50% of men over the age of 55 were
not working -- either through redundancy, retiral or unemployment.
Thirty per cent of that group were doing the family shopping and their
shopping patterns were different from women.
Part one of the campaign to promote meat was the highly-successful
Recipe for Love series of television advertisements, which will continue
this year. That came under the heading of reassurance -- making the
customer feel that meat eating was perfectly acceptable.
The next step, which will include major press advertising this autumn,
will be aimed at delivering some rational messages, including the fact
that lean red meat is a good source of iron and forms an important part
of a healthy balanced diet.
On the issue of fat the commission is anxious to establish that eating
less fat does not necessarily mean eating less meat. Last year, in fact,
saw a 1% increase in meat consumption. ''We are not an industry in
decline, we are an industry which is broadly stable,'' said Mr
Donaldson.
The commission has recognised the importance of getting the meat
message over to young people and is increasing its team of regional home
economists from eight to 12. Their responsibilities include working with
schools, teachers and students, particularly through home economics
departments and food technology projects.
''One of our problems is that there is less cooking being done in
schools,'' said home economist Elaine Brown. ''In England they do not
have to teach any food at all in the curriculum. In Scotland, at least,
pupils are still taught some form of home economics in the first two
years at secondary school.''
Most of the material which the commission provided for use in Scottish
schools had been specifically developed for the Scottish situation,''
she said.

BURN Stewart Distillers yesterday announced a joint venture with a
Bombay firm that will give it a toehold in the potentially huge Indian
whisky market.
Managing director Ian Bankier said Burn Stewart would start shipping
malt whisky in bulk to its Indian partner Maharashtra Manufacturing
Corporation in September or October.
This would be blended with locally-produced grain spirit and bottled
for sale in the Bombay area under brand names which had yet to be
chosen.
Mr Bankier said turnover would initially be small since Indian
regulations currently limit whisky imports to a maximum of 35,000 cases
a year per supplier.
''What we hope for is further liberalisation of the local Indian
market,'' he said, stressing that the long-term potential was immense.

WITH the volume of private lets reducing over the years, the amount of
business being carried out via company links is increasing
correspondingly.
''From an agency point of view, that can be better,'' says Gordon
Shields. ''There can be less hassle, or possibility of problems
unresolved. But with the increase in business, and full acceptability in
social terms, agencies certainly have to keep up to standard now.
''We started about 16 years ago, in Milngavie, and it's interesting
that our original property, in Bardowie, is still on our books, and
remains popular. The private sector still plays an important part.''
The economic situation in the south is also a continuing factor in
residential letting. With a combination of recession in the home
counties, and job moves to Glasgow or the west of Scotland, failure to
sell the family home has meant changing to a system of renting.
''Some people are still caught in that trap,'' says Shields, ''and I
think possibly some people coming north thought they might make a kind
of killing here. But property values are good in this part of the
country. There are no rock-bottom prices. Fair prices, yes.''
He also finds people looking for short lets, perhaps three months,
while seeking a house to buy. The let is extended, and again. They might
even end up buying the house they have been letting.
''We deal largely with the greater Glasgow area, and I have to admit
there are some people who don't seem to reckon Glasgow. They've heard
about it and don't really want to come. But when they do, they like it;
the lease gets extended; and they end up staying. It happens
regularly.''
If a luxury flat in Bearsden is typical, it's understandable why
necomers should be delighted. This one is a new development, fully
furnished, with three bedrooms including one en suite. Lounge, dining
room, breakfasting kitchen, bathroom with shower. Gas-fired central
heating. And access to a leisure complex with pool, sauna, spa, fitness
multi-gym. All-inclusive at #1500 a month.
Or the interest might be in a detached villa at Drymen. It has a
lounge, dining room five bedrooms, bathroom, shower room and en suite
shower room; breakfasting kitchen, utility room, central heating, and a
garage. Pleasantly in the country, yet not far from town -- #1000 a
month.
Kirkintilloch has its own charm. A modern ranch-style cul-de-sac
bungalow comes with four bedrooms, master with en suite shower room;
breakfasting kitchen, lounge, dining room, living room, utility room.
Plus bathroom, cloakroom, gas central heating and garage. Going for
#850.
Or across to Renfrew, where a detached villa in a modern estate is
offered at #700 a month -- for lounge/dining room, three bedrooms --
master with en suite shower room -- plus bathroom and shower,
breakfasting kitchen, gas central heating, and garage.
Back in town, a single-bedroom ground-floor flat is on offer in
Hyndland at #450 a month. It provides a lounge, breakfasting kitchen,
bathroom, gas-fired central heating -- and it's handy for rail and other
amenities.

ALTHOUGH not so pronounced, bank mortgage lending figures for April
follow the same pattern as those of the building societies which showed
the first year-on-year decline in mortgage lending since August 1993.
The housing market remains depressed against the background of
interest rate fears. And the Government's plans to reduce income support
for mortgage interest, due to be implemented this October, has certainly
not helped sentiment.
Yesterday the British Bankers' Association reported an 11% drop in
gross loans in April to #1288m compared to March. A similar-sized fall
also took place last year but this series is still too short for
seasonal adjustment.
Figures for net lending, which are seasonally adjusted, showed a
smaller decline from #554m in March to #521m in April. There was a
steeper fall in new approvals from 29,629 valued at #1510m in March, to
22,386 valued at #1118m in April.

MONKS Investment Trust failed to take advantage of rising markets in
the US last year and was caught out by sinking share prices in the Far
East.
Net asset value fell 3.6% during the year to April 30, compared with a
rise of 0.7% in the FT Actuaries World Index in sterling terms over the
same period.
Despite these setbacks, the trust managed by Baillie Gifford of
Edinburgh proposed a 7.1% rise in the full-year dividend to 7.5p, with a
final payout of 5.5p. This was amply covered by a rise in earnings per
share to 10.8p from 7.6p previously.
The trust borrowed #100m in October for an investment in gilts on
which it had so far made a profit of about #6m, he noted.
Monks Investment Trust had total assets of #442.4m at the end of
April, of which 58.2% was tied up in UK shares and bonds.
A further 17.3% was invested in Australia, Japan and the Far East and
14.5% in Continental Europe. But only 3.7% of the trust's portfolio was
placed in the Americas.

FUND management group Aberdeen Trust, hit by the fragility of world
stock markets and dollar weakness, suffered a 22% decline in interim
pre-tax profits to #2.75m.
During the six months to end-March, funds under management rose
slightly from #2323m to #2496m, with the addition of #240m of funds in
December from the purchase of the unit trust side of Prosperity Life
having countered the effect of declining markets.
However, welcoming the improvement in equity prices since the year-end
and believing itself well-placed to benefit from any sustained recovery,
Aberdeen Trust raised its interim dividend by 8.3% to 0.7p.

THE share strength column in yesterday's Herald erroneously showed a
28.4% decline in the yield of Macfarlane (Clansman) shares during the
year to date. In fact, the shares showed a positive yield of 7.6% during
this period.
Macfarlane shares fell to 184p on May 26 from           257p on
December 30 as indicated. But the yield calculation published did not
take into account a scrip issue of one new share for every two held on
May 23 to capitalise #10.1m of reserves.
The scrip issue increased the number of Macfarlane shares in
circulation by a third without bringing fresh funds into the company. A
sharp fall in the share price immediately afterwards reflected this
change.

SCOTLAND'S stock may not be all that high in the current football
scheme of things, but the ability of this wee country to find managers
who can do a big job remains as impressive as ever.
Kenny Dalglish has been the most spectacularly successful example this
season in England, lifting the Premiership title to add to the many
successes he had with Liverpool, Alex Ferguson has already become a cult
figure after his remarkable turnaround of Manchester United.
Mark McGhee may have been captured by Leicester City too late to save
their place in the top division, but he had previously done a great job
with Reading.
George Graham was a big favourite at Highbury, where he had become the
most successful manager of that club ever, until he was sacked amid
''bung'' allegations earlier this year.
Now, Bruce Rioch, the man with the deep south accent who was once
captain of Scotland, is hotly tipped to become Graham's successor at
Highbury, where the stand-in manager, Stewart Houston, who did a decent
job in difficult circumstances, also happens to be a Scot.
Rioch has just guided Bolton Wanderers back to the top league after a
15-year absence following a remarkable 4-3 win over McGhee's old team,
Reading, in the first division play-off at Wembley on Monday, but with
Manchester City chairman Francis Lee, as well as Arsenal, looking
enviously at his talents, another change of employer appears to be on
the cards.
He and his assistant, Colin Todd, have not moved their homes or
families north since they took charge of the Lancashire side, and Rioch,
who was born in Aldershot but is proud of his Scottish ancestry, said
yesterday: ''I have things to decide and family matters will come into
consideration, but now is not the time for me to be discussing that.''
Rioch has been living in Bolton while his family remained in Harpenden
during the three years of his contract, which ends next month. The
former manager of Torquay, Millwall, and Middlesbrough, who has property
interests in the south, added: ''I do not want to take away the focus
from what's been achieved at Bolton by talking about my own situation at
this point.''
Earlier in the week he outlined his personal difficulties when he
pointed out that his son had just been released by Luton Town, his
parents in Harpenden needed looking after, and his daughter-in-law was
expecting twins.
In light of that lot, the pleas from fans and players to stay may not
be a priority in his life. The fact that Bolton are struggling through
red tape to build a new #40m stadium on the outskirts of the town will
not help matters. However, team captain Alan Stubbs, made plain his own
feelings about the speculation surrounding the manager. He is desperate
for Rioch to stay.
The #3m-rated defender, who was interesting Liverpool when he signed a
new contract earlier this season, admitted: ''I probably would not have
signed that deal had it not been for Bruce. If you ask any player they
will say they want him to stay.''
Todd, Rioch's right-hand man who would almost certainly be part of any
move by the manager, said yesterday: ''I would probably like Bruce to
stay here, but if a big club came in he would find it difficult to
refuse.''
But Stubbs, while appreciating the situation in which the manager
might find himself, believes the club ought to try all it can to keep
him. ''All the talk about him leaving certainly overshadowed the
build-up to the Wembley game but in the end we were strong enough not to
let it affect us.
''Even when we were two goals down we never lost faith in our ability
to come back. The crowd were marvellous and the longer it went on the
stronger we got.
''We've everything in front of us now but will just have to wait and
see what happens.''
Arsenal refused to be drawn into the speculation yesterday, none the
less. Their managing director, Ken Friar, insisted there would be no
imminent appointment.
Meanwhile, Bolton will play Dundee in a a pre-season friendly at Dens
Park on Wednesday, August 2.
Dundee will meet the Premiership newcomers four days before they play
Dundee United in Dave Bowman's testimonial match at Tannadice.

SCOTLAND will put the final touches to their preparations for next
month's finals of the European Women's Nations Hockey Cup in Amsterdam
when they meet England in a double-header this weekend at Lilleshall.
However, coach Neil Menzies has had to call up replacements for Tracey
Robb, Alison Denholm, Susan MacDonald, Ann Menzies, and Wendy Fraser,
who will will all be playing for Western Klick Photopoint in the finals
of the European Club championship in Holland.
There will, however, be only one uncapped player among the
replacements. Morven McLeod's selection is undoubtedly recognition not
only of her outstanding season but that of her club, Hyndland, who
during the league campaign held both champions Western and runners-up
Bonagrass Grove to draws.
Recalled are Fiona MacInnes and Louise Burton, who at the start of
Scotland's build-up looked destined to secure places in the squad, Nikki
Klepplang, a debutant in Scotland's Four Nations triumph in Cardiff
earlier this month, and Val Neil, who has been overlooked since making
her debut in the Four Nations tournament in Germany last summer. Squad:
S Lawrie (Boroughmuir), C Corcoran, J Jack, J Messenger, D Renilson, R
Simpson, H Walker, L Burton, F MacInnes (all Edinburgh Ladies), S
Gilmour (Heriot Watt University), S Fraser, A Ramsay, N Klepplang, P
Robertson, captain (all Bonagrass Grove), M McLeod (Hyndland), V Neil
(Royal High Gymnasts).

STILL embroiled in the controversy surrounding his behaviour at last
month's European championships, Scottish No.2 Martin Heath aims to make
more positive headlines this week in the prestigious Tournament of
Champions in New York.
The 22-year-old from Oban is confident he can survive two rounds of
qualifying to make Saturday's main draw. ''This is the big one for me,''
he confirmed. ''I'm 33 in the world, and I need to rise to around 29 in
the July rankings to gain automatic entry to the lucrative Asian
tournaments next season.''
It was Heath's poor performances -- and his refusal to play in one
match -- that sparked the possibility of him being disciplined following
last month's European championships in Amsterdam.
He has outlined the case for his defence to Scottish officials and,
while not wanting to go public at this stage, strongly refutes any
suggestions that he failed to give his all.
''I had played nine tournaments in a row and had done better than
expected in several of them,'' he explained. ''I was totally exhausted
when I arrived at the Europeans, and I think I just pushed myself over
the edge. Now I just want to clear my name.''
After New York, he will head for a tournament in Jamaica, before
returning to start the summer training grind in preparation for the new
season.

EARLIER this year Mikael Tillstrom considered giving up tennis, but
after defeating Goran Ivanisevic in the first round of the French Open
yesterday in Paris it was the big-serving Croat who was considering
early retirement.
''If I had a chance right now I would break all my rackets,'' said the
No.4 seed after he was beaten 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 by the unassuming Swede,
ranked 141st in the world.
''Right now I feel like I would stop playing tennis, but maybe one
hour from now I won't think like that. But I will not touch a racket for
the next 10 days and then after that I'll see what I'm going to do.''
With the thundering Ivanisevic serve failing him, the only threatening
noise heard around Roland Garros was the crackle of lightning from
darkening skies.
In the end, his brief appearance actually lasted a little longer than
it might have done, with rain delays twice interrupting the match -- the
second lasting two hours with the 23-year-old Swede on the point of
victory.
''It was a little bit tough,'' admitted Tillstrom. ''But he had more
than two sets to come back and win it, so I just said to myself, if I
lose this set I'm just going to hang in there and try to win the next
one.''
The delay did little to rattle his game and nothing to improve
Ivanisevic's as Tillstrom quickly disposed of the 23-year-old Croat, who
had come into the event playing some of the best clay court tennis of
his career.
Despite having to qualify, there was evidence that Tillstrom could be
a tricky opponent, having advanced to the fourth round last year before
losing to Pete Sampras.
In 1992 Tillstrom made it to the semi-finals in Monte Carlo, only to
have a series of injuries disrupt his promising career.
His problems began in 1993 in Adelaide, when he badly twisted his
ankle and was out of action for the next five months. He finally began
to return to form last year at Roland Garros, only to develop chronic
knee problems.
''It was my knees. They were almost stress fractures, so I just had to
rest,'' explained Tillstrom. ''After this injury I thought I was never
going to play again because I had so much pain.
''Even after I had been resting two months I still could not run or
anything. My left knee is still not 100 per cent. When I'm playing I
don't feel anything, but after the match I'm pretty sore.''
Title holder Sergi Bruguera enjoyed a straight sets victory over
Australian Patrick Rafter, though he was made to struggle in the third
set. He won a tiebreak 7-3 after cruising through the first two sets
6-1, 6-3.
American Michael Chang cruised through against a qualifier, Italian
Diego Nargiso, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1, Marc Rosset of Switzerland beat Aussie
Richard Fromberg 7-5, 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), and Germany's Boris Becker
beat Javier Frana of Argentina 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 6-3.
Back on home soil after winning the Australian Open, third seed Mary
Pierce delighted the French crowd with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over
Australian Nicole Bradtke.
Fourth seed Conchita Martinez of Spain was the only player not to be
disturbed by the rain. It took her only 43 minutes to defeat Germany's
Sabine Hack 6-0, 6-0. But two former finalists bowed out against
qualifiers.
American Mary Joe Fernandez, losing finalist in 1993, was the second
seed to crash out of the tournament after Czech Helena Sukova on Monday.
Struggling to regain her form after a bout of pneumonia, she lost 6-4,
6-3 to the Argentine's Paola Suarez.
Next to fall was Belarussian Natalia Zvereva, beaten 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 by
Romania's Catalina Cristea. Zvereva lost the shortest final in the
tournament's history to Steffi Graf in 1988.

THE bedroom is invariably somewhere personal, and among the rich, the
most sought-after interior designers are those who can create a bedroom
which successfully incorporates their client's particular taste in
design with some seldom seen aspect of their personalities.
London designer Maria Rossini specialises in interior decor for the
owners of stately homes, and is especially sought after for her ability
to create a haven within the old family pile which is a really
comfortable home for day-to-day living. She outlined her approach to
bedroom design. ''The bedroom is the most private domain within the
home, and the way in which it is perceived by the owner, and what this
represents to each man or woman, provides the key to their character,
private life and style.''
An aristocratic client asked Maria to create a bedroom which would
reflect her taste for ostentation and opulence, but which would also be
warm, comfortable and inviting since it was the room in the house where
each morning the whole family, including five children and the dogs,
gathered for tea at 7.30am.
The central feature of the bedroom which she created is a huge, high
four-poster bed, which makes use of the heavily embroidered silk sheets
and bearskin rug which are family heirlooms, and has its posts covered
in frilled floral silk. The solidly constructed chairs and sofas in the
bedroom have carved, gilded frames and tapestry cushions; tiger skins
shot by a great-grandfather in India in the early years of this century
are draped over the backs of the sofas, and the walls are decorated with
valuable oil paintings from the family's collection.
Practical features are taken care of -- there's a good reading lamp,
the telephone is within easy reach, there's a chair for the husband's
clothes, a basket for the dog, and some carpet-covered steps up to the
four poster, so that the smallest members of the family can easily join
in the breakfast scrum.
In contrast, businesswoman Anita Roddick who founded the multi-million
pound Body Shop cosmetic company, set out to design a bedroom which
looks completely anonymous. ''Her objective was to create a
matter-of-fact space simply for sleep,'' Maria explained.
''Basically, when she moved into and refurbished a seventeenth-century
Sussex farmhouse the bedroom was simply another item on her agenda. She
regarded the room as a stopover between one busy day and the next, and
chose a masculine, efficient design, partly because of her demanding
professional life, but also because she has a phobia about feminine,
frilly bedrooms.''
The result is a businesslike bedroom, with bedhead and curtains in
thick grey silk piped in red, and a bold blue and red bedspread. The
surfaces are as convenient as those in a workroom instead of a
dressing-table, and the clothes are hidden out of sight in mirrored,
wall-to-wall cupboards framed with plain, dark wood.
''One of the points which Anita Roddick was especially careful about
was the use of colour, because she recalled how dated the purples and
beiges of the sixties and the pastels of the seventies quickly became,
and because she wanted her new bedroom decor to have a lifespan of about
ten years before redecoration was necessary, she was keen to create a
timeless look, and chose grey as a good, safe, background colour,''
Maria said.
The choice of decoration, furnishings and colours which create the
mood in a bedroom will depend largely on how important the bedroom is to
the owners of the house. ''Most people choose one room in the house as
the place where they spend most of their time and feel most comfortable,
even though it may not be the largest or best furnished one,'' Maria
explained.
The ideal bedroom is one which meets the needs and lifestyle of its
occupants -- Thomas Jefferson designed his bedroom as two rooms, a study
and a dressing room, with his four poster strategically placed between
the two. If he was awake during the night, he would get out of bed and
sit reading in his study. In the morning, he would dress by the fire at
the other side of the bed. If you can also define your objectives so
clearly, then you can have a functional, timeless bedroom which can be
decorated as prettily as you please.
''The idea is to create a familiar place, with surroundings special to
yourself, so that you can bring your mind away from the cares of the
day, and recharge your energies,'' Maria said.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown gathered most of his Scotland squad
around him at Largs yesterday to continue preparations for next week's
European Championship game against the Faroe Islands.
But, as the players enjoyed the sunshine of the Clyde coast, and the
practice games arranged for them by Brown, he sent them home last night
with a warning.
Brown insisted that the hard work begins this week-end when the
players get together again to prepare for the following midweek, and the
sole remaining away game of the four which will decide whether or not
they will play in the finals of the tournament in England in the summer
of '96.
Brown admits warily: ''This is the kind of hurdle at which you don't
want to stumble when qualification gets closer. Yet, we all know that it
can happen to the best of teams.
''The problem here is that we are playing them up there and that
produces its own little problems. We won 5-1 at Hampden, three goals
ahead at half-time, but this won't be anything like it was then.
''Finland, for instance, found it difficult when they went to the
Faroes and it was very late in the game before they got the breakthrough
they wanted.
''We might have to be patient as well and we are ready to take our
time if that is what is required.''
Brown knows that one time European Footballer of the Year, Alan
Simonsson, has started to make his mark as the Faroes' coach. The
part-time players are now responding to the ex-Danish international
player's tactical knowledge, using a man-for-man marking system which
frustrates the opposition, and when the opportunity arises, they are
ready to break into attack.
Brown said: ''They scored three goals against San Marino last week. We
had the game watched, and the message we get back from that is they are
a better team than San Marino and they are not a team who will be
totally defensive in their approach.
''That is why this week-end will see the Under-21 players and other
lads in the squad being asked to play a man-for-man system similar to
that used by the Faroes. It will give us the chance to test ourselves in
that kind of situation.''
Yesterday, three of Brown's players missed the training session --
Celtic's John Collins, on holiday after the Scottish Cup Final, Bolton's
John McGinlay, resting after his club's play-off victory, and Billy
McKinlay of Dundee United who had a family illness which detained him on
Tayside.
All will be there for the weekend dress rehearsals and Brown already
sees McGinlay as being a potent weapon for his country, coming up on a
high after having helped the Lancashire side into the Premiership.
For a change, Brown had just one injury to report. Pat Nevin dropped
out of the squad with tendonitis. A replacement will be named today.

A SUBSTANTIAL eighteenth-century house with strong Clan Campbell
connections has just been put on the market.
Barcaldine House is in Benderloch, a few miles north of Oban.
The nearby Barcaldine Castle was built about 400 years ago by a man
who must have been popular with the estate agents of his day, Sir Duncan
Campbell of Glenorchy, known to his contemporaries as Duncan of the
Seven Castles (negative equity and high interest rates were not a
significant problem).
His great-grandson Para Dyarak, Red Patrick, built Barcaldine House
close to the castle around 1709 to accommodate his expanding family.
The result is a house which combines a traditional Highland mansion
with a successful holiday letting enterprise in one of the most scenic
parts of Scotland. Accommodation includes a large drawing room, dining
room, sitting room, garden room, billiard room and eight bedrooms, all
with en-suite bathrooms.
Six recently renovated flats in adjacent outbuildings provide an
income of around #30,000 a year.
Diarmid Mackenzie Smith, of selling agents Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
says: ''Barcaldine House offers either private family accommodation or,
if required, a significant commercial income.'' The asking price is
#295,000.

THERE was silence from Celtic managing director Fergus McCann
yesterday following the attack from his manager, Tommy Burns, on the
manner in which he has been running the Parkhead club.
No public reaction came from the Canadian, whose rescue package saved
Celtic from bankruptcy last year but whose actions since have come under
increasing scrutiny from both inside and outside the club.
There were rumours circulating Glasgow yesterday that Burns had left
the club even though the manager had indicated that he would rather stay
in the job and fight for what he believes in.
Burns appeared to be asking only for what most other club managers
have as well as protecting the rights of his players, the men he
considers most important of all inside the club.
There were talks at board level yesterday and the outcome may be that
Burns will be asked to explain his remarks to the directors.
Burns has the support and trust of major investors at the club but
there is some unhappiness that behind-the-scenes disputes have been
aired in public.
Powerful voices at Parkhead do not want to see a rerun of internecine
warfare which came close to destroying the club under the former regime.
If McCann was to consider sacking Burns, who has just brought the
first trophy to the club in six years, he could find opposition from
supporters and, possibly, major investors.
As for the fans, they are behind Burns, and if anything was to damage
the manager then season ticket sales would slump and McCann's financial
strategy could be in jeopardy.
Basically, McCann must learn to live with Burns and how football goes
about its business in Scotland.
If he does not do so then the Celtic saviour may find himself facing a
kind of conflict which the club cannot afford.
All Burns wants to do is manage the club the way it was done when he
was a player and when the club knew almost constant success.
The people who invested their money in the Celtic share issue, people
whose feelings cannot be ignored, would not see much wrong with that.

PAUL Gascoigne, taking a low profile off the training pitch, is doing
everything in his power on it to convince Terry Venables he is fit
enough to lead England's Umbro Cup challenge.
''He looks better physically than I've ever seen him,'' said injured
England captain David Platt after having watched the slimline,
Glasgow-bound star. ''He's worked so hard to get himself into shape and
now he's maintaining it.''
Gazza's determination to make up for lost time was evident on his
first day day back at work with England after 14 months. But after just
two Lazio comeback games after a year-long recovery from his broken leg,
it requires more than enthusiasm to persuade the England coach to take
the gamble that would boost a Wembley gate against Japan on Saturday
from around 40,000 to near capacity.
''He's got such a desire to do it, which is a big plus. But he's not
the best judge of whether he should be playing or not,'' said Venables.
''It's not complicated. It will be a straightforward decision about
whether I think he's right for the job. I'll go on my own instincts.
''There's no doubt that if he's fit and right it would be interesting
from everybody's point of view. We'd all like to see him if he's ready
-- if not, he's got to wait.''
Venables added: ''I've seen good signs -- he's been tackled and he got
stuck in himself. He put himself through the physical rigours necessary.
But it's too early to say.

SCOTS property professionals have condemned a television programme
which predicted falling house prices for the next 20 years.
Builders and estate agents said last week's Panorama was
''irresponsible'' in drawing conclusions about the whole of the UK's
property sector from the single example of a distressed housing
development at Vardy Stoke, near Bristol.
The programme highlighted the problems for house buyers created by
negative equity and shared equity schemes. The latter is a property
marketing technique where purchasers buy, for example, a 75% share of
their home at the outset and pay the builder the other 25% two or three
years later.
Its controversial claim that UK property prices would decline for two
decades as a result of these factors has provoked fury among builders
and estate agents on both sides of the border.
Deborah Benson, Miller Homes' sales and marketing director, said:
''The programme showed a strong southern bias by the BBC. Virtually all
negative equity is in the south of England, Scotland scarcely suffers
from it.
''Miller Homes operates in Scotland and England and, as a result, we
have direct experience in both markets and they are two very different
markets.''
Although property sales in Scotland are not booming, they are
''sound'' and the right home being sold at the right price will sell,
whether it is a brand new home or a traditional property, she said.
Iain Stewart, marketing director of Tay Homes, conceded that there has
been some negative equity north of the border. ''The ripple effect from
the boom in the south did affect one or two pockets in Newton Mearns,
Bearsden and Milngavie where people bought right at the peak of the
market.''
He ridiculed the programme's claim that the market would stand still
for the next 20 years. ''Programmes like this which try to draw lessons
for the whole of the UK from a local problem in the south of England can
be very damaging.''
Bob Campbell, of the Scottish Building Employers Federation, said that
many of his members were concerned that the programme could further dent
confidence. ''It made many assumptions which don't stand up to close
scrutiny. Nobody claims that this is an easy market, but things are
nothing like as bad as Panorama is claiming.''
The London-based House Builders Federation condemned the programme,
accusing it of deliberate distortion of the facts. ''It looked only at
short term problems in order to sensationalise the story,'' said Roger
Humber of the HBF.
''Experts know that the main factor affecting house prices is people's
incomes, and to imply that there will effectively be no growth in
incomes over the next 20 years is patently absurd.''
Describing the programme as ''totally irresponsible'', the National
Association of Estate Agents said that its concentration on Vardy Stoke
was not representative of the UK housing market.
''Clearly, this particular scheme was affected by a subsequent decline
in property values with consequential loss,'' said NAEA chief executive
Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy.
The NAEA is ''cautiously optimistic'' that confidence is gradually
returning, and that there has never been a better time to consider
entering the housing market, particularly for first-time buyers.

Gregor Fisher has
put his impressive
Ayrshire house up
for sale, reports
Stewart McIntosh
* THAT famous philosopher Rab C Nesbitt will never make the social
jump from his Govan council house to a country home in a pretty village.
But it's a trip Rab's alter ego, actor Gregor Fisher, makes almost
daily. When he is finished a hard day's ranting and blustering for the
cameras, he strips off his string vest, unwinds his dirty bandage and
heads for the north Ayrshire village of Dunlop, the place where he
unwinds.
''The good thing about Dunlop is that you can leave the BBC and
half-an-hour later you have forgotten all your cares as you arrive
home,'' says Gregor. ''It's a great wee village.''
A country boy at heart, he looks back with a shudder his London days,
when he had to travel regularly to Scotland for recordings. ''It would
take me an hour-and-a-quarter just to get from my home to Heathrow. It
was a miserable journey, so it's bliss to be living in a Scottish
village.''
He also likes the informality of the village. ''People here are very
down-to-earth. They don't treat me differently from anyone else -- I'm
just the guy who happens to be the father of three noisy kids.''
Now moving to something even grander in the area, Fisher has put his
impressive house on the market. Built in traditional Scots style, it
stands in lovely garden, which is a key feature of the house.
''I love gardening and so does my wife,'' says Gregor. ''We've done a
lot of the work ourselves, though we're lucky enough to have a gardener
five days a week. The result is a partnership between all of us. We've
put in ponds, waterfalls and God knows how many plants.''
Apart from various outbuildings, the accommodation comprises:
reception hall, drawing room, study, lounge, conservatory, farm-style
kitchen with Aga, TV room, five bedrooms and children's playroom. ''In
fact, we've just got the place looking the way we wanted it and now
we're selling it!''
Would-be buyers should contact the Robb Agency . . . not the Rab
Agency!

TWO out of seven young Scottish athletes chosen to represent Britain
next week have had to reject selection because of injury.
Commonwealth team colleagues Hazel Melvin (high jump) and Alison Grey
(shot) have opted out of the UK under-23 team which competes in a match
in Basle, Switzerland, next Monday.
Ruth Irving (long jump) and Vicky Lawrence (800m) will compete,
however, while Lorna Jackson, winner of the UK Inter-counties javelin
title on Sunday, named initially as reserve, has also now been called
in.
Three Scots have been chosen for the men's match to be staged the same
day at Zolfingen -- Ian Mackie and Doug Walker (200m), and Barry
Middleton (400m hurdles). Walker and Middleton are currently ranked top
of their age group in Britain in their respective events, while
Wirral-based Irving is No.1 in both the long and triple jumps.

THE Scottish World Cup management have delivered a stern rebuke to the
tournament organisers and to the South African Rugby Football Union for
delays in paying the players' #25 daily allowance.
The first payment was late, and when the second instalment failed to
arrive at the beginning of the week the Scottish Rugby Union paid the
players from its own bank account and is awaiting reimbursement from
SARFU.
The cash wrangle is one of number of organisational flaws with which
the Scots are unhappy. Complaints are also being made about the drug
testing procedures.
Team manager Duncan Paterson said: ''The testing procedure does
nothing for the players. To be accosted when they come off the pitch and
stuck away in a room without being allowed to shower or be treated for
injury is ludicrous.
''Tony Stanger and Bryan Redpath were selected for routine testing,
along with two Ivory Coast players, after our first game and they were
kept secluded for almost two hours.''

* THE relationship between the SRU and the team sponsor, Famous
Grouse, which The Herald understands is, at best, frosty, has suffered a
couple of fresh blows this week.
A township visit which Famous Grouse had undertaken to organise was
cancelled at the last minute and there are rumblings of discontent over
a proposed two-day ''safari'' visit to a game reserve next week.
''We undertook to go to a township and the visit would have done
wonders for the game and for the youngsters in particular,'' said
Paterson. ''Six days ago, I was told that it was arranged and then told
the day before we were due to go that it wasn't. That leaves a lot to be
desired.''

ALL OVER Scotland Burns clubs and societies are preparing special
events for next year's bicentenary of the poet's death.
Where better to sing Burns' praises than in Ayrshire? A house on the
market in Alloway overlooks one of Burns's favourite places, those banks
and braes o' bonnie Doon.
Doonside is a small estate right in the heart of Burns country. The
grounds extend to 11 acres and run down to the river adjacent to the old
Brig of Doon.
The bridge was immortalised in Tam O'Shanter when the drunken worthy
had to flee on Meg, his trusty steed, after getting too close to the
witches dancing in Kirk Alloway.
'Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg,
And win the key-stane of the brig;
There at them thou thy tail may toss,
A running stream they dare na cross.
A steady stream of would-be buyers can be predicted for the estate,
which is being sold in two lots and includes Doonside House, a listed
gatehouse, paddock, and woodlands with frontage on to the river Doon on
the southern edge of Alloway.
Lot 1 consists of Doonside House and eight acres, including fishing
rights. The house has three public rooms, six bedrooms, and three
bathrooms. The stone-built garage block can take three cars and there is
another outbuilding.
Lot 2 comprises Doonside Lodge at the entrance gates, which has three
apartments and comes with 3.5 acres, which include river frontage and
fishings.
Chartered surveyors Donald Ross of Ayr are seeking offers over
#275,000 for Lot 1 and offers over #65,000 for Lot 2. The successful
bidder can walk where Burns was inspired to write:
Oft hae I rov'd by bonnie Doon,
To see the rose and woodbine twine;
And ilka bird sang o' its love,
And fondly sae did I o' mine.

Scotland 41, Tonga 5
SCOTLAND are through to the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals, but they
will be nursing the bruises of a ferocious contest with Tonga for days
to come.
The Scots expected the Tongans to strong-arm their way through the
Loftus Versfeld encounter in Pretoria. And so it proved.
But the Tongans' indiscipline ultimately proved to be their undoing as
Gavin Hastings kicked eight priceless penalty goals to equal the
world-record mark for a single match. If you add a try, as well as two
conversions, his 33 points has taken his World Cup total to 77 in only
two games.
The final penalty count of 18-7 in favour of the Scots more than told
the story. The 21,000-crowd -- with the exception of those not flying
the Saltire -- whistled their disapproval at Australian referee Brian
Leask, but his treatment of the Tongans was more than justified, so
often were they offside, late-tackling, and generally making a mighty
nuisance of themselves.
Scotland made a dream start when Doddie Weir caught the ball from
Craig Chalmers' kick-off and as the Melrose fly-half gathered ruck ball
and hoisted a garryowen, he was taken out late by flanker Fenukitau.
Gavin Hastings took up where he had left off at Rustenburg four days
previously with a perfectly struck penalty goal. The Scots had much to
thank the tutored Hastings boot as it alone kept them in the game during
a torrid first half.
In the sixth minute, Hastings stretched the lead with his second
penalty goal, as Derrick Patterson this time, was late-tackled. After 11
minutes, the Tongans were blatantly offside at a ruck and Hastings made
it 9-0.
Tonga might have been down but they certainly were not out and after a
period of intense pressure, flanker Ipoliti Fenukitau surged over for a
try at the right corner.
Tonga were unable to remain on the right side of the referee, and when
Damian Cronin was taken out at a ruck, Hastings made it 12-5 with a
35-metre penalty.
Once again, Tonga came powering back, and only bone-crunching tackles
by Scott Hastings and Rob Wainwright kept the Scottish line intact.
Hastings made it 15-5 after 32 minutes with his fifth penalty, and two
minutes before the interval, the captain -- whose priceless right boot
will surely find a place of honour in the Murrayfield museum -- made it
18-5 when the Tongans fell foul of the ref yet again.
Scotland raised the tempo of their game in the second period and,
within a minute, Hastings had kicked them further ahead with his seventh
penalty.
For a 10-minute spell early in the second period, the Scots had the
Tongans on the back foot, but it was the inevitable penalty that allowed
Hastings to kick his eighth, and world record-equalling goal.
After an hour Scotland began to establish a recognisable pattern to
their game, and Eric Peters rounded off a brave Craig Joiner run with a
try. Hastings missed the conversion, and proved five minutes later, that
he was human after all when he missed with a penalty attempt after he
had been late-tackled. Within a couple of minutes, he had made amends,
and in fine style, with a try.
Scotland were in no danger now, but they certainly knew that they had
been in a game, prop Peter Wright leaving the field five minutes from
the end with what looked like a shoulder injury.
The final try of the evening came from Scott Hastings, co-centre Ian
Jardine kicking through and the younger Hastings pouncing on the loose
ball. Brother Gavin slotted home the conversion to bring his personal
tally to 31 points.
Later, tired but satisfied, Gavin Hastings declared: ''I've got a few
more games to go before I retire from the international arena. How many?
Well, four, five, or six. I'm enjoying it. This is a big stage and it's
nice to perform to the best of your ability.
''I've always believed in looking forward and, right now, I'm looking
forward to the game against France on Saturday. That's more important to
me than the records.''
Hastings declined to brand the Tongans a ''dirty'' side, but he did
say that he had enjoying profiting from their indiscretions. ''I was
just doing my job out there. When the opposition give away all those
penalties, and you punish them by putting the ball between the posts,
then that is very satisfying.''
The captain was asked if he was playing the best rugby of his
illustrious career. Before he could answer, coach Dougie Morgan
interjected: ''Let me say that he is definitely playing the best rugby
of his career.''
The captain added that the match had not been the most physical he had
ever played in, but the forwards might not agree. ''It was a very
physical match for the forwards. They will certainly know that they've
been in a game, but I'm sure the Tongans will as well. There are a few
of them hobbling around out there.''
Team manager Duncan Paterson said that Peter Wright had suffered a
neck strain and flanker Iain Morrison had sustained a cut below the
knee. Neither injury was causing immediate concern.

Hastings (Watsonians), I Jardine, (Stirling County), K Logan (Stirling

SCOTLAND will draw strongly on a Lanarkshire influence when they
travel to the Faroe Islands next week for the last away match in their
quest to qualify for the European Championship finals and Alex McLeish,
whose Motherwell side have experience of playing in the Faroes, is
warning that nothing should be taken for granted.
''This one is a potential banana skin,'' he said yesterday. ''The
Faroe Island side are better than most people may think.''
McLeish's side drew Havnar Boltfelag in a preliminary round of last
season's UEFA Cup and, although the Fir Park side won 3-0 at home and
4-1 away, McLeish recalled that it was not straightforward. In the away
match, Motherwell encountered some difficulties, the most troublesome
being the wind.
The national stadium is perched at the top of a hill and McLeish said:
''It was blowing a gale which made life very hard for us and Scotland
will have to hope for calm conditions when the play the Faroes next
Wednesday.''
Two of his players, Brian Martin and Rob McKinnon, are likely to
feature in Craig Brown's starting team and, although they both have only
two caps each, they are not short of experience.
The unavailability of Colin Hendry and Tom Boyd means Brown will have
to use the Motherwell duo in his defensive line and the fact that one of
them, Martin, has played in the national stadium on the Faroe Islands
should help.
McKinnon played in the home leg of the UEFA Cup tie, but was injured
when the team travelled and, in fact, he has just recovered from another
injury sustained when he gained the second of his caps, in Japan, almost
two weeks ago.
He injured a foot when a Japanese defender hit him with a late tackle
and was unable to play in the second match against Ecuador, but he has
fully recovered and will be ready to operate on the left against the
Faroese.
''He hasn't had many caps because I have been using players like David
Robertson and Tom Boyd,'' said Brown, ''but he is a good player who is
naturally left sided.
''He has a powerful shot with his left and also delivers a good ball
into the penalty area and we will need that next week. I want to see the
ball being sent across their box.''
Brown has preferred other defenders to McKinnon in the past because,
while his forward play has always been impressive, his defensive
qualities were not what was required at the top level.
However, he has improved that part of his game this season and his own
manager, McLeish, believes he is a much more accomplished defender.
''I told him that to get himself a permanent place in the
international side he would have to take his defending on to a higher
level because, while he goes on some tremendous forward runs, his
priority is to defend. I'd say that this season he did that and that he
was probably our most consistent player,'' McLeish said.
McKinnon, who has not always been the most confident player despite
his bold moves on the pitch, also appears to have a greater belief in
himself and he feels he can go on from here and win more caps before his
career ends.
''I'd like to be involved with the national squad for a while yet,''
he said.
''I hope to play against the Faroese, who won't be as negative as San
Marino. If the Faroe Islands go behind they are likely to try to get a
goal back and that might be to our benefit.
''Hopefully, we can do two things next week. We have to win but it
would also be good to put in a professional performance.''

SCOTT Henderson, of the Kings Links centre in Aberdeen, carded a
one-under-par 67 at Aboyne yesterday to win the Gordon Highlanders
Assistants' Pro-Am.
In a field which could well have doubled as an unofficial north and
north-east assistants' championship, Henderson's five-birdie round
proved to be three strokes better than second-placed Gary Lister, of
Inverness, who notched 11 pars on the trot from the seventh. Leading
scores:
67 -- S Henderson (Kings Links). 70 -- G Lister (Inverness). 72 -- G
Bruce (Westhill). 73 -- J Caven (Banchory), M McCorquodale
(Peterculter). 74 -- B Whalen (Ellon), J Kerr (Portlethen), G Simpson
(Deeside). 75 -- W Lyle (Nairn). 76 -- A Locke (Banchory).
Leading team: 56 -- D McCormack, R Auld (18), I McAdam (18), D Clark
(11).
* TORRENTIAL rain, thunder and lightning forced officials to abandon

The first of the 16 regional finalists had only reached the twelfth
hole on the West course when the elements brought an end to proceedings.
The event has now been rescheduled for Friday, September 15.
* BERNHARD Langer's victory in the Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth

ANNE Smillie, chief executive of the Scottish Badminton Union, has
given an assurance that the 1997 world championships, which will be held
at the new Scotstoun Sports Centre in Glasgow, would be the ''best
ever.''
Smillie made her comments in the wake of criticisms levelled at the
organisation of this year's championships in Switzerland, which ended
last weekend.
''I can promise that the Glasgow championships will run very
smoothly,'' she said, following her return from Lausanne where she was
studying the organisation of the event alongside representatives from
Glasgow City Council.
Lausanne struggled to accommodate their guests after #250,000 of
sponsorship money failed to materialise in the championship coffers.
The Scottish team, for example, could only afford basic accommodation
in a youth hostel, despite the fact that special hotel rates had been
organised by the Swiss Badminton Union.
''In the past, we have managed to get very good deals in good hotels
for players visiting our tournaments,'' said Smillie.
''I am sure no-one will have to settle for basic accommodation in
Glasgow.
''Moreover, we plan to set up deals with local restaurants to cut down
on the cost of living for the players, which was not done in Lausanne.
''We are expecting in excess of 105 nations. That is almost double the
number of countries at this year's event.
''In fact, the International Badminton Federation is considering
splitting the championships into two for the 1999 event. The feeling is
Glasgow can handle it, but after that it may be just too big.''

Western Samoa 32 Argentina 26
WESTERN Samoa's Darren Kellett is almost certain to miss their World
Cup showdown with England in Durban on Sunday after dislocating his
shoulder in yesterday's bruising victory over Argentina in Pool B.
The fly-half converted four second half penalties and also made some
crucial tactical kicks as Western Samoa came from 26-13 down to secure a
place in the quarter-finals.
The winners of the Western Samoa-England match will meet the Pool A
runners-up -- probably holders Australia -- with the losers likely to
face hosts South Africa.
England manager Jack Rowell, watching from the sidelines, said:
''Western Samoa are all ball-handlers and we need to tackle persistently
and scrum well enough to keep them pinned down.''
The Samoans went into the break 16-10 down with Jose Cilley kicking
three penalties and converting a penalty try. Wing George Harder scored
Western Samoa's only try of the first half, converted by Kellett, who
also kicked a penalty.
Four minutes into the second half Argentine scrum half Rodrigo Crexell
touched down and Cilley converted. But after that the Pumas' scoring
dried up apart from one more Cilley penalty.
Kellett slotted four successive penalties and tries by replacement
winger George Leaupepe and No.8 Pat Lam in the final five minutes gave
them victory.
Western Samoa -- M Umaga; B Lima, T Vaega, T Fa'amasino, G Harder; D
Kellett, T Nu'ualiitia; M Mika, T Leasamaivao, G Latu, L Falaniko, P
Leavasa, S Tatupu, P Lam, J Paramore.
Argentina -- E Jurado; D Cuesta Silva, L Arbizu, S Salvat, M Teran; J
Cilley, R Crexell; M Corral, F Mendez, P Noriega, G Llanes, P Sporleder,

ROB Andrew will be happy to relinquish the role of England's
goal-kicking saviour again today against Italy in Durban when he leads
his country for the second time.
Andrew has rattled up 190 points in 11 Tests since being restored as
the main goal-kicker, but England's latest try drought now stands at 160
minutes.
England have won their last two games, thanks to Andrew contributing
24 points each time -- in the Grand Slam clincher against Scotland in
March and the World Cup opener against Argentina last weekend.
Andrew, leading in place of the injured Will Carling, said: ''For our
own confidence we have got to give a try-scoring performance. We need to
bounce back with a big display so that Saturday's poor match against
Argentina becomes forgotten.''
England's reshaped side includes fast clearers of the ball in recalled
scrum half Kyran Bracken and restored flanker Neil Back.
England -- M J Catt; T Underwood, P R De Glanville, J C Guscott, R
Underwood; C R Andrew (captain), K P P Bracken; G C Rowntree, B C Moore,
J Leonard, M O Johnson, M C Bayfield, T A K Rodber, B B Clarke, N A
Back.
* WALES captain Mike Hall has passed himself fit to play in today's
clash with New Zealand in Johannesburg.
Hall suffered a rib injury during Saturday's World Cup opener against
Japan, but said: ''I felt fine during this morning's training session.''
Wales -- A Clement; I Evans, M Hall (captain), G Thomas, W Proctor; N
Jenkins, R Jones; R Evans, J Humphries, J Davies, D Jones, G Prosser, G
Llewellyn, M Bennett, H Taylor.
* AUSTRALIA, beaten 27-18 by South Africa in their opening game, have
included many of their second-string players in their team to meet
Canada in Port Elizabeth today.
Australia -- M Burke; J Roff, J Little, T Horan, D Campese; M Lynagh
(captain), P Slattery; T Daly, P Kearns, M Harthill, W Waugh, J Eales, W
Ofahengaue, I Tabua, T Gavin.
Canada -- S Stewart; W Stanley, C Stewart, S Gray, D Lougheed; G Rees
(captain), J Graf; E Evans, K Svoboda, R Snow, M James, G Rowlands, J
Hutchinson, G MacKinnon, Al Charron.
* IRELAND'S match against Japan in Bloemfontein will be a big test for
23-year-old tight-head prop Paul Wallace. He is the only uncapped player
in the team and will have the distinction of playing alongside his older
brother, Richard, the right wing.
Ireland -- C O'Shea; R Wallace, B Mullin, M Field, S Geoghegan; P
Burke, N Hogan; N Popplewell (captain), K Wood, P Wallace, D Tweed, N
Francis, D Corkery, E Halvey, P Johns.

THEY may have off-field troubles to solve, but Celtic could delight
their fans, still high on the Scottish Cup victory, by signing a striker
from Ajax, the European Cup winners against AC Milan last week.
The player the Parkhead manager, Tommy Burns, is believed to be keen
on is Peter van Vossen, who has been having trouble holding down a
first-team place with the advent of brilliant youngsters like Patrick
Kluivert as well as established men like Ronald de Boer, Finn Jari
Litmanen, and Marc Overmars.
The Dutch international forward was on the substitutes' bench in
Vienna last week when Ajax won the trophy, but he has not been happy at
being ousted from the top side this season.
I understand that Celtic are switching their attentions to the Ajax
man because there could be problems obtaining a work permit for Russian
striker Dimitri Radchenko, who is currently with Spanish side Real
Santander.
Ajax want #2.4m for van Vossen, whose wage bill, around #250,000 a
year, would have to be matched as well.
The man who started out as an amateur, like current Parkhead striker
Pierre van Hooydonk, is determined to move on, and Ajax's attitude in
those circumstances is to let players go and replace them with another
from their conveyor belt of talent.
Burns, who spent time earlier in the year studying the Dutch club's
methods, has never hidden his admiration for all things Ajax and the
prospect of van Vossen, who can play as a winger, linking up with van
Hooydonk would appeal to Parkhead fans.
Van Vossen cost Ajax about #1.5m three seasons ago, when they brought
him back to Holland from Anderlecht, but his individualistic style has
not fitted in with the strategy of coach Luis van Gaal.
Other clubs, from Belgium, Italy, and Spain, are showing interest in
the Dutchman's future, but he is said to be keeping an open mind about
where he would like to go.
The fact that Celtic have won a place in the Cup-winners' Cup could be
a useful negotiating factor.
* GERMAN prosecutors yesterday charged Manchester City midfield player
Maurizio Gaudino with fraud, putting his hopes of a permanent transfer
to Maine Road under threat.
Gaudino scored four goals in 21 appearances during an extended loan at
City last season and hoped to agree terms for a proposed #1m switch from
Eintracht Frankfurt.
But the move has been threatened after Gaudino, a member of Germany's
World Cup squad, was charged with profiting by aiding bogus insurance
claims for luxury cars.

WORCESTERSHIRE are just one match away from returning to Lord's for
the Benson and Hedges Cup final following yesterday's comfortable
seven-wicket victory over Yorkshire at Headingley.
Last season's beaten finalists cruised to victory with 32 overs to
spare after bowling Yorkshire out for 88, their lowest score in the
competition.
Stuart Lampitt claimed the Gold Award for grabbing four for 16 from
7.5 overs as Yorkshire, who were put into bat, slipped to 10 for four
after eight overs. They rallied through a fighting 47 by acting captain
David Byas, who hit five 4s from 121 balls, before falling to a
brilliant one-handed catch by Lampitt.
Worcestershire's reply got off to a nightmare start with Phil Weston
falling to Peter Hartley in the second over, but Graeme Hick hit six 4s
in his 27 off 35 balls to steady any nerves.
Hick departed to a brilliant catch at mid-wicket by Michael Bevan, but
Tom Moody scored an aggressive, unbeaten 32 from 39 balls, including two
6s off left-arm spinner Richard Stemp to steer Worcestershire to
victory.
Graham Lloyd guided Lancashire to a six-wicket victory over
Nottinghamshire with 32 balls to spare. The 25-year-old hit an unbeaten
72 from 68 balls to earn his first Gold Award after Lancashire had
restricted Notts to 201 for eight in their 55 overs.
Kent claimed their first victory over Middlesex in 22 years of Benson
and Hedges Cup cricket at Canterbury. Their 26-run victory, spurred by a
century-opening partnership between Trevor Ward (64) and Mark Benson
(56) added to a vital all-round display from Mark Ealham.
Ealham struck a vital 30 to take Kent to a 250 total. He then claimed
two for 38 and caught Keith Brown in the closing overs as Middlesex were
bowled out for 224.
England Under-19 skipper Marcus Trescothick guided Somerset to the
brink of victory in their rain-hit quarter-final against Gloucestershire
at Bristol. Trescothick hit an unbeaten 35 as Somerset reached 63 for
two to leave them requiring 51 off 30 overs today after Gloucestershire
were bowled out for 113.
Spinners Mushtaq Ahmed, Jeremy Batty and Harvey Trump took seven
wickets between them as Gloucestershire's last six wickets fell for 23
in 19 overs.
B&amp;H CUP. QUARTER-FINALS

AS Scotland's leading players were going about their business in South
Africa against Tonga, the Scottish Development Squad were preparing for
the opening match of their tour of Zimbabwe today in Banket, writes Alan
Lorimer.
They face Mashonoland Country Districts, who finished third in the
national provincial championship and last weekend lost to English club
side Bracknell. But despite this result David Johnston, the Scotland
coach, is not being lulled into thinking that this will be an easy
match.
''Because we have had little time to acclimatise to altitude this will
be a hard game for us,'' he acknowledged.
Scotland's additional problems will have much to do with their lack of
team understanding. It is a new side, albeit that there are several
experienced A players in the team. Johnston said that if the opposition
did turn out to be less strong than expected then it would provide the
Scots with a chance to try out a number of moves.
The District side contains four Zimbabwe A players and one national
squad member in full back Marius Steenkamp, the 22-year-old who has
graduated from the Zimbabwe under-21 team.
Among the A team representatives are Gary O'Neill, the strongly built
No.8, and Steve Rugg, the veteran stand off who played against Scotland
seven years ago in Kadoma, where the tourists scored over 50 points in
trouncing the equivalent Districts side.
Districts secretary Kevin Pope, a former officer in the King's Own
Scottish Borderers, promised that whatever his side could offer against
what he expects to be strong opposition, they will ''surely play with
the heart of a lion.''
Yesterday the Scots trained at Banket, which is the oldest club ground
in Zimbabwe. Whether or not the ground is regarded as a historic site it
certainly is kept in immaculate condition, so at least for their opening
match the Scots can expect to play on a surface which will suit an open
game but which will not be brick hard.
Scotland -- M Dods (Gala); H Gilmour (Heriot's), M Craig (Waterloo), D
Hodge (Watsonians), J Kerr (Watsonians); S Laing (Instonians), K Troup
(Edinburgh Academicals); M Browne (Melrose), J Hay (Hawick), A Kittle
(Stewart's Melville FP), R Scott (London Scottish), M Rudkin

(Stirling County).
Replacements -- R Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals), G Burns (Stewart's
Melville FP), I Elliot (Hawick), G Dall (Heriot's), M Scott (Orrell), A
Watt (GHK).
* THE annual meeting of the Inter City Second XV League will be held
at Hughenden tomorrow night at 7.30 and not July 1 as stated in the
notice calling the meeting. All members of the league should send two

South Africa 21, Romania 8
AFTER the sunshine, and the thrills and spills of the opening match
last Thursday, the Cape Town clouds embraced the top of Table Mountain,
and the South African ''Gold Team,'' their shadow side, lost its way in
its very own cloud of indecision and lack of penetration.
But South Africa remain unbeaten, and after the shock win for Western
Samoa over Argentina, the South Sea islanders look to be the favourites
to face Francois Pienaar's side in the next round.
''A lot of the guys in our team are new to Test rugby,'' said Kitch
Christie, coach to the Springboks.
''But we won, and if there is a photograph to be taken, we can now say
that we have fielded all of our players. We have never been on the same
pitch as Romania before. Perhaps we underestimated them.''
Double try-scoring captain, Adriaan Richter, slipped temporarily into
''England Speak'' after the game, claiming that the Romanians had come
to spoil.
''They were good at their limited style,'' he said. ''But they played
a negative game, and they fell over the ball and prevented our play.
That is my opinion. We were definitely too relaxed, and I don't think
that the boys will be too happy with the way they played.''
The Romanians, who had played with obvious pride throughout against
their big-name opponents -- a pride exemplified by their captain Tiberiu
Brizi who took to the pitch with a badly damaged shoulder -- were happy,
but realistic after the game.
''We are not totally satisfied, and maybe the South Africans were not
motivated,'' said Brizi, adding strength to the argument that the hosts
lack real strength in depth. ''I do not think that South Africa would
win the World Cup with that side today,'' he added.
South Africa led 8-0 at half time, and had to contend with the boos of
their rainbow supporters -- the authorities had bussed in coloured and
black schoolchildren -- as they trudged back to the halfway line to
contemplate the restart.
Gavin Johnson had slotted a penalty, and Richter had gratefully
accepted his front five's efforts to pounce for a pushover try, but
there had been no scoring since the tenth minute. James Small, growling
up the right wing, only received possession twice in the game. ''I'd
have been upset if I was him,'' said coach Christie.
In the second half, Johnson slotted another two penalties, and Richter
took his second try well after an up-and-under, but the Eastern
Europeans refused to fade away. The try of the match was theirs, a crash
ball from Vasile Brici was carried on by Vasile Flutur and Andrei
Guranescu went over.
''We now look forward to our game with Australia,'' said captain
Brinza. A South African public, that had been utterly convinced that
they were on the road to winning the World Cup, now have some nagging
doubts. Teams:
South Africa -- G Johnson, J Small, C Scholtz, B Venter, P Hendricks,
H le Roux, J Roux; G Pagel, C Rossouw, M Hurter, K Wiese, K Otto, R
Kruger, R Brink, A Richter (capt).
Romania -- V Brici, L Colceriu, N Raceanu, R Gontineac, G Solomie, I
Ivancuic, V Flutur: G Leonte, I Negreci, G Vlad, C Cojocariu, A

RARELY has there been a more surprised winner of the Rover Trophy than
Irvine sailmaker John Highcock, who steered absentee owner John Corson's
34-foot Moody 336 Crusader II to a sixth consecutive victory in Class 5
in yesterday's final race on Loch Fyne.
Last year Highcock, a former youth member of the 470 Olympic squad and
the British 420 team, scored five firsts and was disqualified from the
sixth for a premature start. Starting early in two other races and
having to restart, he repeated that same error once this week and lived
on to win by half a minute to maintain his unbeaten record.
''Having won last year several times after restarting minutes behind
the fleet I knew we could win the class, but I never, ever though we
would win the main trophy -- not even when we came ashore unbeaten
tonight. Last year and this I always lived in the belief that it would
go to one of the more racy classes, but I put this down to excellent
team-work.''
Steve Goacher, also a sailmaker, lifted the Sonata class with six
firsts and showed he could match Highcock's prowess for recovery when he
managed to salvage an unbelievable dead-heat in yesterday's race after
he was 1min 40sec down on the leader after the first circuit of the
Olympic Triangle.
''I jump from boat to boat and help clients get them going well, but
this is only the second time I've steered a whole major regatta and now
perhaps I'd liek to helm something a little bigger next year,''
concluded Highcock.
In Class 0, Geoff Howison's BHB 41 Local Hero X collected the overall
honours. Results:

France 54 Ivory Coast 18
CENTRE Thierry Lacroix led the way as France predictably piled up the
points against Ivory Coast yesterday to win their Pool D match. But
Ivory Coast, defeated by a record 89-0 by Scotland in their opening
game, at least had the consolation of scoring their first World Cup
points.
Fly half Aboubacar Camara had the honour of scoring his country's
first cup try midway in the second half, and right wing Aboubacar
Soulama added a second when he touched down after centre Jean Sathicq
made an interception in his own half and kicked ahead. Full-back Victor
Kouassi kicked two penalties and one conversion.
Lacroix scored 20 points with two tries, two conversions and two
penalties. His first try came in only 90 seconds when he dived over in
the corner after a tap penalty. No.8 Abdel Benazzi, scrum-half Guy
Accoceberry, and full-back Sebastien Viars also scored first-half tries
to give France a 28-3 interval lead.
In a lively second half, France added further tries through William
Techoueyes, Arnaud Costes, Philippe Saint-Andre, and another by Lacroix.
The Lacroix early score looked to be setting up a repeat of the 89-0
massacre by Scotland. But the Ivory Coast played with more spirit and
confidence than they had shown against Scotland and managed their first
points in a World Cup when full-back Victor Kouassi kicked the first of
two penalties.
Kouassi added a second penalty, then, after 64 minutes came the moment
the Ivory Coast was waiting for when Camara charged down an attempted
Lacroix clearance to score.
French skipper Philippe Saint-Andre was disappointed with his side's
display, despite having clinched their place in the quarter-finals.
''Our only satisfactions are the fact that we won, and the way we
behaved in the scrums and the lineouts,'' said Saint-Andre. ''We were
once again unable to play consistently for 80 minutes.''
Frenchman Dominique Davanier, one of the Ivory Coast coaches, was
proud of his team's performance. ''We gave it all we had and that was
the plan,'' he said. ''I'm glad for the players because they were able
to show the crowd that they can play good rugby.''
France -- Viars; Saint-Andre, captain, Mesnel, Lacroix, Techoueyres;
Delaigue, Accoceberry; Benazzi, Cabannes, Costes, Roumat, Brouzet,
Califano, De Rougemont, Benezech.
Ivory Coast -- Kouassi; Soulama, Sathicq, captain, Niakou, Brito;
Camara, Dupont; Lassissi, Okou, Pere, Sanoko, Aka, Djehi, Niamien,
Ezoua.

TINA Majerle has a right to be annoyed. She is the wife of Dan Majerle
of the Phoenix Suns basketball team. Recently, she was in hospital
expecting a baby and was about to undergo a procedure to induce labour.
Unexpectedly, a large crowd gathered outside her hospital window and
began to make such a racket that her treatment had to be postponed.
Apparently, a radio commentator had been advised of Mrs Majerle's
condition and exalted fans of her husband to troop out to the hospital
to cheer her on. Unfortunately, the kind of support that encourages her
husband on the court had the opposite effect on Tina and her doctors.
* IN recent years, the Reebok sports shoe company has promoted its
products by inquiring in its commercials: ''What is life like on Planet
Reebok?'' Then comes the response: ''No pain and no limit.''
The latter could well be the case on Planet Venus now that Reebok has
signed 14-year-old tennis prodigy Venus Williams to a multi-year,
multi-million dollar endorsement contract. Reportedly, they will pay
Williams even more than they do Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, currently the
world's top-ranked female player.
There are plenty of ironies inherent in the deal. At the time of the
signing, Williams had played only one game as a professional, an albeit
impressive appearance in the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland,
California, last year. Even so, in that match Vicario beat her in three
sets.
Giving even more pause for thought is the fact that the last teenage
phenomenon to receive such an endorsement deal was Jennifer Capriati in
1990. Three years later, at the age of 17, Capriati had quit the sport.
''I think we all know that signing these kids is a crapshoot,''
observed Ian Hamilton of Nike, Reebok's biggest rival in the shoe wars.
Of course, Nike wanted to sign Williams, too.
* IN Canada, the gun control movement is generating as much
controversy as it does in the USA, but few are as vigorous as George
Duffy, lobbiest for the Responsible Firearms Owners of Alberta. One of
his great fears is that the sport of gun-play will be denied Canada's
children.
Speaking before the Canadian House of Commons recently, he observed:
''Children are going to cease to participate in the gun hobby because
it's going to get too regulatory. Children are going to say: 'I'm going
to play golf. I'm going to play football.' Is that what the government
wants?''
* IF sport is a serious business in the USA, then baseball is the most
serious business of all. It has been immortalised in poem and song,
debated long and hard in every form of the media, and been woven into
the very fabric of American society.
Renowned baseball commentators, Phil Rizzuto, in recognition of his
contribution to the sport, was recently awarded an honorary Doctor of
Laws degree by Iona College in New York. Reading the press release
announcing the award, however, one might have been forgiven for assuming
that Rizzuto was being canonised.
In florid prose it explained that Rizzuto was receiving the award
''for expressing, through his manner on the field and his commentary
from the booth, the Judeo-Christian tradition of brotherhood and of
respect for the individual: for illuminating the truth about baseball,
that its history discloses not merely a sport but the very essence of
our human experience, and for reminding us, with his characteristic
honesty and exuberance, that life, like baseball, is to be treasured.''
And Rizzuto thought he was just a commentator.
* WHEN the Indiana Pacers played the New York Knicks in Indiana last
week in the sixth game of the NBA playoffs, the Pacers were expected to
win and eliminate the Knicks from the competition. But the Knicks won
the game and forced a decider on their home turf. Even so, Indiana duly
finished the job in New York .
Commenting on their failure to knock out the Knicks sooner, Mark
Jackson of the Pacers said: ''We felt a little bad not finishing them
off in Indianapolis, but it's much better to go into somebody else's
house and put your feet on the furniture.''

SCOTTISH football may have held a monopoly on them through the years,
but the flawed genius is not unique to our game. Indeed, Diego Maradona,
one of the most astounding talents ever to emerge in world football,
could have shown the most wayward of Scots a new trick or two.
In fact, next to the Argentinian our own Duncan Ferguson is most
definitely innocent. In fact, he is an angel.
In the beginning they came rushing and snapping at Maradona in the
shape of opposing defenders. Then he felt he was being hounded by
football's blackhats, the referees, and when he had shaken them off he
convinced himself the establishment were out to get him. Now they are
and they're pressing to have him jailed for four years because he took
pot shots at pressmen.
Apart from that, poor little Diego is on the lam from the CIA, or so
he believes. The reality is that after almost two decades of being
pursued by packs of media people, spivs, and hangers-on, the Argentinian
is losing touch with his sanity.
Still he proclaims his innocence over FIFA's drugs bust which cut
short his return to international football during the World Cup finals
in America. When traces of a banned substance were found in his system
during a routine doping test, he was banished from football's main stage
and suspended for 15 months.
The heart was torn from Maradona and Argentina, who had been
performing better than any other side in the early matches of the
finals. With their captain and inspiration gone they were reluctant to
play on and defeat became inevitable.
Argentina's government had pleaded with Maradona to end his
international exile by playing in America and he obliged taking a
substance to enhance weight loss.
That was to be his downfall, but like the wounded and abused ageing
boxer who never knows when he has had enough, Maradona became
susceptible to paranoia.
The 34-year-old told a Brazilian magazine, Veja, that his dismissal
from America was the result of a CIA plot hatched because of his
friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro. It would be funny if it were not so
sad.
When the mighty fall they travel a long way down and while there were
many around him when he was on top of the world there are too few
willing to catch him or cushion his fall now. After having spent the
greater part of his life using speed, wit, balance, and his low centre
of gravity to survive violent defenders, Maradona is being worn down by
mental pressures.
Life in the limelight, his elevation from poorly educated slum urchin
to world superstar is exacting a desperate toll. The signs have been
there for a number of years now, but no-one tried to keep him in touch
with reality and, being a creature of extreme emotions, Maradona was
always liable to suffer more than most.
He played the game with a passion so fierce it might have burned the
flesh had it been possible to reach out and touch the force which drove
him from poverty to riches, to despair and uncertainty.
He had a wondrous gift which he shared with the world and he should be
enjoying the wealth he received in return, but Maradona cannot settle.
He cannot relax. There are demons at large inside his head which refuse
to allow him peace.
Behind dark and darting eyes is the tortured soul of a man who has
been used. The characteristics are similar to those which were written
large on the tormented features of John McEnroe, another of sport's
geniuses and another who almost self-destructed because of pressures
both real and imagined.
McEnroe mellowed, although it would still be unwise of any Wimbledon
reporters who crossed him in the past to approach like long-lost
brothers. Best to stay crouched, Joe Frazier style, just in case.
With Maradona a bullet-proof vest should be regulation issue. He shot
at pressmen, who had congregated outside his home, with an air rifle in
February 1992 and faces criminal charges which a court in Buenos Aires
refused to drop in exchange for a sentence of community service.
If Maradona wants to avoid the four-year jail sentence being demanded
by the prosecution he must take his appeal to the Supreme Court.
Ironically, he finds himself fighting for his liberty when, in fact,
he has never really been free. Since he was a 16-year-old prodigy, who
was used by the generals who ran the country, he has been a victim of
his public and the media who pushed microphones and cameras into his
face every time he appeared outdoors.
There are few people strong enough to live with such pressures and his
resolve was eroded to a dangerously thin level. Yet, his love of the
game will not allow him to stay away and Maradona is being pulled in the
direction of Brazil.
His FIFA ban ends in September and he is negotiating with Santos,
where the temptation of wearing that club's famous No.10 shirt will
probably prove too strong a lure. Maradona in Pele's jersey. It has
appeal, but a profound sadness also.
Both were kings of soccer, only one survived the crushing burden of
world-wide adulation.
The other's remaining energies should be channelled into negotiating a
safe passage through the rest of his life, because the last thing he
needs is further publicity.
Of course, he will be the last to realise that and by then it will be
too late -- if it isn't already.

TAYSIDE Police have called for extendable batons, rigid handcuffs, and
body armour to combat attacks on officers. Chief Constable William
Spence yesterday told the region's police and fire committee that
assaults on police had risen by almost one third over the last year.
Mr Spence said that there had been 496 assaults in 1994 compared with
366 in 1993. The Tayside force want #47,000 to fund the measures.

A CREW member of the world's oldest operating wooden sailing ship, the
Maria Assumpta, died and two other were missing after she ran aground
and sank off the Camel estuary, north Cornwall, yesterday.
The body of a 50-year-old man was picked up from the sea after a
massive operation involving lifeboats, helicopters and local fishing
craft.
Eleven other crew members were recovered. A Falmouth coastguard
spokesman said hopes of finding the other two of the 137-year-old square
rigger's 14 crew were ''receding with each hour''. They could have
survived, but he suspected that they had gone down with the ship.
The 125-foot vessel broke up and sank in seas which pounded the rocks
off Pentire Point. Six survivors were brought to the top of the cliffs
by a winch operated by coastguard teams and five others were taken
aboard a fishing vessel, the Helen Clare.
A rescue helicopter from the Royal Naval Air Station at Culdrose and
lifeboats from Padstow, Port Isaac and Rock were on the scene, said
Falmouth coastguards.
The 127-ton Spanish-built brig originally operated on the
transAtlantic trade routes, and was maintained by a historical society
in Kent.

<TEXT>
CITY regulator the Securities and Futures Authority confirmed
yesterday that it has fined US investment bank Morgan Stanley #240,000
relating to derivatives deals for five clients in 1992.
''Morgan Stanley has admitted that in the manner in which it
organised, conducted and supervised foreign exchange business for five
private clients in 1992 it was in breach of SIB principles,'' the SFA
said. SIB is the Securities and Investments Board, another regulator.
The SFA said: ''The firm admits that contract notes were not sent to
the clients in respect of foreign exchange transactions, and statements
and valuations did not disclose the underlying transactions or the open
positions.''
Records available to management were not complete ''and the firm did
not adequately monitor the amount of margin which had to be paid by four
of the clients''.
In addition to the fine, Morgan Stanley has made a substantial payment
to cover SFA's costs.
A number of mitigating factors were taken into consideration by the
SFA. One was that the bank took over the clients' loss-making positions.
''This cost Morgan Stanley approximately $30m.''
The SFA said Morgan Stanley conducted an internal review and promptly
took steps to improve its procedures. It said a press release on the
fine had been delayed pending the outcome of disciplinary action against
a former Morgan Stanley employee, but newspaper reports yesterday meant
there was ''no point in further delay''.

A SEAL of approval was given to the Lloyd's of London restructuring
package yesterday when chairman David Rowland was given a round of
applause at the annual general meeting as he outlined the #2800m package
aimed at ending legal action against the insurance market.
The rowdy scenes which have characterised previous meetings failed to
materialise as this occasion was marked by a far more conciliatory mood.
Chief executive Peter Middleton said that on all sides there was a
unity of purpose and a determination to deal fairly with the past
problems of the whole society of Lloyd's and to free the market to
achieve its full potential for the future.
The settlement marks a long and protracted period of acrimony between
the Lloyd's ruling council and the Names, or investors, many of whom
face bankruptcy because of the huge losses incurred in past years.
Several of the Names wished Mr Rowland well in his latest plan to
solve the market's financial and legal problems. Sir David Berriman,
chairman of the influential Association of Lloyd's Names, told the
meeting that he supported the compensation package.
''I'm convinced that we are in the last chance saloon and, unless we
get this settlement, Lloyd's will go into run-off,'' he said.
However, amid the guarded optimism there was some criticism of the
proposed #200m contribution by Lloyd's agents to the compensation deal.
Some Names claimed that with an estimated #600m profits in the pipeline,
they could afford far more. Current Names, including new corporate
investors, will be asked to pay up to #900.
The package of proposals was put forward last week to wipe out losses
up to 1992 and end the stream of litigation brought by Names over
alleged negligence and corruption. The proposals will now be the subject
of detailed negotiations with all those involved. Names will have an
opportunity to vote on the final proposals in the autumn. If accepted,
they will take effect next spring with much of the money coming from
profits made since 1992.
''We have a great deal to do, but I believe there is a very good
chance of getting to the other side by spring 1996 if we seek the widest
possible consensus,'' said Mr Rowland. However, speaking to around 1600
Names in London, he warned that rejection of the compensation deal would
probably spell the end of Lloyd's.
In 1992, the last year for which accounts are available, Lloyd's made
a loss of #1200m taking the total of recent losses to more than #8000m.
The 1992 loss came in a year when the insurance market was hit by
natural disasters such as Hurricane Andrew which devastated parts of the
USA, and the IRA bombings at Bishopsgate and St Mary Axe in London. Mr
Rowland said 1992 marked the end of a ''period of serious losses'' with
hopes of a #1000m profit for 1993.

THE collapse of Glasgow-based engineering consultancy Gibson Wells
cost Babcock International an unexpected #3m on the Fushun power station
contract in China and led to full-year results being below most market
expectations -- albeit with a swinground from losses of #41.2m into a
#7.83m surplus.
The current year is also going to be hard graft with the new
management team under chairman Dr John Parker and chief executive Nick
Salmon still having to work through low-margin, and in some cases
zero-margin, contracts embarked upon two or three years ago.
But at least there is now a solid base under Babcock with the years of
cutback at an end and the possibility of the longer-term growth
programme coming through more quickly than expected.
The Babcock consortium, which includes the Bank of Scotland, Forth
Ports and ScottishPower, is the sole bidder for the Dockyard which could
cost #20m --perhaps spread over several years, although, following last
year's #79m rescue rights issue at 27p, cash is not a problem. A
decision is expected by the end of calendar 1995.
There is the return to the dividend list with a payment of 0.4p, while
the 845 million 10p shares in issue are to be consolidated into 169
million of 50p to result in a notional share price of 150p rather than
the near ''penny stock'' status of 30p they carry at present which does
not help in commercial negotiations.
Investor sentiment is driven chiefly by the two Scottish operations
with Renfrew-based energy activities suffering from higher-than-expected
costs and lower-than-hoped completion settlements for the Drax power
station desulphurisation contracts. These are effectively complete but
at #5m below hopes with some #20m of work to be finished in the current
year.
On June 6, Babcock formally signs two of the four Chinese boiler
contracts worth about #125m to it, although Mr Salmon was reluctant to
say how much would be sourced in Renfrew and how much elsewhere in the
EU as required by ECGD credit financing requirements.
The two anthracite power stations worth about #200m to the company
should be funded later in the year although no profits will be taken
until at least 25% of the work is completed to specification.
The workforce at Renfrew has been reduced over the years to just 700,
including 150 at the Technology Centre.
The Chinese successes could be a mixed blessing. They have been signed
at a relatively early period in that country's re-industrialisation
which has provided a welcome baseload of work. The concern is that
margins may be lower than what may be available in perhaps a couple of
years time when global boiler-making capacity may be fully utilised.
However, the energy division, which in 1994-95 lost #11.2m compared
with the preceding year's #54.3m which included massive provisions, will
still continue in the red this time round to the extent of perhaps #2m
or so.
Facilities management, which increased its contribution by #500,000 to
just under #11m, is politically the most intriguing.
The Rosyth Dockyard submarine-refitting contract should in theory
slowdown after the #100m HMS Superb is finished. But there are still the
rumours, although officially denied, that arch-rival Devonport is built
on geologically suspect ground and so Rosyth may, though natural causes,
be given additional work beyond that promised until 2000 by the MoD.
Another source of income for the 60%-owned Railcare subsidiary,
Siemens has the other 40%, will come from the agreement, still to be
finalised, to take over British Rail's workshops at Springburn in
Glasgow and at Wolverton in Warwickshire.
Materials handling saw a decline because of reorganisation costs in
Germany, while process was hit by negative returns from the Caldwell arc
furnace dust recycling operations in the US. The South African
activities have benefited from rationalisation and are now usefully
profitable with a #2.3m contribution.
The City is looking to around #19m-#20m for the current year and #30m
next and a dividend of 0.8p. That means that the stock is looking
somewhat expensive, trading at almost 20 times this year's earnings and
about 12 times those for 1996-97 and is almost certainly bid-proof apart
from a UK buyer because of the defence connotations.
The nub of the problem is that Babcock is too small with a market
capitalisation of #256m carrying an order book three times as big and it
needs to make significant acquisitions.

CURRENCY dealing was slow to gear up after the Bank Holiday weekend.
The dollar was stuck in a narrow trading range ahead of the publication
of a clutch of US economic data later this week.
Much attention will focus on Friday's labour market report which will
give a further guide to the extent of the slowdown in the US economy.
The dollar continues to derive some underlying support from
speculation of further cuts in German interest rates. Although this is
not expected to occur at tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting.
Meanwhile, sterling also traded narrowly in the absence of any
economic data. It remained unchanged on a trade-weighted basis at 84.0.
It was over 1[1/4] pfennigs better than the German mark at DM2.2232 but
was slightly easier against the dollar at $1.6015.

HOLLAND HOUSE yesterday formalised a #4.9m bid for Ferguson Marine,
the Port Glasgow shipbuilder, following the withdrawal of rivals --
Altnacraig Shipping and a management buyout team.
Holland House, a chain of electrical wholesale stores owned by ageing
millionaire Frank Dunnet, sent out letters to Ferguson's 290
shareholders offering them 406p per share.
Shareholders have until June 20 to accept the offer, which values
Ferguson at #1m more than its net asset value of #3.9m at the end of
last year.
But many would lose tax benefits which they currently enjoy under the
terms of a Business Expansion Scheme because they would be selling their
shares less than five years after they bought them in March 1991.
Ferguson's board said in a letter to shareholders that the Holland
House terms were ''fair and reasonable,'' but it stopped short of
endorsing the bid, noting that the net value of the offer could vary
significantly according to the individual.
Ferguson's chairman is Sir Ross Belch. He also controls Altnacraig
Shipping, which withdrew its own bid for the yard on May 2.
The Altnacraig offer was believed to consist of #3 in cash plus
several Altnacraig shares for each of the 1.2 million Ferguson shares.
But Altnacraig withdrew after a management buyout group dropped its own
bid to buy the shipyard in late April.
Frank Dunnet, who is his 80's, and his son Alan, who is managing
director of Holland House, were sailing their yacht in Loch Fyne
yesterday and were not immediately available for comment.
But Frank Dunnet said in his letter to shareholders that he wanted to
retain the shipyard's present management team.

WHEN British pop scribes hear the words ''multi-media'' and
''performance artist'', they reach for their poisoned quills. So you can
imagine music-press reaction when the six-date UK leg of Laurie
Anderson's Nerve Bible tour was announced as ''a multi-media performance
based on readings from Laurie's book, Stories from The Nerve Bible, as
well as songs, and an eye-popping array of sophisticated
computer-controlled visual effects, some of them 35ft high.''
A bastion of laddish bigotry, the New Musical Express was outraged.
Their news report of Laurie Anderson's first major tour in five years --
coming to Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on Saturday -- was pithy in the
extreme.
''Bonkers New York art-school intellectual explores her psyche with
expensive keyboards,'' it said.
Oh dear. If that's what folk at the NME think, that's their readers'
loss. O Superman: if only it hadn't become Laurie Anderson's pop
albatross, reaching No 2 in the British charts in October, 1981 . . . If
it hadn't, perhaps the NME wouldn't feel obliged to judge Laurie
Anderson by the same criteria it would apply to her random bedmates in
the pages of the Guinness Book of Hit Singles: Herb Alpert and Moira
Anderson.
Laurie Anderson doesn't fit in there. She doesn't fit in easily
anywhere. As heard on her current album, The Ugly One With The Jewels,
her laconic spoken-word narrations bracket her to the far left of
Garrison Keillor. Her previous music-based album, Bright Red, was
produced by ambient explorer Brian Eno, and focuses powerfully on
male-female relationships without once ever recalling the gauzy bluster
of Celine Dion.
It's not as though there's simply one Laurie Anderson voice, either,
given her repeated use of electronics to create a male Laurie Anderson
speaking-tone. And while there might have been some predictability about
her past vinyl liaisons with art-rocker Peter Gabriel and avant garde
novelist William Burroughs, there was surely none when she once employed
svelte funkateer Nile Rodgers, formerly of Chic, as her producer.
But if it's hard to divine in which category Laurie Anderson belongs,
it's easier to spot what shaped her as an artist. Born in Chicago, she
studied violin in her teens before moving to her spiritual home, New
York.
She earned degrees in art history and sculpture, and began performing
in public in 1973, in museums and galleries. Her first show, The Life
And Times Of Joseph Stalin, was 12 hours long. O Superman's eight
minutes were merely part of the seven-hour-long United States. Alongside
music, her work has always utilised technology at the cutting edge,
whether it be in graphics, sculpture, film, slides, lasers, and
lighting.
Indeed, the Nerve Bible tour has a cyberspace link in the shape of the
Green Room which is available to Netted-up computer literates on
http://www.voyagerco.com.
Yet despite continually embracing such audio-visual diversity, Laurie
Anderson's work is rooted very simply, in words and how we speak them.
It is here that she reveals what is most easily overlooked about her
work, particularly by those who will not see, ie NME hacks.
According to Rolling Stone magazine's J D Considine: ''Performance
artists are entertainers as much as they are artists, and in that
context, the skills Laurie Anderson most relies upon tend to be comedic
and not musical. Timing; inflection; wry observations and illuminating
non sequiturs; a sense of character that allows her to slip out of her
normal deadpan and into a believable secondary voice.''
These observations are echoed by Tom Rafferty, leader of Glasgow's
Beat Poets and a long-time observer of New York's art-rock scene. He
sees Laurie Anderson as ''a practical link between pop music and pop
theory, between musical practicality and ivory-tower theorising.
''As an example of what I mean, there's the classic Laurie Anderson
invention of a violin with a tape-playing head affixed to its bridge and
a violin-bow with a length of magnetic tape on it. When she draws the
bow over the violin, she's still playing the violin . . . but what you
hear is 'Language is a virus.' That's the phrase recorded on the tape,
which is being played back by the tape-head on the violin.
''And she can draw the bow faster, speeding up the phrase, or she can
make the phrase come out in stutters . . . and there you have an organic
link between traditional musical instruments and today's electronic
process of digital sampling.
''Another of her inventions is to have back-projections going on the
whole time she's on stage, but without a screen. The audience sees
nothing, but then she suddenly flips the white violin-bow through a
quarter of a circle in the place where the screen should be, thus
presenting you with a split-second image.
''I'm sure that Laurie Anderson is one of the few artists in the world
who will be regarded with equal importance by Yellow Magic Orchestra,
rigorous creators of Japanese techno-pop, and Sonic Youth's Thurston
Moore, the man who spotted Nirvana and without whom grunge might never
have happened. Similarly, those pioneers of electronic pop, Kraftwerk,
have always presented themselves as living in Kraftwerk-universe, but
there is one other name they've mentioned in interviews: Laurie
Anderson.
''Actually, it's in Laurie Anderson's use of technology that her
influence has been greatest. You won't hear bands or performers who
sound just like her in the same way that you can hear any number of
bands who sound obviously like the Beatles. Instead, in the same manner
as Kraftwerk, she applied cheap technology -- sequencers and sequencing
-- in contradiction of a doctrine which said that 'real rock' had
nothing to do with computers.
''At one time, plodding prunes like Queen would be cheered for
releasing albums with sleeves which proudly boasted: 'No synthesisers
were used in the production of this record.' Now, thanks in a roundabout
way to Laurie Anderson having pushed easily available
recording-technology to the limits, you've a vibrant form like jungle,
which is open to anybody with an Atari computer, three ideas, and no
preconceptions.
''Above all, Laurie Anderson defines a sense of Lower East Side cool
in the same way that Lou Reed maybe once did -- but unusually hers is
allied to a sense of fun. There's a fundamental impishness about her.
She doesn't want you to sit there thinking 'Hm, isn't this
intellectually stimulating'. She knows that you can be cerebral and
still have a sense of humour.''
Or in other words, if you choose to believe what the NME says about
Laurie Anderson, the joke's on you.

ACCORDING to Jack Black, the gab-gifted Glaswegian guru of positive
thinkers and the subject of BBC2's The Business this week: ''What I'm
really passionate about is that you do not have to be tomorrow who you
were yesterday.''
As the creator and course director of Mindstore, the leading British
personal development programme designed to combat stress and enhance
mental performance, Black is his own best example of the success of what
he preaches. Ten years ago he was operating an 80-hour week; balancing a
burgeoning home-grown business with his main job as a social worker.
These days, he works just as hard, with meetings and courses organised
all over the UK, and companies abroad clammering to sample Black's
apparent magic. The difference between then and now is that now, Black
can cope.
Jack Black was born in Easterhouse in 1955, and brought up in
Cumbernauld. He trained as a teacher (in technical subjects) at
Jordanhill College, before moving into social work in Possil. ''I was
interested in working with young people and community issues. I was a
bit of an activist, because I was interested in communities and
communities being empowered -- I suppose I still am.'' The job became a
labour of love, and Black's appetite for career advancement became a
voracious one. From Possil he went to Easterhouse, and then into
community education when he took over a promoted post at Easterhouse
Youth Centre. ''I had aspirations to climb the ladder. I wanted to get
myself fairly high up in the education department at Strathclyde
region.''
But halfway up the ladder, Black stopped and looked ahead. ''I was
involved in a project that attracted the attention of the assistant
director of education of the time and, through another project I was
doing, I met one of Her Majesty's Inspectors. Both of them had similar
beliefs to me. Then within a very short period of time, both of these
guys died suddenly and it made me wonder why. They were both young; only
in their 40s. I perceived that stress had had a role in killing them,
and that realisation caused me to question everything I was doing
because I could see myself going down the same road -- there was
unbelievable stress within the department.'' Rather than try a new
route, Black opted simply to get out, despite the fact that he was still
''totally committed'' to education.
Before quitting, however, Black cast about for another career. He set
up a business building on the success he had had in organising short ski
trips for friends and colleagues. This, plus his ongoing community work,
equalled an 80-hour week while he tried to find his feet and the
security of another job to fall back on when he left the department. But
one particular incident proved to be the catalyst for the change in his
lifestyle and direction: Black collapsed while visiting his barber's
shop, and diagnosed the blackout as stress-induced. He decided there and
then that investigating and controlling stress should be his next move.
''I went straight round the corner to John Smith's and asked for a
book on stress. They pointed to a stand and a book literally fell off
the shelf. I picked it up and it was an American book. To be honest, my
first reaction was 'American book -- throw it away', but on the back
cover, there were quotes from people who claimed that it had been
fundamentally important to them. One was Hot Lips Hoolahan (Loretta
Swit) from M*A*S*H -- and I was a fan of hers -- and the other was
Richard Bach who wrote Jonathan Livingston Seagull.''
Black bought, read, and absorbed the book (by Jose Silver), then
auditioned for and was trained by the American personal development
company which had produced it. After three years, they fell out over how
to develop the programme in Scotland, and Black is now reluctant to name
the company since he regards it as a rival to his own Mindstore, set up
when he went solo five years ago, and incorporating many of the same
ideas as the American system.
Mindstore's basic aims couldn't be simpler: to challenge attitudes and
make people think positively; to manage stress and to break out of
limiting beliefs. As he readily admits: ''There's nothing new about what
I'm doing, it's just the way it's packaged -- it's very Glasgow, very
UK.''
It's also very, very successful. The two core Mindstore programmes --
Mindstore for Business and the more general Mindstore for Life -- have
been taught to conferences of hundreds all over the UK (next stop: the
Pacific Rim) and the book of the course is being republished in hardback
and is set to appear on audio tape and on CD Rom.
Black is personally involved in every aspect of Mindstore, and takes
as many of the growing number of conferences as possible since, as he
points out: ''The product to some extent is me, and I'm very passionate
about it.'' No wonder. In the five years of heeding his own advice and
practising the relaxation techniques which he evolved himself, Black's
lifestyle has changed dramatically -- not only in terms of managing
stress. ''What I teach works. The people I meet, the stuff I have, the
car I drive, the holidays I take, the house, the boat . . . They're all
proof. I certainly could never have afforded the lifestyle I lead now
when I was a community officer.''
So has Black left the community behind in search of more likely
sources of the #200 (per person) it costs to attend one of his two-day
Mindstore for Life sessions? He claims, no: ''If the council or a
community group in Easterhouse came to me and asked me to do an event,
I'd do it tomorrow as long as there was an audience because I know the
community would be empowered by what I teach. I'd do that genuinely and
I'd do it in a minute''.

STAND by for the launch, next weekend, of Glasgow's newest concert
venue. The name: Adelaide's -- The Place. The location: Adelaide Place
Baptist Church in Bath Street, near Charing Cross.
It's almost a paradox that, as recession and general financial
insecurity have bitten deep into the arts in central Scotland during the
past decade, with some of our major organisations -- as we speak --
continuing to struggle for survival, there have been a striking number
of growth areas within the industry.
Look at the new groups and musical companies which have sprung into
existence within the period -- the Hebrides Ensemble, the Chamber Group
of Scotland, Opera on a Shoestring, Scottish Voices, the Rachmaninov
Trio, to name but five. Their success, of course, varies: some operate
on a small scale; others have achieved national recognition with their
names already embedded in the public imagination. That they have taken
root and taken flight at all in the prevailing climate is remarkable.
But even more remarkable, and another element in the same paradox, is
the almost restless exploration of new performance spaces and the
discovery of new venues in which to house the arts, especially in
Glasgow. While this phenomenon, too, extends back more than a decade, it
has undoubtedly accelerated since the annus mirabilis of 1990, when
Glasgow was European City of Culture and the city reeled from the impact
of an explosion of activity in a staggering range of venues.
Some of these were existing and had other functions; some were
conversions; others were disused. The litany is long and includes
Hutchesons' Hall in Ingram Street, the Merchants' House in West George
Street, the Trades House in Glassford Street, the Tramway, the great
industrial carcass of the Harland and Wolff engine shed in Govan, and a
whole swathe of churches from St Andrew's in the Saltmarket to St
Aloysius' in the city centre, from St Vincent de Paul in Thornliebank to
the highly successful Cottier Theatre in Hyndland.
There's a yarn attached to almost all of these. But few could match,
in sheer originality and imaginativeness, the background to the
development of the latest, Adelaide's -- The Place, whose inaugural
concert a week on Sunday will be given by a Scottish select, an
orchestra formed from members of the leading Scottish bands under the
direction of conductor Marco Romano.
A few years back, the congregation of Adelaide Place Baptist Church
faced a dilemma. Their church was falling into disrepair; dry rot was
not the least of the problems. They faced a simple and stark option: get
out or stay put; sell the building to a property developer or find
another solution that would allow the refurbishment and preservation of
the church and its function.
They chose the latter course, motivated wholly by the fact that
Adelaide Place Church was the last Baptist congregation in the city
centre, and they felt they had to stay there to meet their obligation to
the community.
So a remarkable vision was developed within the congregation itself.
They formed their own development company and set about working up a
plan for a conversion that would preserve the spiritual, Christian
function of the church while developing it as a social and commercial
amenity.
The original plan, apparently, was to convert part of the building
into office and cafe space. But, as occasionally happens with the best
visions, the plan took wing. And last week -- after development work
costing #1.2m provided by the Glasgow Development Agency, Historic
Scotland, the Bank of Scotland, the Baptist Union, and individual
contributors -- the results were unveiled to a fanfare of trumpets.
The new, and trendily-named, Adelaide's -- The Place, comprises the
church hall itself, now doubling as an elegant concert hall (slightly
reminiscent of Edinburgh's Queen's Hall) seating up to about 500, a cafe
(in operation since May 1 and adorned with a 13-feet tall tree sculpture
commissioned by the church and featuring some of the original pipes from
the church organ), an eight-room guest house, and a pre-school nursery.
The guest house -- tastefully-decorated, and priced from #39 per room
-- aims to be competitive. The nursery, which will be staffed by
fully-qualified teachers and nursery nurses, will accommodate up to 40
pre-school children and is aimed directly at city centre workers: an
alternative to creche or nanny schemes.
The concert hall itself is equipped with a new baby grand piano,
donated by an anonymous benefactor. Before the hall is even launched, it
is attracting interest. Behind the scenes (and possibly because of
competitive hire rates) a number of organisations are making inquiries.
These include the Glasgow Orchestral Society, the Glasgow Symphony
Orchestra, the Phoenix Choir and the John Currie Singers. Several have
already booked the venue.
Conductor Marco Romano has a double interest. He will take charge of
the 65-piece orchestra -- drawn from the Royal SNO, the Orchestra of
Scottish Opera, the BBC SSO, and well-known freelances -- at the launch
concert a week on Sunday. For the occasion -- a charity concert to raise
funds for Oxfam -- all performers will be donating their services.
The programme, Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man, Walton's The Wise
Virgins, and Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, will also feature a performance of
Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music with 16 vocal soloists (all
well-known names, many familiar from Scottish Opera or Opera on a
Shoestring).
With all these forces, it will, said Romano, be a tight squeeze.
''Generally speaking, I'd say we'd get an orchestra of 55 in there; it
is ideal for a chamber orchestra.'' Romano also envisages that
Adelaide's will be suitable for a range of musical activities: ''I'm
thinking of chamber-style concerts, of chamber opera, of cabaret nights
and Viennese balls,'' said Romano, donning his other hat as businessman
and entreprenueur.
Marco Romano runs his own company, Performance Plus, which sets up
performances -- especially in rural areas -- and is also a consultancy
service providing advice and instrumentalists for weddings, corporate
functions, and a range of entertainments.
In this capacity, Romano is currently in negotiation with Adelaide's
to stage several series of concerts in the new venue. These are likely
to be a set of lunchtime concerts in August, and a larger series of
evening concerts in the autumn featuring string quartets, vocal groups,
and chamber opera.
But that's for the future. First, the inaugural concert. At the
official opening of Adelaide's last week, Ian Grant, chairman of the
Scottish Tourist Board, described the entire venture as ''an inspired
idea'' that has seen the ''transformation of a very dramatic building
into a place for worship, a place of sleep, a place for fun, and for
music and the arts''. As far as the latter is concerned, watch this
space.
* Opening concert, Adelaide's -- The Place, 209 Bath Street, Sunday,
June 11, 7.30pm. Tickets from Ticket Centre, Candleriggs.

THIRTY-THREE years ago, Chichester Festival Theatre opened its doors
to the public for the first time. Headed by the premier actor of his
day, Sir Laurence Olivier, it was, by any standards, a golden age and a
blueprint for the National Theatre then under construction on London's
South Bank.
Since then, under various artistic directors, it has enjoyed a
chequered reputation, safely orthodox but often dismissed by
metropolitan Londoners for its unremarkable diet of classic revivals.
This year, however, with what may prove to have been inspired vision
on the part of the theatre board, Chichester has a new joint
directorship. West End producer Duncan Weldon, known for a retinue of
sometimes eccentrically star-studded but also vintage revivals (Dustin
Hoffman in The Merchant of Venice, as an example of the former, Helen
Mirren and John Hurt in A Month in the Country as an example of the
latter), is joined by arguably one of the finest actors of his
generation, Sir Derek Jacobi.
They have put together what looks like an extraordinary season -- one
that includes actors such as Leo McKern and Ian Richardson lured back to
the stage after long absences, Honor Blackman and Dora Bryan in School
for Scandal, Penelope Keith and Keith Michell in a new absurdist French
comedy but also a stream of new plays by some fairly sturdy names --
Alan Ayckbourn, Ronald Harwood and Ronald Hayman, not to mention Harold
Pinter in one of his own, rarely performed plays, The Hothouse. There's
also Lauren Bacall to look forward to in a revival of Durrenmatt's The
Visit at the end of the season.
The return of Jacobi, a newcomer to the art of theatre directorship,
has a neat historical symmetry about it. For Jacobi, along with such
other ''raw'' recruits as Maggie Smith, Frank Finlay, Albert Finney,
Geraldine McEwan, Ronald Pickup, John Stride and Jeremy Brett, was part
of the Olivier brood in those early Chichester seasons.
''I was so in awe then of 'Sir','' he now recalls. ''Now here I am
back doing his job. It's an odd feeling, but a nice one.'' A nice
restitution, too, of the actor-manager tradition.
In the way of these things however, it's not Jacobi's
leading-from-the-front broadside in Peter Luke's Hadrian VII that stands
out so far in the season. (Jacobi turns up later in the season in a new
play about Strindberg, Playing the Wife.) That belongs to the two other
opening hands -- Frank Hauser's revival of Harold Brighouse's
affectionate warhorse of a play, Hobson's Choice, with Leo McKern and
Nichola McAuliffe, and Ronald Harwood's absorbing new end-of-war drama,
Taking Sides, with Michael Pennington and Daniel Massey.
Though written 70 years ago and set in the 1880s, Brighouse's play is
still remarkably enduring with its story of Maggie, the 30-year-old
unmarried daughter of a Salford shoe-shop owner taking matters, and her
life, into her own hands by marrying one of her father's workmen and
making both a man and stirring entrepreneurial force out of him.
Hauser's production and McAuliffe's beadily sharp performance as
Maggie make the play freshly and warmly resonant as an expression of
pragmaticism rewarded. McAuliffe and Graham Turner's declaration of
mutual pride in each other is overwhelming.
If Hobson's Choice is a play that pretty much signals its intentions
from the beginning, in contrast, Harwood's Taking Sides in the Minerva,
keeps its audience on tenterhooks right up to the final moment. Set in
Berlin in 1946, its central theme of art versus politics revolves around
the cross-examination by the Allies of the great German conductor,
Wilhelm Furtwangler.
Harwood delicately digs away at the fabric of what constitutes art,
culture and guilt in a marvellously poised emotional and intellectual
clash between Daniel Massey's upright, self-confessedly ''naive''
Furtwangler and Michael Pennington's boorish American interrogator,
Major Arnold (Furtwangler is just a ''band-leader'' to him) -- a man
seared for ever by his experience of the concentration camps and for
whom all Germans by implication are now guilty.
Keeping our sympathies swinging first one way then the next, Taking
Sides asks serious questions about civilisation and barbarity in the
context of winners and losers of the last war, but comes up with no easy
answers. Scrupulously directed by Harold Pinter, it has superb
performances from both Massey and Pennington and a first-rate supporting
cast.

IT'S a sure sign of quality when a work emerges triumphantly in a
staging that is radically different from the traditional. The Mikado is
110 years old, and, as the Hot Mikado, has just arrived at the Queens
Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, London. Here is Gilbert and Sullivan's
comic opera reborn as a terrific musical.
The show comes to us from Ford's Theatre, Washington, USA. Adaptor,
director and choreographer David H. Bell has fashioned it after the
style of a previous, though now lost, Hot Mikado presented on Broadway
in 1938 by master showman Billy Rose.
Two members of Bell's Washington cast are here in London. Ross Lehman,
in a performance possibly inspired by Eddie Foy Jr in the Pajama Game,
makes Ko-Ko an endearing clown, a mixture of cleverness and ineptitude.
His Tit-willow song would melt the bravest heart. Sharon Benson's
wonderfully voluptuous, splendidly sung Katisha couldn't keep a straight
face -- nor could the audience. The other American in the cast was
Lawrence Hamilton. His imposing, charismatic Mikado owes a lot to
another toe-tapping performer, Cab Calloway. The young lovers are much
more positive than in some other productions: Paul Manuel is an ardent
Nanki-Poo and Paulette Ivory is a studiedly artless Yum-yum.
Richard Lloyd King contributes a winningly funny Caribbean
Lord-High-Everything as Poohbah and Alison Jiear is a superb Ethel
Merman-like Pitti-Sing.
There is a simple, traditional set and some bright costumes, plus a
lively chorus of singers and dancers who are full-throated and
energetic. Hot Mikado is a syncopated jazzy musical, a highly welcome
delight.

IN a kirk as atmospheric as St John's, and in acoustics so appropriate
to the music, John Currie wisely played no tricks on Monday with The
Burning Fiery Furnace, the second of Britten's three church parables,
and the second he has staged at Perth. Sticking quite closely to the
original Aldeburgh scenario, he used the resources of Perth Festival
Opera to create a performance that focused firmly on the confrontation
between glittering Babylon and the three steadfast Jewish exiles whom
Nebuchadnezzar condemns to death.
Though Britten intended the Old Testament story to be relevant ''to
our own times'', he deliberately avoided any sort of fashionable
updating, and Currie respected this aspect of a work that speaks
perfectly clearly for itself. The processions of monks and acolytes, the
ceremonial robing and masking of the main actors for the play within a
play, the ritual gestures all made their point movingly and naturally.
Words were very clear -- much clearer than at Aldeburgh 30 years ago
-- and Currie's resourceful ideas for the (excellent) boy entertainers
skilfully avoided the moments of profound embarrassment that had
occurred on that previous occasion. The slow march of the
instrumentalists round the church, their vivid timbres dominated by an
obscenely braying alto trombone, was a passage of high drama.
James Paterson's centralised set, a raised golden scaffold topped by a
brilliantly unfurled image of paganism, was apt. Christopher Hobkirk's
volatile Nebuchadnezzar, costumed in gawdy Versace-like scarlets and
golds, and Alan Watt's sombre, dangerous Astrologer were strikingly
contrasted characterisations. As the three Jews wearing Chartres blue --
the colours of Chartres Cathedral were a source of Britten's inspiration
-- George Gordon, Peter Alexander-Wilson, and Michael Leigh were equally
telling as the aliens amid the Babylonian splendour. Richard Evans sang
the Herald's music incisively.
Of all John Currie's contributions to the Perth Festival, this has
been quite the best and most assured. Two more performances, tonight and
tomorrow.

ARTHUR MILLER's most recent play, which explores the reaction of
Brooklyn youths to the Nazi terror released by Kristalnacht in 1938 has
an added poignancy in light of contemporary events, with the hostage
situation in Bosnia acting as a jolt to the world about the consequences
of lack of intervention. This play, performed by the National Theatre,
is primarily an indictment of failure to confront -- and act on -- the
distasteful reality of the truth.
Hinged on Dr Harry Hyman's amateurish psychological exploration of
Sylvia Gellburg, who has been stricken with hysterical paralysis after
reading of Kristalnacht, it is a portrait of a New York recovering from
the impact of the Depression where everyone seems at a loss as to their
societal position.
Sylvia's husband Philip -- impeccably played by Henry Goodman --
boasts of being the only Jew employed by a waspish property company,
while Hyman, ostensibly a more attractive and relaxed character
(although portrayed with more reserve by Matthew Marsh than Ken Stott's
quirky London performance) nurses similar hang-ups in his defensive
insistence that the Germans are a civilised race.
The narrative focuses on the Gellburg's sexless marriage, but Miller
always contexturalises this within wider issues -- American Jews' mixed
feelings about their cultural heritage (repression of Jewishness
symbolised by Philip's long-term impotence) and the subtle repression of
women within marriage.
Beautifully scripted, the production is full of dreadful silent
resonances, which are only voiced through the anguished keening of a
cello. The final image has a cliched inevitability but is a perfect
fusion of the play's exploration of reconciliation and futility.

NOW that more and more people understand the powers of repressed guilt
and shame, at personal, family, and collective levels, and are thereby
enabled to overcome them, the days of the Union are numbered. So writes
William Wolfe, sometime leader of the Scottish National Party, in a
letter replying to remarks of mine in a Herald review of an impressive
new book on the political background to 1707*.
One thing the book went to show was that there had been no outrage on
the Scottish people 300 years ago, which it was incumbent on their
modern descendants to requite. I think this was a fair conclusion from
what the authors had to say. To that extent, I was only their messenger.
Wolfe will be able to judge for himself when he comes to read their
work. But meanwhile he gives, for all his saintliness, a reaction common
among politicians faced with messengers who bear unwelcome tidings; he
wants to shoot them.
Before going on, I should say that Wolfe is wrong to see among those
authors, or in me, a hardline defence of the Union. The authors, so far
as their personal views are known to me, cover a spectrum of opinion on
the national question. My own heresies have prompted the Scottish
Conservative Party to express its official disapproval of me, and try to
ban me from canvassing for it.
As I originally pointed out, the book anyway steers a middle course
between two interpretations of the Union which are untenable, because
they do not fit the facts. On the one hand is what might be called the
received wisdom, seldom questioned till recent times, that the Union was
an entirely Good Thing, so good that it must have sprung from a
superhuman ability to foresee and understand the future among the
statesmen who drew up the treaty between Scotland and England. This is,
of course, pure tosh.
To question it, and without much difficulty to explode it, has been
the healthy reaction of a younger generation of historians. It was
healthy, at least, till it went to the opposite extreme, to argue that
the Union was a piece of unutterable wickedness, so outrageous in
Wolfe's sense as to be only explicable by the operation of the basest
motives, by bribery and betrayal. Such is the interpretation set out,
for example, in the copious works of Paul Scott.
Here the development of the argument turns more interesting. If the
Union was so monstrous, how come no ''general uprising'' took place
against it? Scots, after all, have never been notably reluctant to rise
up in defence of what is near and dear to them. At the end of the Union
which Wolfe can discern they will indeed rise and be a nation again.
What on earth has stopped them, then, these 300 years? What is stopping
them now? The answer is easy to the point of being glib: guilt, shame,
and repression, perhaps with a little help from academic essays and book
reviews.
There is, heaven knows, enough guilt, shame, and repression about in
Scotland. But surely they spring from the most authentic artefact of the
Scottish people, from Calvinist religion. In 1707 that was what they
struggled hardest to preserve, presumably to carry on feeling as guilty,
ashamed, and repressed as before. The Union made no difference.
It did make a big difference to Scottish politics, but that has always
operated in a different sphere. I once wrote a whole book of my own on
this theme, called Patronage and Principle, which I equally commend to
Wolfe's attention. It showed how there are occasional eruptions of
principle into Scottish politics, generally of an affronted, indignant,
and quite impracticable kind. Since they can get nowhere, they soon
pass.
Then we revert to the real business of Scottish politics, which has
nothing to do with the state of grace, with moral perfection or
redemption. It belongs, on the contrary, to the fallen world, where
compromising deals are struck, where patronage from above is exchanged
for subservience from below. Of course it is corrupt, but it was all
ordained by an inscrutable deity, so we may as well get on and enjoy it.
Everything goes indeed to show that modern Scotland does enjoy living
off subsidies from other people.
Our system of government embodies this mentality. It was largely built
by and for the Labour Party, but the Tories defend it too: Ian Lang's
big stick against devolution is the threat that subsidies will be
withdrawn. Not that Nationalists go far out of their way to dissent.
Their practical response, their policy prescription, every time a social
or economic problem comes along is that London should spend more money
on it. Wolfe's letter shows why: Scotland is a victim, so the English
owe us a living.
Of course this supplicant position can be contrasted with some
eventual ideal, where existing relationships will be dissolved and
replaced by what Wolfe calls ''a new and dignified partnership''. But
the more vigorous rattling of the begging bowl has always struck me as a
very strange preparation for throwing it away. If anything, it tries to
project on to the English a guilt and shame which they evidently cannot
feel confronted with a lot of whingeing Jocks. In other words,
responsibility lies anywhere but with us.
Nationalists themselves accept that independence for a small country
is always a relative concept. I would go further and say that it is as
much a state of mind as a constitutional condition. Wolfe's state of
mind, the state of mind that his party as yet reinforces, is one of
dependence. That is why he cannot understand Scottish history, nor
ultimately Scotland herself.

Union of 1707.

FILE under Pull the Other One: Ted Turner, the man who founded CNN,
''colorised'' classic black and white movies, and married the
preposterous Jane Fonda, has been confessing to the Independent that bad
news is good for business.
''It's the truth,'' he said. ''Our ratings are higher whenever there's
a disaster. But I would rather have lower ratings and lower profits and
live in a prosperous, happy, kind and loving world.''
Small fact: last year the news division of Turner Broadcasting System
Inc cleared $670m.
Techno-measles
WE shouldn't be too hard on the Indie, of course. Not so very long ago
the wizards who put together the paper's technology page were doing the
public a service by warning computer users of a lethal new virus named
''Good Times''.
As techno-measles went, this one was a real stinker. Contractible
through e-mail, the virus would have your hard disk for breakfast before
you could say ''megabyte''. Only by executing the electronic version of
a crash dive and switching your machine off smartish, claimed the
boffins, was there a chance to prevent highly important computer games,
historic expenses claims, and the like going down the stank.
This sounded awful, but more awful still, at least for those who
pontificate for the Indie, was what every on-line user, save people who
watch too much Star Trek, has known for a year, and what the US National
Computer Security Association has just confirmed: ''Good Times'' is a
hoax, and a dumb one.
As even the humblest nerd knows, viruses are programs and messages are
just messages -- one of which, we must hope, has finally got through to
the Independent (now only 30p).
Hook, line and
virtual sinker
LET NO-ONE say all computers are a blight on mankind, however. The
Japanese have just come up with a computer-aided fishing simulator. What
could be more useful? If (it says here) you work your electronic rod and
reel properly, simulated fish on a video monitor can be ''caught''. If
you miss them, fail to ''feed'' them, or even forget to change the
virtual water, the fish die.
Doesn't say what they're like with chips though.
Spooky epistles
WONDERS and viruses aside, there is a growing school of thought which
suggests that e-mail is pretty virulent in itself. Or is the Diary alone
in having received several spooky messages in recent months from what
appears to be a little old lady in the American Midwest who insists on
calling us Bob? This is strange enough, given that we have received the
epistles on the CompuServe service (''It sure was good to talk to you
last week'') despite their having been despatched to good old Bob
(''Ain't these computers amazing though?'') via America On-line. Even
we, in our profound ignorance, grasp that this really shouldn't happen.
Stranger still, however, is the thought of what Mom (we like to think
or her as Mom) would make of it all. There she is, the dear, innocently
sending intimate news of the family (''Sis is feeling a whole lot better
now'') to a total stranger on the other side of the world.
What, in this new world, is the etiquette? Do we write back and say
how pleased we are to hear that Pop is up and about but we're not
actually in Seattle, sleepless or otherwise, and we'd prefer not to
answer to Bob, thank you Madam? Or do we allow her to go on thinking, as
she wipes away a tear and slings another batch of cookies into the
stove, that her only son has become an unfeeling brute who never gets in
touch?
And what then (this is better than Neighbours) of Jodie and the kids?
Will they visit come Thanksgiving? Did little Susie like her birthday
present? Is good old Pop really as sick as we think he is? Thus far
we've not had the heart to break it to Mom. In fact, if the cookies are
up to scratch, we may even put ourselves up for adoption.
Late news
MISTAKEN identity is not so very uncommon, of course, even in the real
world. This week the Guardian published a little item on Brian Behan,
brother to Brendan and to Dominic in which, en passant, the writer
stated authoritatively that Brian and Dom had not spoken in years.
Dominic, possibly the only man we'll ever meet capable of reciting
entire pages of Finnegan's Wake while in his cups, once explained to us
the abstruse political reasons for the rift. These are now lost in the
mists of time. Then again, so is Dom, who has been dead these several
years past.
Fittingly enough, the item appeared in a series entitled Pass Notes.
With information like this, chaps, a C minus is the best you can hope
for.
Where there's
smoke . . .
IN CELEBRATION of International Passive Non-Inhaling Day, or whatever
it's called, we bring news that India is now the cheapest place on earth
in which to smoke yourself to death. According to a recent government
study, air pollution in New Delhi has become so bad that each of the
city's 10 million inhabitants inhales the equivalent of 20 fags a day.
Unfiltered, naturally.
Meanwhile, we hear of at least one politician still to set an example
and quit the devil weed. In a bitter exchange with opposition parties,
New South Wales treasurer Michael Egan has this week angrily denied
claims that he was spotted purchasing ''large quantities'' of cigarettes
shortly before announcing a whopping increase in tobacco duties.
Mr Egan is trying to quit, and was much miffed by the canard. We
suggest he switches to exhaust pipes.
Medicinal
compound
THERE ARE worse vices than smoking, believe it or not. News just in
states that three devout souls in Thailand have become seriously ill
after eating soil from a temple compound alleged to possess magical
therapeutic powers.
The fad began when a Buddhist abbot claimed he had dreamt of a god
descending and turning the soil into a miracle cure. According to
habitual users, however, the three made the mistake of taking their muck
straight.
The done thing, it seems, is to mix it with water. Dirt cheap at any
price.
Still with Thailand and strange potions, we hear that a gentleman
named Perm Suttimusik, 76, committed suicide after all 17 wives of his
harem deserted him. Police suggested that Perm lost his potency due to
the effects of a herbal brew of which he had become fond.

HAVE no fear. The general confusion, threshing around, and shouting of
contradictory assertions over Bosnia is just as great in Washington as
it is in Brussels, Paris or London. Everyone knows the present crisis is
the direct consequence of the pusillanimity of the Western powers over
the past four years, and no-one has the faintest idea what to do.
Consider the New York Times. Its first leader this morning asserts,
''Every effort must be made to save the UN mission, with additional
troops from countries currently involved in UN ground operations and a
prudent redeployment of the most exposed troops into less vulnerable
positions.'' I suppose that means the British and French ''must'' send
in more troops to extricate those already there, and peacekeepers must
be gathered together to withstand siege successfully.
But then the paper goes on, ''That redeployment must not be achieved
at the cost of abandoning the besieged civilians in (the eastern
enclaves). Nor can the Administration allow it to lead to the
introduction of American ground troops.''
The first of those two prescriptions is a nonsense. ''Redeployment''
means getting out of the way -- which by definition means abandoning
Srebrenica and the rest to their fate. The paper doubtless understands
that; the second clause is the key one.
Never, ever, allow Americans to get themselves chained to fences in
Bosnia, never allow any Americans to be killed. No wonder Secretary of
State Warren Christopher is finding the going rough in Brussels. The
British, French, and all the others are confronting the appalling
prospect the Americans faced in Tehran in 1979, with their men held
hostage by a savage and unscrupulous enemy.
A few American officials have been dropping hints that the 2000
Marines sent to the Adriatic over the weekend might be available to
stage a rescue. Some people never learn. Jimmy Carter tried it in April
1980. The rescue team got as far as a desert in central Iran, where they
crashed their helicopters and abandoned the effort. Carter then lost the
presidential election.
The Serbs will doubtless release the hostages for a promise that Nato
will not bomb them again. It would be a total humiliation for the UN,
Nato, and every government involved, but the Serbs are quite capable of
sticking to the demand.
The French want to regroup UNPROFOR. The peacekeepers would be
gathered together in a few well-defended positions. Marines and French
troops in Lebanon in 1983 were reduced to encampments from which they
could observe but could not intervene, save by calling in air strikes.
At least the Serbs seem disinclined to gives their lives for the cause:
there will be no suicide bombers driving up UN positions as the holy
martyrs in Lebanon attacked the infidels there.
After that, Hizbollah dropped mortar shells into the American
emplacements from time to time, the Americans and French bombed the
hills. Then they gave up and went home, early in 1984 (President Reagan
announced that the Marines were being ''redeployed to the fleet''),
leaving the Lebanese to fight it out.
The conclusion is that if you want to achieve a particular end, you
must be prepared to pay the price. If we want to force the Serbs to
accept the partition plan, we must be ready to force them to do so.
Messing around with peacekeepers or mounting a bombing raid once a year
will merely enrage the Serbs without affecting their behaviour in the
slightest.
We are told the peacekeepers' mission is to feed the hungry and
protect the defenceless. In fact, these missions are incompatible. Food
convoys get through only with the acquiescence of all the local forces.
Protecting the helpless means being prepared to fight those who threaten
them.
Brussels is a strange place where these self-evident truths need to be
spelt out. Here's another: diplomacy has failed. And don't say that
sanctions against Serbia are going to do the trick.
The United States has enforced sanctions against Cuba for 35 years,
against Libya for three, and against Iran for 15. Don't expect any
results from Serbian sanctions in any shorter period.
The Lebanese civil war did eventually come to an end. True, that
result was partly because Syria occupied a large part of the country and
brought the factions under control. No-one can say how the Bosnian war
would end, or the war between Croatia and Serbia, if the world washed
its collective hands and left them to it.
But that's what's going to happen. The latest fiasco, in which the
West, under American urging, played its ace and bombed Serbian arms
depots, and the Serbs then trumped the ace by taking hostages, has just
advanced the timing by a few months.
There is an old American saying: ''If you're in a hole, stop
digging.''

TICKLED fuschia last week to hear that Glasgow's infamous
fun-frustrating curfew curse is to come to an end, we rushed off to
celebrate. Joy unconfined: we were so delighted we could have danced in
the streets, and sure enough there was a hop of sorts, as we ended up
jumping up and down in rage in Sauchiehall Street at 12.31am. The great
liberation does not begin until next month, and the bouncers at our
favoured venue were enforcing the current curfew with unbribable
righteousness.
So there we were, stranded in the street, a group of young Glaswegians
trying to entertain some English visitors with little more than a
promise of a game of Trivial Pursuit and a mug of hot chocolate.
Seething, and cursing Glasgow District Council's licensing board, we
were at least relieved that an end to such killjoy fiascos seems in
sight, if only a partial end, as only the clubs which have complied with
the council's recommendations will be exempt which, grudgingly, seems
fair enough.
This loosening of the 12.30am noose might not seem like that big a
deal in the grand scheme of things, but for those of us unfettered with
responsibilities, anxious to party every weekend where and when we
choose, it's been a major issue.
On the evening in question we'd only met up an hour earlier as many of
us, yours truly included, had had to work late. One mate had just met
his London girlfriend off a late train and they were particularly vexed
at their evening being cut short.
Like a group of malcontent adolescents berating the lack of a youth
club, we milled hopelessly about, scuffed our shoes then repaired to
someone's flat for an evening of ranting and raving, assuring our gloomy
English friends that t'was not always so. Glasgow was once an exciting
place to be.
In the early nineties, when many of my age-group were making decisions
about where to follow their careers, Glasgow seemed like a cool place to
hang out; professional opportunities were complemented by a happening
lifestyle. Glasgow's music scene, its fashion and its nightlife, not
only rivalled, but often surpassed, that of any city in the UK.
The curfew put a dampener on that, limiting options, circumscribing
personal choice, and taking the hoot out of being a night owl. Night
owls hatch in teenage years, encouraged by a student lifestyle which
necessitates hurried all-night sessions to complete last-minute work. In
the past, this nocturnal existence rapidly retreated in the face of a
9-5 worklife, but in these days of increased self-employment, home
working, and flexi-time, many young folk's body clocks have gradually
ticked towards a life after dark.
Glasgow might have closed its doors, Cinderella style, but that
night-time trend has been reflected throughout the rest of the country
-- with late night garage shops, the appearance of American service
stores, and through-the-night television.
The dark hours have always had a dangerous allure. Admittedly, sundown
signals nefarious activities, from Hollywood ''fright in the night''
spooky goings on to the more unsavoury ''real life'' activities of
muggers, burglars, and rapists.
None the less, night time has always held romantic appeal;
star-crossed lovers traditionally keep trysts under the cloak of
darkness, which has also provided shade for all manner of rebellious
behaviour, from Guy Fawkes politicking to the giggly midnight feasts of
the St Claire and Malorey Towers schoolgirl gluttons.
Forget class differentials, society can be divided into the early
birds and the night owls; the party poopers and the party animals. Early
birds rise with the starlings and tackle life with gusto. They
participate in bizarre rituals, like breakfast, and their clothes are
always ironed. Now that's spooky. They spend the day righteously ticking
off items on ready-prepared lists and their lives are a tribute to order
-- and dullness.
Night owls, on the other hand, don't so much attack the day ahead as
rise at noon and make a half-hearted stab at it. However, while the
early birds' zest diminishes just as things start to get exciting -- a
famous example is the Queen who, on the publication of Richard Olivier's
memoirs last week is reported to have nodded off during the Royal
National Theatre's inaugural production -- night owls come into their
own when daylight disappears.
Thrilling to the illicit memory of a bleary-eyed Santa Claus vigil; of
a stolen Hogmanay elderberry wine; of an exhilarating teenage triumph;
we relish after-hours adventure.
But enjoying the evening hours is not all about dissolute decadence.
It's not all a touch of Saturday night fever. Sometimes it's more a case
of being night beaver.
The restful hours of the night can be an ideal time to work,
undisturbed by phone calls or friendly, if unobtrusive, visits, and
definitely untantalised by that through the night television, which
transpires to be an unappetising menu of programmes composed of film
trailers, cheap culinary crap, vintage made-for-TV movies and job-search
Ceefax. Oh to party.

I AM confused by Nina MacAulay's logic which opposes a minimum wage of
#4 per hour (May 26). She describes conditions for business in the
Highlands as being unable to afford to pay this figure and using
students (school students?) instead of ''adult staff''.
Surely as long as the Highlands continue this they will, year after
year, see the loss of their most valuable asset, their young people. I
am amazed she can describe a community living ''a hand-to-mouth
existence'' on poverty wages, unemployment, and where children are
exploited to allow small, and sometimes not so small, businesses to
profit as living ''cheerfully''.
A statutory national minimum wage starting around #4 an hour (still
well below the accepted decency threshold) would actually benefit local
economies like the Highlands by increasing the spending power of local
low-paid workers. Someone earning #3.50 an hour given an extra 50p is
not going to stash it away in foreign investments. They will spend it
locally, in the businesses Nina MacAulay refers to.
She is concerned that council tax may have to increase (along with
Government support to councils) to ensure that council staff are paid
the still-not-decent rate of #4. This kind of wealth redistribution is
precisely what is required to tackle the increasingly huge gaps between
the rich and poor in this country.
It would also cut the amount of money required to be spent on welfare
benefits to top up the existing poverty wages, in reality a subsidy to
low-paying employers. And does Nina MacAulay really begrudge a school
cleaner, a road sweeper, a domestic in an old people's home the dignity
of a reasonable wage?
Far from being a burden on the community a national statutory minimum
wage would be a tremendous step forward for the people of Scotland where
low pay continues to be endemic and a blight upon thousands of decent
working people.

THE Churches are very concerned about the ever-decreasing Sunday
congregations: official statistics of the Catholic Church calculate the
drop in Sunday mass attendance at 3% a year. Many interpret the
phenomenon as a loss of faith, but somehow I feel that the shortage of
jobs in Scotland is still driving many Scots to seek ''pastures new''
outside their own country.
Emigration from Scotland in the eighteenth century is well-documented
with a farming community building new lives in Nova Scotia, America, New
Zealand, Australia, etc. The Scottish emigrant not only contributed to
the prosperity of his adopted land: he also sowed the seeds of his faith
in his new environment and contributed to very strong church communities
in his new land.
The statistics of the Registrar-General for Scotland prove beyond
reasonable doubt a tidal wave of emigration from Scotland since 1948,
when the population was 5.2 million. Since births exceed deaths in the
Scottish statistics, the population today should be over 7 million. The
present population of just over 5 million is adequate proof that
Scotland is a country in which emigration is still a painful reality.
Scotland is a rich country, whose mineral resources of coal, oil, and
natural gas were exploited or are being exploited but with minimal
investment in new structures of services and industry. For nearly 20
years, no council houses have been built and the country has been
devastated industrially with the loss of the motor industry,
steel-making, the research department of Rolls-Royce, etc.
Once again, Scots are building prosperity in new environments and
rejuvenating church communities in London, Corby, Leeds, and further
afield. They return to their native heath to bury their parents. They
are saddened by the reality of so much of Scotland with villages which
have not advanced during the last 20 years.
Their brothers, many of them under 60, have been jobless for up to 20
years, victims of the loss of jobs in BMC (Bathgate), Hillman Imp
(Hillington), Ravenscraig (Motherwell), etc.
Scotland's future as a nation with human and Christian values can be
assured only by a Government wise enough to invest 3% a year in
structure and industry.

RECENTLY, I fell victim to the police campaign on speeding. I was
caught, fined, and awarded three penalty points for exceeding the speed
limit. The wee gun was concealed in an unmarked stationary car. After 37
years of driving, with a spotless driving licence, my pride was ruffled,
but I was not complaining -- it was a ''fair cop''.
I was less than happy when I later read of two cases down south. In
the first, a famous international racing driver was charged with driving
at a speed of 100mph plus on a main highway. He was fined #100 or so,
but was not awarded any penalty points like any ordinary citizen.
Perhaps, in the law he was regarded as more equal than some?
The other case involved motorists who were caught speeding and were
liable to a fine and penalty points. However, because of a special trial
scheme being operated by the local traffic police at the time, the
miscreants would not be penalised with a fine or penalty points, if they
agreed to attend a class on speeding/good driving instead.
Poor old Joe Soap here, and many like me, did not enjoy such an offer
which would save on the pocket and, more importantly, on the licence.
What irritates is not being caught fair and square but that the
traffic laws of the United Kingdom are not being applied uniformly and
consistently throughout the country, nor are they seen to be by the
people.
Since my salutary lesson, I have been driving assiduously to the
stipulated limits, but I am sorely intimidated by mindless maniacs who
drive dangerously up my rear end; one even touched my bumper. Why don't
these people get caught; or those who take off from the kerb, or turn
without signalling?
I am for stiff and fair punishment and feel more unmarked care should
be employed. It is high time we also had highway patrols, visible and
fully effective, on our roads in dealing with the situation.
All one looks for is consistency, nationwide, in such everyday
matters.

OVER the past year we have read many reports and letters on the
proposed extension to the M77. The only public support given to this
scheme has been on the ground of improved safety and a projected
reduction in accident rates.
This must now seem rather ironic to the residents of Dumbreck who are
situated at the first interchange on the new motorway. Attempts at
traffic diversion in this area have resulted in narrow residential
streets being flooded with rush-hour traffic.
We have witnessed traffic jams with motorists blowing their horns and
shouting at each other. Cars have also been driven along pavements and
down public footpaths to avoid following the diversion route.
This is by no means a temporary problem as residents have been assured
that a planned traffic system would take a further year to implement.
This situation did not arise by accident but as a result of planning
departments ignoring the local community and pressing ahead with their
plans where the only costs being considered are financial.

YOUR leader, Clarion call of a long-dead age (May 22), is yet another
example of your consistent anti-Thatcher policy, which appears to be
characterised by vendetta rather than valid criticism and is unworthy of
a newspaper of The Herald's standing.
Lady Thatcher is a politician of strong convictions who led her party
to victory in three General Elections; her views will always merit
serious consideration.
Her fears for our inexorable integration into a Federal Europe are
fully justified and are reflected widely thoughout the country as well
as among a number of MPs.
Although, as you state, ''Europe is our biggest trading partner,''
nevertheless, this trade -- 60% of our total -- is not on balance
profitable and there is no evidence to show that, after further
integration, ''if Britain is not a part of that we will lose out
dreadfully''.
Historically, we have been an international trading nation, and we
still are.
Centuries of struggle have served to create, and preserve, Britain's
democratic institutions and, above all, the sovereignty of Parliament.
It would be unthinkable if all this were to be subsumed into an
amorphous, federal grouping, only to lose its identity and unique
influence in the world.

RAE REID'S riposte to Malcolm Rifkind's insulting statements on the
Irish armed forces and possible Scottish forces was timely (May 25).
In population terms alone the Scots will expect 10% of the current
armed forces assets when independence comes. However, given the
ever-increasing cuts that Mr Rifkind makes in the defence budget,
perhaps we should take his word for it that this will amount to three
gunboats.
Nevertheless the Scots will have no problems defending their nation.
After all, 50% of the soldiers who fought in the Gulf war were Scots and
we have given more than our share of fighting men in defending Britain
for centuries now.
It might not seem so since were not, at the dictation apparently of Mr
Major, allowed to parade in our own capital city in honour of our
veterans on VE Day. We were only permitted to be represented in London.
Indeed, at the official commemoration of D-Day at Omoha Beach, yet
again the British were represented by an English regiment and band. I
watched in vain for the Scottish pipes to signal our contribution, but,
as usual, we were invisible.
There was one small nation marching proudly to commemorate its
participation. A fine body of Luxembourghians and their band took part
in the march past the assembled Heads of State to honour the five men
they had had on the beaches that day.
Our veterans also deserve to be properly honoured.

SURELY I am not alone in thinking that it looks as if I, and perhaps
many others, will feel disenfranchised at the next General Election.
Each day that passes the differences between what the Conservatives
will offer and the Tony Blair, Gordon Brown alternative scenario become
ever more blurred.
I cannot even turn to what is being offered by the Liberal Democrats
because their ideas are so woolly and so differently geared to fit the
prevailing political opportunities in each constituency that voting for
them in such circumstances would seem like swimming towards a sinking
ship.
Democracy cannot work effectively where parties blatantly steal each
others' clothes not because of a change in ideas and principles but
purely to dupe the electorate.

THE dispute over the Burrell Collection in Glasgow is predictably
represented as a case of the public interest versus the self-importance
of the donor (The Burrell abroad, April 17; A battle of will at the
Burrell, May 2). But has the public been consulted or had all the
factors put before it?
Last year two major Turners were lent to Germany by the Tate Gallery,
contrary to the artist-donor's conditions, and lost. Earlier another was
lent to be an embassy abroad and seriously damaged. The recent tour of
the Barnes Collection paintings, again made contrary to the donor's
conditions, has resulted in damage to the paintings.
Have none of your readers been abroad in the hope of seeing a certain
picture only to find that it has been loaned somewhere else? Members of
the art world are paid to jet off to all the latest shows but others may
never catch up with the work they set out to see.
The Chief Charity Commissioner has written that ''benefactors thinking
of making charitable bequests to museums and galleries can do so with
confidence that charity law will protect their intentions''.
But in effect their wishes have often not been protected, sometimes
with the result that works have been lost or destroyed.
After Burrell gave a collection to Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum he,
according, to its then director, T J Honeyman, questioned an attendant
who said: ''Ach! I don't know how much about them. We've got to keep
them together, that's the condition: but we'll likely scatter them when
the old buffer dies.''
This disjunction between pious claims and cynical reality has
disgusted many, as may be witnessed by the numerous recent complaints in
Scotland about the failure to honour the wishes of donors who are often
in no position to defend their side after they have made their gifts.
For that reason I have proposed the formation of a body to be called
''Donor Watch'' to even out the balance of power between donor and
recipient.
Of course there may be a case for departing from the letter of the
donor's conditions in order to protect their spirit or the public's real
interests.
But too often collections are treated as honeypots into which museums
may dip at will in order to further their own interests, treating the
items in them as valuable currency with which to buy sponsorship and
exchange loans. Is the public really served by that?

WHEN the German Army reached Paris the Rev Donald Caskie locked the
door of the Scots Kirk, handed the key to the owner of the restaurant
next door, and set off with the great exodus of refugees to the South of
France. He eventually reached Marseilles, where he hid troops in the
British Seaman's Mission, and finally got them into Spain and to
eventual freedom in Britain.
He was captured by the Italians and imprisoned in a building in Nice
which at that time had also as prisoner the French Resistance heroine,
Odette.
Ultimately Donald Caskie was imprisoned by the Germans at Fresnes, on
the outskirts of Paris, and condemned to death but he was miraculously
saved by a Lutheran pastor.
On the Liberation of Paris he walked from Fresnes back to the Rue
Bayard, asked the restaurant keeper for the key, and reopened the door
of the Scots Kirk which by then was derelict.
The whole of Scotland rallied to the raising of funds for a new
building -- the people of his native Islay, churches, Scottish schools,
and Scottish football teams.
The Scots Kirk had also a heroine of the Resistance -- Netta Campbell
Macintosh whose family came from Crieff, Perthshire.
Her flat in Paris became a link in an escape route. There she hid
troops, mostly Canadian airmen, and undertook other dangerous
expeditions for the Resistance. No book has been written about her but
she was awarded the Croix de Guerre by General de Gaulle.
For the sake of those two brave Scots and for countless others who
have worshipped in the Scots Kirk at 17 Rue Bayard, I trust that the
Board of World Mission of the General Assembly will drop its proposal to
sell the site of the Scots Kirk.
Where there's a will to save it, there will be a way to raise the
finance to keep this place of worship.

STICKY-FINGERED political apologists love nothing better than to
rummage through any nice, juicy sociological study which appears to
agree with their preconceived notions. Disregard, then, any blatant
attempts to use for devious and partial ends the serious research by Sir
Michael Rutter, Professor David Smith, and other European and American
academics into the life patterns of young people in the post-war period.
The tentative conclusions of the work are couched in the most careful
language. Sir Michael warns that the problem of anti-social behaviour in
young people has occurred across the Western industrialised world and
that it is foolish to seek a single solution. Indeed he admits that the
problem is so striking that a simple solution ought to be apparent, but
is most definitely not.
Attempts have been made already to bend the conclusions of the study
to fit other agendas which can hardly even be described as hidden. Thus,
in some reports, unemployment and housing are discounted as reasons for
anti-social behaviour and rising affluence and youth culture are blamed.
Unsurprisingly the Government, which has always bridled at the link
between crime and unemployment and poor housing, is said by a Home
Office official to be very interested in the report. It is true that the
''golden era'' of economic growth and low unemployment between 1950 and
1973 brought better living conditions, but also a significant rise in
crime, drug abuse, and suicide. Nevertheless, the report also concedes
that the poor and unemployed on derelict estates are more likely to be
criminal, depressed, and drug addicted than those with more comfortable
lifestyles.
A way ahead appears in those sections of the study which look at the
immediate society in which young people live. It is possible that the
rise of a youth culture must hold some blame, at least in the sense that
the notion of a separate youth culture, with all that implies for
separate music, dress, and entertainment, implies a separation from the
larger society around and from the influence and values of their
parents. And there, banging our own drum, is the rub. It has been clear
for some time that the failure of many parents to bring their children
up properly has caused serious problems in our society. Professor Smith
concludes that the breakdown in family life is more likely than
unemployment to be the cause of psychosocial disorders in young people.
There the case must rest for the moment, pending further research rather
than propaganda.

WHY the late Roald Dahl failed to use politicians as characters to
frighten his little readers is something of a mystery. There are enough
frightful people in that mock Gothic pile in Westminster to terrify
libraries full of them. Some politicians are quite different,
representing exemplars of how the job should be done. Tony Blair is
developing into one of these. His determination and self-confidence are
partly bred of his successes thus far, but in Germany yesterday, and on
the subject of a Labour government in Europe, it was his positive
attitude that stood out quite as much as his policies. Perhaps, again,
he is lucky in the available comparisons. The attitude of the present
Tory regime to Europe is by turns cowardly and bombastic; it is anything
but positive.
Blair, then, was in good form. He appears to have approached the
formidable Chancellor Kohl with the confidence of an equal, which is
somehow not the impression given habitually by Major. His address to the
Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung, a German Social Democratic think-tank of the
high-powered sort in which Germany seems to abound, was thoughtful,
determined and, once more, confident. The Labour leader has made it
abundantly clear in recent speeches, and in Germany yesterday, that a
Labour government would play a constructive part in the European debate,
putting forward positive ideas. Note those key words, ''constructive''
and ''positive''. If he holds to those themes, and if he has the
opportunity to put them into action, that alone will be manna from
heaven, not just for Europhiles but also for any Eurosceptics who
appreciate the importance of Europe for the British economy in the
future.
Apart from the common sense of the six points in his speech, which
dealt generally with the necessity to expand, strengthen, democratise,
and make more accountable the European Union, the note which stood out
was his determination to impress on all and sundry the fact that a
Labour government would stand up for Britain's interests. He would say
that, of course, as does Major. Nor is there any doubt that both men are
sincere in their determination. But dealing with the tone of Blair's
speeches as much as the policies, it seems clear that anyone fighting
their own corner in a positive way is more likely to succeed than a
resentful and reluctant combatant. It is true that much of the above is
about how Blair is perceived. More flesh is needed in the form of
detailed policies, but we must not forget how important perception can
be, nor how a positive and willing approach can work wonders where a
reluctant one can only lead to bitterness and failure.

IT IS curious that although the intellectuals among us invariably deny
the existence of supernatural forces, very few of them walk under
ladders or open umbrellas in the house. Like the rest of us, they will
own lucky pens and pencils, put on auspicious items of clothing for
interviews and exams, and follow a strict routine for going to work in
the morning. Entirely natural precautions, like avoiding cracks in
paving stones or touching lamp-posts have nothing to do with
intelligence. Benjamin Britten was once found hobbling along the
corridor of an Edinburgh hotel, trying not to step on red lines in the
carpet. ''If I do not touch them, it means I am a composer,'' he
explained.
New Zealand's recent victory in the America's Cup, in which the
challenger, Black Magic, achieved a 5-0 win over Young America is
ascribed to superior New Zealand seamanship, and the lucky red socks
worn by Peter Blake, the crew's manager. So widespread has been the New
Zealand belief in their power that 300,000 pairs were sold, and even the
armed forces were allowed to wear them while in uniform. Researchers may
now be studying how they could have altered the wind and tide in Black
Magic's favour.
It must be confessed that scientists are somewhat less superstitious
than artists. The author V S Naipal used ''no rustle'' paper, stolen
from the BBC, in order not to attract failure. Caruso's life was ruled
by superstition. He would not travel or wear a new suit on a Friday, and
to avoid chest trouble, despite smoking 60 cigarettes a day, he wore a
dried anchovy round his neck. But even physicists like Niels Bohr have
not been immune from hanging up horseshoes. ''Of course I'm not
superstitious,'' he said. ''But I understand they bring you good luck if
you believe in them or not.''

THE London Arena is a well-known venue for boxing title fights, but
today it will witness a showdown of an altogether different kind. Not so
much the rumble in the jungle. More the tangle by the Thames.
Thousands of shareholders from all over the country will be crowding
into the annual meeting of British Gas, aiming to deliver a knock-out
blow to its board of directors. I will be there, as will the newly
elected MP for Perth and Kinross, Roseanna Cunningham.
There are two resolutions down on the agenda which we want passed. The
first calls for a watchdog group to be set up -- comprised of
shareholder, consumer, and workforce interests -- which would interview
the chairman and chief executive at least three times annually, and
report direct to each annual meeting. The second simply calls for the
company's remuneration policy for executives to be revised in line with
best practice.
The scandal of how British Gas is run is illustrated by the fact that
such reasonable proposals are being bitterly resisted by the board. When
the British Gas directors say in the annual meeting agenda that they
''unanimously recommend that you vote against Resolutions 12 and 13'' it
is the sign of a board caught in the headlights of public opinion and
unable to make any sensible moves.
The same company leadership has been touring institutional investors
with a ''back us or sack us'' ultimatum. Much to their shame, and with
no consultation with their own policyholders, the pension companies have
been dragooned into line.
Today, therefore, we are likely to see the votes of thousands of small
shareholders overruled by a block vote which the chairman, Richard
Giordano, will pull out of his back pocket. Both the board and indeed
the pension companies are likely to find that the block vote is no more
popular in British Gas than it is at the Labour Party conference.
It is important to understand that at the heart of this dispute is
more than the issue of Cedric Brown's salary and the other perks of the
top executives. Of course the revelation of a near 75% increase for
Brown when pensioners were receiving 75p did ignite public frustration
with the company. However, it is only one of a whole range of issues
which have been smouldering for the past couple of years.
The only thing rising faster than the top people's pay at British Gas
has been the complaints from consumers about the decline in standards of
service. Further fuel was poured on to the flames by the hundreds of
showroom closures and the tens of thousands of staff redundancies. Then
there is the gutting of the Scottish management tier and the exorbitant
charges being demanded for connections to the gas supply.
Significantly, many small shareholders are resentful that the poorest
sections of the community are being asked to pay more than anyone else
for their gas supplies. In this area we can see the clear distinction
between the values of the people running the company and their private
shareholders.
The company chairman had planned to announce today, in a publicity
fanfare, that the discount scheme already available for direct debit
customers was to be extended to other forms of payment, although at the
reduced rate of #2 per quarter. Still excluded from this bonus are the
people with pre-payment meters (ie, the poorest customers) who will thus
pay more for their gas than anyone else.
It is a perfect illustration of the mentality which has infected the
top management of this company that they assume that such an arrangement
will be popular with their small shareholders. On the contrary, I can
tell them that the 1500 shareholders which I will be representing today
will be bitterly opposed to the idea of the poorest sections of the
community paying more for their gas.
There are different standards at work between the boardroom of British
Gas and the living rooms of their customers.
At the heart of this contrast lies a basic disagreement about what
British Gas should be. The small shareholders and the staff, cheered on
by the consumers, believe that it is and always should be a utility --
privately owned and profitable -- but still with a duty of public
service. However, for chairman Giordano and the rest of the boardroom
gang British Gas is just another oil and gas company -- a big one
desperate to get bigger and free from its roots and past obligations.
Since Giordano became chairman in January 1994 he has ruthlessly
sought that goal. Public anger with the direction of the company has
mounted and one public relations disaster after another has made no
difference. Today he will claim an endorsement from his big
shareholders, but the moral victory of the sma' folk may be the more
significant for both British Gas and generally.
First, Messrs Brown and Giordano will emerge unscathed. A shareholder
rebellion on this scale for such a company is unprecedented. The pension
companies which save its bacon today will be getting restive behind the
scenes.
Secondly, if the small shareholders are outvoted by the big battalions
it will expose the emptiness of John Major's mumblings about shareholder
democracy to control the excesses of the fat cats. It will expose the
need for legislation to derail the top executives' gravy train.
Thirdly, the emergence of consumer power in this area is unlikely to
stop with the dust up in the Docklands. Questions will be asked about
which of the pension companies rescued the board of directors and why.
Certainly not by consulting their policyholders, who will be as united
against the company as everyone else in the country.
Today I will cast the 750,000 votes I have been given to ''sack the
board''. It may be only a drop in the bucket at today's meeting. But
before long the Messrs Brown and Giordano will be swept away by a tidal
wave of popular opinion.

IT ALWAYS began with a delicate and precisely spaced patting of each
jacket pocket. He must have known which one carried the pouch but it was
an integral part of the ritual. Then the pipe was upended over the
nearest bin and two hefty thwacks would rid it -- discreetly -- of any
damp debris. The fresh pinch of tobacco would be rolled languorously
between thumb and forefinger then packed carefully into the bowl and
lit, quickly, with a flick of wrist and matchbook and a series of long,
drawn-out, indulgent suckings and blowings.
It lent him an air of wisdom and benign authority, this former
colleague, and he would deal with questions and queries from behind a
thick blue coil of curling smoke.
''My dear girl,'' he would say, slipping the pipe to one side of his
mouth, and steepling his fingers amid the haze in front of him, ''I
don't have a bloody clue.''
With the death of Harold Wilson, there's been much pontification about
what makes the pipe such a symbol of respectability. To the experts,
Wilson was accorded status and chutzpah by his briar. It was an
indication that he was a man of the people, a worthy prop which allowed
him to issue weighty pronouncements between each contemplative, careful
puff.
To the untrained eye, the image came from the clenched jaw required to
hold the damn thing in place, the kind of straight-lipped, teeth-bared
rigidity which suggested discipline and the celluloid image of the
rock-jawed hero. Cigarettes are messy and demand a fair amount of arm
waving, ash dropping and nicotine staining, but pipes can be left
clamped in position with the smoke issuing in controlled bursts; an
implement, not an addiction; a hobby, not a habit.
The perceptions are backed up somewhat by research. A recent study in
England found that pipe smokers are less likely to get divorced, have
car accidents, change jobs, drink coffee or alcohol, or skip work than
cigarette smokers. Contentment, safety, dependability.
It is still largely the mark of a man. There are about 700,000 pipe
smokers in Britain today and the vast bulk of them are male. Alan
Myerthal, who has been in the pipe business for two decades and who runs
the Pipe Shop in Edinburgh, has had plenty of time to compile a photofit
of the typical pipe smoker.
''There are basically two types,'' he says. ''You've got the old pipe
smoker who smokes tobacco that smells like old socks. He's smoked it
since he was a wee laddie and used to sneak shots of his dad's pipe.
Then there's the middle-income, upper-income bloke who moves on to the
pipe and who smokes aromatic tobaccos and who spends #20 to #30 on a
pipe. There are a few female pipe smokers, but they tend to be a bit
secretive about it and some of them tend to be a bit butch.''
If it's a male preserve, it's also one with an age limit, reserved
mostly for the cardigan, collar-and-tie community. But Myerthal is
seeing a younger group of customers crossing the threshold of his shop.
''The younger element are certainly trying it to a certain extent, but
whether they are sticking with it is another matter.''
The trade itself has changed in recent years and while some pipe
producers in England have reported a falling off in business, Myerthal
says Scotland has a good solid core of middle-class pipe users. The
range of tobaccos has also extended from the traditional St Bruno types
to flavoured varieties such as Vermont Chocolate, Black Cherry, and
American Delight.
Yet, while the pipe was an integral part of Harold Wilson's political
persona, it's generally acknowledged that John Major or Tony Blair would
be ill advised to adopt the practice as a means of boosting standing. It
reeks too much of the old school and it's not something that can be
picked up and toyed with for promotional purposes. You've got to look
like a pipesmoker to be credible, and neither Major nor Blair have the
right bone structure or aura to carry it off.
Tony Benn, MP, for one, a former Pipesmoker of the Year, won't use his
briar as a metaphor for his career and capabilities. ''He'll talk to you
about politics, yes,'' said his secretary yesterday. ''But pipes?
Nope.''
Myerthal thinks the pipe does lend a man an air of authority, even
today, but admits it could possibly be construed as something of a
pacifier.
''I think people who smoke pipes generally tend to be fairly
respectable, fairly contained, you know. They tend to be quite
controlled because if you get a wee bit agitated you can bite on it a
bit harder. A bit of a dummy tit? Definitely.''

* MAD, bad or sad? As a society we love to put people in boxes. So
children whose parents die or separate or who suffer physical or sexual
abuse are ''sad''. But children who rape their sisters or stab their
classmates are ''bad'' or at best ''mad''. But as a new study due out
next week will demonstrate, things simply ain't that simple.
The report, commissioned by the Prince's Trust, shows that more than
90% of all 10 to 17-year-old violent or murderous offenders have been
victims of childhood trauma themselves.
The report by Dr Gwyneth Boswell of the University of East Anglia
studied the backgrounds of about a quarter of those children known in
England and Wales as Section 53 offenders. (The Scottish equivalent are
Section 205 or 206 children, that is those convicted under those
sections of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1975, which covers children as
young as eight.) Interest in these children was highlighted by the
publicity surrounding the tragic death of two-year-old James Bulger in
1993 at the hands of two 10-year-olds. A conference next week called
''Violent Victims'', organised by the Prince's Trust, will explore why a
small minority of Britain's children are capable of committing shocking
crimes.
The Boswell study found:
* 91% of these violent or murderous child offenders had experienced
abuse or loss of a loved one.
* More than a third had experienced both abuse and loss.
* 72% had experienced abuse, of which 29% had suffered sexual abuse, a
very high figure considering most of these offenders are boys.
* More than half had suffered a significant loss, usually of a parent,
through death or divorce.
This is not to say that children from happy, steady backgrounds never
commit terrible crimes or that abused and neglected children are bound
to turn into little thugs. Nevertheless the overwhelming evidence of
this and other studies is that children who rape, maim and murder others
are victims themselves.
Tim Huntingford, assistant director of social work for Strathclyde,
Europe's largest social work department, is wary of making simplistic
connections between abuser and abused: ''To say most sexual abusers were
abused themselves simply doesn't wash. For a start most of those who are
abused are women and most abusers are men.''
Nevertheless, he accepts that often his department can't make a
distinction between victims and perpetrators: ''A significant number of
those involved in violent and sexual offences have suffered terribly in
the past. At times it is difficult to know whether they are abuser or
abused. With young abusers it's even harder to draw the dividing line.
We can get someone come to us initially as a victim. The next time we
see him he is the abuser. Then he comes back and he's a victim again.
''Getting in early is the key. We used to think that there were
serious sexual offences and milder ones, such as flashing, which was
often put down to youthful high spirits or experimentation. Now we
realise that if we can intervene at an early stage before patterns of
behaviour become settled, you can put a stop to it,'' says Huntingford.
Late last year Strathclyde embarked on the Halt Project in Glasgow to
work with teenage sexual abusers. So far it has taken in 21 young men,
average age 15. Most had started abusing around the age of 12.
Such projects are still considered extremely controversial and
officials are reluctant to divulge much detail for fear of a public
backlash. Huntingford says:''There's still a lobby that says 'Cut their
balls off or lock them up forever'. But I think we've got through that.
If we want to protect children, we have to try to stop people involved
in abusive behaviour.''
The very small number of children in Scotland convicted of serious
violent offences end up in one of the two secure units at Kerelaw and
Kenmuir St Mary's. Jenny Thompson is the line manager in charge of
Kerelaw at Stevenston in Ayrshire. She says that at any one time only
around three of the 24 places in the unit are occupied by such children.
She says although it isn't necessarily the case, often such children
come from dreadful home backgrounds.
She describes a typical case of a boy who had committed murder: ''His
parenting had been abysmal. Things we would take for granted such as
getting new clothes or celebrating birthdays were missing from his life.
He had never been made to go to school and academic achievement simply
wasn't considered important. It added up to a sad picture of someone
with no picture of himself as a member of society.''
At Kerelaw he has not only started to enjoy school but has taken up a
musical instrument and started playing sports. A catalogue was brought
in for him to choose some clothes to wear. Some angrily dismiss such
treatment as ''rewarding badness''. Thompson sees it as an essential
part of a strategy which might, just might, turn this boy from a life in
the penal system to becoming a useful member of society.
In the conclusion of her report Dr Boswell recommends that children
need more help to understand the reasons for their past offences and to
show them how they can avoid them in future. The system, she says, needs
to be more streamlined and coherent in its response to the young person
who is both victim and offender.

Patrick Brogan views the biggest exhibition devoted to the work of
Whistler since his death, with many of the paintings coming from Glasgow
JAMES McNeill Whistler, LL D (Glasgow), has come to Washington,
bringing his Mother from Paris and a splendid array of portraits,
drawings, lithographs and etchings from all over the world --
particularly Glasgow.
The centrepiece of the Whistler presence, at the National Gallery, is
the same exhibition that was shown at the Tate in London last autumn,
and then moved to Paris.
But there are three other shows, one of portraits of Whistler and
other memorabilia, largely from Glasgow, at the National Portrait
Gallery; the second a small selection of the huge collection usually
consigned to the cellars of the Freer museum; and an exhibition of
Whistler's prints.
It is the biggest show devoted to the painter since retrospective
exhibitions staged after his death. There was a grand dinner at the
National Gallery to mark the occasion last week and there's a big
reception at the British Embassy this evening in honour of the Glasgow
connection.
The university is represented by the director of the Hunterian Museum,
Professor Malcolm McLeod, the dean of the arts faculty, Drummond Bone,
and Nigel Thorp, director of the Centre for Whistler Studies.
Margaret MacDonald, who wrote the standard catalogue of Whistler's
paintings and is co-author of the exhibition catalogue, has livened
things by bringing along copies of her own jeu d'esprit: Whistler's
Mother's Cookbook. She is now editing Whistler's letters.
That famous painting is the chief attraction for Americans: it is one
of only two or three works of art that have sunk deep into the
collective memory. Everyone in the country knows it, and the only other
American works that have reached the same level of instant recognition
are Gilbert Stuart's portrait of Washington and a grandiose historical
drama, Washington Crossing the Delaware. So the lines started forming
early when Mother came to town, on her first visit in a decade.
She was the daughter of Dr Daniel McNeill, of Edinburgh, and looks it,
sitting grim and silent, facing left. Rather ungallantly, Whistler
called the painting Arrangement in grey and black. It used to be hidden
away in an attic in the Louvre, but is now accorded a place of honour in
the railway station museum, the Musee d'Orsay. It is a favoured pilgrim
site for visiting Americans.
I prefer the portrait of Carlyle, from Glasgow, which hangs next to it
in the exhibition -- a great man in old age -- worn down by genius and
years. Behind these two masterpieces is a room full of Nocturnes, to
show Whistler's extraordinary versatility.
He was also notorious for bearing grudges. He left America as a young
man, never to return, and he hated the English, though he lived most of
his life in London. He had been snubbed by the artistic establishment,
and when he retaliated by suing Ruskin for libel, he won a farthing in
damages and was reduced to bankruptcy.
His wife was Scottish and died before he did. The Whistlers were
childless and his wife's sisters took care of him in his age, so he
bequeathed his estate to them, with the proviso that nothing should go
to an English museum.
So the collection came to Glasgow, including 80 oil paintings and
about 1000 other works, as well as his letters and other possessions. An
American collector, Charles Freer, amassed a rather larger collection of
Whistler's works and gave his collection to the nation, but stipulated
that nothing could be sold or lent. As a result, hundreds of Whistler's
paintings are in permanent storage at the Freer museum here.
Doubtless they are well preserved, and the Freer has splendidly
restored the famous Peacock Room Whistler painted for a London client.
But make no mistake, if you want to see Whistler whole, you have to go
to Glasgow.
The thing about the current exhibitions here is the demonstration of
the value of such a visit. His Nocturnes, his Mother, and the Peacock
Room are well known, but his genius in other media is a revelation. The
room-full of Nocturnes is followed by one whose walls are covered in the
Victorian style with his works on paper, in ranks one on top of the
other. It is quite wonderful.
There is a room full of drawings of furniture, designs for stage sets,
dresses, architectural features, book illustrations and so on, many from
the Hunterian, and the whole show ends with his last portraits (also
from Glasgow) of waifs he picked up in the streets, of his
sisters-in-law and one last, tragic self-portrait.
The Freer show explores his fascination with things Japanese: there is
a famous painting of languorous Japanese ladies, surrounded by Japanese
works of art on a Japanese balcony -- overlooking Battersea Reach in
London, a depressing industrial landscape dominated by slagheaps. It is
a tour de force. It could have come across as a silly joke, but in fact
its contrasts succeed triumphantly.
The show at the National Portrait Gallery is devoted to works on
Whistler -- many from his own collection, now in Glasgow. He was the
first artistic superstar, and was endlessly caricatured and painted,
with all his deliberate mannerisms, his swirling cloak, his single lock
of white hair, his moustaches and glowering stare. It is all great fun.
The famous group portrait of Parisian literati by Fantin- Latour is,
alas, missing. It shows Whistler as a young man with a few of his
friends -- including Baudelaire and Manet. Not bad for a brash young
American in Paris.
He had made his mark in Paris the year before, 1863, with a portrait
of a girl in white, his ravishing mistress Jo Hiffernan, at the Salon
des Refuses. It was one of the scandals of that scandalous show
(together with Manet's Dejeuner sur l'herbe).
His brush with Ruskin cemented his notoriety in 1877. The critic had
written off one of the Nocturnes, The Falling Rocket: ''I had never
expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of
paint at the public's face.'' Library shelves groan under the weight of
Ruskin's works, but this is his best-remembered line.
Learned counsel asked: ''Mr Whistler, can you ever persuade me that
that is a work of art?'' To which Whistler replied, after a pause:
''No.'' Game, set and, within a few years, match.
So come to Washington, to see him in all his glory -- or wait till
everything is safely back in Glasgow.

CRIMINOLOGIST David Smith was born in an Egyptian hospital in the
middle of a German air raid in 1941, then rushed out of the country by
his mum Margaret by boat down the River Nile.
His rather unorthodox start to life could be translated to his own
work. For his latest study into the life patterns of people aged between
12 and 26 since 1940 has turned upside down many of the theories and
notions of the post-war generation.
Somewhat reluctantly, the Edinburgh University criminology professor
has been thrust into the public spotlight as the man who has helped
explode the idea that everything was right with the world during the
days of sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll.
The European-wide study, which cost up to #200,000 and took five years
to complete, showed that juvenile crime rose during the so-called golden
era between 1950 and 1973 when living standards were high and
unemployment low.
The 50-year study showed family discord and consumerism led to an
isolated youth culture and caused more difficulties for adolescents than
things like bad housing. Suicide rates among young males went up,
depression rose among young females, and diseases like eating disorders
came to the fore.
There was no single cause for the rise in crime and subsequent
increases in suicide, drinking, drug abuse, and depression said
Professor Smith. He hopes to build on the report, carried out with his
friend Sir Michael Rutter, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry
in London and funded by the Johann Jacobs Foundation of Zurich.
Reasons for the increase in crime in Scotland is a topic he would hope
to look closely at as a follow-on study. One interesting point arising
is that the crime rate in England and Wales rose by 10 times, around
double that of Scotland. Whether that is to do with the different legal
systems and what other factors were involved, Professor Smith believes
is worth looking into.
The report is the latest important work Professor Smith, 54, has been
involved in which has created interest with the Government. His research
helped form the Race Relations Act in Britain and his work in Northern
Ireland helped draw up the Fair Employment Act of 1989. He has also
carried out a major study to find out whether sending your child to a
good school made any difference.
It is his latest report, however, which has people like BBC Radio 2 DJ
Jimmy Young calling him to ask what was wrong with their
nostalgia-seeped years.
Professor Smith, who left Oxford University in the early 1960s and was
a director of a major market-research company by the time he was 28,
admitted it seemed things were easier for him in the 60s than for his
31-year-old son, Jacques.
Professor Smith, who took up his post as criminology professor in
Edinburgh last September, made it clear that, broadly speaking, the
breakdown in family life may be the cause of the increase in
psychosocial disorders among young people even more than things like
unemployment.
He also said that part of the reason behind the rise in the crime rate
was that the consumer society had spawned items easy to steal, like
videos and portable televisions.
Professor Smith said: ''Discontent is something linked to people's
expectations as well as to what people have.
''The more people have the more they expect to have. Throughout the
post-war period not only have we had an increase in standards of living
but also increased mobility, more foreign holidays, more holidays within
Britain, more education, a vast expansion of the mass media.
''People have more vision, they know what is happening on the other
side of the tracks. Particularly in your young formative period you
don't know where you are going to end up, you don't know what you want
or what you will be able to achieve.
''That puts a lot more pressure on young people because they are
vaguely aware of the vast range of possibilities, but many of these
possibilities are ones they cannot realise.''
He added that economic growth since the Second World War has been
enormous and has transformed societies but brought with it all sorts of
changes in people's outlook.
''Since the Second World War young people are becoming more isolated
from the rest of society. At the turn of the century, 12-year-olds would
be working and having relationships with people of all ages.
''Now, because education goes on for much longer and youth culture has
grown, you have a group of adolescents with less inter-relations with
other age groups.''
The growth of individualism, he said, was a positive thing but when
people could not find the niche in society they wanted they were left
with less support from other people to get out of a difficult situation.
Interesting parallels can be drawn with Japan where in 1950 the crime
rate was the same as the UK. In Britain it has gone up 10 times while in
Japan, with its strong family unit and working for one another, it has
gone down.
Overall, the report rejected many traditional expectations but made it
clear that more research was needed.

John MacCalman, Municipal Correspondent, reports how the return of the
tram to Glasgow's streets is a step closer. The deadline for objections
has passed and a surprisingly small number of complaints have been
received
THERE is cautious optimism at Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive headquarters that plans to build a light rail system passing
through the centre of Glasgow has attracted a comparatively light
mailbag of 22 objections.
The Parliamentary Order required for the #170m project was lodged in
March and the last date for objections has passed.
Officials are at the early stages of assessing the objections from
public service utilities like gas and electricity as well as some from
individuals owning residential and business properties sited close to
the 20-kilometre route from Maryhill through the city centre to
Easterhouse.
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive will attempt to reach
agreement with those concerned. If there are objections outstanding,
however, then a public inquiry will be held in Glasgow. At the end of
the inquiry the Reporter will recommend whether the Parliamentary Order
should be allowed, with or without changes, or whether it should be
refused.
The SPTE's mood of caution was mirrord by Strathclyde region's
vice-chairman of roads and transportation, Councillor Walter MacLellan.
''We have to ascertain whether the objections are objections in
principle or whether they are individuals who feel a particular part of
the route, or the way it's designed, is causing them a problem of access
to a business,'' he said.
''Normally with those types of objections we would hope that we could
arrive at a compromise -- something both sides could live with.''
However, given the benefits the project would bring to the city in
terms of economic gain and environmental improvement, Councill MacLellan
emphasised that the council and the SPTE would be wishing to press on
with construction work as quickly as possible.
He cautioned that some objections might have been lodged on behalf of
corporate groups which, in fact, represent a large number of people.
There was also the possibility that a small number of people could raise
objections to something that was fundamental to the project.
''Because the quantity of objections is relatively low I wouldn't like
to assume that none of them is very serious,'' Councillor MacLellan
concluded.
The return of tramcars as an integral, cost-effective and
environmentally friendly component of city transport is a vision now
being taken up by several British cites.
Light rail systems, as the trams are now called, are already up and
running in Manchester and Sheffield.
And yesterday Transport Minister Steven Norris launched a competition
to select a private-sector group to design, finance, build, operate and
maintain a proposed #150m Croydon Tramlink in South London.
The proposed Strathclyde Tram will be a light rail system with
electrically powered vehicles running on tracks laid along either
existing street or off-street sections. Each vehicle will carry up to
250 people and trams will run at 10-minute intervals in each direction.
The proposed route of the line is approximately 20 kilometers long,
and would run from Maryhill in the north-west of Glasgow, through the
city centre and on to Easterhouse in the east of the city. There is the
possibility of an extension to Drumchapel at a later stage.
For about two-thirds of the route the tram would run on tracks along
existing streets, particularly in the centre and east of the city.
Between Maryhill and Kelvingrove the route would mainly use an old
rail trackbed and tunnel before passing through the northern edge of
Kelvingrove Park.
Between High Street and Parkhead Forge the route would run parallel
with the Airdrie railway on the existing trackbed.
The route would be above ground except from the north of Botanic
Gardens to Kelvinbridge and at Bellgrove, where it would pass through
existing tunnels. A short section in Kelvingrove Park would require a
new tunnel.
A number of new structures and facilities would be needed to
accommodate and operate the line, including a light rail
vehicle-stabling and maintenance depot at the former railway goods yard
a Camlachie, two miles east of the city centre.
New bridges will be required over the River Kelvin at the north end of
Kelvingrove Park; over the Airdrie railway east of Bellgrove Station;
and over the M8 Motorway at Cartcraig Road.
The light rail route would also cross under the Airdrie railway north
of Parkhead Forge.
A projected two-year construction period is unlikely to start before
1998, with commissioning and commencement of operation occurring in the
year 2000 at the earliest.
The rebirth of the tram is most appropriate for Glasgow. Apart from
its own gloriously romantic years of this much-loved form of transport,
it was Glasgow which gave the name ''tram'' to the world.
According to research carried out by a late Herald assistant editor,
the name ''tram'' was derived from that of the former owners of this
newpaper, George Outram and Co.
It seems Outrams at one stage had mining interests in the city and
were the first company to use coal hutches drawn on rails.
These were known at the time as Outram cars, subsequently being
shortened to tram cars.
Not many people know that.

RICH or poor, high-born or low, there can't be many people in Britain
who haven't got at least one of these in the kitchen. I refer to the
teapot, a celebration of which is currently taking place at the NS
Gallery in Cresswell Lane, Glasgow.
Gallery director, Nancy Smillie, who trained as a potter at the
Glasgow School of Art, has brought together a collection of teapots --
all for sale -- the like of which would definitely not be found in a
High Street ironmongers or china shop.
Some are teapots in name only and will never be put into service
beside a plate of scones or a slice of toast. These include sculptor
George Wylie's large fur-covered teapot, and one which is about two-feet
tall and the width of a single teabag, produced for the show by a
second-year art student.
Then there are the middling ones, which like the silver teapot your
granny might have owned, would only be brought out on special occasions
-- if at all. Works by the gloriously named potter, Philomena Pretsell,
come into that category. She has produced tea sets comprising pot, milk
jug, cup and saucer whose style is difficult to pin down but could be
loosely described as Scottish kitsch meets Wedgwood on acid.
Nancy Smillie admits she hadn't made a teapot for 10 years but decided
to do some for the exhibition. The results are so attractive that the
new Smillie designs have sold more than any others in the variations on
the conventional teapots section.
Nancy has made tiny pots that would do the single cup drinker as well
as ones that look like large mugs with lids, dipped in the beautiful
strong pink and turquoise glazes she developed herself, decorated with a
simple, smiling face.
In a category all of their own are the Yixing teapots imported from
China by Dartington Pottery in Devon, and on show in Scotland for the
first time.
These exquisite pots, based on a tradition which goes back more than
300 years, come in a range of extraordinary shapes from lotus leaves and
peanut shells to a tree trunk decorated with tiny, life-like frogs.
The exhibition continues until mid-June.

Prince Charles's presence in Dublin is seen as an important step in
forging improved links between Britain and Ireland, reports John Cooney
THE biggest and most coveted event in the Dublin social calendar this
year is an invitation to attend today's reception in honour of the
Queen's birthday, hosted by the British Ambassador to Ireland.
No reference is made on the invitation card to the presence of the
main guest at the garden party -- Prince Charles. The heir to the
throne's visit is the first public appearance by a member of the British
royal family since the partition of Ireland in 1922.
On arrival this afternoon at Baldonnel on an aircraft of the Queen's
Flight, Prince Charles will travel by RAF helicopter to the garden party
at Glencairn where, in 1976, the IRA killed the then ambassador, Sir
Ewart Biggs.
This evening the prince will be guest of honour at a banquet in Dublin
Castle -- the former seat of British rule in Ireland. This will be
hosted by Prime Minister John Bruton.
Tomorrow Prince Charles, who has a lifelong interest in Celtic
mythology, will visit the ancient burial tomb at Newgrange in County
Meath. Later he will visit gardens in Trim.
After meeting Dublin's lord mayor at the Mansion House, the prince
will lunch with President Mary Robinson at her residence. The guests
will include the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dick Spring.
While other royals, Princess Anne, Princess Margaret and the Duchess
of York, have made private visits to Ireland in recent years, the visit
of Prince Charles, though not official, is on a more public and
diplomatic level. It opens a new chapter in the improving relations
between Britain and Ireland.
It follows the visit by a the President of Ireland, Mrs Robinson, to
the Queen at Buckingham Palace two years ago. Not surprisingly,
Charles's visit is being viewed as a kind of John the Baptist trial run
for a full official visit by the Queen to the Irish Republic.
According to an Irish Government spokesman the visit marks ''a
normalisation'' of relations between the two states after the IRA's
''Long War''.
While the peace process in Northern Ireland still remains shaky, the
visit has been made possible by the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires, and by
the political progress mapped out in the Downing Street Declaration and
in the joint framework document by the British and Irish Governments.
However, the semi-public nature of the visit avoids constitutional
difficulties. For example, articles two and three of the Irish
Constitution define the Republic of Ireland's claim to sovereignty over
the six Ulster counties which are legally within the Kingdom of Britain
and Northern Ireland.
The initiative for the visit was taken by Charles himself. Irish
diplomats in London reported conversations with him in which he
expressed his desire to see Ireland, if the security situation allowed.
Following diplomatic soundings in January 1994 between London and
Dublin, the way was paved for the visit by the present IRA ceasefire.
But protests against it are being organised by groups such as DART,
Dublin Against the Royal Tour, and by staunch republicans, who plan to
travel by bus from Northern Ireland to the South.
A particular focus of their agitation is to call on Prince Charles, as
colonel-in-chief of the Paratroop Regiment, to apologise for the killing
by soldiers of that regiment of 14 civilians on Bloody Sunday in
Londonderry in 1972. Other commentators, however, have expressed strong
views that the IRA should apologise to the prince for the killing of his
great uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, nearly 15 years ago at his summer
home in Mullaghmore, County Sligo.
The organisers of the visit insist that Charles will not visit
Mullaghmore, but speculation persists that he may do so because he has
decided to stay on for several more days for private engagements.
The social diarists in all the Dublin newspapers are planning to give
pages of extensive copy to those privileged enough to be invited to the
garden party or to the banquet. This manifestation of curiosity and
goodwill towards royalty is ironic in a country which prides itself on
having broken free of imperialism.
So strong is this current interest in royalty that it is provoking
renewed speculation that the Republic of Ireland might seek to rejoin
the Commonwealth.
The signs are that Prince Charles may find himself infinitely more
popular in Ireland than in Britain. This indeed would be one of the
greatest ironies of all in the complex and turbulent relationship
between the two islands.

A #20m visitor and cultural centre is being planned for the West
Highlands at Ganavan Sands, a mile north of Oban.
A special meeting of Argyll and Bute District Council has been called
on June 8 to discuss the proposal, which could result in the creation of
between 300 and 500 jobs -- 132 within the project itself.
The plan is the brainchild of Edinburgh financier Mr Sandy Orr and
leading UK architect Mr Bill Crerar. Mr Orr, joint managing director of
MacDonald Orr Corporate Finance and chairman of Scottish Opera, said
that the dramatic story of the peoples of the Highlands and islands
would be housed in a fine new building on a superb site, close to one of
the region's main tourist centres.
''It will be a major attraction and will stimulate culture,
environmental awareness, optimism and boost tourism throughout the
Highlands and Islands,'' he said.
A modern museum would be the heart of the project, and a theatrical
approach will be applied to other aspects of the development. It is
planned to show 3-D films of scenes such as fishing in the Minch,
walking among deer on Rhum or Jura, or taking part in an air ambulance
dash.
An application for half of the development funds has been made to the
Millennium Fund.

FEARS are growing for the safety of a retired Highland vet who has not
been seen for more than a fortnight.
Police appealed yesterday to the villagers of Brough, near Thurso in
Caithness, to check all their out-buildings for any sign of Ms Rosie
Nixon, who was last seen walking in the Many Lochs area of Dunnet Head
on May 16.
A three-day search of the area found no trace of the 53-year-old
woman.
Ms Nixon lived alone in the village's old schoolhouse where neighbours
say she led a very private life.
A police spokesman said: ''After this length of time we have to begin
to worry. We really need to know if anyone in the area knows something
or has seen her.''
Ms Nixon is described as 5ft 7in, of slim build, with a fresh
complexion and short light brown hair.
Anyone with information should call Thurso Police on 01847 893222.

THE Whirling Chair. Sounds like a fairground attraction, doesn't it?
Francis McKee knows otherwise. ''Doctors recommended using it in the
dark -- preferably with strange animal noises going on in the
background. Patients were strapped in and whirled at high speed, to
terrify them, to 'purge the mania'.'' The soft Irish voice pauses.
''They would, you see, evacuate through every available orifice while
this was occurring.''
It would be nice, reassuring actually, to label the Chair as some
piece of medieval quackery. A clumsy attempt to infuse superstition with
science. But no -- this device for casting out demons belongs to the
last century . . . And, like much else that is currently on display in a
special exhibition at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, it belongs to a world
that was perennially hidden away behind high walls and locked doors.
Aptly titled Out of Mind, Out of Sight, the exhibition -- curated and
researched by Deborah Haase (Glasgow Museums Department) and Francis
McKee (Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine) -- spans two centuries
of mental health care in Scotland. And for the most part it reveals a
mixed history of good intentions and gruesome practice, of ignorance,
indifference, prejudice and the downright bizarre, all colouring
attitudes to the treatment of mental disorder.
Among those taking part in a Mayfest forum, linked to the exhibition,
was writer Janice Galloway, who has proved supportive of the show. Her
own experiences of breakdown and hospitalisation were the basis of her
first novel, The Trick is to Keep Breathing, and indeed visitors to the
exhibition can hear recordings of her reading from her own works as part
of the Finding A Voice grouping.
For Deborah Haase and Francis McKee, the willingness of writers like
Galloway to participate, to share personal memories and insights in such
an open way really helps Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight to challenge the
closed minds and blinkered viewpoints still prevalent in society.
What soon becomes apparent as you wander through the different
sections, is the aura of mystery that still surrounds the whole subject.
Old photos, dated bits and bobs -- the label on a mineral water
bottle, ledgers, a dance-list -- bear witness to the days when asylums
like Crichton Royal or Gartloch were like separate mini-states.
Within their gates a whole other world existed. Briskly self-sufficent
-- own farms, own power station, own fire brigade, own laws -- this
excluded community even had its own class system . . . Paupers took what
was meted out to them, the wealthy enjoyed such privileges as personal
servants, wine with meals, comfortable surroundings and an array of
recreational pastimes.
McKee talks feelingly about the stigma that corralled these folk out
of sight -- and out of contact -- with family, friends, the outside
world, even justice. ''Patients were often put away for family
convenience. And who's to say if they were actually ill in every case?
''There's often a suggestion that they were an unwanted
responsibility, or possibly of dubious character -- and that covered a
multitude of social 'sins' like obvious promiscuity or profligacy with
the family fortunes -- and so the easiest way to be rid of them was to
have them certified insane. ''
His comments raise, without forcing, the spectre of individual rights
that shadows so much of this fascinating -- and deliberately
non-judgmental -- exhibition. Take, for instance, the items clustered
together under the heading Cure or Control?
From the sweet wee model of the Whirling Chair, the ginormous leather
mitts -- ''Anti-masturbation muffs, to protect the wearer from abusing
their mind . . .'' says McKee, dryly -- to the hydrotherapy douches and
tangled wires of the early ECT machines, there is something to unnerve
everybody.
But nowhere is there a smug placard saying ''Barbaric''. Because,
quite simply, then, as now, medical practitioners were stymied at having
to deal with mental conditions that they didn't understand. And then, as
now, there was a pressure to quell, or contain, those who appeared to
endanger the wellbeing of society at large.
These days, McKee tells me, there's a greater reliance on ''the
chemical straitjackets'' -- the new generations of drugs that aim to
regulate and control from within the patient's own system.
Out of Sight, Out of Mind can't, in any way, cover all aspects of our
ingrown attitudes to mental illness. But -- and this is a very real
strength of the exhibition -- it doesn't content itself with merely
looking back in shocked complacency. There is a whole range of artwork
-- commissioned photographs, taped speech, painting, and sculpture --
that either expresses the views of people with first-hand experience of
mental illness, or else examines current approaches, such as care in the
community.
Anyone who dipped into the recent BBC series States of Mind will
recognise at once the several tensions that exist between the will of
the individual and the dictates of society. Here there is a welcome
chance to explore some of the myths and realities of those tensions.
Anyone who is worried about any aspect of their mental health will
finda resource centre with useful addresses in the exhibition area.
* Out of Sight, Out of Mind runs until September 3. Various related
events are scheduled throughout the summer.

THE total weight of fish landed in Scotland fell marginally last year,
but its value in real terms rose by almost 5%, with shellfish showing
the biggest increase, according to a report published today.
The trends in fish landings, by Mackay Consultants of Inverness, show
that Scotland's share of the UK industry, whether measured by the value
of landings, the number of fishermen, or the number of boats, has
increased steadily to 65%.
One key factor in the trend has been the loss of ''traditional''
fishing grounds off Iceland, Norway, and other countries, which had an
effect on the major trawling ports of Hull, Grimsby, and Fleetwood.
Another factor has been the reduction in fish stocks and fishing
activity in the North Sea, which has led to increased interest in the
waters to the west and north of Scotland.
The statistics reveal the total tonnage of fish landed in 1994 dropped
by 10.3% to 458,056, from 510,649 in 1989. The white fish sector fell by
9.2% over the five years, but for the past two years there has been an
increase after a steady decline.
Overall, the value of all landings rose by 10.3% between 1989 and
1994.Shellfish showed a 25.7% rise over the period, and an 18.2% rise
from 1993-94.
Peterhead remains clearly the number one fishing port in Scotland and
the UK, accounting for 26.5% of total Scottish landings.

MASTERMIND taxi driver Fred Housego was banned from driving for a year
yesterday and fined #600 after he admitted drink-driving.
Housego, 50, was tested at twice the legal limit when police stopped
his car in Whitechapel, London, on April 23.
Housego, of Derek Drive, Croxley, Herts, gained national fame in 1980
as the BBC's Mastermind champion. He is also a freelance journalist for
London News Radio.
He told the court that he had been on a speaking engagement in
Sittingbourne, Kent. He had not been fully aware of the amount of
alcohol he had drunk and decided to drive home rather than stay
overnight.
After the hearing, Housego said that his future as a cabbie was in the
balance as he might well lose his licence.

SKY Television's sports news team has been expelled from the Rugby
World Cup in South Africa -- and the BBC has been warned about its
conduct.
In a statement issued in Johannesburg last night the tournament
organisers declared that Sky had broken the guidelines covering
''non-rights-holding'' broadcasters. According to a senior official, Sky
had repeatedly broken the rules while the BBC had been caught once in
the wrong place.
The event's Media Consultative Committee, which supervises the conduct
of the press and broadcasters, decided that Sky's behaviour warranted
immediate expulsion -- though the company insists it will appeal against
the decision. In the meantime, its news crew will be unable to gain
access to any World Cup area.
ITV Sport holds the exclusive UK rights to live coverage of the
tournament -- and has virtually unlimited access to all areas. Other
broadcasters are obliged to follow strict guidelines that limit access
and protect the investment of rights-holding broadcasters. Sky and the
BBC can provide only a sports-reporting service for regular news
bulletins.
Mr Chris Thau, chief press officer for the World Cup, said: ''We have
no wish to prevent journalists acting as journalists but we have to
protect the rights of those companies that have put millions of pounds
into the event.
''Sky pushed and pushed and eventually we were left with no
alternative but to ask them to leave. There is a limit and they went
beyond it. The BBC has also been reported because one of its crews was
found in an accredited area.''
Mr Thau explained that the organisers had freely given full
accreditation to the Sky reporter who was covering the event but it
seemed that he had been using the pass to get his cameraman into events.
A statement from the Rugby World Cup said: ''Sky have continued to act
in direct contravention of the news access guidelines and the point has
now been reached where Rugby World Cup consider that the exclusivity of
the rights-holding broadcasters have been so significantly compromised
that it is necessary to withdraw Sky's accreditation.''
Sky News African bureau chief Mr Jeremy Thompson said the company
intended appealing to the Rugby World Cup organisers. ''They were pretty
minor incidents. I feel that to withdraw our accreditation is very
unfair,'' he said.

LINDA Lusardi was not impressed. In Edinburgh, for the week's
performance of Ken Lee's play, Happy As A Sandbag, in which she stars,
Lusardi had cancelled all communication with the press, including a
radio and Scottish tabloid interview. She had, for some reason, deigned
to speak to The Herald; but speak is a rather strong verb in this
context: it implies an exchange of information.
Linda Lusardi does not give anything away. There have been too many
articles written about her as a personality; too much speculation and
too much criticism directed at her start in life when, at 17, she became
a model and started to pose topless for The Sun. For her, an interview
is an exercise in cynicism. Hers.
She has an image -- a cerebral one -- which she maintains. She employs
naivete. The words ''Oh, it was just a job'' are on a banner which hangs
perpetually in the air, in the way of garlic to ward off evil spirits.
She gives the impression of being fluffy and vulnerable; her photos are
those of a woman who would prefer a romantic video, creamy pasta and a
box of choccies to sex, because she isn't emotionally equipped to deal
with sweaty testosterone.
She does possess, however, a hard-faced intolerance, a barely
disguised contempt for the press. A fan of professionalism, she bovinely
avoids questions. When asked what possessed her to strip at such a
tender age, she replies: ''I thought you had to be six foot and perfect
to be a model. I worked at a tax office in London before I was
discovered at a bus stop by a photographer's wife. They were looking for
a girl with a certain type of look. It was no big deal giving up my
job.'' You can see my problem.
There is another reason for her pained self-consciousness.She has not
had her troubles to seek recently. It has been reported in the nationals
recently that she and her husband, Terry Bailey, are living apart. The
news hit the headlines after Terry was involved in a car crash in Rome
on VE Day. He is currently recovering in hospital.
What is probably most interesting about the crash is not the fact that
it lifted the lid on Linda's marital problems, but that the driver of
the car was none other than Jimmy ''Five Bellies'' Gardiner -- Gazza's
accessory for all seasons.
The world is not sure what Five Bellies does exactly, apart from
drink, and bask in the fame of Paul Gascoigne, but now that it has been
established that he and Terry have some kind of relationship, it could
be fair to suggest that Lusardi's husband is now embroiled in the yob
culture that Gazza and his friends promulgate.
Journalists do not always walk into an interview with an agenda, but
Lusardi wanted to state her case, just in case I had one. I made some
sympathetic noises about her injured husband. ''I'm on an exclusive, so
I can't talk about that,'' she barked, as she joined me on the settee in
her dressing room at the King's.
I responded by saying something equally tough like: ''Oh, well, that's
OK, I want to talk about other things anyway.'' She congratulated me,
then spent 40 minutes blocking attempts to publicise the other side of
the Linda Lusardi phenomenon.
Some stars have a curious relationship with the media. They blame the
tabloids for their suspicion of reporters, yet when approached by the
quality press, they still hug their paranoia. The quality press did not
blow a minor revelation about Lusardi's personal life into front-page
news, yet stars feel it is their prerogative to dismiss a highbrow hack
in the name of being hurt too many times before.
This is convenient, but it actually works both ways. it might be borne
in mind that tabloids pay for stories, the quality press don't. Lusardi
is probably saving detail for interviews for which she will receive a
sum of money. She seems well attuned to the power of the press as a nice
little earner -- the freedom to make money, not the freedom of
information, seems to be what counts. It's a slap in the face for any
self-respecting interviewer.
Lusardi is half-Italian, a mature 35 with a body of a 20-year-old.
This is handy. Most younger women don't know their market value.
''I wouldn't call it pornography at all,'' she miffs, while we try to
sort out her humble beginnings. ''I did Page 3. I don't consider it
pornography.'' Well, what does she think it is then? ''People are far
too sensitive about nudity; it's natural, and those pictures aren't
portraying women in a sexual way, or in an unflattering way. Plus people
go topless on holiday.'' Of course. People bare all to the sun in Cyprus
for a tan, Linda bared all to The Sun in Britain as a career move.
It's the same argument used to validate nudist colonies -- but nudity
going public is just shameless exhibitionism. Lusardi's right on two
counts. Page 3, was, at the time, only 95% of her work. She posed on
couches for furniture shops too. And breasts are everywhere; women strip
off -- from Pamela Anderson to Tank Girl. Nae worries.
''I say to the women's libbers that I'm standing up for something they
hold true. I don't rely on a man for earnings. I always run my life as a
business. In modelling, you don't just flit from one job to another
unless you are level-headed about it.''
This is what is true about Lusardi. She is level-headed. When she was
discovered waiting for a bus, she realised that she was on to a winner;
a way out of the tax office; a way of making a lot of money. Questions
about ambition are headed off at the pass, but she is.
It is that desire to get on which has resulted in a career in acting.
She likes her white Mazda RX7 Turbo, she wants her palace in
Hertfordshire. She has to subsidise a standard of living which, she
says, on when she was first introduced, ''was every girl's dream''.
''I do have a sense of professionalism in everything I do. A lot of my
success was that I made very good friends with photographers. They'd put
me on trips where the girls were new and green to help them and do their
hair. They knew I'd be no trouble.''
But, in essence, the media have always been kind to Lusardi. They are
her servants.
''When Clare Short tried to ban Page 3 I was invited on to a few talk
shows, and it was like 'Oh, she can actually string a sentence
together'. I was invited on to the Cannon and Ball Christmas Show and
Bruce Forsyth. It just escalated.'' Even when she was being lampooned,
she still turned up trumps. Lusardi's ambition as a teenager was to own
a hairdressing salon. She got her own arena, except now she has bigger
ideas.
She's been an actress now for seven years. Her parents support her.
They supervised the schoolgirl's guide to a modelling career, making
sure that there was always someone to pick her up at the airport and
making sure jobs were above board.
Her theatre company manager, Kevin Brady tells me: ''She's lovely.
There's no ego at all.'' But Lusardi is hurting a little. ''Oh I am. I
just hope that after Sunday it just goes away,'' referring to the
tabloid interest in her marriage.
Her make-up is in a fishing tackle hamper with a little surname plaque
on the inside. It says ''Linda's Box'' and it's wreathed with pretty
flowers. A box of Roses and a dozen empty wrappers litter the white
dressing table like Christmas decorations on the snow. Lusardi's been
demolishing them.
''Thank-you for being so gentle with me,'' she says, smiling sweetly
as I leave. Tough, Linda, tough. The pen, like the gun, always has the
final answer.

THE widow of murdered police constable Lewis Fulton yesterday paid
tribute to her ''modest'' husband as she received a royal award in his
memory.
The couple's 18-month-old son Luke played with a toy car as Mrs
Christine Fulton was presented with a posthumous Queen's Commendation
for Bravery on behalf of her husband at a small ceremony in Kilmarnock.
Mrs Fulton, 35, said later: ''I just keep thinking how embarrassed
Lewis would be about the whole thing.
''He was such a modest person. He would be amazed at all of these
accolades for what he would just consider to be doing his job.''
PC Fulton, 28, died on June 17 last year after going to the aid of
colleagues caught up in a street disturbance in the Gorbals district of
Glasgow.
Philip McFadden, 18 at the time, was later detained in a secure
hospital after being judged insane and unfit to stand trial charged with
the officer's murder.
PC Fulton's death accelerated the introduction of side-handled batons
for Britain's police forces.
Mrs Fulton was handed the award by the Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire and
Arran, Major Richard Henderson.
Mrs Fulton , originally from Billingham, Cleveland, said: ''I was very
proud of Lewis that night, and I'm even more proud of him now.''

Noordwijk, Tuesday
NATO was today set to start a new political and military relationship
with Russia, but at the same time Alliance foreign ministers agreed to
one day let in new members despite Moscow's opposition.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said earlier that Moscow would
end months of hesitation and adhere to a programme of military
co-operation with the 16-nation Alliance under the Partnership for Peace
scheme.
At the same time Nato is to forge special political ties with Russia,
recognising its status as a major power in European security in an
attempt to ease Moscow's fears of isolation.
Several foreign ministers at a Nato meeting in the Dutch seaside
resort of Noordwijk said various agreements would be sealed at a meeting
with Kozyrev tomorrow, opening the way for a formal agreement or treaty
of some kind with Russia that will be negotiated at a later date.
However Nato officials said the ministers also agreed that Russia
could have no veto over plans to admit Eastern European states as
Alliance members.
Secretary-General Willy Claes said that expanding the Alliance was
''part and parcel of our goal to build a new Europe'', but he was also
careful to reassure Moscow.
''The new European security order based on co-operation must be built
with Russia and not against her,'' he said.
American Secretary of State Warren Christopher added: ''Clearly it is
in the interest of every Nato ally and partner that Russia participate
constructively in building a more secure and integrated Europe.''
Russia signed up for the Partnership for Peace -- which provides for
joint exercises and other military co-operation -- last year.
However it has delayed implementing the detailed military programme
and developing other ties because of its opposition to Nato enlargement
and resentment that the Alliance was initially reluctant to recognise
its special status as Europe's biggest power.--Reuter.

Vatican City, Tuesday
THE Pope said today that he was willing to seek an accommodation with
other Christian denominations on the future role of the papacy.
The Pope made his offer in a 115-page encyclical Ut Unum Sint (That
They May All Be One) which is dedicated to the search for unity among
Christian Churches.
In the encyclical, the Pope said he realised that agreement between
Catholics, Protestants, Anglicans, and Orthodox on the role of the
papacy was an immense task but urged them to begin a patient dialogue.
The Pope, who repeated a call for all Christians to seek forgiveness
for past mistakes ahead of the year 2000, said that as leader of the
world's some 960 million Roman Catholics he felt a ''particular
responsibility'' to make unity possible.
He did not spell out his vision of a new role for the papacy but
recalled that in the early Church it acted as a ''moderator'' to resolve
disagreements and preserve unity.
When the Pope visited Rome in 1989, former Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie urged members of his Church, which split from Rome in
1534, to consider such a primacy.
Papal primacy -- recognition of the Pope's supreme authority over any
unified Christian Church -- has been one of the most thorny issues
facing theologians.
The Pope made clear he would not accept a symbolic papacy without
teeth and that Rome would have to hold the primary place among
Christians because St Peter, the first Pope, died there.
He also said a Pope should have the authority to make infallible
declarations regarding the basic tenets of faith.
The recent ordination of women in post-Reformation churches has also
surfaced as a serious obstacle to unity. The Catholic Church has said it
can never allow women priests.
Rome also does not allow married priests while other Christian
Churches do. Catholic and Protestant churches also clash on moral issues
such as birth control and homosexuality.
However the Pope said ''legitmate diversity'' among various Christian
Churches should not be an automatic obstacle to unity.--Reuter.

NATO Foreign Ministers yesterday pledged themselves to tougher action
in Bosnia and promised that UN peace-keepers would have their safety
assured.
The 16 Ministers, meeting yesterday in the Netherlands, also demanded
a release of UN hostages and urged a strengthened capability to carry
out the UN's mission.
''All parties must ensure that UN troops have freedom of movement and
are unharmed, and remove any obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian
aid to the needy,'' the Ministers said.
They added: ''We are ready to support efforts towards the
reinforcement of UN peace forces in former Yugoslavia with the aim of
reducing their vulnerability and strengthening their capability to act
and react.''
Fears that Britain and France might be hijacking the UN initiative in
Bosnia, by taking individual action to protect their nationals in the
peace-keeping presence, were played down by Nato secretary-general Willy
Claes.
He said: ''I cannot take account of rumours or individual actions. I
don't think we have to take this scenario seriously into account.'' The
Ministers formally denounced hostile acts against UN personnel.
''We also condemn in the strongest terms the outrageous behaviour of
the Bosnian Serbs in shelling safe areas and killing and seizing UN
peace-keepers,'' they said in a communique.
In a clear threat to resort to using more firepower against the Serb
rebels, they said: ''We demand that the shelling of safe areas be
stopped and the Unprofor members and UN observers held hostage by the
Bosnian Serbs be released unharmed, unconditionally. We hold the Bosnian
Serb leaders fully accountable for their safe return.
''We pay tribute to the outstanding courage being shown by Unprofor
and UN personnel in this difficult situation.''
They promised that Nato air power remained available to help protect
the safe areas and UN peace forces, in accordance with existing
arrangements with the UN, an indication that the rules of engagement for
UN personnel in Bosnia might not be radically changed in New York later
this week.
''The rules of engagement do not need changed greatly,'' one diplomat
said. ''It is merely a matter of how the existing rules are
interpreted.''
The Ministers said: ''We will continue to enforce the No-Fly Zone over
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will also continue, together with the WEU (the
embryo defence arm of the EU) the maritime embargo enforcement
operations in the Adriatic.''
Britain's lead in toughening Nato's stance was underlined by Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said that there was little likelihood of the
UN abandoning safe areas. He also played down the prospects for a UN
withdrawal. ''We are very conscious of the consequences for those left
behind -- ie, the Bosnians,'' he said.
He was backed by Mr Claes who said: ''Nato is not in favour of a
withdrawal although it remains an option if the UN so decides.''
Mr Claes repeated Nato's demands of the Serb rebels, including the
surrender of heavy weapons and an end to the shelling of safe areas,
warning: ''We remain ready to use any means to support the UN in pursuit
of these objectives, if the UN requests us to do so.''
He said the time had come to end the humiliation of the world
community by the Bosnian Serbs, adding: ''We cannot allow the present
situation to continue.''
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister, said Nato was examining
ways of making rapid-reaction forces available to the UN and the opening
of a land corridor to supply Sarajevo, which would be protected by
troops.
Mr Hurd told reporters that Nato Ministers had concentrated on
reducing the vulnerability of UN troops in Bosnia. ''The decision we
took in London (to send more troops) is the lead decision.''
New moves in the crisis will now be taken in New York this week, as
the UN debates beefing up its mandate. Mr Andre Ouelett, the Canadian
Foreign Minister, told reporters: ''The mandate has to be renewed --
there is no question about it.'' The new mandate should be more
realistic and should afford UN troops ''the capacity to perform more
effectively,'' he said.
Tougher military operations by the UN against the Bosnian Serbs appear
likely to take place without American troops.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher told Ministers that
Washington would provide ''appropriate support'' for the UN but he made
no mention of offering ground personnel.
Mr Hurd was asked what he wanted from the Americans in the way of more
help, and replied: ''One has to be realistic in this life. I don't think
there is a likelihood of the Americans or the Germans sending troops.
The American administration has been pretty clear about its willingness
to help in other areas -- but clearly Washington is willing to help.''
The Foreign Secretary was also asked to respond to hints from some
Nato Ministers that Serbian recognition of Bosnia was now only 24 hours
away. He replied: ''Some of my colleagues are very optimistic.''
Nato Ministers met against a background of concern about how the
Russians would react to the tougher stance by the western powers against
the Serb rebels.
Mr Hurd will meet the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev,
today for discussions about the wider implications of the Balkans crisis
for the troubled relationship between the EU and Russia. But Nato
Ministers were relieved that Mr Kozyrev had agreed to the principle of
the Bosnian Serbs unconditionally releasing UN hostages.

<HEADLINE>Storm as council officials ask to see anti-crime camera tapes to check on shopkeepers. Shopped by Big Brother</HEADLINE>

A COUNCIL'S officials are seeking access to videotapes from police
surveillance cameras -- to help them check on shopkeepers who are
breaking rubbish collection regulations.
Two weeks ago Lothian and Borders chief constable Sir William
Sutherland officially opened the #80,000 closed circuit system installed
to beat town centre crime and vandalism in Galashiels.
Now Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council's crime prevention
committee has written to Sir William, asking for permission for
environmental officials to view tapes from eight strategically-mounted
CCTV cameras. The object: to spot litter dumpers and businesses which
are evading commercial rubbish collection charges by not using special
sacks, for which they are supposed to pay 25p each.
High Street butcher Jim Hogg said yesterday: ''This has a real smack
of Big Brother to it. People contributed to the cost of these cameras,
to beat crime. I gave permission for camera cables to be run along my
wall for that reason, not for officials to check on rubbish.''
Furniture shop owner Bill Robertson commented: ''The principle is
totally wrong. There is a problem with vandalism and town centre crime,
but I have always had misgivings about the cameras and the long-term
effect they could have on people's everyday lives.
''This now seems to be happening. If the council really wants to find
out who the rubbish offenders are, they have only to look inside the
sacks or boxes. The pre-paid sacks I use are full of rubbish with my
firm's name on it.''
The tapes request came as a complete surprise to the chamber of trade
chairman, Mr Alastair MacDonald, one of the prime movers behind bringing
the CCTV system to Galashiels.
Mr MacDonald, licensee of the King's Hotel, said: ''This is not what
we understood the cameras would be used for. They were installed for a
crime prevention role, and rubbish offences seem to be a civil matter. I
will certainly be consulting the other members of the chamber of trade
and the CCTV steering committee and I would expect the matter to be
referred back to us.''
Ettrick and Lauderdale council, however, denied there were any
sinister overtones to the request. Senior official Mr David Quinn said:
''This has been blown out of all proportion. We could pay people to
monitor the sacks on the street, but it will take a lot less time and
save expense to check the tapes.
''There is no question of people being prosecuted, we would just warn
them that they are breaking regulations.
''The Government insists that we charge for commercial rubbish
collection, and we do that by costing each sack at 25p. Some people are
using other sacks and boxes and the loss of revenue falls on the council
and local taxpayers.''
Last night Mr Alan Miller, chairman of the Scottish Council for Civil
Liberties, said: ''We have always been concerned that CCTV is used for
the detection of crime and the identification of criminals. The
Galashiels request seems to be extending the purpose of CCTV to
something which could be dealt with in a more conventional manner.
''While this instance is seemingly harmless or even ridiculous, there
is a danger that it could be followed by other requests. CCTV should not
be used for intelligence gathering or opening files on the local
community.''

Singapore, Tuesday
A SINGAPOREAN court today called prosecution and defence lawyers for a
closed-door meeting before opening the trial of an escaped British
convict accused of murdering a South African tourist and probably
dismembering him.
The judge set June 27 for a pre-trial conference in the case of John
Martin Scripps, who is accused in the death of Gerard George Lowe, a
32-year-old engineer from Johannesburg.
The case was made more sensational after body parts, packed in black
plastic garbage bags, were found floating in the harbour days after Lowe
went missing on March 8-9.
Police suspect the remains are those of Lowe, who came to Singapore on
a shopping trip.
Scripps was serving a 13-year sentence in Britain for heroin
trafficking when he failed to return from a weekend pass in October.
He is also suspected of murdering a Canadian woman and her son in
Thailand in March, and is being investigated in connection with unsolved
murders in Mexico and San Francisco, authorities say.
Scripps' lawyer said the case will be heard formally again on July 4,
when a new date will be set to rule if there is enough evidence for the
trial to begin.
* An Irishman is being held by police investigating the murder of a
Briton found strangled in a Spanish resort town.
The Irishman, named in local news reports as Timothy Owen, was
arrested earlier this week in Fuengirola. Police refused to give
details.
The dead man was named as Brian Smith, 49, from Accrington,
Lancashire. --AP.

LOYALIST activists in Edinburgh last night vowed to stage a
counter-demonstration during Saturday's march through the city by
members of the republican James Connolly Society.
Hundreds of police officers will be on duty because of the threat of
trouble between the two factions, although Lothian and Borders Police
said they were confident of coping with any eventuality.
The loyalists' leaders have already been warned by the police that
they will not be allowed to gather in a group protest, and told that
such action could constitute a breach of the peace.
Earlier this week, Lothian region gave permission for the society's
march, arranged to commemorate Connolly's birth in Edinburgh. He was
executed for his part in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin.
Assistant chief constable Tom Wood had argued against approval for the
march, and the Scottish Police Federation recently called for the
banning of all sectarian parades.
The Edinburgh Loyalist Coalition said yesterday it had sent letters to
more than 300 Orange Lodges, asking members to congregate for a show of
protest against the marchers.

MORE than 60% of all ambulance staff and 70% of emergency crews have
accepted a new pay deal offered by the Scottish Ambulance Service NHS
Trust.
The unique deal, freely negotiated with unions at a time of increasing
acrimony between NHS staff and trusts, offered 6% rises to paramedics
and 10% to control room assistants. In accepting it, they drop Whitley
Council conditions and have certain allowances included in their salary.
SAS Trust chief executive Andrew Freemantle said: ''The number of
staff opting to transfer represents a vote of confidence in the new

MASS meetings are to be held today by the 3500-strong workforce at
Rosyth Dockyard, with the prospect of industrial action over the issue
of pension and redundancy rights.
Unions say neither the Ministry of Defence nor the yard operators have
come up with satisfactory responses to their questions about guarantees
made when Babcock took over the running of the yard in 1987.
Since then, the MoD has paid costs of redundancy but the continuation
of the guarantee requires #154m, which the unions say is well beyond
Babcock's means if it buys the privatised dockyard next April.
Mr Brian Negus, chairman of the industrial unions at the yard, said:
''We have got nowhere with the MoD. It said it was now with the company,
but the company has said it could not possibly afford it.
''We will be reporting to our members. The feedback we have been
getting is very angry. I do not know what action we might take, but it
could well mean balloting for industrial action.''
Mr Allan Smith, chairman of Babcock Rosyth Defence, said every effort
had been made to keep the workforce informed. ''We recognise employees'
entitlements and we are developing proposals which require a measure of
endorsement by the MoD before we can proceed,'' he said.

Milan, Tuesday
POLICE searched the headquarters of Silvio Berlusconi's advertising
company today as magistrates pressed on with inquiries into Italy's
former Prime Minister and his multi-billion pound media empire.
The search at Publitalia, Italy's biggest advertising agency, followed
the arrest on Friday of managing director Marcello Dell'Utri, one of
Berlusconi's closest aides.
He was questioned for more than six hours yesterday by magistrates in
Turin on suspicion of involvement in the alleged diversion of sports
sponsorship money to an illicit slush fund.
Publitalia is also at the centre of a larger investigation by Milan's
''Clean Hands'' anti-corruption magistrates. They have asked for
Dell'Utri and 36 others to be tried on false accounting charges and for
Publitalia to be put under court administration, charging serious
irregularities. Rulings are expected in early July.
Berlusconi, who lost power in December, accuses magistrates of seeking
to wreck his businesses and damage him politically before June 11
referendums on television broadcasting and ownership that could force
him to break up his media empire.
The magistrates have asked an examining judge to commit Berlusconi and
20 associates, including his younger brother Paolo, to trial on charges
of complicity in the payment of alleged bribes to tax police by four
Fininvest companies. A decision is due on July 4.--Reuter.

ECONOMIC activity in both Glasgow and Edinburgh will grow for the rest
of the decade but at a slower rate than in London, Birmingham or
Cardiff, according to the latest report on the prospects for Europe's
major cities.
It appears that the manufacturing-based cities which suffered most
during the recession are leading Europe's economic recovery. Cities such
as Glasgow and Edinburgh, which escaped the excesses of the speculative
boom of the late eighties, will experience a less pronounced recovery.
Nonetheless, the report on the prospects for Glasgow and Edinburgh by
the European Economic Research and Advisory Consortium is upbeat. It
says 1994 was a good year for Glasgow.
Edinburgh, it says, survived the recession well, and its high number
of head offices in the financial sector will make it less susceptible to
the job shedding occurring nationally.
The report's publisher, Ereco, is a group of European economic
institutes, including Cambridge Econometrics, which produces an annual
report on European regional prospects.
On Glasgow, it says that labour market indicators show the city's
economic health to be improving.
Falling unemployment, coupled with rising employment and vacancies,
has resulted from an upturn in the service sector, as Glasgow continues
its transition to a commercial and financial city. The decline of
manufacturing and heavy industry has also slowed.
Unemployment trends were more favourable than in most other UK cities,
showing much greater proportional reductions than in Manchester,
Edinburgh, Birmingham and Cardiff.
The report says: ''Within the service sector, recent expansions by
Abbey Life, Britannia Life, Direct Line, and Scottish Amicable, among
others, have led to the transformation of Glasgow into a key insurance
centre.''
On the city's long-term prospects, the report says there will be
growth in banking, finance, professional services, and in engineering
which will be driven by a recovery in exports.
On Edinburgh, the Cambridge economists say the economy will grow by
2.6% per annum over the next four years, although there was concern that
the development of the economy could be hindered by a shortage of
modern, open-plan office space.
It expects good growth in manufacturing, the financial services, and
in the spin-offs from the opening of the conference centre and the new
Festival Theatre.

AN alcoholic son who subjected his 74-year-old mother to two brutal
beatings within a month was jailed for four years yesterday.
John Gibson, 46, broke his mother's pelvis during the first attack in
her home on Christmas Eve when he punched and kicked her and grabbed her
by the throat.
The assault took place after Mrs Catherine Gibson had gone out to get
fish and chips for her son, the High Court in Edinburgh was told.
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, advocate-depute, said Mrs Gibson did not seek help
for her injuries because she did not want to get a doctor involved.
However, neighbours were concerned and police and a doctor were called
after a social worker visited Mrs Gibson in her Beech Place,
Bishopbriggs, home.
Mrs Gibson discharged herself from hospital and returned home, only
for her son to attack her again on January 23.
Police, alerted to a disturbance, called at the house to find the
elderly woman lying on the floor in pain.
Gibson admitted two charges of assaulting his mother when he appeared
at Glasgow Sheriff Court, but Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell decided that the
offence merited more than the maximum three years he could impose and
sent the case to the High Court for sentence.

Bangkok, Tuesday
A US Congressman has hailed Burmese popular heroine Aung San Suu Kyi
as the Nelson Mandela the world had forgotten and urged international
pressure to obtain her release.
Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel peace prize for her efforts to bring
democracy to Burma, has been under house arrest since 1989. Nevertheless
the National League for Democracy, which she co-founded and led before
her detention, swept more than 80% of the seats in elections the
following year.
Congressman Bill Richardson, who last year was the first non-family
member to meet Suu Kyi, said Burma's military government has seriously
regressed.
''This was a very frustrating trip,'' told a news conference after
returning from a two-day visit to Burma. ''I got stiffed. I was
unsuccessful. I failed.''
Richardson said the government, which three times in the past year
rejected his requests to visit Burma, did not allow him to meet Suu Kyi.
When Richardson met 49-year-old Suu Kyi last year, she told him she
was willing to discuss anything with the military government except her
exile.
The SLORC has offered to free Suu Kyi, the daughter of the
assassinated architect of Burma's independence from Britain, on
condition that she leave the country.

AN ADVANCE unit of the Highland Gunners flew into Bosnia last night to
head the massive military operation to build up British forces.
As final battle plans were being drawn up, a British UN force
spokesman said a 36-man unit of the Royal Artillery's 19th Field
Regiment left the Croatian seaport of Split in two helicopters after
being briefed on arrival from Britain.
They reached the British UN base in the western town of Gornji Vakuf
after nightfall. Some were expected to deploy to the main British base
in Vitez not far to the north.
It's believed the Gunners' task will either be to take part in a
rescue of UN troops being held hostage by Bosnian Serbs or to prepare
the ground for a withdrawal.
The regiment flew from RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire in the first stage of
a massive reinforcement of the British and Nato presence in
Bosnia-Herzogovena.
Also heading for Bosnia were around a dozen signallers, including two
women, one a Scot. Lance Corporal Susan Taylor, 21, from Greenock, and
Private Tracey Farr, 24, from Abertillery, South Wales, are part of a
team which will set up a satellite communications network.
Two batteries from 19 Regiment, each consisting of six guns, will be
despatched within days. A third battery will form the regiment's
headquarters.
The RA tend to build up regiments from strong recruiting areas and 19
Regiment is known as the Highland Gunners because most of their men come
from the Highlands and Islands.
In all, more than 500 Highland Gunners will be in theatre by this time
next week.
The build up of UK troops in the troubled former republic heralds a
decisive stage in the civil war. The task for the Scottish gunners is
clear, although final objectives last night remained top secret.
It will be their duty to provide artillery cover for the 3500 men of
24 Airmobile Brigade when it is despatched into Bosnia-Herzegovenia over
the next few weeks.
The choice of 19 Regiment RA in this operation was no surprise.
Gunners from this Colchester-based regiment are specially trained to
work with the Airmobile Brigade.
Their particular expertise is in getting light artillery weapons into
the field, normally airlifted by helicopters, and in action within the
shortest space of time. Their guns can also be towed behind Land-Rovers.
They are specially trained to get into the thick of battle with their
105mm howitzers, underslung on Puma or Chinook helicopters.
This is a reliable, robust, and extraordinarly accurate weapon that
more than proved its worth during the Falklands conflict. It has a range
of more than 10 kilometres.
As the reconnaissance party flew in yesterday, it did not know whether
it would be under the command of the United Nations, Nato, or the
British High Command.
On departure, and while they waited a decision, the soldiers wore blue
berets, but were prepared to discard them at a moment's notice.
This will be the first time that 24 Airmobile Brigade from Colchester
will have been deployed operationally.
It will take the brigade some weeks before it is finally established
in theatre. However, when fully operational it will be a formidable
force.
Apart from the support from the Highland Gunners, the troops from the
1st Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the
Light Infantry are equipped with 84 Milan anti-tank weapons systems.

Washington, Tuesday
THE last three bodies of victims of the Oklahoma City bombing were
recovered from the ruins last night. They were two women who worked in a
bank on the second floor of the building, and a disabled pensioner who
had gone there to cash a cheque.
He was reported missing a month after the April 19 bombing, when his
landlord noted that he had not paid his rent. A final total of 168
people were killed, including three killed in another building and a
rescue worker killed by falling masonry.
The bodies of the last victims could not be recovered safely because
they were buried deep in the rubble, and digging for them would have
brought down the ruined walls.
On May 23, the shell of the building was demolished with 100lb of
dynamite. Since then, bulldozers and front-loaders have been removing
hundreds of tons of debris every day.
The whole site should be cleared by the end of this week. A memorial,
possibly a garden with a monument, will be placed there.

AN anxious mother last night begged Army chiefs to find out where her
captive Royal Welch Fusilier son is being held.
Justin Morgan, 23, is among 33 British soldiers being held as
hostages, but he was not paraded with the others on Serb television.
Audrey Morgan, 54, of Bargoed, Mid Glamorgan, watched video footage of
the pictures but could not see her son.
''I'm sick with worry. The Army rang to tell me Justin has been taken
hostage, but they don't know where he is. They say the hostages are
being treated well, but how do I know that's true when I don't even know
where he is being held?''
Mrs Morgan added: ''Justin should never have been put in the position
where he could have been taken captive. They should have been pulled out
last week when the Serbs started taking hostages.''
Some relatives have called on John Major to negotiate their freedom on
any terms and withdraw British troops from Bosnia.
Pauline Jones, whose 19-year-old son Lee has been captured, said: ''My
first thought when I heard the news was that I would rather have him
back here on the dole than out there.''
Families of other hostage soldiers spoke of their relief at seeing
their loved ones on the TV clips.
Corporal David Storey, 28, of Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, best man at
the wedding of fellow captive Sergeant Nick Warren, was pictured.
A family spokesman said: ''It's a huge relief to see David safe and
well, but we feel he should never be there anyway. The British troops
should have been pulled out when all the trouble started.''
Christine Mitchell, of Coity, near Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, returned
from a Caribbean honeymoon to be told that her son, Fusilier Steven
McCabe, 21, was among the hostages.
''Steven was supposed to come home for his 21st birthday and to
celebrate my wedding two weeks ago,'' she said, ''but they just couldn't
get a flight out of Bosnia. I was devastated to know he had been
captured, but it is good to know he is safe and looks well.''
Army support staff were keeping in touch with the Fusiliers' families.
''Every family of those being held is being telephoned regularly by
the regiment to reassure and keep them in touch with any news of the
situation,'' said a spokesman.

When they were not busy revolutionising medicine, Lister and his
colleagues could often be found dicing with gout, or worse, as WILLIAM
HUNTER reports
WHEN eminent doctors last century let down their hair, of which they
had ample, they gave themselves a higher old time than could have been
good for the health of the nation.
Abundant was their feasting. Distinguished beards got wrapped around
seven or eight courses. A heavy aroma of cigar smoke hung over the
after-dinner table. Strong drink passed lips. At one repast attended by
professors of medicine the purvey permitted one bottle of champagne
apiece. And that was for starters, just to clear the tubes. Sterner
refreshment followed.
Since there were always brilliant surgeons in the company, it could
have been a less than bright idea to be on their list of patients on the
morning after, or even the afternoon. In congenial bickering and hearty
singing had ended their nights before as members of the Western Medical
Club.
To be fair, they kept their blow-outs to two a year. Any damage to
their public esteem was softened by seldom descending on the same hotel
twice in succession. And they kept their shindigs to themselves,
inviting guests to join them, but only a select few. They were discreet.
Confidentiality, however, has been blown. Ahead of the l50th
anniversary of the Western Medical Club its secrets are out, or a few
among the earliest of them are. Somebody has been telling tales outside
the club.
In plain truth there have been more than one clype, and all of them
members. They were the chiels, otherwise the secretaries of the club,
entrusted to take notes at the dinners, even to the point of the evening
when it was hard for them to be clear just what their colleagues were
talking about.
From the leather, brass-locked minute book of the WMC (as it is
sometimes called) the often Pickwickian proceedings of the pick of West
of Scotland men of medicine have been revealed in a history.
In Just A Minute Or Two Alistair A Clark takes his narrative only to
l902. It means his account covers a time of revolutionary progress in
the treatment of diseases and the care of health. When James Simpson, in
Edinburgh, discovered the use of chloroform as an anaesthetic, the
Western Medical Club had been meeting for two years.
In his introduction to the book Dr Clark concedes that an extra reason
for his volunteering to be the club's chronicler is that he lives a few
miles from Bowling, then a health resort, the imaginative choice of the
WMC for its first dinner.
Most years afterwards the members dined together twice. They wintered
in Glasgow. For summer meetings they took trips into the country, or
else messed on a pleasure boat on Loch Lomond. Everywhere they went was
with style. Sometimes a special train was chartered. When the meal moved
to Paisley, only the town hall was grand enough for it.
As to their conduct, it is occasionally necessary to read between the
lines.
For instance, on an Aberfoyle outing an outsider remarked with some
surprise on how good was the behaviour. Because one of the group was the
medical superintendent of Gartnavel mental hospital, Dr D Yellowlees, it
had been assumed by the stranger that his companions were, not
colleagues, but patients.
Around l845 a surgeon's knife had limited application. Limbs were
amputated, abscesses incised, bladder stones removed. Surgeons operated
wearing their frock coats. Later, pioneering the use of antiseptics at
Glasgow Royal, even Joseph Lister did not score ordinary pass marks. Dr
Clark in his thesis records a two-year period when not many more than
half of Lister's patients survived after amputations.
Comparative failure did not bring any diminution in the confident
belief of the profession that they were God's lance-corporals on earth.
Against the odds, they made heartening progress in treating injuries
and improving how people lived. They deserved their rare summer outings
together, and the winter banquets, which succeeding secretaries confided
to the minute book were usually hilarious though never uproarious.
Just A Minute Or Two gives some candid glimpses of notable men at
their ease.
George Macleod, Lister's successor as professor of surgery at Glasgow
University, a tall, handsome fellow, was nicknamed The Duke for how
nattily he dressed.
He made it a rule of agreeable behaviour always to raise his hat to
greet a student. He explained: ''I long ago made up my mind that if I
could teach the students nothing else I could teach them manners.''
While most doctors who attended the Crimea War went as sightseers,
Macleod became the surgeon at the civil hospital in Smyrna. He was one
of three club members who served in the war.
Nearer home, Andrew Buchanan made a humanely angry survey of how many
of Glasgow's poor died of starvation. He wrote: ''I have described the
minds of these poor people as in a state of torpor.
''The torpor ought perhaps to be accounted a blessing, as it prevents
them from speculating on the cause of their own misery.''
William Gairdner, another regular WMC diner, became the city's first,
but part-time, medical officer of health, while Robert Perry, chairman
of the club when its rules were agreed, wondered how Glasgow had escaped
a revolution when ''a fourth part of the earnings of the industrious
poor is taken from them to keep up the landlords' rents, the wealth of
the Sugar Lords, and an expensive army of civil servants and military
officers to keep them in order''.
Dr Perry was probably the first physician to differentiate typhus from
typhoid fever.
Although all agreed as to that contribution, club members were capable
of falling out amicably about nearly everything else.
In 1887 the secretary made the mistake of asking for opinions about
the winter dinner which he compounded with the further mistake of
listening to the views expressed. Then, doggedly, he minuted them:
Dr Macleod was not sure that dining at separate tables was an
improvement. Dr Mather thought it was.
Dr Lennox thought that the dinner was the best Club dinner he had ever
partaken of, while his neighour demurred to that opinion.
Dr Yellowlees thought that the cigars were rather green; another
gentleman thought that they were too mild; and a third that they were
too strong.
One gentleman thought that there was too little music and singing,
another that there was too much; one that there was too little dinner
and too little variety, another that there was too much, and thus the
evening passed pleasantly away, leaving the Committee in possession of a
mass of valuable information which was calculated to make their
arrangements for the future comfort of the members a very simple matter
indeed.
Second opinions were not called for in the matter of Joseph Lister's
membership. It was withdrawn. He was banned for a while. Lister's sin
was to have skipped four dinners.

<RECORDNO>978125029</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE man who commanded the British Military Mission in Yugoslavia and
fought with the partisans against the Nazis said yesterday he believed
any escalation of fighting could drag on for many years.
Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 84, fought with Tito in the mountains during a
protracted campaign which caused thousands of German troops to be sent
to the region.
Guerrilla tactics pinned them down for weeks at a time as the
mountainous terrain could be held by small forces against superior
units. Sir Fitzroy believes even today's precision bombing would not
shift determined fighters.
If the military build-up of UN forces cannot contain the situation, he
predicts an arduous and prolonged campaign.
''The basic facts are the Yugoslavs are very determined fighters and
capable of going on for a long time. Weapons are very different from the
last war but any campaign would be open ended,'' he said.
''The problem is that the United Nations and Nato have gone in without
knowing what to do. That is what should have been established first.
''The Serbs, Slovenes, Croats, and Muslims will have to live with each
other in the end. They will have to trade with each other to survive.''
Sir Fitzroy is regarded as a hero in the Balkans. He is bitterly sad
that his friends have turned on one another after over 40 years of peace
and comparative prosperity under Tito.
He believes the UN would never agree to impose peace by a massive
invasion and is incapable of resolving the war. He said it could
escalate into an international conflict as member states recognised
former Yugoslav republics as independent states.

Los Angeles, Tuesday
POLICE shot a man who apparently scaled a fence to get into the back
yard of Madonna's Hollywood Hills home while she was away.
Robert Roland Hoskins, 37, was shot three times in the arm and abdomen
last night, police said. He was in fair condition in hospital today.
''There have been reports made by Madonna that he has been threatening
her and stalking her,'' said police detective Mike McDonagh.
Hoskins, who claimed to be Madonna's husband, confronted a security
guard in the back yard, about 40ft from the house, he added.
Police planned to transfer Hoskins to a prison ward and book him for
investigation of attempted burglary.
Last summer, a 26-year-old drifter from Arizona was sentenced to a
year in jail for scaling Madonna's fence and fighting a police officer.
Todd Lawrence also claimed to be Madonna's husband and stalked her for
at least two weeks before his arrest.--AP.

Neftegorsk, Tuesday
RESCUE workers fought today to free dozens of people trapped alive in
the rubble of this earthquake-flattened town, but progress was hampered
by a lack of equipment and problems in identifying the dead.
Officials said 32 survivors had been detected in the town on Russia's
Sakhalin island after mechanical work stopped and rescue workers shouted
down into the ruins.
The final death toll was still expected to exceed 2000.
''Now we are trying to get them out. But there are no less than 2000
others trapped, maybe dead. God willing that the death toll would be
less than 2000,'' said Alexander Avdoshin, spokesman for the Emergencies
Ministry.
The Ministry said that 377 dead and 372 wounded had been removed from
the rubble of Neftegorsk.
Of the dead, just 127, including 39 children, had been identified.
''The reason is that the town's policemen and teachers, who knew by
name their fellow citizens better than anyone else, nearly all died,''
Public Russian Television said.
Rescue workers said earlier that they would redouble efforts to find
more survivors among the ruins of multi-storey blocks of flats that
collapsed when a powerful earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter
scale, tore through Neftegorsk on Sunday morning as the 3200 townspeople
slept.
Tass said the operation was hampered by a lack of lifting cranes and
the area's chaotic communications. Sakhalin Island is 4500 miles and
eight time zones east of Moscow.
Russia has mounted a big operation involving 800 specialists, 18
planes, and 14 helicopters to rescue survivors and ferry the injured to
hospital.
Officials and experts blamed shoddy building work in the 1960s and 70s
and the closure of seismological warning stations for the death toll.
President Boris Yeltsin, in a televised address to the nation,
promised to pay up to 50 million roubles (#6600) to every victim's
family and declared tomorrow a day of mourning.
''For you who have suffered and lost your near ones . . .
you grieve. It is hard for you. But know that all Russia is with
you,'' he said.
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin abandoned his holiday to
head a commission on the consequences of the quake.
Worse could be to come, however. Alexander Sidorin, head of the
seismological laboratory at Russia's Institute of Physics, said the Far
Eastern peninsula of Kamchatka could soon be hit by a stronger
earthquake.
''A lot of Russian seismologists are worried about the area around
Kamchatka. There is a lot of data to suggest we should expect a serious
earthquake there,'' said Sidorin.
Aftershocks rippled occasionally through the shattered town. On the
outskirts, earthmovers cleared ground for graves.

LANCE-CORPORAL Susan Taylor's mother caught a glimpse of her daughter
on the television evening news and said she had to fight to keep back
the tears.
Earlier a brief phone call from the 21-year-old to her parents
informed them that she was one of only two female Royal Signallers
dispatched yesterday to the Bosnian town of Split.
Lance-corporal Taylor and Private Tracey Farr, 24, from Abertillery in
Wales, are part of a team of around a dozen signallers sent to Bosnia to
set up a satellite communication's network.
Last night, at their home in Hillside Road, Greenock, Mrs Maureen
Taylor and her husband, Ian, described their daughter's four-year
military career with modest pride. It is a career, they said, she loves
but one that now leaves them anxiously waiting for news.
Pictures of Susan in her military uniform hang on the family's sitting
room wall. On a sideboard is another snapshot of their eldest daughter
on her last tour of Bosnia, dressed in fatigues and standing beside a
satellite dish.
Mrs Taylor said her daughter had decided on an Army career after
leaving behind the town's Wellington Academy and a Saturday job in John
Menzies. Since joining up she has been stationed at Nuneaton and was
made a lance-corporal after a year and a half.
''I've not seen Susan since March 8 but she phoned to let us know that
she was going out there. It's her second tour of Bosnia, she was out
there from August to February, all over the place including Split and
Sarajevo. It's more worrying this time but she sounded fine.''
Replaying a video of the news bulletin they added that a succession of
sleepless nights lie ahead as they fret about their daughter's safety.
Until Susan gets an opportunity to contact them they will be watching
television, hearts in mouths. Mrs Taylor said her daughter had been on
numerous training exercises including a stint in Kuwait but this time
the family did not know when she would be back.

THE siren voice of modern British politics in times of war, Labour MP
Tam Dalyell, is determined to air his concerns in the Commons today over
open-ended military involvement in Bosnia -- even if that means going
against his party leadership.
The Linlithgow MP yesterday informed Mr Tony Blair's office of his
concerns and gave warning that, if he did not receive reassurances
during today's recalled session of the Commons, he would follow his
conscience and speak out.
He once warned his own party leadership against sending troops into
Northern Ireland, and became best known for fighting with Premier
Margaret Thatcher over the Falklands conflict and the US bombing of
Libya.
Now he is prepared to become a dissident voice again, speaking out
against the sending of more British troops to the Balkans, unless he can
be persuaded that there is a convincing short-term gameplan for using
them quickly and getting them out.
His threat to break ranks is sure to enrage Mr Blair, who is making
great efforts to forge for himself a statesman-like role at the head of
New Labour as a responsible government-in-waiting.
But Mr Dalyell believes it is more important that he speak out now,
whatever the potential electoral consequences. Last night he said he
told Tony Blair's office: ''For God's sake don't be a Michael Foot,
endorsing the Prime Minister before you know what the position is and
what we have been committed to.
''If I am told that legally they were entitled under the small print
to carry out the air strike, they may or may not be right. But either
way it is absolute lunacy to do that without agreeing that with the
Russians.
''If they are serious about the authority of the international
community, what the bloody hell are they doing carrying this out in that
context? The key question is, what are we getting ourselves into?''
Mr Dalyell insisted that it was not his intention to rock the boat
unnecessarily, but he would be listening to the Prime Minister carefully
for answers to a number of questions:
* Were the Russians now on our side?
* When did the Prime Minister envisage bringing the troops home?
* Are they there as observers or peacekeepers?
* If the latter, what cover are they being given, particularly by
tanks?
Mr Dalyell said Britain appeared to be moving towards confronting
forces which had scared off Stalin's forces, tied down 37 of Hitler's
divisions, and were the world's leading exponents of guerrilla warfare.
He said he would not give carte blanche support to a role that may
mean British troops being involved for his lifetime, ''and I think it
could come to that. Remember Russia in Afghanistan, remember us in
Ireland'', he added.
Mr Dalyell, insisting he did not rebel on the trivial, said: ''I have
only ever rebelled on the constitution and on Europe, although I spoke
up on the Falklands and spoke out on the Gulf. If I have rebelled in the
past, I fear that on Bosnia I may have to do so again.''
A large cross-section of Scottish MPs are expected to be present at
Westminster today although, since the Bosnia issue is seen as relatively
non-partisan, people with prior engagements will be excused.

Allan Laing talks to a Scots novelist
whose creative passport to success has been
an international approach to his work
SOMEONE once asked the novelist Philip Kerr if he considered himself
to be a Scottish writer. ''If by that,'' he replied, ''you mean 'Would I
be happy to be on the Scottish table at Waterson's?' then the answer is
probably no.''
Kerr is a Scottish author who is refreshingly un-Scottish. That is his
strength. Or one of them. And it is probably why his books have been so
successful. He is, in literary terms at least, an internationalist. His
latest novel, Gridiron, is an ingeniously terrifying techno-thriller set
in Los Angeles in the near future. The backdrops to his previous work
have included post-Soviet Russia, and wartime Berlin. Kerr is clearly a
writer with a creative passport in mind.
''I would never want to stick to readers who are just found north of
the Border. I want to find as wide an international audience as
possible,'' he admits. Which is not to suggest that he does not still
feel Scottish, though he left the country some 20 years ago.
''There is always a real emotional tie to wherever you spent most of
your childhood. But it doesn't matter where you come from; it is who you
are and where you are going that is important. The thing about Scots is
that they seem to take refuge in this 'Caledonianism'. They wear it like
a badge, like some sort of Aids ribbon,'' he says.
Philip Kerr was born in Edinburgh to working-class parents who,
through career advancement, became middle-class parents. Half-way
through his secondary school education (at Stewart's Melville) in the
early seventies his late father, who worked in the construction
industry, moved the family to England.
''When I first went there, as a 14 or 15-year-old, I was a very
Scottish Scot, forever defending Scottish football and Scottish rugby
and picking up on people who said 'England' when they actually meant
'Britain'. But there came a time when I had to say, well, life is too
short and I'm not going to bother any more,'' he explains.
Gradually, the broad Scots accent slipped away (there is now no sign
of it) as he attempted, as he says with a hint of irony, ''to merge
seamlessly into the society into which I had emigrated''. He wanted to
study English at university but his father persuaded him to read law
instead. After graduating from Birmingham University he decided that he
was not yet ready for the treadmill of employment (''I probably never
have been,'' he says), so he continued his legal studies with a
post-grad course in jurisprudence, the philosophy of law.
''I knew that I wanted to write books so I thought I'd go for a life
in academia. I was looking for a job which would let me skive off to
write. But the academic world was going through a bad time and there
were no jobs around so I decided to do the next best thing. I became a
copywriter with an advertising agency,'' he explains.
Kerr is more than willing to admit that, in part at least, he writes
for money. ''If I am honest, I spent so many years not writing for money
-- writing novels which were not being published and receiving so many
rejection slips. But now I get paid such a lot of money and people
assume that that is what I do, write for money. Money is great, of
course, but it is not the be all and end all,'' he says.
His early unpublished work was, in his own words, ''the poor man's
Martin Amis''. The problem was that there was, and is, only one Martin
Amis and that particular Martin Amis has the Martin Amis market
cornered. ''And also I was not as good a writer as him,'' he admits.
So Kerr made a conscious decision to write something that (a) someone
would want to publish and (b) that people would want to read. He was, he
adds, almost thinking like a marketing man. During his time at
university he had studied in depth a great deal of German philosophy and
had become fascinated by the historical period which saw the growth of
fascism.
''I was interested in writing a crime novel, not so much about the
character or the idea, but about the place and the period. I wanted to
write about what it must have been like to be an ordinary German in
these extraordinary times,'' he explains.
So he wrote March Violets, his first published work and the book which
introduced the character, Bernie Gunter. It was the first of a trilogy
of noir novels featuring the Berlin-based private eye (The Pale
Criminal, and A German Requiem followed). It was also an astonishingly
accomplished debut for a young author.
He recalls: ''I was trying to write the kind of novel which Raymond
Chandler would have written if he'd lived in Berlin instead of Los
Angeles, if Phillip Marlowe had been German instead of American. The
Bernie Gunter novels were all about small crimes which might have larger
and more sinister motives.''
Kerr is one of the few British novelists who have been able to bridge
the gap between mainstream fiction and ''serious'' fiction. He considers
himself lucky to have a foot in both camps. Part of the secret, he says,
is his decision to keep doing something different. He wanted to avoid
the crime writer's curse -- being persuaded by the publisher to write
safe, and continue writing books about the same character again and
again -- so he decided to quit Berlin while he was still ahead.
His next move was a bold one. It was around the time when Silence of
The Lambs was on release and Kerr, a movie fan, found himself being
constantly told about how wonderful a character was Hannibal Lecter. So
he went along to see the film.
''The thing was that, as far as I could see, he never said anything of
any great intelligence. So I began to develop this idea about a serial
killer who has enormous intellectual pretensions and who gets carried
away with believing himself to be a great philosopher,'' he explains.
The result was a deep, dark, and disturbing novel called A
Philosophical Investigation, set in a futuristic London and in which the
villain, a serial killer, quoted Wittgenstein and the heroic protagonist
was, curiously, a female detective. Kerr wrote it without any great
expectations for its success. It was, however, well-received by both the
critics and the readers -- and the film rights were sold to Paramount.
It was shortly afterwards that the BBC approached Kerr and asked him
to adapt a little-known Russian crime novelist's work for a possible
television series. He started with the best intentions but soon
discovered that the books -- about a detective in the Soviet republic
during the Stalin era -- simply were not very good. However, it did whet
his appetite and he suggested to the BBC that they might consider a
series about the Russian mafia.
''They liked the idea and I spent several weeks research with the
Central Investigation Board in Leningrad. I'd remembered that when
Graham Greene was asked to write a screenplay for The Third Man he wrote
it in a novella form as a kind of aide memoire. So I decided to do the
same and I wrote a story about 150 to 200 pages long and then worked it
into a script. The BBC just sat on it so, after a while, I got the
novella out and I decided to tweak it here and there and turn it into a
novel,'' he recalls.
It became Kerr's fifth book, Dead Meat, and was eventually developed
(by Kerr) into Grushko, a one-off film by the BBC starring Brian Cox as
the eponymous Russian policeman.
And so to Gridiron, Kerr's latest work. It is probably not entirely
coincidental that it reads like a film script. The comparison which
glares out at you, which grabs you by the throat, is Michael Crichton.
And Phillip Kerr can live with that.
He says: ''Crichton is a great writer and his research is fantastic.
But I can honestly say that I did not write the novel with a film in
mind. But I think there may be a movie quality in my own head and that
is perhaps the way I imagine things.''
The villain in Gridiron is a building. No. That's wrong. The building
is the killing machine, the armoury; the villain is actually the
computer system which runs the building. A giant Chinese electronics
conglomerate commissions one of the world's great architects to create
its flagship building in downtown LA. It is a so-called smart building
which functions entirely through a central computer called Abraham.
But Abraham is not your regular computer. It, or he if you like, is on
a learning curve. The more information he receives, the more experience
he gains, the more fuzzy logic he acquires, the greater his abilities
become. Until it seems he has a mind of his own. Abraham then takes on a
deeply sinister aspect. The computer becomes a serial killer. A
collection of psychopathic microchips. The machine as God. A dozen
people are trapped in the building and, one by one, they get bumped off
by the sheer ingenuity of the machine. This is not sick-building
syndrome; this edifice is terminally ill. The book is probably Kerr's
best (and certainly most commercial) work to date.
Even before Gridiron was printed, let alone published, it was snapped
up by Working Title, the British film production company which made Four
Weddings and a Funeral. The subsequent deal, reputedly for a sum
approaching #640,000, has made Phillip Kerr a wealthy man.
Working Title have appointed a scriptwriter and the movie will go into
production (at Ridley and Tony Scott's Shepperton Studios outside
London) early in the new year, with exterior shots in LA.
Gridiron is gloriously and unapologetically mainstream. Kerr says he
consciously tried to make it an easier read. He has little time for that
brand of precious English writer who consider ''populist'' to be a dirty
word.
''They obviously think it is more important to please a couple of
people on the New York Times book review and the Granta audience rather
than to reach a wider readership. The problem is that they often have a
contempt for storytelling because it isn't fashionable to be a
storyteller these days. But my starting place has always been the
story,'' he adds.
* Gridiron by Philip Kerr is published by Chatto and Windus, #14.99.

BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander
General Ratko Mladic are used to being the hate figures of the Bosnian
conflict.
Yesterday's warning from John Major that they will be held personally
responsible for the safety of the British hostages will not worry them
unduly -- they have already been named as war crimes suspects by the
United Nations.
Dr Radovan Karadzic, 50, is known primarily for his support of the
policy of ethnic cleansing aimed at wiping out all non-Serbs from
Bosnia.
Surprisingly for such an extreme Bosnian nationalist, he is not a
Bosnian himself but was born in Montenegro. He went to Sarajevo only as
a teenager and then went into medicine, finally qualifying as a
psychiatrist.
A man of contradictions, he has published several volumes of poetry --
even winning a poetry prize last year awarded by the Russian Writers'
Union -- and is known for his charm.
0 But his political skills are his greatest asset. Loved by his people
as a visionary, he can whip up a crowd with fiery speeches and pick his
way through negotiations with equal ease. His main tactic, most
observers point out, is to lie. He is on record as denying the existence
of Bosnian Serb snipers as dozens fell to their bullets in Sarajevo.
When the state of the prisoners in Serb death camps was revealed,
Karadzic for a long time spluttered denials that any mistreatment had
occured.
He did not emerge into the political limelight until 1990 when, after
a spell in prison for theft of government funds, he helped found a
nationalist party.
General Mladic is an altogether simpler man than his political leader.
According to UN negotiators, he is a madman bent on power.
A short, stocky man, he has called himself the ''Napoleon of Bosnia''
and, many feel, is now the real power in the Bosnian Serb leadership.
Some observers say the suicide of his 23-year-old daughter Ana last
year finally unhinged him: whatever the truth, those in the conflict
know he is an extremely dangerous man.
Mladic, 52, was born in Herzegovina and his father was killed by
Croatian fascists shortly before the end of the Second World War. He
graduated from military academy in 1965 and rose up the ranks until, as
the former Yugoslavia began to fall apart in 1991, he was sent to Knin
to lead the Yugoslav army there.
His success in ruthlessly consolidating the Serb position in the
breakaway Croat republic saw him promoted to general in 1992.
He is revered by his soldiers, whom he led, as the West dithered, to
capture huge swathes of Croatian and then Bosnian territory.
He has called the UN's bluff on many occasions, signing ceasefires
only to break them almost immediately and bombing the protected towns of
Sarajevo, Bihac and other enclaves with impunity.
He is a fervent Serb nationalist and has not stopped at ordering
numerous atrocities against Bosnian Muslims who have got in the way of
his war for ''Serbdom''.
In 1993, he even threatened terrorist action in the West: ''If they
bomb me, I'll bomb London. One furious Serb can do a lot of damage with
a match.''

DETECTIVES made several arrests yesterday in the murder of a former
policeman who was doused with petrol and set alight.
But four men arrested at the weekend in connection with the killing of
Mr David Stedman, 67, were released without charge.
Leicestershire police refused to say how many people were being held
last night in connection with the attack on Mr Stedman at his flat on
Leicester's Beaumont Leys housing estate on Saturday night.
The former Hampshire PC ran screaming into the street as neighbours
tried desperately to put out the flames with a bed quilt. He died 13
hours later in hospital from 100% burns.
Four men were arrested on Sunday and magistrates granted permission to
hold them further. But they were later released.
Police said they found a fire extinguisher containing petrol outside
Mr Stedman's home. It is believed to have been used to turn him into a
human torch.
Yesterday on the estate -- a sprawling suburb of mainly council
housing built in the 1970s -- there was shock at the murder, but a
reluctance to talk for fear of reprisals.

NOVELIST Shirley Conran has posed topless at the age of 62 because she
is so thrilled with her breast reduction surgery.
''I want women to realise once and for all there is no shame or
embarrassment in admitting that they've had cosmetic surgery,'' she
said. ''If they want or need such surgery they should just go for it.
I've done it; any woman can.''
The writer spent #7000 to have surgeons at London's Harley Street
Clinic trim her bust from 46DD to 36B. She also had a tummy tuck and an
appendix scar removed.
She is seen topless, swimming in the sea near her Monte Carlo home,
for the June issue of OK! magazine.
''Everybody in Monaco sees me at the beach topless all summer. I
thought it would be really silly if I didn't allow others outside Monaco
to see me topless,'' she said.
The photographs, wich show thin lines under her bust as the only sign
of the operation, would be ''reassuring to other women'', she said.
The writer, whose work includes Superwoman, Lace, and Savages, had her
surgery last October. She had 1[1/4]lb removed from each breast and 3lb
from her stomach.
''It came out at #7000, cheaper than buying a car, but I didn't want a
car and I did want this,'' said Ms Conran, ex-wife of design guru Sir
Terence Conran and mother of fashion designer, Jasper.

TWO unions opposed each other in court yesterday over redundancy plans
for a Highland oil rig yard that have caused an unofficial strike by 450
workers.
Members of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union joined the
management of the yard at Ardersier in persuading Lord Dawson to lift a
court order granted last week in favour of a member of the boilermakers'
union, GMB. The AEEU feared that the order would increase the risk of
its members being paid off.
After yesterday's decision, GMB called on Barmac, the owners of
fabrication yards at Nigg and Ardersier, to enter into urgent talks.
Mr Jim Moohan, the union's chief negotiator for the oil rig
construction industry, said that about 450 workers were still on strike
over the decision to make 100 Nigg ''transferees'' redundant at
Ardersier.
The interim interdict granted at the Court of Session last Wednesday
banned Brown and Root McDermott Fabricators Ltd (Barmac) from selecting
GMB member Mr Paul McKay for redundancy solely on the basis of his
length of service at Ardersier.
Mr McKay, of Kirkside, Alness, Ross-shire, argued that his total
length of service with the firm and its predecessors, Brown and Root
Highland Fabricators and McDermott Scotland, should be taken into
account.
Yesterday Barmac, which was not represented last week, asked Lord
Dawson to lift the interdict. Its plea was supported by two AEEU
members.
Lord Dawson was told that at the beginning of the year Barmac became
the owner of two yards at Nigg and Ardersier that were previously under
separate ownership. In March, workers at Nigg were offered redundancy or
transfer to Ardersier and about 100, including Mr McKay, agreed to
transfer.
Barmac now planned further redundancies at Ardersier and had decided
to select workers who transferred from Nigg, regardless of length of
service.
Mr Ian Truscott, counsel for Barmac, told Lord Dawson yesterday that
the company had inherited two separate redundancy agreements -- one for
each yard.
The Nigg agreement with the last-in, first-out condition was with the
boilermakers, while there was a different agreement with the AEEU.
Attempts to negotiate a common redundancy agreement to cover both
yards had been unsuccessful and Barmac had decided to impose a
redundancy package known as Option Four. The result was that length of
service at Nigg had not been taken into account in deciding job losses
at Ardersier.
The AEEU had agreed to Option Four, but the GMB was opposed.

ILLEGAL immigrant Joy Gardner died as a result of being gagged while
being deported, and not due to a head injury, a consultant pathologist
told an Old Bailey jury yesterday.
Dr Iain West rejected another pathologist's suggestion that Mrs
Gardner, a mother-of-two, was killed by an injury caused when her head
hit a hard surface.
''Death primarily occurred during active restraint,'' said Dr West. He
said the gag had reduced her ability to draw oxygen into the blood and
supply other organs properly.
''Head injury was not a major factor leading to her death.''
Dr West was giving evidence in the trial of three police officers
accused of the manslaughter of Mrs Gardner at her north London home.
Detective Sergeant Linda Evans, Constable Colin Whitby, and Constable
John Burrell, have all denied unlawful killing on August 1, I993.
Mrs Gardner, 40, died after officers, sent to deport her to her native
Jamaica, gagged her using 13ft of sticky plaster. She was also trussed
with leather restraining belts around her waist, thighs, and ankles, the
court was told.
She suffered extensive and fatal brain damage due to asphyxia, through
the obstruction of her mouth by the gag, the prosecution alleges.
Dr West told the jury the gag may have been entirely responsible for
cardiac arrest.
The trial was adjourned until today.

CLOSURE of the Aberdeen-based Torry Research Station could delay
reaction to food safety emergencies in Scotland, according to the
scientists' union.
The Institute of Professionals, Managers, and Specialists,
representing the almost 100 scientists working at the station, said it
was alarmed at reports that the 65-year-old station would be axed
because of Government cost-cutting.
A spokesman for the IPMS said yesterday: ''Closure would leave
Scotland without a food safety laboratory, would remove #3.5m a year
from the Scottish economy, and disrupt key research into food poisoning
outbreaks which cost the UK #1000m a year.''
He added: ''Torry has won a deserved reputation for its work on
safety, quality, and authenticity of food and is the UK's reference
laboratory for shellfish poisons, botulism scares, salmonella, and
listeria problems.''
An announcement about the future of the research institute is expected
early next month, but Westminster sources have suggested its research
role is likely to be transferred to a new, purpose-built centre in
Derby, which is due to open next year.
Dr Norval Strachan, a union leader at Torry, listed the drawbacks of
closure, including:
* waste of public money spent at Torry to refurbish food science
research and development facilities;
* destruction of an efficient team of scientists built up over the
years to ensure safe food;
* loss of a unique Government facility in Scotland.

THE Princess Royal came face to face with her historic namesake
yesterday when she opened the new Scottish Record Office building at
Sighthill, Edinburgh.
Staff at the custom-build #10m archive presented her with a portrait
of her 18th century ancestor.
After thanking Keeper of Records Patrick Caddell for the gift, the
slim Princess Royal took a look at the portrait showing a plump Queen
Anne and asked: ''Can you spot the family resemblance?''
Mr Caddell explained that the portrait had been copied from the
masthead of one of their most prized documents, an original
examplification of the 1707 Treaty of the Union.
The Princess later opened and toured the heraldic exhibition ''Lions
and Thistles'' at the City Art Centre.
She had been welcomed to the city by Lord Provost Norman Irons.
At the opening of the Scottish Record Office, she planted a rowan tree
then was shown around the building, which will house some of Scotland's
most historic documents.
She met Dr Alan Borthwick, one of six curators responsible for sorting
through new papers bequeathed to the nation.
During the visit she was presented with a posy by six-year-old Rhona
Campbell, daughter of one of the workers at the offices.
One member of staff said Princess Anne had showed particular interest
in the restoration of water damaged archives and added: ''She knew quite
a lot about how to repair water-damaged documents and said she had
picked up the knowledge after the fire at Windsor Castle.''

Style-conscious Scots can enjoy a special piece of catwalk action next
month at a fashion extravaganxa with a difference. Francesca Fearon
reports on the show where the dream outfit can become reality for the
audience
THE opportunity to buy an outfit off the model's back almost the
moment she steps off the catwalk is an advantage that not even the
fashion pros who trawl the international collections can experience.
Press and buyers may view next season's collections six months in
advance and long for that sweet little sweater, the ultra-slim capri
pants, and the must-have bag, but they have to wait several months to
claim them for themselves. They are frustrated fashion-wannabes just
like everyone else.
So the arrival of the Clothes Show-Show in Glasgow from June 17-20 is
giving Scotland's style-conscious an opportunity which even fashion
insiders rarely experience. Part of this big fashion extravaganza is a
huge catwalk show with UK's top models wearing clothes designed by Helen
Storey, John Richmond, Paul Costelloe, and leading Scottish designers
like Rina da Prato.
The event is brilliant theatre like you would only ever witness on a
Gaultier, Galliano, Westwood, and Versace catwalk. Even inside the
fashion world showmanship is rare. Beyond the drama and the glamour what
makes these catwalk shows even more enticing is that many of the clothes
can be bought there and then.
Everything that hits the catwalk is backed up by designer stands in
the main exhibition hall. There designers will be selling their current
collections along with samples at specially reduced prices. They will
also be giving previews of what is coming up for autumn, and in some
cases advance orders can be taken. Accessories are also included from
jewellery retailer Janet Fitch and Herald &amp; Heart Hatters -- their hats
have dressed many special occasions including those in Four Weddings and
a Funeral.
Of course, Scottish designers support many of the design teams of top
fashion labels, but we also nurture a number of young, directional
designers producing their own collections. There are da Prato, Sarah
Lawrence, the Mad Tarts, and Jacqui Burke, whose quirky colourful
collection using extraordinary fabrics is proving as popular in Japan as
it is here.
Da Prato is showing little knitted cotton halters with briefs or
minis, twin sets, lurex tie bikinis -- just the thing for Baywatch babes
-- and strappy, lurex clubland dresses. She will also give a sneak
preview of what's coming next season.
Sarah Lawrence, showing together with Diane Cook, has a fun, young
whimsical appeal to her collection. There are sweet crochet-flowered
necklines on her mohair slips and cropped mohair handknits appliqued
with dolls, hearts and crosses, in pretty lilacs and pinks. All of them
are in lightweight yarns, but there are also sophisticated cotton and
fluid viscose knits to greet the heat of summer days.
''It's the first time I've taken part in a big fair,'' says Lawrence.
''There are lots coming and it sounds exciting, it will also be
interesting to see who buys what.''
The next generation of Scottish designers will also have their
showcase, sponsored by Marks &amp; Spencer. M&amp;S is staging a competition for
Scotland's top seven fashion and textile colleges to test their talent
and inventiveness. Third and fourth-year students will be casting their
imagination towards the millennium and displaying designs and sample
garments of the work, leisure and special-occasion clothes they think we
will be wearing, as well as the all-important Hogmanay outfit to greet
the new century.
Before then, there will be cool but funky clubwear labels like Bass
Couture at the Clothes Show-Show. The addition of Komodo, Goi Goi,
Schuh, Razzle Dazzle, and Glasgow's Hoi Polloi just proves the event's
street cred. Hoi Polloi, known for their quirky, but innovative fashion,
have gender-bending retro-jackets and T-shirts as well as crop tops and
boob tubes.
According to co-owner Atholl Ross, the girls are buying seriously loud
jeans -- skin-tight in searing shades of pink, orange, and yellow --
which they wear with subdued tops. The guys, meanwhile, opt for brash
tops worn not with tartan trousers -- they were never into that -- but
fine checks and subtle stripes. ''We present ourselves as bright and
interesting,'' says Ross, who sees the show as a way of raising the
identity of their business.
This is the first time the Clothes Show has staged a major event in
Glasgow -- Clothes Show Live exhibition is usually held in Birmingham.
''We were getting a lot of letters from people in Scotland, who wanted
to come to our Birmingham exhibitions but found it an expensive day
out,'' explains Jeff Banks. ''We've wanted to come up for a couple of
years, but we wanted to be able to bring something new with us. That's
when we came up with the idea of Clothes Show-Show, which focuses on
world-class catwalk action which is open to the public.''
* Entry to the event and a seat in the fashion show are priced at #10
for weekdays and #15 for weekends, subject to a 5% booking fee. It is
advisable to book in advance as weekend fashion shows sell out quickly.
For full details call the telephone hotline number: 0141-248 9999.

UNIONS representing 198 staff working for the Highland and Islands
Airports Ltd (HIAL) yesterday launched a petition against threatened
privatisation.
Secretary of State Ian Lang announced on May 17 that he had set up a
review to see where the private sector might be involved in HIAL's
operation of nine airports in the Highlands and Islands from Sumburgh in
Shetland to Islay.
He took over responsibility for HIAL on April 1, before that date it
was managed as a private company by the Civil Aviation Authority. Its
transfer was recommended under the Prime Minister's Taking Stock
exercise.
Mr Alan Denny -- national officer of the Institute of Professionals,
Managers, and Specialists (IPMS) -- said yesterday: ''A total of #8m out
of the #12m budget HIAL works on comes from the Scottish Office.
''The safety levels employed by the company are to the highest
standard in line with official regulations, the number of staff working
for the company is the minimum necessary to maintain these levels.
''I am therefore at a loss to understand how the Highlands and Islands
or the Scottish Office will benefit from private sector involvement.''
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish Officer for the Civil and Public Services
Association (CPSA) agreed. He said: ''HIAL provides a vital service to
the communities and people of the Highlands and Islands. The service has
already been cut down to the bone and any further cuts will mean that
the present service could not be maintained.''
Meanwhile, Mr Hugh Hill, national officer of the Transport and General
Workers Union (TGWU), called for a period of stability. He said there
already had been internal reviews and HIAL staff had demonstrated that
they were efficient and effective.

THE free-flights debacle is seen by Wall Street as just one of a
series of mishaps that led Maytag Corporation to rid itself of Hoover
Europe.
Much was being made yesterday of the benefits of technological and
distributive alliances between Hoover Europe's US parent and the
subsidiary's new owner, Candy of Italy.
And, from the workforce's point of view, the fact that the
third-generation Italian family company has no prior involvement in this
area will probably provide some comfort.
However, Hoover Europe's free-flights promotion, which has already
cost the company #48m in airline tickets and has left a trail of
outstanding legal actions, coupled with the debacle over the closure of
a plant in Dijon which led to a slump in sales in France, were being
cited in New York as reasons for the proposed sale.
Before last year, when Hoover Europe managed to turn a $3.7m (#2.3m)
first-quarter loss into a full-year profit of $420,000 (#262,500), the
operation had proved a drain on its parent company. Yesterday's
announcement of its $170m (#106m) sale came as no surprise.
Mr Jeff Sprague, of New York stockbroker Paine Webber, said: ''Until
last year the company had suffered five consecutive annual losses over
in Europe. You add the free-flights fiasco and an embarrassing situation
in France a couple of years ago and it all adds up to being a real sore
spot to the company.''
London-based Lehman Brothers, which is advising Maytag, declined to
discuss the fine detail of the deal, including the responsibility for
any outstanding claims relating to the free-flights offer.
However, it appears that Hoover Europe management will be able to put
the debacle behind them and that Maytag will pick up any future
liabilities.

A CREW member of the world's oldest operating wooden sailing ship, the
Maria Asumpta, died after she ran aground and sank off the Camel
estuary, north Cornwall, yesterday.
The victim was named as Ms Ann Taylor, in her 50s, from Deal in Kent,
who was working aboard the ship as a cook and staff manager.
Two other members of the square rigger's 14 crew, a man and a woman,
are still missing despite a massive operation involving lifeboats,
helicopters and local fishing craft.
Coastguard Richard Day said there was a possibility they could have
survived, but he suspected that they had gone down with the ship.
The 125ft vessel broke up and sank in seas which pounded the rocks off
Pentire Point.
Eleven other crew were recovered. Six survivors were brought to the
top of the cliffs at Pentire by winch operated by coastguard teams and
five others were taken aboard a fishing vessel, the Helen Clare.
West Country Ambulance Service said the 11 survivors were taken to the
Royal Cornwall Hospital at Treliske, near Truro.
All the survivors, believed to be mostly young crew members aged over
18, were suffering from hypothermia.
They had no other injuries and their condition was not thought to be
serious, a spokesman said.
Mr Terry Johns, principal keeper at Trevose lighthouse, had been
watching the square rigged ship heading towards Padstow and planned to
video her.
He said the brig had been a ''magnificent sight'' as she passed
offshore with all sail set.
He added: ''I thought she would go outside the Newland Rocks but she
went inside close to the shore, too far in for a ship that size.''
Later he saw through binoculars that she had gone right over on her
side, then righted herself.
''Then she was gone. You wouldn't believe how fast she went. There
were still her foresails showing but the rest had gone.''
Eyewitness Steve Hudspith, 40, a member of Port Isaac lifeboat team,
watched the drama from the cliffs.
''She was closer in than I expected. The wind was from the north and
she had gone too far into Portquin Bay and was making very little
headway.
''It was inevitable she would end up on the rocks,'' he said.
The vessel was ''knocked one way then the other'' in the swell then
broke up in just a few minutes.
''There was just matchwood left,'' added Mr Hudspith.
The 137-year-old Spanish-built brig originally operated the
transatlantic trade routes, and was maintained by the historicial
society The Friends of Maria Asumpta, based in Kent.
Falmouth Coastguard reported the ship had struck at Pentire Point,
north Cornwall and sent a mayday call.
A rescue helicopter from the Royal Naval Air Station at Culdrose and
lifeboats from Padstow, Port Isaac and Rock attended the scene.
The Department of Transport said members of the Marine Accident
Investigation Bureau would begin an immediate investigation.

AN extraordinary general meeting, called yesterday by Rangers to seek
shareholders' approval for the long-term lease of the club's Albion car
park, attracted just 78 of almost 7000 shareholders entitled to attend.
The game ended after precisely 16 minutes with a clear victory for the
directors.
There had been some suggestions before the meeting in Govan Town Hall
that club chairman David Murray's involvement in the leasing deal could
cause unrest.
This would have mirrored the response of several shareholders, angered
when Rangers sold the former training ground in 1990 for just under #2m
to a subsidiary of Mr Murray's property group. The group has leased it
back to the club over the past five years.
In a complicated deal, Manchester-based NWS Property Investments
(NWSPI) Ltd now proposes to pay Mr Murray's company, PPG (Leisure) Ltd,
#3.9m for a 125-year lease of the former training ground.
In the event there were no dissenting voices at the meeting chaired by
the club's vice-chairman, Mr Donald Findlay, QC.
Mr Murray took no part in voting and was not present at the meeting
because of his ''onflict of interest''.
Only one person voted against the directors' recommendation.
The leasing deal will see NWSPI paying PPGL #3.9m for a 125-year lease
of the former training ground. NWSPI will then sub-lease the car park
back to Rangers, charging #250,000 a year for the first five years,
#330,000 from years six to 10, increasing by 4% a year until a 34-year
term is complete.
Thereafter, Rangers will pay a ''peppercorn rent'' of #3930 a year
until the 125-year lease is complete and the control of the car park
reverts to PPGL.
The club says the move is the only way to guarantee the future
operation of its #22m club deck stand,

BRITISH Gas has backed down from a threat to cut the pay and holidays
of showroom staff in the wake of a shareholders' revolt prompted by
chief executive Mr Cedric Brown's 75% wage rise.
As the company braced itself for a stormy annual general meeting in
London today, 2000 retail workers voted on a deal which protects their
salary and conditions.
The result will be announced next week, but union leaders expect a
huge vote in favour of the deal. Showroom staff were faced with a
threatened 15% cut in pay and a loss of six days' holiday.
The attempted cuts came amid the furore over Mr Brown's pay rise to
#492,000, which has led British Gas to decide not to proceed.
''It is a very good settlement and in a funny sort of way we have a
lot to thank Mr Brown for,'' said one union official.
''The only reason we have been able to reach this deal is because of
the enormous blunder over his pay. Any attempt now to cut rates of pay
in British Gas's other businesses will be very difficult for the
company. This could cost it millions of pounds.''
Fleets of buses from all over the UK left last night for the meeting
at the London Arena. The venue was switched because of the pressure from
the 7000 shareholders expected to attend.
Another major concession due to be announced today is a #2 quarterly
rebate for those who pay bills by cheque or cash. This is intended to
offset protests at the discount for largely better-off customers paying
by direct debit.
''It won't fool anybody,'' said Scottish National Party leader Mr Alex
Salmond, as two coaches left Edinburgh's Charlotte Square. ''There is no
discount for those in greatest need on pre-payment meters. The poorest
people in the country will be paying most for their gas.''
Mr Salmond criticised Edinburgh and London-based fund managers who are
backing Mr Brown or abstaining from the vote.
''It looks as if the boardroom bacon will be saved by institutional
investors, but there is no way this issue is going to go away. If any of
the pension companies consulted their policy holders, they would find
the same revulsion shared by the wider community against the behaviour
of British Gas.''
The shareholders' campaign challenges company bosses over their new
pay and perks package, under which executive directors could receive
shares worth up to 125% of basic pay.
It has been led with remarkable success by Professor Joe Lamb, 66, a
physiologist at St Andrews University. His resolution calls for a
monitoring committee of private shareholders, unions and the Gas
Consumers' Council.
Another resolution from the influential institutional advisors, PIRC,
(Pensions Investment Research Consultants) urges the directors to revise
their remuneration policy in line with standards of best practice.
Shadow consumer affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths accused British Gas
of misleading institutional shareholders over Mr Brown's pay rise. He
said confidential documents faxed anonymously to his office detail
British Gas's counter-offensive.
A letter marked ''highly confidential'' from Mr Peter Sanguinetti,
director of corporate affairs at British Gas, to institutional investors
said Mr Brown's pay packet is ''far from excessive'' and Mr Brown was
the right man to lead the company.

THE workforce at Hoover's Cambuslang plant have been caught in the ebb
and flow of the economic tide since the factory opened almost 50 years
ago.
But the company attracted most attention when it launched its
ill-fated free flights promotion in 1992.
The Cambuslang site was opened in 1947, originally making fractional
motors. The business developed and it concentrated on the production of
floor-cleaning equipment, mainly vacuum cleaners.
But by the early 1980s it was under threat of closure. It had run up
debts of #30m as old lines failed to sell and the workforce of almost
3000 began steadily dwindling.
Then, in 1985, Hoover was bought by the Chicago Pacific Corporation
for #375m. Within a year 90 redundancies had been announced from a
workforce of some 1600. Shortly after the job losses, the company bought
the Cambuslang plant for #3.3m in what it described as an illustration
of its commitment to Scotland.
This sequence of expansion followed by contraction was to develop as a
recurring theme over the coming years.
In October 1988 Maytag launched a takeover for Hoover, in what was
believed to be a #200m deal. Within months more job losses were
announced, followed by news of a #6m investment programme.
But hopes that the site would be secured for the long term were soon
shattered by the announcement that more than 300 jobs were to go. As had
happened on previous occasions this was soon followed by an injection of
capital, this time in the region of #15m.
In the 1990s, with high stock levels and sporadic lay-offs, Hoover was
blamed by Maytag bosses for 80% of its total losses
Then in August 1992 the controversial free flights promotion was
launched. Seven-day-working shifts were started at Cambuslang and 75
extra workers taken on to cope with increased demand.
But the scheme was to cost the company #50m to sort out problems
caused by the massive response. A total of 220,000 customers either flew
or were booked to do so during the promotion which ended in April 1992.
Many people had been unable to get tickets for the flights they wanted.
Once again the future of the Cambuslang factory was in doubt so, in a
bid to avert closure, it was decided in January 1993 that the production
of cylinder cleaners would be transferred there from Dijon in France. It
was claimed that the #12m investment would create 400 jobs in Scotland.
At the same time workers agreed to a pay cut and longer working week to
protect their jobs.
The uncertainty, which increased as the effects of the free flights
fiasco came home to roost, began to recede when the first machinery was
transferred that July. It emerged then that #1m of public money had
helped to keep Hoover in the country. French President Francois
Mitterrand described the deal as ''highway robbery'' because up to 200
jobs were lost to Scottish ''cheap labour''.
But the advantages of the rescue package filtered through to the
workforce when, in 1994, 800 workers at the plant were awarded a
generous 3% pay rise.
Meanwhile, the free flights' fiasco continued to dog Hoover. It was
understood that by last month there had been 80 court cases involving
customers dissatisfied with the offer.
On Tuesday an English judge quashed an application from Hoover to have
127 cases struck out before they came to court. Solicitors acting for
claimants say they now expect to obtain compensation of around #5000 for
every double-ticket client.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday pledged that his party in power
would stand up for Britain's interests in Europe.
But he also promised his government would play a constructive part in
the European debate, putting forward positive ideas to create a
''people's Europe''.
He attacked the Tories for ''drifting ever further away'' from Europe,
and claimed the ''centre of gravity'' in Labour Party opinion was moving
his way.
The Labour leader, who was addressing a gathering in Bonn of the
Friedrich-Ebert Stiftung, a German Social Democratic think-tank, said
that if next year's ''Maastricht II'' Intergovernmental Conference of
European Union nations continued into 1997, a Labour Government could
find itself negotiating the final stages.
''We will propose the reform to make the EU more accountable, more
efficient and more open,'' he said.
''But no-one should underestimate our determination to stand up for
British interests in the negotiations, just as the German Government
stands up for German interests.''
Apparently answering Tory claims that Labour would be a push-over in
Europe, Mr Blair said he would not surrender Britain's national veto in
areas like security, taxes, changing treaties, and border controls.
''We will maintain the veto vigorously in the key areas,'' he said.
However, Labour would consider extending non-unanimous decision making
-- so-called qualified majority voting -- where it suited Britain's
interests.
He set out six priorities for ''sensible people'' who supported the
EU, which were:
* To reach out to public opinion, not take it for granted.
* To help eastern European countries join the EU.
* Take on the agenda of reform.
* Make the EU more democratic and open.
* Build a stronger European foreign and defence policy in harmony with
Nato.
* Maintain and strengthen free trade.
''We want a new, people's Europe, enlarged, reformed, relevant, more
democratic, open to the rest of the world and with a robust foreign and
defence policy,'' he said.
''Britain can play a leading role in achieving those aims.''
Mr Blair said he backed the European ideal of co-operation between
nation states for the mutual benefit of all: ''I have no doubt at all
that the future of my country lies in being at the heart of Europe.
''At some risk, and under massive attack from the Conservative Party,
which drifts ever further away from Europe and a growing number of whose
members -- including former senior members of the Cabinet -- now
seriously contemplate withdrawal from the EU altogether, we will hold to
that position.
''It is right, and we shall use all our powers of persuasion to
convince our people of it.''
Acknowledging ''differences'' within the Labour Party, Mr Blair said:
''Some who opposed Britain's entry into Europe remain opposed. But the
centre of gravity in the Labour Party is moving convincingly in my
direction.''
Britain had much to contribute to Europe, said Mr Blair: ''Europe
would be a far poorer place without Britain as an active participant.''
One of a Labour Governent's first external acts would be to opt in to
the European Social Chapter, which sets out workers' rights, and from
which Britain excluded itself at the original Maastricht talks, he said.

SCOTRAIL cuts in Anglo-Scottish sleeper services, its closure of
Motorail -- and withdrawal of seated carriages on all overnight trains
-- were last night attacked by Labour as ''the economics of madness''.
Over the next two months, ScotRail will spend #250,000 promoting its
flagship Glasgow-Edinburgh ''shuttle'' services.
The money would save one sleeper, Motorail, and the seated
accommodation -- with change to spare, according to Labour's transport
spokesman Henry McLeish.
He argued the reduction in sleepers, from five to two, would see
passenger numbers crash by some 44%, from 315,000 to 177,900.
If even one sleeper was saved, an extra 81,800 people would be catered
for -- compared with ScotRail's best scenario of winning 5000 more
regulars in its Glasgow-Edinburgh campaign.
Mr McLeish said BR should now withdraw tomorrow's appeal in the Court
of Session against Lord Kirkwood's reprieve of the Fort William-London
sleeper pending public consultation procedures.
He accused BR and the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising of ''an
absolute scandal'' in the demise of three sleepers, Motorail, and seated
carriages.
Opraf's draft minimum Passenger Service Requirement for ScotRail,
imposed this week, shows:
* ScotRail will make #247,000-a-year by running two sleepers instead
of losing #3.9m when operating five. However, passenger totals will
slump by almost half, and income fall from #17.5m to #10.7m; and,
* although reintroducing a third sleeper would require a #226,000
Government subsidy to cover costs, more than 80,000 people would
benefit, and Motorail and seated carriages would survive.
The draft PSR also underlines the horrendous fixed costs ScotRail is
charged for access to track and rolling stock.
Fixed charges by Railtrack and train leasing companies for five
sleepers stand at #20.3m, but only fall to #17.3m when running two
sleepers. A third sleeper would cost another #1m, although income would
soar from #10.4m to #14m.
Mr McLeish said he had no problem with ScotRail promoting services.
However, he questioned the Glasgow-Edinburgh campaign -- which includes
gifts of mobile phones, rail tickets, and hotel breaks -- at a time of
cuts in the Scottish network.
Mr McLeish went on: ''The draft PSR figures are very revealing. They
show there is going to be a catastrophic collapse in numbers on
Anglo-Scottish sleepers.
''They also reveal Scots could have three sleepers -- plus Motorail
and overnight seats -- for less than the cost of this Glasgow-Edinburgh
marketing exercise. It just illustrates that the Government, Opraf, and
British Rail have got their priorities wrong.''
A spokesman for the Small Business Federation in Scotland said:
''Under-utilised lines should be promoted rather than flagship services
which, during rush hour, can involve standing room only.''
At the campaign launch, ScotRail director John Ellis insisted the
promotion had no relevance to concerns about the West Highland line's
future or the withdrawal of the Fort William-London sleeper. Six months
in planning, its timing was merely coincidental.
He also denied the promotion was connected with Opraf's removal of
subsidies to Glasgow-Edinburgh evening services. He was adamant the line
needs promoting, while its volume of business was ''far greater than
that which could ever be won for the West Highland line''.
Mr Ellis said he was trying to build on the half-hourly services'
outstanding success, with city-to-city travel in less than 50 minutes.
Clearly upset at questions about the West Highland line's future, he
added: ''I would have thought Scotland would welcome the promotion of
this very successful service . . . and I am confident it will encourage
more people to use it.''
ScotRail marketing manager said he needs to attract just three more
people on every off-peak train to recover the #250,000 campaign costs.
If 5000 were lured back, ScotRail would make several #100,000-a-year
which could go to develop services.
People who travel cheap-day return can receive a mobile phone after
five journeys; two return tickets to London after 10 trips, and a
weekend break for two at a Scottish Stakis hotel after 25 journeys.

A COUPLE of golf enthusiasts travelled across the Atlantic to be
married at St Andrews Golf Course yesterday.
Mr Eamon Rooney and Miss Linda Jackson were wed on the landscaped
garden roof of the new #3m St Andrews links' clubhouse.
Expatriate Mr Rooney, 34, emigrated to America with his parents when
he was three, although the family returned to live in Bothwell,
Lanarkshire, 10 years ago.
He met Miss Jackson, also 34, in Princeton, New Jersey, where he still
lives.
Two years ago they played over the Old Course at St Andrews together
and vowed to return.
Mr Rooney -- a 12-handicapper -- works for a computer company while
his wife, who plays off 22, is a human resources manager with a market
research firm.
The Rev William Henney, of Hope Park Church, conducted the service,
before which the couple played over the Old Course. St Andrews Links
Trust provided a bottle of champagne to toast the event.
The new clubhouse will be officially opened by Bernard Gallacher next
month.

A WOMAN needed psychiatric treatment and tried to cut her wrists after
a sex attack, the High Court in Edinburgh was told.
Yesterday there were cheers from the public gallery as her attacker,
Frank Sinclair, 43, was jailed for five years.
The 34-year-old woman was walking home in Edinburgh late at night on
September 25 last year when she was attacked by Sinclair. He grabbed her
from behind and tried to rip off her clothes, but her cries were heard
by passers-by and Sinclair ran off.
The woman said later: ''I thought he was going to murder me or rape
me.''
Sinclair, of Gilmerton Dykes Crescent, Edinburgh, was found guilty
after trial of assault with intent to rape.
Mr Garry Allan, defence counsel, told the court yesterday that the
attack was out of character. Sinclair, a first offender, looked after
his wife full-time, as she suffers from a chronic condition.
Mr Allan said his client could not remember much about the sex-attack
and wished to apologise for the distress he had caused.
Passing sentence, Lord Philip said that the assault had a serious
psychological effect on his victim and if Sinclair had not been
interrupted it was likely that a much more serious assault would have
taken place.
As Sinclair was led from the dock, his victim's relatives cheered and
shouted.

<TEXT>
ONE of the world's most important bridges, the Laigh Milton viaduct in
Ayrshire, is to be saved for the nation. Believed to be the oldest
surviving railway viaduct in existence, the massive structure crosses
the River Irvine on the edge of Kilmarnock.
The viaduct was in serious danger of collapse until the Laigh Milton
Viaduct Conservation Trust decided to take it over and launch a rescue
campaign.
The trust announced yesterday that it had amassed more than #1m in
funding, enough for the viaduct to be brought back to its former glory
and hopefully developed as part of an Ayrshire railway heritage trail.
It was built between 1808 and 1811 for the line carrying mainly coal
stocks between Troon and Kilmarnock, although there were also some
passenger services.
In about 1816, the line became famous for its steam locomotive,
introduced long before the Stockton and Darlington Railway, credited as
one of the first commercial railways in the world.
The Duke of Portland financed a steam loco known as ''The Duke'' to
use the line, but its weight was found to be too much for the iron
track, which started to crack and break up. It meant having to revert to
a horse-drawn train, which operated until 1846.

A COMPUTER system which puts vital information before a doctor in
hours rather than days has been unveiled at Ayr Hospital.
Among the first patients to benefit from the new system was
five-year-old Alister Dalgleish, from Maybole, who was admitted when his
local GP became concerned about continuing stomach pains.
Doctors and nursing staff can access the computer, which contains
patient details and information on X-ray and other important tests.
Dr Ian Ruthven, the consultant paediatrician who treated Alister,
said: ''In the past I would have had to wait quite a while while tests
were carried out, written up and then sent back to me.
''In Alister's case, the consultant radiologist was able to enter his
findings in the system and I was able to see it in front of me while I
continued my examination.Alister, from Drumullan Farm, has a small
stomach ulcer and within hours of going to hospital was back home

Dublin
THE tightest security operation ever mounted in the Irish Republic has
been ordered by the Dublin Government for today's arrival of Prince
Charles after the discovery yesterday of firebombs in the capital and in
the west of Ireland.
The Prince will be making the first public visit by a member of the
royal family since the partition of Ireland more than 70 years ago.
The first firebomb find was at Mullaghmore, County Sligo, at the
former holiday estate of the Prince's great-uncle, Earl Louis
Mountbatten, who was murdered there by the IRA in 1979.
Police confirmed that two devices were found in oil barrels but were
made safe.
Yesterday afternoon a small, crude incendiary device exploded at
2.15pm in Eason's book store in Dublin's O'Connell Street causing minor
damage.
Both incidents caused immediate alarm in advance of Prince Charles's
visit today.
Extra measures were being put into force following emergency
consultations between Government Ministers and security chiefs.
Prince Charles will arrive at Baldonnel Airport in mid-afternoon and
will be flown to the residence of the British Ambassador to Ireland,
where he is to attend a garden party.The Prince will also be the guest
of honour at a banquet in Dublin Castle.
Last night senior sources in the Irish Government told The Herald they
believe the bombs were planted as symbolic gestures against the British
crown by rogue elements in the Irish Republican movement.
But one military expert indicated the two incidents bore the hallmarks
of hardline Republicans.
Organised protests have been arranged against the visit , which is
being seen in diplomatic circles in both London and Dublin as a trial
run for a full State visit by the Queen.

THE American owner of Hoover yesterday cut its losses after the
free-flights fiasco and announced the sale of its entire European
operation for only #106m to Italian firm, Candy.
Senior officials of the parent company, Maytag, strenuously denied the
failed promotion had forced a ''fire sale'', but the low price suggested
it was eager to shed Hoover Europe.
It was unclear last night whether Candy would inherit full liability
for Hoover's complex legacy of legal action from disgruntled consumers.
Sources hinted Maytag would retain responsibility for compensation
payments, which could yet run into hundreds of millions of pounds.
The sale may also have important implications for Hoover's plant at
Cambuslang, which employs more than 1000. Candy said it intended to
develop the facility, currently making floor-care products, but declined
to expand on its plans.
Until it does, the workforce will again face an uncertain future at
the hands of an international conglomerate, only two years after it was
proposed the operation could close, with production transferred to
France.
That move was later reversed, with the Hoover factory in Dijon being
closed when the Glasgow Development Agency put together a #1m package of
public money to secure Cambuslang's future.
Labour's industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said last night: ''On
the surface, this appears to be positive news and the reference to
development at Cambuslang is welcome. However, the workforce will be
anxious to firm that up as soon as possible.
''It does sound as if Maytag had taken a decision to get out, and were
prepared to pay a price just to put Europe behind them.''
District secretary of the AEEU union, Mr Bill Tynan, gave a cautious
welcome to the announcement, adding: ''We will be meeting with the
company as early as possible to see how this will affect the workforce
and the people of Cambuslang.
''As far as we are concerned, if they are going to develop the site,
then it's good news. But at present we don't know the details of what is
going to happen.''
Mr Tynan played down fears that Candy might want to move away from
production of floor-care appliances. He said the Lanarkshire site was
efficient and profitable and a useful acquisition for any firm.
He said the free-flights offer must have had some bearing on the
takeover. He described it as a disaster for Hoover, and added: ''The
amount of money they had to pay out must have had an effect on sales and
investment, which may have impacted on the wages and conditions of my
members and the future of the company.''
Glasgow district councillor Bobby Rooney, who represents the
Cambuslang ward, said: ''I hope, for the sake of the workforce and
Cambuslang, they will carry on with production. I'm happy that they have
given assurances and hopefully those promises will reflect what they do
in the future.''
Yesterday's sale includes Hoover's production facilities in Scotland,
Wales, and Portugal, its headquarters at Merthyr Tydfil, its service and
sales organisation, and the rights to the Hoover trademark in Europe,
parts of the Middle East, and North Africa. A total of 3000 staff are
affected.
Candy has one factory in Cheshire. Its president, Mr Peppino
Fumagalli, said of the acquisition: ''We believe this will offer
opportunities to develop further the Hoover brand and will therefore
enhance the prospects of Hoover Europe and its employees.''
Asked about liability for the flights promotion, a spokesman for Candy
said: ''It is reasonable to suppose that formed part of the
negotiations, but we cannot comment further at this stage. A full
statement is expected within the next few weeks.''
The family-owned concern already had 4000 employees, making washing
machines, refrigerators, and cookers under a variety of brands in Italy,
Spain, France, and the UK -- where they are marketed under the
Kelvinator name, as well as the Candy line.
Maytag's chairman, Mr Leonard Hadley, said the sale was the result of
a strategic business decision.

NEIGHBOURS from hell are to be targeted by a new independent project.
The Edinburgh Community Mediation Project, the first of its kind in
Scotland, encourages warring neighbours to talk about their gripes to a
trained counsellor, who will try to help them reach a peaceful
conclusion.
The ''love thy neighbour'' approach has been backed by Edinburgh
District Council, which believes it could lead to a dramatic drop in the
number of complaints to its housing department and cut the amount of
police time wasted in dealing with such incidents.
Housing officer, Ms Diane Janes, said: ''We deal with about 350
complaints each month. The bulk of those, about 85 to 90% of them, fall
into the sort of categories that we could refer to the mediation
service.
''The people involved come to an agreement themselves. It is not
something that we are imposing on them. The most common complaints
relate to noise, children's behaviour, boundary disputes, and pet
control.
''Visiting the mediation project may well be the first time both sides
have spoken about the problem and tried to reach an understanding.''
Complainants can approach the project themselves or be referred by
police or council officials, but Ms Janes stressed the scheme worked on
a voluntary basis.
She claimed it would not work if people were pushed into solutions.
The project also aims to nip in the bud anti-social behaviour to
prevent it escalating into the nightmare suffered by neighbours of
families such as the Grahams of Glenrothes, or the Haneys from Stirling.
''The mediation service is designed to operate at a local, more
low-key level,'' said Ms Janes. ''It's aimed at resolving neighbourhood
disputes.
''The district council already has a firm policy on anti-social
behaviour. It always takes firm action against those threatening
violence.''
Council funding and government urban aid funding has helped meet the
#100,000 costs of setting up the scheme, which employs two full-time
members and a part-time worker, backed by a team of volunteers at their
offices in York Place, Edinburgh.
It will be officially launched tomorrow, but has been running on a
pilot basis since April.
Plans for a similar initiative in Dundee are also under way.
Superintendent Ian Fowler, of the community services department of
Lothian and Borders Police said yesterday that the scheme could save
officers valuable time and resources.
''It will resolve some of our minor problems,'' he commented. ''The
last thing we want is for officers to go back to complainers time and
time again and say I'm sorry there's nothing we can do about it.
''We can either report it to the courts or we can't do anything at
all.''
Meanwhile, the neighbours who a sheriff said have been subjected to
misery by Stirling's ''family from hell'' are holding a meeting tonight
to discuss how to clean up the Raploch area where the Haney family
lives.
Members of the Gowanhill Gardens Tenants Association, which covers the
top half of the street where 17-stone mother of 13, Mrs Margaret ''Big
Mags'' Haney, and some of her children stay, have invited police to
their meeting.
The residents want officers to help them set up a Neighbourhood Watch
scheme to keep crime in check.
The association spokesman, Mr John Lowe, said anyone could bring up
anything they liked at the meeting, but the Haneys would certainly be
discussed.
Seven out of ten residents in the streets involved will have to vote
for a Neighbourhood Watch scheme before police will agree to set one up.
Last week, Mrs Haney said Sheriff Norrie Stein had labelled her
offspring a ''family from hell'' after he drew attention to their
appalling record.
Seven of Mrs Haney's eight surviving children have served time behind
bars. Five of her children have died.
Between them, the surviving seven, whose ages range from 20 to 29,
have made hundreds of court appearances for offences including
housebreaking, shoplifting, assault, breach of the peace, possession of
drugs, and mobbing and rioting.

THE Prime Minister is on a collision course with a group of senior
Tories who want the British soldiers out of Bosnia.
In a crisis news conference at Downing Street yesterday, Mr Major made
clear he wants to strengthen the UN presence, not withdraw it.
He will now face strong pressure from a section of Conservative MPs in
today's emergency Commons debate to withdraw British troops from the UN
peacekeeping mission as soon as practicable.
One warned him: ''It is no good trying to get our hostages out and
then leaving other British troops in an equally vulnerable position.''
The next few days and weeks could be critical for his own standing as
well as for the future of former Yugoslavia, where Mr Major said he
could foresee a wider, even bloodier Balkan war if the UN were forced
out.
He declared that he planned to do ''everything in my power'' to free
unharmed the British troops now being held hostage by the Serbs.
He has sent a direct message to Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic and his military commander General Ratko Mladic, warning them
he would hold them ''personally responsible'' for the men's safety. Mr
Major refused to expand on what that implied though an attempt by
Britain to have them tried as war criminals if the hostages come to harm
seems an option.
He was supported by Nato Foreign Ministers who issued a damning
statement following a meeting in Holland, condemning the ''outrageous
behaviour'' of the Bosnian Serbs in shelling safe areas and killing and
seizing peacekeepers.
They demanded the unconditional release of the UN observers held
hostage, including 33 Britons. And they warned: ''We hold the Bosnian
Serb leaders fully accountable for their safe return.''
Mr Major called the hostage taking ''an outrage'' and warned the
Bosnian Serbs that if they persisted they would face international
isolation and ''permanent pariah status''.
Last night the first of 6500 troops arrived in Bosnia. A 36-man
reconnaissance unit of the 19 Field Regiment, the Highland Gunners,
reached the British UN base at Gornji Vakuf.
Meanwhile intense diplomatic efforts were directed at persuading other
countries to follow Britain's lead in building up the UN contingent to
more of a fighting force than monitoring one. The initial response is
not thought to be encouraging.
The Opposition will offer its support in today's debate. In a speech
yesterday Mr Tony Blair said the international community should not
allow peacekeepers to be ''chased out'' by terrorists. It was, he said,
one of the first big tests of post Cold War international solidarity
''and we must not fail it.''
Speaking in Bonn, he said the Bosnian Serbs must be made to understand
the ''international outrage'' at this act of terrorism.
He echoed Mr Major by warning that if the hostages were harmed, ''we
will hold the Bosnian Serb leaders personally responsible. The use of
hostages as human shields is a breach of the Geneva Conventions and
there must be no sanctuary for those who commit such a crime against
international law.''
Mr Blair said he fully supported the actions of the Government in
sending more troops to Bosnia to protect forces already there.
One dissident voice within the Labour ranks today could be Mr Tam
Dalyell. He is determined to voice his concerns in the Commons about
open-ended military involvement in Bosnia even if that means going
against his party leadership.
However, Mr Major faces even stronger opposition from within his own
party ranks. Senior Tories were making clear their view that the time
had come to end the embattled UN presence.
Sir George Gardiner, MP for Reigate and vice-chairman of the party's
foreign affairs committee, said he strongly supported the sending of
reinforcements for the British forces ''as a prelude to securing their
safe withdrawal''.
He added: ''No British interest is served by committing our forces as
active participants in their civil war and they should be brought home a
soon as is safely possible.''
Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said: ''It is no good trying to
get our hostages out and then leaving other British troops in an equally
vulnerable position. The role of the Government is to protect British
interests and there are no interests for us in this situation.''
Mr Warren Hawkesley, MP for Halesowen and Stourbridge, said: ''We have
got to be prepared if the worst happens to withdraw and we are very
close to the worst happening.'' Mr Harry Greenway, Ealing North MP,
said: ''Our role is largely exhausted.''
This is not the Prime Minister's view. Clearly worried about the
consequences of the UN opting out he told his news conference: ''The
prevention of a full scale Balkan war is very much a strategic interest
for those of us in the West.''
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the all-party Commons defence
committee, said he shared the Prime Minister's view.
He suggested that UN troops be consolidated in one area so they were
not left in vulnerable positions after which the position should be
reviewed ''to see if we can usefully stay''.
However, even Mr Major admitted that if the combatants in Bosnia
''abused the neutrality, impartiality and humanitarian purposes of the
United Nations then we and other contributors may find ourselves in the
position where there is no viable choice but to bring the protection
forces home''.
That would leave the people in the region facing a future ''ruled even
more by violence and insecurity than they have faced in the last couple
of years''.
All the political parties are well aware that there appears to be a
strong public opinion in Britain for withdrawal which could grow if the
relief force takes casualties as it seeks to join up with the units in
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE>Parents to blame for classroom tearaways</HEADLINE>

HEAD teachers' leaders yesterday blamed irresponsible parents for
creating a new generation of classroom tearaways.
At the opening of its conference in Harrogate, the National
Association of Head Teachers said aggressive, disruptive, and
anti-social behaviour in the classroom was on the increase.
Its general secretary, Mr David Hart, also accused the Government of
''pandering to parent power and fighting shy of pressing home the
message of parental responsibility''.
He added: ''The Government spends 90% of its time talking about
parental rights, it says barely anything about parental
responsibilities.''
Schools were being stripped of their disciplinary powers, but nothing
was being done to encourage parents to instill good behaviour.
Exclusions of children from school had tripled in the past three
years, and could now top 10,000 a year.
''It is quite unreasonable to expect schools to do everything to
provide the firm discipline and firm environment which children need to
flourish,'' Mr Hart said.
Doncaster headteacher Liz Paver called for more efforts to educate
youngsters in ''good parenting''.
''We find children coming to school who have not learned how to play
or co-operate with other people,'' she said.
Some children starting nursery school appeared to understand nothing
but violence. They swore and kicked other children, and used
''inappropriate language''.
These children, said Mrs Paver, head of Intake First School,
Doncaster, had been robbed of their childhood.
Also yesterday, a report claims the vast majority of violent and
murderous children have suffered abuse or loss.
It examined the backgrounds of 200 of 781 section 53 offenders --
children aged between 10 and 17 who have committed violent crimes -- and
found overwhelming evidence that they were victims themselves.
The report's author, Dr Gwyneth Boswell, of East Anglia University's
school of social work, said: ''The fact that children and young people
can be dangerously violent, and murderous, is an unwelcome and
unpalatable truth for those living in a society which contains this
phenomenon.
''Nowhere has this been more fully highlighted in recent times than in
the publicity surrounding the tragic death of two-year-old James Bulger
at the hands of two 10-year-old children in February, 1993.''
Dr Boswell said that in the Bulger case, one of the killers had been
systematically bullied by his brothers.
Meanwhile, in Scotland, children are leaving school with much better
qualifications than their predecessors, according to statistics provided
by the Scottish Office.
Last year, less than one in ten pupils left with no SCE
qualifications, compared to one in four a decade ago. Similarly, 44% of
current leavers had at least one higher, compared to 33% in 1984.

<HEADLINE>Innovative non-stick splint offers hope of mobility to paralysed</HEADLINE>

TWO professors brought together by a shared interest in gardening have
developed a ''grow-your-own'' device to replace body tissue lost through
injury.
They hope their non-stick splint -- a tiny template inserted under the
skin -- will enable severed hand tendons to heal without loss of
function, and may one day help the paralysed to walk.
The two scientists -- electronics engineer Chris Wilkinson and cell
biologist Adam Curtis -- devised the new skill of bioelectronics while
talking shop at their neighbouring allotments.
Back at Glasgow University, they have applied the techniques of
nanofabrication -- used to created tiny structures for use in
electronics -- to create a bio-compatible splint which will encourage
cells to grow in the right shape.
The splint is a template lined with grooves one-hundredth of a
millimetre wide, to guide the growth of the cells.
They are now working with Mr James Crossan, a consultant orthopaedic
surgeon based at the Western Infirmary, and medical equipment
manufacturers Ethicon, to develop the templates in a biodegradable
material with a non-stick lining.
Professor Curtis explained yesterday: ''The ideal template for tissue
repair is one which dissolves as the tissue grows, and there are a
number of polymers we can use which do that.
''In the case of a tendon injury to the hand, of the type which might
occur through an industrial accident, adhesions often form after
surgery, leaving the affected area frozen. We have incorporated a
non-stick surface to prevent this happening.''
Laboratory tests have proven the technique can work, and the team look
forward to trying it on their first human patient.
Other possible uses include biodegradable synthetic blood vessels,
which would grow human endothelial cells inside and dissolve, as the
cells built up in its place. This would prevent the long-term risk of
clotting, which is one of the problems in blood vessel replacement.
Further down the road are prosthetics that will promote the growth of
nerve cells. That is the goal that could help victims of spinal injuries
to walk again.
In the meantime, they have developed minuscule bugging devices which
can eavesdrop on the messages being sent by cells through the nervous
system, providing information about how cells work and new ideas which
could be incorporated into the design of silicon chips.

A SACKED hospital consultant, condemned by management as being too
rude, last night spoke of her three-year battle against her dismissal.
Earlier the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust ''unconditionally
withdrew'' all allegations against haematologist Dr Helena Daly, 43.
She had been suspended in 1992 by Mr John Saxby, then trust chief
executive, with whom she claimed she was having an affair.
She was dismissed when the trust upheld allegations of personal
misconduct after a closed hearing involving over 50 witnesses.
Mr Saxby, 47, now chief executive of Darlington Hospitals Trust, later
claimed he made the wrong decision.
The trust yesterday dropped all 23 allegations of personal misconduct:
a statement said it admitted certain evidence given against Dr Daly at
the internal hearing ''now appears unreliable'', making her dismissal
unfair.
Dr Daly will not get her job back, but the trust will give her
''helpful references''

KIDNEY dialysis patients at Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow have been
quarantined after one of them was found to have hepatitis B.
The precaution means the 83 patients will not be able to use any other
dialysis centre for the next six months.
''A few people have had to cancel their holidays as a result,''
consultant Dr Brian Junor said yesterday. ''It is a great shame but we
have no choice.''
The hepatitis patient, who is believed to have picked up the
potentially lethal virus abroad, is now being dialysed in isolation and
the other patients have received prophylactic injections.
''The risk of any of the other patients or staff being infected is
extremely small,'' Dr Junor added.
Not only will the Gartnavel patients be unable to go for holiday
dialysis at other units, but in addition patients from elsewhere who
would normally have come to Gartnavel will be redirected to other units
in the city.

MAN-MADE chemicals widely used in making paper and plastics are
causing infertility and birth defects, according to a report published
today by the environmental organisation, Greenpeace.
The chemicals, organochlorines, which are used widely in PVC plastics,
solvents, and pulp and paper production, are also altering levels of sex
hormones, the report, Body of Evidence -- the Effects of Chlorine on
Human Health, claims.
Greenpeace is calling upon Ministers meeting at the North Sea
Conference in Denmark on June 8 and 9 to eliminate organochlorines from
the marine environment.
''If urgent action is not taken to ban organochlorines we are not only
threatening the environment but risking the very future of the human
race,'' said Greenpeace campaigner Madeleine Cobbing,
''At the North Sea Conference, Ministers have to make a choice between
the future of our children's health and our ability to reproduce, or the
right of companies to use our seas as their own dumping grounds,'' she
added.
Greenpeace claims there is overwhelming evidence that organochlorines
are a major factor in the following problem areas:
* Exposure to organochlorines during pregnancy can cause foetal death
and spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, effects on intelligence, and
behavioural problems.
* Two recent European studies have shown a sperm count fall of 2% a
year over the past 20 years.
* The incidence of testicular cancer has increased over the last 50
years on a worldwide scale.
* Women's reproductive problems have increased dramatically over the
past 50 years in industrialised countries.

A TEAM of SAS soldiers who shot dead eight IRA men in Northern Ireland
have refused to give evidence at an inquest into the deaths, it was
confirmed yesterday.
At the opening of a hearing in Craigavon, County Armagh, coroner Henry
Rodgers said there would be evidence from civilians, police officers,
forensic scientists, pathologists, and relatives of the men.
He said the soldiers had been notified about the inquest but had
''signified their intention not to be present''.
The eight IRA men were shot dead in an undercover operation in May
1987, seconds after Loughgall RUC station was attacked by a
heavily-armed gang.
In Northern Ireland inquest juries do not make verdicts on the
circumstances of deaths but are asked to determine who the victims were
and where, when, and how they died.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang last night pleaded for Tory party members
to come up with some ideas to help the party out of its present
difficulties.
There was, however, no suggestion from Mr Lang that he would entertain
any thoughts of the Conservatives reconsidering constitutional
devolution.
While he conceded that the loss of the Perth and Kinross by-election
was a ''disappointing setback'', he stressed it was a setback that had a
UK context rather than a specifically Scottish one.
At a Conservative Party meeting in Inverness, he emphasised that
opinion polls had not identified constitutional devolution as an issue
in the by-election. ''So it would be wrong to assume that if we were to
abandon our principled stand on that issue, our political problems would
melt away. They would not,'' he said.
He warned worried Tory supporters that they should not let proper
concern about reviving the party's fortunes lead them to rapid remedies
for a ''mis-diagnosed condition''. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State
said he was keen to get a number of new initiatives under way which
would set the party on the recovery path.
Mr Lang did not detail what the new initiatives would be. Instead, he
said he would be keen to consider any thoughts or ideas that emerged
from the widespread consultative process on future policy developments
which the Prime Minister has ordered throughout the party.
''We made it clear when we announced a raft of constitutional changes
two years ago that it was part of our continuing purpose to look at
further opportunities, as part of an evolving and ongoing process, to
give greater prominence to Scottish interests in Parliament and to
stress the distinctively Scottish nature of our approach to many policy
issues.
''That is already happening, and we shall see whether more can be
done. But we shall do so against the background of a firm commitment to
maintaining the Union and taking no steps that would undermine
Scotland's place as a full and equal partner in the United Kingdom.''
He was speaking as a growing, if still small, demand within the
Scottish Conservative Party to reconsider backing some form of
devolution appears to be emerging.
Mr Lang's deliberate use of the phrase ''constitutional devolution''
as something he does not support, suggests that he will consider
anything which devolves decision-making to Scotland without tinkering
with the constitution.
In a sense he and the Prime Minister have already started that process
with the Scottish Grand Committee meeting in Scotland. But with a large
amount of administrative devolution already conceded to the Scottish
Office, his difficulty is finding new measures which would give the
appearance of giving Scots a larger say in their own affairs without
touching the constitution.
Mr Lang already argues that the introduction of school boards, local
enterprise companies, hospital trusts, local government reorganisation
and so on, are forms of devolving decision-making to a more local level.
Unfortunately for his party, the voters do not appear to share his
enthusiasm, and he will be keen to see any measures which would somehow
enthuse his party's natural voters who are slipping away.
* In the latest State of the Nation poll, the devolution issue was
also raised.
There was a 50% backing in Scotland for a devolved parliament, but
eight out of 10 Scots said they were in favour of a referendum on the
issue.
It also revealed that Britons are becoming increasingly disillusioned
with politicians and the way we are governed.
After the rows over political sleaze, the report discovered that only
one in five people had any confidence in Parliament. Following on the
Nolan Report, which was critical of MPs' outside interests and political
funding, the poll records that a resounding 75% of those surveyed wanted
political parties to divulge the identities of major cash donors.
Three quarters of people now believe the whole political system could
be improved, compared to just over half two decades ago.
Nearly four out of five believed there should be a referendum on major
political issues such as Europe.
The report commissioned and published by the electoral reform charity,
The Joseph Rowntree Trust, talked to more than 2500 people across
Britain to find their attitudes to Government in the 90s.

ARMED police sealed off a major route into Glasgow at rush hour
yesterday after reports that a man had been seen with a firearm.
The incident began around 8.30am when a routine police patrol was
alerted by local people in the Saracen area that others had given chase
to a man allegedly seen with a gun.
The police took up the chase, following the man into a tenement in
Balmore Road, Possilpark, which turned out to be the man's family home.
Reinforcements were called, including armed officers, although no
weapon had been obvious.
The main Balmore Road artery was sealed off by police vehicles and
city-bound rush-hour traffic diverted either up Bilsland Drive or across
towards Springburn Road. Large crowds of local people gathered behind
the barriers to watch the drama unfold.
Within an hour, a man emerged with his hands in the air in response to
negotiators.
Hundreds of onlookers watched as he crossed the street in the
direction of an officer armed with a Heckler and Koch carbine and, again
under direction, lay down in the roadway.
A second officer, armed with a handgun, handcuffed the man behind his
back and he was led away.
Other members of the same family eventually emerged from the house,
including a sister and brother of the first man and also the father of
the family. When it was learned that he had had a heart by-pass
operation he was taken to hospital as a precaution.
The armed containment continued well into the afternoon while the
house and others in the tenement were thoroughly searched. No gun was
found but a quantity of other material was recovered.
Police said last night that a 19-year-old man was in custody in
connection with the incident

A HEALTH board's decision to give a major contract for the care of
psycho-geriatric patients to a private company has been attacked by the
leader of a local NHS Trust.
Mrs Aileen Bates, chair of the Ayrshire and Arran Community Health
Care Trust, disclosed that she had tried on many occasions for leave to
bid for the #1.6m contract.
She was speaking after it emerged that Irvine Care was the sole bidder
for the contract signed with Ayrshire and Arran Health Board last week.
The successful bidder is owned by a US company which has made millions
of dollars from health care and is growing in the UK.
The local MP, councillors and trade union leaders have united to
condemn the deal which covers a 15-year period initially caring for 90
mentally ill and elderly patients from hospitals throughout Ayrshire.
Mrs Bates said: ''We have tried on a number of occasions since coming
into being in April 1993 to persuade the health board to allow us to bid
for this care facility to replace the ageing Ravenspark Hospital at
Irvine and also care for patients from Ailsa and Ballochmyle hospitals.
''Each time we have been turned down with only the explanation that
the decision has been taken to deal with a private company specialising
in this kind of care.''
She added: ''Quite frankly there is no better specialist organisation
with staff, resources and experience than this trust.
''Not only do we have these assets but we have the backing of other
trusts who share ideas and expertise and provide other services.
''I am angry and disappointed that this contract has been signed and I
am not convinced that the level of care required in this complex and
specialised field can be properly provided by a company whose sole
motive is profit and who must satisfy its shareholders.''
Mrs Bates said the trust would have had no difficulty in raising
finance for the provision of a care facility which would not have been
on the proposed Ayrshire Central Hospital site but in the nearby
three-towns area of Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston.
She said: ''We would have combined this centre with day care and other
medical facilities which are much-needed in the area and are confident
that the package would have been of benefit to the people of Ayrshire.''
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, who campaigned against the
Irvine Care deal, said: ''I am appalled that NHS trusts were debarred
from bidding for this contract. It is not hard to detect the hand of the
Scottish Office steering its pet privateers from Ayrshire and Arran
Health Board further down the road to a private health service.
''This shabby deal with a company owned by one of the most successful
and aggressive American health care companies is another nail in the
coffin of the NHS.
''Some people have said that this company has a toehold in the NHS by
providing care of this kind.
''I feel it is more like a stranglehold as they have huge assets
behind them which will always allow them to outbid or undercut rival
bidders.''
Mr Donohoe wants the Irvine Care deal debated in the House of Commons
as part of a wider look at the privatisation of the NHS.
The contract has been described as ''good for the patients and those
who care for them'' by the health board chairman Mr Jim Donaldson. He
said: ''I believe we have got the best deal possible in this important
area of health care.''

THE husband of Director of Public Prosecutions Barbara Mills has been
stabbed by teenage muggers near the couple's London home.
Mrs Mills was last night said to be at the bedside of her wounded
husband John, 56.
Police said he was attacked by youths as he left his car in Albert
Street, Camden Town, north London, to walk to his home on Tuesday night.
He was stabbed in the stomach and robbed of his wallet.
The gang, wearing scarves and baseball caps, fled. Mr Mills managed to
stagger to his home where Mrs Mills called an ambulance. He was said to
be ''conscious and in a stable condition'' in the Royal Free Hospital,
north London.
Police, called to the scene by a witness who saw the attack, found the
wallet and the knife believed to have been used in the attack.
Eight youths were arrested nearby, and were being held in various
north London police stations, Scotland Yard said.
The couple married in 1962 and have four children.

WORKERS at the profitable Rolls-Royce aero-engine design division at
East Kilbride yesterday reluctantly abandoned their fight to save the
plant in return for guarantees on jobs and better redundancy terms.
It is planned that about 180 of the 600 jobs at the plant will be
transferred to Derby and Bristol; 70 will be transferred from the
company's research and development facility at East Kilbride to its
adjacent engine repairs and overhauls operation; 20-30 will go to
partner companies in Germany with the same number to partner companies
in the US.
Of the remaining workers about 80 are lined up to accept voluntary
redundancy packages which are claimed to have been increased by 30-50%
on an original offer tabled by management. Almost 150 workers have been
guaranteed work at the plant until the end of this year. Others have
already accepted redundancy packages.
The proposals, reluctantly accepted at a mass meeting of workers at
the East Kilbride plant yesterday, came after a four-month high-profile
campaign to save the plant. Most of those affected are highly-skilled
engineers, designers and technicians.
The campaign, which was taken south to Rolls-Royce plants and to
Europe, resulted in workers at Derby and Bristol refusing to handle work
transferred from East Kilbride because of an ongoing overtime ban and
rolling programme of strikes.
The move to axe the research and development facility at East Kilbride
and transfer work to Derby and Bristol, first revealed in The Herald in
January, came after company executives unveiled plans to rationalise
Rolls-Royce's entire aero-engine design capability.
The engine design division at East Kilbride was recognised as one of
Scotland's major engineering research, development and design centres of
excellence. News of its threatened closure incited criticism from across
the political spectrum and resulted in massive public support for the
campaign.
A spokesman for the company said he was glad the dispute was over but
declined to comment on details of the package agreed by the unions.
The reaction of workers leaving the plant after the mass meeting
yesterday was mainly one of despondency.
Draughtsman Martin Naismith, 29, who has been with the company for 12
years, said: ''I am disgusted. It is ridiculous that company chairman
Sir Ralph Robins should be calling the East Kilbride operation parochial
when we have had regular business dealings with Japan and America and
have just clinched a deal with BMW in Berlin.''
The Scottish TUC and local Labour MP Adam Ingram, while congratulating
the workforce on its magnificent fight to save jobs, warned of the
consequences of the closure.
STUC deputy general secretary Bill Speirs said: ''The workers have
been badly let down by Scottish Office Ministers.''
Mr Ingram said: ''There can be no doubt that the loss of this facility
in East Kilbride will be bad not just for the town, not just for
Lanarkshire, but for the whole of the Scottish economy. It is bound to
have a seriously damaging effect on the future of the aerospace industry
in Scotland.''
Mr Owen Thomas, chairman of the joint staff unions' committee, said
the workforce had reluctantly accepted the research and design facility
at East Kilbride would close.
Mr Thomas said about 300 of the 600 jobs would be transferred within
the Rolls-Royce operation in Scotland, England, Europe, and the US. A
number of people had also already accepted voluntary redundancy
packages.
''That means we will be looking at more than 400 people on site
leaving on their own terms and not on the company's terms.''
He admitted there had been a few dissenting voices but claimed the
motion to accept the proposals was ''carried overwhelmingly''.
He remained confident about the long-term future of the company's
engine overhaul and repair business at East Kilbride, which employs 800,
and believed the success of the workers' campaign could have some
bearing on a possible expansion in the operation.

SIX pigs had to be destroyed at a piggery owned by Scotland's major
pig breeder after a raid by animal cruelty officials and a Government
vet, a court was told yesterday.
Three ''paraplegic'' pigs were found unable to stand and another pig's
leg was ''grotesquely swollen with multiple abcesses''.
Nearby, a young pig was discovered with ''open sores'' on one of its
legs.
Piggery firm Arthur Simmers Ltd, of Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, is on
trial facing three charges of causing unnecessary suffering to animals
by failing to provide and administer veterinary treatment at its Muir of
Pert Piggery, Tealing, near Dundee, after officials raided the farm on
three separate occasions last year.
The company is owned by Mr Arthur Simmers, former chairman of the
Scottish Pig Association and owner of a quarter of all sows in Scotland.
Chief Inspector Harry Nicholson, of the Scottish Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, described the first raid on the
piggery on February 24 last year.
Mr Nicholson and three colleagues were accompanied on the raid by a vet
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
Mr Nicholson told Dundee Sheriff Court that they were met by
''delaying tactics'' when they first went to the piggery. It was an hour
and a half later before they were allowed in.
The SSPCA official claimed that a young pig was found with ''open
sores on the right foreleg and the joint'' and that its ''foot buckled
under it''.
He said the animal was ''crying out in pain'' when it was lifted and
added: ''Pigs will squeal, this was more of a shriek.''
Mr Nicholson said that there were ''three paraplegic pigs'' at the
piggery. One of them, which was lying down, had a ''grossly swollen left
hind leg''.
Another pig was discovered in ''an absolute comatose state'' and had
to be dragged into a passage to be examined.
He added that a sow was ''suffering from a prolapse of the rectum''
which was ''so obvious to see''.
Mr Nicholson said that on a subsequent visit on March 3 last year, two
sows were tethered ''so tight'' that there was ''no movement'' and that
both animals had lesions on their necks.
On a further occasion on August 4, the SSPCA officer said that a boar
had been found with a ''suspected broken leg'', a lame sow was
''hobbling'' and another sow was lying down in a pen with a lame front
leg and a lame rear leg.
Mr Nicholson said there was also a sow with a growth or abcess on its
hip and another with an inflamed area on its right hind foot.
He also told the court that four sows that were tethered had lesions
on their necks.
Arthur Simmers Ltd also denies that between February 20 and 24 last
year it left pig carcasses to remain unburied in a place where dogs
could get access.
The trial, before Sheriff Alexander Eccles, continues.
