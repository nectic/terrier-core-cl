* FUSION is first on the jazz menu at the Glasgow International Jazz
Festival today, as The Jazz Crusaders take the stage at the McEwan's Old
Fruitmarket at 7.30pm (see above). This all-American band is followed
up, at 10pm at the City Cafe Bar (surely a venue that should be utilised
more throughout the year, by small chamber jazz groups?), by Scotland's
finest, and busiest, jazz pianist Brian Kellock, who has recently
returned from his second European tour with the Australian
multi-instrumentalist James Morrison. Kellock will be joined by tenor
saxophonist Bobby Wellins (he of Under Milk Wood fame), Randy Johnston
(guitar), Kenny Ellis (bass) and Mike Bradley (drums).

GUITARIST Martin Taylor laid down an ambitious personal marker in 1984
when, still in his twenties, he recorded the solo album A Tribute to Art
Tatum -- and lived to tell the tale. Like the legendary American piano
vituoso, Taylor proved he had both speed-of-light technique and awesome
harmonic sophistication.
Taylor is still best-known for his work with Stephane Grappelli in the
1980s and, more recently, with Charlie Byrd and Barney Kessel as part of
The Great Guitars lineup. But his recent live work, and 1993's solo
album Artistry, have firmly established him as one of today's most
compelling and enjoyable jazz voices.
Opening with a furiously paced Lulu's Back in Town, he moved through
reflective ballads -- Leonard Bernstein's suprapoignant Maria being a
notable highlight -- the blues (a superb Georgia on My Mind) and even
West African highlife.
On a jet-speed I Got Rhythm he finger-picked a simlultaneous bassline,
accompanying chords and sparkling melody. It was a bravura performance
reminiscent of Roland Kirk. The saxophonist could also play three horns
at once and, crucially, with soul, never brandishing technique for its
own sake.
Taylor wound down his set by inviting on stage the Hong Kong guitarist
Eugene Pao, who had made his UK debut earlier in the evening. The two
men tore through a spectacular Fly Me to the Moon to the cheers of a
packed Fruit Market.

AMERICAN Jeff Tarango walked away from Wimbledon yesterday with the
heaviest fine in the tournament's history.
The 26-year-old Californian stormed out of Wimbledon on Saturday after
having brandedFrench umpire Bruno Rebeuh as ''the most corrupt official
in the game.''
Tarango's French wife, Benedicte, then slapped Rebeuh, and at a news
conference, the American alleged that the umpire had favoured a number
of players, including Swiss Olympic champion Marc Rosset.
Yesterday Tarango was fined a total of #10,000, but he made it clear
he would be fighting the decision.
In a later interview with American television network NBC, he said:
''It is very serious. I could be suspended for life and fined #65,000.
This is terrible, outrageous stuff -- for standing up for something that
I believe in.''
Pressed on whether he had allowed his rage against Rebeuh to overtake
his thinking, Tarango replied: ''No, he's not worth that much to me.''
But when he was asked whether he had made a mistake, Tarango added:
''Who's to say? How long can you be pushed into a corner?
''I am disappointed and dejected and hope it all ends soon. All I want
to do now is go back to Manhattan Beach and take a rest.
''My wife and I had to stand alone and defend ourselves against
overwhelming pressures. Her resilience has been incredible.
''I've been assured a proper investigation will follow where all the
evidence of the case will be brought to the Grand Slam Committee's
attention. So far it has been conducted fairly, and I hope it will
continue to be.''

<HEADLINE>Celtic call time on Ginola deal</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CELTIC last night pulled out of the contest to sign French
international winger David Ginola after accusing his agent of ''shopping
around'' for a better deal after Celtic and his club, Paris St Germain,
had reached agreement.
The statement from the Parkhead club said that they had also agreed
terms with the player's advisers and offered a deal which ''would have
made him one of the highest paid players in Britain''.
Ginola, who was in Glasgow last week, asked for two days before giving
a final decision but four days later there still has been no response
and, the statement goes on, ''apparently he did not find the prospect of
playing in Scottish football attractive.''
The fact that, in the interim, he was then touted around other
prospective buyers proved too much for Celtic who decided to withdraw
their #2.6m offer.
The Parkhead club's stand comes as no great surprise after a series of
transfers have fallen through because of delaying tactics used by
foreign players taking advantage of the current dearth of quality to try
to satisfy excessive demands.
Already this summer Celtic had thought they had secured deals for
Peter van Vossen, of Ajax, and Dimitri Radchenko, of Santander, but both
players went elsewhere after apparently using the Celtic offer as a
basis for furthering their financial ambitions.
Only yesterday Ginola had been reported as saying that he still had
the Celtic option to consider but ''hoped that it would bring a response
from Barcelona and even Bayern Munich.''
That was before Newcastle United, who had been turned down by the
player before, re-entered the starting stalls with a fresh bid.
Celtic's deal was understood to involve a package which would have
given the winger around #10,000 a week.
However, Newcastle are believed to be coming close to doubling that
offer with their package and it now looks likely that he will end up at
St James' Park.
While that will be galling for Celtic fans they might be willing to
accept that there are limits to the spending power of the Glasgow club
while the rebuilding of the stadium continues and, in any case, players
who take quite such a mercenary approach may not be ideal for the
Scottish game at present.
Ginola had asked too much even of Barcelona, whose manager Johan
Cruyff stepped back when he realised the player wanted close to #1.2m a
year as a basic salary.
The Spanish club manager, however, is under pressure to get back in
the race after selling Hristo Stoichkov to Parma for #4m this week.
Whoever wins the chase, Celtic are entitled to let their supporters
know how they feel. However brilliant the player is, there has to come a
point when a club must judge if it is being taken for a ride.
Celtic reckoned the moment had come to pull the communication cord on
the Ginola deal. There may be some more of the same before this summer
is out.
* ENGLAND captain David Platt will decide within the next fortnight
whether to return home from Italy.
Platt's club Sampdoria have opened the way for the midfield player to
end his four-year Italian association by agreeing #4.75m terms with a
top Premiership club.
Manchester United, Everton, Aston Villa, and Blackburn have all been
linked with Platt, whose career transfer moves total a world record
#17.4m.
Now, competition to land Platt looks set to intensify as the former
Villa player headed for a holiday in Sardinia to consider his options.

GREG Rusedski bowed out of Wimbledon -- yet he was still a winner --
after having forced Pete Sampras to produce top-drawer tennis in their
Centre Court showdown yesterday.
Rusedski's dream of toppling the champion faltered as Sampras blunted
his main serving weapon to stay on course for a hat trick of titles. But
Rusedski viewed the whole experience as a vital step towards his
ultimate goal of becoming Wimbledon champion.
''Now I know how it feels to play the best grass court player of my
generation,'' he said. ''But I have gained such confidence from reaching
the fourth round that it makes my dream of winning Wimbledon one day
much more realistic.''
Sampras tamed Rusedski's bullet serve, and fired a few of his own, to
win 6-4, 6-3, 7-5, in 90 minutes of high quality tennis.
The tension-laden cut and thrust between the pair continued at their
news conferences. ''I tried to wipe the smile off his face,'' said
Sampras. ''He's never going to wipe the smile off my face,'' responded
Rusedski.
Sampras demolished Britain's last singles survivor on court -- then
set about rubbishing his game. ''He has a big serve, but if you get it
back, he's pretty average,'' said Sampras.
Montreal-born Rusedski stuck to his task magnificently. But in the
end, Sampras had too many shots in his locker for the 21-year-old, who
made his exit a much richer player -- both in the bank, and in the mind.
His tournament earnings of #25,000 pale into insignificance beside the
other gains made in his first Wimbledon as a Briton. Rusedski won his
way into the hearts of British fans with victories over three Frenchmen,
and gained invaluable experience from his first tournament meeting with
Sampras.
The toothpaste smile did vanish briefly when controversial umpire
Bruno Rebeuh over-ruled a line call. It was soon back, but it couldn't
dazzle Sampras. ''I was totally focussed and just went out to kick his
ass,'' said Sampras.
At least Rusedski can claim to have outgunned ''Pistol Pete'' on the
serve. Rusedski sent down 13 aces at a top speed of 131mph, bringing his
tournament total to 90 in four matches. Sampras managed nine with a top
speed of 124mph.
But on the debit side Rusedski delivered seven double faults to two by
Sampras, whose most worrying moment arrived in the first set. As he
raced wide on his right to chase a Rusedski forehand, the champion slid
on greasy turf and went headfirst over the rolled-up canvas court cover
towards a photographers' box. But he got up and promptly captured the
set to take a command he never relinquished.
Now Rusedski can sit back and wait for the commercial offers to roll
in before making his Davis Cup debut for Britain against Monaco in
Eastbourne later this month.
Sampras, meanwhile, goes on to a quarter-final meeting with Shuzo
Matsuoka who became the first Japanese man to reach that stage in the
Open era when he beat American Michael Joyce 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. Jiro Sata in
1933 was the last Japanese man to reach the quarter-final of a Grand
Slam event.
Third-seeded Boris Becker went through to the quarter-finals for the
eighth successive year when he beat Dick Norman, the 6ft 8in lucky loser
from Belgium, by 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Court No.2, which did not live up to
its reputation as ''the graveyard of champions.''
Becker, three times champion, had never seen Norman before they met on
court, and said his first reaction was: ''Wow, he's huge, he's a giant.
I don't want to get into any battle with him.''
''I thought he would serve bigger. He served huge at times but not as
big as I had heard from all the other people.''
There were no service breaks in the first 12 games but Becker staved
off three break points early in the set and then saved a set point at
4-5 with a service winner.
But once he had won the tie-breaker on his third set point he was
never again in any real danger. He broke the Norman serve twice, in the
fourth game of the second set and the third game of the third and they
were enough to win him both sets for a comfortable victory.
Becker now meets Cedric Pioline of France, who became the third
unseeded player to reach the last eight with a 7-6, 6-3, 6-2, win over
Czech Petr Korda.
Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic set up a
quarter-final meeting after seeing off lower-ranked opponents.
Kafelnikov, the sixth seed, raced to a 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, straight sets
victory over American Aaron Krickstein. Fourth seed Ivanisevic had to
work harder to overcome No.14 seed, American Todd Martin, by 6-4, 7-6,
6-7, 7-6.

* MYSTERY surrounded the whereabouts of American doubles player Murphy
Jensen last night after he had failed to show up for a mixed doubles
match. Even police cannot trace him.
Jensen, 24, was due to partner Brenda Schultz-McCarthy against
compatriots Kelly Jones and Katrina Adams on Court No.3. The other three
players were on time, and umpire Roland Herfel waited the required 15
minutes before ruling the match a default. Jensen has been fined #660.

FRENCHMAN Laurent Jalabert sported a big smile and the leader's yellow
jersey after the second stage of the Tour de France yesterday, one year
to the day after a terrible accident left him with the blues.
After the 235-km Brittany stage from Perros-Guirec he took over the
lead from compatriot Jacky Durand to erase the memory of his mishap.
It was on July 3 last year that he crashed with Belgian Wilfied
Nelissen in a sprint finish in Armentieres and was taken to hospital
with blood pouring from head wounds.
''This is a great present for an anniversary,'' said the delighted
Frenchman at the end of a stage won in a sprint finish by Italian Mario
Cipollini.
Jalabert, the form rider this season with a series of victories, had
been seven seconds behind Durand at the start. But he and his Spanish
ONCE team featured strongly in a late break by a group of riders who
finished 19 seconds ahead of the main peloton.
Favourites Miguel Indurain and Tony Rominger joined the breakaway. The
latter is eleventh overall, 29 seconds behind Jalabert, with Indurain
fifteenth, five seconds back from the Swiss rider.
Both have reason to worry about the on-form Jalabert, whose strong
team could well help him to increase his lead in today's team trial
third stage over 67km from Mayenne to Alencon. Once thought of as a
sprint specialist, he has widened his repertoire this season.
Leading stage placings: 1, Mario Cipollini (Italy) Mercatone Uno 5hr
26min 35sec; 2, Giovanni Lombardi (Italy) Polti; 3, Djamolidine

IT was back to the drawing board for Scotland's selectors last night
after their much-vaunted ''new look'' side tumbled to a 135-103 defeat
against champions England in the Home International series at Llanelli.
The Scots trailed 35-25 after the opening five ends and 65-57 at
half-way, but England then opened a 32-shot lead.
The Scots briefly threatened over the last quarter and closed the gap
to 16 shots, but England pulled away again to finish 32 shots ahead.
The Scots managed just one winning rink, with double Commonwealth gold
medallist George Adrain recovering from a slow start to beat David Ward
27-23.
Elsewhere, it was a tale of woe for the Scots. Naill Currie lost 24-11
to Gary Smith, Willie Wood went down 24-12 to Tony Allcock, Commonwealth
champion Richard Corsie lost 26-18 to David Cutler, with England also
finishing ahead on the two other rinks.
John Bell just got the better of Raymond Logan 17-15 and world indoor
champion Andy Thomson recovered from 18-12 down with six to play to edge
out John Aitken 21-20.
In yesterday's other match Ireland beat debutantes Channel Islands
135-106.
Scotland did have some cheer earlier in the day when Chirnside's
Robert Patterson claimed a place in tomorrow's junior singles final.
Patterson held off a determined fightback from English title-holder
Steven Mead to edge through 21-18.
Scottish singles hopes ended when Marchmount's Colin Peacock went down
21-17 to English title-holder Brett Morley. Home international results:
England 135 Scotland 103. Rink scores (English skips first): D Ward
lost to G Adrain 23-27, A Thomson beat J Aitken 21-20, A Allcock beat W
W Wood 24-12, J Bell beat R Logan 17-15, D Cutler beat R Corsie 26-18, G
Smith beat N Currie 24-11.
Ireland 135, Channel Islands 106. Rink scores (Irish skips first): S
Allen beat B Simon 26-17, G McCloy drew with D Lucas 20-20, P Smyth beat
K Ellis 23-13, E Parkinson beat A McKinnon 25-15, N Graham lost to D Le
Marquand 19-25, C Davis beat C Renouf 22-16.

WEST Indies were left clutching at straws last night after the
humiliation of their innings and 121-run thrashing by Sussex. But
skipper Richie Richardson, caught in the middle of a desperate run of
bad form, left Hove insisting that he felt ''in good nick.''
He is under severe pressure because of West Indies' Test defeat at
Lord's last week, and then the sending home of fast bowler Winston
Benjamin on Friday. He said: ''I'm sure we'll bounce back in the
Edgbaston Test.''
As the West Indians began their journey north to Birmingham for the
start of the crucial third Test on Thursday, Sussex captain Alan Wells
said: ''I've never seen a West Indies side looking so down,'' followed
by tourists' coach Andy Roberts admitting his side were ''mentally
tired.''
Bowled out for 186 and 139 after having resumed the final day on 167
for seven in their first innings, West Indies' total resistance lasted
for barely more than three-and-a-half hours.
It was their first innings defeat against an English county since 1939
(v Somerset) and their first loss since 1976 (v Middlesex). The last
time they were made to follow on in a county tour match was against Kent
in 1933.
Sussex took just 45 minutes to finish off their first innings, and
then the oldest man on the county circuit, 46-year-old Eddie Hemmings,
teamed up with promising young paceman Jason Lewry to complete the West
Indian misery.
Hemmings finished with four for 33 and 24-year-old left-armer Lewry
picked up four for 38. Yesterday's English scores:
Britannic Assurance County Championship -- At Swansea. Durham (23pts)
beat Glamorgan (7pts) by six wickets. Glamorgan 335 (H Morris 106, P A
Cottey 60, M P Maynard 59, M Prabhakar 4-47) and 336 for nine decl (P A
Cottey 130, M P Maynard 67, D M Cox 4-141), Durham 331 (M Prabhakar 101,
J I Longley 58, M A Roseberry 56, D A Blenkiron 53) and 343 for four (D
A Blenkiron 145, S Hutton 91).
At Trent Bridge. Nottinghamshire (8) drew with Somerset (6). Somerset
366 (M N Lathwell 110, R J Harden 66, J E Hindson 5-67) and 361 (P D
Bowler 91, S C Ecclestone 67, K A Parsons 61, J E Hindson 5-78),
Nottinghamshire 479 (R T Robinson 134, P R Pollard 120) and 8 for no
wicket.
At Worcester. Worcestershire (22) beat Leicestershire (7) by 134 runs.
Worcestershire 279 (G R Haynes 55, T M Moody 51, G J Parsons 4-46) and
297 (D A Leatherdale 51, P J Newport 50), Leicestershire 359 (N E Briers

ESPECIALLY when the Open Championship returns to the headquarters of
golf at St Andrews, the squeeze to survive the rigours of the final
qualifying competition is more severe than usual and a number of
distinguished names not often associated with a pursuit usually well
below their exalted status becomes embroiled in the ugly struggle.
At Ladybank, Leven Links, Lundin, and Scotscraig on July 16 and 17,
120 competitors will assemble at each course and perhaps fewer than 60
of the 480 players will go through to join the 93 currently exempt for
the championship itself, to be held on the Old course for the
twenty-fifth time from July 20 to 23.
Those at Ladybank include the Ryder Cup golfer Steven Richardson, the
successful US Tour player, Mark Brooks, whose second-round 64 at
Turnberry was the joint lowest score of last year's Open, the Scottish
amateur champion, Hugh McKibbin, and Justin Leonard, the former US
amateur title-holder.
Gordon Brand Jr, born in Burntisland, returns close to home to play at
Leven.
He will be joined there by another Ryder Cup golfer, Peter Baker,
Colin Gillies, the Scottish professional champion, Deane Beman, the
former US Tour commissioner, and Philip Walton, winner of two
tournaments in Europe this season.
At Lundin, the field will include three other winners of 1995 European
tournaments in Adam Hunter (Portuguese), Andy Oldcorn (Jersey), and the
New Zealander Greg Turner (Balearic) and the American John Morse, the
1990 Australian open champion and, after 26 events, still this year's
only first-time winner on the US Tour.
Among those due to compete at Scotscraig are Paul Broadhurst, recently
winner of the French open, and the Swedish Ryder Cup player Joakim
Haeggman.
However, as is now customary, two eleventh-hour avenues of escape from
this preliminary ordeal are available to players not otherwise exempt
which could, of course, reduce the number of qualifying places.
These are the top five and ties finishing in the first 20 of a
cumulative money list from seven tournaments up to and including the
Irish open, which begins on Thursday, and the first five who finish in
the leading 20 in the Scottish open, the last event before the Open and
which will be held next week at Carnoustie.
In the latter event, it was announced yesterday, an already
outstanding field has been further strengthened. The contenders now
include Colin Montgomerie, Nick Faldo, and Severiano Ballesteros.
* CRAIG Gibson, of Larkhall, carded a four-over-par 75 to win the
under-16 section of the Golf Foundation Wheetabix Age-group Championship

ANDRE Agassi -- transparent baggy shorts and all which gave the fans
some bare-faced cheek -- awarded himself a perfect 10 yesterday. But
that was for his play after cruising into the Wimbledon quarter-finals
for the fourth time in five years with a straight sets win over
Alexander Mronz.
Agassi outclassed the German world No.117 6-3, 6-3, 6-3, to earn a
meeting with unseeded Dutch giant-killer Jacco Eltingh, who ousted South
African seventh seed Wayne Ferreira.
The top seed from Las Vegas admitted playing on grass is aging him
beyond his 25 years but clearly feels in the mood to regain the crown he
captured three years ago.
''Psychologically I'm definitely 10 out of 10,'' said Agassi. ''On
hitting the ball I'm around nine. I'll have to move it up a little
bit.'' Mronz, a 30-year-old from Cologne who found himself in the last
16 when American Jeff Tarango shocked tennis by walking off court during
their third round match on Saturday, wanted to make it a memorable
centre court debut, but the German never came to terms with the pace of
Agassi's shots.
Now Agassi is ready for Eltingh, the surprise package who toppled
ninth seed Michael Stich and former world No 1 Mats Wilander before
beating Ferreira 6-4, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.

ESPECIALLY when the Open Championship returns to the headquarters of
golf at St Andrews, the squeeze to survive the rigours of the final
qualifying competition is more severe than usual and a number of
distinguished names not often associated with a pursuit usually well
below their exalted status becomes embroiled in the ugly struggle.
At Ladybank, Leven Links, Lundin, and Scotscraig on July 16 and 17,
120 competitors will assemble at each course and perhaps fewer than 60
of the 480 players will go through to join the 93 currently exempt for
the championship itself, to be held on the Old course for the
twenty-fifth time from July 20 to 23.
Those at Ladybank include the Ryder Cup golfer Steven Richardson Mark
Brooks Scottish amateur champion Hugh McKibbin, and Justin Leonard, the
former US amateur title-holder.
Gordon Brand Jr will play at Leven where he will be joined by Peter
Baker, Colin Gillies Deane Beman, the former US Tour commissioner, and
Philip Walton.
At Lundin, the field will include three other winners of 1995 European
tournaments in Adam Hunter (Portuguese), Andy Oldcorn (Jersey), and the
New Zealander Greg Turner (Balearic) and the American John Morse, the
1990 Australian open champion.
Among those due to compete at Scotscraig are Paul Broadhurst and the
Swedish Ryder Cup player Joakim Haeggman.

AUSTRALIA'S world-record Test points scorer, Michael Lynagh, is
retiring from international and state rugby to concentrate on business
and family life.
''There comes a point for everyone when you have to say it's time to
go on with other aspects of your life,'' said 31-year-old Lynagh, scorer
of 911 points from 72 Test matches.
A veteran of the three World Cups, including Australia's triumph in
1991, Lynagh scored 17 Test tries and kicked 140 conversions, 177
penalties, and nine drop goals. He captained the Wallabies 15 times.
Lynagh, a real estate consultant, also retired from rugby with his
home state Queensland, but will honour a commitment to play one more
season for Italian club Treviso.
He played 47 Tests alongside former captain Nick Farr-Jones, a world
record for a half-back pairing.

BILLY Kirkwood's rebuilding plans for Dundee United took another step
forward yesterday when he signed Motherwell defender Rab Shannon on a
three-year deal.
Shannon -- a former club-mate of Kirkwood at Dundee -- moves to
Tannadice from Fir Park under freedom of contract.
United will now try to settle on a fee for the player and avoid going
to a transfer tribunal.
Shannon said: ''I realise it is a bit of a gamble dropping down a
division but Dundee United are one of the biggest clubs in Scotland.
''I want to play at the top level and, hopefully, I can help United
back to the premier division in one season.''
* DUNDEE have turned down a #200,000-plus bid from Danish club Odense
for midfield player Morten Wieghorst.
* ALAN Ball agreed to fill the Manchester City managerial hot seat --
and then revealed he was staggered that he had been allowed to meet the
Maine Road club.
''I was amazed when Southampton gave City permission to approach me,''
said Ball after having agreed a three-year contract said to be worth
close to #150,000 a season.
''If Southampton had said 'no' that would have been the end of it. I
have not walked out on Southampton. I have done everything by the book.
''Now, I must look to the future and get down to doing my best for
City. It's a great challenge -- and I have always enjoyed a challenge.''
* LUTON Town have named former youth team manager Terry Westley as
David Pleat's successor -- but will not appoint him permanently until
their compensation wrangle with Sheffield Wednesday is resolved.
Westley comes in as caretaker manager, with Mick McGiven -- the former
Ipswich chief -- confirmed as first-team coach.
* ROBERTO Baggio said yesterday that he is definitely leaving Juventus
and that he will announce his new team in a few days.
Former European champions AC Milan, the club owned by former premier
and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, is expected to be Baggio's most
likely choice.
''I will decide my future in the next few days, after weighing
different bids,'' the Italian World Cup striker said.
* OSSIE Ardiles is refusing to throw aside his theories on the
''beautiful game'' as he prepares for a new challenge in Latin America.
The little Argentinian, sacked by Tottenham in November, starts work
today as coach at Mexico's biggest and most popular club Deportivo
Guadalajara where the demands will be just as great as at White Hart
Lane.
Ardiles has signed a one-year contract and is expected to win the
Mexican championship, which record title-holders Guadalajara have not
taken for eight years.
* HRISTO Stoichkov lays the blame for his departure from Barcelona
firmly on the shoulders of Dutch coach Johan Cruyff, claiming he was
jealous of his success.
The Bulgarian internationalist, currently finalising a three-year deal
said to be worth $15m with UEFA Cup holders Parma, says bad feeling
between two of Europe's greatest footballers stemmed from Cruyff's
attitude.
''It's clear that he doesn't want me. He told me that if I stayed I
wouldn't play,'' he was quoted as saying in the Barcelona-based sports
paper El Mundo Deportivo.
''I've achieved things with Barca that Cruyff never did while he was
playing for the club. That's what hurts him.''
''Three years ago I had a very attractive offer from Paris St Germain
but I decided to stay. Now the situation is very different,'' Stoichkov
said. ''I decided which club to go to but it's Barca that have thrown me
out.''

SHOWING a strong commitment to helping the Clyde reflect the worldwide
growth of the Etchells class, 43 boats assembled off Gourock yesterday
for the first of six races which will decide the British Open and
National Championship.
With the majority having travelled from Cowes and Burnham, and even a
lone entrant from Hampton New Jersey, they will be looking for slightly
more consistent breezes through the five-day six-race regatta than
yesterday's fickle affair if they are to leave endorsing the Clyde's
excellent international reputation.
The north-westerly breeze rarely stepped over the 10 knots mark, and
left the windward leeward track littered with unforeseen patches of
light airs which dogged progress for even some of the top names in the
class.
Early leader Paul Shiels, in China White (Cowes), was passed after the
leeward mark by his south-coast compatriot, Mike Till, in Festina who
managed to stay ahead to take first gun.
Threatening, only four boat lengths astern, was Keith Lawrence, who
finished top home boat, crewed by Andy Hemmings and Stewart Childerley
-- both past Olympic sailors now campaigning for 1996 selection.
Sailing Playback, Lawrence was seventh at the first turning mark and
gained places on each successive leg.
Inverkip's David Miles' boat, Stormtrooper, the oldest in the fleet,
gained an excellent eleventh place. Results:
Race 1 -- 1, Festina, M Till (Cowes); 2, Playback, K Lawrence
(Gourock); 3, Naughty By Nature, J Clark (Cowes); 4, Katemba, T Law
(Cowes); 5, Danish Blue, P R Hoj Jensen (Burnham).

JOSE Maria Olazabal has pulled out of this week's Murphy's Irish Open
at Mount Juliet.
The Spanish Ryder Cup player is under treatment for a small tumour on
his right foot and has decided to rest rather than risk aggravating the
problem just a fortnight before the Open championship at St Andrews.
He is expected to make a decision on next week's Scottish Open later
this week.
Mark Roe and Italian Costantino Rocca have also withdrawn.
Roe -- top European at the US Open last month -- has had knee trouble
since, while Rocca has been suffering from shoulder pain.
The Irish Open still boasts a high-quality field including world No.1
Greg Norman, defending champion Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, who
missed the French Open two weeks ago because of a back injury, and
American Craig Stadler.
* KING'S Links professional Scott Henderson opens his defence of the
Scottish Assistants' Championship at Newmachar Golf Club, outside
Aberdeen, today with the added incentive of a trip to watch the Ryder
Cup in September if he retains the title.
The 25-year-old local landed the prestigious title across the
treacherous parkland course designed by Peter Alliss and Dave Thomas
when he beat Euan McIntosh (Braid Hills) to the winner's cheque of
nearly #800 by a stroke with a five-under-par total.
This year, however, the field also have the chance to sample the
unique atmosphere of the biennial clash between the top professional
golfers of Europe and America at Oakhill in Rochester courtesy of golf
maufacturer Titleist and Footjoy Worldwide.

HORDES of barefoot boys in shorts digging and weeding, and summer fun
splashing in the river are two abiding memories of Bob Kerr's boyhood.
He was a Barnardo's boy in the 1940s and fifties when, writes Jennifer
Cunningham, childcare meant 40 or 50 children living in a large house in
the country.
''The gardening was useful,'' he says, showing off the figs ripening
on the wall of his house in Dumfries, the bumper crop of plums and the
perfect vegetable patch. Barnardo's shaped his life, giving him certain
skills and denying him others.
''I could hardly read and write when I left,'' he admits, but he could
make a snare to catch a rabbit, swim like a fish and stand up for
himself. That latter quality was recognised by colleagues in the army
and woollen mills who made him shop steward.
He and his young sister, Heather, were born in India, where his father
was in the Calcutta police and had met his mother, Marjorie Wilson, who
had been brought up on a jute plantation. She developed septicaemia and
was ordered home, but died en route in Aden. His father arrived in
London with two small children just before the outbreak of war and was
soon called up and the children found themselves in a Barnardo's home in
Kent.
They were evacuated to Balcary House in Hawick of which Bob still has
mainly happy memories (he's still in touch with some of the staff), but
the policy then was to split boys and girls at the age of 12 and he was
sent to North Shields.
His schoolwork declined until the last report condemned him as being
incapable of learning. At the age of 15 Barnardo's sent him to London as
an apprentice gardener, but the young Bob had other ideas. ''As soon as
I got my first wage packet, I was off back to Hawick.''
When he turned up at Balcary, he discovered there had been a
nationwide panic throughout Barnardo's, who were responsible for him
until the age of 16. He found himself a job, but digs cost him 30/- a
week, which was more than he earned.
Advised that he could get help to make up the difference, he
discovered that since his father had never registered him in the UK, he
was officially a displaced person. Once again Barnardo's stepped in and
paid the #1 a week which allowed him to keep his digs.
His plan to take the #10 emigration passage to Australia was also
thwarted by the lack of official records. With typical get-up-and-go he
hitch-hiked to London to discover what information Barnardo's had on his
family and on his annual holiday went to Hull to track down his father.
He discovered that his father had married again and had a second
family, but as a former Barnardo's boy himself had known they would care
for his children. Eventually scrutiny of his father's birth certificate
convinced the emigration authorities that Bob was not an Indian seeking
his future in Australia.
''The Army got me first,'' he says, regretfully. After service as a
Cameron Highlander in Aden, Kenya, Kashmir and Cyprus, he returned to
Hawick and a job in a mill.
Bob went to a woollen mill in Hawick then moved to another one in
Dumfries, where he married, raised two sons and has become a kenspeckle
figure, coming within eight votes of being elected to the regional
council for the SNP. Seeing his boys go to university inspired him to
return to education, gaining an A-grade Higher in Art followed by a
diploma in heritage management from Cumbria College of Art.
Bob displays alternately, diffidence and an astonishing tenacity --
and has a deep sense of loyalty to Barnardo's. He recently compiled a
video tape of all their old film footage. As we watch groups of wartime
children in standard black bathing costumes and wellingtons, (''They
were all size eight, they just gave the home a batch from the factory'')
he points to various girls who ''did well'' in careers or by marrying
farmers.
A great organiser of reunions, he says it is much easier to get boys
to go to reunions than girls. One reunion he has never achieved is with
his sister, Heather. She stayed at Balcary when he was moved to North
Shields and grew into a renowned beauty who was runner-up in the Miss
Great Britain competition. They lost touch after he got married. Nor has
he ever been able to trace any of his mother's family, the Wilsons, who
because of the jute connection are probably from Dundee.
He still feels passionately about youngsters who get a raw deal. ''We
haven't made much progress in all these years; even graduates cannot get
jobs now. At least there were jobs when we were young. I saw a child in
the street the other day with rickets -- why can't they give them milk
at school?''

OCCASIONALLY, the man who sits in the Sports Editor's chair in this
building glowers over his spectacles in a thoroughly menacing fashion,
which is alarming enough for those not transfixed by the stare but even
more disturbing for the recipient when he is entirely baffled as to what
has aroused such displeasure.
However, it has become clear that the reason for this spasmodic
behaviour is all to do with horseracing.
Our man in charge, faced with the impossibility of finding space for
all the race meetings for the next morning's paper, applies an
irrational and unjustified culpability in the direction of one who
happens to be fond of the Sport of Kings.
Faced with that logic, it is difficult not to try to find sympathy
with the gaffer but, in fact, his problems are symptomatic of the
foolish road down which racing seems to be heading with each succeeding
year, even if those at the top do not appear to recognise it. That
includes Tristram Ricketts, the chief executive of the British
Horseracing Board, who gave the press problem short shrift when he spoke
at the Herald Racing Awards dinner recently.
Despite the fact that, for at least the past two decades, people
within the sport have been insisting that there is too much racing, a
kind of Oliver Twist mentality, more-more-more, has prevailed and the
latest manifestation is the 1996 fixture list, which contains a record
number of meetings.
There are various reasons why the racing game has exploded with such
force, the most potent being avarice. More cards mean more betting
opportunities, more money for the bookies, the Government and racing
authorities. Never mind the quality, count the cash.
Yet it is quite possible that the continual headlong dash along this
route will prove counter-productive in the end. Already, the number of
mediocre, not to say bad, horses in training has reached ridiculous
proportions and, while it may be true that many punters would back one
Clydesdale to beat another, there are enough discerning students of the
game to raise a sizeable rebellion at the poverty of the standards.
More important, however, is that racing should pay heed to the
difficulties in publicising race meetings when there are so many
scheduled for the same day. A few weeks ago, on Derby day, there were
nine meetings, which not only made it difficult for newspapers to give
the biggest classic of the year proper coverage, but meant that some
meetings had to be left out or abbreviated.
Ricketts did not dwell on the massive problems facing the newspaper
industry, which wishes to do its best for a sport that has long been
considered part of the sports page furniture. He ''recognised'' them but
went on to talk of the board's ''strong commitment to the
customer-friendly principle'' . . . he pointed out the desire to provide
opportunities for owners to see their horses run, and the need of
punters to have a regular diet of competitive racing ''for their
enjoyment and the boost it gives to betting levy. At #50m a year it is
significant.''
Racing, according to Ricketts, also needs to help bookies combat the
lottery and cater for all key customers.
All of that is fair enough but the chief executive and his cohorts
ought to declare blinkers before they defend themselves in this fashion.
Their quest for ever more betting opportunities (for that is the bottom
line) may rebound by overwhelming not only the punter trying to find
time to scan the prospective runners, but also the daily papers, whose
free and continuous publicity for meetings from Perth to Newton Abbot
has been an integral contributor to the sport's popularity.
It may true that, in the age of teletext and sophisticated technology,
race runners can be seen elsewhere, but the great majority of interested
people get their information from their daily papers, which have
encouraged and attracted sponsors as well as racegoers.
If the sport elects to ignore the requirements of the written media,
forcing it to be ruthlessly selective when putting race meetings up
against all the other sports competing for space, the result could be
serious diminution of attendance and interest in the small meetings
throughout Britain.
The net result in due course could be the exact opposite of what is
intended. The small meetings, many of them excellent little courses with
go-ahead executives, could be squeezed out of existence because of lack
of national publicity.
Not everybody is inclined to buy the trade papers, believing they
should see as much as they require on a daily basis in their favourite
morning paper. Racing ought to be very careful in disregarding their
needs.

THE biggest Wimbledon nightmare for a top woman tennis player?
For Mary Joe Fernandez and Lindsay Davenport it had little to do with
the prospect of playing Steffi Graf, or curtseying to the Royal Box . .
. their ultimate horror was having to play each other.
The two Americans had spent the fortnight before Wimbledon practising
together, and are best friends on the women's tour.
''Unfortunately, we're kinda nice people who didn't want to do this to
each other,'' said Davenport. A guilt-stricken Fernandez won 7-6, 6-1.
''In fact, she is more like a sister to me and we were both crying at
the end,'' explained 19-year-old Davenport.
''It was weird trying to kill your best friend in a big tournament
like this, but she's got Steffi now, and we both know she's going to
have a pretty tough time.''

THATCHED, from the small Yorkshire yard of Ronnie Barr, upstaged the
Queen's horse Piquant at Edinburgh last night when he won the East
Lothian District Council Handicap.
They started 7-2 joint favourites for the race, but Piquant, ridden by
Jason Weaver, was soon struggling in last place while Thatched was never
far off the pace.
Lancashire Life led until inside the final furlong. Then Paul Fessey
brought Thatched through the field and went on to win by three lengths.
Piquant finished seventh of the eight runners, beaten almost eight
lengths.
On a pleasant sunny evening, a large crowd turned out for the historic
visit of the Queen to unveil a plaque officially opening the new
corporate hospitality complex and improvements to the stable facilities.
The Queen met racecourse officials before watching the first race, an
apprentice handicap over a mile-and-a-half won by Duggan, a 5-1 chance.
Twenty-year-old Jo Hunnam, from Newcastle, riding the third winner of
her career, held up Duggan until the last possible moment, bringing him
with a late burst to overtake Thisonesforalice close to the line. The
Queen presented the trophy to winning trainer David Evans.

Mick Channon can do little wrong these days, and it was no surprise
when Halbert (9-2), ridden by Kevin Darley, made all the running to win
the Wheatsheaf Catering Selling Handicap for the Lambourn yard. It was
Channon's forty-eighth winner of the season.
Twice runner-up recently Jackmanii came good for Duns trainer Tom Kemp
in the Daily Star Limited Stakes. It was the only Scottish winner of the
meeting and Kemp's third success this season.

Thomas Barnardo, born 150 years ago today, rescued thousands of
Victorian children from appalling conditions. Jennifer Cunningham
reports on the vital work his charity still provides
THOMAS Barnardo was born in Dublin 150 years ago today. At the age of
17, he went to London to train as a medical missionary, but the poverty
and appalling conditions in which he found children living in the East
End of London changed the course of his life -- and the lives of
thousands of children.
The development of the charity, which still bears his name, is a
mirror of child welfare services in Britain. The overcrowding, lack of
sanitation, and homelessness which became evident during the cholera
epidemic of 1866, prompted Barnardo to set up a ragged school for both
boys and girls in London's East End in 1867.
Three years later, he opened a home for boys which would provide them
not only with somewhere to live, but education and training for a trade.
It was followed six years later by a girls' village consisting of 13
''cottages'' each housing 20 girls built round a village green.
It was the philanthropic model of the day and repeated in ventures
like Quarrier's Homes at Bridge of Weir, but Barnardo himself recognised
the artificial nature of the homes: ''But did you ever know of a family
of 20 daughters?'' he once asked.
More than 8000 children lived in Barnardo's homes when residential
care was at its height in the 1930s. Some were war orphans, some were
illegitimate or simply from families whose circumstances did not allow
them to care for them. Since then childcare policy has changed to
supporting parents in caring for their own children.
Despite the welfare state and statutory duties on social work
departments, the need is as great as ever. Today, Barnardo's works with
22,000 families and young people in the UK, 1800 of them in Scotland.
Most of them live with their parents, but there are a few residential
units for specific purposes such as housing people with learning
difficulties. Some projects may have small, short-term residential
units, for example, for children whose families have broken down but
will also work with families in the community.
Poverty and homelessness with attendant crime and prostitution are
still major problems 130 years after Barnardo set about tackling them.
Their work in Scotland ranges from support, to teenagers leaving care,
to alternatives for custody for 16 and 17-year-old offenders. Almost all
of their work is now in partnership with central or local government or
other agencies such as health boards, and other charities. Some of it,
such as the alternatives to custody project in Motherwell, is so
innovative it is being funded for research purposes by the Scottish
Office.
Although orphan is a word and concept that has hardly figured in most
people's consciousness since the end of the war, the prospect of young
children being left without parents is one that Barnardo's is tackling.
The Riverside Projects in Edinburgh and Dundee, and a family placement
service, gives families affected by HIV and Aids the opportunity to plan
for the care of children whose parents are likely to die.
Project leader Patti Ironside said a typical user of the service was a
mother who was HIV positive with two children, one of which also had the
virus while the other did not. The family placement service allowed her
to have the children cared for when she was not well enough to look
after them, but the project also worked with the mother and children to
help them to come to terms with the illness and the possibility of
death.
Some of the work with the children is directed towards helping them
express their emotions, including anger. In families where there is no
relative available to care for the children, it also allows parents and
children to choose a possible future foster family. Even if they do not
become permanent carers, they are people who know the children well and
who can be advocates on their behalf during future planning.
''Although the spread of HIV in Edinburgh was initially through
intravenous drug use, we are now seeing transmission through
heterosexual intercourse and we expect to see many more children
affected by Aids in the family. Whether they themselves are infected,
they may need flexible care from a foster family,'' said Ironside.
Although almost all of Barnardo's work is now in partnership with
other agencies, 50% is funded from voluntary donations. That
independence enables them to fill the gaps left between social work,
education, housing, criminal justice, and health.
Hugh Mackintosh, the charity's Scottish director, points to very
practical projects such as support for 10 homeless families, one with
five children, trying to keep their sanity while living in
bed-and-breakfast accommodation in Ayr. Another is support for black
families with disabled children in Glasgow, many of whom were not
getting all the services available.
One of his main concerns is the level of homelessness anong young
people. ''We know that many 16 and 17-year-old are at odds with their
families for a variety of reasons. With no benefit and very few jobs
available to them, they are very vulnerable. Youth unemployment is a
major problem.
''When I was young in the fifties, young people could find themselves
a job and accommodation without great difficulty. Now they are more
likely to end up on the streets. We know that young people from rural
areas tend to congregate in Glasgow and then drift on to London. We have
two projects to help them: one for homeless young people in Clydesdale
district and the City Centre Initiative to give support and identify the
longer-term needs of young men and women on the streets and at risk from
prostitution and exploitation.''
Just how much progress have we made since 1866?

LINFORD Christie left old foe Carl Lewis for dead with a dazzling
victory in the Stade Charlety in Paris last night -- then called for an
end to his dispute with the British Athletic Federation over domestic
meetings.
Christie missed the first meeting of the season at Gateshead
yesterday, and looks as though he will sit out Friday's Grand Prix at
Crystal Palace.
The federation insists it does not have ''a bottomless barrel'' but
Christie declared: ''The dispute has nothing to do with money, it's
about principle.
''I was delighted to win here but not delighted in having to miss
Gateshead. I should have been there.
''Hopefully, someone with intelligence will sit down and try to sort
out this problem.''
Christie added: ''The door to Crystal Palace is still open. Let us
hope intelligence will prevail.''
He may have been paid only half the reputed #66,000 promoter Raymond
Lorre shelled out for Lewis's services in Paris, but in terms of
sprinting currency, Christie was out on his own, galloping to victory in
10.06secs.
It confirmed his season is moving into top gear after an uncertain
start, and that he is still the man to beat at the World Championships
in Gothenburg in August.
''Linford ran a great race,'' declared Lewis, whose deal was done
before the US trials, where he failed to gain selection for the
championships at 100m.
Nigerian Davidson Ezinwa, who beat Christie at last month's Rome Grand
Prix, offered the most serious challenge.
But he was unable to match his rival's decisive surge at 60m, and
finished two-100ths of a second adrift.
World 200m champion Frankie Fredricks and American Jon Drummond both
finished ahead of Lewis, who filled an expensive fifth place in
10.25sec.
Colin Jackson, back after missing the European Cup through illness,
but still well short of his best, suffered his third defeat of the
season in the 110m hurdles after winning all his races over the distance
last year.
He finished third behind Mark Crear -- who will not be hurdling in
Gothenburg -- and fellow American Allen Johnson, the world indoor
champion, who will be there.
John Regis trailed in seventh in the 200m, won with another awesome
performance by Michael Johnson. Leading track results:

WIMBLEDON fans have tagged champion Conchita Martinez and her
Barcelona rival Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the Spanish Armada.
But Steffi Graf in full sail yesterday afternoon drew irresistible
analogies with a stately galleon cruising towards what would be her
sixth title.
Martinez, the No.3 seed who must be the most low-key reigning champion
at the All England Club for years, and Sanchez, who had to dig deep
against Graf's fellow German Anke Huber, both duly took their designated
places in the quarter-finals.
But for pure serenity and style there was again no touching Graf, who
stretched her unbeaten record this year to 29 with a 6-0, 6-1 dismissal
of overawed Argentinian Ines Gorrochategui.
As in the previous round against Kristie Boogert, Graf took just 43
minutes to complete her latest victory, fending off a break-point in the
opening game but then allowing her opponent just eight more points in
the entire first set.
The second was almost as easy and afterwards she admitted: ''There are
times when you would like to be more challenged. But the positive thing
I am taking out of it is that, although I've had two easy matches in a
row, I've also played them very well.''
Graf next meets America's only woman survivor Mary Joe Fernandez and
expects it to be much tougher against the No.13 seed. Yet Fernandez will
have to improve considerably on yesterday's performance against her
friend and fellow American Lindsay Davenport if she is genuinely to
challenge the world No.1 -- even though, on paper, her 7-6, 6-1 victory
over the seventh seed looks impressive.
Champion Martinez, meanwhile, maintained her record of not having
conceded a set when knocking out unseeded Dutch woman Petra Kamstra 6-2,
6-3, but there was a brief awkward spell when she dropped her serve at
the start of the second set and twice surrendered love-games.
It was clear, though, that the woman who rides a Harley Davison
motorcycle was keeping as much as possible in the tank for her Latin
confrontation in the quarter-finals with Gabriela Sabatini, who again
was a model of inconsistency, against American Lisa Raymond, eventually
scraping through 6-0, 3-6, 7-5.
''I just had to hang in there and be more aggressive,'' said the
glamorous Argentinian, who had trailed 5-0 to Nancy Feber in the
previous round. ''But I feel better here this year and in a few previous
ones.
''Conchita is playing great and it will be tough in the quarters but
if I get the strategy right and take a few risks, I feel I have a
chance.''
Sanchez Vicario admitted that her strategy was all wrong at the start
against Huber but she ''changed it a little'' and kept her nerve as she
turned a 4-0 deficit into a gritty 7-5, 7-6 win.
She faces big-serving Brenda Schultz-McCarthy next. The Dutch woman
fired too many bazookas for dainty unseeded Indonesian Yayuk Basuki. But
Sanchez refuses to speculate on a projected semi-final clash with local
rival Martinez.
When asked to compare herself with the champion whose triumph last
year exacerbated Arantxa's own long run of failure in eight previous
campaigns on Wimbledon's fast grass, she snapped: ''You cannot do that.
''She has her game and I have mine. Today I had to change it a little
but I'm happy to have reached the quarter-finals.''
Jana Novotna, after having cruised through the first set, had to
battle for 107 minutes before beating Nicole Bradtke, the tall, blonde
Australian, 6-0, 5-7, 6-4 in their fourth-round clash.
Fourth-seeded Novotna, who has a reputation as ''a choker'' after
having lost from apparently winning positions, was not happy at her
interview when she was asked whether she had got over her Paris
experience, when she lost to American Chanda Rubin in the French Open
after having led 5-0, 40-0 in the final set.
''Why do you ask me about it again?'' she demanded. ''I have. I don't
even know that I played any clay-court tournaments this year.''
Kimiko Date completed a fine day for Japan, following Shuzo Matsuoko's
victory in the men's singles, when she beat South African Mariaan de
Swardt 6-1, 2-6, 6-2.

Jennifer Cunningham reports on a summer programme for both young and
old
AFTER the first glorious gallop of freedom, even the best-organised
families can suffer from that word which begins with B, and no child is
allowed to utter during school holidays. Help is at hand.
For youngsters who enjoy the company of their grandparents or other
older people, Strathclyde University's inter-generational summer school
offers a range of arts and crafts courses from July 31 to August 4.
The innovative idea of matching under-fifteens with over-fifties was
such a great success last year when the first-ever inter-generational
school attracted family groups from France and Ireland during three
weeks, that even without European funding this year, the university's
Senior Studies Institute has decided to repeat it. Although restricted
to one week, that week is crammed with possibilities.
There are five courses ranging from How to Create a Children's Book to
a puppet workshop, each with a specialist tutor. Author and illustrator
Frank Rodgers (of The Bunk Bed Bus) with be the guide to creating every
sort of story from baby books via cartoons to teenage novels.
The director of the Perfect Chaos Puppet Co, Judi Legg, will be
running practical workshops on different sorts of puppet-making from
glove to marionette. Crafts, including clay for those whose day is
incomplete without some squidgy messiness, will be under the tutelage of
Pheona Kerr, whose themes will be based on mystical tales.
The more practical can opt for tapestry weaving with Lynn Ross, who
says experience is not necessary and weaving can be done by any age
group. A practical art workshop titled A Dear Green Place is based at
the Burrell gallery with opportunities for exploring indoors and out.
The only requirements are enthusiasm and a sense of fun.
The courses are open to people of 50-plus along with a young partner
aged between eight and 14. Despite the age difference, last year's
experience showed that the different skills and understanding of the two
age groups complemented one another.
One pair who are returning enthusiastically this year are Mrs Elsie
Meechan and her 10-year-old grand-daughter, Lisa Wood. ''We tried a
great range of crafts from jewellery making, which Lisa could not get
enough of to collage and decoupage. I discovered talents I never knew I
had, but I also enjoyed the afternoon activities which showed me Glasgow
through her eyes,'' said Mrs Meechan. This year, they are looking
forward to tapestry weaving.
The workshops run from 10am to 1pm each day with a break for lunch
followed by a choice of afternoon activities including urban walks,
sports activities and visits to museums. The fee for each course is #90
for each adult and child pair although the university may be able to
pair a few children with adults from the Senior Studies Institute.

Another year -- and another world record for Noureddine Morceli. It's
getting to be a yearly habit for the Algerian. He set the world rcord
for 2000 metres in Paris yesterday with a time of 4 minutes, 47.88
seconds -- almost three seconds ahead of the 4-50.81 set by Said Aouita
of Morocco in 1987 -- again at the last major regular season meet in
Paris.
''I know I had the world record in my legs,'' Morceli said. ''Last
week I did 3-32 for 1500m in St Petersburg, Russia, in very bad weather
conditions.''
Morceli now has the world records in the 1500m (3-28.82 in 1992), mile
(3-44.30 in 1993) and 3000m (7-25.11 in 1994), and, of course, his 2000
metres in Paris.
Morceli's brother, Ali, set the pace of 57.06sec for the first 400m,
and led through the 800 in 1-57.06. American Terrence Herrington took
over and helped Morceli to a 1000m mark of 2-26.15.
''When I saw the 2-26, I thought it was a little bit slow,'' Morceli
said. ''So I decided to pick up the pace.''
Morceli ran alone for the last 600m and passed the 1500 in 3-36.89 and
the mile in approximately 3-54. His last 400m was 55.0. He fell to the
ground after the finish line, and was later surrounded by Algerian fans
waving national flags as he took his victory lap.
He didn't rule out more world records in the future, although he was
taking a practical attitude. ''I am still young,'' said the 25-year-old.
''I have a lot of time.''
Haile Gebreselasie of Ethiopia failed in an attempt to recapture his
5000m world record. He was timed at 13-7.81. Moses Kiptaniui of Kenya
ran 12-55.30 last month to break the Ethiopian's mark of last year.

THE establishment of a joint economic development board involving
Grampian Enterprise and the new Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen councils is
crucial to the future of the North-east of Scotland, the chairman of
Grampian Enterprise, Mr Maitland Mackie, said last night.
Mr Mackie told the annual meeting of Grampian Enterprise that the
local government reorganisation provided ''a unique opportunity to
obtain for Grampian a co-ordinated delivery of economic development''.
The recently appointed chairman said he and chief executive Hance
Fullerton had spoken to the new Aberdeenshire Council and had received
''positive vibes''. They were hopeful of making a representation to the
Aberdeen Council shortly.
''We would like to see a joint economic development board, a small
board with the principal players sitting down and working out a
long-term economic development strategy for Grampian,'' he said.
They would identify who delivers what to prevent duplication or
competition and joint activities would be quite clearly co-ordinated to
identify who had the lead roles. A small unit should also be established
to undertake any collective activities like the central delivery of
research into the economic situation of the area, statistics, and inward
investment.
Mr Fullerton said: ''There should be a strategy for this North-east
corner. Economic development doesn't know boundaries between Kingswells
and Westhill or at the Bridge of Don roundabout. Economic strategies
should be for the whole North-east.''
Their proposal was for a joint strategy to be agreed after which it
would be determined who did what.
''There are some aspects of economic development which neither of the
major players can afford to support on their own -- a lot of the things
that have been carried by Grampian Regional Council.
''For things such as research and information, international trade
development, and inward investment we believe there should be a small
body to take matters forward on behalf of all the players. That body
needs to be funded and we are saying it should be funded by those who
have the money -- the councils plus ourselves.''

A ROW between two health trusts vying to win the contract to build a
new hospital deepened yesterday when one of the rivals revealed firm
plans for the development and claimed the backing of Scottish landowner
and motor racing driving Johnny Dumfries.
The Ayrshire and Arran Community Health Trust and the South Ayrshire
Hospitals Trust are both hoping to build the #13m community hospital --
proposed by Ayrshire and Arran Health Board -- in their own area.
But the delay caused by the bitter argument over who should win the
contract could threaten millions of pounds of Scottish Office funding,
the local MP has warned.
South Ayrshire managers have drawn up plans to build on the site of
Ballochmyle Hospital, near Mauchline, which is currently being run down
for closure. They claim the site is already in public ownership and is
served by utilities such as water and electricity.
Ayrshire and Arran Trust identified a firm site for the project
yesterday. Officials said it should be built in Ayr Road, Cumnock,
several miles from the other proposed area.
The green-field site at Cumnock is currently used for sheep grazing
and is owned by the Dumfries Trust, headed by racing driver and Marquis
of Bute Johnny Dumfries.
But AACHT managers said the trust had agreed to sell the land, despite
the fact that it was not on the market, because the marquis supported
the hospital plans.
Mr Scott McConnell, vice chairman of the trust, said: ''This site will
give the greatest health benefits to the people of east Ayrshire. It is
also the most convenient for the vast majority of patients and their
families, being at the hub of the local transport system and fairly
equidistant from all landward areas.''
The announcement of the Cumnock site provoked a defiant response from
SAHT. Chief executive Donald McNeill said public support was behind the
Ballochmyle proposal.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley,
said building work already could have started on the new hospital if it
had not been for the bitter row. He blamed the AACHT for causing the
delay by coming up with plans to develop a Cumnock site at the last
minute.
The health board will consider the proposals at a meeting on Thursday.
* THE go-ahead for a #6m, 29-bed hospital for the Uists has been given
by Lord Fraser, Minister of State for Health.
The new hospital at Balivanich, Benbecula, will mean the closure of
the 21-bed Daliburgh Hospital in South Uist, and the 25-bed hospital in
Lochmaddy, North Uist. The Balivanich Clinic also will close.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley strongly defended the Government's
health policies yesterday in what was widely regarded as possibly her
last speech in the job.
Regardless of the outcome of the Tory leadership contest, it is
expected she will be moved to a new post. She will almost certainly be
out if Mr Major wins and has an early reshuffle.
Mrs Bottomley, rejecting a Labour motion in a brief Commons debate,
insisted that the NHS was not a business, was not for profit, and was
not for sale. It would remain a service for all to use, regardless of
their ability to pay.
She said that since NHS trusts had been liberated from the
straitjacket of central control they had increased the number of
patients every year by well over one million.
In addition, since power had been placed in the hands of doctors,
nurses, managers, and staff working in hospitals, waiting times had been
slashed to the shortest ever recorded.
Attacking Labour, Mrs Bottomley said it wanted to take away the
trusts' assets and freedoms, and ''ached to get back to the old regional
health authorities and, with them, their web of committees, bureaucracy,
and grind''.
The Health Secretary was responding to a Labour claim that patients
and health care professionals felt growing alarm at the erosion of the
public service ethos on which the NHS was founded, and rejected the
drive to privatisation.
Labour's health spokesman, Mrs Margaret Beckett, claimed Britain was
faced with a choice between a privatised health service under the Tories
or a modernised one under Labour.
She said: ''We do not seek to turn back the clock, but we do not
suggest that the NHS can possibly stay as it is or head in the direction
it is going -- towards privatisation.
''The British people can choose a truly national health service,
available to all on the basis of need rather than ability to pay, or a
fragmented collection of health businesses, increasingly driven by the
interests of commerce.''
She said there was no choice for the Tories in the leadership contest.
While contender John Redwood could see when the Government was
mishandling health issues, he shared the objective of privatisation and
would undertake it ''more quickly and more ruthlessly''.
Mrs Bottomley, commenting on proposed changes to night work for GPs
over which doctors have threatened to ballot on industrial action, said
the Government's offer would mean an extra #800-a-year for the typical
doctor for an average of six night visits a month.
''There can be no excuse for family doctors taking any action that
damaged patients.'' But she added: ''I am sympathetic to their concerns
and the concern they've raised about the extent to which we need to
remind the public of the importance of using the service responsibly,
not calling out GPs inappropriately, keeping their appointments, and
supporting health staff in their work.''
She also said the Government planned to make GPs' lives easier by
cutting paperwork, adding: ''We'll spell out shortly the details of what
we plan. I can, however, announce today that an estimated 15 million
forms a year will go.''
Labour's motion was defeated by 288 votes to 218. An amendment
welcoming ''the Government's commitment to a strong and stable publicly
funded NHS'' was carried without a vote.

FIFE and the West of Scotland are to be linked directly by rail for
the first time in more than 20 years, ScotRail announced yesterday.
Its director, Mr John Ellis, indicated a new service between
Dunfermline and Glasgow could be included in timetables drawn up within
the next few weeks.
Initially, there would be one service in each direction each day on an
experimental basis, probably at rush-hour times, but if the demand is
there it seems likely the link will be extended.
Mr Ellis told a transport conference at North Queensferry, held by
Fife Regional Council, that he was sure there was a demand for such a
service.
The line would split at Dalmeny after crossing the rail bridge and
passengers would head west instead of travelling as at present into
Edinburgh for a connection.
The announcement of an ''imminent'' direct link was welcomed by Mr
John MacDougall, leader of Fife region's Labour administration.
''That is welcome news because the rail link from Fife has been
abysmal and has often been a nightmare,'' he said.
The conference on the future of rail transport in the East of Scotland
also heard a senior official of Railtrack Scotland, owners of the
railway network, describe the appearance of the Forth Rail Bridge as
''pretty disgusting''.
''It is piebald and is not the way we want a national monument kept,''
said Fiona Campbell, public affairs manager.
The condition of the bridge in the past year has been attacked from
many sides, including local residents.
Its state has been raised in the House of Commons and, in view of the
public debate, the Government has asked the Health and Safety Executive
to carry out an assessment of the bridge. The results are expected later
this year.
Miss Campbell said that as well as continuing to spend #1m a year on
maintenance, half of which goes on painting, #4m had also been invested
in renewing the weighbeams.
She said it was believed an independent trust could play a significant
role in enhancing the look of the structure.
Mr Ellis had earlier told the conference he did not share the view
there was any ''physical condition problem'' with the Forth or Tay rail
bridges.
He also told Grampian Councillor George Barnes, chairman of the
Campaign for Rail Electrification, Aberdeen to Edinburgh, that rather
than electrification it would be better if ways of investing in the
infrastructure and improving journey times were examined.
* Scottish Liberal Democrats yesterday appealed for a rethink on cuts
in rail services, writes Christopher Holme.
Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, said the draft
public service requirement (PSR) for ScotRail by the regulatory body
Opraf marked a betrayal of Government pledges and would mean service
cuts.
''Opraf has a responsibility to provide services which meet the whole
of Scotland's needs, not just the needs of the private investor,'' he
said.
He called for a reversal of the decision to axe Motorail, creation of
a separate Scottish franchising office, and services to be provided at
the 1994 level, in line with the pledge made by Transport Minister Roger
Freeman.

THE cost of farm thefts in Scotland rose by 45% last year, the biggest
increase in the UK, according to figures released by NFU Mutual, the
insurance arm of the National Farmers' Union, writes ROBERT ROSS.
The value of claims in Scotland went up from #120,000 to #170,000,
mostly for machinery but excluding vehicle thefts. Livestock rustling
continued to be a problem, accounting for 25% of theft claims.
Loss control manager Pamela Oldfield, said the majority of claims were
for items which opportunist thieves could take away in a car or van. One
victim last year had his all-terrain vehicle stolen but the thieves also
used his pick-up truck to transport it. The pick-up was recovered in a
pub car park.
Farmers are warned to remove and secure cars and tractors when they
are left unattended, even around the farm and at auction markets.
Failure to do so can negate the insurance cover.
From its own claims experience NFU Mutual estimates that farm theft
costs UK farmers and growers about #28m a year.
The high levels of security which were now commonplace in urban
businesses and homes had led professional thieves to target rural areas,
said Mrs Oldfield. Tools and smaller pieces of equipment could very
quickly disappear without trace through the mushrooming car boot sale
syndrome. In some instances, she said, it was believed that equipment
was being stolen to order.
Mutual was advising farmers and country dwellers to continue
increasing security measures on their farms and to participate in
Farmwatch schemes.

SIR David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union of England
and Wales, has expressed strong fears about the future of the European
Union's Common Agricultural Policy. Speaking at the Royal Show at
Stoneleigh yesterday, he condemned new arrangements agreed at the recent
EU ministerial summit in Brussels.
In spite of the efforts of UK Agriculture Minister, William
Waldegrave, to prevent the package being approved, a late concession was
made. The NFU is concerned that if the pound was to strengthen in the
coming months, and the UK green rate was revalued, both CAP compensation
payments and support prices would be cut. Until that revaluation
exceeded recent devaluations (about 11%) no compensation would be
forthcoming.
''This is totally unjustified and could represent a first step towards
re-nationalising the CAP,'' said Sir David. ''The Ministers must have a
rethink about the divisiveness this could cause among EU member
states.''
Sir David admitted that one of his fears about effective
re-nationalisation would be the expected difficulty in extracting money
from the Treasury.
With the implementation of the new GATT agreement it was vital that
the EU should be able to compete fairly in the increasingly competitive
world market, he said. He supported the principle of an single European
currency. In the long term there was no alternative if the single market
was to become a truly effective reality, he argued. ''It surely makes
sense to have a single currency -- but only when there are sound
economic conditions for doing so.''
Sir David underlined the importance of Britain playing its full part
in Brussels decision-making. ''Of course there are proposals which must
be challenged and re-shaped but we cannot afford the luxury of picking
and choosing from the menu put before us.''
Mr Waldegrave, who opened the show, forecast big changes for farming
over the next 15 to 20 years. The farming and food industries were going
to become steadily more international and steadily more open, he said.
The implementation of GATT and the widening of the EU would reform all
existing structures.
''We do need a CAP -- but one which better reflects the interests of
the more efficient and forward-looking farmers and is less based on
controls and limitations. It means moving back closer to the market --
in which British agriculture survived for so long.'' He stipulated that
such a move would have to be achieved in good order and with plenty of
warning.
Mr Waldegrave did not support the idea that a single currency was
essential for the regulation of the single market. ''The steps we have
taken to limit the wild fluctuations of the green currency will, we
hope, remove some of the distortions we have seen emerging,'' he said.

ROB ADAMS reports on the return of the Crusaders as they invoke the
spirit of ground-breaking days.
AS WAYNE Henderson said: ''I was the one who persuaded the rest of
them to drop the word 'jazz'. Now I'm bringing it back. There's nothing
to be afraid of any more. Jazz is happening and the time is now for the
Jazz Crusaders.''
Back at the turn of the 1970s, the time was anything but now for the
Jazz Crusaders. Jazz was not an ''in'' word. When they dropped it, they
almost immediately started selling albums by the quarter million -- and
more.
They may have compromised their name but they didn't compromise their
musical standards. You only have to play the recent compilation, Soul
Shadows, to hear how well tracks from the mid-1970s such as Henderson's
irresistible, swamp rock-infused Stomp and Buck Dance have stood up --
and to realise how brave the Rolling Stones were to invite the Crusaders
to support them on their 1975 world tour.
Later, Streetlife, the top-10 song which introduced Randy Crawford to
the world, would signal a decline into rather less vibrant spheres which
culminated with 1991's Healing the Wounds album. But it's the spirit of
earlier times that trombonist Henderson and tenor saxophonist Wilton
Felder are invoking as they recreate a trademark frontline sound that
began to take shape one afternoon in Houston, Texas, back in 1949.
Henderson, Felder, pianist Joe Sample and drummer Nesbert ''Stix''
Hooper were to play together for the next 25 years.
At high school they metamorphosed into the Modern Jazz Sextet (by this
time they had met flautist Hubert Laws, who along with his saxophonist
brother Ronnie, flits in and out of the Crusaders' orbit to this day)
and worked with local blues musicians such as Bobby Bland, Percy
Mayfield, Little Willie John and Joe Tex.
In 1958 they moved to California via Las Vegas, where as the Rhythm &amp;
Blues-styled Nite Hawks they were offered enough cabaret work to last
them five years, an offer they emphatically declined.
In California they became the Jazz Crusaders (''we wanted a name with
a cause'') and recorded their first two albums. But, to stay solvent, on
occasion they had to recreate the Nite Hawks and reheat the R&amp;B. It was
only when they merged the two styles, adding their gospel roots, and as
Henderson says ''we started fusion'', that things really took off.
Dropping Jazz from their name took them to a wider audience as
category-conscious radio stations began to play their records on soul
and R&amp;B shows. Enlisting guitarist Larry Carlton as a full-time member
for 1974's Southern Comfort album took them on to rock shows, too.
Carlton is a veteran of many a recording session -- especially for
Steely Dan -- as by 1976 were Felder, Sample and Hooper (Henderson at
the time preferred to keep his sound unique to the Crusaders), and
listening to Spiral from the Those Southern Knights album, with Pops
Popwell on bass, it sounds like the Crusaders, fed up waiting for the
Dans Fagen and Becker to arrive, had simply started without them.
Henderson left to concentrate on record production and didn't pick up
the trombone again over the next 15 years. ''I was running eight or nine
independent record companies and was too busy dealing with attorneys and
accountants. Then one day in 1991 I thought, I'm not having any fun any
more. So I called up Wilton and said, 'Hey, let's hit it'.''
They ''hit it'' first of all with a band called the Next Crusade. Then
Henderson tried to get all four Crusaders together for a reunion. Due to
business commitments that hasn't happened but it will ''as soon as we
can slow the other two down''.
* The Jazz Crusaders play McEwan's Old Fruitmarket, Glasgow tonight at
7.30.

SCOTLAND's chartered accountants have called for major reforms in
audit regulation, insisting that the current self regulation system is
widely perceived to be unsatisfactory, writes ALAN HUNTER.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said that in the
public interest, radical reform was necessary, and proposed the
formation of a new organisation to take on an independent role in the
conduct of supervision, monitoring and discipline of its members.
In a paper published today, the institute takes the view that an
impartial mechanism is required, designed to provide clear and plausible
demonstration and enforcement of high standards of service in the public
interest.
The institute's convener of its self regulating working party, James
Gemmell said the mechanism for delivering an independent oversight
should be chaired by a board and composed of a panel nominated by the
Department of Trade and Industry, the Bank of England, the London Stock
Exchange, and other interests.
Mr Gemmell said that a central part of the organisatiom's activities
would be in monitoring audit firms, explaining that it should be
directly responsible for the pro-active quality assurance monitoring of
the auditors.

Jazz
SOMETIMES, as the familiar introduction sounds, the heart sinks. Not
more Autumn Leaves, it says. Not another My Foolish Heart. I'm Body and
Souled out. That's when someone like Mulgrew Miller proves his worth.
All three of these overworked standards the former Jazz Messengers'
pianist played round midnight on Sunday, and not one of them sounded
tired. Emotional, yes; but tired, no.
My Foolish Heart he tugged every which way, with bassist Richie Goods
and drummer Erin Walker with him on every step. Sometimes he'd let a
phrase unfold as if he had all night to resolve it (and the audience
might well have been happy to let him do so), then with a kick of
Walker's bass drum, a crack of his snare, they were off on more urgent
business.
But however much they reworked that tune, however fresh their
reinventions, you knew you were listening to musicians who'd followed
the golden rule about playing ballads: first, learn the words.
There may or may not be lyrics to Miller's own tunes, and the titles
may or may not be a guide. No matter, what Farewell to Dogma in effect
said was: ''I can do rhapsodic but I don't do overblown.'' He can also
hide a big number in the most delicate of intros.
As for When I Get There, they got there, pretty directly, which is how
it should be with a blues. Both Miller and the slippery-fingered Goods
soloed on this one with such feeling that it was as if they, like
Walker, came from Memphis and had learned their trade on Beale Street.

SEVENTY jobs in the dairy industry are to go with the closure of the
former Co-op milk processing plant in Titwood Road on the South Side of
Glasgow, it was announced yesterday.
The owners, Robert Wiseman Dairies, which took over the bulk of the
Co-op's Scottish liquid milk operations last month for #6.6m, made the
decision after assuming control of the dairy on Saturday.
Wiseman Dairies said the 50 year-old Co-op creamery, in a residential
area, had outlived its utility and had attracted noise complaints from
residents.
Managing director Robert Wiseman said: ''Unfortunately this creamery
does not meet the high standards our customers demand of our processing
facilities. We regret these redundancies and wherever possible we will
try to offer jobs for staff in our other dairy or distribution
facilities.''
The union Usdaw called the decision ''disappointing and premature''.

YOUR ball lies just inside the boundary of a lateral water hazard and
you decide to play it as it lies. Within a club-length of the ball but
outside the hazard is an acorn which you remove. A few seconds later,
before address, your ball take a half-roll backwards.
''That's a penalty shot under Rule 18-2c,'' says a fellow-competitor
brandishing the Rules of Golf before your eyes, ''and you must replace
the ball.''
Is he right?
NO. He's right that a penalty shot is due if you move a loose
impediment within a club-length of the ball and the ball then moves
irrespective of whether removal of the acorn (a loose impediment) was
the direct cause of the ball's movement. But that is through the green
and Rule 18-2c is not applicable here because the ball is in a hazard.
Decision 18-2c/4 says that a penalty is incurred only if the player
caused the ball to move and that would be under Rule 18-2a. Otherwise,
you play it as it lies without penalty.
The removal of loose impediments in the hazard is, of course,
forbidden under Rule 13-4, but there is nothing to prevent moving those
on the outside.

* This week's tip comes from GORDON CLARKE, the professional at East
Renfrewshire Golf Club.
PIVOTING -- as opposed to sliding -- the hips is the way to initiate
the start of the backswing. This will lead to a correct turn of the hips
(45 degrees), and the shoulders (90 degrees), and puts the player in the
proper position to unwind.
But to be able to produce the pivoting action, it is vital that the
player is set up correctly. With the knees flexed, tilt forward from the
hips. A good thought is that the feet hold the knees, the knees hold the
hips, and the hips hold the back -- everything should be together.
The arms should be in what I call the 'gorilla' position -- hanging
down and free to swing like a pendulum. Too many players make the
mistake of stretching the arms out in front of the body in a very tense
position.
From the correct set-up, the body will form an axle around which the
hips can pivot, and the shoulders can make a full turn.
As with learning to drive, everything will feel very strange at first.
But, once you've been driving for a few years, it all becomes automatic.
It is the same with golf. The set-up and swing must become automatic. To
achieve this happy position, you will need to play around three times a
week. Regular spells on the practice ground will also help.

Acting is a precariousway to earn a living but, as Sara Villiers
reports, graduates are willing to make sacrifices
''FOR an actress to be a success she must have the face of Venus, the
brains of Minerva, the grace of Terpsichore, the memory of Macauley, the
figure of Juno and the hide of a rhinoceros.''
ETHEL Barrymore's dictum from the fifties still holds true today,
although the thesp of the nineties will also have to have the business
accumen of Anita Roddick and the PR skills of Lynn Franks.
Twenty-five-year-old Tracey Wiles, who is about to graduate with the
RSAMD's Diploma in Dramatic Art, has spent the past few weeks of her
course firing missives off to agents and directors across the country.
She's just stuck the stamp on her 128th envelope.
It's a dog-eat-dog world for graduates of any discipline but the
aspiring actor faces particularly grim odds. Equity, the actor's union,
estimates that at any time four out of five of its members are out of
work.
This scarey statistic doesn't deter Wiles or her fellow graduates from
their chosen profession. With grim determination they have known what
they were letting themselves in for from the moment they applied for the
course.
The competitiveness of the business is reflected in the audition
process for the course, with a place for only one out of every 16
applicants. Only the most committed make it to the final 22. ''By the
time you get to the last round of interviews you're pretty aware of the
risks,'' says Emily Hanrahan, 27.
''The principal spelt out exactly what happens, like the high divorce
and unemployment rates, and the fact that it can be a very unfulfilling
career because you can spend so much time out of work,'' she says. ''He
told us only about 5% of actors make it 'big', that you have to live
like a gypsy and you have problems getting car insurance or a mortgage.
We knew what we were letting ourselves in for.''
Meg Fraser, 25, shrugs off the depressing facts. ''You study acting
because you love it so much that you don't care about all of that,
you'll do it whether you make a living or not.''
Billy Mack, 32, agrees: ''The feeling you get in your guts when
something works, I can't describe it, its simply orgasmic.''
Such fervent devotion to craft is common but the graduates recognise
the need for pragmatism too. All agree that the most useful strand of
the diploma was the professional practice course, where directors and
agents visited the academy to pass on practical hints to the students,
from a casting agent advising they should ditch their favoured
''grungey'' images for a blander, smarter look, to Liz Lochhead warning
of the perils of wearing too much make-up and suggesting they should
polish their shoes before auditions.
''She told me to buy some new boots,'' smiles Fraser, showing off her
gleaming footwear. She has taken the professional advice to heart,
favouring a fresh-faced look and wearing a simple cream skirt and top to
interviews. The result is simple yet striking as Fraser possesses a
glacial poise not dissimilar to that of Tilda Swinton, an actress whose
face is the perfect blank canvas, easily transformed into diverse
personnas, as she demonstrated so effectively in Orlando.
After a polished performance in the annual diploma showcase Fraser has
been the object of keen interest from the theatre and television world.
She's now in the fortunate postion of considering offers and is
confident of being in paid work over the summer. Wiles is also
guaranteed of employment, having won the national Carleton-hobbs BBC
Radio Drama Award for Best Student Actress, with a six-month contract
with the Beeb.
Jayne McKenna, 23, who featured in the Arches Theatre Company's
Chekhov comedy bill during Mayfest, is set to continue her studies after
a momentous meeting with Glenn Close in New York, when the star of
Sunset Boulevard allowed McKenna to visit her in her dressing room after
the Broadway show. ''She advised me to go to the Strasbourg Studio in
New York, and I've been accepted and will be going in either the
September or January intake.''
Hanrahan, Mack and Russell Watters, 26, have nothing firm set up as
yet and are prepared for a sojourn on the dole while they pursue work.
Watters wants to break into televison roles but is resigned to spending
a lot of time watching it instead. But, like the others, his enthusiasm
and optimism are undimmed and he is far-sighted about the future: ''The
acting profession is not a sprint, it's a marathon,'' he says.
Graham Greene believes that ''for an actor success is simply delayed
failure.'' Watters considers the life of insecurity and overdrafts ahead
for him and his collegues: ''There must be something with us,'' he
grins.

LOSSES at British Biotechnology expanded to #26.3m from #21.5m last
year, news of which sent the shares down by 2p to 497p. The increased
loss was largely a result of additional investment in product
development as the company's products undergo clinical trials.
Five separate compounds were tested during the year and a significant
programme of clinical studies was started in the USA, the world's
largest pharmaceutical market.
Capital expenditure was #7.2m, a higher figure than normal due
principally to expenditure of #3.8m on the construction of new chemical
development facilities. However, the balance sheet remained strong with
#42m in cash and short term investments. There is no dividend for the
year.

FRANK Ferris discovered a rare consistency in the June Medal at East
Kilbride to card a net 59 which converts to a Parbusters score of -12,
making him a clear bandit of the week.
The 17-handicap businessman who has been working hard on his game in
recent years tallied no fewer than 13 pars in his unprecedented gross 76
over the course, which was playing short but to fast greens which were
difficult to hold.
There was just one blip, at the 437-yard eleventh, where he ran up a
triple-bogey 7, but a birdie at the par-4 fifteenth helped to repair the
damage and he parred in from there to earn a handicap reduction to 13.
His score puts him in overall joint-third place in the men's handicap
standings and with only six more weeks of Parbusters to go that gives
him a good chance of qualifying for the final. This week's leading
scores:

HUMILITY, not always considered a virtue in today's cut-throat world
of business, was one of the qualities which helped Rutherglen-based
Sanmex International lift The Herald and accountancy firm Ernst &amp;
Young's 1995 TrailBlazers award yesterday.
Sanmex learnt it had beaten off fierce competition from other monthly
TrailBlazers' winners at a lunch in the Victorian confines of Glasgow's
Clydeport Building.
The family-owned company, which grew up in the 1930s providing
janitorial supplies to Glasgow's cinemas and hospitals, was in something
of a rut five years ago.
Its traditional markets were in decline but, unlike some other family
companies, it took radical action to ensure it did not end up as
takeover fodder or, even worse, in the hands of the receiver.
Between 1990 and 1993, the manufacturer and seller of detergents,
disinfectants, toiletries and aerosol products doubled its turnover to
#11.2m.
With sales expected to top #14m this year and approach #18m next year,
Sanmex, with about 185 employees, is looking at a partial flotation.
Chairman and managing director Allan Groden is currently weighing up
the options, which include the recently-launched Alternative Investment
Market.
Ray Perman, development director of The Herald's publisher, Caledonian
Newspapers, commended Sanmex for realising in time that their markets
had changed.
He said: ''They went out and got help in assessing the situation and
coming up with a strategy. That shows humility, which is an underrated
business virtue.''
Sanmex's rise was assisted by the advent of the deep-discount
supermarket, with the company supplying own-label products to the likes
of German group Aldi, Danish company Netto, and Shoprite.
Sales director Norman Ferguson believes Kwik Save, which picked up the
pieces of Shoprite's failed Scottish invasion, is one customer which
will help sustain the momentum of Sanmex's impressive sales growth.
Kwik Save, which is converting about 80 former Shoprite stores in
Scotland to its own format, is looking for another 75-plus sites north
of the Border.
Sanmex, which also makes products for the likes of Tesco, exports to
between 25 and 30 countries.
Its fly sprays are much in demand in China, while, in the Middle East,
kaftan-wearers find relief in Sanmex's de-static product. Eastern Europe
and the Caribbean are among Sanmex's other markets.
Taking washing-up liquid, the Rutherglen-based company can ''blow''
the plastic bottle, print it and fill it, all under the one roof.
Judges believed Sanmex had five out of the six TrailBlazer qualities.
Its business performance, product and service quality, management
calibre, marketing flair, and contribution to the local and Scottish
economy were commended.
Dr Groden's troubleshooting son, Steven, will now be sent on a
specialist management training course run by the prestigious
Boston-based Harvard Business School, courtesy of TrailBlazers.

Jazz
THE word in the loo was that this was going to be difficult. Well, it
was and it wasn't. It wasn't difficult to listen to, far from it. Where
the difficulty lay, and a lot of the fun come to that, was in
identifying the tunes.
Jazz musicians are fond of quoting tunes in their solos. Usually they
are not the tunes they happen to be playing. Here, the tactic was to
throw in a brief quote by way of a clue somewhere, maybe in the bass
solo, maybe at the end of the tenor solo. Was that How Deep is the
Ocean? And wasn't that the Folks Who Live On the Hill? Perhaps we'll
never know.
As time went on they seemed to make it easier. Someone to Watch Over
Me was a cinch -- because they announced it, and played by Paul Motian
on drums, Joe Lovano (tenor) and Bill Frisell (guitar), it was simply
gorgeous. It was dry and sketchy as regards the melody, but Frisell's
lachrymose tone, even in deconstruct mode, is a joy to behold.
His duet with Lee Konitz on alto also produced many moments of cool
magic. Later, as bassist Marc Johnson provided a typically firm root,
Konitz and Lovano essayed a slightly swaying My Heart Belongs to Daddy,
whose melody Motian openly made the basis for his solo.
They encored with I Got Rhythm, not perhaps the most literal reading
but one easily recognisable and full of vigour and humour, with Konitz
and Lovano by turns duetting and duelling and Motian sitting quietly in
the driving seat for a fascinating and highly musical excursion.

JOHN Young, who has been posted virtually absent from the national
amateur scene for 30 years, makes his return today in the Scottish
Seniors' championship at the Killermont home of Glasgow Golf Club
bidding for a unique treble.
The Cathcart Castle player, who turned 55 in November and is thus
eligible for the tournament for the first time, won the Scottish Boys'
championship at North Berwick in 1957 and three years later claimed the
Scottish Amateur championship at Carnoustie.
Then aged 20, he was, at the time, the youngest winner of the amateur
crown.
No-one has won these two plus the seniors' title, and Young says he
will be giving it his best shot starting at 8 o'clock this morning in
the first group out.
''I have been looking forward to senior golf for a few years and I
will not be there just to make up the numbers,'' said Young, whose
national record ended in 1965 with his last game for Scotland. ''I will
certainly be trying and I feel I have as good a chance as anybody.''
However, he is aware it is a long time since his competitive juices
were flowing freely -- although he has won his club championship in four
decades up to the 1980s and remains hopeful of making it five -- and his
shot-making also is a little rusty.
''I don't think I have lost any length, but I am not as consistent as
I used to be and I find putting hard nowadays, particularly from four or
five feet,'' confessed the now five-handicapper. ''I have a
centre-shafted putter and sometimes from that range I will turn round
and play-left handed.''
That might sound a desperate measure, but it is, after all, one of the
seven putting methods which Bernhard Langer has tallied so far.
''I also will be looking forward to renewing past friendships. My time
between 1957 and 1965 was not a long one and I am not sure who is still
around, but Charlie Green is one of them,'' he said. ''Charlie was a
late starter and never won the Scottish Boys, so this treble is one
record that's beyond him.''

JOHN Menzies, chairman of the newsagent chain which bears his name,
yesterday announced encouraging figures and a big rise in dividends, in
sharp contrast to the recent profits warning from arch rival W H Smith.
The payout to shareholders is raised 12% to 13.2p after a final of
8.6p and the group points out that this dividend total is covered over
three times by earnings per share. Profits in the year to April rose 11%
to #38.1m despite the difficult trading climate to which Smiths has so
dramatically drawn attention.
Mr Menzies is confident the trend will continue, saying he is sure the
record of consistent profit growth will be maintained.
The profits gain came largely from an improvement in margins as sales
were only 2% up at #1258m. On such a large turnover it only requires
margins to be tweaked higher to send profits ahead.
Wholesaling and distribution raised trading profits by 9% to #26.2m on
a 1.5% gain in turnover which was depressed by the newspaper price war.
The new code of practice for the industry which followed a Monopolies
and Mergers Commission inquiry increased Menzies's customer base through
enabling retailers to choose their wholesaler so long as they provided a
minimum amount of business. But overall volume of newspapers and
magazines was static.
The industry shake-up was reflected in changes in the distribution
network, with investment of #14m including six branch locations,
upgrading computer systems, and a major new head office in Edinburgh.
More branch mergers and relocations are planned to create larger units
to maximise economies of scale.
The Universal Office Supplies business did well behind a big increase
in contract stationery sales, while AMI, the wholesale express air
courier company achieved a turnround in results.
The retail side, mainly the 270 Menzies outlets, managed also to raise
margins, with a 12% rise in profits to #12.5m coming on a 3.5% rise in
sales, which were affected by the growth of newspaper sales through
superstores. The company was able to deal with price deflation in many
lines. Christmas was satisfactory but the market remains tough, in
common with the retailing scene generally. The portfolio is being
reshaped to some extent through relocation and refitting. Sales growth
came largely from an expansion of Early Learning Centre's chain of
larger stores.
Capital spending in retail came to #18m, with nine new Early Learning
stores and 11 Menzies outlets. Another 11 larger stores are planned this
year and new formats are being tried.
Overseas, Menzies has developments in hand such as its 37% stake in
Funsoft, Germany's leading distributor and publisher of CD-Roms, and a
new joint company with Holland's biggest office supplies business to
create the third largest office contract stationery business in Europe.
These are markets which are expected to become dominated by leading
players and Menzies aims to be one. It has also taken a quarter share in
Gremlin, a UK software publisher.
In total the group has spent #57m with all but #18m of this funded
from cash flow. Mr Menzies believes this spending will strengthen their
competitive position and enhance growth prospects. Up 8p at 581p,
Menzies shares sell at 13 tims earnings and yield 2.8%.

THE farming industry should be subject to controls on the amount of
phosphates applied to the land, according to a leading member of the
Forth River Purification Board.
Speaking yesterday in Kinross at the launch of the Loch Leven
Catchment Management Project, Iain Mackenzie said: ''There should
certainly be a phosphate sensitive zones and we already have one in the
River Almond valley.
''However, I think we should go further. I am a great believer in
talking to people to try to get agreement. But no matter how much
agreement we have there is always a need for it to be backed up by
legislation.''
Mr Mackenzie said phosphates from farming and forestry are a major
cause of algal blooms in Scotland's rivers and lochs.
He added: ''I think European Union legislation would give us extra
powers . . . but I know farmers are not too keen on extra legislation.''
The Loch Leven Project has seen around #5m invested in a variety of
measures including upgraded sewerage treatment to improve water quality
in the loch.
Douglas Flint, who is in charge at Loch Leven, is seeking the
co-operation of farmers.
He said: ''Nitrate sensitive zones have been very controversial and
we're definitely not looking for something similar for phosphates. We
favour the co-operative approach both with farmers and forestry.''

THEY came with spotted hankies on their heads, sporting hooped
t-shirts and eye-patches. And that was just the adults. Full-marks to
one woman on crutches who had a parrot on her shoulder. As for the
youngsters, with their trousers tucked into wellies and plastic swords
flailing in all directions, their uniformity and belligerence made them
a fearsome audience.
The Singing Kettle know their public too well to fail to deliver,
however. It's tempting to conclude that it is the realisation of the
growing competition in the children's theatre market (from the Happy
Gang and other more play-based companies) that has made this show a
success.
It is basically the formula as before (summer panto in fact) -- those
familiar elements the group's success is built on. But here the
production values are high, most of the songs new and thoughtfully
arranged, and the addition of a fourth member, Jane, to the trio of
Cilla, Artie, and Gary gives them even more claim to be Scotland's pre-
and primary school Abba.
As Malcolm McLaren and Adam Ant well knew when I was an overgrown
nipper, you can't go wrong with pirates (unless you are Steven
Speilberg). I may mourn the loss of the Scots flavour to Singing Kettle
shows -- the accents here are more bad Devon -- but at least the subject
matter of this one is a perennial favourite with children thanks to
Robert Louis Stevenson and J M Barrie. Not that any of the happy punters
at the MacBob cared about that.
* Pirates is in Stirling to Saturday, and the company make their first
appearance at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre next week before touring to
Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Perth.

Jazz
TILL now my life has been strangely incomplete, but Sunday's visit to
the City Cafe Bar has filled the void, and all has been revealed. I was
a Norma Winstone virgin, and now I have been saved.
In an evening of highlights, Raye and De Paul's You Don't Know What
Love Is with a beautiful bossa backing, was outstanding; Winstone's
voice wringing every ounce of heartbreak, while guitarist John
Paracelli's playing reminded us of warmer climes. We could have been in
Rio.
Repeatedly, Winstone displayed her talent for writing lyrics to
well-known tunes. Jimmy Rowles' The Peacocks became A Timeless Place,
notable also for Tony Botelho's sumptuous bass lines. Oregon's The
Glider, with Winstone's own endearingly nonsensical lyrics ''we may be
squares -- who cares'' was where she showed her true vocal prowess.
Unlike other singers, she doesn't gradually reach for notes. Instead she
goes for them head-on and invariably hits the target.
During a ''Brazilian interlude'' we heard some fine ensemble playing
from the band who, although an accomplished outfit, with fine individual
credentials, did at times slip into cafe-samba mode, never pushing
Winstone to places you know she is capable of going. There is no
doubting however the vibraphonic skills of Anthony Kerr. His playing on
Stevie Wonder's Summer Soft being the perfect accompaniment to
Winstone's death-defying skat.
Encoring with Carla Bley's Sing Me Softly Of The Blues, Winstone's
lyric comprised of well-known song titles from bygone days: Fine And
Mellow and Don't Explain, to name but two. I counted 19 before giving
up. Norma's new album is entitled Well Kept Secret. Judging by the
near-capacity audience on Sunday, the word's getting out, and you can
bet she'll be back to capture some more hearts soon.

Music
SPIRITUALISM dominates the work of John Tavener and nowhere is this
more evident than in his contemporary classic for cello and strings The
Protecting Veil. Sunday night's performance by cellist Steven Isserlis
and John Lubbock's Orchestra of St John's, Smith Square was essentially
a moving experience but failed to make the impact capable in such
inspired music.
All of the players were seated in front of the curtain so there was no
problem in hearing the music. Problems lay in the actual execution of
the piece. Isserlis ought to know the piece back to front but, playing
from the score, there were a few too many missed notes, perhaps prompted
in the opening movements, by a lack of confidence in the accompanying
string orchestra.
The pivotal movement is an unaccompanied Lament for solo cello. Here
Isserlis found his form. Dreamy and meditative, time stood still for 10
contemplative minutes of utterly beautiful music. Thereafter, the
orchestra came into their own, finally responding to the elegant
directions from conductor Lubbock.
A former professional singer, Lubbock bore his heart on his sleeve in
a stunning interpretation of Faure's Requiem. Resembling a praying
mantis, well over 6ft tall and very long-limbed, the music breathes
through his every inch, lovingly sculpted and mirrored by his attentive
orchestra and chorus.
Both soprano, Susannah Glanville and baritone William Dazeley
demonstrate a cultivated vocal technique. Glanville's Pie Jesu resounded
like a bell while in the Libera Me, Dazeley's opulent tones were
accompanied by some incredibly accomplished part singing. Supple and
lithe, Faure's vocal lines seldom breathe such ethereal beauty. A
precise translation of the concluding movement found the Festival
Theatre audience In Paradisum.

However, with Microtech having notched up sales of #5.4m last year and

STRATHCLYDE Regional Council closed a Renfrewshire residential home
for the elderly after a one-woman campaign waged against the owner by a
social worker, it was alleged yesterday.
Dr Sohail Chaudhry, who was forced to shut his Caldwell House property
in the midst of neglect allegations last December, is appealing against
the decision to close the home.
At a hearing being heard by Sheriff Principal Robert Hay, which began
at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, the GP said that he had encountered
a ''no-win'' scenario.
He claimed that social worker Mrs Davina Young had single-handedly
waged war on his activities, and added: ''I felt as though I was
protecting my little Bosnia under siege conditions.''
The doctor said that obstacle after obstacle was put in his way as he
struggled to get a licence to open for business. Finally, under extreme
pressure from the bank and after almost #500,000 of expenditure, he was
forced to work day and night to earn some money.
''They made me feel unwelcome. The antagonism was beyond the joke,''
he said. ''At one time, I had to work 14 days and 14 nights without
sleep just to put some money in the bank.''
After he was finally given permission to open the premises, the social
worker continued to apply pressure and he found that the regional
council was not sending him any referrals. In order to find clients, he
had to offer relatives of prospective residents one week's free
accommodation.
He told Sheriff Principal Hay: ''I told her (Mrs Young) that, even if
Florence Nightingale was alive and running this home, she would have
committed suicide.''
Dr Chaudhry claims the home was a happy place with few restrictions
placed upon the residents in his care. They were allowed to go to bed
whenever they chose to retire for the night and were not subjected to
disciplines imposed in other establishments.
He claims the social worker could not accept those practices and
added: ''The resistance I encountered was out of this world. I suppose I
knew, before I even opened, that they would try to close me down.''
The doctor said the various allegations being made against him were
''very damaging'' and he was hoping to answer them and paint a true
picture. ''I owe it to myself, to my wife, to my staff, and to the
residents to put the record straight,'' he said. ''The truth of the
matter is that we had a complaints-box and I only ever received one
complaint -- from a member of staff looking for more money.''
He said he had eventually been forced to sell off a large section of
the estate at Caldwell House, near Lugton, and the house itself in order
to pay debts.
He claimed that Mrs Young had continually blocked the opening of the
premises and frustrated every attempt he made to meet requirements. He
maintained that she was determined to delay the registration.
Even after he had opened up for business, she continued to cause
problems and on one occasion visited the home five times in one day.
Dr Chaudhry said: ''I was running what must have been the most-visited
home in the UK. Every time she appeared, it was stressful for myself,
for staff, and for the residents.''
She would always place the staff under inquisition, he claimed. The
tension became unbearable.
The tribunal continues today.

A SOLID set of results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle yesterday could not
disguise the need for the proposed #425m acquisition of Courage to be
approved by President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine so it can
provide substantial future earnings growth.
And given his own pre-occupations and involvement in non-trade matters
this morning, it is quite probable he will make his decision known today
on the Office of Fair Trading report so as to clear his desk in
anticipation of a Cabinet shuffle after the Tory leadership vote.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle's headline results are good with pre-tax profits
rising 19% to #264m and are perhaps at the better end of most
expectations. Certainly the shares responded positively, rising 5p to
558p where they yield 4.1% on the dividend total increased 7% to 18.23p
with a 12.05p final.
But the current year seems likely to produce a total of just #300m
from the present businesses, excluding anything from Courage, to leave
the shares trading at 13 times possible earnings. Adding Courage to the
S&amp;N group would produce profits of about #325m and a similar price
earnings ratio on the increased number of shares in issue as a result of
the two part rights issue.
Full credit has to be given for the good results from pub retailing
where the #700m purchase of Chef &amp; Brewer in November 1993 has paid off
more quickly than most had anticipated. There is more to come thanks to
further integration of systems and this will boost profitability even
further. The year to April saw a 61% upsurge in operating profits to
#143m and margins from 17% to 19.7%.
That reflects the growing food side of the business and a faster than
expected increase in consumer spending in the south of England where the
majority of the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs are situated. These are seeing
organic growth of about 8%.
The concern is the beer division where profits declined 4.7% despite a
slight rise in turnover and market share. S&amp;N suffers in one respect
because about 85% of volume goes through free trade outlets where
margins are lower than in tied pubs. The group has been less successful
than Whitbread in exploiting brand names. Beck's is the most outstanding
asset in the S&amp;N portfolio that compares with Whitbread's Boddingtons.
There is no sign of supermarket trade margins improving in a sector
which will account for perhaps a third of all beer volumes by the end of
the decade. To that end, overseas sales are being pushed so that they
now account for about 5% of divisional profits with the successful
Newcastle Brown's promotional campaign carrying the message that it
''takes America by the throat.''
Chief executive Brian Stewart argues compellingly that there is no
case for a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission even if
the combined S&amp;N and Courage group accounts for 25% of consumption.
Instead, the merged company would offer more consumer choice in the
pubs. This would fall into line with official policy and S&amp;N would be
able to fight back more effectively against the inroads in the UK market
made by Continental beers.
He pointed out that just 10% of cost is brewing and another 15% is
packging. The remaining 75% is accounted for by distribution, including
marketing whch accounts for perhaps 7% of the overall cost, and that is
where the economies of integration lie without diminishing brand choice.
It is estimated around #40m of annual expense could be taken out of the
combined business.
Whitbread was also trying to buy Courage which would have resulted in
it having a bigger combined market share than S&amp;N and much greater
geographic concentration -- so there is an element of sour grapes in its
protestations to the OFT. It also refused to give Grand Metropolitan
more for Chef &amp; Brewer than S&amp;N eventually paid and also lost out to
Bass for the Prague brewery.
Center Parcs was hit to an unquantifiable extent by the floods in
Holland which dissuaded people from travelling. Overall operating
profits rose 5.8% to #87.9m thanks to a full contribution from Longleat,
the third park in Britain, and growing volumes of business in France.
This month the first German village opens an will provide earnings
momentum in 1996. However, an accelerated rate of opening seems to be
required for subsequent years as the introduction of premium rates for
top of the range chalets is not likely to be a major contributor.
It is tempting to suggest that Center Parcs should be sold -- the
decision to sell Thistle Hotels at the top of the market to fund Center
Parcs was extremely astute and while it may the the jewel in the crown,
fashions do change. Divisional profits were held back by slow progress
at Pontins where a management buyout could be one solution.
While there is no really good reason why the Courage deal should be
referred -- more is known officially about the brewing industry than any
other -- the danger is that there may be approval requirements that
knock the stuffing out of the merger strategy where the beneficiaries
will be the other big brewers and them alone. That would be most
unsatisfactory for the consumer and the S&amp;N shareholder.

SHARES in Ivory &amp; Sime lost about 5% yesterday, after the
Edinburgh-based fund management group announced a 4.2% fall in annual
pre-tax profits to #5.93m.
Chairman David Newbigging, who has taken a top job in the Lloyd's of
London insurance market, will be succeeded by Sir David Kinloch, deputy
chief executive of London-based Caledonia Investments. Sir David joined
the board last September after Caledonia took a 29.9% stake.
Ivory &amp; Sime also announced the acquisition, for #6.85m, of the entire
share capital of the investment trust-focused Clan Asset Management,
which manages funds of #240.5m and is 75%-owned by Caledonia.
After a final payout of 5.25p, Ivory &amp; Sime's total dividend for the
year to end-April is unchanged at 7.50p, giving a yield of 4.7%.
The purchase of Clan, subject to shareholder approval, will augment
Ivory &amp; Sime's funds under management, which fell from #3800m to #3100m
during the year.
Ivory &amp; Sime lost more than #150m of funds with the departure of the
US Parkstone account. This followed financial services group First of
America's purchase of a fund management group in the States, to which
the Parkstone funds were transferred.
The troubles encountered by the Japanese and emerging stock markets
also took their toll on funds under management.
Ivory &amp; Sime's managing director, Colin Hook, was unperturbed by the
10[1/2]p drop in the group's share price, to 199p, pointing out that
other fund management companies had suffered worse.
There were major changes at Ivory &amp; Sime last year, with a boardroom
shake-up and the highly-publicised restructuring of the group's flagship
British Assets and related Investors Capital investment trusts.
Although the full impact of the loss of the Parkstone account will be
felt this year, and Ivory &amp; Sime will not derive a full year's benefit
from the Clan acquisition, Mr Hook believes Ivory &amp; Sime is on the right
road.
He said: ''We are not unhappy with last year. We know where we want to
go and we are following through, we hope, a carefully thought-out plan.
''We are very confident we are going to have success in achieving the
goals we set ourselves.''
The departure of Mr Newbigging after Ivory &amp; Sime's forthcoming annual
meeting on September 1, following eight years with the group, is the
result of his appointment as chairman-designate of Equitas, the major
reinsurance company which is part of Lloyd's of London's reorganisation
plans.
Clan's funds under management include two investment trusts, British
Empire Securities and General Trust, and French Property Trust.
Although Ivory &amp; Sime has not clearly identified any further
acquisition targets, Mr Hook said there were a number of things which,
given the opportunity, Ivory &amp; Sime would love to pursue.
Aided by a lower tax charge, Ivory &amp; Sime's earnings per share edged
up from 12.87p to 12.95p.
* BRITISH Assets Trust also announced the appointment of a new
chairman yesterday. William Thomson, who has served on the board for 21
years, has taken over from Roger Inglis, who is retiring.

THERE was further confirmation yesterday that consumer spending is not
falling off the cliff. Consumers are continuing to borrow money for
almost anything except housing and notes and coins in circulation are
growing steadily.
But the latest Purchasing Managers' survey suggests that weaker
domestic demand is holding back growth in the manufacturing sector.
Price pressures, however, are at their second highest level on record.
Net mortgage lending is sharply lower than a year ago, and the Halifax
and Nationwide Building Societies reported further drops in house prices
last month.
Net credit rose from #528m in April to #584m with credit card lending
jumping from #156m to #238m. Lending by banks was also #38m better at
#418m, with specialist lending only #5m higher at #141m.
By contrast mortgage business remains in the doldrums. Lending by
banks and building societies edged up from #1252m in April to #1280m,
but was still 15% lower than a year ago.
However, new commitments rebounded from #4229m to #4707m, little
changed from May 1994. The Halifax's seasonally adjusted house price
index fell by 0.4% in June and was 1.9% lower than a year earlier. The
Nationwide's unadjusted index showed a monthly fall of 1.8% and a
year-on-year decline of 0.3%.
The Halifax said house prices were now unlikely to show any increase
this year, and even a modest recovery next year was uncertain. It again
called for specific measures to stimulate demand.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ''While mortgage borrowing remains
chronically depressed, borrowing for consumption is surging with few
signs that consumers have lost their appetite for debt despite three
rises in base rates.''
Without a significant change in Government policy it was unlikely that
the housing market would pull out of the vicious cricle of falling
prices and volumes in the near term.
M0 grew by 0.5% last month, but the annual rate of growth fell back
from 5.9% to 5.7%, still above City expectations. Notes and coins on
their own, excluding the largely irrelevant bankers' balances, continued
to outpace M0 with year-on-year growth of 6%, down from 6.2% in May.
The figures continue to point to a steady, if unspectacular, recovery
in consumer spending in the second quarter. Both Treasury and
independent forecasters are agreed that consumer spending is likely to
pick up over the next two years.
The seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index, which measures
manufacturing activity, fell slightly from 52.0 in May to 51.9. Activity
has expanded for 31 months, but the June index was the lowest since
December 1993.
Peter Thomson, director-general of the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply, which compiles the index, said: ''Weakening
demand from UK markets continues to clip the growth of the manufacturing
economy. For the first time this year production has exceeded demand.''
The seasonally adjusted prices index rose from 75.5 in May to 77.0,
its second highest reading since the survey began four years ago.
The institute said reports of suppliers passing on higher prices for
raw materials and manufactured inputs due to tightness of supply were
again common. The highest prices were recorded in the consumer goods
industries.
There was nothing in the raft of data published yesterday to influence
the outcome of tommorrow's meeting between the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England.

WHAT a sheer delight to open The Herald and see Chris Evert's lovely
face smiling out from the page (June 30).
How true that your sports writer should comment, ''Evert was one of
the most graceful champions in the game's history''. I would go one step
further and say she was the most gracious champion.
I can never forget the day when, after a valiant fight, she lost to
the legendary Navratilova. How did they finish up? In each other's arms;
a generous cuddle. That was Chris -- no resentment, no grudge, and
Martina was to remain a close friend even after the many defeats Chris
suffered.
It's lovely to know that after two marriages that didn't ''take'' she
is now a family woman with two dear boys of her own.
We wish her long life and happiness and congratulations on her honour
in the International Tennis Hall of Fame later this month.

HAVING read all the contentious letters on religion and the mosquing
of the council, I am even more glad to be a Spiritualist whose simple
philosophy is that it doesn't matter what religion you are but how you
live your life that counts.
We believe in God's teaching (the basis of every religion surely) of
unconditional love. If everyone lived by that, the world would be a very
much better place.
Idealistic? Yes. Workable? Yes. So try it.

DIANTHUS is the Sunday name for carnations. In a common or garden way
some of them just get called pinks. They come in all-sorts of colours --
raspberry, plum, mauve, maroon, darkest crimson. With delicate care are
they named. There is a Jane Austen pink that is small and neat and
single. Of course, it is.
Some have gentry titles. But there is also a bloom called Mrs Sinkins,
a frilly blonde bimbo of a flower, although she was only a workhouse
keeper's wife.
Pinks are universal. So there is a London Lovely. A dark beauty called
Cockenzie has roots deep as three centuries. And there is the Paisley
Gem. Wondrously it has scented the air since 1798.
Once upon a time Paisley was an Eden of flowers all its own, they say.
Mainly, it is in Paisley that they say so. But, yes, it is only the
plain truth that the town's weavers perfected more than 100 fancy
dianthus. Paisley was the pinkest place in the land. Now only the Gem
remains. It is the very last one.
Three of this rare breed have taken up residence at my back door.
Already two are abloom. They came as a gift from Stepps out of Cornwall.
How Paisley is their pedigree is the question.
Although in Paisley seemed the obvious place to plant the query, at
the weekend it was the least likely to be fruitful. The town's mind was
on other things. On Saturday was its Sma' Shot Day.
Explaining the Sma' Shot to outsiders can be done, except it takes
longer than to mow a meadow. Suffice to say it recalls a wages victory
by the weavers. To mark the win they decreed that they would forever
have a whole day off work on the first Saturday of July. That was in
1856.
Now there is a town march led by a muckle drum that takes one man to
carry but two to thump. There is music and dancing. Lively young actors
put on a pageant about the Sma' Shot. Outside the town hall Donald Dewar
MP benignly harangued the lieges about their radical political ancestry.
Flowers were farthest from anybody's mind. Besides, what's left of
leftie politics is all red roses. Pinks have come to mean something
else.
Even on Saturday, however, they were not out of sight. Two stookies to
the right of Mr Dewar when he spoke stands a statue of Alexander Wilson.
He remains a local hero, although he left the town with the constabulary
right at his back. In American he found fame as an ornithologist and
poet. He also fancied pinks.
When some of the best blooms Alexander Wilson had ever seen were sent
from home to him in Philadelphia, he had a problem. What was he going to
tell his Yankee neighbours? Typically, he could not admit that anything
outside Paisley outshone the varieties it kept to itself. So (in 1806)
in a letter to his father he told how he fibbed to the people next door.
''I did not omit this opportunity (Wilson wrote) of raising their
admiration of the flora of my native country by assuring them that these
were but specimens of the inferior sort, and far surpassed by others of
larger size and richer colours which the gardens of a little village
called the Seedhills of Paisley produces in the greatest luxuriance.''
Because living proof is so meagre, Paisley pinks make for perfect
nostalgia. Their story can be perfumed with the imagination. Most
weavers were reluctant to send their creations out of the town. They
shared them only with each other. Even the names were kept quiet. Among
their choices may have been Sir Walter Scott and Robertson's Gentle
Shepherd.
Less than gentle, however, was local competition. Paisley Florist
Society is the oldest in Scotland. In David Rowand's Pictorial History
of Paisley some early society members have their photo on a gardening
outing for which they dressed as if for church on a cold Sunday. But so
warmly did they prize their pinks that whoever showed the dozen most
perfectly rounded blooms was awarded a silver-headed snuff holder.
Winning mere money never came into it.
What put paid to the mass of old pinks was new industry. Housing for
factory workers did not have gardens attached. And the satanic dirt from
mill chimneys killed off all but the Gems. When members of the Old
Paisley Society, a group of loyal conservationists, once spent a whole
summer and autumn of searching for other survivors, they failed to find
one.
Publicly now the Gems flourish as a museum attraction in the society's
courtyard garden alongside a patch of the brazen Mrs Sinkins.
Like other old-fashioned pinks, the Gems make a fuss about flowering.
They generate a jungle of shaggy foliage before they top out with their
pretty-lady purple heads. It is their uniqueness which imposes a heavy
trust that is hard to hold.
''There is a lot of vague romanticism, of course. And the names of old
flowers are fraught with difficulty,'' conceded Bernadette Jackson,
whose Cornwall nursery nurtured my three. ''But these are the only
Paisley ones I can find, and I cannot grow enough pinks.''
While lonesome Gems sparkle in more gardens than mine, it is tough to
know after last week's sunshine whether to have an open day for them or
to put up barbed wire.

THE Conservative leadership election, which is also of course an
election for the Premiership, comes to its head today. It has not been a
pleasant or an edifying sight. Elections seldom are. Gladstone detested
them but admitted their necessity in a liberal (if not, in his day, a
fully democratic) society. They force politicians to promise too much
and to focus on personalities far more than policies. They expose the
most crude thoughts assaulting even sensitive minds -- ''we can save
your seats'' -- and remind observers of how prone an intelligent and
politically sophisticated electorate can be to devious calculations of
self-interest. By definition, they are divisive. That is the price paid
for participation; and there is plenty of irony in the fact that this
election is supposed to be about the underlying unity of the
Conservative Party.
The hope that the matter might be settled today may not long survive a
quick scrutiny of the figures for, unless these disclose a strong
victory for Mr Major, his position might be much the same as it was
before the bold stroke, now clearly seen to have been a gamble, that
precipitated it. That is to say, the Tories may still seem divided, and
more formally than before. There could be more rounds of voting and
fighting before calm and authority are restored -- if indeed they can be
restored, when individual MPs already feel able to discuss their
resignation if the final outcome is not to their liking. The fact that
the election, no matter at one remove, is really about the Premiership
has been a source of widespread unease. In constitutional terms there is
nothing wrong about the procedure whereby a party can change its leader
and (if in office) the Premier by itself. Its decision must then be
ratified by Parliament, which can refuse the change, though it has never
done so. Many people believe, however, that they are being deprived of
participating in a crucial decision affecting their lives and the future
of their country. They are reacting to the way in which the British
Premiership has steadily become more presidential since 1945, with
actual leaders being more important in the popular mind than the party
they lead. Mr Major's unexpected victory in 1992 owed more to his
personality than to his party, which he still tends to outpace in the
opinion polls. Nothing can be done about this disjunction, but it is one
important aspect of political life thrown into relief by this contest.
The area of debate between the competitors may be less dramatic than
it seems. Just as parties play to the middle, for that is where votes
can be won or lost, so do their leaders. The realities of national life
and government tend to make pragmatists even of the dogmatic. Mr Redwood
is to the right of Mr Major, and his choice (unlikely and unfortunate as
that would be) would signal a Tory move in that direction. But Mr
Redwood himself made it clear that he did not want to lead a faction;
and as hardened a political in-fighter as Sir Teddy Taylor admitted his
personal confusion, even his despair. Both these are signs of how the
simple dichotomy of left and right no more adequately explains Tory
motivation than it does Labour motivation.
When the votes are counted, Mr Major will almost certainly emerge with
more than Mr Redwood; but will he have the clout he needs? This has
always been the intriguing question. In some ways this is a sham
contest, with the real contenders, Messrs Heseltine and Portillo,
waiting in the wings. They will only come on stage if Mr Major is seen
to be badly wounded. If they do, we shall back Mr Heseltine. But we hope
that tonight's vote will put an end to the matter, and that Mr Major
wins comfortably and well.

IT IS HARD to look at a picture of the Queen and decide what is going
on in her mind. You know that Princess Diana is neurotic because she
cares so very much about how she looks. But the Queen has always been
hard to decipher.
What she will set off, judging by this picture, left, of her in
Edinburgh as she visited the headquarters of the Bank of Scotland
yesterday, is a trend for the housecoat.
If she requested that her dressmaker throw up something in which she
would feel comfortable, the inspiration must have been subconsciously
drawn from days in a school canteen. I can see a curved flap, spreading
over a D-line shaped skirt, in a dinner-lady polyester check. The skirt
wrinkles as she walks, as if she's pulling it on one side.
And, in a complete perversion of the rules of style, her
porridge-coloured patent shoes match only the skull of her hat, not her
main outfit. Did somebody charge her money for this apology?
If fawning dignitaries and staff and advisers have reassured her that
she looks great, they are fulsome, parasitical wimps. But there she goes
with a dizzy smile.
What bad dress sense in someone who is usually extremely well turned
out sometimes illustrates is a change of heart. Indeed, there is
something disturbing about the expression on the Queen's face. She looks
almost happy. The royal family have always said how much they love
Scotland. Perhaps she's excited because she's here.

THE release of Private Lee Clegg, who was sentenced to life
imprisonment for the death of a teenage joy-rider in Belfast, has evoked
a massive reaction on both sides of the Irish Sea. His supporters, very
numerous in military and in Conservative political circles, were
overjoyed: they had campaigned assiduously for the outcome they desired.
Across the water reactions were more sombre and in some cases seriously
violent; again the political tinge was unmistakable. Private Clegg and
the tragic victims of the original incident have become footballs in the
politics of Ulster, the Irish Republic, and Britain.
There is no doubting the feeling which does exist for the soldier who
seemed to be himself a victim of injustice, though his case was never as
cut-and-dried as those who wanted his freedom were prone to suggest. If
it had all been so obvious he would never have been charged, tried,
convicted, and sentenced. Yet that process always contained much to
doubt. Had Clegg been a private individual instead of a private soldier
he would almost certainly never have been charged with murder. But that
hardly matters now. What does matter is the political fall-out and the
way in which his fate has been linked, even by the Irish Republic's
Prime Minister, with the IRA killers and bombers in custody in Ulster.
It is hard to see the connection, other than that established by the
need to combat the urban terrorists, the very need which had Private
Clegg and the road block in place to meet the youngsters who crashed
into it, probably in panic. Prisoners sentenced for considered and
deeply malicious crimes are not in the same league, and indeed are
simply not comparable. Their fundamental excuse, that their crimes are
political, cuts little ice. They live in a society which offers them
every democratic device to achieve a majority by persuasion -- their
calculated criminality begins with the recognition that they are not
persuasive by argument but need fear and the force that begets it.
None of that will prevent many people on both sides of the Irish Sea
sharing the deep anguish of Karen Reilly's parents. Their loss will be
felt by all parents, and by those who believed that Clegg's own
suffering was itself too much (and he did serve four years in prison).
It is easy to release him; impossible to bring back the girl. Yet one
event's irreparable loss cannot be corrected by an imposed one. It is
one measure of the wickedness of contemporary terrorism that its victims
are so often the young, the vulnerable and the innocent, cut off in the
full blossom of life. The rules of conduct imposed on the military,
often very young themselves, are strict, as they should be, but they
cannot guarantee the avoidance of accidents. These, when they occur,
have a terrible dimension. This one certainly did. Peace would have
avoided it. How sad to have to note that that is the very quality which
the IRA has to agonise about keeping.

THREE years after Loch Leven suffered its infamous ''Scum Sunday'',
turning green and toxic, a new project has been launched to co-operate
with local landowners, and prevent it happening again.
Phosphorus had reacted with the algae, polluting the brown trout
fishery.
Mr Magnus Magnusson, chairman of the Scottish National Heritage, said
it had been ''a bad day for the reputation of Scotland itself''.
The creation of the Loch Leven Catchment Management Project aims to
cure the problem.
Representatives of Perth and Kinross District Council, the Scottish
Agricultural College, the Forth River Purification Board, and Loch
Leven's owner, Sir David Montgomery, yesterday attended the official
opening of the partnership initiative.
Project officer Douglas Flint said: ''We are really looking to develop
trust between local landowners and a two-way flow of information to come
up with practical solutions.''
Mr Magnusson recalled the summer's day of Saturday, June 13, 1992,
when he arrived at Loch Leven for the Natural Heritage Festival there.
''Large quantities of phosphorus which had accumulated in the
sediments of the loch following decades of man's activities in the
surrounding area had been released by the calm, sunny conditions. The
phosphorus was taken up by the algae which, using the abundant sunlight,
were reproducing at a prodigious rate to the point where they turned the
water as green as pea-soup,'' he said.
''It was a bad day for Loch Leven and its renown as a champion brown
trout loch, a bad day for the Natural Heritage Festival, a bad day for
the reputation of Scotland itself. But it wasn't all bad; at least it
focused public and media attention, once again, most opportunely, on the
loch's problems and its management.''
Phosphorus has been declining in recent years with new sewage works
changes to local works, but problems remain.
Mr Flint explained: ''Rural sewage and septic tanks are a major issue.
We also need the input of farmers and forestry operators in terms of

''We need them to make a subtle change to their cultivation practices
to stop the soil moving in the field, such as planting seed as late as
possible and creating buffer strips between the field and burn.''

GIVEN the complexity and multiplicity of the continuing saga of
European integration, the repeated calls for a referendum provide mild
amusement.
The reality is politicians across all party lines have shrouded the
matter in such a high degree of opacity that they have catapulted the
issues beyond the comprehension of the average voter (me included).
It would be intriguing to know what the question would be, and of even
greater interest to see how it would be structured on a polling card.
Notwithstanding this, the turnout of the electorate would be lucky to
reach 40%.
With a General Election less than two years away and the real
possibility of a new administration being selected who would take us
into Europe lock, stock, and barrel, what would the point of it all be?
Dream on, Teddy Taylor!

IT IS many years since I led and won the Hamilton part of the
referendum campaign to keep Britain in Europe. I did so because I
believed uniting Europe offered our best hope of avoiding a third
European war. Nothing in today's Europe changes my view.
Indeed, the change from fear of future conflict of the cold war to the
present reality of conflict in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union,
greatly strengthens the need for Europeans to grow together and stand
together.
The need for a united Europe and the uniting of nations made
completely trivial wine and milk lakes, butter and grain mountains,
Brussels red tape, and armies of Luxembourg bureaucrats which were but
practical effects of relatively minor adjustments of vast production
machines.
I understand one modest-sized regional council (Fife) employs more
people than does the European Commission. At least with mountains of
food and lakes to drink we hunger and thirst not -- 50 years ago it was
not always so in Europe. It is not so today in many parts of the world.
Britain's place in Europe is the real issue of the Tory leadership
power struggle which puts the Tory leadership struggle into its proper
perspective. Trivial manifesto blandishments are the excuses for
grasping personal power.
It is a struggle for personal power by addicts of the greed culture of
the Thatcher years with the challengers and potential challengers of the
present Government's policies with their snouts deep in the trough of
ambition, seeking personal power and personal advantage regardless of
the cost to Britain.

Dispensing good advice helps the medicine go down, as Eric Kennedy
discovers
DON'T be put out next time you collect a prescription and the
pharmacist asks if you're sure you know what to do with the medicine.
That's their job, and they are very conscientious about doing it.
Isabel Crossan feels it is important to check that some medicines are
being used properly. ''Some can be dangerous,'' she says. ''Even though
the person's doctor has no doubt provided guidance, people can forget
the dosage and other things.
''The pharmacist is the last person to see the patient before they
start taking the medicine. We carry a great deal of responsibility.''
Isabel feels her job as a pharmacist is well worthwhile: one which
helps people in a tangible way. She stumbled into it, rather than
planned for it, when she left Holyrood Secondary in Glasgow in 1985.
Her Highers included chemistry, maths, physics, history and English
but, at 17, she did not know much about pharmacy. She was good at
chemistry, however, so it seemed right. She thought she could always
switch to another course later if things didn't work out.
Pharmacy asks for an A in chemistry, at least a B in another science,
an A in English, and at least a B in maths, so Isabel was well
qualified.
She went to Strathclyde University in August of that year and found
the first year easy. ''You were studying subjects you had partly covered
at school,'' she says. These included chemistry, physics, biosciences,
maths and statistics.
But the honeymoon ended in the second year when pharmaceutics,
pharmaceutical chemistry and physiology reared their heads. These she
found ''quite dry''. The third year she started studying dispensing and
learning about the legal and ethical side of drug supply, as well as
interpersonal skills and counselling.
In the fourth year she had to specialise between pharmaceutical
science or pharmacology, and she chose the former.
She graduated BSc. Hons (Pharmacy) in 1989, then began a year of
training. The options were retail, industrial, or community pharmacy and
Isabel worked for six months at the Southern General and six with a
research company in East Kilbride.
Then it was back to Strathclyde to do a PhD in 1990 but a spell of
post-viral syndrome interrupted her studies for a year. Was it a case of
pharmacist heal thyself?
''Well, I just slept and rested and managed to come through it,'' she
says. ''But I realise I have been very lucky.''
She is completing her thesis at the moment, and working full-time as a
locum in a pharmacy on the South Side of Glasgow, where she has had
various part-time and temporary jobs for the last five years.
Once she gets her PhD she will have the qualifications to work
anywhere. She will probably go into industry, working for a big company,
as that is where the opportunities lie. However, that means a move to
England and she wants time to think about it.
At her age, she doesn't need to rush.

YESTERDAY morning I had a curious experience. My mind was far, far
away, wandering in past recent and distant, lost in troubles present.
Somewhere remote a voice droned, a soft Highland voice, like the
soothing babble of a burn. I decided that was what it was, and then the
babble stopped. There was an impression of movement, like trees rising,
and I looked up.
I found I was sitting in the front pew of a little church, and for an
age I had not the faintest idea what church, nor what place, nor why
everyone about me was standing, and why there was such quiet. I thought
I was in a dream, and then I saw the red Psalmody beside me. I came to
myself. This was our wee church in the village, and the Psalmody was for
my use, and I was meant to lead the next singing.
Now.
I had not the faintest idea of what Psalm, what verse, or what tune I
was meant to raise.
In a pool of silence all time stopped.
I came back to Harris at the end of May. At that time it appeared that
certain difficult circumstances had lifted and I was now free to proceed
with my own life. I had property matters to sort out. I wanted to sell
my present little house and buy a larger one elsewhere in Harris more
populous and convenient. I had already identified one or two. To cut a
long story short, the process has gone badly wrong. The crisis in the
Free Church, of which many Herald readers will be aware, shows great
reluctance to vanish. Some are doing their best to drag it back on
stage. Brethren seem incapable of the resolve to stop them. It is for
others, in due time, to tell that story. I should make a bad job of it.
So, slowly, what seemed simple here has become tangled and dark. Only
a week ago I was castigating John Major for his inability to show
decision. Even then I was uncomfortably aware of my own increasing
inability to settle an issue. This morning I am certain of only one
thing: that I am quite incapable, at present, of deciding anything
beyond the amount of sugar in my coffee. Over the past month I have
taken ever wilder decisions, announced them, acted upon them, changed my
mind, withdrawn. I have grown anxious, even unstable. I am showing some
classic symptoms of stress.
Like aphasia: extreme absent-mindedness.
I stood up, turned to face the people. A second hung in the air like a
huge rain drop, swelling, drooping, about to fall. I fluttered through
the Psalmody, as if the necessary portion of praise would raise a hand
and announce myself. ''Pardon me,'' I heard myself repeat in a pleasant,
laid-back tone, ''pardon me . . .''
There was a bit of paper on the pew, slipped to me at the door. On it,
I knew, were the scheduled singings: Psalm numbers, verse numbers. I
looked at it. It was perfectly legible, but my brain seemed unable to
take it in.
I fluttered on. ''Pardon me . . . sorry. Excuse me . . .''
The second quivered, passed and fell.
What is odd is that my logical brain, the part that thinks and
analyses, works perfectly. The trouble is that it is in overdrive. It is
chewing much about me to death. Like a crazed pirate captain, beyond
control and beyond stopping, it has banished sleep and bound and gagged
my stomach and ordered up to the bridge prodigious quantities of
cigarettes and coffee. It announces, especially late at night, bizarre
orders. On a night last week, past midnight, I wrote a letter to
someone. When I later reviewed it, by which time it had been sent and
caused quite a bustle in the hedgerow, I was astonished. It was not only
absurd, it was incomprehensible. There were huge screeds of it I could
not understand myself.
We sorted it out, I think.
Stress is an extraordinary thing. Over the past few months I have seen
some dear to me in a similar state. I showed little sympathy. Well, I
ken noo. Part of me is able to stand back and laugh. Part of me is
embarrassed. There is guilt, but I am no longer sure how rational it is
nor indeed how rational anything is at the moment. It helps to write
like this to yourselves, because it makes something useful out of it
all, and that over the void to others, in difficult times, who find
themselves likewise.
I needed help.
''What verse, Dan?'' I muttered.
''Verse 10,'' said the Elder, ''verse 10.'' There was a patient cast
to him. I am not a patient person and I wished I was.
''Verse 10,'' added the Missionary.
I scanned plenty verse 10s, the pages flapping, and felt tired. I
needed more. New seconds burst on the floor.
''Psalm 105?'' I asked, ''one-oh-five?''
''One-oh-six,'' said the Elder.
''One-oh-six,'' said the Missionary.
I owe much, in these days, to my good friends in Harris and steady
neighbours here. I have been grateful, too, for the quiet wisdom of my
father, his tones warm on the line in the night. We have been through
much together of late. We will see it to the end.
I had the line. I asked the air for a tune and a tune came to me. It
was Evan, who is an old friend, one of the classic Scottish Psalm tunes,
apt for any Psalm in the common metre, fit for any emotional note. In a
chamber of my strange brain a file clicked out and reminded me that,
when President Eisenhower was buried, in 1969, the Twenty-Third Psalm
was sung and that Evan was the tune, to a most unusual military beat.
I sang, loud and clear, and they sang with me. My right hand began to
shake and I clenched it and the shaking stopped. The singing ended and
the service proceeded.
Last night a friend complimented me on my formidable memory. ''Aye,''
I said, ''too formidable by half.''
I am thinking just now of Corrie ten Boom, a noted Dutch Christian,
and who -- well into her 50s -- suffered greatly in Nazi prison camps
for her part in saving dozens of Jews. In later days she toured the
world to witness for Christ. She came face to face with a German
Christian whom at once she recognised, though he did not know her: he
had been a guard in Ravensbruck, a guard who had brutalised her sister
Betsy, who did not emerge alive.
And, against herself, Corrie ten Boom found the grace to forgive him.
She wrote later of the sea of God's forgetfulness. There He casts all
the wrongs and failings of His redeemed people. And the Lord, she said,
had a great sign beside that sea: NO FISHING.
I have done, perhaps, too much fishing of late. For faults real of
mine, imagined -- cherished? -- of others.
Last week I climbed a ridge, and in a hollow looked to the Minch on
one side, and to Loch Seaforth before me, and to Loch Maraig behind me,
blue and serene as the day they were first framed.
It seemed to me then that, whatever may happen, and wherever I may go,
the day will come, if I am spared to see old age, when I would look back
on my time here. In that day the sun would always be shining; the place
would always be beautiful; and I would always be young.

A COMBINATION of steep rises in raw material costs last year that
proved impossible to pass on to consumers, coupled with a smaller
proportion of goods manufactured in-house ate into MFI's margins last
year.
Britain's largest furniture manufacturer and retailer reported a
slight drop in annual profits from #68.2m to #66.1m although sales
increased by 9% to #721m. The sales growth was helped by the opening of
seven new stores.
The company experienced higher raw material costs and in some cases
shortages of raw materials. Paper prices jumped by 40% during the course
of the year and are still going up. Chipboard prices were 25% higher
although its price along with several others has recently showed signs
of stabilising.
But given its strong cashflow and healthy balance sheet, MFI has
decided to raise the annual dividend by 6.3% to 4.25p after proposing a
final shareholders' payment of 2.75p. Net interest payable halved in the
year to #3.5m reflecting the positive cashflow.
One potentially useful avenue of income growth could be in the leasing
out of surplus space, principally warehouse sites.
MFI estimates that because of advances in technology and logistics it
does not need as many large warehouses. It has identified about one
million square feet of surplus space on which it is considering its
options.
One of these would be to let the surplus space to other retailers who
are finding it difficult to secure their own out-of-town retail sites
because of stricter planning regulations. Last year, MFI earned #500,000
in rental income from shops on its freehold land in Solihull,
Birmingham.
Consumer demand continues to be sluggish for all retailers. UK trading
in the first two months of the new financial year, traditionally a quiet
time for MFI, is said to be at a similar level to this time last year.
However, chairman Derek Hunt is confident that irrespective of an
improvement in the housing market, a combination of the group's
reputation for giving good value for money, revamped stores and new
product development will enable the group to remain ahead of the
competition.
Its market share in its core kitchen and bedroom ranges is three times
that of its nearest rival. During the year, it launched nine new
kitchens and 12 new bedroom ranges along with new ranges of pine
furniture, appliances, and textiles. This year more new kitchens will be
on offer.
The French business is continuing to grow strongly and is expected to
make an increasing contribution to MFI's group results. MFI hopes to
build Hygena into the third biggest kitchen brand in France. Last year,
like-for-like sales grew by 21%. A total of 62 Hygena stores will be
trading in France by the end of the current financial year.
MFI's profits fall had been expected by the City but some analysts
were looking for a bigger dividend increase and so MFI shares dipped
1[1/2]p to 115p where they yield 4.6%.
For the current year Tony Cooper of Scottish brokers Sutherlands is
forecasting profits of #72m with much of the improvement to come in the
second half.

CAN we point out to the quality assessor in business and management
from Glasgow University, Dr Southern, that his somewhat grudging letter
concerning our MBA programme is not entirely accurate (June 28)?
Dr Southern may not have assessed postgraduate programmes in the
institutions he visited, but the team which visited us scrutinised not
only our three undergraduate courses but also nine of our MSc offerings.
We share the disappointment of the chairman of the funding council's
quality assessment committee that Scottish MBA programmes were omitted,
particularly when such courses were included in such an assessment south
of the Border last year.
Our flagship MBA programme is not isolated but embedded in the wider
teaching culture which pervades the Strathclyde Business School. Many of
the staff who teach on our MBA came under the assessors' scrutiny and
the school was awarded the funding council's highest accolade.
Our MBA reflects our general commitment to teaching and research
excellence, and potential MBA applicants should know this.

I AM writing in response to your report ''Consultant goes to law over
rejection'' (June 15). I am a 17-year-old school leaver who seems to be
in almost the same circumstances as Mr O'Reilly's son.
Next year I hope to go to Glasgow University to study veterinary
medicine and I too, like everyone who hopes for a place, had to pass a
formal interview before being offered the chance to study at the
university.
I have been offered a place not only on my current Higher grades but
on practical experience which I and every other promising veterinary
medical student has to have before even being considered.
I also have to achieve a high level of grades in my exams this year
before a place will be guaranteed.
I am furious with this man who says: ''The bottom line is that you've
got a school system which encourages children to work hard and a
university system that ignores that and replaces it with an interview.''
This is ridiculous as universities encourage young people to work even
harder to show they are dedicated, hard-working, and will do what it
takes to become accepted. Six Highers at A grade is quite an achievement
but the university has rightly decided that it's not just brains that
makes a good doctor. It's hard work, determination, and willingness to
learn.

IN REPLY to Hugh Brennan's letter (June 23), can I say the school in
which I taught, in common with all Roman Catholic denominational schools
in Scotland, when appointing teachers to positions with pastoral
responsibilities for children takes into account the fact that the
parents of their pupils have taken a positive decision to have their
children educated within a ''Catholic'' school.
''Pastoral care'', among other things, most importantly for the
Catholic parent implies a specific commitment on the part of the teacher
to the spiritual care and guidance of the pupil. This commitment could
not be asked of a non-Catholic teacher.
It is for this reason, and this reason alone, that appointments to
guidance and senior management positions within Roman Catholic
denominational schools are restricted to those who are acceptable to the
appropriate diocese.
In theory they need not necessarily be themselves of the Catholic
faith, but I accept that in practice that has always been the case.

IF Glasgow City Council is really concerned about treating all of
Glasgow's diverse religious groups in an even-handed manner, would it
not be best to dismiss the notion of a religious service altogether?
This would simultaneously ensure equality among the various groups and
factions and represent the true majority, atheists and agnostics.
I should like to think that our culture is based on a more classical
model than Christianity. Even if this can be shown not to be the case,
such is the nature of cultural development that society must, from time
to time, break with tradition and free itself from elements of its past
which are no longer practical.

Hospice staff need a wide skills-base to provide the warmest of
welcomes, reports Geraldine Abrahams
THE first word in the information booklet for patients, relatives, and
visitors to the Prince &amp; Princess of Wales Hospice is ''welcome'' -- a
word that sums up the whole hospice movement.
Anyone who has cared for relatives with terminal illness and who has
experienced the warmth and dedication of hospice staff will recognise
the importance of that unique kind of care.
The Prince &amp; Princess of Wales Hospice was founded by Anne J J Gilmore
MD, and first opened at Carlton Place in 1987, although at that time
there was only a day hospice/lounge. Before that, home-care nurses had
been going out to treat patients in their own home with doctors working
on a part-time basis at the hospice.
Two years later it began admitting patients for the first time. Today
the hospice can accommodate 22 in-patients, although only 14 beds are
operational. Eight have been unused for the past two years because there
are no funds for nursing care to run them.
There is also a day unit, which is socially oriented since terminal
illness can be very isolating for both patients and their carers.
The hospice is not an NHS institution and depends very much on its
fund-raisers, only three of whom are paid, to organise activities and
run hospice shops.
''We receive financial support from Greater Glasgow Health Board, for
which we are very grateful, but more than 50% of our funding comes from
a sector without which the hospice could not function -- the general
public,'' says chief executive Iain Laidlaw.
The hospice intentionally looks more like a hotel than a hospital, but
the medical staff is highly trained in palliative medicine.
Everyone in the hospice wards is terminally ill. Around 90% have
cancer, and other illnesses include motor neurone disease and multiple
sclerosis.
They are admitted to the 14-bed in-patient unit specifically for
symptom control, and most patients stay, on average, for two or three
weeks.
''It is not a long-term care unit, but very much an acute palliative
care unit,'' says Dr Shiela McGettrick, acting medical director. ''More
than half the patients go home. Another source of admissions is people
coming in for short-term respite care.
''Here at the hospice we provide specialist palliative medicine, which
means that we specialise in the care of the terminally ill, addressing
the physical and emotional needs. For everyone here, the aim is to
improve the quality of life of people who are terminally ill.
''From the medical side, we address symptoms of disease rather than
the disease itself, so we are treating pain, nausea, vomiting,
breathlessness -- the kind of things that result from different
diseases. We look after people's emotional needs, and try to support the
family and the relationships within the family.''
Communication skills are vital in this type of work, and medical
students in their second and final years of study attend training
sessions at the hospice. There are also courses on symptom control for
GPs and junior hospital house officers.
''There are some difficult communication issues associated with
palliative care, and we teach the medical students how to address
them,'' says Dr McGettrick.
Where originally hospice medical directors would have come from
specialities such as oncology and pioneered palliative medicine, there
are now around 33 training programmes in the UK and a Diploma in
Palliative Medicine.
A large part of the hospice doctor's work is in the community, where
GPs and hospital medical staff refer patients or request home visits.
Other hospitals also need advice on symptom control and family problems.
The Prince &amp; Princess of Wales Hospice also has two retired
neurosurgeons and two working anaesthetists who have been attending
voluntarily on a weekly basis since the hospice opened, working on pain
control and practising alternative medicine, including acupuncture and
nerve blocks.
On the nursing side, the ratio of nursing staff to patients is high,
similar to that of highly dependent medical or surgical wards. Around
55% of the nurses are trained and all but one is fully registered, while
45% are nursing auxiliaries with training in social work care and health
care.
The hospice provides a holistic approach, dealing with physical,
spiritual, psychological and emotional care. ''To meet the needs of
patients and carers, the nursing staff require specialised skills in
listening, counselling, bereavement and symptom control,'' says senior
sister Ruby Smith.
''It has long been the hospice's policy to develop these skills within
the staff by offering specialised courses particular to this type of
care.''
Apart from ward nurses, there are nursing staff members in the day
unit, working with around six volunteers each day who, in many cases,
are trained nurses, and the Wednesday morning pain clinic has one nurse.
There are three home-care sisters, two of them paid by Greater Glasgow
Health Board and the third by the hospice. Each has a caseload of around
30 patients.
Other staff successfully trained at the hospice include SVQ trainees
on long-term attachments and adult unemployed trainees, working as
auxiliaries. Social work students from Strathclyde Regional Council are
trained by social workers attached to the hospice.
Peripatetic staff include a community physiotherapist and qualified
volunteers and students who do aromatherapy, reflexology and massage.
There is a retired, fully-qualified hairdresser who is assisted by
volunteers and hairdressing students from Central College of Commerce.

IT IS nightfall in Moscow when Viktor discovers the loss of his front
door key and the only solution is to summon the locksmiths who fitted
the door in the first place. This is a pity because they will surely
arrive with a circular saw and, for many reasons, the door is a precious
emblem in Viktor's life. For one thing it marks his conversion to
capitalism and now, through his own carelessness, others may be about to
hack it to pieces.
There is nothing flimsy about this door. Instead it is made of solid
iron with three complicated locks, its construction disguised by
quilting in dark red imitation leather which is buttoned diagonally like
an old club chair. Had Viktor left the door naked, its raw iron
appearance, set against the harsh concrete of the communal landing,
would have made the entrance to his flat seem exactly like a prison, and
no-one wants to live with such reminders of Russia's brutal past.
As it is, people arriving at his door these days observe its padded
camouflage and say: ''Ah, Viktor Ivanovich has now earned enough money
to buy an iron door, just like the rest of us.'' The more competitive
might add: ''Nevertheless, he is not making sufficient to purchase an
iron door so masterfully crafted it mimics carved wood.'' What does
Viktor care? This iron door, he tells himself, cost $1000. Three years
ago he could never have thought of owning such a sum, but then three
years ago neither did he possess anything which required such expensive
defence.
Today there remains no adequate way to translate the word consumer
into Russian, but the scores of flourishing security companies in Moscow
are proof that this city is an advertiser's dream. Italian furniture,
multi-media computers from Taiwan, German white goods, French clothes,
Danish biscuits, American jeans . . . for the majority these items mock
their unremitting poverty, but in Moscow's commercial sector there is
good money to be made by those with smart connections and the mental
agility to deal simultaneously in two currencies: the rouble and the
dollar. As a result, the affluent now have the means to relish, rather
than loathe, that universal truth -- each and every one of us was born
to shop.
So Viktor has his iron door to defend his home of plenty against the
gangster's push. But there is more to it than that. Two years ago, when
rebels sought to topple President Yeltsin by hijacking Russia's
Parliament, the White House, Viktor and his family looked out from their
apartment windows and saw gunfire raging for control of the Oftanko
television station. Democracy was in danger of being riddled with
bullets before their very eyes, and at that moment Viktor vowed he would
buy an iron door.
But as a doctor he knew he would never accumulate sufficient cash for
such a purchase. Medicine counts for little with Russia's current
paymasters and Viktor's salary per month was $150. Thus he decided to
climb aboard the free-market wagon and become a businessman. Now, as a
director of a foreign soft drinks company, his pay is $2000 per month.
He, at least, has stability of sorts. Yet look at the streets, he
says: the Government's hideous bungling of the Chechen siege of
Budynnovsk has brought only threats of terrorist reprisal to Moscow. At
every major intersection now, at every important bridge, armed soldiers
are on alert, stopping cars in the search for weapons. Twenty-six
armoured personnel carriers and 16,000 troops have been mobilised
throughout the city, and in two weeks more than 53,000 people have been
detained.
Can anyone be certain that under Yeltsin's fitful hand tanks will not
roll against them once again? This is not a clever time to be without
the key to one's iron door. But, deft as surgeons, the team from the
security company is now cutting through Viktor's triple locks in a
manner which preserves the door's construction.
Tomorrow they will return to carry out the repairs, but no-one needs
fear that this family will spend tonight unprotected: Viktor kept the
original front door behind the new one which opens outwards so that not
even the most hostile boot can kick it in. Because of his haste he
forgot to lock the inner door this morning. However, he knows there is a
spare key somewhere in the flat. Still, it worries him that experts can
render an iron door useless in so few minutes and with so little mess.
Surely the Mafia will now have such virtuoso locksmiths of their own.
Which is why Viktor hasn't given up on that other terrible old defender:
the gun hidden beneath the bed.

SINCE Jack Thomson's Herald Essay appeared (June 17) I have hoped to
find some appreciative letters among those hardy perennials on politics,
travel, weather, John Macleod and/or Jack McLean. But not one!
No response at all to one of the clearest and most concise statements
of what is wrong with this ailing world that has been printed in The
Herald for many a year.
It seemed to be up to me to say, Thank you, Jack Thomson, and all the
more so after the very scathing reaction of M Forsyth appeared (June
23).
Any thinking person, he says, must be antagonised and irritated by
Jack Thomson's views. I think I can claim to be such a one and I was far
from antagonistic or even irritated by those truths he spelled out to
us. What I do feel is saddened and puzzled.
M Forsyth objects that Jack Thomson is ''making a mockery of
Christianity''. How can any Christian, or even any thinking person, say
that it makes a mockery of Christianity to insist that as a Christian
nation we must restore the rule of the Church and its only true
sovereign, Jesus Christ?
Perhaps it is a pity that Jack Thomson ended up, as he did, with
''only strong union with Christ will make a strong Scotland''. I am sure
it would, but it is not the country of our birth that concerns Christ
most. It is surely the kingdom of our re-birth.
Christ died that we who believe in him might be born again, freed from
our worldly sinfulness by his sacrifice and our repentance, to live
forever in his eternal kingdom. God has promised it, and God keeps his
promises. It is all about love.
Politics today seems to be more about tactics than love. Yet love is
everything in God's relationship with humanity. In return for our loving
obedience to him, we receive his unbounded love.

As international skin specialists head to Glasgow for a conference,
Margaret Vaughan reports how Scots are ignoring warnings on the risks of
sunbathing
IT WAS not a pretty sight for Professor Rona MacKie. It was not a
pretty sight at all, really. Those bodies: thousands of them, glowing
pink, very pink, puce and red raw, lined up like candystripe corpses in
parks, on grassy knolls, perched on window ledges frying in the fierce
noonday sun of the heatwave.
Perhaps it is as well that the heat has gone out of the sun. For how
to explain to the 500 or so international specialists converging on
Glasgow today why, when they are gathered to hear the latest alarming
findings on the rise in skin cancer, in a country with an international
reputation for its knowledge of the subject, the Scots persist in
flinging off all caution and clothes at the first ray of sunshine?
Why, when skin cancer cases are increasing by 10% a year, when the
most dangerous, malignant melanoma, has doubled over a decade, do we
continue to hanker for the mahogany look? Or worse, condemn our children
to become the malignant melanoma patients of the new millennium?
Childhood sunburn is increasingly thought to be a trigger of skin
cancer.
A single episode of severe sunburn, especially in infancy or
childhood, may be enough to trigger melanoma 20 years later in life. Yet
hospitals around the country reported scores of cases of badly burned
children brought into casualty departments last week. Professor MacKie
saw some of the results.
There's a hint of exasperation, or maybe it's just frustration, in
Professor MacKie's response: ''I shout about the dangers all the time,
but I only had to look at the parks last week, at what people do to
themselves to know . . . I only had to look at what came into Yorkhill
hospital, all those sunburnt children, it was very sad and quite
distressing. Everyone must know by now. They know, but they don't change
their habits.''
The Glasgow University professor of dermatology is not a killjoy:
she's not advocating donning a chador for a day out at Dunoon. She
simply wants people to take sensible precautions to avert what is now
the second most common cause of death among people aged 24 to 35. The
second most preventable cause of death, she emphasises: ''We have very
good figures for Scotland, which show numbers of skin cancer have
doubled in 10 years and are still going up. We have a problem on our
hands.''
Since the mid-seventies, the number of people dying of melanoma has
risen by 73%, while its incidence has gone up by 160%. If caught early,
it is one of the more curable cancers. Women are twice as likely to
suffer a melanoma as men. It occurs most frequently on the legs in
women, and on the trunk -- particularly the back -- in men.
Figures from the Cancer Research Campaign show that between 1980 and
1989 the number of new cases of melanoma rose from 2239 to 4114 -- 2572
of them women.
Professor MacKie says she doesn't want to be negative: the message is,
enjoy the sun but do not burn. Precautions are simple: avoid the noonday
sun, even here in the UK, because that's when the rays are at their most
dangerous. Look for shade. Wear a teeshirt and a hat on the beach. Use a
sun screen cream, with a high protection factor, but don't slather it on
to let you sizzle on the beach for hours.
Professor MacKie accepts that many grown-ups know the message and the
risks already but choose to ignore them in pursuit of a tan. However,
she says, parents seem more inclined to hear the message and act on it
for their children's sake: ''Remember that children's skin is more
vulnerable than adults.''
In Australia, where the dangers of skin cancer are increasingly
emphasised, some beaches carry health warning signs. Beach patrols warn
sun seekers of the risks. Communal sprays with barrier sun creams from
10-gallon drums are available. It may seem an unnecessary precaution on
Portobello sands but because -- as you may have noticed -- our climate
has not inured us to the delights of the sun, there's a tendency to burn
when it does put in an appearance.
In California, barrier cream sales have trebled in 10 years in some
coastal areas. Professor MacKie would like to see a much simpler
labelling system used on sun screen products here. The plethora of
useless information on the back of many bottles -- factor this, that and
the other -- should be junked in favour of a simpler system: ''You want
a strong sun protection; strong or medium. That's all the label has to
say.''
There is a worldwide rise in skin cancer cases, thought to be linked
to increased leisure activities and possibly also to changes in the
atmosphere such as depletion of the ozone layer.
And if scaring you out of your freckly Scots skin is not enough to
convince you to cover up, there's always the vanity card to play. Dr
Michael Edward -- a colleague of Professor MacKie's -- is sure that
unlike Baywatch's caramel bimbos and bimboys, less rather than more
exposure is the way to avoid alligator skin tone.
Much as a luscious plum looks much like a wizened prune after a
sun-bath, so the skin shrivels and wrinkles with too much exposure.
''The rays damage the cells in the dermal part of the skin and it
affects their production of certain molecules, like collagen. You end up
with wrinkles. People who continually lie out in the sun end up with
leathery skin, or worse,'' say Dr Edward.
Professor MacKie is happy the conference of eminent dermatologists
from as far away as Austrialia, New Zealand, and the US, is coming to
meet in Glasgow, but you sense she is even happier that, so far, the sun
and its worshippers are not out to greet them.

VIRTUALITY is no longer just an entertainment buzz word. With a
computer-generated image unveiled for Edinburgh's new financial
district, and the news that the electronics mogul Philips is taking an
interest in the computer game firm, Virtuality, it is increasingly
important that Scotland's industrialists become aware of the duality of
virtuality.
The rapid development of desk-top computing power and computer-aided
design and the associated fall in prices and advancements in computer
graphics technology and computer-aided design is providing industry with
the ability to achieve improvement via the use of computer simulation.
In today's time-based competitive market-place, innovative ideas and
approaches that accelerate the introduction of new ideas to the market
are essential for the success of today's manufacturer.
The future manufacturing capability of the United Kingdom is tightly
linked to the use of high technology tools such as virtual reality
systems. They help to decrease the total development cycle, avoid costly
errors, optimise newly developed products, and increase product quality.
Furthermore, virtual engineering allows the parties involved with
design, manufacturing, operations, and maintenance to contribute jointly
to the design process earlier in the production cycle.
Improved operator training and familiarisation will be the result of
continued investment in virtual reality systems, as well as saving time,
money, and increased profitability. Consequently ignorance of the
capabilities of virtual reality will leave some manufacturers practising
yesterday's design processes.

CONSIDER this. Of the 52 Conservative seats which a Mori poll for the
Economist calculated could be saved if Michael Heseltine became party
leader, only one was north of the Border -- Eastwood, which is by far
the safest Tory-held seat in Scotland.
In other words, if John Major survives today's bizarre and byzantine
re-election process with only flesh wounds and manages to stagger on, or
if he is critically injured and has to be replaced by any possible
contender other than Mr Heseltine, Mori calculates the Tories will lose
all 10 Scottish seats they currently hold.
Even with the President of the Board of Trade installed at Number 10,
only Allan Stewart's cushion of 22.7% would suffice to keep him at
Westminster, where he would represent the entire Shadow Scottish Office
team.
Sir Hector Monro is retiring, bequeathing a 13.1% majority to Struan
Stevenson, while none of the other eight seats has a majority with a
percentage in double figures. Michael Forsyth, leading by 1.5%, loses
supporters in Bridge of Allan from his Stirling constituency, while Phil
Gallie is guarding a 0.2% lead in Ayr.
With such a tiny amount of electoral fat left to trim, any anti-Tory
swing at all at the next General Election would translate instantly into
lost seats and the party shows no real sign of cutting into the lead
enjoyed by the Labour Party under Tony Blair.
Ian Lang and Sir Michael Hirst take legitimate pleasure in reminding
journalists of assessments at the time of the last General Election
which predicted a Tory-free Scotland, but the truth is that the
arithmetic was as kind to them then in 1992 as it was cruel to them in
this year's local elections.
In April the Conservatives dropped below critical mass in Scottish
politics and ended up powerless, a minority party which would have done
much better under any system of proportional representation. Whether
that happens at the next General Election depends on the direction the
party takes at Westminster.
So there are a number of ironies facing the 10 Scottish Tories who
cast their votes today. Bill Walker is openly supporting John Redwood's
right-wing challenge. Three other right-wingers -- Michael Forsyth,
Allan Stewart, and Phil Gallie -- are declaring for the Prime Minister,
but it is possible to interpret their votes as at least in part
anti-Heseltine rather than purely pro-Major.
Which ideological road the party plunges down today will dictate
whether it muddles through towards limp defeat at the hands of a Labour
Party which has staked a more confident grip on the middle ground of
British politics, or strikes out on a more confident right-wing path
which may lose heavily at the next General Election but regroup more
quickly in Opposition in readiness for any anti-Labour backlash.
The Mori poll for the Economist divided the electorate into three
categories -- all voters, Tory loyalists, and disgruntled ex-Tories --
and ran nine contenders through the equation to see who would woo most
support and who would prove to be a vote-loser. The biggest single plus
was John Major's appeal (53%) to the party faithful but this was offset
by a strong downside in support among the other categories, particularly
the ex-Tories.
In a less extreme way this pattern was repeated for Ian Lang, Kenneth
Clarke, Malcolm Rifkind, Michael Howard, and Michael Portillo --
loyalist support offset by poor general appeal or dislike among former
party supporters. John Redwood was an exception, liked by disgruntled
ex-Tories (presumably devotees of Lady Thatcher stimulated by her latest
biographical offerings) but resented by the faithful and distrusted by
the electorate at large.
Only two Cabinet Ministers, Gillian Shephard and Michael Heseltine,
scored plus points across all three categories, with the latter scoring
heavily across the board. If Tories are prepared to accept the logic of
this analysis, that only Mr Heseltine has the support across the breadth
of the electorate to combat the Blair factor, then it follows that they
must admit that a rightward lunge to appease the anti-European wing of
the party is electoral suicide.
And yet this is what they cannot bring themselves to admit. If these
MPs were inmates of any institution other than Westminster they would be
put on suicide watch and have their belts and shoelaces taken away by
attendants preparing to strap on long-sleeved garments which tie at the
back.
Nowhere is this madness more marked than in Scotland, where
Thatcherism failed to flower first time round. The grouping most
recently portrayed as half a policy statement short of a manifesto was
the gathering of elderly party statesmen brandishing their Cathcart
Declaration at the Conservative conference in Glasgow.
In light of the events of the past fortnight in London, who can now
say that the South Side prescriptions of old-fashioned, paternalist
Toryism, a more Scottish party identity, and above all greater party
democracy were so daft after all?
Certainly, the Conservative Party's bureaucratic machinery faces
certain overhaul after this summer of crisis is over. As first hinted at
by Ian Lang in The Herald 10 days ago the leadership selection procedure
is likely to be redrafted so that it can never again operate to
undermine a sitting Prime Minister.
If that procedure is opened up for examination and reform, the rest of
the party rule book could follow. There has been much friction over the
past week between constituency parties and their MPs over which
leadership candidate should be backed, most notably in North Tayside.
David McLetchie, president of the party's voluntary wing, the Scottish
Conservative and Unionist Association, argued that MPs had some duty to
listen to the fund-raisers, foot soldiers, and envelope-stuffers.
THE logic of that has a momentum of its own. The paternalist notion of
a party of political professionals and a separate wing of powerless
voluntary workers toiling like serfs at coffee mornings and whist drives
is an anachronism. If people are to carry a Conservative Party card in
this day and age they will demand a full say in how the party is run.
That process will preclude a future re-enactment of the strange farce
unfolding today at the House of Commons, a metaphor for much that is
wrong with British politics and journalism. It is a narrow, exclusive
game, played out by a tiny number of participants according to
near-incomprehensible rules, in a shrill and hysterical way, on a
limited, parochial stage in the London village of Westminster.

THERE are some who would allege that we live in a free country with
some severe limitations. This would be in agreement with Mark Loftus's
version of British democracy as represented in party politics (June 30).
Party politics with its elected representatives harks back to the
conditions of the nineteenth century when people were illiterate, had no
radio or TV, and could not travel about easily. Only their better
educated representatives could make the necessary decisions for them.
This is the sort of Government that John Major (and many more like
him) would like to perpetuate despite its utter obsolescence in a modern
state.
We should try to copy the Swiss with their much more open and direct
form of voting by the people in frequent referenda. The Swiss go to the
polls sometimes three to four times in the year and appear to be
responsible citizens in so doing. In a bigger country perhaps once or
twice a year is sufficient.
Electronic voting from the home is sometimes suggested but one feels
the polling booth allows the voter some time to chew things over.
Perhaps the system appeals more to the Scots than to the English?
In an independent Scotland a written constitution would indicate which
issues could be decided by the electorate and which would be decided by
the Council of Representatives.
Party politics with its confrontational inadequacies would be dropped
as these only constitute a red herring in political infighting.
It has been suggested that a Scottish parliament using direct voting
should consist of a 100 elected representatives on the council -- a
system of government much more accountable to the people than the
present UK situation.

IN her article Catch the masters young, Wendy Jack draws attention
rightly to the many bargains available to buy by discerning eyes from
the degree show at the Glasgow School of Art.
I can only be one of many former students of the GSA who, while
approving of students getting something in their hands at the end of
four or more years on short rations, will remember the situation
existing in the fifties when no diploma work could be sold and the
school had the right to retain all or part of any student's work without
payment for the School of Art collection.
As a penniless student who had the dubious compliment of having a
number of my paintings kept by the school, I would have been very
grateful for a token 50p for each work taken.
I should be interested, as must other students before and since, to
know if our paintings are still in the possession of the school.
It must be a considerable body of work by now. There is presumably a
catalogue of these works in the records of the school, which would be of
interest.

A STRAW in the wind for today's election of Conservative Party leader.
And it's an ill-wind for John Major.
The people who make that fabulous TV programme Wheel of Fortune keep a
list of famous names for the part of the show where contestants have to
spot the personality.
Updating the list for the forthcoming series, the ruthless Scottish TV
quizmakers have deleted both John and Norma Major. No, John Redwood has
not been added.
Screwing
the system
EVENTS, sorry alleged events, in that white BMW parked in a
side-street in Los Angeles have even produced a joke from the European
Parliament. Commenting on the #100,000 paid by the News of the Screws to
Divine Brown (not to mention the initial alleged #40), a Scots MEP was
heard to quote: ''Not the first time someone has made money out of a
grant from Europe.''
Near miss
WE read in Scottish Trade Union Review of a comment by Glasgow Central
Labour MP Mike Watson which comes into the
I-Mentioned-The-War-But-I-Think-I-Got-Away-With-It category. Greeting a
German delegation to the House of Commons shortly after VE-Day, he asked
conversationally: ''How did you travel over? By Luftwaffe?''
Raised stake
CHARLIE, an acquaintance of the Diary, being a nice chap, does his bit
to support the homeless. Every fortnight without fail he hands over 50p
to the same Big Issue vendor whose pitch is adjacent to a pub which
Charlie frequents.
While handing over his 50p, Charlie declines to take a copy of the
magazine. No disrespect to the Big Issue, he says, but it does not
include racing form or information about fixed odds betting.
The other week he handed over the usual 50p and walked on, only to be
hailed back with the words: ''Mister, it's gone up to 70p.''
Promises, promises
CELTIC appear to be planning more home-comings to Parkhead than Frank
Sinatra has had farewell concerts. The leaflet promoting season tickets
for Paradise offers the Gala Opening game on August 5. Followed by ''our
pre-season Home-Coming Game on August 10''.
Followed by their home-coming Premier League match on September 16. By
which time the biscuit tin might be loosened sufficiently for Celtic to
live up to another promise contained in the season-ticket hype: ''See
the new team -- Be witness to Celtic's new signings playing their first
match for the club.''
It would be cruel to mention that the club, in strict adherence to the
Trade Descriptions Act, under the heading of Europe say, ''Your chance
to see the first European home leg . . .'' So we won't mention it.
Leading from
behind
WE mentioned last week en passant in our Auld Alliance meanderings one
Captain Gracie (Retd) who was the feared and respected schoolteacher in
the Stirlingshire village of Fallin. Mr Jonathan Lord, now of Glasgow
but dux of Fallin School, 1964 (''I've still got the watch to prove
it''), has been in touch.
''This legendary figure ruled the tough mining village with a
Lochgelly tawse rather than rod of iron. Trembling infants would be
lined up for shoe and fingernail inspection and woe betide anyone who
failed to meet his exacting standards.
''On one occasion, 119 strokes of the tawse were administered at one
session in the school hall. I was the one keeping score at the back.
''Instructions couched in military terms were often misinterpreted.
One lad was clearly bewildered at the instruction: 'Boy! Depress that
switch!' He was able to comply only when one of his contemporaries
translated it into: 'Pit oan the light.'''
Captain Gracie has gone to the great classroom in the sky, or very
possibly the great boiler-room down below, but his memory lives on.
Quick witted
WE are sure this has never happened at any West of Scotland WASPish
golf club but will pass on the tale as it was told to us. The club
secretary is perturbed to see two chaps who are as black as two in the
morning park their car and proceed to take their clubs out of the boot.
He hurries down to ask them what they are doing in this private club.
They explain that they had written to make a booking to play the course.
The secretary says he will check.
The records reveal that they had indeed booked so he returns to
confirm that they had indeed written but through an error on his part,
for which he humbly apologises, there is no chance they can play that
day.
He recommends a perfectly adequate public golf course which is ''very
close and you could leave here and be on the first tee in 10 minutes''.
The black chaps are not impressed and one asks: ''Would it make any
difference if our names were Linford Christie and John Regis.''
''Of course,'' replies the secretary. ''If you were Linford Christie
and John Regis you could be on the first tee in five minutes.''
The Name Game
WE don't know exactly why but the Clydebank law firm Crozier,
Philpott, Platt &amp; Niblett makes us think of afternoon tea.

Sue Tranter learns that giving rein to youthful enthusiasm for mucking
out and grooming can lead the way to a stable job
THE walls are covered in rosettes, while bits and bridles garland the
windows. Instead of Take That posters these teenage bedrooms have
pin-ups of favourite ponies, or pictures of famous show jumping riders.
While an enthusiasm for mucking out stables and grooming may disappear
as children grow older, for many the idea of working with horses as a
career remains fixed.
More surpisingly, parents may be over-hasty in trying to dislodge such
ambitions on the grounds that they don't add up to a proper job or that
kids will eventually grow out of them.
One fact shouldn't be overlooked -- the increasing rise in the horse
population. It is reckoned that there are now more of them in Britain
than during the Victorian era, when horses were the standard form of
transport.
In a climate of shrinking career opportunities it's worth noting that
all these animals need to be cared for by someone, not to mention
attended to by vets, dentists, smiths, physiotherapists, and grooms.
Other professionals are in demand to teach would-be riders how to remain
firmly in the saddle.
The British Horse Association is quick to point out the similar
increase in equine sports. Along with the traditional show disciplines
there are new events growing up including ''horseback vaulting'' and,
for the less nimble, carriage-driving races.
Training in horse care and management is now much more formalised with
the addition of degree status, which combines equine and business
studies. The British Horse Society has a three-grade tier of
qualifications which can be acquired through certain colleges and
stables.
There is also a National Vocational Qualification which is offered
alongside the BHS grades at one private college devoted entirely to
matters four-legged.
Last year the Scottish College of Equestrian Studies in Motherwell
became the first of its kind in the central belt, and the first in
Scotland, to offer NVQ alongside BHS stage exams in a private package.
According to Linda Lafferty, head of equestrian training, it now has
45 students who work mainly on placement, with one day in three weeks as
a training day in the college and one day with a teacher who goes out to
students in the workplace.
The combination of the two types of certificate means students can
choose to go for the practical, hands-on assessment approach of the NVQ
system, which will offer a certificate comparable with training
standards in other walks of life, or the more exam-based BHS stages.
''It is an oportunity for people to get qualifications which could
help them move into a job with a yard, or just to get a better
understanding of horses and how to handle them,'' says Linda.
The college offers up to Level Four NVQ, the certificate level for
qualified instructors for both riding and horse management.
At the British Horse Society in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, Nichola
Gregory agrees that a career with horses is an increasingly attractive
option. From heavy horses such as the Clydesdale to the more elitist
sport of polo, the numbers of animals are growing.
She says the spin-off jobs, such as saddlery or even homoeopathy, are
also worth taking into account.
''A job at a stable is not a good choice for anyone who wants to make
a lot of money,'' she warns, ''but for someone who enjoys working with
animals it is rewarding. For others who work as grooms with top sporting
stables, it can mean the chance to travel the world.''
The society now runs an annual open day so that hopeful students can
see for themselves exactly what disciplines and choices are available.
At one of Scotland's most famous riding centres, Diana Marsden has
proved that a job in a stables is not just a sentence to ''shovel
muck'', as her parents once feared.
She had always wanted to work with horses, but was encouraged to take
secretarial training as a more sensible choice. Not put off, however,
she took a job with the Gleneagles Equestrian Centre when it first
opened and is now the manager.
She describes what is required from new trainees: ''We look for people
who can ride and have talent.''
''We are a training establishment and offer teaching in grooming,
riding and instruction for BHS examinations. While there are not that
many top jobs in the business, one choice is to go on to teach
equestrian studies in an agriculture-based college.''
Clearly from the humble ground work of mucking out, it is possible to
turn a youthful enthusiasm into a long-term job, with prospects for
those prepared to spend time in the classroom.

Gavin Bell reports how letters from the mother of Robert Louis
Stevenson to his childhood nurse are among a newly discovered hoard of
RLS material which includes photographs and rare early editions of his
works
IT had been a cruel winter. Deep in the Adirondack Mountains near the
Canadian border, a small family in a wooden house was suffering from a
variety of colds and rheumatic ailments. They had been cut off from the
outside world for three days by a snowstorm, and now a sudden thaw
threatened serious flooding.
An elderly woman in the household, writing of the harsh conditions in
a letter to a friend in Edinburgh, had one piece of good news to report.
Despite a slight cold, her sickly son was thriving in the Arctic weather
and was looking ''wonderfully well''.
The news came as a relief not only to the recipient of the letter, but
also to concerned friends in literary circles in Edinburgh and London.
For the writer was Margaret Isabella Stevenson, and the son to whom she
referred was known to an admiring public as Robert Louis Stevenson.
The letter, dated March 21, 1888, is one of several from Mrs Stevenson
which have been discovered among private papers in the possession of Mrs
Blanche Nicholson, the manager of a residential care centre in Ayrshire.
They were written to Alison Cunningham, Stevenson's nurse when he was a
child, and are believed to have been acquired after her death by a
relative of Mrs Nicholson.
Two of the letters are from Bournemouth, where Stevenson lived from
1884 to 1887, and another is from Samoa, where he spent the last five
years of his life and died at the age of 44 in 1894. None of the letters
has been published.
The collection inherited by Mrs Nicholson includes old photographs of
Stevenson and his family, and rare early editions of his works. However,
it is the letters from his mother that evoke the pathos of his constant
struggle against illness -- he suffered from tuberculosis since
childhood. His health, or lack of it, is a recurring theme.
In November, 1885, Stevenson's parents visited him in Bournemouth to
celebrate his 35th birthday. His mother wrote:
''This is my dear boy's birthday and I must send you a line to tell
you about him. He really looks wonderfully well considering his recent
illness -- a trifle thinner and a trifle paler than when you were here,
but as cheeky as ever and more able for work.''
Stevenson's good health was short-lived -- his mother inadvertently
infected him with a cold. But despite being confined indoors for most of
the three years he lived in Bournemouth, his creative spirit was
unimpaired. It was during this period that he wrote Kidnapped and the
Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
In 1886, his parents rented a furnished house at Bournemouth for the
winter to be near him. But as his birthday approached again, Stevenson
was ill at the home of a friend in London and his mother was becoming
anxious:
''I am sorry to say that Louis has never been able to come home yet,
though he is improving slowly. Dr Scott thinks he may be able to come
next week . . . We have determined to move up to London again tomorrow
and see dear Louis on his birthday -- then we shall find out whether he
is likely to be back at once, and shall either just come home with him
or take rooms near.''
The deep affection of Mrs Stevenson for her son, then at the height of
his powers, is apparent from another passage in the letter:
''I don't think I have had a greater disappointment than coming here
to be near my dear boy and finding him gone. It is worse than Jonah's
Gourd, I think! You see, we can't choose our cross, so we must just try
to fit our shoulders to the one that is sent us as best we may.''
For the sake of his precarious health, Stevenson spent the winter of
1887-88 at a sanatorium for consumptives near Saranac Lake in New York
State. It was from there that his mother wrote of violent storms, and
illness dogging the family:
''Here we were shut off from the outer world for three days and had a
snow fall of 2[1/2] feet but fortunately we had no wind and so suffered
much less than many of our neighbours. I have had a little cold hanging
about me ever since I came home from Boston and am now in quarantine and
not allowed to be in the same room with Louis. I have been as hoarse as
a crow but today I am a good deal better, and as we have a thaw and very
mild weather I hope I may soon be quite well . . . Louis has had a
slight cold too and has not been out since this storm began but he is
really wonderfully well for him.''
Mrs Stevenson attributed her son's relative good health in part to an
exotic remedy called Koumiss, which she declared was ''certainly
agreeing with him and fattening him''. The potion was a fermented liquor
prepared by Tartars from mare's milk, which was deemed to be beneficial
to consumptives.
However, his American wife, Fanny, had a bad attack of rheumatism, and
their doctor observed that she was ''a perfect dungeon of ailments''.
The letter said Fanny would leave for California as soon as she was well
enough, and the rest of the family would ''go off for a change'' about
the middle of April. It concluded: ''Further than that our plans are at
present in a state of chaos.''
What Mrs Stevenson did not mention was that during the long winter
nights at Saranac, the family had discussed the possibility of a
yachting cruise. A few days later Fanny left for San Francisco, where
she found a yacht suitable for charter, and three months after that the
family embarked on a voyage to the South Seas. Stevenson never returned
to Europe.
The last letter was written from Samoa on October 23, 1892. It is
incomplete, comprising four pages -- the remaining two pages are in the
rare book and manuscript library at Yale University. A fragment has been
torn off, but it is clear from the surviving portion that RLS was still
plagued by illness:
''Louis . . . the worst part . . . that he feels wretched . . . can't
work and is always trying to begin a new book. If he does not improve
soon he must go away for a trip somewhere.''
The letter was broken off, and then added to on November 1 when Mrs
Stevenson had better news:
''I am thankful to tell you that Louis seems all right again and the
doctor says he does not need a change.''
He had, however, barely two years to live.
Miss Cunningham, the lady to whom the letters were addressed, died in
Edinburgh in July, 1913, at the age of 92. A measure of Stevenson's
affection for her was his dedication of The Child's Garden of Verses, in
which he described her as ''The angel of my infant life''.
One of the books discovered with the letters is of particular
interest. It is Miss Cunningham's personal copy of The Pocket RLS, a
selection of passages from his works, in which annotations indicate her
favourite aphorisms by the author she nursed as a sick child.
One is from Books which have influenced me: ''When you have read, you
carry away with you a memory of the man himself; it is as though you had
touched a loyal hand, looked into brave eyes, and made a noble friend;
there is another bond on you thenceforward, binding you to life and to
the love of virtue.''
Another is from his youthful essays in Virginibus Puerisque: ''Our
affections and beliefs are wiser than we; the best that is in us is
better than we can understand; for it is grounded beyond experience, and
guides us, blindfold but safe, from one age on to another.''

Kirsty Scott reports that a bad year for rail travellers is about to
get worse --and some of the after-effects of the looming Aslef dispute
could be permanent
WHAT has proved to be an annus horribilis for Britain's beleaguered
rail system and its increasingly frustrated customers will get worse a
week from today. That's when the train drivers' union, Aslef, plans to
stage the first of the 24-hour stoppages which will bring the rail
network across the UK to a virtual standstill -- again.
Privatisation, signal workers, snow, sunshine, leaves, losses,
compensation, ghost trains, fallout over the West Highland Line,
executive departures, and now striking train drivers -- there has hardly
been a week over the past 18 months when the rail industry has not been
in the headlines in some form or another.
Now observers are split over whether the latest dispute will be an
acute political embarrassment for rail officials and the Government or
offer camouflage to push ahead with privatisation and blame cuts in
services or cock-ups on the industrial action.
No-one is in any doubt, however, that the latest crisis will further
alienate a public already heartily sick of problems in the industry.
Privately, at least one rail operator has said that they can see the day
when the public will ask if they really need a rail service after all.
Aslef deny that they are trying to disrupt privatisation or score
political points with the dispute. They admit, however, that rail
officials might be able to use the industrial action as a lever to
promote privatisation plans.
Aslef national spokesman John Richards said their fight was all about
money. ''It's because our members have taken five pay cuts; this is the
fifth they have been offered since 1980. I think they are exceedingly
angry. They are very frustrated.''
The union has 1500 members in Scotland and Scottish district secretary
Patrick O'Connor said they will fight for as long as it takes to get an
adequate pay settlement.
''This dispute will be more effective than the signal workers dispute
because while they had supervisors who went in and worked the signal
boxes no-one can go in and drive a train.''
While British Rail may consider the Aslef dispute an attempt to
scupper privatisation, Mr O'Connor said the union feels it has been
provoked into taking action and believes rail officials may use the
crisis to pass off some of privatisation's more unpalatable proposals.
Meanwhile, campaigners for rural lines have become increasingly
concerned that industrial action could give rail officials the leverage
they needed to cut jobs and services. There are also fears that the
Edinburgh to Inverness line, and even the Glasgow to Edinburgh service,
could be affected to varying degrees.
For ScotRail and the other rail operators the dispute could not have
come at a worse time, as they are just beginning to shore up revenue
levels after the fall-off from the signal workers dispute last summer.
The industry lost some #200m from that dispute, with ScotRail's bill
totalled at #9.8m. In addition, in April of this year it was revealed
that ScotRail had to compensate thousands of passengers after a
disastrous year for punctuality -- which it then blamed on the signal
workers dispute.
A ScotRail spokeswoman last night declined to comment on the Aslef
decision or implications for privatisation, jobs and services.
Labour's rail spokesman, Henry McLeish, said they hoped the matter
could be resolved between the rail unions and British Rail management.
For the customers, meanwhile, the Aslef action may be the last straw,
although union officials say they hope the public will back them.
Over at the Rail Users Consultative Committee, spokesman Sean O'Neill
said it could prove to be one problem too many for some rail users.
''The railways had a hard time with the 16-week signal workers'
dispute,'' he said. ''They have just about emerged from that and are
about getting their revenues back on budget with a lot of successful
promotional offers. I understand that people's confidence in the
reliability of railways has been affected. It takes a lot of goodwill
for people to use the railways often.
''One of the railway operators said to us there may be a day when the
public wake up and realise they could do without the railways
altogether.''

THE Queen went racing on Scottish turf yesterday, for what was thought
to be the first time in 50 years.
Sadly, despite the sunshine, she backed a loser when her horse,
Piquant, trailed in second last in the second race of the afternoon at
Musselburgh, the East Lothian District Council Handicap.
The Queen was at the racecourse -- the oldest in Scotland -- to open a
new #500,000 stand, named the Queen's Stand.
The hospitality stand is part of a #1m redevelopment recently
completed by the Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee, which has seen the
old grandstand and bars and restaurants refitted. New office and canteen
facilities have also been provided for the stable lads.
The Queen, on her first day of the traditional week north of the
Border, watched her horse -- ridden by jockey Jason Weaver in regal
purple, scarlet and gold -- through opera-glasses. She appeared
unaffected by the race disappointment as she smiled and waved to the
small crowd which greeted her in the late afternoon sunshine.
Earlier, a 100-strong guard of honour welcomed the Queen to the
traditional Ceremony of the Keys at the Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Lord Provost of
Edinburgh, Norman Irons, the Queen later visited the city centre HQ of
the Bank of Scotland, which is celebrating its tercentenary. She was
shown through the bank's archive and met staff.
Later, she visited Edinburgh Castle, where she formally opened the new
Royal Scots Dragoon Guards' Museum, and went on a conducted tour of the
stronghold.
Meanwhile, Prince Charles was touring the Borders, where he visited
Netherdale, home of Gala Rugby Club, the auction mart at Newtown St
Boswell's, and the headquarters of Borders Regional Council.
In the afternoon he focused on Jedburgh, with a tour of the premises
of Mainetti, based in the Borders for 21 years.

DEVELOPMENTS encroaching on a former Lanarkshire mining village have
left residents unable to sell their homes, it was claimed yesterday.
Within the past four years, Mrs Muriel King has seen three open-cast
mines developed within half-a-mile of her home in South Blair, near
Harthill, and planning permission granted for a racing circuit within
half a mile.
Now members of the Hirst Road Residents' Association are campaigning
against proposals to extend Tam's Loup quarry to within 65 metres of
their 20 homes.
''The blasting would be taking place about 50 metres away from our
front doors. If it gets planning permission it would mean there would be
a hole one-mile long and about 200ft deep instead of a range of hills
and fields, and an old farmhouse,'' said Mrs King, secretary of the
residents' association.
She said the blasting was their foremost concern because no-one could
give them a 100% safety guarantee. Residents were also worried about
health problems and stress to elderly people, and the likely increase in
traffic, and quarry-related dust and dirt.
''Everybody that moved here was under the misapprehension that the
quarry only had three to five years left to run,'' she said.
But according to Motherwell District Council, the applicant Pioneer
Asphalt (UK) Ltd, wants to extend the quarry westwards, and extract
around 800,000 tonnes of whinstone and quartz-dollarite, used mainly in
roadbuilding, over the next 15 years.
Mr Andrew Golder of Pioneer Asphalt at Harthill could not be contacted
yesterday for comment.
Mrs King said: ''One of the main things is that our countryside is
being devastated, and nobody in power seems to do anything about it. We
are just a small number of people, and we do not have the voice that a
larger group would have.
''We can't sell our homes, for a start, and although we know this is
not a planning issue it is a real problem.
''We have just found out that if the quarry extension gets the
go-ahead our building insurance will rocket because the blasting will be
so close to our homes.''
Residents complain that the dust and dirt spread by the lorries from
the existing quarry mean that they dare not open windows. They fear that
if a new road is built for the extension to the quarry, the situation
will considerably worsen.
Other objectors to the plan are Central Scotland Countryside Trust,
and Harthill Community Council.
District Councillor Alex Allen said he was trying to organise a site
visit by members of Motherwell District Council's planning committee
before it meets to discuss the application.
The residents' representative on Strathclyde region, Councillor James
Burns, said that the region had no remit in this particular application,
but he would continue to press its road engineers to look at the impact
on traffic.
Motherwell's planning committee is not likely to consider the
application until next month at the earliest.

<HEADLINE>#250,000 lost on MS link. Rail worker fails to prove accident worsened illness</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BRUCE MCKAIN LAW CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A FORMER railway worker, who now spends much of his time in a
wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis, has lost out on damages of
about #250,000.
Hugh Bryce failed in his bid to prove that his condition was made
worse by an accident at work.
He has been awarded damages of #13,000, but even this is expected to
be claimed by the Government's controversial Compensation Recovery Unit
which claws back benefits paid to claimants while they are ill.
Mr Bryce was working as a track machineman for BR on November 5, 1989,
at Inverness Station, dismantling a ballast cleaner. At one stage his
protective helmet fell off because the chin strap was not secure and he
struck his head on a piece of machinery.
After the incident Mr Bryce, of Roebank Street, Dennistoun, Glasgow,
felt drowsy, but completed the job. Two days later he had an apparent
epileptic seizure and was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He received
anti-convulsant therapy and an X-ray showed a skull fracture.
He is now suffering from multiple sclerosis and in a damages action at
the Court of Session sued for #750,000.
He was awarded damages of #13,000 after Lord Prosser decided he had
failed to prove any link between the railway accident and the MS. The
#13,000 was for loss of wages and pain and suffering, such as the
seizures, which were the immediate aftermath of the accident.
Had Mr Bryce been able to establish the link between the accident and
his condition, he could have expected to receive damages of about
#250,000.
He appealed to three judges and Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, who
heard the case with Lords McCluskey and Morison, said that Mr Bryce was
now ''substantially disabled'' and had to spend much of his time in a
wheelchair.
Before the accident he had shown symptoms which, with hindsight,
indicated MS, although at the time they appeared to be caused by a back
problem.
Two medical experts who had given evidence at the original hearing
took the view that by November 1990 Mr Bryce already had MS, and Lord
Prosser had been unable to pinpoint the railway accident the year before
as the cause of the worsening of his condition.
Lord Ross said there was no dispute that trauma of that kind could
cause a worsening in the condition of someone already suffering from MS.
The critical question for the appeal court was whether the deterioration
in the MS was in fact due to the trauma Mr Bryce had suffered in his
accident in November 1989.
Two medical experts had given differing evidence at the original
hearing. One said Mr Bryce's condition could have been expected to get
worse irrespective of the accident at work.
The other took the view that the deterioration was something which,
without the accident, was abnormal and unexpected, since the MS had
apparently not struck until Mr Bryce was in his late 30s. The younger
the patient was at the outset of the condition, the worse the course of
the disease was likely to be.
The evidence of the second doctor was that the MS was signficantly
more severe than he would have expected had there been no accident.
Lord Ross said there was a clear confict between the two medical
witnesses which Lord Prosser had to resolve.
The appeal court was satisfied that Lord Prosser had been entitled to
decide that there was no probable connection between the 1989 trauma and
Mr Bryce's MS.
They refused his appeal.

BUSINESSES were yesterday urged to take advantage of the opportunities
offered to Scotland by the information superhighway.
The Trade and Technology Minister, Mr Ian Taylor, told a conference in
Glasgow, the first event of its kind to be staged by the Government in
the UK, that Scotland's geographical character and hi-tech expertise
offered unique possibilities.
Mr Taylor said: ''The great application of the new technology is that
no area is marginalised.
''There is a tremendous opportunity for Scotland''.
Mr George Kynoch, the Scottish Industry Minister, urged small and
medium businesses to familiarise themselves with the systems now
available to transfer information.
He said: ''The potential for superhighways to be exploited as a
business tool in order to enhance the competitiveness of our business
community is vast and largely untapped.''
Mr Kynoch highlighted the integrated systems digital network which
links 80% of businesses and people in the Highlands via computer, and a
plan by Atlantic Telecom to broadcast a digital wireless network in
Glasgow, as examples of innovation.
The conference also heard that Internet usage in the UK was expanding
faster than in the US.

* Disciplinary action has been taken against 18 young offenders who
caused extensive damage in Edinburgh's Saughton Prison on Sunday, writes
James Freeman, Home Affairs Correspondent.
The youths refused to return to their cells at lock-up time at 9.30pm
and ran amok in the A Hall, smashing furniture and windows. Extra staff
were drafted in, but it took three hours before order was restored.
Damage was being assessed at the jail yesterday as an internal
investigation began. Prisoners in the affected hall were locked in their
cells yesterday but normality was restored by late afternoon. The rest
of the prison operated normally.
Saughton Prison is 36% overcrowded in general terms with particular
overcrowding in the remand wing where 85 young offenders and 103 adults
are being held.
The Scottish system is suffering general overcrowding of 9%, with a
very high number of localised remand prisoners. Only last week the
prison reform organisation, Sacro, drew attention to this in relation to
recent suicides at Cornton Vale prison.

Seoul, Monday
A DOGGED army of volunteers worked into a fifth successive night in
the fading hope that survivors could be found at Seoul's collapsed
department store.
However with no-one found alive for 48 hours, workers and tearful
relatives at the disaster site were resigning themselves to the
likelihood that the hundreds of people believed missing in the wreckage
were now dead.
Rescuers retrieved five bodies, bringing the death toll to 112, with
381 people still missing five days after the collapse of the Sampoong
Department Store.
More than 200 of the 900 people injured in the disaster were in
serious condition.
Rescuers brought in heavy machinery for the first time to remove
chunks of steel and concrete from rubble of the five-storey building.
Relatives of the missing had demanded the use of heavy gear to speed
the search.--Reuter.

THE Scottish Council for Civil Liberties has lodged a complaint with
the United Nations alleging that the Government is ignoring civil and
political rights in Scotland.
The SCCL highlights as special causes for concern: high suicide rates
in prisons; ''restrictive'' procedures for dealing with miscarriages of
justice; ''extensive'' telephone metering by police; the use of city
centre surveillance cameras; and new laws on the right to assemble.
Its report has been drawn up to challenge the Government response on
the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR) in the UK.
A UN hearing is due to take place in Geneva on July 20 at which the
Government will be questioned on its response to the Covenant.
The SCCL claims: ''The Government's report shows that civil and
political rights in Scotland are ignored.
''The Government has not implemented any effective domestic remedies
to protect the individual against breaches of the ICCPR. Any person who
has suffered an infringement of a right contained in the ICCPR cannot go
to court in Scotland to obtain redress.''
On alleged miscarriages of justice, the SCCL says: ''The Scottish
criminal justice system has many problems. Of utmost concern are the
extremely restrictive procedures available to deal with miscarriages of
justice.
''Available remedies for overturning unsafe convictions that are not
rectified on appeal are remote, inaccessible, and inadequate.
''Practices such as the extensive use of telephone metering by the
Scottish police and the development of surveillance camera schemes
throughout many Scottish towns and cities, unchecked by any legislative
controls, make it increasingly necessary for the individual to have
access to an effective domestic remedy should his or her right to
privacy be infringed.''
A committee headed by Professor Stewart Sutherland has been set up by
the Government to look into how the Scottish legal system deals with
alleged miscarriages of justice.

Paris, Monday
FRENCH President Jacques Chirac told Jordan's King Hussein today that
the European Union wanted a bigger political role in the Middle East
since it was now the largest aid contributor to the region.
Chirac has delivered a similar message to a series of Arab and Israeli
visitors since taking office on May 17. The United States has long been
the dominant power in the Middle East.
''In an exceptionally warm meeting with the king, the president
recalled that Europe was the main aid donor to the area, contributing
three times the amount given by the United States,'' said Chirac's
spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna.
She told reporters that European states contributed #20.6bn in aid
compared to #6000m given by Washington in 1993, the last year for which
comparisons were available.
''He said the Europeans were ready to commit themselves even further
financially but they believed they deserved also to be involved
politically and to play a more important role in the region,'' she
added.
The king said he discussed lifting UN sanctions against Iraq with
Chirac.
''There is a reality in this world, and a growing one, of people
saying enough is enough,'' he said.
The French leader replied that Iraq must first comply with
international conditions on disarmament and respect for UN resolutions
for the sanctions to be lifted.
In developments in the Middle East peace process, an Israeli official
said Syria had today dropped its demand for symmetry in security
arrangements with Israel and proposed a formula for demilitarisation as
part of an overall peace deal.
There was no indication whether the new formula was acceptable to
Israel.
Cabinet secretary Shmuel Hollander, reporting on a briefing today,
said that Israeli army chief Lieutenat-General Amnon Shahak had proposed
a Syrian demilitarisation of six miles for every 3.6 miles by Israel.
However Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told fellow Labour party members
today that there had been no real breakthrough in three days of talks
between the chiefs of the Israeli and Syrian armies in Washington last
week.--Reuter.

Oswiecim, Monday
A TRAIN today set out from Auschwitz, scene of this century's darkest
horrors, to cross Europe with the message that young people reject race
hate and bigotry.
It was among six such trains leaving from around the continent to
combat racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and intolerance, as part of a
youth campaign initiated by the Council of Europe with the slogan: ''all
different, all equal''.
''The swastika is seen in some places again,'' said campaign
co-ordinator Mireille Paulus-Levy. He was speaking at the railway
station of the Polish town where Nazi Germany murdered 1.5 million
people, mostly Jews, brought by train from across Europe.
Events in former Yugoslavia showed that for some, ethnicity and blood
were again seen as absolute values, she said.
Explaining why European heads of state and government had launched the
campaign in 1993, she said: ''In Germany Turks are burned, in France
Arabs are drowned and stabbed in the back. In Austria, Italy, and
central Europe, gipsies are killed.''
The European Youth Trains, stopping at big stations on their way to be
met by crowds of people, will promote discussions, theatre workshops,
play music, and educate. They are carrying hundreds of people from 42
countries.
On July 9 the trains from Dublin, Algericas, Athens, Stockholm,
Warsaw, and Oswiecim -- Auschwitz in German -- will converge on
Strasbourg for the start of a European Youth Week.
''The aim is to enable thousands of young Europeans to reaffirm their
determination to live in a Europe based on peace and understanding
between the nations, where each human being's dignity is recognised,''
organisers said.
Each of the trains, setting out simultaneously, has a different theme.
The one from Oswiecim carries pictures and films supplied by the
European Jewish Congress, including some portraying the
Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp complex that Nazi occupiers built to kill
Jews, Poles, gipsies, and other people.
Unlike the others, this Train of Collective European Memory carries no
passengers.
There are just a few people to help visitors, at stops in Budapest,
Prague, Berlin, and Strasbourg to grasp its chilling exhibition on
Second World War genocide and its legacy.
The Warsaw train, entitled Freedom and Liberation, is carrying people
from countries of the former Soviet Union and its satellites. They will
encourage discussion of the problems of democratic development in
post-communist Europe.
The train from Algericas in Spain will stress co-operation between
Europe and North Africa, focusing on the problems of immigrants.
The train from Dublin is dealing with European unity. The one from
Stockholm, carrying people from Scandinavia and the Baltic states, will
promote cultural freedom. The Athens train focuses on beliefs and
ideologies.--Reuter.

Grozny, Monday
CHECHEN rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev has said he will bow to Russian
demands for his resignation if Moscow recognises Chechnya's
independence.
Arkady Volsky, deputy head of the Russian delegation to Chechen peace
talks, secretly met Dudayev in the southern Chechen mountains. He quoted
the rebel leader as saying: ''I agree to resign with the Cabinet of
Ministers if the sovereignty of Chechnya is recognised.''
Volsky, speaking in the capital Grozny, did not say how Russia was
likely to respond to Dudayev's offer.
He said Russia had proposed recognising Chechen sovereignty ''based on
the Russian constitution'' -- a vague term that clearly stops short of
the full independence the Chechens have been fighting for.
Chechen delegation head Usman Imayev was against referring to the
Russian constitution in any peace agreement, Tass reported. Under the
Russian constitution, Chechnya is part of Russia.
Moscow, which has previously refused to talk to Dudayev and issued an
arrest warrant for him, was forced into talking peace with the rebels
after a shock raid by hostage-taking Chechen guerrillas on the southern
town of Budennovsk last month.
Russia has proposed a ''zero option'' which would involve the
resignations of Dudayev and the heads of Chechnya's Moscow-installed
government to pave the way for elections later this year.
Russian news agencies said Volsky had asked Dudayev yesterday to bow
to the zero option or to leave Chechnya and the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
The rebels have threatened fresh raids inside Russia if the war is not
ended peacefully. Talks are due to resume on Thursday.--Reuter.

THE future of a Lanarkshire junior football club could be resolved
next week after an acrimonious dispute which has lasted more than six
months and cost thousands of pounds in legal fees.
Shotts Bon Accord, who are managed by Lisbon Lion John Clark and are
one of the best-known sides in the junior game, last week were banned
sine die by their regional league.
The club, who have twice gone to the Court of Session to overturn
decisions by the Central League committee, will appeal to the Scottish
Junior Football Association at a special meeting next Wednesday.
If that move fails, it seems likely that Shotts will take their case
to the full Scottish Football Association in an attempt to keep the club
in existence.
Mr Tom Johnston, assistant secretary of the SJFA, yesterday declined
to discuss the matter in detail before next week's appeal, but confirmed
that the seriousness of the situation was unprecedented in Scottish
junior football history.
The tortuous dispute originated on Hogmanay last year when Shotts
pulled out of a cup-tie after claiming eight of their players had flu
and were unable to play.
Two months later, the club were fined #500 and thrown out of the cup
after Central League officials said there was ''conflicting evidence''
over the validity of the players' medical certificates.
Shotts then successfully applied for an interim interdict to prevent
their cup opponents taking part in the next round, a move which forced
the scrapping of the cup competition, and led to a charge that Shotts
had breached the league's constitution by resorting to the courts
without exhausting internal league procedures.
Last week, their fellow clubs voted 26-11 to impose the suspension,
rejecting an alternative proposal to levy a hefty fine.
Central League general secretary Scott Robertson declined to comment
yesterday while Shotts' manager John Clark would say only: ''There's
nothing been done wrong at this club.''
However, the team's local MP, Dr John Reid, accused the authorities of
being ''tinpot dictators'' and having a ''vindictive'' attitude towards
Shotts.

CAMPAIGNERS against low pay yesterday unveiled a new report intended
to bolster the case for a UK national minimum wage.
The document cites evidence from the United States in an attempt to
disprove the notion that forcing employers to adopt a minimum wage
structure will automatically result in job losses. That argument has
been consistently deployed by Government Ministers in their opposition
to a minimum wage policy and in their decision to scrap wages councils
two years ago.
Employment Minister Philip Oppenheim has said such a policy could cost
between 750,000 and two million jobs.
However, report author Mr Peter Kelly, a research officer with the
Scottish Low Pay Unit, insisted yesterday that experience from other
countries contradicted the Government case.
He said the rate of employment growth in six other countries which had
a form of minimum wage -- Australia, Canada, Spain, France, Belgium, and
the US -- was higher than in the UK.
The report focuses on evidence from a US study where there is a
federal minimum wage, supplemented in some cases by individual states.
Two American researchers compared employment levels in 400 fast-food
restaurants in New Jersey where there had been a state increase of about
50 cents an hour, and in Pennsylvania where the federal minimum applied.
They found no suggestion that the wage rise resulted in job losses in
New Jersey which actually showed an expansion of employment. At the
restaurants which were forced to pay the increase, instead of adding it
voluntarily, the rate of jobs growth was higher.
Mr Kelly said: ''This evidence shows that, in low wage labour markets
where a minimum wage would have its real impact, the effect on
unemployment has been at worst negligible and, at best, there have even
been small increases in employment.''
The low pay unit and the STUC are campaigning for a minimum rate of
pay of #4.15 per hour, about half of average male earnings. If
introduced, this would benefit 400,000 Scottish workers, many of them
part-time.

degree from the University of Dundee, where he is student rector.
He will be made an honorary Doctor of Laws at a graduation ceremony on

His agent, Ms Joanna Foster, said: ''Stephen is fulfilling a
long-standing engagement and will attend the ceremony in person.
''He will not be making any statement and will not be talking to the
press. It is a private engagement.''
Fry went into hiding after leaving the Simon Gray play Cell Mates, and
has maintained a low profile ever since.
A university spokeswoman said: ''Stephen has been a very hard working
rector for the students, and is held in very high regard by them.''

A SCOTS family, whose round-the-world trip in a horse-drawn
Romany-style caravan turned into a nightmare when they became trapped in
Mongolia, has been given permission to leave the country after six
months.
Mr David Grant, 53, and his wife, Kate, who sold their Orkney cottage
nearly five years ago to make the trip with their three children, were
halted when Mr Grant was convicted of causing an eye injury to a man
with a shot from a catapult.
He was given a suspended sentence in May but could not leave the
country as his victim was claiming damages.
Mrs Grant, who has been staying with her father near Southampton after
flying back to Britain to rally support for her husband, was told
yesterday that an agreement had been reached and her husband and their
children could now leave Mongolia.
Mrs Grant, 44 today, said: ''It's the best birthday present I could
have.''
Her husband and children, Torcuil, 15, Eilidh, 13, and Fionn, 10,
together with their caravan and horse, will leave by train at the end of
this week for China, where she will join them to continue their journey.
Despite the setback, the family plans to continue with its trip. Mrs
Grant said: ''This hasn't put us off and we don't want to come back.
Having gone as far as we have, it would be crazy to.''
The family denies responsibility for the man's injury.
The Grants say the incident arose when three drunks tried to steal
their horse and Eilidh fired a warning shot from a catapult. Only later
did one of the men claim he had been hit. Since the incident, Mr Grant
and his children have been staying in an apartment.
Before he left, Mr Grant had been a broch keeper: looking after a
prehistoric round tower.

Paris, Monday
FRENCH armed forces chief Admiral Jacques Lanxade today accused
Croatia and Bosnia of preventing British soldiers from joining a rapid
reaction force set up to respond to Serb attacks against UN
peacekeepers.
''Croatia at this moment is preventing our British friends from
landing at Ploce, and we have a number of unresolved difficulties with
the deployment of French soldiers in Bosnia,'' Lanxade said.
A radio report claimed Bosnian Croat border police had twice turned
back a column of vehicles carrying French forces trying to enter Bosnia
at the weekend.
Lanxade asked questioners what was preventing the reaction force from
moving from the marshalling area of Tomislav Grad to Kiseljac, its
future base.
''It is the Bosnian Muslims and the Croats,'' he responded after
giving a lecture at the Institute for International Relations in Paris.
He added that he expected both problems to be resolved soon because it
was in the interests of both Croatia and Bosnia to allow the force to
deploy.
''But currently the movements of the force are heavily constrained, to
say the least,'' he said.
The reaction force was created in response to the seizure of hundreds
of UN hostages by the Bosnian Serbs after Nato air strikes in May.
However the UN has yet to decide exactly what it wants the force to
do, having set it up in the wake of Bosnian Serb hostage-taking of UN
troops last month.
Even in Sarajevo the UN acknowledges that it has more troops than
tasks for them to perform and is thinking of cutting the number of
peacekeeping troops in the Bosnian capital.
UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Coward said there was little to
do for some of the 5000 soldiers in and around the city since shipments
of humanitarian aid had dried up.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, former commander of UN
troops in Bosnia, warned that any pull-out of United Nations
peacekeepers would be a catastrophe for Bosnia, leading to slaughter or
mass displacement of people.
Speaking in Wellington, New Zealand, General Rose defended the
achievements of the 23,000-strong UN Protection Force, saying it had
delivered humanitarian aid to 2.7 million people last year who would
otherwise have starved.
''If the UN pulled out, it would be a catastrophe, in my opinion, for
the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' he said.
''The enclaves would certainly be over-run and their populations
either slaughtered or dispersed.''
Further evidence of the need for the humanitarian mission of the UN in
Bosnia came from the UN's top refugee official, Sadako Ogata.
On a visit to Philadelphia in the US to receive the annual Liberty
Medal for contributions to the principles of freedom, she warned that
the isolated Bosnian enclave of Bihac was threatened with widespread
starvation.
''Bihac is coming pretty close to a possible starvation area,'' said
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. ''It is man-made starvation.''
Aid workers reported last week the deaths by starvation of an elderly
man and a three-year-old boy in Bihac, a mostly Muslim enclave of
200,000 and UN-proclaimed ''safe area'' which has been cut off from
regular aid supplies for more than a year.--Reuter.

THE headmaster of Fettes College yesterday accused a small group of
''disaffected ex-parents'' of launching a vendetta against the Edinburgh
public school.
Mr Malcom Thyne said initial reports alleging bullying and sexual
assault contained distortions and inaccuracies.
In a prepared statement, he said: ''In September 1992, in accordance
with our established disciplinary procedures, it was necessary for me to
ask six boys to leave the school following an incident with cannabis.
Five of these boys accepted their punishments as being appropriate.
''Since that time, there has been a sustained campaign by a tiny group
of disaffected ex-parents which has been designed to cause embarrassment
to the school.
''We are vigorously opposed to the use of drugs, sexual misconduct,
and bullying, and there is no intention to change our stance on these
important issues, regardless of how long this unfortunate vendetta
continues,'' he said.
A group of parents and former pupils have made written submissions to
the Earl of Mar and Kellie and other peers, who are separately piloting
the Children (Scotland) Bill through the Lords. It reaches its report
stage tomorrow.
The earl, a qualififed social worker with 20 years' experience, said
he would be seeking to make inspections of private schools routine and,
additionally, in response to any reasonable complaint. He said annual
school inspections might make the system too inflexible. The aim of the
Bill, which has all-party support, was to give protection to all
children in whatever environment.
Asked about the specific allegations relating to Fettes, the earl
said: ''Many of my colleagues have also received details of these
allegations. It strikes me as being a very unhappy situation.''
Mr Thyne said Fettes, which last received a general inspection in
1981, had experienced a growth in pupil numbers when boarding schools
were going through demanding times.
''I have informed the Scottish Office Education Department that we
shall welcome having an inspection as soon as they are able to include
us in their normal programme of visits to independent schools.''

HEALTH unions representing some 650,000 NHS workers are to proceed
with industrial action ballots following the breakdown of pay talks last
night.
The third session of negotiations failed to break the deadlock over
the Government's insistence on offering only 1% centrally with the
prospect of up to a further 2% by way of local negotiations.
The unions are pressing for a 3% national increase and a commitment to
the continuation of centralised bargaining.
Mr Bob Abberley, head of health for Unison, which has 440,000 members
employed by the NHS, said he was deeply disappointed at the breakdown.
Although progress was made on some issues, the management side's
inability to move in this year's pay increase, or make any commitments
about a national award next year, had made agreement impossible, he
said.
The Government and NHS trusts had totally failed to convince health
staffs of the merits of local pay.
Twelve health unions will now proceed with their industrial action
ballots which are expected to take place throughout next month, with the
results expected in early September. Between now and then the unions,
which are all committed to industrial action without harming patients,
will be devising tactics.
Health Minister Gerry Malone said he was disappointed about the
collapse of the talks and accused the unions of putting their own
interests above those of the staff they represent.
He claimed that more than 90% of the 500 NHS trusts had now offered
local rises of 3% or above to their nursing staff and this provided
clear evidence that local pay was working and offers were fair.
''Staff throughout the country are wanting to see an end to this
dispute so they can pick these offers up. It is their national leaders
who are stopping this happening,'' he added.
The unions' fight against locally determined pay was severely
undermined last Friday when the Royal College of Midwives accepted a 1%
national award to be topped up in local negotiations.
The Royal College of Nursing, which last week ditched its no-strike
clause, had already broken ranks with the other unions and health
associations in order to go its own way -- its leaders apparently
prepared to accept a combination of central and local negotiations so
long as they add up to 3%.

THE involvement of Mr Gregor Mackay, political adviser to Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang, in Mr Major's Tory Party leadership campaign was
questioned in the Commons yesterday.
Raising the issue at Question Time, Labour's Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow)
asked junior Public Service Minister John Horam: ''Is it quite proper
that Gregor Mackay, an official in the Scottish Office, paid out of the
public purse, should work in the office of one of the candidates for the
leadership of a political party?''
Mr Dalyell called for the Civil Service Code of Conduct to make such
matters ''very precise''.
Mr Horam replied: ''There is a Code of Conduct which makes it plain
people should not indulge in these purely party political activities
while they are paid from public funds.''
To Labour jeers, he said: ''Mr Mackay is on leave at the moment.''
A spokeswoman at Conservative Central Office said that members of
staff who were also working for Mr Major's campaign were either taking
holiday time or unpaid leave to do so.

THE parents of Francesca Dallaglio, a victim of the Marchioness
pleasure boat disaster on the Thames six years ago, were yesterday
awarded #33,930 damages.
However, Mr Vincenzo Dallaglio, 60, and his wife, Eileen, 57, of
Barnes, south-west London, were bitterly disappointed after learning
that the award would probably all be used for legal costs.
The couple won the damages against the owners of the Marchioness and
of the dredger Bowbelle, which collided with her near Southwark Bridge
on August 20, 1989, with the loss of 51 lives, including that of their
19-year-old ballerina daughter.
Mr Justice Latham heard in the High Court that the boat owners had
made a pre-trial settlement offer of #50,000.
Because the offer was greater than the final award, the Dallaglios
were ordered to pay the defence costs incurred since, including the
expense of a three-day court hearing.
Mrs Dallaglio said outside court it was ''morally wrong'' that she and
her husband should lose their award, leaving the boat owners to ''get
away with it scot-free''.
The owners of the two vessels admitted liability for damages five
years ago and the judge was asked only to assess how much the parents
should be awarded for the loss of their daughter's financial support.
As is usual in such cases, he was not told of the pre-trial offer
until after his judgment.
Francesca was among the party-goers at an all-night disco and birthday
celebration aboard the Marchioness. It had only just begun when disaster
struck. Most of those on the dance floor perished. Eighty others, mostly
on deck, were rescued.
The Dallaglios -- both retired through ill health -- had told the
judge that Francesca was on the brink of a glittering career in dance
and theatre for which they had groomed her at great financial sacrifice.
The judge said Francesca was a ''lovely, greatly talented girl'' who
had just obtained her first job after leaving Elmhurst, a vocational
dance and drama school in Surrey.
She was very close to her parents and brother, Lawrence, a Rugby Union
international, and had great ambition and potential.
In human terms, the injury had been profound. But in law he could not
award damages for injured feelings on the ground of sentiment. There was
no secure evidence to conclude that she would have provided a regular
income for her financially vulnerable parents.
The judge accepted Mr Dallaglio's evidence that his daughter was
generous, warm, and impulsive. In a letter, she had written: ''All that
you've ever done is very appreciated and will be paid back ten thousand
times more, one day.''
However, the judge said: ''I cannot believe that before her death they
had any real expectation that she would have provided them with, in
effect, a pension.
''I am sure they would have wanted her to secure her own financial
position and to have provided for her family when she married and had
children.''
He awarded the couple #16,000 for their loss, plus #4806 to
Francesca's estate and #13,124 interest.
0 Later, the Dallaglios said they would consider an appeal.
Mrs Dallaglio commented: ''We should never have been brought to this
court in the first place. When the vessel owners admitted liability,
punitive and exemplary damages should have been paid immediately to all
the families involved -- the survivors and the bereaved.''
She said that it was morally wrong that she and her husband, and the
public through the legal aid fund, were now having to pick up the bill.
Solicitor Tim Taylor, acting for the Bowbelle's operators, South Coast
Shipping Company, said later: ''This is a very sad case. No-one has any
doubt that Francesca was a popular and talented girl and her loss has
very obviously been deeply felt by all those who knew her.''
He said more than 120 of the total 131 claims arising out of the
accident had been settled, most of them by agreement, but the Dallaglios
had claimed over #300,000 and ''it was simply not possible'' to agree a
settlement out of the court.
''My clients recognise that it is an almost impossible task for a
judge to put a financial value on the life of a talented young dancer,
but are pleased that the uncertainties in relation to this particular
case have now been resolved,'' he said.

A WOMAN'S brief holiday encounter with a British businessman has
resulted in her being left his entire fortune.
The Midlands businessman had sketchy memories of the woman named Avril
he met on the Costa Brava in 1989. This has left researchers with a
problem.
Executors of his will must find Avril, said to be a tall blonde from
Glasgow and now aged around 25, before the estate running into hundreds
of thousands of pounds reverts to the Crown.
Mr Leslie MacIntyre, of Glasgow accountants Wylie and Bissett, was
contacted to help because his firm has links with the travel industry.
He said all he really had to go on was that the woman took a coach to
Spain from Glasgow in August 1989.
The businessman's identity has been kept secret in order to prevent a
flood of imposters attempting to claim the cash. However, it is said he
met Avril at the Castell Montegri campsite near Estartit between August
and September 1989.
The woman, who is the sole beneficiary of the will, can claim the
money if she can prove she was the woman he met on holiday.
Investigator Richard Sutcliffe, who has been working for months to
track down the woman, said: ''I don't know what happened between them. I
don't even know who he was.
''I have tried no end of people -- travel agents, Abta, and even the
accountants in Glasgow. It's a case of tracking back through bookings,
schedules, and that sort of thing.''

JOHN Major will win a comfortable majority over challenger John
Redwood, according to a poll published on the eve of the leadership
election.
Fewer than 100 MPs will vote against Mr Major or abstain, according to
the survey conducted by lobby journalists from nine regional newspapers
and television companies.
Mr Major will get 236 votes and Mr Redwood 52, with 41 abstentions,
the poll showed.
This would put Mr Major safely below the benchmark of 100 dissenters
which many MPs believe is crucial if he is to retain his authority and
stay in power.
The journalists taking part in the survey were asked to make a best
judgment about the intentions of the MPs in their patch.
They covered 152 MPs, predicting that 109 would vote for Mr Major and
24 for Mr Redwood, with 19 abstentions.
Their final figures were reached by scaling up the results, but the
journalists emphasised it was only a tentative forecast as London and
the south-east were not included.
Bookmakers say Mr Major is a betting certainty to win today's
leadership stakes.
They reported a late surge in support for the Prime Minister to lead
his party at the next General Election.
William Hill has Mr Major odds-on at 4/5 after a dip in popularity
earlier in the campaign.
John Redwood trails at 12/1, while the highly-fancied Michael
Heseltine is at 2/1 and Michael Portillo 5/1 to be Tory leader at the
next election.
Meanwhile, Littlewoods said it was no longer taking bets on today's
first ballot.
According to Littlewoods, Mr Major is now an even-bet to lead in 1997
with Mr Heseltine second favourite at 7/4. A late surge in support for
Mr Portillo was also reported.
The largest single stake received at Littlewoods on a Conservative was
#1500 on Kenneth Clarke at 20/1.
However, the biggest bet since Mr Major's announcement that he was
standing down has been #6000 on a Labour victory -- no matter who leads
the Tory Party.

PROTESTERS led by Militant Councillor Tommy Sheridan gathered outside
Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday.
Some held banners protesting about the recent arrests of four people
charged with breach of the peace and released pending court appearances
after a demonstration claiming that Glasgow's Hope Street was the most
polluted street in Britain. The four are expected to appear for trial
next month.
Mr Sheridan was convicted of breach of the peace last month after a
trial and was to appear for sentence yesterday.
He said last night: ''The date for sentence was changed on Friday and
will take place on Wednesday. The demonstrators, mainly from the protest
at the M77 motorway extension, could not be informed in time to come on
Wednesday to protest against whatever sentence is imposed on me.''

A NOTE of bitterness marked the party leadership campaign as it
entered its final stretch.
Former Minister George Walden raised the stakes dramatically by
threatening to resign his seat and force a by-election if John Redwood
won.
Mr Walden, left-leaning MP for Buckingham, told BBC2's Westminster on
Line he could not tolerate serving under a Redwood Government.
''I disagree very fundamentally with the attitude of his camp, which I
think is a form of petty nationalism with which I simply cannot be
associated. I would resign from the Conservative Party and my seat the
day he took over.''
Meanwhile, senior back bencher David Howell, chairman of the Commons
foreign affairs committee, was looking beyond the vote today to a second
ballot.
Although he said he was convinced Mr Major could win on a first
ballot, he disclosed he would vote for Michael Heseltine if a second
ensued.
''Michael Heseltine is a very considerable figure . . . he could lead
the country. If you press me and say 'We are going into the abyss,' I
would hope the one hope then was Michael Heseltine.''
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard, in a warning to those MPs
considering not supporting Mr Major, said she believed MPs were
''getting quite anxious'' about the messages from supporters in their
constituencies.
''We hear dark stories of threats of reselection for people who may
think of not supporting the Prime Minister tomorrow. That is one sort of
abyss,'' she said.
''It is quite clear that a vote for Mr Major is the best assurance for
them.
''The possibility of second or third ballots would deepen disunity,
increase bitterness and further deflect the party from the task in
hand.''

JOHN REDWOOD yesterday attacked John Major's leadership, saying it was
characterised by ''uncertainty based on indecision.''
Pulling no punches in his final, packed and chaotic campaign press
conference, he claimed: ''There's still everything to play for.''
With his wife Gail at his side, he acknowledged that the signs of how
the contest would go were ''murky'' and added to his promise to cut
taxes if elected a pledge that if he won there would be no further tax
increases this side of the next election.
Mr Redwood underlined his message to undecided Tory MPs that if they
wanted a change, they must vote for him.
He insisted that the number of waverers the day before polling meant
the outcome of the contest could not predicted with any certainty.
Mr Redwood said he still believed that he could secure an outright
victory in the first ballot.
''I say to all colleagues -- consider well your vote. If you think we
need a change to win, then vote for one. There is only one way to vote
for change. This is to vote to me.''
Mr Redwood said that the election was about both style and substance,
and derided the efforts of Mr Major's campaign team based at Cowley
Street.
''It has posed the question of how Conservatives break the electoral
curse and start winning again,'' he said.
''Over the last week, we have seen the Cowley Street style --
uncertainty based on indecision.
''There has been no consistency, only the shifting sand of
unattributable briefings responding to the changing headlines.
''One day we are told they will win by a mile, another day that one
vote above the threshold would be a good result. The truth is no-one can
tell.''
While insisting that leadership was a crucial issue, he drew back from
claiming that the way his election campaign had been run reflected on Mr
Major's style in office.
Instead, he emphasised that while the Major team had appeared to shift
its ground on tax cuts and on a single currency, he remained consistent
on every issue.
''My campaign has stuck to the issues and stuck to its guns.
Leadership is about listening to what people think and want and then
leading them in a clear direction. That is the way we can best expose
the dangers of Labour,'' he said.
Mr Redwood dismissed suggestions by the Major camp that his programme
would divide the party. He said in the past it had been legislation to
transfer more power to Brussels or to raise taxes, such as VAT on fuel,
that led to splits.
''I would not be bringing such contentious legislation before the
House so there would be no such votes to divide us,'' he said.
He claimed that the measures he was proposing were neither right-wing
nor left-wing, but were simply common sense. However he stressed the
party should be proud of its Conservative principles.
''People want new words and new measures and they want them to be
Conservative,'' he said.
He went out of his way to offer an olive branch to MPs on the Tory
left, such as Mr George Walden, who has threatened to resign his seat
and force a by-election if Mr Redwood wins today.
''I think he may have said that in haste and I will talk to George on
Tuesday night to assure him that there will be a warm place for him in
the Conservative Party and I would be very happy to take on board the
points he wishes to make,'' he said.
''He has a fine mind and he has a big contribution to make to
Conservative thinking.''
The challenger's news conference was marked by some end-of-term good
humour.
Mr Redwood jokingly brushed aside repeated attempts by reporters to
draw his wife into the questioning.
''I am the politician and I make the political statements and I answer
the political questions,'' he said.
He was pressed on what he thought of politicians like Tony Blair and
Bill Clinton who, it was said, took many of their ideas from their
wives.
''I have no respect for either of those politicians' views and I am
afraid that if they come from their wives, that makes me a little
uncharitable to their wives,'' he said.

THIS leadership election is now down to the nitty-gritty, and the
votes tonight will fall accordingly.
Will Mr Major or Mr Redwood win the Tories the next General Election,
or at least prevent a Labour landslide victory. That is one part of it.
The second part, and perhaps emerging as the more important one, is
who is going to choose the timing of the next General Election? Will it
be Mr Tony Blair -- if so, the Leader of the Opposition will have
achieved the main prize. Will it be Mr Major or Mr Redwood? -- whoever
becomes the next Tory leader tonight.
The voters in this election, 329 Tory MPs, are beginning to take this
issue very seriously indeed. Both candidates have declared that they
want the leadership issue settled tonight and whoever wins under the
rules, whatever the majority, is the winner.
There should be no second ballot. There is no belief that Tory MPs do
not understand this clearly. Both Mr Major and Mr Redwood have
reputations as straight-up guys who mean what they say. So the issue
should be settled tonight.
Yesterday, the number-crunchers on both sides were trying to put
together firm forecasts for the result. On the Major side, they are
looking at between 240 and 270 votes. On the Redwood side they are
looking at 80 votes plus enough abstentions to bring it up to 100 not
supporting the Prime Minister.
If these rough figures are to be believed for a secret ballot, the
result is a foregone conclusion, and Mr Redwood has said that the winner
should take all and gain 100% support.
Despite the efforts of various sections of the media to promote a
second ballot which might bring on a different contest between the right
(Michael Portillo) and the left (Michael Heseltine), there is still no
sign that such a contest can take place.
Both shadow candidates have been deporting themselves accordingly, low
key and barely visible.
Throughout the last 10 days, there has been an absence of both Mr
Heseltine and Mr Portillo from the corridors of putative power in
Westminster.
The Major camp claims that over the weekend wavering MPs have been
making up their minds with the ''help'' of their constituency parties.
By midday, it looked as though 92% of the party activists want Mr Major
to remain as Prime Minister and lead them into the next General
Election.
The Redwood camp reports that they also have strong support from party
activists. However, it is difficult for them to counter reports from the
National Union of the Tory Party, which represents officials, agents,
voluntary workers and assorted door-knockers, that the Prime Minister
retains their confidence.
So the Redwood camp is looking for a different kind of victory
tonight. An honourable and gallant defeat with a significant support
will stand Mr Redwood in good stead in the run-up to the next election
and, more particularly beyond that.
He is only 44; he has made himself a household name, as well as a
gutsy politician who talks straight, means what he says, and acts
accordingly. His supporters will believe the old maxim: ''Say not the
struggle naught availeth.''
If their man loses well tonight, they will have shifted the Tory Party
argument rightwards and established their man above Mr Portillo as the
darling of the Tory right wing.
However, the essence of the situation is now looking beyond what Mr
Major described in the Daily Telegraph yesterday as the ''abyss'' to the
timing of the next General Election.
Mr Major, or his successor, requires that Government economic policies
are given a sufficient time to make their effect on General Election
voters. Mr Major's trump card in all this is that he is the best man to
unite the party and delay the timing of the next General Election.
A Redwood victory tonight would promote an all-out onslaught on the
Government by the Labour Party who might be able to spring a General
Election this autumn or by next spring.
Tory back benchers seeking the best way to hold on to their seats are
beginning to take this prospect of an earlier General Election
seriously. Many of them feel that they will be goners anyway.
Some of those who acknowledge this also understand that to find a new
career will take longer than this autumn or next spring.
A mutuality of intererest between Mr Major and his back benchers on
this issue is beginning to form. And this could be the deciding issue
tonight on whether the Prime Minister gets a mere 200 votes or so or
something more like 260. The latter would certainly produce the result
he requires to sort out the issue of leadership ''once and for all.''
Mr Redwood on Sunday repeated that tonight the winner is the winner
and he will stand by that. No wonder there is little sign of the
Heseltine or Portillo supporters gearing themselves up seriously for a
second ballot.

PRAYERS in the Commons seemed to take a little longer yesterday.
Public and press are not allowed in for that first five minutes or so
before questions, the latter traditionally on the grounds that the media
are past praying for.
When the Sketch got in, it expected to see around 300 MPs on the Tory
side who had just been seeking the divine guidance of which this small,
select electorate seems sadly in need.
In fact, there were about 20 back benchers and they wore more the look
of persons seeking sanctuary from the final frenzied assaults, threats,
promises, arm-twisting and ear-bending of campaign team enthusiasts.
Mr Jacques Arnold (Gravesend) -- who, in default of higher-powered
office- holders had at the weekend made the ultimate sacrifice and
resigned as Parliamentary Private Secretary (bag-carrier) to a
middle-ranking Home Office Minister to campaign for Mr Redwood -- sat on
the very back bench instead of in his usual spot halfway up.
This kept him further away from the Transport Secretary, Dr Brian
Mawhinney, who was taking time off from being one of the chief Major
campaigners, to answer questions. This safety precaution worked.
Squabbling everywhere else, at least the Tories were able to keep it
out of the Chamber.
Lady Olga Maitland (Sutton and Cheam) briefly electrified us by
announcing that she was ''angry, frustrated and tired,'' but this turned
out to be not a reflection on the leadership contest but on the
thwarting of her efforts on behalf of her sorely tried commuter
constituents.
Dr Mawhinney did seem to be spraying the compliments around his back
benches even more than usual. Every Tory who raised a local road or rail
problem was praised for his long-standing devotion to duty.
This is not unusual at Transport questions and Ministers' compliments
are duly passed on to the MP's local paper. But was it just imagination,
or was the good doctor laying it on with a trowel.
Mr David Sumberg (Bury South), for example, launched a tirade about
the misbegotten nature of the M62 construction devastating his
constituency, and threw in a few hard words about Department of
Transport officials.
Beaming, Dr Mawhinney said he would like to pay tribute to Mr
Sumberg's robustness in looking after his constituents. Once a plotter
against Margaret Thatcher, Mr Sumberg might be suspected by anxious
Majorites of being a possible abstainer who harbours hopes of a
Heseltine Second Coming.
Labour MPs have managed to insert jibes about the Tory election
process into questions to most departments since the great race began.
Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover -- Lab.) bothers about even a slim
connection between his questions and the matter under discussion less
than most.
We had moved on to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, whose
responsibilities include, for reasons best known to John Major,
scientific education and research. Mr Skinner decided that the slender
link between scientific education, arithmetic and the current contest
offered him the chance to offer a forecast of the outcome.
Major 190, Redwood 70, abstentions therefore 69, was the Skinner
guesstimate and, if right, a deeply depressing outcome for the already
agonised Tories. Did Mr Hunt think that Mr Major would stand his ground
after a result like that and keep his job, asked Dennis?
Mr David Hunt, a Major groupie, forecast a ''decisive victory'' for
his man, but wisely did not define arithmetically what he thought would
be decisive. He also threw in a little tribute to Mr Redwood's oversight
of the NHS in Wales, presumably just in case the outcome was not as
decisively decisive as he hoped.
The Duchy also supervises Citizen's Charters of which, lucky citizens,
there are now 40. Citizens didn't want more Charters, they wanted a
General Election now, cried Mr John Evans (St Helens -- Lab.).
Mr Redwood deserved a Chartermark for guts, pronounced Mr David
Winnick (Walsall North -- Lab.) which was more than Mr Heseltine or Mr
Portillo did.
Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley -- Lab.) suggested
that Mr Major would be remembered for his road cones hot line. Labour is
loving Mr Major's claim to be the one man who can unite his party while
his decision to put the leadership up for grabs has reduced it to a
confused, faction-ridden rabble.
Whether he wins or not, it thinks Labour will be the ultimate
beneficiary of his gamble.

ALAN MacDERMID at the British Medical Association Annual Meeting,
Harrogate
BRITAIN'S doctors are working for an ''alien regime'' that is driving
thousands of them away, the chairman of the British Medical Association,
Dr Sandy Macara, said yesterday.
One in four junior doctors leaves the profession within three years of
graduating, he told the association's annual conference in Harrogate.
Dr Macara blamed the brain drain on the internal market -- ''more of
an infernal bazaar'' -- created by the Government in 1990.
''The fact is that we are losing 25% to 30% of our brightest
youngsters -- and it is the brightest who are leaving,'' said Dr Macara.
''Their senior colleagues are desperately worried.''
Although there were a variety of reasons, including pregnancy and
planned career breaks, Dr Macara blamed disillusionment for much of the
haemorrhage.
Cautiously welcoming Labour's health proposals, published last week,
he accused the Government of failing to acknowledge reality as it
force-fed the public on a flatulent diet of indigestible statistics.
''The Opposition, hungry for power, has just prescribed its treatment
for the NHS. It is encouraging to get the impression that they have paid
some heed to our advice. We will be studying the proposals closely.''
Dr Macara declared: ''Medicine in this country has a record of which
it can be truly proud. Why, then, are we slipping back in international
league tables of mortality and morbidity? Why do so many of our ablest
doctors crave only early retirement or flight?
''Why do so many of our best and brightest youngsters abandon medical
practice after many years of gruelling and expensive education? We know
the reason. Our patients know the reason. The Government surely knows
the reason, if it will face the truth.
''The reason is that we are labouring under an alien regime -- not so
much an internal market as an infernal bazaar in which considerations of
cost reign supreme while concerns for value and values are relegated to
second place.''
Dr Macara also attacked the concept of local pay. It was designed to
be divisive, to engender insecurity. It was not designed -- and never
had been intended -- to reward professional performance, or to be
related to the quality of care for patients.
''The criterion is the success -- or failure -- of business plans,''
he said.
Such is the level of stress and disillusionment claimed by speakers at
the conference that the BMA is to discuss setting up a Samaritan-style
helpline for doctors.
Dr Andrew Carney, chairman of the Junior Doctors' Committee, said:
''The next low point will be the discussions we have about low morale in
the service, and stress.
''We will be discussing whether to set up a helpline for doctors, a
medical Samaritan service. That says something about the state the
health service is in.
''It is a disgrace and a waste of public money. It costs the taxpayers
thousands of pounds to train them. They are treated like dirt and people
are surprised when they leave.''
Dr Carney said there were more than 1000 German and 700 Dutch doctors
working in junior posts in the NHS. They were not likely to stay
indefinitely because the working conditions were less civilised than
those they were used to.
UK medical schools produce about 4000 graduates every year at a
training cost of #30,000 a head. That rises to #100,000 by the time they
have reached the rank of consultant.
Dr Helen Davison, a 28-year-old former trainee GP, told the conference
she had quit through stress after being ''ground down'' by the system.
Dr Davison, from Carlisle, said she had been getting more and more tired
after returning to hospital as part of her training programme.
Dr Davison, who is now unemployed, had been working in a hospital in
the North of England, doing a rheumatology job and covering another
department as the doctor on call.
''I became increasingly tired and run-down. The more tired I got the
more difficult it was to learn my job. I think now I have been put off
clinical medicine. The changes that will have to be made are so far in
the future that it would not be relevant to me.''
Dr Davison quit her #20,000-a-year job two years ago to join the
estimated 5000 other juniors now no longer practising medicine.
The staffing crisis that affected a number of Scottish hospitals after
the last change-over in the junior doctors' six-monthly rotation could
be repeated next month, the Scottish juniors' chairman, Dr Peter Bennie,
warned.
''A lot of hospitals who think they have all their posts filled will
discover that people have gone elsewhere,'' he said.
The shortfall after February led to crises in accident and emergency
departments at Law, Arbroath, Strathcathro, Stirling Royal, and other
hospitals. The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow had to close
an operating theatre and bring foward the seasonal closure of a ward.

MENTION the word Canada to a Tory MP these days and the likely
reaction will be a scream of fright. Less than two years ago, the
Canadian electorate woke up one October morning and turned on the ruling
Conservatives with a vengeance. The result was the stuff of political
nightmares. A party that governed with a majority of 156 was reduced to
just two -- that's two -- seats in the federal parliament.
Tories deciding how to vote in the leadership election will have
considered above all else which of the candidates and potential
candidates stands a chance of saving them from unemployment when the
General Election eventually comes. With Labour thirty points ahead in
the polls, the Canadian scenario looms large.
In 1993, after a long period in government, marked by recession,
increases in direct and indirect taxation, a slow decay in health and
education, and a steady stream of sleaze scandals, the Canadian
Conservatives forced out an unpopular leader, replaced him with a
charismatic but inexperienced radical, and watched voters abandon them
in droves.
The wipe-out was rooted in the party's deep-seated unpopularity, built
up by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
However, its scale was magnified by the woman who replaced Mr Mulroney
and led the Tories for just four fateful months.
Kim Campbell had been on the national political scene for less than
five years when she challenged Mr Mulroney. Her looks, her willingness
to pose apparently topless behind a judge's robe, her freshness, and the
simple fact that she was most definitely not a grey man in a suit,
helped her sweep her more experienced opposition aside and take control
of the party.
Come the election, however, her inexperience showed, as her campaign
lapsed into a succession of blunders. The Conservatives were trounced,
she lost her seat, and resigned as Tory leader. She was last seen
selling trainers at a shoe convention in Boston.
For a while, oblivion. However, in the last month Canada's Tories have
experienced something of a revival. Three weeks ago in provincial
elections in Ontario, the Conservatives returned to power, after decades
in opposition, on a populist, right-wing platform that has sent
shock-waves through Canada's traditionally soft-centred political
establishment.
Michael Harris, a charismatic former golfer from a small town in
northern Ontario has left Canada astonished. Not just because his style
resembles the genial simple-mindedness of Ronald Reagan, but because his
Progressive Conservative Party preaches a form of uninhibited small-c
conservatism which has until now been restricted firmly to the country's
remote western fringes.
Premier-elect Harris has promised an immediate 30% cut in income tax,
spending cuts to match, privatisation, a reduction in benefits, workfare
for the unemployed, and fewer hand-outs to single mothers.
Of Ontario's 10 million population, 1.3million are on welfare. The
province is in debt and has a lower credit rating than next door Quebec.
Its level of income tax is one of the highest in the country -- someone
on #30,000 pays 53.2%.
Mike Harris has said he wants to reverse all that. His campaign slogan
promised to get government ''out of your face and out of your
pocketbook''.
His agenda echoes the Contract for America being forced through the
United States Congress by its new Speaker, the right-wing Republican
Newt Gingrich, who has promised to topple years of interventionist
government.
The politics of the new right with which the United States and Britain
have been familiar now for more than a decade are a discovery for
Canada, used to its liberal Red Tories.
1 David Hutchison, media lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, is
a close follower of Canadian and British politics. He says it's not the
Tories who should worry about recent events in Canada, but Labour.
He points to the example of the socialist New Democrats, the party
evicted by the Conservatives in Ontario. It came to power unexpectedly
five years ago, and it showed in its record in power.
''If I were an MP worrying I would take some comfort from the NDP
experience in Ontario. I'd say to myself 'I wonder if the Labour Party,
doing well in the opinion polls, will have thought out how they would do
in government?''' he said.
Fortunately for Labour, there is little in the polls to suggest that
the Canadian version of Thatcherite fundamentalism is a vote winner for
the Tories here.
On the contrary. A recent Economist poll suggests Michael Portillo or
John Redwood, with their right-wing recipe for renewal, would do the
Tory Party the worse damage in a General Election. Instead, there is
everything to suggest that on present form a lot of Tory MPs may find
themselves, like Kim Campbell, selling shoes in a few years' time.

FORMER Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lawson yesterday warned that
Britain must be prepared to stand aside if other European Union nations
move to establish a single currency.
His intervention came as Tory MPs prepared to vote in a leadership
election in which the single currency and monetary union have been
crucial issues.
While not directly rejecting Mr Major's position that Britain should
not commit itself either way until there were concrete proposals on the
table, Lord Lawson's words will be seen as offering encouragment to
rival candidate John Redwood who has ruled out ever joining a single
currency.
''My overriding concern in the context of this election is to see my
party reunited as quickly and completely as possible,'' Lord Lawson told
a London conference on monetary union.
''I hope that a frank and dispassionate analysis of this difficult
issue may be of some help in achieving that distressingly elusive
objective.''
Lord Lawson said that the demands for a single currency were
politically rather than economically driven and came from those who
wanted to see full political union between France and Germany together
with those countries who wished to join them.
While he understood the concerns of those who, after the experience of
the Second World War, wanted to see France and Germany bound together,
he warned that there was no general desire among the people of Europe
for political union.
''It is, in short, clear that European political union would prove a
major disaster unless its achievement were the clearly expressed wish of
the majority of its peoples. That is manifestly not the case today,'' he
said.
He dismissed the suggestion that if some other countries did go ahead
with a single currency, Britain would have no choice but to join.
''Can Britain afford to stand aside if others decide to forge ahead by
moving to monetary union, possibly as early as 1999?
''I believe we can and must,'' he said.
However, he warned that Britain would have to make plain to the
international money markets exactly why it would not join, particularly
after its ''inglorious'' exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.

NEVER say never could become the motto of Easterhouse folk after a
typical piece of Glaswegian bravado brought the head honchos of the
Millennium Commission to the sprawling housing scheme, and with them the
hint of a second chance at #6m of lottery cash.
After a ''passionate'' meeting community representatives emerged
confident last night that their bid for money to build an ambitious,
multi-user centre, which was effectively rejected outright by the
commission earlier this month, was alive again.
The commission has said Easterhouse can bid again in September and
might go on to a fast track if they correct the deficiencies of their
earlier attempt.
It has also agreed to put its reasons for rejection in writing,
increasing the chances of the Easterhouse team securing the #50,000
sponsorship needed to carry out a detailed feasibility study essential
to success.
Earlier this month, when the proposal to build the centre, including a
theatre, cinema, and conference hall, was effectively thrown out by the
commission, community representatives went on the offensive, demanding
to know why they had been turned down.
Their persistence paid off as Jeniffer Page, chief executive of the
Millennium Commission; Sir John Hall, Millennium commissioner; and the
Earl of Dalkieth sat down with members of the Easterhouse community in
John Wheatley College last night to try and find a way forward.
Mr Tommy Glover, Easterhouse community empowerment co-ordinator,
described the meeting as very useful. ''When I went in there tonight our
chances of building this were dead. Now they are alive again.'' Mrs Ina
Taggart, convener of the community empowerment group, said the
community's refusal to give up had paid off.
During the meeting neither side pulled its punches. The Easterhouse
team warned that the screening process for Millennium projects worked
against community bids because of its demands for expensive and detailed
financial information at the earliest stages.
The Millennium representatives said the reason the bid had been turned
down was that the Easterhouse figures didn't add up.
Jeniffer Page, chief executive of the commission, said: ''The
viability of their scheme was not proven at the first stage, and there
were specific aspects which our professional advisers highlighted as
needing further work.
''We discussed the reasons why they didn't get through and what would
happen next. The community seemed to understand much more clearly what
the situation is and what their options are.''
The commission representatives had taken time out from a whistle-stop
tour of a number of the successful UK bids, including Hampden Stadium,
to go to Easterhouse last night.
Marion Keogh, director of the Greater Easterhouse Initiative,
conducted the negotiations with the commission over the visit. ''The
view here was that we were not prepared to give up, so it was reasonable
to ask for a detailed explanation.
''It was a very useful meeting and we came away with the strong
feeling that the door was still open. We have not resolved the problem
of how community organisations can access funds for the feasibility
studies.''
Easterhouse still has to find a way to fund a feasibility study, but
it is hoped the letter from the commission will persuade public bodies
to put up the money needed.
Ms Keogh said community representatives were originally angry that a
decision on the financial viability of the project had been taken when
only outline information had been provided.
''Community organisations do not routinely have the resources for such
work, and can only get funding where an application is seen to have a
realistic chance of success, '' she said.

Belfast
SELDOM can the fate of one prisoner in Britain have provoked such
legal heart-searching, political debate, or public concern. In the eyes
of many, Lee Clegg's release is a cause celebre. To others, it deals a
body blow to British justice. For the Government, the decision could
have untold ramifications.
Had it not been for what happened shortly before midnight on September
30, 1990, the world might never have heard of Lee Clegg. Until that
moment he was just one of the tens of thousands of British soldiers who
have served in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years. Aged 21, he was
still a rookie private out on the kind of night-time patrol in West
Belfast that has tested and frayed the nerves of many a young soldier.
A darkened roadway. An Army checkpoint. The sound and lights of an
approaching stolen car. Soldiers' gunfire cuts the night air and bullets
smash into the car as it careers towards and past them. Then, when the
shooting is over, the full horror of the moment is revealed. A joyrider,
Martin Peake, aged 18, is dead and his 17-year-old passenger and
girlfriend, Karen Reilly, lies dying. But also, in the darkness of that
September night, another young life, that of Private Lee Clegg, was
changed forever.
Born in 1969, Clegg left school at 16 with no qualifications. He
worked as a butcher's assistant and a hospital porter before joining the
Army as a teenage recruit. In September, 1990, he had only months of
service behind him, as a private in the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute
Regiment.
The actions of his paratroopers' patrol provoked an inevitable
response of hostility and outrage in nationalist West Belfast. According
to the Army version of events, the joyriders' car had been fired on as
it swerved into one of Clegg's colleagues, Private Barry Aindow,
knocking him to the ground and injuring his leg.
However, local people took a different view, claiming the teenagers
were victims of a ''shoot-to-kill'' policy and invoking the memory of
Bloody Sunday (January 30, 1972) nearly 20 years before, when 13
Catholic men were shot dead and 17 were wounded by members of the same
regiment after a rally in Londonderry.
So the Parachute Regiment was once again at the forefront of
controversy over its behaviour in Northern Ireland.
It seemed that the row would simply rage on without conclusion but in
1991 the authorities announced that Lee Clegg would be prosecuted for
murder, and he and his colleague Barry Aindow for attempted murder. The
evidence of a lone police officer, who had been accompanying the patrol
at the time of the shooting, now emerged as most significant.
The RUC officer would give evidence that the soldiers' version of
events was concocted. Private Aindow, he said, was not knocked down by
the joyriders' car. Instead, members of the patrol had set about
deliberately injuring him to make it look as if the car had hit him.
Most crucial of all, the court heard that of the four shots fired by
Private Clegg, three were at the approaching car and the fourth after it
had passed by. According to forensic evidence, the first shots had
struck the windscreen, the fourth killed Karen Reilly. It was this final
shot that sealed Clegg's conviction for murder, a bullet that was held
not to be fired in self-defence in accordance with Army ''Yellow Card''
guidelines.
Clegg was given a life sentence for the murder of Karen Reilly and
four years concurrently on the reduced charge of attempting to wound
Martin Peake. Private Aindow was jailed for seven years for attempted
murder but that charge was subsequently reduced on appeal to one of
malicious wounding and his sentence cut to four years.
Of 36 shots fired by the patrol, only four had come from Clegg's rifle
but the judge held that the fourth and final shot was fired at the back
of the joyriders' car when it posed no threat and, in consequence, found
Clegg guilty of murder.
The subsequent arguments over Lee Clegg have centred on whether he was
guilty of murder or simply a victim of circumstances peculiar to the
operations of a soldier with a rifle in his hand. In that split moment,
did he intend to take Karen Reilly's life, in which case it was murder,
or should he have been prosecuted for the lesser offence of
manslaughter?
Clegg's appeal before three Northern Ireland Law Lords added further
fuel to the controversy. Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian Hutton, in
dismissing the appeal, called for a review of the Yellow Card guidelines
to soldiers, which he described as having ''no inherent legal force''.
Clegg's final hope of release seemed to vanish in January when the
House of Lords also rejected his appeal but then the publicity machine
in his favour caught hold across the UK. Influential figures at
Westminster, in the British media, and in the Army joined forces in a
campaign that has gained ground ever since and has finally succeeded.
Reviews of prison sentences usually take place after 10 years, but
Clegg served only four years in prison. And his release, at 6.30am
yesterday morning, is proving to be as controversial as his prosecution
and conviction.

FROM an Army point of view he was being feted just like any other
hostage returning from captivity.
He was a VIP in every way, albeit with one slight difference -- he was
delivered to the Army Infantry Training Centre at Catterick, North
Yorkshire, in a prison van.
There were cheers, handshakes, slaps on the back for Lee Clegg and
there were drinks all round.
His three-year-old son, Joshua, was brought to Catterick to see him by
the Para's estranged wife, Belfast-born Amanda. But there are no plans
for reconciliation.
There was a reunion with his parents and a congratulatory word on his
new-found freedom from his temporary CO.
After a few days to recover from prison in the bosom of his real
family -- the Army -- he will be allowed to go on leave. He can take as
much time off as he needs to recover.
Following his conviction for murder in Northern Ireland, his pay
ceased, but it resumed again yesterday. If he needs a loan to go on
holiday the Army will give him an advance. He is taking up the option.
It was only as lawyers, top officers, and senior officials at the
Ministry of Defence in London began to study the licence terms on which
convicted murderer Lee Clegg has been set free from prison, after
serving less than four years, that doubt began to creep in.
Law books were being studied to see if he still could continue with a
career in the Army. It was just possible that somebody convicted of
murder could stay in the service, they suggested, but it was looking
dubious.
Over and above the strict letter of the law, ethics were by now also
coming into the equation.
If they chose not to sling Clegg out of the Army, chiefs were
beginning to realise they could stand accused of cocking a snook not
only at the whole legal system, the peace process in Northern Ireland,
but -- worst of all in their book -- possibly the Queen herself.
They were told in no uncertain terms that Clegg has not been released
from prison as an innocent man.
He has been set free early because the authorities think he has served
a sufficient period of his sentence and is unlikely to re-offend -- ie
he will be of no further danger to the public.
However, as of yesterday he stands convicted of murdering one of Her
Majesty's subjects. At the time of the killing he was under Queen's
Regulations. The prosecution that led to his conviction was in the name
of the Queen.
Last night the Army was being forced to consider whether he could
reasonably be expected to continue a career in an armed service that
owes its total allegiance to the Queen.
Even if he is allowed to stay in, chances are he might never ever
again be a Para. In fact it seemed highly improbable.

STRIKES by train drivers, together with industrial action by Passport
Agency staff and possibly British Airways employees, threaten to wreck
holiday travel plans.
BR's 12,000 engine drivers have voted by 5732 votes to 3257 to reject
their 3% ''final'' pay offer and stage a series of one-day strikes.
These are likely to bring the rail system to a virtual standstill even
without the 45,000 RMT members, including signal workers, who are also
voting on similar action over pay.
Armed with the strike mandate, Aslef's executive decided yesterday to
call an initial batch of six one-day strikes: the first a week today and
subsequent stoppages on July 18 and 27, August 8 and 25, and September
12.
ScotRail director John Ellis described the decision as ''absolutely
disastrous'' for Scotland. ''It's bad news for the industry, for
employees within the industry, but most of all for the customers. It
can't do anyone any good at all,'' said Mr Ellis, who maintained that
sleeper services would be worst hit.
''We would not be able to run anything other than trains where we had
drivers coming in and breaking the strike. Realistically we don't see
much prospect of that.''
The RMT has agreed to co-ordinate any action its members may call for
with that of Aslef, but the seven-day notice period demanded by law
means that no matter what the vote they cannot participate in next
Tuesday's stoppage.
Aslef general secretary Lew Adams said: ''The vote is a clear
indication that train drivers are not prepared to accept yet another
wage cut. This year is the fifth time since 1980 we have been given a
so-called 'final' offer that is below the rate of inflation. Our members
are saying enough is enough.''
Mr Adams described the 3% offer as insulting and said he had warned BR
it had to make an offer above the rate of inflation -- currently 3.4% --
but it chose to ignore that warning and had missed its chance.
Mr Adams said he anticipated there would be no trains running on
strike days.
He also accused the Government of interfering by insisting that BR
managers could not offer more than 3%. He emphasised, however, that BR
still had time to talk and ''make us a more realistic pay offer''.
In a message to rail travellers, he said: ''We are not a gang of
hot-heads or a militant union.''
BR personnel director Paul Watkinson urged Aslef to reconsider. He
said the 3% offer was ''a good one and the right one for BR''.
Meanwhile, the national disputes committee of the Civil and Public
Services Association meets tomorrow to assess what is understood to be a
fairly narrow vote for strike action by 1200 Passport Agency staff. They
are protesting at proposals to shed some 10% of their number.
Glasgow, with about 250 staff, is the second largest Passport Agency
office after Liverpool. Others include London, Belfast, Peterborough,
and Newport.
Even if a proposed five-day strike is shelved because of the close
vote, an overtime ban and work to rule, which received unanimous
support, appears inevitable.
British Airways is the third area of potential industrial conflict as
the Transport and General Workers Union gears up to oppose plans to end
central bargaining by devolving negotiations to 22 business and
departmental bargaining groups.
As the first phase of that opposition, BA's annual shareholders'
meeting in London next Tuesday is to be lobbied by up to 1000 employees
including contingents bused in from Glasgow and Edinburgh. Subsequent,
more drastic, action is expected to be unveiled at the TGWU biennial
conference in Blackpool next week.

and Political Team
THE Prime Minister was convinced last night of a ''handsome'' win in
the Tory leadership election to be decided today.
The only split in John Major's camp was about how soon his challenger
John Redwood could be brought back into the Cabinet.
Both candidates addressed an eve of poll meeting of about 70
centre-right and right-wing MPs last night, making their final pitches
to the 329 back-bench voters and answering questions afterwards.
Later it emerged that two senior right wingers are expected to back Mr
Redwood.
They are Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 Group of Tory MPs,
and Mr John Townend, another senior member of the Group and chairman of
the Tory back-bench finance committee. The public endorsement will give
Mr Redwood a boost as MPs prepare to begin voting at 10am today.
Mr Townend said: ''I am coming out in support of John Redwood because
I believe the party needs a change. A vote for Redwood is the only way
to get that change and I believe John Redwood would deliver tax cuts,
which is what the Government needs.''
Mr Major had offered no concessions on his policy on Europe or
anything else when he addressed the Group.
Mr Redwood may have attracted a few more votes by declaring he
believes the implementation of the Nolan inquiry into MPs' conduct and
financial interests ''should be settled within the House''. Tory MPs are
concerned that if their outside activities are to be constrained their
salaries should be increased in proportion.
Both candidates received warm applause from this significant audience.
Mr Redwood repeated his pledge that the winner of the ballot tonight
should be the winner.
''A majority of one will be enough,'' he said.
The final phase of the campaigning still left many back benchers in
agonising doubt.
The Major campaign, reinforced by a trawl of constituency party
opinion, were expecting a handsome victory and this means well over 200
votes.
The Scottish party reported that 69 of the 72 constituencies had
responded to the National Union, the voluntary wing of the Tory Party --
68 of them support Mr Major, and one is split. In England and Wales, 549
constituencies reported with 500 supporting Major and the remaining
split or supporting John Redwood.
All 18 Tory members of the European Parliament are backing Mr Major
and 95% of active Tory peers do so also. This was a significant message
from the party throughout the country as to what they expect of their
MPs in the ballot tonight.
At the meeting of the 92 Group in Commitee Room 17 in the Commons,
both leadership candidates spoke for about 10 minutes and answered
questions for another 20.
Mr Major did not take his back benchers beyond what he called
yesterday ''looking into the abyss'' of party disunity and severe defeat
at the next election.
Most Tories are aware if they do not come to a clear decision about
their leadership they face a Labour Party seeking to bring forward the
General Election to this autumn or next spring.
Mr Major said last night he is confident of a decisive win but refused
to reveal how he will use such a decision in revamping the image of his
leadership and his party.
He told Channel 4 News: ''We will reach an accommodation with
right-wing views after the leadership election. The differences are
there, they are to be determined, and then we will turn to the things we
agree on.''
His supporters are concerned about whether Mr Redwood, who quit the
Cabinet a week ago, should be brought back into Government immediately.
Their first concern last night was whether the Prime Minister can
achieve his decisive majority, despite his challenger's pledge that a
majority of one will be enough and he will give 100% support to the
winner.
Supporters of Michael Heseltine and Michael Portillo are still trying
to envisage the possibilty of a second ballot, which would allow their
preferred candidates to fight it out for the soul of the party.
This prospect was looking increasingly desperate last night as Redwood
supporters were chiefly concerned about him producing an anti-Major vote
of about 100, compiled of definite votes and abstentions.
At Mr Redwood's last news conference yesterday he did not endear
himself to the Majorites by declaring: ''I say to all colleagues,
consider well your vote. If you think we need a change to win, then vote
for one. There is only one way to vote for change, this is to vote for
me.''
He went on to describe Mr Major's administration as ''indecisive'' --
this is what rancours with the Major supporters who would still like to
delay Mr Redwood's return to Government.
However, the Prime Minister has promised ''no recriminations''.
Last night his supporters were pitching his vote at anything between
210 and 260. The Redwood camp are looking for a maximum vote of 80 for
Redwood plus abstentions to take the anti-Major vote up to about 100.
Most Tory MPs confessed last night to facing an ''agonising''
decision. They now know the views of the majority of their party
activists and their constituency associations. They are also trying to
weigh up which leader would best serve their individual circumstances.

vehicles as Sinn Fein and the IRA reacted angrily to the early release
of paratrooper Lee Clegg.
Private Clegg had served four years of a life sentence for the murder
of a teenage joyrider in 1990.
There were fears in both the North and Dublin that the move could
damage the fragile peace process. There have not been such street
disturbances in Northern Ireland since long before the IRA called its
ceasefire last August 1.
More than 100 cars, vans, and buses were hijacked and burned in riots
allegedly orchestrated by Sinn Fein in Republican areas of West and
North Belfast.
There were reports of two guns being used in the Falls area to flag
down commercial vehicles. One driver was taken to hospital having been
kicked and punched after attempts to force an unidentified liquid down
his throat.
A van carrying bread and milk was stopped on the Falls Road and when
the petrol tank exploded it careered forward into a petrol station.
Bystanders tried to pull it clear with ropes which kept melting before a
fire engine arrived.
In a day that shook the province, police in flak jackets and riot
helmets confronted a 1000-strong march and prevented it leaving west
Belfast en route to Belfast City Hall.
There were bomb alerts at police and Army headquarters in Lisburn,
County Antrim, in Lisburn town centre, and outside the Woodburn RUC
station in Belfast.
Army bomb disposal experts carried out controlled explosions but there
were no reports of bombs having been found.
Petrol bomb attacks on police in Belfast continued into the night. In
the Crumlin Road a crowd of around 100 blocked the street demanding the
release of Republican prisoners.
A cache of 100 petrol bombs was seized by the police in the Ardoyne
and put on display at an RUC station, where Assistant Chief Constable
Bill Stewart rejected Sinn Fein claims it had not been directing the
violence.
Mr Stewart insisted: ''This was a carefully planned and well
orchestrated campaign.''
There were similar scenes of riots in Londonderry with vehicles
hijacked and roads blocked by protesters during hours of violence.
The street violence spread beyond Belfast and Londonderry late last
night.
In the border town of Newry, a car was set alight, the site of a
former security base torched, and a council meeting disrupted by 60
protesters. In Coalisland and Strabane vehicles were hijacked and
burned, and in Armagh 40 people were reported to be involved in
disturbances.
Although the release had been expected for some time, there was
surprise the Government chose to make the announcement during the tense
period leading up to Orange Walks on July 12 and on the first day of
school holidays.
Nationalist politicians believe the move was timed to boost Mr Major's
campaign for re-election against the right-wing Mr John Redwood. This
was firmly rejected by the Northern Ireland office.
Private Clegg, 26, who hopes to resume his military career, expressed
delight as he was reunited with his family.
His release was last night being celebrated by those who had
campaigned on his behalf in London but was causing grave concern for
politicians in Dublin who fear Britain is adopting a one-sided stance.
The events could have a very serious affect on the Irish peace
process, Mr Dick Spring, the Republic's Foreign Minister, declared.
Irish Premier John Bruton said he now expected the British authorities
to adopt the same approach in all other similar cases. In the UK,
Government spokesmen were insisting the case of Private Clegg was
unique.
The Prime Minister said he regretted the violence but pledged that the
search for peace would go on. ''The people of Northern Ireland, who I
have come to know much better in the last two years, want this matter to
be brought to a satisfactory conclusion,'' he said on Channel 4 News.
''They don't wish to return to violence. A few people may have
returned to the streets tonight. I regret that but I don't think we
should over-react to it.
''We can soon solve this problem. What has happened to Private Clegg
was the end of a judicial process. That judicial process has ended but
the process of looking for a permanent peace in Northern Ireland goes
on.
''A lot is happening -- talks with the parties, talks with the Irish
Government, consideration of how we can take the matter further. We will
not let it drop.''
Feelings were already running high as police stepped in on Sunday to
block the fifth Orange march this year from proceeding along the main
Ormeau road on the edge of a Roman Catholic area.
In the loyalist Sandy Row area, where gangs of youths are guarding
hundreds of wooden pallets ready for bonfires on the July 11, kerbstones
have been painted red, white, and blue and graffiti under the signature
of the illegal Ulster Freedom Fighters warns ''Taigs (catholics)
Beware.''
As news of the release, and ensuing rioting spread, it was revealed
that chief probation officer, Ms Breidge Gadd, had resigned from the
12-member life sentence review board which considered the Clegg case.
She said the early review was a major deviation from normal practice and
she had no option but to tender her resignation.
The SDLP MP for West Belfast, Dr Joe Hendron, directly accused Sinn
Fein of inciting the violence. A GP on the Falls Road, he said he saw
well known Republican activists organising young children and teenagers
to cause the maximum disruption.
Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein vice-president, said he could not
justify violence but people had a right to protest.
He said Private Clegg's release was ''disgraceful and despicable''.
Speaking on Channel 4 News he said the British Government had ''thrown
everything back in our faces, everything that has been achieved''.
He said: ''We have shown our commitment to peace and the question
isn't what I can do, the question is, what is the British Government
going to do.
''What we have seen over the past 10 months is a British Government
which hasn't taken this peace process seriously, which has thrown the
peace process back into our faces tonight.''
Belfast Sinn Fein Councillor Pat McGeown emphasised that the party was
still committed to the peace process but the blame for the rioting was
squarely on the British Government.
Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, said the release decision was ''very,
very strange'' in the present climate. The case had gone through the
court system but the decision of nine judges, including the House of
Lords, had been overthrown.
Mr Malcolm Moss, a junior Minister at the Northern Ireland Office,
said the release had little bearing on the peace process. It should be
seen as a one-off case, viewed on its own merits.
However, Mr Sean Reilly, father of the murdered teenager Karen Reilly,
said his family had been ''devastated'' by the decision.
''We thought it was inevitable but it still comes as a hell of a
shock. We feel completely squashed, run over, disappointed, and
confused,'' he said. His wife was admitted last week to hospital with a
brain virus, which he believed was aggravated by mental pressure.
While the Catholic community has been outraged by Private Clegg's
release, Unionists are sympathetic to the paratrooper. Mr David Trimble
MP, a former university lecturer, and the Ulster Unionist's law and
order spokesman, felt he should have been freed earlier.
''The courts here were unhappy that the law required a life sentence
when his case cannot be compared with a terrorist murder. I would have
expected a four to six-year sentence for an action by a person who did
not intend to kill -- and the four years Clegg served is the equivalent
of a six-year sentence,'' he said.
The soldier, meanwhile, was looking forward to continuing his career
in the Army.
After the reunion with his family, he appeared before a large crowd of
waiting media outside the infantry training centre at Catterick
garrison.
Looking fit and relaxed, he stood smartly to attention as he faced the
cameras on a grassed area at the camp but he did not answer any
questions shouted at him.
In a written statement, he said: ''I am delighted to be out of prison
at last. I am very happy to have returned to duty this morning. I would
like to thank all those people who have supported me.
''I will be here for a few days and then I am going off on leave. I
will then return to Catterick for some refresher training after which I
hope to resume a full military career.''
He will undergo a series of medical tests, both physical and mental,
and will be offered counselling if it is required after his prison
ordeal.
Private Clegg's former colleague, Simon Cooper, said none of the men
in the patrol would change anything they did that night. He said on PM
on BBC Radio 4: ''We were just looking after our own lives.''

FOUR armed men escaped with an estimated #5m yesterday in a security
van robbery. The masked gang struck as it was making a delivery to a
Midland Bank service centre in Salford, Manchester. The driver was
threatened with a handgun and forced to open the vehicle.
A second thief entered the van and the driver was ordered to drive off
to a nearby street where cash bags and containers were transferred to a
Ford Transit van.
No-one was injured.
Securicor last night offered a reward of up to #250,000.
Meanwhile, a man was shot dead when two men armed with shotguns raided
a jeweller's shop in Billericay, Essex.
